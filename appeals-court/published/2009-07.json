Â Schulthess also appeals the requirements\r\n  that he lower the level of his pond and remove a motor home from his property.Â \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn March 2002, Schulthess, a Columbia resident, purchased a pond (North Lake) and an adjoining triangular, unimproved\r\n  parcel in Orangeburg County.Â  At that time, the level of the pond was very low\r\n  because its spillway had been leaking.Â  Whenever he visited the pond to perform\r\n  maintenance or make repairs to the spillway, Schulthess took his motor home and\r\n  parked it on his adjoining triangular lot.\r\nNorth Lake is surrounded\r\n  by several residential lots in the Country Oaks subdivision, including three lots\r\n  owned by the Santoros since 1993 (lots 1 through 3 in block &quot;K&quot; of\r\n  the subdivision).[1]Â \r\n  The Santoros' home is located on the middle lot (lot 2).Â  The deed to Schulthess's\r\n  pond describes the pond as being bound on the south by lots 1 through 4 in\r\n  block &quot;K&quot; of the subdivision, which includes the Santoros' three\r\n  lots.Â  The deed to lots 1 and 3 describes them as being bound on the north and\r\n  northeast, respectively, by a ten-foot strip reserved by the developer to\r\n  separate the lots from North Lake.Â  In contrast, the deed for lot 2 describes\r\n  its northeast boundary as simply North Lake.Â  \r\nIn June 2002, the Santoros placed their\r\n  home and the three lots on the market so they could move to Arizona.Â  The\r\n  Santoros' realtor, Century 21/The Moore Group (Century 21), listed their house\r\n  and three lots for $319,000.Â  When Schulthess discovered the realtor's sign on\r\n  the Santoros' property, he visited a former colleague who worked for Century 21\r\n  to inquire about the Santoros' asking price.Â  When he saw a copy of the real\r\n  estate listing, he noticed that it represented the Santoros' property as extending\r\n  ten feet into North Lake.Â  In late June 2002, Schulthess wrote a letter to the\r\n  Santoros' agent at Century 21 and copied the Santoros with the letter.Â  \r\nSchulthess's letter expressed disagreement\r\n  with the representation that the Santoros' property extended ten feet into his\r\n  pond and stated that the property line between the pond and many of the abutting\r\n  properties was determined by the pond's high water level.Â  The letter also\r\n  stated that Schulthess had given permission to abutting owners to use the pond,\r\n  but expressed concern about any prospective purchasers of the Santoros'\r\n  property being given the wrong impression that the Santoros could convey any formal\r\n  littoral rights to them.[2]Â \r\n  Schulthess requested the agent to revise the listing so that the Santoros'\r\n  property was not being advertised as &quot;waterfront.&quot;Â  Schulthess also\r\n  stated that there was a structure on one of the Santoros' lots that encroached upon\r\n  the pond. \r\nAs a result of Schulthess's letter, the\r\n  Santoros' realtor revised the advertisement to delete the reference to the\r\n  property extending ten feet into the water and suggested to the Santoros that\r\n  they have their property resurveyed.Â  According to the realtor's\r\n  broker-in-charge, the claims made in Schulthess's letter had to be revealed to\r\n  any prospective buyers of the Santoros' property.Â  According to Schulthess, the\r\n  Santoros never complained to him about the letter he wrote to Century 21.Â  \r\nThe Santoros later engaged the Tatum\r\n  Company to list their property for $298,500.Â  On July 15, 2003, Schulthess\r\n  wrote a letter to the Santoros' agent at the Tatum Company advising her that he\r\n  owned the pond, that the Santoros' property only extended to the pond's edge,\r\n  and that he had a five-foot easement around the pond's edge.Â  Schulthess\r\n  further stated that he understood that littoral rights applied only to natural\r\n  waterways and not to private impoundments such as his pond.Â  He suggested that\r\n  the agent &quot;legally qualify this matter&quot; before offering fishing\r\n  rights or access to the pond.Â  He stated that he believed that those rights\r\n  could only be conveyed by him.Â  According to Mary Santoro, when the real estate\r\n  agent showed the property to prospective buyers, &quot;[W]e had to tell them\r\n  that we could not pass the water rights on, [and] that they would have to get\r\n  permission from [Schulthess].&quot;Â  \r\nSometime during the latter half of 2003, Schulthess\r\n  placed a temporary stopper in the pond's leaking spillway.Â  On November 24, 2003, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) sent\r\n  a letter to Schulthess after receiving complaints from the Santoros about the\r\n  pond flooding their land.Â  DHEC instructed Schulthess to return the spillway to\r\n  normal operation within thirty days.Â  DHEC also indicated that it was unsafe to\r\n  rely on the emergency spillway to be the only spillway on the North Lake dam.Â  The letter also stated that replacing the flashboards on the spillway would\r\n  not require a permit from DHEC.Â  Schulthess noted that in a telephone call\r\n  about the letter, a DHEC representative instructed him to remove the temporary\r\n  stopper in its entirety, which Schulthess removed three days after receiving\r\n  DHEC's letter. \r\nBy January 2004, the Santoros still had\r\n  not sold their property.Â  They then filed a complaint against Schulthess, asserting\r\n  a claim for trespass due to the flooding of their property and a claim for\r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations based on Schulthess's\r\n  letters to their realtors.Â  The complaint also asserted that Schulthess violated\r\n  the restrictive covenants for the Country Oaks subdivision by parking his motor\r\n  home on his triangular lot.Â  Â Â \r\nIn Spring 2004, Schulthess repaired the\r\n  spillway. Â According to Mary Santoro, she saw Schulthess adding concrete\r\n  to the spillway and she believed that the concrete addition raised the spillway's\r\n  height.Â  However, according to another abutting owner and Schulthess, the\r\n  spillway was never raised and the concrete addition merely closed up a hole in\r\n  the spillway.Â  \r\nMary Santoro telephoned some contractors\r\n  to obtain verbal estimates on the cost of supplies for filling in eroded land,\r\n  building a retaining wall to prevent further erosion, and adding new topsoil\r\n  and sod.Â  Based on those phone calls, she understood the cost to be\r\n  approximately $25,000.Â  \r\nAfter a trial on the Santoros' claims,\r\n  the master issued an order concluding that a deed in Schulthess's chain of\r\n  title made his triangular lot subject to a provision of the subdivision's\r\n  restrictive covenants prohibiting house trailers and other temporary structures.[3]Â \r\n  The master also concluded that Schulthess was liable to the Santoros on all of\r\n  their claims.Â  The master ordered Schulthess to pay damages to the Santoros in\r\n  the amount of $108,000,[4] to lower the level of the pond, and to remove his motor home from his triangular\r\n  lot.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1. \r\n\t\tDid the evidence support the Santoros' cause of action for intentional interference with prospective contractual\r\n  relations?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t2. \r\n\t\tDid the evidence support the Santoros' cause of action for trespass?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t3. \r\n\t\tDid the master err in concluding that Schulthess's triangular lot was subject to the\r\n  restrictive covenants of the Country Oaks subdivision?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn direct appeal\r\n  from a final judgment of a master-in-equity, the scope of review is the same as\r\n  that for review of a case heard by a circuit court without a jury. Â Tiger,\r\n    Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989). Â \r\n\r\n\tWhen legal and equitable causes of action are maintained in one suit, the court is\r\n  presented with a divided scope of review. Â On\r\n  appeal from an action at law that was tried without a jury, the appellate court\r\n  can correct errors of law, but the findings of fact will not be disturbed\r\n  unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judge's\r\n  findings. Â In an equitable action tried without a jury, the appellate court can\r\n  correct errors of law and may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence. \r\n\r\nBlackmon\r\n  v. Weaver,\r\n  366 S.C. 245, 248-49, 621 S.E.2d 42, 43-44 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal citations\r\n  omitted); see also Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc.,\r\n  376 S.C. 545, 564, 658 S.E.2d 80, 90&nbsp;(2008) (holding that\r\n  the appellate court reviews questions of law de novo).Â  \r\nA tort action for damages is an action\r\n  at law. Â Longshore v. Saber Sec. Servs., Inc., 365 S.C. 554, 560, 619\r\n  S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2005). Â Therefore, the Santoros' tort cause of action\r\n  seeking damages for interference with prospective contractual relations is a\r\n  legal cause of action, and this Court may not disturb the master's factual\r\n  findings relating to this claim unless they lack evidentiary support.Â  Blackmon, 366 S.C. at\r\n  248-49, 621 S.E.2d at 43-44.\r\nAs to the Santoros' trespass claim, they\r\n  seek both damages and injunctive relief.Â  Therefore, we must look to the\r\n  action's main purpose as reflected by the nature of the pleadings, evidence,\r\n  and character of relief sought to determine whether the claim is legal or\r\n  equitable.Â  See Gordon v. Drews, 358 S.C. 598, 604, 595 S.E.2d\r\n  864, 867 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that to determine whether an action is legal\r\n  or equitable, this Court must look to the action's main purpose as reflected by\r\n  the nature of the pleadings, evidence, and character of relief sought); cf. \r\nCedar Cove Homeowners Ass'n, Inc.\r\n    v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 258, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 284, 286&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2006) (holding that while a trespass action is generally an action at law, the trespass action at\r\n  hand was equitable because the plaintiff withdrew its claim for damages and\r\n  sought only an injunction).Â  \r\nThe pleadings and evidence indicate that\r\n  the Santoros' primary purpose in asserting their trespass claim was to require\r\n  Schulthess to remove the pond's waters from the disputed location to enable\r\n  them to fill in the eroded land and to add a retaining wall, topsoil, and sod.Â \r\n  Because their primary purpose in asserting the trespass claim was to obtain\r\n  injunctive relief, the claim is equitable in nature.[5]Â \r\n  Therefore, this\r\n  Court must apply an equitable standard of review to the master's factual\r\n  findings relating to this claim and may make findings according to its own view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Blackmon, 366 S.C. at 248-49, 621\r\n  S.E.2d at 43-44.Â  Nonetheless, this broad scope of review\r\n  does not require this Court to disregard the\r\n  findings at trial or ignore the fact that the master was in a better position\r\n  to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Laughon v. O'Braitis,\r\n  360 S.C. 520, 524-25, 602 S.E.2d 108, 110&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004).\r\nThe Santoros' remaining claim seeks an injunction\r\n  to enforce their subdivision's restrictive covenants.Â  Thus, this claim also sounds\r\n  in equity.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville,\r\n  345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001) (holding that an action to\r\n  enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity); \r\nCedar Cove, 368 S.C. at 258, 628 S.E.2d at 286 (&quot;Because the [plaintiff's] action is one to enforce\r\n  restrictive covenants by injunction, it is in equity, and we may find facts in\r\n  accordance with our own view of the evidence.&quot;)\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  Therefore, this Court may make findings related to\r\n  this claim according to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Blackmon,\r\n  366 S.C. at 248-49, 621 S.E.2d at 43-44.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Intentional\r\n  Interference with Prospective Contractual Relations \r\nSchulthess argues that the Santoros failed\r\n  to present sufficient evidence to establish their cause of action for intentional\r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations and that the master erred\r\n  in concluding otherwise.Â  We agree.\r\nTo recover on a cause of action for\r\n  intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, the plaintiff\r\n  must prove that the defendant intentionally interfered with the plaintiff's\r\n  potential contractual relations for an improper purpose or by improper methods\r\n  and that the interference caused injury to the plaintiff. Â Crandall Corp.\r\n    v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 266, 395 S.E.2d 179, 180\r\n  (1990). Â If\r\n  a defendant acts for more than one purpose, his improper purpose must\r\n  predominate in order to create liability. Â Id.Â  As an alternative to\r\n  establishing an improper purpose, the plaintiff may prove that the defendant's\r\n  method of interference was improper under the circumstances.Â  Id. \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interference\r\nFirst, Schulthess is not a stranger to\r\n  any relationship that the Santoros would have with a prospective buyer because\r\n  any littoral rights or privileges that the prospective buyer could expect would\r\n  depend on Schulthess's rights as the pond owner.[6]Â \r\n  Schulthess would play an essential role in the designation of any rights or\r\n  privileges that future abutting owners have in the pond.Â  Therefore, it is\r\n  doubtful that the actions of Schulthess could conceptually fall within the\r\n  scope of the term &quot;interference.&quot;Â  Cf. Renden, Inc. v.\r\n    Liberty Real Estate Ltd. P'ship III, 444 S.E.2d 814, 818 (Ga. App. 1994) (holding\r\n  that to sustain a claim for intentional interference with business relations, the\r\n  tortfeasor must be a &quot;stranger&quot; to the business relationship at issue).[7]Â  \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prospective\r\n  Contractual Relations\r\nSchulthess argues that the Santoros\r\n  failed to establish any prospective contractual relations because they did not\r\n  present evidence of any specific prospective buyer who was &quot;chilled&quot;\r\n  by Schulthess's letters or who would have purchased the Santoros' property but\r\n  for Schulthess's claims.Â  We agree.\r\nThis Court explained the phrase\r\n  &quot;prospective contractual relations&quot; in United Educ. Distrib., LLC\r\n    v. Educ. Testing Serv., 350 S.C. 7, 14-18, 564 S.E.2d 324, 328-30 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  In that case, United\r\n  Educational Distributors (UED), which sold study aids to military personnel, asserted an intentional\r\n  interference claim against a nonprofit corporation that administered and\r\n  prepared materials for college admission tests, Educational Testing Service\r\n  (ETS).Â  Id. at 10, 564 S.E.2d at 326.Â  UED claimed that the response to\r\n  their mail advertising diminished after ETS made a concerted effort to prevent\r\n  UED from obtaining new business.Â  Id. at 11-12, 564 S.E.2d at\r\n  326-27.Â  The\r\n  Court noted that (1) UED had not alleged that it had a reasonable probability\r\n  of entering into a specific contract but for the interference with ETS;\r\n  and (2) UED had no way of knowing who did not respond to their mail ads and why\r\n  they did not respond.Â  Id. at 18, 564 S.E.2d at 330 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThis Court stated that a cause of action\r\n  for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations &quot;generally\r\n  stands following the loss of an identifiable contract or expectation.&quot;Â  Id. at 14, 564 S.E.2d at 328.Â  We held that the plaintiff must demonstrate that he\r\n  had a truly prospective or potential contract with a third party; that the\r\n  agreement was a close certainty; and that the contract was not speculative.Â  Id. at 15, 17, 564 S.E.2d at 329-30.\r\nHere,\r\n  Mary Santoro testified that a few people looked at their property.Â  However,\r\n  she did not testify as to any specific prospective purchaser who would have\r\n  made an offer on the property but for the existence of the claims that Schulthess asserted in his letters to the realtors.Â  Rather, she spoke in\r\n  generalities:\r\n\r\n\tQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Did you ever have to reveal to\r\n  anyone the contentions made by Mr. Schulthess?\r\n\tA.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.Â  When Tatum showed the\r\n  house on the second contract that I had a year later, they showed the property\r\n  to a person who was interested in the property.Â  When they look at our house,\r\n  they always ask questions about the water, if they have water rights, all that\r\n  type of thing, how muchâ€”what kind of fish are in it, what kind of boat they can\r\n  put on it, and that kind of thing.Â  So at that point, we had to tell them that\r\n  we could not pass the water rights on, that they would have to get permission\r\n  from the new owner.\r\n\tÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n  . . \r\n\tQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Did you ever have any buyer come\r\n  forward and sign a contract and say they want to buy the property?\r\n\tA.Â Â Â Â Â  No.Â  Because when they asked the\r\n  question about the lake and I can't give them water rights, people who want the\r\n  lake are not going to make the contract.Â  It discourages them because they wantâ€”they\r\n  come to look at the house because it's on the lake, generally.\r\n\r\nThis testimony points to no identifiable\r\n  prospective buyer who considered the perceived lack of water rights to be the\r\n  sole deal-breaker, and, therefore, the Santoros presented insufficient evidence\r\n  that an identifiable third party was influenced by Schulthess's communications\r\n  with the Santoros' realtors.Â  See Walker v. Sloan, 529 S.E.2d 236,\r\n  242 (N.C. Ct. App. 2000) (holding that to state a claim for wrongful interference\r\n  with prospective advantage, the plaintiffs must allege facts to show that the\r\n  defendants acted without justification in inducing a third party to refrain\r\n  from entering into a contract with them and that the contract would have ensued\r\n  but for the interference); cf. Bocook\r\n    Outdoor Media, Inc. v. Summey Outdoor Adver., Inc., 294 S.C. 169,\r\n  178, 363 S.E.2d 390, 394 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding that to maintain a cause of\r\n  action for interference with a contract that is terminable at will, the plaintiff\r\n  must show that, but for the interference, the contractual relationship would\r\n  have continued), overruled on other grounds by O'Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525,\r\n  431 S.E.2d 555 (1993).Â  \r\nFurthermore, the master concluded that it\r\n  was &quot;more likely than not&quot; that the Santoros' property would have\r\n  been sold within six months at the listing price had they not been required to\r\n  disclose the claims in Schulthess's letters.Â  The master based this finding, at\r\n  least in part, on the testimony of the broker-in-charge at Century 21, Jeannine\r\n  Keys.Â  Ms. Keys stated that she hoped all of the properties her agency listed\r\n  would sell within ten percent of the listing price and within the listing\r\n  period.Â  Mary Santoro also testified that she hoped to sell the property within\r\n  six months to a year.Â  The testimony of these witnesses does not reasonably\r\n  support the master's finding that the property &quot;more likely than not&quot;\r\n  would be sold within six months.Â  Based on the foregoing, the evidence of a\r\n  prospective contractual relation was purely speculative and therefore did not\r\n  support a claim for intentional interference with prospective contractual\r\n  relations.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improper Purpose\r\n  or Method\r\nSchulthess argues that he could not be\r\n  found liable for intentional interference because he was merely asserting his\r\n  property rights.Â  We agree.\r\nWe find no evidence in the record to\r\n  suggest any purpose or motive by Schulthess other than the pursuit of his own\r\n  legal rights. Â &quot;Generally, there can be no finding of intentional\r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations if there is no evidence to\r\n  suggest any purpose or motive by the defendant other than the proper pursuit of\r\n  [his or her] own contractual rights with a third party.&quot;Â  Eldeco, Inc. v.\r\n    Charleston County Sch. Dist., 372 S.C. 470, 482, 642 S.E.2d 726, 732\r\n  (2007) (quoting S. Contracting, Inc. v. H.C. Brown Constr. Co., 317 S.C. 95, 102, 450\r\n  S.E.2d 602, 606 (Ct. App. 1994)).\r\nHere, Schulthess had a bona fide right\r\n  to express concern about the statements in the realtor listings.Â  There is\r\n  insufficient evidence in the record that the abutting owners had any legal\r\n  rights in the pond as opposed to revocable permission informally given by\r\n  Schulthess and previous owners of the pond.[8]Â \r\n  The Santoros introduced only a 1976 letter authored by the son of the developer's\r\n  principal that described abutting owners' &quot;rights to th[e] lake.&quot;Â \r\n  There is no reliable evidence in the record to indicate that the abutting\r\n  owners were in fact granted littoral rights in this private pond.Â  Rather, the\r\n  record indicates that the developer and subsequent pond owners, including\r\n  Schulthess, had given merely revocable permission to the abutting owners and\r\n  their guests to use the pond. \r\nMoreover, even if some of the legal\r\n  claims in Schulthess's letters were inaccurate, there is no evidence to support\r\n  the master's implicit finding that Schulthess knew that the claims were inaccurate\r\n  when he made them.[9]Â \r\n  Additionally, the master made no conclusion that Schulthess should have known\r\n  of any inaccuracies or should have consulted with legal counsel before sending\r\n  the letters.\r\nThere is no evidence in the record to\r\n  suggest any purpose or motive by Schulthess other than the pursuit of his own\r\n  legal rights. Â Additionally, nothing in the record supports the master's\r\n  conclusion that Schulthess used an improper method to pursue his rights.[10]Â \r\n  The fact that the Santoros' realtor was obligated to reveal to prospective buyers\r\n  the claims in Schulthess's letters did not make it improper for Schulthess to\r\n  send the letters to the realtors.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the master erred\r\n  in concluding that Schulthess intentionally interfered with any potential\r\n  contractual relations of the Santoros for an improper purpose or by an improper\r\n  method. Â See Eldeco, Inc., 372 S.C. at\r\n  482, 642 S.E.2d at 732; see also Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 55-56,\r\n  557 S.E.2d 676, 688 (Ct. App. 2001) (affirming the circuit court's grant of a directed\r\n  verdict motion on a claim for intentional interference with prospective\r\n  contractual relations on the basis that the exercise of a legal right does not\r\n  constitute an improper motive or improper purpose and stating that there was no\r\n  evidence to suggest any purpose or motive by the defendant other than the protection\r\n  of his rights); S. Contracting,\r\n    Inc., 317 S.C. at 102, 450 S.E.2d at 606 (affirming summary\r\n  judgment on a claim for intentional interference with prospective contractual\r\n  relations on the ground that there was no evidence to suggest any purpose or\r\n  motive by the defendant other than the proper pursuit of its contract rights\r\n  with the codefendant).Â  \r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Damages\r\nSchulthess argues that there was\r\n  insufficient evidence of damages resulting from his letters to the Santoros'\r\n  realtors to sustain a claim for intentional interference with prospective\r\n  contractual relations.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;The trial judge has considerable\r\n  discretion regarding the amount of damages, both actual or punitive.&quot; Â Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., \r\n358 S.C. 298, 310-311, 594 S.E.2d 867, 873 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp; Because of this discretion, this\r\n  Court's review on appeal is limited to the correction of errors of law. Â Id.Â  This Court's task in reviewing a damages award is not to weigh the evidence,\r\n  but to decide if any evidence exists to support the damages award.Â  Id.\r\nHere, the master found that Mary Santoro's\r\n  testimony on the increase in mortgage rates sufficiently supported the\r\n  Santoros' claim for damages:\r\n\r\n\tI find that the mortgage rate increase\r\n  and damages flowing from that increase are not speculative.Â  The Plaintiff\r\n  testified that the mortgage interest rate was up [two percent] and that over\r\n  the life of a loan for thirty (30) years the additional costs will be $78,000.Â \r\n  Both of these are capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to\r\n  sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.Â  See S. C. R. Evid. 201\r\n  C. [sic]Â  I find that the damages from the intentional interference which [sic]\r\n  prospective contracted [sic] relations are $78,000.00.\r\n\r\nMary Santoro's testimony regarding the\r\n  rise in interest rates is insufficient evidence of damages because it is based\r\n  on the speculative assumptions that (1) the Santoros could have found a suitable\r\n  new home immediately after selling their property in Country Oaks; (2) they could\r\n  have immediately obtained a suitable mortgage loan; and (3) Mary Santoro had\r\n  sufficient personal knowledge of the interest rate that an unknown lender would\r\n  charge them based on their particular circumstances.Â  Therefore, there is insufficient\r\n  evidence to support the damages award on the intentional interference claim.Â  See \r\nWhisenant v. James Island Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796&nbsp;(1981)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that in order for damages to be\r\n  recoverable, the evidence should be such as to enable the court or jury to\r\n  determine the amount with reasonable certainty or accuracy and that neither the\r\n  existence, causation, nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess,\r\n  or speculation).Â  Â Â \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Trespass\r\nSchulthess\r\n  argues that the evidence does not support the Santoros' trespass cause of\r\n  action and that the master erred in awarding damages and ordering an injunction\r\n  for this claim. Â We agree. Â \r\nFor a trespass action to lie, the act must be affirmative, the invasion of the land must be\r\n  intentional, and the claimed harm must be the direct result of that invasion.Â  \r\nHawkins v. City of Greenville,\r\n  358 S.C. 280, 297, 594 S.E.2d 557, 566&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004).Â  \r\nHere, the\r\n  Santoros claim that Schulthess's actions of temporarily stopping up the pond's\r\n  spillway and subsequently permanently repairing the spillway resulted in an\r\n  invasion of their land causing permanent damage.Â  We find insufficient evidence\r\n  in the record to support this claim.Â  The Santoros presented no reliable\r\n  evidence of permanent damage directly resulting from the three days of flooding\r\n  caused by the placement of the temporary stopper in the spillway. Â As to Schulthess's permanent repair of the spillway, there\r\n  was insufficient evidence of a resulting invasion of the Santoros' land as is required\r\n  to grant relief for trespass.Â  \r\nRegarding the placement of the temporary\r\n  stopper in the spillway, counsel for Schulthess conceded that the stopper temporarily\r\n  raised the spillway from its original level for the three days that it was in\r\n  place.Â  And Schulthess does not claim that his pond bed extends past the water\r\n  level that would result from the proper functioning of the spillway at its\r\n  original level.Â  Rather, he argues that the boundary between his pond bed and\r\n  lot 2 is North Lake at &quot;full pool,&quot; which he characterizes as the\r\n  point at which the water begins to fall over a properly functioning spillway.[11]Â \r\n  Hence, Schulthess's concession that the temporary stopper raised the spillway beyond\r\n  its original level compels the conclusion that the resulting water level\r\n  extended past the original pond bed to invade lot 2 for a three-day period.Â  \r\nHowever, the master's award of\r\n  injunctive relief as well as $25,000 in damages for this fleeting trespass is\r\n  not supported by the evidence. Â The Santoros failed to present reliable evidence that\r\n  any permanent damage directly resulted from the three days of flooding.Â  Although\r\n  counsel for Schulthess questioned Mary Santoro about the allegation in her\r\n  complaint that the value of her land had diminished, she did not give any\r\n  opinion as to any amount of diminution in the property's value.Â  In fact, she indicated\r\n  that there was no significant change in the value of her land from 2002 to the\r\n  date of trial.Â  Further, the evidence shows that the Santoros contributed to\r\n  the erosion of which they complained by neglecting to control the effect of\r\n  rainfall on the downward slope of their land and by cutting down several trees\r\n  and burning vegetation.Â  Therefore, we find no evidence of permanent damage directly\r\n  resulting from Schulthess's temporary trespass.\r\nAs to Schulthess's permanent repair of\r\n  the spillway, we find no resulting invasion of the Santoros' land, which is required to\r\n  grant relief for trespass.Â  See Hawkins, 358 S.C. at 297, 594 S.E.2d at 566 (requiring an\r\n  invasion of land to establish trespass). Â The probative value of the Santoros'\r\n  evidence of the boundary between their property and the pond is questionable,\r\n  especially in light of the discrepancies between the plats commissioned by the\r\n  Santoros and the original subdivision plat.[12] Â Further, Mary Santoro conceded that the spillway was leaking when she and her husband\r\n  purchased their property and that the resulting level of the pond was below its\r\n  original level until Schulthess purchased the pond and began working on the\r\n  spillway.Â \r\n  Moreover, her claim that Schulthess raised the level of the spillway above\r\n    its original level when he made permanent repairs was not supported\r\n  by probative evidence.Â  Therefore, we find that the Santoros did not carry\r\n  their burden of showing that the water level resulting from the spillway's\r\n  repair invaded their land.Â  \r\nIn any event, the evidence of damages that the\r\n  Santoros claim resulted from the spillway's repair was not reliable because the contractors\r\n  from whom Mary Santoro obtained supply cost estimates did not view the property\r\n  in question, and they were not available at trial for questioning.Â  See \r\nWhisenant, 277 S.C. at 13, 281 S.E.2d at 796&nbsp;(holding that in order for damages to be recoverable, the evidence should\r\n  be such as to enable the court or jury to determine the amount with reasonable\r\n  certainty or accuracy and that neither the existence, causation, nor amount of\r\n  damages can be left to conjecture, guess, or speculation).Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the master erred\r\n  in awarding injunctive relief and damages to the Santoros on their trespass\r\n  claim.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Restrictive\r\n  Covenants\r\nAs\r\n  to the Santoros' cause of action to enforce their subdivision's restrictive\r\n  covenants, Schulthess argues that his triangular lot is not subject to the\r\n  restrictive covenants, which prohibits house trailers and other temporary\r\n  structures.Â  We agree. Â \r\nThe master conceded that the subdivision's restrictive\r\n  covenants as originally filed did not apply to Schulthess's triangular lot\r\n  because it was not one of the specifically enumerated lots listed as being\r\n  covered by the covenants.Â  However, the master concluded that the language in a\r\n  deed in Schulthess's chain of title made his triangular lot subject to the\r\n  restrictive covenants.Â  Schulthess asserts that the deed's language does not\r\n  make his lot subject to the restrictive covenants.Â  Thus, we must determine the\r\n  meaning of the language in question.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\tIn construing a deed, &quot;the intention\r\n  of the grantor must be ascertained and effectuated, unless that intention\r\n  contravenes some well settled rule of law or public policy.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;In\r\n  determining the grantor's intent, the deed must be construed as a whole and\r\n  effect given to every part if it can be done consistently with the law.&quot; Â &quot;The\r\n  intention of the grantor must be found within the four corners of the deed.&quot;\r\n\r\nWindham\r\n  v. Riddle,\r\n  381 S.C. 192, 201, 672 S.E.2d 578, 582-83 (2009) (internal citations omitted).Â \r\n  As to restrictive covenants, the paramount rule of construction Â is to give\r\n  effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.Â  McClellanville,\r\n  345 S.C. at 622, 550 S.E.2d at 302.\r\n\r\n\tThe court may not limit a restriction in a deed, nor,\r\n  on the other hand, will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction\r\n  or implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it\r\n  may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later\r\n  developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written. It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the\r\n  use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in\r\n    favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that\r\n  this rule of strict construction should not be applied so as to defeat the\r\n  plain and obvious purpose of the instrument. It follows, of course, that where\r\n  the language of the restrictions is equally capable of two or more different\r\n  constructions that construction will be adopted which least restricts the use\r\n  of the property. A restriction on the use of property must be created in\r\n    express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions\r\n  are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use\r\n  of property. \r\n\r\nId. (emphasis in\r\n  original) (quoting Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4-5, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863-64 (1998)).\r\nThe determination of the grantor's intent\r\n  when reviewing a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of law for the\r\n  court.Â  Hunt v. Forestry Comm'n, 358\r\n  S.C. 564, 568, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004).Â  Likewise, the\r\n  determination of whether the language of a restriction in a deed is ambiguous\r\n  is a question of law.[13]Â  See McClellanville, 345 S.C. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 302-03 (applying\r\n  rules of contract construction to a restrictive covenant in a deed).Â  This Court reviews questions of law de novo.Â  \r\nFields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 564, 658 S.E.2d 80, 90&nbsp;(2008).Â \r\n  In other words, a reviewing court is free to decide questions of law with no\r\n  particular deference to the trial court.Â  Hunt, 358 S.C. at 569,\r\n  595 S.E.2d at 848-49.Â  \r\nIf this Court decides that the language\r\n  in a deed is ambiguous, the determination of the grantor's intent then becomes\r\n  a question of fact.Â  See McClellanville, 345 S.C. at 623, 550 S.E.2d\r\n  at 303 (applying rules of contract construction to a restrictive covenant in a\r\n  deed).Â  As to this claim to enforce the subdivision's\r\n  restrictive covenants, we may find facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  See McClellanville, 345 S.C. at\r\n  622, 550 S.E.2d at 302 (holding that an action to enforce restrictive covenants\r\n  by injunction is in equity); Cedar\r\n    Cove, 368 S.C. at 258, 628 S.E.2d\r\n  at 286 (&quot;Because the [plaintiff's] action\r\n  is one to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction, it is in equity, and we\r\n  may find facts in accordance with our own view of the evidence.&quot;) (citation omitted).Â  Regardless, whether we view\r\n  the determination of the grantor's intent as a question of law or as a question\r\n  of fact, we conclude that the grantor did not intend to subject the triangular\r\n  lot to the subdivision's restrictive covenants.Â  \r\nThe deed in question evidences four separate\r\n  conveyances of property to W.M. Harvey, IV.Â  A clause immediately following the third listed property description (for Lot 23 in Block &quot;S&quot; in\r\n  the subdivision) states,\r\n\r\n\tThis conveyance is made subject to\r\n  restrictive covenants and conditions as are contained in an Agreement dated April 22, 1974 of record in the office of the REM for Orangeburg County in Deed Book 395,\r\n  at Page 573.\r\n\r\nTMS#Â \r\n  0137-00-10-016\r\n(emphasis added).Â \r\n  In stark contrast, the other three property descriptions in the deed, including\r\n  the description of Schulthess's triangular lot, did not have any similar\r\n  language following them; each description was merely followed by a tax map\r\n  number.Â  \r\nContrary to the master's implicit interpretation of\r\n  the deed, the plain meaning of the term &quot;conveyance&quot;â€”the way it is most\r\n  commonly used and understoodâ€” is the actual transfer of the property itself\r\n  rather than the deed evidencing the transfer. Â See Black's\r\n  Law Dictionary 357-58 (8th ed. 2004) (defining &quot;conveyance&quot;\r\n  in the following descending order:Â  &quot;1. The voluntary transfer of a\r\n  right or of property . . . 2.Â  The transfer of a property right that does not\r\n  pass by delivery of a thing or merely by agreement.Â  3.Â  The transfer of an\r\n  interest in real property from one living person to another, by means of an\r\n  instrument such as a deed.Â  4.Â  The document ([usually] a deed) by which such a\r\n  transfer occurs.&quot;).Â  Hence, a deed evidencing the transfer of multiple\r\n  parcels does not constitute a single &quot;conveyance&quot; as that term is\r\n  commonly used\r\n  and understood.Â  \r\nTherefore, the plain meaning of the deed's\r\n  language regarding restrictive covenants is that the transfer of the property\r\n  described in the immediately preceding paragraph (i.e., &quot;Lot #23, Block\r\n  &quot;S&quot;, on a plat of Oakmont Subdivision&quot;), rather than all four\r\n  parcels described in the deed, was subject to the restrictive covenants.Â  If the grantor\r\n  had intended to make the remaining parcels subject to the restrictive\r\n  covenants, the plural form of the term &quot;conveyance&quot; would have been\r\n  used and either the restrictive language would have followed the deed's final\r\n  property description or\r\n  similar restrictive language would have immediately followed the property\r\n  description of each parcel so that the application of the restrictive covenants\r\n  to all four parcels would have been unmistakable.Â  See \r\nMcClellanville, 345\r\n  S.C. at 622, 550 S.E.2d at 302 (requiring restrictions to be created\r\n  in express terms or by unmistakable implication and doubts to be\r\n  resolved in favor of free use of property) (emphasis added); Windham,\r\n  381 S.C. at 201, 672\r\n  S.E.2d at 582-83 (requiring\r\n  determination of grantor's intent in deed from whole document).Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOur conclusion that the grantor did not intend to\r\n  subject Schulthess's triangular lot to the restrictive covenants is consistent\r\n  with the geography of the various parcels described in the deed. Â Only one of\r\n  the four property descriptions was for a typical residential subdivision lot (Lot\r\n  #23, Block &quot;S&quot;), and that description logically preceded the deed's language\r\n  regarding restrictive covenants. Â In contrast, two of the deed's four\r\n  property descriptions were for parcels that were not part of the subdivisionâ€”a\r\n  parcel on Wannamaker Street in the City of Orangeburg and Schulthess's\r\n  triangular parcel.Â  Moreover, another property description was for North Lake itself.Â  Clearly, the geography of the North Lake parcel and the parcels located\r\n  outside the subdivision make it highly improbable that the grantor intended to\r\n  subject them to the subdivision's restrictive covenants.Â  \r\nIn sum,\r\n  the language of the deed in question makes only one of its four conveyances\r\n  subject to the subdivision's restrictive covenantsâ€”that conveyance immediately\r\n  preceding the language concerning the restrictive covenants (Lot 23 of Block &quot;S&quot;\r\n  in Oakmont). Â Therefore, the master erred in concluding that the restrictive covenants\r\n  applied to Schulthess's triangular parcel and in requiring him to remove his\r\n  motor home from the property.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the master's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The subdivision's\r\n  original name was &quot;Oakmont Subdivision&quot; but later changed to &quot;Country\r\n  Oaks.&quot; \r\n[2] Littoral rights\r\n  are special rights allowing owners of land abutting oceans,\r\n  seas, or lakes to make &quot;reasonable use&quot; of the body of water for any\r\n  lawful purpose.Â  White's\r\n    Mill Colony, Inc. v. Williams, 363 S.C. 117, 129,\r\n  609 S.E.2d 811, 817-18&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2005) (dicta).\r\n[3] The original\r\n  restrictive covenants were created in 1974.Â  In 1990, the document was amended\r\n  to allow for an increase in the allowable square footage of homes in the\r\n  subdivision.Â  In his order, the master conceded that the restrictive covenants\r\n  as originally filed did not apply to Schulthess's triangular lot because it was\r\n  not one of the specifically enumerated lots listed as being covered by the\r\n  covenants.Â  Nevertheless, the master found that certain language in a deed\r\n  conveying the triangular lot to Schulthess's predecessor-in-title subjected the\r\n  lot to the subdivision's restrictive covenants. \r\n[4] The master\r\n  awarded $25,000 to the Santoros for the alleged trespass and $78,000 for the\r\n  Santoros' claim for intentional interference with prospective contractual\r\n  relations.Â  \r\n[5]We recognize\r\n  that the ownership of the land on which the claimed trespass occurred was in\r\n  dispute and that prior appellate opinions characterize actions involving\r\n  trespass claims as legal when the defendant challenges the plaintiff's\r\n  ownership of the land.Â  See  Mountain\r\n    Lake Colony v. McJunkin, 308 S.C.\r\n  202, 204, 417 S.E.2d 578, 579&nbsp;(1992)&nbsp;(holding that because the\r\n  defendant's answer raised an issue of paramount\r\n  title to land, the plaintiff's action for damages for conversion of\r\n  timber and trespass, for an injunction against entry of land, and for a declaratory\r\n  judgment concerning the land's title was an action at law); \r\nCorley v. Looper, 287 S.C. 618, 620-21, 340 S.E.2d 556, 557&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1986)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that an action for damages and injunctive\r\n  relief preventing defendants from crossing a tract of land was in the nature of\r\n  a trespass action to try title because a review of the evidence showed that the\r\n  plaintiffs' primary purpose in bringing the action was to determine title to\r\n  the disputed tract).Â  However, these cases\r\n  reveal that the plaintiffs' main purpose in bringing the action was the\r\n  determination of title to the disputed tract.Â  Thus, the Mountain Lake Court implicitly recognized that the main purpose in bringing the action is\r\n  the overriding consideration in determining whether a claim is legal or\r\n  equitable, and the Corley Court explicitly recognized the main purpose\r\n  in bringing the action as the controlling consideration.Â  In contrast to the\r\n  Santoros' complaint, the complaint in Mountain Lake included a\r\n  request for a declaratory judgment concerning the land's title.Â  In Corley,\r\n  this Court expressly concluded that the evidence revealed the plaintiff's\r\n  primary purpose as the determination of title to the disputed tract.Â  The Corley Court also noted that while the plaintiffs'\r\n  complaint sought injunctive relief, the trial judge granted none and the plaintiffs\r\n  did not object to his failure to grant the relief. Â Here, the Santoros' main purpose in bringing their action\r\n  was simply to restore their surrounding environment to the condition it was in\r\n  prior to Schulthess's work on the pond's spillway.Â  The first step in that\r\n  restoration was obtaining an injunction requiring Schulthess to lower the level\r\n  of the pond. \r\n[6] See \r\nWhite's Mill Colony,\r\n  Inc., 363 S.C. at 130-35, 609\r\n  S.E.2d at 818-20 (holding that the owners of all or part of the bed of a\r\n  private, manmade, nonnavigable pond have the right to exclude others from\r\n  accessing or using the surface waters and noting that abutting landowners are\r\n  free to bargain with the owner of the pond bed for the conveyance of an\r\n  easement or some other right of access to the pond's waters).Â  \r\n[7] In Renden,\r\n  the Georgia Court of Appeals explained that under appropriate circumstances, a\r\n  party can be a nonsigner of a particular contract and yet not be a stranger to\r\n  the contract itself or to the underlying business relationship. Â Id. Â The court concluded that the defendant in that case was not a stranger to the\r\n  business relationship at issue, but rather, as a lessor, was an essential\r\n  entity in a prospective lessor/lessee/sublessee relationship.Â  Id.Â  Here, Schulthess would be an essential player in the designation of any rights\r\n  or privileges that abutting owners would have in the pond.\r\n[8] See \r\nWhite's Mill Colony,\r\n  Inc., 363 S.C. at 134-35, 609\r\n  S.E.2d at 820&nbsp;(noting that owners of land abutting a private, manmade, nonnavigable pond are free to bargain with the owner of the pond bed for the\r\n  conveyance of an easement or some other right of access to the pond's waters).Â  \r\n[9] The master\r\n  found that Schulthess &quot;intentionally sent false claims to the realtor,\r\n  knowing that the claim [sic] would have to be revealed.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\n[10] See Love\r\n  v.

(Gopal) and Super 8\r\n  Motels, Inc.&nbsp; (SMI).Â  The circuit court issued an order granting summary\r\n  judgment to Gopal and SMI, and Bass seeks review of that order. Â We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn summer 1999, Bass and several\r\n  co-workers began staying at a Super 8 motel in Orangeburg while they were in\r\n  the area performing refrigeration work at a local Bi-Lo grocery store.Â  Almost\r\n  three months after Bass began staying at the motel, a stranger showed up at\r\n  Bass' room on the night of September 28, 1999, and knocked on the door at\r\n  approximately 10:00 p.m.Â  Neither Bass nor his roommate, Wayne Kinlaw, answered\r\n  the door.Â  A few minutes later, there was a second knock.Â  Bass and Kinlaw\r\n  looked through the window beside the door. Â They saw a man whom Bass recognized\r\n  as the man who stood near him at a convenience store earlier in the evening.Â  They\r\n  asked him what he wanted, and he began mumbling something unintelligible.Â  Bass\r\n  and Kinlaw did not open the door.Â  Approximately ten to fifteen minutes later,\r\n  there was a third knock.Â  Kinlaw then opened the door, and both Kinlaw and Bass\r\n  stepped outside.Â  Kinlaw went back into the room while Bass stayed outside and asked\r\n  the stranger to stop knocking on their door.Â  The stranger demanded money from\r\n  Bass; however, Bass refused. Â The stranger then shot Bass in his leg with a\r\n  small-caliber weapon.Â  \r\nBass filed this negligence action\r\n  against Gopal, the motel's owner, and SMI, the franchisor.Â  In his complaint,\r\n  Bass asserted that Gopal and SMI were negligent in failing to provide adequate\r\n  security at the motel.Â  Both Gopal and SMI filed motions for summary judgment.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nIn opposition to the summary judgment\r\n  motions, Bass submitted the affidavit of his expert witness, Harold Gillens.Â  Gillens,\r\n  who was in the business of examining buildings to assess security needs, stated\r\n  that the motel where Bass was shot was located in a &quot;high crime&quot; area\r\n  and the motel's security was inadequate.Â  However, the statistics on which\r\n  Gillens relied related to the time period between the years 2000 and 2004,\r\n  which post-dated Bass' injury at the motel.Â  Â Â \r\nGillens also stated in his affidavit he\r\n  obtained a CRIMECAST\r\n  Site Report, which measures the risk of criminal activity at a particular site\r\n  and rates the site in comparison to a national average, a state average, and a\r\n  county average for various categories of crimes.Â  This report is attached to\r\n  Gillens' preliminary report.Â  Gillens noted that the CRIMECAST report shows the\r\n  site of the motel had a predicted crime risk of 3.69 times the national average\r\n  for the year 1999.Â  However, the predicted crime risk represents the overall risk\r\n  of crime; there are other indicators for the risk of crimes against persons\r\n  (versus crimes against property) and for the risk of specific crimes, for\r\n  example, robbery.Â  Notably, the motel site rates below the county average for\r\n  aggravated assault and for all crimes against persons for 1999. \r\nIn support of their summary judgment\r\n  motions, Gopal and SMI presented testimony from the depositions of Bass, Gillens,\r\n  and Gopal's principal, Hitesh Patel.Â  Patel testified that Gopal had owned the\r\n  motel since January 1998 and he was not aware of any criminal activity at the\r\n  motel prior to the night Bass was shot.Â  He also testified that he was not\r\n  aware of any criminal complaints filed by anyone in the general area.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Bass testified that he had been staying at the motel for a few months prior to\r\n  the shooting and he had not noticed any criminal activity at the motel during\r\n  this time period. \r\nGillens admitted that if no significant criminal\r\n  activity had occurred at the motel for a period of time prior to Bass'\r\n  shooting, then the motel's management would have no reason to expect the\r\n  shooting to occur or to spend money to enhance security.Â  Gillens also admitted\r\n  that (1) the motel's perimeter lighting was appropriate; (2) the motel's room\r\n  doors were appropriate and met statutory requirements;[1] (3) Bass would have stayed safe in his motel room; (4) he should have stayed in\r\n  his motel room; and (5) he should have telephoned for assistance.Â  Â Â Â \r\nOn the day of the motions hearing, SMI filed an affidavit of its Senior Director of Franchise Administration setting forth SMI's\r\n  lack of involvement in the day-to-day operations of Gopal's motel.[2]Â \r\n  Bass submitted a motion to strike the affidavit on the ground it was not timely\r\n  filed or served.Â  The circuit court denied the motion to strike and granted the\r\n  motions for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court concluded that neither Gopal\r\n  nor SMI had a duty to protect Bass because they did not know or have reason to\r\n  know the shooting would occur.Â  The circuit court also concluded that Bass'\r\n  negligence exceeded any negligence on the part of Gopal or SMI.Â  Additionally, the circuit court found there was no evidence SMI owned or operated the motel\r\n  and therefore SMI could not be held legally responsible for the motel's\r\n  operation on the date of the shooting. \r\nBass later filed a motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, on the ground he had\r\n  newly-obtained evidence of local crime statistics for a time period preceding\r\n  the date of the shooting. Â Attached to the motion was the affidavit of Bass'\r\n  new expert witness, Danny McDaniel. Â McDaniel, a private investigator, stated\r\n  he attempted to obtain crime statistics for the City of Orangeburg for the two\r\n  years prior to the date of Bass' injury.Â  He further stated that the City had\r\n  lost their records for crime statistics prior to the year 2000 due to a change\r\n  in software vendors.Â  McDaniel obtained from the South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division crime statistics for Orangeburg County for the two years prior to the\r\n  shooting, but he was unable to present statistics for the specific area where\r\n  the motel was located.Â  The circuit court denied Bass' Rule 59 motion.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL \r\n1.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the circuit court err in ruling that Gopal and SMI owed no duty of care to\r\n  Bass?\r\n2.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the circuit court err in concluding as a matter of law that Bass' negligence\r\n  exceeded any negligence on the part of Gopal or SMI?\r\n3.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the circuit court err in finding that there was no evidence that SMI owned or operated the motel in question?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  this Court applies the same standard as that required for the circuit court\r\n  under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688,\r\n  692 (2000).&nbsp; Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as\r\n  to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\r\n  of law.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Adamson\r\n    v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 332 S.C. 121, 124, 503\r\n  S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).&nbsp; To determine if any genuine issues\r\n  of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duty of care\r\nBass argues that the circuit court erred\r\n  in concluding Gopal\r\n  and SMI owed no duty to protect Bass once he left his motel room to confront\r\n  the assailant.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn innkeeper's\r\n  acts or omissions may be negligent if the innkeeper realized or should have\r\n  realized its conduct involved unreasonable risks of harm through the conduct of\r\n  a third person, even though such conduct of the third person is criminal. \r\nDaniel v. Days Inn of Am., Inc.,\r\n  292 S.C. 291, 296, 356 S.E.2d 129, 132&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1987) (citing Courtney v.\r\n    Remler,\r\n  566 F. Supp. 1225, 1232 (D.S.C. 1983)). Â &quot;[A]n innkeeper is under a duty to its guests to take reasonable action\r\n  to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical harm.&quot;Â  Allen v.\r\n    Greenville Hotel Partners, Inc., 405 F. Supp. 2d 653, 659&nbsp;(D.S.C.&nbsp;2005)\r\n  (quoting Courtney, 566 F. Supp. at 1231).Â  \r\nWhile an\r\n  innkeeper is not the insurer of safety for his guests, he owes to his guests\r\n  the duty of exercising reasonable care to maintain in a reasonably safe\r\n  condition those parts of his premises which a guest may be expected to use.Â  Courtney, 566 F. Supp.\r\n  at 1233 (applying South Carolina law).Â  In the final\r\n  analysis, the issue is whether, under all the circumstances, the innkeeper\r\n  provided for its guests reasonable protection against injuries from criminal\r\n  acts.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  analysis in the Courtney opinion is instructive.Â  In this case, the\r\n  United States District Court for the District of South Carolina applied South Carolina law to a negligence claim against an innkeeper and analyzed the amount of\r\n  protection an innkeeper must afford its guests in the context of the amount and\r\n  types of criminal activity that had previously occurred on the premises.Â  The\r\n  court noted that although criminal activity on the defendant's premises was\r\n  foreseeable, only minor vandalism had occurred in the past, and there had been\r\n  no criminal acts committed against a person. The court stated &quot;[t]his fact\r\n  is important when considering the amount of protection the [innkeeper] must\r\n  afford its guests.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nBass contends that the circuit court\r\n  should not have relied on the analysis in Miletic v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\r\n  339 S.C. 327, 529 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 2000) in concluding that Gopal and SMI owed no duty to protect Bass once he left his motel room.Â  In Miletic, this Court\r\n  held that a merchant is not charged with the duty of protecting its customer\r\n  against criminal acts of third parties when it did not know or have reason to\r\n  know such acts were occurring or about to occur.Â  Id. at 330, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 69.Â  Bass\r\n  argues a\r\n  different analysis applies to innkeepers.Â  \r\nWhile Bass\r\n  correctly notes the distinction between innkeepers and merchants in general,\r\n  the answer to whether a defendant has breached any duty remains the same under\r\n  either analysis.Â  Therefore, the circuit court's reliance on Miletic was\r\n  harmless.[3]Â \r\n  Both analyses depend on the defendants' knowledge of past or impending crimes\r\n  on the premises; the innkeeper analysis uses this factor to determine the\r\n  appropriate standard of care; and the merchant analysis uses this factor to\r\n  determine whether there exists any duty of care in the first instance.[4]Â  \r\nHere, under\r\n  either analysis, Gopal and SMI did not breach a duty of care to Bass.Â  Bass\r\n  failed to present any probative evidence of prior criminal activity at the\r\n  motel or the surrounding area.[5]Â  Further,\r\n  although\r\n  Gillens stated that a security survey and a crime analysis should have been\r\n  conducted to determine the vulnerability of the premises, there is no South Carolina law that imposes such a duty on business owners.Â  Gillens admitted such an\r\n  analysis is not routinely performed by hotels and motels.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  conclude that Patel should not have been expected to know about the contents of the CRIMECAST\r\n  report.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nMoreover, Gillens admitted that if no\r\n  significant criminal activity had occurred at the motel for a period of time\r\n  prior to Bass' shooting, then the motel's management would have no reason to\r\n  expect the shooting to occur or to spend money to enhance security.Â  Gillens\r\n  also admitted Bass would have stayed safe in his motel room.Â Â Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, there was no genuine issue of material fact preventing\r\n  summary judgment. Â All of the evidence with any probative value indicates that the\r\n  security measures that Gopal already had in place were adequate.[6]Â \r\n  Bass' own expert witness admitted that the motel's perimeter\r\n  lighting was appropriate; the motel's room doors were appropriate and met\r\n  statutory requirements; and Bass would have stayed safe in his motel room.Â  Under\r\n  all the circumstances, Gopal provided reasonable protection for its guests against\r\n  injuries from criminal acts.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Comparative Negligence\r\nBass\r\n  asserts that the circuit court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that Bass'\r\n  negligence exceeded any negligence on the part of Gopal or SMI.Â  We disagree.\r\nIf\r\n  the sole reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence is that the\r\n  plaintiff's negligence exceeded fifty percent, the circuit court may determine\r\n  judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant.Â  \r\nBloom v. Ravoira,\r\n  339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713&nbsp;(2000).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Bass' own expert witness admitted that Bass would have stayed safe in his room\r\n  and he should have stayed in his room and telephoned for assistance.Â  Bass'\r\n  expert also admitted the motel's lighting and room doors were appropriate and the\r\n  doors met statutory requirements.Â  In contrast, there was no probative evidence\r\n  Gopal or SMI breached any duty of care to Bass.Â  Based on the foregoing, the\r\n  only reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence is that Bass'\r\n  negligence in stepping outside of his room and confronting the assailant exceeded\r\n  any possible innkeeper negligence.Â  Therefore, Bass' comparative negligence was\r\n  a proper ground on which to grant summary judgment to Gopal and SMI.\r\nIII.&nbsp; SMI's\r\n  Liability\r\nBass\r\n  contends that the circuit court erred in ruling that there was no evidence that\r\n  SMI operated the motel.Â  We disagree.\r\nFor the Court to find that SMI operated the motel, there must be evidence it asserted sufficient control over the motel's\r\n  daily operations.Â  Cf. Allen v. Greenville Hotel Partners, Inc., 409 F. Supp. 2d 672, 679\r\n  (D.S.C. 2006) (stating that in determining whether a franchisee could be\r\n  an agent of the franchisor for the purpose of a negligence action arising from a\r\n  hotel fire, the court must consider whether the franchisor exerted sufficient\r\n  control over the daily operations or hotel security).Â  \r\nBass argues that the\r\n  following evidence shows that SMI operated the motel:Â  (1)Â  SMI inspects the motel every three months to determine how the property is run; (2) during the\r\n  inspection, SMI checks the components of nine rooms, including the bed,\r\n  television, lock systems, peep holes, and tubs; (3) SMI provides a checklist of\r\n  changes to be made; and (4) SMI requires owners to attend training.Â  However,\r\n  these facts do not establish SMI asserted sufficient control over the motel's\r\n  daily operations for a reasonable fact finder to say SMI operated the motel.Â  Cf. Allen, 409 F. Supp. 2d at 677 (stating that the clear trend in the case\r\n  law in other jurisdictions is that the quality standards, operational standards,\r\n  and inspection rights contained in a franchise agreement do not establish a\r\n  franchisor's control or right of control over the franchisee sufficient to ground\r\n  a claim for vicarious liability as a general matter). Â \r\nA comparison of the relationship between SMI and Gopal to the franchise relationship in Allen is instructive.Â  In Allen, the\r\n  franchise agreement and the franchisor's Rules and Regulations set forth that\r\n  the franchisees (1) owned the building, land, and hotel equipment; (2) held the\r\n  operating licenses and permits; (3) hired, fired, supervised, and disciplined\r\n  the franchisee's employees; (4) determined employee wages and room rates; (5)\r\n  provided daily training for employees; and (6) provided insurance for the\r\n  hotel. Â Allen, 409 F. Supp. 2d at 677.Â  The franchisor's Rules and\r\n  Regulations required the franchisees to have life safety systems and an\r\n  emergency evacuation plan. Â Id.Â  The Rules and Regulations also recommended\r\n  an emergency power generator and sprinkler system.Â  Id. Â \r\nThe court in Allen noted\r\n  that neither the franchise agreement nor the franchisor's Rules and Regulations\r\n  established the franchisor operated the hotel or controlled its life safety\r\n  systems. The court found that the franchisees operated the hotel under \r\nthe franchisor's Rules and Regulations.Â  Id. Â (emphasis added).Â  The court also found the franchisor did not control the\r\n  hotel's daily operations or hotel security and life safety systems and through\r\n  the franchise agreement and the Rules and Regulations, the franchisor merely maintained\r\n  uniform service and public good will.Â  Allen, 409 F. Supp. 2d at 679.Â \r\n  The court thus concluded the franchisor could not be liable on an agency theory.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  according to the testimony of Hitesh Patel, Gopal entered into a franchise\r\n  agreement with SMI, and the agreement required Gopal to (1) handle the daily\r\n  management of the motel's operations; (2) obtain liability insurance; (3) allow\r\n  the franchisor to inspect the premises every three months; (4) attend a\r\n  training seminar; and (5) pay to the franchisor eight percent of the profits from\r\n  the motel's operation.Â  Bass presented no probative evidence showing SMI controlled the motel's daily operations or its security.Â  Rather, the evidence shows SMI set\r\n  in place certain standards for Gopal to follow to protect SMI's good will and\r\n  that Gopal controlled the daily operation of the motel to implement SMI's\r\n  standards.Â  \r\nBass\r\n  also argues that the circuit court should have stricken the affidavit of SMI's\r\n  Senior Director of Franchise Administration due to its late service and filing.Â \r\n  The affidavit set forth SMI's lack of involvement in the day-to-day operations\r\n  of Gopal's motel.Â  Assuming, arguendo, that the circuit court should not have\r\n  considered the affidavit,[7] any such error does not affect the result of this case and therefore is not\r\n  reversible.Â  See Jensen v. Conrad, 292 S.C. 169, 172, 355 S.E.2d\r\n  291, 293&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1987) (holding that a judgment will not be\r\n  reversed for insubstantial errors not affecting the result).&nbsp; Patel testified that he handled the motel's daily\r\n  operations, and Bass presented no probative evidence in opposition.Â  Therefore,\r\n  there was no genuine fact issue as to the operation of the motel that would\r\n  prevent summary judgment in SMI's favor. Â See \r\nStrickland v. Madden, 323\r\n  S.C. 63, 68, 448 S.E.2d 581, 584&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994) (holding that an\r\n  adverse party may not rely on the mere allegations in his\r\n    pleadings to withstand a summary judgment motion, but must set forth\r\n  specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's order granting summary judgment to Gopal and SMI is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 45-1-90(A) (Supp. 2008) (requiring rooms to be equipped with a lock\r\n  system and a viewing device such as a peephole or side window).\r\n[2] SMI served the\r\n  affidavit on counsel for Bass a few days before the motions hearing.Â  \r\n[3] See \r\nJensen v. Conrad, 292 S.C. 169,\r\n  172, 355 S.E.2d 291, 293&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1987) (holding that a judgment\r\n  will not be reversed for insubstantial errors not affecting the result).\r\n[4] South Carolina\r\n  case law imposes a duty on innkeepers to provide to its guests reasonable\r\n  protection against injuries from criminal acts, and the\r\n  actual amount of protection required depends on amount and types of criminal\r\n  activity that have previously occurred on the premises.Â  See \r\nDaniel,\r\n  292 S.C. at 296, 356 S.E.2d at 132 (holding that an\r\n  innkeeper's acts or omissions may be negligent if the innkeeper realized or\r\n  should have realized that its conduct involved unreasonable risks of harm\r\n  through the conduct of a third person, even though such conduct of the third\r\n  person was criminal); Courtney, 566\r\n  F. Supp. at 1233 (applying South Carolina law and\r\n  analyzing the amount of protection an innkeeper must afford its guests in the\r\n  context of the amount and types of criminal activity that had previously\r\n  occurred on the premises).Â  As to merchants in general, the duty to protect\r\n  customers against criminal acts of third parties is qualified by actual or\r\n  constructive knowledge that a crime is occurring or is about to occur.Â  See Miletic, 339 S.C. at 330, 529 S.E.2d at 69.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\n[5] Bass also asserts\r\n  the circuit court erred in denying his motion to alter or amend because his\r\n  inability to obtain from the City of Orangeburg crime statistics pre-dating his\r\n  injury injects into his case a novel issue precluding summary judgment.Â \r\n  However, even if the Court considers the new evidence presented in Bass' motion\r\n  to alter or amend (the affidavit of Bass' second\r\n  expert witness), that new evidence is not probative of the crime history\r\n  of the specific location of the motel.Â  The affidavit presents county statistics that do not raise a fact issue with\r\n  respect to the specific location of the motel, especially when considered in\r\n  light of Hitesh\r\n  Patel's testimony that he was not aware of any criminal activity at the motel\r\n  prior to the night that Bass was shot.Â Â Â  \r\n[6] In Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803&nbsp;(2009), our Supreme\r\n  Court stated that in cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.Â  However, in footnote 3 of the opinion, the Court was\r\n  careful to point out that its pronouncement concerning a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence was not necessary for its determination of the outcome in the Hancock case.Â  In any event, we must assume any evidence, even a scintilla, that\r\n  is useful to withstand a summary judgment motion must meet the prerequisite of\r\n  being probative.Â  See McDowell v. Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 179, 41 S.E.2d 872, 874-75&nbsp;(1947) (holding\r\n  that although there was a scintilla of testimony that could be used to support\r\n  the claimants' position, when the entire testimony of the witnesses was viewed\r\n  as a whole, it was obvious the testimony in support of claimants' position\r\n  rested on speculation and thus had no probative value).&nbsp; In the instant case, we cannot find even a scintilla\r\n  of probative evidence to withstand Gopal's and SMI's summary judgment motions.\r\n[7] Bass' counsel\r\n  does not cite any authority in his brief to support the argument that the\r\n  affidavit should have been stricken.Â  Therefore, he has actually abandoned this\r\n  argument.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (requiring the citation of\r\n  authority in the argument portion of an appellant's brief); Hunt v. Forestry\r\n    Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564, 573, 595 S.E.2d 846, 851&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004)\r\n  (holding that issues raised in a brief but not supported by authority are\r\n  deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4578","title":"Cole Vision v.

Raymond Moore,\r\n  III, and Adam J. Neil, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY,\r\n  J.:Â  Dr. Steven C. Hobbs argues the trial court erred in granting\r\n    Cole Vision Corporation's (Cole) Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss.Â  Specifically,\r\n    Hobbs maintains he pled facts sufficient to constitute a negligence cause of\r\n    action, while the trial court found spoliation of evidence an evidentiary\r\n    matter which cannot serve as the basis for an independent cause of action under\r\n    South Carolina law.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHobbs is a licensed\r\n  optometrist who subleased a space from Cole.Â  Cole leased the space from Sears\r\n  Roebuck and Company (Sears). Â Pursuant to the sublease between Cole and Hobbs,\r\n  Hobbs agreed to indemnify Cole and Sears for any liability they might incur on\r\n  account of his negligence. Â Additionally, Hobbs procured insurance for\r\n  Cole and Sears' benefit pursuant to the sublease from an insurance company both\r\n  parties refer to as NCMIC.\r\nWhile Hobbs was\r\n  operating his optometry business out of his subleased space from Cole, he\r\n  treated Mary Lewis as a patient in 2002.Â  After Hobbs treated her she was later\r\n  diagnosed with glaucoma by another doctor.Â  In 2004, Mary Lewis and her husband,\r\n  John, sued Cole, Sears, and Hobbs alleging Hobbs was negligent in failing to\r\n  properly diagnose and treat her.Â  Mary Lewis maintained the glaucoma went\r\n  unnoticed and untreated due to Hobbs's negligent treatment. Â She is now blind\r\n  in both eyes, allegedly because of the undiagnosed glaucoma.Â  Â \r\nPursuant\r\n  to the sublease's indemnification provision, Cole and Sears maintained they\r\n  were entitled to insurance coverage from NCMIC and requested NCMIC provide\r\n  their defense in the Lewis suit. When NCMIC refused to defend and indemnify\r\n  Cole and Sears, they brought a declaratory judgment action against Hobbs and\r\n  NCMIC. In their declaratory judgment action against Hobbs and NCMIC,\r\n  Cole and Sears asked the trial court to find that Hobbs contractually agreed to\r\n  hold harmless and to indemnify Cole and Sears in the event they were sued. Further,\r\n  Cole and Sears asked the trial court to find that NCMIC was obligated to\r\n  provide coverage and indemnify Cole and Sears under its professional liability\r\n  coverage with Hobbs. Additionally, Cole and Sears requested attorney's\r\n  fees and costs.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  his answer and counterclaim, Hobbs asserted Cole had a duty to preserve patient\r\n  history profiles kept in its custody. Â Hobbs alleged Cole lost Mary\r\n  Lewis's patient history profile and breached a duty to him to preserve this\r\n  evidence. Hobbs requested the trial court declare Cole liable for any liability\r\n  Hobbs may have to the Lewises and Sears. Furthermore, Hobbs asked the trial\r\n  court to find he had no duty to Cole and that Cole is obligated to reimburse\r\n  him for attorney's fees and costs. Â \r\nCole\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss Hobbs's counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRCP, on the ground that South Carolina law does not recognize a cause of\r\n  action for spoliation of evidence. The trial court granted Cole's motion to\r\n  dismiss finding the alleged spoliation of evidence was an evidentiary matter\r\n  for the trial court and could not serve as a basis for an independent cause of\r\n  action under South Carolina law. Hobbs appeals the trial court's finding.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts\r\n  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.&quot;Â  Spence v. Spence, 368\r\n  S.C. 106, 116, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874&nbsp;(2006).Â  The appellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial\r\n  court in reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\n  Â Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2007).Â  &quot;In\r\n  considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts\r\n  sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial court must base its\r\n  ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.&quot; Â Id.Â  A\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6) motion may not be sustained if facts alleged and inferences\r\n  reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any\r\n  theory of the case. Â Id.Â  &quot;The question is whether, in the light\r\n  most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf,\r\n  the complaint states any valid claim for relief.&quot; Â Id.Â  The court\r\n  should not dismiss a complaint merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will\r\n  prevail in the action. Â Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Spoliation of Evidence\r\nHobbs\r\n  argues he sufficiently pled a negligence cause of action rather than a\r\n  spoliation of evidence cause of action in his answer and counterclaim.Â \r\n  Accordingly, he maintains the trial court erred in dismissing his counterclaim\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.[1]Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  his counterclaim, Hobbs alleged Cole required he turn over his patients'\r\n  profiles and records for Cole to maintain custody and control.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Hobbs alleged Cole had a duty to preserve these profiles and records based on\r\n  this requirement and assumption of control.Â  Hobbs alleged Cole breached its\r\n  duty by losing Mary Lewis's patient profile, a key piece of evidence with\r\n  regard to her examination and his liability.Â  As a result of this breach, Hobbs\r\n  contends his ability to defend Mary Lewis's claim has been impaired, and he has\r\n  incurred defense expenses. Consequently, Hobbs argues his counterclaim alleged\r\n  facts sufficient to constitute a negligence cause of action against Cole.Â  Cole\r\n  argues Hobbs is attempting to circumvent South Carolina's lack of recognition\r\n  of a spoliation of evidence cause of action by alleging the spoliation was done\r\n  negligently. \r\n&quot;In\r\n  a negligence action, a plaintiff must show that the (1) defendant owed a duty\r\n  of care to the plaintiff, (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or\r\n  omission, (3) defendant's breach was the actual and proximate cause of the\r\n  plaintiff's injury, and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.&quot; Â Dorrell\r\n    v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 361 S.C. 312, 318, 605 S.E.2d 12, 15 (2004).Â \r\n  &quot;The existence of a duty owed is a question of law for the courts.&quot;Â  Washington\r\n    v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 405, 523 S.E.2d 204, 206 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nÂ We find Hobbs pled facts sufficient to overcome a\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, dismissal based on a negligence cause of action.Â  In his answer\r\n  and counterclaim, Hobbs argued Cole lost Mary Lewis's patient history profile\r\n  and &quot;breached its duty to [Hobbs] to preserve this evidence and Cole's\r\n  spoliation of this evidence is negligence.&quot; We believe Hobbs should have\r\n  the opportunity to prove Cole assumed a duty to maintain patient records on\r\n  Hobbs's behalf through either contract, relationship, or some other special\r\n  circumstance. Â Hubbard v. Taylor, 339 S.C. 582, 589, 529 S.E.2d 549, 552\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;[A]n affirmative legal duty to act may be created by\r\n  statute, contract, relationship, status, property interest, or some other\r\n  special circumstance.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, we find Hobbs sufficiently pled that\r\n  Cole breached its duty to Hobbs by losing Mary Lewis's patient history profile\r\n  which affected his ability to defend himself and subsequently caused him to\r\n  suffer damages. Â Accordingly, we find that viewed in the light most favorable\r\n  to Hobbs, the facts alleged in his counterclaim constitute a negligence cause\r\n  of action, and we reverse the trial court's dismissal of Hobbs's counterclaim\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Tort of Negligent\r\n  Spoliation and Novelty Issues\r\nBased\r\n  upon our finding as to the negligence issue, we need not address the remaining\r\n  issues on appeal. Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not\r\n  review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive\r\n  of the appeal). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Hobbs pled\r\n  facts sufficient to constitute a negligence cause of action and thus the trial\r\n  court's dismissal of Hobbs's counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Cole asserts Hobbs's negligence claim was not addressed\r\n  in the trial court's order granting the motion to dismiss and because Hobbs did\r\n  not file a Rule 59(e) motion, the issue of whether South Carolina would allow\r\n  recovery for &quot;negligent spoliation&quot; is not preserved for review. Hobbs\r\n  contends the issue was raised to the trial judge and ruled upon at the motion\r\n  hearing.Â  At the hearing, the trial judge found: &quot;[t]hough it may have\r\n  some reference to negligence, I believe it is an evidentiary matter that is\r\n  dealt with through other means and it does not constitute an independent cause\r\n  of action.&quot; We find this is a sufficient ruling on the negligence issue,\r\n  and therefore, the issue is preserved for our review.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4579","title":"State v.

Â The victim initially lied to the hospital staff and to the police\r\n  about how she was injured.Â  She told the emergency room doctor she hit the dashboard\r\n  when Howard slammed on the brakes.Â  Howard was arrested after the victim felt\r\n  safe enough to tell the police what really occurred the night of the incident. Â She\r\n  testified Howard struck her twice with his fists.Â  Howard testified the victim\r\n  was out of control, and he unintentionally hit her while attempting to get a\r\n  clear view of the road. Â He stated he was unsure whether his blow broke\r\n  her nose or whether she hit the dashboard.Â  Howard testified he and the\r\n  victim had been drinking the day of the incident. \r\nHoward was impeached with three prior\r\n  ABHAN convictions. Â The trial court ruled Howard's convictions for ABHAN from\r\n  November 1995, April 2004, and December 2004 were within the ten year rule and\r\n  the probative value of their admission outweighed the prejudicial effect to\r\n  Howard. Howard objected to the admission of his prior convictions on the ground\r\n  the prejudicial nature of the convictions outweighed the probative value.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of trial, the jury\r\n  found Howard guilty of ABHAN and the trial court sentenced Howard to eight\r\n  years imprisonment.Â  The trial court also found Howard's ABHAN conviction\r\n  violated the terms of two probationary sentences. Howard consented to have the\r\n  two probation revocation hearings held at the same time immediately following the\r\n  ABHAN sentencing. Â There, the trial court revoked Howard's first probation case\r\n  consecutively for eight years and his second probation case consecutively for\r\n  four and a half years. This appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A judge must exercise sound\r\n  judicial discretion in determining whether his impartiality might reasonably be\r\n  questioned.&quot;Â  State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 111, 561 S.E.2d 618,\r\n  624 (Ct. App. 2002). Â &quot;Absent evidence of judicial prejudice, a judge's\r\n  failure to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal.&quot; Â Id.Â \r\n  &quot;It is not enough for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege\r\n  bias. The party must show some evidence of bias.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;Furthermore,\r\n  the alleged bias must be personal, as distinguished from judicial, in nature.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;The admission or exclusion of\r\n  evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial [court], whose decision\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Swafford, 375 S.C. 637, 640, 654 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2007) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an\r\n  error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary\r\n  support.&quot;Â  State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 315, 652 S.E.2d 409, 415\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion\r\n  of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and\r\n  the resulting prejudice.&quot;Â  State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 508, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 59, 64 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Motion\r\n  for mistrial\r\nHoward\r\n  argues the trial court erred in declining to grant his motion for a mistrial. We\r\n  find this issue abandoned on appeal. An issue is deemed abandoned\r\n  and will not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authority. Â Glasscock, Inc.\r\n    v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Howard\r\n  failed to cite any authority in support\r\n  of his assertion that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\n  mistrial. Therefore, Howard abandoned this issue on appeal, and we decline to consider the argument. \r\nII.&nbsp; Trial\r\n  judge's failure to recuse himself \r\nHoward argues the trial judge erred in\r\n  failing to recuse himself. Â We disagree. \r\n&quot;A judge must exercise sound\r\n  judicial discretion in determining whether his impartiality might reasonably be\r\n  questioned.&quot;Â  State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 111, 561 S.E.2d 618,\r\n  624 (Ct. App. 2002). Â &quot;Absent evidence of judicial prejudice, a judge's\r\n  failure to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal.&quot; Â Id.Â \r\n  &quot;It is not enough for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege\r\n  bias. The party must show some evidence of bias.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;Furthermore,\r\n  the alleged bias must be personal, as distinguished from judicial, in nature.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In addition, &quot;a judge is not disqualified in a criminal action\r\n  because of an adverse decision in a former case involving entirely different\r\n  and unrelated criminal charges against the same party.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Cabiness, 273 S.C. 56, 57, 254 S.E.2d 291, 292 (1979). \r\nThe alleged bias in this case stems from\r\n  a previous trial where the trial judge found Howard in contempt and gave him a\r\n  six month sentence. Â The trial judge indicated he had no animosity\r\n  toward Howard and was not aware Howard had filed a complaint with the clerk of\r\n  court. Moreover, the trial judge noted the incident in question occurred three\r\n  years earlier and that he had not seen or heard from Howard since that time.Â  Â There is no\r\n  evidence the trial judge had any personal bias toward Howard.Â  The alleged bias\r\n  in this case stems from a previous judicial proceeding where the trial judge\r\n  was obligated to handle Howard's contempt.Â  Â Accordingly, the trial judge had\r\n  no proper basis to recuse himself and did not abuse his discretion in declining\r\n  to recuse himself from the trial.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Interference\r\n  with the presentation of a defense\r\nHoward argues the trial court erred in interfering\r\n  with his presentation of a defense. Â We believe this issue is not\r\n  properly preserved for review.\r\nDuring Howard's testimony, the State\r\n  asked &quot;how much had [the victim] had as it relates to drinking anything\r\n  non-alcoholic or alcoholic, what was that?&quot;Â  In response, Howard testified\r\n  the victim used cocaine the night before the incident. Â The State objected on\r\n  the ground the testimony was non-responsive and asked that the testimony be\r\n  stricken from the record.Â  The trial court asked the jury to disregard Howard's\r\n  testimony.Â  The State again objected when Howard testified the victim used\r\n  Oxycontin in response to the State's question as to whether or not the victim\r\n  had consumed beer or alcohol the day of the injury.Â  The trial court sustained\r\n  the objection and asked the jurors to &quot;disregard the comments that you\r\n  just heard that refer to illegal drug use on the part of anyone else in this\r\n  case.&quot; \r\nHoward made no objection to the trial\r\n  court's instruction that any testimony regarding illegal drug use was not to be\r\n  considered.Â  Therefore, Howard's argument that the trial court interfered with\r\n  his presentation of a defense is not preserved for review.[1]Â  See State v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 130, 564 S.E.2d 372, 375 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002) (&quot;An issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\nIV.&nbsp; Admission\r\n  of stun gun and pepper spray \r\nHoward argues\r\n  the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the stun gun and pepper spray\r\n  found in his pockets when he was arrested.Â  However, Howard failed to\r\n  contemporaneously object to the testimony regarding these items. Therefore, we\r\n  find this issue is not properly preserved for review.Â  See State v.\r\n    Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001) (&quot;[M]aking a\r\n  motion in limine to exclude evidence at the beginning of trial does not preserve\r\n  an issue for review because a motion in limine is not a final determination. Â The\r\n  moving party, therefore, must make a contemporaneous objection when the\r\n  evidence is introduced.&quot;).\r\nAt the start of trial, defense counsel\r\n  made a motion in limine to exclude the admission of the stun gun and\r\n  pepper spray, arguing those items were not relevant. The trial court reminded defense\r\n  counsel to make a contemporaneous objection and asked the State to inform defense\r\n  counsel in advance when the testimony concerning the stun gun and pepper spray\r\n  would be offered. The State informed defense counsel it planned to illicit\r\n  testimony regarding the stun gun and pepper spray from arresting officer Ron\r\n  Crabtree. Â Officer Crabtree later testified that at the time he placed Howard\r\n  under arrest a check of his pockets revealed a stun gun and a can of pepper\r\n  spray.Â  Defense counsel made no objections during Officer Crabtree's\r\n  testimony and waited until after the testimony of the next witness to place his\r\n  objection to the admission of the stun gun and pepper spray on the record. Â The\r\n  trial court noted the objection was not contemporaneous and explained that the\r\n  testimony was permitted because it was relevant and probative on the issue of\r\n  the victim's fear of Howard. \r\nAlthough defense counsel made an in\r\n  limine motion to suppress the introduction of the stun gun and pepper spray\r\n  into evidence, counsel did not renew his objection at trial when the testimony\r\n  regarding these items was entered into evidence.Â  Because no objection was\r\n  renewed at the time the evidence was offered, the matter is not preserved for\r\n  appeal.Â  See id. \r\nV.&nbsp; Admission\r\n  of prior convictions\r\nHoward argues the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting his prior ABHAN convictions. Â We find the trial court erred by not\r\n  conducting an on-the-record balancing test weighing the probative value of\r\n  Howard's prior convictions against their prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  the trial court's admission of Howard's prior ABHAN convictions and we remand this\r\n  issue to the trial court for a proper balancing test.Â  \r\n&quot;The admission or exclusion of\r\n  evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial [court], whose decision\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot; Â Â State\r\n    v. Swafford, 375 S.C. 637, 640, 654 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (citation omitted). Â Â &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is\r\n  based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary\r\n  support.&quot;Â  Â State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 315, 652 S.E.2d 409, 415\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion\r\n  of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and\r\n  the resulting prejudice.&quot; Â Â State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 508,\r\n  626 S.E.2d 59, 64 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\nAccording to Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, prior\r\n  convictions punishable by more than one year imprisonment are admissible for\r\n  impeaching the credibility of a defendant who testifies when &quot;the court\r\n  determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its\r\n  prejudicial effect to the accused.&quot; Our Supreme Court has approved the\r\n  five-factor analysis generally employed by the federal courts for weighing the\r\n  probative value for impeachment of prior convictions against the prejudice to\r\n  the accused.Â  State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 627, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2000).Â \r\n  The following factors, along with any other relevant factors, should be\r\n  considered by the trial court: (1) the impeachment value of the prior crime;\r\n  (2) the point in time of the conviction and the witness's subsequent history;\r\n  (3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime; (4) the importance of\r\n  the defendant's testimony; and (5) the centrality of the credibility issue.Â  Id.\r\nIn State v. Martin, this court noted\r\n  a preference for an on-the-record Colf balancing test by the trial court:\r\n\r\n\tWhile Colf involved the admission\r\n  of prior convictions more than ten years old under Rule 609(b), SCRE, this\r\n  court has implicitly recognized the value of these factors in making such a\r\n  determination under Rule 609(a)(1), and urged the trial bench to not only articulate\r\n  its ruling, but also provide the basis for it, thereby clearly and easily\r\n  informing the appellate courts that a meaningful balancing of the probative\r\n  value and the prejudicial effect has taken place as required by Rule 609(a)(1).\r\n\r\n347\r\n  S.C. 522, 530, 556 S.E.2d 706, 710 (Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).Â  An on-the-record balancing test is particularly important for\r\n    prior similar convictions under Rule 609(a)(1) because the &quot;similarity\r\n  of a prior crime to the crime charged heightens the prejudicial value of the\r\n  crime.&quot; State v.\r\n    Elmore,&nbsp;368 S.C. 230, 239, 628 S.E.2d 271, 275&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\nThe trial court ruled Howard's\r\n  convictions for ABHAN from November 1995, April 2004, and December 2004 were\r\n  within the ten-year rule and the probative value of their admission outweighed\r\n  the prejudicial effect to Howard. Â While the trial court found this case was\r\n  one of credibility, the court further found Howard's previous ABHANs were probative\r\n  on the issue of whether he was capable of committing such an act. The trial\r\n  court ruled it would limit the prejudicial effect by not allowing testimony\r\n  that the victims in two of the prior ABHANs were Howard's mother and the victim\r\n  in this case. Â The trial court also noted that a contemporaneous instruction would\r\n  be given to the jurors advising them that Howard's prior convictions were not\r\n  to be used to determine his guilt or innocence.Â  During Howard's testimony\r\n  regarding the convictions and during final jury instructions, the trial court\r\n  informed the jury that Howard's prior convictions could be used to weigh\r\n  Howard's credibility but not his propensity to commit the offense. Â Â \r\nHoward argues that while the trial court\r\n  indicated his prior convictions were admitted for the purpose of determining\r\n  his credibility, the trial court further stated the convictions were admitted\r\n  because they were probative of whether he was capable of committing the ABHAN.Â \r\n  He argues the trial court's basis for admitting the prior convictions\r\n  constituted an error as a matter of law. Â However, Howard did not object\r\n  to the trial court's basis for admitting his prior convictions, therefore we\r\n  find this issue is not properly preserved for review.Â  See State v.\r\n    Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 130, 564 S.E.2d 372, 375 (Ct. App. 2002) (&quot;An issue\r\n  must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).\r\nHoward\r\n  also argues the prejudicial effect of admitting his prior convictions outweighs\r\n  the probative value.Â  We remand this issue to the trial court for an on the\r\n  record balancing test weighing the probative value of Howard's prior\r\n  convictions against their prejudicial effect. \r\nGiven the similarity between the prior\r\n  convictions and the crime charged we cannot conclude Howard was not prejudiced\r\n  by the admission of his prior convictions.Â  Although evidence of the prior\r\n  convictions may be probative of Howard's credibility, they were highly\r\n  prejudicial because they involved the same conduct for which Howard was on trial.Â  See State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 517-18, 633 S.E.2d 152, 156\r\n  (2006) (holding that when a prior offense is similar to the charged offense the\r\n  &quot;danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from impeachment by that\r\n  prior offense weighs against its admission.&quot;); State v. Scriven,\r\n  339 S.C. 333, 343, 529 S.E.2d 71, 76 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that when prior\r\n  convictions are &quot;similar or identical to charged offenses . . . the\r\n  likelihood of a high degree of prejudice to the accused is inescapable.&quot;).\r\n  While the trial court articulated that Howard's prior convictions were\r\n  probative of his credibility, the trial court provided no analysis of the\r\n  prejudicial impact of admitting these prior convictions.Â  Therefore, we find\r\n  the trial court erred by not conducting the proper on-the-record balancing test\r\n  when weighing the probative value and prejudicial impact of Howard's prior\r\n  convictions and we remand this issue to the trial court.\r\nOn remand the trial court should conduct\r\n  a hearing on the admissibility of Howard's prior convictions and carefully\r\n  weigh the probative value of the Â prior convictions for impeachment purposes\r\n  against their prejudicial effect.Â  See Colf, 337 S.C. at 629, 525\r\n  S.E.2d at 249; Scriven, 339 S.C. at 344, 529 S.E.2d at 77 (finding the appellate\r\n  court should not undertake a Rule 609 balancing test, but should remand the\r\n  issue to the trial court).Â  If upon remand the trial court determines the prejudicial\r\n  impact to Howard outweighs the probative value of impeachment, the court should\r\n  order a new trial.Â  See Scriven, 339 S.C. at 344, 529 S.E.2d at 77.Â \r\n  Otherwise, the conviction and sentence should be affirmed subject to appellate\r\n  review.Â  Id. Â Therefore, we reverse the trial court's admission of\r\n  Howard's prior convictions, and we remand this issue to the trial court for an\r\n  on-the-record Colf balancing test.Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp; Probation\r\n  revocation\r\nHoward argues the trial court erred in\r\n  holding a probation revocation hearing and revoking his probation without a\r\n  probation violation warrant. Â We disagree.\r\nDuring sentencing after Howard's ABHAN\r\n  trial, the court heard from Agent Brown, Howard's probation officer.Â  Agent\r\n  Brown informed the court Howard had pending warrants in two probation cases for\r\n  failure to report, failure to notify of arrest, and failure to follow\r\n  instructions of probation agent. Â Defense counsel conceded his client's\r\n  ABHAN conviction constituted a violation of his probation cases, and indicated\r\n  he had no objection to the &quot;jurisdiction or venue of this court today to\r\n  hear these probation violation hearings.&quot; Â Additionally, defense\r\n  counsel suggested the court only consider Howard's ABHAN conviction as the\r\n  violation.Â  In response, the Department of Probation agreed to withdraw the\r\n  prior two warrants and &quot;issue a new citation charging [Howard] only with\r\n  the new conviction, and disregard the other charges.&quot; Â The court\r\n  asked defense counsel if he had any objection to this procedure and he\r\n  indicated that he had &quot;none whatsoever.&quot;Â  \r\nPursuant to section 24-21-450 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2007) a warrant must be issued and the probationer must be\r\n  served with the warrant before probation can be revoked.Â  However, section\r\n  24-21-300 of the South Carolina Code (2007) permits the use of a citation and affidavit\r\n  in lieu of a warrant. Â The probation citation in the record indicates Howard\r\n  was served with the citation during sentencing following his ABHAN conviction.Â \r\n  Accordingly, because Howard was served with the citation the trial court did\r\n  not err in holding a probation revocation hearing and revoking Howard's\r\n  probation.Â  Therefore, the ruling of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We note the\r\n  jury heard testimony that the victim had been drinking for seven hours on the\r\n  day in question. Â Therefore, Howard's defense that the victim was\r\n  intoxicated was before the jury even without the illegal drug use testimony.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4580","title":"Lanier Construction v.

Yobs, of\r\n  B&amp;Y, stated in his deposition that he and Mike Cupp discussed the location\r\n  of his septic tank, and Mike Cupp offered to mark the location.Â  While the\r\n  septic tank was never marked, it is undisputed that B&amp;Y knew its location\r\n  and worked around the septic tank for three months.Â  This work included\r\n  receiving a concrete delivery without incident.Â  \r\nThree months after\r\n  Mike Cupp's and Yobs's conversation, B&amp;Y hired Lanier to deliver concrete.Â \r\n  B&amp;Y instructed another subcontractor on the site, who B&amp;Y claimed was\r\n  aware of the septic tank location, to receive the concrete delivery from\r\n  Lanier.Â  However, the subcontractor on duty denied B&amp;Y ever informed him of\r\n  the tank location.Â  Lanier's concrete truck driver stated the subcontractor\r\n  informed him the septic tank was in the front yard, not in the back yard where\r\n  he was delivering the concrete.Â  As a result of the confusion, Lanier's concrete\r\n  truck fell through the Cupps' septic tank, resulting in substantial damage to\r\n  the truck.Â  \r\nLanier sued B&amp;Y\r\n  and the Cupps to recover their damages.Â  The trial court granted the Cupps'\r\n  motion for summary judgment, finding the Cupps were not liable.Â  Citing Larimore\r\n    v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 531 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000), and Sides v. Greenville Hospital System, 362 S.C. 250, 607 S.E.2d\r\n  362 (Ct. App. 2004), the trial court stated:Â  &quot;Moreover, under South\r\n  Carolina law, a general contractor 'generally equates to an invitor and assumes\r\n  the same duties that the landowner has, including the duty to warn of dangers\r\n  or defects known to him but unknown to others.'&quot;Â  Additionally, the trial\r\n  court held:\r\n\r\n\tSince\r\n  [Lanier] in this case was a business invitee of [B&amp;Y], it was [B&amp;Y] who\r\n  owed the duty to warn of the condition. . . . Here, it is not disputed that the\r\n  general contractor, [B&amp;Y], invited [Lanier] to the premises and was to\r\n  supervise the delivery of the concrete.Â  It is not disputed that the Cupps did\r\n  not know that the delivery was being made and had no supervisory role in the\r\n  construction being conducted.Â  In addition, it is not disputed that [B&amp;Y]\r\n  was informed of the septic tank and shown its location.Â  Any breach of duty, if\r\n  any, in this instance falls on the shoulders of the general contractor and not\r\n  the owner of the land.\r\n\r\nBoth Lanier and B&amp;Y filed\r\n  motions to reconsider, and both were denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the trial court.Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C.\r\n  242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â  The circuit court should grant summary\r\n  judgment &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining\r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  &quot;A court considering summary judgment neither\r\n  makes factual determinations nor considers the merits of competing testimony;\r\n  however, summary judgment is completely appropriate when a properly supported\r\n  motion sets forth facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient\r\n  manner.&quot;Â  David, 367 S.C. at 250, 626 S.E.2d at 5.Â  &quot;At the\r\n  summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not weigh conflicting\r\n  evidence with respect to a disputed material fact.&quot;Â  S.C. Prop. &amp;\r\n    Cas. Guar. Ass'n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Cupps' Duty of Care to\r\n  Lanier\r\nLanier\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting the Cupps' motion for summary judgment\r\n  on the basis that the duty of care was exclusively that of B&amp;Y, and by\r\n  finding the Cupps did not voluntarily assume the duty to make the premises safe\r\n  by marking the septic tank.Â  Similarly, B&amp;Y contends the trial court erred\r\n  in ruling the Cupps as landowners owed no duty of care to Lanier as a matter of\r\n  law, and granting summary judgment when the evidence supports a finding that\r\n  the Cupps assumed a duty of care by agreeing to mark the septic tank before the\r\n  construction began and then breached that duty of care by failing to mark the\r\n  septic tank.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  case of Sides v. Greenville Hospital System, 362 S.C. 250, 607 S.E.2d\r\n  362 (Ct. App. 2004), discusses a general contractor's and an owner's premises\r\n  liability.Â  Dorothy Sides was injured when she fell while visiting her husband\r\n  at the hospital.Â  Id. at 253, 607 S.E.2d at 363.Â  The hospital was\r\n  undergoing a construction project which included demolition of their current\r\n  parking lot and pouring new concrete.Â  Id.Â  &quot;Sides fell when she\r\n  suddenly stepped off a curb that she could not see in the darkness.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  After the accident, a hospital employee contacted Sides and informed her that\r\n  the hospital had problems with the lighting in the parking lot, and they had\r\n  been meaning to fix the lights.Â  Id.Â  Subsequently, Sides sued the\r\n  hospital, the general contractor, and the subcontractor responsible for site\r\n  preparation and construction.Â  Id. at 253-54, 607 S.E.2d 363-64.Â  All\r\n  three defendants moved for summary judgment.Â  Id. at 254, 607 S.E.2d at\r\n  364.Â  The trial court denied the hospital's motion, but granted the general\r\n  contractor's and subcontractor's motion.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the trial\r\n  court denied Sides's motion to reconsider.Â  Id.Â  In discussing the\r\n  contractors' responsibilities, this court stated: \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  property owner owes an invitee or business visitor the duty of exercising\r\n  reasonable or ordinary care for his safety and is liable for injuries resulting\r\n  from any breach of such duty.Â  The property owner has a duty to warn an invitee\r\n  only of latent or hidden dangers of which the property owner has or should have\r\n  knowledge.Â  A property owner generally does not have a duty to warn others of\r\n  open and obvious conditions, but a landowner may be liable if the landowner\r\n  should have anticipated the resulting harm.\r\n\t&quot;Under a premises\r\n  liability theory, a contractor generally equates to an invitor and assumes the\r\n  same duties that the landowner has, including the duty to warn of dangers or\r\n  defects known to him but unknown to others.&quot;Â  No contractor liability\r\n  exists, however, for injuries resulting from dangers that were obvious or that\r\n  should have been observed in the exercise of reasonable care.Â  &quot;The entire\r\n  basis of an invitor's liability rests upon his superior knowledge of the danger\r\n  that causes the invitee's injuries.&quot;Â  &quot;If that superior knowledge is\r\n  lacking, as when the danger is obvious, the invitor cannot be held\r\n  liable.&quot;\r\n\tBecause\r\n  a contractor's potential liability is based on the notion that it has superior\r\n  knowledge, finding the contractor did not have such superior knowledge\r\n  extinguishes its liability. In this case, [the general contractor] did not have\r\n  superior knowledge of\r\n  the lighting as the hospital admitted it was responsible for the lighting on\r\n  the premises. According to Mr. McMillan, the hospital's Engineering and\r\n  Security divisions maintained the lights. Thus, based on the absence of evidence\r\n  suggesting [the general contractor] had any superior knowledge, the trial court\r\n  did not err in granting summary judgment to [the general contractor].\r\n\tMoreover,\r\n  the hospital, with superior knowledge, may have owed a duty to invitees that\r\n  [the general contractor] did not owe; consequently, the trial court acted\r\n  properly in separately considering the duties owed by the respective parties in\r\n  ruling on the motions for summary judgment. The fact that the trial court\r\n  denied the hospital's motion for summary judgment did not automatically require\r\n  the court to deny the [general contractor's motion].\r\n\r\n\r\n    Id.Â  at 256-57, 607 S.E.2d at 365 (internal citations omitted).\r\nLikewise, another\r\n  construction premises liability decision from this court is Larimore v.\r\n    Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 531 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  In Larimore, Thad Williams hired H.P. Larimore to install vinyl siding\r\n  on his home.Â  Id. at 441, 531 S.E.2d at 537.Â  On the day Larimore was to\r\n  begin the installation, Carolina Power &amp; Light (CP&amp;L) arrived at\r\n  Williams's home to install underground utility lines.Â  Id. at 442, 521\r\n  S.E.2d at 537.Â  CP&amp;L dug a trench to bury the utility lines, and Larimore\r\n  was present and aware of the trench.Â  Id.Â  CP&amp;L filled the trench\r\n  with dirt, and after rainfall, the trench settled several inches.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Four days after CP&amp;L's installation, Larimore stepped onto the dirt\r\n  covering the trench, the trench caved in, and Larimore fractured his hip.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Larimore sued Williams and CP&amp;L.Â  Id.Â  At trial, Williams moved for\r\n  directed verdict, arguing &quot;he was not responsible for warning Larimore of\r\n  an open and obvious condition.&quot;Â  Id. at 442-43, 521 S.E.2d at 537.Â \r\n  The trial court granted Williams's directed verdict motion.Â  Id. at 443,\r\n  521 S.E.2d at 537.Â  Larimore appealed.Â  Id. at 444, 521 S.E.2d 538.Â  In\r\n  discussing Williams's liability, this court opined:\r\n\r\n\tWilliams,\r\n  as the property owner, owes a duty to those on his property commensurate with\r\n  their status. Â South\r\n  Carolina recognizes four classes of persons present on the property of another:\r\n  adult trespassers, invitees, licensees, and children.Â  The level of care owed is dependent upon the class\r\n  of the person present.Â  Because\r\n  Larimore was a business visitor invited to enter or remain on the property for\r\n  a purpose directly or indirectly connected with Williams, Larimore was an\r\n  invitee.\r\n\t&quot;The\r\n  owner of property owes to an invitee or business visitor the duty of exercising\r\n  reasonable or ordinary care for his safety, and is liable for injuries\r\n  resulting from the breach of\r\n  such duty.&quot; The landowner has a duty to warn an invitee\r\n  only of latent or hidden dangers of which the landowner has knowledge or should\r\n  have knowledge. Â THE DEGREE OF CARE\r\n  required is commensurate with the particular circumstances involved, including\r\n  the age and capacity of the invitee.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tUnder a premises liability theory, a contractor\r\n  generally equates to an invitor and assumes the same duties that the landowner\r\n  has, including the duty to warn of dangers or defects known to him but unknown\r\n  to others.Â  A general contractor,\r\n  however, is not liable to an invitee for an injury resulting from a danger that\r\n  was obvious or that should have been observed in the exercise of reasonable\r\n  care. The entire basis of an invitor's liability rests upon his superior\r\n  knowledge of the danger that causes the invitee's injuries. If that superior\r\n  knowledge is lacking, as when the danger is obvious, the invitor cannot be held\r\n  liable. \r\n\tAccordingly,\r\n  Williams, in both his role as landowner and general contractor, owed no duty to\r\n  warn Larimore of the open and obvious defect.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Id. at 444-48, 531 S.E.2d at 538-40 (internal footnotes omitted).\r\nHere,\r\n  we believe the trial court properly granted the Cupps' summary judgment\r\n  motion.Â  The disputed fact of whether Mike Cupp informed Yobs he would mark the\r\n  septic tank location is not a material fact when determining the Cupps'\r\n  liability.Â  The location of the septic tank was a latent danger, and B&amp;Y\r\n  was the Cupps' invitee; therefore, the Cupps had a duty to warn B&amp;Y.Â \r\n  Likewise, B&amp;Y owed the same duty to Lanier, its invitee.Â  We find the Cupps\r\n  discharged their duty to warn their invitee when Mike Cupp and Yobs discussed\r\n  the septic tank location.Â  Lanier suffered injury because its invitor, B&amp;Y,\r\n  failed to perform its duty to warn Lanier of the septic tank location.Â  The\r\n  Cupps, as the landowners in this particular factual scenario who informed their\r\n  general contractor of the latent danger posed by the septic tank, did not owe\r\n  Lanier a duty to warn.Â  Accordingly, in this situation, summary judgment was\r\n  properly granted as a matter of law because no genuine issue of material fact\r\n  exists.\r\nII.&nbsp; Rule 59 Motion\r\nB&amp;Y\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to address whether the evidence\r\n  supports a finding that the Cupps assumed a duty of care by agreeing to mark\r\n  the septic tank before the construction began and then breached their duty by\r\n  failing to mark the septic tank.Â  Similarly, while not a stated issue, Lanier\r\n  argues this was error in their appellate brief.Â  We disagree.\r\nRecently,\r\n  our supreme court held &quot;that in cases applying the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a\r\n  mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary\r\n  judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326,\r\n  ___, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  Here, viewing the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to B&amp;Y and Lanier, there is not a scintilla of evidence to\r\n  suggest the Cupps permanently assumed B&amp;Y's duty to warn Lanier of the\r\n  latent danger.Â  Assuming Mike Cupp initially assumed B&amp;Y's duty to warn the\r\n  subcontractors of the septic tank location, B&amp;Y reassumed the duty during\r\n  the next three months before Lanier's accident.Â  It is undisputed that the\r\n  Cupps did not mark the septic tank location, and that B&amp;Y received other\r\n  subcontractors on the construction site, including a concrete delivery, and\r\n  directed them around the septic tank.Â  Thus, while the Cupps' initial\r\n  assumption of B&amp;Y's duty to warn its invitees of latent dangers is\r\n  questionable, the undisputed evidence proves B&amp;Y reassumed the duty to warn\r\n  its subcontractors by its actions during the three months between Yobs's conversation\r\n  with Mike Cupp and Lanier's accident.Â  Accordingly, summary judgment was\r\n  properly granted in this case because there is no evidence that at the time of\r\n  Lanier's accident the Cupps assumed B&amp;Y's duty to warn its invitor.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4581","title":"Trowell v.

Erwin, both of Blythewood, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Scott Trowell appeals the circuit court's order affirming the\r\n  decision of the State Human Resources Director that his appeal of an internal grievance matter was\r\n  untimely.Â  Trowell asserts the circuit court erred in finding service was perfected upon the Department of\r\n  Public Safety's facsimile of its final agency decision, thereby initiating the\r\n  time frame in which Trowell had to appeal.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nTrowell,\r\n  a South Carolina Highway Patrolman, was suspended without pay for 40 hours and\r\n  reassigned to a different patrol troop and location.Â  An internal investigation\r\n  revealed Trowell had provided false and inaccurate information to a fellow officer\r\n  during an investigation, and had also directed insolent and abusive language\r\n  towards a superior officer amounting to insubordination and improper conduct.Â \r\n  Pursuant to his rights under the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act and the\r\n  employee grievance procedure established by Public Safety,[1] Trowell notified Public Safety of his request to have a Step I Grievance\r\n  Hearing regarding his suspension and relocation.Â  Following consideration of\r\n  the appeal, Trowell's suspension was upheld.Â  \r\nTrowell\r\n  thereafter gave written notice of his desire to have a Step II Grievance Hearing.Â \r\n  Following a second hearing, counsel for Public Safety requested additional time\r\n  to pursue a settlement with Trowell; however, those pursuits were unsuccessful,\r\n  and Public Safety notified Trowell his suspension would be upheld.Â  Notice of\r\n  Public Safety's decision regarding Trowell's Step II Grievance was initially\r\n  sent to Trowell's attorney via facsimile on February 2, 2005, and the cover\r\n  sheet contained a notation explaining the original letter would be sent by\r\n  certified mail.Â  The certified letter advising Trowell of the decision was\r\n  received and signed for on February 7.Â  On February 15, Trowell's attorney\r\n  faxed the State Appeal Form to the Human Resource Management Division of the\r\n  South Carolina Budget and Control Board (Human Resources) indicating his desire\r\n  to appeal the agency's final decision to the Human Resources Director\r\n  (Director).Â  In the appeal, Trowell stated he received the final decision of\r\n  the agency on February 7, 2005. \r\nOn\r\n  March 4, 2005, the Director notified Trowell, via letter, that his appeal was\r\n  untimely because Trowell had failed to file it within ten calendar days of\r\n  receipt of Public Safety's February 2 facsimile, pursuant to section 8-17-330\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â  The Director's letter also noted that\r\n  Trowell's notice of appeal was filed outside of the alternative fifty-five\r\n  calendar days allowed from the date of Trowell's initial Step I Grievance\r\n  filing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-17-330 (Supp. 2008).Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Trowell filed a written request for reconsideration of the Director's denial of\r\n  his appeal, which was denied.Â  Trowell then petitioned the circuit court for\r\n  review. Â Trowell appeals from the circuit court's affirmance of the agency's\r\n  decision. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS[2]\r\nTrowell contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in finding service of Public Safety's letter upholding\r\n  his Step II Grievance was perfected upon facsimile of its final agency\r\n  decision, thereby initiating the time frame in which Trowell had to appeal.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  scope of judicial review in Administrative Procedures Act (APA)[3] cases arising from the final decision of state agencies is governed by section\r\n  1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), which provides:\r\n\r\n\tA party\r\n  who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and\r\n  who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to\r\n  judicial review . . .\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(5)\r\n  The court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to\r\n  the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the\r\n  decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court\r\n  may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have\r\n  been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions,\r\n  or decisions are:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(a) in\r\n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; \r\n\t\t\t(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the\r\n  agency; \r\n\t\t\t(c) made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t\t\t(d) affected by other error of law; \r\n\t\t\t(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n\t\t\t(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse\r\n  of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSection 8-17-330 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) requires that an agency must establish an\r\n  approved employee grievance procedure, and make it available to covered\r\n  employees.Â  As noted above, Public Safety complied with the requirement of\r\n  section 8-17-330.Â  Step III of the employee grievance process, discussed in\r\n  section VIII of Public Safety's adopted procedures, provides an employee may\r\n  appeal the final decision of the agency, and that such an appeal &quot;must be\r\n  in writing and submitted to the State Human Resources Director within ten (10)\r\n  calendar days of receipt of the Final Agency Decision . . . .&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  When an appeal is received pursuant to Step III, the\r\n  Director is tasked with assembling the record from the previous grievance\r\n  hearings, but must first make a determination if the procedures and policies of\r\n  employee grievance process have been appropriately followed to that point.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-17-350 (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  receipt of Trowell's appeal from Public Safety's Step II Grievance Hearing, the\r\n  Director determined Trowell's appeal had been filed outside of the requisite\r\n  ten calendar days from his receipt of the faxed order on February 2.[4]Â \r\n  In his letter denying Trowell's subsequent motion for reconsideration, the\r\n  Director noted the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act is not specific as to\r\n  how the final agency decision must be delivered; therefore, in reliance on that\r\n  silence, the Director determined receipt of the decision could be accomplished\r\n  through hand delivery, facsimile, or mail.Â  Public Safety thus contends that,\r\n  because Trowell's attorney acknowledged receipt of the facsimile on February 2,\r\n  notice was accomplished on that day and not the date the decision was received\r\n  by certified mail.Â  \r\nOrdinarily,\r\n  significant deference is given to the agency's construction and interpretation\r\n  of its employee grievance procedure.Â  Brown v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436,\r\n  440, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003) (citing Brown v. South Carolina Dep't of\r\n    Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002))\r\n  (recognizing courts generally give deference to an administrative agency's\r\n  interpretation of an applicable statute or its own regulation).Â  However, the\r\n  agency's interpretation of its grievance procedure in this case created a rule\r\n  which it had, admittedly, never before employed or sought to enforce.Â \r\n  Moreover, the rule that the time for an appeal began to toll upon service by\r\n  facsimile is not included in any written materials or guidelines available to\r\n  the public or the bar.Â  Trowell's counsel admits the facsimile was received by\r\n  his office on February 2; however, because facsimiles are not ordinarily used\r\n  to accomplish notice of a decision by any department, agency, or court,[5] counsel maintains he did not look at or consider the fax until the certified copy\r\n  of the letter was received by his office on February 7, at which time he began\r\n  the next step of the appeals process.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the agency's interpretation of its service rules was overly harsh in this\r\n  situation.Â  Given the general rule that service cannot be accomplished via\r\n  facsimile, the agency's decision here arbitrarily created a trap for the unwary\r\n  petitioner.Â  As a result, we believe the substantial rights of Trowell were prejudiced\r\n  due to the arbitrary and capricious nature of the agency's interpretation of\r\n  its grievance procedure.Â  Trowell is entitled to a full and fair hearing before\r\n  the State Human Resources Director.[6]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is Â Â \r\nREVERSED\r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Public Safety's employee grievance procedure provides\r\n  an employee with a three-step appeal process:Â  (1) upon written notice from an\r\n  aggrieved, Step I allows the employee and an Agency member to participate in a\r\n  voluntary mediation, or proceed directly to a meeting at which the employee is\r\n  allowed to present his or her position; (2) if the employee is not satisfied\r\n  with the resulting decision, he or she may request a Step II hearing, at which\r\n  time they are permitted to present their side once more, and the Director may\r\n  conduct a fact finding investigation to aid in making his decision; and (3) if\r\n  the employee is still not satisfied with the decision, he or she may appeal to\r\n  the State Director of Human Resources.Â  \r\n[2] Trowell initially asserts it was error for the\r\n  circuit court to make findings of fact, when the facts of the case were not\r\n  properly before the court.Â  Although the circuit court did not delineate the\r\n  facts included in its order as findings of fact, we nevertheless note the\r\n  circuit court's recitation of the factual summary should in no way limit the\r\n  State Employee Grievance Committee's ability to make its own findings of fact\r\n  on remand, in accordance with section 8-17-340 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2008).\r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310 et seq. (2005 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2008).\r\n[4] Trowell did not appeal the Director's determination\r\n  that his appeal was filed outside of the fifty-five calendar days from his\r\n  initial agency grievance; therefore, Trowell's compliance with the ten day\r\n  period is the only issue before us on appeal.Â  \r\n[5] See Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP (&quot;Service . . .\r\n  shall be made by delivering a copy to him or by mailing it to him at his last\r\n  known address . . . .&quot;); Rule 5, SCALJR (&quot;Service shall be made by\r\n  delivery, or by mail to the last known address.&quot;);Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-350 (2005) (providing that under the Administrative Procedures Act, final\r\n  decisions or orders adverse to a party in a contested case must be made in\r\n  writing, and must be delivered either personally or by mail). \r\n[6] Trowell also contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  failing to find either the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the South\r\n  Carolina Administrative Law Judge Rules, or the rules provided in section\r\n  1-23-350 of the Administrative Procedures Act, should apply to every stage of\r\n  the appellate process under the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act, in\r\n  order to ensure consistent applicability of the rules and fairness throughout\r\n  the process.Â  Given our disposition above, we need not address these additional\r\n  contentions.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue\r\n  is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4582","title":"Stecker v.

Plumblee, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.:Â  TALX Corporation (TALX)\r\n  appeals the trial court's grant of Carl Stecker's motion for a preliminary injunction.Â  TALX argues the trial court\r\n    erred in: (1) finding Stecker's declaratory judgment action was an action for\r\n    damages or injunctive and other equitable relief within the meaning of section\r\n    10.9(g) of the parties' agreement; (2) finding the parties' agreement\r\n    prohibited TALX from pursuing its counterclaims in arbitration; and (3) failing\r\n    to give binding effect to two decisions of the arbitration panel. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn October 2004, TALX purchased Net Profit, Inc., a\r\n  solely owned South Carolina company, from Stecker pursuant to an acquisition\r\n  agreement. Â TALX's acquisition agreement with Stecker contained an\r\n  Alternative Dispute Resolution provision under which the parties agreed to\r\n  resolve disputes through arbitration. The agreement contained one exception to\r\n  the arbitration provision regarding claims for indemnification.Â  The exception\r\n  provided that any party could seek damages or injunctive and other equitable\r\n  relief for any dispute related to indemnification either in court or in\r\n  arbitration.Â  \r\nNet Profit provided\r\n  consulting services to businesses and assisted them in obtaining federal tax\r\n  credits.Â  After TALX purchased Net Profit, a number of clients sought refunds\r\n  from Net Profit for tax credits the IRS had disallowed.Â  TALX sought indemnification\r\n  from Stecker for the claims it paid to these clients. These indemnification\r\n  claims became the basis for Stecker's declaratory judgment action and TALX's\r\n  counterclaims in arbitration. Â \r\nIn November 2006, Stecker filed a demand for arbitration\r\n  in Missouri seeking amounts due on the purchase price. Â In December\r\n  2006, Stecker filed this declaratory judgment action in Greenville pursuant to\r\n  sections 15-53-10 to 40 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  In his action,\r\n  Stecker asked the trial court to determine whether TALX was entitled to\r\n  indemnification in accordance with Article IX of the agreement for claims made\r\n  against TALX by third parties. TALX filed counterclaims in the Missouri arbitration\r\n  in January 2007.Â  These counterclaims consisted of the same indemnification\r\n  claims that formed the basis for the declaratory judgment action filed by\r\n  Stecker. \r\nIn July 2007, Stecker filed\r\n  a motion asking the trial court to enjoin TALX from pursuing its defenses and\r\n  counterclaims in the arbitration. The trial court ordered the\r\n  counterclaims stayed and, in the alternative, granted a temporary injunction\r\n  prohibiting the arbitrators from hearing the indemnification claims.Â  This\r\n  appeal arises from the trial court's order finding TALX's counterclaims in\r\n  arbitration were stayed.[1]Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Actions\r\n  for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.&quot;Â  Doe v.

Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 482, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Stecker's\r\n  declaratory judgment action\r\nTALX argues the trial court erred in\r\n  finding Stecker's declaratory judgment action was an action for damages. TALX\r\n  argues section 10.9(g) does not apply to Stecker's declaratory judgment action\r\n  because Stecker's complaint does not seek damages, an injunction, or any other\r\n  equitable relief.Â  TALX contends Stecker's declaratory judgment action is an\r\n  action for construction of a contract and is therefore a legal rather than\r\n  equitable action.Â Â  We agree.Â  \r\nHere, the trial court allowed Stecker's\r\n  declaratory judgment action based on the contract language.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  trial court determined Stecker's declaratory judgment action was a damages\r\n  action and found that because Stecker sought to prevent TALX from recovering\r\n  damages rather than seeking to recover damages from TALX, his claim was not\r\n  excluded from the provisions of Article 10.9(g). \r\nWe find the trial court erred in\r\n  determining Stecker's declaratory judgment action was a damages action.Â  The\r\n  parties' agreement contains a mandatory arbitration clause in section 10.9.Â  However,\r\n  section 10.9(g) of the agreement provides an exception to mandatory arbitration\r\n  when either party has a damages claim.Â  Specifically, 10.9(g) states:\r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding any other provision in\r\n  this Agreement, any Party may seek and obtain damages and injunctive and\r\n  other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without resorting\r\n  to negotiations or arbitration for any Dispute related to [the indemnification\r\n  provisions] of this agreement.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added) \r\nWe agree with TALX's assertion that Stecker's\r\n  declaratory judgment action is an action for construction of a contract and is\r\n  therefore a legal rather than an equitable action.Â  This court has found &quot;[a]\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.&quot; Â Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C.\r\n  407, 410, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456 (Ct. App. 2006). &quot;To make this determination\r\n  we look to the main purpose of the action as determined by the complaint.&quot; Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  his complaint, Stecker sought a declaration from the trial court that he was\r\n  not liable for damages on TALX's indemnification claims. Specifically, Stecker\r\n  asked the trial court to find TALX was not entitled to indemnification because under\r\n  the terms of the agreement there had been no event giving rise to the duty of\r\n  indemnification. Additionally, Stecker based his claim on TALX's failure to give\r\n  proper notice to Stecker under the terms of the agreement before paying the\r\n  claims for which indemnification was sought.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present action, Stecker is not seeking damages.Â  Rather, he is asking the trial\r\n  court to interpret the parties' agreement, which is a question of law.Â  See Silver v. Aabstract Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., 376 S.C. 585, 590, 658\r\n  S.E.2d 539, 541 (Ct. App. 2008) (providing the interpretation of a contract is\r\n  an action at law). Â Â Accordingly, Stecker's filing of a preemptory declaratory\r\n  judgment action did not convert his legal claim into an equitable claim. See Jacobs v. Serv. Merchandise Co., 297 S.C. 123, 127, 375 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988) (&quot;An action which is essentially one at law is not converted\r\n  into an equitable action because it is brought pursuant to the Declaratory\r\n  Judgment Act&quot;).Â  \r\nIt\r\n  appears Stecker is trying to preclude TALX's right to bring its indemnification\r\n  claims in the forum of its choice.Â  However, Stecker was bound by the\r\n  provisions of his agreement with TALX, which required the parties to arbitrate\r\n  all disputes unless the party sought damages or equitable relief. Because\r\n  Stecker did not seek damages or equitable relief in his complaint, his declaratory\r\n  judgment action did not trigger section 10.9(g).Â  Accordingly, the trial court\r\n  erred in finding Stecker's declaratory judgment action was an action for damages\r\n  within the meaning of section 10.9(g) of the parties' agreement.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; TALX's\r\n  counterclaims in arbitration \r\nTALX argues the trial court erred in\r\n  interpreting section 10.9(g) of the parties' agreement to mean TALX is\r\n  prohibited from pursuing its indemnification claims against Stecker in\r\n  arbitration. Based on our ruling above, we agree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Ambiguity in\r\n  trial court's ruling\r\nThere are ambiguities in the trial\r\n  court's order.Â  On one hand, the trial court seems to suggest TALX could pursue\r\n  indemnification through arbitration.Â  Specifically, the trial court found TALX\r\n  would not be harmed if its indemnification counterclaims were stayed pending\r\n  the outcome of the declaratory judgment action. Moreover, the trial court\r\n  determined TALX agreed indemnification provisions could be arbitrated or\r\n  litigated. The trial court further found that &quot;a denial of a stay\r\n  or injunction would rob [Stecker] of [his] bargained-for rights under the\r\n  Acquisition Agreement.&quot; \r\nHowever, other language suggests TALX\r\n  could not pursue indemnification through arbitration.Â  The trial court found\r\n  the parties had &quot;carved out indemnification claims&quot; and that TALX\r\n  wanted to ignore the contract and create a situation where\r\n  &quot;indemnification claims could be subject to two identical adjudications\r\n  before two separate tribunals.&quot; Furthermore, the trial court found section\r\n  10.9(g) was &quot;nonsensical&quot; and subjected the parties to a\r\n  &quot;multiplicity of identical claims.&quot; Because the practical\r\n  effect of the trial court's ruling prohibited TALX from pursuing indemnification\r\n  through arbitration, we specifically address TALX's indemnification remedies\r\n  below. \r\nB.&nbsp; Indemnification\r\n  through arbitration\r\nWe\r\n  find TALX can pursue its indemnification claims against Stecker in the current\r\n  arbitration in Missouri based on our interpretation of the contract.Â  See Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.,Â  353 S.C. 491, 495, 579\r\n  S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003) (&quot;When a contract is unambiguous a court must\r\n  construe its provisions according to the terms the parties used; understood in\r\n  their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.&quot;); see alsoÂ  Ellis v.\r\n    Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994) (&quot;The court's\r\n  duty is to enforce the contract made by the parties regardless of its wisdom or\r\n  folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights\r\n  carefully.&quot;). Based on the clear language of section 10.9(g), TALX could\r\n  either bring an indemnification claim in arbitration or in court.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we believe the trial court erred in finding section 10.9(g) of the partiesâ€™\r\n  agreement prohibited TALX from pursuing its counterclaims in arbitration.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Arbitration\r\n  panel decisions\r\nTALX argues the trial court erred in\r\n  failing to give binding effect to the arbitration panel's rulings that TALX\r\n  could assert its indemnification claims in arbitration. Â Based on our finding\r\n  that TALX can pursue its indemnification claims against Stecker in arbitration,\r\n  we need not address whether the trial court erred in failing to defer to the\r\n  arbitration panel's rulings.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal); see also Dwyer v. Tom\r\n    Jenkins Realty, 289 S.C. 118, 120, 344 S.E.2d 886, 888 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (&quot;Where a decision is based on two grounds, either of which, independent\r\n  of the other, is sufficient to support it, it will not be reversed on appeal\r\n  because one of those grounds is erroneous.&quot;). Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Stecker's\r\n  declaratory judgment action was not an action for damages within the meaning of\r\n  section 10.9(g) of the parties' agreement, and that TALX can pursue its\r\n  indemnification claims in arbitration.Â  Consequently, the trial court erred in staying\r\n  TALX's counterclaims and granting Stecker's motion for preliminary injunction.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court's order is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court has yet to issue a final ruling on\r\n  Stecker's declaratory judgment action.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4583","title":"Jones v.

Â This decision was affirmed by the Coastal\r\n  Zone Management Appellate Panel, which was thereafter affirmed by the circuit\r\n  court. On appeal, appellants Evan and Leslie Jones assert the granting of the dock\r\n  amendment violates various code regulations.Â  They further take issue with\r\n  procedural aspects of the case, contending an initial letter denying the\r\n  amendment was a final decision and that their due process rights were violated.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn December 20, 1999, OCRM approved a dock master plan\r\n  (DMP) for the Rivertowne Subdivision (Rivertowne) in Mount Pleasant, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  The DMP included proposed dock corridors for various properties\r\n  within the subdivision.Â  In August 2001, Moore and his wife purchased lot 39,\r\n  and on July 8, 2004, the Joneses purchased lot 38 in Rivertowne.Â  The DMP\r\n  established the Joneses' dock corridor extended directly to the Wando River\r\n  (Wando), while the Moore's dock corridor extended to a tributary of the Wando. Â The\r\n  Joneses' lot is in two sections, consisting of a pie shaped landward portion\r\n  connected by a bridge to an island, which has a dock on the Wando.Â  Moore's lot\r\n  is similarly shaped to the Jones's landward lot, and its property lines extend\r\n  out partially over the Wando River and partially over marsh and a creek that\r\n  runs off of the Wando.Â  Thus, Moore has waterfront property to the Wando to a\r\n  point.\r\nIn 2002, Moore applied for and received a dock permit\r\n  within the boundaries of the original dock corridor approved in the DMP,\r\n  allowing the construction of a dock to the creek running off the Wando.Â  However,\r\n  after receiving the permit, Moore began to explore the area and discovered it\r\n  was difficult to get his boat to the permitted area unless it was very close to\r\n  high tide.Â  He experienced problems maneuvering his boat in the mouth of the\r\n  creek and even ran aground on high tide because of a large shell bank.Â \r\n  Realizing the difficulty of navigating around the shell bank and that there was\r\n  minimal access available to this area on a day to day basis, in July 2004 Moore\r\n  applied for an amendment to his dock permit, with a new proposed dock corridor\r\n  extending to the Wando.\r\nIn August 2004, the Joneses notified OCRM they\r\n  strongly opposed the proposed amendment submitted by Moore, noting they\r\n  believed the modification would create a significant negative impact on their\r\n  ability to navigate in the adjacent creek, would permanently block their access\r\n  to the tidal creek, and would restrict their use of the waterway.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  the Joneses received a copy of a denial letter dated September 28, 2004, as well\r\n  as a September 29, 2004 memorandum notice to all interested parties that Moore's\r\n  amendment request had been denied.Â  However, on November 23, 2004, DHEC's\r\n  Office of General Counsel sent Moore's attorney a letter indicating OCRM's\r\n  manager of critical area permitting, Curtis Joyner, intended to issue the permit\r\n  requested.Â  The letter noted that before Joyner was able to take any action in\r\n  that regard, notice of a denial letter was mistakenly mailed to the adjacent\r\n  property owners.Â  It further stated the denial letter was only a draft, not\r\n  intended to be the agency's final decision, and it was determined the agency\r\n  could revoke the prior letter and reissue notice of the decision allowing the\r\n  amended permit.Â  On December 22, 2004, the Joneses received a letter from OCRM\r\n  indicating Moore's amended permit authorizing a new dock alignment had been\r\n  approved.\r\nThe Joneses appealed OCRM's decision to the ALC, which\r\n  affirmed the grant of Moore's amended dock permit realigning his walkway to\r\n  provide access to the Wando River, but imposed two additional conditions on the\r\n  permit.[2]Â \r\n  The Joneses thereafter appealed to the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel,\r\n  which found substantial evidence of record to support the ALC and affirmed the\r\n  decision.Â  The Joneses again appealed, and the decision to grant Moore's\r\n  amended permit was thereafter affirmed by the circuit court.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial judge erred in finding 23A S.C.

Dep't of Health &amp;\r\n    Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  In reviewing\r\n  the final decision of the ALJ, the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel sat\r\n  as a quasi-judicial tribunal and was not entitled to make findings of fact.Â  Dorman\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 164, 565 S.E.2d\r\n  119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel could\r\n  only reverse the ALC based on an error of law or if its findings were not\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.Â  Id. Â at 165, 565 S.E.2d at 122.Â  The\r\n  circuit court's review, as well as this court's, was governed by the prior\r\n  version of section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code, which provided\r\n  the court could reverse a decision of an administrative agency if the agency's\r\n  findings or conclusions were:\r\n\r\n\t(a) in violation of constitutional\r\n  or statutory provisions; \r\n\t(b) in excess of the statutory\r\n  authority of the agency; \r\n\t(c) made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d) affected by other error of\r\n  law; \r\n\t(e) clearly erroneous in view of\r\n  the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n\t(f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n  discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).\r\nIn determining whether\r\n  the ALC's decision was supported by substantial evidence, this court need only\r\n  find, looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence from which reasonable\r\n  minds could reach the same conclusion that the ALC reached.Â  DuRant v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704,\r\n  706 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  &quot;The mere possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding from being supported\r\n  by substantial evidence.&quot;Â  Id. Â at 420, 604 S.E.2d at 707. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Violation of Reg. 30-12(A)(2)(n)\r\nThe Joneses first argue the ALC erred in failing to\r\n  find Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) was violated by the amended permit.Â  They argue,\r\n  when considering the definition of navigability as defined in the regulations,\r\n  the case law, and the testimony submitted, the &quot;horseshoe&quot; creek and\r\n  the creek that connects the unnamed tributary to the area of their bridge are\r\n  navigable and cannot be bridged.Â  They further assert the regulations require\r\n  the Moore dock to extend to the first creek that is the shortest distance from\r\n  the Moore property.Â  Accordingly, they contend this regulation precludes\r\n  issuance of the amended permit.\r\nLooking at the regulation in effect at the time of application\r\n  and issuance of the amended permit in this matter, Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n)\r\n  provided in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n\tDocks must generally\r\n  extend to the first navigable creek, within extensions of upland property lines\r\n  or corridor lines, that has a defined channel as evidenced by a significant\r\n  change of grade with the surrounding marsh; or having an established history of\r\n  navigational access or use.Â  A creek with an established history of\r\n  navigational use may also be considered as navigable.Â  Such creeks cannot be\r\n  bridged in order to obtain access to deeper water. . . .Â  In exceptional cases,\r\n  the Department may allow an open water channel to be bridged if current access\r\n  is limited by other man made or natural restrictions or if site-specific\r\n  conditions warrant such a crossing.\r\n\r\n23A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n) (Supp. 2004).\r\nIn determining whether a waterway is navigable, &quot;'[t]he\r\n  true test to be applied is whether a stream inherently and by its nature has\r\n  the capacity for valuable floatage, irrespective of the fact of actual use or\r\n  the extent of such use.'&quot;Â  Hughes v. Nelson, 303 S.C. 102, 105, 399\r\n  S.E.2d 24, 25 (Ct. App. 1990) (quoting State ex rel. Medlock v. South\r\n    Carolina Coastal Council, 289 S.C. 445, 449, 346 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1986)).Â  The\r\n  test of navigability is not whether a waterway is accessible at all times, but\r\n  whether it is accessible at the ordinary stage of the water.Â  Id. at\r\n  106, 399 S.E.2d at 26.Â  \r\nAt the hearing before the ALC, the Joneses presented\r\n  testimony on their use of the smaller tributaries near the bridge connecting\r\n  their highland property to their island from which their dock extended into the\r\n  Wando River.Â  In particular, they testified regarding their use of a &quot;horseshoe&quot;\r\n  shaped tributary off the main creek from the river that they traversed to get\r\n  from their highland property near the bridge out to the larger tributary or out\r\n  to the Wando.Â  Jones testified to numerous times he had navigated in the\r\n  smaller tributaries in his kayak and canoe.Â  He stated he generally launched\r\n  his canoe or kayak from the landward portion of his lot by the bridge to enter\r\n  the tributaries, and would explore the wildlife in the area. He did not launch\r\n  his canoe from his dock in the Wando because the river was too rough, and he\r\n  could only do so on certain days if the water was agreeable.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Jones' son, Justin, testified he had used his smaller, twenty-foot motorized\r\n  boat to retrieve and transport items from the landward portion of the property\r\n  to the dock, navigating all the way up to the bridge on the highland.Â  Justin\r\n  stated he generally waited for the water to &quot;come up nice and high&quot;\r\n  before he would make such a trip, that he would generally go at high tide, and\r\n  while he could not make it at low tide, it was possible to do around mid tide,\r\n  depending on the tide change.Â  In describing his navigation of his motorized\r\n  boat at mid tide, Justin stated he could make the trip if it was a &quot;good\r\n  mid tide.&quot;Â  Jones testified that if a dock walkway was constructed as\r\n  proposed, there was no way it could avoid crossing over the horseshoe, and it\r\n  would block his ability to traverse the horseshoe and get out to the Wando.Â  Both\r\n  Jones and his son believed that a dock positioned in the amended dock corridor\r\n  could only avoid the horseshoe tributary if it crossed over into the Joneses'\r\n  extended property lines.\r\nCurtis Joyner testified that he was OCRM's manager of\r\n  critical area permitting and the ultimate decision of whether to issue a\r\n  critical area permit rested with him.Â  Joyner viewed the area in question at\r\n  the time the agency was considering the DMP for Rivertowne, and he did not\r\n  notice anything in the general vicinity that would constitute a navigable\r\n  creek.Â  In preparation for the hearing in this matter, Joyner made another site\r\n  visit to the area the day before the hearing, his main focus being to view the\r\n  tributaries.Â  Joyner found the tributary next to the bridge was only about a\r\n  foot wide and hardly evidenced any change in grade, if any at all.Â  Joyner\r\n  described this area as a &quot;mud flat&quot; and &quot;flat as a pancake.&quot;Â \r\n  He concluded this area did not qualify as a navigable creek.Â  He further\r\n  testified he viewed the horseshoe tributary from a distance.Â  Joyner described\r\n  this tributary as &quot;very small,&quot; and stated that it did not possess\r\n  much width, and did not &quot;really elevate itself.&quot;Â  He did not believe\r\n  the horseshoe tributary exhibited a significant change in grade.Â  Joyner concluded\r\n  the horseshoe tributary was not a navigable tributary either.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Joyner testified it was feasible for the proposed dock to reach the Wando\r\n  without crossing the horseshoe.Â  And further, while he did not believe the\r\n  proposed dock would have to cross extended property lines, doing so would be\r\n  permissible under the regulations as long as there was no material harm to the\r\n  policies of the regulations.Â  Finally, Joyner testified he was &quot;pretty\r\n  certain&quot; the proposed walkway would not cross over any portion of the horseshoe,\r\n  but assuming he was incorrect about the horseshoe tributary and it did exhibit\r\n  a significant change of grade and the walkway infringed on the tributary, Moore\r\n  would be required to move his walkway over some to avoid the horseshoe.\r\nRespondent Moore testified that he walked the entire\r\n  line of the marsh from his high ground property through the marsh out to the\r\n  Wando.Â  He stated he could construct a walkway to a pier from his high ground\r\n  to the Wando that would cross neither the Joneses' extended property line nor\r\n  the horseshoe tributary.Â  Moore further testified he was amenable to elevating\r\n  any portion of his walkway to accommodate Jones so he would have the ability to\r\n  use his canoe in the area.\r\nAs to navigability, the ALC found the small\r\n  tributaries branching from the main tributary and leading to the Joneses'\r\n  bridge had little if any water in them at low tide, and concurred with OCRM's\r\n  observations that the area next to the bridge was a mud flat and would not be\r\n  considered navigable at mid tide or below by any craft other than boats\r\n  requiring a minimal depth of water such as kayaks or canoes.Â  The ALC similarly\r\n  found the horseshoe was not navigable to any water craft other than kayaks and\r\n  canoes and the tributaries near the bridge and in the horseshoe have no defined\r\n  channels as evidenced by a significant change in grade with the surrounding\r\n  marsh.Â  The ALC noted Jones navigated the tributaries while paddling in craft\r\n  which required no more than a few inches of water, and that Justin's navigation\r\n  of the area occurred around high tide, or what Justin described as &quot;a good\r\n  mid tide.&quot;Â  When weighing the testimony of Jones and his son based on\r\n  their personal observations against the OCRM staff's observations and\r\n  experience in applying Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n), the ALC found the Joneses' evidence\r\n  was not persuasive.Â  The ALC determined the evidence did not demonstrate an\r\n  established history of navigational use, as the use of a canoe or kayak in the\r\n  area for a period of a few months did not constitute an established history of\r\n  navigational use. The ALC also found Justin's limited use of the tributaries\r\n  did not demonstrate an established history of navigational access or use.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  it concluded the proposed dock could be constructed to the Wando without\r\n  violating this regulation's prohibition of bridging navigable creeks.\r\nWe find there is substantial evidence to support the\r\n  finding of the ALC in this regard.Â  The OCRM critical permitting manager\r\n  specifically testified, based on his observations of the area, that neither the\r\n  area next to the Joneses' bridge nor the horseshoe area exhibited a significant\r\n  change in grade.Â  Joyner concluded neither were navigable tributaries.Â  He\r\n  further testified it was feasible for Moore's proposed dock to reach the Wando\r\n  without crossing the horseshoe area, and while he did not believe the proposed\r\n  dock would have to cross extended property lines, doing so would be permissible\r\n  under the regulations as long as there was no material harm to the policies of\r\n  the regulations.Â  Additionally, if it was determined the horseshoe tributary did\r\n  in fact have a significant change of grade so as to be considered navigable and\r\n  the walkway did infringe on the tributary, Moore would be required to move his\r\n  walkway over in order to avoid the horseshoe.Â  We further find substantial\r\n  evidence to support the ALC's finding that Jones' use of a kayak or canoe for a\r\n  limited period of only a few months and Justin's limited use of the tributaries\r\n  in question during high tide or a &quot;good mid tide&quot; did not demonstrate\r\n  an established history of navigational access or use.\r\nIn regard to the regulation's requirement that the\r\n  dock extend to the first navigable creek, the record reveals the amended dock\r\n  permit would allow a 632 foot walkway with a dock accessing the Wando, while\r\n  the original permit was for a 350 foot walkway with a dock on the main creek which\r\n  runs off the Wando.Â  The dock to the creek would clearly be a shorter distance\r\n  than the dock permitted to the Wando.Â  The ALC determined, however, that\r\n  regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) does not require that docks be built to the closest navigable creek.Â  Rather, the court found the most reasonable interpretation of\r\n  this regulation is that the dock must be placed in the first navigable waterway\r\n  it reaches within the alignment of the dock, as long as the alignment complies\r\n  with other regulatory provisions.Â  We agree.\r\nRegulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) does not simply state a dock\r\n  must extend to the first navigable creek, but further provides it must extend\r\n  to such a creek &quot;within extensions of upland property lines or corridor\r\n  lines.&quot;Â  23A S.C.

Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n) (Supp. 2004).Â  Further,\r\n  Joyner stated that his experience was that this particular portion of the\r\n  regulation &quot;speaks [only] to crossing a tributary to get to a larger body&quot;\r\n  of water.Â  He testified that the interpretation that it required one to take\r\n  the &quot;closer shot&quot; had been rejected, and it is only when one must\r\n  cross a navigable creek to get to deep water that the dock must stop at the\r\n  first channel. \r\nThe words of a statute must be given their plain and\r\n  ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\n  expand the statute's operation.Â  Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 276,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 636, 640 (2006).Â  The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to\r\n  ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Â Id.Â  Further, &quot;[t]he\r\n  construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be\r\n  accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent\r\n  compelling reasons.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe regulation in question provides a dock must extend\r\n  to the first navigable creek within extensions of upland property lines or\r\n  corridor lines, not that it must extend to the closest navigable creek.Â  Thus,\r\n  under the plain and ordinary meaning of this regulation, as long as the dock\r\n  extends to the first navigable creek within the permitted alignment, it will\r\n  not run afoul of the regulation.Â  Further, Joyner's testimony reflects the\r\n  agency has construed this regulation to require that a dock not be allowed to\r\n  cross a navigable creek within a dock alignment and rejected that a dock must\r\n  be placed at the closest navigable creek to the property.Â  We find no\r\n  compelling reason to overrule this construction by the agency.Â  \r\nII. Violation\r\n  of Reg. 30-12(A)(2)(c)\r\nThe Joneses\r\n  argue &quot;the dock size and extension does not comply with Regulation\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(c).&quot;Â  This section, effective at the time of this case,\r\n  provided:Â  &quot;The size and extension of a dock or pier must be limited to\r\n  that which is reasonable for the intended use.&quot;Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(c) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nUnder the\r\n  original permit, the dock was allowed to be 120 square feet. Â Under the amended\r\n  permit, the dock can be 600 square feet.Â  The Joneses argue the original permit\r\n  was sufficient for the intended use and that Moore's property is not in fact\r\n  riverfront property.Â  They contend this fact is evidenced by the substantial\r\n  price difference between the Moore lot and their own.Â  Although Moore may have\r\n  paid considerably less for his lot, there is substantial evidence in the record\r\n  that Moore's property lines extend out partially over the Wando River.Â \r\n  According to Mary Theresa Rogers with OCRM, there is no question that Moore has\r\n  waterfront property to a point to the Wando River.Â  As the ALC found, there is\r\n  no evidence that the proposed dock's size is unreasonable for the Wando River.Â \r\n  Accordingly we find substantial evidence supports the ALC's finding that the\r\n  proposed dock does not violate Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(c). \r\nIII. Violation of Reg. 30-12(A)(2)(d)\r\nThe Joneses next contend the proposed dock is in violation\r\n  of Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(d) which, at the pertinent time, provided &quot;[d]ocks\r\n  and piers should use the least environmentally damaging alignment.&quot; Â 23A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(d) (Supp. 2004). Â Although they acknowledge\r\n  that a longer walkway is not necessarily more environmentally damaging, they\r\n  summarily assert &quot;that the position that uses available access to the\r\n  creek while preserving the navigation for the public is less impactful to the\r\n  environment.&quot;Â  The Joneses cite no case law nor point to any testimony in\r\n  the record to support this position.Â  Indeed, the record establishes that OCRM\r\n  has become concerned with the impact of docks on small tidal creeks because of\r\n  the boating activity attendant to such docks, resulting in &quot;disturbing\r\n  activity&quot; to the highly productive fishery habitats.Â  Thus, the impact of\r\n  a dock on a smaller tributary is greater than that on a larger body of water\r\n  such as the Wando.Â  Accordingly, this portion of the regulations is not limited\r\n  to the length of the walkway but can include consideration of the impact on a\r\n  small tributary versus a larger body of water.Â  OCRM therefore has been trying\r\n  to &quot;get out of the business of issuing [permits for] docks in very small\r\n  creeks.&quot;Â  Based on the foregoing, we find substantial evidence exists to\r\n  support the ALC's finding that, at a minimum, the amended dock follows an\r\n  alignment that is no more environmentally damaging than the original alignment,\r\n  and &quot;since a dock in the Wando River will not create the adverse impact on\r\n  aquatic life as would the smaller dock in the tributary, it will have less of a\r\n  detrimental impact upon the environment.&quot;\r\nIV.&nbsp; Violation of Reg. 30-12(A)(2)(e)\r\nThe Joneses also assert a violation of Regulation\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(e), which provided as follows:\r\n\r\n\tAll\r\n  applications for docks and piers should accurately illustrate the alignment of\r\n  property boundaries with adjacent owners and show the distance of the proposed\r\n  dock from such extended property boundaries.Â  For the purpose of this section,\r\n  the extension of these boundaries will be an extension of the high ground\r\n  property line.Â  The Department may consider an alternative alignment if site\r\n  specific characteristics warrant or in the case of dock master plans, when\r\n  appropriate.\r\n\r\n23A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(e) (Supp. 2004).Â  Specifically, they argue the\r\n  dock application failed to accurately demonstrate the location of the dock in\r\n  relation to navigable creeks or their property lines, and without information\r\n  as to the distance of the pierhead from the mouth of the tributary, the\r\n  distance of the proposed dock from their dock, and the location of the walkway,\r\n  it was impossible to determine exactly where the proposed structure would be\r\n  located.\r\nIn his application for the amended permit, Moore provided\r\n  documents including a survey reflecting both the existing dock corridor as well\r\n  as the proposed new dock corridor.Â  The proposed dock corridor was fifty feet\r\n  in width and showed an additional twenty foot buffer between the fifty foot\r\n  wide corridor and the Joneses' extended property line.Â  It reflected a four\r\n  foot by 632 foot walkway connected to a twenty foot by twenty foot covered\r\n  pierhead, with a ten by twenty foot floating dock attached to the pierhead by\r\n  means of a four by twenty foot gangway.Â  Curtis Joyner testified he could look\r\n  at the submitted documents and determine the location of the pierhead as &quot;right\r\n  up the middle&quot; of the corridor.Â  When asked if he knew where the corridor\r\n  would actually be on the ground he stated, &quot;there are coverable bearings\r\n  and distances on [the documents]&quot; and he thought they &quot;could\r\n  certainly put it in that field.&quot;Â  When asked if he could &quot;say with a\r\n  degree of certainty Â . . . exactly where the walkway is going to go, or where\r\n  the pierhead is going to be located,&quot; Joyner replied, &quot;yes.&quot;Â \r\n  Joyner further testified that the survey submitted with the amendment request\r\n  reflected a measurement of twenty feet between the dock corridor and the edge\r\n  of the Joneses' island, and in looking at the survey, he could determine the\r\n  location of the corridor on an aerial photograph of the area that was admitted\r\n  into evidence.Â  Finally, when asked why OCRM had not required a plat showing\r\n  the exact location of the pierhead and walkway, Joyner stated they &quot;felt\r\n  pretty comfortable with what [they] had in the application.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n  Moore testified concerning various measurements and the proposed alignment from\r\n  his property to the Wando.Â  He determined his pierhead would be about twenty\r\n  feet from the mouth of the tributary.Â  \r\nA\r\n  review of the submitted survey documents, along with the testimony of Joyner\r\n  and Moore, convinces us the application was sufficient to accurately illustrate\r\n  the alignment of Moore's property boundaries with that of the Joneses' and show\r\n  the distance of Moore's proposed dock from the extended property boundaries.Â  Further,\r\n  there is evidence of the distance of the proposed pierhead from the mouth of\r\n  the tributary in question and the location of the walkway.Â  Additionally, it\r\n  does not appear the Joneses raised any issue concerning the proximity of the\r\n  proposed Moore dock to the Joneses' existing dock, and a review of the record\r\n  before us does not indicate any problems associated with the proximity of the\r\n  two docks.Â  Also, as noted by the ALC, one of the conditions of the permit is\r\n  that Moore stake the location in the field and have the location of the walkway\r\n  and pier approved by OCRM prior to construction.Â  Thus, this requirement will\r\n  insure the pier and floating dock are located in accordance with the amended\r\n  permit and in keeping with OCRM's regulations.Â  Finally, one of the additional\r\n  conditions placed on the amended permit by the ALC is that the location of the\r\n  pier, as shown by staking in the field prior to construction, may not be closer\r\n  than twenty feet to the mouth of the tributary, and if the floating dock is\r\n  closer than twenty feet to the mouth of the tributary, the floating dock would\r\n  have to be relocated to the upstream side of the pier or in front of the pier.Â Â Â Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Violation of Reg. 30-12(A)(2)(h)\r\nThe Joneses argue the ALC erred in\r\n  holding the dock alignment did not violate Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(h).Â  This\r\n  regulation provided in part:\r\n\r\n\tDevelopers of subdivisions and multiple family dwellings are\r\n  encouraged to develop plans which include joint-use docks and/or community\r\n  docks at the time of required dock master plans. Â Dock corridors on the\r\n  approved Dock Master Plan must be shown with bearings or State Plane\r\n  Coordinates on a recordable subdivision plat for the development, and recorded\r\n  in the appropriate County Office of Deeds. Â Subsequent re-surveys or\r\n  modifications to lots shall reference the dock corridors on the recorded\r\n  subdivision plat. Reference to this DMP must be given in all contracts for lot\r\n  sales. . . .\r\n\r\n23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12-(A)(2)(h) (Supp. 2004).\r\nWe fail to see how the permit amendment violates\r\n  this regulation, which pertains to the creation and distribution of a DMP.\r\nThe Joneses additionally argue\r\n  Moore should not be allowed to build a dock outside of the corridor that was\r\n  set in the original DMP.Â  Although the Joneses acknowledge the DMP has in fact\r\n  been amended several times, they assert amendment is not warranted in this\r\n  case.\r\nA DMP is not set in stone and\r\n  beyond amendment.Â  In his letter approving the original DMP, Curtis Joyner\r\n  cautioned that the plan was conceptual and was advisory only.Â  The letter,\r\n  which apparently follows the language of the Coastal Zone Management Plan\r\n  Document, provided:Â  &quot;This master plan shall be presumed to take\r\n  precedence over applications inconsistent with this plan unless new information\r\n  is revealed in an application to address and overcome the concerns identified [in\r\n  the dock master plan].&quot;Â  In addition, OCRM may consider &quot;an alternate\r\n  alignment if site specific characteristics warrant or in the case of dock\r\n  master plans, when appropriate.&quot;Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(e)\r\n  (Supp. 2004).\r\nJoyner testified that the corridors\r\n  for the DMP were chosen by the developer, not the agency.Â  The record includes\r\n  evidence that after Moore received his original permit for the location set\r\n  forth in the DMP, he experienced difficulty in getting his boat to the permitted\r\n  area unless it was very close to high tide.Â  He even ran aground on high tide\r\n  because of a large shell bank.Â  In addition, as noted above, OCRM has changed\r\n  its policy and has been trying to &quot;get out of the business&quot; of\r\n  issuing permits to docks in such small creeks because of the resulting\r\n  disturbance to the highly productive fishery habitats docks cause on small\r\n  tidal creeks.Â  Accordingly, we find substantial evidence supports the ALC's\r\n  finding that the agency's use of an alternative alignment in the amended permit\r\n  was warranted under the facts of this case.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Violation of Reg. 30-11(B)(10)\r\nThe Joneses next assert the ALC erred in finding that Regulation\r\n  30-11(B)(10) was not violated because the proposed dock affects their use and\r\n  enjoyment as adjoining land owners. Â In particular, they argue it would affect\r\n  Jones' enjoyment because he liked to put his kayak and canoe in the tidal areas\r\n  and marshland, and allowing the proposed dock would block his navigation and\r\n  access. Â They likewise assert the proposed dock would negatively impact their\r\n  ability to get supplies to their dock as it would prevent their son from\r\n  navigating his powerboat from their dock on the Wando to the edge of their lot,\r\n  in order to transport the heavy supplies.Â  Finally, they argue, while they do\r\n  not have a prescriptive right to an unobstructed view of the marsh, it is a\r\n  factor to be considered pursuant to this regulation. Â Â \r\nSection 48-39-150(A)(10) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  provides, in determining whether to approve or deny a permit application, OCRM\r\n  is to base its decision on the individual merits of each application, the\r\n  policies specified in South Carolina Code sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30, and\r\n  specified statutory general considerations, including &quot;[t]he extent to\r\n  which the proposed use could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150(A)(10) (2008).Â  South Carolina Code of Regulations\r\n  section 30-11(B) includes the same general considerations as section 48-39-150\r\n  of the Code, with Regulation 30-11(B)(10) likewise providing OCRM must consider\r\n  &quot;[t]he extent to which the proposed use could affect the value and\r\n  enjoyment of adjacent owners.&quot; Â 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 30-11(B)(10)\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  &quot;After considering the views of interested agencies, local\r\n  governments and persons, and after evaluation of biological and economic\r\n  considerations, if the department finds that the application is not contrary to\r\n  the policies specified in this chapter, it shall issue to the applicant a\r\n  permit.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150(B) (2008).\r\nFirst, as previously noted, there is substantial evidence\r\n  of record the proposed walkway will not cross any creeks considered navigable.Â \r\n  While the Joneses may very well have been able to navigate though the smaller tributaries\r\n  at higher water levels to their highland near the bridge leading to their\r\n  island, some of this area has been described at times as a mud flat and as\r\n  being &quot;flat as a pancake.&quot;Â  While the Joneses may very well have been\r\n  able to navigate through these tributaries at certain times, this alone does\r\n  not make the tributaries navigable.Â  In fact, there is testimony that on a\r\n  spring tide, full moon tide, or even simply a high tide, one could navigate\r\n  some type of watercraft in the majority of the marsh area, not just the small\r\n  tributaries.Â  Further, especially in light of the requirement that the proposed\r\n  walkway be elevated to five feet above mean high water, it clearly will not\r\n  restrict the Joneses' access by kayak or canoe to the smaller tributaries.Â  Additionally,\r\n  we agree with the ALC that Justin might also be able to maneuver his power boat\r\n  under the raised walkway and, even assuming he could not, this limitation is\r\n  more reflective of a lack of convenience than an inability to use the Joneses'\r\n  property, as the amended permit will not impact their deep water access from\r\n  their dock off their island.Â  Finally, at the time of the hearing the Joneses\r\n  had not even built a home on their property, and there is no evidence\r\n  whatsoever that the amended permit would in any way obstruct the Joneses' view.Â \r\n  As noted by the ALC, the extent to which the proposed use could affect the\r\n  value and enjoyment of the adjacent landowners is but one of many factors to\r\n  consider.Â  We find substantial evidence of record supports the ALC's finding\r\n  that the impact on the Joneses' use and enjoyment of their property is\r\n  outweighed by the justification for granting the amended permit. Â Â Â Â  \r\nVII.&nbsp; Due Process\r\nThe Joneses also contend the ALC erred in ruling their due\r\n  process rights were not violated in this matter.Â  They complain that notice of\r\n  the initial denial of the amended permit was sent to them, and two months later\r\n  a letter was sent only to Moore's agent indicating the denial was a mistake and\r\n  the permit was issued shortly thereafter.Â  They argue OCRM had no authority to\r\n  change its publicly noticed decision to deny the amendment with &quot;no\r\n  re-application, no notice and no procedure other than simply issuing the\r\n  approval.&quot;Â  The Joneses assert this lack of notice constitutes a violation\r\n  of due process.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn considering a similar issue in a dock permitting case,\r\n  this court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\t&quot;Procedural due\r\n  process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals\r\n  of liberty or property interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause\r\n  of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.&quot;Â Â  \r\n\tKurschner v. City of Camden Planning Comm'n, 376 S.C. 165, 171, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 346, 350 (2008).Â  &quot;Due process requires (1) adequate notice; (2)\r\n  adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the right to introduce evidence; and\r\n  (4) the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.&quot;Â  Clear Channel\r\n    Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 372 S.C. 230, 235, 642 S.E.2d 565, 567\r\n  (2007).Â  Procedural due process requirements are not technical, and no\r\n  particular form of procedure is necessary.Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical\r\n    Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 485, 636 S.E.2d 598, 615 (2006).Â  Rather,\r\n  due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\r\n  particular situation demands.Â  Id. The fundamental requirement of due\r\n  process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful\r\n  manner.Â  S.C. Dep't. of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481\r\n  S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997).Â  To prevail on a claim of denial of due process, there\r\n  must be a showing of substantial prejudice.Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C.\r\n    Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 435, 319 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1984).\r\n\r\nOlson\r\n  v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 379 S.C. 57, 68-69, 663\r\n  S.E.2d 497, 503-04 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  In Olson, we found no violation of\r\n  the adjoining landowners' due process rights where they failed to receive\r\n  direct notice of a dock permit amendment application considered by OCRM.Â \r\n  Specifically, we noted the adjoining landowners appealed the agency's decision\r\n  to issue the amended permit one month after it was issued, a full hearing was\r\n  held before the ALC where the adjoining land owners challenged the permit, and\r\n  the landowners participated extensively in the hearing, eliciting testimony,\r\n  presenting evidence, and confronting witnesses.Â  Id.Â  As with the\r\n  adjoining landowners in the Olson case, the Joneses have likewise\r\n  participated extensively in the hearing, thus receiving an opportunity to be\r\n  heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.Â  Furthermore, as in Olson,\r\n  no prejudice resulted to the Joneses as they received sufficient notice of the\r\n  actions of OCRM such that they were able to obtain a hearing before the ALC\r\n  providing them the opportunities required by due process.Â  Id. Â at 69,\r\n  663 S.E.2d at 504.Â  Accordingly, the Joneses' due process argument also fails.\r\nVIII.&nbsp; Appeal of Dock Master Plan decision of March 9, 2004\r\nThe Joneses next assert the ALC erred in finding the DMP\r\n  was not violated.Â  In making this argument, they do not explain how the ALC\r\n  erred, but simply summarily contend there is no justifiable reason to move the\r\n  corridor previously approved in the DMP.[3]Â \r\n  We find the Joneses have abandoned this issue on appeal as their argument is\r\n  conclusory and unsupported by authority.Â  See Bennett v. Investors\r\n    Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 579, 635 S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting\r\n  an issue is abandoned on appeal when the appellant fails to cite any supporting\r\n  authority for his position and makes only conclusory arguments); First Sav.\r\n    Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (deeming an\r\n  issue abandoned because the appellant failed to provide pertinent argument or\r\n  supporting authority).  Â \r\nIX.&nbsp; Finality of OCRM decision\r\nThe Joneses argue that when OCRM\r\n  issued a letter in September of 2004 stating Moore's amendment request was\r\n  denied, this operated as a final agency decision.Â  They assert that when Moore\r\n  failed to appeal the decision to the ALC within thirty days as provided by Rule\r\n  11, SCRALC, this decision became final and OCRM was without authority to\r\n  reverse its decision.\r\nCurtis Joyner testified that when\r\n  he was considering Moore's permit amendment, he was undecided on what he was\r\n  going to do so he drafted both a denial letter and an amendment letter. Â Moore's\r\n  attorney contacted him and asked for him to refrain from making a decision and\r\n  Joyner agreed to a delay.Â  The denial letter, however, was mailed out\r\n  inadvertently.Â  OCRM's Office of General Counsel sent a letter to Moore's\r\n  attorney explaining that although Joyner intended to issue the permit to Moore,\r\n  a notice of denial letter was mistakenly mailed to the adjacent property\r\n  owners.Â  The General Counsel stated, &quot;This denial letter was a draft and\r\n  not intended as the agency's final administrative decision in this case.&quot;\r\nIt is evident from the record that the denial letter\r\n  sent to the Joneses in September of 2004 was merely a draft and never was\r\n  intended to constitute a final agency decision. Â Furthermore, as the ALC found,\r\n  an agency may reconsider its decision when there is justification and good\r\n  cause, which includes mistake.Â  Bennett v. City of Clemson, 293 S.C. 64,\r\n  66-67, 358 S.E.2d 707, 708-09 (1987).Â  Thus, under Bennett, OCRM may\r\n  reconsider a decision that was based on a mistake.Â  Accordingly, we hold OCRM\r\n  acted within its authority in issuing the permit amendment approval in December\r\n  2004.\r\nX.&nbsp; Circuit Court decision\r\nFinally, the Joneses contend the circuit court erred &quot;in\r\n  finding there was no error of law in which to reverse the decision of [the\r\n  ALC],&quot; and that the arguments made on appeal demonstrate numerous errors.Â  \r\nAs noted above, we believe there is substantial evidence of\r\n  record to support the findings of the ALC and discern no errors of law\r\n  committed by the ALC.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the decision of the ALC is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J.,\r\n  concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] These conditions included (1) that the walkway\r\n  to the dock be elevated to five feet above mean high water at the point where\r\n  it intersects with the area of marsh leading from the Joneses' bridge to the\r\n  tributary and (2) the location of the pier, as shown by staking in the field\r\n  prior to construction, may not be closer than twenty feet to the mouth of the\r\n  tributary, and if the floating dock was closer than twenty feet to the mouth of\r\n  the tributary, the floating dock would be relocated to the upstream side of the\r\n  pier or in front of the pier.\r\n[3] The Joneses spend the majority of their short\r\n  argument on this issue maintaining this is a final agency decision which is\r\n  contestable based upon a letter from OCRM dated March 9, 2004 regarding a\r\n  previously requested revision of the DMP as related to lot 38.Â  The record\r\n  clearly demonstrates, however, that the ALC sustained Moore's hearsay objection\r\n  to the document and admitted it solely as &quot;evidence of what is in the\r\n  Department's file.&quot;Â  Accordingly, this letter is not proper evidence\r\n  before this court for consideration in the manner the Joneses propose.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4584","title":"State v.

Elliott, all,\r\n  of Columbia; and Solicitor Kevin S. Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In\r\n  this criminal case, Marion Wayne Oglesby argues the trial court erred in\r\n  refusing to suppress evidence.Â  We affirm. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nA confidential informant (the CI) met with law enforcement\r\n  officers in Clover, South Carolina for the purpose of making a controlled\r\n  purchase of crack cocaine from Oglesby.Â  The CI called Oglesby to purchase\r\n  fifty dollars worth of crack cocaine.Â  An electronic listening device (the\r\n  wire) was inserted in the lining of the CI's purse.Â  The CI and Oglesby met at\r\n  a location within half a mile of a community park.Â  The CI gave Oglesby fifty\r\n  dollars, and Oglesby gave the CI 0.41 grams of crack cocaine.Â  Oglesby was\r\n  charged with distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine\r\n  within the proximity of a public park or playground.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, the State introduced the recording recovered\r\n  from the wire.Â  Oglesby objected to the entire recording, arguing segments of\r\n  the recording were inaudible and the audible portions could be taken out of\r\n  context.Â  The trial court admitted the recording into evidence and allowed the\r\n  jury to hear it.Â  Oglesby was found guilty of both charges.Â  The trial court\r\n  sentenced Oglesby to twelve years imprisonment for each charge, the sentences\r\n  to run concurrent.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nGenerally, the conduct of a\r\n  criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the trial court, and\r\n  this court will not interfere unless it clearly appears the rights of the\r\n  complaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way.Â  State v. Bridges,\r\n  278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982).Â  As such, an appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only, and we are bound by the trial court's\r\n  factual determinations unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOglesby\r\n  contends the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion to\r\n  suppress the recording in violation of his right to completeness based on Rule\r\n  106, SCRE.Â  Specifically, Oglesby\r\n  argues the whole recording, including the audible and inaudible portions,\r\n  should have been excluded.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nInitially,\r\n  the State argues Oglesby's argument is not preserved for review.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  During the pretrial hearing, Oglesby asked the trial court to exclude the\r\n  recording because the audible portions could be taken out of context due to the\r\n  fact the other portions of the recording were inaudible.Â  Rule 106, SCRE, states, &quot;When a . . .\r\n  recorded statement, or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party\r\n  may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other . . .\r\n  recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously\r\n  with it.&quot;Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has explained that Rule 106 is based\r\n  on the rule of completeness and attempts to avoid the unfairness inherent in\r\n  the misleading impression created by taking matters out of context.Â  State\r\n    v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 379, 605 S.E.2d 522, 525 (2004).Â  As such,\r\n  Oglesby raised this ground to the trial court even though he failed to\r\n  specifically cite to Rule 106, SCRE.Â  See Pryor v. Nw. Apartments, Ltd., 321 S.C. 524,\r\n  528 n.2, 469 S.E.2d 630, 633 n.2 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding an issue preserved\r\n  when the trial court implicitly ruled on and rejected the respondent's\r\n  argument).Â  The argument was raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court, and we consider it preserved for review.Â  State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (&quot;In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review,\r\n  it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial [court]. Â Issues not raised\r\n  and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.&quot;).Â  Having\r\n  determined the issue is properly before us, we now turn to the merits of\r\n  Oglesby's argument. \r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 577, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007).Â  To constitute\r\n  an abuse of discretion, the conclusions of the trial court must lack\r\n  evidentiary support or be controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Additionally, the admission of improper evidence is deemed harmless if it is\r\n  merely cumulative to other evidence.Â  State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324,\r\n  329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978). \r\nWhen interpreting a court rule, an appellate court applies the\r\n  same rules of construction used in interpreting statutes.Â  State v. Brown,\r\n  344 S.C. 302, 307, 543 S.E.2d 568, 570 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Thus, the language of\r\n  a rule must be given its plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the rule.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs it relates to this case, Rule 106, SCRE, stands for the\r\n  proposition that when a part of a recorded statement is introduced, the\r\n  opposing party may require the admission of other portions to ensure the\r\n  partial statements are not taken out of context.Â  Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C.\r\n  at 379, 605 S.E.2d at 525.Â  However, only that portion of the remainder of any\r\n  statement which explains or clarifies the previously admitted portion should be\r\n  allowed into evidence.Â  Id.Â  Rule 106, SCRE, seeks to avoid the\r\n  unfairness inherent in the misleading impression created by taking a\r\n  conversation out of context.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, pursuant to Rule 106, SCRE, Oglesby was\r\n  entitled to introduce the remainder of the recording so long as it was relevant\r\n  to the portions of the recording the State introduced.Â  Oglesby was not\r\n  precluded from explaining the context of the recording.Â  Rather, Oglesby argued\r\n  the entire recording should be suppressed because of certain inaudible\r\n  portions.Â  According to Oglesby's reasoning, any time a portion of a recording\r\n  is inaudible due to any interference, the entire recording should be excluded\r\n  despite the quality of the remaining portion of the recording.Â  We do not\r\n  believe this was the purpose of Rule 106, SCRE.Â  See U.S. v. Stone,\r\n  960 F.2d 426, 436 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding poor quality and partial\r\n  unintelligibility do not render recordings from an electronic listening device between an\r\n  undercover government agent and a defendant inadmissible unless the\r\n  unintelligible portions are so substantial as to render the recording as a\r\n  whole untrustworthy).[1] Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â  \r\nSHORT\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Two other issues were raised by Oglesby in his brief but\r\n  were abandoned at oral arguments; thus, we do not address them.Â  See Wright\r\n    v. Strickland, 306 S.C. 187, 188, 410 S.E.2d 596, 597 (Ct. App. 2001) (not\r\n  addressing an issue which was abandoned at oral arguments).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4585","title":"Spence v.

(collectively Wingate) commenced legal representation\r\n  of Wife.Â  The purpose of the representation was to negotiate an agreement between\r\n  Wife and the four sons of her husband, Congressman Floyd W. Spence, concerning\r\n  the division of Spence's probate estate.Â  Wife and Spence's sons entered into\r\n  an agreement on August 15, 2001.Â  During the course of Wingate's representation\r\n  of Wife, she consulted with Wingate concerning her husband's Federal Group Life\r\n  Insurance Policy (the Policy).Â  On August 16, 2001, Spence died.Â  Either in\r\n  mid-August or early September, Wingate became the attorney for Spence's\r\n  estate.Â  \r\nSpence had named each of his four sons and Wife as equal\r\n  beneficiaries under the Policy in 1988.Â  However, prior to his death, Spence attempted\r\n  to change the named beneficiaries to Wife only.Â  After Spence died, the Members\r\n  Services Office of the United States House of Representatives determined the benefits\r\n  of the Policy should be paid equally to Wife and the four sons, and payment was\r\n  made accordingly.Â  \r\nWife brought an action against Wingate alleging, among other\r\n  things, that he breached his fiduciary duty to her by failing to advise her to obtain\r\n  another attorney, or in the alternative, by failing to file a declaratory\r\n  judgment action on her behalf concerning the Policy.Â  The circuit court granted\r\n  Wingate's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether Wingate owed a\r\n  fiduciary duty to Wife regarding the Policy.Â  The court based its ruling on the\r\n  fact that Wingate, as attorney for the estate, did not owe a fiduciary duty to Wife\r\n  as a beneficiary of the estate.Â  Wife appeals this determination.Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment should be granted when &quot;the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 56(c).Â  Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether\r\n  Wingate breached a fiduciary duty owed to her based on Wingate's representation\r\n  of Wife in a prior related matter.[2]Â \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\n&quot;A fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust and\r\n  confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.&quot;Â  Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 250, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n  &quot;An attorney/client relationship is by nature a fiduciary one.&quot;Â  Hotz\r\n    v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 230, 403 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1991).Â  &quot;One\r\n  standing in a fiduciary relationship with another is subject to liability to\r\n  the other for harm resulting from a breach of duty imposed by the relation.&quot;Â  Smith v. Hastie, 367 S.C. 410, 417, 626 S.E.2d 13, 17 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that Wingate represented Wife while\r\n  negotiating an agreement between her and Spence's sons regarding the probate\r\n  estate.Â  During that representation, Wife alleges she informed Wingate of her\r\n  status as sole beneficiary under the Policy.Â  Only days after negotiating on\r\n  behalf of Wife, Wingate assumed the responsibilities of attorney for Spence's\r\n  estate; however, Wife alleges Wingate never severed their attorney-client relationship.Â \r\n  In fact, Wife claims that when Wingate informed her he was going to be the\r\n  attorney for her husband's estate, he told her that she no longer needed an\r\n  attorney.Â  Moreover, at a subsequent family meeting, Wife maintains Wingate\r\n  suggested she give Spence's sons the entire amount due under the Policy,\r\n  despite his knowledge that Spence had designated her as the sole beneficiary.Â \r\n  Upon hearing this suggestion, Wife alleges she asked Wingate &quot;to put his hat\r\n  back on as [her] attorney and help [her].&quot;Â  According to Wife, Wingate\r\n  refused to assist her.Â  \r\nAccepting Wife's allegations as true, as we must when\r\n  reviewing an order granting summary judgment, a factual issue exists regarding\r\n  what if any fiduciary duties were owed to Wife, and whether these duties were\r\n  breached. Â See Hotz, 304 S.C. at 230, 403 S.E.2d at 637.Â  Duties to\r\n  a former client on a related matter are separate and distinct from any duties\r\n  arising from Wingate's representation of the estate; therefore, the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding section 62-1-109 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007)\r\n  absolved Wingate of any duty he owed to Wife.Â  See Rule 1.9(a), RPC, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR (&quot;A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter\r\n  shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially\r\n  related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the\r\n  interests of the former client unless the former client consents after\r\n  consultation.&quot;).Â  While a jury may ultimately find Wingate committed no\r\n  wrongdoing, the circuit court erred in making that determination as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  As a result, we find Wife's allegations sufficient to survive summary\r\n  judgment.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.Â Â Â  \r\nTHOMAS, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Based on our standard of review, the following facts\r\n  are recited in a light most favorable to Wife.Â  See Osborne v. Adams,\r\n  346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001) (explaining evidence must be viewed\r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party when ruling on a motion for\r\n  summary judgment).Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] This court initially held Wife's contention\r\n  unpreserved for review, but was reversed upon grant of certiorari by the\r\n  supreme court.Â  See Spence v. Wingate, 378 S.C. 486, 663 S.E.2d\r\n  70 (Ct. App. 2008), reversed, 381 S.C. 487, 674 S.E.2d 169 (2009).Â \r\n  Therefore, we will now address the merits of Wife's arguments.\r\n[3] We note Wife's allegations also support damages\r\n  caused by Wingate's breach of fiduciary duty. Â Specifically, Wife claims that\r\n  as a result of Wingate's breach, the insurance benefits were divided five ways,\r\n  among Wife and her husband's four sons, instead of being paid solely to her.Â \r\n  Wife further claims that had Wingate not breached this fiduciary duty, and\r\n  either helped her file a declaratory judgment or advised her to hire another attorney,\r\n  she would not have suffered these damages. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4586","title":"Marichris, LLC v.

Scheer to purchase the property for $2,400,000.00.Â  The parties\r\n  initially discussed MariChris having a 37.5% interest in the property and Rod\r\n  would have a 62.5% interest.Â  Their financial contributions would be in\r\n  proportion to their ownership interests with MariChris providing $900,000\r\n  obtained in a sale of property on Hall Road on Awendaw (Hall Road Property).Â  Rod\r\n  was to provide $1,500,000.00 from the sale of other properties.Â  The parties\r\n  also discussed each having a 50% interest with proportionate contributions.Â  In\r\n  addition, Thomas would be responsible for the work on the infrastructure to\r\n  develop a subdivision on the Property.Â Â Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to closing on the Scheer contract, the parties decided to &quot;flip&quot; the\r\n  property by selling it to Harry Wilhelm for $3,200,000.00.Â  The parties agreed\r\n  to divide the profits from the flip equally.Â  \r\nThomas\r\n  did not want to sell his Hall Road property if he was not going to be keeping\r\n  waterfront lots on the Doar Road Property.Â  Rod, therefore, obtained a loan\r\n  from Bank of America for $1,560,000.00.Â  Although Rod was the only party named\r\n  on the note, Thomas, on behalf of MariChris, signed the mortgage on the\r\n  Property that secured the note.Â  In addition, at closing Rod contributed\r\n  $696,000.00 from the sale of another property, $116,000.00 in personal funds,\r\n  and $27,000.00 in earnest money.Â  MariChris contributed $13,000.00 in earnest\r\n  money.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Sheer closing occurred on September 14, 2004.Â  The deed lists the purchasers as\r\n  MariChris and Rod. A hand-written asterisk is by their names followed by a\r\n  hand-written note &quot;each a 50% interest.&quot;Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the parties closed on the Property, the closing with Wilhelm fell through.Â  Over\r\n  Rod's objection, Thomas moved into the house on the Property and attempted to\r\n  make improvements to it as well as create a development plan.Â  Thomas attempted\r\n  to make two payments on the note, but Rod had the bank return the payments.Â \r\n  The relationship between the parties quickly deteriorated.Â  \r\nMariChris\r\n  brought this partition action asserting it owned a 50% interest in the\r\n  Property.Â  Rod requested the parties' interests be declared proportionate to\r\n  their financial contributions with Rod therefore having a 99.5% interest. He\r\n  also asserted counterclaims for bad faith, unclean hands, estoppel,\r\n  constructive trust, and ouster.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  case was heard before the master-in-equity.Â  The master held the parties' only\r\n  agreement was to purchase the property for development or sale and to split the\r\n  profits of any sale equally.Â  He rejected Rod's contention that Rod should be\r\n  the 99.5% owner of the Property based on the financial contributions.Â  Instead,\r\n  the master held the parties were legal and equal owners of the Property.Â  In\r\n  considering the contributions of the parties, the master held Thomas's work to\r\n  improve the Property did not render the house or Property more valuable.Â Â  The\r\n  court held Rod was entitled to a return of his contributions in the amount of\r\n  $972,543.26.Â  This figure included a $120,000 credit for MariChris's one-half\r\n  share of the interest paid on the Bank of America note.Â  The court allowed\r\n  MariChris a return of its $13,000 in earnest money.Â  The master rejected all of\r\n  Rod's equitable defenses due to Rod's own inequitable conduct.Â  He also\r\n  rejected Rod's claims for ouster and held any rent due for Thomas's use of the\r\n  house on the Property was discharged by his efforts to make the house livable.Â \r\n  The master held due to the parties' inequitable conduct, he could not provide\r\n  for a partition in kind or in an allotment of the Property.Â  The court noted\r\n  that Cypress Swamp, LLC, had made a reasonable offer to purchase the Property\r\n  and therefore ordered the sale of the Property to Cyprus Swamp at a minimum\r\n  price of $4,815,000.00.Â  In the event Cypress Swamp did not close by September\r\n  30, 2006, the Property was to be sold at judicial sale.Â  The master ordered the\r\n  parties to bear the cost of the sale to Cyprus Swamp equally.Â  The master\r\n  ordered the parties to submit their attorneys' fees and costs for a later\r\n  determination of whether these funds would be assessed against the Property.Â \r\n  He subsequently denied Rod's motion to alter or amend the judgment and for a\r\n  new trial.Â  \r\nThe closing of\r\n  the sale to Cyprus Swamp as provided in the master's order did not occur.Â \r\n  Instead, on July 28, 2006, Rod submitted to the master a proposed contract to\r\n  sell the Property to another buyer for $4,900,000.00 with no sales commission.Â \r\n  No action was ever taken on this offer.Â  The Property was sold at judicial sale\r\n  to an agent for Rod for $4,000,000.00.[1] Â Rod filed a motion requesting the master issue an order determining the amount\r\n  of the funds to be disbursed from the sale of the Property, stay the\r\n  distribution of the disputed amount, and deposit the funds into the court.Â Â  In\r\n  its order, the master noted that the Bank of America mortgage had been\r\n  satisfied.Â  The court refused to allow Rod further credit for payments made on\r\n  the Bank of America note subsequent to the trial and held Rod was solely\r\n  responsible for the payment of taxes.Â  The court found Rod should be\r\n  responsible for the cost of the litigation and added to the amount of funds\r\n  required for Rod to comply with his bid of $97,417.00 for Thomas's attorneys\r\n  and $2050.00 for Rod's former attorney.Â  The court did not make an allocation\r\n  for the fees charged the attorney who represented Rod after the trial.Â  Noting\r\n  he was only requiring Rod to bring to court the amount to satisfy the lien on\r\n  the Property, expenses incurred in bringing the property to sale, and the\r\n  amount he needed to satisfy MariChris's 50% profit, the master calculated\r\n  $855,738.91 as the amount Rod must pay to comply with his bid.Â  The master\r\n  denied Rod's motions to stay the disbursement of funds and to deposit the funds\r\n  with the court.Â  \r\nRod\r\n  filed a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, as well as an appeal with this\r\n  court.Â  On Rod's motion, this court ordered the funds paid to the Clerk of\r\n  Court for Charleston County and deposited into an account pursuant to Rule 67,\r\n  SCRCP.Â  This court also remanded the case for a hearing on Rod's Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion.Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  hearing the motion, the master ruled that while his award of attorney's fees to\r\n  MariChris was warranted under South Carolina Code Section 15-16-110 (2005), the\r\n  award must come from the common fund pursuant to Rule 71(d)(3), SCRCP.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the court adopted Rod's position that if the Court made an award\r\n  of attorney's fees to one party, it must award all parties' attorneys' fees to\r\n  be paid from the fund.Â  Thus, the master ordered attorneys' fees in the amount\r\n  of $175,300.87 to be paid out of the common fund.Â  He refused to modify his\r\n  previous determination of the credit owed Rod for the payments made on the Bank\r\n  of America note.Â  The master noted that it was Rod's own conduct that\r\n  unnecessarily tied the parties to the Property and created the need for the\r\n  partition action.Â  He found under his equitable powers, Rod should have to bear\r\n  the cost of &quot;prolonging the strife associated with the property.&quot;Â \r\n  The master denied MariChris's request to have Rod deposit the entire $4,000,000.00\r\n  bid price with the court.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis\r\n  is an action in equity.Â  Wilson v. McGuire, 320 S.C. 137, 140, 463\r\n  S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct. App. 1995) (a partition action is equitable).Â  Therefore,\r\n  this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence. Inlet Harbour v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation &amp;\r\n    Tourism, 377 S.C. 86, 91, 659 S.E.2d 151, 154 (2008).Â  However, we are not\r\n  required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility. Sloan v.\r\nGreenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Attorneys' fees\r\nBoth\r\n  parties challenge the master's award of attorneys' fees.Â  MariChris argues the\r\n  master erred in ruling that the attorneys' fees must be equally borne by all\r\n  parties and awarded to counsel for all parties.Â  It asserts Rod should be\r\n  responsible for all of its fees.Â  Rod argues that as neither party benefitted\r\n  the property, neither party's attorneys' fees should come from the common fund. \r\nThe\r\n  master originally ordered Rod to pay MariChris's attorneys' fees in the amount\r\n  of $97,417.00 due to Rod's inequitable conduct.Â  On Rod's motion to alter or\r\n  amend, the master changed his ruling.Â  While he noted that MariChris would be\r\n  entitled to fees under South Carolina Code section 15-61-110 (2005) and that\r\n  his view of the equities had not changed, he found persuasive Rod's argument\r\n  that Rule 71(d)(3), SCRCP, must be reconciled with section 15-61-110 and thus\r\n  attorneys' fees must be awarded out of the common fund.Â  In addition, the\r\n  master found if it made an award to one parties' attorney, it must make such an\r\n  award to all attorneys.Â  We find this ruling in error.Â Â  \r\nSection 15-61-110\r\n  of the South Carolina Code provides: &quot;The court of common pleas may fix\r\n  attorneys' fees in all partition proceedings and, as may be equitable, assess\r\n  such fees against any or all of the parties in interest.&quot;Â  Rule 71(d)(3)\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  Attorneys\r\n    fees and costs may be awarded the attorney for any party(s) from any common\r\n    fund generated by the partition to the extent that attorney's efforts benefited\r\n    all parties; otherwise, his fee shall be paid by the party(s) he represents or\r\n    from the party(s) share(s) only.Â Â  The court may order the payment of costs\r\n    from the proceeds of sale of the common property or may equitably assess the\r\n    costs against shares of the parties.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  interpreting a statute and a rule of civil procedure we follow the cardinal\r\n  rule that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in\r\n  the language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended\r\n  purpose of the statute or rule. Â McClanahan v. Richland County Council,\r\n  350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002); see Maxwell v. Genez,\r\n  356 S.C. 617, 620, 591 S.E.2d 26, 27 (2003) (stating that in interpreting the meaning\r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the court applies the same\r\n  rules of construction used to interpret statutes).Â  &quot;The language must\r\n  also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords\r\n  with its general purpose.&quot; Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman,\r\n  309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).\r\nWe find no conflict\r\n  between the statute and rule.Â  Both allow for the award of attorneys' fees from\r\n  the common fund.Â  In addition, section 15-61- 110 clearly allows the court to\r\n  equitably assess attorneys' fees against any or all of the parties in\r\n  interests.Â  A rule of civil procedure may not limit the provisions of a\r\n  statute.Â  See S.C. Const., art. V, Â§4 (2009) (&quot;Subject to the\r\n    statutory law, the Supreme Court shall make rules governing the practice\r\n  and procedure in all such courts.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  Thus, the master\r\n  erred in holding the award of fees must be paid from the common fund.Â  In\r\n  addition we find no requirement in either the rule or the statute that an award\r\n  of attorneys' fees to one party mandates an award to all attorneys.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we remand the issue of attorneys' fees to the master.Â  \r\n2. Ownership interest\r\nRod\r\n  argues the master erred in holding the parties each owned a 50% interest in the\r\n  Property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\n  Where\r\n    two or more persons take as tenants in common under an instrument silent as to\r\n    their respective shares, there is a presumption that their shares are equal.Â \r\n    Ordinarily, this presumption is not conclusive but is subject to rebuttal, and\r\n    has at times been rebutted by parol evidence.Â  A party challenging the\r\n    presumption that property held in joint tenancy is equally owned has the burden\r\n    of proof.\r\n\r\n20 Am. Jur.2d Cotenancy\r\n  and Joint Ownership Â§ 117 (2005).Â  This presumption may be rebutted where\r\n  there is evidence of unequal contributions to the purchase price of the\r\n  property.Â  Id. \r\nThere is no dispute\r\n  that at the time of execution of the deed, the parties intended to equally own\r\n  the property and share the profits.Â  Rod acknowledges in his brief that the\r\n  deed reflects both parties as equal owners of the property and concedes the\r\n  deed accurately reflects the intentions of the parties at the time they\r\n  purchased the property.Â  Thomas explained that at the closing, the paralegal\r\n  asked what the ownership interest would be.Â  The notation was handwritten on\r\n  the deed after Rod replied that it would be 50% each.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  an email sent to MariChris after the Wilhelm flip fell through, Rod\r\n  acknowledged that they had closed on the Property as 50/50 partners.Â  He\r\n  requested MariChris deed him a 12.5% interest in the property to bring his\r\n  interest up to 62.5%.Â  Thomas testified that after the flip fell through, the\r\n  parties never agreed on the ownership interests.Â  Although there may have been\r\n  continuing discussions, there was never an agreement between the parties that\r\n  changed their respective ownership interests.Â  There certainly was never an\r\n  agreement that MariChris would only have a .5% interest in the property.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  MariChris did attempt to make additional financial contributions by making the\r\n  first two payments on the Bank of America loan.Â  These payments were\r\n  subsequently returned to MariChris and on Rod's orders, a bank officer informed\r\n  MariChris that it was not to make further payments on the note.Â  In addition,\r\n  Thomas testified that by the time he sold the Hall Road property, the parties\r\n  were already involved in litigation and he could not roll the proceeds of that\r\n  sale into the Property.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the master did not err in holding the parties each owned a 50% interest\r\n  in the Property.Â  \r\n3. Reimbursement for payments on Bank of America note.Â  \r\nRod\r\n  argues the master erred by not allowing proper credit to him for the interest\r\n  payments he made on the Bank of America loan.Â  We agree.\r\nFor the purposes of\r\n  this argument, Rod does not contest the master's ruling that he prevented\r\n  MariChris from making payments on the interest-only note.Â  He asserts the\r\n  master should have granted him credit for half of all payments made for a total\r\n  of $300,000.00.Â  \r\nWe find no error in\r\n  the master's refusal to allow Rod credit for payments made after the trial.Â \r\n  The master denied Rod credit for these payments due to his conduct.Â  The master\r\n  noted that while Rod contended the property was worth more than the\r\n  court-approved contract for $4,815,000.00, the master believed this amount was\r\n  greater than what a court-ordered sale would bring, and, in fact, the judicial\r\n  sale price was only $4,000,000.00.Â  The master found Rod was responsible for\r\n  none of the offers to purchase the property ever being consummated.Â  Thus, the\r\n  master &quot;determined that it [was] only appropriate that [Rod] should have\r\n  to bear the cost of prolonging the strife associated with the subject property.&quot; \r\nHowever, we find\r\n  the master did err in his distribution calculations.Â  In the original order,\r\n  the master found Rod was entitled to a return of his contributions, including\r\n  $120,000 for payments made to Bank of America on MariChris's behalf.Â  To\r\n  achieve the master's ruling that each party should be responsible for 50% of\r\n  the payments, the master should have deducted $120,000 from MariChris's share\r\n  of the profits or deducted the entire amount of the payments made before trial\r\n  from the common fund.Â  While we find no error in the master's refusal to allow\r\n  credit for further payments made after trial, we hold the master did err in\r\n  essentially making Rod responsible for 75% of the payments made before trial.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we order $240,000 be deducted from the common fund to make\r\n  MariChris responsible for 50% of the payments. \r\nRod also argues the\r\n  master erred in respect to the sum to be credited to Rod with regard to the\r\n  pay-off of the Bank of America note.Â  The master used the figure of\r\n  $1,560,000.00.Â  Rod contends the actual pay-off was $1,570,764.90.Â  First, we\r\n  find there is no evidence of this payoff figure in the record on appeal other\r\n  than a statement by Rod's attorney.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR (&quot;[T]he\r\n  appellate court will not consider any fact which does not appear in the Record\r\n  on Appeal.&quot;).Â Â  Furthermore, the amount of the note is stated in the\r\n  pleadings as well as through-out the record as $1,560,000.00.Â  As we found\r\n  above, the master did not err in refusing to allow Rod credit for interest\r\n  payments made after the trial.Â  This ruling would include the payment of\r\n  accrued interest in final pay-off.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the master's\r\n  statement of the pay-off amount.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe AFFIRM the master's determination that the parties each owned a 50% interest in the\r\n  property, MODIFY the judgment amount to allow for $240,000 to be\r\n  deducted from the common fund for the pre-trial payments made to Bank of\r\n  America, AFFIRM the master's ruling that Rod is not entitled to further\r\n  reimbursement, AFFIRM the amount the master credited Rod for the final\r\n  pay-off of the note and REMAND the issue of attorneys' fees to the\r\n  master.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED IN PART; REMANDED IN PART.\r\nTHOMAS\r\nand LOCKEMY, JJ. concur.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Rod petitioned the master for an appeal bond, which the master set for $300,000.00.Â \r\nHowever, Rod allowed the Property to proceed to sale.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4587","title":"Brookshire v.

Â \r\nBy\r\n  order dated August 31, 2007, the family court enrolled the Alabama custody\r\n  decree[5] in South Carolina and granted the motion to dismiss on the ground it did not\r\n  have in personam jurisdiction over Mother.Â  The family court\r\n  further found the Brookshires' complaint failed to state a cause of action for\r\n  nonconsensual adoption for failure to request a termination of Mother's parental\r\n  rights.Â  Additionally, the order cited Alabama's retention of exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction under the PKPA and the fact that a similar action was pending in\r\nAlabama as alternative grounds for dismissal.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Brookshires timely filed a motion to alter or amend.Â  Following argument on the\r\n  motion on December 20, 2007, the family court reaffirmed its decision to\r\n  dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction but amended the order to\r\n  hold it was not necessary to reach the alternative grounds cited in the original\r\n  order based on the court's ruling on in personam jurisdiction.Â \r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the family court err in dismissing the adoption action for lack of personal\r\njurisdiction?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814\r\n(1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Brookshires assert the family court erred in\r\n  applying the minimum contacts standard and dismissing the action for lack of\r\npersonal jurisdiction.Â  \r\nWhile due process ordinarily requires a defendant\r\n  possess minimum contacts with the forum state,[6] we find this case more appropriately resolved as a question of interstate\r\n  custody jurisdiction.[7]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm as modified the dismissal of this case by the family\r\n  court pursuant to the provisions of the PKPA and the Uniform Child Custody\r\n  Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA),[8] which prohibit the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction to modify a custody decree.\r\n  Â See Upchurch v. New York Times, 314 S.C. 531, 538, 431 S.E.2d\r\n  558, 562 (1993) (â€œWe may affirm the trial judge for any reason appearing in the\r\nrecord.â€) (citing Rule 220(c), SCACR).\r\nAs\r\n  indicated, this case presents an issue involving the interpretation and\r\n  application of the jurisdictional provisions of the PKPA and UCCJA in the\r\n  context of an action to domesticate an out of state custody order and to obtain\r\n  an adoption. Â The PKPA, enacted by the United States Congress in 1980, and the\r\n  UCCJA, enacted by the South Carolina Legislature in 1981, govern jurisdiction\r\n  in interstate child custody disputes.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A (2000); S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§Â§ 20-7-782 to -830 (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2007).Â  Despite their titles, both\r\n  the PKPA and UCCJA have been construed to apply to adoption actions.Â  See Doe v. Baby Girl, 376 S.C. 267, 657 S.E.2d 455 (2008) (applying the PKPA\r\n  to interstate adoption action); In re Baby Girl F., __ N.E.2d __, 2008\r\n  WL 5195638 at *7 (Ill. App. 2nd Dist. 2008) (stating the PKPA applies\r\n  specifically to adoptions and citing applicable cases); Clark\r\n    v. Gordon, 313 S.C. 240, 242-43, 437 S.E.2d 144, 145-46 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (holding that adoption proceedings, by virtue of their impact on the termination\r\n  of a parent's custody rights, fall within the ambit of the UCCJA).Â \r\n  Substantively, the acts are very similar; however, where the provisions of the\r\n  PKPA and state law conflict, the PKPA controls. Â Schwartz v. Schwartz,\r\n  311 S.C. 303, 307-08, 428 S.E.2d 748, 750-51 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that where\r\nthe provisions of the PKPA and state law conflict, the federal act controls). Â \r\nThe PKPA and UCCJA provide four bases for jurisdiction: (1) home\r\n  state; (2) significant connection; (3) emergency jurisdiction; and (4) default\r\n  jurisdiction. Â 28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2007). Â While\r\n  the two acts provide parallel bases for jurisdiction, the PKPA gives priority\r\n  to the home state.Â  The PKPA and UCCJA define &quot;home state&quot; as the\r\n  state in which, immediately preceding the time involved, the child lived with\r\n  his parents, a parent, or a person acting as a parent, for at least six\r\n  consecutive months.[9]Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(b)(4) (2000); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-786(5) (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2007).Â \r\n  Home state jurisdiction also exists when the state had been the home state\r\n  within the previous six months and the child is absent from the state because\r\n  he or she has been removed or retained by a person claiming custody, or for\r\n  other reasons, and a parent or person acting as a parent still lives in the\r\n  state.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c)(2)(A) (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (Supp. 2006)\r\n(repealed 2007). Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  addition to prioritizing home state jurisdiction, the PKPA mandates exclusive\r\n  continuing jurisdiction in the state initially issuing the decree if that state\r\n  remains the residence of the children or any contestant and provided that state\r\n  has not declined to exercise jurisdiction.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(f).Â  The\r\n  procedure for prioritizing the jurisdiction of the issuing decree state is\r\n  contained in sections 1738A(d) and 1738A(f) of the Act. Â Specifically, these\r\n  provisions limit custody jurisdiction to the first state to properly enter a\r\n  custody order, as long as two sets of requirements are met. Â First, the Act requires\r\n  that the initial determination is made in accordance with the PKPA. Â 28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(a). Â To\r\n  be consistent with the PKPA, the state must have jurisdiction under\r\n  its own local law and meet one of the four identified bases for jurisdiction. Â 28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c). Â Second, the PKPA incorporates a state law inquiry by mandating that the first\r\n  state must still have jurisdiction under its own law in order to retain\r\n  exclusive responsibility for modifying its prior order. Â 28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(d), (f). Â This state law inquiry necessarily results in the application of the issuing\r\n  state's version of the UCCJA or its successor, the UCCJEA, promulgated in\r\n1997.Â  \r\nSpecifically,\r\nSections 1738A(d) and 1738A(f) provide in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (d)\r\n    The jurisdiction of a court of a State which has made a child custody or\r\n    visitation determination consistently with the provisions of this section\r\n    continues as long as the requirement of subsection (c)(1)[10] of this section continues to be met and such State remains the residence of the\r\n    child or of any contestant . . . \r\n\r\n* *\r\n*\r\n\r\n  (f)\r\n    A court of a State may modify a determination of the custody of the same child\r\n    made by a court of another State, if - -\r\n  \r\n    (1)\r\n      it has jurisdiction to make such a child custody determination; and\r\n    (2)\r\n      the court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction, or it has declined to\r\n      exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.\r\n          \r\n      \r\n  \r\n\r\n28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(d), (f).Â  Briefly stated, under Â§ 1738A(d) above, whether a\r\n  state retains jurisdiction is a matter of state law and the residence of one\r\n  contestant.Â  Like Â§ 1738A(f) of the PKPA, the UCCJA also forbids states from\r\n  modifying sister state custody decrees unless the forum court itself has\r\n  jurisdiction and the state which initially entered the custody order no longer\r\n  has such jurisdiction or has declined to exercise jurisdiction to modify the\r\n  decree.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-810 (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2007).Â  The UCCJA,\r\n  however, does not specifically recognize continuing jurisdiction based on\r\n  continued residence of one party. Â Id.Â  Notwithstanding, we reiterate\r\n  that where the PKPA and state law conflict, the PKPA controls.Â  See Schwartz,\r\n  311 S.C. at 307-08, 428 S.E.2d at 750-51.Â  Thus, the appropriate inquiry is\r\n  whether the first court's exercise of jurisdiction was in accordance with the\r\n  PKPA and whether that jurisdiction continues as a matter of state law and the\r\nresidence of any contestant.Â  Doe, 376 S.C. at 279, 657 S.E.2d at 461.Â Â  \r\nHere, Alabama issued the initial decree awarding custody\r\n  of the two minor children to the Brookshires on October 14, 2004.Â  Therefore,\r\n  pursuant to the PKPA, South Carolina must give full faith and credit to the\r\n  Alabama custody decree provided the Alabama decree was rendered in accordance\r\n  with the PKPA. Â Upon review of the applicable provisions, we conclude the\r\n  Alabama custody decree is consistent with the PKPA.Â  Specifically, under Â§\r\n  1738A(c) of the PKPA, Alabama was the home state of the children within six\r\n  months prior to the commencement of the initial custody proceeding.Â  Likewise,\r\n  the Alabama court had jurisdiction under its own law to render the initial\r\n  custody decree because the children and the children's parents were residents\r\nof Alabama at the time the initial proceeding was commenced.Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  determined the initial custody order is consistent with the PKPA, we now must\r\n  consider whether Alabama's jurisdiction continues and whether South Carolina\r\n  has authority to modify the Alabama order. As indicated above, this inquiry\r\n  requires that the issuing state maintain jurisdiction under its own state law.Â \r\n  Alabama incorporates the UCCJEA, codified in Section 30-3B-101 et seq. of the\r\n  Alabama Code (1975), as its authority in determining jurisdiction in custody\r\n  matters.[11]Â \r\n  Pursuant to Alabama's UCCJEA, Alabama maintains continuing, exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction over a custody determination stemming from an initial custody\r\ndetermination issued by its courts until:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A court of\r\n      [Alabama] determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor\r\n      the child and a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with\r\n      this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in [Alabama]\r\n      concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships;\r\n      or \r\n    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A court of\r\n      [Alabama] or a court of another state determines that the child, the child's\r\n      parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in [Alabama].\r\n  \r\n\r\nAla.\r\n  Code Â§ 30-3B-202(a) (West 2009).Â  Here, there is no indication in the record\r\n  that Alabama has made any determination that the children, the children's\r\n  parents, or the Brookshires no longer have a significant connection with\r\n  Alabama; thus, the first of the above stated exceptions is inapplicable.Â Â \r\n  Further, Mother is a contestant and continues to reside in Alabama.Â  As such,\r\n  we find Alabama maintains jurisdiction under its own law.Â  Accordingly, we further\r\n  conclude Alabama has met the requirements of Â§ 1738A(d) for continuing\r\n  jurisdiction since Mother continues to reside in Alabama.Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  to our final inquiry, we must consider whether South Carolina may modify the\r\n  Alabama decree as set forth under Â§ 1738A(f) of the PKPA and former Â§ 20-7-810\r\n  of South Carolina's UCCJA which allow for modification of the initial decree by\r\n  a subsequent state only if (1) Alabama no longer has jurisdiction, or (2) it\r\n  has declined to exercise jurisdiction.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(f); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-810 (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2007).Â  As indicated, Alabama meets\r\n  the requirements for continuing jurisdiction; thus, Alabama has not lost\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Furthermore, there is no indication in the record that Alabama\r\n  has declined to exercise jurisdiction.Â  Thus, while a family court in South\r\n  Carolina may have subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case,[12] pursuant\r\n  to the PKPA and UCCJA, it may not exercise concurrent jurisdiction over any\r\n  proceeding affecting custody for the period of time Alabama's jurisdiction\r\n  continues under its own law.Â  See Clay v. Burkle, 369 S.C. 651,\r\n  658, 633 S.E.2d 173, 177 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that South Carolina lacked authority\r\n  to modify custody decision where the state that issued the initial custody\r\n  order had continuing jurisdiction); Sinclair v. Albrecht, 287 S.C. 20,\r\n  23, 336 S.E.2d 485, 487 (Ct. App. 1985) (&quot;Although more than one state may\r\n  meet these jurisdictional requirements, once a custody decree has been entered,\r\n  the continuing jurisdiction of the decree state is exclusive.&quot;); Marks\r\n    v. Marks, 281 S.C. 316, 321, 315 S.E.2d 158, 161 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding\r\n  state that issued initial custody decree had continuing jurisdiction and,\r\n  therefore, under Â§ 1738A(f), South Carolina was prohibited from modifying the\r\n  issuing state's custody decree).Â  This result is consistent with the PKPA and\r\n  UCCJA's goal of providing a uniform standard for continuing, exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction in the issuing state and discouraging the issuance of conflicting\r\n  custody decrees.Â  Accordingly, until such time as the circumstances providing\r\n  Alabama with continuing jurisdiction are no longer present, South Carolina may\r\nnot modify the existing Alabama custody decree.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we recognize the fundamental interests of the natural parents of the\r\n  children.Â  We also acknowledge our own state policy of carefully safeguarding\r\n  the interests of the children.Â  Because all of these interests are significant,\r\n  the United States Congress chose to implement a procedure to avoid conflicts\r\n  between the states which may understandably and justifiably attempt to protect\r\n  the individuals within its borders.Â  As a result of the federal legislation, we\r\n  find Alabama maintains continuing jurisdiction over any custody and/or\r\n  termination proceeding affecting custody in this matter.Â  Absent consent or\r\n  relinquishment, any adoption proceeding simply cannot proceed until termination\r\n  of parental rights is obtained.Â  We therefore affirm as modified the dismissal\r\n  of this action, but do so without prejudice in the event the Brookshires obtain\r\n  successful termination of parental rights in Alabama or, in the alternative,\r\nthey obtain consent or relinquishment from the natural parents.[13]Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\nAS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] DHR initially\r\n  became involved with the children when it was discovered that Mother's\r\n  grandmother was the children's primary caregiver.Â  Upon further investigation,\r\n  DHR soon learned that Mother's youngest child was born addicted to methadone\r\n  and that the children's great grandmother could no longer maintain custody or\r\n  protection for the children.Â  The Brookshires, who are the children's third\r\n  cousins, subsequently informed DHR of their willingness to take custody of the\r\nchildren.Â  \r\n[2] At oral\r\n  argument, counsel indicated Father may have subsequently moved.Â  The record\r\ndoes not demonstrate this fact, but it would not change our analysis. \r\n[3] See 28\r\nU.S.C. Â§ 1738A (2000).\r\n[4] On June 29,\r\n  2007, Mother filed a modification action in Alabama seeking to modify custody\r\nor, in the alternative, to set a reasonable visitation schedule. \r\n[5] The parties do\r\nnot contest the enrollment of the Alabama order.\r\n[6] The Due Process\r\n  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment permits a court to assert personal\r\n  jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant where the defendant has &quot;certain\r\n  minimum contacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit\r\n  does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.&quot;Â  Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (internal\r\nquotation omitted).Â  \r\n[7] Although\r\n  numerous states have applied a status exception, recognized by the United\r\n  States Supreme Court in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977), to\r\n  confer jurisdiction over a nonresident in termination of parental rights cases,\r\n  the applicability of the status exception to adoption proceedings is less\r\n  clear.Â  See id. at 201 (stating cases involving the personal\r\n  status of the plaintiff, such as divorce proceedings, could be adjudicated in\r\n  the plaintiff's home state despite defendant's absence from the state); see\r\n    also J.D. v. Tuscaloosa County Dept. of Human Resources, 923 So.2d\r\n  303, 310 (Ala. Civ. App. 2005) (holding the status exception to the requirement\r\n  that the defendant have minimum contacts with the forum state applies to\r\n  termination of parental rights proceedings); In re Interest of M.L.K.,\r\n  768 P.2d 316, 319 (Kan. App. 1989) (holding the status exception extends to\r\n  termination proceedings because the termination of parental rights is a\r\n  determination of the legal status between the parent and the child); In re\r\n    Adoption of Copeland, 43 S.W.3d 483, 487 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000) (holding\r\n  under UCCJA Tennessee court had jurisdiction over father to terminate parental\r\n  rights despite father's lack of minimum contacts with forum because child\r\n  custody proceeding was a determination of status falling within the status\r\n  exception to the minimum contacts standard).Â  Nonetheless, we view this nonconsensual adoption action before us as requiring a bifurcated proceeding since an\r\n  adoption may not proceed in this case without first obtaining a termination of\r\n  parental rights.Â  Otherwise, the form of the action would prevail over the\r\n  substance of the issues to be determined and potentially thwart the legislative\r\ngoals behind the PKPA and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA).\r\n[8] See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-782 to -830 (Supp. 2006), repealed by 2007 S.C. Acts\r\n  No. 60 (Act No. 60 repealed the UCCJA and replaced it with the Uniform Child\r\n  Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)).Â  At oral argument, Appellant's counsel asserted the\r\n  applicability of the UCCJA, rather than the UCCJEA, since the action was filed\r\nprior to the enactment of the UCCJEA. \r\n[9] &quot;Person\r\n  acting as a parent&quot; is defined under the PKPA and UCCJA as a person, other\r\n  than a parent, who has physical custody of a child who has either been awarded\r\n  custody by a court or claims a right to custody.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(b)(6)\r\n  (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-786(9) (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2007).Â  Under this\r\n  definition, Mr. and Mrs. Brookshire would each be considered to be a person\r\n  acting as a parent since they were awarded custody of the children by the\r\nAlabama court.\r\n[10] Subsection\r\n  (c)(1) provides: &quot;A child custody or visitation determination made by a court\r\n  of a State is consistent with the provisions of this section only if - -Â  (1)\r\n  such court has jurisdiction under the law of such State.&quot; Â 28 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  1738A(c)(1).\r\n[11] While the\r\n  UCCJEA contains a provision specifically exempting the Act from applying to\r\n  adoption proceedings, the Alabama Court of Appeals has held the UCCJEA applies\r\n  to cases involving adoption where the natural parents' rights must be\r\n  determined initially as part of the adoption proceeding.Â  See D.B. v.\r\n    M.A., 975 So.2d 927, 936-37 (Ala. Civ. App. 2006) (applying the UCCJEA to\r\n  an adoption case where a custody determination regarding the father's parental\r\nrights had to be rendered before the adoption proceedings could continue). Â \r\n[12] The family\r\n  court has jurisdiction over adoption proceedings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-9-40 (2008) (formerly Â§ 20-7-1680 (Supp. 2007) (providing for jurisdiction\r\n  over adoption proceedings in family courts)); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-828 (Supp.\r\n  2006) (repealed 2007) (providing for jurisdiction over actions under the UCCJA\r\n  in family courts); see also Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C.\r\n  235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (stating subject matter jurisdiction is\r\n  the power of a court to hear and determine cases in the general class to which\r\nthe proceedings in question belong).Â  \r\n[13] Alternatively,\r\n  we note that neither consent, relinquishment, nor termination of parental\r\n  rights has been pled or requested as relief. Â As a result of this deficiency,\r\n  we conclude the complaint failed to comply with the requirements for a petition\r\n  for adoption as set forth under Section 63-9-710 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2008) (formerly Â§ 20-7-1730 (Supp. 2007)), namely the failure to state facts\r\n  which excuse consent on the part of a parent to the adoption.

(AAG) appeals from the master-in-equity's order awarding Springs &amp;\r\n  Davenport, Inc., d/b/a H.B. Springs, Co., (Springs) $75,000 in commissions for\r\n  the sale of property, arguing the master erred in finding: (1) the commission\r\n  agreement was not a modification of the original listing contract; (2) the\r\n  commission agreement did not create a condition precedent to payment of the\r\n  commission; (3) Springs's interest in the property did not terminate with the\r\n  foreclosure sale; and (4) the sale of the property to Clark Homes was not the\r\n  result of intervening events or any of Springs's actions.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAAG[1] owned property in Myrtle Beach and\r\n  entered into an exclusive contract with Springs, an Horry County real estate\r\n  brokerage company,[2] to sell the land for $1.2 million, or for another price only if agreed to by\r\n  AAG.Â  The contract, signed on July 23, 1999, provided Springs would receive a\r\n  commission of ten percent of the gross sales price of the property.Â  That same\r\n  month, Springs found a buyer for the land, and on August 3, 1999, AAG sold the\r\n  property to Bill Clark Homes (Clark) for $1.2 million.Â  On November 16, 1999,\r\n  AAG and Clark signed a contract addendum, reducing the sale price to $1.17 million.Â \r\n  Clark financed the property, paying AAG $345,000 at closing and financing the\r\n  remaining $800,000 pursuant to a promissory note.[3]Â  The promissory note was signed on\r\n  January 4, 2000, and the mortgage was recorded on January 10, 2000.Â  In a January 6, 2000 letter from AAG to Springs, an\r\n  agreement was entered into concerning how the commission was to be paid to\r\n  Springs.Â  The parties agreed that Springs would receive $37,000 in commission at closing and &quot;[ten percent] of all principal payments made by [Clark]\r\n  to [AAG],&quot; pursuant to the purchase money mortgage promissory note;\r\nhowever, Springs's commission was not to exceed a total of $117,000.\r\nClark defaulted on the first $400,000 payment due under the note,\r\n  and AAG foreclosed on the property.Â  In\r\n  the foreclosure action, the master's order granted AAG a judgment against Clark\r\n  in the amount of $907,061.48 and ordered the property to be sold at a public\r\n  auction.Â  AAG re-purchased\r\n  the property subject to the note at the foreclosure sale for $422,100 and filed a &quot;Satisfaction of\r\n  Mortgage by Foreclosure&quot; in the Horry County R.M.C. office stating the\r\n  mortgage was &quot;released, canceled and satisfied.&quot;Â  After the sale of the property, the\r\n  judgment was considered partially satisfied with a balance of $484,961.48 plus\r\n  interest still owed to AAG.Â  To satisfy the remaining balance, AAG filed a\r\n  second action against Clark[4] for land AAG sold to Clark that was not subject to the foreclosed mortgage.Â  The\r\n  parties settled the action.Â  In exchange for $750,000, AAG executed a limited\r\n  warranty deed transferring AAG's interest in all the property to Clark and\r\n  released Clark from the deficiency judgment.Â  The limited warranty deed was\r\n  filed with the Horry County Clerk of Court and conveyed any interest AAG had in\r\n  the property it purchased at the foreclosure sale and the property subject to\r\nthe second action.Â  AAG did not pay Springs any additional commission.\r\nSprings filed a complaint against AAG and John Mancino, a\r\n  principal of AAG, seeking the remaining commission for selling the property.Â \r\n  The case was referred to the master by consent order.Â  The amended complaint\r\n  listed five causes of action; however, the parties agreed to waive all claims except\r\n  Springs's claim for its real estate commission from AAG.Â  All counterclaims and\r\n  Mancino were dismissed by agreement.Â  For the purposes of the action, Springs\r\n  and AAG agreed to use $75,000 as the figure for the commission in dispute.Â  The\r\n  master entered judgment against AAG in the amount of $124,996, which was\r\n  comprised of $75,000 in commission, $15,000 in attorneys' fees, and $34,996 in\r\n  prejudgment interest.[5]Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An action for\r\n  a broker's commission is an action at law.&quot;Â  Chambers v. Pingree, 351\r\n  S.C. 442, 449, 570 S.E.2d 528, 531 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In a law action tried\r\n  before a master, this court's review is limited to correcting errors of law,\r\n  and we are required to uphold the master's findings of fact unless there is no\r\n  evidence to support it.Â  Id.; Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville,\r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  &quot;Where mixed questions of\r\n  fact and law are presented, the legal conclusions to be drawn are not entitled to\r\n  the same deference.&quot;Â  Chambers, 351 S.C. at 449, 570 S.E.2d at 531.Â Â \r\n  Â \r\n&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAAG\r\n  argues the commission agreement was a modification of the original listing\r\n  contract and created a condition precedent to payment of the commission.[6]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  a broker earns his commission when &quot;he procures a purchaser who is\r\n  accepted by the owner of the property and with whom the latter, uninfluenced by\r\n  any representation or fraud on the part of the broker, enters into a valid and\r\n  enforceable contract.&quot;Â  Thomas-McCain, Inc. v. Siter, 268 S.C. 193,\r\n  196, 232 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1977).Â  Further, a broker's right to compensation &quot;will\r\n  not be defeated by the failure or refusal of the purchaser to consummate the\r\n  contract.&quot;Â  Id.Â  However, the general rule may be modified by\r\n  agreement:\r\n\r\n  It is\r\n    equally well settled that the broker and owner &quot;may make such a contract\r\n    for the broker's services as is agreeable to them, and may make the payment of\r\n    the broker's commission dependent upon the full performance of the contract of\r\n    purchase or sale, or postpone the payment of the commission, or make the\r\n    broker's right to the commission contingent upon the happening of future events.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\nHamrick v. Cooper River\r\n  Lumber Co., 223 S.C. 119, 124, 74\r\n  S.E.2d 575, 577 (1953) (quoting Brown Paper Mill Co., Inc. v. Irvin, 146\r\n  F.2d 232, 234 (8th Cir. 1945)). Â &quot;'Where the obligation of the principal\r\n  to pay commissions depends upon the performance of conditions precedent, the\r\n  broker takes the risk of nonperformance on the part of the customer.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Segal Brokerage Co., Inc. v. Lloyd L. Hughes, Inc., 96 F.2d\r\n  208, 210 (9th Cir. 1938)).Â  \r\nA condition\r\n  precedent is &quot;any fact, other than mere lapse of time, which, unless\r\n  excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance by the\r\n  promisor can arise.&quot;Â  Ballenger Corp. v. City of Columbia, 286 S.C.\r\n  1, 5, 331 S.E.2d 365, 368 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  &quot;Words and phrases such as\r\n  'if,' 'provided that,' 'when,' 'after,' 'as soon as,' and 'subject to'\r\n  frequently are used to indicate that performance expressly has been made\r\n  conditional.&quot;Â  Cobb v. Gross, 291 S.C. 550, 552, 354 S.E.2d 573,\r\n  574 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  &quot;Whether a stipulation in a contract constitutes a\r\n  condition precedent is a question of construction dependent on the intent of\r\n  the parties to be gathered from the language they employ.&quot;Â  Id.Â  If\r\n  there is doubt about the construction of a writing, the doubt must be resolved\r\n  against the drafter and in favor of the party to whom it was delivered.Â  Charles\r\n    v. West, 155 S.C. 488, 494, 152 S.E. 644, 646 (1930).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the exclusive right to sell contract signed between Springs and AAG\r\n  in July 1999 stated Springs's commission was due upon any of the following\r\n  events: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) The sale of the property during\r\n      the authorization period or as a result of a contract secured during the\r\n      authorization period;\r\n    (2) The signing by [AAG] of a valid\r\n      contract to sell the property but [AAG] fails or refuses to complete the sale\r\n      as agreed; or\r\n    (3) The presentation to [AAG] of a\r\n      valid and bona fide written offer to purchase the property which complies with\r\n      the terms and conditions specified herein.\r\n    The broker\r\n      fee shall be earned, due and payable when an Agreement to purchase, option,\r\n      exchange, lease or trade is signed by [AAG].Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe January 6, 2000 letter,\r\n  sent five months after the contract between AAG and Clark was signed, provided\r\n  that Springs &quot;shall be paid as follows: 1. $37,000.00 to be paid at\r\n  closing.Â Â Â  2. 10% of all principal payments made by [Clark] to [AAG] under the\r\n  balance purchase money promissory note.&quot;Â  \r\nAAG\r\n  and Clark signed the contract for the sale of property on August 3, 1999; thus,\r\n  according to the exclusive right to sell contract, Springs's commission was due\r\n  when the contract was signed, regardless of whether Clark completed the\r\n  purchase of the property.Â  However, AAG argued the January 6, 2000 letter\r\n  created a condition precedent, and Springs's commission was contingent on Clark\r\n  making his payments under the promissory note.Â  Thus, AAG argued because Clark\r\n  failed to make his first payment, the funds from which the commission was to be\r\n  paid did not exist, and the condition precedent had not been met.Â  Springs\r\n  argued the letter did not create a condition precedent because there was no\r\n  language in the letter to evidence a meeting of the minds by the parties that\r\n  Springs would not be due a commission until the payments were made under the\r\n  promissory note.Â  The letter did not specifically state Springs would not be\r\n  paid until or unless Clark makes his payments under the promissory note.Â  \r\nWe find this case\r\n  is similar to Charles v. West, 155 S.C. 488, 491, 152 S.E. 644, 644\r\n  (1930).Â  In Charles, at the closing, the seller gave the broker a\r\n  &quot;due bill&quot; for payment at a later time instead of cash.Â  Then,\r\n  because of problems with the transaction, the seller attempted to not pay the\r\n  broker pursuant to the due bill.Â  Charles, 155 S.C. at 491, 152 S.E. at\r\n  644-45.Â  The court found the due bill did not state clearly whether payment\r\n  would not be made unless and until the occurrence of a future event, and\r\n  because the writing was drafted by the seller, any doubt of its construction\r\n  must be resolved against him and in favor of the broker.Â  Id. at 494,\r\n  152 S.E. at 646. The court also determined the broker did not sign the\r\n  &quot;due bill&quot; and there was no evidence of any new consideration moving\r\n  to either of the parties for its execution and delivery because when the bill\r\n  was given to him, the broker had already completed what he had agreed to do,\r\n  which was to procure a satisfactory customer.Â  Id.Â  Here, although\r\n  Springs did sign the January 6, 2000 letter, when it did so, it had already\r\n  done what the contract required it to do to receive its commission because AAG\r\n  and Clark had signed a sales contract.Â  See Thomas-McCain, 268\r\n  S.C. at 199, 232 S.E.2d at 730 (concluding that pursuant to the contract, the\r\n  broker had earned the commission, payment of the commission was due even in the\r\n  event of default, and there were no further obligations to be performed by the\r\n  broker).Â  If AAG had wanted to ensure it only owed Springs a commission if and\r\n  when Clark made its payments, AAG could have used language stating no commission\r\n  was due unless payment was made by Clark.Â  Thus, construing the letter against\r\n  the drafter, AAG, we find the letter did not create a condition precedent, but\r\n  merely extended the time AAG had to pay Springs its commission.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the master properly determined the January 6, 2000 letter did not create a\r\n  condition precedent extinguishing AAG's obligation to pay Springs its\r\n  commission because the letter did not specifically state Springs was not\r\n  entitled to a commission if Clark failed to pay.Â  Additionally, when the\r\n  January 6, 2000 letter was signed, Springs had already performed its entire\r\n  obligation under the broker agreement and was due its full commission.Â  Because\r\n  this issue is dispositive of the case, we do not reach the merits of AAG's\r\n  remaining issues.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that if an appellate court's\r\n  ruling on a particular issue is dispositive of an appeal, rulings on remaining\r\n  issues are unnecessary).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the master's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\nand LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] John\r\nMancino was a principal of AAG.\r\n[2] Van Davenport was a principal of\r\nSprings.Â  \r\n[3] The $800,000 promissory note was secured by a\r\n  purchase money mortgage to AAG and was to be paid in two installments of\r\n  $400,000 each.Â  The first installment was due on or before January 4, 2001, and\r\nthe second installment was due on or before January 4, 2002.\r\n[4] The action was against BHHL Builders, LLC and Bill\r\n  Clark Homes because Bill Clark had deeded the land to BHHL, another company he\r\npartially owned. \r\n[5] AAG did not appeal the award of attorneys' fees or\r\nprejudgment interest.Â  \r\n[6] This issue addresses Appellant's first and second\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4589","title":"Mortgage Electronic Systems, Inc. v.

White and Amanda L. White (collectively the\r\n  Whites) appeal the special referee's judgment for Mortgage Electronic\r\n  Registration Systems, Inc. (Mortgage Electronic).Â  They argue the special\r\n  referee erred in: (1) denying their motion for a jury trial, (2) failing to\r\n  recuse himself from the case, and (3) awarding judgment to Mortgage Electronic\r\n  despite evidence that allegedly indicated fraud during the mortgage process.Â \r\n  We affirm.Â  [1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 20,\r\n  2000, the Whites obtained a loan in the amount of $82,000 from Fleet National\r\n  Bank in order to purchase a mobile home.Â  To secure the loan, they executed a\r\n  mortgage with the bank, using real property in Clarendon County.Â  The real\r\n  property was owned in fee simple by Son's father, Daniel R. White (Father), and\r\n  neither Son nor Amanda held any concurrent interest in the real property at the\r\n  time the mortgage was executed.Â  Fleet National Bank later assigned the\r\n  mortgage to Mortgage Electronic.Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May of 2002, Mortgage Electronic brought an action for foreclosure after the\r\n  Whites defaulted on the mortgage.Â  Mortgage Electronic was unable to locate the\r\n  Whites to serve them with the complaint, and instead noticed the foreclosure\r\n  through publication. On Mortgage Electronic's motion, the case was transferred\r\n  to a special referee.Â  \r\nThe Whites' first\r\n  appearance in this action occurred almost two years after Mortgage Electronic\r\n  initially filed the complaint, when they filed an answer and demanded a jury\r\n  trial on April 7, 2004. Â On Mortgage Electronic's motion, the special referee\r\n  joined Father to the action after Mortgage Electronic discovered Father owned\r\n  the property involved in the mortgage foreclosure.Â  In an order filed August\r\n  17, 2005, the special referee denied the Whites' demand for jury and added as\r\n  third-party defendants the closing attorney, Hugh M. Cooper, and one of his\r\n  employees.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Whites, along\r\n  with Father, renewed their demand for a jury trial in their answer to Mortgage\r\n  Electronic's second amended complaint, filed on September 21, 2005.Â  In their\r\n  answer, they asserted a fraud counterclaim against Mortgage Electronic.Â \r\n  Specifically, they maintained Cooper who worked on the mortgage paperwork\r\n  forged the closing documents to reflect the name of Father rather than Son. Â The\r\n  Whites alleged Cooper took these actions in order to facilitate the closing of\r\n  the loan, as Son did not legally own the property.Â  They also asserted\r\n  counterclaims for slander of title and violation of the South Carolina Consumer\r\n  Protection Code, 37-10-102, -5-108 of South Carolina Code (2002 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  In addition, the Whites and Father asserted claims for slander of title\r\n  and fraud against Cooper and his employee.Â  The Whites subsequently dismissed\r\n  their third-party claims against Cooper and his employee.Â Â Â  \r\nThe special referee\r\n  proceeded with a non-jury trial on June 20, 2006.Â  Before the trial started,\r\n  the Whites brought two pre-trial motions before the special referee: Â (1) a\r\n  motion for the recusal of the special referee and (2) a motion for jury trial\r\n  based on their fraud counterclaim.Â  The special referee denied the Whites'\r\n  motion for recusal.Â  The special referee also denied the motion for jury trial\r\n  based on the fraud counterclaim, stating the motion was not timely made.\r\nAfter\r\n  a two-day trial, the special referee declared the mortgage was void ab\r\n    initio because Father, the fee simple owner of the property, was not a\r\n  mortgagor or a party to the mortgage.Â  He ordered the sale of the mobile home\r\n  and calculated the judgment amount as $111,820.10.Â  He did not address the\r\n  issue of fraud.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Jury TrialÂ  \r\nThe\r\n  Whites argue the special referee erred in denying their motion for a jury\r\n  trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, we consider whether the Whites waived their right to a jury\r\n  trial.Â  Orders affecting the right to jury trial are immediately appealable and\r\n  must be raised in court at the first opportunity.Â  Lester v. Dawson, 327\r\n  S.C. 263, 266, 491 S.E.2d 240, 241 (1997).Â  If the order is not immediately\r\n  appealed, the trial by jury issue is waived for purposes of appeal.Â  Id. \r\nWe\r\n  first consider the Whites' failure to appeal the August 2005 order. The Whites\r\n  initially made a demand for a jury trial in three pleadings: Â their two\r\n  individual answers to Mortgage Electronic's first complaint and their motion to\r\n  add a third-party defendant/motion for jury trial.Â  The special referee ruled\r\n  upon these motions in its August 2005 order, denying the Whites' initial jury\r\n  demands.Â  As the Whites failed to appeal the special referee's order, they\r\n  waived their right to raise any claims on these initial jury demands on\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  next turn to an analysis of the Whites' final jury demand on the issue of\r\n  fraud. Â The Whites made another jury demand in their answer to Mortgage\r\n  Electronic's second amended complaint filed September 21, 2005, in which they\r\n  asserted a counterclaim for fraud for the first time. Â Although the Whites did\r\n  not appeal the referee's denial of their demand for a jury trial prior to final\r\n  judgment, we hold they did not waive their right to have appellate review of\r\n  the denial.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  case is similar to Bateman v. Rouse, 358 S.C. 667, 596 S.E.2d 386 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  In Bateman, on the day a jury trial was scheduled, the\r\n  trial judge sua sponte ruled that the appellant was not entitled to a\r\n  jury trial and held a non-jury trial that same day after only a brief recess. Â Id. at 671, 596 S.E.2d at 388.Â  The appellant requested that the case be continued\r\n  to allow her to appeal, but the trial judge refused her request, declaring that\r\n  a right to a jury trial was not immediately appealable. Â Id. at 672, 596\r\n  S.E.2d at 388.Â  This court held:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Because\r\n      the judge also denied [the appellant's] motion to hold the case in abeyance and\r\n      because the non-jury trial proceeded shortly after the judge made his erroneous\r\n      finding that [the appellant] had no right to a jury trial, [the appellant] had\r\n      no meaningful opportunity to immediately appeal. Â The judge's denial of [the\r\n      appellant's] motion to hold the trial in abeyance placed counsel in an\r\n      untenable position, as [the appellant's] counsel could not both proceed with\r\n      the trial and immediately appeal the jury trial issue. \r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 675, 596 S.E.2d at 390.Â  Accordingly, this court\r\n  concluded the appellant had not waived her right to a jury trial.Â  Id. at\r\n  676, 596 S.E.2d at 391.\r\nHere,\r\n  as in Bateman, the special referee made his ruling on the Whites' demand\r\n  for a jury trial on the day of the hearing.Â  Although the Whites requested the\r\n  referee delay the hearing to allow for them to appeal the ruling, the special referee\r\n  held they were not entitled to an immediate appeal and proceeded with the\r\n  trial.Â  Accordingly, we find the Whites appealed the special referee's denial\r\n  of their motion for a jury trial at the first available opportunity.Â  Thus,\r\n  this court may consider the denial of their demand for a jury trial.Â Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the beginning of the hearing, the special referee denied the Whites' motion for\r\n  a jury trial on the fraud counterclaim because he believed the demand was not\r\n  timely made. \r\nÂ Rule\r\n  38(b), SCRCP, provides: Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Any\r\n      party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by\r\n      serving upon the other parties a demand therefor[e] in writing at any time\r\n      after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the\r\n      service of the last pleading directed to such issue. Â Such demand may be\r\n      endorsed upon a pleading of the party.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Whites demanded\r\n  a jury trial in their September 21, 2005 answer to Mortgage Electronic's second\r\n  amended complaint when they asserted their fraud counterclaim for the first\r\n  time.Â  We find this demand for a jury trial was timely made because it was made\r\n  within ten days of the service of the last pleading.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court was in error in denying their demand for a jury trial on this basis.Â \r\n  However, we find the Whites were not entitled to a jury trial based on their\r\n  claim for fraud.[2]Â  \r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  the relevant question in determining the right to trial by jury is whether an\r\n  action is legal or equitable; there is no right to trial by jury for equitable\r\n  actions.&quot; Â Lester, 327 S.C. at 267, 491 S.E.2d at 242.Â  If the\r\n  complaint is equitable and the counterclaim legal and compulsory, the defendant\r\n  has the right to a jury trial on the counterclaim.Â  C&amp;S Real Estate\r\n    Servs., Inc. v. Massengale, 290 S.C. 299, 302, 350 S.E.2d 191, 193 (1986).Â \r\n  Therefore, in order to analyze the merits of the Whites' contention, we must\r\n  determine if the Whites' fraud counterclaim was: Â (1) compulsory or permissive,\r\n  and (2) legal or equitable in nature.Â  A counterclaim is compulsory &quot;if it\r\n  arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the\r\n  opposing party's claim.&quot;Â  Rule 13(a), SCRCP.Â  Here, the fraud counterclaim\r\n  arises out of the same mortgage transaction as Mortgage Electronic's claim.Â \r\n  Therefore, the Whites' fraud counterclaim is compulsory. Â \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A cause of action\r\n  for fraud may be at law or in equity, depending on the remedy sought.Â  W.\r\n    Gordon McCabe &amp; Co. v. Colleton Mercantile &amp; Mfg. Co., 106 S.C. 25,\r\n  31, 90 S.E. 161, 163 (1916) (&quot;[F]raud is cognizable at law as well as in\r\n  equity.&quot;); Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Serv., Inc., 338\r\n  S.C. 572, 580, 527 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;Actionable fraud is\r\n  an action at law unless an equitable remedy is sought.&quot;).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  their counterclaim against Mortgage Electronic, the Whites alleged:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    41.Â  The Defendant Whites have been\r\n      damaged as a result of the fraud on the part of Hugh M. Cooper and/or his\r\n      employees as the agent for the Plaintiff in that the fraud perpetrated by Hugh\r\n      M. Cooper has resulted in the filing of a foreclosure action against the\r\n      [Father] who was not otherwise involved in the transaction and who never spoke\r\n      with anyone involved in this transaction or signed any documents relating to\r\n      this transaction.Â  The [Father's] title is now clouded and he has had to incur\r\n      attorney's fees and expenses to defend this action and clear the title to his\r\n      real property. \r\n    42.Â  The Defendants White are informed\r\n      and believe that the Plaintiff, by and through its agent, Hugh M. Cooper, has\r\n      acted fraudulently and any and all mortgages or other encumbrances against the\r\n      real property of [Father] have been procured through fraud and are void.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Whites and Father prayed\r\n  for actual and punitive damages as well as for Mortgage Electronic to\r\n  immediately satisfy the mortgage and release any liens against the property.Â  \r\nThe primary relief\r\n  sought is to have the mortgage declared void. Rescission is an equitable remedy\r\n  that attempts to undo a contract from the beginning as if the contract had\r\n  never existed. Â Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 95, 594 S.E.2d\r\n  485, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Although the counterclaim includes a prayer for\r\n  actual and punitive damages, the only actual damages alleged are those of\r\n  Father in incurring attorney's fees and expenses to defend the action.Â  The\r\n  Whites failed to allege any damages they were seeking.Â Â  Although Father may\r\n  have been entitled to a jury trial, he failed to appeal the referee's order and\r\n  he is not a party to this appeal.Â  The Whites are the only appellants in this\r\n  matter, and as they are not entitled to a jury trial because they sought only\r\n  equitable relief, they are not aggrieved by the referee's denial of the demand\r\n  for a jury trial.Â  See Rule 201(b), SCACR (&quot;Only a party aggrieved\r\n  by an order, judgment, sentence or decision may appeal.&quot;); First Union\r\n    Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 565, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998) (&quot;A party cannot appeal from a decision which does not affect\r\n  his interest, however erroneous and prejudicial it may be to the rights and interests\r\n  of some other person.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the order of the referee denying\r\n  the demand for a jury trial is affirmed.Â  \r\nB.Â  Recusal\r\nThe\r\n  Whites maintain the special referee should have recused himself based on his\r\n  prior representation of Amanda's mother.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;A\r\n  judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might\r\n  reasonably be questioned, including instances where he has a personal bias or\r\n  prejudice against a party.&quot;Â  Koon v. Fares, 379 S.C. 150, 156, 666\r\n  S.E.2d 230, 234 (2008).Â  &quot;It is not sufficient for a party seeking\r\n  disqualification to simply allege bias; rather, the party must show some evidence\r\n  of bias or prejudice. Â If there is no evidence of judicial bias or prejudice, a\r\n  judge's failure to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal.&quot; Â Id. (citations omitted).Â  &quot;The fact a trial judge ultimately rules against a\r\n  litigant is not proof of prejudice by the judge, even if it is later held the\r\n  judge committed error in his rulings.&quot;Â  Mallett v. Mallett, 323\r\n  S.C. 141, 147, 473 S.E.2d 804, 808 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  denying the motion to recuse, the referee explained:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    In this\r\n      matter I was not aware â€“ didn't put it together that Amanda L. White was the\r\n      daughter of Debbie Cutter, who I previously represented . . . .Â  I'm not aware\r\n      of any bias or prejudice that I would have any negative things and at worse,\r\n      the other side could see as making me more predisposed since I do know them.Â \r\n      But in a small town, you're pretty much always going to know some of the\r\n      parties. Â \r\n    . . .\r\n      And looking from the rules of when a conflict and when recusal is required, the\r\n      elements that are required would seem to indicate it would have to be a direct\r\n      involvement in this particular case or these particular parties, not associated\r\n      family members.Â  So I don't believe that recusal is required, and I don't\r\n      believe that there's any bias or prejudice by me continuing on this one, so I'm\r\n      going to have to deny that motion.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Whites' only\r\n  evidence of bias is the special referee's ruling denying their right to a jury\r\n  trial and the judgment in favor of Mortgage Electronic.Â  The fact the referee\r\n  ruled against them is insufficient to show actual prejudice.Â  Our review of the\r\n  record reveals no indication of any actual bias on the part of the special\r\n  referee.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the referee's refusal to disqualify\r\n  himself.Â Â Â  \r\nC. Evidence\r\n  of Fraud\r\nThe\r\n  Whites argue the special referee erred in awarding judgment to Mortgage\r\n  Electronic &quot;in light of the fact that the note and the mortgage being\r\n  foreclosed were procured by fraud.&quot;Â  We find this issue is not preserved.Â \r\n  &quot;If the losing party has raised an issue in the [trial] court, but the\r\n  court fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review.&quot;Â  I'On,\r\n    L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).Â \r\n  Although the Whites raised the issue of fraud in their answer to Mortgage\r\n  Electronic's second amended complaint, the special referee did not rule on the\r\n  issue in his order.Â  As the Whites failed to file a motion to alter or amend\r\n  the judgment to preserve the fraud issue, the issue is not properly before this\r\n  court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  stated reasons, the order of the special referee is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\nKONDUROS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]See I'On\r\n  v.

Failure to appear at the docket meeting or jury\r\n  selection may result in dismissal of the case.Â  Please notify this court if you\r\n  [are] unable to appear at any of the above scheduled dates.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  docket meeting was held on August 11, and Watkins, who was not represented by counsel,\r\n  attended the meeting.Â  At the docket meeting, both parties were again given\r\n  notice the case was scheduled for trial on October 14, 2005, with jury selection\r\n  occurring on October 7, 2005.Â  Despite this notice, Watkins failed to appear at\r\n  jury selection on October 7, but a jury was selected in his absence.Â Â Â  \r\nWatkins\r\n  called the magistrate court the morning of October 7, while jury selection was\r\n  taking place, and left a voicemail message stating he had a conflict with the\r\n  October 14 trial date because he was scheduled for a criminal trial in\r\n  Georgetown County the week of October 10-15.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nWatkins\r\n  failed to leave a return telephone number on his message and did not receive a\r\n  follow-up telephone call from the magistrate court.Â  A few days later, however,\r\n  Watkins received a new roster (the December roster) from the magistrate court\r\n  dated October 4, 2005, stating his case was scheduled for the December term of\r\n  court.Â  Thus, Watkins believed his case had been continued, and he did not\r\n  appear at the magistrate court on October 14.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  case was not continued, however, and the case proceeded in Watkins' absence.Â \r\n  Upon Williams' request, Watkins' answer and request for a jury trial were\r\n  struck, and a bench trial ensued.Â  Williams prevailed, and damages in the\r\n  amount of $7,500 were assessed against Watkins.Â  \r\nWatkins\r\n  appealed the magistrate court's judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, to the\r\n  circuit court.[2]Â \r\n  At the hearing, Watkins brought the December roster to the circuit court's\r\n  attention.Â  Specifically, Watkins argued he was entitled to relief because he\r\n  relied upon the roster he received from the magistrate court subsequent to his telephone\r\n  call to the magistrate court regarding his conflict with the October 14 trial\r\n  date.Â  The circuit court sent the matter back to the magistrate court for\r\n  reconsideration in light of the December roster and other additional evidence\r\n  pertaining to Watkins' Georgetown criminal trial.Â  The magistrate court\r\n  considered the new evidence but affirmed the previous judgment and denied\r\n  Watkins relief under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP. Â Watkins appealed to the circuit\r\n  court, and the circuit court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Relief under\r\n  Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, lies within the sound discretion of the [circuit court]\r\n  and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Tobias\r\n    v. Rice, 379 S.C. 357, 362-63, 665 S.E.2d 216, 219 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  An\r\n  abuse of discretion arises where the judgment is controlled by an error of law\r\n  or is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id. at 363, 665 S.E.2d at 219.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWatkins argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to find the magistrate court abused its\r\n  discretion by refusing to grant his request for relief from the final judgment.\r\n  Â We agree.\r\nPursuant to Rule\r\n  60(b)(1), SCRCP,[3] a court may relieve a party of a final judgment for mistake, inadvertence,\r\n  surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  &quot;This rule is an appropriate remedy for\r\n  good faith mistakes of fact if all other applicable factors are met.&quot;Â  Hillman\r\n    v. Pinion, 347 S.C. 253, 256, 554 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  determining whether to grant relief, the factors to consider are: (1) the\r\n  timing of the motion for relief, (2) whether the party requesting relief has a\r\n  meritorious defense, and (3) the degree of prejudice to the opposing party if\r\n  relief is granted.Â  BB &amp; T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 553 n.1, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 501, 503 n.1 (2006) (citations omitted); Wham v. Shearson Lehman\r\n    Bros., Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501-02 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  order to gain relief under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, a party must first show a good\r\n  faith mistake of fact has been made, and in the present case, we find Watkins\r\n  has made that showing.Â  Watkins failed to appear on the date of trial because\r\n  of his good faith reliance on the December roster sent to him by the magistrate\r\n  court.Â  When a court sends a litigant notice of his or her term of court, that\r\n  litigant is bound by the notice and held accountable if he or she fails to\r\n  appear.Â  See State v. Goode, 299 S.C. 479, 482, 385 S.E.2d 844,\r\n  845-46 (1989) (&quot;General notice given by courts of general session as to\r\n  which term an individual will be tried in, is sufficient to enable that\r\n  individual to effectively waive his right to be present.&quot;); Ellis v.\r\n    State, 267 S.C. 257, 261, 227 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1976) (finding a defendant bound\r\n  by the notice of the term of court which the court provided); Tobias,\r\n  379 S.C. at 364, 665 S.E.2d at 220 (stating the party's attorney &quot;was mailed\r\n  and faxed notice of the mandatory roster meeting, thereby providing adequate\r\n  notice of trial&quot;); City of Aiken v. David Michael Koontz, 368 S.C.\r\n  542, 547, 629 S.E.2d 686, 689 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding the defendant was bound\r\n  by the notice of the term of court sent to him by the court).Â  This notion,\r\n  however, logically implies litigants are also entitled to rely on the notice of\r\n  their term of court sent to them by the court.Â Â  \r\nWe acknowledge that\r\n  Watkins did not act in the most prudent or procedurally correct manner when notifying\r\n  the magistrate court of his conflict and requesting a continuance.Â  Watkins did,\r\n  however, do exactly what the magistrate court's notice told him to do, i.e.,\r\n  &quot;notify [the magistrate] court if [he was] unable to appear . . .\r\n  .&quot; (emphasis added).Â  Further, despite Watkins' deficiencies, the\r\n  magistrate court sent Watkins a roster stating his case would be heard in the\r\n  December term of court. The magistrate court did not send Watkins any notice of\r\n  either his request for a continuance being denied or his case being dismissed,\r\n  as was the stated consequence for failing to appear at the docket meeting or\r\n  jury selection.Â  The only information Watkins received informed him his case\r\n  would be heard the week of December 12-16, 2005, and this information was\r\n  received after he left his voicemail message but prior to his trial date.Â \r\n  Although it is unclear who authorized the rescheduling, the magistrate court\r\n  was nonetheless directly involved in what appeared to be a granting of the\r\n  continuance. \r\nConsequently,\r\n  Watkins had every reason to believe his case had been continued and that he did\r\n  not need to appear in the magistrate court on October 14.Â  We find Watkins relied\r\n  in good faith on the December roster sent to him by the magistrate court.Â  \r\nAs to the timing of\r\n  the motion for relief, a party is required to make the motion &quot;within a\r\n  reasonable time, and . . . not more than one year after the judgment . . . was\r\n  entered . . . .&quot;Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Watkins sought relief as soon as he\r\n  discovered the trial had taken place in his absence and a judgment had been\r\n  entered against him.Â  The bench trial took place on October 14, 2005, and a\r\n  judgment was issued on October 19, 2005.Â  The magistrate court received\r\n  Watkins' &quot;Notice of Appeal&quot; on November 21, 2005.Â  Thus, Watkins made\r\n  his motion within the allotted time period.Â  \r\nWith respect to the\r\n  meritorious defense factor, the record contains evidence Watkins made a prima\r\n  facie showing of a meritorious defense to Williams' claims.Â  To establish a\r\n  meritorious defense, the party does not have to show he would prevail on the\r\n  merits.Â  McClurg v. Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 575, 671 S.E.2d 87, 93-94 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  Rather, a meritorious defense &quot;need be only one which is\r\n  worthy of a hearing or judicial inquiry because it raises a question of law\r\n  deserving of some investigation and discussion or a real controversy as to real\r\n  facts arising from conflicting or doubtful evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 575,\r\n  671 S.E.2d at 94 (quotations and citations omitted).Â  \r\nWilliams'\r\n  initial action claimed Watkins breached the parties' contract by incorrectly\r\n  applying the finishing and staining materials to the floor; breached implied\r\n  warranties of the contract when installing, finishing, and staining the floors;\r\n  and performed negligent and reckless work when finishing and staining the\r\n  floors.Â  Williams also claimed Sherwin Williams breached the implied warranty\r\n  of merchantability by supplying Watkins with finishing and staining materials\r\n  that were defective and inferior.Â  Watkins' reply, which was struck by the\r\n  magistrate court upon Watkins' failure to appear, denied all of the allegations\r\n  but stated Sherwin Williams breached its implied warranty of merchantability.Â  An\r\n  issue exists as to whether Watkins' work was the cause of the problems or\r\n  whether the materials Watkins was supplied with were the actual cause of the problems.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find this matter is worthy of a hearing, and while we do not\r\n  make any judgment as to whether Watkins will prevail on the merits, we find\r\n  Watkins presented a prima facie showing of a meritorious defense.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, we find the\r\n  degree of prejudice Williams will suffer if relief is granted is not so high as\r\n  to outweigh the other factors, and we note &quot;the law favors the resolution\r\n  of disputes based upon all parties having their day in court.&quot;Â  Id. at 580, 671 S.E.2d at 96 (Hearn, C.J., dissenting).Â  Williams was on notice of\r\n  Watkins' denial of the allegations and was therefore on notice to gather\r\n  evidence against Watkins, which he presented to the magistrate court.Â  Williams\r\n  was also on immediate notice of Watkins' appeal of the magistrate court's\r\n  judgment, putting him on notice to preserve and maintain that evidence.Â  Thus,\r\n  we see little prejudice in requiring Williams to proceed with a trial on the\r\n  merits.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  Watkins' good faith reliance on the December roster, his swift action to try to\r\n  remedy the situation following a trial in his absence, his showing of a\r\n  meritorious defense, and the lack of prejudice to Williams, we find the magistrate\r\n  court abused its discretion in denying Watkins' request for relief from the\r\n  final judgment.Â  See Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue,\r\n  345 S.C. 506, 512, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;Given [plaintiff's]\r\n  good faith mistake, its swift action to try to remedy the situation, the\r\n  existence of a meritorious defense, and the lack of prejudice to [the defendant],\r\n  we find the [Administrative Law Judge] abused his discretion by refusing to\r\n  reopen the case.&quot;).Â  We, therefore, find the circuit court erred in not\r\n  finding the magistrate court abused its discretion in denying Watkins' motion\r\n  for relief.Â  We reverse the circuit court's order and remand the case to the\r\n  magistrate court for a new trial on the merits. \r\nDue\r\n  to our disposition of this issue, we need not address the other issues raised\r\n  on appeal.Â  See Melton v. Olenik, 379 S.C. 45, 56, 664 S.E.2d\r\n  487, 493 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating when determination of an issue is\r\n  dispositive, other issues need not be addressed).Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED\r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT\r\nand LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Watkins purchased the finishing and staining\r\n  materials from Sherwin Williams, and Williams originally named the company as a\r\n  defendant.Â  Sherwin Williams was later dismissed because of Williams' failure\r\nto serve the company. Â \r\n[2] Although Watkins did not specifically state Rule\r\n  60(b)(1), SCRCP, as the basis of his appeal, the magistrate court found\r\n  Watkins' appeal &quot;was made in accordance with Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.&quot;Â \r\n  This finding was never appealed and, thus, is the law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee\r\n    Acquisition Fund, L.P. v.

We dismiss the appeal.\r\nFACTS\r\nWillie McCrea (Claimant) was employed as a firefighter for the\r\n  City of Georgetown (Employer).Â  In December 2003, Claimant was injured as he\r\n  attempted to gain access to a house that was on fire by ramming his left hip\r\n  and left leg into the door.Â  Employer admitted Claimant sustained an injury but\r\n  denied Claimant suffered any significant impairment as a result of this\r\n  injury.Â  \r\nIn September 2005, Claimant responded to an automobile accident.Â \r\n  Claimant allegedly suffered an injury to his neck and back as a result of\r\n  placing an injured individual onto a backboard and lifting this person into an\r\n  ambulance.Â  Following this incident, Employer commenced payment of temporary\r\n  total disability benefits and provided for medical treatment until August\r\n  2006.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt that time, Employer filed a Form 21 seeking to stop payment of\r\n  temporary disability benefits.Â  In connection with the 2003 injury, Employer\r\n  contended Claimant had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI).Â  With respect\r\n  to the 2005 injury, Employer argued Claimant had been provided adequate medical\r\n  care, and Claimant had reached MMI.Â  \r\nConversely, Claimant alleged he had yet to reach MMI and sought\r\n  further medical treatment.Â  Alternatively, Claimant argued if he were found to\r\n  be at MMI, then he should be awarded compensation for permanent and total\r\n  disability and lifetime causally related medical treatment.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Claimant claimed a causally related and compensable psychological condition as\r\n  a result of either or both the 2003 and 2005 injuries.Â  Moreover, Claimant\r\n  alleged an injury to his left wrist involving carpal tunnel syndrome as a result\r\n  of the 2005 accident.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner held a hearing in October 2006, and issued\r\n  an order in December 2006.Â  In this order, the single commissioner concluded\r\n  Claimant had reached MMI for both injuries, Claimant's alleged psychological\r\n  condition was not related to either the 2003 or 2005 injuries, Claimant had not\r\n  sustained permanent disability or loss of use to any scheduled body part, and\r\n  Claimant's alleged carpal tunnel syndrome was not related to the 2005\r\n  accident.Â  The single commissioner granted Employer's stop payment request and\r\n  relieved Employer of any liability for further medical treatment.Â  Claimant\r\n  appealed this decision to the Commission, and the Commission affirmed the\r\n  single commissioner's decision in full.Â  Thereafter, Claimant appealed to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed the Commission and remanded the case\r\n  so additional testimony and evidence could be entered into the record.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of a decision\r\n  of an administrative agency.&quot;Â  Clark v. Aiken County Gov't, 366\r\n  S.C. 102, 107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;Any review of the [C]ommission's factual\r\n  findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.&quot;Â  Lockridge\r\n    v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court will not overturn a\r\n  decision by the Commission unless the determination is unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero,\r\n  363 S.C. 80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially,\r\n  we must determine the appealability of the circuit court's order.Â  &quot;[A]n\r\n  order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings before\r\n  an administrative agency is not directly appealable.&quot;Â  Foggie v. Gen.\r\n    Elec. Co., 376 S.C. 384, 388-89, 656 S.E.2d 395, 397-98 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  In\r\n  some situations remand orders from the circuit court\r\n  to the Commission may be immediately appealable.Â  Id.Â  Namely, if the circuit court's order is a &quot;final\r\n  judgment,&quot; then it is immediately appealable. Â Id. \r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  an order is a final judgment on one or more issues if it constitutes an\r\n  ultimate decision on the merits.&quot;Â  Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc.,\r\n  366 S.C. 379, 387, 622 S.E.2d 546, 551 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;An order\r\n  involves the merits if it finally determines some substantial matter forming\r\n  the whole or part of some cause of action or defense in the case.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the current case, the circuit court remanded the case to the\r\n  Commission for additional proceedings.Â  The circuit court based its decision on\r\n  the stipulations the parties had entered into prior to the hearing before the\r\n  single commissioner.Â  These stipulations included that Employer had admitted the\r\n  2003 and 2005 accidents occurred.Â  \r\nEmployer conceded Claimant suffered injuries to his neck and spine\r\n  arising out of the 2005 accident.Â  The circuit court found the single commissioner\r\n  and the Commission disregarded the stipulations of the parties when the single\r\n  commissioner concluded, after the record had closed, &quot;I frankly question\r\n  whether . . . Claimant sustained the [2005] accident at all; however[,] given\r\n  the [Employer's] good faith acceptance of the claim, the order proceeds under\r\n  the assumption and theory that the September 2005 accident in fact\r\n  occurred.&quot;Â  According to Claimant, had he known the single commissioner\r\n  planned to proceed only under the theory rather than accepting as fact he was\r\n  injured, he would have put testimony into evidence regarding the nature and\r\n  severity of the injuries.Â  The circuit court found the single commissioner and\r\n  the Commission ignored the fact the parties had agreed Claimant had suffered\r\n  injuries from the accidents.Â  \r\nA stipulation is an agreement,\r\n  admission, or concession made in judicial proceedings by the parties or their\r\n  attorneys and is binding upon\r\n  those who make them.Â  State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 94-95, 623 S.E.2d\r\n  840, 846 (Ct. App. 2005). The court\r\n  must accept stipulations as binding upon the parties.Â  Id.Â  In the present\r\n  case, the single commissioner and the Commission failed to recognize the fact\r\n  that stipulations are binding on parties as well as the court.Â  Consequently,\r\n  they failed to accept as a legally binding fact Claimant suffered injuries from\r\n  the 2005 accident.Â  \r\nThe circuit court remanded the case to the Commission to allow Employer,\r\n  if it deemed advisable, to withdraw its stipulations.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  circuit court remanded the case to allow Claimant to submit additional\r\n  testimony as to the nature of the accidents and injuries incurred.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the circuit court did not conclude Claimant did not have a\r\n  compensable injury.Â  Additionally, the circuit court did not rule Claimant had\r\n  not reached MMI.Â  The circuit court did not make a final determination\r\n  regarding whether Claimant was totally and permanently disabled, nor did it\r\n  advise the Commission that Employer was not entitled to stop payments.Â Â  The\r\n  circuit court did not instruct the Commission that Claimant had reached MMI or\r\n  indicate to the Commission that Claimant's alleged psychological condition was\r\n  not related to either the 2003 or 2005 injuries.Â  The circuit court merely\r\n  allowed the parties to submit additional testimony and evidence as they deem\r\n  appropriate.Â  \r\nThe circuit court's order was not a final judgment and did not\r\n  involve the merits of the case.Â  The circuit court remanded the case to the\r\n  Commission so that additional evidence could be entered into the record without\r\n  determining whether Claimant was disabled or whether Employer was entitled to\r\n  stop payments.Â  As such, this appeal is interlocutory.Â  See Foggie, 376\r\n  S.C. at 389, 656 S.E.2d at 398 (holding an appeal was interlocutory where the\r\n  circuit court did not make a final determination regarding whether or not a\r\n  claimant was totally and permanently disabled and remanded the case for\r\n  reconsideration by the Commission); Brown, 366 S.C. at 388, 622 S.E.2d at 551 (finding that\r\n  because the circuit court's order mandated apportionment, the court left the\r\n  percentage of apportionment to the Commission on remand, so the Commission\r\n  would have no choice but to allocate some part of the claimant's disability to\r\n  the non-compensable cause, thus the circuit court's order constituted a final\r\n  decision on the issue of apportionment, making it appealable). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the appeal is dismissed.Â Â  \r\nSHORT\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4592","title":"Weston v.

Wilson, both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.: Monica\r\n  Weston appeals the circuit court's grant of summary judgment and dismissal of\r\n  Counts II, V, and VI of her tort action against CIBA Vision (CIBA).Â  On appeal,\r\n  she argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because (1) the\r\n  circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the contact lenses at\r\n  issue were federally regulated medical devices, (2) a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact existed, and (3) there was neither a showing nor a finding that any South\r\n  Carolina law conflicted with federal law.Â  In addition, Weston argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in refusing to amend or clarify certain provisions of its\r\n  summary judgment order.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nCIBA\r\n  sells contact lenses under the trade name FreshLook Colors.Â  FreshLook Colors\r\n  contact lenses can be worn to change the color or appearance of the eye.Â  These\r\n  contact lenses, however, are also capable of correcting nearsightedness,\r\n  farsightedness, and astigmatism.Â  FreshLook Colors contact lenses come in a\r\n  range of powers from (-)20.00 diopters to (+)20.00 diopters.Â  At the zero-power\r\n  point in the range, the lenses are &quot;non-corrective&quot; or &quot;plano&quot;\r\n  lenses, but the lenses can still have medical and physiological effects.Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  March 2004, Weston purchased two pairs of FreshLook Colors contact lenses at\r\n  the zero-power point from Kim's Dollar Store (Kim's).[1]Â \r\n  Along with changing the eye color, the contact lenses Weston purchased had UV\r\n  protection and were marked with a &quot;prescription only&quot; symbol.Â  Kim's\r\n  was not authorized to sell or distribute the contact lenses and had no\r\n  affiliation with CIBA.Â  Additionally, Weston did not have a prescription for\r\n  the contact lenses.Â  Weston was given no instructions concerning the care,\r\n  cleaning, or usage of the lenses with her purchase, nor was she informed of the\r\n  necessity of a medical prescription and oversight for usage of the contact\r\n  lenses.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  wearing a pair of the FreshLook Colors contact lenses, Weston developed an eye\r\n  infection, which led to the temporary loss of vision in her left eye.Â  Weston\r\n  then brought this action against Kim's and CIBA alleging six causes of action:\r\n  (1) negligence per se for selling misbranded contact lenses; (2) negligence in\r\n  the manufacture, sale and/or distribution of contact lenses, and in failing to\r\n  provide adequate warnings and instructions; (3) breach of implied warranty of\r\n  merchantability and fitness because the lenses were not safely labeled; (4)\r\n  strict liability for placing defectively labeled products into the stream of commerce;\r\n  (5) sale of a defective product due to inadequate warnings; and (6) violation\r\n  of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act by committing an unfair or\r\n  deceptive act or practice, including inadequate labeling and warnings, in the\r\n  conduct of trade or commerce.Â  CIBA's answer generally denied Weston's\r\n  allegations and asserted additional defenses.Â  CIBA also made a motion for\r\n  summary judgment on the basis that the majority of Weston's claims and legal\r\n  theories were subject to federal preemption pursuant to the Medical Device\r\n  Amendments of 1976 (MDA) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 301-399a (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2008) (FDCA).Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing on the matter, the circuit court granted CIBA's motion.Â  The circuit\r\n  court found CIBA was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of federal\r\n  preemption on all actions dependent on warning, labeling, design, marketing,\r\n  misbranding, or other similar claims.Â  The circuit court also stated CIBA could\r\n  file additional motions to test the viability of the remaining causes of\r\n  action.Â  Finally, the circuit court restricted Weston from pursuing any\r\n  additional discovery, without further court order, on the issues of warnings,\r\n  labeling, packaging, use instructions, product design, marketing, or illegal\r\n  sales of contact lenses.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Englert,\r\n    Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 302, 433 S.E.2d 871, 873 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1993).Â  This standard requires all facts and reasonable inferences to be\r\n  drawn therefrom to be viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant.Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, &quot;[a]n appellate court may decide questions of law with no\r\n  particular deference to the trial court.&quot;Â  In re Campbell, 379 S.C.\r\n  593, 599, 666 S.E.2d 908, 911 (2008).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWeston\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because (1) the\r\n  circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the contact lenses at\r\n  issue were federally regulated medical devices, (2) a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact existed, and (3) there was neither a showing nor a finding that any South\r\n  Carolina law conflicted with federal law.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Preemption \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that federal law\r\n  &quot;shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution\r\n  or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.&quot;Â  U.S. Const. art.\r\n  VI. Thus, as has been clear since the Supreme Court's decision in M'Culloch\r\n    v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.), 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), any state law\r\n  that conflicts with federal law is &quot;without effect.&quot; Cipollone v.\r\n    Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407\r\n  (1992) (citing Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746, 101 S.Ct. 2114,\r\n  68 L.Ed.2d 576 (1981)).\r\n\t\tIn\r\n  applying the Supremacy Clause, courts &quot;start with the assumption that the\r\n  historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by [a] Federal\r\n  Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.&quot; Medtronic\r\n    v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (citing\r\n\t\tRice\r\n      v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447\r\n  (1947)). Therefore, &quot; '[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate\r\n  touchstone' in every pre-emption case.&quot; Id.

Ford Motor Co., 209 F.3d 886, 891 (6th Cir. 2000)).\r\n&quot;The\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the [c]ourt.&quot;Â  In re Campbell, 379 S.C. 593,\r\n    599, 666 S.E.2d 908, 910-11 (2008); accord Anderson v. Sara Lee Corp.,\r\n    508 F.3d 181, 191 (4th Cir. 2007) (holding whether federal statute preempts\r\n  state law is a question of law).Â  The MDA generally preempts state law that\r\n  affects medical devices covered by the MDA unless an exemption is granted:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[N]o\r\n  State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect\r\n  with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement â€“ \r\n\t(1)\r\n  which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this\r\n  chapter to the device, and \r\n\t(2)\r\n  which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other\r\n  matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\r\n\r\n21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 360k(a) (West\r\n  1999).Â  Under the FDCA, a &quot;device&quot; is:\r\n\r\n\t[A]n\r\n  instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro\r\n  reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or\r\n  accessory, which is . . . intended for use . . . in the cure, mitigation,\r\n  treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or . . . intended\r\n  to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals,\r\n  and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical\r\n  action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent\r\n  upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 321(h) (West\r\n  1999).Â  A &quot;cosmetic&quot; is an article, or a component thereof,\r\n  &quot;intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into,\r\n  or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing,\r\n  beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.&quot;Â  21\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 321(i) (West 1999).Â  Federal law contemplates that a regulated\r\n  device may simultaneously be classified as a cosmetic.Â  21 C.F.R. Â§ 700.3 (1981)\r\n  (&quot;Any cosmetic product which is also a drug or device or component thereof\r\n  is also subject to the requirements of Chapter V [of the FDCA].&quot;).Â  \r\nWeston\r\n  casts her argument as an attack on jurisdiction, presumably over the subject\r\n  matter of her suit.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction is &quot;the power of a court\r\n  to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\n  question belong.&quot;Â  McCullar v. Estate of Campbell, 381 S.C. 205,\r\n  206, 672 S.E.2d 784, 784 (2009).Â  Tort claims are within the jurisdiction of\r\n  the circuit court.Â  Id.Â  When federal law seats exclusive jurisdiction over\r\n  a particular type of claim in the federal\r\n  courts, South Carolina courts must examine the federal law to determine whether\r\n  it preempts state law.Â  Griggs v. S.C.\r\n    Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 320 S.C. 127,\r\n  129, 463 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1995).Â  Weston\r\n  appears to argue the circuit court was somehow deprived of the authority to determine whether federal law preempted state law\r\n  while presumably retaining the authority to award Weston damages for her loss.Â \r\n  This argument is meritless.Â  Interpreting federal statutes is an essential step\r\n  in determining whether federal law preempts state law.Â  The question whether\r\n  CIBA's FreshLook Colors contact lenses fit the statutory definition of medical\r\n  devices, thus triggering the MDA's provision preempting state law, is properly\r\n  a question of law for the circuit court.Â  Consequently, the circuit court did\r\n  not err in construing federal law to determine it preempted South Carolina law\r\n  in this matter.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Background:Â \r\n  Federal Regulation of Contact Lenses\r\nFor\r\n  regulation purposes, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies medical\r\n  devices into three categories: Class I, Class II, and Class III.Â  21 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  360c (West 1999).Â  The FDA applies different levels of scrutiny and regulation\r\n  to each category in order to establish the safety and effectiveness of a\r\n  medical device.Â  Id.Â  Class III medical devices receive the highest\r\n  level of scrutiny and may only be marketed pursuant to the FDA's premarket\r\n  approval (PMA) process.Â  21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 360e (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  The\r\n  PMA process is rigorous, and it begins with the manufacturer of the medical\r\n  device submitting detailed information to the FDA regarding the safety and\r\n  efficacy of the device.Â  Riegel v. Medtronic, 128 S. Ct. 999, 1004\r\n  (2008).Â  The FDA spends an average of one thousand, two hundred hours reviewing\r\n  all of the submitted information and &quot;grants [PMA] only if it finds there\r\n  is a 'reasonable assurance' of the device's 'safety and effectiveness.'&quot;Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a product receives PMA, &quot;the MDA forbids the manufacturer to make, without\r\n  FDA permission, changes in design specifications, manufacturing processes,\r\n  labeling, or any other attribute, that would affect safety or effectiveness.&quot;Â  Id. at 1005.Â  If such changes are to be made, the manufacturer may\r\n  submit a supplemental PMA application to the FDA, which is evaluated in a\r\n  similar fashion as the initial application.Â  Id.Â  This supplemental PMA\r\n  process obviates the need to submit redundant information to the FDA regarding\r\n  design features, manufacturing processes, or labeling that have already been\r\n  approved by the FDA, because the entirety of the PMA, including all\r\n  supplements, are before the FDA at the time the supplement is reviewed.Â  51\r\n  Fed. Reg. 26,342, 26,354 (1986).Â  Following PMA, the FDA continues to subject\r\n  the medical devices to reporting requirements.Â  Riegel, 128 S. Ct. at\r\n  1005.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to the affidavit of CIBA's expert witness Philip Phillips, former Deputy\r\n  Director for Science and Regulatory Policy in the Office of Device Evaluation\r\n  for the FDA, all soft contact lenses automatically\r\n  became Class III medical devices when the MDA was implemented in 1976.Â  In\r\n  1994, the FDA drew a distinction between daily wear and extended wear soft\r\n  contact lenses.Â  Daily wear lenses were reclassified as Class II medical\r\n  devices while extended wear lenses remained Class III medical devices.Â  These\r\n  classifications applied to both plano lenses and corrective lenses.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2003, the FDA issued Import Alert 86-10, which allowed for the possibility of\r\n  obtaining cosmetic classification, under certain circumstances, for plano\r\n  contact lenses intended solely for the decorative purpose of changing the eye\r\n  color.Â  With a cosmetic classification, the lenses could be sold without having\r\n  to undergo the rigorous PMA process.Â  If contact lenses were marketed with any\r\n  claims of effecting physical or physiological changes, then even plano contact\r\n  lenses that change the color of the eye would continue to be regulated as\r\n  medical devices by the FDA.Â  The Import Alert provided a claim of sunscreen\r\n  protection as an example of a claim that would disqualify a product as a\r\n  cosmetic.Â  In 2005, Congress eliminated the carve-out set forth in Import Alert\r\n  86-10 by making all contact lenses, even solely decorative contact lenses,\r\n  subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA.Â  21 U.S.C.A.\r\n  Â§&nbsp;360j(n)(1) (West Supp. 2008).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Summary\r\n  Judgment \r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP, provides: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t[Summary\r\n  judgment] shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp; Genuine\r\n  Issue of Material Fact\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to\r\n  the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Donahue v. Multimedia, Inc., 362 S.C. 331,\r\n  337, 608 S.E.2d 162, 165 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This court, however, is not &quot;required\r\n  to single out some one morsel of evidence . . . to create an issue of fact that\r\n  is not genuine.&quot;Â  Englert, 315 S.C. at 302, 433 S.E.2d at 873\r\n  (quotations and citations omitted).Â  Generally, only &quot;a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence&quot; is required to defeat a motion for summary judgment when the\r\n  burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Hancock v. Mid-South\r\n    Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  However, &quot;in\r\n  cases applying federal law, . . . the non-moving party must submit more than a\r\n  mere scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Id. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d 803.Â  \r\nWeston asserts a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether FreshLook Colors contact\r\n  lenses were subject to regulation by the FDA as a Class III medical device.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Weston argues while PMA exists for all FreshLook Colors contact lenses with a\r\n  diopter of greater or less than zero, the FreshLook Colors PMA excluded plano\r\n  lenses because they have no effect on visual acuity.Â  In support, Weston points\r\n  to language in letters from the Department\r\n  of Health and Human Services (DHHS) addressing\r\n  a PMA supplement stating FreshLook Colors contact lenses were &quot;indicated\r\n  for the correction of visual acuity.&quot;Â  This indication, Weston reasons,\r\n  excludes the lenses she purchased because, by definition, plano lenses do not correct\r\n  vision.Â  Furthermore, according to Weston, CIBA's marketing of the plano\r\n  FreshLook Colors lenses for beautification rather than for correction of visual\r\n  acuity invalidates any PMA that might have applied.Â  We find this argument\r\n  unpersuasive.Â Â  \r\nInitially, we find FreshLook Colors contact lenses fit the FDCA's definition of a device, in that\r\n  each lens is an &quot;instrument . . . or other similar or related article . .\r\n  . intended for use . . . in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of\r\n  disease, in man or other animals, or . . . intended to affect the structure or\r\n  any function of the body of man . . . .&quot;Â  21 U.S.C.A. Â§&nbsp;321(h).Â  As\r\n  CIBA points out, these lenses contain UV protection for the prevention of\r\n  disease, and as extended-wear lenses, they affect the structure of the eye.Â \r\n  Furthermore, we find CIBA presented uncontradicted competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, and\r\n  documentation, indicating FreshLook Colors contact lenses were Class III\r\n  medical devices, subject to and approved by the FDA pursuant to the PMA\r\n  process.Â  \r\nWeston's expert\r\n  witness, Dr. Suzanne Parisian, acknowledged the PMA history for FreshLook\r\n  Colors contact lenses began with the original 1983 PMA.Â  She further\r\n  acknowledged through PMA Supplement 39 the FDA allowed FreshLook Colors UV to\r\n  include the UV symbol on its labeling.Â  CIBA then presented additional\r\n  extensive evidence that through the supplemental PMA process the FreshLook\r\n  Colors contact lenses in question received FDA approval through Supplement 39.Â  \r\nTwo\r\n  letters from the DHHS discussed Supplement 39.Â  The first letter, dated January\r\n  25, 1996, referenced &quot;P830037/S39 FreshLook Colors UV and FreshLook\r\n  LiteTint UV.&quot;Â  This letter read:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food and Drug\r\n  Administration (FDA) has completed its evaluation of your premarket approval\r\n  application (PMA) supplement, which requested approval for incorporating an\r\n  ultra-violet absorber into the above referenced lenses.Â  Based upon the\r\n  information submitted, the PMA supplement is approved subject to the conditions\r\n  described below and in the &quot;Conditions of Approval&quot; (enclosed).Â  You\r\n  may begin commercial distribution of the devices as modified by your PMA\r\n  supplement upon receipt of this letter.\r\n\r\nThe second DHHS\r\n  letter, dated August 22, 2003, referenced two PMA supplements, one being &quot;P830037/S39\r\n  FreshLook Colors UV and FreshLook LiteTint UV (phemfilcon A) UV Soft\r\n  (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  This letter stated:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food and Drug\r\n  Administration (FDA) completed its evaluation of your premarket approval\r\n  application (PMA) supplement[] referenced above and issued [an] approval\r\n  order[] on . . . January 25, 1996[,] for Supplement 39.Â  We inadvertently made\r\n  an error by not including the appropriate restricted device conditions of\r\n  approval that apply to all UV absorbing contact lenses.\r\n\r\nThe letter went on to provide\r\n  the restrictions and warnings that applied to the referenced contact lenses.Â  However,\r\n  despite the thoroughness with which the regulatory agencies reviewed CIBA's\r\n  submissions, we find no indication in the record the DHHS or the FDA excluded\r\n  any specific diopter or diopter range from the applicable PMA or its\r\n  supplements.Â  By contrast, both the regulatory agencies and CIBA treated the\r\n  plano lenses no differently than their corrective counterparts.Â  Plano lenses\r\n  were included in the approved diopter range, were provided to the regulatory\r\n  agencies as exemplars of the FreshLook Colors product, and were accompanied by\r\n  all the same warnings, labels, and information as corrective FreshLook Colors\r\n  lenses.\r\nIn addition to this documentation, CIBA presented\r\n  expert witnesses who confirmed the FreshLook Colors contact lenses in question\r\n  were approved and regulated by the FDA.Â  Paul Oris, Head of Global Regulatory\r\n  Affairs for CIBA, testified at his deposition that CIBA always treated\r\n  FreshLook lenses as medical devices and that they were always approved through\r\n  the PMA process.[3]Â \r\n  He stated, &quot;All [FreshLook Colors] contact lenses, including plano, were\r\n  approved by the FDA in the PMA process.&quot;Â  Oris also explained the &quot;Rx\r\n  only&quot; symbol on the package of the contact lenses at issue indicated the\r\n  contacts were medical devices that should only be sold by prescription.Â  Oris\r\n  further stated the package insert that was meant to accompany all FreshLook\r\n  Colors contact lenses was drafted by CIBA pursuant to a PMA supplement.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCIBA's\r\n  expert witness Phillips confirmed in his deposition that the package insert\r\n  that was to be included with all FreshLook Colors contact lenses was reviewed\r\n  and approved by the FDA.Â  Phillips stated the package insert that was submitted\r\n  and approved by the FDA as part of the FDA's PMA oversight function was &quot;probably\r\n  what [the] FDA looked at closer than any other aspect of labeling.&quot;Â  He\r\n  further stated this FDA-approved insert applied to the specific contact lenses\r\n  at issue.Â  \r\nPhillips\r\n  provided further support that FreshLook Colors contact lenses were approved and\r\n  regulated by the FDA and were unaffected by Import Alert 86-10 in his\r\n  affidavit, which asserted:\r\n\r\n\tFreshLook\r\n  Colors Lenses of the type [at issue] are Class III medical devices.Â  This would\r\n  include plano (zero power) FreshLook Colors lenses in 2004. . . . FreshLook\r\n  Colors plano (zero power) contact lenses are approved in the Premarket Approval\r\n  (PMA) P830037 and the relevant supplements thereto. . . . CIBA['s] . . . PMA\r\n  approval was in accord with all applicable FDA requirements and resulted in\r\n  legitimate approval of CIBA Vision FreshLook Colors contact lenses as Class III\r\n  medical devices.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In PMA Supplement 33, [CIBA] obtained\r\n  approval from the FDA to incorporate the UV absorber ingredient into FreshLook\r\n  Colors lenses.Â  As of at least July 2003, the FDA approved [CIBA] package\r\n  insert for FreshLook Colors lenses included significant information about UV\r\n  absorbing properties and UV protection. . . . UV protection[] would constitute\r\n  a &quot;medical use&quot; under Import Alert 86-10 and therefore further make\r\n  FreshLook Colors plano lenses ineligible for regulation as a &quot;cosmetic.&quot;\r\n  . . . [CIBA's] packaging, product information, warnings and labeling for\r\n  FreshLook Colors contact lenses[] were in accordance with the FDA's PMA and PMA\r\n  Supplement approvals and the agency's labeling regulation. . . . Throughout\r\n  2004, [CIBA] compliance with the Conditions of Approval, good manufacturing\r\n  practices, medical device reporting requirements and other requirements\r\n  reviewed by FDA were sufficient to maintain the PMA approval status for\r\n  FreshLook Colors contact lenses.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the record contains ample discussion and evidence on the distinction between a\r\n  cosmetic and a medical device.Â  When discussing whether plano color contact\r\n  lenses used to enhance the color of the eye are currently considered cosmetics,\r\n  as the exception in Import Alert 86-10 had provided, Dr. Parisian explained, &quot;Just\r\n  because [the FDA] put [the lenses] under the device regulations doesn't change\r\n  that [the lenses are] still a cosmetic. . . . [The lenses are] a cosmetic, but\r\n  [they are] being regulated under medical device regulation.&quot;Â  When asked\r\n  whether the FDA would consider plano color contact lenses intended to enhance\r\n  the color of the eye for extended wear to be medical devices, Dr. Parisian\r\n  stated, &quot;[The FDA] could, depending on the [manufacturer's] claims.&quot;Â  \r\nThis notion of plano color contact lenses being both a cosmetic and a medical device was in\r\n  complete accord with the evidence presented by CIBA and with federal law.Â \r\n  Phillips explained in both his deposition and his affidavit that classification\r\n  as a cosmetic and a medical device was not mutually exclusive.Â  Further, CIBA\r\n  presented the circuit court with a notice published in the Federal Register\r\n  noting, &quot;[The] FDA regulates as devices noncorrective tinted contact\r\n  lenses that are expressly promoted only for their cosmetic effect of enhancing\r\n  eye color because they have physiological effects on the eye.&quot;Â  60 Fed.\r\n  Reg. 41,453 (1995). \r\nMoreover, while\r\n  Weston presented much discussion regarding the cosmetic purposes of FreshLook\r\n  Colors contact lenses, the record was also replete with evidence of their\r\n  medical, health, or therapeutic use and their physical or physiological\r\n  effects, which requires the lenses to be regulated as medical devices.Â  See 21 C.F.R. Â§ 700.3(b) (&quot;Any cosmetic product which is also a drug or device\r\n  or component thereof is also subject to the requirements of Chapter V of the\r\n  [FDCA].&quot;).Â  Although Kim's did not provide Weston with the package insert\r\n  intended to accompany the FreshLook Colors contact lenses she purchased, the\r\n  lenses did have an applicable package insert that was in accord with FDA\r\n  requirements and obtained FDA approval.Â  This insert included the following &quot;Indications\r\n  (Uses)&quot; for the lenses: &quot;FreshLook soft contact lenses with\r\n  UV-absorbing monomer help protect against transmission of harmful UV radiation\r\n  to the cornea and into the eye,&quot; and &quot;The lenses may be prescribed\r\n  for Daily Wear or Extended Wear . . . .&quot;Â  The insert goes on to note, &quot;Long\r\n  term exposure to UV radiation is one of the risk factors associated with\r\n  cataracts. . . . UV-absorbing contact lenses help provide protection against\r\n  harmful UV radiation.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nThis\r\n  FDA approved language in the package insert clearly conveys the FreshLook\r\n  Colors contact lenses in question had medical or therapeutic purposes and\r\n  physiological effects on the eye, thus making the lenses medical devices.Â  See 21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 321(h) (&quot;The term 'device' . . . means an instrument,\r\n  apparatus, implement, . . . or other similar or related article, . . . which is\r\n  . . . intended for use . . . in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention\r\n  of disease, . . . or intended to affect the structure or any function of the\r\n  body . . . .&quot;).Â  Weston's own expert witness did not contradict this\r\n  conclusion.Â  Dr. Parisian noted the UV symbol on the contact lenses' package\r\n  and the PMA supplement information established the lenses in question contained\r\n  a product to help block UV rays from the sun that can be harmful to the human\r\n  eye.Â  Dr. Parisian also acknowledged that when contact lenses are marketed &quot;for\r\n  extended wear, then it's a Class III [medical device].&quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhile these stated\r\n  uses and warnings contained on both the packaging and package insert of FreshLook Colors contact lenses classify the lenses as medical devices subject\r\n  to the MDA, they also indicate Import Alert 86-10's inapplicability to the\r\n  contact lenses.Â  Import Alert 86-10 stated it applied to color contact lenses &quot;[p]rovided\r\n  they are not marketed with claims that they effect physical or physiological\r\n  change . . . . [Import Alert 86-10] does not cover contact lenses that are\r\n  intended for . . . medical or therapeutic use and that are, therefore, properly\r\n  regulated as medical devices under the [FDCA].&quot;Â  The evidence demonstrates\r\n  the FreshLook Colors contact lenses in question effect physiological changes\r\n  and have medical or therapeutic uses, resulting in no change of classification\r\n  following Import Alert 86-10.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the documents, depositions, affidavits, and all other evidence in the\r\n  record, we find CIBA carried its burden of demonstrating no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact existed as to whether FreshLook Colors contact lenses of all\r\n  diopters underwent the rigorous PMA process and were, therefore, subject to\r\n  regulation by the FDA.Â  See Englert, 315 S.C. at 302, 433 S.E.2d\r\n  at 873 (stating this court views all facts and reasonable inferences in light\r\n  most favorable to appellant but is not &quot;required to single out some one\r\n  morsel of evidence . . . to create an issue of fact that is not genuine&quot;); see generally Weinberger v. Bentex Pharms., Inc., 412 U.S.\r\n  645, 653 (1973) (explaining the FDA has jurisdiction to decide the status or\r\n  class of a medical product).Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Judgment\r\n  as a Matter of Law\r\nHaving\r\n  reached this conclusion, we must address the issue of whether Weston's claims\r\n  are subject to federal preemption, thereby entitling CIBA to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  See 21 U.S.C.A. Â§&nbsp;360k(a) (explaining the MDA\r\n  expressly preempts certain state law requirements governing medical devices); Quigley\r\n    v. Rider, 357 S.C. 477, 483, 593 S.E.2d 476, 479 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n  (explaining when state law and federal law conflict, the former must give\r\n  way).Â  Whether a federal statute preempts\r\n  state law is a question of law for the court to decide.Â  See Campbell,\r\n  379 S.C. at 599, 666 S.E.2d at 910-11; accord Anderson, 508 F.3d at\r\n  191.Â  PMA approval of a medical device by\r\n  the FDA results in device-specific requirements that preempt inconsistent state\r\n  requirements, including those sought to be imposed through tort liability.Â  Riegel,\r\n  128 S. Ct. at 1007-08; Horn v. Thoratec Corp., 376 F.3d 163, 169 (3rd\r\n  Cir. 2004); Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., 254 F.3d 573, 584 (5th Cir.\r\n  2001).Â  Specifically, the MDA prohibits States from imposing on devices\r\n  intended for human use &quot;any requirement (1) which is different from, or in\r\n  addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and\r\n  (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other\r\n  matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.&quot;Â \r\n  21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 360k(a).Â  This preemption clause has been read to extend to state\r\n  tort claims.Â  Riegel, 128 S. Ct. at 1008.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court recently held &quot;common-law causes of action for\r\n  negligence and strict liability do impose 'requirement[s]' and would be pre-empted\r\n  by federal requirements specific to a medical device.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  1007.Â  The Supreme Court stated, &quot;Absent other indication, reference to a\r\n  State's 'requirements' includes its common-law duties.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  1008.Â  The Supreme Court reasoned:\r\n\r\n\t[C]ommon-law\r\n  liability is &quot;premised on the existence of a legal duty,&quot; and a tort\r\n  judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a state-law\r\n  obligation. . . . And while the common-law remedy is limited to damages, a\r\n  liability award &quot;can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of\r\n  governing conduct and controlling policy.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â \r\n  Further, the Supreme Court agreed that &quot;it is implausible that the MDA was\r\n  meant to 'grant greater power (to set state standards different from, or in\r\n  addition to federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials\r\n  acting through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes.'&quot;[4]Â  Id.Â  (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the circuit court correctly applied the doctrine of federal\r\n  preemption because a jury's acceptance of the disputed claims could result in\r\n  different or additional requirements from the federal requirements.Â  A jury\r\n  could potentially find additional or different labeling is appropriate for the\r\n  FreshLook Colors contact lenses, which would affect the model the FDA has\r\n  already approved.Â  This is not permissible.Â  See id. (&quot;State\r\n  tort law that requires a manufacturer's catheters to be safer, but hence less effective,\r\n  than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than\r\n  state regulatory law to the same effect.&quot;).Â  Additionally, the United\r\n  States District Court for the District of South Carolina has stated that &quot;any\r\n  cause of action based on testing, labeling or marketing is preempted by the FDA\r\n  standards for premarket approval.&quot;Â  Tarallo v. Searle Pharm., Inc.,\r\n  704 F. Supp. 653, 656 (D. S.C. 1988).Â  Further, that court has found the MDA, &quot;which expressly precludes the individual states from establishing requirements\r\n  different from or in addition to those promulgated by the FDA, reveals on its\r\n  face the congressional objective to prohibit, by the doctrine of express\r\n  preemption, the proliferation of multiple, diverse, state by state device requirements.&quot;Â  Stewart v. Int'l Playtex, Inc., 672 F. Supp. 907, 909 (D. S.C. 1987)\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nAny\r\n  state requirements imposed by a jury verdict in favor of the causes of action\r\n  at issue would be in addition to or in contradiction of federal requirements,\r\n  and therefore, Weston's causes of action under South Carolina law are preempted\r\n  and were properly dismissed by the circuit court.Â  After carrying its burden of\r\n  proving FreshLook Colors contact lenses were regulated by the FDA as Class III\r\n  medical devices, CIBA then demonstrated it was entitled to judgment as a matter\r\n  of law based on the doctrine of federal preemption.Â  Consequently, the circuit\r\n  court correctly granted summary judgment on all actions dependent on warning,\r\n  labeling, design, marketing, misbranding, or other similar claims.Â  See Donahue,\r\n  362 S.C. at 337, 608 S.E.2d at 165 (&quot;Summary judgment is proper only when\r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot;).Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Remaining\r\n  Issue\r\nFinally,\r\n  Weston argues the circuit court erred in refusing to amend or clarify certain\r\n  provisions of its order granting partial summary judgment.Â  We do not reach this argument because we are unable to\r\n  discern whether Weston raised to the circuit court the issues she now appeals.Â \r\n  An appellate court's review is limited to facts appearing in the record.Â  Rule\r\n  210(h), SCACR.Â  Weston's February 2007 motion seeking amendment or\r\n  clarification of the circuit court's order granting partial summary judgment\r\n  does not appear in the record.Â  Consequently, we are unable to review the\r\n  circuit court's denial of that motion.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because it\r\n  lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the contact lenses at issue were\r\n  federally regulated medical devices, we find the circuit court properly\r\n  interpreted federal statutes to determine whether the MDA preempted South\r\n  Carolina law in this matter.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the\r\n  circuit court on this issue.\r\nRegarding\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact existed, we find the circuit court correctly concluded\r\n  no genuine issue existed as to whether CIBA's FreshLook Colors contact lenses\r\n  were federally regulated as medical devices.Â  Therefore, we affirm the decision\r\n  of the circuit court on this issue.\r\nAs\r\n  to whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because there\r\n  was neither a showing nor a finding that any South Carolina law conflicted with\r\n  federal law, we find any jury verdict imposing different requirements than the\r\n  federal law would constitute an impermissible conflicting state law.Â  Consequently,\r\n  we affirm the decision of the circuit court on this issue.\r\nWe\r\n  do not reach the issue of whether the circuit court erred in refusing to amend\r\n  or clarify certain provisions of its summary judgment order because the motion\r\n  underlying this issue does not appear in the record.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While Weston did not keep the actual pair of contacts\r\n  she purchased or any of the packaging, both parties have stipulated the\r\n  contacts involved were FreshLook Colors with ultraviolet (UV) protection, to be\r\n  sold by prescription only, and approved for extended wear.Â  \r\n[2] The other PMA supplement referenced was &quot;P830037/S46\r\n  FreshLook COLORBLENDS (phemfilcon A) UV Soft Contact Lenses.&quot;Â  \r\n[3] In her brief, Weston argues Oris's testimony is\r\n  hearsay.Â  We find no evidence of this argument being made to the circuit court,\r\n  and therefore, we decline to address it.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the [circuit court] to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;).Â \r\n  We note CIBA's brief argues this issue was not properly preserved because it\r\n  was raised to the circuit court for the first time in a Rule 59(e) motion, and\r\n  hearsay objections cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.Â Â  However,\r\n  after reviewing the record we are unable to find the Rule 59(e) motion to which\r\n  CIBA refers, so without a complete record for review, we need not reach CIBA's\r\n  argument.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR (&quot;[T]he appellate court will not\r\n  consider any fact which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).Â  \r\n[4] By contrast, in March 2009, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court held federal law does not preempt state tort claims for injuries\r\n  resulting from inadequate warning labels on prescription medications.Â  Wyeth\r\n    v.

City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78,\r\n  79-80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  &quot;An order involves the merits\r\n  if it finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole or part of\r\n  some cause of action or defense in the case.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Green\r\n  v. City of Columbia, the issue was whether the Workers' Compensation Commission's\r\n  order sua sponte reversing the election of claims issue involved the merits\r\n  of the case so as to be immediately appealable to the circuit court.Â  311 S.C.\r\n  at 80, 427 S.E.2d at 687.Â  This court found that because the Single Commissioner\r\n  required the election, that ruling became the law of the case, and the City\r\n  could therefore rely on the fact that it did not have to address the election\r\n  issue on review by the Appellate Panel.Â  Id. Â Thus, this court\r\n  determined the Appellate Panel's reversal and remand had the effect of finally\r\n  determining a substantial matter forming part of a defense the City had\r\n  available because the election issue was the law of the case and Green could\r\n  not pursue benefits under the statute. Â Id.Â  Therefore, the Appellate\r\n  Panel's action affected the merits and was immediately appealable, and the\r\n  circuit court should have addressed the merits of the City's appeal.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  also find Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 382, 622 S.E.2d\r\n  546, 548 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, January 31, 2007, and Foggie\r\n    v. General Electric, 376 S.C. 384, 388, 656 S.E.2d 395, 398 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008), to be helpful in determining when an order involves the merits, thus\r\n  making an issue immediately appealable.[3]Â  \r\nIn Brown\r\n  v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., the Workers' Compensation Commission awarded\r\n  benefits to Brown for an occupational lung disease.Â  366 S.C. at 382, 622\r\n  S.E.2d at 548.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Commission on compensability,\r\n  but found the Commission should have allocated a portion of Brown's disease to\r\n  his long history of smoking and remanded for allocation. Â Id. at 382-83,\r\n  622 S.E.2d at 548-49.Â  The remand included &quot;specific direction to make the\r\n  necessary findings as to the apportionment . . . .&quot;Â  Id. at 386,\r\n  622 S.E.2d at 550.Â  This court addressed the appealability of the order:\r\n\r\n\tGenerally, an order is a final judgment on one or more issues if\r\n  it constitutes an ultimate decision on the merits. Â In Owens v. Canal Wood\r\n    Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984), one of the two cases cited by\r\n  the Montjoy court, the supreme court found &quot;[t]he order of the\r\n  circuit court does not involve the merits of the action. Â It is\r\n  therefore interlocutory and not reviewable by this Court for lack of finality.&quot;Â  \r\n\tOwens, 281 S.C. at 492, 316 S.E.2d at 385 (emphasis added) (citations\r\n  omitted). Â Similarly, in Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621\r\n  (1983), the supreme court held that &quot;[b]ecause the interlocutory order of\r\n  the circuit court does not involve the merits of the action, it is not\r\n  reviewable by this Court for lack of finality.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis\r\n  added) (citations omitted). Â Accordingly, in determining whether the court's\r\n  order constitutes a final judgment, we must inquire whether the order finally\r\n  decides an issue on the merits.\r\n\t&quot;An order involves the merits if it finally determines some\r\n  substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense\r\n  in the case.&quot;Â  Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 427 S.E.2d\r\n  685 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Henderson v. Wyatt, 8 S.C. 112 (1877)).Â  In\r\n  the case sub judice, the order of the circuit court finally determined an\r\n  issue on the merits â€“ that Brown's smoking, a non-compensable cause,\r\n  contributed to his disability. Â The court noted &quot;the employer does have\r\n  the burden of proving . . . the interplay of a non-compensable cause&quot; and\r\n  found &quot;the employer clearly met that burden[.]&quot; Â Consequently, the\r\n  circuit court ruled that &quot;the employer was entitled to a determination of\r\n  the proportion allocable to the non-compensable cause[.]&quot; Â The case was\r\n  remanded, not for evaluation whether apportionment was appropriate, but &quot;with\r\n  specific direction to make the necessary findings as to the apportionment between compensable versus non-compensable causes, \r\n\tand a corresponding\r\n    reduction in the Claimant's disability award.&quot;\r\n\tThe court's order mandates apportionment. Â This\r\n  ruling is a decision on the merits because it decides with finality whether\r\n  Greenwood is required to reduce its compensation. . . . Although the judge left\r\n  the percentage of apportionment to the commission on remand, the panel would\r\n  have no choice but to allocate some part of Brown's disability to the\r\n  non-compensable cause. Â Accordingly, the circuit court's order constitutes a\r\n  final decision on the issue of apportionment and is appealable.\r\n\r\nId. at 387-88, 622 S.E.2d at 551 (emphasis in original).\r\nIn\r\n  comparison, in Foggie v. General Electric Co., also a workers' compensation case, this court held\r\n  an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings\r\n  before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.Â  376 S.C. 384, 388,\r\n  656 S.E.2d 395, 398 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  However, we found &quot;where the\r\n  circuit court's order constitutes a final decision on the merits and the remand\r\n  order has no effect on the finality of the decision, the order is immediately\r\n  appealable.&quot;Â  Id. at 389, 656 S.E.2d at 398.Â  \r\nIn Foggie,\r\n  the circuit court affirmed the Commission on two issues; however, the court\r\n  remanded the case to the Commission to make determinations related to permanent\r\n  total disability and credit for veteran's disability.Â  Id. at 387, 656\r\n  S.E.2d at 397.Â  This court distinguished Foggie from Brown because\r\n  the order in Brown finally determined the issue on the merits â€“ that the\r\n  employee's smoking contributed to his disability â€“ and the remand by the\r\n  circuit court determined with finality whether there would be a reduction in\r\n  compensation, leaving open only the determination of the percentage of\r\n  apportionment for the Commission.Â  Id. at 389, 656 S.E.2d at 398.Â \r\n  Whereas, the order in the Foggie case was not a final decision on the\r\n  merits because the circuit court did not make a final determination regarding\r\n  whether or not the claimant was totally and permanently disabled and did not\r\n  finally determine the employer's entitlement to the veteran's disability\r\n  credit.Â  Id.Â  This court found that both of the remanded issues in Foggie were matters within the purview of the Commission, and because the issues had\r\n  not been properly considered by the Commission, the circuit court was correct\r\n  in remanding the case.Â  Id. at 390, 656 S.E.2d at 398.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  Commission was the ultimate fact finder, and the appellate court would have\r\n  violated the governing APA statues by reviewing the record and making factual\r\n  findings on the remanded issues.Â  Id. at 390, 656 S.E.2d at 398-99.Â  Therefore, this court held the circuit court\r\n  order remanding the two issues was not a final decision on the merits and,\r\n  thus, was not immediately appealable.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  the Appellate Panel reversed the Single Commissioner's specific findings\r\n  concerning Canteen's brain injury and remanded the case to the Single Commissioner for a determination\r\n  of permanency to body parts other than Canteen's brain.Â  Thus, we find this case is similar to Green and Brown because the Appellate Panel finally determined the brain injury issue on the\r\n  merits by denying compensation for Canteen's brain injury.Â  Therefore, because the Appellate Panel ruled on that\r\n  issue, there was a final agency decision on the merits in this case and Canteen\r\n  exhausted all of her administrative remedies.[4]Â \r\n  As a result, the Appellate Panel's order was not interlocutory as to the ruling\r\n  on Canteen's brain injury.Â  Because this issue is dispositive of the case, we\r\n  do not reach the merits of Canteen's remaining issues.Â  Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating\r\n  that if an appellate court's ruling on a particular issue is dispositive of an\r\n  appeal, rulings on remaining issues are unnecessary).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's order dismissing Canteen's appeal is reversed, and the case\r\n  is remanded to the circuit court for a determination on Canteen's brain injury.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Robert Braham stated that in his professional\r\n  opinion, Canteen experienced a physical injury to her brain when she fell at\r\n  work.\r\n[2] Dr. Samuel McCown and Dr. Byron Bailey testified they\r\n  did not believe Canteen suffered from Chiari I Malformation; however, the\r\n  Single Commissioner found Dr. Kammer to be more credible.\r\n[3]Â We find Brown and Foggie helpful even\r\n  though we recognize that both cases involve remands from the circuit court to\r\n  the Appellate Panel, unlike in this case where the remand was from the\r\n  Appellate Panel to the Single Commissioner.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[4]Â South Carolina Code section 1-23-380 states that &quot;[a]\r\n  party who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency\r\n  and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to\r\n  judicial review.&quot;Â  S.C.

The town homes share a common wall and are part of a single building\r\n  containing three units.Â  Hynes's town home is the middle unit, and the Spitz's\r\n  town home is an end unit. Â Each unit is situated on a separately owned\r\n  lot which extends from front to back beyond the confines of the town home\r\n  itself.Â  The Hynes property is higher in elevation than the Spitz property.Â  Before\r\n  this dispute arose, storm water from Hynes's roof was collected into his gutters\r\n  and piped down the side of his unit.Â  At the termination of the gutter, a corrugated\r\n  plastic pipe was connected to another piece of pipe which ran underground and\r\n  across Spitz's property out into a common area of the Daybreak community. Â \r\nAround July 2004, Spitz disconnected and\r\n  diverted Hynes's storm drainage system.Â  Spitz alleged the configuration of the\r\n  drainage system caused water to be discharged onto her property and interfered\r\n  with her use and enjoyment of her patio. Hynes brought suit against\r\n  Spitz alleging an express easement existed permitting the drainage pipe to\r\n  cross Spitz's property by virtue of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions\r\n  and Restrictions (Covenants) for the Daybreak community. Spitz denied the\r\n  existence of any easement and counterclaimed requesting Hynes be enjoined from\r\n  discharging water from his gutter onto her property. The trial court issued an\r\n  order on March 21, 2007, denying Hynes's requested relief. Â Â Specifically,\r\n  the trial court found that no express easement or easement by prior use existed\r\n  permitting the placement of the drainage pipe across Spitz's property. The\r\n  trial court also ordered Hynes to disconnect the means of discharging gutter\r\n  water at the current location. This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;On appeal of an action at law\r\n  tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the trial court will not be\r\n  disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the\r\n  trial court's findings.&quot; Â Hardaway Concrete Co., Inc. v. Hall\r\n    Contracting Corp., 374 S.C. 216, 223, 647 S.E.2d 488, 491 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  &quot;The determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact\r\n  in a law action and subject to an 'any evidence' standard of review when tried\r\n  by a judge without a jury.&quot;Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496\r\n  S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Express\r\n  Easement\r\nHynes argues the trial court erred in\r\n  finding the Covenants did not provide an express easement permitting him to\r\n  maintain a drainage pipe across Spitz's property.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tArticle 2, Â§ 6 of the Daybreak Covenants\r\n  states:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tStorm Drainage and Sanitary Sewer Systems.Â  Storm drainage\r\n  systems and sanitary sewer systems may be located under certain Lots throughout\r\n  the Properties.Â  Any such storm drainage and sanitary sewer systems shall be\r\n  maintained in good order and repair by the Association.Â  To the extent required\r\n  to effectuate the foregoing plan, there shall be an easement in favor of each\r\n  Lot for the purposes of providing connection of that Lot with the storm\r\n  drainage system and sanitary sewer system most convenient thereto.Â  Each Lot\r\n  shall be subject to easements in favor of all the other Lots providing for the\r\n  passage through any portion of such Lot of necessary storm drainage systems and\r\n  sanitary sewer systems.Â  All of the foregoing easements are granted and\r\n  reserved subject to the conditions that their use and enjoyment shall not\r\n  materially interfere with the use, occupancy or enjoyment of all or any part of\r\n  the Lot servient to such easements or to which such easements are appurtenant.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court determined the drainage system at issue was not part of any &quot;regularly\r\n  interacting storm water drainage system.&quot; The trial court noted there\r\n  was no uniform system of drainage, and homeowners in Daybreak handled drainage\r\n  using a variety of methods. Furthermore, the trial court noted there was no\r\n  evidence the system was ever maintained or recognized by Daybreak. Thus, the\r\n  trial court concluded there was no express easement permitting Hynes to\r\n  discharge his gutter water into the drainage pipe located on Spitz's\r\n  property.Â Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Definition of\r\n  &quot;System&quot;\r\nHynes\r\n  argues the trial court's definition of the term &quot;system&quot; is too\r\n  selective.Â  Specifically, Hynes contends the language of the Covenants refers\r\n  to plural systems and thus the purpose of the Covenants was to permit multiple\r\n  storm drainage systems planned and built into the structure of the townhouse\r\n  units.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nRestrictive\r\n  covenants upon real estate are contractual in nature and bind the parties\r\n  thereto just like any other contract.Â  Queens Grant II Horizontal Prop.\r\n    Regime v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 361, 628 S.E.2d 902, 913 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).Â  &quot;Restrictive covenants are construed like contracts, and may\r\n  give rise to actions for their breach.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Â &quot;If a\r\n  contract's language is clear and capable of legal construction, this Court's\r\n  function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as\r\n  found in the agreement.&quot; Â Gilbert v. Miller,Â  356 S.C. 25, 31, 586\r\n  S.E.2d 861, 864 (Ct. App. 2003)Â  &quot;A clear and explicit contract must be\r\n  construed according to the terms the parties have used, with the terms to be\r\n  taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.&quot; Â Id.\r\nHynes contends a &quot;system&quot; can\r\n  consist of individual units joined only by their intended purpose, rather than\r\n  in physical fact.Â  The trial court, citing Webster's Dictionary, defined the\r\n  term &quot;system&quot; as &quot;a regularly interacting or interdependent\r\n  group of items forming a unified whole.&quot; Hynes argues this definition is\r\n  too selective and contends the trial court should have considered an alternate\r\n  definition from Webster's Dictionary.Â  Hynes urged the trial court to define\r\n  &quot;system&quot; as &quot;a group of devices or artificial objects or an\r\n  organization forming a network especially for distributing something or serving\r\n  a common purpose.&quot; \r\nThe Covenants specifically refer to\r\n  plural storm water drainage systems and do not contain any requirement that\r\n  these systems be uniform. Â Evidence presented at trial through testimony\r\n  and photographs indicates there was no uniform drainage system for Daybreak and\r\n  that homeowners handled drainage using a variety of methods. We find compelling\r\n  Hynes's argument that the trial court's definition of &quot;system&quot; is too\r\n  selective.Â  Furthermore, we find the trial court improperly relied on the lack\r\n  of uniformity as a basis for finding no express easement in the Covenants.Â  Although\r\n  we find an express easement existed, we affirm the trial court's order based on\r\n  the express easement's interference with Spitz's use and enjoyment of her\r\n  patio.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Interference\r\n  with Use and Enjoyment\r\nHynes\r\n  also argues the trial court erred in finding the storm water drainage system\r\n  interfered with Spitz's enjoyment of her patio. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court found that even if an express drainage easement existed, it would\r\n  be limited by the language of the Covenants.Â  Article 2, Â§ 6 of the Covenants\r\n  provides that use of the easement &quot;shall not materially interfere with the\r\n  uses, occupancy or enjoyment of all or any part of the Lot servient to such\r\n  easement.&quot; Â The trial court noted Spitz testified the drainage pipe\r\n  caused water to be discharged onto her patio which interfered with her\r\n  enjoyment of the property. Hynes argues the trial court's finding that the\r\n  downspout and drain &quot;always&quot; left Spitz's property wet was not\r\n  supported by any evidence.Â  He contends Spitz was unable to say whether the\r\n  water on her property was a result of the drainage system.Â  Spitz testified\r\n  that she wanted to extend her patio but she couldn't because she feared the discharged\r\n  water would create problems after she invested her money in the project. Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find there was evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding\r\n  that the drainage system interfered with Spitz's use and enjoyment of her\r\n  property.Â  Thus, although the Covenants grant Hynes an express easement, that\r\n  easement is conditioned by the language of the Covenants because it interferes\r\n  with Spitz's use, occupancy and enjoyment of her property. \r\nC.&nbsp; Acknowledgement\r\n  by Daybreak\r\nHynes\r\n  also argues the trial court's finding that the Daybreak Homeowners Association (Association)\r\n  failed to acknowledge and maintain the drainage system is not dispositive of\r\n  his easement rights. Â Specifically, Hynes asserts that the trial court's\r\n  finding of a lack of acknowledgement means that if the Association has not\r\n  acknowledged or maintained a system, then that system does not have the right\r\n  to continued existence under the Covenants. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nHynes argues the issue of the\r\n  Association's acknowledgement of or involvement in the drainage system was not\r\n  plead by either party and was not raised by the trial court as an issue at\r\n  trial.Â  He contends the acknowledgement was not tried before the trial court\r\n  and thus the acknowledgement issue could not serve as a basis for the trial\r\n  court's decision.Â  See 46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments Â§ 2 (&quot;[A]\r\n  party may not be granted relief in the absence of pleadings to support that\r\n  relief, and a judgment based on an issue not pleaded is a nullity.&quot;).Â  Spitz\r\n  contends Hynes asserted in his Complaint the existence of an express easement\r\n  pursuant to Article 2, Â§ 6 of the Covenants which included the language that\r\n  any storm water drainage systems shall be maintained by the Association.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Spitz argues Hynes\r\n  incorrectly assumed the trial court relied on a lack of acknowledgement as\r\n  determinative of the issue of the existence of an easement.Â  Spitz contends the\r\n  trial court's reference to the lack of an acknowledgement of the drainage system\r\n  by the Association was significant because if the system at issue was to be\r\n  considered part of a &quot;storm water drainage system&quot; protected by an\r\n  express easement, it would have been maintained and repaired by the\r\n  Association.Â  Article 2, Â§ 6 of the Covenants states: &quot;[a]ny such storm\r\n  drainage and sanitary sewer systems shall be maintained in good order and\r\n  repair by the Association.&quot; Spitz contends the Association's lack\r\n  of repairs and maintenance on the drainage system are only evidence the\r\n  drainage system was not part of a system contemplated by the Covenants. Â The\r\n  trial court specifically based its ruling on the definition of &quot;storm\r\n  water drainage system&quot; and the lack of a uniform drainage system. The\r\n  trial court merely noted its finding was supported by the fact that the Association\r\n  never maintained the system. Â Accordingly, we find the trial court's findings\r\n  regarding the Association's acknowledgement and maintenance of the system were not\r\n  determinative of the existence of an express easement.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Easement\r\n  by Prior Use\r\nHynes argues the trial court erred in\r\n  finding he failed to establish a drainage easement across Spitz's property by\r\n  prior use.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The determination of the existence\r\n  of an easement is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an 'any\r\n  evidence' standard of review when tried by a judge without a jury.&quot;Â  Slear\r\n    v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  Our supreme court\r\n  held a party must prove the following six factors to establish the right to an\r\n  easement implied by prior use:\r\n\r\n\t(1) unity of title; (2) severance of\r\n  title; (2) the prior use was in existence at the time of unity of title; (3)\r\n  the prior use was not merely temporary or casual; (4) the prior use was\r\n  apparent or known to the parties; (5) the prior use was necessary in that there\r\n  could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement without the\r\n  prior use; and (6) the common grantor indicated an intent to continue the prior\r\n  use after severance of title.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nBoyd\r\n  v. Bellsouth Tel. Telegraph Co., 369 S.C. 410, 417, 633 S.E.2d 136, 139\r\n  (2006). \r\nHynes argues there is indirect evidence\r\n  the drainage system has been in place since construction of the townhomes. He contends\r\n  Daybreak was a planned subdivision with planned housing and draining.Â  Hynes\r\n  argues the location of the downspout, the higher elevation of his property, and\r\n  the common building scheme of the subdivision lead to the conclusion that the\r\n  drainage system existed at the time the townhouses were built and sold.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Hynes contends the prior use of the drainage system was not temporary, that it\r\n  was or should have been apparent to all parties, and its location indicated the\r\n  grantor's intent to continue the use after the sale of the townhomes.Â  \r\nThere is no evidence in the record\r\n  establishing how long the drainage system has been in place.Â  Hynes testified\r\n  the drainage system was in place when he purchased his townhome in 1996. While Hynes\r\n  introduced the deposition testimony of two prior owners of the Spitz property,\r\n  their testimony did not create a complete timeline beginning with the original\r\n  grant of the property to Daybreak or the original severance. These prior owners\r\n  testified the drainage system was in place in the 1990s, but could not link the\r\n  drainage system to the construction of the townhomes. Therefore, the record\r\n  contains no evidence the drainage system has been in existence since the\r\n  original division of the property.Â  \r\nMoreover, Hynes failed to prove the\r\n  location of the drainage system was necessary to his enjoyment of his property and\r\n  no other reasonable locations were available.Â  Evidence in the record indicates\r\n  Hynes could have discharged his gutter water onto his own property without\r\n  unreasonable burden or expense.Â  Spitz's structural engineering expert witness\r\n  testified Hynes could have run the drainage pipe down his property line and not\r\n  across Spitz's property and that the water would have drained properly.[1]Â  Accordingly, we find there was evidence in the record to support the trial court's\r\n  finding that Hynes failed to establish an easement by prior use, and we affirm\r\n  the trial court's ruling.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find there was an express easement permitting Hynes to maintain a storm water\r\n  drainage pipe across Spitz's property.Â  However, we find the easement\r\n  interferes with Spitz's use and enjoyment of her property and is therefore\r\n  conditioned by the language of the Covenants.Â  Furthermore, we find Hynes\r\n  failed to establish an easement by prior use permitting him to maintain a storm\r\n  water drainage system across Spitz's property.Â  Accordingly, the trial court's\r\n  order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Spitz's plumber\r\n  testified it would cost approximately $300 for Hynes to run the storm water\r\n  drainage pipe to the rear of his property.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4595","title":"Judy v.

judgment\r\n  obtained against Ronnie Judy (Ronnie) by a third party not involved in the\r\n  present case.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis\r\n  case involves a civil suit brought by Bobby Judy (Bobby) against his brother,\r\n  Ronnie, for actual and punitive damages caused by Ronnie's alleged destruction\r\n  of a corn crop planted by Bobby.Â  The case involves several members of the Judy\r\n  Family.Â  Bobby and Ronnie are sons of the late Blease Judy (Blease).Â  Blease\r\n  also had a third son, Jimmy Judy (Jimmy).Â  Ronnie has a son, Todd Judy (Todd).\r\nIn\r\n  1966, Blease conveyed approximately 133 acres of farmland (the Property) to\r\n  Bobby and Ronnie, jointly.Â  Some time thereafter, the Property was divided by\r\n  the construction of U.S. Interstate Highway I-95, creating two fields, one on\r\n  the east side of I-95 (the East Field) and one on the west (the West Field).[1]Â \r\n  From 1966 until 2001, Ronnie farmed the entirety of the Property.[2]Â \r\n  During this time, Bobby never received any rents or profits from Ronnie's farming\r\n  operations on the Property.Â  However, from 1999 until 2001, Bobby attempted to\r\n  reach an agreement with Ronnie about the division of the Property.Â  These\r\n  attempts proved unsuccessful.\r\nIn\r\n  2001, Bobby decided to begin farming on the Property himself.Â  Bobby contacted\r\n  his nephew, Kevin Judy (Kevin) and his brother, Jimmy, to do the physical labor\r\n  on the Property.Â  On the day Bobby, Jimmy, and Kevin prepared to plant on the\r\n  East Field, they were confronted by Ronnie on his tractor.Â  After some\r\n  discussion, Ronnie and Bobby reached a verbal agreement whereby Ronnie would\r\n  farm the West Field, and Bobby would farm the East Field.[3]Â  \r\nAccess\r\n  to the East Field was through a small parcel of land titled to Todd.Â  This\r\n  access was blocked by Todd, which prompted Bobby to have Jimmy build a separate\r\n  road to access the East Field.Â  As a result of building the road, Bobby and\r\n  Jimmy were able to continue farming and harvesting from the East Field in 2001.Â \r\n  However, the following year, they were unable to use the new road because it\r\n  had become too wet from excessive rain.Â  In late 2002, Bobby called Todd to\r\n  inform him due to the lack of adequate access to the East Field, he intended to\r\n  farm half of the West Field and half of the East Field in 2003.[4]Â \r\n  Bobby testified Todd's response to his proposed change to their agreement was,\r\n  &quot;We'll plow it up.&quot;Â  Kevin and Jimmy planted two areas on the West\r\n  Field with corn for the farm year of 2003 (the Corn Crop).Â  The Corn Crop\r\n  covered between twenty-five and twenty-six acres on the West Field.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  the evening of June 25, 2003, during his regular walk with his wife, Kevin went\r\n  by the Property around 8 p.m.Â  Kevin observed the Corn Crop, and he testified\r\n  it was &quot;beautiful[,] . . . about seven and a half to eight [feet]\r\n  tall.&quot;Â  He also noticed Ronnie's tractor, with a disk harrow attached to\r\n  it, parked in front of Todd's trailer, which was immediately adjacent to the\r\n  Corn Crop.Â  Kevin testified he thought it was strange that the tractor and disk\r\n  were left in the open yard because &quot;[Ronnie] always keeps his stuff under\r\n  his shed, [and] it never came out unless he was using it.&quot;Â  On the morning\r\n  of June 26, 2003, Kevin awoke to find the Corn Crop had been destroyed.Â  Kevin\r\n  noticed whoever had destroyed the Corn Crop during the night had specifically\r\n  avoided a wellhead pipe that protruded eighteen inches to two feet from the\r\n  ground on the West Field.Â  The wellhead pipe was not visible under the high\r\n  overgrowth of the Corn Crop.Â  Kevin also saw tractor tracks leading from the\r\n  destroyed Corn Crop back to the tractor and disk he had seen parked in Todd's\r\n  yard the evening before, and the tractor and disk were full of corn husks and\r\n  silkings.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 28, 2005, Bobby filed a civil suit against Ronnie seeking damages for\r\n  the destruction of the Corn Crop.Â  At trial, Bobby sought to introduce into\r\n  evidence a similar dispute between Ronnie and Jimmy over a different piece of\r\n  property (the Rumph Tract) that culminated in a lawsuit and jury verdict\r\n  against Ronnie.Â  Jimmy and Ronnie owned joint interests in the Rumph Tract,\r\n  which was several miles from the Property.Â  The two brothers had been unable to\r\n  agree on the division of the Rumph Tract, and Jimmy filed a partition action\r\n  against Ronnie.Â  While the partition action case was pending, a dam retaining a\r\n  pond on the Rumph Tract was destroyed on May 5, 2003.Â  Jimmy filed an\r\n  additional lawsuit against Ronnie for destruction of the dam on November 22,\r\n  2005, and the case went to trial on April 4, 2007.Â  The jury found Ronnie had\r\n  maliciously and willfully destroyed the dam using a backhoe, causing the dam to\r\n  be washed out and the pond to be destroyed.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the trial of the present case, Ronnie objected to the admission into evidence\r\n  of the prior judgment against him on several grounds.Â  First, he argued it was\r\n  not yet a final judgment, and it was, therefore, more prejudicial than\r\n  probative.Â  He also argued it was not necessary to prove the act in question.Â \r\n  Finally, he argued there was no factual connection between the parties or the\r\n  acts in the two cases, and that it was simply being offered to prove the crop\r\n  destruction occurred.Â  Bobby argued the evidence was admissible under Rule\r\n  404(b), SCRE, as evidence of prior acts admitted to prove motive, identity,\r\n  intent, or common scheme or plan, and was relevant for punitive damages as\r\n  evidence of similar past conduct.Â  The trial court held:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  testimony of the prior conduct regarding the pond dam is admissible under the\r\n\tLyle[[5]] exception, or the [404(b)] exception as to identity, also as to common scheme\r\n  or plan . . . .Â  [T]his conduct is so bizarre, [and it] is just not the type of\r\n  conduct that occurs every day. . . . There is no question, it's prejudicial,\r\n  but in weighing that it seems . . . it's very important that this type of\r\n  conduct is not the type that ordinarily occurs, which would have a profound\r\n  probative value on the identity, as well as a common scheme or plan.Â  It concerns\r\n  [the court] somewhat but not a whole lot that it's not necessarily a final\r\n  judgment in the prior case, because from what [the court has] heard, if that\r\n  case is reversed for some reason it will probably be on reasons that have no\r\n  impact whatsoever on the jury's factual determination that [Ronnie] . . .\r\n  destroyed the dam in that case.\r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling to admit or exclude evidence will only be reversed if it\r\n  constitutes an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  R &amp; G\r\n    Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&quot;All\r\n  relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the\r\n  Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of South\r\n  Carolina, statutes, [the South Carolina Rules of Evidence], or by other rules\r\n  promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.&quot; Rule 402, SCRE. Â Evidence\r\n  meets the test of relevance if it tends to establish or to make more or less\r\n  probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.Â  Crowley\r\n    v. Spivey, 285 S.C. 397, 410, 329 S.E.2d 774, 782 (Ct. App. 1985).Â \r\n  However, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Rule 403, SCRE; State\r\n    v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 35, 538 S.E.2d 248, 256 (2000).Â  Determinations of\r\n  relevance are largely within the trial court's discretion, and its decision to\r\n  either admit or exclude evidence will not be disturbed on appeal unless there\r\n  is an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law to the prejudice of the\r\n  appellant's rights.Â  Merrill v. Barton, 250 S.C. 193, 195, 156 S.E.2d\r\n  862, 863 (1967).Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Admissibility of Prior Bad\r\n  Acts Evidence\r\nThe\r\n  trial court held the prior judgment was admissible under Lyle as\r\n  evidence of a common scheme or plan and also for identity.Â  Because we believe\r\n  the prior judgment is relevant as evidence of a common scheme or plan and its\r\n  probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect, we affirm.[6]\r\nAs a\r\n  general rule, evidence of a person's prior bad acts is not admissible for the\r\n  purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.Â \r\n  Rule 404(a), SCRE.Â  However, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be\r\n  admissible to establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence of mistake or\r\n  accident, (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more\r\n  crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other,\r\n  or (5) the identity of the perpetrator.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v.\r\n    Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 251-52, 669 S.E.2d 598, 608 (Ct. App. 2008) (citing Lyle, 125 S.C. at 416, 118 S.E.2d at 807); see also Citizens\r\n      Bank of Darlington v. McDonald, 202 S.C. 244, 265, 24 S.E.2d 369, 377\r\n  (1943) (holding Lyle is also applicable in civil cases).Â  Where the\r\n  other bad acts are not the subject of conviction, they must be proven by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence. State v. Kennedy, 339 S.C. 243, 247, 528 S.E.2d\r\n  700, 702 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  When considering whether there is clear and\r\n  convincing evidence, this Court is bound by the trial court's findings unless\r\n  they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 325, 580\r\n  S.E.2d 186, 189 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n&quot;The\r\n  law in civil cases, as well as in criminal cases, permits proof of acts other\r\n  than the one charged which are so related in character, time and place of\r\n  commission as to . . . tend to show the existence of [] a common plan or\r\n  system.&quot;Â  Citizens Bank of Darlington, 202 S.C. at 262-63, 24\r\n  S.E.2d at 376 (citations omitted).Â  In the case of the common scheme or plan\r\n  exception to the general rule barring admission of prior bad act evidence, a\r\n  close degree of similarity between the prior bad act and the present case is\r\n  necessary.Â  Martucci, 380 S.C. at 255, 669 S.E.2d at 610. Â Prior bad act\r\n  evidence is admissible where the evidence is of such a close similarity to the\r\n  charged offense that the previous act enhances the probative value of the\r\n  evidence so as to outweigh the prejudicial effect. Â See, e.g., State\r\n    v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984) (holding\r\n  testimony from victim's sisters admissible in trial for criminal sexual conduct\r\n  with a minor where all three sisters were attacked by defendant beginning\r\n  around their twelfth birthday, late at night, Â at which time defendant explained\r\n  the Biblical verse that children are to â€œHonor thy Fatherâ€); State v.\r\n    Patrick, 318 S.C. 352, 356, 457 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding\r\n  evidence of a robbery in Georgia admissible in trial for burglary, armed\r\n  robbery, and assault with intent to kill because in both cases, the\r\n  perpetrators used the same disguises (gloves, wigs, and bandannas) and the same\r\n  tools (walkie-talkies and flashlights), cut telephone lines, and generally carried\r\n  the same type of weapons); State v. Blanton, 316 S.C. 31, 32, 446 S.E.2d\r\n  438, 439 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding testimony from other women that defendant\r\n  sexually assaulted them was admissible in a trial for criminal sexual conduct\r\n  with a minor because of the similarity of the prior acts to the charged offense).\r\nWe\r\n  find the facts of the prior judgment are so similar to the present case that\r\n  the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.Â  In both\r\n  cases, Ronnie was embroiled in a dispute with a brother over land that was\r\n  jointly titled between them.Â  In both cases, Ronnie had refused to cooperate\r\n  with each of his brothers, leading them to file a court action for partition.Â \r\n  In both cases, substantial improvements to the land were deliberately\r\n  destroyed.Â  In both cases, the destruction of the improvements had been\r\n  effected by use of heavy equipment.Â  Finally, the two incidents occurred only a\r\n  few miles from each other, and only fifty-three days apart.Â  Although there\r\n  were some slight factual differences between the prior case and this case,[7] we do not believe these differences constitute such a meaningful distinction\r\n  that the trial court's admission of the prior judgment into evidence\r\n  constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  to the extent the admission of the prior judgment may have prejudiced Ronnie, we\r\n  find any prejudice was alleviated when the trial court gave a limiting\r\n  instruction to the jury as to the proper purpose for which the evidence of the\r\n  prior judgment was to be used:\r\n\r\n\tLadies\r\n  and gentlemen, you have heard testimony in this trial of . . . other acts, bad\r\n  acts or improper acts allegedly committed by [Ronnie].Â  And [the court] tell[s]\r\n  you that that testimony . . . was not given for the purpose of showing that [Ronnie]\r\n  is a bad person who does bad things, and it would be improper for you to reach\r\n  such a conclusion from that testimony.Â  That testimony was allowed . . . only\r\n  as to the identity of the perpetrator in this case, as to any possibly motive,\r\n  and/or to the existence of a common scheme and plan, and for no other purpose.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBecause the trial\r\n  court specifically warned jurors not to infer from the fact of the prior\r\n  judgment that Ronnie &quot;is a bad person who does bad things,&quot; we\r\n  believe any prejudice that might have otherwise resulted from the admission of\r\n  the prior judgment was removed by the trial court in its curative instructions\r\n  to the jury.Â  See State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 394, 377 S.E.2d\r\n  298, 302 (1989) (&quot;[C]urative instructions usually cure any prejudice\r\n  caused by the admission of incompetent evidence&quot;).Â  In sum, we find no\r\n  error in the trial court's admission of the prior judgment into evidence.\r\n2.&nbsp; Finality of the Prior\r\n  Judgment\r\nRonnie\r\n  also argues the prior judgment should not have been admitted because his appeal\r\n  in the case is still pending and, if the prior judgment is reversed, its\r\n  admission into evidence in this case would taint the verdict.Â Â  However, Ronnie\r\n  has cited no legal authority to support the argument that this was an error of\r\n  law.Â  As such, this argument is conclusory, and such arguments are deemed\r\n  abandoned on appeal.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588,\r\n  600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding party abandoned an issue\r\n  on appeal due to failure to cite any supporting authority and making only\r\n  conclusory arguments).\r\n3.&nbsp; Relevance to Punitive\r\n  Damages\r\nAs\r\n  an additional sustaining ground for the trial court's admission of the prior\r\n  judgment, Bobby argues the trial court should be affirmed because the prior\r\n  judgment is relevant to the issue of punitive damages.Â  We agree.\r\nTrial\r\n  courts are required to conduct a post-trial review of punitive damage awards\r\n  and consider the following factors: (1) defendant's degree of culpability; (2)\r\n  duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness or concealment of the\r\n  conduct; (4) existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will\r\n  deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably\r\n  related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendant's ability\r\n  to pay; and (8) other factors deemed appropriate.Â  Gamble v. Stevenson,\r\n  305 S.C. 104, 111-12, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991)\r\nIn Burbach\r\n  v. Investors Mgmt. Corp. Int'l, this c ourt affirmed a judgment against a\r\n  landlord for unlawful conversion of a tenant's security deposit.Â  326 S.C. 492,\r\n  498, 484 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The Court held evidence of the\r\n  landlord's treatment of prior tenants and his attempts to keep their security\r\n  deposits was admissible to support the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages,\r\n  even though the other tenants were not parties to the case.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  Court held such evidence was relevant to the first five of the Gamble factors, i.e., it went to the landlord's degree of culpability, the duration of\r\n  his conduct, his awareness or concealment of his conduct, similar past conduct,\r\n  and likelihood the award would deter the landlord and others from similar\r\n  conduct.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe believe here, as\r\n  in Burbach, the evidence of the prior judgment against Ronnie is\r\n  relevant to the issue of punitive damages because it pertains to at least two\r\n  of the Gamble factors.Â  Given the factual similarities between the prior\r\n  judgment and this case discussed above, the prior judgment is evidence of\r\n  similar past conduct by Ronnie that could assist jurors in assessing punitive\r\n  damages.Â  Moreover, the fact that Ronnie had committed similar bad acts on a\r\n  prior occasion could inform the jury as to the likelihood that an award would\r\n  deter Ronnie from similar conduct in the future.Â  Accordingly, we find evidence\r\n  of the prior judgment admissible as relevant to punitive damages.\r\n4.&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nEven\r\n  assuming, arguendo, the trial court erred in admitting the prior\r\n  judgment into evidence, we believe such error was harmless. \r\nAs\r\n  stated above, determinations of relevance are largely within the trial court's\r\n  discretion, and its decision to either admit or reject evidence will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion amounting to an\r\n  error of law to the prejudice of the appellant's rights.Â  Merrill, 250\r\n  S.C. at 195, 156 S.E.2d at 863; see Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C.\r\n  149, 159, 156 S.E.2d 759, 763-64 (1967) (holding to justify reversal based upon\r\n  improper admission of evidence, appellant must show prejudice and that jury was\r\n  likely influenced thereby).\r\nWhether\r\n  an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Â In\r\n    re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 63, 584 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2003). â€œNo definite rule\r\n  of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character\r\n  of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  Error is harmless\r\n  where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. Harvey,\r\n  355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897. Â Generally, appellate courts will not set\r\n  aside judgments due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result. Â State\r\n    v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991). Â The admission\r\n  of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to\r\n  other evidence. State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334,\r\n  337 (1978). Â \r\nTo\r\n  the extent the prior judgment was improperly admitted, we believe the other\r\n  evidence presented in this case was more than sufficient to sustain the verdict\r\n  that Ronnie willfully and maliciously destroyed the Corn Crop.Â  First, there\r\n  was testimony that the corn around the wellhead pipe on the West Field had not\r\n  been destroyed, that it &quot;was clearly [disced] around.&quot;Â  Thus, whoever\r\n  cut down the Corn Crop must have known the location of the pipe because it was\r\n  purposefully avoided, even at night.Â  The only people who knew about the pipe\r\n  and were in the area on the night of June 25, 2003, were Jimmy, Kevin, Ronnie,\r\n  and possibly Todd.Â  It is highly unlikely Jimmy or Kevin would destroy their\r\n  own crop after spending so much time and energy growing it.Â  Moreover, even\r\n  though Todd was the legal holder of the joint interest in the Property, Todd\r\n  worked full-time at a local cement factory, and it was Ronnie who had farmed\r\n  the property since 1966, so it is unlikely Todd was the one who destroyed the\r\n  Corn Crop.Â  Second, on the morning after the Corn Crop was destroyed, there was\r\n  a trail of corn husks and silks leading from the West Field back to where\r\n  Ronnie's tractor was parked, and the tractor and disk harrow were covered with\r\n  stalks and husks.Â  We believe the only reasonable conclusion to draw from the\r\n  evidence is that Ronnie destroyed the Corn Crop.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we believe to the extent the admission of the prior judgment into evidence was\r\n  error, it was an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At various\r\n  points in the record, the East Field is referred to as &quot;The Opening&quot;\r\n  and the West Field is referred to as &quot;The Home Place.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] In 1998, Ronnie\r\n  conveyed his interest in the Property to his son, Todd, for five dollars.Â \r\n  However, Todd leased the Property to Ronnie in 2000, and Ronnie continued to\r\n  farm the Property while Todd maintained full employment with a local cement\r\n  plant.Â  \r\n[3] There is some\r\n  confusion as to which brother was to farm which field under this verbal\r\n  agreement.Â  In his brief, Bobby states the agreement was that Ronnie would farm\r\n  the East Field while Bobby would farm the West Field.Â  However, Bobby testified\r\n  the agreement was that he would farm the East Field and Ronnie was to farm the\r\n  West Field.Â  Jimmy and Ronnie also testified this was the agreement.Â  \r\n[4] That same year,\r\n  Bobby filed an action to partition the Property.Â  \r\n[5] In State v.\r\n  Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E.2d 803, 807 (1923), the Supreme Court of\r\n  South Carolina held, â€œGenerally speaking, evidence of other crimes is competent\r\n  to prove the specific crime charged when it tends to establish, (1) motive; (2)\r\n  intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan\r\n  embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof\r\n  of one tends to establish the others; (5) the identity of the person charged\r\n  with the commission of the crime on trial.&quot; \r\n[6] This court may\r\n  affirm the trial court based on any grounds found in the record.

Hamrick (Employer) since\r\n  1993.Â  As a dental hygienist, she is required to constantly position her neck\r\n  and upper extremities in an awkward manner while using vibrating tools.Â  In\r\n  September of 2002, Hieronymus consulted Dr. Roslyn Harris regarding pain in her\r\n  upper extremities, including her right wrist.Â  Dr. Harris suspected carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome and referred Hieronymus to Dr. Craig S. Woodward for a nerve\r\n  conduction study.Â  Following the study, Hieronymus was diagnosed with carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome on the right side.Â  In October of 2002, Hieronymus reported her\r\n  condition to Employer, who filed a Form 12-A worker's compensation claim with\r\n  Clarendon, its insurance company at the time.Â  The Form 12-A stated Hieronymus\r\n  suffered a work-related injury to her right arm and wrist due to &quot;constant\r\n  repetitive motions performed by dental hygienist and assisting duties.&quot;Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Hieronymus was referred to Dr. Edwin Rudisill for treatment of her condition.Â \r\n  After conservative therapy failed to alleviate Hieronymus's carpal tunnel\r\n  syndrome, Dr. Rudisill performed surgery on her wrist.Â  Following surgery,\r\n  Hieronymus continued to complain of some soreness and numbness in her hand.Â Â  However,\r\n  in August of 2003, Dr. Rudisill released her to work without restrictions after\r\n  concluding she had reached maximum medical improvement with a five percent\r\n  impairment rating.Â  In October of 2003, Dr. John P. Evans evaluated Hieronymus\r\n  for her continuing pain and concluded the pain was a result of the surgery and\r\n  should only last for six months to a year.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May of 2004, Hieronymus returned to Dr. Rudisill due to the continuing pain in\r\n  her hand.Â  An x-ray of the hand revealed a small abnormality which &quot;could\r\n  represent&quot; a ganglion cyst.Â  However, Dr. Rudisill opined the cyst was not\r\n  related to the activity in her hands or the cause of her pain.Â  Further, Dr.\r\n  Rudisill's report indicates he informed Hieronymus he did not know of any other\r\n  treatment other than anti-inflammatory medicine to alleviate the pain, and he\r\n  released her without work restrictions.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  November of 2004, Hieronymus filed a Form 50 request for additional treatment\r\n  for injuries to her &quot;right hand, right upper extremity, right elbow, right\r\n  shoulder, and neck&quot; alleging she suffered the injuries on October 1,\r\n  2002.Â  On November 29, 2004, Hieronymus went to Dr. Gordon Early for an\r\n  independent medical examination of the pain in her hand, wrist, and neck.Â  Although\r\n  Dr. Early found her neck pain was not attributable to her work, he opined the\r\n  ganglion cyst in Hieronymus's wrist might have been a complication of the\r\n  carpal tunnel release surgery.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Hieronymus filed additional Form 50's to request a hearing on the matter.Â \r\n  Clarendon responded, admitting Hieronymus suffered a carpal tunnel injury on\r\n  October 1, 2002, but denying she suffered any other compensable injuries or\r\n  needed additional medical treatment.Â  Prior to a hearing before the single\r\n  commissioner of the Workers' Compensation Commission, both Hieronymus\r\n  and Clarendon agreed to an evaluation by Dr. James Essman regarding the\r\n  ganglion cyst.Â  He opined the cyst was not related to the carpal tunnel release\r\n  surgery.Â  Dr. Essman also noted Hieronymus's neck pain &quot;was caused and/or\r\n  aggravated by the awkward posture in which she works in her employment as a\r\n  dental hygienist.&quot;Â  \r\nAlso\r\n  prior to a hearing, the single commissioner granted Clarendon's motion to join as\r\n  a defendant Hartford Insurance Company, which provided coverage to Employer\r\n  after Clarendon's coverage ended in April of 2003.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the hearing, the single commissioner found Hieronymus sustained injuries to her\r\n  neck, hands, and upper extremities on October 1, 2002 as a result of repetitive\r\n  trauma.Â  Further, the single commissioner found the ganglion cyst in Hieronymus's\r\n  hand was compensable because it &quot;was caused or aggravated by the\r\n  compensable injuries to her right hand and the subsequent treatment, including\r\n  surgery.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the single commissioner concluded Clarendon was\r\n  responsible for all causally related treatment as the insurer at the time of\r\n  her injury by accident.Â  The Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission (the Appellate Panel) found the single commissioner's conclusions\r\n  were correct and adopted the single commissioner's order in its entirety.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel's order, concluding the findings\r\n  were supported by substantial evidence.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes our standard of review of decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission. Accordingly, this court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision only if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced\r\n  because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.

Aiken County, 341 S.C.\r\n  448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence,\r\n  when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach\r\n  the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.&quot;Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at\r\n  455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions does not prevent the Appellate Panel's conclusions from being\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr.,\r\n  334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).Â  The final determination of\r\n  witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the\r\n  Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Neck injuryÂ Â   \r\nEmployer\r\n  and Clarendon argue the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  Hieronymus sustained an injury by accident to her neck on October 1, 2002.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel held: &quot;Claimant sustained injuries to her neck, both\r\n  hands, and both upper extremities on or around October 1, 2002 as a result of\r\n  repetitive trauma in her job with employer-defendant.&quot; Clarendon asserts\r\n  there is not substantial evidence to support this finding that Hieronymus was\r\n  experiencing neck pain at this time.Â  Hieronymus's\r\n  medical records from Dr. Woodward and Dr. Rudisill indicated Hieronymus only reported\r\n  pain in her arms, wrists, elbows, and shoulders.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  when asked about the development of her problems in October of 2002, Hieronymus\r\n  testified that the problems began with numbness in her hands that &quot;started\r\n  in my right, but then, you know, it went to my left and it was both of them,\r\n  the right was significantly worse . . . .Â  And my elbows and neck, constant . .\r\n  . .&quot;Â  She stated that the surgery helped the numbness, but she still had\r\n  pain in her hands, elbows, and neck. She explained she only complained about\r\n  the pain in her right hand in her intake form to Dr. Rudisill because the pain\r\n  in that hand was horrid. The Appellate Panel held Hieronymus's testimony was\r\n  very credible.Â  \r\nHieronymus's\r\n  testimony provides evidence that she was suffering pain in her neck as well as\r\n  in her arms and shoulders as of October of 2002.Â  As the determination of witness credibility and the weight to\r\n  be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel, we find substantial\r\n  evidence in the record supports the Appellate Panel's determination that\r\n  Hieronymus had suffered an injury to her neck on October 1, 2002. See Shealy,\r\n  341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nClarendon\r\n  also argues the Appellate Panel erred in concluding it is liable for coverage\r\n  of the neck injury, even if there is substantial evidence supporting the\r\n  finding Hieronymus experienced pain in her neck in October 2002.Â  Clarendon\r\n  contends that because Hieronymus's neck injury is a repetitive trauma injury\r\n  developing over time, October of 2002 is not the appropriate date for\r\n  determining which insurer is liable for coverage.Â  \r\nClarendon\r\n  admitted Hieronymus suffered an injury by accident in October of 2002 due to &quot;constant\r\n  repetitive motions performed by dental hygienist and assisting duties.&quot;Â \r\n  In addition, as stated above, we have found substantial evidence supports the\r\n  Appellate Panel's conclusion that Hieronymus suffered an injury by accident to\r\n  her neck on October 1, 2002.Â  &quot;[W]hen a claim is filed, all elements of\r\n  compensation are included.Â  It was not contemplated by the Act that different\r\n  parts of the total result of one accident should be regarded as separate\r\n  claims.&quot;Â  Hamilton v. Bob Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 88, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  599, 607 (Ct. App. 1999), aff'd as modified, 339 S.C. 68, 528 S.E.2d 667\r\n  (2000).Â  Â  It is not necessary that the claim state all of the injurious\r\n  effects arising out of the accident.Â  Id. \r\nWe\r\n  hold substantial evidence in the record supports the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  that Hieronymus sustained injuries to her neck, as well as to her hands and\r\n  upper extremities, in October of 2002, and, as Clarendon was the carrier for\r\n  Employer at that time, it is responsible for Hieronymus's claim.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the circuit court properly affirmed the Appellate Panel on this issue.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Statute of limitations\r\nClarendon argues Hieronymus's claim of a neck injury was untimely because she did not file a\r\n  claim for the injury until November of 2004, over two years after the date of\r\n  the alleged injury by accident, and outside the statute of limitations set\r\n  forth in Section 42-15-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â  However, as\r\n  stated above, once a claimant files a claim, that claim encompasses all of the\r\n  effects of that accident. Â Bob Bennett\r\n    Ford, 336 at 88, 518 S.E.2d at 607.Â  Accordingly, we find Hieronymus satisfied the statute of\r\n  limitations when Clarendon accepted her original claim.Â Â Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Ganglion cyst\r\nClarendon argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's finding that the\r\n  ganglion cyst in Hieronymus's hand was caused by her carpal tunnel syndrome or\r\n  aggravated by subsequent treatment.Â  It asserts Dr. Early's opinion the cyst &quot;may\r\n  be&quot; related to the surgery was speculative and did not amount to\r\n  substantial evidence.Â  \r\n&quot;If\r\n  a medical expert is unwilling to state with certainty a connection between an\r\n  accident and an injury, the 'expression of a cautious opinion' may support an\r\n  award if there are facts outside the medical testimony that also support an\r\n  award.&quot;Â  Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513\r\n  S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999).Â  Â &quot;Proof that a claimant sustained an injury may\r\n  be established by circumstantial and direct evidence where circumstances lead\r\n  an unprejudiced mind to reasonably infer the injury was caused by the accident.&quot;\r\n  Â Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 846-47.\r\nIn his report of his independent medical exam, Dr.\r\n  Early opined, &quot;I think this ganglion cyst may be a post-surgical\r\n  complication.&quot;Â  He explained how the injury could occur during surgery. Â Dr.\r\n  Early recommended Hieronymus undergo an imaging procedure of her wrist to\r\n  determine if she did in fact have a ganglion cyst.Â  He stated, &quot;If it is a\r\n  ganglionic cyst, we would consider it to be attributable to the previous carpel\r\n  tunnel surgery, and I would recommend surgical excision.&quot;Â  The issue of\r\n  whether the cyst was a ganglion cyst does not appear to be in dispute.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the Appellate Panel's conclusion that the cyst was caused by her\r\n  surgery is supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  above stated reasons, the order of the circuit court affirming the decision of\r\n  the Appellate Panel is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4597","title":"Lexington County Health Services v.

Â Â  In a final agency determination, the Department found section\r\n  44-7-2120 did not exempt Lexington Medical from sales and use taxes on its\r\n  purchases of new equipment and other tangible personal property used for\r\n  capital upgrades and additions to real property.Â  In its decision, the\r\n  Department noted Lexington Medical, as a regional health services district, was\r\n  exempt from certain state taxes but concluded Lexington Medical misinterpreted\r\n  the statute with regard to the matter at issue.Â  The Department concluded\r\n  Lexington Medical was exempt from sales taxes only on the sale of construction\r\n  materials between two health services districts or between a district and its\r\n  wholly-owned subsidiary.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Lexington Medical petitioned for administrative review and requested a\r\n  contested case hearing.Â  On appeal, the ALC rejected the Department's\r\n  interpretation of section 44-7-2120 and held health services districts were exempt\r\n  from payment of sales and use taxes on materials used in the construction and\r\n  equipping of a district's healthcare facilities.Â Â Â  Consequently, the ALC found\r\n  Lexington Medical was entitled to an $8,389,717.21 refund in sales and use taxes\r\n  paid on its purchases of equipment and other tangible personal property used\r\n  for capital upgrades and additions to real property in connection with its\r\n  clinical expansion project. The ALC came to its conclusion after examining\r\n  legislative history, legislative intent, and other provisions of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.Â  The Department appeals that finding.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review for a court reviewing the decision of\r\n  the ALC is set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-610 (Supp. 2008). Â â€œThe review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order must be confined to the record.â€ Â Â§\r\n  1-23-610(D). Â Under section 1-23-610(B), our court may reverse or modify the\r\n  decision of the ALC if its findings, conclusions, or decisions are: \r\n\r\n\t(a)\r\n  in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; \r\n\t(b)\r\n  in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; \r\n\t(c)\r\n  made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d)\r\n  affected by other error of law;\r\n\t(e)\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n  on the whole record; or\r\n\t(f)\r\n  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n  unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Health Services District Exception\r\nThe Department\r\n  argues the ALC erred in finding Lexington Medical was exempt from paying\r\n  certain sales and use taxes based on its construction of section 44-7-2120.Â \r\n  The Department states exemption statutes should be strictly construed against\r\n  taxpayers, and that under this principle, Lexington Medical should not be exempt\r\n  from paying certain sales and use taxes.Â  We find the ALC erred in its\r\n  interpretation of the exemption statute.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Exemption Statute\r\n&quot;Under\r\n  the plain meaning rule, it is not the court's place to change the meaning of a\r\n  clear and unambiguous statute.&quot; Â Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85,\r\n  533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  Â &quot;Where the statute's language is plain and\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory\r\n  interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\n  meaning.&quot; Â Id. Â The legislative language in a statute is considered\r\n  the best evidence of the legislative intent or will, and courts are bound to implement\r\n  the legislature's expressed intent.Â  See id.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  question before us is whether the statutory language is clear on its face.Â  If\r\n  the language is clear, we are bound to apply its plain meaning.\r\n\r\n\tPursuant\r\n  to section 44-7-2120:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tAll\r\n  properties owned by a district, whether real, personal, or mixed, and the\r\n  income from the properties, all securities issued by a district and the\r\n  indentures and other instruments executed as security therefor, all leases made\r\n  pursuant to the provisions of this article, and all revenues derived from these\r\n  leases, and all deeds and other documents executed by or delivered to a\r\n  district, are exempt from any and all taxation by the State or by any county,\r\n  municipality, or other political subdivision of the State, including, but\r\n  without limitation, license excise taxes imposed in respect of the privilege of\r\n  engaging in any of the activities in which a district may engage. Â A district\r\n  is not obligated to pay or allow any fees, taxes, or costs to the clerk of\r\n  court, the Secretary of State, or the register of deeds in any county in\r\n  respect of its incorporation, the amendment of its certificate of\r\n  incorporation, or the recording of any document. Â The gross proceeds of the\r\n  sale of any property owned by the district and used in the construction and\r\n  equipment of any health care facilities for a district is exempt from all other\r\n  and similar excise or sales taxes. Â It is the express intent of this section\r\n  that any district authorized under this article incurs no tax liability to the\r\n  State or any of its political subdivisions except to the extent that sales and\r\n  use taxes may be payable on the purchases of goods or equipment by the\r\n  district.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFocusing\r\n  on the third sentence of section 44-7-2120, the Department maintains this\r\n  provision allows health districts to sell its tangible personal property for\r\n  use in constructing and equipping health care facilities without incurring any\r\n  sales or use tax obligations.Â  Here, Lexington Medical's exemption claim\r\n  focuses on its purchase of personal property rather than its receipt of gross\r\n  proceeds from a sale.Â  We agree with the Department because the following\r\n  provision is clear on its face:Â  &quot;The gross proceeds of the sale of any\r\n  property owned by the district and used in the construction and equipment of\r\n  any health care facilities for a district is exempt from all other and similar\r\n  excise or sales taxes.&quot;Â  This provision seems to limit the sales and use\r\n  tax exemptions to only property sold by health districts to other health\r\n    districts. Â Specifically, we do not interpret the statute to exempt health\r\n  districts from sales and use taxes when buying property from an entity which\r\n    is not a health district based on the &quot;owned by the district&quot;\r\n  language from the statute.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we find the last sentence of the statute, read plainly, leads to the same\r\n  interpretation.Â  The last sentence of section 44-7-2120 provides:Â  &quot;It is\r\n  the express intent of this section that any district authorized under this\r\n  article incurs no tax liability to the State or any of its political\r\n  subdivisions except to the extent that sales and use taxes may be payable on\r\n    the purchases of goods or equipment by the district.&quot;Â  (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Therefore, it appears that the legislature's intent was to exempt\r\n  health districts from certain tax obligations, with sales taxes incurred on\r\n  purchases of goods or equipment as the express exception.Â  Under the\r\n  &quot;plain meaning rule,&quot; we hold health districts are not exempt from\r\n  excise or sales taxes incurred from construction and equipment of any health\r\n  care facilities.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Absurd Result\r\nAt this\r\n  point, our analysis turns to whether our interpretation would lead to an absurd\r\n  result, as the ALC found and Lexington Medical now argues.Â  If our\r\n  interpretation would lead to a result unintended by the legislature and plainly\r\n  absurd, we should reject it.Â  So. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n,\r\n  297 S.C. 492, 496, 377 S.E.2d 358, 361 (Ct. App. 1989) (&quot;However plain the\r\n  ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute, the courts will reject that\r\n  meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it\r\n  could not have been intended by the [l]egislature.&quot;).Â  We believe our\r\n  interpretation of the exemption statute would not lead to an absurd result.Â  \r\nLexington\r\n  Medical argues the casual or isolated sales exception, regulation 117-322 of South Carolina Code of Regulations (Supp. 2008),\r\n  creates an absurdity when read in conjunction with section 44-7-2120.Â  Non-merchants\r\n  are exempt from paying sales taxes under regulation 117-322.Â Â  &quot;Casual or\r\n  isolated sales by persons not engaged in the business of selling tangible\r\n  personal property at retail are not subject to the sales or use tax.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Under regulation 117-322, &quot;the term 'casual' means occurring, encountered,\r\n  acting or performed without regularity or at random.Â  The term 'occasional' and\r\n  the term 'isolated' mean occurring alone or once, an incident not likely to\r\n  recur, sporadic.&quot;Â  During the ALC hearing, Lexington Medical's expert\r\n  opined:Â  &quot;[I]n the unlikely event a sale of goods by a district to a\r\n  parent or subsidiary or a related entity occurred, that transaction would be\r\n  excluded as a 'casual sale' pursuant to S.C. Code Reg. 117-322.&quot;Â  The ALC considered\r\n  regulation 117-322 when making its conclusion that section 44-7-2120 creates an\r\n  exemption for Lexington Medical.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs the Department contends, a determination of whether a sale is\r\n  &quot;casual&quot; depends on a number of factors and must be determined on a\r\n  case-by-case basis.Â  Therefore, section 44-7-2120 would not\r\n  require such an analysis but provides a general exemption for health care\r\n  districts when selling tangible property to other health care districts.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the South Carolina Code imposes a duty to pay sales taxes on &quot;every person\r\n  engaged or continuing within this State in the business of selling tangible\r\n  personal property at retail.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-910(A) (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  Here, we are dealing with contractors who went to merchants to purchase\r\n  supplies for construction.Â  Those retailers were required to pass on the sales\r\n  taxes incurred from purchases to the state. Â See Â§ 12-36-910(A).Â \r\n  Furthermore, under current South Carolina law, no public entity, such as a\r\n  city, municipality, or school, is wholly exempt from paying sales tax to expand\r\n  its facilities.Â  \r\nWe have\r\n  considered the support asserted by Lexington Medical, including legislative\r\n  history, other code sections, and the casual or isolated sales exception in regulation 117-322.Â  After careful consideration, we\r\n  disagree with Lexington Medical's assertion that the Department's\r\n  interpretation of section 44-7-2120 requires one to assume that the legislature\r\n  intended to create a nullity or an absurdity and find that one does not exist\r\n  here.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assignment of Refund\r\nThe\r\n  Department maintains Lexington Medical's assignment from vendors was not in\r\n  compliance with section 12-60-470(C)(3) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005)\r\n  because Lexington Medical obtained the assignments before receiving approval of\r\n  the refund.Â  Based on our decision to reverse the ALC's interpretation of the\r\n  exception statute, we need not address whether the ALC erred in concluding\r\n  Lexington Medical's assignments from third party vendors were sufficient to\r\n  assign refund claims for sales taxes paid because this issue is dispositive.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining\r\n  issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the ALC based on the plain reading of section 44-7-2120.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold Lexington Medical is not entitled to an $8,389,717.21 refund in sales\r\n  and use taxes paid on its purchases of equipment and other tangible personal\r\n  property used for capital upgrades and additions to real property in connection\r\n  with its clinical expansion project.Â  We have considered Lexington Medical's\r\n  absurd interpretation argument and find it is without merit.Â  Based on our\r\n  decision to reverse the ALC's interpretation of section 44-7-2120, we need not\r\n  address the Department's assignment argument.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the\r\n  ALC is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4598","title":"State v.

Â Once Rivera\r\n  exited the vehicle, Lane asked Rivera several questions, including where he and\r\n  the passenger, Medero, were coming from, how long they had been there, where they\r\n  were going, and the purpose of their trip. Â Rivera responded they were\r\n  returning from New York.[2]Â \r\n  He said they had gone there to visit Medero's grandmother and also there had\r\n  been a death in Rivera's family. Â He stated they stayed in New York for one\r\n  week. \r\nNext, Lane asked Medero a series of similar questions. Â Medero\r\n  stated they had been in Yonkers, New York, visiting his nephew. Â He stated they\r\n  were in New York for about five days. \r\nLane returned to Rivera, advised Rivera he would receive a warning\r\n  ticket, and began filling out the citation. Â He then called for backup and\r\n  began talking to Rivera about the transport of illegal drugs on the interstate.\r\n  Â Lane asked Rivera if there were any weapons, drugs, or large sums of money in\r\n  the vehicle, and Rivera responded in the negative. Â Lane also asked for\r\n  permission to search the vehicle. Â After Rivera consented to the search, Lane\r\n  and another officer searched the vehicle.Â  They found heroin in the engine. \r\nA grand jury indicted Respondents for trafficking in heroin.Â \r\n  Prior to a bench trial, Respondents moved to suppress evidence found in\r\n  Rivera's rental vehicle as the product of an unlawfully prolonged traffic stop\r\n  and an invalid consent to search the vehicle. Â The State justified the detention\r\n  that reached beyond the initial, valid stop for the following reasons: (1) the\r\n  nervousness of the Respondents; (2) their inconsistent stories about the trip;\r\n  (3) the strong odor of air fresheners within the car; and (4) the lack of\r\n  luggage in the passenger compartment.\r\nThe trial court granted Respondents' motion, holding Lane lacked &quot;sufficient\r\n  indicators of criminal activity to justify any continued detention&quot; beyond\r\n  the purpose of the traffic stop; thus, any consent to search obtained from\r\n  Rivera during that time amounted to an exploitation of an unlawful detention and\r\n  was invalid.\r\nThe State appeals. \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State\r\n  argues the trial court erred in suppressing evidence seized from Rivera's\r\n  rental vehicle and holding the evidence was the product of an unlawful\r\n  detention and an invalid consent to search the vehicle.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.[3] Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either\r\n  lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.[4]Â  \r\nIn criminal cases, we, as an appellate court, only review errors of\r\n  law.[5] Â This standard of review also applies to preliminary factual findings in\r\n  determining the admissibility of certain evidence.[6]Â \r\n  In Fourth Amendment search and\r\n  seizure cases, our review is limited to determining whether there is any\r\n  evidence to support the trial court's finding.[7]Â \r\n  We will not reverse a trial court's findings of fact merely because we would\r\n  have reached a different conclusion.[8] \r\nWhen\r\n  probable cause exists to believe a traffic violation has occurred, the decision\r\n  to stop the automobile is reasonable per se.[9] Â Once a vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, a police\r\n  officer may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the\r\n  Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable searches\r\n  and seizures.[10] Â The officer &quot;'may request\r\n  a driver's license and vehicle registration, run a computer check, and issue a\r\n  citation&quot;';[11] however, &quot;[a]ny further detention for questioning is beyond the scope of\r\n  the . . . stop and therefore illegal unless the officer has a reasonable\r\n  suspicion of a serious crime.&quot;[12]Â  Â Â \r\n&quot;Warrantless searches and\r\n  seizures are reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when\r\n  conducted under the authority of voluntary consent.&quot;[13]Â \r\n  &quot;Undoubtedly, a law enforcement officer may request permission to search at any time. Â However, when an officer asks for\r\n  consent to search after an unconstitutional detention,\r\n  the consent procured is per se invalid unless it is both voluntary and not an\r\n  exploitation of the unlawful detention.&quot;[14]Â \r\n  &quot;Proof of voluntary consent alone is not sufficient.Â  The relevant factors\r\n  include the temporal proximity of [the] illegal seizure and consent, intervening\r\n  circumstances, and the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.&quot;[15]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nHere,\r\n  Lane lawfully detained the vehicle, requested Rivera's license and\r\n  registration, and asked Rivera to exit the vehicle.Â  In addition, Lane's\r\n  initial questioning, including where Respondents were\r\n  coming from, how long they had been there, where they were going, and the\r\n  purpose of their trip, was reasonable in that the questions tangentially\r\n  related to the purpose of the traffic stop.Â  Once Lane informed Rivera he would\r\n  receive a warning citation, however, the purpose of the stop ended and Lane's\r\n  continued questioning concerning the transport of drugs on the interstate exceeded\r\n  the scope of the stop. Â This amounted to a second and illegal detention[16] unless\r\n  Lane entertained a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity sufficient to warrant\r\n  that detention. Â \r\nAs\r\n  we noted above, the trial court held Lane's suspicion of illegal drug activity rested\r\n  on no reasonable basis, holding the Respondents' nervousness, standing alone,\r\n  did not create a suspicion of criminal behavior,[17] the &quot;stories&quot; the Respondents told were not so inconsistent as to\r\n  indicate criminal activity, and the absence of luggage in the back-seat area of\r\n  the Respondents' automobile provided no basis for a suspicion of a crime\r\n  particularly where the trunk, the usual place for luggage, &quot;was filled&quot;\r\n  with suitcases.Â  These matters and what weight to give them related solely to\r\n  questions of fact singularly committed to the trial court's discretion.[18]Â \r\n  Regarding the presence of air fresheners in the car, we read the trial court's\r\n  order as saying it found no evidence the car contained them in the first place.\r\nThe evidence\r\n  also supports the trial court's finding that Rivera's consent to search the\r\n  vehicle was invalid as the product of an unlawful detention.Â  The record\r\n  demonstrates a minimal amount of time passed between the illegal detention and\r\n  the ensuing consent,[19] there were no intervening circumstances, and, as stated above, Lane's actions\r\n  in prolonging the detention had no legal basis.[20] [21] Â Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON,\r\n  A.J., concurs.Â  PIEPER, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., dissenting: I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  The learned trial judge was very thorough in his analysis and I\r\n  believe all facets of the law were considered.Â  I also recognize the analysis\r\n  of the majority presents a close question.Â  However, unlike the majority, I\r\n  would find that the question of whether the purpose of the stop has been\r\n  completed is a mixed question of law and fact.Â  The moment at which a traffic\r\n  stop concludes is often a difficult legal question.Â  State v. Williams,\r\n  351 S.C. 591, 600-01, 571 S.E.2d 703, 708-09 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Since the\r\n  officer had not yet completed and issued the warning ticket and had not yet\r\n  even returned the driver's license/registration documents, I would find that\r\n  consent was obtained prior to any unlawful detention.Â  See United\r\n    States v. Branch, 537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir. 2008) (&quot;The maximum\r\n  acceptable length of a routine traffic stop cannot be stated with mathematical\r\n  precision.Â  Instead, the appropriate constitutional inquiry is whether the\r\n  detention lasted longer than was necessary, given its purpose.&quot;Â \r\n  &quot;[O]nce the driver has demonstrated that he is entitled to operate his\r\n  vehicle, and the police officer has issued the requisite warning or\r\n  ticket, the driver must be allowed to proceed on his way.&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added) (internal citations omitted); see also Williams, 351 S.C.\r\n  at 598, 571 S.E.2d at 707.\r\nNotwithstanding,\r\n  &quot;[o]nce the underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded,\r\n  any further detention for questioning is not automatically\r\n  unconstitutional.&quot;Â  State v. Tindall, 379, S.C. 304, 310, 665\r\n  S.E.2d 188, 192 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  I disagree with the majority's response and\r\n  concern that acceptance of the analysis in this dissent would lead to an\r\n  argument that the traffic stop arguably continued until Rivera received his\r\n  property after being released from jail.Â  I would distinguish this routine\r\n  traffic stop situation from a situation where a suspect has been arrested and\r\n  placed in jail.Â  Here, I would not find the consent rendered involuntary due to\r\n  coercion, duress, or some improper means.Â  Thus, since voluntary consent was\r\n  obtained during a lawful detention, I would reverse the suppression of the\r\n  State's evidence and remand the case for trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In his testimony, Lane stated he could not remember\r\n  what response Rivera gave when asked about what part of New York he had\r\n  visited.\r\n[3] State v.

Â Dr. Crosby's\r\n  December 2, 1998 office notes indicate that Fredrick reported problems with\r\n  lower back pain, which she attributed to being shot in the chest several years earlier\r\n  and having the bullet lodge near her lower spine.Â  The notes also indicate Fredrick\r\n  complained of occasional radiation down her right lower extremity.Â  Dr. Crosby\r\n  diagnosed FredrickÂ  with lower back pain and prescribed medication for the\r\n  pain.Â  In subsequent visits to Dr. Crosby, Fredrick continued complaining of\r\n  pain in her right leg and lower back.Â  Dr. Crosby then referred Fredrick to Dr.\r\n  Gregory Jones for further treatment.Â  Â Â \r\nDr. Jones' June 4, 1999 notes indicate that Fredrick complained of worsening right leg sciatica and\r\n  lower back pain.Â  The notes also indicate that Fredrick had a lengthy history\r\n  of lower back pain after a bullet from a gunshot lodged in her lower lumbar\r\n  region.Â  Dr. Jones recommended Fredrick undergo an MRI scan.Â  On June 12, 1999, Fredrick underwent a lumbar spine MRI that revealed a disc herniation at\r\n  the L4/L5 location of the spine.Â  On August 26, 1999, Fredrick underwent a right L4/L5 lumbar epidural steroid injection, but she experienced a recurrence of\r\n  pain several days later.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn early 2004, Wellman\r\n  laid off several employees, including Fredrick.Â  In August 2004, however, Wellman\r\n  rehired Fredrick and placed her in the position of &quot;blender-operator,&quot;\r\n  which required heavy lifting, bending, and twisting, unlike her previous\r\n  position as a spinning operator.Â  During the hiring process, Wellman gave\r\n  Fredrick a conditional offer of employment and then required her to complete a\r\n  medical history form.Â  The form included the following language:\r\n\r\n\tWellman, Inc. requires post-offer medical examinations which\r\n  are given to all employees in a particular category of employees, after an\r\n  offer of employment has been made, but prior to the time an employee begins\r\n  work for Wellman, Inc.Â  The results of this medical examination will not be\r\n  used to exclude an employee from his or her particular position unless the results\r\n  reveal the employee does not satisfy the employment criteria for the position,\r\n  and Wellman, Inc. can only provide a reasonable accommodation which will allow\r\n  the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Â Â \r\n\r\nThe form\r\n  also included the following question:Â  &quot;HAVE YOU HAD BACK TROUBLE OF ANY\r\n  KIND?&quot;Â  Fredrick responded &quot;NO.&quot;Â  \r\nSubsequently, on October 18, 2005, Fredrick was at work when she and a coworker tried to lift a box onto a\r\n  stand and, as a result, a roll of plastic fell from the stand.Â  When Fredrick\r\n  attempted to &quot;grab&quot; the roll and lift it back to the stand, she\r\n  immediately felt a sudden onset of pain in her back.Â  On November 15, 2005, Fredrick sought treatment from Dr. Anthony Alexander, complaining of lower back\r\n  pain with radiation into the right leg.Â  On January 19, 2006, Fredrick filed a written\r\n  claim for workers' compensation benefits (Form 50), alleging she had injured\r\n  her back and legs during the October 18 incident.Â  \r\nWellman's answer to\r\n  Fredrick's claim (Form 51) admitted minor lower back injury but denied any\r\n  injury to either leg.[2]Â \r\n  Under item 11 of Form 51, which allows the employer to set forth further\r\n  contentions or grounds of defense, Wellman stated it reserved the right to\r\n  amend the completed form.Â  Wellman began paying temporary benefits to Fredrick\r\n  on February 28, 2006 while it investigated her claim.Â  \r\nAfter months of conservative\r\n  treatment failed to relieve Fredrick's pain, Dr. Alexander referred her to Dr.\r\n  W.S. Edwards, Jr., for a surgical consultation on March 14, 2006.Â  Fredrick indicated that she wanted to proceed with surgery as soon as possible, and the\r\n  surgery was scheduled for July 24, 2006.Â  In the interim, Fredrick reconsidered\r\n  her decision to have the surgery due to the risks involved.[3]Â \r\n  On July 11, 2006, Fredrick called Dr. Edwards' office to advise him that she\r\n  wanted to cancel the surgery.Â  \r\nOn August 1, 2006,\r\n  Wellman filed a written request for a hearing to (1) terminate temporary\r\n  compensation based on Fredrick's refusal of medical treatment; (2) determine\r\n  the issue of permanent compensation; and (3) request credit for overpayment of\r\n  temporary compensation (Form 21).[4]Â \r\n  Wellman indicated on the Form 21 that the issue of &quot;permanent loss of use\r\n  (if any)&quot; was ripe for determination.Â  Wellman also indicated that it was\r\n  going to suspend temporary compensation on August 3, 2006.Â  \r\nA hearing was originally\r\n  scheduled for October 3, 2006.Â  On September 18, 2006, Wellman filed a prehearing\r\n  brief (Form 58) indicating that the issues to be determined at the upcoming hearing\r\n  were (1) whether Fredrick's claim should be barred due to her concealment of\r\n  her history of back problems prior to beginning her position as a\r\n  blender-operator with Wellman; and (2) whether Fredrick's refusal of medical\r\n  treatment, namely, the surgery offered by Dr. Edwards, was unreasonable.Â  \r\nFredrick failed to appear\r\n  at the October 3 hearing, but counsel for both parties participated in a prehearing\r\n  conference conducted by the single commissioner, which included discussion of\r\n  Wellman's fraud defense.Â  The single commissioner rescheduled the hearing for November 15, 2006.Â  According to Wellman's counsel, on October 31, 2006, Wellman advised\r\n  Fredrick and the Commission that it would rely on its previously filed prehearing\r\n  brief, which indicated Wellman was asserting fraud as a defense.Â  \r\nAfter the November 15\r\n  hearing, the single commissioner issued a written decision denying Fredrick's\r\n  claim for benefits due to her concealment of her prior back problems when she\r\n  applied for the blender-operator position with Wellman.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner did not address the issue of Fredrick's refusal of medical\r\n  treatment.Â  The Commission's Appellate Panel adopted the single commissioner's findings\r\n  of fact and rulings of law and incorporated the single commissioner's decision\r\n  into its order.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel's decision and\r\n  specifically concluded that Wellman was not aware of Fredrick's concealment of\r\n  her prior back problems until it reviewed medical records that had been\r\n  subpoenaed during the discovery process of the case.Â  Neither the Appellate\r\n  Panel nor the circuit court addressed the issue of Fredrick's refusal of\r\n  medical treatment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Was Wellman's fraud defense properly before the single commissioner\r\n  during the November 15, 2006 hearing?\r\n\t2.&nbsp; Does the evidence support the Appellate Panel's findings on the elements\r\n  of Wellman's fraud defense?[5]\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nI.&nbsp; Propriety of fraud defense\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions by the\r\n  Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission.&nbsp; See Lark\r\n    v.

App.&nbsp;2007)&nbsp;.Â Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFredrick challenges the\r\n  circuit court's order, which upheld the denial of benefits, on three grounds:Â \r\n  (1) Wellman's fraud defense was not properly before the single commissioner at\r\n  the November 15, 2006 hearing; (2) the evidence does not support the Appellate\r\n  Panel's findings on the elements of the fraud defense; and (3) her refusal of\r\n  medical treatment was justified.Â  We conclude that Wellman's fraud defense was\r\n  properly before the single commissioner at the November 15, 2006 hearing.Â  We\r\n  further conclude that the evidence supports the Appellate Panel's findings on\r\n  the elements of Wellman's fraud defense.Â  Therefore, we need not reach the\r\n  issue of whether Fredrick was justified in refusing medical treatment.&nbsp; See Whiteside\r\n    v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886,\r\n  889 (1993) (holding that the appellate court need not\r\n  address the remaining issues of an appeal when the resolution of a prior issue\r\n  is dispositive).\r\nI.&nbsp; Propriety of fraud defense\r\nFredrick asserts that\r\n  Wellman's fraud defense was not properly before the single commissioner at the\r\n  November 15, 2006 hearing because (1) the fraud defense was time-barred due to\r\n  Wellman's failure to assert this defense within 150 days from the date the\r\n  injury was first reported, as allegedly required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260\r\n  (Supp. 2008); and (2) Wellman failed to raise the fraud defense in its Form 21,\r\n  Employer's Request for Hearing, which Wellman filed on August 1, 2006.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Whether\r\n  fraud defense was time-barred\r\nSection 42-9-260 authorizes\r\n  separate sets of procedures for terminating or suspending temporary disability\r\n  payments.Â  The particular set of procedures to be applied depends on the time\r\n  that has passed since the injury was first reported.Â  Within 150 days after the\r\n  injury was first reported, the payments may be suspended or terminated immediately without a prior hearing, and the employee may later request a hearing to have\r\n  the payments reinstated.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260(B) and (C) (Supp. 2008) (emphasis\r\n  added). Â However, after 150 days have expired, an evidentiary hearing must be provided to the recipient before payments may be terminated or\r\n  suspended. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260(F) (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  In any\r\n  event, an employer may request a hearing at any time to address\r\n  termination or reduction of temporary disability payments.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260(E)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Regs.\r\n  67-504, -505, and -506 (Supp. 2008) implement the procedures authorized by S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260 (Supp. 2008).Â  Regs. 67-504 governs the termination of\r\n  temporary compensation during the first 150 days after the employer's\r\n  notice of the injury.Â  Regs. 67-505 governs the suspension of temporary\r\n  compensation after the first 150 days, and Regs. 67-506 governs the\r\n  termination of temporary compensation after the first 150 days.Â \r\n  Further, South Carolina Code Regs. 67-208(C) (Supp. 2008) requires an employer\r\n  to file a Form 21, Employer's Request for Hearing, when the employer seeks a\r\n  hearing for permission to terminate temporary compensation after the expiration\r\n  of the first 150 days pursuant to 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-506 (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Form 21 sets forth a checklist of alternative reasons for the employer's\r\n  hearing request.Â Â  Â Â \r\nFredrick argues that once\r\n  150 days from the first report of injury have expired, payments may be\r\n  terminated or suspended for only those reasons set forth in Regs. 67-505 and\r\n  -506 and Form 21.Â  Fredrick claims that Wellman could not terminate her\r\n  benefits on the ground of employee fraud because such a ground is not\r\n  specifically enumerated in Regs. 67-505 or -506 or in Form 21 as a reason for suspension\r\n  or termination of benefits. Â However, South Carolina Code Section 42-9-260(F)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) allows suspension or termination of payments after the 150 days have\r\n  expired for any cause:\r\n\r\n\tAfter the one-hundred-fifty-day period has expired, the [C]ommission\r\n  shall provide by regulation the method and procedure by which benefits may be\r\n  suspended or terminated for any cause, but the regulation must provide\r\n  for an evidentiary hearing and [C]ommission approval prior to termination or\r\n  suspension unless such prior hearing is expressly waived in writing by the\r\n  recipient or the circumstances identified in Section 42-9-260(B)(1) or (B)(2)\r\n  are present. Â \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Therefore, the fact that Regs. 67-505, -506 and Form 21 list only\r\n  certain grounds for termination or suspension of payments is more of a\r\n  curiosity than a binding statement of exclusive grounds for termination or\r\n  suspension of paymentsâ€”it is beyond question that the plain language of the\r\n  enabling statute is controlling.Â  See S.C. Coastal Conservation\r\n    League v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 380 S.C. 349, 375,\r\n  669 S.E.2d 899, 912 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding that administrative agencies' regulations cannot conflict with\r\n  or alter the statute conferring authority).Â  Because South Carolina Code\r\n  Section 42-9-260(F) permits an employer to terminate benefits for any cause\r\n  after the expiration of the 150 days, Wellman's fraud defense was properly\r\n  before the single commissioner at the November 15 hearing.\r\nB.&nbsp; Omission\r\n  of fraud defense from Form 21\r\nFredrick also argues that\r\n  even if the fraud defense could still be raised after the expiration of 150\r\n  days from the first report of injury, the omission of Wellman's fraud defense\r\n  from its Form 21, Employer's Request for Hearing, precluded the single commissioner\r\n  from considering the defense at the November 15 hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Regs.\r\n  67-208(C) (Supp. 2008) requires an employer to file a Form 21 when the employer\r\n  seeks a hearing for permission to terminate temporary compensation after the expiration\r\n  of 150 days from notice of the employee's injury pursuant to 25A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 67-506 (Supp. 2008).Â  Further, South Carolina Code Section 42-9-260(E)\r\n  allows an employer to request such a hearing at any time.\r\nHere, Wellman filed its Form\r\n  21 on August 1, 2006.Â  The Form 21 request for a hearing on termination of temporary\r\n  compensation was based solely on Fredrick's refusal of medical treatmentâ€”Fredrick's\r\n  concealment of her prior back condition is the very reason Wellman did not\r\n  discover the prior condition until after it filed its Form 21.Â  In any event, Wellman's\r\n  prehearing brief, which was filed on September 18, 2006, ultimately provided Fredrick and the Commission with almost two months advance notice that Wellman\r\n  was seeking a hearing on its fraud defense as well.[7]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nFurther, Wellman had\r\n  reserved the right to amend its Form 51 Answer, and the prehearing brief\r\n  effectively amended the Answer.Â  Moreover, on October 3, the single\r\n  commissioner and counsel for both parties discussed Wellman's assertion of the\r\n  fraud defense, and on October 31, Wellman advised Fredrick and the Commission\r\n  that it would rely on its previously filed prehearing brief. Â Therefore,\r\n  Fredrick was provided with ample notice that Wellman intended to raise the\r\n  fraud defense at the November 15 hearing.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, Wellman's\r\n  fraud defense was properly before the single commissioner at the November 15\r\n  hearing.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Findings on elements of fraud defense\r\nFredrick\r\n  argues that the Appellate Panel and the circuit court erred in finding that the\r\n  evidence supported the elements of Wellman's fraud defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  employee's false statement in an employment application will bar workers'\r\n  compensation benefits when: (1) the employee knowingly and willfully made a\r\n  false representation as to his physical condition; (2) the employer relied upon\r\n  the false representation and this reliance was a substantial factor in the\r\n  hiring; and (3) there was a causal connection between the false representation\r\n  and the injury. Â Cooper, 260 S.C. at 468,\r\n  196 S.E.2d at 835.Â  Here, there is ample evidence to support the Appellate\r\n  Panel's findings on the Cooper elements.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Knowing False Representation\r\nThe evidence in the record supports the Appellate\r\n  Panel's finding that Fredrick knowingly falsified her preemployment medical\r\n  questionnaire as to her previous back problems.Â  Fredrick's medical records\r\n  from December 1998 to September 1999 show she received significant testing and\r\n  treatment for lower back pain and a disc herniation.Â  However, the medical\r\n  history form she completed for Wellman in 2004 indicated she had no prior back\r\n  problemsâ€”she responded &quot;NO&quot; to the question &quot;HAVE YOU HAD BACK TROUBLE OF ANY KIND?&quot; Additionally,\r\n  none of the past injuries or illnesses that she, in\r\n  fact, listed on the form could have reasonably alerted a prospective employer\r\n  to any impact on her spine.Â  Likewise, Fredrick confirmed her written responses\r\n  on the form when questioned by a staff nurse at Wellman.Â  Further, there is no credible\r\n  evidence in the record that indicates Fredrick had significant memory problems\r\n  when she completed the form or that otherwise explains the appearance of\r\n  deception on Fredrick's part.Â  Therefore, the record as a whole supports the Appellate\r\n  Panel's finding that Fredrick knew she was concealing the truth from Wellman\r\n  when she completed the medical history form.\r\nB.&nbsp; Employer's Reliance\r\nFredrick\r\n  argues that because she completed her medical history form after she had been\r\n  hired, Wellman could not have relied on the form in hiring her and that,\r\n  therefore, there could be no fraud as a matter of law.Â  However, Wellman's use\r\n  of the phrase &quot;conditional offer of employment&quot; on the front of its\r\n  medical history form indicates an intent to condition the offer of employment for\r\n  a specific position on the results of a medical examination:\r\n\r\n\tThe results of this medical examination will not be used to\r\n  exclude an employee from his or her particular position unless the results\r\n    reveal the employee does not satisfy the employment criteria for the position,\r\n  and Wellman, Inc. can only provide a reasonable accommodation which will allow\r\n  the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tDO NOT COMPLETE UNTIL A CONDITIONAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN MADE[.]Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Thus, Wellman's reliance on the medical\r\n  history form was undoubtedly a substantial factor in hiring Fredrick for the\r\n  specific position in which she was placed.Â  In fact, Wellman's Human Resources\r\n  Representative, Eugene Carmichael, stated that if Fredrick had revealed her\r\n  back problems, he would have checked to see if there was another open position\r\n  in the plant that she was capable of filling.Â  He also testified that a\r\n  blender-operator was required to do repetitive lifting of 50 pounds and that\r\n  there were not many reasonable accommodations that Wellman could make for\r\n  someone with a history of lower back problems.Â  Further, Linda Parsons, a staff\r\n  nurse for Wellman, testified that if Fredrick had revealed her history of\r\n  treatment for lower back problems, Parsons would not have cleared Fredrick to\r\n  work as a blender-operator without a further investigation.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the Appellate Panel properly found that Wellman relied on the\r\n  misrepresentation Fredrick made after she received the conditional offer of employment\r\n  and that it was a substantial factor in her hiring.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Causal Connection\r\nAdditional\r\n  testimony from Parsons and Carmichael supported the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  that there was a causal connection between Fredrick's concealment of her\r\n  condition and her injury.Â  The testimony of both witnesses established that\r\n  Fredrick would not have been exposed to the risks of lifting heavy objects and\r\n  would not have been in the position to be injured had she been truthful about\r\n  her medical history.Â  Additionally, Fredrick's treating physician, Dr. W.S.\r\n  Edwards, Jr., testified that Fredrick's preexisting disc herniation was the\r\n  same disc herniation for which he treated her following her October 18, 2005 work accident.Â  He further testified that if he had been Fredrick's\r\n  treating physician before Wellman rehired her, he would have recommended she\r\n  avoid any work requiring repetitive bending, lifting, twisting, or turning.Â  \r\nAs to the determination of witness credibility,\r\n  the single commissioner found that Fredrick was not credible, and the Appellate\r\n  Panel adopted that finding.Â  In contrast, the single commissioner implicitly\r\n  found Dr. Edwards, Linda Parsons, and Eugene Carmichael to be credible and used\r\n  the testimony of those witnesses to support her findings.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the evidence supports the Appellate Panel's findings on the\r\n  elements of Wellman's fraud defense.Â  Therefore, we affirm the Appellate Panel's\r\n  findings.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit\r\n  court's order upholding the Appellate Panel's findings of fact and conclusions\r\n  of law is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wellman is self-insured as permitted by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-5-20 (Supp. 2008).\r\n[2] South Carolina Code Regs. 67-203 (Supp. 2008) requires the employer to file\r\n  Form 51, Employer's Answer to Request for Hearing, when it seeks to file a\r\n  response to the employee's notice of claim or request for a hearing.Â  \r\n[3] In 2001, Fredrick learned that she had AIDS.Â  Therefore, after consulting with\r\n  Dr. Edwards about the surgery option, she became concerned about her increased\r\n  risk of infection from the surgery.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] South Carolina Code Regs. 67-208(C) (Supp. 2008) requires an employer to file a\r\n  Form 21, Employer's Request for Hearing, when the employer seeks a hearing for\r\n  permission to terminate temporary compensation after the expiration of 150 days\r\n  from the employer's notice of the injury.Â  Form 21 sets forth a checklist of\r\n  alternative reasons for the employer's hearing request.Â  \r\n[5] Because we affirm the circuit court on both of these issues, we need not reach the\r\n  third issue raised by Fredrick on appealâ€”whether Fredrick was justified in\r\n  refusing medical treatment.&nbsp; See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One,\r\n  311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding\r\n  that the appellate court need not address the remaining issues of an appeal when\r\n  the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive). \r\n[6] In a previous case, \r\nJones\r\n  v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413,\r\n  416-19, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113-14&nbsp;(2003), the Supreme Court applied the substantial\r\n  evidence standard of review to the\r\n  issue of whether an employee's claim was barred due to her fraud in\r\n  completing an employment application.Â \r\n  We note that in the instant case, the evidence allows us to affirm the\r\n  Appellate Panel's findings under either the preponderance of the evidence\r\n  standard or the substantial evidence standard.Â  Â Â Â \r\n[7] Although the hearing on Wellman's request to terminate temporary compensation\r\n  was originally scheduled for October 3, 2006, the hearing was continued to November\r\n  15 because Fredrick failed to appear on October 3.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4600","title":"Divine v.

Hamel, of Pawleys Island, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.: Josette Robbins (Mother) appeals the family court's decision to award\r\n  John Divine (Father) sole custody of their six-year-old child (Daughter)\r\n  because it was against Daughter's best interests.Â  Mother asserts the family\r\n  court placed undue reliance on Father's expert witness and erred in several\r\n  evidentiary rulings, which resulted in the family court making improper\r\n  credibility determinations regarding the parties and their witnesses.Â  Mother\r\n  also contends her counsel's ineffective representation prevented her from\r\n  having a meaningful final hearing in violation of her due process rights. Â We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt present, Mother is 40 years old and Father is 42 years old.Â \r\n  Mother and Father were involved in a romantic relationship from 1998 until 2002\r\n  but never married or lived together.Â  The parties first met when Mother was a\r\n  waitress at one of the restaurants that Father owns in the Myrtle Beach area.[1]Â  While Mother and Father stated they were\r\n  initially in love, their relationship progressively deteriorated due to\r\n  Mother's erratic behavior, jealousy issues, and physical violence towards and\r\n  harassment of Father.Â  As a result of Mother's behavior, Father ended the\r\n  relationship in February 2002.Â  Despite the break-up, the parties still\r\n  maintained contact, and in July 2002, Mother became pregnant.Â  Daughter was\r\n  born on May 4, 2003.Â  In addition to Daughter, each party has one daughter from\r\n  another relationship.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, Mother testified that Father initially\r\n  denied being Daughter's father and urged Mother to have an abortion on several\r\n  occasions.Â  Mother also stated that Father provided no emotional support during\r\n  her pregnancy and did not provide any financial support until several months\r\n  after Daughter's birth.Â  In contrast, Father stated that while he was initially\r\n  uncertain whether Daughter was his child due to the status of his relationship with\r\n  Mother when she became pregnant, he readily accepted responsibility for\r\n  Daughter as soon as a paternity test identified him as Daughter's father.Â  \r\nTo provide financial support, Father paid Mother's medical bills;\r\n  purchased baby furniture for Mother's home; bought maternity clothes for Mother;\r\n  sent Mother a $3,000 check for Daughter in July 2003, which Mother tore up and\r\n  mailed back to Father; and sent Mother a $4,000 check approximately six\r\n  months after Daughter's birth for her support, which Mother accepted.Â  Despite\r\n  Father's earnest efforts to be involved in Daughter's life, Mother allowed\r\n  Father to visit Daughter only in Mother's home and at times convenient to\r\n  Mother.Â  Mother testified that she wanted Father to visit Daughter in her home\r\n  because Daughter was a premature baby and Father had no previous experience\r\n  with small children.Â  Father claimed that Mother told him the only way he could\r\n  see Daughter on a regular basis was if he agreed to marry Mother.Â  Mother, on\r\n  the other hand, testified that she initially attempted to establish a regular\r\n  visitation schedule with Father, but Father was unwilling to come on set days\r\n  because his schedule changed often due to his business.Â  \r\nFather initially attempted to resolve the\r\n  custody and visitations issues directly with Mother.Â  When this was\r\n  unsuccessful, Father employed an attorney in October 2003 to contact Mother to\r\n  establish a regular visitation schedule and to offer $1,400 per month in child\r\n  support.Â  In response, Mother told Father that she would only permit regular\r\n  visitation of Daughter if ordered to do so by a judge.Â  Mother then denied\r\n  Father visitation with Daughter for a period of five weeks in an effort to\r\n  &quot;push him to come up with a schedule.&quot;Â  \r\nAs a result of the visitation issues, Father filed the instant\r\n  action on November 17, 2003, requesting joint custody of Daughter, visitation,\r\n  the establishment of child support obligations, the right to conduct discovery,\r\n  and mutual restraining orders.Â  On December 18, 2003, the parties agreed to\r\n  give Mother temporary custody of Daughter pending a final hearing on the merits\r\n  and specified visitation arrangements and child support.Â  The following day,\r\n  Mother filed an answer and counterclaim, requesting custody, child support, and\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  \r\nAs time passed, Father became increasingly concerned about\r\n  Mother's psychological state and its effect upon her ability to parent and care\r\n  for Daughter.Â  Consequently, on May 19, 2004, Father moved to amend his\r\n  pleadings to request sole custody of Daughter and sought a court-ordered\r\n  psychiatric evaluation for Mother and a court-appointed guardian ad litem for\r\n  Daughter.Â  In response, the family court permitted Father to amend his\r\n  pleadings to request sole custody of Daughter and confirmed the parties' choice\r\n  of Melissa Emery as Daughter's guardian ad litem.[2]Â  The family court did not require\r\n  Mother to submit to a psychiatric evaluation at that time.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 21, 2004, Mother's counsel filed a motion to be relieved as counsel,\r\n  citing his inability to effectively communicate with Mother.Â  The family court then granted Mother's first of three requests\r\n  to continue the final hearing originally set for November 4, 2004 in order to\r\n  find substitute counsel.Â  To accommodate Mother, the family court rescheduled\r\n  the final hearing two more times prior to the final hearing. \r\nIn\r\n  March 2005, Father filed a motion to compel discovery, and he again requested a\r\n  psychiatric evaluation for Mother. Â On April 18, 2005, the family court\r\n  granted Father's request to compel discovery and ordered Mother to submit to a\r\n  psychiatric evaluation at Father's expense.Â  On June 22, 2005, C. Barton\r\n  Saylor, PhD., a licensed clinical psychologist and diplomate in forensic\r\n  psychology, conducted a psychiatric evaluation of Mother and testified as to\r\n  his conclusions at the final hearing.Â  \r\nThe final seven-day hearing took place on September 12 and 15, 2005, and then reconvened on\r\n  October 13, 14, 25, 27, and 28, 2005.Â  In its\r\n  thirty-two page final order, the family court made numerous findings in support\r\n  of its decision to award sole custody of Daughter to Father.Â  Although the\r\n  family court acknowledged that joint custody was a permissible alternative,\r\n  based on the continued hostilities between the parties and the lack of Mother's\r\n  ability to maintain a cooperative co-parenting relationship with Father, the\r\n  family court found Daughter's best interests would be served by granting Father\r\n  sole custody of Daughter.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nMother presents the following arguments as to why the\r\n  family court's decision to award sole custody to Father was erroneous:Â  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1) \r\n\t\t\tThe family\r\n  court's award of custody was against Daughter's best interests.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tThe family\r\n  court placed undue reliance on Father's expert\r\n  witness, whose testimony was incomplete and biased in favor of Father.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\tThe family court erred in several evidentiary rulings, which prevented Mother\r\n  from presenting complete and probative evidence at the final hearing. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)\r\n\t\t\tThe family court's undue reliance on Father's expert witness and improper\r\n  evidentiary rulings resulted in the family court making improper credibility determinations\r\n  regarding the parties and their witnesses.Â  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5) \r\n\t\t\tThe family court failed to provide Mother with a meaningful final hearing in\r\n  violation of her substantive due process rights due to her counsel's lack of\r\n  preparation and ineffective representation at the final hearing. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Epperly\r\n    v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1994).Â  However, this\r\n  broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the burden of\r\n  convincing us that the family court committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189-90, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  Nor are we required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard\r\n  the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimonies.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson,\r\n  276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981). \r\nWith respect to custody determinations, the appellate courts have\r\n  consistently shown deference to the family court in electing between fit\r\n  parents.Â  Altman v. Griffith, 372 S.C. 388, 393, 642 S.E.2d 619, 621 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  &quot;In gauging between fit parents as to\r\n  who would better serve the best interests and welfare of the child in a\r\n  custodial setting, the family court judge is in a superior position to\r\n  appellate judges who are left only to review the cold record.&quot;Â  Altman,\r\n  372 S.C. at 393, 642 S.E.2d at 622.Â  For this reason, custody decisions are\r\n  matters left largely to the discretion of the family court.Â  Stroman v.\r\n    Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 378, 353 S.E.2d 704, 705 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Best Interests of Daughter\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court's decision to grant Father sole custody of Daughter was\r\n  against Daughter's best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the child's\r\n  welfare and best interests.Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d\r\n  612, 614 (1978).Â  In determining custody, the family court â€œmust consider the\r\n  character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent as\r\n  they impact the child.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d\r\n  154, 157 (1996).Â  Because all relevant factors must be taken into\r\n  consideration, the family court should also review the â€œpsychological,\r\n  physical, environmental, spiritual, educational, medical, family, emotional and\r\n  recreational aspectsâ€ of the child's life.Â  Id.Â  In other words, the\r\n  totality of circumstances unique to each particular case â€œconstitutes the only\r\n  scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€Â  Parris v. Parris,\r\n  319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1995).\r\nIn the case at hand,\r\n  the family court clearly considered the totality of circumstances in\r\n  determining that Daughter's best interests would be served by awarding custody\r\n  to Father.Â Â  In a very thorough final order, the family\r\n  court made numerous in-depth findings to support its decision to award custody\r\n  of Daughter to Father, including: Daughter's welfare, the parties' history of\r\n  domestic violence, the parties' conduct, Dr. Saylor's expert opinion, the\r\n  fitness of each party to handle Daughter's physical and emotional needs, the\r\n  willingness of each party to facilitate the relationship between Daughter and\r\n  the other parent, the financial and physical resources of the parties, the\r\n  stability of each party's home, the amount of time each party has to spend with\r\n  Daughter, each party's family network of support, child care availability, the\r\n  loving relationship between Daughter and each party, religious training,\r\n  primary caretaker status, immoral conduct of each party, the guardian ad litem's opinion, and each party's respect for court orders.Â  The family court's\r\n  in-depth findings show that it properly considered the fitness of each parent\r\n  and the relevant factors that would affect Daughter's best interests in making\r\n  its custody determination.Â  See Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C.\r\n  284, 296, 596 S.E.2d 505, 512 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;When determining to whom\r\n  custody shall be awarded, the court should consider all the circumstances of\r\n  the particular case and all relevant factors must be taken into\r\n  consideration.&quot;).\r\nThe family court stressed that each party came before the court on\r\n  equal footing, but after &quot;[h]aving adequate opportunity to carefully\r\n  consider all relevant factors relating to custody . . . the best\r\n  interest of the child would be served by granting sole legal and physical\r\n  custody to Plaintiff Father.&quot; (emphasis in original). Â See Brown\r\n    v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 90, 606 S.E.2d 785, 788 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œThe\r\n  paramount and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interests\r\n  of the [child].â€).Â  Mother claims that &quot;the pivotal issue [in determining\r\n  custody] became who was to blame for the outbursts and altercations between the\r\n  parties.&quot; Â However, the family court's order considered Mother's behavior and\r\n  the tumultuous nature of the parties' relationship as only one of many factors\r\n  in its decision, as is statutorily required in resolving custody issues.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-15-40 (Supp. 2008) (formerly S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1530) (stating\r\n  that in making a decision regarding child custody, the family court must, in\r\n  addition to other factors, give weight to evidence of domestic violence).Â  \r\nA majority of Mother's argument on appeal centers around the\r\n  lengthy and dramatic history of the parties' relationship with little focus on\r\n  why Mother is better suited to be Daughter's primary caretaker.Â  While much of both\r\n  parties' testimony at the final hearing focused on the parties' relationship,\r\n  Mother has failed to sufficiently highlight evidence proving that the family\r\n  court's award of custody to Father was contrary to Daughter's best interests.Â  See Jones v. Ard, 265 S.C. 423, 426, 219 S.E.2d 358, 359-60 (1975) (finding\r\n  that when both parties are fit and proper to have custody, the family court\r\n  must make the election, and this Court must defer to its decision when the\r\n  family court's findings and conclusions are supported by the record).Â  Therefore,\r\n  Mother has failed to sustain her burden of convincing this Court that the\r\n  family court did not consider the Daughter's welfare and best interests in its\r\n  custody decision.Â  See Shorb v. Shorb, 372 S.C. 623, 628, 643\r\n  S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot;The burden is upon the appellant to\r\n  convince this Court that the family court erred in its findings of\r\n  fact.&quot;).Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Dr. Saylor's Testimony\r\nMother asserts the family court abused its discretion by placing\r\n  undue weight and reliance on Husband's expert witness, Dr. Saylor, because Dr.\r\n  Saylor's testimony was biased and imbalanced.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  the final hearing, Dr. Saylor testified as to his conclusions from his meeting\r\n  with Mother.Â  After being qualified as an expert in clinical psychology, Dr.\r\n  Saylor stated that in his twenty-three years of practice, he had conducted over\r\n  1,500 parental capacity evaluations in cases when child custody was an issue.Â \r\n  Dr. Saylor stated that Mother described herself as &quot;pretty laid\r\n  back,&quot; which was not consistent with his observations that she was\r\n  &quot;defensive, argumentative, and evasive.&quot;Â  He also stated that she\r\n  failed to provide information to him in a straightforward manner, and when he\r\n  pointed out inconsistencies in her own statements, she became very defensive\r\n  and accused Dr. Saylor of misunderstanding her.Â  In concluding that\r\n  Mother had a narcissistic personality disorder,[3] Dr. Saylor said that this disorder could be a liability to parenting because\r\n  Mother was inclined to focus on how a situation affected her as opposed to\r\n  Daughter.Â  Additionally, he believed Mother was not open to honest\r\n  self-exploration, refused to admit any legitimate problems, faults, or\r\n  weaknesses, and tended to project responsibility for her own actions onto\r\n  others.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reviewing Dr. Saylor's testimony at the final hearing, the family court stated\r\n  that although it &quot;by no means . . . delegated any decision as to custody\r\n  to any expert[,]&quot; it was particularly concerned with Dr. Saylor's opinion\r\n  that Mother &quot;'appeared to have no concept of how to maintain a cooperative\r\n  co-parenting relationship with the father of her child and no motivation to\r\n  develop a more cooperative relationship unless it was on her own terms.'&quot;Â \r\n  Further, the family court found these issues could interfere with Daughter's\r\n  best interests based on Dr. Saylor's opinion that &quot;[Mother] is likely to\r\n  continue to maintain a hostile, suspicious, and provocative attitude when\r\n  dealing with [Father], which may create drama and disturbance for their\r\n  daughter and could lead to long-term emotional problems for the child.&quot;Â  \r\nMother's\r\n  argument concerns the question of credibility and the probative value to be\r\n  placed upon Dr. Saylor's testimony.Â  Resolving\r\n  questions of credibility is the function of the family court judge who heard\r\n  the witnesses' testimony.Â  Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 298 S.C. 144,\r\n  147, 378 S.E.2d 609, 611 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Because the appellate court\r\n  lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord\r\n  great deference to the family court's findings when matters of credibility are\r\n  involved.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 329, 536 S.E.2d 427, 429\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThis is especially true in cases involving the welfare and\r\n  best interests of children.â€Â  Aiken County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox,\r\n  304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nMother alleges that\r\n  Dr. Saylor's conclusions were &quot;carefully constructed&quot; to favor\r\n  Father, but she has presented no credible evidence to substantiate this claim.Â \r\n  Dr. Saylor stated that his conclusions and assessment of Mother's mental state\r\n  were based on four specific tests that are customarily used and accepted in the\r\n  clinical psychology field.Â  Mother never objected to Dr. Saylor's\r\n  qualification as an expert in clinical psychology or to the methods employed by\r\n  Dr. Saylor in evaluating Mother's mental state.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Saylor's\r\n  conclusions could not have been influenced by Father as Dr. Saylor testified\r\n  that he never spoke to or even met Father prior to the final hearing.Â  \r\nDr. Saylor acknowledged that Father's attorney and\r\n  Daughter's guardian ad litem provided him with witness affidavits prior to the\r\n  evaluation, but he initially reviewed them only to determine whether there was\r\n  any foundation for an interview.Â  Dr. Saylor stated that his conclusions\r\n  in his report were drawn from information provided to him directly by Mother at\r\n  the evaluation.Â  He specifically confirmed that it was &quot;beyond the scope\r\n  of [his] evaluation&quot; to determine the accuracy of the witness affidavits,\r\n  but they &quot;at least appear[ed] to be the foundation that the concerns about\r\n  [Mother's] behavior and temper were not simply the product of a series of\r\n  manufactured claims by the father of her daughter.&quot; Â \r\nDr. Saylor's report\r\n  and statements at the final hearing do not indicate a predisposed bias in favor\r\n  of Father, but rather serve to substantiate his conclusion as to Mother's\r\n  mental state.Â  The family court, as the trier of fact, properly weighed\r\n  Dr. Saylor's testimony against all the other evidence presented at the final\r\n  hearing in determining the weight that his testimony should be afforded.Â  See Terwilliger, 298 S.C. at 147, 378 S.E.2d at\r\n  611 (stating that the family court, as the fact finder, determines the\r\n  weight to be given to testimony); Altman, 372 S.C. at 401, 642 S.E.2d at\r\n  626 (finding that because an expert's testimony was not the only evidence\r\n  tending to establish that the mother was self-absorbed and self-pitying, the\r\n  family court's consideration of the expert's testimony in conjunction with\r\n  other evidence was proper in its decision to award custody of child to the\r\n  father).Â  \r\nMother also contends that Dr. Saylor's evaluation was\r\n  imbalanced by design because Dr. Saylor failed to evaluate Father and failed to\r\n  interview Daughter or any witnesses with personal knowledge of the parties'\r\n  interactions.Â  Despite this contention, Mother never attempted to request an\r\n  evaluation of Father or to object to the accuracy of Dr. Saylor's evaluation of\r\n  her based on Dr. Saylor not evaluating Father or interviewing other witnesses.Â \r\n  Nor did she present any contrary rebuttal evidence of her own to refute Dr\r\n  Saylor's conclusions.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Saylor's failure to interview other\r\n  witnesses did not compromise his evaluation of Mother because the purpose of\r\n  Mother's court-ordered psychological evaluation was not to make a custody\r\n  recommendation.Â  As stated in his report, Dr. Saylor conducted the evaluation\r\n  for &quot;the purpose of . . . provid[ing] information regarding [Mother's]\r\n  current psychological adjustment.&quot;Â  \r\nIf the exclusive purpose\r\n  of Dr. Saylor's interview had been to make a custody recommendation, the better\r\n  practice would have been to interview Father; however, the failure to interview\r\n  Father would not in itself be fatal.Â  See Terwillinger, 298 S.C. at 147, 378 S.E.2d at 611 (refuting\r\n  father's claim that the family court erred in its custody decision by giving\r\n  undue consideration to the testimony of mother's expert witness, a clinical\r\n  psychologist, despite psychologist not testing or communicating with the\r\n  father).Â  In sum, because it was the family court's duty to resolve credibility\r\n  issues, the family court did not err in assessing the probative value of Dr.\r\n  Saylor's testimony in its custody determination.Â  See Thompson v.\r\n    Brunson, 283 S.C. 221, 228, 321 S.E.2d 622, 626 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding\r\n  the family court was in the best position to assess the veracity of the\r\n  testimony of witnesses).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Evidentiary Rulings\r\nMother objects to several statements at the final\r\n  hearing on the grounds that the admission of these statements was both\r\n  erroneous and prejudicial.Â  We disagree on all claims of error. \r\nTo warrant reversal\r\n  based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must\r\n  prove both error and resulting prejudice.Â  Altman, 372 S.C. at 401, 642\r\n  S.E.2d at 626.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Dr. Saylor's Qualifications\r\nMother first\r\n  contends that the family court erroneously qualified Dr. Saylor as an expert in\r\n  child speech developmental delay because (1) his resume fails to support this\r\n  qualification; and (2) no notice was given to Mother that Dr. Saylor would be\r\n  called as an expert in this field.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile Mother\r\n  objects to the family court recognizing Dr. Saylor as an expert on child speech\r\n  developmental delays, Mother sets forth no argument or supporting authority to\r\n  indicate how the family court's ruling was in error or how it prejudiced her at\r\n  the final hearing.Â  See Hunt v. Forestry Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564,\r\n  573, 595 S.E.2d 846, 851 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that issues raised in a brief\r\n  but not supported by authority are deemed abandoned and will not be considered\r\n  on appeal); Jenkins v. E.L. Long Motor Lines Inc., 233 S.C. 87, 94, 103\r\n  S.E.2d 523, 527 (1958) (stating that the trial court's ruling on the\r\n  qualification of an expert would not be disturbed in the absence of an abuse of\r\n  discretion and prejudice to the complaining party). Â Thus, this issue is\r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (requiring the\r\n  citation of authority in the argument portion of an appellant's brief); First\r\n    Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting\r\n  that when a party fails to cite authority or when the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is deemed to have\r\n  abandoned the issue on appeal). \r\nAdditionally, Mother's\r\n  argument regarding notice is not preserved for review because she never\r\n  objected to Dr. Saylor's testimony on this ground at the final hearing.Â  In\r\n    re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may\r\n  not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for\r\n  appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v.\r\n    Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004)\r\n  (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate\r\n  court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court.â€).Â  Even if Mother preserved this issue, she fails to set forth\r\n  any argument as to how a lack of notice regarding the family court's\r\n  qualification of Dr. Saylor as an expert in child speech developmental delay\r\n  prejudiced her.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 499, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  854, 858 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding that appellant seeking reversal must show\r\n  both error and prejudice).Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Guardian Ad Litem's\r\n  Statements\r\nNext, Mother argues\r\n  the guardian ad litem's statement that Mother was &quot;insanely jealous&quot;\r\n  was improper because she was neither qualified to give such an opinion pursuant\r\n  to Rule 701, SCRE, nor was Mother provided with notice that the guardian would\r\n  be testifying as an expert witness.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the final\r\n  hearing, Daughter's guardian ad litem, Mr. Padgett, questioned the previous\r\n  guardian ad litem, Ms. Emery, regarding her assessment of Mother's behavior\r\n  towards Father, specifically asking, &quot;Would this be a fair statement to\r\n  characterize [Mother's] anger problems or things that she has done as some\r\n  woman who is insanely jealous over the father of her baby?&quot;Â  In response,\r\n  Ms. Emery stated, &quot;That would be fair.&quot;Â  Mother's counsel did\r\n  not interpose an objection. Â Father's counsel then followed up Mr.\r\n  Padgett's questioning to Ms. Emery with the following: &quot;Does it appear to\r\n  be behavior that goes beyond insane jealousy?&quot;Â  In response, Mother's\r\n  counsel objected that Ms. Emery was not qualified to comment beyond her opinion\r\n  as to Mother's &quot;insane jealousy.&quot; Â Despite counsel's\r\n  objection, the family court permitted Ms. Emery to answer the question.Â  \r\nMs. Emery's\r\n  testimony was not required to be presented by an expert witness because her\r\n  statement was within the range of permissible lay testimony.Â  Pursuant to Rule\r\n  701, SCRE, lay witnesses are permitted to offer testimony in the form of\r\n  opinions or inferences if the opinions or inferences are rationally based on\r\n  the witness's perception, will aid the trier of fact in understanding\r\n  testimony, and do not require special knowledge, skill, experience, or training.Â \r\n  Ms. Emery's opinion regarding Mother's behavior was based on her personal\r\n  interaction with Mother as Daughter's guardian and was probative in determining\r\n  which parent was best suited to obtain custody of Daughter.Â  See State\r\n    v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499, 502-03, 671 S.E.2d 606, 608-09 (2009) (finding\r\n  that a witness did not need to be qualified as an expert in the field of\r\n  forensic interviewing when the witness testified only as to her personal\r\n  observations and as to her interview with the victim); cf. Honea v.\r\n    Prior, 295 S.C. 526, 531, 369 S.E.2d 846, 849 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding that\r\n  a social worker was qualified to give an opinion as to the defendant's mental\r\n  state despite not being a psychiatrist because she had adequate opportunities\r\n  to observe and interview the defendant).Â  Moreover, this Court is aware that\r\n  the family court was free to accept or reject Ms. Emery's opinion as to whether\r\n  Mother was &quot;insanely jealous&quot; based on its assessment of Ms. Emery's\r\n  and Mother's testimony at the final hearing.Â  Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C.\r\n  132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103 (2003) (stating that when reviewing a child\r\n  custody order, this Court is mindful that the family court observed the\r\n  witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility and assign\r\n  comparative weight to the testimony).Â  \r\nRegarding Mother's\r\n  argument that Father did not notify her of his intent to call Ms. Emery as an\r\n  expert witness, Father was not required to notify Mother in this regard because\r\n  Ms. Emery was not testifying as an expert witness.Â  But see Rule 33,\r\n  SCRCP (stating that a party may serve a written interrogatory upon another\r\n  party to request identification of any potential expert\r\n  witnesses whom the party proposes to use as a witness at trial); Baughman v.\r\n    Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991) (&quot;There is, however, a continuing duty to supplement\r\n  responses with new information concerning the identity of persons having\r\n  knowledge of discoverable matters and persons expected to be called as expert\r\n  witnesses.&quot;). Â Mother never objected to Ms. Emery's testimony on\r\n  this ground at the final hearing, thus it is not preserved for this Court's\r\n  review.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C. at 546, 602 S.E.2d at 732\r\n  (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to\r\n  preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court.â€).Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Father's statement\r\nMother next asserts\r\n  that the family court erred in permitting Father to testify as to whether\r\n  Father's personal observations were consistent with Dr. Saylor's testimony.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nFather's counsel\r\n  asked Father on direct examination, &quot;And how did [Dr. Saylor's]\r\n  impressions in that report relate to your impressions of Josie?&quot;Â  Mother's\r\n  counsel objected on the grounds that Father was not qualified as a forensic\r\n  psychologist to testify on the accuracy or validity of Dr. Saylor's\r\n  conclusions.Â  The family court then instructed Father that he could testify as\r\n  to his own impressions and feelings but not as to whether Dr. Saylor's report\r\n  was valid.Â  In turn, Father stated, &quot;[The report] was extremely\r\n  representative of what I have experienced and what I've had to â€“ what I've been\r\n  dealing with. . . .&quot;\r\nFather was in a position to testify as to whether his\r\n  personal observations and experiences with Mother were similar to the\r\n  conclusions in Dr. Saylor's report.Â  His response was based on first-hand\r\n  knowledge acquired during the parties' four-year tumultuous romance and\r\n  continued interaction following Daughter's birth.Â  See Rule 602, SCRE\r\n  (stating that a witness must have personal knowledge of a matter in order to\r\n  testify about it).Â  Father's statements were not of the nature that would require\r\n  specialized knowledge such that he would need to be qualified as an expert\r\n  before testifying because his opinion was rationally based on his perception of\r\n  Mother as a result of their relationship.Â  See Rule 701, SCRE (limiting\r\n  a lay witness's testimony to opinions or inferences that (1) are rationally based\r\n  on the witness's perception; (2) are helpful to a clear understanding of the\r\n  witness's testimony or the determination of a fact in issue; and (3) do not\r\n  require special knowledge, skill, experience, or training).Â  Consequently, the\r\n  family court did not err in permitting Father to respond to this line of\r\n  questioning.\r\nD.&nbsp; Aunt's Testimony\r\nMother argues the\r\n  family court erred in limiting the testimony of Mother's sister-in-law, Leslie\r\n  Caldwell (Aunt), at the final hearing because Aunt's statements were neither\r\n  speculative nor outside the realm of testimony agreed upon during discovery.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nDaughter's guardian\r\n  ad litem, Mr. Padgett, asked Aunt how Daughter would be affected if she was\r\n  placed in Father's custody and taken away from Daughter's half-sister.Â  In\r\n  response, Father's counsel objected, arguing that Aunt's response would be\r\n  speculative, and unless there was an expert witness to testify as to how\r\n  Daughter would feel or react, it was outside the scope of permissible lay\r\n  testimony.Â  The family court sustained Father's objection, finding that her\r\n  previous testimony did not indicate she had either the educational expertise or\r\n  interaction with the parties to be able to testify on that issue.Â  \r\nAunt's testimony\r\n  was properly excluded as she had no personal knowledge of how Daughter's\r\n  custody placement would affect Daughter.Â  Daughter never lived with Aunt, and\r\n  Aunt testified that she only saw Daughter three or four times a year for less\r\n  than a week at a time.Â  While Aunt clearly has a personal relationship with\r\n  Daughter, she lacks the daily interaction and first-hand knowledge that is\r\n  necessary to properly testify on how Daughter living with Father would affect\r\n  Daughter's relationship with her half-sister.Â  See Rule 701, SCRE.Â \r\n  Consequently, the family court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Aunt's\r\n  testimony on this issue.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Mother's counsel did not proffer Aunt's testimony after it was excluded.Â  We\r\n  have previously refused to address an issue on appeal when no proffer is made\r\n  after the family court excludes evidence.Â  See Zaragoza v. Zaragoza,\r\n  309 S.C. 149, 153, 420 S.E.2d 516, 518 (Ct. App. 1992) (an alleged erroneous\r\n  exclusion of evidence is not a basis for establishing prejudice on appeal in the\r\n  absence of an adequate proffer of evidence to the family court).Â  In any event,\r\n  the family court was presented with a plethora of testimony relating to how\r\n  custody placement would affect Daughter, such that the exclusion of this\r\n  testimony did not prejudice Mother. \r\nE.&nbsp; Grandmother's Testimony\r\nMother next contends that the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in limiting the scope of her mother's (Grandmother) testimony at the\r\n  final hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring Grandmother's testimony, Mother's counsel asked\r\n  Grandmother whether she &quot;had an occasion to see [Daughter] after she's\r\n  been on visitation with [Father] in this case.&quot;Â  Father's counsel\r\n  objected, stating that per Mother's discovery responses, Grandmother would only\r\n  be testifying to Mother's characteristics as a parent and her specific\r\n  observations of Father.Â  The family court sustained Father's objection.Â  \r\nIn response to\r\n  Mother's argument on appeal, Father claims the introduction of Grandmother's\r\n  observations regarding Daughter would create unfair surprise and prejudice.Â \r\n  While we do not believe the introduction of Grandmother's testimony on this\r\n  point would ultimately prejudice Father, Grandmother's testimony is admittedly\r\n  outside the scope of testimony presented in Mother's discovery responses.Â \r\n  Mother was free to supplement her discovery responses prior to the final\r\n  hearing to enlarge the scope of her witnesses' testimony, and her failure to do\r\n  so should not work to the detriment of Father.Â  Furthermore, the family court\r\n  permitted Grandmother to testify extensively about the parties' relationship\r\n  and her observations of Father and Mother, both individually and with\r\n  Daughter.Â Â  As a result, we do not view the family court's limitation on this\r\n  small portion of Grandmother's testimony as prejudicial error.\r\nF.&nbsp; Mother's testimony\r\nMother\r\n  lastly submits that the family court erred in limiting Mother's initial statement\r\n  concerning her wishes for Daughter's custody placement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the final hearing, Mother's counsel asked Mother, &quot;What is your desire for\r\n  this Court to order in regard to custody of [Daughter], primary custody of\r\n  [Daughter]?&quot;Â  In response, Mother stated, &quot;I pray that the Court\r\n  awards me primary custody of [Daughter].&quot;Â  Mother then proceeded to\r\n  explain why she was entitled to primary custody of Daughter.Â  Father's counsel\r\n  objected that her statements were not responsive to the question, and the\r\n  family court sustained the objection.Â  Mother briefly contends that the court's\r\n  ruling demonstrates bias and prejudice; however, Mother fails to explain how\r\n  she was prejudiced by the court's ruling.Â  See First Sav. Bank,\r\n  314 S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514 (noting that when a party fails to cite\r\n  authority or when the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is\r\n  deemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal).Â  Regardless, we perceive no\r\n  error or prejudice to Mother as the family court then immediately allowed\r\n  Mother, at her counsel's prompting, to explain in detail to the court why she\r\n  was seeking primary custody of Daughter.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Credibility Determinations\r\nMother\r\n  summarily argues that the family court completely disregarded the probative\r\n  value and credibility of Mother and her witnesses, which improperly influenced\r\n  the family court's custody determination.Â  We disagree.\r\nMother\r\n  cites no authority for this argument, merely stating at the outset that she\r\n  incorporates the arguments from all of the previous issues.Â  See First\r\n    Sav. Bank, 314 S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514 (noting that when a party\r\n  fails to cite authority or when the argument is simply a conclusory statement,\r\n  the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal).Â  Regardless, the\r\n  family court's assessment of witness credibility and the weight it apportioned\r\n  to certain witness's testimony was proper.Â  The family court specifically\r\n  stated in its final order, &quot;Certain witnesses were found by the Court to be\r\n  credible and compelling, while other witnesses were found by the Court not to\r\n  be so.&quot;Â  Although Mother claims that the family court completely\r\n  disregarded the credibility of Mother and all of her witnesses, the only\r\n  witness the family court explicitly found to be less credible was Mother.Â \r\n  Based on Mother's conflicting testimony, which was highlighted in the family\r\n  court's final order, the family court was well within its delegated authority\r\n  to assign less weight to Mother's testimony in making its decision.Â  See Ball v. Ball, 312 S.C. 31, 35-36, 430 S.E.2d 533, 536 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (stating that the family court has the advantage of hearing all the testimony\r\n  presented and thus is able to best weigh the testimony in making its decision).Â  Thus, we find no abuse\r\n  in the family court's exercise of discretion in resolving these credibility\r\n  issues at the final hearing.\r\nVII.&nbsp; Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\r\nMother claims her trial counsel's ineffective representation\r\n  prevented her from having a meaningful final hearing in violation of her due\r\n  process rights.[4]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nMother attempts to improperly transform her dissatisfaction with\r\n  her trial counsel's presentation of her case before the family court into a\r\n  claim of legal error on the part of the family court.Â Â  Any dissatisfaction she\r\n  has with her trial counsel is not the proper subject of review on appeal from\r\n  the family court's custody decision.Â  See generally Lanier v. Lanier,\r\n  364 S.C. 211, 215, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding that the\r\n  appellant has the burden to convince this Court that the family court\r\n    committed legal error on appeal in a child custody case)&nbsp; (emphasis added). \r\nFurthermore, Mother's speculative claim that &quot;adequate\r\n  preparation of her case for trial may have avoided trial . . . [and] most\r\n  probably have brought about a different result&quot; is insufficient to\r\n  establish that she was deprived of a meaningful hearing in violation of her due\r\n  process rights, particularly when she never raised this issue to the family\r\n  court.Â  See Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 356, 461\r\n  S.E.2d 388, 392 (1995) (finding appellant's argument that hearing below was\r\n  conducted in such a way as to deprive him of his constitutional due process\r\n  rights was never mentioned prior to his appeal and consequently was not\r\n  preserved for review).Â  In addition to Mother's failure to raise this issue\r\n  below or to cite any authority to support her claim that the family court\r\n  violated her due process rights, we note that the family court went to great\r\n  lengths to provide Mother with an opportunity to adequately prepare her case as\r\n  demonstrated by the court's willingness to grant Mother's multiple requests for\r\n  continuances.Â  Additionally, we find that the family court clearly afforded\r\n  Mother and Father a meaningful, thorough, and fair hearing, as evidenced by the\r\n  seven-day final hearing and ensuing thirty-two page final order.Â Â  Therefore,\r\n  Mother's argument on this issue is without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Throughout this litigation,\r\n  Father has been the president of the Divine Dining Group, a corporation with\r\n  numerous restaurants and other food and beverage establishments in the Myrtle\r\n  Beach area. Â Mother is a college graduate.Â  For the majority of the parties'\r\n  relationship, Mother managed one of Father's liquor stores, in which Mother\r\n  contends she has partial ownership. Â At the time of the final hearing, she was\r\n  seeking employment and planning to attend real estate school. \r\n[2] On July 2, 2005, less than three months prior to the\r\n  final hearing, Mother filed a motion seeking removal of Ms. Emery as guardian\r\n  ad litem, alleging a conflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety.Â \r\n  The family court found that Mother failed to substantiate either of these\r\n  claims, but to ensure that the final hearing focused on the best interests of\r\n  Daughter and not on any perceived conflict of interest, the family court\r\n  substituted Carroll Padgett as guardian for Daughter.Â  \r\n[3] According to Dr. Saylor's report, an individual\r\n  diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder may exhibit the following: (1)\r\n  a grandiose sense of self-importance; (2) a requirement of excessive\r\n  admiration; (3) a sense of entitlement, i.e., an unreasonable expectation of\r\n  especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with expectations; (4) an\r\n  interpersonal exploitativeness, i.e., a willingness to take advantage of others\r\n  to achieve the individual's Â needs; (5) a lack of empathy; (6) an envy towards others\r\n  or a belief that others envy the individual; and (7) arrogant and haughty\r\n  behaviors or attitudes.Â  \r\n[4] In Mother's reply brief, she asserts for the first\r\n  time that the family court also deprived Daughter of her due process rights.Â  The\r\n  reply brief is not the appropriate vehicle to raise new issues on appeal; thus,\r\n  we decline to address this argument.Â  Bochette\r\n    v. Bochette, 300\r\n  S.C. 109, 112, 386 S.E.2d 475, 477 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1989) (&quot;An appellant\r\n  may not use either oral argument or the reply brief as a vehicle to argue\r\n  issues not argued in the appellant's brief.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4601","title":"Singh v.

Â Pursuant to section\r\n  8-44(c) of the Greenville Code of Ordinances,[4] Singh appealed that decision to\r\n  the city council.Â  In the meantime, Singh also unsuccessfully sought a\r\n  temporary injunction in an effort to continue his business operations during\r\n  the pendency of his appeal.Â  \r\nOn appeal to the city council, the city manager's\r\n  decision to revoke Singh's business license was modified, allowing Singh to provisionally\r\n  re-open his business for sixty days under a &quot;Conditional Business License.&quot;Â  The city council expressly allowed\r\n  the city manager to establish the conditions[5] with which Singh had to comply, and stated that any deviation from the\r\n  conditions would result in the automatic revocation of Singh's conditional\r\n  license. Â The council further stated that after the\r\n  sixty-day period, the Travel Inn would be placed on a &quot;six-month Probation\r\n  Period,&quot; as long as the city manager certified the business had been in\r\n  complete compliance with the conditions during the sixty days.Â  The city council\r\n  gave the city manager full discretion to determine whether the conditions were\r\n  in fact violated, with the police department to report any violations directly\r\n  to the city manager.Â  \r\nUpon expiration of the sixty-day period, the chief of\r\n  the Greenville Police Department submitted an evaluation concerning the Travel\r\n  Inn's compliance with the conditions set forth in the agreement.Â  The evaluation\r\n  stated the Department's vice and narcotics squads checked the Travel Inn and its\r\n  premises on a daily basis, and ultimately found Singh had met the conditions\r\n  outlined in the agreement.Â  \r\nFollowing the chief of police's report, the city\r\n  manager extended the probationary period for one year under the existing terms\r\n  and conditions.Â  Approximately one month later, the city manager wrote to Singh\r\n  informing him the Travel Inn's business license would be revoked based upon\r\n  Singh's &quot;inability or unwillingness to maintain a safe, drug-free, and\r\n  crime-free environment.&quot;Â  The letter referenced four incidents which the manager\r\n  determined constituted a continued nuisance, thereby necessitating revocation.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Singh requested an appeal to the city council pursuant to section\r\n  8-44(c).Â  The City denied Singh's request for a hearing, believing Singh's\r\n  previous hearing constituted his appeal for this matter under section 8-44(c).Â \r\n  Singh again sought a temporary injunction to allow him to continue to operate\r\n  his business.Â  Upon denial of this request, Singh appealed the revocation of\r\n  his business license to the circuit court pursuant to Rule 74, SCRCP.[6]Â  \r\nOn appeal, Singh argued the revocation of his business\r\n  license and the City's subsequent decision to deny a rehearing of his appeal,\r\n  violated his right to procedural due process and thus was arbitrary.Â  Singh\r\n  further argued the City's abdication of its monitoring responsibilities, in ceding\r\n  complete discretion to the city manager, created a means of evading meaningful\r\n  appellate review.Â  \r\nThe City again maintained that the entire process\r\n  should not be viewed as anything other than one complete revocation process, and,\r\n  therefore, Singh had already received a hearing before the city council in\r\n  compliance with Rule 74 and attendant procedural due process.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the City argued the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal\r\n  by virtue of an additional suit pending before it. \r\nThe circuit court found the city council was under no\r\n  obligation to grant Singh a provisional license, but upon doing so, the\r\n  provisional license acted as a new business license with its own set of unique\r\n  conditions.Â  Consequently, the circuit court reversed the city council's\r\n  revocation of Singh's business license, finding that due process entitled Singh\r\n  to a second hearing regarding the revocation of his conditional license.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the\r\n  discretionary decision of a legislative body, our courts have been hesitant to\r\n  substitute their judgment for that of elected representatives.Â  McSherry v.\r\n    Spartanburg County Council, 371 S.C. 586, 590, 641 S.E.2d 431, 434 (2007).Â \r\n  &quot;When the city council of a municipality has acted after\r\n  considering all of the facts, this court should not disturb the finding unless\r\n  such action is arbitrary, unreasonable, or an obvious abuse of its discretion.&quot;Â  Gay v. City of Beaufort, 364 S.C. 252, 254, 612 S.E.2d 467,\r\n  468&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in finding the one year provisional business\r\n  license acted as a new license thereby entitling Singh to a second set of business\r\n  license revocation hearings.Â  We agree.\r\nAt the initial hearing, the city\r\n  manager revoked Singh's business license under section 8-43(b) finding the\r\n  Travel Inn constituted a public nuisance.Â  On appeal, city council voted to\r\n  hold the revocation in abeyance provided Singh complied with the conditions as\r\n  set forth by the city council. Â Following the initial 60-day\r\n  probationary period, the city manager reviewed the police department's\r\n  recommendation and ultimately extended Singh's conditional license by an\r\n  additional year. Â In so extending, the city manager retained sole discretion to\r\n  revoke Singh's license immediately for non-compliance.&nbsp; Within one month\r\n  of extending Singh's conditional license, the Travel Inn accumulated four\r\n  additional incident reports. Â As a result, the city manager reinstated the\r\n  revocation of Singh's license.Â  \r\nThese facts clearly demonstrate the one\r\n  year extension of the provisional license did not act as a new business license;\r\n  instead, it was merely a continuation of the previous revocation process.Â  The\r\n  four incidents that occurred within the month after the extension of the\r\n  conditional license cannot, and should not, be viewed in isolation from the 918\r\n  other calls for service on which the license was initially revoked.Â \r\n  Consequently, it was error for the circuit court to find the conditional\r\n  business license issued by the city council acted as a new license.\r\nBased on our decision that the\r\n  revocation was one continuous process, Singh's concerns about the violation of\r\n  his due process rights are misplaced.Â  Singh still had the right to appeal the\r\n  revocation to circuit court for a determination of whether or not the decision\r\n  was arbitrary, unreasonable, or an obvious abuse of discretion.Â  That review\r\n  did not take place because the circuit court erroneously viewed the ultimate\r\n  revocation as a new proceeding.Â  Â \r\nTherefore, on remand, the circuit court should\r\n  review the initial complaints against Singh, in addition to the four subsequent\r\n  complaints, in order to determine whether the city's decision to revoke Singh's\r\n  license was arbitrary, unreasonable, or an obvious abuse of discretion.Â  In\r\n  reaching its decision, the court may also consider the actions of city council\r\n  in relinquishing complete discretion to the city manager to determine issues of\r\n  compliance, and the ability to extend the period for the conditional business\r\n  license.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.[7]\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 8-43(b)\r\n  of the City of Greenville Code of Ordinances gives the City the power to revoke\r\n  a business license where the licensee's business amounts to a public nuisance.\r\n[2] Section 8-44(b)\r\n  provides in relevant part:Â  &quot;The applicant or licensee may, within five\r\n  working days from the date of the notice, request a hearing to contest the\r\n  grounds or request an extension of time to close the business.Â  The hearing\r\n  shall be held within 15 days unless additional time is allowed by the city\r\n  manager.&quot; \r\n[3] A call for\r\n  service is defined as a call or occurrence requiring an on-the-scene Police\r\n  response.\r\n[4] Section 8-44(c)\r\n  of the Greenville Code of Ordinances provides in relevant part:Â  &quot;An\r\n  appeal, which shall not stay the revocation, may be taken upon the written record\r\n  to the city council.Â  Notice of such appeal shall be served upon the city clerk\r\n  within five days from the final action by the city manager, specifying the\r\n  grounds for appeal and the action requested. . . .&quot;Â  \r\n[5] The conditions included:Â  (1)\r\n  Maintain a log of persons placed on trespass notice, which Police will be able\r\n  to inspect at anytime without notice and refuse to rent rooms to any person on\r\n  this list; (2) require presentation of identification and motor vehicle tag\r\n  number from all patrons upon registering for lodging; (3) require a $100.00\r\n  security deposit for patrons residing at Travel Inn for more than one week\r\n  continuously; (4) prohibit hourly room rates; (5) maintain security cameras and\r\n  record all activity for retrieval, as well as monitoring cameras twenty-four\r\n  hours per day and allowing Police to monitor the cameras at anytime without\r\n  prior notice; (6) provide written documentation that security personnel used by\r\n  Travel Inn are licensed and bonded by the State of South Carolina and that\r\n  security personnel must be on duty twenty-four hours per day, seven days per\r\n  week, monitoring all parking lots and the sidewalk in front of Travel Inn to\r\n  reduce prostitution; (7) submit names and addresses of security personnel and\r\n  Travel Inn employees to the Police, and the employees must not have criminal\r\n  convictions; (8) Police will be able to inspect all rooms before reopening\r\n  November 20, 2006; (9) property owner and manager are responsible for\r\n  maintaining the grounds and complying with the property maintenance code; (10)\r\n  enforce all conditions in the Travel Inn policy submitted to the City of\r\n  Greenville.Â  \r\n[6] Rule 74, SCRCP\r\n  provides in relevant part:Â  \r\n\r\n\tExcept for the time for filing the\r\n  notice of appeal, the procedure on appeal to the circuit court from the judgment\r\n  of an inferior court or decision of an administrative agency or tribunal shall\r\n  be in accordance with the statutes providing such appeals.Â  Notice of appeal to\r\n  the circuit court must be served on all parties thirty days after receipt of\r\n  written notice of the judgment, order or decision appealed from.\r\n\r\n[7] The city also argues the circuit court\r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear this matter by virtue of Singh\r\n  filing two appeals.Â  Subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction is defined as &quot;the power of a court to hear and determine\r\n  cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.&quot;Â  Dove\r\n    v.

Segars-Andrews issued a\r\n  temporary order granting Mother overnight visitation with the children every\r\n  Wednesday night and on alternating weekends.Â  In addition, Mother's child support\r\n  payments were reduced from $1,000 to $500 per month.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  October of 2001, Father commenced a romantic relationship with Jennifer Helm.Â \r\n  As the relationship progressed, Jennifer began spending more and more time at\r\n  Father's home with the children present.Â  On some occasions, Father\r\n  acknowledged Jennifer stayed past the children's bedtime.Â  According to the\r\n  testimony of Mother and the Guardian ad Litem (&quot;Guardian&quot;), the\r\n  parties' oldest child did not like Jennifer and felt uncomfortable with her in\r\n  the house.Â  By contrast, Father testified that his children loved Jennifer.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  parties' lives remained virtually unchanged until August 6, 2002 when Father, pursuant\r\n  to the parties' prior understanding, picked up the children from Mother's house\r\n  at 9:00 A.M. to take their oldest child to register for school.Â  By the time\r\n  Father arrived at Mother's residence, she had already departed for work, and\r\n  the children, ages twelve and five, were alone.Â  However, the children were\r\n  provided with a list of names and telephone numbers of nearby neighbors they\r\n  could contact in case of an emergency.Â  After arriving at Mother's house,\r\n  Father immediately called Mother and informed her he was keeping the children\r\n  for the remainder of the day.Â  Father also attempted to contact the Guardian,\r\n  who was unable to take his phone call at the time.Â  Thereafter, Father visited\r\n  his attorney's office and instructed him to prepare a motion for an ex parte\r\n  order.Â  In his motion, he alleged &quot;the children were to be left alone all day\r\n  while [Mother] was at work.&quot;[5]Â \r\n  On that same day, Judge Segars-Andrews issued an emergency ex parte order\r\n  preventing the children from being left home alone.Â  \r\nA\r\n  mere five days before the parties' September 10, 2002 trial date, Father, on\r\n  his own initiative and without prior notice or approval, took the children to\r\n  the office of Dr. Barton Saylor, a forensic psychologist, to be assessed and\r\n  interviewed.Â  From his interview with the children, Dr. Saylor concluded that\r\n  the children were well-adjusted and did not display any significant emotional\r\n  problems.Â  At trial, Dr. Saylor made it clear that he did not conduct a custody\r\n  evaluation or make a comparison of the parents.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, the Guardian submitted her written report to both parties.Â  The\r\n  Guardian's written report was the culmination of a five-month investigation of\r\n  the family, consisting of numerous interviews, observations, and in-home\r\n  visits.[6]Â \r\n  The Guardian did not submit a recommendation regarding custody of the children\r\n  in her report.Â  Instead, the Guardian, through her attorney, informed the court\r\n  she wished to reserve the right to make a custody recommendation at the\r\n  conclusion of the testimony.Â  At that time, the Guardian orally recommended\r\n  that primary custody of the children be awarded to Mother.Â  The Guardian based\r\n  her recommendation on numerous factors including:Â  the oldest child's stated\r\n  preference to live with Mother; Father's refusal to allow Mother to share in\r\n  parental decision-making; Father's testimony that Mother should not have more\r\n  time with the children beyond the existing visitation schedule; the children's\r\n  disposition while in the care of both parties; and her concerns about the\r\n  impact Father's relationship with Jennifer had on the children.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the end of trial, the family court issued an order modifying custody and child\r\n  support.Â  The court's order awarded the parties joint physical custody,\r\n  designated Mother as the primary physical custodian, and granted her final\r\n  decision-making authority.Â  In addressing the child support issue, the family\r\n  court declined to impute income to Mother, finding she was not voluntarily\r\n  underemployed due to her leaving a high-paying job in Nashville to return to\r\n  Charleston.Â  Next, the court determined the amount of money Father withdrew\r\n  from his law firm in 2001 represented only 80% of his total income for that\r\n  year as reported in his income tax return.[7]Â \r\n  Therefore, when Father alleged he withdrew $6,000 per month in 2002, the family\r\n  court, operating under the assumption that this amount represented only 80% of\r\n  his gross income, concluded Father's income for 2002 equaled $7,500 per month\r\n  (80% of $7,500 = $6,000).Â  Then, the family court determined Father improperly\r\n  included $1,474.47 of items as expenses that should have been reported as part\r\n  of his gross monthly income in his financial declaration.Â  As a result, the\r\n  family court concluded Father earned $8,974.47 per month for child support\r\n  purposes and required him to pay $804 per month in child-support to Mother.Â \r\n  Lastly, the family court ordered Father to pay Mother $43,675 in attorney's\r\n  fees and costs in light of the vigorous defense asserted by him and the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by Mother.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  both parties filed motions to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Before the court\r\n  could rule on the motions, Father also filed a motion for relief from judgment\r\n  based on newly discovered evidence.Â  The family court denied both parties'\r\n  motions to alter or amend the judgment on February 28, 2002.Â  Father filed a\r\n  notice of appeal on March 13, while Mother filed a notice of appeal on March\r\n  27.Â  On April 7, the family court denied Father's motion for relief from\r\n  judgment based on newly discovered evidence.Â  Subsequently, Father filed a\r\n  second notice of appeal on April 11.Â  On May 8, Court of Appeals Judge Cureton\r\n  issued an order consolidating Father's two appeals.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  trial, this case encountered many delays during its almost seven year journey\r\n  to our docket.Â  Immediately following the family court's order, Father sought a\r\n  determination from the United States Bankruptcy Court as to whether the family\r\n  court's award of attorney's fees should be designated as a priority debt.Â  This\r\n  case was stayed until 2005 during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings.Â \r\n  From there, the parties and their counsel managed to delay resolution of this\r\n  case even further by filing more than twenty-five motions with this court. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  an appeal from the family court, this court may correct errors of law and find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Semken\r\n    v. Semken, 379 S.C. 71, 75, 664 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We are\r\n  not, however, required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376\r\n  S.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2008).Â  In particular, an appellate court\r\n  should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the family\r\n  court.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â Â Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  TIMELINESS OF MOTHER'S\r\n  APPEAL\r\nFather argues Mother did not timely file her motion to\r\n  alter or amend the final order pursuant to Rules 52 and 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Assuming\r\n  the motion was timely filed, Father contends Mother failed to timely file a\r\n  notice of appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nFather's\r\n  arguments are wholly without merit and warrant little discussion.Â  First,\r\n  Mother timely made her Rule 59(e) motion by serving Father ten days after\r\n  receiving notice of the judgment.Â  See Rule 59(e), SCRCP (&quot;A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the\r\n  entry of the order.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  Second, because Mother timely made a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), the\r\n  time to serve her notice of appeal did not run until she received written\r\n  notice of the order granting or denying that motion.Â  See Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR (noting if a party makes a\r\n  timely Rule 59 motion, the time for appeal is stayed and does not begin to run\r\n  until the receipt of written notice of the order granting or denying such\r\n  motion).Â  Therefore, Mother had thirty days to file a notice of appeal after\r\n  receiving written notice of the order\r\n  denying her Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Id.Â  Because she served her notice of\r\n  appeal within the thirty day time period, her notice of appeal was timely.Â  \r\nII.Â  CUSTODY\r\nA.&nbsp; Final\r\n  Decision-Making Authority\r\nFather\r\n  asserts the family court erred in awarding final decision-making authority to\r\n  Mother.Â  According to Father, the family court misconstrued the previous order\r\n  as silent on the issue of final decision-making authority.Â  Father claims the\r\n  previous order implicitly granted him final decision-making authority when it\r\n  granted him primary custody.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUnless\r\n  otherwise stated by agreement of the parties or order of the family court, the\r\n  power to make final decisions for children is necessarily vested in the custodial\r\n  parent.Â  Thus, Father correctly points out that the previous order implicitly\r\n  granted him final decision-making authority by virtue of granting him primary\r\n  legal custody.Â  Accordingly, the family court misconstrued the previous order\r\n  when it stated that it was silent as to final decision-making authority.Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  the family court awarded Mother primary legal custody based on a finding of a\r\n  substantial change in circumstances.Â  Therefore, the fact that the family court\r\n  misconstrued the previous order makes no difference on appeal because the\r\n  change in primaryÂ  legalÂ  custody,Â  andÂ  withÂ  itÂ  theÂ  grantÂ  ofÂ  finalÂ \r\n  decision-making authority, wasÂ  predicatedÂ  onÂ  a finding of a substantial change\r\n  in circumstances, not on an interpretation of the previous order.Â  See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;[W]hatever\r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court did not err in awarding final decision-making authority to Mother.Â  Â Â \r\nB.&nbsp; Primary\r\n  Legal Custody\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding primary legal custody of the children\r\n  to Mother, asserting the family court failed to consider or improperly considered\r\n  a number of factors in the best interests of the child analysis.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Father contends the court erred by:Â  determining he excluded Mother from the\r\n  decision-making process when he held final decision-making authority; failing\r\n  to take into account Mother left the children alone at home; relying on the report\r\n  and recommendation of the Guardian; and considering the preference of the\r\n  oldest child.[8]Â \r\n  Lastly, Father alleges his decision-making for the children was proper, and\r\n  they were doing very well in his care.Â  We disagree.Â Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  paramount and controlling consideration in a custody dispute is the best\r\n  interests of the child.Â  Cole v. Cole, 274 S.C. 449, 453, 265 S.E.2d 669,\r\n  671 (1980).Â  The family court must consider the character, fitness, attitude,\r\n  and inclinations on the part of each parent as they affect the child.Â  Hollar\r\n    v. Hollar, 342 S.C. 463, 472-73, 536 S.E.2d 883, 888 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  Psychological, physical, environmental, spiritual, educational, medical,\r\n  family, emotional, and recreational aspects of the child's life should also be\r\n  considered.Â  Wheeler v. Gill, 307 S.C. 94, 99, 413 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App.\r\n  1992).Â  In sum, the totality of circumstances unique to each particular case\r\n  constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.Â  Paparella\r\n    v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 189, 531 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nIn\r\n  order for a court to grant a change in custody, the moving party must\r\n  demonstrate changed circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the\r\n  order in question.Â  Kisling v. Allison, 343 S.C. 674, 679, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  273, 275 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  A change in circumstances justifying a change in the\r\n  custody of a child simply means that sufficient facts have been shown to\r\n  warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the children would be served\r\n  by the change.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427,\r\n  430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;The change of circumstances relied on for a change\r\n  of custody must be such as would substantially affect the interest and welfare\r\n  of the child.&quot;Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 381, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  32, 35 (2004).\r\nThe family court\r\n  awarded primary legal custody of the children to Mother based on a finding of a\r\n  substantial change in circumstances.Â  In making this finding, the family court\r\n  determined the best interests of the children would be served by awarding\r\n  primary legal custody to Mother.Â  For the reasons set forth below, we believe the\r\n  family court properly considered the best interests of the children in awarding\r\n  primary legal custody to Mother.Â  \r\nInitially, even\r\n  though the previous order granted Father final decision-making authority, this\r\n  power did not excuse him from the responsibility of co-parenting with Mother.Â \r\n  Therefore, this was a relevant inquiry in the court's analysis.Â  Contrary to\r\n  Father's assertions, the family court recounted the episode where the children\r\n  were left alone while in Mother's care in great detail.Â  We decline to assign additional\r\n  weight to this incident on appeal as the record merely indicates the children\r\n  were left alone for a short period of time while they waited for their Father\r\n  to pick them up.Â  Next, the family court properly considered the oldest child's\r\n  stated preference to live with Mother in performing the best interests\r\n  analysis.Â  See Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 93, 606 S.E.2d 785,\r\n  789 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;In determining the best interests of the child, the\r\n  court must consider the child's reasonable preference for custody.&quot;).Â  At\r\n  the time of trial, the parties' oldest child was nearly thirteen years-old and\r\n  by all accounts very mature for her age.Â  Accordingly, the family court\r\n  properly attached significance to her wishes in awarding custody to Mother.Â  See Smith v. Smith, 261 S.C. 81, 85, 198 S.E.2d 271, 274 (1973) (&quot;The\r\n  significance to be attached to the wishes of the child in a custody dispute\r\n  depends upon the age of the child and the attendant circumstances.&quot;).Â  \r\nLastly, Father alleges his decision-making for the\r\n  children was proper, and they were doing very well in his care.Â  However, the\r\n  record reveals Father made many decisions to advance his own interests without\r\n  regard to how they affected the children.Â  For example, Father continually\r\n  allowed his girlfriend, Jennifer, to come to his home while the children were\r\n  there even though this disturbed the oldest child. Â In addition, he allowed\r\n  Jennifer to stay at his house past the children's bedtime.Â  Thus, while the\r\n  children were doing well in school and healthy while in Father's care, we find\r\n  that the family court properly considered their best interests in awarding\r\n  primary legal custody to Mother.Â  Â \r\nC.&nbsp; Physical Custody\r\nOn\r\n  cross-appeal, Mother argues the family court erred in awarding both parties\r\n  joint physical custody of the children without making a finding of\r\n  extraordinary circumstances.Â  Mother contends it would be in the best interests\r\n  of the children for sole physical custody to be awarded to her.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family\r\n  court, although awarding both parties joint physical custody, failed to make a\r\n  finding of exceptional circumstances to support its decision.Â  See Patel v. Patel,\r\n  359 S.C. 515, 528, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004) (noting joint custody should only\r\n  be ordered under exceptional circumstances); Courie v. Courie, 288 S.C. 163,\r\n    168, 341 S.E.2d 646, 649 (Ct. App. 1986) (&quot;Divided custody is avoided if at all possible, and will be approved only\r\n  under exceptional circumstances.&quot;).Â  Absent exceptional circumstances, the\r\n  law regards joint custody as typically harmful to the children and not in their\r\n  best interests.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 125, 579 S.E.2d 620, 624\r\n  (2003).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe the exceptional nature of this case demands that we affirm the family\r\n  court's award of joint physical custody.Â  In this case, a seven year delay\r\n  occurred between the issuance of the family court's final order, dated December\r\n  19, 2002, and oral argument before this panel on March 5, 2009.Â  The reasons\r\n  for the delay in this case range from the acceptableâ€”Father's bankruptcy\r\n  proceedingâ€”to the unacceptableâ€”the rash of motions filed by both parties.Â  Since\r\n  the family court's final order, the children have grown from the ages of five\r\n  and twelve to the ages of twelve and nineteen.Â  Undoubtedly, many things have\r\n  changed in the children's lives since 2002.Â  However, the custodial arrangement\r\n  has remained constant.Â  At this point, we are reluctant to order a change in the\r\n  custody arrangement based on a record which most certainly has become cold.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we affirm the family court's decision to award both parties joint physical\r\n  custody of the children. Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIII.Â  SUPPORT \r\nA.&nbsp; Imputing\r\n  Income to Mother\r\nFather\r\n  argues Mother voluntarily left a job earning $74,000 in Nashville for a\r\n  low-paying job in Charleston.Â  As a result, Father contends the family court\r\n  erred in refusing to impute income to Mother.Â  If the court refuses to impute\r\n  income to Mother based on a finding of voluntary underemployment, Father\r\n  alleges Mother's income should be increased to reflect the raise she received\r\n  from her employer, RoHoHo, Inc.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;If\r\n  the court finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, it\r\n  should calculate child support based on a determination of potential income\r\n  which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5) (Supp. 2008).Â  A parent seeking to impute income to\r\n  the other parent need not establish a bad faith motivation to prove\r\n  underemployment.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13, 636 S.E.2d 864, 866\r\n  (2006).Â Â  However, the motivation behind any purported reduction in income or\r\n  earning capacity should be considered in determining whether a parent is\r\n  voluntarily underemployed.Â  Id.Â  &quot;[T]he common thread in cases\r\n  where actual income versus earning capacity is at issue is that courts are to closely\r\n  examine the payor's good-faith and reasonable explanation for the decreased\r\n  income.&quot;Â Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481,\r\n  489, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nA trial\r\n  court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding based on newly discovered evidence\r\n  which by due diligence could not have been discovered in\r\n  time to move for a new trial under\r\n  Rule 59(b).Â  Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  The motion must be\r\n  made within a reasonable time and not more than one year after the judgment was\r\n  entered.Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  To obtain relief based on newly discovered\r\n  evidence, a movant must establish that the newly discovered evidence:Â  (1) is\r\n  of such magnitude that had the court known of it earlier, the outcome would\r\n  likely have been different; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could\r\n  not have been discovered before the trial; (4) is material to the issue; and\r\n  (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C.\r\n  211, 217, 612 S.E.2d 456, 459&nbsp; (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe trial court did\r\n  not err in refusing to impute income to Mother.Â  The overwhelming evidence\r\n  reveals the motivating factor prompting Mother's resignation from her job in\r\n  Nashville was the wishes of the parties' oldest child.Â  See Kelley, 324 S.C. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n    731 (noting courts should consider the parties' good-faith and reasonable\r\n  explanation for the decreased income in determining whether to impute income to\r\n  the party).Â  Immediately prior to summer\r\n  visitation with Mother, the children endured a traumatic episode when Father's\r\n  third wife, Daphne Burns, permanently moved out of Father's residence.Â \r\n  Thereafter, upon arriving in Nashville, the parties' oldest child begged Mother\r\n  to return to Charleston, and Mother did so.Â  Once she returned to Charleston,\r\n  Mother found her employment opportunities in the field of health-care finance remained\r\n  non-existent in the Charleston area.Â  Because of this, Mother earns\r\n  significantly less in Charleston than she earned in Nashville.Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  before arriving in Charleston and up to the time of trial, Mother searched and\r\n  continued searching for a financial\r\n  management position in the area by soliciting the service of head-hunting\r\n  agencies, sending out numerous job applications, looking through employment\r\n  advertisements in the newspaper, and networking with friends.Â  Based on these\r\n  facts, we conclude that Mother was not voluntarily underemployed.Â  Consequently, we do not believe the family court erred\r\n  in refusing to impute income to Mother.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  addition, we do not believe the family court erred in denying Father's motion\r\n  to increase Mother's income from $26,000 to $31,200 based on newly discovered\r\n  evidence.Â  We believe Father could have, through the exercise of due diligence,\r\n  discovered Mother's raise in time to move for relief pursuant to Rule 59.Â  See Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP (stating a party cannot obtain relief from a final\r\n  judgment based on newly discovered evidence if the evidence could have been\r\n  discovered through the exercise of due diligence in time to move for a new\r\n  trial under Rule 59(b)); Lanier, 364 S.C. at 220, 612 S.E.2d at 460\r\n  (defining due diligence as &quot;the diligence reasonably expected from, and\r\n  ordinarily exercised by, a person who seeks to satisfy a legal requirement or\r\n  to discharge an obligation.&quot;).Â  In this case, the trial ended on September\r\n  22, 2002.Â  In November 2002, Mother received a raise from her employer.Â  On December\r\n  19, 2002, the family court issued its amended final order.Â  Thus, the evidence\r\n  of Mother's raise was in existence during the time period in which Father could\r\n  have sought relief pursuant to Rule 59.Â  See Rule 59(b), SCRCP (noting\r\n  in non-jury actions, a party has ten days after the receipt of written notice\r\n  of the entry of judgment to serve a motion for a new trial).Â  On appeal, Father\r\n  fails to offer any reason why Mother's raise could not have been discovered\r\n  during this time.Â  In fact, on January 17, 2003, Father ultimately discovered\r\n  Mother's raise by subpoena of loan documents prepared by Mother in November\r\n  2002.Â  Therefore, the family court properly denied Father's motion for relief\r\n  from judgment based on newly discovered evidence.[9]Â  See State v. Mercer, 381 S.C. 149, 166, 672 S.E.2d 556, 565\r\n  (2009) (noting our jurisprudence recognizes the gatekeeping role of the trial\r\n  court in determining the credibility of post-trial motions); State v. Pierce,\r\n  263 S.C. 23, 33, 207 S.E.2d 414, 419 (1974) (&quot;The credibility of newly-discovered evidence offered in support of a motion for new trial is a matter for determination by the circuit judge\r\n  to whom it is offered.&quot;).\r\nB.&nbsp; Imputing\r\n  Income to Father \r\nThe\r\n  family court concluded Father earned $7,500 per month in gross income,\r\n  exclusive of additions for in-kind benefits received by Father.Â  Father asserts\r\n  the family court committed several errors in arriving at this figure.Â  First, because\r\n  his income varies from month to month, Father alleges the family court erred by\r\n  using his highest-ever eight month income, the $6,000 a month he withdrew from\r\n  his law practice in 2002, as a base-line figure for its child support\r\n  calculations.Â  Instead, Father asserts his income should have been averaged\r\n  over a longer period of time.Â  Additionally, Father claims the family court\r\n  erred in determining the $6,000 per month\r\n  he withdrew from his law firm in 2002 represented only 80% of his gross income\r\n  for that year.Â  According to Father, this error caused the family court to\r\n  conclude his gross income equaled $7,500 per month (80% of $7,500 = $6,000).Â  Â Â \r\n&quot;Child\r\n  support awards are within the sound discretion of the trial judge and, absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.&quot; Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87,\r\n    92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984). Â An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the court's decision is controlled by some\r\n  error of law or where the order, based upon\r\n  the findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.Â  Kelley, 324 S.C. at 485, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n    729.Â  Ordinarily, the family court\r\n  determines income based upon the financial declarations submitted by the\r\n  parties.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  114-4720(A)(6) (Supp. 2008).Â Â  However,\r\n  where the amounts reflected on the financial declaration are at issue, the\r\n  court may rely on suitable documentation to verify income, such as pay stubs,\r\n  receipts, or expenses covering at least one month.Â  Id.Â  The Child\r\n  Support Guidelines specifically address how to determine income\r\n  from someone who is self-employed:\r\n\r\n\tFor income from self-employment . . . gross\r\n  income is defined as gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary\r\n  expenses required for self-employment or business operation . . . .Â  However, the court\r\n  should exclude from those expenses amounts allowed by the Internal Revenue\r\n  Service for accelerated depreciation of investment tax credits for purposes of\r\n  the guidelines and add those amounts back in to determine gross income.Â  In general, the court should carefully\r\n  review income and expenses from self-employment\r\n  . . . to determine actual levels of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child support obligation. Â As may be apparent, this amount may\r\n  differ from the determination of business income for tax\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  114-4720(A)(4) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  evidence submitted at trial, the family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  determining Father's gross income.Â  The evidence presented at trial and Father's own\r\n  testimony revealed his 2001 financial declaration did not accurately reflect\r\n  his gross income for that year.Â  In his 2001 financial declaration, Father\r\n  reported withdrawing an average of $3,600 per month from his law firm from\r\n  January 1 through October 31.Â  While this amount was accurate for the ten-month\r\n  period, Father withdrew $17,000 from his law firm during the remaining two\r\n  months of 2001.Â  Thus, his total withdrawals from his law firm equaled $53,000\r\n  for 2001.Â  His corporate income tax return revealed his law firm earned $66,372 for that same year.Â  During cross-examination,\r\n  Father admitted &quot;the best documentation of my income for the year 2001\r\n  would be the preliminary tax returns that were prepared for the year\r\n  2001.&quot;Â  For 2002, Father produced only a financial declaration as evidence\r\n  of his gross income for that year.Â  In that document, Father claimed to\r\n  withdraw an average of $6,000 a month from his law firm from January 1 through August\r\n  31.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  the end of trial, a few things were apparent.Â  First, by virtue of his\r\n  testimony and the evidence presented at trial, Father vastly understated his\r\n  gross income in his 2001 financial declaration.Â  This fact necessarily called\r\n  into question the veracity of his 2002 financial declaration.Â  Second, the\r\n  amount of money Father withdrew from his law firm in 2001, $53,000, represented\r\n  about 80% of what he claimed to be his true gross income for that year,\r\n  $66,372, as evidenced by his 2001 corporate income tax return.Â  Third, Father's\r\n  2001 corporate income tax return served as the only credible evidence to\r\n  demonstrate his gross income.Â  Still, the family court was faced with the\r\n  difficult task of determining Father's current gross income, and the only\r\n  evidence depicting his gross income for the current year was his 2002 financial\r\n  declaration.Â  To determine Father's current gross income, the family court\r\n  relied on the historical relationship between Father's 2001 withdrawals and his\r\n  2001 corporate income tax return.Â  From this evidence, the family court\r\n  determined Father's withdrawals amounted to only 80% of his actual gross income\r\n  for that year (80% of $66,372 = $53,097.60).Â  Thus, when Father claimed to\r\n  withdraw an average of $6,000 a month from his law firm from January 1, 2002\r\n  through August 31, 2002, the family court, operating under the assumption that this\r\n  amount equaled only 80% of his income, concluded Father's gross income totaled\r\n  $7,500 per month (80% of $6,000 = $7,500). \r\nThe family court\r\n  relied on the lone piece of credible evidence, Father's 2001 financial\r\n  declaration, in determining Father's income for child-support purposes.Â  We\r\n  cannot conclude the family court abused its discretion in making this\r\n  determination.Â  See Kelley, 324 S.C. at 485, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n    729 (stating an abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the court's decision is\r\n  controlled by some error of law or where the factual findings are without\r\n  evidentiary support).Â  In addition, Father only provided the court with a\r\n  financial declaration to evidence his current income for 2002.Â  Father's\r\n  testimony and the evidence presented at trial demonstrated his 2001 financial\r\n  declaration understated his income for that year.Â  Thus, the veracity of his\r\n  2002 financial declaration was also called into question.[10]Â  As a result, Father's refusal to provide the family\r\n  court with a meaningful representation of his current income precludes him from\r\n  complaining of the family court's ruling on appeal.Â  See Patrick v.\r\n    Britt, 364 S.C. 508, 513, 613 S.E.2d 541, 544 (Ct. App. 2005) (affirming\r\n  the family court's determination of Father's income where he refused to provide\r\n  the court with any meaningful representation of his current income).Â  Lastly,\r\n  even if the family court erred in determining Father's gross income, such error\r\n  was caused by Father's failure to provide the court with accurate financial\r\n  information.Â  See Cox\r\n    v. Cox, 290 S.C. 245,\r\n  248, 349 S.E.2d 92, 93 (Ct. App. 1986) (&quot;A party cannot complain of an\r\n  error which his own conduct has induced.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n  family court's decision to impute income to Father.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Father's\r\n  Expenses\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court improperly added ordinary business expenses to his gross\r\n  income.Â  Specifically, Father claims the court erred in adding $7,884.37 worth\r\n  of automobile expenses, $1,960 in parking expenses, and $2,400 in annual debt\r\n  repayment from Daphne Burns to his gross income. \r\nThe\r\n  court should count as income expense reimbursements or\r\n  in-kind payments received by a parent from self-employment if they are\r\n  significant and reduce personal living expenses, such as a company car, free\r\n  housing, or reimbursed meals.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(3)(c) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nThe family court correctly determined Father's vehicle expenses for\r\n  2001 totaled $7,884.37.Â  Initially, Father contends he reported his vehicle\r\n  expenses of $2,462.95 as gross income in his 2001 corporate income tax return;\r\n  therefore, he asserts the family court erred in adding this amount back to his\r\n  gross income.Â  Father fails to cite to a specific page in his corporate income\r\n  tax return to support his argument.Â  Moreover, after reviewing the record, we\r\n  have been unable to find where Father listed this amount as income on his tax\r\n  return.Â  Accordingly, we conclude this evidence does not appear in the record\r\n  and cannot be considered on appeal.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR (stating an\r\n  appellate court may not consider a fact which does not appear in the record).Â  \r\nNext, Father argues his 2001 lease payments equaled $4,428, and his\r\n  total vehicle expenses amounted to $7,037, not $7,884.37 as set forth by the\r\n  family court.Â  No evidence in the record shows the amount of lease payments\r\n  paid by Father.Â  Instead, Father has &quot;automobile expenses&quot; itemized\r\n  as an expense in the amount of $7,884.37.Â  Assuming Father is correct,\r\n  automobile expenses, not just lease payments, paid by his law firm on his\r\n  behalf would still qualify as in-kind income and would be subject to imputation\r\n  as gross income.Â  If the family court erred by using the term &quot;lease\r\n  payments&quot; in lieu of the term &quot;automobile expenses,&quot; the error\r\n  is without consequence.Â  See McCall, 294 S.C. at 4, 362 S.E.2d at 28 (&quot;[W]hatever\r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.&quot;).Â  While Father's Form 2106-EZ indicates his total vehicle expenses for 2001 were\r\n  $7,037, Father, in another piece of evidence, acknowledges his vehicle expenses\r\n  for the same year totaled $7,884.37.Â  In light of the contradictory evidence\r\n  submitted by Father to the family court, we cannot conclude the family court\r\n  erred in determining his vehicle expenses for 2001 equaled $7,884.37.Â \r\n  Moreover, Father's Form 2106-EZ appears only as an attachment to his Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion.Â  Accordingly, it cannot be considered on appeal.Â  See Hickman\r\n    v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (&quot;A\r\n  party cannot use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could\r\n  have raised prior to judgment but did not.&quot;).Â  Therefore, the family court\r\n  properly added $7,884.37 to Father's gross income. \r\nHowever, the family court erred in adding Father's parking charges to his\r\n  gross income.Â  The record reveals Father's law firm spent $1,960 annually so he\r\n  could park his car downtown near his office.Â  Unlike an automobile, a parking\r\n  space for work qualifies as an ordinary and necessary business expense and is properly\r\n  deductible from the gross receipts of Father's business.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(4) (noting a self-employed parent's gross income for\r\n  child support purposes equals gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary\r\n  expenses required for business operation).Â  Additionally, the family court\r\n  erred in counting the $2,400 Father received from his former wife, Daphne\r\n  Burns, as income.Â  Father's amended financial declaration specifically notes\r\n  this money was for repayment of a debt.Â  We do not believe payment received in\r\n  satisfaction of a debt qualifies as gross income under the child-support\r\n  guidelines.Â  On remand, these expenses should be deducted from Father's gross\r\n  income, and the family court should recalculate child support pursuant to this\r\n  order.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp; Reimbursement\r\n  of Child Support Paid By Mother\r\nOn\r\n  cross-appeal, Mother argues Father understated his income at the temporary\r\n  hearing before Judge Segars-Andrews in\r\n  2001. Â As a result, Mother claims Father should reimburse the $6,000 she paid\r\n  in child support pursuant to the temporary order.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  never raised a claim for retroactive reimbursement of child support at trial\r\n  and presented this argument to the court for the first time during her\r\n  post-trial motions pursuant to Rule 59 and Rule 60.Â  Accordingly, Mother's\r\n  arguments are not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Hickman,\r\n  301 S.C. at 456, 392 S.E.2d at 482 (&quot;A\r\n  party cannot use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could\r\n  have raised prior to judgment but did not.&quot;). Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIV.Â \r\n  FEES\r\nA.&nbsp; Guardian\r\n  ad Litem Fees\r\nFather argues the family court erred in relying on the Guardian's\r\n  report and recommendation.Â  Father contends the Guardian conducted her\r\n  investigation in a biased manner.Â  In addition, Father claims the Guardian's report\r\n  was incomplete because it failed to include a custody recommendation.Â  Because\r\n  her report was flawed, Father contends the issue of Guardian's fees should be\r\n  remanded to the family court.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Patel v. Patel, the Supreme Court of South Carolina set forth\r\n  base-line standards a Guardian should follow in developing a recommendation to\r\n  the family court.Â  347 S.C. 281, 288-89, 555 S.E.2d 386, 390 (2001).Â  Pursuant\r\n  to Patel, the Guardian shall:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  conduct an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation to determine the\r\n  facts relevant to the situation of the child and the family, which should\r\n  include: Â reviewing relevant documents; meeting with and observing the child in\r\n  the home setting and considering the child's wishes, if appropriate; and\r\n  interviewing parents, caregivers, and others with knowledge relevant to the\r\n  case; (2) advocate for the child's best interests by making specific and clear\r\n  recommendations, when necessary, for evaluation, services, and treatment for\r\n  the child and the child's family; (3) attend all court hearings and provide\r\n  accurate, current information directly to the court; (4) maintain a complete\r\n  file with notes rather than relying upon court files; and\r\n  (5) present to the court and all other parties clear and comprehensive written\r\n  reports, including but not limited to a final report regarding the child's best\r\n  interest, which includes conclusions and recommendations and the facts upon\r\n  which the reports are based.[11]\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId.\r\nFather's arguments are\r\n  not preserved for appeal.Â  While Father complained of the Guardian's bias\r\n  during his testimony, he never made a motion to relieve the Guardian of her\r\n  duties based on bias.[12]Â  See Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510\r\n  (2006) (stating issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be\r\n  considered on appeal).Â  In addition, Father never asserted the Guardian's\r\n  report was incomplete or otherwise objected to her report because it lacked a\r\n  recommendation.Â  See Webb v.\r\n    CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 655,\r\n  615 S.E.2d 440, 449 (2005) (noting a contemporaneous objection is required to\r\n  preserve issues for appellate review).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  these arguments are not preserved for appellate review.Â  Therefore, we affirm\r\n  the family court's award of fees to the Guardian.Â  Â Â \r\nB.Â  Attorney's\r\n  FeesÂ Â Â  \r\nFather argues the\r\n  family court erred in awarding attorney's fees to Mother.Â  In the alternative,\r\n  Father asserts that the amount of attorney's fees awarded were excessive.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  Â Â \r\n&quot;The award of attorney's fees is left to\r\n  the discretion of the trial judge and will only be disturbed upon a showing of\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624\r\n  S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006). Â In\r\n  awarding attorney's fees, the court should consider each party's ability to pay\r\n  his or her own fee, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the\r\n  parties' respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each\r\n  party's standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the amount of attorney's fees to award,\r\n  the court should consider the:Â  (1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) time\r\n  necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; (6) customary\r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock\r\n    v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  did not err in awarding $43,675 in attorney's fees to Mother.Â  Contrary to Father's\r\n  assertions, Mother obtained beneficial results both at the temporary hearing\r\n  and at trial.Â  At the temporary hearing, Judge Segars-Andrews reduced Mother's\r\n  child support payments by 50% and awarded her overnight visitation with the\r\n  children one day a week and on every other weekend.Â  Before the temporary\r\n  hearing, the visitation schedule in effect was established based on Mother's\r\n  residence in Nashville.Â  Consequently, the visitation schedule did not allow\r\n  Mother to see the children on a weekly basis.Â  At trial, Mother received\r\n  additional beneficial results in gaining joint physical custody of the\r\n  children, primary legal custody of the children, and child support from Father.[13]Â  Accordingly, Mother obtained beneficial\r\n  results at trial.[14]Â  \r\nNext, Father\r\n  contends the amount of attorney's fees awarded were excessive in light of his\r\n  income.Â Â  Typically, we would be very concerned by an award of attorney's fees\r\n  representing approximately 40% of Father's annual income.Â  See Rogers\r\n    v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 334, 540 S.E.2d 840, 842 (2001) (reversing the\r\n  family court's award of attorney's fees where the award represented 16% of\r\n  Mother's annual income, and some of the beneficial results obtained by Mother\r\n  in the litigation were reversed on appeal).Â  However, in this case, the family\r\n  court based its award of attorney's fees, not only on the factors set forth in Glasscock,\r\n  but also on Father's uncooperative conduct in discovery and his evasiveness in\r\n  answering questions with respect to his financial situation. Â A review of the\r\n  record reveals that Father's uncooperative conduct greatly contributed to the\r\n  litigation costs associated with this action.Â  During discovery, Father failed\r\n  to respond to basic requests for production of documents on two occasions.Â  In\r\n  both instances, Father's obstructionist tactics caused Mother to incur the\r\n  unnecessary expense of drafting motions and attending court proceedings.Â  To\r\n  compound matters, Father gave evasive answers to questions about his finances.Â \r\n  At one point during cross-examination, Father answered that he could not\r\n  remember how much money he withdrew from his law firm in 2001.Â Â Â   Taking into\r\n  account that Father's uncooperative conduct greatly increased the cost of\r\n  litigation, we affirm the family court's award of $43,675 in attorney's fees to\r\n  Mother.Â  See Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d\r\n  741, 748 (1989) (holding husband's lack of cooperation serves as an additional\r\n  basis for the award of attorney's fees); Anderson v. Tolbert, 322 S.C.\r\n  543, 549-50, 473 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting an uncooperative party\r\n  who does much to prolong and hamper a final resolution of the issues in a\r\n  domestic case should not be rewarded for such conduct).Â Â  \r\nV.Â  RELIEF FROM DISCOVERY /\r\n  EX PARTE ORDERS\r\nMother asks us to\r\n  vacate discovery orders from seven years ago, and an ex parte order, which\r\n  Father and the judge who issued it, acknowledge is moot.Â  We decline to do so\r\n  because such an order from this court would have no practical legal effect.Â  See Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (noting\r\n  an issue becomes moot when a decision, if rendered, will have no practical\r\n  legal effect upon the existing controversy).Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is Â \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The specialization required in her field of health-care\r\n  finance did not translate to other finance positions.Â  \r\n[2] Despite Daphne's  transient living arrangement, the\r\n  children maintained a &quot;very close&quot; relationship with her.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[3] Mother bought her own home approximately a month\r\n  later.Â  \r\n[4] Under the 1999 order, visitation consisted of monthly\r\n  weekend visitations and longer periods of visitation during the summer and on\r\n  school vacations.Â  The 1999 order did not include a normal weekly sharing of\r\n  custody between the parties due to the distance between their residences.Â  \r\n[5] Father had not discussed with Mother what plans she\r\n  had for the children after school registration.Â  Therefore, his statement that\r\n  they were to be left alone &quot;all day&quot; is speculative.Â  However, it is\r\n  accurate to say the children were left alone for about an hour from the time\r\n  Mother left for work until Father picked up the children.Â  \r\n[6] Although the Guardian requested that both parties\r\n  provide her with a written list of witnesses to interview, neither party did\r\n  so.Â  \r\n[7] At trial, Father admitted withdrawing $53,000 from\r\n  his law firm in 2001.Â  By contrast, his 2001 corporate income tax return\r\n  reported his income for the year equaled $66,372.Â  \r\n[8] We note that Father's argument concerning the\r\n  family court's reliance on the Guardian's report and recommendation is not\r\n  preserved for appellate review.Â  This issue is addressed directly under the\r\n  &quot;Fees&quot; section of this opinion.Â  \r\n[9] In his Rule 60(b)(2) motion, Father also sought\r\n  relief from judgment because Mother moved from her residence and continued to\r\n  leave the children alone at home.Â  We believe the family court acted within its\r\n  discretion in refusing to grant Father relief on these grounds.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[10] This is not the first time Father has failed to\r\n  provide candid financial information to the family court.Â  During a hearing\r\n  before the office of disciplinary counsel, Father acknowledged he did not make\r\n  full financial disclosure when initially seeking a divorce from Mother.Â  See In re Barker, 352 S.C. 71, 74, 572 S.E.2d 460, 461 (2002) (suspending\r\n  Father from the practice of law for six months).Â Â  \r\n[11] We note the statutory Guardian ad Litem guidelines\r\n  only apply to guardians appointed on or after January 15, 2003.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 193-94, 612 S.E.2d 707, 713 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  The Guardian in this case was appointed on November 13, 2001.Â \r\n  Consequently, Patel and its progeny control.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n[12] Father's lone\r\n  motion to relieve the Guardian was on the basis of her move to Washington.Â  \r\n[13] On appeal,\r\n  Father claims Mother failed to obtain beneficial results at trial because she\r\n  received no more than Father offered in settlement negotiationsâ€”joint physical\r\n  custody of the children. Â While we disagree with Father's argument, we also\r\n  note that statements made during settlement negotiations are inadmissible.Â  See Rule 408, SCRE (&quot;Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise\r\n    negotiations is likewise not admissible.&quot;).\r\n[14] In addition, we note that this controversy between Mother and Father developed into a highly\r\n  contentious litigation.Â  In the end, the trial lasted for five full days.Â \r\n  During this time, twenty-one witnesses were called, and sixty-four exhibits\r\n  were presented to the court.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
