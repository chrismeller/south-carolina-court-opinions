We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWilliams was tried on Tuesday, April 20, 1999. \r\n  The jury began deliberations at 3:45 p.m. At 5:10 p.m. the jury requested the \r\n  arresting officer's testimony be replayed, then resumed its deliberations at \r\n  5:30 p.m. At 6:00 p.m. the judge sent the jury home for the evening. The jury \r\n  resumed deliberations at 9:30 a.m. the following day. At 11:00 a.m. they sent \r\n  the judge a note stating they could not reach a verdict. The note in its entirety \r\n  read, \"The jury has come to a deadlock at 11 to 1 and its (sic) not going to \r\n  change,\" and was signed by the jury foreman. \r\n\r\nWilliams moved for a mistrial and contended an \r\n  Allen charge would be inappropriate because the jury was \"hopelessly \r\n  deadlocked.\" The judge denied the motion, brought the jury in, and gave them \r\n  the following instruction:\r\n\r\n\r\n  When you tell me-you use the word deadlocked. It's \r\n    always unfortunate when juries can't reach a verdict. I practiced law now \r\n    for-I practiced law 30 years and now I've been a judge for 19 years and in \r\n    all of that time all the trials I've been involved in and you can count the \r\n    number of mistrials on these two hands because jurors almost always reach \r\n    a verdict.\r\n\r\n  You haven't been deliberating that long and it's \r\n    always so unfortunate because if I declare a mistrial, then in this same courtroom, \r\n    in all probability; with the same witnesses; in all probability, the same \r\n    lawyers, 12 other people in this county will have to decide this issue and \r\n    I don't know of 12 better people to decide this issue than you 12.\r\n\r\n  Now, the law doesn't require that a juror violate \r\n    his or her conscience just to agree with the other jurors but the law does \r\n    ask that each juror listen to the other jurors with an open mind, willing \r\n    to be convinced, keeping in mind that you don't have to violate your conscience \r\n    just to agree on a verdict.\r\n\r\n  As I say, you haven't been deliberating very long. \r\n    I'll make provisions. If anybody smokes, you can smoke. When lunchtime comes, \r\n    if you're still deliberating, I can get you lunch. This afternoon if any of \r\n    you get tired, you all decide you want to get a motel room, we can make arrangements \r\n    to send home for your clothes and things. I can make arrangements for any \r\n    kind of telephone calls, those kind of things. I don't have a thing in the \r\n    world to do. We're gone (sic) be working anyway. Be working today, be working \r\n    tomorrow.\r\n\r\n  Now, I'm gone (sic) ask-I'm gone (sic) send you \r\n    back and ask you to begin deliberating. If you make any-if you need anything \r\n    to make you comfortable be sure to tell the bailiffs. They're fine people \r\n    and they're delighted to make you comfortable. I'm gone (sic) send you back \r\n    to room and tell you to begin your-continue deliberations.\r\n\r\n  Any testimony you want to hear again or any law \r\n    that you want to tell me, just tell me about it. Continue your deliberations \r\n    and let me know ahead of time whether or not you want lunch, and remember \r\n    what I said about if you get tired. I realize jurors very often cooped up \r\n    in a room get tired. If you need-feel like you need to rest some, let me know, \r\n    we'll make some arrangements for you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliams objected to the charge, arguing it was \r\n  a sweat box instruction, and requested an additional charge which the judge \r\n  denied. At 11:20 a.m. the jury once again asked to hear the testimony of the \r\n  arresting officer. The jury then deliberated from 11:35 a.m. until they reached \r\n  a verdict at 1:15 p.m.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWilliams argues on appeal the trial judge's charge \r\n  coerced the verdict due to the time the jury deliberated and because the charge \r\n  implied the jurors would have to deliberate indefinitely. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The trial judge has a duty to urge the jury to \r\n  reach a verdict, but he may not coerce it.\" State v. Pauling, 322 S.C. \r\n  95, 99, 470 S.E.2d 106, 108-09 (1996); see State v. Darr, 262 \r\n  S.C. 585, 587, 206 S.E.2d 870, 870 (1974) (\"It is the duty of the trial judge \r\n  to urge the jury to agree upon a verdict provided he does not coerce them.\"). \r\n  Review of an Allen charge requires this court to consider the charge \r\n  in light of the accompanying circumstances. See generally State v. \r\n  Hale, 284 S.C. 348, 326 S.E.2d 418 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\nFactors to be considered in determining whether \r\n  a charge is coercive include the length of the deliberations prior to the charge, \r\n  (2) the length of the deliberations following the Allen charge, \r\n  (3) and the total length of deliberations. (4) \r\n  The trial judge may not indicate to or threaten the jury that they must agree \r\n  or, failing to agree, they will remain in the jury room for a specified length \r\n  of time. See State&nbsp;v. Simon, 126 S.C. 437, 445-46, 120 S.E. \r\n  230, 233 (1923) (stating trial judge erred by telling the jurors they must remain \r\n  overnight in a small jury room for fifteen and a half hours unless they could \r\n  agree on a verdict).\r\n\r\nIn addition, a trial judge may not direct the Allen \r\n  charge towards the minority voter(s) on the panel. See State v. Elmore, \r\n  279 S.C. 417, 424, 308 S.E.2d 781, 785-86 (1983), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). However, \r\n  it is not necessarily coercive to give an Allen charge even though the jury \r\n  reports it is deadlocked eleven to one. See State v. Jones, 320 \r\n  S.C. 555, 558-59, 466 S.E.2d 733, 734-35 (Ct. App. 1996) (concluding the trial \r\n  court gave a proper Allen charge even though the jury sent a note stating \r\n  it was \"hung 11 to 1\" because the charge, taken as a whole, was not coercive).\r\n\r\nThe jury deliberated for approximately two hours \r\n  on Tuesday before the trial judge sent them home for the evening. They resumed \r\n  deliberations for one hour and a half the following morning before notifying \r\n  the trial judge they were deadlocked. After the Allen charge, the jury \r\n  deliberated less than twenty minutes, reheard testimony, and deliberated for \r\n  approximately two more hours before reaching a verdict. The total deliberations \r\n  took less than six hours. We find no coercion in the timing of the Allen \r\n  charge or in the total length of deliberations. See Tillman, 304 \r\n  S.C. at 521, 405 S.E.2d at 612-13 (concluding the Allen charge was not \r\n  coercive when given after four hours of deliberation and the verdict was rendered \r\n  one and a half hours after the charge).\r\n\r\nWilliams invites our attention to the recent Fourth \r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals case of Tucker v. Catoe, 221 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. \r\n  2000). In Tucker, the Fourth Circuit found an Allen charge unduly \r\n  coercive, noting that \"South Carolina has yet to specify circumstances under \r\n  which an Allen charge is coercive, but there are numerous decisions from \r\n  the federal courts that guide our consideration [of] Tucker's argument.\" 221 \r\n  F.3d at 609. Any reliance on Tucker is misplaced for several reasons, \r\n  not the least of which is that the Allen charge in question was given \r\n  during the sentencing phase of a capital murder case and that fact, coupled \r\n  with other factual distinctions, clearly compelled the decision in Tucker.\r\n\r\nWe also find the trial judge did not coerce a verdict \r\n  by implying the jury would have to deliberate indefinitely. The judge informed \r\n  the jurors he would make arrangements for their comfort should the jurors get \r\n  tired or become hungry. In State v. Ayers, this court reviewed the propriety \r\n  of an Allen charge similar to that given by the trial judge in this case. \r\n  284 S.C. 266, 325 S.E.2d 579 (Ct. App. 1985). In Ayers, the jury deliberated \r\n  for a little over two hours, requested a recharge of a statute, and deliberated \r\n  further for more than an hour. Id. at 268-69, 325 S.E.2d at 580-81. The \r\n  jury then reported they could not reach a verdict. Id. at 269, 325 S.E.2d \r\n  at 581. The forelady told the judge, \"no matter how long we stay in that room, \r\n  or if we stayed in here two long weeks or forever, we would never be able to \r\n  change some of the convictions.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn Ayers, the judge responded, \"I am prohibited \r\n  from declaring a mistrial until a substantial time has elapsed in terms of the \r\n  jury being able to consider the evidence and the testimony.\" Id. The \r\n  judge went on to say he could either make hotel accommodations for the jury \r\n  or let them continue deliberating, and he commented on the expense of operating \r\n  the judicial system and the importance of bringing matters to a conclusion. \r\n  Id. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing the verdict was being \r\n  coerced. Id. This court reviewed the Allen charge as a whole and \r\n  concluded the trial judge's instructions were not coercive. Id.\r\n\r\nConsidering the Allen charge as a whole, \r\n  it is clear that the judge was solicitous of the welfare of the jurors and his \r\n  remarks concerning getting a motel room for them or providing a rest period \r\n  for them were not calculated to be of a threatening nature, but were genuine \r\n  expressions of concern for their comfort and welfare. We therefore conclude \r\n  that the charge was not coercive.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur. \r\n   \r\n1.  Allen v.

Cooper, \r\n  Jr. (Husband) appeals from a family court order finding the provisions of a \r\n  property settlement and support agreement nonmodifiable and holding him in contempt \r\n  for failure to comply with the provisions of the agreement. We affirm in part \r\n  and reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nHusband and Denise Smith-Cooper (Wife) were married \r\n  in 1987 and divorced on September 26, 1994. On August 26, 1994, the parties \r\n  executed a property settlement and support agreement which the family court \r\n  approved and incorporated into the divorce decree. The agreement obligates Husband \r\n  to pay $260 in alimony to Wife every other week, as well as numerous other expenses \r\n  for Wife, including: the mortgage on Wife's residence, assistance with the costs \r\n  of repairs and maintenance on Wife's residence, land option payments, automobile \r\n  insurance, health insurance, uninsured medical expenses, and life insurance. \r\n  (1) The agreement further provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nAs any of the above expenses are paid in full or the obligation no longer exists, Husband is no longer obligated to make these\r\npayments and the total amount of his monthly obligation to Wife will be reduced accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf at any time Wife receives social security disability benefits or becomes employed in a full time capacity, all amounts received\r\nfrom the sources, after 6 months of such receipt, shall be reduced from Husband's total obligation at that time by the amount\r\nWife receives from the sources. . . . The ultimate goal of both parties is that at some future time, Wife will become totally self-sufficient and will not require any assistance from Husband. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties also expressly agreed that \"this agreement shall not be modifiable by any court without the consent of both parties\"\r\nand that all modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties.\r\n\r\nIn October 1995, Wife applied for social security disability benefits, claiming she became disabled in January 1991, due to\r\nirritable bowel syndrome and depression.  In February 1996, the Social Security Administration denied her application.  She\r\ndid not appeal.  After the commencement of this action, Wife hired an attorney to pursue a second claim for social security\r\nbenefits.  In October 1998, the Social Security Administration again denied her claim.\r\n\r\nIn January 1998, Husband lost his job.  He received two weeks severance pay, payment for his accrued sick leave, and\r\nunemployment benefits in the amount of $224.00 per week for several months.  Wife's health insurance, which was acquired\r\nthrough Husband's employment, expired in January 1998.\r\n\r\nWife petitioned the family court for a rule to show cause why Husband should not be held in contempt for failure to comply\r\nwith the support provisions of the agreement.  Prior to the hearing, Husband brought an action against Wife for modification or\r\ntermination of his alimony obligation.\r\n\r\nThe consolidated cases were tried before the family court on January 4, 5, and 6, 1999.  By order dated March 11, 1999, the\r\nfamily court found the agreement was not modifiable and held Husband in contempt.  The court ordered Husband (1) to\r\ncontinue paying Wife's mortgage and be responsible for the upkeep, maintenance and repairs on the property, and (2) to\r\ncontinue paying Wife alimony and satisfy an alimony arrearage of $1,720.\r\n\r\nThe court further found Husband allowed Wife's health insurance to lapse without informing her of her right to obtain COBRA\r\ncoverage from his former employment.  The court ordered Husband to pay all of Wife's outstanding medical and dental\r\nexpenses, including reimbursing her for medical bills she paid and for outstanding bills due.  In addition, the family court\r\nordered Husband to obtain health insurance for Wife, provided that his liability for her uninsured medical expenses would\r\ncontinue until he obtained insurance coverage on her behalf.  Additionally, the family court directed Wife to undergo\r\npsychiatric counseling \"in order that she overcome her medical and psychological problems in an effort to become employed.\" \r\nThe court ordered Husband to contribute $70 every other week to Wife for the cost of counseling.  Finally, the family court\r\nawarded Wife $7,500 in attorney fees.  The family court denied Husband's post-trial motion for reconsideration.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992). This broad scope of review does not, however, require this \r\n  court to disregard the findings of the family court. Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981). Neither are we required to ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony. Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 \r\n  (1981).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Judicial Modification of Agreement\r\n\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in finding the agreement may not be judicially modified.  We agree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, where an agreement is clear and capable \r\n  of legal construction, the court's only function is to interpret its lawful \r\n  meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the agreement. Bogan \r\n  v. Bogan, 298 S.C. 139, 142, 378 S.E.2d 606, 608 (Ct. App. 1989). However, \r\n  where an agreement is ambiguous, the court should seek to determine the parties' \r\n  intent. Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995); Mattox v. Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, 60-61, 344 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986). A contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning \r\n  or when its meaning is unclear. Bruce v. Blalock, 241 S.C. 155, 160, \r\n  127 S.E.2d 439, 441 (1962); 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 338, at 345 (1991).\r\n\r\nHere, one portion of the agreement reads: \"The parties agree that this agreement shall not be modifiable by any court without\r\nthe consent of both parties.\"  However, the alimony portion of the agreement clearly and unambiguously envisions that\r\nHusband's alimony obligation will be reduced as Wife receives social security disability benefits or becomes employed. \r\nMoreover, the alimony provision states: \"The ultimate goal of both parties is that at some future time, Wife will become totally\r\nself-sufficient and will not require any assistance from Husband.\"\r\n\r\nThe family court judge found he could not modify the alimony provisions of the agreement because of the clause relating to\r\nnon-modifiability.  However, this construction of the agreement completely eviscerates the portions of the agreement\r\nconcerning the reduction of Husband's alimony obligation as Wife receives social security disability benefits or becomes\r\nemployed.  It is clear that the parties intended their agreement regarding alimony would be modified downward as Wife\r\nbecame more self-sufficient.  In fact, during the hearing to approve the parties' agreement, Wife's counsel stated that Husband\r\nwould continue to pay alimony \"until disability kicks in or until she becomes capable of going back to work.\"  In the face of\r\nsuch clearly expressed intent, we hold it was error for the family court judge to rule that he was without authority to modify the\r\nalimony provisions of the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe family court's ruling regarding non-modifiability places Husband in the untenable position of being unable to obtain relief\r\nso long as Wife neither receives social security disability benefits nor becomes gainfully employed.  It also encourages Wife to\r\nexert little or no effort to become employed.  Our reading of the agreement convinces us that it specifically and unequivocally\r\nprovided for the downward modification of Husband's alimony obligation. \r\n\r\nWhile the family court refused Husband's request for modification, it increased Husband's alimony obligation beyond that\r\ncontemplated by the parties' agreement.  This was error.  The agreement provided that, with respect to the marital residence,\r\n\"Husband will assist  in paying costs of maintenance and repairs.\"  The family court established a procedure whereby Wife was\r\nto provide Husband with estimates from contractors concerning any repairs to the property, and further provided that if\r\nHusband did not find a contractor himself within thirty days, he \"shall then be required to pay the estimated costs to the\r\ncontractor upon completion of the job.\"  Thus, despite the family court's ruling that the agreement was non-modifiable, the\r\ncourt modified the agreement by requiring Husband to be 100% responsible for the payment of the repairs.  This was clearly\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nUnder our reading of the agreement, the parties contemplated that any modification to the agreement would be a downward\r\nmodification of Husband's obligations, not an upward modification.  The family court's order is reversed to the extent it\r\nprovides a procedure to facilitate Husband's assistance with repairs and maintenance of the home and requires Husband to be\r\nfully responsible for these expenses.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the family court's mandate that Husband pay Wife $70 every other week towards the cost of Wife's counseling was\r\nerroneous.  In the provision relating to Husband's maintenance of health insurance for the benefit of Wife, the agreement\r\nprovides that \"Husband will be responsible for all deductible amounts incurred by Wife on the applicable health insurance\r\npolicy for any physical exam, any diagnostic proceeding and any necessary treatment up to a total amount equal to the\r\ninsurance deductible per year.\"  Although the agreement provides that \"Husband is to be responsible for uncovered medical,\r\ndental and prescriptions,\" counseling is not included within this language.  The family court's order thus impermissibly\r\nenlarges Husband's alimony obligation to Wife, something which was not contemplated by the parties' agreement. \r\nAccordingly, that portion of the order is reversed.\r\n\r\nII. Imputation of Income\r\n\r\nHusband also asserts the family court erred in failing to impute income to Wife.  He alleges Wife has acted in bad faith and that\r\nher \"delay and unwillingness to pursue her claim has irreparably prejudiced her ability to acquire disability benefits as\r\ncontemplated by the parties.\"  While we do not reach Husband's allegations of bad faith, we agree that the family court failed\r\nto consider the question of Wife's employability.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the agreement, Wife asserts she has unsuccessfully sought employment in her field of expertise on at least\r\nthree occasions, and has twice attempted to work outside that field.  At the time of trial, Wife was being treated for depression,\r\nchronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease.  She also has the Epstein-Barr virus,\r\nwhich causes symptoms similar to mononucleosis in adults.  Her conditions are treated with three antidepressants and\r\nmedications prescribed to treat anxiety, abdominal discomfort, abdominal spasms and acidity, diarrhea, and nausea.  Dr. Ronald\r\nSteen testified that a person suffering from these medical disorders would generally not be able to maintain employment.  Dr.\r\nSteen opined Wife would never be able to work outside her home due to her illnesses.\r\n\r\nHusband presented the testimony of Joel Leonard, a vocational consultant, regarding Wife's capacity to work.  Leonard based\r\nhis opinion on his review of Wife's medical records, her social security file, and her deposition testimony.  Leonard testified\r\nWife could perform at a level of employment with a median gross income of $17,160.  However, he stated she needed\r\nvocational rehabilitation and would benefit from mental health counseling.  Apparently because the family court thought to do\r\nso would constitute an impermissible modification of the parties' agreement, the court refused to impute income to Wife.\r\n\r\nThe Social Security Administration found Wife was \r\n  not disabled and refused her disability benefits. However, Wife claims she is \r\n  disabled and therefore cannot secure employment. Quite simply, Wife cannot have \r\n  it both ways. In other words, she cannot accept the decision of the Social Security \r\n  Administration that she is not disabled and yet claim she is too disabled to \r\n  work, forcing Husband to continue providing her full support. See Ebert, \r\n  320 S.C. at 338-39, 465 S.E.2d at 125-26 (finding that Husband is not required \r\n  to continue paying Wife's mortgage where the parties intended Wife would sell \r\n  the home but settlement agreement does not specify when she must sell it). Taking \r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we believe that Wife is capable \r\n  of some employment as Joel Leonard testified. However, because there was not \r\n  a full evidentiary hearing on Wife's employability, we remand this issue to \r\n  the family court for a hearing with instructions to impute income to Wife and \r\n  to reduce Husband's alimony obligation accordingly, pursuant to the terms of \r\n  the parties' agreement. See Micheau v. Micheau, 285 S.C. 527, \r\n  529, 331 S.E.2d 348, 349 (1985) (stating that disputed factual issue must be \r\n  remanded back to the family court for factual findings); Condon v. Condon, \r\n  280 S.C. 357, 360, 312 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding that the \r\n  court of appeals must remand issues to the family court for a hearing if the \r\n  record is insufficient for adequate review on appeal).\r\n\r\nIII. Health Insurance\r\n\r\nHusband next contends his obligation to provide Wife with medical insurance and to pay her uninsured medical expenses\r\nterminated when he lost his job in January 1998.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nParagraphs 4 and 13 of the parties' agreement set forth Husband's obligation to provide health insurance to Wife and pay her\r\nuninsured medical costs.  The relevant language reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Husband will be responsible for all deductible amounts incurred by Wife on the applicable health insurance policy for any\r\nphysical exam, any diagnostic proceeding and any necessary treatment up to a total amount equal to the insurance deductible\r\nper year.\r\n\r\nHusband agrees to pay to Wife, on a monthly basis, as alimony, the following bills to wit;\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF) Health insurance covering Wife as an insured, payable directly to insurance company.  Husband to be responsible for\r\nuncovered medical, dental and prescriptions. \r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Husband shall maintain at his expense a group major medical hospitalization and health insurance policy with Wife listed\r\nas an insured thereof through his place of employment.  This obligation shall continue until Wife becomes self sufficient as set\r\nout above.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Husband was employed at the time of the agreement and was insured under a company insurance policy.  He later became\r\nemployed at H2Options and continued to insure Wife under that company's policy.  Wife's coverage under Husband's policy at\r\nH2Options expired in January 1998 when Husband's employment was terminated.\r\n\r\n  From a plain reading of the agreement, we cannot \r\n  conclude that Husband's obligation to provide Wife with health insurance terminated \r\n  upon his unemployment. \"Where an agreement is clear and capable of legal construction, \r\n  the court's only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention \r\n  of the parties as found within the agreement and give effect to it.\" Ebert, \r\n  320 S.C. at 338, 465 S.E.2d at 125. The court must enforce an unambiguous contract \r\n  according to its terms regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, \r\n  or the parties' failure to guard their rights carefully. Ellis v. Taylor, \r\n  316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994). The agreement unambiguously obligates \r\n  Husband to provide Wife with medical insurance coverage regardless of his employment. \r\n  However, depending upon the family court's decision regarding the amount of \r\n  income to impute to Wife, Husband's obligation to continue paying Wife's insurance \r\n  may decrease according to the parties' agreement.\r\n\r\nIV. Contempt\r\n\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in finding \r\n  him in contempt for failing to comply with the provisions of the agreement. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nWife conceded in her testimony that the mortgage \r\n  obligation on her home was current at the time of trial. Further, she testified \r\n  the applicable life insurance premiums were paid at the time of trial and had \r\n  never lapsed. The family court found Wife abandoned her claims for automobile \r\n  expenses and the land upon which the agreement obligated Husband to make option \r\n  payments. Wife has not appealed these findings and they are \r\n  therefore the law of the case. Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 \r\n  S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (holding an unchallenged ruling, \" \r\n  right or wrong, is the law of this case and requires affirmance&quot;).\r\n\r\nOur reading of the record and order reveals the \r\n  family court found Husband in contempt for failure to maintain Wife's health \r\n  insurance, failure to pay Wife's medical expenses, and failure to pay spousal \r\n  support.\r\n\r\n\"Contempt results from the willful disobedience \r\n  of a court order.\" Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d \r\n  125, 129 (1989). A willful act is defined as one \"done voluntarily and intentionally \r\n  with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific \r\n  intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done.\" Spartanburg \r\n  County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, \r\n  874 (1988) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th Ed. 1979)). Where a contemnor \r\n  is unable, without fault on his part, to obey an order of the court, he is not \r\n  to be held in contempt. Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 381, 312 S.E.2d \r\n  598, 599 (Ct. App.1984); see also Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. \r\n  348, 351, 306 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1983) (parent who is unable to make child support \r\n  payments as ordered is not in contempt).\r\n\r\nWe find Husband's failure to comply with the agreement \r\n  was not willful. The testimony at trial reveals Husband's failure to comply \r\n  with his support obligations under the agreement was due to his financial inability. \r\n  It is uncontested Husband underwent periods of involuntary unemployment in 1998. \r\n  During these periods, Husband continued to fulfill his support obligations and \r\n  to make mortgage payments on Wife's home to the extent he was financially able. \r\n  Moreover, Husband was employed at the time of trial and expressed a willingness \r\n  to repay the accumulated arrearage in accordance with a judicially ordered schedule. \r\n  (2) Thus, we hold the facts and circumstances of this case do not \r\n  support a finding of contempt. \r\n\r\nV. Attorney Fees\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife $7,500 in attorney fees.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe factors to be considered in awarding reasonable \r\n  attorney fees and costs include: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the \r\n  case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing \r\n  of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results \r\n  obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services. Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\n\r\n    Particularly in light of our disposition regarding the family court's error in refusing to impute income to Wife and its finding\r\nof contempt, we hold the award to Wife of $7,500 in attorney fees was excessive.  Nonetheless, we recognize Wife incurred\r\nexpenses instituting these proceedings.  Based on our own view of the facts of this case, we reduce the award of attorney fees to\r\n$2,500.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.    \r\n\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Husband asserted in his \r\n  brief and Wife's counsel agreed at oral argument that Husband had been paying \r\n  Wife $17,000 to $18,000 per year pursuant to the agreement.  \r\n 2.  We also remand the issue \r\n  of Husband's request for a $360 credit against the amount of his arrearage. \r\n  Husband claims that he made a $360 payment on the Thursday prior to the trial \r\n  of this case, which had not been received by Wife as of the date of trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3296","title":"State v.

The trial court sentenced him to five \r\nyears imprisonment, imposed a fine of $25,000, and recommended he receive drug \r\nabuse treatment while in prison. Cherry appeals. We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nJust before midnight on July 31, 1998, Officer \r\n  Steven Parker of the Rock Hill Police Department stopped a car driven by Cherry's \r\n  sister for two traffic violations. Cherry was a passenger in the back seat. \r\n  While Officer Parker sat in his patrol car writing citations, another backup \r\n  officer arrived and saw Cherry's sister stuff a pistol into a diaper bag. After \r\n  arresting her, the officers ordered the passengers out of the car to check for \r\n  additional weapons. Cherry had no weapons, but Officer Parker discovered a small \r\n  bag containing approximately eight rocks of crack cocaine in his watch pocket. \r\n  He also seized $322 in cash from Cherry. \r\n\r\nCherry was indicted for possession of crack cocaine \r\n  with intent to distribute and possession of crack cocaine within proximity of \r\n  a public park. At the conclusion of the State's case, the trial court granted \r\n  Cherry's motion for a directed verdict on the charge of possession within proximity \r\n  of a public park. The court denied his motion for a directed verdict on the \r\n  charge of possession with intent to distribute and the jury found him guilty. \r\n  Cherry asserts a number of alleged errors on appeal.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Seating Arrangements\r\n\r\nCherry asserts the trial court erred in denying \r\n  his request to sit at the table closest to the jury. We disagree.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the prosecutor called Cherry's \r\n  case, his counsel made a motion for the defense to sit at the table closest \r\n  to the jury. At the time, the prosecution occupied that table. After entertaining \r\n  argument from both sides, the court denied Cherry's request, finding the parties \r\n  were seated \"very appropriately.\" \r\n\r\nCherry correctly notes this precise issue was raised \r\n  on appeal to our supreme court in State v. Corn, 215 S.C. 166, 54 S.E.2d \r\n  559 (1949). However, his reliance on that case is misplaced. The supreme court \r\n  reversed the conviction, but specifically declined to address several issues, \r\n  including the question of whether the defense was improperly required to relinquish \r\n  the seats closest to the jury. Id. at 172, 54 S.E.2d at 561. We are convinced \r\n  that nothing in the supreme court's opinion can be construed as a ruling on \r\n  that issue.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in refusing to allow Cherry to occupy the table closest to the jury. It is tradition \r\n  and custom in this state that the party with the primary burden of proof sits \r\n  at the table in closest proximity to the jury. Furthermore, \"[t]he general rule \r\n  in this State is that the conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the \r\n  sound discretion of the presiding judge and this Court will not interfere unless \r\n  it clearly appears that the rights of the complaining party were abused or prejudiced \r\n  in some way.\" State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 \r\n  (1982). Clearly, the court's discretion extends to the parties' seating arrangements. \r\n  See also State v. Lee, 255 S.C. 309, 313, 178 S.E.2d 652, 654 \r\n  (1971) (holding court did not abuse its discretion by refusing defendant's request \r\n  to remove the victim's brother from the prosecution's table). The trial court's \r\n  ruling did not prejudice Cherry's rights. His motion was properly denied.\r\n\r\nII. Voir Dire Questions\r\n\r\nCherry argues the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to ask his proposed voir dire questions. We disagree.\r\n\r\nPrior to jury selection, Cherry's counsel submitted \r\n  eight written questions which he requested the court ask the potential jurors \r\n  on voir dire. The questions asked whether the jurors understood the importance \r\n  of juror honesty; whether they would report a juror who engaged in misconduct; \r\n  whether they were willing to presume a defendant innocent until proven guilty \r\n  despite the fact that he had been arrested by the police; whether they believed \r\n  police officers are more honest than other citizens; whether the defendant's \r\n  failure to testify would affect their views of his guilt or innocence; whether \r\n  they were biased against African-Americans; whether they were biased for or \r\n  against any of the attorneys; and whether they had ever had more than $300 on \r\n  their person. The court denied the request, ruling the questions regarding potential \r\n  biases involving African-Americans or the attorneys involved were covered by \r\n  the court's standard voir dire questions, and that the others were inappropriate. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe questions to be asked on voir dire are provided \r\n  by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1020 which states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The court shall, on motion of either party in the \r\n    suit, examine on oath any person who is called as a juror to know whether \r\n    he is related to either party, has any interest in the cause, has expressed \r\n    or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1020 (Supp. 2000). \r\n\r\nThe trial court has the responsibility to focus \r\n  the scope of voir dire examination as described in section 14-7-1020. Wilson \r\n  v. Childs, 315 S.C. 431, 438, 434 S.E.2d 286, 291 (Ct. App. 1993). \"After \r\n  the statutory questions have been asked and answered, any further examination \r\n  of [the jury] on voir dire must be left to the discretion of the trial judge, \r\n  which is subject to review only for abuse thereof.\" State v. Bethune, \r\n  93 S.C. 195, 199, 75 S.E.2d 281, 282 (1912). As a general rule, \"the trial court \r\n  is not required to ask all voir dire questions submitted by the attorneys.\" \r\n  Wall v. Keels, 331 S.C. 310, 317, 501 S.E.2d 754, 757 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  It appears Cherry's proposed questions were designed to establish a juror profile \r\n  and to influence those jurors who would be selected rather than to uncover bias. \r\n  Cherry does not argue that the court failed to ask the statutorily required \r\n  questions. We are confident the court met the requirements of section 14-7-1020 \r\n  and find no abuse of discretion in its refusal to ask the additional questions.\r\n\r\nIII. Batson Motion \r\n  \r\n\r\nNext, Cherry maintains the trial court erred in \r\n  its denial of his Batson (1) motion. We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\nAfter jury selection, Cherry moved to quash the \r\n  jury, arguing the State used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory \r\n  manner by striking non-whites. The assistant solicitor responded that the three \r\n  strikes Cherry complained of were exercised against persons with criminal convictions \r\n  for assault and battery, passing fraudulent checks, and driving under the influence. \r\n  The court found those reasons racially neutral and asked if Cherry had any evidence \r\n  that the stated reasons were mere pretext. \r\n\r\nCherry's counsel asked to conduct additional voir \r\n  dire to determine whether any member of the jury had been convicted of the same \r\n  offenses. After the court denied that request, the assistant solicitor offered \r\n  the defense an opportunity to look at the NCIC background checks performed on \r\n  each juror. Although defense counsel indicated he wanted to examine those documents, \r\n  it does not appear he did so immediately as offered. The assistant solicitor \r\n  then informed the court that none of the seated jurors had a record of the criminal \r\n  convictions in question, and the court announced the reports would be made a \r\n  part of the record. The parties dispute whether this was ever done. In a post \r\n  trial motion, Cherry argued that because the NCIC reports dated the day of jury \r\n  selection were not immediately admitted into the record, the court's order that \r\n  those specific reports become part of the record was an impossibility. \r\n\r\nThe trial court must hold a Batson hearing \r\n  when members of a cognizable racial or gender group are struck and the opposing \r\n  party requests a hearing. State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 629, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  88, 90 (1999). During the hearing, the proponent of the peremptory strikes must \r\n  present a racially neutral explanation. Id.; State v. Adams, 322 \r\n  S.C. 114, 124, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996). Once this is done, the burden shifts \r\n  to the strike's opponent to show the reason or reasons given were merely pretextual. \r\n  Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91; Adams, 322 S.C. at \r\n  124, 470 S.E.2d at 372. Thus, \"the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial \r\n  motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\" Adams, \r\n  322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372 (quoting Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. \r\n  765, 768 (1995)). If \"the record does not support the solicitor's stated reason \r\n  upon which the trial judge has based his findings, however, those findings will \r\n  be overturned.\" State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 9, 512 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1999).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the reasons \r\n  the assistant solicitor offered to explain the strikes were facially race-neutral. \r\n  Thus, the burden shifted back to Cherry to prove pretext. He offered no evidence \r\n  of pretext and thus simply failed to meet his burden. The record supports the \r\n  State's explanations for the strikes. Moreover, we are not persuaded to reverse \r\n  the court's ruling because the proper documents bearing certain dates were never \r\n  admitted into the record. The record reflects the State offered Cherry an opportunity \r\n  to review the exact documents it used to strike the jurors and that he failed \r\n  to seize this opportunity. Furthermore, the court's ruling that the State's \r\n  explanations were race-neutral is supported by the assistant solicitor's statement \r\n  as an officer of the court, which the court accepted and which Cherry has not \r\n  proven false or pretextual. See, e.g., State v. Patterson, 307 \r\n  S.C. 180, 182-83, 414 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1992) (noting the trial court's findings \r\n  regarding purposeful discrimination rest largely upon its evaluation of the \r\n  prosecutor's credibility and are afforded great deference).\r\n\r\nIV. Evidence\r\n\r\nCherry also challenges the trial court's admission \r\n  of the video tape of his arrest as well as the money and drugs seized from his \r\n  person during the arrest. We find no abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nThe decision to admit or exclude evidence is within \r\n  the trial court's sound discretion, and its ruling will be not be disturbed \r\n  unless an abuse of discretion is shown. State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, \r\n  428, 462 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1995). Additionally, to warrant reversal, the defendant \r\n  must show the erroneous admission resulted in prejudice. State v. Thompson, \r\n  305 S.C. 496, 502, 409 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\nA. Arrest Tape\r\n\r\nOfficer Parker's patrol car was equipped with a \r\n  camera which records both audio and video. During his testimony, the State attempted \r\n  to show the original video tape containing Cherry's arrest to the jury. Although \r\n  the State had previously given the defense a tape of the arrest, Cherry objected \r\n  on the ground that he had not been given an opportunity to view the original \r\n  tape. Defense counsel explained: \"we would need an opportunity to see [what \r\n  the original portrays] before we pass on it.\" After a bench conference, the \r\n  court admitted the tape into evidence over Cherry's objection. When the State \r\n  then attempted to publish the tape to the jury, Cherry insisted that the court \r\n  reporter play it in its entirety. The record reflects the tape was played in \r\n  its entirety, although Cherry now questions the record's accuracy on this point. \r\n  \r\n\r\nCherry argues the court erred in denying his request \r\n  to view the original tape before admitting it into evidence. He maintains its \r\n  admission prejudiced him because it shows \r\n  Officer Parker making other traffic stops which could have biased the jury in \r\n  favor of Officer Parker.  \r\n  (2)\r\n\r\nAlthough the tape depicts events defense counsel \r\n  did not have an opportunity to review prior to trial, we do not find the court \r\n  abused its discretion in admitting it into evidence. Moreover, even though much \r\n  of the tape does not involve Cherry's case and is therefore irrelevant, we believe \r\n  it did not prejudice him. Furthermore, it appears the State only intended to \r\n  play the portion of the tape containing Cherry's arrest. The tape was admitted \r\n  into evidence only after Cherry's counsel suggested it be admitted into evidence \r\n  rather than simply marked for identification. Furthermore, it was then played \r\n  in its entirety only upon his counsel's demand. Cherry will not be heard to \r\n  complain of an error of his own creation. State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, \r\n  455, 385 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1989) (noting a party cannot be heard to complain \r\n  of an error his own conduct induced).\r\n\r\nB. Money Seized from Cherry\r\n\r\nOfficer Parker seized $322 in mostly twenty dollar \r\n  bills from Cherry during his arrest. Cherry attempted to suppress the money \r\n  in a motion in limine, arguing it was irrelevant. The State argued the money \r\n  was relevant to show Cherry intended to sell the crack on his person because \r\n  crack is commonly sold for $20 per rock. The court decided to refrain from ruling \r\n  on the admissibility until after it heard the testimony. When Officer Parker \r\n  began to testify about the money, Cherry objected and the court overruled his \r\n  objection. Cherry now argues that ruling was error.\r\n\r\nWe first address the State's argument that this \r\n  issue is not preserved because Cherry made only a general objection to the officer's \r\n  testimony. In light of his earlier motion in limine, we believe the nature of \r\n  Cherry's objection was contextually apparent and this issue is therefore preserved. \r\n  Rule 103, SCRE (timely objection on a specific ground is necessary if the specific \r\n  ground is not apparent from the context).\r\n\r\nWe do, however, agree with the State that the money \r\n  was properly admitted. Cherry was charged with possession of crack cocaine with \r\n  the intent to distribute. Evidence is relevant, and therefore admissible, when \r\n  it tends to make the existence of a fact in controversy more or less probable \r\n  than it would be without the evidence. Rule 401, SCRE. The money was relevant \r\n  to the contested question of whether Cherry intended to distribute the crack \r\n  rocks in his possession. In light of the officer's testimony regarding the price \r\n  of crack rocks, the $322 in mostly twenties was some indication that Cherry \r\n  had sold crack earlier in the evening and thus, its admission into evidence \r\n  tended to make the allegation he intended to distribute the crack in his watch \r\n  pocket more probable. The money was properly admitted.\r\n\r\nC. Crack Cocaine Seized \r\n  from Cherry\r\n\r\nThe defense also made a motion in limine to suppress \r\n  the crack cocaine Officer Parker found in Cherry's watch pocket, arguing it \r\n  was obtained pursuant to an unlawful search and seizure. Cherry argued the officer \r\n  conducted an improper stop of the vehicle and thus any search of its passengers \r\n  was also improper. After hearing a proffer from the officer, the court ruled \r\n  the drugs were admissible. Cherry now argues the court erred in admitting the \r\n  drugs because Officer Parker's testimony, that he immediately knew upon touching \r\n  the outside of Cherry's watch pocket that it contained narcotics, was not believable \r\n  because he also testified he thought the box of cigars he felt in another of \r\n  Cherry's pockets might be a weapon. Because this argument is different from \r\n  the one Cherry raised to the trial court, it is not preserved for our review. \r\n  State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 113, 485 S.E.2d 360, 363 (1997) (holding \r\n  a party may not assert one ground at trial and another on appeal). \r\n  (3)\r\n\r\nV. Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nCherry argues the trial court improperly refused \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict on the charge of possession with intent to \r\n  distribute because there was no evidence he intended to distribute the crack \r\n  cocaine. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhen considering a motion for a directed verdict \r\n  in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence \r\n  of evidence, not its weight. State&nbsp;v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, \r\n  515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999); State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 411, 319 S.E.2d \r\n  335, 336 (1984). It has been recently held that this remains true even when \r\n  the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence. State v. Mitchell, \r\n  341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000). Some cases have held that if \r\n  the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendant's \r\n  guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, \r\n  the case must go to the jury. Burdette, 335 S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at \r\n  531; State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 493, 431 S.E.2d 254, 255-56 (1993). \r\n  Other cases indicate that where the evidence is circumstantial, there must be \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the \r\n  guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced. \r\n  State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 602, 533 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2000) (citing \r\n  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996)). Still other \r\n  cases indicate some distinction between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence \r\n  in considering whether a directed verdict should be granted. State v. Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. 215, 232, 522 S.E.2d 845, 853 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"If there is any \r\n  direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably \r\n  tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and \r\n  logically deduced, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted \r\n  to the jury.\" (emphasis added)) (citing State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, \r\n  512 S.E.2d 795 (1999)). If the trial court must make a determination that the \r\n  circumstantial evidence is substantial, that would seem to require a weighing \r\n  of the evidence which, of course, all cases agree, is forbidden.\r\n\r\nClearly, the trial judge should grant a directed \r\n  verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused \r\n  is guilty. Martin, 340 S.C. at 602, 533 S.E.2d at 574 (citing State \r\n  v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978)). It is equally clear, however, \r\n  that on appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this court \r\n  must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. Burdette, \r\n  335 S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at 531.\r\n\r\nThe State submitted testimony that Cherry's arrest \r\n  occurred in a high crime area known for violence and drug activity. Cherry had \r\n  a small bag containing approximately eight rocks of crack cocaine on his person. \r\n  He had no crack pipe or other drug paraphernalia with him indicating the crack \r\n  was for his personal consumption. He did, however, have $322 cash on his person \r\n  in mostly twenty dollar bills. Officer Parker testified a single rock of crack \r\n  cocaine is typically sold for twenty dollars. Viewing this evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State, as we must, and without passing on the weight of \r\n  the evidence, the combination of these factors constitutes evidence which would \r\n  reasonably tend to prove Cherry intended to distribute the crack cocaine and, \r\n  thus, justifies the trial court's decision to submit the case to the jury for \r\n  its determination.  \r\n  (4) \r\n\r\nVI. Circumstantial Evidence \r\n  Instruction\r\n\r\nDuring its jury charge, the trial court issued \r\n  the circumstantial evidence instruction recently approved and recommended by \r\n  our supreme court in State&nbsp;v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 \r\n  (1997). After the jury was charged, defense counsel requested the court issue \r\n  Judge Ervin's charge on the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. \r\n  Tom J. Ervin, Ervin's South Carolina Requests to Charge-Criminal Â§ 3-4 \r\n  (1994). The court refused to re-charge the jury as requested.\r\n\r\nWe note that Judge Ervin's model charge on circumstantial \r\n  evidence is similar to the traditional language our supreme court approved in \r\n  State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989). The traditional \r\n  charge distinguishes between direct and circumstantial evidence, whereas the \r\n  new charge adopted in Grippon specifically states there is no legal distinction \r\n  between the two types of evidence. Compare Edwards, 298 S.C. at \r\n  275, 379 S.E.2d at 889 (\"[E]very circumstance relied upon by the State [must] \r\n  be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and . . . all of the circumstances so proven \r\n  be consistent with each other and taken together, point conclusively to the \r\n  guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.\"), \r\n  with Grippon, 327 S.C. at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464 (\"The law makes \r\n  absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either \r\n  direct or circumstantial evidence. Nor is a greater degree of certainty required \r\n  of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence.\"). Although the supreme \r\n  court noted in Grippon, 327 S.C. at 82, 489 S.E.2d at 463, and reiterated \r\n  in State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 156 n.13, 508 S.E.2d 857, 868 n.13 (1998), \r\n  that the traditional Edwards charge is still a legally correct and appropriate \r\n  jury instruction, we cannot fault the trial court for utilizing a charge recently \r\n  specifically approved by the supreme court. It obviously is a correct statement \r\n  of the law of circumstantial evidence. \"The judge properly instructs the jury \r\n  if he adequately states the applicable law. A jury charge which is substantially \r\n  correct and covers the law does not require reversal.\" State v. Ezell, \r\n  321 S.C. 421, 425, 468 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted). We \r\n  find no error.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause all three judges of the panel are in agreement \r\n  on Issues I through IV, two of the three judges of the panel are in agreement \r\n  as to Issue V, and two, albeit different, judges of the panel are in agreement \r\n  on Issue VI, Cherry's conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent \r\n  to distribute is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs in part and dissents \r\n  in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurs in part and dissents \r\n  in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part:  I concur in Parts I through IV of Judge Stilwell's opinion. \r\n  Part V of the opinion involves the sufficiency of the evidence to establish \r\n  an intent to distribute. I do not agree with the majority on this point, and \r\n  respectfully dissent. As to Part VI, I concur, but write separately to address \r\n  Judge Shuler's dissenting opinion. \r\n\r\nPart V - Sufficiency of \r\n  the Evidence\r\n\r\nI conclude the circumstances do not present facts \r\n  from which a jury could reasonably and logically conclude Cherry intended to \r\n  distribute crack cocaine. Therefore, I would rule the trial judge erred in failing \r\n  to grant a directed verdict on this charge.\r\n\r\nIn a case which is based solely upon circumstantial \r\n  evidence, the evidence is not \"substantial\" if the jury must speculate to conclude \r\n  guilt, even though all of the evidence is taken as true. See State \r\n  v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 602, 533 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2000); State v. Mitchell, \r\n  341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000). If the circumstances, alone and \r\n  in combination, are as consistent with innocence as with guilt, then no valid \r\n  conclusion can be drawn from them. See In re Winship, 397 U.S. \r\n  358, 364 (1970) (\"[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction \r\n  except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute \r\n  the crime with which he is charged.\"); see also Jackson v. Virginia, \r\n  443 U.S. 307, 318 (1979) (\"After Winship the critical inquiry on review of the \r\n  sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction must be not simply \r\n  to determine whether the jury was properly instructed, but to determine whether \r\n  the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.\"); Martin, 340 S.C. at 602-03, 533 S.E.2d at 574-75 (holding the \r\n  State failed to meet the \"any substantial evidence\" standard, and motion for \r\n  directed verdict should have been granted where State had no proof either defendant \r\n  held drowning victim's head under water, or that the two acted in concert, and, \r\n  although evidence provided the likely possibility that the defendant's car was \r\n  at the scene of the murder, the vehicle could not be identified with sufficient \r\n  certainty to rule out the alternative possibility that it was merely a similar \r\n  vehicle).\r\n\r\nThe majority identifies the following circumstances \r\n  as the factual basis for denying Cherry's directed verdict on the distribution \r\n  charge:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) Cherry's arrest occurred in a high crime area \r\n    known for violence and drug activity;\r\n\r\n  2) Cherry had a small bag containing approximately \r\n    eight rocks of crack cocaine;\r\n\r\n  3) Cherry had no crack pipe or other drug paraphernalia \r\n    with him indicating the crack was for his personal consumption;\r\n\r\n  4) Cherry had $322 cash on his person, mostly in \r\n    twenty dollar bills; \r\n\r\n  5) Officer Parker testified a single rock of crack \r\n    cocaine is typically sold for twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority does not discuss why the above circumstances \r\n  provide inferences which could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt on the distribution charge. For the following reasons, I \r\n  conclude these circumstances do not provide a factual basis to submit the charge \r\n  of possession with intent to distribute to the jury.\r\n\r\n1) High Crime Area - There is no evidence that \r\n  a person who possesses crack cocaine in a high crime area is more likely to \r\n  distribute the crack cocaine than to purchase it. Indeed, logic defeats the \r\n  conclusion. If there is a greater incidence of street level crack cocaine distribution \r\n  in a high crime area, it is only logical to conclude that a concentrated number \r\n  of drug users are in that area as well. Consequently, this circumstance does \r\n  not provide a logical basis for concluding Cherry intended to distribute the \r\n  crack cocaine, as opposed to using it. For the same reason, this circumstance \r\n  adds nothing to any of the other predicate facts to establish an intent to distribute.\r\n\r\n2) Eight rocks of crack cocaine - The second circumstance \r\n  involves the crack cocaine itself. Cherry had eight rocks of crack cocaine weighing \r\n  less than one gram, contained in one small bag. The crack cocaine was not packaged \r\n  in multiple bags, and unlike State v. Robinson, Op. No. 3287 (S.C. Ct. \r\n  App. filed January 22, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at 73), there was no \r\n  testimony from police officers to establish that drug users typically would \r\n  not possess this much crack cocaine, either by weight or number of individual \r\n  pieces. Furthermore, the significance of possessing multiple rocks is not within \r\n  the common knowledge of jurors. Absent additional evidence, such as multiple \r\n  packaging or supporting testimony from police officers trained or experienced \r\n  in drug enforcement, there is no reasonable inference of intent to distribute \r\n  derived from this evidence which is sufficient to support a finding of guilt \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 2000) (a permissible \r\n  inference of an intent to distribute arises from \"possession of one or more \r\n  grams of . . . cocaine\" (emphasis added)); see also State v. Young, \r\n  99-1264, p.11 (La. Ct. App. 1 Cir. 3/31/00), 764 So. 2d 998, 1006 (holding \"mere \r\n  possession of a drug does not amount to evidence of intent to distribute, unless \r\n  the quantity is so large that no other inference is possible\"); Fox v. Mississippi, \r\n  756 So. 2d 753, 759 (Miss. 2000) (\"When the quantity is such that an individual \r\n  could use it alone, then that quantity is not in and of itself sufficient to \r\n  create an inference of intent [to distribute].\"); State v. Becerra, 817 \r\n  P.2d 1246, 1250 (N.M. Ct. App. 1991) (\"[W]here there was no evidence of the \r\n  concentration of the drug, and no evidence of how long it would normally take \r\n  a single drug user to consume a given quantity, the weight of the amount recovered \r\n  could not in itself enable a fact finder to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, \r\n  that defendant intended to distribute the substance.\").\r\n\r\n3) No visible means of smoking the crack cocaine \r\n  - The third circumstance is the lack of a crack cocaine pipe or other drug paraphernalia \r\n  needed for immediate use, from which the majority implies that Cherry did not \r\n  intend to consume the crack cocaine. An inference can reasonably be drawn that \r\n  Cherry did not intend to immediately use the drug. Thus, if time was \r\n  the issue, that is, immediate use versus use at some later time, this fact would \r\n  be substantial evidence. However, it is insufficient to provide a logical basis \r\n  for concluding it is more likely Cherry intended to distribute the crack cocaine \r\n  than to use it at some future time. At the very most, it is incomplete information, \r\n  because it only proves he had no method for immediate use. Therefore, neither \r\n  a conclusion of intent to distribute nor a conclusion of personal use is reasonably \r\n  premised upon this circumstance.\r\n\r\n4 &amp; 5) $322 in cash and police officer's testimony \r\n  - Lastly, there is the $322 in cash seized from Cherry, coupled with the police \r\n  testimony that crack cocaine is often sold in twenty dollar amounts. The amount \r\n  of money is certainly not noteworthy. See Young, 99-1264, p.13, \r\n  764 So. 2d at 1006 ($370.00 in cash \"[was] not so large that no other inference \r\n  was possible. Accordingly, a rational trier of fact could not have concluded \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that the State proved the 'intent to distribute' element \r\n  of the crime.\" (citation omitted)). Many people carry cash, and many people \r\n  cash their entire paychecks, choosing not to maintain a checking account. Certainly \r\n  the fact of possession of a relatively small amount of currency does not, in \r\n  and of itself, allow an inference of illegal activity.\r\n\r\nThis amount of currency is not consistent with \r\n  the amount related by law enforcement as the value of multiple rocks of crack \r\n  cocaine. There is no testimony that crack cocaine is sold for $2, $12, $22 or \r\n  in any other multiple of two dollars, which would help explain the additional \r\n  $2. Furthermore, twenty dollar bills are not unusual denominations to carry. \r\n  They are the predominant bills used at banks and automatic teller machines for \r\n  cash withdrawals of hundred dollar multiples. To be sure, the money Cherry possessed \r\n  is consistent with a guilty intent to distribute. But it is no less consistent \r\n  with possession for personal use. To base a conclusion on it, then, is to rest \r\n  on pure speculation.\r\n\r\nNone of these circumstances provides a basis for \r\n  reasonably inferring an intent to distribute. (5) \r\n  Furthermore, they are not substantial in combination. As Judge Shuler points \r\n  out in his concurring and dissenting opinion: \r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he use of circumstantial evidence calls on the jury to employ analytical tools in a complex reasoning process not otherwise\r\nneeded when reviewing direct evidence alone.  In so doing, it invites the danger of 'logical gaps' legitimately associated with\r\ncircumstantial evidence - that the jury may surmise guilt from 'subjective inferential links based on probabilities' and thereby\r\nelevate coincidence or suspicion into permissible inference. \r\n\r\n\r\n(citing People v. Cleague, 239 N.E.2d 617, \r\n  619 (N.Y. 1968)). \r\n\r\nI conclude the evidence required the jury to employ this impermissible method of arriving at its determination of guilt.  Each of\r\nthe predicate facts is completely consistent with simple possession of crack cocaine, and they remain consistent with simple\r\npossession in combination.  When added together, it might be said that they more completely tend to prove possession of crack\r\ncocaine, but they do not provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the crack cocaine was possessed with the intent to\r\ndistribute it.\r\n\r\nWhere the amount of drugs is less than the threshold \r\n  amount giving rise to the permissible statutory inference of intent to distribute, \r\n  our courts have required more than mere possession and the general circumstances \r\n  found here as a basis for concluding guilt. \"Possession of any amount \r\n  of controlled substance when coupled with sufficient indica of intent to distribute \r\n  will support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute.\" State \r\n  v. Goldsmith, 301 S.C. 463, 466, 392 S.E.2d 787, 788 (1990); see \r\n  Matthews v. State, 300 S.C. 238, 239, 387 S.E.2d 258, 259 (1990); State \r\n  v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 134, 352 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1987). However, I find \r\n  no cases in South Carolina which have upheld a conviction for possession with \r\n  intent to distribute without some specific indicia of the required intent. See \r\n  State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 57, 451 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1994) ($2,320 in \r\n  cash); Fernandez v.

Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997), as reflected in Judge Shuler's dissent. \r\n  However, I believe we are bound by the majority opinion of our supreme court \r\n  in Grippon. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 9; Daniels v. City of \r\n  Goose Creek, 314 S.C. 494, 501, 431 S.E.2d 256, 260 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nIn Grippon, our supreme court specifically \r\n  approved and recommended a circumstantial evidence charge which omits the phrase \r\n  \"to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis,\" found in State v. \r\n  Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 328, 89 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1955), and State v. \r\n  Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989). See Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464 (recommending in \"a criminal case relying \r\n  in whole or in part on circumstantial evidence\" a charge found in 1 E. Devitt \r\n  &amp; C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions Â§ 12.04 \r\n  (4th ed. 1992)). For that reason, we are required to affirm on this point.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I do not believe the charge on circumstantial evidence, which is in the nature of a burden of proof charge, changes\r\nwith the facts of the case.  For this reason, I do not believe the cases cited by Judge Shuler in support of his position are\r\napplicable in this context.\r\n\r\nThe first three cases, State v. Day, 341 \r\n  S.C. 410, 535 S.E.2d 431 (2000), State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 \r\n  S.E.2d 907 (2000), and Battle v. State, 305 S.C. 460, 409 S.E.2d 400 \r\n  (1991), involve self defense charges. As our case law has recognized, there \r\n  are different legal principles which may apply within the umbrella of this defense, \r\n  depending upon the facts presented. State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 443, \r\n  377 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1989). For example, \"defense of others\" may be factually \r\n  raised in one case, and have no applicability in a case involving an altercation \r\n  solely between the alleged victim and the accused. Although the trial judge \r\n  may be required to charge \"self defense\" in each case, only in the first example \r\n  would the judge be required to charge the law regarding the defense of others.\r\n\r\nBut unlike the legal principles underlying self \r\n  defense, the burden of proof is a structural part of the trial process, Sullivan \r\n  v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 282 (1993); State v. Jefferies, 316 S.C. \r\n  13, 21, 446 S.E.2d 427, 432 (1994), and the minimum Due Process requirements \r\n  remain the same in each criminal case. See Winship, 397 U.S. at \r\n  364.\r\n\r\nThe last two cases cited, State v. Kimbrell, \r\n  294 S.C. 51, 362 S.E.2d 630 (1987) and State v. Brownlee, 318 S.C. 34, \r\n  455 S.E.2d 704 (1995), are also inapplicable, because they deal with a complete \r\n  failure to charge \"mere presence\" in drug cases where the facts required the \r\n  charge.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree with Judge Stilwell's determination \r\n  that the jury charge fully complied with the requirements of South Carolina \r\n  law, as set forth in Grippon. However, there is an absence of any direct or \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove an intent to \r\n  distribute, or from which the intent to distribute crack cocaine can fairly \r\n  and logically be deduced. For this reason, I would reverse the conviction for \r\n  distribution of crack cocaine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part:  While I concur in Parts I through V of Judge Stilwell's thorough \r\n  opinion, I disagree with the conclusion reached in Part VI and therefore respectfully \r\n  dissent. \r\n\r\nThe trial court instructed the jury pursuant to \r\n  State v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 84, 489 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1997) (\"The law \r\n  makes absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either \r\n  direct or circumstantial evidence. Nor is a greater degree of certainty required \r\n  of circumstantial evidence . . . .\"). Upon realizing the court failed to give \r\n  the conventional charge on circumstantial evidence, Cherry's counsel, noting \r\n  that Grippon \"does not preclude a more thorough charge,\" requested further instructions. \r\n  As Judge Stilwell correctly observes, the charge requested is comparable to \r\n  the traditional language enunciated by our supreme court in State v. Littlejohn, \r\n  228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955) and later quoted with approval in State \r\n  v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989) (\"[E]very circumstance \r\n  relied upon by the State [must] be proven beyond a reasonable doubt . . . and \r\n  taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion \r\n  of every other reasonable hypothesis.\"). Because I agree that a fuller Edwards-type \r\n  instruction was both appropriate and warranted under the circumstances, I would \r\n  find the court's failure to so instruct the jury was error. \r\n  (6)\r\n\r\nThere is no question the charging language set \r\n  forth in both Grippon and Edwards is valid. See State \r\n  v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 159 n.13, 508 S.E.2d 857, 870 n.13 (1998) (reaffirming \r\n  the \"well established\" Edwards charge and stating that the court recently \r\n  approved a charge in Grippon \"that makes no distinction between direct \r\n  and circumstantial evidence\"). However, while I concur in the view that the \r\n  law does not discriminate between the relative weight or probative value of \r\n  direct versus circumstantial evidence, I must disagree with Judge Stilwell's \r\n  assertion that the traditional Edwards instruction \"distinguishes\" between \r\n  the two. Edwards, in fact, makes no mention of direct evidence; it merely \r\n  outlines the test which the jury should use in evaluating \r\n  circumstantial evidence. See Littlejohn, 228 S.C. at 328, 89 S.E.2d \r\n  at 926 (describing the charge as the \"test by which circumstantial evidence \r\n  is to be measured by the jury in its deliberations\"). \r\n\r\nIn a criminal case, the test set forth in Edwards \r\n  may be critical to a just resolution because of the nature of circumstantial \r\n  evidence. See Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 \r\n  S.C. 320, 338 n.6, 534 S.E.2d 672, 681 n.6 (2000) (wherein the court, while \r\n  concluding circumstantial and direct evidence are equally valid and convincing, \r\n  recognized that Edwards \"indicates circumstantial evidence requires greater \r\n  scrutiny than direct evidence in a criminal proceeding\"). Unlike direct evidence, \r\n  which the jury may accept or reject on its face, a proper assessment of circumstantial \r\n  evidence requires the jury to decide not only whether the facts and circumstances \r\n  presented are true, but also whether the defendant's guilt logically can be \r\n  inferred. Thus, the use of circumstantial evidence calls on the jury to employ \r\n  analytical tools in a complex reasoning process not otherwise needed when reviewing \r\n  direct evidence alone. In so doing, it also invites the danger of \"logical gaps\" \r\n  legitimately associated with circumstantial evidence--that the jury may surmise \r\n  guilt from \"subjective inferential links based on probabilities\" and thereby \r\n  elevate coincidence or suspicion into permissible inference. People v. Cleague, \r\n  239 N.E.2d 617, 619 (N.Y. 1968). \r\n\r\nThe validity of circumstantial evidence, therefore, \r\n  rests on \"whether common human experience would lead a reasonable man, putting \r\n  his mind to it, to reject or accept the inferences asserted for the established \r\n  facts.\"  People v. Wachowicz, 239 N.E.2d 620, 622 (N.Y. 1968). The problem \r\n  with the charge recommended in Grippon, however, is that it fails to alert the \r\n  jury to the unique nature of circumstantial evidence. (7) \r\n  The Edwards charge, on the other hand, provides a framework for focusing \r\n  the jury's deliberative process in circumstantial evidence cases. \r\n\r\nWithout question, the law to be charged in a particular \r\n  case is determined by the evidence presented at trial. State v. Long, \r\n  325 S.C. 59, 480 S.E.2d 62 (1997); State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 472 \r\n  S.E.2d 241 (1996). Accordingly, it is well settled that a trial court commits \r\n  reversible error when it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised \r\n  by the evidence. See State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d \r\n  104 (1999); State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993). \r\n  As our supreme court has stated, \"[a] request to charge a correct statement \r\n  of the law on an issue raised by the indictment and the evidence presented at \r\n  trial should not be refused.\" State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d \r\n  830, 831 (1989); see also State v. Addison, Op. No. 25217 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed December 11, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 43); State v. Kimbrell, \r\n  294 S.C. 51, 362 S.E.2d 630 (1987). Although the refusal to give a specific \r\n  charge may not be error \"when the given instructions use the proper test \r\n  for determining the issues before the jury,\" State v. Hughey, 339 \r\n  S.C. 439, 452, 529 S.E.2d 721, 728 (2000), such is not the case when the charge \r\n  as given fails to cover the substance of the request. See State v. \r\n  Day, 341 S.C. 410, 535 S.E.2d 431 (2000) (failure to tailor jury instructions \r\n  to adequately reflect facts and theories presented by the defendant constituted \r\n  reversible error); State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000) \r\n  (court must fashion an appropriate charge when defendant requests more than \r\n  the standard self-defense charge and the evidence supports the request); Battle \r\n  v. State, 305 S.C. 460, 409 S.E.2d 400 (1991) (counsel was ineffective in \r\n  failing to request additional jury instructions on self-defense when warranted \r\n  by the evidence, despite fact that judge had instructed jury in accordance with \r\n  prior court-approved self-defense charge); State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. \r\n  440, 377 S.E.2d 328 (1989) (court erred in giving a prior-approved charge exclusively \r\n  without considering the facts and circumstances of the particular case when \r\n  defense counsel repeatedly requested additional charges based in common law); \r\n  State v. Kimbrell, 294 S.C. 51, 362 S.E.2d 630 (1987) (reversing conviction \r\n  for cocaine trafficking where the charge requested was a correct statement of \r\n  the law but charge given did not adequately cover the substance of the request); \r\n  State v. Brownlee, 318 S.C. 34, 38, 455 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (reversing conviction for possession with intent to distribute because, \"although \r\n  the charge as given correctly stated the elements of the offense, it did not \r\n  adequately cover the substance of [the defendant's] request\"). \r\n\r\nHere, the charge requested by Cherry is a correct \r\n  statement of the law on circumstantial evidence. See Needs, 333 \r\n  S.C. at 159 n.13, 508 S.E.2d at 870 n.13; Edwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 \r\n  S.E.2d at 889. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Cherry, \r\n  (8) I believe the jury could have found the sum of the circumstantial \r\n  facts asserted by the State to be as consistent with Cherry's innocence of \r\n  intent to distribute crack cocaine as with his guilt. Hence, I would find \r\n  the unique inferential nature of the circumstances presented in this case justified \r\n  additional instructions to guide the jury in making appropriate logical inferences \r\n  and thus preclude a finding of guilt based on mere probability. See Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. at 87-88, 489 S.E.2d at 466-67 (Toal, J., concurring in result only) \r\n  (In \"clarif[ying] the jury's responsibility to evaluate circumstantial evidence \r\n  carefully,\" the Edwards charge forecloses the possibility that the jury \r\n  \"'may leap logical gaps in the proof offered and draw unwarranted conclusions \r\n  based on probabilities of low degree.'\") (quoting People v. Ford, 488 \r\n  N.E.2d 458, 465 (N.Y. 1985)). \r\n\r\nIt must be noted that nothing in Grippon \r\n  or Needs precludes a trial court from giving the more detailed Edwards \r\n  charge, including the language that all of the circumstances proffered by the \r\n  State must \"point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion \r\n  of every other reasonable hypothesis.\" Edwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 \r\n  S.E.2d at 889. Indeed, in Grippon the court reiterated it has \"never \r\n  rejected the 'reasonable hypothesis' phrase or found [that it] shifted the burden \r\n  of proof\" from the State. Grippon, 327 S.C. at 82, 489 S.E.2d at 462; \r\n  see also State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 279, 468 S.E.2d 76, 80 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996) (approving use of \"reasonable explanation\" phrase). Furthermore, \r\n  continued approval of the Edwards charge is rendered superfluous if the \r\n  charge is not given when necessitated by the factual posture of the case. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs our supreme court has said, \"[t]he purpose of \r\n  a charge is to enlighten the jury. This purpose is accomplished by a statement \r\n  of the law which fits the concrete case . . . .\" State v. Fair, 209 S.C. \r\n  439, 445, 40 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1946) (quoting  State v. DuRant, 87 S.C. \r\n  532, 534, 70 S.E. 306, 307 (1911)). In my view, while the Grippon charge \r\n  \"obviously is a correct statement of the law,\" it does not cover the substance \r\n  of Cherry's requested instruction. It was therefore error to refuse the request. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the court's failure to give the additional \r\n  instruction cannot be considered harmless, because there exists a reasonable \r\n  likelihood the jury was unaware it should acquit if it found the combined circumstances \r\n  relied upon by the State equally susceptible of an inference inconsistent with \r\n  guilt of the crime charged. See, e.g., State v. Jefferies, 316 \r\n  S.C. 13, 22, 446 S.E.2d 427, 432 (1994) (\"In making a harmless error analysis, \r\n  our inquiry is not what would the verdict have been had the jury been given \r\n  the correct charge, but rather did the erroneous charge contribute to the verdict \r\n  rendered.\"). In my opinion, Cherry was prejudiced by the court's refusal to \r\n  give the requested charge, particularly in light of a clearly impermissible \r\n  closing argument wherein the solicitor stated there was evidence Cherry \"had \r\n  already distributed some crack,\" and that there was \"no evidence that he was \r\n  going to use [the crack] personally for himself.\" Accordingly, I would reverse \r\n  the conviction and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n1. Batson v. Kentucky, \r\n  476 U.S. 79 (1986). \r\n2.  The original tape and the \r\n  copy containing only Cherry's arrest which the State provided to defense counsel \r\n  before trial are among the exhibits on file in this case. The original tape \r\n  shows numerous stops Officer Parker made over several days.  \r\n 3.  In any event, this evidence \r\n  was admissible under the \"plain feel doctrine,\" which permits the warrantless \r\n  seizure of items an officer immediately identifies by touch as contraband during \r\n  a pat-down search. See State v. Smith, 329 S.C. 550, 561, 495 \r\n  S.E.2d 798, 804 (Ct. App. 1998) (applying the plain feel doctrine). \r\n4.  We have not factored in \r\n  nor considered the presence of the pistol in the vehicle because the trial judge, \r\n  in analyzing whether to submit the case to the jury, specifically stated that \r\n  he did not consider it in his deliberations. \r\n 5.  As the majority points \r\n  out, the trial judge declined to consider any implications from the presence \r\n  of the weapon, because police attributed it exclusively to Cherry's sister. \r\n  In any event, there was no expert testimony to provide an evidentiary basis \r\n  for inferring an intent to distribute from the presence of the weapon.  \r\n 6.  Judge Howard correctly \r\n  asserts that a charge on the State's burden of proof \"is a structural part of \r\n  the trial process\" which, by constitutional mandate, must remain the same in \r\n  each criminal case. However, I fail to see how a charge on circumstantial evidence \r\n  is \"in the nature of a burden of proof charge.\" In my view, the two are unrelated. \r\n7.  Interestingly, the Grippon \r\n  charge stems from the Supreme Court's decision in Holland v. United States, \r\n  348 U.S. 121 (1954). While it is true that Holland, a tax evasion case \r\n  involving the \"net worth\" method of circumstantial proof, proposed as the \"better \r\n  rule\" the charging language later articulated in Grippon, it was not \r\n  without qualification. Id. at 139. To the contrary, the Holland \r\n  Court referenced the \"great danger\" associated with equivocal circumstantial \r\n  evidence---that once the prosecution established the necessary circumstances \r\n  a jury might assume the inferential crime automatically followed, despite reasonable \r\n  explanations offered by the defense. Id. at 127-28. Accordingly, the \r\n  Court warned that jury charges in such cases \"should be especially clear, including, \r\n  in addition to the formal instructions, a summary of the nature of the [circumstantial \r\n  evidence] method . . . and the inferences available both for and against \r\n  the accused.\" Id. at 129. \r\n8.

Byrd, \r\n  323 S.C. 319, 474 S.E.2d 430 (1996). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3297","title":"Silvester v.

The trial \r\n  court granted the Club's motion to dismiss the action, finding all claims barred \r\n  by the statute of limitations. The Silvesters appeal. We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1983, the Silvesters purchased a residence in \r\n  Spring Valley subdivision. The rear of their lot adjoins a portion of the Club's \r\n  golf course. Water from the Club's land channels onto the Silvesters' lot, allegedly \r\n  causing erosion, the deposit of trash, and a potentially hazardous condition \r\n  due to standing water. The Silvesters maintain this water channels through a \r\n  man-made ditch, while the Club argues the water channels through a naturally \r\n  occurring stream. The problem manifested itself shortly after the Silvesters \r\n  occupied the house in 1984. \r\n\r\nThe Silvesters brought this action in April 1996. \r\n  They alleged for a first cause of action a trespass occurring in 1992 when the \r\n  Club constructed a french drainage system to collect and concentrate surface \r\n  water, thereby exacerbating the Silvesters' drainage problem. They complain \r\n  the Club failed to implement a proper storm drainage system to prevent water \r\n  from taking over their property. The Silvesters argue that even if the Club \r\n  has an easement to discharge storm water over their land, it has exceeded its \r\n  rights. For their second cause of action, the Silvesters allege the Club's actions \r\n  constitute a continuing nuisance affecting the enjoyment of their land. \r\n\r\nOn June 12, 1998, the Club filed a motion to dismiss \r\n  the action \"pursuant to Rules 41 and/or 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure.\" In its supporting memorandum, the Club argued the statute of limitations \r\n  had expired. \r\n\r\nThe action was called to trial on June 17, 1998, \r\n  with the Silvesters proceeding pro se. Prior to selecting a jury, the \r\n  court heard the Club's motion to dismiss. During argument on the motion, Mr. \r\n  Silvester admitted they realized the severity of the water problem by 1991. \r\n  Mr. Silvester informed the court they received a copy of an engineering study \r\n  commissioned by the Club in October or November 1991, but the Silvesters insisted \r\n  the Club did not follow its own study's recommendations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Silvester argued the action should not be \r\n  dismissed based on the statute of limitations because it was an ongoing nuisance. \r\n  She stated if the court dismissed the action, the Silvesters would have to file \r\n  a new action for the continuing nuisance. The trial judge stated, \"You might \r\n  have to do that.\" During the colloquy, the trial judge made some remarks which \r\n  the Silvesters interpreted as being antagonistic toward them as pro se  \r\n  litigants. (1)\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted the motion to dismiss based \r\n  on the statute of limitations. The Silvesters appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Club filed the motion to dismiss pursuant to \r\n  Rules 41(b) and 56, SCRCP. Rule 41(b) permits the defendant, &quot;[a]fter \r\n  the plaintiff in an action tried by the court without a jury  has completed \r\n  the presentation of his evidence,\" to move for a dismissal on the ground that \r\n  upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. Rule \r\n  41(b), SCRCP (emphasis added); see Johnson&nbsp;v. J.P. Stevens &amp; \r\n  Co., 308 S.C. 116, 118, 417 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1992) (holding Rule 41(b), \r\n  SCRCP, allows the judge as the trier of facts to weigh the evidence, determine \r\n  the facts, and render a judgment against the plaintiff at the close of his case \r\n  if justified).\r\n\r\nRule 56, SCRCP, allows a party to move, with or \r\n  without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment in his favor. Under the \r\n  circumstances present here, we conclude the trial court effectively ruled on \r\n  the motion as if it were a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56. Accordingly, \r\n  we utilize the standard of review governing motions for summary judgment. See \r\n  McDonnell&nbsp;v. Consol. Sch. Dist. of Aiken, 315 S.C. 487, 489, 445 \r\n  S.E.2d 638, 639 (1994) (holding a motion for summary judgment can be used to \r\n  raise the defense of statute of limitations).\r\n\r\nIn determining whether summary judgment is proper, \r\n  this court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party. Barr v. City of Rock Hill, 330 S.C. 640, 642, 500 S.E.2d 157, \r\n  158 (Ct. App. 1998). Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there \r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. City of Columbia v. ACLU of South Carolina, 323 S.C. \r\n  384, 386, 475 S.E.2d 747, 748 (1996). In determining whether any triable issues \r\n  of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn \r\n  from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party. Id. Thus, we review the record in the light most favorable to \r\n  the Silvesters.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. \r\n\r\nTrespass\r\n\r\nThe Silvesters pled trespass as the first cause of \r\naction in their complaint. However, at the hearing before the trial court, the \r\ncontinuing nuisance claim was the only issue clearly addressed. Additionally, \r\nthe Silvesters' appellate brief does not raise as an issue on appeal error on \r\nthe part of the trial court in granting summary judgment as to the trespass cause \r\nof action. Finally, at oral argument the Silvesters only argued the trial court \r\nerred in granting summary judgment to the Club on their continuing nuisance claim. \r\nWe therefore find the grant of summary judgment to the Club on the trespass cause \r\nof action is not presented to this court as an issue appropriate for appellate \r\nreview. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (stating \"[o]rdinarily, no point will \r\nbe considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal\"); \r\nsee Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 443-44, \r\n531 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting an issue not raised to and ruled upon \r\nby the trial court is not preserved for appellate review). \r\nII. \r\n\r\nNuisance\r\n\r\nThe Silvesters contend the trial court erred in \r\n  granting the Club summary judgment on their continuing nuisance cause of action. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina follows the common enemy rule which \r\n  allows a landowner to treat surface water as a common enemy and dispose of it \r\n  as he sees fit. Glenn v. Sch. Dist. No. Five of Anderson County, 294 \r\n  S.C. 530, 533, 366 S.E.2d 47, 49 (Ct. App. 1988). However, an exception to this \r\n  rule prohibits a landowner from using his land in such a manner as to create \r\n  a nuisance. Id.; see Irwin v. Michelin Tire Corp., 288 S.C. 221, \r\n  224, 341 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1986).\r\n\r\nThe traditional concept of a nuisance requires \r\n  a landowner to demonstrate that the defendant unreasonably interfered with his \r\n  ownership or possession of the land. See Ravan v. Greenville County, \r\n  315 S.C. 447, 464, 434 S.E.2d 296, 306 (Ct. App. 1993). The distinction between \r\n  trespass and nuisance is that trespass is any intentional invasion of the plaintiff's \r\n  interest in the exclusive possession of his property, whereas nuisance is a \r\n  substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment \r\n  of his property. Id. \r\n\r\nA nuisance may be classified as permanent or continuing \r\n  in nature. A continuing nuisance is defined as a nuisance that is intermittent \r\n  or periodical and is described as one which occurs so often that it is said \r\n  to be continuing although it is not necessarily constant or unceasing. 58 Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 28 (1989). A permanent nuisance may be expected to \r\n  continue but is presumed to continue permanently, with no possibility of abatement. \r\n  Id. Â§ 27. As to a permanent nuisance, such as a building or a railroad encroaching \r\n  on a party's land, the injury is fixed and goes to the whole value of the land. \r\n  Id.\r\n\r\nWhen the statute of limitations begins to run hinges \r\n  on whether a nuisance is classified as permanent or continuing. Id. Â§ \r\n  26; see Glenn, 294 S.C. at 535-36, 366 S.E.2d at 50-51. When the \r\n  nuisance is permanent in nature and only one cause of action may be brought \r\n  for damages, the applicable statute of limitations bars the action if not brought \r\n  within the statutory period after the first actionable injury. 58 Am. Jur. 2d \r\n  Nuisances Â§ 307 (1989). When the nuisance is continuing and the injury \r\n  is abatable, the statute of limitations does not run merely from the original \r\n  intrusion on the property and cannot be a complete bar. Id. Rather, a \r\n  new statute of limitations begins to run after each separate invasion of the \r\n  property. Id.; see Cutchin v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways \r\n  &amp; Pub. Transp., 301 S.C. 35, 37, 389 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1990) (citing \r\n  Webb v. Greenwood County, 229 S.C. 267, 277, 92 S.E.2d 688, 692 (1956) \r\n  (stating if the injury is permanent, the plaintiff has a single cause of action \r\n  which cannot be split; however if the cause of the injury is abatable, each \r\n  injury gives rise to a new cause of action)). A nuisance is continuing if abatement \r\n  is reasonably and practicably possible. 58 Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 29 \r\n  (1989).\r\n\r\nIn discussing the limitations period applicable \r\n  in a continuing nuisance action, our supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Since every continuance of a nuisance is a new \r\n    nuisance, authorizing a fresh action, an action may be brought, for the recovery \r\n    of all damages, resulting from the continuance of a nuisance, within the statutory \r\n    period of the statute of limitations, for which no previous recovery has been \r\n    had, even though the original cause of action is barred, unless the nuisance \r\n    has been so long continued, as to raise the presumption of a grant, or in \r\n    case of injury to real property, unless the plaintiff's right of entry is \r\n    barred. But when the injury is of such a nature, that all the damages resulting \r\n    therefrom, whether past or prospective, are recoverable in one action, the \r\n    statute of limitations begins to run, from the time of the completed erection \r\n    of the nuisance. This rule, however, is subject to the modification, that \r\n    when the cause of action is the consequential injury, from an act of erection \r\n    which is not, in itself, an actionable nuisance, the statute does not begin \r\n    to run, until the injury is actually inflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSutton v. Catawba Power Co., 104 S.C. 405, \r\n  408, 89 S.E. 353, 353 (1916).\r\n\r\nIn McCurley v. South Carolina Highway Dep't, \r\n  the court stated that if the injury to neighboring lands is caused by negligence, \r\n  or if the cause is abatable, then there arises a continuing cause of action. \r\n  256 S.C. 332, 335, 182 S.E.2d 299, 300 (1971). While the statute of limitations \r\n  begins to run at the occurrence of the first actual damage, the landowner may \r\n  at any time recover for injury which occurred within the statutory period. Id. \r\n  Furthermore, although the statute of limitations may bar a nuisance action for \r\n  damages, it \"is not a defense in an action based upon nuisance for injunctive \r\n  relief since such statutes do not bar the equitable relief of injunction.\" 58 \r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 381 (1989); see Mack v. Edens, \r\n  306 S.C. 433, 437, 412 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 1991) (stating injunctive relief \r\n  is appropriate for continuous injury to land).\r\n\r\nThe Silvesters argue water channels from a man-made \r\n  ditch dug by the Club onto their property. The Club maintains water channeling \r\n  through a naturally occurring stream passes over a portion of the Silvesters' \r\n  lot and only \"occasionally\" overflows their yard. However, Mr. Silvester testified \r\n  at the hearing \"there was an enormous amount of water coming through the property,\" \r\n  and Mrs. Silvester stated \"our property daily is being damaged.\" After reviewing \r\n  the record, we find there exist genuine issues of material fact making summary \r\n  judgment inappropriate in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Silvesters alleged a continuing nuisance and \r\n  requested damages and injunctive relief. The trial court summarily applied the \r\n  three year statute of limitations to the continuing nuisance cause of action \r\n  without considering the possibility of abatement, the Club's alleged negligence, \r\n  or the Silvesters' request for injunctive relief. Viewing the evidence in the \r\n  light most favorable to the Silvesters, we agree the trial court erred in applying \r\n  the statute of limitations to their continuing nuisance claim and accordingly \r\n  reverse the grant of summary judgment on this issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n    III.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bias\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silvesters lastly argue the trial court erred \r\n  in granting the Club relief due to his personal bias against pro se  \r\n  litigants. This argument is without merit. \"Adverse rulings, even if erroneous, \r\n  are insufficient to establish a trial judge's bias or prejudice.\" Reading \r\n  v. Ball, 291 S.C. 492, 494, 354 S.E.2d 397, 398 (Ct. App. 1987). In support \r\n  of their argument, the Silvesters rely on the trial judge's comments at the \r\n  conclusion of the hearing regarding his advice they obtain an attorney. The \r\n  trial judge merely related the old adage that \"the man who is his own lawyer \r\n  has a fool for a client.\" State v. Owens, 124 S.C. 220, 223, 117 S.E. \r\n  536, 537 (1922). We find no evidence in the record the trial judge's ruling \r\n  was based on or influenced by any bias against either the Silvesters or pro \r\n  se  litigants as a class.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order on appeal is \r\n  affirmed as to the dismissal of the trespass cause of action and reversed and \r\n  remanded as to the nuisance cause of action.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND \r\n  REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur. \r\n1.  During the colloquy the \r\n  trial judge said:\r\n\r\nMrs. Silvester, let me say something. . . . If \r\n  you don't want to hire a lawyer, that's fine. But let me tell you what Abraham \r\n  Lincoln said one time. A man who represents himself has a fool for a lawyer. \r\n  That was in my Daddy's law office when I was a kid. It's great advice.

Lockridge was not entitled to \r\n  benefits, concluding his heart attack was not an injury by accident arising \r\n  out of and in the course of his employment. Lockridge appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BACKGROUND  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 1994, Santens of America, a manufacturer \r\n  of towels, hired Lockridge as a lead man on the weekend shift. A lead man is \r\n  responsible for mixing dyes and chemicals and operating the dye machine. Operating \r\n  the dye machine requires the lead man to lift buckets and bags weighing fifty \r\n  to fifty-five pounds each.\r\n\r\nIn November 1994, Lockridge experienced heart problems \r\n  requiring angioplasty. By December 1994, Lockridge had returned to work as a \r\n  lead man on the weekend shift. Between January and June of 1995, the plant closed \r\n  eleven weeks due to a slowdown in production. In July 1995, Lockridge was promoted \r\n  to department head of the dyehouse, a weekday job that also required him to \r\n  report to work on Saturday. In this position, Lockridge supervised the lead \r\n  men, performed inventory counts, and checked the dye colors. Lockridge's job \r\n  essentially consisted of office work, and he no longer lifted buckets and bags \r\n  of chemicals. \r\n\r\nOn October 14, 1995, Lockridge planned to go to \r\n  the plant for a shift change and to check the dye. The lead man scheduled for \r\n  the 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift could not work, and Lockridge was unable \r\n  to get a replacement lead man to report until 3:00 p.m. Lockridge had decided \r\n  to close down the dyeing operation between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., but the \r\n  plant manager persuaded Lockridge to fill in as the lead man during that time \r\n  frame. \r\n\r\nLockridge worked the four hour shift for the dyeing \r\n  operation utilizing four vats and two dryers. When Lockridge worked as a lead \r\n  man prior to his promotion, he operated only three vats and one dryer. Lockridge \r\n  lifted between 1600 and 3000 pounds of chemicals during the shift.\r\n\r\nAs he worked, Lockridge became extremely tired, \r\n  began sweating, and developed pain in his neck and jaw. He also experienced \r\n  shortness of breath and soreness between his shoulders. Although Lockridge originally \r\n  intended to stay at the plant until 5:00 p.m., the onset of these symptoms caused \r\n  him to return home as soon as the replacement lead man arrived at 3:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nThroughout the evening, Lockridge continued to \r\n  experience symptoms and eventually was transported to the emergency room at \r\n  Anderson Area Medical Center where he was diagnosed as having sustained a heart \r\n  attack. Lockridge was then transferred to Greenville Memorial Hospital where \r\n  he underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery. Lockridge was fifty-eight years \r\n  old at the time of the heart attack.\r\n\r\nFollowing his operation, Lockridge returned to \r\n  work at Santens in various capacities but was terminated in December 1996 for \r\n  reasons not involved here and has not been employed since. \r\n\r\nIn denying Lockridge's claim, the single commissioner \r\n  concluded he did not suffer an injury by accident arising out of and in the \r\n  course of employment. Moreover, the commissioner found Lockridge's heart attack \r\n  was not caused or induced by unexpected strain or overexertion in the performance \r\n  of his job duties or by unusual or extraordinary conditions in his employment \r\n  on October&nbsp;14, 1995. The full commission determined that all of the single \r\n  commissioner's findings of fact and rulings of law were correct as stated, affirmed \r\n  the hearing commissioner, and adopted his decision as its own. The circuit court \r\n  affirmed the full commission. \r\n\r\n\r\n    SCOPE OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the \r\n  standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation \r\n  Commission. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 \r\n  (1981). Any review of the commission's factual findings is governed by the substantial \r\n  evidence standard. Smith v. Squires Timber Co., 311 S.C. 321, 325, 428 \r\n  S.E.2d 878, 880 (1993). The \"possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions \r\n  from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being \r\n  supported by substantial evidence.\" Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). Substantial \r\n  evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached. Miller \r\n  v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994); \r\n  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 178, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, neither this court nor the circuit \r\n  court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of \r\n  the evidence on questions of fact but may reverse if the decision is affected \r\n  by an error of law. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2000); \r\n  Gibson v. Florence Country Club, 282 S.C. 384, 386, 318 S.E.2d 365, 367 \r\n  (1984); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 516, 526 \r\n  S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ct. App. 2000). See also Oglesby v. Greenville YWCA, \r\n  250 S.C. 490, 494, 158 S.E.2d 907, 909 (1968) (\"Under our workmen's compensation \r\n  law the Commission sits in lieu of a jury and neither the Circuit Court nor \r\n  this Court may interfere with its findings of fact unless there is an absence \r\n  of evidence to sustain the findings of the Commission.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Expert Medical Testimony  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nA. Testimony of Dr. Gaucher\r\n\r\nLockridge argues the commission erred by misconstruing \r\n  Dr. Jay Gaucher's deposition testimony as to the cause of Lockridge's heart \r\n  attack. We disagree. \r\n\r\nDoctor Gaucher, a cardiologist, first treated Lockridge \r\n  for the heart attack on October 18, 1995. Doctor Gaucher testified that, according \r\n  to a cardiac catheterization report on Lockridge when he was treated at Anderson \r\n  Area Medical Center, Lockridge had multi-vessel heart disease with total occlusion \r\n  of his left anterior descending artery and a ninety-nine percent blockage in \r\n  his right coronary artery with angiographic evidence of ruptured plaque in that \r\n  artery. Doctor Gaucher explained that plaque is cholesterol and when it ruptures \r\n  or cracks, the plaque causes clots to form in the artery which, in turn, gives \r\n  rise to heart attacks. Doctor Gaucher testified the plaque rupture likely occurred \r\n  at the time of the onset of Lockridge's symptoms. \r\n\r\nDuring direct examination regarding causation, \r\n  Dr. Gaucher testified that the direct cause of Lockridge's heart attack was \r\n  plaque rupture in the right coronary artery. In response to the inquiry if he \r\n  had an opinion whether the plaque rupture was induced or caused by unexpected \r\n  strain or overexertion in Lockridge's job, Dr. Gaucher answered:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Well, I don't - All I can say is that plaque rupture \r\n    is very unpredictable. Coronary artery disease is a chronic condition and \r\n    very unpredictable. Plaque rupture can occur at any time. In fact it quite \r\n    often happens at rest, most commonly in the early morning hours, and I don't \r\n    think that we really understand or know the precipitance of plaque rupture. \r\n    But it's a chronic . . . disease, and, and it's unpredictable and plaque rupture \r\n    can occur. So I, I don't know if there's a direct - I don't, don't know if \r\n    a direct implication can be made with any certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon further questioning as to whether a causal \r\n  connection existed between Lockridge's employment and the heart attack, Dr. \r\n  Gaucher responded:\r\n\r\n\r\n  So I did not question [Lockridge] about the - his \r\n    activities at the time of his symptoms and so forth. So it's in some ways \r\n    maybe a little bit unfair to ask me that particular question. But what I know, \r\n    again, from heart disease is that plaque rupture is unpredictable and can \r\n    occur at any time, and we don't know the precipitance or understand the precipitance. \r\n    Heart attacks most often occur without physical exertion. \r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Gaucher concluded by unequivocally stating \r\n  that he could not give an opinion with any degree of medical certainty because \r\n  of the unpredictable nature of the process. \r\n\r\nLockridge argues the inference to be drawn from \r\n  Dr. Gaucher's testimony is Lockridge's heart attack directly resulted from a \r\n  plaque rupture which occurred when he began experiencing symptoms while overexerting \r\n  himself in working as a lead man. However, the single commissioner concluded \r\n  otherwise, summarizing \"Dr. Gaucher testified that he could not say within a \r\n  reasonable degree of medical certainty that [Lockridge's] heart attack was causally \r\n  related to the physical activity engaged in by [Lockridge] on October 14, 1995.\" \r\n  The full commission adopted the findings of the commissioner. \r\n\r\nB. Testimony of Dr. Walker\r\n\r\nLockridge relies on the deposition testimony of \r\n  Dr. William Walker in arguing there is no substantial evidence in the record \r\n  to support the commission's findings regarding causation. Doctor Walker, a pulmonary \r\n  internist, first treated Lockridge in 1989 for a physical examination and each \r\n  year thereafter for several years. Doctor Walker's partner, Dr. Samuel Burnett, \r\n  admitted Lockridge to the hospital for the October 1995 heart attack. During \r\n  direct examination regarding the cause of Lockridge's heart attack, Dr. Walker \r\n  testified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n        Attorney:\r\n         Alright (sic), sir. Based on \r\n          the patient's history that he gave you, are you aware of the case of \r\n          the cause of the heart attack which he had on October 15th of '95?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Walker:&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n           I heard that it had to do with something about \r\n            his job, that he was doing something different. He was home and they \r\n            called him in. He had to do something he wasn't used to or something. \r\n            And he tried to help them out and he didn't do well after that.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Attorney:\r\n         Was that information related \r\n          to you by Mr. Lockridge?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Walker: \r\n         Yes. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThereafter, in response to a hypothetical question \r\n  posed by Lockridge's attorney, which was objected to by Santens' attorney, Dr. \r\n  Walker stated he \"would think\" to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that \r\n  Lockridge's heart attack was causally related to Lockridge lifting the bags \r\n  of chemicals. \r\n\r\nLockridge argues Dr. Walker's testimony is uncontradicted \r\n  and, therefore, the commission erred in concluding the heart attack was not \r\n  caused by Lockridge's physical exertions on the job. We disagree. \r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Walker may have attributed the cause \r\n  of Lockridge's heart attack to overexertion at work, Dr. Gaucher either would \r\n  not or could not. Thus, to the extent Dr. Gaucher's testimony contradicts Dr. \r\n  Walker's testimony, the commission was free to weigh the conflicting evidence \r\n  accordingly. Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  102, 105 (1999) (\"Where there is a conflict in the evidence, the Commission's \r\n  findings of fact are conclusive.\"); see also Stokes v. First Nat'l \r\n  Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1991) (acknowledging that despite \r\n  conflicting evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same witness, \r\n  a finding of fact by the commission is conclusive). The final determination \r\n  of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to \r\n  the full commission, and it is not the task of the court to weigh the evidence \r\n  as found by the commission. Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105; \r\n  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 282, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999). Furthermore, \"[e]xpert medical testimony is designed to aid the \r\n  Commission in coming to the correct conclusion; therefore, the Commission determines \r\n  the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony. Once admitted, expert \r\n  testimony is to be considered just like any other testimony.\" Tiller v. Nat'l \r\n  Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999) \r\n  (citations omitted). Given the conflicting testimony as to the precipitation \r\n  of Lockridge's heart attack and our scope of review, we find substantial evidence \r\n  in the record to support the commission's findings regarding causation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Lockridge's Job Responsibilities  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nLockridge also contends the commission erred in \r\n  finding part of Lockridge's job responsibilities as department head included \r\n  filling in for an absent lead man. We disagree. \r\n\r\nLockridge testified that after his promotion to \r\n  department head, he was no longer routinely required to lift the buckets and \r\n  bags of chemicals. Moreover, he testified he could not remember the former department \r\n  head ever filling in for a lead man. In fact, Lockridge stated the plant closed \r\n  down on occasions when a lead man was not present. However, he also testified \r\n  that as department head he was expected to fill in for an absent lead man. \r\n\r\nJohn Williams, Lockridge's successor as department \r\n  head, testified that at the time of Lockridge's heart attack in 1995, the department \r\n  head was expected to fill in for an absent lead man. He also stated that he \r\n  had filled in for absent lead men, and it was an ordinary part of the department \r\n  head's job. Williams did admit he could not remember Lockridge ever having to \r\n  lift anything between the time he became department head until the day of his \r\n  heart attack. \r\n\r\nBased on the evidence presented regarding Lockridge's \r\n  job history, the commissioner concluded the work Lockridge was performing at \r\n  the time of his heart attack was \"neither unusual in light of his regular job \r\n  duties or extraordinary.\" The full commission adopted these findings. \r\n\r\nAs previously stated, our review of the commission's \r\n  factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard. Smith, \r\n  311 S.C. at 325, 428 S.E.2d at 880. Where there is conflicting testimony, the \r\n  commission's findings of fact are conclusive. Brayboy v. Clark Heating Co., \r\n  306 S.C. 56, 58, 409 S.E.2d 767, 768 (1991). Accordingly, we find no error in \r\n  the commission's finding that Lockridge's ordinary job responsibilities included \r\n  filling in for an absent lead man.\r\n\r\nLockridge also argues the commission erred in holding \r\n  that under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2000), and case law, the test for \r\n  compensability due to heart attacks caused by unexpected strain or overexertion \r\n  or by unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment is based on the responsibility \r\n  of an employee, rather than the physical effort the employee generally performs. \r\n  Lockridge contends even if the test is based on an employee's responsibilities, \r\n  the commission erred in failing to recognize Lockridge met the test. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe general rule is that a heart attack is compensable \r\n  as a worker's compensation accident if it is induced by unexpected strain or \r\n  overexertion in the performance of the duties of claimant's employment or by \r\n  unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment. Hoxit v. Michelin Tire \r\n  Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 464, 405 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1991). Various extreme conditions \r\n  have been considered sufficient to support a finding that an accident resulted \r\n  from unexpected strain or overexertion or from unusual and extraordinary conditions \r\n  of employment. See, e.g., Stokes, 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 \r\n  (extreme increase in work hours coupled with increased responsibilities resulting \r\n  in nervous breakdown); Powell v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299 S.C. 325, \r\n  384 S.E.2d 725 (1989) (unexpected, serious altercation with employee's supervisor \r\n  resulting in mental disorder); Holley v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., \r\n  301 S.C. 519, 392 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. 1990) (climb of an eighty-seven foot \r\n  ladder in extreme heat resulting in heart attack).\r\n\r\nHowever, where a claimant cannot prove the heart \r\n  attack was induced by unexpected strain or overexertion in the performance of \r\n  employment duties or by unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment, \r\n  there is no injury by accident compensable under section 42-1-160. See \r\n  Hoxit, 304 S.C. at 464-65, 405 S.E.2d at 409 (applying the substantial \r\n  evidence standard of review in affirming the commission's factual finding that \r\n  a claimant's heart attack was not compensable since it did not result from unexpected \r\n  strain or overexertion or unusual and extraordinary conditions of his employment); \r\n  Jennings v. Chambers Dev. Co., 335 S.C. at 258-59, 516 S.E.2d at 458-59 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999) (upholding the commission's factual finding that a claimant's \r\n  ruptured aneurysm was not a work-related injury where there was no evidence \r\n  anything unusual or unexpected, requiring abnormal exertion, occurred on the \r\n  day of employee's death).\r\n\r\nLockridge cites several cases in his brief in support \r\n  of his argument that the case law draws a distinction between the physical effort \r\n  the employee generally performs and the employee's usual job responsibility \r\n  when examining what is an unexpected strain or unusual and extraordinary conditions \r\n  of employment resulting in a heart attack. (1) \r\n  However, the cases on which Lockridge relies do not seem to draw such a fine \r\n  distinction. Instead, these cases suggest that our standard of review governs \r\n  the outcome on appeal of these factually driven cases. \r\n   (2)\r\n\r\nThere is conflicting evidence in the record as \r\n  to Lockridge's responsibility in filling in for an absent lead man. Moreover, \r\n  the testimony of Dr. Gaucher and Dr. Walker conflicts as to whether Lockridge's \r\n  heart attack resulted from unexpected strain or overexertion or from unusual \r\n  and extraordinary conditions of employment. In resolving these factual issues, \r\n  the commissioner concluded Lockridge's \"heart attack was not caused or induced \r\n  by unexpected strain or overexertion in the performance of [his] duties of his \r\n  employment [n]or by unusual and extraordinary conditions in the employment . \r\n  . . .\" The commission adopted the commissioner's findings. Where there is a \r\n  conflict in the evidence, the commission's findings of fact are conclusive. \r\n  Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105; Hoxit, 304 S.C. at \r\n  465, 405 S.E.2d at 409. There is substantial evidence in the record to support \r\n  the commission's findings. Accordingly, the order of the circuit court order \r\n  is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, J.J., concur. \r\n1.  In support of his argument, \r\n  Lockridge relies on Canady v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 265 S.C. \r\n  21, 216 S.E.2d 755 (1975) (affirming full commission's factual finding that \r\n  an employee, who had been required to work two nights a week in addition to \r\n  his normal janitorial duties, had suffered a heart attack that was induced by \r\n  unexpected strain and overexertion in the performance of his employment duties); \r\n  McWhorter v. South Carolina Dep't of Ins., 252 S.C. 90, 165 S.E.2d 365 \r\n  (1969) (affirming full commission's factual finding that an employee, who experienced \r\n  an extreme increase in work hours, great mental stress, lack of sleep, time \r\n  pressure and physical exertion on the job, had suffered a heart attack that \r\n  was induced by overexertion in the performance of his duties due to unusual \r\n  or extraordinary conditions in his employment); Ricker v. Village Mgmt. Corp., \r\n  231 S.C. 47, 97 S.E.2d 83 (1957) (affirming the full commission's factual finding \r\n  that an employee, a bus driver who experienced considerable physical strain \r\n  in making a sharp turn during heavy traffic on a hot day, had experienced unusual \r\n  exertion or strain during the course of his employment, which aggravated the \r\n  employee's heart condition and resulted in a heart attack).  \r\n2.

The trial court granted \r\nsummary judgment to Jefferson Pilot Fire and Casualty Company (Jefferson Pilot) \r\nand a directed verdict to South Carolina Property and Casualty Guaranty Association \r\n(Guaranty Association) and State Farm Insurance Company (State Farm). Richard \r\nScott Yensen and Michael Price Barnhill appeal. We affirm with respect to Jefferson \r\nPilot and State Farm, and reverse and remand with respect to Guaranty Association. \r\n\r\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 1991, Yensen's Camaro became disabled \r\n  on Interstate 26 in Charleston County. The Camaro was on the shoulder of the \r\n  highway. Yensen walked to a pay phone and called the highway patrol. Yensen \r\n  was picked up by Officer Barnhill.\r\n\r\nYensen and Barnhill returned to Yensen's car. Barnhill \r\n  parked his patrol car behind the Camaro and summoned a tow truck. A flatbed \r\n  wrecker belonging to Specialty Towing arrived, and the driver of the wrecker \r\n  parked in front of the Camaro to hook it up for towing. Yensen and Barnhill \r\n  exited the patrol car and stood beside the driver's side of the Camaro while \r\n  the tow truck driver hooked chains to it.\r\n\r\nTheodore Huttner was driving a Chevrolet Beretta \r\n  on Interstate 26 traveling toward Charleston. Huttner struck Yensen, Barnhill, \r\n  and the tow truck driver, injuring them. Huttner did not stop, but was apprehended \r\n  nearby after he ran off the road. The Beretta was owned by Huttner's employer, \r\n  Jackie Cooper Ford Inc. (Jackie Cooper). Yensen and Barnhill subsequently filed \r\n  negligence actions against Huttner. Yensen received a $900,000 verdict and Barnhill \r\n  received an $85,000 verdict.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the accident, Specialty Towing was \r\n  insured by Jefferson Pilot. Huttner owned a motorcycle and a van which were \r\n  insured by State Farm. Jackie Cooper was insured by First Southern Insurance \r\n  Company. (1) The trial judge granted summary \r\n  judgment to Jefferson Pilot and directed verdicts in favor of State Farm and \r\n  Guaranty Association.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Jefferson Pilot\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending upon whether or not Huttner was a permissive \r\n  driver of the Beretta, Yensen and Barnhill assert they are entitled to either \r\n  uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage as insureds under the Jefferson \r\n  Pilot policy. The policy provided both uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  of $300,000 to Specialty Towing. The policy defined \"insured\" as \"anyone else \r\n  'occupying' a covered auto.\" According to the policy, \"occupying\" was defined \r\n  as \"in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Jefferson Pilot.  The court concluded neither Yensen nor Barnhill was an insured\r\nunder the policy because neither was \"occupying\" the tow  truck as defined by the policy.  Yensen and Barnhill argue the trial\r\ncourt erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment to Jefferson Pilot because they were  involved with the tow truck\r\nat the scene and were injured as a result of its  \"use.\"\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining whether any triable issue \r\n  of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences \r\n  which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party. Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, \r\n  340 S.C. 29, 530 S.E.2d 369 (2000). Summary judgment is not appropriate where \r\n  further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application \r\n  of the law. At the summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not \r\n  weigh conflicting evidence with respect to a disputed material fact. ML-Lee \r\n  Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 320 S.C. 143, 463 S.E.2d \r\n  618 (Ct. App. 1995), rev'd in part on other grounds, 327 S.C. 238, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 470 (1997). An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment \r\n  under the same standard applied by the trial court. Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary \r\n  Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000).\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to them, Officer Barnhill and Yensen were sitting in Barnhill's patrol car preparing \r\n  an accident report for Yensen's Camaro when the tow truck arrived. The tow truck \r\n  driver began hooking chains to Yensen's Camaro. Barnhill advised Yensen to retrieve \r\n  his personal items from the car before it was lifted onto the tow truck. Both \r\n  Barnhill and Yensen exited the patrol car and went to the driver's side of the \r\n  Camaro. They were standing on the driver's side near the rear view mirror when \r\n  Huttner struck them. In his deposition, Yensen testified he had called a friend \r\n  to come pick him up. However, he also testified that he was planning to leave \r\n  the scene with the tow truck driver. It is this testimony which Yensen asserts \r\n  constitutes a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to survive summary judgment. \r\n  Barnhill's position is that because he was acting in his official capacity of \r\n  supervising the attachment of the Camaro to the tow truck, he was \"occupying\" \r\n  the tow truck. We disagree with both assertions.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge correctly determined that Yensen \r\n  and Barnhill were not insureds under the Jefferson Pilot policy. They were not \r\n  occupying the tow truck as the policy defines that term. \r\n  (2) Under the plain meaning of the words, neither Yensen nor Barnhill \r\n  was \"in, upon, getting in, on, out or off\" the tow truck. While there was some \r\n  testimony that Yensen intended to leave the scene in the tow truck, at the time \r\n  of the accident, he was not in or on the tow truck, nor was he in the process \r\n  of getting into it.\r\n\r\nFurther, under Whitmire, 254 S.C. at 187-92, \r\n  174 S.E.2d at 393-95, we do not find Yensen to have been alighting from the \r\n  tow truck. Whitmire held that where a passenger was struck while within \r\n  two or three feet of the car he had immediately \"alighted from,\" that passenger \r\n  may collect uninsured motorist coverage from the insurer of the car he had been \r\n  riding in. Id. at 191-92, 174 S.E.2d at 394-95. Appellants argue that \r\n  Whitmire is controlling in this case because Yensen intended to occupy \r\n  the tow truck and should therefore be able to collect insurance from the tow \r\n  truck's insurance provider. Whitmire is distinguishable because there, \r\n  the plaintiff had unquestionably been occupying the car, whereas this case involves, \r\n  at most, Yensen's intent to occupy the tow truck, expressed after the \r\n  accident and during litigation. We are reluctant to extend Whitmire to \r\n  these facts because Yensen was not \"still engaged in the completion of those \r\n  acts reasonably to be expected from one getting out of an automobile under similar \r\n  conditions.\" Id. at 191, 174 S.E.2d at 394.\r\n\r\nAppellants' reliance upon Merck v. Nationwide \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 318 S.C. 22, 455 S.E.2d 697 (1995) is unavailing. That case \r\n  dealt with the issue of stacking of underinsured motorist coverage. In Merck, \r\n  the insured's disabled vehicle was on a tow truck in the emergency lane. Id. \r\n  at 23-24, 455 S.E.2d at 698. The insured was standing beside the tow truck with \r\n  the tow truck driver when an intoxicated driver ran off the road, striking the \r\n  insured, the tow truck driver, and the tow truck. Id. The supreme court \r\n  affirmed this court's conclusion that the insured's vehicle was \"involved in \r\n  the accident\" because it was present at the scene, and the accident had an effect \r\n  on it when the car was thrown from the wrecker. Id. at 24, 455 S.E.2d at 698. \r\n  In Merck, uninsured coverage on the tow truck was not an issue as it \r\n  is in this case. Rather, Merck dealt with whether the victim's own vehicle \r\n  was \"involved in the accident,\" an issue not disputed here where all parties \r\n  agree that Yensen's vehicle was involved in the accident. Moreover, in Merck \r\n  the policy and S.C. Code Ann. section 38-77-160 (1989), provided coverage to \r\n  vehicles \"involved in the accident,\" while here, coverage is afforded to individuals \r\n  \"occupying the vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nAppellants also argue they should collect under \r\n  the Jefferson Pilot policy because they were \"involved\" with the tow truck at \r\n  the time of their injuries, citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Bookert, \r\n  330 S.C. 221, 499 S.E.2d 480 (Ct. App. 1998). This reliance is misplaced. In \r\n  Bookert, a gunman riding in a vehicle shot and injured a pedestrian. \r\n  This court held the pedestrian could collect underinsured motorist insurance \r\n  coverage from his policy because his injury arose out of the gunman's use of \r\n  his own vehicle, making the gunman's vehicle an \"active accessory\" to the crime. \r\n  Id. at 230-31, 523 S.E.2d at 485. In both Bookert and its predecessor \r\n  Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 422 S.E.2d 106 \r\n  (1992), this court and the supreme court stated that the gunman's vehicle was \r\n  an \"active accessory\" to the crime where there was a sufficient causal connection \r\n  between the gunman's use of his vehicle and the other party's injuries. Bookert, \r\n  330 S.C. at 231, 523 S.E.2d at 485; Howser, 309 S.C. at 273, 422 S.E.2d \r\n  at 108. Appellants seek to apply this reasoning to this case, suggesting the \r\n  gunman's vehicle is akin to the tow truck in this case. However, unlike the \r\n  shooter's use of his vehicle in Bookert and Howser, Huttner did \r\n  not use the tow truck in any way that could be construed to make the tow truck \r\n  an \"active accessory\" to this accident. In fact, Huttner had no contact with \r\n  the tow truck, either before or after the accident. Further, there is no causal \r\n  connection between the tow truck and the injuries Yensen and Barnhill suffered. \r\n  (3)\r\n\r\nIn our view, neither Yensen nor Barnhill was occupying \r\n  the tow truck as that term is defined in the policy. Accordingly, we affirm \r\n  the trial court's grant of summary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. State Farm \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Farm insured both a motorcycle and a van \r\n  owned by Huttner. The State Farm policies provided liability coverage to Huttner \r\n  to use other cars, specifically defined as a newly acquired car, a temporary \r\n  substitute car, or a non-owned car. The trial judge granted a directed verdict \r\n  to State Farm concluding the Beretta was not a newly acquired car, a temporary \r\n  substitute car, or a non-owned car as defined by the State Farm policies.\r\n\r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence \r\n  and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most \r\n  favorable to the party opposing the motions. Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, \r\n  320 S.C. 274, 465 S.E.2d 84 (1995). The trial court must deny the motions when \r\n  the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt. Id. \r\n  The appellate court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence \r\n  to support the ruling below. Steinke v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing, \r\n  &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).\r\n\r\nYensen and Barnhill contend the trial court erred \r\n  in granting a directed verdict. They argue there is more than one reasonable \r\n  inference to be drawn from the facts as to whether Huttner had permission from \r\n  Jackie Cooper to drive the Beretta. They also argue State Farm's policy language \r\n  contravenes South Carolina's mandatory insurance requirements by limiting the \r\n  circumstances in which State Farm provides liability coverage for non-owned \r\n  vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (a) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State Farm policies state \"the liability coverage \r\n  extends to use, by an insured, of a newly acquired car, a temporary substitute \r\n  car or a non-owned car.\"&nbsp; Yensen and Barnhill argue this contractual language \r\n  violates South Carolina's mandatory insurance requirements, relying upon State \r\n  Auto Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Gibbs, 314 S.C. 345, 444 S.E.2d \r\n  504 (1994).\r\n\r\nYensen and Barnhill cite language in Gibbs \r\n  which states, \"South Carolina law is clear that liability to third parties under \r\n  an owner's automobile liability policy is absolute when injury occurs.\" Id. \r\n  at 349, 444 S.E.2d at 506 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§56-9-20 (7)(b)(1) and (b)(3) \r\n  (Supp. 1999)). The supreme court made this statement in the context of its discussion \r\n  of an exclusion contained in a non-owner's insurance policy. The court referenced \r\n  specific statutes defining a motor vehicle liability policy. See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann.Â§56-9-20(5) and 5(b) (Supp. 1999). In the language of section 56-9-20, \r\n  a motor vehicle liability policy is one that meets the requirements of sections \r\n  38-77-140 through 230. Yensen and Barnhill apply the language from Gibbs \r\n  out of context because the case deals with statutorily required coverage. Liability \r\n  coverage for non-owned vehicles is not statutorily required in this state and \r\n  is provided by a voluntary contract between the insurer and the insured. Jackson \r\n  v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 288 S.C. 335, 337, 342 S.E.2d 603, 604 \r\n  (1986). Accordingly, the parties may choose their own terms regarding coverage \r\n  for non-owned vehicles. Id. Therefore, Gibbs is not applicable, \r\n  and the State Farm policies do not violate South Carolina's mandatory insurance \r\n  requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (b)  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe State Farm policies provide \"the liability \r\n  coverage extends to use, by an insured, of a newly acquired car, a temporary \r\n  substitute car or a non-owned car.\"&nbsp; The parties do not contend the Beretta \r\n  was a \"newly acquired car.\" Thus, our only determination is whether the Beretta \r\n  was a temporary substitute car or a non-owned car. We agree with the trial court \r\n  that it was neither.\r\n\r\nThe State Farm policies define a temporary substitute \r\n  car as \"a car not owned by you or your spouse, if it replaces your car for a \r\n  short time. Its use has to be with the consent of the owner. Your car has to \r\n  be out of use due to its breakdown, repair, servicing, damage or loss.\" \r\n  While Yensen and Barnhill have argued Huttner had permission to use \r\n  the Beretta, they did not specifically address the trial court's additional \r\n  ruling that there was no reliable evidence Huttner's motorcycle or van was out \r\n  of use due to breakdown or servicing. Based upon their failure to address this \r\n  additional ruling, we affirm the trial court. See Anderson v. Short, \r\n  323 S.C. 522, 476 S.E.2d 475 (1996)(where the ruling of the trial judge is based \r\n  on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the appellant \r\n  appeals all grounds).\r\n\r\nThe State Farm policies define a \"non-owned car\" \r\n  as \"a car not owned by or registered or leased in the name of: (4) an employer \r\n  of you, your spouse or any relative.\" (emphasis added) Based upon this definition, \r\n  the Beretta did not qualify as a non-owned car because it was owned by Huttner's \r\n  employer, Jackie Cooper. Under the policy definition, coverage was excluded \r\n  regardless of whether Huttner had permission from Jackie Cooper to drive the \r\n  Beretta.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial judge's finding \r\n  that State Farm was entitled to a directed verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. Guaranty Association \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Yensen and Barnhill contend the trial \r\n  court erred in granting a directed verdict to Guaranty Association. They assert \r\n  there is a question of fact as to whether Huttner had permission from Jackie \r\n  Cooper to drive the Beretta.\r\n\r\nHuttner worked in the body shop at Jackie Cooper. \r\n  Initially, he was hired as \"just a body man,\" but Huttner testified that he \r\n  later took over as \"manager\". While working at Jackie Cooper, Huttner often \r\n  drove cars he was working on for business purposes such as to pick up parts \r\n  or to test drive them. He testified he also \"kind of\" drove cars for pleasure. \r\n  He usually asked Jim Dill, a Jackie Cooper manager, for permission to drive \r\n  a vehicle. Huttner admitted he had driven company cars out of town before, but \r\n  not as far as Charleston. Huttner had access to the key and had used the Beretta \r\n  before to pick up parts.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the accident, Huttner left work around \r\n  5:00 p.m. on June 14, 1991. He had driven his truck to work that day. Huttner \r\n  decided to drive to Charleston that night to see his family and possibly locate \r\n  some parts for the Beretta.&nbsp; Although Huttner did not ask for permission \r\n  to drive the Beretta, he did not feel there was a problem for him to use the \r\n  car, since he occasionally used Jackie Cooper cars. Huttner stated that as far \r\n  as he was concerned he had permission to drive the Beretta.\r\n\r\nState Trooper Barry Watson investigated the Yensen/Barnhill \r\n  accident after Huttner was arrested for felony DUI. According to Watson, Huttner \r\n  made conflicting statements about whether he had permission to drive the Beretta. \r\n  Watson initially charged Huttner with use of a vehicle without the owner's consent \r\n  after Watson spoke to Jim Dill at Jackie Cooper and was told Huttner did not \r\n  have permission to use the car. However, that charge was dropped after Watson \r\n  spoke to Jackie Cooper. Watson testified Cooper stated Huttner had both access \r\n  and consent to drive cars he was working on.\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to Yensen and Barnhill, more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from \r\n  the evidence on the issue of permission. Accordingly, we conclude the trial \r\n  court erred in granting a directed verdict to Guaranty Association and reverse \r\n  and remand for a hearing on this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the grant of summary judgment to Jefferson \r\n  Pilot and the grant of a directed verdict to State Farm. We reverse the grant \r\n  of a directed verdict to Guaranty Association and remand to the trial court \r\n  for further proceedings.  \r\n  (4)\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

(CLM) for \r\n  engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices during his purchase of an automobile \r\n  from a CLM dealership. Mr. Ferguson died during the pendency of the action, \r\n  but his wife, Patricia, continued to prosecute the action in his stead. She \r\n  also sought class action certification. The trial court granted summary judgment \r\n  to CLM and ruled the request for class certification was moot. We affirm in \r\n  part and remand in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1997, Mr. Ferguson purchased a used \r\n  1993 Mercury Sable automobile from North Charleston Hyundai, an automobile dealership \r\n  owned and operated by CLM. Patricia accompanied him during the purchase, but \r\n  did not participate in all of the negotiations. After arriving at a price with \r\n  a salesperson, Mr. Ferguson purchased the car by tendering a $200 down payment \r\n  and signing a \"Buyers Order\" and a \"Retail Installment Loan and Security Agreement\" \r\n  (Security Agreement).\r\n\r\nThe Buyers Order listed the car's \"cash price\" \r\n  as $8,873.19. It then adjusted the cash price by several enumerated charges \r\n  and credits to arrive at the amount to be financed, $8,491.69. \r\n   (1)\r\n\r\nThe Security Agreement indicates that Eagle Finance \r\n  Corporation would finance the $8,491.69. Although the Security Agreement correctly \r\n  stated the amount to be financed ($8,491.69), it did not accurately reflect \r\n  the calculation made by the Buyers Order. Specifically, it misstated the cash \r\n  price and did not enumerate the $189.50 closing fee.\r\n\r\nMr. Ferguson took possession of the car on the \r\n  night he bought it. After driving it for several weeks, he noticed he had not \r\n  received a payment book and contacted CLM who referred him to Eagle Finance. \r\n  Eagle informed Mr. Ferguson that it could not process the loan due to errors \r\n  in the purchase documents and that he would have to return to the CLM dealership \r\n  and execute new documents in order to complete the transaction. According to \r\n  Patricia, Mr. Ferguson told her that CLM wanted \"to put in a fee . . . [and] \r\n  get more money out of us \" which he refused to do. Shortly thereafter, CLM repossessed \r\n  the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. Ferguson filed the instant action in 1997, \r\n  but died during its pendency. Patricia was substituted as plaintiff by way of \r\n  a consent order filed September 25, 1998.\r\n\r\nOn November 19, 1998, the trial court issued an \r\n  order compelling discovery. Thereafter, the defendants moved for summary judgment \r\n  on the merits which was granted by order filed January 15, 1999. The grant of \r\n  summary judgment rendered the class certification issue moot. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMr. Ferguson brought the instant action pursuant \r\n  to the South Carolina Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers \r\n  Act (Dealer's Act). S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-15-10 to -130 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2000). \r\n  In pertinent part, the Dealer's Act states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive \r\n    acts or practices as defined in Â§ 56-15-40 are hereby declared to be unlawful.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-30(a) (1991). \r\n  (2) The Act allows an injured party to recover money damages for violations \r\n  of the Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-110 (1991).\r\n\r\nI. Survivability \r\nIn its brief, CLM argues, as an additional sustaining \r\n  ground, that we should affirm the trial court's ruling because this action did \r\n  not survive Mr. Ferguson's death. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"Under the present rules [of appellate practice], \r\n  a respondent - the 'winner' in the lower court - may raise on appeal any additional \r\n  reasons the appellate court should affirm the lower court's ruling, regardless \r\n  of whether those reasons have been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.\" \r\n  I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, \r\n  723 (2000); Rule 208(b)(2), SCACR (\"Respondent's brief may also contain argument \r\n  asking the court to affirm for any ground appearing on the record as provided \r\n  by Rule 220(c), [SCACR].\"\r\n\r\n\"A cause of action created by statute survives \r\n  when and only when some provision for its survival is made in the statute itself, \r\n  or in some other statute.\" 1 C.J.S. Abatement and Revival Â§151, at 206 \r\n  (1985); see 1 Am. Jur. 2d Abatement, Survival, and Revival Â§53 \r\n  (1994). Therefore, to determine the survivability of the instant action, we \r\n  must look to South Carolina's general survival statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 \r\n  (1976), and the Dealer's Act itself.\r\n\r\nA. General Survival Statute - Section \r\n  15-5-90 \r\n\r\nAt common law, a personal action ex delicto \r\ndid not survive the death of either party. Bennett v. Spartanburg Ry. Gas &amp; \r\nElec. Co., 97 S.C. 27, 81 S.E. 189 (1914). However, the common law prohibition \r\nwas partially abrogated around the turn of the last century with the enactment \r\nof a survival statute for actions involving injuries to real estate. Rev. Stat. \r\nÂ§ 2323 (1894) (\"Causes of action for and in respect to any and all injuries and \r\ntrespasses to and upon real estate shall survive both to and against the personal \r\nor real representative (as the case may be) of deceased persons . . . any law \r\nor rule to the contrary notwithstanding.\"). The scope of the first survival statute \r\nwas expanded in 1905 to include \"any and all injuries to the person or to personal \r\nproperty . . . .\" S.C. Code of 1912 Â§ 3963 (Civ. Code). The statute has survived \r\nwith little change to the present day: \r\n\r\n  Causes of action for  and in respect \r\n    to any and all injuries and trespasses to and upon real estate and any \r\n    and all injuries to the person or to personal property shall survive \r\n    both to and against the personal or real representative, as the case may be, \r\n    of a deceased person and the legal representative of an insolvent person or \r\n    a defunct or insolvent corporation, any law or rule to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (1976) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\nGenerally, &quot;[a]ny cause of action which could \r\n  have been brought by the deceased in his lifetime survives to his representative \r\n  under [section 15-5-90].\" Layne v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local 382, \r\n  271 S.C. 346, 352, 247 S.E.2d 346, 350 (1978). However, despite section 15-5-90's \r\n  broad language, our supreme court recognizes several exceptions to it for actions \r\n  involving malicious prosecution, slander, and fraud and deceit. Id. at 349 &amp; \r\n  349 n.2, 247 S.E.2d at 349 &amp; 349 n.2; see Brewer v. Graydon, \r\n  233 S.C. 124, 128, 103 S.E.2d 767, 769 (1958) (\"It is interesting to note that \r\n  with a liberal construction [of the general survival statute] this Court has \r\n  held that actions for malicious prosecution, slander, and fraud and deceit do \r\n  not survive . . . .\").\r\n\r\nSurvivability is determined by the \"nature and \r\n  substance of the cause of action, rather than the form of the remedy . . . .\" \r\n  Ward v. Atlas Constr. Co., 276 S.C. 346, 349, 278 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1981); \r\n  see Page v. Lewis, 203 S.C. 190, 26 S.E.2d 569 (1943). In the \r\n  instant action, Ferguson essentially alleged that CLM fraudulently concealed \r\n  the closing fee during the purchase and failed to disclose the fee on the associated \r\n  loan documents. Because this action is based on a theory of fraud and deceit, \r\n  it falls within the ambit of the fraud exception to the general survival statute. \r\n  Accordingly, the instant action does not survive Mr. Ferguson's death by operation \r\n  of section 15-5-90.\r\n\r\nB. Dealer's Act \r\n\r\n\"Whether an action survives the death of a party \r\n  must be determined by looking towards the law, state or federal, under which \r\n  the cause of action arose.\" 1 Am. Jur. 2d Abatement, Survival, and Revival \r\n  Â§ 53, at 110 (1994). Although this general rule has never been applied to a \r\n  cause of action arising under the Dealer's Act, the courts of this state have \r\n  applied the rule's rationale to other statutory actions.\r\n\r\nIn Estate of Covington v. AT&amp;T Nassau Metals \r\n  Corp., 304 S.C. 436, 405 S.E.2d 393 (1991), the Court held that a workers' \r\n  compensation action did not survive the death of a claimant. After deciding \r\n  the general survival statute, section 15-5-90, was inapplicable to an action \r\n  brought pursuant to the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act (Act), the \r\n  Court analyzed the Act and found no statutory provision to support the survivability \r\n  of the claim. (3) \r\n\r\nThis Court reached a similar conclusion in Reed \r\n  v. Medlin, 284 S.C. 585, 328 S.E.2d 115 (Ct. App. 1985), overruled on \r\n  other grounds by Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 451 S.E.2d 894 (1994), \r\n  wherein it held that a statutory cause of action raised against the state did \r\n  not survive the death of the injured plaintiff because the statutory scheme \r\n  did not contain a survival provision. \"[U]nless a statute specifically provides \r\n  for survival of an action for personal injury, it does not lie after the injured \r\n  person's death.\" Id. at 589, 328 S.E.2d at 118; cf. Layne, \r\n  271 S.C. at 352, 247 S.E.2d at 349 (holding that an action brought pursuant \r\n  to the Right to Work Act survived because the party opposing survivability offered \r\n  \"no authority or precedent which would weigh against application of the general \r\n  [survival] rule . . . .\").\r\n\r\nThe Dealer's Act contains no survivability provision; \r\n  therefore, the instant action does not survive Mr. Ferguson's death.\r\n\r\nII. Class Certification \r\nFerguson argues the trial court erred in not certifying \r\n  a class action since all the criteria for certification were met. We disagree.\r\n\r\nUsually, an order denying class certification is \r\n  interlocutory and not immediately appealable. See Eldridge v. City \r\n  of Greenwood, 308 S.C. 125, 126-27, 417 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1992) (\"Orders \r\n  under Rule 23, SCRCP are interlocutory and thus, immediately appealable only \r\n  in certain circumstances.\"); Waller v. Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Ass'n, \r\n  300 S.C. 465, 388 S.E.2d 799 (1990) (recognizing an order denying class certification \r\n  as an interlocutory order). However, we may review an interlocutory order when, \r\n  as now, it contains other appealable issues. Pruitt v. Bowers, 330 S.C. \r\n  483, 499 S.E.2d 250 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Hite v. Thomas &amp; \r\n  Howard Co., 305 S.C. 358, 360, 409 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1991) (\"[A]n order that \r\n  is not directly appealable will nonetheless be considered if there is an appealable \r\n  issue before the Court and a ruling on appeal will avoid unnecessary litigation.\") \r\n  (emphasis added), overruled on other grounds by Huntley v. Young, \r\n  319 S.C. 559, 462 S.E.2d 860 (1995).\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites of a class action are set forth \r\n  in Rule 23, SCRCP:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all \r\n    members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to \r\n    the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \r\n    are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, (4) the \r\n    representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \r\n    the class, and (5) in cases in which the relief primarily sought is not \r\n    injunctive or declaratory with respect to the class as a whole, the amount \r\n    in controversy exceeds one hundred dollars for each member of the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 23(a), SCRCP (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe proponent of class certification must prove \r\n  each prerequisite of certification. Waller v. Seabrook Island Prop. Owners' \r\n  Ass'n, 300 S.C. 465, 388 S.E.2d 799 (1990). \"The failure of the proponents \r\n  to satisfy any one of the prerequisites is fatal to class certification.\" Id. \r\n  at 467, 388 S.E.2d at 801.\r\n\r\nIn as much as Mr. Ferguson's action does not survive, \r\n  there is no representative party to satisfy the third and fourth requirements. \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in ruling that the issue of class certification \r\n  was mooted by the dismissal of Ferguson's claim.\r\n\r\nIII. Discovery Costs\r\n\r\nFerguson also argues the trial court erred in ordering \r\n  her to pay one-half of CLM's cost for producing the documents she had requested \r\n  from CLM pursuant to Rule 34, SCRCP. As this issue has not been finally decided \r\n  by the trial court, we remand it for such a determination.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, a discovery order is not immediately \r\n  appealable because it is an interlocutory order. Hamm v. South Carolina Pub. \r\n  Serv. Comm'n, 312 S.C. 238, 439 S.E.2d 852 (1994). However, as we discussed \r\n  above, an interlocutory order may be reviewed if it contains appealable issues \r\n  which are properly before the court. Hite, 305 S.C. 358, 409 S.E.2d 340; \r\n  Pruitt, 330 S.C. 483, 499 S.E.2d 250.\r\n\r\nFerguson asked CLM for copies of its dealership's \r\n  buyers orders and security agreements pursuant to Rule 34, SCRCP. CLM provided \r\n  Ferguson with copies of the buyers orders, then demanded a $30 per hour clerical \r\n  fee plus $0.15 per page copying fee for all the copies it had already provided \r\n  as well as any additional copies necessary to satisfy the Ferguson's discovery \r\n  requests. Ferguson's counsel agreed to the charge.\r\n\r\nOn or about November 18, 1998, CLM invoiced Ferguson \r\n  in the amount of $1,041.15 in discovery costs which included a $96.15 copying \r\n  fee and a $945 clerical fee. Shortly thereafter, Ferguson challenged the amount \r\n  of the clerical fee. By order dated November 19, 1998, the trial court ordered \r\n  Ferguson to immediately pay CLM half of the invoiced fee, $520.57, but left \r\n  the final determination of \"the proper charge for the subject documents [to] \r\n  be resolved by the trial judge.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a determination has never been made; therefore, \r\n  the issue is remanded to the trial court.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's \r\n  order on appeal is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur. \r\n1.  This figure was arrived \r\n  at by deducting $900 in credits (a $700 trade-in allowance and a $200 down payment) \r\n  from the cash price then adding $518.50 in costs ($300 in state sales tax, $29 \r\n  tag and title fee, and a $189.50 \"closing fee\").  \r\n2.    \r\n  We do not view Mr. Ferguson's arguments as encompassing the contention that \r\n  CLM's actions constituted unfair methods of competition.  \r\n3.

Mark McAdam, all of  The Thompson Law Firm, of  Conway, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:   In this declaratory judgment action, the special referee found the Insurance Reserve Fund (the Fund) was contractually obligated, under the\r\nterms of a Tort Liability Insurance Policy, to indemnify Horry County for damage caused to neighboring property by a county-operated coquina mine. (1)  The\r\nFund appeals.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n\r\nFrom 1984 until 1991, Horry County operated a coquina mine near Loris,  South Carolina.  In the course of operating the mine, the County continually pumped\r\nwater from the mine pits.  Otis Johnson, the owner of neighboring property, noticed problems on his property resulting from the operation of the mine.  In 1989\r\nthe level of his irrigation pond dropped approximately ten feet. In 1991 Johnson discovered a 12- by 12-foot sink hole, open to a depth of five to six feet, in his\r\nfield.  Johnson alleged the water created further sink and chimney holes on his property, rendering his house uninhabitable.  Johnson filed suit against Horry\r\nCounty alleging an inverse condemnation of his property.  A jury awarded Johnson $300,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, neighboring property owners, Betty Johnson and Velma and Jerry Strickland also filed claims against the County alleging inverse condemnation.  Betty\r\nJohnson alleged the County's operation of the mine caused sink and chimney holes on her property. Betty Johnson also alleged the operation of the mine caused\r\ncracks in the foundation of her house.  The  Stricklands alleged operation of the mine caused flooding on twenty acres of their property, resulting in severely\r\ndamaged vegetation and timber.  The County settled with Betty Johnson for $75,000 and with the Stricklands for $50,000.\r\n\r\nRelying on the insurance policy, the County filed this declaratory judgment action seeking an order requiring the Fund to indemnify it for the judgment and\r\nsettlement amounts plus attorney fees and interest.  By consent, the parties referred the matter to a special referee with finality.  The referee concluded the\r\npolicy provided coverage and ordered the Fund to indemnify the County.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe standard of review in a declaratory judgment \r\n  action is determined by the underlying issue or issues. Felts v. Richland \r\n  County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991). The underlying issue in this \r\n  action is the determination of coverage under an insurance policy. An action \r\n  to ascertain whether coverage exists under an insurance policy is an action \r\n  at law. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000). In an action at law, this court will not disturb \r\n  the trial court's findings unless they are without any reasonable evidentiary \r\n  support. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (1976). \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Exclusion of inverse condemnation actions\r\n\r\nThe Fund contends inverse condemnation actions are outside the scope of coverage provided by the policy.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse condemnation is a cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover the value of property which has been taken in fact by the governmental\r\ndefendant, even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted by the taking agency. While the typical taking occurs when the\r\ngovernment acts to condemn property in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, the entire doctrine of inverse condemnation is predicated on the\r\nproposition that a taking may occur without such formal proceedings. \r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action is not based on tort, but on the constitutional prohibition of the taking of property without  compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n29A C.J.S. Eminent Domain Â§ 381 (1992).\r\n\r\nThe Fund first argues the purpose of the Fund is to provide liability insurance to South Carolina and its political subdivisions in light of the abolition of\r\nsovereign immunity.  Thus, the Fund argues, the policy cannot provide coverage for any risk for which sovereign immunity has not been waived, such as\r\ninverse condemnation, because the government has never been immune from an action alleging a taking of private property.  The Fund claims the only risks\r\ncovered under the policy are those encompassed within the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. (2)\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court addressed this argument in Town \r\n  of Duncan v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 326 S.C. 6, 482 S.E.2d 768 \r\n  (1997) with respect to a claim under the \"Whistleblower Act,\" codified at South \r\n  Carolina Code Annotated sections 8-27-10 to -50 (Supp. 2000). The Court concluded \r\n  that the \"duty to defend or indemnify should not be predicated on whether the \r\n  Whistleblower action is covered by the Tort Claims Act. Rather, the policy itself \r\n  should be examined to see whether coverage is provided by its terms.\" Town \r\n  of Duncan, 326 S.C. at 12-13, 482 S.E.2d at 772. \r\n\r\nThe Fund, however, also argues the policy, entitled a \"Tort Liability Insurance Policy,\" covers only actions arising in tort, thereby excluding coverage for\r\ninverse condemnation.  The policy does not contain an exclusion for inverse condemnation nor does it define \"tort.\"   \r\n\r\nExclusions in an insurance policy are to be interpreted \r\n  narrowly and to the benefit of the insured. McPherson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. \r\n  Co., 310 S.C. 316, 426 S.E.2d 770 (1993). Although the policy is entitled \r\n  a \"Tort\" policy, it does not define a tort or exclude actions not sounding in \r\n  tort, thus does not inherently exclude an action for inverse condemnation. In \r\n  the absence of an express exclusion, the Fund's distinction between a claim \r\n  based on tort liability and a claim based on inverse condemnation liability \r\n  does not resolve the question of coverage under the policy. Rather, pursuant \r\n  to Town of Duncan, 326 S.C. 6, 482 S.E.2d 768 and McPherson, 310 \r\n  S.C. 316, 426 S.E.2d 770, we look to the terms of the policy itself to determine \r\n  coverage. \r\n\r\nII. The language of the policy\r\n\r\nThe Fund argues the language of the policy excludes coverage as there was neither \"property damage\" suffered, nor an \"occurrence,\" as these terms are defined\r\nin the policy.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nA. \"Property Damage\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy defines property damage as:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom,\r\nor\r\n\r\n(2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsurance policies are subject to the general rules \r\n  of contract construction. Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., Inc., \r\n  318 S.C. 231, 456 S.E.2d 912 (1995). Policy language is interpreted according \r\n  to its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Id.  \r\n\r\nOtis Johnson and Betty Johnson suffered sink holes and chimney holes on their property.  Otis Johnson lost use of his property; he was no longer able to live in\r\nhis home due to cracks caused by the sink holes.  Water from the mine flooded Velma and Jerry Strickland's land.  We find sink and chimney holes, cracks in a\r\nhouse's foundation, and flooding are within the ordinary meaning of physical injury to property.  As the policy includes physical injury in the definition of\r\nproperty damage, we conclude this harm is clearly within the definition of property damage.\r\n\r\nB. \"Occurrence\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fund also argues that because the County intentionally operated the mine, the property damage was intentional, and therefore did not amount to an\r\n\"occurrence.\"  We disagree.   \r\n\r\nThe policy provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fund will pay on behalf of the insured all \r\n    sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because \r\n    of \r\n\r\n  A. Personal Injury or B. Property Damage \r\n    to which this applies caused by an occurrence . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nEmphasis added. The policy specifically defines \"occurrence\" as: \r\n\r\n\r\n  an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure \r\n    to conditions, which result[s] in personal injury or property damage neither \r\n    expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmphasis added. \r\n\r\nThe policy definition of \"occurrence\" includes \r\n  unexpected or unintended property damage caused by continuous or repeated exposure. \r\n  The County's intentional operation of the mine does not equate to an intent \r\n  by the County to cause property damage. There is no evidence in the record the \r\n  County operated the mine to create sink holes or cause other property damage. \r\n  Furthermore, the County's operation of the mine constituted continuous exposure \r\n  to the neighboring property owners. Employing the rule requiring this court \r\n  to interpret an insurance policy provision according to its plain meaning, we \r\n  conclude the damage to the neighboring property owners resulted from continuous \r\n  exposure to the mine, and the damage was not intended by the County. See \r\n  Diamond State, 318 S.C. at 236, 456 S.E.2d at 915. \r\n\r\nThe parties in this action are bound by the provisions \r\n  of the policy as written. See Drafts v. Shull Sausage Co., 276 \r\n  S.C. 52, 275 S.E.2d 577 (1981) (stating parties are bound by unambiguous terms \r\n  of an insurance contract). We accordingly hold the special referee did not err \r\n  in requiring the Fund to indemnify the County.\r\n\r\nIII. Title to the property\r\n\r\nThe Fund alternatively argues if there is coverage under the policy, the Fund is entitled to obtain fee simple title to the neighboring properties.  The Fund argues\r\nthe  special referee erred in concluding the County did not acquire title to the neighboring properties.  The Fund alleges the inverse condemnation award\r\nconstituted a forced sale of the properties by the neighboring property owners to the County. (3)  Thus, the Fund argues, it is entitled to an order  requiring the\r\nCounty to deed the properties to the Fund.  We find this argument is without merit.   \r\n\r\nInverse condemnation actions do not constitute \r\n  forced sales of property because such actions compensate property owners for \r\n  the diminution in value to their property, not for the full value of \r\n  the property. See Yadkin Brick Co. v. Materials Recovery Co., \r\n  339 S.C. 640, 529 S.E.2d 764 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating that the proper measure \r\n  of damages for an injury of a permanent nature to real property is the diminution \r\n  of the market value of the property); Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 \r\n  S.C. 447, 434 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding the measure of damages for \r\n  permanent injury to real property, whether asserted under nuisance, trespass, \r\n  negligence, or inverse condemnation, is the diminution in the market value of \r\n  the property). We therefore find no error.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.   \r\n1.

(1) We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 1998, Speth and two friends returned \r\n  to Clemson University after a weekend away. Speth parked in a designated handicapped \r\n  space. He and his friends removed some rather heavy items from the trunk of \r\n  the car. The unloading took \"less than a minute.\" Speth then reentered his car. \r\n  Officer Ikenegbu, who had been dispatched to the area in response to a complaint \r\n  about the handicapped parking situation, blocked Speth from leaving. Officer \r\n  Ikenegbu took a picture of the car and issued Speth a ticket for unlawful parking \r\n  in a designated handicapped space, in violation of South Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-3-1970 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2000). (2) Speth \r\n  admitted that he saw the sign designating the parking place as a handicapped \r\n  space.\r\n\r\nSpeth was tried by a jury in Clemson University \r\n  Municipal Court. He was found guilty and fined.\r\n\r\nSpeth appealed to circuit court, arguing among \r\n  other grounds the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury the definition \r\n  of \"park\" as set forth in South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-610 (1991). This definition \r\n  provides: \"To 'park,' when prohibited, means the standing of a vehicle, whether \r\n  occupied or not, otherwise than temporarily for the purpose of and while actually \r\n  engaged in loading or unloading.\" The circuit court found this definition of \r\n  park was applicable to Â§ 56-3-1970, which prohibits parking in a place clearly \r\n  designated for handicapped persons unless the vehicle bears a license plate \r\n  or placard authorizing the vehicle to park in such spaces. It granted Speth \r\n  a new trial and directed the trial court on remand to charge the definition \r\n  of \"park\" as set forth in Â§ 56-5-610. Clemson University appealed. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nClemson University argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it reversed Speth's conviction for violating Â§ 56-3-1970 based upon the \r\n  trial court's failure to charge Â§ 56-5-610 to the jury. We agree.\r\n\r\nIt is error for the trial court to refuse to give \r\n  a requested instruction which states a sound principle of law when that principle \r\n  applies to the case at hand, and the principle is not otherwise included in \r\n  the charge. Sanders v. Western Auto Supply Co., 256 S.C. 490, 497, 183 \r\n  S.E.2d 321, 325 (1971). However, the trial court does not err in refusing to \r\n  give a requested jury instruction where it does not state the correct law. State \r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998). Thus, we must determine whether \r\n  Â§ 56-5-610's definition of \"park\" is applicable to Â§ 56-3-1970, which makes \r\n  it unlawful to park an unauthorized vehicle in a parking place clearly designated \r\n  for handicapped persons.\r\n\r\nThe primary concern in interpreting a statute is \r\n  to determine the intent of the legislature if it reasonably can be discovered \r\n  in the language when construed in the light of its intended purpose. Ray \r\n  Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 \r\n  S.E.2d 725 (1998); Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997). \r\n  The goal of statutory construction is to harmonize statutes whenever possible \r\n  and to prevent an interpretation that would lead to a result that is plainly \r\n  absurd. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n  However plain the ordinary meaning of the words \r\n    used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept \r\n    it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have \r\n    been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. \r\n    If possible, the court will construe the statute so as to escape the absurdity \r\n    and carry the intention into effect. \r\n\r\n\r\nRay Bell Constr. Co., 331 S.C. at 26, 501 \r\n  S.E.2d at 729 (quoting Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., \r\n  312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)).\r\n\r\nSection 56-5-610 is part of the Uniform Act Regulating \r\n  Traffic on Highways. The provisions of this Act \"refer exclusively to the operation \r\n  of vehicles upon the highways, except: (1) When a different place is specifically \r\n  referred to in a given section; and (2) That the provisions of Articles 9 and \r\n  23 shall apply upon highways and elsewhere throughout the State.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-20 (1991). Article 3 sets forth the definitions as applicable to \r\n  the Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-110 (1991) (\"For the purposes of this chapter \r\n  the words, phrases and terms defined in this article shall have the meanings \r\n  thereby attributed to them.\"). (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways, \r\n  while stating no person shall park in specified areas (3), \r\n  allows for temporary parking for loading and unloading. We find no indication \r\n  the Legislature intended the Act's definition of the word \"park\" as set forth \r\n  in Â§ 56-5-610 to apply to statutes outside of the Act. Furthermore, we find \r\n  the Legislature could not possibly have intended the Act's definition of \"park\" \r\n  to apply to Â§ 56-3-1970. In providing for designated handicapped parking places, \r\n  the Legislature recognized the need of people with disabilities for special \r\n  parking privileges. (4) These designated spaces \r\n  are exclusively for the use of people with disabilities. If the Act's definition \r\n  of \"park\" applied, able-bodied drivers would be allowed to use designated handicapped \r\n  parking spaces \"temporarily for the purpose of and while actually engaged in \r\n  loading or unloading.\" Such an interpretation would defeat the plain legislative \r\n  intention of providing parking places exclusively for the use of people with \r\n  disabilities. Accordingly, we hold the definition of \"park\" as set forth in \r\n  Â§ 56-5-610 does not apply to Â§ 56-3-1970. The trial court did not err in refusing \r\n  Speth's request to charge the jury with this definition of the word \"park.\" \r\n  The order of the circuit court granting Speth a new trial is reversed and Speth's \r\n  conviction in the Clemson University Municipal Court for violating Â§ 56-3-1970 \r\n  is reinstated.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n 1. Protection &amp; Advocacy \r\n  for People with Disabilities, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief in support of \r\n  reversing the decision of the circuit court. \r\n2. \"It is unlawful to park any \r\n  vehicle in a parking place clearly designated for handicapped persons unless \r\n  the vehicle bears the distinguishing license plate or placard provided in Section \r\n  56-3-1960.\"\r\n\r\n 3. See e.g., S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ Â§ 56-5-2510 (Supp. 2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2530 (1991 &amp; Supp. \r\n  2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2540 (Supp. 2000). \r\n4. The amicus curiae brief explained \r\n  the importance of handicapped parking:\r\n\r\n\r\n  These parking spaces make it possible for people \r\n    with many types of disabilities to visit stores, offices, government buildings, \r\n    and (as shown in this case) schools. People who use wheelchairs often cannot \r\n    exit their cars in crowded parking lots without a clear aisle beside the parking \r\n    space. The aisle makes it possible for wheelchair lifts to descend from specially \r\n    equipped vans. For those individuals without lifts, the aisles allow them \r\n    to safely transfer into their wheelchair and roll out from beside their vehicle. \r\n    People with disabilities who do not use wheelchairs may be unable to reach \r\n    public buildings unless they are able to park close to the entrance. Heart \r\n    conditions, emphysema, and multiple sclerosis are a few of the conditions \r\n    that may make walking more than a very short distance impossible. Because \r\n    of this limitation on their mobility a parking space close to the entrance \r\n    may be the only way they are able to enter a public building independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3303","title":"Toomer v.

We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1995, Lamont Leon Livingston was riding as \r\na passenger in a vehicle driven by Frankie Lee Tyler on South Carolina highway \r\nS-38-1029 in Orangeburg, South Carolina. As the vehicle attempted to cross a train \r\ntrack owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway Company (\"Norfolk Southern\"), a Norfolk \r\nSouthern train struck the vehicle, resulting in fatal injuries to Livingston. \r\nOn May 14, 1997, in their capacities as personal representatives \r\n  of the Estate of Livingston, plaintiffs Linda Toomer, Laura M. Simpson, and \r\n  Tammy Taylor commenced a survival action and a suit for wrongful death against \r\n  Norfolk Southern, the South Carolina Department of Transportation, Orangeburg \r\n  County, and Tyler, alleging negligence and joint and several liability. In its \r\n  answer Norfolk Southern asserted cross-claims for contractual and equitable \r\n  indemnity against Tyler.\r\n\r\nTyler moved for summary judgment on the cross-claims in \r\n  both actions. In response to the motion, Norfolk Southern acknowledged that \r\n  no contract existed between itself and Tyler and dropped its cross-claims for \r\n  contractual indemnity. On the remaining claim for equitable indemnity,  \r\n  the trial court granted summary judgment, finding: (1) \"the requirement of a \r\n  special relationship remains the law in South Carolina\"; and (2) since \"[t]here \r\n  was no contractual, master/servant, contractor/subcontractor or other relationship \r\n  between Defendant Tyler and Norfolk Southern at the time of the collision . \r\n  . . no cause of action for equitable indemnity lies between Tyler and Norfolk \r\n  Southern.\" Norfolk Southern appeals.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorfolk Southern argues a special relationship between \r\nthe parties is not a prerequisite for recovery under a claim for equitable indemnity \r\nand, therefore, summary judgment was improper. We disagree. \r\nI.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. (1) It is not appropriate, \r\n  however, where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify \r\n  the application of the law. (2) \r\n\r\n\r\nA party opposing a summary judgment motion on an indemnification claim, even though the motion is based primarily upon\r\nthe complaint, has the two-fold burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact regarding the opposing party's lack of\r\nliability and a genuine issue of material fact regarding the moving party's liability.  The failure to meet this two-fold burden is\r\nfatal to the indemnification claim. (3) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving\r\nparty. (4)\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized the principle of equitable indemnification. (5)  \r\n\r\n\r\nIndemnity is that form of compensation in which a first party is liable to pay a second party for a loss or damage the second\r\nparty incurs to a third party.  A right to indemnity may arise by contract (express or implied) or by operation of law as a matter\r\nof equity between the first and second party. (6)\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts have traditionally allowed equitable indemnity in cases of imputed fault or where some special relationship exists\r\nbetween the first and second parties. (7)  According to the principles of equity, the right exists \"whenever the relation between\r\nthe parties is such that either in law or in equity there is an obligation on one party to indemnify the other, as where one person\r\nis exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he does not join.\" (8)\r\n\r\nIn Winnsboro I, (9) \r\n  this court was asked to determine the indemnification issues between a contractor \r\n  and subcontractor named as codefendants in a suit alleging breach of contract, \r\n  negligence, and fraud. The general contractor, Turner-Murphy Company, was hired \r\n  to construct a waste water treatment facility for the Town of Winnsboro. Turner-Murphy, \r\n  in turn, hired the subcontractor, Specialty Constructors, Inc., to manufacture \r\n  and install the filter system to be used in the facility. When the facility \r\n  failed to operate properly, Winnsboro brought suit against both Turner-Murphy \r\n  and Specialty. The jury awarded Winnsboro actual and punitive damages against \r\n  Specialty but exonerated Turner-Murphy on all claims. Thereafter, the trial \r\n  judge directed a verdict in favor of Turner-Murphy on its cross-claim for indemnity \r\n  against Specialty. Specialty appealed and we affirmed.\r\n\r\nIn Winnsboro II, our supreme court \r\n  granted certiorari to review this court's decision in Winnsboro I. In \r\n  so doing, the supreme court addressed the requirement of a special relationship \r\n  between indemnitee and indemnitor.\r\n\r\nThe court began by comparing the facts of Winnsboro \r\n  with its earlier case of Addy v. Bolton.  \r\n  (10) In Addy, the court found an innocent landlord may recover \r\n  under a theory of indemnity when it is forced to reimburse its tenant for a \r\n  loss caused by a negligent third party. Bolton, the landlord, hired C.Y. Thomason \r\n  Company, a general contractor, to make repairs to a store it leased to Addy. \r\n  Thomason's welding work started a fire which damaged the stock and merchandise \r\n  in Addy's retail jewelry store. Addy commenced suit against both Bolton and \r\n  Thomason. The Winnsboro II court explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The relationship between Bolton, the owner, and [Thomason], \r\n    the contractor, was sufficient in [Addy] to allow Bolton to recover \r\n    his attorney fees and costs for defending the negligence of [Thomason]. [Thomason] \r\n    negligently burned Bolton's building. Because of [Thomason's] negligence toward \r\n    Bolton, Bolton was forced to defend in an action brought by Addy. We \r\n    think the relationship here [in Winnsboro II] between Turner-Murphy, the contractor, \r\n    and Specialty Constructors, the subcontractor, sufficiently analogous to the \r\n    relationship in Addy v. Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 183 S.E.2d 708 (1971), to \r\n    allow Turner-Murphy to recover attorney fees and costs expended in defending \r\n    the negligence of Specialty Constructors. (11)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court went on to state that \"a sufficient relationship \r\n  exists when the at-fault party's negligence or breach of contract is directed \r\n  at the non-faulting party and the non-faulting party incurs attorney fees \r\n  and costs in defending itself against the other's conduct.\" \r\n  (12) \r\n\r\nIn light of our supreme court's decision in Winnsboro \r\n  II, we concur with the finding of the trial judge. In order to sustain a \r\n  claim for equitable indemnity, the existence of some special relationship between \r\n  the parties must be established. (13)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a ruling by the trial court on equitable indemnity, this Court must look beyond the complaint. (14)  The Record on\r\nAppeal, however, is devoid of any relationship between Norfolk Southern and Tyler other than their relationship as co-defendants.  The lack of any special relationship between the parties is, therefore, fatal to Norfolk Southern's claim for\r\nequitable indemnity from Tyler.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

Brown, Jr., of Beaufort, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Senior Assistant General Counsel William L. Todd, \r\n          of South Carolina Department of Public Safety, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.: A magistrate's court \r\n  jury found James A. Brown, Sr., guilty of speeding. Brown appealed his conviction \r\n  to the Court of Common Pleas. The circuit court judge dismissed the appeal because \r\n  Brown did not serve a timely notice of appeal on the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Public Safety [SCDPS]. Brown appeals the dismissal. We affirm the decision \r\n  of the circuit court as modified.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1997, James A. Brown, Sr., was traveling \r\n  east on Highway 76. Brown was clocked going 62 mph in a 40 mph zone by a moving \r\n  radar mounted in a Highway Patrol cruiser. Lance Corporal Sherry McLeod issued \r\n  Brown a summons for speeding (62 mph in a 40 mph zone). \r\n\r\nOn June 26, 1998, Brown was tried for the traffic \r\n  violation by a jury in the Magistrate Court of Sumter. During the course of \r\n  the trial, Brown objected to the admission of a radar speed measurement reading \r\n  offered by the arresting officer. Brown asserted the State had to establish \r\n  through appropriate foundational evidence that moving radar speed measurement \r\n  devices were reliable and generally accepted among the scientific community. \r\n  The magistrate overruled Brown's objection and admitted the radar evidence. \r\n  \r\n\r\nLater in the course of the trial, Brown attempted \r\n  to introduce a videotape of the incident location. The magistrate concluded \r\n  that the tape was not admissible because it had not been made on the same day, \r\n  or even the same time of day the ticket was issued. The magistrate further found \r\n  that the video was cumulative to the testimony and graphic evidence presented. \r\n  Brown was, however, allowed to proffer the video. \r\n\r\nAt the close of the evidence, the jury found Brown \r\n  guilty of the speeding violation. As a result, Brown was fined $95 by the magistrate \r\n  on June 29, 1998. \r\n\r\nBrown served a Notice of Appeal on the magistrate \r\n  on July 6, 1998, by depositing it in the U.S. mail. On the bottom of his Notice \r\n  of Appeal, Brown listed Pat Teague as the attorney of record for the SCDPS. \r\n  However, Brown did not serve the SCDPS with a notice of appeal. \r\n\r\nOn October 3, 1998, Brown sent a letter to Pat \r\n  Teague, the attorney for SCDPS, \"to inform [him] of the upcoming appeal.\" On \r\n  October 12, 1998, the SCDPS filed a motion to dismiss Brown's appeal for failure \r\n  to timely serve notice of the appeal. \r\n\r\nOn October 26, 1998, the circuit court judge took \r\n  the notice issue under advisement and heard the merits of the appeal. In his \r\n  order dated November 14, 1998, the circuit court judge granted the motion to \r\n  dismiss the appeal, but addressed the issues raised by Brown and found them \r\n  to be without merit. On July 15, 1999, the circuit court judge issued an amended \r\n  order denying Brown's motion to reconsider and citing additional authority for \r\n  his original order. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nBefore addressing the merits of Brown's other issues \r\n  on appeal, we must decide whether the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to hear Brown's appeal. \"Service of the notice of intent to appeal is a jurisdictional \r\n  requirement, and this Court has no authority to extend or expand the time in \r\n  which the notice of intent to appeal must be served.\" Mears v. Mears, \r\n  287 S.C. 168, 169, 337 S.E.2d 206, 207 (1985).\r\n\r\nSections 18-3-10 through -70 provide for appeals \r\n  from magistrates in criminal cases. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 18-3-10 through -70 (1985 \r\n  &amp; Supp. 2000). Section 18-3-10 provides, \"Every person convicted before \r\n  a magistrate of any offense whatever and sentenced may appeal from the sentence \r\n  to the Court of Common Pleas for the county.\" (1) \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-10 (Supp. 2000). Upon conviction and sentence, the appellant \r\n  has ten days to \"serve notice of appeal upon the magistrate who tried the case.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-30 (1985). Within ten days of being served with the appellant's \r\n  notice, the magistrate is required to file the notice with the clerk of court. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-40 (Supp. 2000). However, there is no mention of service \r\n  of the notice of appeal on the State (the SCDPS in this case).\r\n\r\nThe dilemma posed in this case has arisen because \r\n  criminal appeals from magistrates are heard in courts that operate under the \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure. Because appeals from criminal convictions are heard \r\n  in the Court of Common Pleas, the SCDPS argues that Rule 74, SCRCP, mandates \r\n  the appellant serve notice of appeal on the SCDPS. Rule 74 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Except for the time for filing the notice of appeal, \r\n    the procedure on appeal to the circuit court from the judgment of an inferior \r\n    court . . . shall be in accordance with the statutes providing such appeals. \r\n    Notice of appeal to the circuit court must be served on all parties within \r\n    thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the judgment, order or \r\n    decision appealed from. In all such appeals the notice of intention to appeal \r\n    shall be filed with the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken and \r\n    with the inferior court . . . within the time provided by the statute, or \r\n    by this rule when no time is fixed by statute, for service of the notice of \r\n    intention to appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 74, SCRCP. As delineated above, the procedure \r\n  on appeal to the circuit court from the magistrate is provided in sections 18-3-10 \r\n  through -70. However, that procedure only specifically requires the appellant \r\n  to serve the magistrate with the notice of appeal. It does not address whether \r\n  the appellant must serve the State.\r\n\r\nThere are no cases explaining the interaction between \r\n  Rule 74 and appeals from criminal convictions in magistrates courts. Likewise, \r\n  there are only a few cases explaining the purpose of Rule 74. Those cases basically \r\n  quote from the Reporter's Note following Rule 75 that explains both Rules 74 \r\n  and 75. See Eagles v. South Carolina Nat'l Bank, 301 S.C. 402, \r\n  392 S.E.2d 187 (Ct. App. 1990); Karl Sitte Plumbing Co. v. Darby Dev. Co. \r\n  of Columbia, Inc., 295 S.C. 70, 367 S.E.2d 162 (Ct. App. 1988). The Reporter's \r\n  Note explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n  These Rules 74 and 75 are added to make uniform \r\n    the procedure on appeals to the Circuit Court where there is no provision \r\n    by statute. They do not replace any provisions as to such appeals in Title \r\n    18 of the Code, . . . but are added to supply omissions in these statutes \r\n    where no provision is made for the time to file notice of intention to appeal, \r\n    the form of the record on appeal, or how it shall be transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 75, SCRCP (Reporter's Note). This comment \r\n  seems to support the SCDPS argument that Rule 74 fills in the procedural gaps \r\n  not addressed in sections 18-3-10 through -70.\r\n\r\nIn Witzig v. Witzig, 325 S.C. 363, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  297 (Ct. App. 1996), this Court discussed Rule 74 briefly. We said, \"While [Rule \r\n  74] requires service on all parties of notice of appeal 'within thirty (30) \r\n  days after receipt of written notice of the judgment, order, or decision appealed \r\n  from,' Rule 74 applies only 'when no time is fixed by statute.'\" Id. \r\n  at 366, 479 S.E.2d at 299 (quoting Rule 74, SCRCP). Chapter 3 of Title 18 does \r\n  not provide a time fixed by statute to serve notice of appeal on the State, \r\n  so the position of the SCDPS is that the 30 day period provided in Rule 74 applies. \r\n  On the other hand, Brown's position is that no time is provided in the statutes \r\n  because he is not required to serve notice of appeal on the State. Brown maintains \r\n  that if anyone is required to serve notice of appeal on the State, it is the \r\n  magistrate.\r\n\r\nIn summation, the SCDPS contends Rule 74 applies \r\n  to all appeals taken to the Court of Common Pleas from inferior courts, including \r\n  appeals from criminal convictions in magistrate courts. Conversely, Brown argues \r\n  the controlling statutes do not require him to serve notice of appeal on anyone \r\n  other than the magistrate, and Rule 74 only applies to civil actions.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure is limited to \"all suits of a civil nature whether cognizable as cases \r\n  at law or in equity.\" Rule 1, SCRCP. \"In interpreting the language of a court \r\n  rule, we apply the same rules of construction used in interpreting statutes. \r\n  Therefore, the words of [the rule] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning \r\n  without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the rule.\" \r\n  Green v. Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. 303, 304, 443 S.E.2d 906, \r\n  907 (1994) (citations omitted). Because the scope of the Rules of Civil Procedure \r\n  is limited by Rule 1, Rule 74 only applies to civil actions. The action sub \r\n  judice is clearly criminal in nature. Therefore, Rule 74 does not apply \r\n  to Brown's appeal and the circuit court erred in dismissing the action based \r\n  on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (2)\r\n\r\nEven though the circuit court dismissed Brown's \r\n  appeal when it incorrectly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  it alternatively found Brown's issues on appeal meritless. Because we find the \r\n  circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal, we address \r\n  Brown's remaining issues below. \r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBrown argues the circuit court erred in affirming \r\n  the magistrate's admission of the reading from the moving radar speed measurement \r\n  device without first requiring evidence of a scientific foundation.\r\n\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter \r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal.\" Gamble v. International Paper Realty Corp., \r\n  323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996).\r\n\r\nAlthough the magistrate refused to require SCDPS \r\n  to lay any specific foundation before allowing the radar reading into evidence, \r\n  SCDPS attempted to satisfy Brown's request through Officer McLeod's testimony. \r\n  Officer McLeod testified she was trained in the operation of moving radar at \r\n  the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy. She was initially trained and certified \r\n  in 1991 and was subsequently recertified every three years. Before citing Brown \r\n  for speeding in May 1997, Officer McLeod's most recent recertification was in \r\n  April 1996. \r\n\r\nOfficer McLeod explained to the jury the procedure \r\n  she was taught at the Criminal Justice Academy for verifying that the radar \r\n  was in proper working condition before and after each shift. She also testified \r\n  that she followed that procedure on the day she ticketed Brown and that the \r\n  radar was functioning properly. \r\n\r\nBrown's main contention at trial and on appeal \r\n  was that the radar reading could have been subject to interference at the location \r\n  where the radar was used. However, Brown was free to call into question the \r\n  reliability of the evidence through cross-examination or by calling his own \r\n  expert in the reliability of readings from moving radar.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that the magistrate \r\n  did not abuse her discretion by allowing the reading from the moving radar into \r\n  evidence.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nBrown also argues the circuit court erred in sustaining \r\n  the magistrate's exclusion of a videotape of the incident location proffered \r\n  by Brown.\r\n\r\nBrown attempted to introduce a videotape he prepared \r\n  of the general site where the officer ticketed him. The magistrate refused to \r\n  admit the videotape. The video was not made on the same day as Brown was cited \r\n  for speeding. The video also depicts the site at a different time of day than \r\n  when Brown was cited. Furthermore, the roadway had undergone some changes since \r\n  the time of the incident. \r\n\r\nOnce again, \"[t]he admission or exclusion of evidence \r\n  is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear \r\n  abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.\" Gamble, 323 S.C. at 373, 474 \r\n  S.E.2d at 441. Nevertheless, even if the magistrate should have allowed the \r\n  video into evidence, it was cumulative to the prior testimony regarding the \r\n  roadway and the diagram of the road used at trial. The exclusion of the video \r\n  was harmless because the video was cumulative to other evidence and no prejudice \r\n  resulted from its exclusion. State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 473, \r\n  523 S.E.2d 787, 793-94 (Ct. App. 1999). Therefore, we find no error in the magistrate's \r\n  exclusion of the videotape prepared by Brown.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit \r\n  court is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. Section 18-3-10 was amended \r\n  in 1994 to require criminal convictions in a magistrate's court to be appealed \r\n  to the Court of Common Pleas instead of the \"next term of the court of general \r\n  sessions for the county.\" Act No. 520, 1994 S.C. Acts 5930. \r\n2. Our decision does not address \r\n  how the SCDPS should have been notified of Brown's appeal. Undoubtedly, notice \r\n  must be provided. However, the rules and statutes are silent and fail to impose \r\n  this responsibility on either the magistrate, the clerk of court, or the appellant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3305","title":"Roof v.

Phil Roof appeals \r\n  the grant of summary judgment to Arthur Swanson, Mason Chrisman, Charles Jackson, \r\n  La Vonne Phillips, Jerry Shearer, Carlyle Blakeney, R. Lee Burrows, Jr., and \r\n  Joseph P. Griffith, Jr., all of whom are former members of ComSouth's Board \r\n  of Directors. The trial court found Roof's action was barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n\r\n\r\nIn July 1988, ComSouth Bankshares, Inc. (ComSouth) \r\n  began operations as a bank holding company with the opening of its wholly-owned \r\n  subsidiary, the Bank of Columbia. In April 1990, ComSouth opened its second \r\n  bank and wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank of Charleston. Between December 1991 \r\n  and July 1992, representatives from both the National Bank of South Carolina \r\n  (NBSC) and Carolina First Corporation held negotiations with the respondents, \r\n  who were then members of the ComSouth board of Directors, in an attempt to acquire \r\n  ComSouth. \r\n\r\nAt the time of the negotiations, Roof was a ComSouth \r\n  shareholder. On July 30, 1997, he commenced this action against the respondents, \r\n  alleging the Board's failure to immediately disclose the existence and the substance \r\n  of the negotiations to shareholders constituted a breach of fiduciary duty and \r\n  a violation of S.C. Code Ann. section 35-1-1210 (1987). Roof further alleged \r\n  the acquisition offers would have greatly increased the value of ComSouth's \r\n  shares and the Board rejected the offers in an attempt to purchase the stock \r\n  at depressed prices from existing shareholders.\r\n\r\nPrior to the commencement of Roof's individual \r\n  action, Roof was a member of a prospective class action filed by fellow ComSouth \r\n  shareholder, Carl Almond. Almond filed the class action against the ComSouth \r\n  Board on January 17, 1994, alleging the same breaches of duty involved in this \r\n  case. By order dated October 9, 1996, Judge Casey Manning denied Almond's motion \r\n  for class certification.\r\n\r\nThe respondents answered Roof's complaint and moved \r\n  for summary judgment on several grounds, including that the claim was untimely \r\n  under the applicable statute of limitations. (1) \r\n  At a hearing on the motion, Roof withdrew his securities fraud claim under section \r\n  35-1-1210 and proceeded solely on the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The \r\n  parties stipulated that Roof's cause of action accrued on July 28, 1992, the \r\n  date the Board ceased any sale or merger discussions with NBSC and Carolina \r\n  First. Judge Jackson V. Gregory found Roof's action was barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations and granted summary judgment to the respondents. This appeal \r\n  followed.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole issue presented in this appeal is whether S.C. Code Ann. section 33-8-300(e) bars a cause of action brought within\r\nthree years of accrual when the plaintiff had knowledge of the breach more than two years prior to the commencement of the\r\naction.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law. (2)  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can\r\nbe reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. (3) \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 33-8-300(e) provides: \r\n\r\n  An action against a director for failure to perform \r\n    the duties imposed by this section must be commenced within three years after \r\n    the cause of action has accrued, or within two years after the time when the \r\n    cause of action is discovered, or should reasonably have been discovered, \r\n    whichever sooner occurs. This limitations period does not apply to breaches \r\n    of duty which have been concealed fraudulently. \r\n     (4)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we noted above, the parties stipulated that \r\n  the cause of action accrued on July 28, 1992. Roof, however, did not file this \r\n  action until July 27, 1997, and service was not effected until on or after August \r\n  15, 1997. Roof argues the statute of limitations was tolled during the thirty-three \r\n  months that the Almond class action was pending and, as a result, only twenty-seven \r\n  months was charged against the statute.\r\n\r\nWhether a statute of limitations is tolled during \r\n  the pendency of a class action is an issue of first impression in South Carolina. \r\n  We, however, deem it unnecessary to address the issue in the present case because \r\n  even assuming Roof's method of calculation is correct, he failed to commence \r\n  his action within two years of his discovery of the breach. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Roof contends the statute provides for \r\n  a minimum rather than maximum three-year limitations period. He argues that \r\n  the phrase \"whichever sooner occurs\" refers to the distinction between actual \r\n  and constructive notice of the breach, rather than the expiration of the two \r\n  and three-year periods. He, therefore, posits that the \"discovery provision\" \r\n  can operate only to increase the three-year period. We disagree. \r\n\r\n\"In construing a statute, its words must be given \r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction \r\n  to limit or expand the statute's operation.\" (5) \r\n  Furthermore, \"[t]he statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and \r\n  fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design and policy of lawmakers.\" \r\n  (6)\r\n\r\nThe discovery provision of section 33-8-300(e) - \"when the cause of action is discovered or reasonably should have been\r\ndiscovered\" - provides that the two-year limitations period is triggered by either the actual or the constructive discovery of a\r\nbreach.  Implicit in the provision is the notion that either event, without regard to which occurs first, is sufficient to start the\r\ntwo-year limitation running.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we believe that, if the General Assembly had wished to provide for a minimum limitations period of three years, it\r\nwould have used language similar to that found in section 15-3-545(B). (7)  That statute, which provides for a limitations period\r\nfor cases in which a foreign object is left inside a patient after surgery, states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The action must be commenced within two years from \r\n    date of discovery or when it reasonably ought to have been discovered; provided, \r\n    that, in no event shall there be a limitation on the commencement of the action \r\n    less than three years after the placement or leaving of the appliance or apparatus. \r\n    (8) \r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the language used above, section 33-8-300(e) \r\n  provides for alternative limitations periods running from either the date of \r\n  accrual or the date of discovery. \r\n\r\nAbsent fraudulent concealment, the three-year period \r\n  establishes the maximum amount of time available to a plaintiff to bring a claim \r\n  under the statute. It applies in all cases where the plaintiff discovers his \r\n  cause of action more than one year but less than three years after accrual.\r\n\r\nRoof also argues that, at the very least, the statute \r\n  is ambiguous and, as such, it must be construed against the party seeking to \r\n  use it to bar the claim. He contends that where there is any doubt as to which \r\n  limitations period should apply, the conflict must be resolved in favor of the \r\n  longer period. (9) We find this argument unavailing.\r\n\r\n\"If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing\r\nrules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.\" (10) \r\n\r\nWe hold that section 33-8-300(e) requires a plaintiff to commence suit within either: (1) three years after the cause of action\r\naccrues; or (2) two years after the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should discover the breach.  Whichever period\r\noccurs or expires first controls.\r\n\r\nBecause Roof stipulates that twenty-seven months expired between the date of discovery and the date he commenced this\r\naction, his claim is untimely and barred by the statute of limitations. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur. \r\n1.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-80.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nAaron injured his back at work on May 8, 1995.  The injury was admitted by Employer, who provided medical treatment to Aaron by Dr. Edward Golay.  Dr.\r\nGolay, a family practice physician, was designated by Employer as Aaron's treating physician.  Dr. Golay treated Aaron on numerous occasions from the time\r\nshortly after Aaron's accident until December 1996. During this treatment, Dr. Golay referred Aaron for magnetic resonance imaging (\"MRI\") testing.  Dr. Ross\r\nD. Lynch, a specialist in orthopedics, ordered an MRI for Aaron.  The test was performed May 15, 1996.  Following the MRI, Dr. Lynch assigned Aaron a 5%\r\nimpairment rating and dismissed Aaron from his care on June 4, 1996.  Dr. Golay continued to treat Aaron.\r\n\r\nDr. Golay referred Aaron to Dr. Randall G. Drye, a neurosurgeon, in November 1996.  As a result of this referral, Dr. Drye examined Aaron and recommended\r\nsurgery.  Surgery was performed on Aaron's back on December 27, 1996.  Employer refused to pay for this procedure.  Following treatment, Dr. Drye informed\r\nAaron he could return to work, but Employer laid him off. \r\n\r\nIn January 1997, Aaron filed a Form 50 request for a hearing.  Aaron withdrew this request before the hearing took place. Aaron filed another Form 50 on June\r\n12, 1997.  By letter dated September 15, 1997, Employer requested Aaron attend a medical examination on September 30, 1997, pursuant to Â§ 42-15-80.  By\r\nletter dated September 29, 1997, Aaron's attorney stated Aaron could not attend on September 30, 1997, but would be available on or after October 5, 1997. \r\nEmployer rescheduled the exam for October 13, 1997; however, Aaron did not appear for this scheduled evaluation.\r\n\r\nBased on Aaron's refusal to submit to a medical evaluation, Employer filed a motion to compel Aaron to submit to the examination and to postpone the\r\nscheduled hearing pursuant to Â§ 42-15-80.  Aaron filed an objection to this motion. \r\n\r\nBy order dated October 17, 1997, the single commissioner summarily denied Employer's motion without hearing or argument. Employer filed a Form 30\r\nrequesting review by the full Commission.  However, pending this appeal, the single commissioner issued an order dated December 5, 1997, awarding Aaron\r\nworkers' compensation benefits based on a hearing held on October 23, 1997.  Employer filed an additional Form 30 request for review as a result of the\r\nDecember order. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, by order dated January 12, 1998, the single commissioner again denied Employer's motion to compel a medical evaluation or suspend the\r\nproceedings.  Employer filed a third Form 30 requesting full Commission review of the single commissioner's denial of its motion, although a hearing on the\r\nmerits had already taken place.\r\n\r\nThe three Form 30s were consolidated for appeal.  By order dated June 16, 1998, the full Commission reversed the single commissioner's orders dated October\r\n17, 1997 and January 12, 1998, finding Aaron's rights to compensation and to take or prosecute any proceedings against Employer were suspended by his\r\nfailure to submit to an independent medical examination (\"IME\"), as required by Â§ 42-15-80.  As a result of finding Aaron's right to prosecute was suspended,\r\nthe full Commission vacated the order of the single commissioner dated December 5, 1997, which awarded Aaron benefits, because the October 23, 1997,\r\nhearing was improperly convened.  Aaron appealed this order to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the decision of the full Commission.  This appeal follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n            Aaron argues the Circuit Court erred in affirming the full Commission's order, which held Aaron's rights to compensation and to take or prosecute any\r\nproceedings against Employer were suspended because of his failure to submit to a medical examination, as required by Â§ 42-15-80.  We agree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-15-80 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an injury and so long as he claims compensation, the employee, if so requested by his employer or ordered by the Commission, shall submit himself to\r\nexamination, at reasonable times and places, by a duly qualified physician or surgeon designated and paid by the employer or the Commission.  The employee\r\nshall have the right to have present at such examination any duly qualified physician or surgeon provided and paid by him.  No fact communicated to or\r\notherwise learned by any physician or surgeon who may have attended or examined the employee, or who may have been present at any examination, shall be\r\nprivileged, either in hearings provided for by this Title or any action at law brought to recover damages against any employer who may have accepted the\r\ncompensation provisions of this Title.  If the employee refuses to submit himself to or in any way obstructs such examination requested by and provided\r\nfor by the employer, his right to compensation and his right to take or prosecute any proceedings under this Title shall be suspended until such refusal\r\nor objection ceases and no compensation shall at any time be payable for the period of suspension unless in the opinion of the Commission the\r\ncircumstances justify the refusal or obstruction.  The employer or the Commission may in any case\r\nof death require an autopsy at the expense of the person requesting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court first addressed a claimant's refusal to submit to an IME in  Hill v.\r\nSkinner, 195 S.C. 330, 11 S.E.2d 386 (1940).  The  Hill Court recognized\r\nthe trial court's determination that where a claimant refuses to submit to a physical examination upon the request of the duly authorized agent of the employer\r\nand the court can find no justification for his refusal to submit to the examination, the mandatory provisions of Section 27 of Act No. 610, 1936 Acts 1231\r\n(\"Section 27\") (1) become operative and the claimant is not entitled to compensation for the period that elapsed between the time of his refusal and the time when\r\nsuch refusal ceased.   Id. at 338, 11 S.E.2d at 390. \r\n\r\nIn  Wardlaw v. J.G. Ridgeway Construction Co., 212 S.C. 116, 46 S.E.2d 662 (1948), the claimant was suffering from a back injury.  The physician desired to\r\nperform a spinal puncture on the claimant to complete his diagnosis.  The claimant averred he was afraid of the puncture and afraid \"to be worked on in the\r\nspinal part anywhere at all.\"   Id. at 119, 46 S.E.2d at 663. Further, he knew of people who had been disabled as the result of such treatment and a friend, he said,\r\nhad died from a \"spinal shot.\"   Id.  The Court held that where no medical evidence was submitted on the issue whether the spinal puncture was dangerous, the\r\nemployee was not justified in refusing to submit to the spinal puncture because of an unfounded fear of danger.\r\n Id. at 121, 46 S.E.2d at 664.\r\n\r\nThe first case in which the Supreme Court determined a claimant's refusal to submit to an examination was justified was\r\n Ward v. Dixie Shirt Co., 223 S.C. 448,\r\n76 S.E.2d 605 (1953).  In Ward, the claimant refused to undergo a spinal myelogram test by a Spartanburg neurosurgeon selected by her employer's insurer. \r\nThe claimant's primary care physician, the doctor initially assigned to claimant by her employer, believed the claimant's condition required the \"most expert\r\nneurological opinion\" and referred her to an orthopedic surgeon and a neurosurgeon at Emory University in Atlanta.  Id. at 453, 76 S.E.2d at 607.  The claimant\r\nwanted to pursue the course of treatment prescribed by her primary care physician.  The employer sought to suspend the claimant's compensation payments\r\nuntil the claimant reported to the Spartanburg neurosurgeon.  A single commissioner, finding the evidence relating to the claimant's condition warranted her\r\nrefusal to be treated by the employer's designated specialist,  denied the employer's request.\r\n  Id. at 454, 76 S.E.2d at 608.  The commissioner further ordered the\r\nemployer and its insurer to defray the claimant's costs of examination by the Emory surgeons.\r\n  Id.  The full Commission and Circuit Court affirmed.   Id.  Hence,\r\nthe claimant's rights under the Workmen's Compensation Act were not suspended for her refusal.  \r\n\r\nIn reaching its decision, the  Ward Court articulated the proper standard of review for the determination of justification on the part of the claimant.  The Court\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the facts are disputed and are subject to more than one reasonable inference as to whether the employee is justified in refusing to submit to an\r\nexamination requested by his employer, the conclusion of the Industrial Commission thereabout is final.  But where the circumstances warrant only one\r\nreasonable inference, the question becomes one of law rather than of fact and the decision of the Industrial Commission is subject to review.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 455, 76 S.E.2d at 608 (citation omitted). \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Court in  Singleton v. Young Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 114 S.E.2d 837 (1960), found the claimant's refusal to submit to a medical examination\r\nrequested by his employer was justified.  The claimant had previously seen three other physicians.  These physicians examined him, rated him as to his physical\r\nimpairment, and testified in the case.  The claimant fully cooperated with these doctors during his numerous visits to them, which often entailed the claimant\r\nmaking day-long trips to receive treatment.  In light of his cooperation, the Court found no reason to penalize the claimant due to his refusal to undergo\r\nadditional examination and testing.   Id. at 463, 114 S.E.2d at 841.\r\n\r\nIn  Ford v. Allied Chemical Corp., 252Â S.C.Â 561, 167 S.E.2d 564 (1969), the claimant had seriously injured his neck in a workplace accident.  He was put under\r\nthe care of the company doctor, a general practitioner.  The company doctor, determining the claimant's condition required the attention of a specialist, referred\r\nthe claimant to an orthopedic surgeon.  The claimant saw the specialist.  The claimant communicated his symptoms to the orthopedic surgeon; however, the\r\ndoctor was not \"impressed\" with the claimant's complaints and discharged him, suggesting he \"buy some aspirin and return to work.\"  Id. at 565, 167 S.E.2d at\r\n566.  Unsatisfied and continuing to suffer from pain, claimant sought the services of another orthopedic surgeon, whereby the claimant was admitted to the\r\nhospital.  The carrier for the employer demanded the claimant immediately put himself back under the company doctor's care.  The claimant did not comply\r\nwith this request.  The claimant later made a claim to the Industrial Commission for compensation and medical benefits.  The employer denied liability,\r\nasserting the claimant refused the treatment it had offered to him.  Upon its review, the Supreme Court upheld the determination, finding the claimant's lack of\r\nimprovement stemming from the employer's treatment justified the claimant's refusal of continued care at his employer's direction.  Id. at 567, 167 S.E.2d at\r\n567.  \r\n\r\nThis Court addressed the issue of an employee refusing employer-sponsored medical care in\r\n Scruggs v. Tuscarora Yarns, Inc.,294 S.C. 47, 362 S.E.2d 319 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1987).  In Scruggs, the employer scheduled a myelogram for the claimant who had injured her back at work.  The claimant was a 61-year-old with a heart\r\ncondition.  She was advised by her physician amyelogram was not to be taken lightly due to her age and health.  Additionally, the doctor told the claimant that\r\nsubsequent orthopedic surgery would likely not improve her condition.  She therefore did not pursue further care from the employer's physicians.  The single\r\ncommissioner found the claimant suffered a total and permanent disability of 50% and should receive weekly compensation for a period not to exceed 500\r\nweeks.   Id. at 49, 362 S.E.2d at 321.  The full Industrial Commission and Circuit Court affirmed.\r\n  Id. at 48, 362 S.E.2d at 320.   On appeal to the Court of\r\nAppeals, the employer contended the award was erroneous because the claimant did not submit to medical treatment.  This Court disagreed, finding sufficient\r\nevidence existed supporting the commission's findings that the claimant's refusal to accept treatment was justified due to its potential limited efficacy.\r\n  Id. at 50,\r\n362 S.E.2d at 321.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strikingly strange that Employer honored a referral of Aaron by Dr. Golay to Dr. Lynch, but would not approve Aaron's referral to Dr. Drye.  The record\r\nreveals Dr. Golay was the treating physician of Aaron.  Dr. Golay was Employer's physician.\r\n\r\nThe Commission, in its order, stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law as prescribed in the Workers' Compensation Act and the greater weight and preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that the Claimant\r\nunjustifiably refused to submit to a medical examination requested and provided for by the Defendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ruling by the Commission is conclusory at best.  There are no factual bases for the statement.  The order of the Commission is violative of the statute.  The\r\nstatute mandates the exercise of discretion in analyzing the factual scenario in totality.  Simply put, this was not done.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remand this matter to the Circuit Court to further remand to the full Workers' Compensation Commission for the purpose of making a factual\r\ndetermination, pursuant to Â§ 42-15-80, whether Aaron's refusal was justified under all of the surrounding circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons the order of the Circuit Court is \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.         \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Section 42-15-80 contains substantially the same language as Section 27 and all other subsequent code sections that required the submission of the claimant\r\nto independent medical examination.

Curcio, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Dennis M. Turner, $500,000 in a wrongful death action against\r\nCaterpillar, Inc.  The trial court later set the verdict aside and dismissed the complaint.  Curcio appeals.  We affirm.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nTurner worked as a heavy-equipment mechanic for Blanchard Machinery Company in Simpsonville, South Carolina.  On March 23, 1994, he was crushed to\r\ndeath while performing maintenance on a Caterpillar 953 Track Loader.\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar 953 Track Loader operates on a series of hydraulic pumps.  The cab of the loader is located over the engine and pumps.  To remove the engine\r\nfor repairs, the cab must be tilted forward.  The Caterpillar Disassembly &amp; Assembly Manual gives instructions for tilting the cab to either 24 degrees or 90\r\ndegrees.  At either position, the cab is bolted to the frame of the machine to hold it in place, and brace bars are provided for this purpose.  If the cab is not bolted\r\nto the frame, it is chained to the front implement of the machine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the manual, the engine can be started when the cab is tilted to 24 degrees, but the transmission stays in a neutral position.  In contrast, the manual\r\nhas the following warning for tilting the cab to 90 degrees:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not start the engine when the cab/ROPS/platform (1) is at\r\n900.  The governor control, implement hydraulics, speed-direction and speed-brake\r\nlinkages are disconnected when the cab/ROPS/platform is tilted to 900.  If the valve spools were moved either accidentally or intentionally when the\r\nlinkages were disconnected, uncontrolled lift arm and/or track movement will occur when the engine is started.  As a result, it is possible for the brace\r\ngroup which retains the cabs/ROPS/platform to fail.  This can result in severe injury to a serviceman or to bystanders and/or damage to the machine.\r\n\r\nIf the engine must be started, first, lower the cab to 240 reconnect to the hydraulic jack, and install the support bracket. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Boldface in original.)  In addition, a warning in boldface print appears near the beginning of the manual advising service personnel to \"[d]isconnect batteries\r\nbefore performance of any service work.\"\r\n\r\nAs noted in the manual, various warnings appear on the loader itself.  Located adjacent to where the brace is bolted to the frame when the loader is tilted to 24\r\ndegrees is the following alert:\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PERSONAL INJURY CAN OCCUR IF IMPROPER PLATFORM TILTING PROCEDURES ARE USED.  SEE MAINTENANCE GUIDE FOR\r\nPROCEDURE TO TILT PLATFORM TO THE 24  POSITION.\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       Before raising platform, remove control linkage pins to prevent damage to the linkage.\r\n     Install platform support link properly before any work is done on or under the raised platform to ensure it will not fall.\r\n     Reinstall and properly tighten the ROPS mounting bolts to prevent reduction of rollover protection.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSEE SERVICE MANUAL PROCEDURE TO TILT PLATFORM TO THE 900 POSITION.  DO NOT RUN THE ENGINE WITH THE PLATFORM TILTED\r\nTO THE 900  POSITION.  LIFT ARMS MAY RAISE AND COULD BREAK PLATFORM 900 SUPPORT BRACKET AND PLATFORM WILL FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Boldface in original, underlining added.)\r\n\r\nTo remove the engine for repairs, Turner had the cab tilted to an angle greater than 90 degrees so that it rested on the tilt cylinders in a \"laid-over\" position.\r\nAlthough Caterpillar did not include this procedure in the manual, several mechanics testified that they chose to use it because it appeared less precarious than\r\nthe 90-degree position and required less time.  Dr. Jeffrey Warren, Curcio's mechanical engineering expert witness, testified that, in the 90-degree position, the\r\n1,933-pound cab is held in place by only the installation of a small bracket with a single bolt.  In contrast, Warren testified that 1,148 pounds of force would be\r\nnecessary to pick up the cab from its laid-over position and cause it to tip over onto the person working beneath it.\r\n\r\nContrary to the practice of other mechanics who used the laid-over position, Turner did not chain the cab.  Furthermore, he apparently made no attempt to bolt\r\nthe cab to the frame.  It appears that, after removing and overhauling the engine of the loader, Turner was crushed to death beneath the cab while he was\r\npreparing to insert the engine back into the loader.  No one saw the accident happen.\r\n\r\nTurner's coworkers discovered his body lying between the transmission and the cab.  Mechanics observed that the battery disconnect key was in the ignition\r\nswitch in the \"on\" position and the batteries were connected.  The loader bucket, which had earlier been down, was raised because an implement control lever\r\nwas inadvertently moved to the \"raise\" position, activating the hydraulic system.   Investigators surmised that the lift arms and bucket moved, causing the cab to\r\nfall on Turner.  Mechanic Ben Samuel testified that, if Turner had used the 24-degree brace, the brace would have caught the cab and the accident would not\r\nhave happened.\r\n\r\nCurcio, in her capacity as personal representative of Turner's estate,  filed this action asserting claims for negligence, strict liability, and breach of implied\r\nwarranty.  She later voluntarily dismissed the warranty claim and proceeded to trial on the two remaining claims.\r\n\r\nCurcio argued Caterpillar was negligent in designing and  manufacturing the loader and in failing to warn of foreseeable dangers associated with its use and\r\nmaintenance.  Curcio further contended the loader was unreasonably dangerous because of the absence of an electrical interlock device that allegedly could\r\nhave prevented the accident.\r\n\r\nCaterpillar took the position that Turner disregarded warnings to disconnect the batteries and secure the cab properly.  In response to these contentions, Curcio\r\ncalled Warren, who testified the warning on the loader not to \"run\" the engine was inadequate because it fell short of cautioning service personnel not to \"crank\"\r\nthe engine.  Warren stated that, to him, \"there's a big difference from a mechanic's point of view as to whether he's cranking the engine or running the engine.\" \r\nWarren also testified that an electrical interlock device would have prevented the accident and that the cost for including such a device would most likely have\r\nbeen minimal.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Curcio's case, Caterpillar moved unsuccessfully for a directed verdict arguing:  (1) the warnings on the loader were adequate and Turner's failure\r\nto follow those warnings was the proximate cause of his death, and (2) an interlock device was not only unnecessary but ineffective in that it would only disable\r\nthe ignition switch, which would necessarily have been disconnected once the cab was tilted past 90 degrees.  At the close of the testimony, Caterpillar renewed\r\nits motion on the same grounds stated in its initial motion, but elaborated on them by further submitting that:  (1) the interlock device would not have prevented\r\nTurner's death because of evidence that Turner had bypassed the electrical system, (2) and (2) the failure to use the term \"crank\" in the warning was not evidence\r\nthat the warning was deficient.  Again, the trial court denied the motion and submitted the issues of negligence and strict liability to the jury.  The jury found for\r\nCaterpillar on the negligence action, but awarded Curcio $500,000 on her strict liability claim.\r\n\r\nCaterpillar moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial.  The trial court granted a new trial on the marital relationship between Curcio and\r\nTurner. (3)  In addition, the trial court held that the warnings were adequate as a matter of law, but found there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict\r\nbased on the defective design claim.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a subsequent motion by Caterpillar under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, however, the trial court reviewed the matter and set the verdict aside, holding, \"South\r\nCarolina law does not require that a manufacturer refine a product, if it is safe when used in accordance with adequate warnings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurcio first argues the trial court's decision to set the verdict aside should be reversed because she presented evidence at trial that the warning was inadequate.\r\nSpecifically, she contends the trial court impermissibly weighed the evidence in discounting Warren's testimony that the warning was ambiguous.  We reject\r\nthis argument.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 73 of Title 15 of the South Carolina Code, the South Carolina General Assembly adopted verbatim section 402A of the\r\n Restatement, Second, of\r\nTorts (1965) to provide as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm\r\ncaused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(a) The seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and\r\n\r\n(b) It is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(2) The rule stated in subsection (1) shall apply although\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(a) The seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and\r\n\r\n(b) The user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller. (4)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe comments to section 402A have been incorporated by reference as the legislative intent of Chapter 73. (5)  Citing comment j, this court has stated that \"a\r\nseller may prevent a product from being 'unreasonably dangerous' if the seller places an adequate warning on the product regarding its use.\" (6)\r\n\r\nThe trial court initially denied Caterpillar's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, holding there was sufficient evidence to support Curcio's recovery\r\nunder the defective design claim.  In the same order, however, the trial court held the warnings at issue were adequate as a matter of law.  In its subsequent\r\norder setting the verdict aside, the trial court rejected the design failure claim, holding this claim was likewise barred because of the earlier decision on the\r\nwarning theory. \r\n\r\nIn holding the warning to be adequate as a matter of law, the trial court not only addressed Warren's assertion that the failure to use the word \"crank\" in the\r\nwarning made it deficient, but also noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore working on a Loader, a mechanic is specifically warned to: \"Disconnect batteries before performance of any service work.\"  Turner chose to ignore this\r\nwarning.  At the time of the accident, Turner was working on the Track Loader with the batteries connected.\r\n  Had the batteries been disconnected the accident\r\nwould not have happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)  We find nothing in the record or the briefs suggesting that Curcio has challenged either the substance or the propriety of this ruling.  The\r\nmanner in which this ruling was set forth by the trial court indicates the ruling was intended as an alternative basis to support the holding that the warning was\r\nadequate as a matter of law notwithstanding the impact of Warren's testimony on this issue.  Because the trial court's ultimate conclusion on the sufficiency of\r\nthe warning can be upheld on an independent ground, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether or not the trial court impermissibly discounted Warren's\r\nstatements. (7)\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nCurcio further maintains that, irrespective of the efficacy of the warnings, she made a showing that a proposed alternative design that could have prevented\r\nTurner's death was available and economically feasible.  Based on this premise, she argues she presented sufficient evidence at trial to raise an issue of fact as to\r\nwhether the loader was defectively designed and therefore unreasonably dangerous.  She further argues that, because the cost of including an interlock device\r\nwould have been minimal compared with the cost of the loader itself, the loader could have been made safer without the necessity of a warning and was\r\ntherefore defectively designed.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn determining the verdict should be set aside based on its prior findings that the warnings were adequate as a matter of law, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiff urges adoption of the  Restatement (Third) of\r\nTorts, which allows recovery based on defective design even with an adequate warning.  Defendant has\r\ndemanded adherence to existing South Carolina law.  This court declines Plaintiff's invitation.  The language in\r\n Allen v. Long Mfg. is clear.  If the Court of\r\nAppeals desires a retreat from  Allen v. Long Mfg. by, for example, characterizing parts of its opinion as dicta, that is a matter for the Court of Appeals, not a\r\nmere trial judge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining that an adequate warning made the loader safe for use in spite of any alleged defects, the trial court relied on comment j to section 402A of\r\nthe Restatement (Second) of Torts, as interpreted in Allen. (8)  We have found no cases from this jurisdiction that contradict either comment j or the interpretation\r\nof this comment in  Allen (9); therefore, we conclude the trial court correctly applied existing South Carolina law to hold that a product is not unreasonably\r\ndangerous if accompanied by adequate warnings that, if followed, make the product safe for use. (10)\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nCurcio further argues \"the trial court had already established as the law of the case that [she] could recover if\r\n either a defective warning  or a defective design\r\nwere found to be the proximate cause of . . . Turner's death.\" (Emphasis in original.)  In support of her position, Curcio notes that Caterpillar did not base its\r\ndirected verdict motion on the proposition that the finding of an adequate warning \"cured\" any design defects and rendered its product \"safe\" and that\r\nCaterpillar never objected to jury instructions that liability could be based on either defective warning or unreasonably dangerous design.  We find no merit to\r\nthese arguments.\r\n\r\nIn our view, Caterpillar's contention in its directed verdict motion that the warning was adequate as matter of law was sufficient to raise the argument that\r\nCurcio would likewise be precluded from recovering for a design defect.  First, in its initial directed verdict motion, the grounds of which were incorporated\r\ninto its final directed verdict motion, Caterpillar cited the case of  Anderson v. Green Bull for the proposition that a product bearing a warning that is safe for use\r\nif the user follows the warning is \"neither defective nor unreasonably dangerous.\" (11)  Furthermore, \"a product that is already deemed safe for consumer use as\r\nproduced need not display a warning to prevent it from being 'unreasonably dangerous,' absent a finding that there is a duty to warn.\" (12)  It follows that, in a\r\nproducts liability case in which the theory of recovery is strict liability, the only inference of any import to be made from a finding that a given warning is\r\nadequate is that the product \"is not in defective condition nor is it unreasonably dangerous.\" (13)\r\n\r\nWe further hold that, under the circumstances of this case, it was not incumbent on Caterpillar to object to the instruction by the trial court that the jury could\r\n\"consider separately and independently two alternative theories of liability:  defect by adequate warning, and defect by lack of a reasonable safety device which\r\ncould have prevented the accident.\" \r\n\r\nAlthough the trial court characterized the theories of inadequate warning and design defect as \"independent bases on which to impose liability,\" it included the\r\nfollowing instructions in its charge on strict liability:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent a product from being unreasonably dangerous, a manufacturer may be required to give an adequate warning concerning the product\r\nregarding its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIf a warning is required, a product bearing an adequate warning is neither defective nor unreasonably dangerous. . . . Where an adequate warning is given, the\r\nmanufacturer may reasonably assume it will be read and heeded; and a product bearing an adequate warning, which is safe for use if followed, is not in a\r\ndefective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead as a whole, then, the charge correctly explained that, if the jury found that the product came with adequate warnings, it followed that the product was\r\nneither in a defective condition nor unreasonably dangerous. (14)  It was therefore reasonable for Caterpillar to expect that, even if the jury found that the loader\r\nhad a design defect, there would still be no liability if the warning was adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause we have affirmed the trial court based on our determination that Curcio failed as a matter of law to show that the Caterpillar 953 Track Loader was a\r\ndefective or unreasonably dangerous product, we do not address her arguments concerning proximate cause. (15)\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs.  HEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:  I respectfully dissent.  The majority holds that the accident would not have occurred had Turner heeded the warning to disconnect the batteries\r\nand treats this finding by the trial judge as an alternate sustaining ground on which to affirm the grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  The logic seems\r\nto be that after Caterpillar provided one clear warning that was disregarded, any subsequent warning is immune from a determination of adequacy.  I disagree.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Caterpillar foresaw that the batteries might be connected during maintenance work.  The warning contested by Curcio states in part, \"If the engine\r\nmust be started, . . . .\"  Such an instruction contradicts the instruction that the batteries must be disconnected at all times during maintenance work.  Given this\r\ncontradiction, it does not follow that failure to follow one warning should preclude Curcio's argument concerning another warning.  Moreover, the mere fact\r\nthat Caterpillar warned against starting the engine is evidence that it knew its admonition about disconnecting the batteries might not be followed.  Thus, I do\r\nnot share the majority's view that the  warning to disconnect the batteries vitiated any further duty by Caterpillar to provide adequate warnings.\r\n\r\nI would hold that a jury issue was presented as to the adequacy of the warning.  At trial, Curcio presented expert testimony distinguishing the words \"crank,\r\n\"run,\" and \"start.\"  The disputed words are all used in different ways throughout the manual.  The expert testified that given the use of the words in the manual\r\nand the trade usage, Turner may have thought he could \"crank\" the engine if he did not \"start\" it. (16)  No objection was lodged to the admission of this testimony\r\nor to the expert's qualifications.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the adequacy of a warning is a jury question.   Allen v. Long Mfg. NC,\r\nInc., 332 S.C. 422, 427, 505 S.E.2d 354, 357 (Ct. App. 1998);  see 63A Am.\r\nJur. 2d  Products Liability Â§ 1219 (1997).  Here, the trial judge correctly sent this issue to the jury.  However, I believe he erred in granting judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict.  \r\n\r\nIn his order, the trial judge appears to have weighed the evidence in determining that the warnings were adequate as a matter of law, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reasonable person (and certainly no mechanic like Turner) would adopt Mr. Warren's strained distinction between 'start' and 'crank.'  Although not essential\r\nfor purposes of this ruling, I note that Mr. Warren has absolutely no experience with heavy equipment.  Conversely all witnesses with such experience\r\nunderstood the term 'start' to include any notion the engine was to be turned over by the electrical starter motor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial judge is concerned only with the existence of evidence, not its weight.\r\n  State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 196, 473 S.E.2d 831, 835 (Ct. App. 1996).  \"When considering the motion, neither this court nor the trial court has authority to decide\r\ncredibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.\"   Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv.,\r\nInc., 330 S.C. 617, 634, 500 S.E.2d 145, 154 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998).  Moreover, we will not disturb the factual findings of a jury unless no evidence reasonably supports those findings.\r\n  Horry County v. Laychur, 315\r\nS.C. 364, 367, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993).  Therefore, I believe the trial judge erred in overturning the jury's verdict based on his own assessment of the evidence.\r\n\r\nFurther, I believe the issue of whether the design was defective was also properly submitted to the jury.  The majority, relying on language from Allen and\r\ncomment j to Â§ 402A of the  Restatement (Second) of Torts, states that a product may be cured of any unreasonable danger if the seller places an adequate\r\nwarning on the product.  However, because I disagree with the majority's alternate sustaining ground and would hold that a jury issue as to the adequacy of the\r\nwarning was created by the expert's testimony, I disagree with the majority's holding that the product was not unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, I would reverse the trial judge's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict and reinstate the jury's verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   ROPS is an abbreviation for rollover protective structure.\r\n\r\n2.   Caterpillar contended that Turner had bypassed the electrical system by hot-wiring the starter.\r\n\r\n3.   The trial court had initially ruled Caterpillar was precluded from contesting the legal relationship between Curcio and Turner because of a finding by the\r\nprobate court that Curcio and Turner were common-law husband and wife.  Pursuant to Caterpillar's motion, the trial court reversed this ruling, noting the\r\nprobate court proceeding was an uncontested matter to which Caterpillar had not been made a party.\r\n\r\n4.

We dismiss \r\n  the appeal because the order appealed is interlocutory and not immediately appealable. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nNelson Brown filed this action alleging the superintendent \r\n  of the school district, John L. Kinlaw, improperly allowed his wife to be employed \r\n  under his supervision pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-13-750 (Supp. 2000). The \r\n  school district moved for summary judgment which was denied. The trial court \r\n  then granted the school district's motion to transfer the case to the non-jury \r\n  docket, and Brown appeals. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBrown argues he was entitled to a jury trial on \r\n  his various causes of action. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Johnson v. South Carolina National Bank, \r\n  the defendant's motion to transfer the case to the non-jury roster was granted \r\n  by the trial court because the plaintiffs were pursuing an equitable remedy. \r\n  292 S.C. 51, 53, 354 S.E.2d 895, 895 (1987). The supreme court affirmed, noting \r\n  the main purpose of the action was rescission, an equitable remedy for which \r\n  there is no right to a jury trial. Id. at 53, 354 S.E.2d at 895-96; see \r\n  also Williford v. Downs, 265 S.C. 319, 321, 218 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1975) \r\n  (\"In equity the parties are not entitled, as a matter of right, to a trial by \r\n  jury.\").\r\n\r\n\"An order denying a party a jury trial is not immediately \r\n  appealable unless it deprives him of a mode of trial to which he is entitled \r\n  as a matter of right.\" C&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S Real Estate Servs. v. Massengale, \r\n  290 S.C. 299, 300, 350 S.E.2d 191, 192 (1986). In that case, appellant appealed \r\n  an order denying her a jury trial on all but one of six counterclaims she asserted \r\n  in a mortgage foreclosure action. Id. at 300, 350 S.E.2d at 192. The \r\n  trial court's order did not deprive her of a mode of trial she was entitled \r\n  to as a matter of right, since her claims were equitable in nature. Id. \r\n  at 300-01, 350 S.E.2d at 192-93. Therefore, the supreme court granted the motion \r\n  to dismiss the appeal. Id.\r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, unlike C &amp; S Real Estate, \r\n  no motion to dismiss the appeal was made. However, we noted in Bunkum v. \r\n  Manor Properties \"issues relating to subject matter jurisdiction may be \r\n  raised at any time . . . and should be taken notice of by this court on our \r\n  own motion.\" 321 S.C. 95, 99-100, 467 S.E.2d 758, 761 (Ct. App. 1996). \"Where \r\n  an order is interlocutory, and thus not appealable, the notice of intent to \r\n  appeal does not transfer jurisdiction to the [appellate] [c]ourt . . .\" South \r\n  Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Arnold, 287 S.C. 584, 586, 340 S.E.2d 535, \r\n  536 (1986).\r\n\r\nThe remedies sought by Brown are clearly equitable \r\n  in nature. He sought rescission of the contract between Kinlaw's wife and the \r\n  school district, and restitution by her of any compensation she had already \r\n  received. Further, he sought \"[o]ther equitable relief the Court deems proper\" \r\n  and stated in response to the school district's interrogatories, \"This is an \r\n  action in equity.\" The trial court concluded Brown's case was \"purely an equitable \r\n  action.\" There is no right to a jury trial for equitable remedies such as rescission \r\n  and restitution. Johnson, 292 S.C. at 53, 354 S.E.2d at 895-96 (stating \r\n  rescission is an equitable remedy for which there is no right to a jury trial); \r\n  see also Wallace v.

Thomas appeals. We affirm. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1999, the assistant principal at \r\n  Wilson High School received word that Thomas had a gun in his possession. In \r\n  an effort to discover whether Thomas did have a gun, the assistant principal \r\n  called Thomas to her office. Also present in the office was Deputy Graham. Graham \r\n  testified that as he patted Thomas down, he felt a large bulge in Thomas' pocket \r\n  consistent with a pistol. Graham then retrieved the gun from Thomas' pocket. \r\n  Graham also retrieved nine bullets. The cylinder of the gun was not attached \r\n  to the remainder of the gun, and the pin that holds the cylinder in place was \r\n  missing. \r\n\r\nThomas was charged with violating South Carolina \r\n  Code section 16-23-430, (2) carrying a weapon \r\n  on school grounds, and South Carolina Code section 16-23-30(e), \r\n  (3) possessing a gun while under the age of twenty-one. At the close \r\n  of the State's case, Thomas moved for a directed verdict. The trial court denied \r\n  Thomas' motion and found him delinquent. The court sentenced Thomas to the custody \r\n  of the Department of Juvenile Justice for a period not to extend beyond his \r\n  twenty-first birthday.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Thomas argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict because the gun was not operational and\r\ntherefore could not inflict bodily injury or death.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 16-23-430(1) states:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, except State, county or municipal law-enforcement officers or personnel authorized by\r\nschool officials, to carry on his person, while on any elementary or secondary school property, a knife, with a blade over two\r\ninches long, a blackjack, a metal pipe or pole, firearms or any other type of weapon, device or object which may be used to\r\ninflict bodily injury or death. (4)\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas argues that a violation of the statute does not occur when a person brings an inoperative firearm onto school grounds\r\nbecause said firearm would be unable \"to inflict bodily injury or death.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument is without merit. Under section 16-23-430(1), \r\n  it is a per se violation to bring a firearm onto school grounds, regardless \r\n  of whether it may be used to inflict bodily injury or death. The same is true \r\n  with a knife that has a blade over two inches, a blackjack, or a metal pipe \r\n  or pole. Instead, it is \"any other type of device or object\" that must be capable \r\n  of inflicting bodily injury or death. \r\n\r\nThis reading is consistent with our prior interpretation \r\n  of the statute. In In the Interest of David G., \r\n  (5) this court addressed whether a student could be convicted under \r\n  the statute for bringing a razor blade that contained a blade of less than two \r\n  inches. In upholding the decision of the family court, we noted that while the \r\n  razor blade was not a per se violation of the \r\n  statute because it was not a knife with a blade longer than two inches, we held \r\n  that it was an object that could be used to inflict bodily injury or death. \r\n  (6) \r\n\r\nBecause a firearm is a per se violation \r\n  of the statute, the family court properly denied Thomas' motion for a directed \r\n  verdict. After review of the record as required by Anders v. California \r\n  (7) and State v. Williams, (8) \r\n  we find no other arguable issues. We also grant counsel's petition to be relieved.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

Chisholm, shareholders of Seaside Development Corporation (Seaside), \r\n  filed this action against the corporation's directors and officers and a shareholder \r\n  corporation, alleging common law breach of fiduciary duty, violation of statutory \r\n  standards for directors, corporate oppression, and violation of preemptive rights. \r\n  The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Dawkins \r\n  and Chisholm appeal, arguing the trial court erred in excluding their expert's \r\n  affidavit, in refusing to treat their verified complaint as an affidavit, in \r\n  resolving issues of fact, and in granting summary judgment before discovery \r\n  could be completed. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nAll of the parties are shareholders of Seaside. \r\n  The defendants were, at all times relevant to the plaintiffs' allegations, directors \r\n  of Seaside, with the exception of Seaside itself and DIA-Dick Realty Co., a \r\n  company owned and controlled by Richard E. Fields. Additionally, three of the \r\n  defendants were officers of the corporation.\r\n\r\nSeaside was established in 1959 for the purpose \r\n  of acquiring and holding real estate on Hilton Head Island. The company purchased \r\n  a large tract of land on the island. On January 23, 1996, after months of negotiations, \r\n  Seaside entered into an agreement to sell the property to the Town of Hilton \r\n  Head for $1,200,000.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs filed this action, individually \r\n  and on behalf of Seaside, on July 28, 1998. In their verified complaint, the \r\n  plaintiffs allege the defendants, knowing that the property was going to be \r\n  sold, sold themselves additional shares of Seaside stock in a scheme to increase \r\n  their proportional ownership of the corporation. They claim that for $100 per \r\n  share the defendants sold themselves 180 shares on August 1, 1995, 205 shares \r\n  on January 17, 1996, and 330 shares on July 16, 1996. (1) \r\n  The plaintiffs assert that the defendants lacked an adequate business purpose \r\n  for issuing the shares in question and that better alternatives for raising \r\n  capital existed. Furthermore, the plaintiffs claim the defendants issued the \r\n  shares without adequate disclosure to the remaining shareholders \"and in a manner \r\n  that prevented other shareholders from understanding the transaction and its \r\n  ramifications on those in control and [on] minority shareholders.\" Finally, \r\n  the plaintiffs aver that on September 21, 1996, and October 24, 1997, the defendants \r\n  declared two 100-percent dividends on Seaside's outstanding shares. The plaintiffs \r\n  contend the defendants' actions violated both common law and statutory duties \r\n  imposed upon them as directors and officers.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1998, the plaintiffs filed their first discovery requests.  On September 14, 1998, the defendants filed an answer\r\ndenying any wrongdoing.  The defendants also counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for alleged wrongdoings.  \r\n\r\nOn October 20, 1998, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  They attached an \"exhibit book\" with their motion\r\nthat contained documents supporting their motion.  On October 23, 1998, the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel discovery\r\nbecause the defendants had not answered the August 26 discovery requests.  \r\n\r\nOn November 6, the plaintiffs moved for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing on the grounds that they had not had\r\nan opportunity to conduct discovery and that the defendants had been uncooperative in discovery requests to date. \r\nAlternatively, the plaintiffs asked the trial court to deny the summary judgment motion because it was premature. \r\n\r\nOn November 16, 1998, the trial court held a hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the plaintiffs'\r\nmotion for a continuance.  In opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs submitted their\r\nverified complaint and the affidavit of Professor John Freeman, an expert on corporations and securities.\r\nJust prior to the\r\nhearing, the defendants answered the August discovery requests.\r\n\r\nBy order dated April 1, 1999, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a continuance and granted the defendants' motion for\r\nsummary judgment.  The court refused to consider the plaintiffs' expert affidavit, concluding the affidavit contained legal\r\nopinions and conclusions rather than specific facts as required by Rule 56(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. \r\nAdditionally, the court questioned whether the expert had reviewed the entire record.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs moved to alter or amend the order granting summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that the court erred\r\nin (1) excluding the affidavit and (2) failing to consider their verified complaint as an affidavit for purposes of the summary\r\njudgment motion.  In an order denying the plaintiffs' motion, the court concluded that the plaintiffs' attempt to use the verified\r\ncomplaint as an affidavit \"does not comport with South Carolina law\" and that even if it did, the allegations were too\r\nconclusory to constitute admissible evidence.  As to the expert affidavit, the court reiterated its earlier conclusion that the\r\naffidavit constituted an opinion on the law rather than a presentation of facts. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\r\nof law. (2)  \"Summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts if there is dispute\r\nas to the conclusions to be drawn from those facts.\" (3)  \"In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and\r\nall inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\nparty.\" (4)  Summary judgment should be invoked cautiously to avoid improperly denying a party a trial on the disputed factual\r\nissues. (5)\r\n\r\nThe Verified Complaint\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in refusing to accept their verified complaint as an affidavit for purposes of\r\nsummary judgment.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe trial court held that the plaintiff's attempted use of their verified complaint as an affidavit did \"not comport with South\r\nCarolina law.\"  The trial court, however, cited no authority for this conclusion and failed to identify in what way the practice\r\nwould not comport with South Carolina law.\r\n\r\nAlthough our courts have not specifically addressed whether a verified complaint is the equivalent of an affidavit for purposes\r\nof summary judgment,  Rule 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure is identical to its federal counterpart.  In the\r\nabsence of state law on the issue in question, federal cases interpreting the rule are persuasive. (6)\r\n\r\nFederal courts addressing the issue have held that for the purposes of summary judgment, a verified complaint is the equivalent\r\nof an affidavit, provided that the verified complaint meets the requirements of Rule 56(e). (7)  Likewise, numerous state courts\r\nhave held that a verified complaint is the equivalent of an affidavit for summary judgment purposes. (8)  Moreover, our review of\r\nSouth Carolina cases leads us to believe that such a result is consistent with South Carolina law. (9)  Accordingly, we hold that\r\nfor summary judgment purposes, a verified pleading is equivalent to an affidavit, provided it meets the requirements of Rule\r\n56(e).  \r\n\r\nUnder Rule 56(e), an affidavit or verified complaint must meet three criteria to be considered by the court: (1) it must be made\r\nupon personal knowledge; (2) it must set forth facts admissible in evidence; (3) it  must show that the affiant is competent to\r\ntestify to the matters stated therein.\r\n\r\nThe verification in the present case states:\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONALLY APPEARED before me, Lamar W. Dawkins, who being duly sworn, deposes and says:  that he is one of the\r\nPlaintiffs, in the foregoing action, that he has read the within Complaint, and that the facts are true of his own knowledge,\r\nexcept those matters and things therein alleged upon information and belief, and as to those, he believes them to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the requirements of Rule 56(e) are met.  First, the verification states that the facts are made upon personal knowledge. \r\nSecond, in reading the complaint, while some averments are conclusory and should not be considered facts admissible in\r\nevidence, other statements are factual and would be admissible.  Finally, the verification identifies Dawkins as a plaintiff in the\r\naction; therefore, he is competent to testify. (10)\r\n\r\nThe Expert's Affidavit\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs next argue the trial court erred in refusing to consider Professor Freeman's affidavit.  We agree.\r\n\r\nWe first note that, contrary to the defendants' contention, Professor Freeman's affidavit is based on his personal knowledge.  In\r\nhis affidavit, Professor Freeman states that, in evaluating and forming opinions about the case,  he reviewed the pleadings, the\r\nsummary judgment motion itself, and the documents that the defendants submitted in support of their motion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Professor Freeman's affidavit contains numerous fact-based opinions that constitute admissible evidence.  Our\r\nrules of evidence specifically permit the admission of an expert's opinion when it will assist the fact finder in understanding the\r\nevidence or determining a fact in issue. (11)  Moreover, an expert's otherwise admissible opinion is not inadmissible simply\r\nbecause it embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact (12) or simply because it expresses opinions and\r\ninferences. (13)\r\n\r\nGenuine Issue of Material Fact\r\n\r\nWe now address whether there is a genuine issue of material fact.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\nplaintiffs, the record shows the following:  \r\n\r\nIn January 1996, Seaside contracted to sell its primary asset, a tract of land, for $1,200,000.  Prior to the sale, the defendants\r\npurchased a total of 400 additional shares of stock in Seaside for $100 per share (par value) despite the fact that the shares were\r\nworth $800 per share.  The defendants asserted the stock sale was necessary to raise capital in order to pay off $35,000 worth of\r\ndebt. Several months after the last issuance, Seaside paid a 100-percent dividend on its shares of stock.  Approximately\r\nthirteen months later, Seaside again paid a 100 per cent dividend on all outstanding shares.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs contend the defendants failed to give them adequate notice of the stock sale and this failure constituted a fraud\r\nupon them and the corporation.  In addition, the plaintiffs allege the defendants' failure to provide full and fair disclosure\r\nprevented them from exercising their preemptive rights. (14)  In support of their argument that the notice was insufficient, the\r\nplaintiffs presented Freeman's affidavit wherein Freeman states that, in his expert opinion, the notice was insufficient, and that\r\nthe stock sale was a scheme designed to \"enrich the insiders at the expense of the company and the other shareholders.\" \r\nFreeman further stated that in his opinion, the defendants' acts constituted a fraud upon the company and shareholders in\r\nviolation of South Carolina Code section 35-1-1210. (15)\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs also allege the stock sale was done to enrich the defendants at the expense of the plaintiffs and the corporation. \r\nIn support of this argument, the plaintiffs note that, in September 1996, Seaside paid a $100 dividend on its stock, allowing the\r\ndefendants to reap a 100-percent profit on those shares  purchased just months earlier.  Freeman opined that the ability to pay a\r\n100-percent dividend so closely following the issuance of the stock raised serious doubts as to Seaside's need to raise capital\r\nand thus cast doubt on the reason the stock was sold.  Freeman further stated that the ability to pay such a dividend evidenced\r\nself-dealing and a breach of the defendants' fiduciary duties. (16)  \r\n\r\nFinally, we note that the plaintiffs also brought this action as a derivative suit.  In examining the record on appeal, there is a\r\nquestion of fact regarding the fairness of the price of the stock and the payment of the dividends.\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants.  In light of our ruling, we need not address the\r\nplaintiffs' remaining arguments.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n1.
