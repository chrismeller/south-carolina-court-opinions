Durney and Walter \r\n  J. Durney, Jr. Lisa's father, Xen K. Motsinger, was also named as a defendant \r\n  because the Durneys lived on property owned by Motsinger. The alleged incident \r\n  occurred off the premises of the Durneys. The circuit court granted Motsinger's \r\n  motion for summary judgment, finding as a matter of law that he was not liable \r\n  for the minor's alleged injuries. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nOn January 2, 1998, Kinsli was visiting \r\n  a neighbor next door to the Durneys' residence at 212 Sausage Lane in West Columbia \r\n  when she was allegedly bitten by the Durneys' black Chow named \"Buffalo\" while \r\n  in the neighbor's yard.(1) There were no witnesses \r\n  to the incident. The Durneys have owned the Chow since it was a puppy. The Durneys \r\n  are the sole owners and caregivers of the dog.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBruce and her daughter live next \r\n  door to the Durneys. The Durneys have resided in the home since 1988. The property \r\n  is approximately three quarters of an acre. Motsinger is the father of Lisa \r\n  Durney, and he has been the record owner of the property since approximately \r\n  1995. The Durneys originally owned the property but transferred it to Motsinger \r\n  after they experienced financial difficulties. Motsinger did not charge his \r\n  daughter any rent and the parties had no lease. Motsinger does not live on the \r\n  property; rather, he has resided for forty years in his own home in Cayce. However, \r\n  he visits his daughter and grandchildren an average of once a week. Motsinger \r\n  was not present when the child was allegedly bitten.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBruce brought this action on behalf \r\n  of her daughter against the Durneys as the dog's owners and against Motsinger \r\n  because he was the record owner of the property. Bruce alleged Motsinger knew \r\n  or reasonably should have known of the dangerous condition created by the Durneys \r\n  allowing their dog to be unrestrained and that he failed to take action as the \r\n  landowner to remedy the condition. She alleged Motsinger had the right to control \r\n  the activities of the Durneys because they lived on property owned by him and \r\n  he negligently failed to do so.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMotsinger answered, denying the allegations, \r\n  and subsequently moved for summary judgment. The circuit court granted Motsinger's \r\n  motion for summary judgment. The court held, as a matter of law, that a landlord \r\n  or property owner cannot be held liable to a third person for the attack of \r\n  an animal owned by the tenant or resident living on the owner's property. The \r\n  court held that even if Motsinger was not considered to be a landlord to the \r\n  Durneys, (because of the absence of a lease and rental payments), its ruling \r\n  would be the same because S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110 (1987) provides a dog owner \r\n  or a person caring for or keeping a dog is liable if the dog bites or otherwise \r\n  attacks someone. The court found the statute evidences a legislative intent \r\n  for liability to rest with the dog owner or caregiver.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the circuit court err in finding \r\n  a landlord and tenant relationship existed between Motsinger and the Durneys? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Did the circuit court err in \r\n  finding Motsinger, regardless of whether he was a landlord, has no liability \r\n  for the injuries sustained by Kinsli when she was bitten by a dog kept on the \r\n  property he owned? \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. See also Tupper v. Dorchester County, \r\n  326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn determining whether any triable \r\n  issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. \r\n  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997); Hamiter \r\n  v. Retirement Div. of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 93, 484 S.E.2d 586 (1997); \r\n  City of Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union, 323 S.C. 384, 475 \r\n  S.E.2d 747 (1996).  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\nI. Status \r\n  as Landlord \r\n   \r\nA. South Carolina \r\n  Residential Landlord Tenant Act \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBruce argues there was no landlord/tenant \r\n  relationship created between Motsinger and the Durneys. Essentially, Bruce contends \r\n  there was no rent paid and no rental agreement between the Durneys and Motsinger; \r\n  therefore, Motsinger could not be a landlord under the South Carolina Residential \r\n  Landlord and Tenant Act (RLTA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-10 et seq. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 27-33-10 \r\n  (Supp. 1999) provides the general definitions for landlord and tenant. It reads: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(7) Landlord. - \"Landlord\" shall \r\n  be construed to include the owner or person in possession or entitled to possession \r\n  of the real estate used or occupied by the tenant . . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(8) Tenant. - \"Tenant\" shall be construed \r\n  to mean tenant at will, tenant for a term, tenant for years, domestic servant, \r\n  farm laborer, sharecropper, and agricultural renter. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe terms are more specifically defined \r\n  by the RLTA.  \r\n   \r\n(6) \"landlord\" means the owner, lessor, \r\n  or sublessor of the premises, and it also means a manager of the premises who \r\n  fails to disclose as required by Â§ 27-40-240. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-210 (6) (Supp. \r\n  1999). Under the RLTA, we need to further define owner to determine if Motsinger \r\n  is capable of being a landlord under the act. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(8) \"owner\" means one or more persons, \r\n  jointly or severally, in whom is vested (i) all or part of the legal title to \r\n  property or (ii) all or part of the beneficial ownership and a right to present \r\n  use and enjoyment of the premises. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-210 (8) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n   \r\nIt is agreed that Motsinger is the \r\n  owner of the property. It was transferred to him by the Durneys when they were \r\n  in financial difficulties. Bruce relies on Motsinger's ownership as the basis \r\n  of his liability. The main question is whether the Durneys come under the definition \r\n  of a tenant, thus giving rise to the relationship proposed by Motsinger as grounds \r\n  for his defense. \r\n   \r\nThe RLTA defines tenant: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(15) \"tenant\" means a person entitled \r\n  under a rental agreement to occupy a dwelling unit to the exclusion of others. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-210 (15) (Supp. \r\n  1999). Bruce maintains there is no written rental agreement and, therefore, \r\n  the Durneys cannot be tenants under the RLTA. However, under the RLTA a written \r\n  rental agreement is not necessary. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(12) \"rental agreement\" means all \r\n  agreements, written or oral, and valid rules and regulations adopted under Â§ \r\n  27-40-520 embodying the terms and conditions concerning the use and occupancy \r\n  of a dwelling unit and premises. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-210 (12) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n   \r\nBy its express terms, the RLTA does \r\n  not require written rental agreements, but allows for a tenancy to be created \r\n  by an oral agreement. This does not eliminate the requirement that a tenancy \r\n  for more than one year be in writing to be valid under the Statute of Frauds. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-20 (Supp. 1999)(\"Any agreement for the use \r\n  or occupation of real estate for more than one year shall be void unless in \r\n  writing.\") \r\n   \r\nTestimony by Motsinger establishes \r\n  he allowed the Durneys to live on the property.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. What is your arrangement with \r\n  your daughter and son-in-law as far as them living there? What exactly is the \r\n  arrangement between you and your - - -  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. There's no written arrangement, \r\n  verbally that they can live there. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. Do they pay you rent? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. No. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. As I understand it then, there's \r\n  not - - you're saying that there's not a formal landlord/tenant \r\n  relationship between you and your daughter? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. That's right. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. You verbally \r\n  have told them they can live there and have taken no action to get them off? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. That's right. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(Emphasis added.) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile Motsinger acknowledged there \r\n  was no formal landlord/tenant relationship in the form of a written contract, \r\n  he did indicate there was a \"verbal\" arrangement whereby his daughter and her \r\n  husband were allowed to live on the property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBruce avers there was no landlord/tenant \r\n  relationship, because the Durneys did not pay rent. The payment of rent is not \r\n  required by the RLTA to constitute a valid landlord/tenant relationship. South \r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-310 states: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(a) A landlord and a tenant may \r\n  include in a rental agreement terms and conditions not prohibited by this chapter \r\n  or other rule of law, including rent, term of the agreement, \r\n  and other provisions governing the rights and obligations of the parties. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is no mandate under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-40-310 for a rental agreement to include the payment of rent. In this \r\n  case, the agreement provides for no rent in the form of money paid to Motsinger. \r\n  Lisa Durney explained her father allowed her and her husband to live on the \r\n  property: \"Out of the goodness of his heart.\" Bruce did not point out any rule \r\n  of law which prohibits someone from renting their property for free if that \r\n  is the intent of the parties. \"Rent is a normal, but not an essential, incident \r\n  of the relationship of landlord and tenant.\" 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and \r\n  Tenant Â§ 676 (1995). We agree the Durneys are not common tenants, but under \r\n  the RLTA, all requirements for a landlord/tenant relationship have been met. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Tenant at Will \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEven if no formal agreement was reached \r\n  between the parties, the Durneys would still be tenants at will. South Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 27-33-10 (3)(1976) explicates: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(3) Tenant at will. - Every person \r\n  other than the owner of real estate, . . ., using or occupying real estate without \r\n  an agreement, either oral or in writing, shall be deemed a \"tenant at will.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Carson v. Living Word Outreach \r\n  Ministries, Inc., 315 S.C. 64, 431 S.E.2d 615 (Ct. App. 1993), this Court \r\n  enounced: \r\n   \r\nAn express agreement is not necessary \r\n  to create the relation of landlord and tenant, but such relation may arise from \r\n  the implied agreement of the parties, and may be established by proof of circumstances \r\n  authorizing the inference that the parties intended to assume such relation \r\n  toward each other. 51C C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant Â§ 9 at 42 (1968). \r\n  A tenant is one who occupies the premises of another in subordination to that \r\n  other's title and with his assent, express or implied. Columbia Ry., Gas \r\n  &amp; Electric Co. v. Jones, 119 S.C. 480, 112 S.E. 267 (1922). After termination \r\n  of a lease, one continuing to occupy the premises, absent a new agreement, express \r\n  or implied, comes squarely within the definition of a tenant at will. Townsend \r\n  v. Singleton, 257 S.C. 1, 183 S.E.2d 893 (1971). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThus, even if there was no written \r\n  or oral agreement between the parties, the Church was, at the very least, a \r\n  tenant at will.  \r\n   \r\nCarson, 315 S.C. at 69, \r\n  431 S.E.2d at 618. \r\n   \r\nEven if this Court held there was \r\n  no agreement, the relationship between the Durneys and Motsinger would still \r\n  be that of a landlord and a tenant at will. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Liability \r\n  as Landlord \r\n   \r\nBruce asserts Motsinger should be \r\n  held liable for the injuries sustained to Kinsli when the Durneys' dog bit her. \r\n  They argue a landowner who knows a vicious animal is being kept on his property \r\n  has a duty to either remove or control that animal, and if that is not done \r\n  then the landowner should be held liable. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Mitchell by Mitchell v. Bazzle, \r\n  304 S.C. 402, 404 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1991), this Court enunciated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold that the trial judge's order \r\n  based upon the law of premises liability as announced in the case of Uccello \r\n  v. Laudenslayer, 44 Cal.App.3d 504, 118 Cal.Rptr. 741 (1975), erroneously \r\n  denied Peebles' motions for directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Uccello court premised \r\n  a landlord's liability on his knowledge of the vicious propensities of the animal \r\n  kept on the property by the tenants. The court declared: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold that a duty of care arises \r\n  when the landlord has actual knowledge of the presence of the dangerous animal \r\n  and when he has the right to remove the animal by retaking possession of the \r\n  premises./.\r\n. . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[I]f a landlord has such a degree \r\n  of control over the premises that it may fairly be concluded that he can obviate \r\n  the presence of the dangerous animal and he has knowledge thereof, an enlightened \r\n  public policy requires the imposition of a duty of ordinary care. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUccello v. Laudenslayer, 118 \r\n  Cal.Rptr. 741, 743-47 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975). Bruce's main argument is Motsinger \r\n  had knowledge of the Durneys' dog's viciousness, but did not seek to have it \r\n  restrained or removed from the property. This reasoning was rejected by the \r\n  Mitchell court in South Carolina. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe realize that a landowner must \r\n  use his land in such a way as not to injure adjoining landowners. 2 C.J.S. Adjoining \r\n  Landowners Â§ 2 (1972); 1 Am.Jur.2d Adjoining Landowners Â§ 2 (1962). \r\n  But, after very careful research, except for Uccello, we find no authority \r\n  imposing vicarious liability upon a landowner for the injuries caused by a tenant's \r\n  dog. . . .  \r\n   \r\nSince at the time of the attack South \r\n  Carolina did not have a statute similar to the California statute upon which \r\n  Uccello was based, we hold that we are not bound by Uccello. \r\n  The facts of the case before us occurred prior to the effective date of the \r\n  RLTA. As noted, the case law prior to the enactment of the RLTA imposes no legal \r\n  duty on the part of the landlord to keep in repair and safe condition leased \r\n  rental premises under the control of his tenant.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina \r\n  discussed the same situation arising after the adoption of the RLTA. In Fair \r\n  v. United States, 334 S.C. 321, 513 S.E.2d 616 (1999), the Court approved \r\n  the Mitchell decision and further annunciated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe construe Â§ 27-40-440(a)(2) in \r\n  conjunction with Â§ 27-40-510(2) and hold that under the RLTA, a landlord may \r\n  be held liable only for defects relating to the inherent physical state of the \r\n  leased premises. Accordingly, we answer the certified question as follows: The \r\n  \"fit and habitable\" provision of the RLTA found in Â§ 27-44-40(a)(2) does not \r\n  alter the common law rule that a landlord is not liable to a tenant's invitee \r\n  for injury caused by a tenant's dog. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFair, 334 S.C. at 324, 513 \r\n  S.E.2d at 617. South Carolina has established that a landlord is not liable \r\n  for injuries caused by an animal kept by a tenant on leased property. Motsinger \r\n  is therefore not liable for the injuries caused by the Durneys' dog when it \r\n  bit Kinsli. \r\n   \r\nIII. Liability as \r\n  Private Landowner \r\n   \r\nAlternatively, the circuit court \r\n  held that even if Motsinger is not considered to have a landlord/tenant relationship \r\n  with his daughter and son-in-law, he was not liable as a matter of law in his \r\n  status as a private landowner because he was not the dog's owner or caregiver. \r\n  The court cited Â§ 47-3-110 of South Carolina Code, which places liability for \r\n  a dog bite on the owner of the dog or the person having the dog in his care \r\n  or keeping. Section 47-3-110 provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhenever any person is bitten or \r\n  otherwise attacked by a dog while the person is in a public place or lawfully \r\n  in a private place, including the property of the owner of the dog or other \r\n  person having the dog in his care or keeping, the owner of the dog or other \r\n  person having the dog in his care or keeping is liable for the damages suffered \r\n  by the person bitten or otherwise attacked. For the purposes of this section, \r\n  a person bitten or otherwise attacked is lawfully in a private place, including \r\n  the property of the owner of the dog or other person having the dog in his care \r\n  or keeping, when the person bitten or otherwise attacked is on the property \r\n  in the performance of any duty imposed upon him by the laws of the State, by \r\n  the ordinances of any political subdivision of this State, by the laws of the \r\n  United States of America, including, but not limited to, postal regulations, \r\n  or when the person bitten or otherwise attacked is on the property upon the \r\n  invitation, express or implied, of the owner of the property or of any lawful \r\n  tenant or resident of the property. If a person provokes a dog into attacking \r\n  him then the owner of the dog is not liable.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110 (1987) \r\n  (emphasis added). \r\n   \r\nIn Nesbitt v. Lewis, 335 \r\n  S.C. 441, 517 S.E.2d 11 (Ct. App. 1999), this Court found summary judgment was \r\n  appropriate as to one owner with a partial interest in residential property \r\n  where the owner did not reside at the property or have the dogs in her care \r\n  or keeping. In Nesbitt, the home was owned by a mother and her son \r\n  and daughter. The mother had the majority interest in the property, and her \r\n  adult children inherited their minority interests upon her husband's death. \r\n  The mother owned three Chow dogs which allegedly bit a child in her yard. The \r\n  son lived in the home with his mother and was the caregiver and keeper of the \r\n  dogs. We affirmed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to the daughter \r\n  because she had not lived in the home for five years, and she did not care for \r\n  or keep the dogs.  \r\n   \r\nOther states have construed similar \r\n  statutes and reached the same result. See Boylan v. Everett, 52 N.E. \r\n  541 (Mass. 1899)(The mere fact that a dog is kept by its owner on another's \r\n  premises, with the premises owner's knowledge, acquiescence, or permission, \r\n  does not of itself make the premises owner the dog's keeper.); Goennenwein \r\n  by Goennenwein v. Rasof, 695 N.E.2d 541 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998) (Property \r\n  owner who exercised no degree of care, custody, or control over her son's dog, \r\n  who bit owner's minor guest while on owner's premises, was not dog's \"owner\" \r\n  within meaning of Animal Control Act.); John P. Ludington, Annotation, Who \r\n  \"Harbors\" or \"Keeps\" Dog Under Animal Liability Statute, 64 A.L.R.4th 963 \r\n  (1988) (Keeping has a proprietary aspect. Reference is sometimes made to the \r\n  keeper's \"dominion\" over the dog. Keeping is often defined in terms of the three \r\n  C's - that is, that keeping is exercising some measure of care, custody, or \r\n  control over the dog.). \r\n   \r\nThe Appeals Court of Massachusetts \r\n  discussed a very similar situation in Brown v. Bolduc, 556 N.E.2d 1051 \r\n  (Mass. App. Ct. 1990). The property owners were sued after their daughter's \r\n  dog bit a party invitee. The property owners allowed their daughter to live \r\n  rent free on the property. They knew the daughter kept the dog, and on a few \r\n  occasions, provided it water while they were caring for their horses kept at \r\n  the same property. The court examined a similar statute to ours which placed \r\n  liability on the \"owner or keeper,\" and concluded the parents were not liable \r\n  under the statute because they were not the \"owners or keepers\" of the dog. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Smith v. Issacs, No. \r\n  Civ.A. 97C09028, 1999 WL 1240833 (Del. Super. Sept. 21, 1999), the owner of \r\n  the property allowed the dog and its owner to reside at her home. The property \r\n  owner did not take care of the dog; however, she allowed the dog to sleep in \r\n  the enclosed porch of her home. The court was asked to determine if the property \r\n  owner was a \"custodian\" or \"owner\" of the dog for purposes of liability. The \r\n  court concluded the property owner was not in sufficient control of the animal \r\n  to consider her a \"custodian.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMotsinger allowed the dog to be kept \r\n  on property on which he did not live. To this extent he did exercise some measure \r\n  of control, but this is not sufficient to call him the dog's 'keeper.\" Motsinger \r\n  visited the property, but there is no evidence he provided any care or support \r\n  for the dog. Custody was maintained by the Durneys, care was provided by the \r\n  Durneys, and the Durneys were in almost complete control over the animal. The \r\n  Durneys were the obvious owners and keepers of the animal. Motsinger cannot \r\n  be held liable as the property owner under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold the relationship between \r\n  the Motsinger and the Durneys was that of a landlord and tenants. While there \r\n  was no written agreement, the record establishes Motsinger allowed his daughter \r\n  and son-in-law to live on the property. Even if they are not formal tenants \r\n  under the South Carolina Residential Landlord Tenants Act, they are tenants \r\n  at will under Carson v. Living Word Outreach Ministries, Inc., 315 \r\n  S.C. 64, 431 S.E.2d 615 (Ct. App. 1993). We rule Motsinger as a landlord was \r\n  not liable for the injuries sustained by Kinsli when the Durneys' dog bit her. \r\n  Even assuming Motsinger was not a landlord, we conclude he would still not be \r\n  the dog's \"owner\" or \"keeper\" under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110, and therefore \r\n  would not be liable as a property owner. Accordingly, the decision of the trial \r\n  court to grant summary judgment is \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n1.  \r\n  In their depositions, the Durneys contended Kinsli was in the yard of another \r\n  person who also owned a Chow dog when she was bitten, and they questioned whether \r\n  it was their dog who bit Kinsli. However, for purposes of the summary judgment \r\n  motion, it was assumed they were the owners of the dog which bit Kinsli. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3209","title":"State v.

Franklin was convicted by a jury on the criminal conspiracy \r\n  charge, and acquitted of the remaining charges. Franklin appeals the denial \r\n  of his motion for a new trial, made on the ground of internal jury misconduct, \r\n  and the refusal of the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue \r\n  of jury misconduct. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nFranklin was tried on August 11 and \r\n  12, 1997. Shortly after the court submitted the case to the jury, the jury asked \r\n  to receive a written charge of the elements of each crime. Instead, the court \r\n  orally instructed the jury again on the elements. The jury sent the court another \r\n  note, several hours later, asking whether Franklin had pled guilty to conspiracy. \r\n  The court replied to this question in the negative, and the jury resumed deliberations. \r\n  Less than an hour later, the court received another note from the jury, which \r\n  asked what they should do if they could not reach a unanimous verdict. In response, \r\n  the court gave the jury an Allen(1) \r\n  charge. Approximately thirty minutes later, the jury returned a verdict of guilty \r\n  on the conspiracy charge and not guilty on the burglary and grand larceny indictments. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAfter the verdict was received, \r\n  the trial court entertained questions from the jury. Juror Simmons remained \r\n  in the jury room after other jurors departed, indicating she would like to speak \r\n  with the judge and attorneys alone. In that meeting, she stated she had voted \r\n  guilty because she felt coerced.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe next day Franklin filed \r\n  a motion for a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence.(2) \r\n  Franklin later submitted a memorandum alleging Simmons voted guilty under duress \r\n  from her fellow jurors, who coerced her with gender-based comments, derogatory \r\n  comments, and physical threats. An affidavit by juror Simmons was submitted \r\n  to the court in support of the motion. Following arguments of counsel, the court \r\n  ruled that the affidavit did not give rise to a prima facie showing of gender \r\n  or other bias, and that there was no evidence of jury misconduct implicating \r\n  concerns of fundamental fairness. The court ruled that no further inquiry was \r\n  required. The motion for new trial was denied accordingly. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFranklin argues on appeal that juror \r\n  Simmons's affidavit gives rise to at least a factual issue concerning undue \r\n  coercion and gender bias, raising a question of fundamental fairness. Franklin \r\n  asserts that the failure of the court to make further inquiry by embarking upon \r\n  a fact-finding process was error. Franklin also argues that the allegations \r\n  in the affidavit, alone, are sufficient evidence of gender bias and coercion \r\n  to impeach the verdict, requiring that it be overturned and a new trial granted. \r\n  We disagree with both of these contentions. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter it became clear juror Simmons \r\n  was the only juror voting to acquit Franklin on all charges, she became the \r\n  unwilling center of attention. Her affidavit contained four allegations concerning \r\n  subsequent events. In her first allegation, which Franklin characterizes as \r\n  evidence of gender bias, Simmons stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt this point, the focus of the panel \r\n  began to be directed solely at me. I was called \"stupid,\" \"a dumb bitch,\" \"a \r\n  child,\" and other derogatory names by at least six of the jurors. Of these six, \r\n  five were men. I was being given dirty looks, and the jurors were rolling their \r\n  eyes at me. I was being blamed for the other jurors' missing work, family, children, \r\n  \"Days of Our Lives,\" and that I was wasting the taxpayers' money. The name-calling \r\n  and yelling lasted for at least four hours.  \r\n   \r\nIn her second allegation, Simmons \r\n  stated: \r\n   \r\nAt one point, one of the jurors asked \r\n  how the panel could get the alternate to participate. Another juror replied \r\n  that \"someone would have to die.\" Then I said that it \"would have to be me\" \r\n  in order for the vote to change and everyone laughed and agreed. Their laughs \r\n  were not in a friendly, joking manner, but were instead more like they were \r\n  laughing at me. \r\n   \r\nIn her third allegation, Simmons \r\n  complained that in an attempt to change her verdict, some members of the jury \r\n  stood next to her yelling, while others paced the room screaming at her.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSimmons's fourth allegation concerns \r\n  an event occurring after the verdict. After speaking with the judge and attorneys, \r\n  Simmons asked for an escort to her car. When she walked out with a bailiff, \r\n  she saw three jurors, one female and two male, waiting for her. She attributes \r\n  an evil motive to the group, although there is no allegation that anything was \r\n  said to her or any movement made toward her.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe begin our analysis of these allegations \r\n  by first recognizing that generally, juror testimony is inadmissible to impeach \r\n  a jury verdict. State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 463 S.E.2d 314 (1995). \r\n  However, juror testimony or affidavits are admissible to prove an allegation \r\n  of extraneous information or influence. Id. (juror testimony may normally \r\n  be used when an extraneous influence is alleged); Rule 606(b), SCRE (testimony \r\n  or affidavit of juror is admissible to demonstrate that outside prejudicial \r\n  information was brought to jury's attention or that outside influence was placed \r\n  on any juror). Until recently, the prohibition against juror testimony regarding \r\n  allegations of internal jury misconduct remained intact. See State \r\n  v. Thomas, 268 S.C. 343, 234 S.E.2d 16 (1977); Barsh v. Chrysler Corp., \r\n  262 S.C. 129, 203 S.E.2d 107 (1974). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. \r\n  85, 463 S.E.2d 314 (1995), our supreme court carved an exception to this rule, \r\n  holding that juror testimony is competent in cases involving internal misconduct \r\n  where necessary to ensure fundamental fairness. In that case, the allegations \r\n  concerned the influence of racial prejudice on a verdict. The court held, \"[i]f \r\n  a juror claims prejudice played a role in determining the guilt or innocence \r\n  of a defendant, investigation into the matter is necessary. To hold otherwise \r\n  would violate 'the plainest principles of justice.'\" Hunter, 320 S.C. \r\n  at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316 (citing McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264 (1915)). \r\n    \r\nViewing the allegations of juror \r\n  Simmons, we find no error in the trial judge's determination that Simmons's \r\n  allegations do not implicate due process concerns.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFirst, we disagree with Franklin's \r\n  characterization of the derogatory names as gender bias. A fair reading of Simmons's \r\n  affidavit shows that she was not coerced through the use of gender-based bias \r\n  or discrimination. Although Simmons was called \"a dumb bitch,\" jurors also called \r\n  her other derogatory names which were not gender specific. Further, her affidavit \r\n  indicates that she was called this offensive name by only one juror on one occasion. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nMoreover, the use of a gender-specific \r\n  term in a derogatory comment does not necessarily indicate that the comment \r\n  is directed at the person's gender. See Johnson v. Waters, 970 \r\n  F. Supp. 991 (M.D. Ala. 1997) (holding that use of a derogatory term, standing \r\n  alone, is not necessarily a direct showing of discrimination, but rather must \r\n  be considered in the context in which it was used). See also Kriss \r\n  v. Sprint Communications Co., Ltd. Partnership, 58 F.3d 1276, 1281 (8th \r\n  Cir. 1995) (concluding that use of the term \"bitch\" did not indicate \"a general \r\n  misogynist attitude\" as it was directed at only one woman and thus was not \"particularly \r\n  probative of gender discrimination\"). Viewing the use of the gender specific \r\n  term within context in this case, we find no evidence of gender bias.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe also find no error in the trial \r\n  judge's conclusion that the remaining allegations do not indicate internal misconduct \r\n  sufficient to raise a due process concern. Simmons's version of the events surrounding \r\n  the comment that \"in order for the alternate to participate in deliberations \r\n  another juror would have to die,\" does not imply any threat of harm to Simmons. \r\n  Nor does the remaining colloquy on the subject. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSimmons's last complaint of constant \r\n  yelling by some male jurors standing next to her, and \"screaming\" of other jurors \r\n  who paced the room, is also insufficient to raise concerns of fundamental fairness. \r\n  In Hunter, a juror who wished to vote not guilty claimed several jurors \r\n  gathered around another, touched her shoulders, and stated \"You know he's guilty, \r\n  you know he's guilty.\" Hunter, 320 S.C. at 87, 463 S.E.2d at 315-16. \r\n  On appeal, the court found the claim insufficient to show she was coerced into \r\n  changing her vote. Although we do not doubt that staying in a juror room with \r\n  others who are constantly vocalizing an opinion different from one's own must \r\n  be challenging, we find even less evidence of coercion here than in the Hunter \r\n  case. Other jurors actually touched the juror in Hunter, whereas here \r\n  they did not. \r\n   \r\nFinally, Simmons's conclusion that \r\n  three jurors standing near her car in the parking lot when she left the courthouse \r\n  somehow indicated an intention to harm her is unfounded speculation.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn conclusion, we emphasize that \r\n  the exception to the general rule against review of internal jury deliberations \r\n  carved out in Hunter is a narrow one, limited by our supreme court to \r\n  those few situations which implicate due process raising a question of fundamental \r\n  fairness. A jury verdict which is based upon racial discrimination fits within \r\n  this definition. But the integrity of the jury system is jeopardized any time \r\n  a court finds it necessary to intrude into the internal deliberation process. \r\n  Such an inquiry should not be lightly made.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe nature of the jury process can \r\n  be intimidating to those who dislike confrontation and debate. It is all the \r\n  more difficult in a criminal case, where jurors are most likely to feel the \r\n  weight of their decision. In the setting of a confined deliberation room, it \r\n  is understandable that some jurors become very sensitive to the outward manifestations \r\n  of anger or animosity exhibited by other jurors who do not share the same point \r\n  of view. Needless to say, not every juror is well versed in the art of gentle \r\n  persuasion.  \r\n   \r\nIt appears that Juror Simmons became \r\n  very sensitive to the pressure applied by other jurors. The degree of sensitivity \r\n  is highlighted by her statement that the Allen charge led her to believe \r\n  even the judge was mad at her. This reaction is unfortunate, but it is not of \r\n  such a nature as to implicate due process. We find no error in the trial court's \r\n  conclusion. Consequently, no further inquiry was necessary, and a new trial \r\n  was not warranted. \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the conviction \r\n  is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY AND CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n   \r\n1. \r\nAllen v. United States, 164 U.S. \r\n492 (1896). \r\n2.  At the trial \r\n  level, Franklin asserted that a juror viewed Franklin and his wife in conversation \r\n  in the halls of the courthouse during a \"smoke break.\" The juror allegedly returned \r\n  to the jury room and informed other jurors that Franklin and his wife were on \r\n  good terms with each other. Because Franklin attempted to portray his wife as \r\n  a reluctant or \"hostile\" witness, thereby hoping to give her testimony more \r\n  credibility, Franklin argued that this impromptu viewing and discussion by the \r\n  jury constituted an improper, outside influence improperly affecting the verdict. \r\n  However, Franklin does not raise this argument on appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3210","title":"Jones v.

Terry \r\n          Beverly, of Law Office of O. Terry Beverly, of Conway.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPER CURIAM: In this \r\n  adoption case, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) appeals \r\n  an order of the family court requiring that \"unknown fathers\" be notified of \r\n  the adoption proceedings by publication, with such publication to include the \r\n  name of the biological mother. We reverse.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs the result of an earlier proceeding \r\n  before another family court judge, the parental rights of the biological mother \r\n  and putative biological father of Baby Girl Doe and Baby Boy Doe were terminated. \r\n  In that order, dated January 13, 1998, the family court specifically found that \r\n  \"The [putative biological father] is in default and is the father of the two \r\n  younger children, [Baby Girl Doe and Baby Boy Doe].\" The putative biological \r\n  father allegedly was the common law husband of the children's biological mother. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nChristopher and Angela Jones commenced \r\n  this adoption action on July 14, 1998. The family court appointed a guardian \r\n  ad litem to represent the children.  On November 18, 1998, \r\n  the children's guardian ad litem filed a motion to compel DSS to disclose the \r\n  name of the biological mother for the purpose of including her name in a John \r\n  Doe publication providing notice of the adoption proceedings to any unknown \r\n  biological fathers of the minor children.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter a hearing on the matter, the \r\n  family court issued its order of February 8, 1999, granting the motion to compel. \r\n  In that order, the family court expressly recognized the prior judge's finding \r\n  regarding paternity of the children, but found it necessary to notify any unknown \r\n  fathers due to the absence of any evidence that a paternity test was performed \r\n  in connection with the court's prior order. Further, the court determined notification \r\n  of the proceedings to any putative fathers should include the name of the biological \r\n  mother. \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, DSS argues the family \r\n  court erred in requiring the biological mother's name be included in the John \r\n  Doe notice by publication. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdoption statutes are in derogation \r\n  of the common law, and must therefore be strictly construed. Hucks v. Dolan, \r\n  288 S.C. 468, 343 S.E.2d 613 (1986). Our adoption statutes \"are designed to \r\n  promote policies and procedures necessary for the protection of all the parties \r\n  involved in an adoption.\" Bradey v. Children's Bureau of South Carolina, \r\n  275 S.C. 622, 626, 274 S.E.2d 418, 420 (1981). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(C) \r\n  (Supp. 1999) provides: \r\n   \r\nAll files and records pertaining \r\n  to the adoption proceedings in the State Department of Social Services, or in \r\n  any authorized agency, or maintained by any person certified by the department \r\n  under the provisions of Section 20-7-1750, are confidential and must be withheld \r\n  from inspection except upon order of court for good cause shown.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn determining whether \"good cause\" \r\n  has been established to warrant release of biological information, the court \r\n  should weigh the respective interests of the parties to the adoption action. \r\n  As well, the court must give due consideration to the impact that each case \r\n  may have on the viability of the adoption process. In applying this balancing \r\n  test, \r\n   \r\n[W]e must be mindful of the rationale \r\n  for confidentiality in the adoption process. Not only does confidentiality insulate \r\n  and nurture the newly formed adoptive family, it also may be assumed to provide \r\n  the impetus for a traumatized natural parent to come forward to allow the process \r\n  to take place rather than resort to other less desirable means of dealing with \r\n  prospective parenthood. The natural parent or parents must feel secure in the \r\n  knowledge that their identity will usually remain confidential. This offers \r\n  the parent a fresh start, confident that the personal information will be disclosed \r\n  only for good cause on order of the court. This expectation of confidentiality \r\n  arising from the statute is constitutionally protected as a right of privacy. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nBradey, 275 S.C. at 626-627, \r\n  274 S.E.2d at 421 (citations omitted). A party must demonstrate a compelling \r\n  need for the identifying information which outweighs the need for confidentiality \r\n  to establish good cause within the meaning of Â§ 20-7-1780. Id. at 627, \r\n  274 S.E.2d at 421. What constitutes a compelling need for identification depends \r\n  upon the circumstances of each case. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis Court recently addressed the \r\n  same issue in a similar factual scenario. See South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Social Servs. v. Doe, Op. No. 3109 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 7, 2000)(Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 5 at 9). In Doe, the biological mother of a child in DSS \r\n  custody signed a relinquishment of her parental rights and adoption consent \r\n  form. The biological mother also signed an affidavit naming a particular person \r\n  as the child's biological father. The family court terminated that named individual's \r\n  parental rights to the child. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nApproximately three years later, \r\n  the child's foster mother sought to adopt the child. It was uncontested that \r\n  a John Doe notice by publication was necessary. However, the guardian ad litem \r\n  filed a motion to include the name of the biological mother in the notice. The \r\n  family court granted the motion. This Court reversed, holding: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . the guardian ad litem has failed \r\n  to demonstrate a compelling need for the identifying information. . . . [N]otification \r\n  to John Doe is precautionary in nature and based on the mere possibility that \r\n  either the biological mother has been less than candid about the identity of \r\n  the child's father, or she does not know the father's identity. In our view, \r\n  these circumstances do not constitute good cause to subject the biological mother \r\n  to the public scrutiny which would necessarily enure from publication of her \r\n  name in connection with these proceedings. While the privacy rights of biological \r\n  parents in adoption proceedings are not absolute, we believe disclosure of the \r\n  mother's identity in this case would undermine the expectation that confidentiality \r\n  will be maintained in adoption proceedings except under the most extraordinary \r\n  circumstances. \r\n   \r\nId. at 12.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough the issue was not raised \r\n  in the Doe appeal, the Court also noted that the factual scenario \"appear[ed] \r\n  to be a case of one family court judge impermissibly overruling another.\" Id. \r\n  at n.1 (citing Charleston County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Father, 317 \r\n  S.C. 283, 454 S.E.2d 307 (1995)). Similarly, in this case, the family court's \r\n  requiring that the biological mother's name be included in a John Doe notice \r\n  is tantamount to an overruling of the prior family court order which held that \r\n  the biological mother's alleged common law husband was the children's biological \r\n  father. \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, as in Doe, the \r\n  guardian ad litem has failed to demonstrate a compelling need to identify the \r\n  biological mother for the John Doe notice by publication. The identity of the \r\n  biological father has been judicially determined and his parental rights have \r\n  been terminated. The fact that the identity of the biological father has not \r\n  also been established by means of a paternity test does not constitute an extraordinary \r\n  circumstance warranting public disclosure of the biological mother's identity. \r\n  In Doe, this Court held there was not good cause to include the biological \r\n  mother's name in the John Doe notice despite the fact that the biological father's \r\n  identification was based on her affidavit alone. If the biological mother's \r\n  affidavit was sufficient in Doe, the failure to obtain paternity tests \r\n  clearly does not amount to good cause. See also Charleston County \r\n  Dep't of Social Servs. v. Father, 317 S.C. 283, 454 S.E.2d 307 (1995)) (\"Disclosure \r\n  follows in extraordinary circumstances.\"); Evans v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Social Servs. 303 S.C. 108, 399 S.E.2d 156 (1990)(DSS could not be compelled \r\n  to divulge the name and address of an unwed birth mother for purposes of ascertaining \r\n  the identity of a natural father). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we reverse so much of \r\n  the family court's order as requires disclosure of the biological mother's name \r\n  for purposes of notice by publication to any putative fathers.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, GOOLSBY and SHULER, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1.

Frasier to provide handwriting exemplars. The circuit court denied \r\n  the State's motion because it violated Frasier's Fifth Amendment right against \r\n  self-incrimination. We reverse and remand.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 14, 1998, three men robbed \r\n  a McDonald's restaurant in Charleston and three employees were held against \r\n  their will. Frasier was arrested the next day. He was indicted on three counts \r\n  of kidnaping, three counts of assault and battery with intent to kill, armed \r\n  robbery, and possession of a knife during the commission of a violent crime. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe State moved for an order requiring \r\n  Frasier to submit handwriting samples. In an affidavit in support of its motion, \r\n  the State alleged that Frasier wrote several letters to two co-defendants while \r\n  he was incarcerated in the Charleston County jail. The State alleged that Frasier \r\n  wrote the letters to try and coerce his co-defendants into fabricating a story \r\n  for the night of the robbery. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe State wants Frasier to provide \r\n  handwriting samples of specific words and phrases that are contained in the \r\n  letters. Then it intends to send both the samples and the letters to SLED for \r\n  a handwriting comparison.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, the State maintains that \r\n  Frasier's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is not implicated \r\n  because handwriting exemplars are nontestimonial in nature. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Fifth Amendment protection from \r\n  self-incrimination \"protects an accused only from being compelled to testify \r\n  against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial \r\n  or communicative nature . . . .\" Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, \r\n  761 (1966) (holding that withdrawal of blood and chemical analysis of blood \r\n  does not implicate the Fifth Amendment).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe privilege reaches only compulsion \r\n  of an accused's communication, whatever form they might take, and the compulsion \r\n  of responses which are also communications, for example, compliance with a subpoena \r\n  to produce one's papers, and not compulsion which makes a suspect or accused \r\n  the source of real or physical evidence. One's voice and handwriting are, of \r\n  course, means of communication. It by no means follows, however, that every \r\n  compulsion of an accused to use his voice or write compels a communication within \r\n  the cover of the privilege. A mere handwriting exemplar, in contrast to the \r\n  content of what is written, like the voice or body itself, is an identifying \r\n  physical characteristic outside its protection. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGilbert v. California, 388 \r\n  U.S. 263, 266-67 (1967) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added); see \r\n  State v. Hart, 306 S.C. 344, 412 S.E.2d 380 (1991) (The exhibition of \r\n  physical characteristics does not implicate a defendant's privilege against \r\n  self-incrimination because physical characteristics are nontestimonial.). \r\n In Gilbert, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court determined that the privilege against self-incrimination would \r\n  not bar a defendant's handwriting exemplars from being admitted into evidence \r\n  so that they could be compared to a handwritten note left in several robberies. \r\n  Gilbert, 388 U.S. at 265-66; see Schmerber, 384 U.S. at \r\n  764 (noting that, traditionally, witnesses could be compelled, in both state \r\n  and federal courts, to submit to \"fingerprinting, photographing, or measurements, \r\n  to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to \r\n  assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular gesture\") (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough South Carolina law has not \r\n  addressed the issue of whether a defendant can be ordered to provide handwriting \r\n  exemplars without violating his privilege against self-incrimination, there \r\n  are cases compelling defendants to submit other evidence of physical characteristics. \r\n  See State v. Jones, 268 S.C. 227, 233 S.E.2d 287 (1977) (defendant \r\n  in lineup required to speak the words the robber spoke during the course of \r\n  the robbery held permissible because it did not violate the privilege against \r\n  self-incrimination); State v. Vice, 259 S.C. 30, 190 S.E.2d 510 (1972) \r\n  (finding no violation of the privilege against self-incrimination where defendant \r\n  was compelled to speak into a telephone and have his voice recorded for identification \r\n  purposes). \r\n   \r\nEven though the State wants Frasier \r\n  to write specific words and phrases that are contained in the letters, his handwriting \r\n  remains a physical characteristic rather than testimonial evidence. It is no \r\n  different than requiring a suspect in a lineup to speak the words a robber spoke \r\n  during commission of the crime. The evidence is the handwriting or the voice \r\n  itself, not in the words written or spoken. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThus, it was error for the trial \r\n  court to deny the State's motion for an order compelling Frasier to submit the \r\n  requested handwriting samples. We reverse and remand for an order consistent \r\n  with this opinion.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR, STILWELL, and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1.  We decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  Frasier contends \r\n  the State failed to show how the denial of its motion significantly impaired \r\n  prosecution of the case, apparently asserting that any error would be harmless. \r\n  We disagree. The State was attempting to prove that Frasier authored letters \r\n  that attempted to get Frasier's co-defendants to fabricate an alibi for the \r\n  night of the robbery. Evidence that Frasier was the author of the letters would \r\n  aid the State in proving Frasier's identity as one of the robbers. The error \r\n  of denying such evidence cannot be considered harmless. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3212","title":"Hinson v.

The wife answered and counterclaimed, \r\n  seeking alimony, equitable division of marital property, and attorney fees. \r\n  The wife appeals the sufficiency of the family court's award of alimony and \r\n  the court's refusal to amend its order to provide for disposition of potential \r\n  casualty insurance proceeds arising from a post-trial fire which destroyed the \r\n  marital home. We affirm as modified. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nThe parties married in November 1985 \r\n  and separated in September 1997. They have no children. At trial, the husband \r\n  was thirty-eight years old and the wife was forty-eight years old. The husband \r\n  is employed and earns a gross monthly income of $3,661. The wife was employed \r\n  until 1993, when she became disabled and began receiving $699 per month in social \r\n  security disability benefits. The wife was originally granted disability benefits \r\n  due to a mental condition. She also suffers from arthritis, lupus, diabetes, \r\n  and chronic fatigue syndrome, and has been hospitalized on three occasions since \r\n  the parties' separation. The majority of the wife's $4,900 in yearly medication \r\n  expenses was covered by insurance provided by the husband's employer. Her Medicare \r\n  coverage does not pay for prescription medications. The wife is no longer covered \r\n  under the husband's insurance policy. However, she may obtain three years of \r\n  separate coverage through the husband's employer for $265.97 per month.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe husband's financial declaration \r\n  indicates his monthly expenses exceed his net monthly income by approximately \r\n  $600. The wife's monthly expenses exceed her monthly disability benefits by \r\n  approximately $1,200.  \r\n   \r\nThe family court awarded the wife \r\n  $750 per month in alimony and an equal share of the marital estate. On appeal, \r\n  the wife argues the alimony award is insufficient under the circumstances of \r\n  the case. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Alimony \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn award of alimony rests within \r\n  the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Williams v. Williams, 297 S.C. 208, 375 \r\n  S.E.2d 349 (Ct. App. 1988). \"Alimony is a substitute for the support which is \r\n  normally incident to the marital relationship.\" Johnson v. Johnson, 296 \r\n  S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988), cert. denied, 298 \r\n  S.C. 117, 378 S.E.2d 445 (1989). Alimony should ordinarily place the supported \r\n  spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during \r\n  the marriage. Id. It is the family court's duty to make an alimony award \r\n  \"that is fit, equitable and just if the claim is well-founded.\" Woodward \r\n  v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 1987) (citation \r\n  omitted). \r\n   \r\nFactors to be considered in making \r\n  an alimony award include: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional \r\n  health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment \r\n  history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established \r\n  during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the \r\n  parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) \r\n  equitable apportionment; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or \r\n  fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) such \r\n  other factors the court deems relevant. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. \r\n  1999). No one factor is dispositive. Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 283 \r\n  S.E.2d 832 (1981). \r\n   \r\nOur review of the family court's \r\n  order reveals a thorough application of the factors relevant to awarding alimony. \r\n  In arriving at its alimony award, the family court expressly considered, among \r\n  other things, the wife's health, medical expenses, inability to earn income \r\n  in excess of her social security disability benefits, and her award of equitable \r\n  distribution. After review of the record, we defer to the sound discretion of \r\n  the family court as to the amount of alimony appropriate under the facts and \r\n  circumstances of this case. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Potential \r\n  Insurance Proceeds \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe wife next argues the family court \r\n  erred in denying her motion to alter or modify that part of the support order \r\n  which apportioned the net equity in the marital residence. We agree. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn identifying and apportioning the \r\n  marital estate, the family court valued the parties' marital residence at $116,000 \r\n  and determined the parties had accumulated a net equity of $19,000 in the residence. \r\n  As part of the equitable distribution scheme, the court ordered the marital \r\n  home sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties, provided the \r\n  husband could, at his election, purchase the wife's one-half interest in the \r\n  marital home for $9,500, payable within forty-five days of the June 16, 1998 \r\n  order. \r\n   \r\nBoth parties filed post-trial motions. \r\n  The family court heard the motions on August 25, 1998. At the time of the hearing, \r\n  the husband had not purchased the wife's interest in the home and the home had \r\n  been totally destroyed by fire. The home was insured for $162,800. The insurance \r\n  proceeds had not been paid at the time of the hearing and the parties were notified \r\n  by their insurance carrier that an investigation indicated the home was destroyed \r\n  by a fire that was intentionally set. The parties were also notified by South \r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division that the fire was believed to be the result \r\n  of arson. \r\n   \r\nThe wife moved, pursuant to Rule \r\n  60, SCRCP, for amendment of the order of separate maintenance and support to \r\n  provide for equitable apportionment of any potential insurance proceeds.(1) \r\n  The family court denied the motion in summary fashion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is clear from the order of separate \r\n  support and maintenance that the family court intended the house be sold and \r\n  the proceeds equally divided, in the event the husband did not choose to pay \r\n  the wife $9,500 for her interest in the house within forty-five days of the \r\n  order. The husband admitted in his brief that he had not paid the wife for her \r\n  interest within the specified time.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe have no case directly on point \r\n  in South Carolina. However, there are other jurisdictions which have addressed \r\n  similar factual circumstances, and which we find to be helpful in reaching a \r\n  disposition of this issue. In Corrigan v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas., 364 \r\n  N.W.2d 728 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985), the court found that one spouse was entitled \r\n  to all of the proceeds under a fire insurance policy, since the fire which destroyed \r\n  the property occurred after the other spouse's rights and interests in the property \r\n  had expired. \r\n   \r\nIn Morse v. Morse, 961 S.W.2d \r\n  777 (Ark. Ct. App. 1998), the Arkansas Court of Appeals held that the former \r\n  wife did not have an insurable interest in the former marital home at the time \r\n  it was destroyed by fire and thus, was not entitled to any of the insurance \r\n  proceeds, where she had previously quitclaimed her interest to her former husband \r\n  as part of their property settlement. The court further found that the wife \r\n  was not entitled to recover the $20,000 the husband still owed her under the \r\n  property settlement from the insurance proceeds because the time stated in the \r\n  settlement for repayment of the debt had not yet expired. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Beamer v. Beamer, 479 A.2d \r\n  485 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984), the court found the wife was not entitled to reopen \r\n  the divorce judgment to obtain equitable distribution of the fire insurance \r\n  proceeds from the marital home, even though the house was insured for more than \r\n  the value set in the divorce decree, because the wife's interest in the marital \r\n  home had already been litigated.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the wife still had \r\n  an interest in the marital home, as she had not relinquished that interest to \r\n  the husband. In contrast to the facts in Beamer, the amount of that interest \r\n  had only been finally determined in terms of the manner of its calculation, \r\n  i.e., through an arms-length sale, absent the purchase of her interest \r\n  by the husband within 45 days. Unlike Morse, the husband did not take \r\n  advantage of the opportunity to purchase the wife's interest, as provided by \r\n  the family court. The sale of the real property upon which the house was located \r\n  as required by the final order will not now include the value of the home, as \r\n  that has been destroyed by the fire. Under these circumstances we see no reason \r\n  to exclude the wife's insured interest in the marital home as an asset attributable \r\n  to her. We conclude the wife's 50% interest in the marital home entitles her \r\n  to a 50% interest in the insurance proceeds. In our view, the same provisions \r\n  of the final order that required an equal division of any sale proceeds also \r\n  require the equal division of any insurance proceeds.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we modify the family \r\n  court's order to provide, in addition to the sale of the marital property and \r\n  division of the net proceeds from the sale, that the parties equally divide \r\n  any insurance proceeds paid as a result of the damage to the marital residence. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n   \r\nThe family court's order is \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, HUFF, and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n1.

Nettles contends she should have been awarded total \r\n  or partial disability benefits under the general disability statutes, or, alternatively, \r\n  the commission should have recognized the injury to her right lower extremity. \r\n  Furthermore, she contends the commission erred in failing to order her employer \r\n  to pay the medical bills for her stomach problems and in determining that she \r\n  reached MMI on April 14, 1997, rather than in June of 1997. We affirm in part, \r\n  reverse in part and remand. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 16, 1993, Nettles sustained \r\n  an injury by accident to her spine while opening a box of textbooks as part \r\n  of her employment with Spartanburg County School District #7 (Employer). Nettles \r\n  sought treatment of the injury from a neurologist, Dr. John K. Johnson, in June \r\n  of 1993. Initially, Dr. Johnson treated Nettles' injury conservatively with \r\n  therapy; however, when the pain persisted he performed an anterior cervical \r\n  diskectomy of the C5 and C6 vertebrae and an autogenous iliac bone graft fusion \r\n  (collectively \"ACDF\") on February 1, 1994. The ACDF procedure involved the harvesting \r\n  of bone from Nettles' right iliac crest for use in the fusion of two vertebrae \r\n  in Nettles' spine.(1) Nettles recovered nicely \r\n  from the ACDF surgery and was released from Dr. Johnson's care on April 18, \r\n  1994.  \r\n   \r\nOn August 24, 1994, Nettles filed \r\n  a Form 50 with the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (commission) \r\n  claiming total specific disability of her back and neck resulting from the aforementioned \r\n  injury by accident. She also requested a hearing before the commission. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn November 2, 1994, approximately \r\n  seven months after Dr. Johnson released Nettles from his care following the \r\n  ACDF surgery, she returned to Dr. Johnson for pain emanating from the incision \r\n  made during the graft taken from her iliac crest. After several office visits, \r\n  Dr. Johnson was unable to determine the cause of Nettles' discomfort, so he \r\n  performed exploratory surgery of the iliac crest on February 13, 1995. The surgery \r\n  did not relieve the pain so Dr. Johnson referred Nettles to a general surgeon, \r\n  Dr. Joseph McAlhany, who performed a third surgery on her iliac crest in June \r\n  of 1995. \r\n   \r\nDr. Johnson prescribed various medicines \r\n  to treat the pain in Nettles' iliac crest, including Ansaid, Tylenol #4, Lortab \r\n  5, Snyalgos DC, Ultram, Inderal, Ativan, Phenergan (for nausea), and Elavil \r\n  (for depression). As she took these medicines, Nettles began to experience weight \r\n  loss, nausea, and weakness.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn February 6, 1996, Nettles collapsed \r\n  while attending vocational rehabilitation therapy at the Center for Health and \r\n  Occupational Services. She was rushed to the Mary Black Memorial Hospital where \r\n  it was discovered that she had severe anemia, stomach ulcerations, and was underweight. \r\n  Dr. Frank Lopez, a gastroenterologist, opined to a degree of medical certainty \r\n  that the cause of Nettles' ulcers were some of the medications she had been \r\n  prescribed during the treatment of the pain in the iliac crest. Dr. Lopez could \r\n  not assign any impairment rating for Nettles' gastrointestinal disorder because \r\n  he could not assess other factors such as stress or physical activity.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn May 2, 1997, the Employer filed \r\n  a Form 21 with the commission for a hearing to stop payment because Nettles \r\n  had reached MMI and to pay compensation in the amount of 19% to the leg.(2) \r\n  The hearing was conducted on July 25, 1997, before a Single Commissioner (commissioner). \r\n  The commissioner issued his final decision on August 13, 1997. In a section \r\n  entitled \"Evidence of the Case,\" the commissioner noted that Nettles claimed \r\n  varying degrees of disability to her neck, hip and stomach due to the injury \r\n  by accident. In that same section, the commissioner recited the medical evidence \r\n  concerning the treatment Nettles received for a spinal injury, pain in the iliac \r\n  region, and gastrointestinal problems resulting from the \"nonsteroidal medication\" \r\n  prescribed by Dr. Johnson. The commissioner went on to make \"findings of fact\" \r\n  which included a finding that Nettles suffered permanent partial disability \r\n  of 25% for the injury to her spine and 10% for the injury to her stomach. There \r\n  were no findings of fact concerning the problems associated with the iliac crest. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn August 25, 1997, Nettles filed \r\n  a Form 30 requesting the commission review the decision of the commissioner. \r\n  Specifically, Nettles raised the issue of whether the \"Commissioner err[ed] \r\n  in failing to find that [Nettles] had a compensable injury to her right iliac \r\n  crest.\" By order dated February 26, 1998, the commission adopted the commissioner's \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law in their entirety and affirmed the commissioner. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNettles perfected a timely appeal \r\n  of the commission's decision to the circuit court which affirmed the commission \r\n  in an order dated December 10, 1998. Although the circuit court noted that Nettles \r\n  set forth seven exceptions to the commission's decision including its \"failure \r\n  to award permanent partial disability to the right iliac crest,\" the court found \r\n  there was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission's failure \r\n  to award any disability to the right iliac crest. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' \r\n  Compensation Commission. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 \r\n  S.E.2d 304 (1981). The reviewing court may not substitute its \"judgment for \r\n  that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, \r\n  but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.\" Lester \r\n  v. South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n, 328 S.C. 535, 538, 493 S.E.2d \r\n  103, 105 (Ct. App. 1997) rev'd in part on other grounds 334 S.C. 557, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 751 (1999). We must affirm the commission's decision unless it is \r\n  \"'clearly erroneous' in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.\" \r\n  Lark, 276 S.C. at 136, 276 S.E.2d at 307. Substantial evidence is evidence \r\n  that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the same conclusion that the full commission reached. Miller v. State Roofing \r\n  Co., 312 S.C. 452, 441 S.E.2d 323 (1994). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNettles argues the circuit court \r\n  erred by affirming the commission which analyzed her various ailments as separate \r\n  specific disabilities rather than amalgamating them into a general disability. \r\n  The employer responds by asserting that \"[g]eneral disability is not now, and \r\n  never has been a part of this case.\" Although we believe Nettles properly raised \r\n  a claim of general disability to the commission, we find no evidence in the \r\n  record of lost earning capacity to support such a claim. Accordingly, we affirm \r\n  the decision below.\r\n \r\nOn August 24, 1994, Nettles filed \r\n  a Form 50 with the commission seeking workers' compensation benefits for a permanent \r\n  disability of her \"neck and back.\"(3) By \"checking \r\n  a box\" in paragraph 8 of the Form 50, Nettles characterized the \"nature and \r\n  extent\" of her disability as \"Specific\" rather than \"General.\" However, during \r\n  a stop-payment hearing on July 25, 1997, Nettles's attorney orally raised a \r\n  claim of \"total disability\" based upon the emergence of hip and gastrointestinal \r\n  complications from the compensable neck injury. Those claims were heard without \r\n  objection by the single commissioner.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA designation of either specific \r\n  or general disability on a Form 50 is not an election of remedies. Harbin \r\n  v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas, 316 S.C. 423, 450 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n  In Harbin, this Court held that a claim to \"any and all rights\" under \r\n  the Workers' Compensation Act was sufficient to plead a specific disability \r\n  even though the claimant had checked the general disability box on his Form \r\n  50. In the claim sub judice, paragraph 12 of the Form 50 contained a \r\n  boilerplate claim for \"[a]ppropriate benefits as provided in the [Workers' Compensation] \r\n  Act for the above grounds and other relief as the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Commission may direct as just and proper.\" (Emphasis added). This boilerplate \r\n  claim is sufficiently analogous to the language of Harbin to constitute \r\n  a general disability claim. Cf. Halks v. Rust Eng'g Co., 208 S.C. \r\n  39, 45, 36 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1946) (\"[W]hen a claim is filed, all elements of \r\n  compensation are included, the Court stating that 'it was not contemplated by \r\n  the Act that different parts of the total result of one accident should be regarded \r\n  as separate claims.'\")(quoting Gold v. Moragne, 202 S.C. 281, \r\n  291, 24 S.E.2d 491, 494 (1943)). Accordingly, Nettles's general disability claim \r\n  was properly before the commission. \r\n   \r\nThe circuit court did not err in \r\n  upholding the commission's failure to award general disability benefits because \r\n  Nettles failed to demonstrate any loss of earning capacity. In Fields v. \r\n  Owens Corning Fiberglas, the supreme court stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder our Worker's Compensation Act, \r\n  a claimant may proceed under Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-20 to prove a general disability; \r\n  alternatively, he or she may proceed under Â§ 42-9-30 to prove a loss, or loss \r\n  of use of, a member, organ, or part of the body for which specific awards are \r\n  listed in the statute. It is well-settled that an award under the general disability \r\n  statutes must be predicated upon a showing of a loss of earning capacity, \r\n  whereas an award under the scheduled loss statute does not require such a showing. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFields, 301 S.C. 554, 555, \r\n  393 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1990) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see also \r\n  Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 517 S.E.2d 698 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nNettles contends \"[t]here is no substantial \r\n  evidence indicating that [she] is able to work.\" However, Fields and \r\n  its progeny clearly require proof of loss of earning capacity; the record reveals \r\n  no such evidence. In fact, the record contains no evidence that Nettles even \r\n  sought employment. See Floyd v. City of Charleston, 287 S.C. 474, \r\n  339 S.E.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1986) (employee has burden of showing that she could \r\n  neither hold any other employment nor locate another job). Accordingly, Nettles \r\n  has not established that she is entitled to a general disability award. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNettles also contends the circuit \r\n  court erred in finding substantial evidence to support the full commission's \r\n  failure to award her partial disability for her right lower extremity. As the \r\n  commission made no specific finding of fact concerning this issue, but implicitly \r\n  ruled on it, we must remand the issue to the commission for a proper finding.(4) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn awarding permanent partial disability \r\n  benefits for the neck and stomach injuries, but not for the related hip injury, \r\n  the commission implicitly ruled that Nettles suffered no debilitating injury \r\n  to her hip. See Dameron v. Spartan Mills, 211 S.C. 217, 44 S.E.2d \r\n  465 (1947) (commission implicitly ruled the claimant had reasonably pursued \r\n  her claim by denying her employer's motion to charge her with the costs of the \r\n  action); Halks v. Rust Eng'g Co., 208 S.C. 39, 36 S.E.2d 852 (1946) (commission \r\n  implicitly found the claimant had reached MMI by granting award for serious \r\n  disfigurement because the relevant statute prohibited such an award if claimant \r\n  had not reached MMI); Morgan v. JPS Automotive, 321 S.C. 201, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  457 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding that the commission's award of 100% disability \r\n  to the right arm \"impliedly\" rejected the claimant's whole body disability claim). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough Nettles only suffered one \r\n  compensable injury to her spine, she sought disability benefits for her spine, \r\n  hip (right lower extremity), and stomach. Workers' Compensation only awards \r\n  benefits for disabilities causally connected to a work-related injury. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§42-1-160 (Supp. 1999); see also Owings v. Anderson County \r\n  Sheriff's Dep't., 315 S.C. 297, 433 S.E.2d 869 (1993); Kennedy v. Williamsburg \r\n  County, 242 S.C. 477, 131 S.E.2d 512 (1963). Therefore, Nettles had to establish \r\n  a causal connection between each alleged disability and her spinal injury. See \r\n  Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 538, 482 S.E.2d \r\n  577, 580 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"A condition which is induced by a physical injury, \r\n  is thereby causally related to that injury.\"). Nettles established the causal \r\n  connections by showing her spinal disability was directly linked to the spinal \r\n  injury, whereas her hip and stomach disabilities resulted from the treatment \r\n  of her spinal disability which, in turn, was caused by the job-related injury. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn February 1, 1994, Dr. Johnson \r\n  performed the ACDF procedure on Nettles's spine which corrected the injury to \r\n  her neck. After a satisfactory recovery, Johnson released Nettles from his care \r\n  on April 18, 1994. Approximately four months later, Nettles began to experience \r\n  pain in her right hip near the site where Dr. Johnson harvested bone for use \r\n  in the ACDF surgery. Dr. Johnson prescribed a variety of different medicines \r\n  to treat the hip. Some of those medicines led to the onset of gastrointestinal \r\n  problems in February 1996, nearly two years after Nettles was released from \r\n  the ACDF surgery.  \r\n   \r\nThe causal link between the spinal \r\n  injury and ACDF surgery is direct and obvious. The link between the spinal injury \r\n  and the hip pain is indirect as the hip problem was a complication of the ACDF \r\n  surgery, not the injury itself. The link between the spinal injury and Nettles's \r\n  stomach difficulties is even more attenuated than that of the hip because the \r\n  stomach is a complication of the hip which itself is a complication of the ACDF \r\n  surgery. The commission could not have causally linked the stomach problem to \r\n  the ACDF surgery without also finding that the hip was linked to the surgery. \r\n  Therefore, the commission \"implicitly\" ruled that although the hip problem was \r\n  causally connected to the injury, it did not cause Nettles any permanent disability \r\n  thereby justifying an award of 25% permanent partial disability for the spine, \r\n  10% for the stomach, but nothing for the hip.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe commission's implicit ruling \r\n  concerning the hip is too indefinite for this Court to review. The commission \r\n  must make specific findings of fact upon which a claimant's right to compensation \r\n  are based. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-350 (1986); Shealy v. Algernon \r\n  Blair, Inc., 250 S.C. 106, 109, 156 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1967); 73A C.J.S. Public \r\n  Administrative Law and Procedure Â§144, at 104 (1983) (\"Where the requirements \r\n  as to administrative findings are contained in statutes, the findings must comply \r\n  therewith.\"). In fact, \"awards without such specific findings do not comply \r\n  with the requirements of the [workers' compensation] act and are illegal.\" Id. \r\n  at 110, 156 S.E.2d at 648; see also Airco, Inc. v. Hollington, \r\n  269 S.C. 152, 160, 236 S.E.2d 804, 808 (1977) (finding that the commission has \r\n  a statutory duty to make a finding of fact for all \"essential factual issues.\"). \r\n  This court cannot make findings of fact when the commission has failed to do \r\n  so because, in doing so, this court would improperly assume the commission's \r\n  role as factfinder. Fox v. Newberry County Memorial Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, \r\n  280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995). Because the commission did not make specific \r\n  findings of fact to support its ruling, we must remand the issue to the commission. \r\n  See, e.g., Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  366 (1995) (holding an order of the commission that does not include sufficiently \r\n  detailed findings of fact must be remanded to the commission).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNettles also argues the circuit court \r\n  erred by affirming the commission because the commission failed to order her \r\n  employer to pay $4,100.00 in medical expenses which were incurred primarily \r\n  during the treatment of her stomach disorder. We agree.\r\n  \r\nThe Employer concedes this issue \r\n  in part: \" [T]o the extent the Claimant has documented out-of-pocket medical \r\n  expenses causally related to her job injury and owing to treating physicians \r\n  authorized by the School District, the School District will process them for \r\n  payment . . . .\" As the record contains evidence of unreimbursed medical expenses \r\n  which are causally related to the compensable injury, we remand this issue to \r\n  the commission for a determination of what medical expenses are owed Nettles. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Nettles argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in finding the commission's determination that she achieved MMI \r\n  on April 14, 1997, was supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is substantial evidence to \r\n  support the commission's finding that Nettles reached MMI on April 14, 1997. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 1999) ([t]he court shall not \r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence \r\n  on questions of fact); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d \r\n  304 (1981). Dr. Johnson found Nettles had reached MMI with regard to her cervical \r\n  spine on January 24, 1997. Additionally, Dr. Shallcross opined that Nettles \r\n  had reached MMI on April 14, 1997, and assigned a whole person impairment rating \r\n  of 15% as well as impairment ratings to Nettles spine and right lower extremity. \r\n  Where there is conflicting medical evidence, as in this case, the findings of \r\n  fact of the commission are conclusive. Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., \r\n  318 S.C. 431, 458 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1995). Therefore, the circuit court did \r\n  not err in finding that the commission's determination that Nettles reached \r\n  MMI on April 14, 1997, was supported by substantial evidence. \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold that Nettles failed to prove \r\n  she is entitled to a general disability award and that the commission's determination \r\n  that Nettles reached maximum medical improvement on April 14, 1997, is supported \r\n  by substantial evidence. We also hold that the employer is required by law to \r\n  pay for that treatment which tended to lessen the period of Nettles's gastrointestinal \r\n  disability and remand the action for a proper determination of those expenses. \r\n  Finally, we find insufficient evidence in the record to review the commission's \r\n  denial of an award of permanent partial disability for the complication arising \r\n  from the operations performed on Nettles's right hip and remand the action to \r\n  the commission for a proper finding. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order \r\n  of the circuit court is  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J. and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n1. \r\n An iliac crest is \r\nthe \"thickened and expanded upper border of the ilium.\" Blakiston's Pocket \r\nMedical Dictionary 386 (3rd ed. 1973). The ilium is the \r\nupper \"broad portion of the hipbone.\" Id. \r\n2. \r\n Dr. Shallcross opined that \r\nNettles suffers from a meralgia paresthetica (an abnormal pain in the thigh usually \r\nresulting from the resumption of blood flow to a nerve after a mild injury) which \r\nentitled her to a 9% impairment of her \"right lower extremity\" as reckoned by \r\nthe American Medical Associations' Guide to Evaluation of Permanent Impairment \r\n(4th ed.). Dr. Shallcross also opined that Nettles was entitled to \r\na 15% whole body impairment for her cervical radiculopathy (impairment of the \r\nspinal nerves in the neck). The neck and thigh pain combine for a whole body impairment \r\nof 19%. \r\n3. \r\n At that time, neither the \r\npain in Nettles's iliac crest nor her gastrointestinal difficulties had presented \r\nthemselves. \r\n4.  \r\n  The commission's failure to explicitly rule on an issue raised to it in a Form \r\n  30 does not create an error preservation problem although a similar omission \r\n  in a civil proceeding would be fatal. While a trial court's ruling may be challenged \r\n  by an aggrieved party with a motion to reconsider under Rule 59 or 60, worker's \r\n  compensation law does not contain a motion to reconsider before the commission. \r\n  An aggrieved party may not challenge the commission's decision with a motion \r\n  to the commission, but only with an appeal to the circuit court. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§42-17-60 (Supp. 1999) (\"The award of the commission . . . is \r\n  conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\"); S.C. ADC 67-215 (\"[The \r\n  commission] will not address a motion involving the merits of the claim . . \r\n  . .\"); compare Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. \r\n  348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (finding that an inaccuracy in the trial court's \r\n  order must be raised to the trial court by way of a Rule 59(e) motion to alter \r\n  or amend a judgment before the inaccuracy may be challenged on appeal), with \r\n  Lloyd v. AT&amp;T Nassau Metals Corp., 299 S.C. 207, 209, 383 S.E.2d \r\n  257, 259 (Ct. App. 1989) (\"[T]he proper remedy [to an error in the single commissioner's \r\n  order] is a timely appeal to the full Commission and then to the courts. . . \r\n  . It is a rule of repose.\"). Accordingly, the commission's failure to rule on \r\n  Nettles's alleged hip injury did not prevent her from raising the issue to the \r\n  circuit court because she raised the issue on her Form 30 and could not have \r\n  made a motion for the commission to reconsider its order. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3214","title":"State v.

He was sentenced to thirty years for kidnapping and ten consecutive \r\n  years for ABHAN. On appeal, Primus argues the trial court erred in permitting \r\n  the Assistant Solicitor to comment on Primus' failure to produce evidence in \r\n  his defense. We reverse. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nPrimus was charged with first degree \r\n  criminal sexual conduct, second degree burglary and kidnapping for events which \r\n  occurred on July 13, 1997. The State presented evidence that Primus, armed with \r\n  a rusty and pointed metal object, forced Nikki Scott (Victim) into an abandoned \r\n  house where he raped her. \r\n   \r\nThe victim testified that on July \r\n  12 she saw Primus at a cookout at a gas station in St. George, where the victim \r\n  drank about three beers. Around 10:00 p.m., Primus gave the victim a ride from \r\n  the station to a club in Bowman, where she drank about five or six beers. The \r\n  victim left the club at 2:00 a.m. and was driven home by her boyfriend. At 4:30 \r\n  a.m., she left her house \"with another person\" and returned home before 6:30 \r\n  a.m. \r\n   \r\nAround 7:00 a.m. on July 13, Primus \r\n  drove to the victim's house and invited her to ride with him to his uncle's \r\n  house. The victim agreed to accompany Primus and voluntarily got into his car. \r\n  She had known Primus for about seven years and had even been on one date with \r\n  him in the past. \r\n   \r\nAccording to the victim, Primus told \r\n  her that he was going to get some gas money from his house, but instead drove \r\n  to an abandoned house and demanded she get out of his car. When the victim refused, \r\n  Primus threatened her with a pointed, rusty weapon and pulled her out of the \r\n  car. He pushed the victim inside the house where he ordered her to undress. \r\n  Primus had begun assaulting her when the victim \"kneed him\" and escaped through \r\n  a window.  \r\n   \r\nOutside the house, the victim attempted \r\n  to attract the attention of a passing truck but was forced to the ground by \r\n  Primus. While on the ground, she found a stick which she used against her assailant, \r\n  \"jab[bing]\" him in the chest and gouging him in the eye. She then ran naked \r\n  and bleeding to a nearby house. The victim immediately claimed Primus raped \r\n  her. She repeated the same story to police and medical personnel. In addition \r\n  to naming her attacker, the victim described his car as a red convertible which \r\n  he cranked with a screwdriver instead of a key. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile searching the abandoned house, \r\n  police found the weapon the victim had described. Her clothing was discovered \r\n  inside the house where she testified Primus forced her to undress. A broken \r\n  window matched her description of how she escaped the home. The police uncovered \r\n  a latent fingerprint matching Primus' right index finger on the inside doorknob \r\n  of the house. \r\n   \r\nHubert and Toni Shieder, who lived \r\n  at the home where the victim sought help, described her as naked, bleeding, \r\n  and very upset. The Shieders testified the victim immediately declared she had \r\n  been raped. Officers found on the Shieders' porch the stick the victim used \r\n  to defend herself. The victim's blood was found on the middle of the stick. \r\n  On one end of the stick, blood consistent with the victim's DNA was found. Blood \r\n  inconsistent with the victim's DNA but consistent with Primus' DNA was located \r\n  on the other end of the stick. Because of the limited amount of blood on the \r\n  stick, there were interpretable results for only two of the eight sites normally \r\n  tested. Thus, one person in every 174 people would have the same genetic markers \r\n  found in that blood. The test results \"could not exclude James Primus as a donor.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLater on the day of the crimes, police \r\n  discovered a red convertible abandoned on the side of the highway. The car, \r\n  which was registered to Primus, had a \"punched ignition,\" which indicated a \r\n  screwdriver may have been used to crank it. When the police arrested Primus, \r\n  he had several scratches on his body and a gouge mark on his eye matching the \r\n  wound the victim said she inflicted on her attacker. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Primus did not testify \r\n  or call witnesses, but the State introduced testimony he offered an alibi to \r\n  police when questioned. Specifically, Primus told police he had eaten breakfast \r\n  at 7:00 a.m. at a Shoney's restaurant and visited his uncle, Joe Hodges, during \r\n  the time frame of the alleged crimes. He stayed at his uncle's house about three \r\n  hours. Primus claimed that after he visited his uncle, his car broke down on \r\n  the side of the road. He accepted a ride from a stranger into town where he \r\n  played basketball with a guy he had never met before named David. Primus asserted \r\n  \"this was the first time they ever played basketball together, didn't know him, \r\n  and didn't know where he lived.\" Primus explained he received his wounds while \r\n  playing basketball. As for Primus' car, an officer, who remembered driving in \r\n  the area at approximately 10:00 a.m. on the morning of the crimes, stated there \r\n  was no red convertible on the side of the highway. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe record reflects the following \r\n  exchange occurred during the State's closing argument: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[Assistant Solicitor]: Primus's statement \r\n  has to admit a few facts when he talked to the police he had to admit a few \r\n  things, had to come up with some reason. Of course it wasn't because I attacked \r\n  [Victim] and dragged her into an abandoned house and raped her, no, no, no, \r\n  no. It was because I was playing basketball. He also had to admit that he was \r\n  up all night, he was driving around. He never went to bed. He told you that. \r\n  He was up and at them all night long that night. We know that was true because \r\n  he was at [Victim's] house at 6:30 or 7:00 and taking her out to Gum Branch \r\n  Road and raping her all during this period.  \r\n   \r\nAnd the crucial period when Detective \r\n  Bills told you he was most interested in was this Shoney's and Uncle Joe Hodges' \r\n  house. Of course, you can't hold the fact that Mr. Primus didn't present any \r\n  evidence against him, but don't you think that would have made his alibi a lot \r\n  stronger if Joe Hodges, his own uncle, had come to court and said, oh, he couldn't \r\n  have been on Gum Branch Road raping this woman because he was at my house in \r\n  Corey Woods? (Emphasis Added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[Defense Counsel]: I have an objection, \r\n  your Honor. We don't have to bring those people to court, Judge. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court: I'll be telling you later \r\n  on, I give each attorney a lot of leeway in making their summation to you and \r\n  I'll be telling you the defendant doesn't have to do anything, doesn't have \r\n  to prove anything, but I'll be explaining more to you later. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGo ahead, Solicitor. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter closing arguments, the trial \r\n  court charged the jury as to the applicable law, including an instruction on \r\n  Primus' right not to testify or present evidence in his defense. The jury found \r\n  Primus guilty of kidnapping and not guilty of second degree burglary. On the \r\n  charge of first degree criminal sexual conduct, the jury found Primus guilty \r\n  of the lesser offense of ABHAN. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUE\r\n  \r\nDid the trial court err in permitting \r\n  the Assistant Solicitor to comment on Primus' failure to produce evidence in \r\n  his defense? \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPrimus contends the trial court erred \r\n  in allowing the Assistant Solicitor to comment on his failure to call witnesses \r\n  to support the alibi story he told police. Primus avers the Assistant Solicitor's \r\n  remarks improperly shifted the burden of proof to him. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. STATE'S CLOSING \r\n  ARGUMENT \r\n   \r\nSolicitors must confine their closing \r\n  arguments to evidence in the record, tailoring comments to the evidence presented \r\n  and its reasonable inferences. State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170, 284 S.E.2d \r\n  357 (1981); State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981). Where \r\n  a defendant presents evidence at trial, the prosecutor may comment on the defendant's \r\n  failure to present the testimony of seemingly accessible witnesses who are or \r\n  should be aware of relevant information. Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, \r\n  504 S.E.2d 307 (1998); State v. Shackelford, 228 S.C. 9, 88 S.E.2d 778 \r\n  (1955). \r\n   \r\nHowever, where the defendant produces \r\n  no evidence on his behalf, it is improper for the prosecutor to comment on the \r\n  defendant's failure to call a particular witness. See State v. Pickens, \r\n  320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996); State v. Posey, 269 S.C. 500, 238 \r\n  S.E.2d 176 (1977). The jury should ordinarily be instructed not to draw inferences \r\n  from the neglect of a defendant to call witnesses. Douglas, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court, in State v. Browning, \r\n  154 S.C. 97, 151 S.E. 233 (1930), explained the principle as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is true . . . that the defendant \r\n  did not take the stand to deny or explain the evidence adduced against him, \r\n  and that he did not offer any evidence in his behalf. . . . The defendant had \r\n  the constitutional right to adopt these courses if he chose to do so, and neither \r\n  the lower court nor this Court have the right to punish him for the exercise \r\n  of either of those rights. And even if the defendant chose to remain silent \r\n  at his trial, that fact did not reverse the usual rule of the law that the burden \r\n  of establishing the defendant's guilt still remained on the State. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrowning, 154 S.C. at 102, \r\n  151 S.E. at 235. \r\n   \r\nIn State v. Posey, supra, \r\n  our Supreme Court was faced with a situation similar to the case at bar. Posey \r\n  did not testify and presented no witnesses in his behalf at his murder trial. \r\n  In closing argument, the Solicitor was permitted, over objection, to comment \r\n  upon the failure of Posey to call an eyewitness to the crime to testify and \r\n  was allowed to argue that an inference adverse to Posey could be drawn therefrom. \r\n  On appeal, Posey contended the Solicitor's argument was prejudicial in that \r\n  it deprived him of the presumption of innocence and his right to rely upon the \r\n  failure of the State's evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\n  In reversing Posey's conviction for murder, the Court explicated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe question than [sic] to be decided \r\n  is whether it was prejudicial error to permit the solicitor to comment, in argument \r\n  to the jury, upon the failure of appellant to call an eyewitness within his \r\n  control to testify, where appellant had presented no evidence during the trial. \r\n  We reverse upon the authority of State v. Simmons, 267 S.C. 479, 229 \r\n  S.E.2d 597 (1976). \r\n   \r\nIn Simmons, the defendant \r\n  did not testify nor present any evidence and the trial judge permitted the solicitor \r\n  to comment in argument upon the failure of the defendant to produce his wife \r\n  as a witness. In reversing, this Court pointed out that, while the wife in that \r\n  case was not an available or compellable witness, the rule, which permitted \r\n  an adverse inference comment upon the failure of a party to produce a witness \r\n  exclusively in his control, did not apply to a criminal defendant who introduces \r\n  no evidence at all . . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . . \r\n   \r\nThe solicitor was permitted, in argument, \r\n  to draw an adverse inference from [Posey's] failure to produce a certain witness. \r\n  This had the effect of depriving [Posey] of the right to offer no evidence and \r\n  rely upon the insufficiency of the State's case against him. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPosey, 269 S.C. at 503, 238 \r\n  S.E.2d at 177. \r\n   \r\nIt is never permissible for the prosecutor \r\n  to suggest to the jury that it draw an adverse inference when the defendant \r\n  fails to present any evidence at trial, since the defendant may let the case \r\n  go to the jury on the basis that the prosecution did not meet its burden of \r\n  proof. Id. The rule applies only in cases where a defendant fails to \r\n  present any evidence at all. Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, 504 S.E.2d \r\n  307 (1998); State v. Bamberg, 270 S.C. 77, 240 S.E.2d 639 (1977). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn accused is presumed innocent until \r\n  proven guilty. The burden is upon the State to prove the accused committed the \r\n  crime charged. An accused has the right to rely entirely upon this presumption \r\n  of innocence and the weakness in the State's case against him. He would clearly \r\n  be deprived of that right if an adverse inference is permitted to be indulged \r\n  against him because of its exercise. See State v. Posey, 269 S.C. \r\n  500, 238 S.E.2d 176 (1977). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the instant case, Primus presented \r\n  no evidence in his defense. It was thus improper for the Assistant Solicitor \r\n  to comment on Primus' failure to call his uncle, whom it would seem he could \r\n  produce at will, as a witness. We take this opportunity to strenuously caution \r\n  members of the Bar, particularly attorneys for the State, to carefully tailor \r\n  their arguments within constitutional guidelines and restrictions. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause the Assistant Solicitor's \r\n  argument was improper, the trial court erred in allowing it. The court should \r\n  have sustained defense counsel's objection and immediately issued a curative \r\n  instruction. Rather than issue a curative instruction, however, the trial court \r\n  in the present case informed the jury that counsel was permitted \"a lot of leeway\" \r\n  in making closing arguments. The judge then exacerbated the problem with the \r\n  statement \"Go ahead, Solicitor,\" which imparted an air of approval to the prosecutor's \r\n  comment.  \r\nEffectually, the trial judge in the \r\n  case sub judice overruled defense counsel's objection. This was \r\n  error. \r\n   \r\nII. ERROR PRESERVATION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNext, we consider whether the issue \r\n  was preserved where Primus had neither requested a curative instruction nor \r\n  moved for a mistrial. \r\n   \r\nIt is a fundamental principle that \r\n  a contemporaneous objection is required at trial to properly preserve an error \r\n  for appellate review. State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 \r\n  (1994)(to preserve error for appellate review, defendant must make contemporaneous \r\n  objection on specific ground); State v. Black, 319 S.C. 515, 462 S.E.2d \r\n  311 (Ct. App. 1995). The proper course to be pursued when counsel makes an improper \r\n  argument is for opposing counsel to immediately object and to have a record \r\n  made of the statements or language complained of and to ask the court for a \r\n  distinct ruling thereon. Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. \r\n  155, 345 S.E.2d 711 (1986); State v. Williams, 266 S.C. 325, 223 S.E.2d \r\n  38 (1976); Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 165 S.E.2d 797 (1969); Crocker \r\n  v. Weathers, 240 S.C. 412, 126 S.E.2d 335 (1962); State v. Meehan, \r\n  160 S.C. 111, 158 S.E. 151 (1931); Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, \r\n  et al., 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998); State v. Black, \r\n  supra. \r\n   \r\nThe dichotomy in regard to an error \r\n  preservation issue as juxtaposed to an alleged improper argument is: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) an objection that is sustained \r\n  followed by action or inaction of the trial judge as to a curative instruction; \r\n  and \r\n   \r\n(2) an objection that is overruled. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Objection Sustained \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the first scenario, \r\n  the cases are legion in holding that if an appellant objects and the objection \r\n  is sustained but he does not move for a curative instruction or request \r\n  a mistrial, he has received what he asked for and cannot be heard to complain \r\n  on appeal. See McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. \r\n  327, 479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996). See also State v. Patterson, \r\n  324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997)(issue concerning propriety of Solicitor's \r\n  comments in closing argument was not preserved for review where defendant objected, \r\n  trial court ruled in defendant's favor, and defendant failed to move to strike \r\n  or request curative instruction). When objection is timely made to improper \r\n  remarks of counsel, the judge should rule on the objection, give a curative \r\n  charge to the jury, and instruct offending counsel to desist from improper remarks. \r\n  State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 468 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1996); McElveen \r\n  v. Ferre, 299 S.C. 377, 385 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 1989). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhere a curative instruction is given \r\n  and the objecting party does not contemporaneously challenge the sufficiency \r\n  of the corrective charge or move for mistrial, no issue is preserved for review. \r\n  See State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996)(no issue is \r\n  preserved for appellate review if objecting party accepts judge's ruling and \r\n  does not contemporaneously make additional objection to sufficiency of curative \r\n  charge or move for mistrial); State v. Penland, 275 S.C. 537, 273 S.E.2d \r\n  765 (1981)(defendant's failure to move for mistrial on grounds of improper argument \r\n  by State constitutes waiver of issue on appeal); State v. Harry, supra \r\n  (if judge gives curative charge, and initial objecting party is not satisfied \r\n  with instruction, a further objection and request for further instruction should \r\n  be made at that time; if objecting party fails to make this additional objection, \r\n  asserted misconduct of counsel is not preserved for review on appeal); State \r\n  v. Moyd, 321 S.C. 256, 468 S.E.2d 7 (Ct. App. 1996)(if objecting party accepts \r\n  ruling of trial judge and does not contemporaneously object to sufficiency of \r\n  curative instruction or move for mistrial, error deemed cured and issue not \r\n  preserved for appellate review); Kalchthaler v. Workman, 316 S.C. 499, \r\n  502, 450 S.E.2d 621, 622 (Ct. App. 1994)(\"Because Kalchthaler's lawyer voiced \r\n  no complaint about the sufficiency of the trial judge's instructions given in \r\n  response to the objection and because he requested neither additional instructions \r\n  addressed to the jury nor an admonition addressed to opposing counsel, appellate \r\n  review of the issues directed at the trial judge's failure to give curative \r\n  instructions and to admonish opposing counsel is unavailable.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Objection Overruled \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the second scenario, \r\n  a plethora of cases articulate the rule. Once an objection has been overruled, \r\n  it is not necessary to make a motion for mistrial or new trial to preserve \r\n  an error for appellate review. City of Columbia v. Myers, 278 S.C. 288, \r\n  294 S.E.2d 787 (1982); State v. Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 509 S.E.2d 280 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998). See also Bowers v. Watkins Carolina Express, Inc., \r\n  259 S.C. 371, 376, 192 S.E.2d 190, 192 (1972)(\"When the court, in effect, overruled \r\n  defendant's objection to the [closing] argument, it would have been futile to \r\n  move for a mistrial based upon the same objection.\"); State v. Williams, \r\n  212 S.C. 110, 116, 46 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1948)(\"It is no answer to suggest that \r\n  appellant should have asked for a mistrial, because due objection having been \r\n  made and the objection having been overruled, thereby indicating that this line \r\n  of argument was not considered improper, it is obvious that a motion for a mistrial \r\n  would have been a futile thing.\"). So long as the judge had an opportunity to \r\n  rule on an issue, and did so, it is not incumbent upon defense counsel to harass \r\n  the judge by parading the issue before him again by asking for a mistrial. See \r\n  Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, 426 S.E.2d 756 \r\n  (1993); State v. Higgenbottom, 337 S.C. 637, 525 S.E.2d 250 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999); State v. Liberte, 336 S.C. 648, 521 S.E.2d 744 (Ct. App. 1999); \r\n  State v. McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 462 S.E.2d 882 (Ct. App. 1995). Counsel \r\n  shall not attempt to further argue any matter after he has been heard and the \r\n  ruling of the court has been pronounced. Rule 18(a), SCRCrimP. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn City of Columbia v. Myers, \r\n  supra, the Supreme Court discussed whether the issue of improper closing \r\n  argument was preserved where defense counsel objected to comments made by the \r\n  attorney for the City of Columbia, the judge overruled the objection, and defense \r\n  counsel did not thereafter request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial. \r\n  The Court articulated: \r\n   \r\nIt is argued however that the issue \r\n  of improper closing argument by plaintiff's counsel was not preserved for review. \r\n  It is contended that the failure of defendant's counsel to request a curative \r\n  instruction, a mistrial or new trial after his objection had been overruled \r\n  is fatal. This Court has held in Bowers v. Watkins Carolina Express, Inc., \r\n  259 S.C. 371, 376, 192 S.E.2d 190, that motions for mistrial or new trial in \r\n  such circumstances would be futile and are not necessary to preserve a timely \r\n  objection for review. By the same logic it would be both futile and nonsensical \r\n  for counsel to request curative instructions from a trial court which has already \r\n  ruled an argument to be proper. This appeal is clearly governed by Bowers, \r\n  supra, and cannot in fact be dismissed without implicitly abandoning \r\n  that case as precedent. \r\n   \r\nCity of Columbia v. Myers, \r\n  278 S.C. at 289, 294 S.E.2d at 788. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe address the trial occurrences \r\n  with specificity in order to remove the obfuscation that is extant in this area \r\n  of the law. In the field of error preservation, logic and consistency are not \r\n  the best of friends. This case is the quintessential illustration of the second \r\n  scenario rule. A specific objection was timely made by defense \r\n  counsel which was effectively overruled by the trial judge's statement, \"Go \r\n  ahead, Solicitor.\" Because the court overruled Primus' objection to the improper \r\n  closing argument, it was not necessary for Primus to move for mistrial in order \r\n  to preserve the issue for our review. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. EFFICACY OF GENERAL \r\n  CHARGE \r\n   \r\nThe State claims the trial court's \r\n  jury charge on the law cured the error. We disagree. The court instructed the \r\n  jury regarding the State's burden to prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt. As to Primus' decision not to testify or present evidence, the court \r\n  charged: \r\n   \r\nWell, what is the law that I need \r\n  to tell you to apply to the facts that only you can find? Well, in the first \r\n  place, I told you earlier, I said the defendant did not testify and he did not \r\n  put up any evidence in this case. And I told you, you can't hold it against \r\n  him because he's merely exercising one of his constitutional rights, that is \r\n  not to testify or put up any evidence. So when you go back in your jury room \r\n  don't even talk about the fact that he did not take the stand or testify, [or] \r\n  put up any evidence.\r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough the instruction constitutes \r\n  a correct statement of the law, it does not cure the judge's error of permitting \r\n  the inappropriate comment by the Assistant Solicitor during closing argument. \r\n  The jury was never informed the Solicitor's remarks were improper. Moreover, \r\n  the charge on the law does not operate in a reparative vein so as to eliminate \r\n  the error which occurred during jury argument. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a case with strikingly similar \r\n  closing argument language emanating from the Solicitor, the Court enunciated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring his closing argument the solicitor \r\n  stated: \"One think [sic] they short me up on is I didn't put these officers \r\n  up. Well, I tell you one thing, they can call witnesses just like I can. And \r\n  [Douglas] did call witnesses.\" Douglas objected, and appellant joined in the \r\n  motion. The trial judge ruled appellant was entitled to protection under Doyle \r\n  v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). We agree. However, \r\n  the trial judge, not wanting to exacerbate the situation, refused to give a \r\n  curative instruction. We hold this was error. Furthermore, the trial judge's \r\n  general charge, which was given shortly afterwards, did not cure the error. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nState v. Pickens, 320 S.C. \r\n  528, 530, 466 S.E.2d 364, 365-66 (1996)(footnote omitted)(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. HARMLESS ERROR \r\n  ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\nPrimus maintains the Assistant Solicitor's \r\n  comments during closing argument were so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial. \r\n  We agree. \r\n   \r\nImproper closing argument does not \r\n  automatically require reversal of a conviction. State v. Huggins, 325 \r\n  S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997); State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 \r\n  S.E.2d 620 (1996). A new trial will not be granted unless the prosecutor's comments \r\n  during closing argument so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the \r\n  resulting conviction a denial of due process. Huggins, supra; \r\n  State v. Coleman, 301 S.C. 57, 389 S.E.2d 659 (1990). The appellant has \r\n  the burden of proving he or she did not receive a fair trial because of the \r\n  improper argument. State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981). \r\n  On appeal, this Court will review the alleged impropriety of argument in the \r\n  context of the entire record. State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170, 284 S.E.2d \r\n  357 (1981). See also State v. Nathari, 303 S.C. 188, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  597 (Ct. App. 1990)(propriety of State's closing argument will be examined in \r\n  light of entire record). \r\n   \r\nThe harmless error rule governs improper \r\n  comments made by a Solicitor during closing argument. See, e.g., \r\n  United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 \r\n  (1983)(applying harmless error analysis to improper comment by prosecutor during \r\n  closing argument as to defendant's silence at trial, in violation of the Fifth \r\n  Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause). \"[I]t is the duty of a reviewing court \r\n  to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless, \r\n  including most constitutional violations.\" Hasting, 461 U.S. at 509, \r\n  103 S.Ct. at 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d at 106. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe determination of whether an error \r\n  is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case. State v. \r\n  Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990). No definite rule of law governs \r\n  this finding. Id. Rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of \r\n  the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case. State \r\n  v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985). An error is harmless where \r\n  it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen a Doyle violation has \r\n  occurred, we apply a harmless error analysis. State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. \r\n  528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996). Where a review of the entire record establishes \r\n  the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be \r\n  reversed. Id. To be harmless, the record must establish (1) the reference \r\n  to the defendant's right to silence was a single reference, which was not repeated \r\n  or alluded to; (2) the solicitor did not tie the defendant's silence directly \r\n  to his exculpatory story; (3) the exculpatory story was totally implausible; \r\n  and (4) the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPrimus did not testify and relied \r\n  upon an alibi defense established through the examination of the State's witnesses. \r\n  The gist of the alibi defense consisted of four prongs: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) Breakfast at Shoney's around \r\n  7:00 a.m.;\r\n(2) Visit to his uncle Joe Hodges' \r\n  house for two to three hours;\r\n(3) Accepted ride with stranger into \r\n  town after car broke down on side of road; and \r\n(4) Played basketball with another \r\n  stranger (David) in town. \r\n   \r\nHere, the Assistant Solicitor's reference \r\n  to Primus' failure to call his uncle as a witness was a single reference. Yet, \r\n  Primus' exculpatory story was not totally implausible and the evidence of guilt \r\n  was not overwhelming. In addition, the State's argument tied Primus' silence \r\n  directly to his exculpatory story. The Assistant Solicitor's attack on the failure \r\n  of Primus to call his uncle as a witness goes to the heart of Primus' alibi \r\n  defense. Through the improper comment, the Assistant Solicitor, in effect, invited \r\n  the jury to make the very inference the jury is not allowed to make. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn examination of DNA evidence in \r\n  South Carolina demonstrates with clarity the weakness of the DNA evidence in \r\n  the present case. A litany of cases reveals the mathematical deficiency of the \r\n  DNA evidence in this case: State v. Register, 323 S.C. 471, 475, 476 \r\n  S.E.2d 153, 156 (1996)(\"The expert . . . stated that the frequency that this \r\n  pattern would occur in the population was one in two hundred and fifty million.\"); \r\n  State v. Dinkins, 319 S.C. 415, 416-17, 462 S.E.2d 59, 59 (1995)(\"SLED \r\n  DNA expert Steve Lambert testified the probability of finding appellant's particular \r\n  DNA pattern in an unrelated individual selected randomly in South Carolina is \r\n  one in 2.9 billion in the black population and one in 4.2 billion in the white \r\n  population.\"); State v. Ford, 301 S.C. 485, 488, 392 S.E.2d 781, 783 \r\n  (1990)(\"Testimony was presented that the combination of DNA fragments found \r\n  in Ford's DNA would only occur in one out of 23 million North American blacks.\"); \r\n  State v. Hyman, 322 S.C. 59, 61, 471 S.E.2d 466, 467 (Ct. App. 1996)(a \r\n  SLED agent, qualified as an expert in the field of DNA forensic analysis, declared \r\n  \"this particular DNA profile would be found among the male Caucasian population \r\n  selected at random from the state in approximately one out of every 6,700 individuals.\"); \r\n  State v. McFadden, 318 S.C. 404, 411, 458 S.E.2d 61, 65 (Ct. App. 1995)(a \r\n  microbiologist employed by SLED in the DNA analysis unit stated \"'the probability \r\n  of selecting an unrelated individual at random from the population having a \r\n  profile matching Willie McFadden's is approximately one in 710 million blacks \r\n  and one in 1.7 billion caucasians.'\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe State's evidence included a DNA \r\n  presentation concerning Primus. Matt Fitts, SLED's forensic DNA serology expert, \r\n  testified: \r\n   \r\n[T]he more DNA sites you look at \r\n  the more you meet that particular DNA profile, so the higher the statistics \r\n  are. As I mentioned earlier, the one in 1.1 billion. Since they were only able \r\n  to obtain, for instance on item 3.1, only two sites of eight, of course the \r\n  statistics aren't going to be as high, and the statistics that were calculated, \r\n  again, this is if I went through the population at random to see who would match \r\n  at those two different DNA sites, the frequency would be calculated as 1 \r\n  in 174 people, because we're only looking at two different sites. (Emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n   \r\nThe DNA frequency match calculated \r\n  in this case is at the bottom end of a random population analysis. Concomitantly, \r\n  the State's showing of guilt is not enhanced by the DNA evidence. The probability \r\n  of the DNA evidentiary statistic in this case is de minimus when \r\n  juxtaposed to the statistical analysis in Register, Dinkins, Ford, \r\n  Hyman, and McFadden. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe rule the Assistant Solicitor's \r\n  comment during closing argument as to Primus' failure to call his uncle as a \r\n  witness was improper. Thus, the trial court erred in permitting the remark and \r\n  not issuing a curative jury instruction. Considering the evidence of Primus' \r\n  guilt, the plausibility of his exculpatory story, and reviewing the evidentiary \r\n  record in its entirety, we find the probability of prejudicial error is such \r\n  as to mandate reversal. We hold the State did not present overwhelming \r\n  evidence of guilt. A harmless error analysis requires reversal. Accordingly, \r\n  Primus' convictions for kidnapping and ABHAN are \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3215","title":"Brown v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrown sustained an injury resulting \r\n  in a hernia while working for Bi-Lo, Inc. (Employer) in June 1994. Employer \r\n  provided Brown with medical treatment for the injury, which included hernia \r\n  surgery. The surgery caused some complications and led to neuropathy of her \r\n  right lower extremity.  \r\n   \r\nBrown subsequently moved to Pennsylvania, \r\n  and Employer agreed to continue providing treatment after her move. In 1997, \r\n  a question arose regarding whether Brown's ongoing treatment, including medical \r\n  treatment Brown sought for alleged subsequent falls, was related to the work \r\n  injury. In response, Brown filed a Form 50 requesting a hearing to obtain medical \r\n  treatment for injuries relating to these falls.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEmployer hired a rehabilitation nurse, \r\n  Judith Foriska, to contact Brown's treating physicians regarding the nature \r\n  of her condition and the cause of her falls. Subsequently, Brown's counsel wrote \r\n  a letter to Foriska warning her not to discuss Brown's condition with treating \r\n  physicians and threatening legal action if she did not comply. Brown's counsel \r\n  also wrote similar letters to Brown's treating physicians advising them not \r\n  to engage in ex parte communications with Employer or Employer's workers' \r\n  compensation carrier (Carrier) or their representatives. As a result of these \r\n  letters, one of Brown's treating physicians, Dr. Brian Boyle, indicated that \r\n  he would not respond to any of Employer's or Carrier's representatives.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\n The Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' \r\n  Compensation Commission.(1) We may not substitute \r\n  our judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on \r\n  questions of fact, but may reverse if the decision is affected by an error of \r\n  law.(2) We may reverse or modify a decision if \r\n  the findings and conclusions of the agency are affected by error of law, clearly \r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the \r\n  whole record, or arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion \r\n  or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.(3) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrown argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in requiring her counsel to cease and desist from obstructing contact between \r\n  Employer's or Carrier's representatives and her treating physicians. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe South Carolina workers' compensation \r\n  statutes and regulations compel a physician to provide employers with all medical \r\n  information and facts relevant to the claim communicated to them by an employee \r\n  during treatment. South Carolina Code section 42-15-80 provides in relevant \r\n  part: \r\n   \r\nNo fact communicated to or otherwise \r\n  learned by any physician or surgeon who may have attended or examined the employee, \r\n  or who may have been present at any examination, shall be privileged, either \r\n  in hearings provided for by this Title or any action at law brought to recover \r\n  damages against any employer who may have accepted the compensation provisions \r\n  of this Title.(4)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, section 42-15-95 states: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAll existing information compiled \r\n  by a health care facility, as defined in Section 44-7-130, or a health care \r\n  provider licensed pursuant to Title 40 pertaining directly to a workers' compensation \r\n  claim must be provided to the insurance carrier, the employer, the employee, \r\n  their attorneys, or the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission, within \r\n  fourteen days after receipt of written request.(5) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, South Carolina Code \r\n  Regulation 67-1301(A) requires \" [a] medical practitioner or treatment facility \r\n  . . . [to] furnish upon request all medical information relevant to the employee's \r\n  complaint of injury to the claimant, the employer, the employer's representative, \r\n  or the Commission.\"(6) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn support of her argument that ex \r\n  parte communications between a claimant's employer or its representatives and \r\n  a claimant's physician should be prohibited, Brown relies upon South Carolina \r\n  State Board of Medical Examiners v. Hedgepath(7) \r\n  and McCormick v. England.(8) Both of these \r\n  cases recognize the existence of a physician's duty of confidentiality and hold \r\n  that a physician violates this duty by revealing patient confidences when the \r\n  revelation was neither compelled by law (i.e., subpoena or statute) \r\n  nor consented to by the patient.(9)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHedgepath and McCormick, \r\n  however, involved physicians revealing confidences in divorce proceedings. Such \r\n  a rule has not been applied in workers' compensation cases. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the case at bar, Brown has not \r\n  consented to the disclosure of her medical information; therefore, access to \r\n  information from her treating physicians can only be obtained if it is compelled \r\n  by law. Section 42-15-95 and Regulation 67-1301(A)(10) \r\n  both compel treating physicians to reveal all the claimant's medical information \r\n  relevant to the claim upon request by the claimant's employer, the employer's \r\n  representative, or the commission.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold a physician does not breach \r\n  his or her duty of confidentiality by providing medical information relevant \r\n  to an employee's claim to an employer or its representative in workers' compensation \r\n  cases because the law compels a physician to do so.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, we find no reason to \r\n  ban ex parte communications between an employer or its representatives and a \r\n  physician in light of the policies underlying the Workers' Compensation Act.(11) \r\n  \"[T]he Act is a form of social legislation wherein and whereby the employer \r\n  and employee surrender benefits previously enjoyed under the common law in exchange \r\n  for other benefits provided under the Act.\"(12) \r\n  One such benefit is an employee's swift and sure compensation.(13) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nTo ensure swift compensation, employers \r\n  and their representatives must investigate claims immediately to provide medical \r\n  and disability benefits in a timely manner. In doing so, employers cannot be \r\n  prohibited from contacting treating physicians directly to determine issues \r\n  such as diagnosis, damages, and impairment. Requiring employers to use formal \r\n  discovery methods such as depositions, motions, and interrogatories would significantly \r\n  delay the process and increase the costs of coverage. \r\nMoreover, as Employer noted at oral \r\n  argument, allowing employers and their representatives the opportunity to interview \r\n  physicians outside the presence of the employee merely provides employers and \r\n  their representatives the same access to medical evidence as the employee.(14) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, J. concurs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMOREHEAD, A.J., concur in \r\n  a separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMOREHEAD, A.J. (concurring): \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI concur with the majority's opinion. \r\n  However, I am concerned by the potential for abuse in allowing ex parte communications \r\n  under these circumstances. Nevertheless, I feel these potential abuses will \r\n  have to be addressed by the South Carolina Legislature through statutory amendments \r\n  or by the Workers' Compensation Commission through regulations. \r\n1.

Bogan, both of State Grand Jury, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWARD, J.: \r\n  In this State Grand Jury prosecution, Jose Castineira was convicted of conspiracy \r\n  to traffic in 400 or more grams of cocaine in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999) and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and \r\n  a $200,000 fine. On appeal, Castineira contends the trial court erred in trying \r\n  him in absentia, denying a severance, limiting cross-examination of the State's \r\n  witness, and sentencing him to an illegal, excessive sentence. We affirm. \r\n\r\n \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThe prosecution of Castineira \r\n  and twenty-five co-defendants was the culmination of a two year State Grand \r\n  Jury (SGJ) investigation. The State concluded Castineira was \r\n  the central supplier of cocaine to the conspiracy. The investigation began in \r\n  August 1993, when police arrested Michael Greer on a cocaine charge and executed \r\n  a search warrant at his residence. Over the next two years, police followed \r\n  the chain of Greer's suppliers, continuing to make purchases and turning those \r\n  arrested into cooperating informants. \r\n   \r\nThe investigation eventually \r\n  led to O'Bryant (O. B.) Harris. The officers arrested O. B. Harris on August \r\n  31, 1996, after they observed a transaction involving an undercover drug payment \r\n  of $115,000. Once arrested, Harris cooperated, identifying Castineira as his \r\n  source. Officers arranged an undercover payoff to Castineira for cocaine previously \r\n  supplied on September 1, 1996. Castineira and Juan Carlos Vasquez, both Cuban \r\n  residents of Miami, arrived in a Mercedes Benz driven by Castineira. After a \r\n  brief (recorded) conversation in which Castineira discussed a large cocaine \r\n  deal, Castineira placed the money in his vehicle. He was then arrested. \r\n   \r\nOn October 8, 1996, the \r\n  SGJ indicted twenty-six defendants for conspiracy to traffic cocaine, 400 or \r\n  more grams, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999). Eighteen \r\n  defendants pled guilty and the remaining eight were tried together during a \r\n  two-week period in late April - early May 1997, including Castineira.\r\n  \r\nCastineira was tried in \r\n  his absence. The trial court denied motions for severance and for a continuance. \r\n  The jury convicted Castineira, and the trial court sentenced him for trafficking \r\n  in more than 400 grams of cocaine to thirty years in prison and a $200,000 fine. \r\n  \r\n \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n \r\nI. Whether the trial \r\n  court erred in trying Castineira in absentia? \r\n \r\nII. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in prohibiting the cross-examination of the State's chief \r\n  witness on the witness's understanding of his plea agreement? \r\n \r\nIII. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in denying Castineira's motion for a severance? \r\n \r\nIV. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in sentencing Castineira to a 30 year sentence and fine of \r\n  $200,000 because it exceeded the maximum allowable sentence for conspiracy under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (1985)? \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. \r\n  TRIAL IN ABSENTIA \r\n \r\n Castineira first argues \r\n  the trial court erred in trying him in absentia. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nRule 16 of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \r\n   \r\nExcept in cases wherein \r\n  capital punishment is a permissible sentence, a person indicted for misdemeanors \r\n  and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried \r\n  in his absence upon a finding by the court that such person has received notice \r\n  of his right to be present and that a warning was given that the trial would \r\n  proceed in his absence upon a failure to attend the court.  \r\nRule 16, SCRCrimP. \r\n   \r\nA trial judge must determine \r\n  a criminal defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial in \r\n  order to try the case in absentia. See Rule 16, SCRCrimP; State v. \r\n  Ritch, 292 S.C. 75, 354 S.E.2d 909 (1987); State v. Jackson, 288 \r\n  S.C. 94, 341 S.E.2d 375 (1986). The judge must make findings of fact on the \r\n  record that the defendant (1) received notice of his right to be present; and \r\n  (2) was warned he would be tried in his absence should he fail to attend. Jackson, \r\n  288 S.C. at 96, 341 S.E.2d at 375. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court fully complied \r\n  with the mandates of Rule 16, SCRCrimP. Castineira was represented by two attorneys. \r\n  The record establishes the trial judge made the requisite inquiries and findings; \r\n  and counsel stipulated that Castineira had received the proper notice. Therefore, \r\n  this issue is without merit. \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  CROSS-EXAMINATION\r\nCastineira next argues the \r\n  trial court erred in prohibiting his co-defendant, Vasquez, from cross-examining \r\n  State witness O.B. Harris about his understanding of his plea agreement. Castineira \r\n  contends the prohibition effectively denied all co-defendants the Sixth Amendment \r\n  right to confront him on this point. We need not address Castineira's standing \r\n  to assert this argument on appeal because the issue is not preserved for review. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the conclusion of the \r\n  cross-examination of Harris, Vasquez's counsel asked Harris about his understanding \r\n  of the limitations on sentencing under his plea agreement. The trial judge interrupted. \r\n  Counsel for Vasquez never objected to the trial court's intervention. Consequently, \r\n  this issue is not preserved for appellate review. See State v. Hicks, \r\n  330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1022 (1998) \r\n  (contemporaneous objection is required to preserve issue for direct appeal). \r\n  Furthermore, Vasquez's counsel immediately ended his examination. See \r\n  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d 642 (1998) (where counsel \r\n  acquiesces in judge's limitation of his cross-examination and makes no further \r\n  objection, appellate review of the issue is procedurally barred). \r\nIII. \r\n  SEVERANCE \r\n \r\nThird, Castineira argues \r\n  the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nA motion for severance is \r\n  addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and the court's ruling \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State \r\n  v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999); State v. Nichols, \r\n  325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997); State v. Boys, 302 S.C. 545, 397 \r\n  S.E.2d 529 (1990). Though mass conspiracy trials are cumbersome, denial of a \r\n  motion to sever does not amount to an abuse of discretion per se. As \r\n  our supreme court has stated: \"There can be no clearly defined rule for determining \r\n  when a defendant is entitled to a separate trial, because the exercise of discretion \r\n  means that the decision must be based upon a just and proper consideration of \r\n  the particular circumstances which are presented to the court in each case.\" \r\n  State v. McIntire, 221 S.C. 504, 514-15, 71 S.E.2d 410, 415 (1952). \r\n   \r\nHere, the trial court instructed \r\n  the jury as follows: \r\n  \r\n \r\nNow, you are to consider \r\n  each case separately and write a verdict differently in each case. You may find \r\n  all the defendants not guilty, one of the defendants guilty and the rest not \r\n  guilty, or some guilty and not guilty. You are to consider each one separately \r\n  and determine whether or not the State of South Carolina has proven a defendant \r\n  guilty of this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCastineira does not identify \r\n  any prejudice resulting from the trial court's refusal to sever his case from \r\n  the others. Furthermore, considering the judge's cautionary instruction, and \r\n  the fact that no abuse of discretion is shown, the trial court did not err in \r\n  refusing to grant Castineira a severance. \r\n\r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  SENTENCING \r\n \r\nLastly, Castineira argues \r\n  the trial court erred in sentencing him to thirty years imprisonment under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999), instead of fifteen years under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (1985). We disagree. \r\n   \r\nThe indictment charged Castineira \r\n  with violating section 44-53-370(e)(2)(e). The indictment alleged that the defendants: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . did . . . knowingly, \r\n  willingly, unlawfully, and willfully conspire, for the purpose of selling, delivering, \r\n  purchasing, or bringing into this State, or providing financial assistance or \r\n  otherwise aiding and abetting the sale, delivery, purchase, or bringing into \r\n  this State, or the knowing actual or constructive possession, or the knowing \r\n  attempt to become in actual or constructive possession of four hundred (400) \r\n  grams or more of cocaine. . . . \r\n   \r\nCastineira contends he was \r\n  charged and convicted of general conspiracy to violate the drug act, requiring \r\n  that his sentence be limited to one-half of the sentence required for conviction \r\n  of the substantive offense of trafficking pursuant to section 44-53-420. That \r\n  section reads as follows: \r\n   \r\nAny person who attempts \r\n  or conspires to commit any offense made unlawful by the provisions of this article \r\n  shall, upon conviction, be fined or imprisoned in the same manner as for the \r\n  offense planned or attempted; but such fine or imprisonment shall not exceed \r\n  one half of the punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which \r\n  was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 \r\n  (1985).\r\nThe trial court ruled section \r\n  44-53-420 did not apply, concluding the language in section 44-53-370 incorporates \r\n  conspiracy within the substantive offense. We agree. \r\n   \r\nThe words of a statute must \r\n  be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to a subtle or forced \r\n  construction that limits or expands the statute's operation. State v. Prince, \r\n  335 S.C. 466, 517 S.E.2d 229 (Ct. App. 1999). Criminal statutes must be strictly \r\n  construed against the state and in favor of the defendant. Prince, 335 \r\n  S.C. at 472, 517 S.E.2d at 232. The elementary and cardinal rule of statutory \r\n  construction is that the court must ascertain and effectuate the intent of the \r\n  legislature. Id. \r\n   \r\nSection 44-53-370(e) provides, \r\n  in applicable part, as follows:\r\n \r\nAny person who knowingly \r\n  sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, \r\n  or who provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or \r\n  conspires to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into \r\n  this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who \r\n  knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of: \r\n   \r\n(2) ten grams or more of \r\n  cocaine or any mixtures containing cocaine, as provided in Section 44-53-210(b)(4), \r\n  is guilty of a felony which is known as \"trafficking in cocaine\" and, upon conviction, \r\n  must be punished as follows if the quantity involved is: \r\n   \r\n(e) four hundred grams or \r\n  more, a term of imprisonment of not less than twenty-five years nor more than \r\n  thirty years with a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, \r\n  no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of two hundred \r\n  thousand dollars; . . . \r\n   \r\nNotwithstanding Section \r\n  44-53-420, a person convicted of conspiracy pursuant to this subsection must \r\n  be sentenced as provided in this section with a full sentence or punishment \r\n  and not one-half of the sentence or punishment prescribed for the offense. \r\n  \r\n \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added). \r\n   \r\nA plain reading of the language \r\n  of section 44-53-370 establishes that the legislature intended to include conspiracy \r\n  within the substantive framework of the offense of trafficking. The trafficking \r\n  statute delineates conspiracy to sell, manufacture, deliver, or bring into the \r\n  State more than ten grams of cocaine as a violation. Violations of this statutory \r\n  offense are known as \"trafficking in cocaine.\" State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. \r\n  289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1993). Specifically, the language exempting trafficking \r\n  convictions from the conspiracy penalty provision states that \"a person convicted \r\n  of conspiracy pursuant to this subsection must be sentenced as provided \r\n  in this section.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e) (Supp. 1999) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n \r\nA criminal defendant is \r\n  entitled to be tried only on indicted offenses. State v. Munn, 292 S.C. \r\n  497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987). In South Carolina, \"it is a rule of universal observance \r\n  in administering the criminal law that a defendant must be convicted, if convicted \r\n  at all, of the particular offense charged in the bill of indictment.\" State \r\n  v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 136, 437 S.E.2d 75, 82 (1993) (quoting State v. \r\n  Cody, 180 S.C. 417, 423, 186 S.E. 165, 167 (1936)). Castineira was indicted \r\n  for violating section 44-53-370(e)(2)(e), including the act of conspiring with \r\n  others to commit the offense, and was convicted. His sentence is within the \r\n  statutorily prescribed maximum sentence allowable. \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the conviction and sentence are \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n \r\nCURETON and HUFF, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3217","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999) and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and \r\n  a $200,000 fine. On appeal, Vasquez contends the trial court erred in limiting \r\n  cross-examination of the State's witness; denying his motion for directed verdict; \r\n  denying a severance; and sentencing him to an illegal, excessive sentence. We \r\n  affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe prosecution of Vasquez \r\n  and twenty-five co-defendants was the culmination of a two year State Grand \r\n  Jury (SGJ) investigation. The investigation began in August \r\n  1993, when police arrested Michael Greer on a cocaine charge and executed a \r\n  search warrant at his residence. Over the next two years, police followed the \r\n  chain of Greer's suppliers, continuing to make purchases and turn those arrested \r\n  into cooperating informants.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe investigation eventually \r\n  led to O'Bryant (O.B.) Harris. The officers arrested O.B. on August 31, 1996, \r\n  after they observed a transaction involving an undercover drug payment of $115,000. \r\n  Once arrested, Harris cooperated, identifying Jose Gustavo Castineira as his \r\n  source. Officers arranged an undercover payoff to Castineira for cocaine previously \r\n  supplied on September 1, 1996. Castineira and Vasquez, both Cuban residents \r\n  of Miami, arrived in a Mercedes Benz driven by Castineira. After a brief (recorded) \r\n  conversation in which Castineira discussed a large cocaine deal, Castineira \r\n  placed the money in his vehicle. Castineira and Vasquez were then arrested. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 8, 1996, the \r\n  SGJ indicted twenty-six defendants for conspiracy to traffic in 400 or more \r\n  grams of cocaine pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  Eighteen defendants pled guilty; and the remaining eight were tried together \r\n  during a two-week period in late April - early May 1997, including Vasquez. \r\n  The trial court denied Vasquez's motion for severance.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the close of the State's \r\n  case, Vasquez moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing there was a material \r\n  variance between the conspiracy alleged in the indictment and the multiple conspiracies \r\n  proved by the State at trial. He also moved for a directed verdict on the following \r\n  grounds: (1) there was no evidence showing he was involved in the single conspiracy \r\n  alleged; (2) his mere presence at the garage meeting did not indicate he was \r\n  a co-conspirator; and (3) he could not be convicted based on the transaction \r\n  at the garage because it is impossible to conspire with government agents. The \r\n  trial court denied these motions. Vasquez renewed all his motions at the close \r\n  of the defense and again, the trial court denied each one. The jury convicted \r\n  Vasquez of conspiracy to traffic in 400 or more grams of cocaine and the trial \r\n  court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment and a $200,000 fine. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Whether the trial \r\n  court erred in prohibiting the cross-examination of the State's witness on the \r\n  witness's understanding of his plea agreement? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in denying Vasquez's motion for a directed verdict because \r\n  the State's evidence failed to establish that Vasquez was a member of the conspiracy \r\n  alleged in the indictment? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in denying Vasquez's motion for a severance? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in sentencing Vasquez to a 30 year sentence and fine of $200,000 \r\n  because it exceeded the maximum allowable sentence for conspiracy under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (1985)? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. \r\n  CROSS-EXAMINATION\r\nThis identical issue was \r\n  raise and ruled upon by this Court in State v. Castineira, Op. No. 3216 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 40. For the \r\n  reasons set forth in that opinion, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\nII. \r\n  DIRECTED VERDICT \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVasquez next argues the \r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict because the evidence \r\n  was insufficient to obtain a conviction. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn considering a motion \r\n  for directed verdict, a trial court is concerned only with the existence or \r\n  non-existence of evidence, not its weight. See State v. Kelsey, \r\n  331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 274, 400 \r\n  S.E.2d 131 (1991). Therefore, in reviewing the denial of a directed verdict \r\n  motion, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State and affirm \"if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused. . . .\" State \r\n  v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999) (citing State \r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The indictment alleges \r\n  a single conspiracy among at least twenty-six individuals to traffic in more \r\n  than 400 grams of cocaine in Greenville and Spartanburg Counties, South Carolina, \r\n  Florida, and Georgia (\"The Castineira Conspiracy\"). We hold there was sufficient \r\n  evidence to submit to the jury the conspiracy charges against Vasquez for his \r\n  involvement in the Castineira Conspiracy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA conspiracy is \"a combination \r\n  or agreement between two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing a \r\n  criminal or unlawful object. . . .\" State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 133-34, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 75, 80 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1115 (citing State \r\n  v. Ameker, 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906)); see also S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-17-410 (Supp. 1999); State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 433 S.E.2d 864 \r\n  (1993). The gravamen of conspiracy is the agreement or mutual understanding. \r\n  Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80; Wilson, 315 S.C. at 294, \r\n  433 S.E.2d at 868 (emphasis added). Therefore, we focus here on the sufficiency \r\n  of the agreement between alleged conspirators. As our supreme court has said: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhat is required is a shared, \r\n  single criminal objective, not just similar or parallel objectives between similarly \r\n  situated people . . . . It is not enough that a group of people separately intend \r\n  to distribute drugs in a single area, nor enough that their activities occasionally \r\n  or sporadically place them in contact with each other. People in the same industry \r\n  in the same locale (even competitors) can occasionally be expected to interact \r\n  with each other without thereby becoming coconspirators. What is needed is proof \r\n  they intended to act together for their shared mutual benefit \r\n  within the scope of the conspiracy charged. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGunn, 313 S.C. at \r\n  134, 437 S.E.2d at 80-81 (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur review of the sufficiency \r\n  of the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State. State \r\n  v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981). However, we must exercise \r\n  caution to ensure proof is not obtained \"by piling inference upon inference.\" \r\n  Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 81 (citation omitted).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe record reflects the following \r\nevidence against Vasquez. It is undisputed that Vasquez accompanied Castineira \r\nto the meeting arranged at Harris Brothers' Garage. Despite O.B. Harris's assertion \r\nthat Vasquez did not say anything during the transaction, O.B. Harris testified \r\nthat he first met Vasquez in 1992 or 1993, when Castineira introduced them. Thereafter, \r\nO.B. Harris saw Vasquez regularly when he was \"delivering the merchandise with \r\n[Castineira].\" O.B. further stated Vasquez delivered cocaine for Castineira and \r\npicked up money for him from cocaine transactions. In essence, Vasquez was described \r\nas a \"mule\" who would carry the cocaine or pick up the money for Castineira. For \r\nexample, O.B. Harris stated, \"[Castineira] would not ride with [Vasquez]. [Castineira] \r\nwould follow him in another vehicle . . . [or] would fly to Atlanta and someone \r\nwould pick him up from the airport.\"(1) \r\n O.B. Harris also related \r\n  that Castineira and Vasquez stayed at the \"stash house\" owned by O.B.'s \"close \r\n  lady friend\" whenever they were in town, using it to rest, count money, make \r\n  phone calls, and store drugs. Castineira had both a key and a garage door opener \r\n  for the stash house. Finally, O.B. testified he received three to five kilos \r\n  a week from Castineira and that he saw Vasquez in connection with the delivery \r\n  of the cocaine or the money \"mostly on every occasion.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe evidence presented at \r\n  trial of Vasquez's involvement in the Castineira Conspiracy was substantial, \r\n  and clearly sufficient to justify sending the case to the jury.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVasquez also argues there \r\n  is a material variance between the conspiracy alleged and the conspiracy for \r\n  which he was convicted. In particular he asserts he was not part of the conspiracy \r\n  alleged because no evidence tied him to \"23 of the 25 named defendants.\" Even \r\n  if correct, however, this argument fails. \"Once a conspiracy has been established, \r\n  evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the connection of a defendant \r\n  to the conspiracy, even though the connection is slight, is sufficient to convict \r\n  him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.\" State v. Horne, 324 \r\n  S.C. 372, 382, 478 S.E.2d 289, 294 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing State v. Sullivan, \r\n  277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981)). Further, \"the acts and declarations of \r\n  any conspirator made during the conspiracy and in furtherance thereof are deemed \r\n  to be the acts and declarations of every other conspirator and are admissible \r\n  against all.\" Id. (quoting Sullivan, 277 S.C. at 42, 282 S.E.2d \r\n  at 842). Vasquez was undeniably intertwined in the Castineira Conspiracy and \r\n  the evidence of this was sufficient to send the case to the jury. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  SEVERANCE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThird, Vasquez argues the \r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for severance. Vasquez's argument as \r\n  to severance is identical to that raised and ruled upon by this Court in State \r\n  v. Castineira, Op. No. 3216 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 17, 2000) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 40. For the reasons set forth in that opinion, we find this \r\n  argument to be without merit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  SENTENCING \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVasquez's final issue is \r\n  identical to that raised and ruled upon by this court in State v. Castineira, \r\n  Op. No. 3216 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 \r\n  at 40. For the reasons set forth in that opinion, we find this argument to be \r\n  without merit. \r\n   \r\nFor the reasons set forth \r\n  in this opinion, Vasquez's conviction and sentence are \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HUFF, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n \r\n1.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999). On appeal, Miller asserts his prosecution for conspiracy violates S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 (1985), which bars prosecution for the same act if it has previously led to conviction or acquittal under federal law or the law of another state. Similarly, Miller argues his conviction violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. (1) \r\n\r\nMiller also contends the trial court erred in denying a severance, denying his motion for a directed verdict,\r\n\r\nand sentencing him to an illegal, excessive sentence.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  On October 8, 1996, Miller and twenty-five co-defendants were indicted by the State Grand Jury (SGJ) for\r\n\r\nconspiring to traffic in at least 400 grams of cocaine between 1990 and 1996 following an investigation\r\n\r\nspanning over two years.  The conspiracy was headed by Jose Castineira, who supplied large quantities of\r\n\r\ncocaine to O'Bryant (O.B.) Harris.  O.B., in turn, distributed smaller quantities of the same cocaine to\r\n\r\nother distributors, including Miller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a separate federal investigation, Miller was arrested for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute\r\n\r\ncocaine in May 1991 (the 1991 conspiracy).  On May 28, 1991, Miller and one co-defendant were indicted\r\n\r\nby the Federal Grand Jury for the District of South Carolina for conspiring with persons both \"known and\r\n\r\nunknown\" to distribute approximately two kilograms of cocaine between the dates of  \"at least\" May 7,\r\n\r\n1991 and May 16, 1991. (2)  The federal charge stemmed from a controlled purchase of two kilograms of\r\n\r\ncocaine from Miller during the federal investigation.  The government also seized $187,000 in cash from\r\n\r\nMiller's home in addition to the cocaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller's source for the two kilograms of cocaine seized in the federal arrest was O.B.  The $187,000 seized\r\n\r\nin the search of Miller's house following his arrest was stored for O.B., but belonged to O.B.'s supplier,\r\n\r\nCastineira.  Miller provided O.B. with a copy of his federal arrest warrant so that O.B. could explain the\r\n\r\nseizure of the cocaine and the loss of the $187,000 to Castineira.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller pled guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. Â§ 846, the conspiracy count of the federal indictment, on\r\n\r\nSeptember 6, 1991.  Miller remained out of jail for almost two years pending sentencing.  On May 28, 1993,\r\n\r\nhe was sentenced to 60 months for that offense.  Miller was then incarcerated until the date of his trial in\r\n\r\nthis case.  According to Miller, he cooperated with federal law enforcement officials after his arrest,\r\n\r\nincluding naming O.B. as his supplier and Todd Brank as his distributor.  O.B. and Brank were not\r\n\r\narrested or prosecuted in connection with that investigation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth O.B. and Brank were arrested in the following SGJ investigation, and became cooperating witnesses\r\n\r\nfor the State against Miller in his trial.  O.B. testified that he continued to supply Miller with cocaine after\r\n\r\nhis 1991 conviction until he was incarcerated on the federal charge in 1993.  Brank testified he continued \r\n\r\nto purchase cocaine from Miller until Miller was incarcerated in 1993, purchasing approximately 3\r\n\r\nkilograms between 1991 and 1993.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller moved to dismiss the 1996 SGJ Indictment based upon S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 (1985), which\r\n\r\nbars prosecution for the same act if it has previously led to conviction or acquittal under federal law or the\r\n\r\nlaw of another state.  Concomitantly, Miller moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that it\r\n\r\nviolated the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause.  Miller also moved for severance in the event the\r\n\r\ncourt denied his motion to dismiss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge ruled that Miller's plea of guilty to the federal indictment ended his original involvement in\r\n\r\nthe conspiracy.  Consequently, assuming it was the same conspiracy, his \"re-entry\" was a separate act for\r\n\r\nwhich he could be prosecuted.  The trial judge also denied the motion to sever, but instructed the jury that\r\n\r\nMiller's guilty plea ended his original involvement in the conspiracy, and he could not be found guilty\r\n\r\nbased upon any activity prior to  May 16, 1991. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Whether Miller's prosecution was barred under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 (1985), which\r\n\r\nprohibits prosecution for the same act if it has previously led to conviction or acquittal under\r\n\r\nfederal law or the law of another state; and whether the prosecution was barred by Double\r\n\r\nJeopardy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Whether the trial judge erred in denying Miller's motion for severance and for allowing\r\n\r\nevidence of prior bad acts, including Miller's own statement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  Whether the trial judge erred in denying Miller's motion for directed verdict?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  Whether the trial judge exceeded the maximum allowable sentence by sentencing Miller to\r\n\r\n25 years  in prison?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.  DOUBLE JEOPARDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first two issues raised by Miller are closely intertwined and resolved under the same factual analysis.\r\n\r\nWe therefore treat them together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-410 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a violation of this article is a violation of a Federal law or the law of another state, the conviction or\r\n\r\nacquittal under Federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to prosecution in this\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plain wording of this section prohibits a prosecution under Article 3 of Chapter 53 in South Carolina\r\n\r\nfor the same act which has been the source of a conviction or acquittal in another state or federal court. \r\n\r\nThe prohibition against double jeopardy protects against prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or\r\n\r\nconviction and against multiple punishments for the same offense.  See \r\nUnited States v. Dixon, 509 U.S.\r\n\r\n688 (1993).  The threshold inquiry as to each in this case is whether the same act is involved in the federal\r\n\r\nconviction and the state conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gravamen or gist of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement.  State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 454, 298\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 215 (1982). \"Generally, the agreement, which is the essence of the conspiracy, is proven by various\r\n\r\novert acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" State v. Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 319, 428 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n871, 873 (1993).  \"Therefore, a single conspiracy may be established by completely different aggregations of\r\n\r\nproof so that there appears to be several conspiracies.\" Id. (citing\r\nUnited States v. Ragins, 840 F.2d 1184\r\n\r\n(4th Cir. 1988)).  A multi-pronged \"totality of the circumstances\" test is applied to determine whether there\r\n\r\nwere two conspiracies or merely one. Id. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe factors considered are (1) the time periods covered by the alleged conspiracies;  (2) the places where\r\n\r\nthe conspiracies are alleged to have occurred;  (3) the persons charged as conspirators;  (4) the overt acts\r\n\r\nalleged to have been committed in furtherance of the conspiracies, or any other descriptions of the offenses\r\n\r\ncharged which indicate the nature and scope of the activities being prosecuted;  and (5) the substantive\r\n\r\nstatutes alleged to have been violated.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 319-320, 428 S.E.2d at 873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller contends that prosecution for any continued participation by him in the conspiracy after his plea of\r\n\r\nguilty to the federal conspiracy indictment is prohibited under both section 44-53-410 and the Double\r\n\r\nJeopardy Clause.  We disagree.  Applying the five-factor analysis, we conclude the prosecution of Miller for\r\n\r\nthe 1996 conspiracy does not violate either the Double Jeopardy Clause or section 44-53-410.\r\nMiller entered a plea of guilty to the conspiracy on September 6, 1991. He thereafter cooperated with federal investigators by naming O.B. Harris as his supplier and Todd Brank as his distributor. Although the gravamen of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement, it is the individual participation of the actor by agreeing which subjects him to criminal liability as a co-conspirator. State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 134, 437 S.E.2d 75, 81 (1993)(&quot;[G]uilt . . . remains individual and personal . . . and is not a matter of mass application.&quot;) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1115 (1994).\r\nOur state has not decided this exact issue, but we find authority from other jurisdictions which is\r\n\r\npersuasive.  In United States v. Asher,  96 F.3d 270 (7th Cir. 1996),\r\ncert. denied, 519 U.S. 1100 (1997), the\r\n\r\nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that a convicted conspirator could be prosecuted for continued\r\n\r\nparticipation in the same conspiracy after his original conviction and sentence for conspiracy without\r\n\r\nviolating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Applying the same five-factor analysis adopted by our state in\r\nAmerson, the court noted that Asher's re-entry into the same conspiracy constituted a new act for which he\r\n\r\ncould be prosecuted.  Likewise, in United States v. Dunn, 775 F.2d 604 (5th Cir. 1985), the Fifth Circuit\r\n\r\ngrounded its decision on \"basic conspiracy law,\" noting: \"It is well settled that a person's participation in a\r\n\r\nconspiracy ends when that person is arrested for his role in the conspiracy.\" Id. at 607.  Consequently,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the defendant's uninterrupted association with a continuing criminal conspiracy, as a\r\n\r\nmatter of law his arrest ended his involvement with that criminal operation. Id. (\"[F]urther participation\r\n\r\nin an 'old' conspiracy after being charged with that crime becomes a new offense for purposes of a double\r\n\r\njeopardy claim.\")(quoting United States v. Stricklin, 591 F.2d 1112, 1121 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1979),\r\ncert. denied,\r\n\r\n444 U.S. 963 (1979)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree with the reasoning of Asher and\r\nDunn.  Here Miller was arrested for his participation in the\r\n\r\nconspiracy.  He entered a plea of guilty, and even cooperated with the prosecution by naming his co-conspirators.  The trial judge correctly concluded that as a matter of law his involvement in the conspiracy\r\n\r\nended with his arrest and conviction.  His  continued participation, even if temporally uninterrupted,\r\n\r\nconstituted a new act for which he could be prosecuted without violating either the Double Jeopardy\r\n\r\nClause or section 44-53-410. See \r\nUnited States v. Asher,  96 F.3d 270 (7th Cir. 1996),\r\ncert. denied, 519 U.S.\r\n\r\n1100 (1997); United States v. Dunn, 775 F.2d 604 (5th Cir. 1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  SEVERANCE; PRIOR BAD ACTS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller next argues that the trial judge committed reversible error by refusing to sever Miller's trial.  The\r\n\r\nother co-conspirators had not been prosecuted in 1991 by federal authorities, and evidence was admitted\r\n\r\nas to the conspiracy that involved Miller and which pre-dated his 1991 arrest and conviction.  Miller\r\n\r\nargues that this evidence was highly prejudicial to him in view of the trial judge's ruling that Miller could\r\n\r\nonly be convicted based on his activities after his May 21, 1991 arrest, and a severance was therefore\r\n\r\nrequired in order to provide him with a fair trial.  He argues also that the evidence of a pre-May 21, 1991\r\n\r\nconspiracy was improperly admitted because, under the unusual posture of the case, it was prior bad act\r\n\r\nevidence which was extremely prejudicial. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal defendants who are jointly tried are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right.  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118  (1997). \"Motions for a severance and separate trial are addressed to\r\n\r\nthe discretion of the trial court. . . [and] [a]bsent a showing of an abuse of discretion, this Court will not\r\n\r\ndisturb the trial court's ruling on appeal.\" Id. at 122, 481 S.E.2d at 124 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller's severance argument presupposes the inadmissibility of the pre-May 21, 1991 conspiracy evidence\r\n\r\nbecause he could not be convicted under the trial judge's ruling for his participation in it.  Nowhere does\r\n\r\nthe record reflect that this evidentiary point was raised to, or ruled upon, by the trial judge.  Although\r\n\r\ncounsel for Miller argued that the evidence was highly prejudicial to Miller, there is no motion contained\r\n\r\nwithin the record to exclude the evidence on the basis that it was inadmissable \"prior bad act\" evidence\r\n\r\nunder Rule 404(b), SCRE, or State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Miller did not directly raise admissibility of this evidence as an issue, we must resolve this\r\n\r\nquestion to determine whether Miller has shown prejudice from the joint trial.  As stated previously, Miller\r\n\r\nmaintains that the conspiracy was ongoing, and could only be considered one criminal act for which he had\r\n\r\nalready been prosecuted.  We have resolved this against him in Part I of this opinion, but we have done so\r\n\r\nby recognizing as a legal proposition that Miller's plea of guilty ended his original participation in the\r\n\r\nconspiracy.  Factually, however, this is peculiar to Miller, and has no particular significance in\r\n\r\ndetermining the beginning or the end of the conspiracy itself.  Consequently, from a purely factual\r\n\r\nperspective, the activities of Miller and his co-conspirators prior to May 21, 1991 are evidence of the\r\n\r\nconspiracy the State charged and intended to prove.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller's act of conspiring prior to May 21, 1991 is also evidence of his role in the ongoing conspiracy which\r\n\r\nthe State maintains he re-entered.  The State must prove the existence of the conspiracy, as well as the\r\n\r\nactor's participation.  Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;[W]hen a conspiracy is shown all declarations in furtherance thereof, by any of the conspirators, to\r\n\r\nadvance the common cause, are evidence against all, though not made in the presence of each other.\" State v. Ferguson, 221 S.C. 300, 304, 70 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1952),\r\ncert. denied, 344 U.S. 830 (1952).  The acts\r\n\r\nand declarations of any conspirator made during the pendency of the conspiracy, and in furtherance\r\n\r\nthereof, are deemed acts and declarations of every other conspirator. Id.  Once the conspiracy ends,\r\n\r\nhowever, the acts and declarations of a co-conspirator are inadmissible against the other conspirators.\r\nState v. Mikell, 257 S.C. 315, 185 S.E.2d 814 (1971).\r\nIn United States v. Kennedy, 32 F.3d 876 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1128 (1995), the defendant asserted on appeal that evidence of prior drug activity between the defendant and his suppliers arising out of a separate investigation were part of a different conspiracy involving different people and a different time period, and not a part of the charged conspiracy. Consequently, the defendant contended the prior drug activity constituted \"other crimes, wrongs or acts\" as defined under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), which was inadmissible. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that it is not \"other crimes\" evidence if it \"arose out of the same . . . series of transactions as the charged offense, . . . or if it is necessary to complete the story of the crime [on] trial.\" Id. at 885 (quoting United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880, 886 (2d Cir. 1989)). The court concluded the evidence constituted predicate evidence necessary to provide the context to the drug distribution scheme that took place within the charged time frame. \"By providing the jury with background information on [the defendant's] activities during the preparatory stages of the conspiracy, this evidence 'served to complete the story of the crime on trial.'\" Id. at 886 (quoting United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 87 (4th Cir.1980)). The evidence also showed the defendant's own distribution \"subset\" within the larger conspiracy, helping the jury to understand how the subset related to and became a part of the larger, charged conspiracy. For these reasons, the court held that the evidence did not constitute \"other crimes\" evidence under Rule 404(b), and the district court properly admitted it as proof of the existence and structure of the charged drug distribution conspiracy. \r\nMoreover, actions of conspirators prior to a co-conspirator's involvement are admissible. United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,  333 U.S. 364 (1948); United States v. Sepulveda, 710 F.2d 188, 189 (5th Cir.\r\n\r\n1983).  Further, evidence of prior acts on the part of conspirators that predate the conspiracy is admissible\r\n\r\nto show the background and development of the conspiracy, the relationship between the conspirators, and\r\n\r\nthe significance of the later acts. See \r\nUnited States v. Diaz, 878 F.2d 608 (2d Cir. 1989);\r\nUnited States v. Moten, 564 F.2d 620 (2d. Cir 1977); United States v. Torres, 519 F.2d 723 (2d. Cir. 1975);\r\nUnited States v. Crockett, 514 F.2d 64 (5th Cir. 1975)). See also \r\nCommonwealth v. McLaughlin, 726 N.E.2d 959, 965\r\n\r\n(Mass. 2000) (\"Matters surrounding the history of the conspiracy, including statements of coconspirators,\r\n\r\nmay be admissible even if they predate the conspiracy.\") (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude evidence of the conspiracy pre-dating Miller's re-entry into it was admissible as background,\r\n\r\nas evidence of the existence of the conspiracy itself, and to explain Miller's relation to it to the jury.  It was\r\n\r\nnot \"other crimes\" evidence violating Rule 404(b), SCRE.  Consequently, the failure to sever Miller's trial\r\n\r\ndid not result in prejudice from the admission of evidence against other co-conspirators which was\r\n\r\ninadmissible against Miller. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge charged the jury that they could only find Miller guilty if they concluded that he\r\n\r\nparticipated in the conspiracy after May 21, 1991.  Furthermore, the jury did not find several co-defendants guilty of trafficking in 400 or more grams of cocaine, indicating that the jury was not confused\r\n\r\nby the multi-defendant trial or extensive testimony.  Rather, the verdicts indicate the jury carefully\r\n\r\nanalyzed the evidence and followed the trial judge's charge.  Therefore, we see no prejudice to Miller in the\r\n\r\nrefusal to grant a severance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  DIRECTED VERDICT   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller next argues the court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict.  On a motion for a directed verdict\r\n\r\nin a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its\r\n\r\nweight.  State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 319 S.E.2d 335 (1984).   If the State presents any evidence which\r\n\r\nreasonably tends to prove the defendant's guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt could be fairly and\r\n\r\nlogically deduced, the case must go to the jury.  State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 431 S.E.2d 254 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Miller's supplier, O. B. Harris, and Miller's purchaser, Todd Brank, testified that they continued to\r\n\r\ndeal in kilogram quantities of cocaine with Miller after he pled guilty in September 1991 until he was\r\n\r\nsentenced in federal court on May 28, 1993.  We conclude this testimony provided ample evidence of\r\n\r\nMiller's re-entry into the conspiracy and his active participation following the September 8, 1991\r\n\r\nconviction.  Consequently, the trial judge did not err in refusing to grant a directed verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  SENTENCING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller's final issue is identical to that raised and ruled upon by this Court in State v. Castineira, Op. No.\r\n\r\n3216 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 40.  For the reasons set forth in that\r\n\r\nopinion, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Miller's conviction and sentence are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999). Gosnell was convicted of \r\n  conspiracy to traffic in cocaine in the amount of at least 200 grams, but less \r\n  than 400 grams, which was charged by the trial court as a lesser included offense \r\n  over his objection. Gosnell was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment \r\n  and a $100,000 fine. On appeal, Gosnell argues the trial court erred in charging \r\n  conspiracy to traffic in cocaine in the amount of at least 200 grams, but less \r\n  than 400 grams, as a lesser included offense. Gosnell also contends on appeal \r\n  that he was entitled to a directed verdict, that he was sentenced in the absence \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction, and that he was sentenced to an illegal, excessive \r\n  sentence. We reverse. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe prosecution of Gosnell \r\n  and twenty-five co-defendants was the culmination of a two year State Grand \r\n  Jury (SGJ) investigation. The investigation began in August \r\n  1993, when police arrested Michael Greer on a cocaine charge and executed a \r\n  search warrant at his residence. Over the next two years, police followed the \r\n  chain of Greer's suppliers, continuing to make purchases and turning those arrested \r\n  into cooperating informants. \r\n\r\nAs a result of information \r\n  provided by Greer, SGJ officers arranged four controlled cocaine buys from James \r\n  Smith. Smith agreed to assist the officers and they set up three controlled \r\n  cocaine buys from James Hattaway. Hattaway in turn led the officers to Todd \r\n  Brank, from whom they effected at least two controlled buys. Brank also cooperated, \r\n  and the officers set up a five kilogram undercover deal with Jerome \"Babe\" Harris. \r\n  Harris agreed to cooperate but had not yet paid for the drugs, so the officers \r\n  made an undercover payment of $115,000 to O'Bryant \"O.B.\" Harris for him.(1) \r\n  \r\nOfficers arrested O.B. Harris \r\n  on August 31, 1996, and he identified Jose Gustavo Castineira as his cocaine \r\n  source. Officers set up a fake undercover payoff of Castineira, to take place \r\n  September 1 at Harris Brothers' Garage, which was wired for sound and video. \r\n  On the appointed day, Castineira and Juan Carlos Vasquez, both Cuban residents \r\n  of Miami, arrived at the garage in a Mercedes Benz driven by Castineira. Both \r\n  O.B. and Babe Harris were present. After a brief (recorded) conversation, in \r\n  which O.B. Harris, Babe Harris, and Castineira discussed a twenty kilogram exchange, \r\n  Castineira picked up the \"cash\" and placed it in the vehicle. The \r\n  officers arrested Castineira and Vasquez. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1996, the \r\n  SGJ indicted twenty-six defendants for conspiracy to traffic in 400 or more \r\n  grams of cocaine, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e). Eighteen \r\n  defendants pleaded guilty; the remaining eight were tried together during a \r\n  two-week period in late April - early May 1997, including Gosnell. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the State's view of \r\n  the evidence, Castineira was at the top of the distribution chain. To the extent \r\n  that the State established that the Castineira conspiracy existed, multiple \r\n  kilograms of a mixture containing cocaine were distributed under any view of \r\n  the evidence. Gosnell, on the other hand, was at the lower level of the distribution \r\n  chain. Under the State's evidence, Castineira distributed to O.B. Harris, who \r\n  then distributed to Johnny Harold Harris, a/k/a Johnny Harold Miller (Miller) \r\n  until he went to federal prison for distributing two kilograms of cocaine provided \r\n  by Castineira. Once Miller went to prison, the conspiracy continued to operate, \r\n  with O.B. Harris then distributing to Jerome \"Babe\" Harris thereafter. Babe \r\n  Harris, in turn, distributed to Todd Brank, who distributed in smaller quantities \r\n  to multiple people, including James Hattaway. Hattaway distributed smaller amounts \r\n  to Gosnell. Consequently, under the State's evidence, the amount of cocaine \r\n  actually handled by Gosnell was much less than the multiple kilogram distribution \r\n  of the conspiracy itself. Because the evidence indicated Gosnell only handled \r\n  a maximum of 252 grams, the court charged conspiracy to traffic in cocaine in \r\n  the amount of at least 200 grams, but less than 400 grams, as a lesser included \r\n  offense which the jury could consider in the case against Gosnell.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the close of the State's \r\n  case, Gosnell moved for a directed verdict, asserting the State's evidence, \r\n  taken in a light most favorably to the State, did not show that Gosnell participated \r\n  in a conspiracy to traffic in 400 grams or more of cocaine as alleged in the \r\n  indictment. The trial court denied the motion. Gosnell did not present a defense. \r\n  Gosnell renewed his motions, again arguing that the State did not present evidence \r\n  of one conspiracy to traffic 400 grams or more, as alleged in the indictment. \r\n  The court denied this motion, but in the case against Gosnell, decided to charge \r\n  conspiracy to traffic in cocaine in the lesser amount. The jury convicted Gosnell \r\n  of the offense of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine in the lesser amount of least \r\n  200 grams, but less than 400 grams.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGosnell also asserted throughout \r\n  the trial that the State had indicted him for conspiracy to violate the Controlled \r\n  Substances Act pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (1985), rather than indicting \r\n  him for trafficking in cocaine by conspiring with others as delineated under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e) (Supp. 1999). Therefore, he argued that he should \r\n  be subjected to a maximum sentence of one-half the sentence permitted for trafficking \r\n  in cocaine, in accordance with section 44-53-420. The trial court disagreed, \r\n  sentencing him under section 44-53-370(e) to twenty-five years imprisonment \r\n  and a $100,000 fine. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe indictment charged Gosnell \r\n  with violating section 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) by conspiring to traffic in 400 or \r\n  more grams of cocaine. The indictment alleged that the defendants, including \r\n  Gosnell:  \r\n   \r\n. . . did . . . knowingly, \r\n  willingly, unlawfully, and willfully conspire, for the purpose of selling, delivering, \r\n  purchasing, or bringing into this State, or providing financial assistance or \r\n  otherwise aiding and abetting the sale, delivery, purchase, or bringing into \r\n  this State, or the knowing actual or constructive possession, or the knowing \r\n  attempt to become in actual or constructive possession of four hundred (400) \r\n  grams or more of cocaine. . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is essentially a two-part \r\n  test for determining whether to charge a lesser included offense. First, the \r\n  court must determine if the proposed charge is legally a lesser included offense. \r\n  In this regard, an indictment will sustain a conviction for a lesser offense \r\n  if the lesser offense is included within the greater charged offense. State \r\n  v. Fennell, 263 S.C. 216, 209 S.E.2d 433 (1974). The test for determining \r\n  when a crime is a lesser included offense of the crime charged is whether the \r\n  greater offense includes all the elements of the lesser offense. State v. \r\n  Suttles, 279 S.C. 87, 302 S.E.2d 338 (1983). If the lesser offense includes \r\n  an element not included in the greater offense, then the lesser offense is not \r\n  included in the greater. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 44-53-370(e) defines \r\n  the offense of trafficking in cocaine as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAny person who knowingly \r\n  sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, \r\n  or who provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or \r\n  conspires to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into \r\n  this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who \r\n  knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(2) ten grams or more of \r\n  cocaine or any mixtures containing cocaine, as provided in Section 44-53-210(b)(4), \r\n  is guilty of a felony which is known as \"trafficking in cocaine\" . . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2) \r\n  (Supp.1999); State v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThere is no South Carolina \r\n  case which directly answers the question of whether the graduated sentencing \r\n  categories based upon quantity of cocaine are lesser included offenses. Although \r\n  the statute provides a graduated structure of increasing penalties for trafficking \r\n  in larger amounts of cocaine or any mixture containing cocaine, the statute \r\n  is triggered by committing one of the prescribed acts with regard to ten grams \r\n  or more. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. at 117, 456 S.E.2d at 394. Thus, our supreme \r\n  court has ruled that an indictment charging trafficking in cocaine, without \r\n  specifying the amount, or specifying only that the amount was in excess of ten \r\n  grams, is sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction for trafficking in \r\n  any amount. Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 507 S.E.2d 322 (1998); see \r\n  also State v. Towery, 300 S.C. 86, 386 S.E.2d 462 (1989).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Granger v. State, \r\n  333 S.C. 2, 507 S.E.2d 322 (1998) the supreme court ruled that an indictment \r\n  which alleged that the defendant trafficked in cocaine in an amount in excess \r\n  of ten grams did not limit jurisdiction to the lowest sentencing category of \r\n  ten grams or more of cocaine, but less than 28 grams. Therefore, the court concluded \r\n  the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to convict the defendant of \r\n  trafficking in cocaine in the next higher sentencing level of 28 grams or more, \r\n  but less than one hundred grams, where the facts at trial substantiated the \r\n  higher amount. In support of this ruling, the court cited with approval the \r\n  Alabama case of Darby v. State, 516 So.2d 775 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986), \r\n  rev'd on other grounds, 516 So.2d 786 (1987) for the proposition that \r\n  an \"indictment alleging defendant trafficked '28 grams or more' of cocaine, \r\n  without specifying the exact amount of cocaine [was] sufficient; [the] provisions \r\n  of trafficking relating to minimum sentencing requirements did not involve 'elements \r\n  of the offense' of trafficking.\" Granger, 333 S.C. at 4-5, 507 S.E.2d \r\n  at 324. \r\n   \r\nConversely, our supreme \r\n  court has also ruled that an indictment which does charge a specific sentencing \r\n  parameter by designating an amount within a particular sentencing level can \r\n  not be amended before trial pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-19-100 (1985) to \r\n  charge an amount within an increased sentencing level because to do so changes \r\n  the nature of the offense by increasing the penalty involved. Clair v. State, \r\n  324 S.C. 144, 478 S.E.2d 54 (1996). In reaching this decision, the court interpreted \r\n  its holding in Hopkins v. State, 317 S.C. 7, 451 S.E.2d 389 (1994) to \r\n  declare that an amendment to an indictment is improper if it increases the penalty. \r\n  If, however, the provisions relating to minimum sentencing requirements do not \r\n  involve elements of the offense, then this reasoning is difficult to reconcile \r\n  with State v. Evans, 322 S.C. 78, 470 S.E.2d 97 (1996) wherein our supreme \r\n  court stated that: \"A material variance between the charge and the proof entitles \r\n  the defendant to a directed verdict. A variance is not material if it is not \r\n  an element of the offense.\" Evans, 322 S.C. at 81, 470 S.E.2d at 99; \r\n  see also State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 (1993), cert. \r\n  denied, 510 U.S. 1115 (1994). (2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn State v. Raffaldt, \r\n  318 S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995) the court noted without comment that the \r\n  trial court had charged the lower sentencing category amounts as included within \r\n  the charged offense, but the court did not rule on the propriety of that portion \r\n  of the lower court's charge. In Matthews v. State, 300 S.C. 238, 259, \r\n  387 S.E.2d 258, 260 (1990) the supreme court concluded that \"the legislature \r\n  intended possession with intent to distribute to be a lesser-included offense \r\n  of trafficking based upon possession.\" Under this same reasoning, we conclude \r\n  that \"Conspiracy to traffic in cocaine in the amount of 400 grams or more\" can \r\n  include conspiracy to traffic in lesser amounts. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe second issue to be resolved \r\n  in determining whether to charge a lesser included offense, is whether or not \r\n  the lesser included offense is factually sustainable under any view of the evidence. \r\n  A trial judge must charge a lesser included offense if there is evidence from \r\n  which it can be inferred that the defendant committed the lesser rather than \r\n  the greater offense. State v. Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 340 S.E.2d 784 (1986). \r\n  On the other hand, \"[t]he trial court may and should refuse to charge on a lesser-included \r\n  offense where there is no evidence that the defendant committed the lesser rather \r\n  than the greater offense.\" State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 549, 446 S.E.2d \r\n  411, 412-13 (1994) (citing Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 \r\n  (1991)).(3) \r\nTo determine whether the \r\n  facts support a charge on the lesser amounts, we first analyze the charged offense. \r\n  A conspiracy is \"a combination or agreement between two or more persons for \r\n  the purpose of accomplishing a criminal or unlawful object . . . .\" State \r\n  v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 133-34, 437 S.E.2d 75, 80 (1993), cert. denied, \r\n  510 U.S. 1115 (citing State v. Ameker, 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906)); \r\n  see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (Supp. 1999); State v. Wilson, \r\n  315 S.C. 289, 433 S.E.2d 864 (1993). The gravamen of conspiracy is the agreement \r\n  or mutual understanding. Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80; Wilson, \r\n  315 S.C. at 294, 433 S.E.2d at 868.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"The overt acts committed \r\n  in furtherance of the conspiracy are not elements of the crime. Under South \r\n  Carolina law, a conspiracy does not require overt acts.\" State v. Wilson, \r\n  315 S.C. 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 867-868 (1993). \"The substantive crimes committed \r\n  in furtherance of the conspiracy constitute circumstantial evidence of the existence \r\n  of the conspiracy, its object, and scope.\" Id. (citing State v. Amerson, \r\n  428 S.E.2d 871 (1993)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the conspiracy \r\n  charged in the indictment was an agreement to traffic in 400 \r\n  or more grams of cocaine. The evidence at trial clearly established that the \r\n  amount of cocaine or a mixture containing cocaine involved in the alleged conspiracy \r\n  far exceeded 400 grams. It is firmly rooted in our law that \"[o]nce a conspiracy \r\n  has been established, evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the connection \r\n  of a defendant to the conspiracy, even though the connection is slight, is sufficient \r\n  to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.\" State v. Horne, \r\n  324 S.C. 372, 382, 478 S.E.2d 289, 294 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing State v. Sullivan, \r\n  277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981)). Further, \"the acts and declarations of \r\n  any conspirator made during the conspiracy and in furtherance thereof are deemed \r\n  to be the acts and declarations of every other conspirator and are admissible \r\n  against all.\" Id. (quoting Sullivan, 277 S.C. at 42, 282 S.E.2d \r\n  at 842). Therefore, if the defendant's actions, however slight, are sufficient \r\n  to establish his participation in the conspiracy, then he is guilty of the charged \r\n  conspiracy. Conversely, a variance between a single drug trafficking conspiracy \r\n  charged in an indictment and several conspiracies proved at trial is a \"material \r\n  variance\" and can not support the convictions of defendants not involved in \r\n  the charged conspiracy, but only those who are so involved. State v. Gunn, \r\n  313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 (1993).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn view of these legal principles, \r\n  we conclude that by charging the lesser amount as a lesser included offense, \r\n  the court committed reversible error because it allowed the jury to convict \r\n  Gosnell of a different, uncharged conspiracy. Id. Conspiracy to traffic \r\n  in an amount of cocaine contained within a lesser sentencing level than that \r\n  alleged in the indictment may be proper where the amount involved in the object \r\n  of the conspiracy is in controversy. In such circumstances, the lesser charge \r\n  would be an appropriate consideration in defining the scope or object of the \r\n  conspiracy, and it would apply to each alleged conspirator. Factually, that \r\n  was not the case here. Though the individual amount which Gosnell allegedly \r\n  handled was 252 grams, the evidence clearly established that the amount trafficked \r\n  by the conspiracy far exceeded 400 grams. Consequently, Gosnell was convicted \r\n  for an offense not contained within the indictment, and his conviction can not \r\n  stand. \r\n   \r\n Having reached this conclusion, \r\n  it is unnecessary to address Gosnell's remaining issues on appeal. Accordingly, \r\n  Gosnell's conviction and sentence are \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HUFF, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n \r\n1.  Babe \r\n  Harris and O.B. Harris are not related.\r\n2.  \r\nPerhaps, then, these cases \r\nare more easily reconciled by application of the rule that a conviction will not \r\nbe overturned due to evidence that tends to show a narrower charge than that contained \r\nin the indictment if the narrower charge is fully included within the indictment. \r\nEvans, 322 S.C. at 82, 470 S.E.2d at 99. If \"trafficking in cocaine\" includes \r\nall amounts \"ten grams or more,\" then this is inclusive of all sentencing levels \r\ncontained within the statute. See Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, \r\n507 S.E.2d 322 (1998).  \r\n3.  The \r\n  question has historically been presented in the case law of this state in the \r\n  context of a failure to charge the lesser included offense. There is no South \r\n  Carolina case which we have found directly addressing the question of whether \r\n  or not a trial court commits reversible error by improperly charging a lesser \r\n  included offense which is not factually presented. We do not rule on that issue, \r\n  and we do not mean to suggest that such a charge, over a defendant's objection, \r\n  would be reversible error without a showing of prejudice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3220","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999) and sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment \r\n  and a $200,000 fine. On appeal, Hammitt argues the trial court erred in denying \r\n  his motion for directed verdict, denying his motion for a new trial, denying \r\n  a severance, and sentencing him to an illegal, excessive sentence. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe prosecution of Hammitt \r\n  and twenty-five co-defendants was the culmination of a two year State Grand \r\n  Jury (SGJ) investigation. The investigation began in August \r\n  1993, when police arrested Michael Greer on a cocaine charge and executed a \r\n  search warrant at his residence. Over the next two years, police followed the \r\n  chain of Greer's suppliers, continuing to make purchases and turn those arrested \r\n  into cooperating informants.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nThe sequence of events was \r\nas follows. Once Greer was arrested, he provided information that James Smith \r\nwas his supplier to police. As a result of this information, undercover officers \r\narranged four controlled cocaine buys from Smith. Once he was then arrested, Smith \r\nagreed to assist the officers. They then set up three controlled cocaine buys \r\nfrom James Hattaway. Hattaway, in turn, led the officers to Todd Brank, from whom \r\nthey effected at least two controlled buys. Brank also cooperated, and the officers \r\nset up a five kilogram cocaine purchase with Jerome \"Babe\" Harris. When Harris \r\nwas subsequently arrested, he agreed to cooperate. Harris had not yet paid for \r\nthe drugs he attempted to sell to undercover agents, so the officers made an undercover \r\npayment of $115,000 to his supplier, O'Bryant \"O.B.\" Harris (O.B.) for him.(1) \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe officers arrested O.B. \r\n  on August 31, 1996. Under the State's view of the conspiracy, O.B. was the second \r\n  level supplier. His cooperation led to Jose Gustavo Castineira, his cocaine \r\n  source. As a result, the officers set up a fake undercover payoff to Castineira, \r\n  which led to his arrest and that of Juan Carlos Vasquez, his traveling companion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 8, 1996, the \r\n  SGJ indicted twenty-six defendants for conspiracy to traffic in 400 or more \r\n  grams of cocaine pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  Eighteen defendants pleaded guilty; the remaining eight were tried together \r\n  during a two-week period in late April - early May 1997, including Hammitt. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nHammitt became a suspect \r\n  through information provided by Todd Brank and Leslie Horne. In addition to \r\n  distributing cocaine, Brank raced motorcycles. Hammitt owned \r\n  a motorcycle repair shop, and specialized in modifying motorcycles for racing. \r\n  Brank became one of Hammitt's customers. According to Brank, he sold Hammitt \r\n  10 ounces of cocaine on one occasion, and one to two ounces of cocaine on four \r\n  other occasions. The total amount he distributed to Hammitt was approximately \r\n  one-half kilogram. Brank testified he began selling drugs to \r\n  Hammitt after they developed a relationship through motorcycle racing. The cocaine \r\n  dealings with Hammitt occurred from 1993 until 1994.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccording to Brank, he purchased \r\n  his cocaine from Miller until Miller went to prison, and then from Miller's \r\n  half-brother, Babe Harris. Harris testified he and his brother purchased cocaine \r\n  from the same supplier, O.B. Harris. During these purchases, Brank always paid \r\n  cash, and was never fronted any cocaine. Harris testified his relationship with \r\n  Brank was one of seller and buyer, Harris did not work for Brank and Brank did \r\n  not work for Harris.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnother State's witness, \r\n  Kenny Brooks, confirmed that Hammitt bought \"anywhere from one to three ounces \r\n  at a time.\" Brooks also stated he was with Brank several times when Hammitt \r\n  \"beeped\" Brank, requesting cocaine. He further testified he once saw Brank \"toss \r\n  [Hammitt] a package\" of cocaine that contained about two ounces. Brooks never \r\n  saw Brank give Hammitt more than three ounces.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHorne is Hammitt's cousin. \r\n  He was also arrested as a member of the conspiracy, and agreed to cooperate. \r\n  At trial, Horne testified Hammitt fronted him an ounce of cocaine on two separate \r\n  occasions. He also stated he sold Hammitt two ounces he had received from Brank \r\n  and that Hammitt \"worked for\" Brank.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the close of the State's \r\n  case, Hammitt moved for a directed verdict, arguing under State v. Gunn, \r\n  313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 (1993), that proof of a buyer-seller relationship \r\n  was not sufficient to establish a conspiracy. Hammitt also joined in Vasquez's \r\n  motion concerning the State's proof of multiple conspiracies when only one was \r\n  alleged. In his defense, Hammitt called several witnesses but did not testify \r\n  himself. At the close of all the evidence, Hammitt renewed all motions, which \r\n  the trial court again denied.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The jury convicted Hammitt \r\n  of conspiracy to traffic in more than 400 grams of cocaine. The trial court \r\n  sentenced him to twenty-five years imprisonment and a $200,000 fine. This appeal \r\n  followed. \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Whether the trial \r\n  court erred in denying Hammitt's motion for directed verdict because the State's \r\n  evidence failed to establish that Hammitt was a member of the conspiracy alleged \r\n  in the indictment? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in denying Hammitt a new trial on the ground that the jury \r\n  found the existence of more than one conspiracy? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in denying Hammitt's motion for a severance? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. Whether the \r\n  trial court erred in sentencing Hammitt to a 25 year sentence and fine of $200,000 \r\n  because it exceeded the maximum allowable sentence for conspiracy under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (1985)?  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  DIRECTED VERDICT  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn considering a motion \r\n  for directed verdict, a trial court is concerned only with the existence or \r\n  non-existence of evidence, not its weight. See State v. Kelsey, \r\n  331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 274, 400 \r\n  S.E.2d 131 (1991). Therefore, in reviewing the denial of a directed verdict \r\n  motion, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State and affirm \"if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused. . . .\" State \r\n  v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999) (citation omitted).\r\n The indictment alleges \r\n  a single conspiracy among at least twenty-six individuals to traffic in more \r\n  than 400 grams of cocaine in Greenville and Spartanburg Counties, South Carolina, \r\n  Florida, and Georgia. The object of the conspiracy alleged by the State was \r\n  trafficking in cocaine in the amount of 400 grams or more of cocaine. We conclude \r\n  the evidence taken in a light most favorable to the State establishes that Hammitt \r\n  participated in the conspiracy charged in the indictment. \r\nA conspiracy is \"a combination \r\n  or agreement between two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing a \r\n  criminal or unlawful object . . . .\" State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 133-34, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 75, 80 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1115 (citing State \r\n  v. Ameker, 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906)); see also S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-17-410 (Supp. 1999); State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 433 S.E.2d 864 \r\n  (1993). The gravamen of conspiracy is the agreement or mutual understanding. \r\n  Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80; Wilson, 315 S.C. at 294, \r\n  433 S.E.2d at 868 (emphasis added). Although the gravamen of the offense of \r\n  conspiracy is the agreement, it is the individual participation of the actor \r\n  by agreeing which subjects him to criminal liability as a co-conspirator. Gunn, \r\n  313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 81 (\"[G]uilt . . . remains individual and personal \r\n  . . . and is not a matter of mass application.\") (citation omitted). In analyzing \r\n  the degree of connection necessary for conviction, our supreme court stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhat is required is a shared, \r\n  single criminal objective, not just similar or parallel objectives between similarly \r\n  situated people. . . . It is not enough that a group of people separately intend \r\n  to distribute drugs in a single area, nor enough that their activities occasionally \r\n  or sporadically place them in contact with each other. People in the same industry \r\n  in the same locale (even competitors) can occasionally be expected to interact \r\n  with each other without thereby becoming co-conspirators. What is needed is \r\n  proof they intended to act together for their shared mutual \r\n  benefit within the scope of the conspiracy charged. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGunn, 313 S.C. at \r\n  134, 437 S.E.2d at 80-81 (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur review of the sufficiency \r\n  of the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State. State \r\n  v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981). However, we must exercise \r\n  caution to ensure proof is not obtained \"by piling inference upon inference.\" \r\n  Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 81 (citation omitted). Proof of \r\n  a buyer-seller relationship alone is inadequate to connect the buyer to a larger \r\n  conspiracy, as is nominal association with members of the conspiracy. This is \r\n  so because \"guilt . . . remains individual and personal . . . and is not a matter \r\n  of mass application.\" Id. (citation omitted).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe conclude the evidence, \r\n  taken in a light most favorable to the State, connected Hammitt to the charged \r\n  conspiracy. The indictment alleged the conspiracy occurred from 1990 until 1996. \r\n  Brank's testimony indicates Hammitt was involved from 1993 until 1994, when \r\n  their relationship ended. Hammitt's participation falls within the dates alleged \r\n  in the indictment. The State presented evidence of multiple transactions between \r\n  Brank and Hammitt and between Hammitt and Horne. Both Brank and Horne were admitted \r\n  members of the conspiracy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrank testified that he \r\n  \"fronted\" Hammitt the cocaine, meaning that Hammitt paid Brank for the cocaine \r\n  after he re-distributed it, thereby creating the fund with which to pay for \r\n  it. According to Horne, Hammitt also \"fronted\" cocaine to him. This evidence \r\n  tends to establish a conspiracy because it \"suggests that the seller has an \r\n  interest in the success of the buyer's re-selling activities, and because it \r\n  indicates cooperation and trust rather than an arm's length retail-type sale.\" \r\n  United States v. Ferguson, 35 F.3d 327, 331 (7th Cir. 1994), \r\n  cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1100 (1995); see also United \r\n  States v. Dortch, 5 F.3d 1056 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, \r\n  510 U.S. 1121 (1994); United States v. Cabello, 16 F.3d 179 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1994); United States v. Thomas, 12 F.3d 1350 (5th Cir. \r\n  1994), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1095 (1994); State v. Alcorn, 741 \r\n  S.W.2d 135 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987); State v. Cavallari, 571 N.W.2d 176 \r\n  (Wis. Ct. App. 1997), review denied, 576 N.W.2d 281 (1997). The cocaine \r\n  fronted in these transactions was derived from sales leading up the distribution \r\n  chain within the conspiracy. The amounts \"fronted\" to Hammitt were further broken \r\n  down into smaller quantities by him, and then re-distributed by him. Under the \r\n  evidence, different levels of distributor, including Hammitt, reaped a profit \r\n  by re-distributing the cocaine in smaller quantities. In this regard, Horne \r\n  testified that Hammitt showed him how to cut the mixture of cocaine, in order \r\n  to make a larger quantity of cocaine mixture and derive a bigger profit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlso, according to Brank, \r\n  on one occasion Hammitt purchased ten ounces of cocaine (280 grams) from him, \r\n  indicating Hammitt had knowledge of the scope of the conspiracy. See \r\n  State v. Barroso, 320 S.C. 1, 462 S.E.2d 862 (Ct. App. 1995), reversed \r\n  on other grounds, 328 S.C. 268, 493 S.E.2d 854 (1997) (fact that defendant \r\n  purchased in excess of 400 grams in a short period of time evinced his knowledge \r\n  of the scope of the conspiracy). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe indictment alleged a \r\n  single conspiracy to traffic in more than 400 grams of cocaine. To sustain convictions \r\n  under the indictment, the State had to prove the defendants \"intended to act \r\n  together for their shared mutual benefit within \r\n  the scope of the conspiracy charged.\" Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  at 80-81 (citation omitted). \"The government need not show direct contact or \r\n  explicit agreement between the defendants. It is sufficient to show that each \r\n  defendant knew or had reason to know of the scope of the conspiracy and that \r\n  each defendant had reason to believe his own benefits were dependent upon the \r\n  success of the entire venture.\" State v. Barroso, 320 S.C. at 8-9, 462 \r\n  S.E.2d at 868 (citing United States v. Kenny, 645 F.2d 1323 (9th Cir.1981), \r\n  cert. denied, 452 U.S. 920 (1981)). We conclude the above evidence, taken \r\n  in a light most favorable to the State, established Hammitt's participation \r\n  in the conspiracy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  NEW TRIAL \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHammitt next argues the \r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because (1) the jury \r\n  found the existence of more than one conspiracy when it found Fields and Gosnell \r\n  guilty of trafficking in lesser amounts of cocaine; (2) by charging lesser amounts \r\n  as to Fields and Gosnell the judge indirectly commented on the evidence against \r\n  Hammitt; and (3) the judge's charge on lesser amounts as to Fields and Gosnell \r\n  created an erroneous verdict option. Hammitt cites no law in support of these \r\n  arguments. \r\n   \r\nAs we have concluded in \r\n  our analysis of Hammitt's motion for directed verdict, the State presented sufficient \r\n  evidence of Hammitt's involvement in the indicted conspiracy to send the case \r\n  to the jury. We have ruled in the case of State v. Gosnell, Op. No. ______ \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed _______ __, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 28 at __), that \r\n  the trial court erred in charging the jury to consider conspiracy to traffic \r\n  in cocaine in lesser amounts as lesser included offenses against Gosnell. The \r\n  transcript reveals that the trial judge also charged lesser amounts in the case \r\n  against Fields, although that issue has not come before us. However, the judge \r\n  correctly charged the law in relation to Hammitt, because the trial judge gave \r\n  Hammitt the option of choosing the lesser charges, which he refused. Furthermore, \r\n  the jury was instructed to treat each defendant separately. Under \r\n  these circumstances, we see no prejudice to Hammitt by the charges pertaining \r\n  to Gosnell and Fields.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo warrant reversal, it \r\n  is not sufficient to show error. A defendant must also show prejudice flowing \r\n  from the error. State v. Hoffman, 257 S.C. 461, 186 S.E.2d 421 (1972). \r\n  As prejudice, Hammitt argues that charging lesser degrees of trafficking in \r\n  relation to co-defendants was tantamount to a charge on the facts, indirectly \r\n  indicating to the jury that the judge perceived the evidence as to Hammitt to \r\n  more directly establish his participation in the conspiracy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur supreme court considered \r\n  the effect of inconsistent jury charges in the setting of a joint trial in State \r\n  v. Roof, 298 S.C. 351, 380 S.E.2d 828 (1989). In that case, each of two \r\n  co-defendants being jointly tried for murder had given pre-trial statements \r\n  admitting to disposing of the deceased's body, but denying any involvement in \r\n  the killing of deceased. Their individual statements inculpated themselves for \r\n  accessory after the fact of murder, although the evidence established that only \r\n  the two co-defendants were with the deceased at the time he was murdered. Circumstantially, \r\n  at least one of the two was responsible for causing the fatal wound.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOne co-defendant testified \r\n  consistent with his statement at trial, and the trial judge charged the jury \r\n  as to him that they could consider accessory after the fact as a lesser included \r\n  offense. However, the trial judge refused to charge accessory after the fact \r\n  for the non-testifying co-defendant. Our supreme court reversed, concluding \r\n  that giving the instruction as to the one testifying co-defendant was tantamount \r\n  to a charge on the ultimate factual issue in the case, that of the credibility \r\n  of the two defendants.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHowever, unlike Roof, \r\n  in this case there were multiple defendants in the conspiracy. Hammitt was not \r\n  alleged to be directly connected with either Gosnell or Fields. Unlike the discreet \r\n  crime charged in Roof, Hammitt's guilt for the charged conspiracy was \r\n  not interdependant upon the guilt or innocense of Gosnell or Fields. Consequently, \r\n  we fail to see how the erroneous charge could have been considered a charge \r\n  on any fact impacting on Hammitt's guilt. Accordingly, we find Hammitt's argument \r\n  to be without merit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  SEVERANCE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHammitt's argument as to \r\n  severance is identical to that raised and ruled upon by this Court in State \r\n  v. Castineira, Op. No. 3216 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 17, 2000) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 40. For the reasons set forth in that opinion, we find this \r\n  argument to be without merit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  SENTENCING \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Hammitt's final issue is \r\n  identical to that raised and ruled upon by this court in State v. Castineira, \r\n  Op. No. 3216 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 \r\n  at 40. For the reasons set forth in that opinion, we find this argument to be \r\n  without merit.  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, Hammitt's conviction \r\n  and sentence are \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HUFF, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n1.

The \r\n  family court judge concluded Queen's consent was required and denied the Does' \r\n  request to terminate Queen's parental rights. Subsequently, the judge denied \r\n  the Does' motion to reconsider and motion for a new trial. Finally, he ordered \r\n  the parties to agree to a \"work-in\" schedule to move Baby Boy Tanner (Tanner) \r\n  from the Does' home to Queen's home. The Does appeal. We reverse and remand.(1) \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen and the birth mother \r\n  lived together in Kings Mountain, North Carolina from November 1997 to February \r\n  1998. In February, the birth mother informed Queen that she was pregnant and \r\n  wanted an abortion, to which Queen objected. Conflicts between the couple arose, \r\n  and the couple separated in February. Over the next two months, Queen and the \r\n  birth mother maintained contact and occasionally saw one another. Thereafter, \r\n  Queen had little contact with the birth mother.(2) \r\n  At some point, the birth mother told Queen she had already gone to Atlanta and \r\n  aborted the pregnancy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTanner was born on September \r\n  21, 1998. Because the birth mother withheld Queen's address on the Consent/Relinquishment \r\n  for Adoption form, the Does' attorney was not able to notify Queen of the birth \r\n  until November 1998. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen the Does' attorney \r\n  informed Queen about the adoption and requested his signature, Queen responded \r\n  that he needed to consult his attorney. The first evidence Queen retained an \r\n  attorney is February of 1999, when an attorney signed a consent order on Queen's \r\n  behalf. Queen did not file an answer to the Does' complaint until August 9, \r\n  1999, the day of the hearing.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court judge found \r\n  Queen prepared a nursery and arranged for medical insurance. Also, despite conflicting \r\n  testimony, the trial judge found Queen established a bank account for Tanner. \r\n  There was no documentary evidence of a savings account. However, when asked \r\n  if there was money set aside for Tanner, Queen stated, \"I do have money.\" To \r\n  a similar question, Queen responded, \"I would initially take Two Thousand Dollars \r\n  out of my savings and put into his savings account. I would make a savings account.\" \r\n  When asked if he had been putting away money since finding out about Tanner's \r\n  birth, Queen responded affirmatively.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court judge concluded \r\n  Queen's consent to the adoption was required pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690 \r\n  (Supp. 1999) and Abernathy v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 437 S.E.2d 25 (1993). \r\n  He then concluded Queen's parental rights should not be terminated under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1572(3) &amp; (4) (Supp. 1999), for failure to visit and failure \r\n  to support. Citing the guardian ad litem's report, which stated that \r\n  either the Does or Queen would be suitable to have custody of Tanner, the court \r\n  found that the interests of Tanner and Queen were not in conflict.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court denied \r\n  the Does' post-trial motions and ordered the parties to agree to a schedule \r\n  transferring custody of Tanner to Queen. The family court also denied the Does' \r\n  motion to stay the order transferring custody.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdoptions are equitable \r\n  proceedings, and therefore, we have jurisdiction to find facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Adoptive Parents \r\n  v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 446 S.E.2d 404 (1994); Phillips \r\n  v. Baker, 284 S.C. 134, 325 S.E.2d 533 (1985). In exercising our jurisdiction, \r\n  we are mindful the child is the proper focus of the review. Morgan v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs., 280 S.C. 577, 313 S.E.2d 350 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\n LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe Does argue the family \r\n  court erred in finding Queen's consent to the adoption was necessary under the \r\n  South Carolina Adoption Act. However, Queen's consent is required only if he \r\n  \"paid a fair and reasonable sum, based on [his] financial ability, for the support \r\n  of the child or for expenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy \r\n  or with the birth of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, hospital, \r\n  and nursing expenses.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) (Supp. 1999).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is a complete absence \r\n  of evidence that Queen either supported or attempted to support Tanner after \r\n  learning of the child's existence. Likewise, the only evidence of support for \r\n  the birth mother during her pregnancy was the birth mother's access to a bank \r\n  account she shared with Queen. While living together, Queen and the birth mother \r\n  opened a joint checking account and shared expenses. Queen continued to deposit \r\n  his checks in the joint checking account until July 1998, when the birth mother \r\n  closed the account. In deposition testimony submitted to the trial judge as \r\n  an attachment to the Does' motion for new trial, Queen testified the birth mother \r\n  took approximately $200 from his account after she moved out. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn our view, the record \r\n  does not support a finding that Queen paid a reasonable sum, based on his financial \r\n  ability, for the support of Tanner or for the birth mother's expenses. There \r\n  is no question Queen had the financial means to contribute to Tanner's support. \r\n  He testified he held two jobs, and had significant sums in his savings and checking \r\n  accounts. Even if the birth mother used funds from the joint account until July, \r\n  there is no evidence Queen provided any support from July until September, when \r\n  Tanner was born. Moreover, it is unclear that Queen set aside money for Tanner \r\n  in an account for his benefit. The arrangements for insurance and the purchase \r\n  of a crib are not sufficient support to require Queen's consent under the statute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRelying on Abernathy \r\n  v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 437 S.E.2d 25 (1993), the family court excused \r\n  Queen's failure to support either the birth mother during her pregnancy or Tanner \r\n  after Queen learned of his birth. In Abernathy, the biological father \r\n  made numerous attempts to financially support the birth mother and child but \r\n  was repeatedly rebuffed by the mother. Upon learning of the adoption action, \r\n  the father immediately answered, demonstrating his willingness to assume sole \r\n  custody of the child. The Supreme Court excused the father for his failure to \r\n  meet the literal requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) because the mother \r\n  thwarted the father's efforts to commit to the child. The Supreme Court held \r\n  \"an unwed father is entitled to constitutional protection not only when he meets \r\n  the literal requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), but also when he undertakes \r\n  sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and \r\n  to comply with the statute.\" Id. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the Abernathy \r\n  exception to apply, the unwed father must exhibit \"a full commitment to the \r\n  responsibilities of parenthood.\" Parag v. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, \r\n  227, 508 S.E.2d 590, 593 (Ct. App. 1998). In Abernathy, the Supreme Court \r\n  concluded, \"Time and circumstances may limit the protectibility of an unwed \r\n  father's interest in his child. The values that underlie protection require \r\n  that the father take advantage of his opportunity to develop a relationship \r\n  with his child early and completely.\" Abernathy, 313 S.C. at 33, 437 \r\n  S.E.2d at 29. An unwed father must timely demonstrate a commitment to his child \r\n  and a desire to grasp the opportunity to assume full responsibility for his \r\n  child. Id. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen learned of Tanner's \r\n  birth in November 1998. He made no efforts to visit the child before the adoption \r\n  hearing on August 9, 1999. Further, he waited almost a year, until the day of \r\n  the adoption hearing, to file an answer in opposition to the request for adoption. \r\n  Most significant, however, was Queen's lack of effort to support Tanner after \r\n  learning of his birth. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen's efforts concerning \r\n  Tanner do not rise to the level of commitment discussed in Abernathy. \r\n  Therefore, we cannot excuse Queen's failure to meet the literal requirements \r\n  of the statute. See Doe v. Brown, 331 S.C. 491, 489 S.E.2d 917 \r\n  (1997) (wherein the Supreme Court found the father's conduct after learning \r\n  of the pregnancy failed to rise to the level necessary to meet the Abernathy \r\n  standard); Ex parte Black, 330 S.C. 431, 499 S.E.2d 229 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\n  (refusing to apply Abernathy to excuse the father's failure to support \r\n  his child for five months after learning he was the child's father). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Although we do not condone \r\n  the birth mother's actions in hiding the pregnancy and birth from Queen, we \r\n  find Queen did not manifest a prompt willingness to commit to the child and \r\n  his actions do not establish a vigorous attempt to assume parental responsibility. \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is reversed and the case is remanded \r\n  for adoption proceedings in accordance with this opinion.(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J., \r\n  concurs and HOWARD, J., dissents in separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWARD, J., (Dissenting): \r\n   I agree with the majority that an \"unwed father is entitled to constitutional \r\n  protection not only when he meets the literal requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), \r\n  but also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume \r\n  parental responsibility and to comply with the statute.\" Abernathy v. Baby \r\n  Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 32, 437 S.E.2d 25, 29 (1993). Nevertheless, I disagree \r\n  with the majority's conclusion that Queen's efforts in making a commitment to \r\n  Tanner do not rise to the level discussed in Abernathy. I believe Abernathy \r\n  supports the trial judge's ruling, and mandates that we affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn affirming the award of \r\n  custody to an unwed father, our supreme court noted that the father may possess \r\n  a relationship with his child that is entitled to constitutional protection. \r\n  Abernathy, 313 S.C. at 31, 437 S.E.2d at 28 (citing Stanley v. Illinois, \r\n  405 U.S. 645 (1972)). Recognizing that parental rights \"do not spring full-blown \r\n  from the biological connection,\" the court pointed out that \"an unwed father \r\n  must demonstrate a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by \r\n  coming forward to participate in the rearing of his child before his interest \r\n  in personal contact with his child acquires substantial constitutional protection.\" \r\n  Abernathy, 313 S.C. at 31, 437 S.E.2d at 28 (quoting Lehr v. Robertson, \r\n  463 U.S. 248 (1983)). Although the court found that with the enactment of section \r\n  20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) the Legislature intended to establish \"general minimum standards \r\n  by which an unwed father timely may demonstrate his commitment to the child, \r\n  and his desire to 'grasp [the] opportunity,'\" the court recognized that an unwed \r\n  father is entitled to constitutional protection not only when he meets the literal \r\n  requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), but also when he undertakes sufficient \r\n  prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and to comply \r\n  with the statute. Id. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn reaching this conclusion, \r\n  the court specifically stated:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHowever, as shown by the \r\n  events leading to this appeal, an unwed father's ability to cultivate his opportunity \r\n  interest in his child can be thwarted by the refusal of the mother to accept \r\n  the father's expressions of interest in and commitment to the child. . . . To \r\n  mandate strict compliance with section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) would make an unwed \r\n  father's right to withhold his consent to adoption dependent upon the whim of \r\n  the unwed mother. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 32-3, 437 \r\n  S.E.2d at 29.\r\n \r\nI believe the events leading \r\n  to this appeal mandate the same result. The father in this case had no \r\n  opportunity to cultivate a relationship with his child. During her pregnancy, \r\n  the birth mother consistently told Queen that she intended to and in fact had \r\n  terminated her pregnancy, despite Queen's strong objection to the abortion. \r\n  Due to the birth mother's deceit during the pregnancy, Queen did not learn he \r\n  was a father until the Does' attorney contacted him several months after the \r\n  birth. Queen informed the Does' attorney that he did not want to give up his \r\n  parental rights and would contact an attorney.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter learning of Tanner's \r\n  birth, Queen established a nursery, set up health insurance for the child, arranged \r\n  child care, and began a savings account for the child. The majority concludes \r\n  these efforts do not rise to the level of commitment discussed in Abernathy. \r\n  In addition, the majority determined that Queen's failure to visit or support \r\n  the child after learning of his birth, together with his delay in filing an \r\n  answer in opposition to the request for adoption, provide a basis for finding \r\n  that Queen's consent to this adoption is not required. I respectfully disagree \r\n  with these conclusions. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere are several important \r\n  facts in this case which parallel the key facts in Abernathy. In Abernathy, \r\n  it was \"undisputed that Mitchell attempted to provide monetary support to [the \r\n  birth mother] during her pregnancy, but his offers were rejected by her.\" Abernathy, \r\n  313 S.C. at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29. In this case, Queen maintained a joint checking \r\n  account, and the birth mother withdrew and spent funds from it during her pregnancy. \r\n  In Abernathy, the birth mother \"shielded herself from contact with [Mitchell], \r\n  even to the point of complaining to her superiors that Mitchell was harassing \r\n  her by his numerous telephone calls.\" Id. at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29. Here, \r\n  the birth mother went to extraordinary efforts to distance herself from Queen. \r\n  In addition to her direct lies, she charged Queen with a criminal violation, \r\n  which he successfully defended. She sought and obtained a restraining order \r\n  preventing him from contacting her. She even lied on the birth records concerning \r\n  her knowledge of Queen's mailing address.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe overwhelming evidence \r\n  in this case establishes that Queen did not know of the existence of his child \r\n  until the Does' attorney contacted him in November 1999 seeking his release \r\n  of parental rights, informing him of the impending litigation, and refusing \r\n  to divulge the identity of the Does or the whereabouts of the child. In fact, \r\n  the Does have never disclosed their identity or address to Queen. To all of \r\n  this, Queen's response was to retain legal counsel, fight the action to terminate \r\n  his parental rights, and seek custody of his child.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen has never had \r\n  an opportunity to develop a relationship with his child. Even so, he immediately \r\n  manifested his willingness to assume sole custody of his child when he first \r\n  learned of the child's existence and the adoption proceeding was contemporaneously \r\n  initiated. As in Abernathy, Queen did so by bringing legal action for \r\n  custody. \r\n   \r\nI believe the majority has \r\n  placed an unreasonable burden on Queen to take extraordinary legal measures \r\n  to gain access to his child pendente lite, despite the fact that the \r\n  adoption statutes sanction the anonymity which prevented him from doing so.(5) \r\n  In addition, the majority's conclusion that Queen made no efforts to visit or \r\n  support Tanner after learning of his birth ignores the clear fact that both \r\n  the biological mother and the Does have consistently taken vigorous legal measures \r\n  to avoid any contact between Queen and his son, before and throughout the course \r\n  of these proceedings.(6) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe majority also places \r\n  significance on the timing of a formal response by Queen, noting that Queen \r\n  waited almost a year to file an answer in opposition to the request for adoption. \r\n  I believe it is improper to attach any meaning to the timing of responsive pleadings \r\n  when there is no basis in the record for doing so. Queen's attorney filed and \r\n  served a formal answer within two months of service of the amended complaint. \r\n  There are many possible reasons for the delay, none of which have anything to \r\n  do with Queen or his state of mind. Since the timing of the pleadings was not \r\n  an issue in the family court, the record does not explain the reasons for any \r\n  apparent delays. Consequently, any inference adverse to Queen is based on pure \r\n  speculation. \r\n   \r\nIt may be true that the \r\n  adoptive parents present a more stable environment. This is not atypical. Adoptive \r\n  parents usually have a strong desire to raise a family and tend to be loving, \r\n  mature and stable people who would be committed parents. Quite naturally, the \r\n  life they envision for the child provides many advantages. After all, there \r\n  are no accidental adoptions. It is certainly enticing for appellate judges to \r\n  exercise their judgment to provide a child with what appears to be the better \r\n  home, notwithstanding the biological connection or desires of the natural parent. \r\n  However, to do so is to let loose the enormous judicial power of the State to \r\n  selectively choose which people will raise our children, irrespective of any \r\n  biological connection. I believe this treads on the most fundamental rights \r\n  of our citizens as afforded by the South Carolina Constitution and the Constitution \r\n  of the United States.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere are few young, unmarried \r\n  adults who are required to exercise the degree of maturity and planning necessary \r\n  to raise a child. Until the birth of a child, the need for fiscal responsibility \r\n  and future planning is not pressing because, until then, only they suffer the \r\n  consequences of their bad choices. Indeed, the introduction of children into \r\n  the home usually provides the impetus for planning, maturing and changing expectations. \r\n  However, the maturation process is an evolutionary journey. The transformation \r\n  is not instantaneous. Therefore, it is fundamentally unfair of the judicial \r\n  system to make such a demand on this unwed father.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI believe the majority's \r\n  decision places such unrealistic expectations on an unwed father that it undermines \r\n  the most basic of civil rights, effectively replacing our existing body of law \r\n  with a subjective analysis not meeting constitutional muster. Queen timely demonstrated \r\n  a willingness to develop a full custodial relationship with Tanner. See \r\n  Abernathy, 313 S.C. at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29. The family court judge came \r\n  to this conclusion after carefully considering all of the evidence, and after \r\n  having viewed the demeanor of the witnesses. We were not privy to that first-hand \r\n  view of the case. In a well-reasoned order, the judge united the father with \r\n  the son. This difficult decision was supported by the conclusions of the guardian-ad-litem, \r\n  and, I believe, is mandated by our case law. For these reasons, I would affirm.\r\n1.  On \r\n  December 1, 1999, the Does filed a petition to supplement the record. By order \r\n  filed December 28, 1999, the petition was denied, but the Does were given permission \r\n  to reargue the issue at oral argument on the merits of the appeal. The Does' \r\n  request to supplement the record is again denied. \r\n2.  In \r\n  June 1998, the birth mother and her new boyfriend signed a criminal warrant \r\n  against Queen for assault with a deadly weapon (an automobile). A condition \r\n  of his bond was that he have no contact with the birth mother. Queen testified \r\n  at the adoption proceeding that the birth mother did not appear pregnant at \r\n  the hearing and he did not know she was still pregnant. Queen was found not \r\n  guilty of the criminal charges. A week after signing the criminal warrant against \r\n  Queen, the birth mother filed for an order of protection against Queen, resulting \r\n  in a consent order dated July 6, 1998, prohibiting Queen from going near the \r\n  birth mother for one year. Queen testified he did not see the birth mother after \r\n  the order of protection and criminal trial. \r\n3.  Because \r\n  we reverse on this issue, we need not reach the Does' remaining issues on appeal. \r\n  \r\n4.  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1736 (Supp. 1999), found in the Subarticle on Adoptions, and \r\n  entitled \"Use of fictitious names,\" reads as follows: \"For purposes of this \r\n  subarticle, the petitioner may employ the use of fictitious names where necessary \r\n  to avoid disclosure of identities of parties or persons, so long as service \r\n  of process or notice is considered sufficient by the court.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  The \r\n  Does filed and unsuccessfully argued two Petitions for a Writ of Supersedeas \r\n  in this Court in an attempt to supersede the family court's order implementing \r\n  a visitation procedure to gradually reunite Queen with his son. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3222","title":"Starnes v.

The circuit court reversed the suspension, finding Department \r\n  (1) lacked the authority to hold a hearing outside the ten-day time limit prescribed \r\n  by statute, (2) failed to issue a written order within the required thirty-day \r\n  period, and (3) submitted a breath test result based on an invalid simulator \r\n  test. Department appeals and we affirm.(1)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nThe basic facts of this \r\n  case are not in dispute. On July 25, 1998, Starnes was arrested for driving \r\n  under the influence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930 (Supp. 1999). Starnes \r\n  submitted to a breath test and, upon registering an alcohol concentration of \r\n  .15%, surrendered his driver's license to the arresting officer. On July&nbsp;31st, \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951 (Supp. 1998)(2), \r\n  Starnes enrolled in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program, requested an \r\n  administrative hearing, and obtained a temporary alcohol-restricted license. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nTwo weeks later, on August \r\n  14th, Department held an administrative hearing to review the suspension of \r\n  Starnes's license. At the hearing, Starnes argued Department failed to convene \r\n  the hearing within the ten-day period prescribed by Â§ 56-5-2951(H) and thus, \r\n  his suspension should be rescinded. The hearing officer, stating that he did \r\n  not receive notice of Starnes's request for a hearing until August 7th, found \r\n  the hearing was timely. Starnes also objected to the admission of the breath \r\n  test result, claiming the breath test was invalid due to an improper simulator \r\n  setting. The hearing officer disagreed, finding the State \"carried the burden \r\n  of proof on all the contested issues.\" On August 20th, the hearing officer sustained \r\n  the license suspension. Starnes, however, did not learn of the decision until \r\n  October 30th, when he received a letter dated October 21st.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStarnes filed a timely petition \r\n  for judicial review in the circuit court pursuant to the Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(I) (Supp. 1998). In addition to the \r\n  errors argued before the hearing officer, Starnes asserted that Department's \r\n  failure to provide notice of its decision within thirty days of the hearing \r\n  was also contrary to Â§ 56-5-2951(H).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the hearing before the \r\n  circuit court, Department stipulated that Starnes's hearing did not occur within \r\n  the statutory ten-day period and that Department failed to provide Starnes with \r\n  an order of decision within thirty days following the conclusion of the hearing. \r\n  By order dated January 29, 1999, the court reversed the decision of the Department's \r\n  hearing officer and reinstated Starnes's license. Department appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDepartment first argues \r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the admitted violation of the statutory ten-day \r\n  hearing requirement divested it of jurisdiction to hold a hearing in the first \r\n  instance. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the statutory provisions \r\n  governing our implied consent law, Department must suspend the license of anyone \r\n  who drives a motor vehicle and refuses to submit to an alcohol breath test or \r\n  who takes the test and registers an alcohol concentration of at least .15%. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(A) (Supp. 1998). Within ten days of a \r\n  notice of suspension, however, a person may request an administrative hearing. \r\n  See id. Â§ 56-5-2951(D)(2). The scope of this hearing is limited to proof \r\n  of (1) lawful arrest or detainment, (2) advisement of rights associated with \r\n  the implied consent statute, and (3) a refusal to submit to a test or the results \r\n  of a properly administered test showing an alcohol concentration level of .15% \r\n  or more. See id. Â§ 56-5-2951(H).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSubsection H also provides, \r\n  in relevant part: \"An administrative hearing must be held within ten days \r\n  after the request for the hearing is received by the department. However, \r\n  upon a showing of exigent circumstances by either party, a continuance may be \r\n  granted not to exceed thirty days.\" Id. (emphasis added). The parties \r\n  agree the implied consent hearing was not held within the period prescribed \r\n  by statute and neither requested a continuance.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRules of statutory construction \r\n  need not be applied when a statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys \r\n  a clear and definite meaning. Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. \r\n  434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995). Rather, the terms of the statute should be applied \r\n  according to their literal meaning. Id. at 436, 454 S.E.2d at 892. When \r\n  statutory language is clear, this court has no right \"to look for or impose \r\n  another meaning,\" or \"resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt \r\n  to limit or expand a statute's scope.\" Id. at 436-37, 454 S.E.2d at 892; \r\n  see also City of Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union, 323 \r\n  S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe language of Â§ 56-5-2951(H) \r\n  is clear and unambiguous: Department is required to hold an administrative hearing \r\n  within ten days of the department's receipt of a party's request. Cf. \r\n  South Carolina Police Officers Retirement Sys. v. City of Spartanburg, \r\n  301 S.C. 188, 391 S.E.2d 239 (1990) (\"must\" is mandatory); South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Dickinson, 288 S.C. 189, 341 S.E.2d \r\n  134 (1986) (holding language in statute that the Department shall provide a \r\n  review within twenty days after receipt of a party's request for an administrative \r\n  hearing on a license suspension is mandatory). We will not, therefore, look \r\n  behind the statute's terms in an attempt to ascertain a contrary legislative \r\n  intent.  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the reasoning \r\n  behind our supreme court's opinion in Dickinson applies equally to our \r\n  decision in this case. In Dickinson, the court analyzed S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-1-370 (Supp. 1984). There, as here, the statute provided for an administrative \r\n  hearing following a license suspension, stating that upon written request the \r\n  Department \"'shall afford . . . a review, as early as practicable within \r\n  twenty days after receipt of such request. . . .' (emphasis added).\" Dickinson, \r\n  288 S.C. at 190, 341 S.E.2d at 135. Furthermore, as here, Dickinson did not \r\n  receive his requested hearing within the statutorily-prescribed time period. \r\n  In affirming the circuit court's reversal of the Department's hearing officer, \r\n  the Dickinson court stated: \"The pivotal question in determining whether \r\n  the Department had jurisdiction at the time it conducted the hearing is whether \r\n  the word 'shall' as used in the statute is directory or mandatory.\" Id. \r\n  Thereafter, the court declared Â§ 56-1-370 \"clearly mandate[d]\" a hearing within \r\n  twenty days and held the failure to afford Dickinson a timely hearing divested \r\n  the Department of jurisdiction to hold an implied consent hearing in the first \r\n  instance. Id. at 191, 341 S.E.2d at 135.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs to Department's argument \r\n  that Â§ 56-5-2951(H) speaks of discretionary authority to continue a hearing \r\n  due to exigent circumstances, Department did not raise this argument to the \r\n  circuit court, and it therefore is not preserved for appellate review. See, \r\n  e.g., Schofield v. Richland County Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 78, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  189 (1994). Likewise, not having argued below that the ten-day provision conflicts \r\n  with the thirty-day notice requirement for contested hearings found in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-320(a) (Supp. 1999), Department is procedurally barred from \r\n  asserting it for the first time on appeal to this court. Id. at 82, 447 \r\n  S.E.2d at 191.  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, because Department \r\n  did not afford Starnes an administrative hearing within the statutorily mandated \r\n  ten-day period, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sustain the suspension. \r\n  The circuit court, therefore, did not err in ordering Department to reinstate \r\n  Starnes's license.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, we note the \r\n  legislature recently clarified the import of Department's failure to hold a \r\n  timely hearing. In 1999, the legislature amended Â§ 56-5-2951(H) to provide that \r\n  if Department fails to hold a hearing within thirty days of the receipt of a \r\n  request, it must issue an order explaining the delay and schedule a new hearing. \r\n  If, however, Department \"does not issue a written order within ten days or fails \r\n  to schedule or hold a subsequent hearing, the person shall have his driver's \r\n  license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege reinstated.\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§&nbsp;56-5-2951(H) (Supp. 1999). This amendment is indicative of the legislature's \r\n  intent to require Department to strictly adhere to the mandated time frames \r\n  involved in license suspensions.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDepartment further argues \r\n  the circuit court erred in reinstating Starnes's license because it failed to \r\n  provide him with a written order notifying him of the hearing officer's decision \r\n  within thirty days of the administrative hearing. The statutory provision in \r\n  question states: \"A written order must be issued to the person upholding \r\n  the suspension of the person's license, permit, or nonresident's operating privilege, \r\n  or denying the issuance of a license or permit within thirty days after the \r\n  conclusion of the administrative hearing.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(H) \r\n  (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). Department admits it did not meet this requirement. \r\n  Accordingly, we also affirm the reinstatement of Starnes's license on this ground \r\n  for the reasons discussed above. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause we affirm the circuit \r\n  court's decision to revoke the suspension and reinstate Starnes's license, we \r\n  need not consider Department's final argument concerning the allegedly faulty \r\n  simulator test. See, e.g., Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, \r\n  Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (noting that an appellate court \r\n  need not address appellant's remaining issues when its determination of a prior \r\n  issue is dispositive); Dickinson, 288 S.C. at 191, 341 S.E.2d at 136 \r\n  (\"Having found the twenty (20) day period to be mandatory it is not necessary \r\n  for us to reach the remaining exceptions.\").  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and \r\n  MOREHEAD, A.J., concur.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1.  We \r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  This \r\n  statute took effect on June 29, 1998. It was amended, however, by subsequent \r\n  legislative acts in 1999. Because the statute as it existed in 1998 governs \r\n  Starnes's license suspension, this opinion references only the 1998 cumulative \r\n  supplement to the Code in this regard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3223","title":"Scelba v.

The wife, Lorna Lee Scelba, appeals: \r\n  (1) the grant of a divorce to the husband, Vincent A. Scelba, on the ground \r\n  of adultery; (2) the valuation and equitable division of the marital assets; \r\n  and (3) the award of attorney fees. We dismiss the appeal.(1) \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe parties married in 1978 \r\n  and have one son, who was emancipated and had matriculated at Furman University \r\n  when the case came to trial. At the time of the final hearing, the husband was \r\n  seventy-seven years old and the wife was fifty-two. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe parties lived in New \r\n  Jersey for approximately four years after they married. Both then received three-year \r\n  assignments as missionaries in Haiti; however, because of illness, they were \r\n  unable to remain abroad to fulfill their commitments. After they returned from \r\n  Haiti, they lived on their farm in New York. During that time, the wife worked \r\n  as a church minister in a small country church. Although the husband began receiving \r\n  retirement and social security benefits within a few years of the marriage, \r\n  he also worked in a variety of occupations. These included buying, selling, \r\n  and renovating real estate, performing professionally as a concert cellist, \r\n  and serving as mayor of Milon, New York. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSometime around 1990, the \r\n  wife, without objection from the husband, accepted a position with a church \r\n  in Greer, South Carolina. Because, however, the husband had two years remaining \r\n  on his term as mayor, he remained in New York while the wife moved with the \r\n  parties' son to South Carolina. In 1992, the wife was appointed pastor of Triune \r\n  Methodist Church in Greenville, where she served as minister until sometime \r\n  in 1998. After the husband moved to Greenville, he became Executive Director \r\n  of the Carolina Youth Symphony.\r\n \r\nIn February 1997, the wife \r\n  introduced the husband to Samuel Dewey Wykle. Wykle frequently joined the parties \r\n  for supper in their home, staying through the evening. Although Wykle lived \r\n  only a few blocks away from the church parsonage, the wife would drive him home. \r\n  The husband testified the wife would leave with Wykle about 9:00 p.m. and return \r\n  after 11:30 p.m. Eventually, the situation progressed to the point that the \r\n  husband would wake up the next morning and discover the wife had stayed out \r\n  the entire night. This became more and more frequent as the days went on. In \r\n  the summer of 1997, the wife drove Wykle to West Virginia for medical treatment \r\n  and spent the night in a motel with him. When the husband questioned the wife \r\n  about this incident, the wife said Wykle had slept on the floor. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe parties' farm in New \r\n  York was sold December 7, 1997. Because they never intended to live in a large \r\n  place again, the parties decided to sell most of their furnishings there and \r\n  keep only their favorite pieces. The day before the farm was sold, however, \r\n  the wife, much to the husband's surprise, came to the residence with a large \r\n  van and three men. They emptied the house out, leaving only a few things of \r\n  lesser value. \r\n   \r\nThe day after the sale, \r\n  the husband drove back to South Carolina. When he arrived at the parsonage, \r\n  he found his clothes on the porch with note that said, \"Please leave. I don't \r\n  want you here any more.\" The husband, however, stayed at the parsonage, where, \r\n  a few days later, he was served with a motion for temporary relief and the initial \r\n  complaint in these proceedings. The husband soon filed a return to the motion \r\n  and an answer and counterclaim to the complaint. On January 5, 1998, the husband \r\n  amended his responsive pleadings to include a request for a divorce on the ground \r\n  of adultery, alleging the wife had engaged in an illicit relationship with Wykle. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA temporary hearing took \r\n  place January 12, 1998. At the hearing, the parties proffered a final settlement \r\n  of all the issues in the case. The family court, however, refused to approve \r\n  the settlement because the wife expressed too much reservation when she testified \r\n  about her consent to the agreement. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA second temporary hearing \r\n  took place May 26, 1998. On May 29, 1998, the family court issued a temporary \r\n  order requiring both parties to account to each other for all property in his \r\n  or her possession, restraining both parties from alienating any property during \r\n  the pendency of the action, restraining and enjoining both parties from removing \r\n  any property from the family court's jurisdiction while the litigation was pending, \r\n  and ordering the wife to surrender to the husband certain personal effects, \r\n  namely, \"Moroccan rugs, a statue from the Louvre, and a crucifix,\" no later \r\n  than June 10, 1998. The family court also ordered the wife to pay $10,000.00 \r\n  in attorney fees, suit costs, and investigative fees to the husband's attorney \r\n  by June 5, 1998.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn July 14, 1998, the husband \r\n  requested a rule to show cause against the wife, alleging she had violated the \r\n  temporary order by denying him access for purposes of inventory and appraisal \r\n  to property in her possession or under her control and failing to give him the \r\n  Moroccan rugs, the statue from the Louvre, and the crucifix. On July 15, 1998, \r\n  the family court ordered the wife to appear on September 4, 1998, to show cause \r\n  why she should not be held in contempt for violating the temporary order of \r\n  May 29, 1998. Although the wife was represented by counsel at the September \r\n  4 hearing, she herself failed to appear.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court declined \r\n  to consider the merits of the allegations concerning the wife's violations of \r\n  the temporary order, holding these issues should be considered only when the \r\n  wife \"is physically brought before the Court to answer the charges.\" Nevertheless, \r\n  the family court found the wife had been personally served with the order and \r\n  rule to show cause and failed to appear without a valid excuse. The family court \r\n  therefore held the wife in contempt for failing to appear at the scheduled hearing \r\n  and issued a bench warrant for her arrest. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSubsequently, the husband \r\n  moved for sanctions against the wife for failure to appear at a scheduled deposition. \r\n  At a hearing on December 7, 1998, at which the husband, his attorney, and the \r\n  wife's attorney were present, the family court found the wife failed to appear \r\n  at her deposition and ordered her to pay attorney fees of $400.00 through the \r\n  office of the husband's attorney.(2)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe final hearing took place \r\n  March 17, 1999. Present at the hearing were the husband, the husband's attorney, \r\n  the husband's witnesses, and the wife's attorney. Again, the wife failed to \r\n  appear, this time because of the outstanding bench warrant for her arrest. The \r\n  family court refused to grant a motion by the wife's attorney to continue the \r\n  case. Counsel for the wife rested after requesting the family court to consider \r\n  a financial declaration filed at the temporary hearing and submitting an affidavit \r\n  of attorney fees. The family court then proceeded to take testimony from the \r\n  husband and his witnesses. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court issued \r\n  the final order in the case on March 23, 1999. Pertinent to this appeal are \r\n  the following provisions in the order: (1) the grant of the divorce to the husband \r\n  on the ground of adultery;(3) (2) the award to \r\n  the wife of only thirty-five per cent of the marital property; (3) the valuations \r\n  of the parties' pension plans; and (4) the award of attorney fees to the husband \r\n  in the amount of $18,615.00, which included the $10,000.00 ordered at the temporary \r\n  hearing.(4) The matters raised by the husband \r\n  in the rule to show cause have still not been resolved.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDismissal of a litigant's \r\n  appeal has been recognized as \"a proper sanction for his or her contemptuous \r\n  conduct.\"(5) Furthermore, \"[u]nder the court's \r\n  inherent power to ignore the demands of litigants who persist in defying the \r\n  legal orders and processes of the jurisdiction, the court may dismiss an appeal \r\n  by a person who stands in contempt of court in the proceeding in which he seeks \r\n  to take an appeal.\"(6) This discretionary right \r\n  of an appellate court to refuse to hear an appeal, a right known as the \"fugitive \r\n  disentitlement doctrine,\" has long been recognized by the United States Supreme \r\n  Court.(7) The policy behind the doctrine has \r\n  since been explained as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe rationales for this \r\n  doctrine include the difficulty of enforcement against one not willing to subject \r\n  himself to the court's authority, the inequity of allowing that \"fugitive\" to \r\n  use the resources of the courts only if the outcome is an aid to him, the need \r\n  to avoid prejudice to the nonfugitive party, and the discouragement of flights \r\n  from justice.(8) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn order for an appellate \r\n  court to invoke the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to dismiss an appeal, two \r\n  prerequisites must be met: (1) the appellant must be a fugitive; and (2) there \r\n  must be a connection between the fugitive status and the appellate process the \r\n  appellant seeks to utilize.(9) We hold both requirements \r\n  have been satisfied here.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWithout question, the wife, \r\n  by her own actions, has become a fugitive in this litigation. The family court \r\n  found her in contempt for her failure to appear at the hearing on the rule to \r\n  show cause on her failure to abide by the temporary order.(10) \r\n  After a bench warrant was issued for her arrest, she was found to have willfully \r\n  failed to appear at a scheduled deposition. At the final hearing, her attorney \r\n  candidly informed the family court that she was not present because of her belief \r\n  that she would be arrested on the bench warrant. To date, the matters giving \r\n  rise to the bench warrant have not been adjudicated because of the wife's refusal \r\n  to submit to the family court's jurisdiction.(11) \r\n  The wife's predicament is analogous to those of escapees whose appeals were \r\n  dismissed while they continued to evade criminal process.(12) \r\n  Nevertheless, the fact that the adjudication of contempt against the wife arose \r\n  from a civil matter does not affect her status as a fugitive.(13) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, we hold case \r\n  law supports our finding of a sufficient connection between the wife's fugitive \r\n  status and her appeal to this court. In Huskey v. Huskey,(14) \r\n  this court declined to adjudicate an appeal of the equitable division of parties' \r\n  marital property because the appellant had absconded from the family court's \r\n  jurisdiction in order to avoid arrest for failure to appear in connection with \r\n  a contempt proceeding arising from the divorce but concerning matters outside \r\n  the property division. Citing Benedict v. Benedict,(15) \r\n  this court stated, \"We decline to hear the appeal of a party who by absenting \r\n  himself from the jurisdiction and evading the processes of the court frustrates \r\n  the administration of justice.\"(16)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the nexus between \r\n  the wife's fugitive status and her appeal to this court is even stronger than \r\n  that in Huskey. Among other things, the wife has appealed the award of \r\n  attorney fees to the husband. In addressing that issue, the family court stated, \r\n  \"This was a lengthy case made complex by the Wife's refusal and failure to cooperate \r\n  and follow the Orders of this Court. The Husband's attempts to secure the Wife's \r\n  compliance with the Court's Temporary Order and be able to inventory and appraise \r\n  all furnishings were frustrated by the Wife.\" Furthermore, the wife has already \r\n  flaunted prior orders requiring her to pay the husband's attorney fees. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter reviewing the record \r\n  and briefs, we further hold the circumstances of this case warrant the application \r\n  of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine and dismissal of the wife's appeal. \r\n  To effectuate the property division, the family court granted the husband a \r\n  judgment against the wife in the amount of $166,311.59 and ordered the wife \r\n  to transfer certain assets to the husband through a qualified domestic relations \r\n  order. The family court also granted the husband a judgment for attorney fees \r\n  and retained jurisdiction to grant an additional judgment to the husband if \r\n  the wife failed to execute the qualified domestic relations order. Nevertheless, \r\n  as long as the wife refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the family court \r\n  and to otherwise disclose her whereabouts, the husband has no practical means \r\n  of enforcing the final divorce decree, whether that enforcement involves compelling \r\n  the transfer of certain assets or executing a judgment.(17) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nUnder these circumstances, \r\n  we hold it would be inequitable to allow the wife to use the appeal process \r\n  to obtain a judgment that is favorable to her.(18) \r\n  Considering the wife's flagrant disregard of prior orders in this litigation, \r\n  we take a dim view of the possibility that she will voluntarily return to South \r\n  Carolina or otherwise cooperate with any order that she does not fancy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and SHULER, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Because \r\n  oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we \r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  In \r\n  his brief, the husband states these fees have not been paid, and the wife has \r\n  made no assertions to the contrary. \r\n3.  The \r\n  evidence of adultery also included the following: (1) cancelled checks for a \r\n  reservation for an aborted New Year's Eve rendezvous at a mountain inn in North \r\n  Carolina and notations in the wife's handwriting on an advertisement for the \r\n  inn; (2) an investigator's, testimony that, on the evening of December 27, 1997, \r\n  he saw the wife and Wykle first dining together at Hardees and then passionately \r\n  kissing each other in the wife's Lexus automobile while the car was parked first, \r\n  with the interior lights on, in a handicapped space at a Bi-Lo and less than \r\n  an hour later at a Dairy Queen, at which time the couple assumed noticeably \r\n  compromising positions; (3) a last will and testament executed by the wife naming \r\n  Wykle as personal representative as well as a partial beneficiary; (4) five \r\n  cancelled checks written from December 3, 1997, to January 1, 1998, to Wykle \r\n  totaling $899.00, all of which were signed by the wife and payable on her account; \r\n  and (5) a van rental contract signed by the wife and listing Wykle as an additional \r\n  driver. \r\n4.  Although \r\n  the husband's attorney received $10,000.00 from the wife, it was determined \r\n  after the final hearing that the wife had made the payment with funds belonging \r\n  to the husband. \r\n5.  17 \r\n  C.J.S.

Moreover, while the appeal has been \r\n  pending, the wife, when responding to a motion by her attorney to withdraw from \r\n  the case, corresponded with this court using an out-of-state post office box \r\n  as her address. \r\n12.  \r\n  E.g., Lamb v.

In Benedict, this court \r\n  \"decline[d] to hear an appeal of a person, who, by secreting his whereabouts, \r\n  frustrates the administration of justice in our state and during the appeal \r\n  process evades the processes of the court and refuses to submit himself to its \r\n  jurisdiction.\" Id. at 510, 313 S.E.2d at 58. \r\n16.  \r\n  Huskey, 284 S.C. at 505, 327 S.E.2d at 360. \r\n17.  \r\n  See Barnette, 129 F.3d at 1183 (\"Impossibility of enforcement \r\n  was the initial reason for the establishment of the fugitive disentitlement \r\n  doctrine.\"). \r\n   \r\nWe note in passing that, \r\n  despite the wife's position as a church minister, the testimony reveals she \r\n  committed other improprieties that show an indifference on her part to the law \r\n  and to the rights of others. These include taking the husband's handicapped \r\n  parking pass, taking and failing to repay $6,800.00 from the husband without \r\n  his permission, and confiscating the husband's C-pack (a medical device that \r\n  allowed him to breathe properly with only one functioning lung) for about a \r\n  week. \r\n18.  \r\n  See United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 681 n.2 (stating the \r\n  disentitlement doctrine is based on equitable principles); Molinaro, \r\n  396 U.S. at 366 (\"While such [fugitive status] does not strip the case of its \r\n  character as an adjudicable case or controversy, we believe it disentitles the \r\n  defendant to call upon the resources of the Court for determination of his claims.\"); \r\n  Barnette, 129 F.3d at 1184 (stating, in dismissing an appeal because \r\n  of the appellant's fugitive status, that \"'[h]e who offends against the law \r\n  seeks in vain the help of the law' is a very old legal maxim\"). In Barnette, \r\n  the eleventh circuit court of appeals further supported its decision by stating \r\n  that: (1) no good reason existed to anticipate that a decision adverse to the \r\n  appellant would affect the satisfaction of his forfeiture judgment; and (2) \r\n  the appellant \"only wishes to use this court in an attempt to receive a favorable \r\n  judgment - the only judgment by which, it appears, he will abide.\"). Id. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n In dismissing the wife's \r\n  appeal, we note that other jurisdictions have reached similar results in family \r\n  court litigation. See, e.g., Schmidt v. Schmidt, 610 A.2d 1374 \r\n  (Del. 1992) (holding the husband had forfeited his right to appeal the family \r\n  court's decision concerning property division because he was in defiance of \r\n  a court order and had evaded further enforcement); Medina v. Medina, \r\n  445 S.E.2d 61 (N.C. Ct. App.), review denied, 448 S.E.2d 528 (N.C. 1994) \r\n  (dismissing the wife's appeal of an order finding her in willful contempt because \r\n  her whereabouts remained unknown); Guerin v. Guerin, 993 P.2d 1256 (Nev. \r\n  2000) (dismissing a fugitive wife's appeal of an order directing the transfer \r\n  of property and of a subsequent order of contempt).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Medina, the North \r\n  Carolina Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal by the plaintiff, whose whereabouts \r\n  remained unknown after she was found in contempt of a visitation order, and \r\n  stated, \"[I]f we affirm the orders of the trial court, the plaintiff is not \r\n  likely to present herself to the court and comply with the orders. . . . If \r\n  we reverse the orders of the trial court, plaintiff will appear or not, as she \r\n  may consider most for her interest.\" Id. at 63 (citations omitted). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3224","title":"Bowen v.

(collectively \r\n  \"Defendants\"). The trial court initially granted summary judgment to Defendants \r\n  on the implied warranty and negligence claims. Following a hearing on Defendants' \r\n  motions to reconsider, the court issued a form order granting summary judgment \r\n  on the remaining gross negligence claim.(1) Bowen \r\n  appeals from the order on reconsideration.(2) \r\n  We vacate and remand.(3)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPaul Morris was employed \r\n  as a gel prep operator at General Nutrition Corporation's vitamin manufacturing \r\n  plant in Greenville. At the time of the accident, Morris was cleaning pressure \r\n  vessels, or \"gel melters.\" Gel melters, essentially giant mixers, utilize steam-generated \r\n  heat to melt the gelatin used in making vitamin \"gelcaps.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn May 11, 1993, around \r\n  5:00 p.m., Morris began cleaning a gel melter by mixing water and trisodium \r\n  phosphate (TSP) in the vessel's bowl and turning on its steam jacket.(4) \r\n  Because the vessel's temperature gauge was broken, Morris had been instructed \r\n  to let the steam heat the TSP mixture for approximately fifteen minutes. Thereafter, \r\n  Morris either opened the vessel's rubber-sealed porthole to check the mixture \r\n  or the overheated mixture in the pressurized container exploded and blew the \r\n  porthole's cover off. Morris was doused with the scalding hot TSP mixture. Despite \r\n  extensive treatment at the Augusta Regional Medical Center, Morris died fifteen \r\n  days later, having suffered chemical and thermal burns over eighty-two per cent \r\n  of his body. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is proper \r\n  when it is clear there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.(5) \r\n  Summary judgment should be granted when plain, palpable, and undisputable facts \r\n  exist upon which reasonable minds cannot differ.(6) \r\n  To determine whether an issue of fact exists, the court must view the evidence \r\n  and all its inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.(7) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal from the grant \r\n  of summary judgment, an appellate court must determine whether the trial court's \r\n  stated grounds for its decision are supported by the record.(8) \r\n  It is our duty to undertake a thorough and meaningful review of the trial court's \r\n  order and the entire record on appeal. Where, as here, the trial court fails \r\n  to articulate the reasons for its action on the record or enter a written order \r\n  outlining its rationale, we simply cannot perform our designated function.(9) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe therefore hold a trial \r\n  court's order on summary judgment must set out facts and accompanying legal \r\n  analysis sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review.(10) \r\n  Such an order must \"include those facts which the circuit court finds relevant, \r\n  determinative of the issues and undisputed.\"(11) \r\n  In doing so, the trial court should \"provide clear notice to all parties and \r\n  the reviewing court as to the rationale applied in granting . . . summary judgment.\"(12) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nWe are aware that some courts \r\n  believe \"factual findings\" to be ill-advised in that they might imply that a \r\n  fact question was presented which would warrant denial of the summary judgment \r\n  motion. In our opinion, however, the better view is that these findings are \r\n  helpful in indicating the basis upon which the trial court made its decision \r\n  and what it understood to be the undisputed facts for granting the summary judgment \r\n  motion.(13) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the \"facts\" \r\n  to which we refer are not factual findings in the ordinary sense as contemplated \r\n  in our rules of procedure.(14) Rather, these \r\n  factual findings are statements made by the court as it views the evidence and \r\n  its inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.(15) \r\n  In Fayette County National Bank v. Lilly,(16) \r\n  the West Virginia Supreme Court was faced with an identical procedural rule \r\n  and prior case law stating that it was \"totally improper for the trial court \r\n  to make findings of fact in connection with granting a summary judgment [motion] \r\n  as the very nature of summary judgment is that there is no genuine issue of \r\n  material fact, entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.\"(17) \r\n  In reconciling seemingly opposing contentions, the court there stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe are fully cognizant that \r\n  a majority of jurisdictions do not require trial courts to set out findings \r\n  in orders granting summary judgment. . . . We believe this approach is grounded \r\n  in blind adherence to fictional legal form[ ] that sacrifices concrete legal \r\n  substance. Requiring that meaningful findings be set out in orders granting \r\n  summary judgment does not somehow transform circuit court[ ]s into triers of \r\n  fact - engaging in weighing [evidence] and credibility determinations that are \r\n  prerequisites for disputed jury facts. In reviewing a circuit court's order \r\n  granting summary judgment this Court, like all reviewing courts, engages in \r\n  the same type of analysis as the circuit court. . . . In the final analysis, \r\n  it is illogical to prohibit circuit courts from making meaningful findings in \r\n  granting summary judgment. . . . [W]e are [simply] requiring meaningful findings \r\n  that will guide our review of decisions [on] summary judgment. . . . To be clear, \r\n  being explicit about its reasoning not only assists the hearing tribunal in \r\n  analyzing legal claims and the equities of the situation, but also facilitates \r\n  appellate review.(18)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt least one federal circuit \r\n  has also addressed the apparent contradiction: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe judicial function relative \r\n  to fact-analysis on a motion for summary judgment is 'limited to ascertaining \r\n  whether any factual issue pertinent to the controversy exists; it does not extend \r\n  to resolution of any such issue.' A 'finding of fact' by the district court \r\n  in a summary judgment proceeding thus constitutes only a finding that no genuine, \r\n  material issue exists as to that fact; by the nature of summary judgment, it \r\n  cannot be an indication that the trial court has weighed the evidence and found \r\n  a fact in the traditional sense. 'Findings of fact' in a summary judgment proceeding \r\n  are therefore not truly findings of fact and should perhaps bear a different \r\n  label. By whatever name such 'findings' take, they can be helpful. . . . 'Findings \r\n  of fact' also help an appellate court 'in making clear the basis for the trial \r\n  court's decision and in indicating what that court understood to be the undisputed \r\n  facts on which summary judgment was granted.' Identifying the undisputed material \r\n  facts and indicating the basis for summary judgment are the sole purposes of \r\n  'findings of fact' on summary judgment.(19) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this instance, we are \r\n  presented with a seven-volume record on appeal involving the tragic death of \r\n  a twenty-eight-year-old father of four. Other than the trial court's cursory \r\n  form order, the record contains only one declaration from the bench pertinent \r\n  to the grant of summary judgment:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI'm sorry, Mr. Jordan, I \r\n  just really can't - I realize I could take the easy way out, but I just don't \r\n  see - I just don't see how the evidence in the record can establish a duty on \r\n  the part of the construction defendants that was breached in some grossly negligent \r\n  manner. \r\n   \r\nWe are unable to discern \r\n  from this statement whether the court found Defendants owed no duty to Bowen, \r\n  whether they owed a duty to Bowen and breached it, or whether they were negligent, \r\n  but not grossly negligent.(20) Moreover, our \r\n  initial review of the record leads us to determine the propriety of summary \r\n  judgment was a rather close question. It is imperative, then, that the trial \r\n  court state the material facts it found undisputed and the applicable law supporting \r\n  its grant of summary judgment to Defendants. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWe vacate summary judgment \r\n  on Bowen's claims of gross negligence and remand the case to the trial court \r\n  for a written order identifying the facts and accompanying legal analysis upon \r\n  which it relied in granting Defendants' summary judgment motion.(21) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVACATED AND REMANDED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nCURETON and SHULER, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1.  The \r\n  language of the trial court's form order read as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nThe motion to reconsider, by \r\ndefendants Piedmont, GM Mechanical &amp; TMC, is granted and summary judgment \r\nis granted as to the remaining gross negligence action against these defendants. \r\n\r\n2.  Defendants \r\n  contend the sole issue for our consideration is the grant of summary judgment \r\n  on gross negligence because Bowen failed to reference the first order on the \r\n  breach of warranty and simple negligence claims in his Notice of Appeal. We \r\n  agree that only the gross negligence claims remain, but do so for a different \r\n  reason. Bowen failed to brief any issue pertaining to theories of implied warranty \r\n  or negligence. Accordingly, we deem any issue related to these claims abandoned \r\n  and not preserved for our review. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, \r\n  314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (failure to provide arguments or supporting \r\n  authority for an issue renders it abandoned); O'Laughlin v. Windham, \r\n  330 S.C. 379, 498 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 1998) (issues are deemed abandoned and \r\n  not preserved for appellate review if an appellant fails to argue and offer \r\n  supporting authority for the error alleged). \r\n3.  We \r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n4.

Northern, 551 P.2d 866, 869 (Kan. 1976) (holding \r\n  that \"upon . . . entry [of summary judgment] the court should state the controlling \r\n  legal principles and enunciate the basis on which the judgment rests. Failure \r\n  to do so can only result in confusion. Frequently, neither the litigants nor \r\n  the appellate courts can decipher the ruling and uncover the genuine basis\" \r\n  for the trial court's decision.); Brown v. Wichita State Univ., 538 P.2d \r\n  713, 717 (Kan. 1975) (reiterating that the trial court should state the controlling \r\n  facts and the legal principles upon which it granted summary judgment because \r\n  otherwise, the appellate court \"will be required to explore and consider every \r\n  possible legal theory which may be said to be involved in the summary judgment. \r\n  Judges of a court of record, unlike a jury which may render an unreasoned decision \r\n  in a general verdict, must . . . assign reasons for the decision rendered.\"). \r\n  \r\n10.  \r\n  Indeed, several states have adopted procedural rules to this effect. See, \r\n  e.g., Jovine v. FHP, Inc., 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 322, 337 n.22 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (noting that a proper trial court order granting summary judgment would \r\n  fully comply with California rule section 437c(g), which states in relevant \r\n  part: \"Upon the grant of a motion for summary judgment . . . the court shall, \r\n  by written or oral order, specify the reasons for its determination. The order \r\n  shall specifically refer to the evidence proffered in support of, and if applicable \r\n  in opposition to, the motion which indicates that no triable issue exists. . \r\n  . .\"); W.F. Hayward Co. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 468, \r\n  474 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating a \"key objective\" of subdivision (g) of section \r\n  437c is for the purpose of meaningful appellate review); Masters v. Worsley, \r\n  777 P.2d 499, 501 (Utah Ct. App. 1989) (explaining that Utah R. Civ. P. 52(a) \r\n  requires a trial court to \"issue a brief written statement of the ground for \r\n  its decision on all motions granted under [the summary judgment rule] when the \r\n  motion is based on more than one ground.\" The court then noted, \"a statement \r\n  of grounds found by the trial court to justify summary judgment would be of \r\n  great assistance [to the appellate court], and in an appropriate case, failure \r\n  to do so may justify remand to the trial court.\"); Shortridge v. Platis, \r\n  458 N.E.2d 301, 306 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984) (stating that although the \"[f]ailure \r\n  to make specific findings is not fatal to . . . [summary] judgment,\" there are \r\n  \"compelling reasons for trial courts to set forth in writing the reasons for \r\n  granting summary judgment\"). Cf. Kline v. Kramer, 386 N.E.2d 982, \r\n  990 (Ind. Ct. App. 1979) (reiterating that state procedural rule 56(C) requires \r\n  the trial court to \"delineate those issues and claims upon which it finds no \r\n  genuine issue as to material facts\" but affirming the trial court's form order \r\n  because it was accompanied by a memorandum which \"fully discussed the issues \r\n  which [the appellants] raised in opposition to the summary judgment motion, \r\n  the facts relevant thereto, and the theory upon which it granted the appellees' \r\n  motion\").  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Supreme Court \r\nand a majority of federal circuits have held similarly. See, e.g., Carter \r\nv. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 671 (1972) (vacating summary judgment and remanding \r\nthe case to the district court where the court's order was \"opaque and unilluminating \r\nas to either the relevant facts or the law with respect to the merits\" of the \r\nclaim); Ackra Direct Mktg. Corp. v. Fingerhut Corp., 86 F.3d 852, 857 (8th \r\nCir. 1996) (explaining that although courts are not normally required to make \r\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law in ruling on motions, the court \"may remand \r\nwhen the lack of findings by the district court would substantially hinder\" appellate \r\nreview); Pasquino v. Prather, 13 F.3d 1049, 1050-51 (7th Cir. \r\n1994) (remanding the case where the district court's denial of summary judgment \r\nwas \"too cursory to permit proper appellate review\" because it neither identified \r\nthe facts determined to be disputed nor discussed why the disputed facts were \r\nmaterial to the issue at hand; the court stated that \"[c]onclusory rulings are \r\ninadequate material for the tools of the appellate bench\"); Roque-Rodriguez \r\nv. Lema Moya, 926 F.2d 103, 105 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that \r\nalthough brevity is permissible on summary judgment motions, \"a bench decision \r\nor memorandum which explicates the trial court's thinking will often prove to \r\nbe of inestimable value to the litigants and to a reviewing court\"); United \r\nStates v. Woods, 885 F.2d 352, 354 (6th Cir. 1989) (pointing out \r\nthat findings of fact are not \"absolutely required,\" but explaining that when \r\ndeciding motions for summary judgment, \"district courts should generally set out \r\nthe reasons for their decisions with some specificity, in clear though brief language, \r\nrather than simply tracking the language of the rule in their orders.\" The court \r\nelaborated, stating that when summary judgment motions are granted \"without any \r\nindication as to the specific facts and rules of law supporting the court's decision, \r\nit is difficult . . . for an appellate court to review such a decision. The absence \r\nof reasons may also often prejudice the reviewing court's view of the correctness \r\nof the decision below.\"); Van Bourg, Allen, Weinberg &amp; Roger v. NLRB, \r\n656 F.2d 1356, 1357 (9th Cir. 1981) (stating, \"When summary judgment \r\nhas been granted, a statement of the dispositive facts and controlling principles \r\nof law is permissible and indeed preferable to assist review on appeal. When the \r\ndistrict court's 'underlying holdings would otherwise be ambiguous or inascertainable,' \r\nthe reasons for entering summary judgment must be stated somewhere in the record.\") \r\n(internal citations omitted); Hanson v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas., 625 F.2d \r\n573, 575 (5th Cir. 1980) (in vacating and remanding for entry of reasons \r\nin support of summary judgment, the appellate court stated that although the absence \r\nof findings of fact and conclusions of law is not fatal, \"the parties are entitled \r\nto know the reasons upon which (summary) judgment(s) . . . are based . . . to \r\nsecure meaningful appellate review.\" The court continued by explaining that although \r\ntheir prior admonitions had been precatory in character, in practice, they \"insisted \r\nthat district courts record however informally their reasons for entering summary \r\njudgment, at least where their underlying holdings would otherwise be ambiguous \r\nor inascertainable.\") (internal citations omitted). \r\n11.  \r\n  Lilly, 484 S.E.2d at 237. \r\n12.  \r\n  Id. \r\n13.  \r\n  See 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

The complaint alleged, among other things, that the child was at risk \r\n  of sexual abuse by the father. Neither the father nor the mother answered the \r\n  complaint. \r\n   \r\nAt the beginning of the \r\n  intervention hearing, counsel for DSS made an oral motion to have the child \r\n  testify outside the visual presence of the father. As grounds for the motion, \r\n  counsel for DSS stated, \"[M]y first witness shall be the minor child in this \r\n  action. She is seventeen years old; she just turned seventeen. This [involves] \r\n  allegations regarding sexual abuse [and a] threat of sexual abuse, and she does \r\n  not want to testify in front of her father.\" Counsel for DSS informed the court \r\n  that she had made arrangements to have the father placed in a room where he \r\n  could hear the child's testimony but would not be in view of her. Additionally, \r\n  DSS sought leave for the father to consult his counsel after direct examination \r\n  and again after cross-examination.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe father objected to this \r\n  motion, arguing it denied him his right of confrontation. The family court, \r\n  however, granted the motion over the father's objection, observing, \"Well [counsel \r\n  for the father] can be present, but if [the father] can hear it . . . I mean \r\n  that's . . . enough of a right of confrontation. As long as he can hear it and \r\n  make sure he can hear it, I'm going to grant the motion.\" No further proceedings \r\n  were held or discussion had regarding the motion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe child then testified \r\n  outside the father's presence about three alleged incidents of improper \"touchings\" \r\n  occurring when the child was between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. Thereafter, \r\n  the family court issued the appealed order.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe father alleges the family \r\n  court's decision to allow the child to testify outside his presence violated \r\n  due process because it denied him the right of confrontation. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn South Carolina Department \r\n  of Social Services ex rel. Texas v. Holden,(2) \r\n  our supreme court acknowledged, \"The right to confrontation, although historically \r\n  limited to criminal prosecutions, has been applied in the civil context.\"(3) \r\n  In determining when this right should attach, the court in Brown v. South \r\n  Carolina State Board of Education(4) held, \r\n  \"Where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an \r\n  opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\"(5) \r\n  \r\n \r\nWe must decide, then, whether \r\n  due process required in the instant case that the father be given the opportunity \r\n  to confront a witness against him, namely, the child.(6) \r\n  We hold that it did so. The proceeding was one in which important decisions \r\n  depended upon questions of fact.(7) Also, it \r\n  involved a matter \"of more than ordinary gravity\" and one that could leave a \r\n  permanent mark upon the father.(8)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code section \r\n  16-3-1550(E) (Supp. 1999) requires the family court to \"treat sensitively witnesses \r\n  who are very young . . . by using closed or taped sessions when appropriate.\"(9) \r\n  In State v. Murrell,(10) our supreme \r\n  court set forth specific procedures to which a trial court must adhere to ensure \r\n  protection of these child witnesses:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFirst, the trial judge must \r\n  make a case-specific determination of the need for videotaped testimony. In \r\n  making this determination, the trial court should consider the testimony of \r\n  an expert witness, parents or other relatives, other concerned and relevant \r\n  parties, and the child. Second, the court should place the child in as close \r\n  to a courtroom setting as possible. Third, the defendant should be able to see \r\n  and hear the child, should have counsel present both in the courtroom and with \r\n  him, and communication should be available between counsel and appellant.(11) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nA trial court's decision \r\n  to allow testimony outside the presence of the defendant pursuant to section \r\n  16-3-1550(E) may be reversed only upon a showing that the trial court abused \r\n  its discretion in making the decision or in implementing the appropriate procedure \r\n  once the decision has been made.(12) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, even the most liberal \r\n  reading of the record reveals the family court failed to follow the prescribed \r\n  procedure both in making the decision to allow the child to testify outside \r\n  the father's presence and in implementing the procedure by which testimony was \r\n  taken. The family court made no fact-specific determination of the need for \r\n  the child to testify outside the father's presence.(13) \r\n  Indeed, no testimony was offered as to the degree of any trauma the child would \r\n  suffer if made to testify in the father's presence. Rather, the court simply \r\n  accepted counsel for DSS's statement that the child \"does not want to testify \r\n  in front of her father.\" Furthermore, the father was not placed in a position \r\n  allowing him to view the child during her testimony, and he did not have counsel \r\n  both with him and in the courtroom while the child testified.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold the family court \r\n  denied the father due process by refusing to allow him to confront the child.(14) \r\n  Given our disposition, we need not address the father's remaining issues on \r\n  appeal. \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and SHULER, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\n1.

Debra Fields appeals the court's valuation \r\n  of two family corporations and the exclusion from the marital estate of certain \r\n  corporate distributions to Richard Fields. We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nDebra J. Fields (Wife) and \r\n  Richard H. Fields (Husband) were married in 1985 and separated in 1996. On January \r\n  31, 1997 Wife filed for divorce. The family court entered a pendente lite consent \r\n  order at the time, and the parties later agreed to sever their divorce from \r\n  other marital issues. On December 12, 1997, the family court granted Husband \r\n  and Wife a divorce on the ground of one year's continuous separation. Thereafter, \r\n  on February 10, 1998, the court issued an order approving the parties' \"Custody \r\n  and Visitation Agreement\" pertaining to their three minor children.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe following day, Husband \r\n  and Wife attempted to resolve outstanding financial matters in an in-court settlement \r\n  agreement. An integral provision in the agreement stipulated that Wife's father, \r\n  along with a business partner, would personally guarantee Wife's purchase of \r\n  Husband's ownership interest in three family corporations. On March 16 the family \r\n  court approved the agreement, but vacated its order three days later when Wife's \r\n  father refused to sign the note necessary for Wife to purchase Husband's stock \r\n  shares. As a result, on May 18 the court held a hearing concerning the parties' \r\n  finances.  \r\n   \r\nThe principal dispute before \r\n  the family court involved the equitable distribution of stock in three business \r\n  interests informally known as Dove, Sparrow, and LFI. The stock in each business, \r\n  all sub-chapter S corporations, was held in the name of Husband. Consequently, \r\n  Husband owned 18% of Dove (18 shares), 40% of Sparrow (20,000 shares) and 3% \r\n  of LFI (20 shares).(2) For most of the parties' \r\n  marriage Dove, the corporate parent of several temporary labor franchises, employed \r\n  Husband as a vice president. Pursuant to a management agreement, Dove in turn \r\n  controlled Sparrow's operations. During the marital litigation, however, on \r\n  October 31, 1997 Dove fired Husband. Subsequently, Wife's father, Dove's CEO \r\n  and only shareholder besides Husband, ousted Husband from the corporation's \r\n  board of directors.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter several interim orders, \r\n  the family court issued a final order on November 12, 1998. In fashioning an \r\n  equitable distribution, the court awarded 53% of the marital assets to Husband, \r\n  who by prior consent obtained sole custody of the parties' minor children. Regarding \r\n  the disputed corporate assets, the court awarded Husband the shares in Sparrow \r\n  (valued at $328,000) and LFI (valued at $100,000), while Wife received the 18% \r\n  interest in Dove (valued at $415,710). Wife filed a timely motion to reconsider \r\n  and argued, inter alia, that the family court erred in its valuations of the \r\n  Dove and Sparrow stock and in failing to include certain corporate distributions \r\n  in the marital estate. Following a hearing and arguments from counsel, the court \r\n  denied the motion. This appeal followed. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStandard \r\n  of Review \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn appeals from the family \r\n  court, this Court retains jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our \r\n  own view of a preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 \r\n  S.C. 7, 471 S.E.2d 154 (1996); Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  373 (Ct. App. 1996). This broad scope of review, however, does not require us \r\n  to disregard the findings of the court below. Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 279 S.E.2d 616 (1981); Charest v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511, \r\n  495 S.E.2d 784 (Ct. App. 1997). Nor does it relieve an appellant of the burden \r\n  of convincing this Court that the family court erred. Skinner v. King, \r\n  272 S.C. 520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court has wide \r\n  discretion in determining how marital property is to be distributed. Murphy \r\n  v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 461 S.E.2d 39 (1995). In so doing, it \"may use \r\n  any reasonable means to divide the property equitably . . . .\" Id. at \r\n  329, 461 S.E.2d at 41-42. Accordingly, the court's apportionment of marital \r\n  property will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Id.; Dixon \r\n  v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 512 S.E.2d 539 (Ct. App. 1999).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  Date of Stock Valuation \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWife first argues the family \r\n  court erred in valuing the Dove and Sparrow stock as of December 31, 1997 rather \r\n  than January 31, 1997, the date she filed her initial complaint for divorce. \r\n  This issue is without merit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn general, marital property \r\n  subject to equitable distribution is valued as of the date marital litigation \r\n  is filed or commenced. See McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, \r\n  506 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1998); Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  804 (Ct. App. 1996). It is equally true, however, that the parties may be entitled \r\n  to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after \r\n  separation but before divorce. See McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. \r\n  490, 497 n.7, 511 S.E.2d 365, 369 n.7 (1999) (approving Smith v. Smith, \r\n  294 S.C. 194, 203, 363 S.E.2d 404, 409 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"We know of no authority, \r\n  and the husband does not cite any, that holds that only one spouse is entitled \r\n  to any appreciation in marital assets that occurs after the parties separate \r\n  and before the parties are divorced. We would think both parties would be entitled \r\n  to any such appreciation.\")); Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, 512 \r\n  S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"It is an unfortunate reality that, given the \r\n  volume of cases handled by our family courts, there often is a substantial delay \r\n  between the commencement of an action and its ultimate resolution. Thus, it \r\n  is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change, sometimes substantially, \r\n  between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution. In such \r\n  a case, the family court has the ability to consider the post-filing appreciation \r\n  or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.\"); Mallett, \r\n  323 S.C. at 141, 473 S.E.2d at 804 (affirming valuation of husband's business \r\n  at time of final hearing where business had declined in value by more than $30,000 \r\n  since commencement of the action).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court valued \r\n  the Dove and Sparrow stock as of December 31, 1997, the closest date to the \r\n  parties' December 12, 1997 divorce for which corporate information was available. \r\n  Because both stocks increased in value from December 1996 to December 1997, \r\n  the family court was well within its discretion in deciding to value them on \r\n  the later date. See id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  Valuation of Dove Stock \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWife next argues the family \r\n  court erred in valuing the Dove stock. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court has broad \r\n  discretion in valuing marital property such that this Court will affirm when \r\n  the findings below are supported by the evidence. See Smith v. Smith, \r\n  327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997) (an appellate court will affirm \r\n  the family court's valuation of marital property if it is within the range of \r\n  the evidence presented); Morehouse v. Morehouse, 317 S.C. 222, 452 S.E.2d \r\n  632 (Ct. App. 1994) (same). Here, the family court divided the two stocks in \r\n  question, awarding the Dove stock to Wife because it would give her \"an asset \r\n  valued at $415,710.00 and a ready market for sale to her father,\" the only other \r\n  Dove shareholder. The court then awarded Husband the stock in Sparrow (valued \r\n  at $328,000) and LFI (whose $100,000 value was not disputed) to effect an equitable \r\n  distribution. The record evidence clearly supports these values. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Husband and Wife \r\n  both presented expert testimony on the value of each stock.(3) \r\n  During his direct examination Wife's expert, Richard Vondrak, submitted four \r\n  valuation methods for the court's consideration: 1) adjusted book value; 2) \r\n  \"like-kind\" sale; 3) profit analysis; and 4) IRS system. When asked specifically \r\n  which method should be employed given the facts of the case, Vondrak replied: \r\n  \"That's almost impossible to answer . . . . I'm not clairvoyant to tell you \r\n  which of all these systems would-all fraught with weaknesses, you know.\" Vondrak \r\n  further declared that much of choosing a valuation approach \"is through judgment \r\n  and common sense.\" On cross-examination, however, Vondrak admitted it was important \r\n  to consider the effect of minority shareholder status in valuing stock, offering \r\n  the following as an example:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen I start a company, \r\n  I issue myself [] fifty-one percent (51%) of the shares. The other forty-nine \r\n  percent (49%) of the shares, as far as I am concerned, are valueless, because \r\n  I determine whether they get a dividend or not. I have complete control-  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn contrast, Husband's expert \r\n  Dennis Dabney emphatically stated that the appropriate method of valuation depended \r\n  on who was holding the stock: \" The value will vary . . . depending on who holds \r\n  [each] stock, and their relative position to the other shareholders in the corporation.\" \r\n  In essence, noted Dabney, the value for a stock accompanied by corporate control \r\n  is \"much, much more\" than the value of the stock when its holder is in the minority. \r\n  Dabney then explained that a \"minority discount\" usually is applied to offset \r\n  the lack of corporate control:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIf I'm valuing a thirty \r\n  percent (30%) [interest] in a corporation, I want to know who the shareholders \r\n  are and how they're aligned. And if they're not aligned, and they're all representing \r\n  their own independent interest[s], then that thirty percent (30%) interest in \r\n  that corporation is not worth thirty percent (30%) of the whole. It's worth \r\n  thirty percent of the whole times some minority discount for lack of control \r\n  . . . [or] direction of the corporation.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs a result, Dabney testified \r\n  the Dove stock would be worth more in Wife's hands than Husband's because Wife \r\n  could consolidate the 18% interest in Dove with her father's 82% interest to \r\n  achieve total family control of the corporation. Accordingly, in Wife's hands, \r\n  Dabney assigned a value to Dove of $415,710.(4) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDabney further concluded \r\n  Wife should receive the Dove stock because her father, as controlling shareholder, \r\n  could financially penalize Husband in a tax squeeze-out if the stock were awarded \r\n  to him.(5) In fact, the family court found that \r\n  Wife's father had subjected Husband to such a maneuver during the course of \r\n  the instant litigation in an attempt to gain control and complete ownership \r\n  of the companies in dispute. By again \"squeezing\" Husband in this manner, Wife's \r\n  father eventually could force Husband to sell his minority interest for less \r\n  than fair market value. Indeed, Wife's expert, Vondrak, testified he does it \r\n  \"all the time to depress my partner's stock so I can buy it cheaper.\" Finally, \r\n  even Vondrak assumed Husband \"would be an adversarial eighteen percent (18%) \r\n  holder for the rest of the term-for the rest of the life of the company.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWife claims the family court \r\n  erred in accepting Dabney's \"speculative\" opinions regarding the Dove stock \r\n  because there was no way to tell what her father would do in the future. The \r\n  record, however, clearly demonstrates several attempts by Wife's father to financially \r\n  penalize Husband, including firing him from his job, removing him as a director \r\n  of Dove, and giving himself the right of first refusal on any transfer of Dove \r\n  stock.(6) Moreover, the $415,710 value assigned \r\n  to the Dove stock by Dabney is identical to the value arrived at by Vondrak \r\n  using the \"Like Kind Sales\" method ($23,195 per share x 18 shares = $415,710). \r\n  Nonetheless, Wife asserts the court erred in employing Dabney's valuation of \r\n  Dove over that offered by Vondrak. The family court, of course, is free to choose \r\n  between competing valuations. See Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, \r\n  486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, \r\n  198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 406-07 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"In valuing marital assets, the \r\n  trial court is fully within its discretion to choose the valuations of one party \r\n  over those of the other party.\") (internal citation omitted)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn reaching its decision, \r\n  the family court engaged in a detailed examination and thorough analysis of \r\n  minority ownership as it relates to the control and marketability of corporate \r\n  stock. Both its finding that the Dove stock would be worth more in Wife's hands \r\n  and its conclusion that it should be awarded to Wife are well supported by the \r\n  record evidence. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the family court's \r\n  distribution of this asset.(7)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  Exclusion of Corporate Distributions from Marital Estate \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Wife contends the \r\n  family court erred in failing to include as marital assets corporate distributions \r\n  to Husband from LFI and Sparrow during the course of the marital litigation. \r\n  To the contrary, our review of the final order reveals the court in fact identified \r\n  and included these distributions in the equitable apportionment of the marital \r\n  estate. Indeed, the order below specifically addressed the issue:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[Wife] claims that certain \r\n  distributions from the corporations during these proceedings should be taken \r\n  into account in the equitable division. The Court has taken those distributions \r\n  into account as they were in the nature of income which [is] offset by payment \r\n  of taxes and other obligations, all of which have been considered by the Court. \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, this issue \r\n  is without merit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.(8) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, \r\n  JJ., concur.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1. \r\n We decide this case without \r\noral argument pursuant to Rules 215 and 220(b)(2), SCACR.  \r\n2.  The \r\n  remaining shareholders of these corporations are as follows:\r\nDove - Wife's father (82%)\r\nSparrow - Wife's father \r\n  (40%); Richard Vondrak (9%); Newton \r\n Burnette (9%); Byron Walker \r\n  (2%)\r\n\r\nLFI - $100,000 value placed \r\non Husband's 3% interest is undisputed \r\n3.  Wife's \r\n  expert, Richard Vondrak, was a 9% shareholder in Sparrow at the time of trial. \r\n  Although an experienced businessman, Vondrak had no experience testifying in \r\n  court as a business evaluator. On the other hand Husband's expert, Dennis Dabney, \r\n  was a CPA and certified valuation analyst with extensive experience valuing \r\n  closely-held corporations, often at the behest of the family court. \r\n4.  The \r\n  parties do not dispute the underlying financial data used to assess the value \r\n  of the stocks in question; Dabney, in fact, based his evaluation of each stock \r\n  on individual share prices assigned by Vondrak. \r\n5.  As \r\n  a \"sub-chapter S\"corporation, Dove's profits \"pass through\" to individual shareholders \r\n  as taxable income in amounts equal to their respective percentages of ownership. \r\n  However, these \"paper\" profits, which the shareholders must report as personal \r\n  income, are not necessarily accompanied by corresponding cash payouts from the \r\n  corporation. Since the decision to distribute profits rests solely with the \r\n  directors, a corporate board can refuse to authorize monetary distributions \r\n  to effectuate a \"tax squeeze-out.\" When this happens, the shareholder remains \r\n  personally liable for the applicable income tax, which he must then pay out \r\n  of pocket. \r\n6.  As \r\n  this Court previously has noted, \"[u]nfair treatment of holders of minority \r\n  interests in family companies and other closely held corporations by persons \r\n  in control of those corporations is so widespread that it is a national business \r\n  scandal.\" Davis v. Hamm, 300 S.C. 284, 293 n.6, 387 S.E.2d 676, 681 n.6 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1989) (citations omitted). \r\n7.  Wife \r\n  further asserts the family court could have avoided the valuation question entirely \r\n  by distributing the Dove stock \"in kind.\" Although in-kind apportionment is \r\n  often favored, it is not mandatory. To the contrary, in-kind distribution is \r\n  unwarranted where, as here, the nature of the parties' relationship to the asset \r\n  would make it inequitable. See \r\n \r\n\r\nDucate v. Ducate, 279 \r\nS.C. 246, 247, 306 S.E.2d 218, 219 (1983) (finding an abuse of discretion and \r\nreversing where court awarded wife four percent of husband's stock in closely-held \r\nfamily corporation in divorce proceedings because it \"would only allow the dissension \r\nand bitterness between the parties to spread to the corporation and would only \r\ngive wife something of questionable value\"); Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C. 344, \r\n440 S.E.2d 387 (Ct. App. 1994) (under circumstances where the marital home was \r\nsituated across the street from the husband's parents' home and the husband solely \r\noperated the family business, court found no abuse of discretion in the family \r\ncourt's decision not to effectuate an \"in kind\" distribution of the major marital \r\nassets); see also Johnson v. Johnson, 285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d \r\n443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985) (\"The family court's objective should be to dissolve \r\nthe marriage, sever all entangling legal relations and place the parties in a \r\nposition from which they can begin anew.\"). \r\n8.  Although \r\n  Wife includes an allegation of error in the court's allocation of marital assets \r\n  in her statement of issues on appeal, she fails to argue the issue in the body \r\n  of the brief and it is therefore deemed abandoned. See, e.g., First \r\n  Savings Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (issues not \r\n  argued in the brief are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal). \r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3226","title":"Hollar v.

Hollar (Father) and Hilaire M. Hollar (Mother). Mother appeals from several \r\n  aspects of the family court's order, including: (1) the court's finding Mother \r\n  could retain primary custody of the parties' child only if she moves from Charlotte, \r\n  North Carolina to Charleston, South Carolina; (2) the court's failure to increase \r\n  Father's child support obligation in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines; \r\n  (3) the court's failure to require Father to pay more than 50% of the guardian \r\n  ad litem's fee; (4) the court's failure to award Mother attorney fees; and (5) \r\n  the court's conditional requirement that Mother reimburse Father for temporary \r\n  attorney fees and costs he paid during the pendency of litigation. Father appeals \r\n  from the court's failure to award him sole custody of the child and challenges \r\n  the court's award of guardian ad litem fees. We affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and modify. \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFather and Mother married \r\n  in January 1988. They have one child, Laura, born on February 8, 1989. The parties \r\n  were living in Charleston, South Carolina when they separated in January 1994. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nMother moved to Charlotte, \r\n  North Carolina in April 1994. The parties agreed for Laura to continue to reside \r\n  with Father in Charleston for the balance of the school year and to stay with \r\n  Father throughout the summer. In August 1994, Laura moved to Charlotte with \r\n  Mother. Father acquiesced in the move. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe parties entered into \r\n  a settlement agreement on August 28, 1995. The agreement provided, inter \r\n  alia, that the parties would share \"joint legal custody\" of Laura, with \r\n  Mother exercising primary physical custody. The agreement did not specifically \r\n  set forth a regular visitation schedule, with the exception of the following \r\n  provision: \"The minor child shall reside with the mother during the school year \r\n  and for the month of July each year, and the minor child will reside with the \r\n  Father each year from the time school is out until June 30, and for the month \r\n  of August. The Parent with whom the minor child is NOT residing shall have the \r\n  right to have the Child with him/her two to three weekends during the months \r\n  that the minor child is residing with the other party.\" The agreement further \r\n  provided Father would pay mother child support of $590.00 per month in accordance \r\n  with the Child Support Guidelines. The parties were divorced by order of the \r\n  family court approving and adopting the settlement agreement dated September \r\n  9, 1995. \r\n   \r\nIn January 1996, Father \r\n  petitioned the family court for a rule to show cause why the mother should not \r\n  be held in contempt for making disparaging remarks about him in Laura's presence \r\n  and for interfering with his visitation with the child. The family court issued \r\n  a rule to show cause and held a hearing. By order dated April 6, 1996, the court \r\n  found the evidence did not support a finding of contempt. However, with the \r\n  consent of the parties, the court amended the visitation schedule to provide \r\n  Father with visitation every other weekend.\r\n \r\nFather married Cindy Swan \r\n  (Stepmother) in April 1996. They reside in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with \r\n  Stepmother's two minor children from a previous marriage.  \r\n   \r\nFather initiated this action \r\n  against Mother in February of 1997, seeking sole custody of the child based \r\n  on changed circumstances, child support, appointment of a guardian ad litem, \r\n  counseling for the child, and attorney fees and costs. To support his allegation \r\n  of changed circumstances, Father alleged that since the original custody order, \r\n  Mother had interfered with his physical and telephone visitation with the child, \r\n  and left the child in a vehicle without supervision during business meetings. \r\n  Father also asserted he could offer the child a more stable home due to his \r\n  remarriage. Mother answered and counterclaimed, denying the father was entitled \r\n  to a change of custody, and seeking, inter alia, an increase in child \r\n  support and attorney fees and costs. On March 11, 1997, the family court issued \r\n  a temporary order continuing custody with Mother.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn September 5, 1997, Father \r\n  filed a supplemental complaint and motion seeking an emergency change in custody. \r\n  In support of the motion, he alleged Mother had appeared at the home of Dr. \r\n  Hollis Tidmore, a former boyfriend, with a pistol, had cut his telephone lines, \r\n  and had engaged in other bizarre behavior. In a letter to the court, the guardian \r\n  ad litem stated that based on information available to her at that time, she \r\n  believed the change of custody should be granted.  The family \r\n  court issued an ex parte order granting the father temporary emergency custody \r\n  and scheduling a hearing on the matter. After the September 9, 1997 hearing \r\n  on the matter, the court issued an order granting temporary emergency custody \r\n  to the paternal grandmother in Charlotte. Three days thereafter, the court returned \r\n  custody to Mother, finding no clear evidence that the child was at risk with \r\n  Mother.  The court subsequently awarded Mother $4267.50 in \r\n  temporary attorney fees and costs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe final hearing was held \r\n  over the course of seven days in November and December 1997 and January 1998. \r\n  Prior to trial, Mother's counsel moved to limit the introduction of evidence \r\n  and testimony to events occurring after the parties' divorce decree and order \r\n  approving their custody agreement. The court declined to grant the motion, electing \r\n  to make rulings on the introduction of evidence \"on a case by case basis.\" \r\n   Ultimately, despite periodic objections by Mother's counsel, both \r\n  parties introduced an abundance of evidence relating to events which predated \r\n  not only the divorce, but in numerous instances the marriage itself. While much \r\n  of this evidence may have been relevant in a de novo custody hearing, \r\n  the issue before the court in this case was whether a substantial change of \r\n  circumstances occurred after the date of the divorce decree which warranted \r\n  a change of custody. The record on appeal is voluminous and contains much testimony \r\n  which is irrelevant to this action for a change in custody. Accordingly, we \r\n  have limited our consideration to evidence relating to events occurring after \r\n  the parties' divorce. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDr. James Allen Linderman \r\n  began dating Mother in December 1994. They continued to date until April 1996. \r\n  Linderman and Mother admitted that on one occasion, Linderman spent the night \r\n  in the mother's home while the child was present. On that occasion, the child \r\n  woke up in the night and came to Mother's bedroom door, which was closed. Mother \r\n  heard the child approaching, arose, and took the child back to her own bedroom. \r\n  The child did not see Linderman. After Mother put the child back to bed, Linderman \r\n  dressed and left the home.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMother began dating Dr. \r\n  Hollis Tidmore in July 1996. In deposition, Tidmore testified he terminated \r\n  his relationship with Mother in October of 1996, based in part on information \r\n  he gleaned from conversations with Father and the pastor of the church in Charlotte \r\n  he and Mother attended.(1) She thereafter began \r\n  exhibiting bizarre behavior towards him. According to Tidmore, Mother followed \r\n  him out of church, appeared uninvited at his home and at the hospital where \r\n  he worked, cut his telephone lines at his home, and appeared at his home on \r\n  one occasion carrying a pistol. Mother denied committing the alleged acts of \r\n  harassment. \r\n   \r\nFather introduced evidence \r\n  regarding Mother's work history. After moving to Charlotte, Mother was employed \r\n  at four different jobs. At the time of trial, she had been employed at Sanger \r\n  Clinic for approximately one year. Mother testified she enjoys her work at Sanger \r\n  and plans to remain employed there.  Moreover, her supervisor \r\n  at Sanger testified that she was a fine employee and the only problems with \r\n  her performance have stemmed from the custody case.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n By order dated May 11, \r\n  1998, the family court awarded sole custody of the child to Father, provided, \r\n  however, that Mother could elect to retain joint custody if she chose to relocate \r\n  to Charleston, South Carolina.(2) In so finding, \r\n  the court reasoned that the primary change in circumstance was that the child \r\n  was being negatively affected by the circumstances of the visitation arrangements. \r\n  Specifically, the court found Mother had interfered with Father's visitation \r\n  with Laura, the child does not like to travel, and the distance between her \r\n  and Father is not \"absolutely necessary.\" The court also expressed concern over \r\n  Mother's job history and her judgment in allowing Linderman to spend the night \r\n  in her home while the child was present. The court found that, although the \r\n  child did not see Linderman on that occasion, \"the mother's judgment with regard \r\n  to Dr. Linderman could have harmed the child emotionally if she had seen the \r\n  mother in bed with her pediatrician.\" The court all but dismissed the allegations \r\n  concerning Tidmore, finding only that while the relationship unquestionably \r\n  ended on poor terms, Mother was not at fault for this outcome. The court also \r\n  found that Mother has no support system in Charlotte. The court ordered each \r\n  party to pay his or her own attorney fees, with Mother to reimburse Father for \r\n  $4267.50 in temporary fees paid during the pendency of litigation. As well, \r\n  the court ordered each of the parties to pay an equal portion of the guardian \r\n  ad litem's fee of $21,557.45.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nBoth Mother and Father filed \r\n  post-trial motions for reconsideration. With the exception \r\n  of allowing certain documentary evidence to be introduced into the record, and \r\n  requiring the mother to repay the father for temporary fees only if she elected \r\n  not to move to Charleston, the family court denied both motions. Thereafter, \r\n  the mother petitioned the family court for supersedeas, which the court denied. \r\n  This court granted Mother a supersedeas on August 5, 1998.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn appeals from the family \r\n  court, this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its \r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. \r\n  543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996). This broad scope of review does \r\n  not, however, require this court to disregard the findings of the family court. \r\n  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981). \r\n  Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and \r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Cherry v. Thomasson, \r\n  276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  Custody(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\nOn appeal, Mother asserts \r\n  the family court erred in finding a substantial change of circumstances sufficient \r\n  to warrant a change of custody, whether or not the change was made conditional \r\n  upon Mother's decision regarding relocation to Charleston. Father contends that \r\n  he should have sole custody regardless of Mother's location. We agree with Mother \r\n  that there has been no substantial change of circumstances warranting a change \r\n  in custody. \r\n   \r\nIn all child custody controversies, \r\n  the controlling considerations are the child's welfare and best interests. Cook \r\n  v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978). In reaching a determination \r\n  as to custody, the family court should consider how the custody decision will \r\n  impact all areas of the child's life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, \r\n  educational, familial, emotional, and recreational aspects. Pountain v. Pountain, \r\n  332 S .C. 130, 136, 503 S.E.2d 757, 760 (Ct. App. 1998). Additionally, the court \r\n  must assess each party's character, fitness, and attitude as they affect the \r\n  child. Id. at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760. Indeed, \"the totality of circumstances \r\n  peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision \r\n  can be weighed.\" Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d \r\n  228, 230 (1975). In order for a court to grant a change of custody based on \r\n  changed circumstances, the party seeking the change must meet the burden of \r\n  showing changed circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the order \r\n  in question. Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 602, 510 S.E.2d 722, \r\n  725 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied June 24, 1999; Baer v. Baer, \r\n  282 S.C. 362, 365, 318 S.E.2d 582, 583 (Ct. App. 1984). \"A change in circumstances \r\n  justifying a change in the custody of a child simply means that sufficient facts \r\n  have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the child \r\n  will be served by the change.\" Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 523, 252 \r\n  S.E.2d 891, 892-93 (1979).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn finding changed circumstances, \r\n  the family court focused primarily on problems with visitation, Mother's judgment \r\n  with respect to Linderman, Mother's job history, and Mother's lack of a support \r\n  system in Charlotte.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\nA. \r\n  Mother's Interference with Visitation \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn our view, the record \r\n  simply does not demonstrate interference by Mother with Father's visitation \r\n  sufficient to establish changed circumstances. The evidence presented indicates \r\n  both parties share in the blame with regard to visitation and exchange problems. \r\n  Each party has interfered with the other's access to the child at one time or \r\n  another. Tellingly, Father has filed only one rule to show cause alleging such \r\n  interference since the original decree. Moreover, the custody evaluator, Dr. \r\n  Ronald Prinz, did not find Mother's interference substantial, nor did he find \r\n  any damage to the relationship between Father and Laura as a result of actions \r\n  by Mother. Prinz found both Mother and Father hostile, but did not find either \r\n  demonstrably more hostile than the other. Finally, the guardian ad litem testified \r\n  that she thought Father would be less flexible regarding visitation with Mother \r\n  if he had custody of Laura. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Allison v. Eudy, \r\n  330 S.C. 427, 499 S.E.2d 227 (Ct. App. 1998), this court reversed a family court's \r\n  finding of changed circumstances based on a father's interference with visitation \r\n  by the mother. 330 S.C. at 429-30, 499 S.E.2d at 228-29. In doing so, we relied \r\n  on the fact that the interference in that case did not adversely affect the \r\n  child or amount to a \"flagrant disregard of the prior order.\" 330 S.C. at 430, \r\n  499 S.E.2d at 229. In this case, there is likewise no showing of adverse effects \r\n  on the child due to any interference. Furthermore, on the one occasion Father \r\n  filed a rule to show cause, the family court did not find Mother's action amounted \r\n  to contempt. As in Allison, we do not find the alleged interference in \r\n  this case sufficient to warrant a change in custody.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. \r\n  Negative Impacts of Travel on Child \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe record indicates Laura \r\n  does not enjoy traveling for visitation with Father. Our reading of the testimony \r\n  convinces us that any problems the child may be experiencing in this regard \r\n  stem mainly from stress, not the actual distance between the parents' homes. \r\n  According to both the custody evaluator, Prinz, and Laura's physician, the child \r\n  experiences stomach aches during visitation exchanges and during school tests. \r\n  Prinz opined that both parents contributed in their own ways to Laura's stomach \r\n  problems. Additionally, the guardian testified she did not think it was a good \r\n  idea for Laura to move to Charleston, and she did not think living with Father \r\n  would be a palliative for the problem. Laura's well-being, as evidenced by her \r\n  \"stomach problems,\" causes this court great concern. However, we do not believe \r\n  the evidence establishes that Mother's behavior is the primary impetus for these \r\n  problems. Moreover, the evidence shows that Laura's stomach problems escalated \r\n  when Father filed this action for change of custody. Although it is impossible \r\n  to shield the child from any and all stress factors, both parents bear some \r\n  responsibility for exposing the child to the tensions between them. We entreat \r\n  the parents to strive for greater cooperation and congeniality in dealing with \r\n  visitation issues and exchanges. A cooperative effort between the parents to \r\n  refrain from exhibiting hostility towards each other would help to alleviate \r\n  the child's discomfort.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMoreover, no change of circumstances \r\n  can be established simply through reference to difficulties in visitation caused \r\n  by the distance between Father's home and Mother's home, since the parties agreed \r\n  to joint custody with primary custody being with Mother after the Mother's move \r\n  to Charlotte. See Henggeler, 333 S.C. at 602, 510 S.E.2d at \r\n  725 (stating that circumstances warranting a change in custody must occur after \r\n  the date of the original custody order).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. \r\n  Mother's Employment History \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs to Mother's employment \r\n  history, we note that while Mother has held a number of employment positions \r\n  since moving to Charlotte, there is no evidence she has undergone extended periods \r\n  of unemployment.  At the time of trial, Mother had been employed \r\n  as an insurance claims processor at Sanger Cardiology Clinic for one year. Mother's \r\n  supervisor testified Mother performs her work satisfactorily and the only problems \r\n  she has experienced thus far have related to this custody action.  \r\n  Mother testified she enjoys her work and plans to remain employed at the company.(5) \r\n   The record demonstrates Mother's consistent employment, and there \r\n  is no indication that she has not provided adequately for Laura at all times. \r\n  Moreover, there is no evidence that Mother's changes in employment have impacted \r\n  negatively on Laura. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\nD. \r\n  Mother's Lack of a Support System in Charlotte  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile the family court found \r\n  Mother lacks a support system in Charlotte, we do not believe that moving to \r\n  Charleston would provide her with a better support system. Mother has no family \r\n  in Charleston. In Charlotte, Mother enjoys the support and companionship of \r\n  various friends and associates from her church and neighborhood. She has established \r\n  relationships at her place of employment and is familiar with the child's teacher \r\n  and pediatrician.  As well, the paternal grandmother and other \r\n  members of Father's family live in Charlotte, where Mother currently resides. \r\n  Although Mother's relationship with the paternal grandmother has become strained \r\n  due to these proceedings, the paternal grandmother testified she and Mother \r\n  were close in the past and that the she stills loves Mother. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe are not persuaded the \r\n  Mother could establish a better support system by moving to Charleston and being \r\n  in closer proximity to Father and Stepmother. Mother's relationship with Father \r\n  and Stepmother has become progressively more troubled. In an effort to gain \r\n  custody of the child, Father and Stepmother have involved not only their own \r\n  minister, but Mother's minister in Charlotte as well. As a result of conversations \r\n  with Father's minister, Mother's minister advised Tidmore to terminate his relationship \r\n  with Mother. Father also had numerous conversations with Tidmore regarding Mother's \r\n  behavior during the marriage.  In addition, Father and Stepmother \r\n  have called North Carolina's social services department on at least two occasions \r\n  to make unsubstantiated allegations of abuse against Mother. It is difficult \r\n  to conceive how placing Mother and Father in the same community will be beneficial \r\n  to anyone's interests. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nE. \r\n  Linderman Incident \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court questioned \r\n  Mother's judgment in allowing Linderman to spend the night on one occasion. \r\n  It is undisputed, however, that the child did not know Linderman was present. \r\n  The family court merely found that Laura could have been emotionally harmed \r\n  if she had seen Linderman and Mother in bed together. While Mother clearly suffered \r\n  a lapse in judgment in allowing Linderman into her bed while the child was in \r\n  the home, the record is devoid of evidence of any impact on the child whatsoever. \r\n  We recognize that the burden of proving changed circumstances does not necessarily \r\n  require the moving party to show an existing physical or emotional injury to \r\n  the child. See Routh v. Routh, 328 S.C. 512, 520, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  415, 419 (Ct. App. 1997). Were there evidence of repeated lapses of judgment \r\n  in this regard on Mother's part, the potential impact on the child's welfare \r\n  may be of concern. However, we are not persuaded this isolated incident is sufficient \r\n  to warrant a change in custody. See Dent v. Dent, 273 S.C. 387, \r\n  390, 256 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1979) (finding sexual relationship of wife with at \r\n  least one other man subsequent to divorce an isolated occurrence and insufficient \r\n  moral laxity to affect the welfare of the children such as to warrant a change \r\n  in custody); cf. Clear v. Clear, 331 S.C. 186,191-92, 500 S.E.2d \r\n  790, 792 (Ct. App. 1998)(\"[T]he effect which a parent's morality may have on \r\n  his or her fitness to have custody is limited to what relevancy it has, either \r\n  directly or indirectly, to the welfare of the child. Moreover, custody is not \r\n  to be used to penalize or reward a parent for his or her conduct.\") (citations \r\n  omitted). \r\n   \r\nIn our view, the record \r\n  simply does not establish a change of circumstances occurring since the entry \r\n  of the parties' divorce decree which would justify a change of custody to the \r\n  father. Neither the custody evaluator nor the guardian ad litem found a change \r\n  of circumstances. The record does not establish that either a change of custody \r\n  or relocation to Charleston would be in the best interest of the child. This \r\n  is particularly true given that the child has resided with Mother in Charlotte \r\n  for the past six years and appears to be well adjusted, closely bonded to Mother, \r\n  and excelling in school and extracurricular activities.(6) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  Child Support \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe mother also asserts \r\n  the court erred in failing to grant her an increase in child support in accordance \r\n  with the Child Support Guidelines. Although the family court's decision on this \r\n  issue was no doubt affected by her determination of the custody issue, we also \r\n  decline to increase Father's current child support payment. Father has fairly \r\n  extensive visitation with the child, and bears a greater burden of the travel \r\n  expense related to that visitation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  Fees and Costs \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. \r\n  Attorney Fees and Costs \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNext, Mother argues the \r\n  family court erred in failing to award her attorney fees and costs. Mother also \r\n  argues she should not have to reimburse Father for temporary attorney fees and \r\n  costs awarded during the pendency of the litigation. We agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decision whether to \r\n  award attorney fees is within the sound discretion of the family court, the \r\n  exercise of which will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse. Stevenson \r\n  v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988). In awarding \r\n  attorney fees, the court should consider the parties' ability to pay their own \r\n  fee, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the parties' respective \r\n  financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each party's standard of \r\n  living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). \r\n  In determining the amount of attorney fees to award, the court should consider \r\n  the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily \r\n  devoted to the case, counsel's professional standing, the contingency of compensation, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. \r\n  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n Consistent with our decision \r\n  to continue custody with Mother, the application of the above factors warrant \r\n  an award of attorney fees to Mother. Moreover, we will not require Mother to \r\n  reimburse Father the total amount of temporary fees awarded during the litigation. \r\n  Mother incurred $36,053.18 in attorney fees and costs, an amount considerably \r\n  less than the $118,588.75 in attorney fees and costs incurred by the father. \r\n  The trial of this action was unnecessarily lengthened when Father persisted, \r\n  over Mother's objection, in introducing substantial evidence which predated \r\n  the original custody decree. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, \r\n  particularly the mother's successful appeal of the action and the father's superior \r\n  income,(7) we find an award to Mother of fifty \r\n  percent (50%) of her attorney fees is warranted. Father is therefore ordered \r\n  to pay Mother $15,892.84 for fees and costs incurred in connection with this \r\n  litigation. This figure represents fifty percent of $36,053.18 minus fifty percent \r\n  of the $4267.50 in temporary fees which the family court ordered Mother to reimburse. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nB. \r\n  Guardian Ad Litem Fees and Costs \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMother next argues the court \r\n  erred in failing to order Father to pay a pro rata share, rather than an equal \r\n  share, of the guardian ad litem's fees and costs. Father, on the other hand, \r\n  asserts the fees were excessive.(8)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn award of guardian ad \r\n  litem fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not \r\n  be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Nash v. Byrd, 298 \r\n  S.C. 530, 537, 381 S.E.2d 913, 917 (Ct. App. 1989). The same equitable considerations \r\n  which apply to attorney fees also apply to costs. Garris v. McDuffie, \r\n  288 S.C. 637, 644, 344 S.E.2d 186, 191 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe reject Father's contention \r\n  the guardian's fees were excessive. The guardian spent in excess of 230 hours \r\n  performing her duties in connection with this litigation. This is not an excessive \r\n  amount of time considering the ongoing conflict between the parties, travel \r\n  time, and the numerous witnesses involved in the seven day trial of this case. \r\n  Additionally, we do not find the guardian's $100 per hour fee excessive, particularly \r\n  in light of the guardian's professional standing and the attorney fees incurred \r\n  by the parties to this litigation.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause we feel both parties \r\n  share the blame for the guardian's time and effort expended in this case, we \r\n  decline to alter the family court's fifty-fifty allocation of the burden of \r\n  paying the guardian's fee.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the decision of the family court is \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, \r\n  REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON and HUFF, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1.  The \r\n  pastor of father's church in Mt. Pleasant, Mother's former church, after consultation \r\n  with Father and Stepmother, phoned the pastor of the church in Charlotte that \r\n  Tidmore and Mother attended to inform the pastor that Mother had engaged in \r\n  certain immoral behavior while a member of the church in Mt. Pleasant. The pastor \r\n  in Charlotte related these allegations to Tidmore. \r\n \r\n2.  We \r\n  note the family court sent two sets of \"instructions\" to the parties before \r\n  rendering the final order. The first set of instructions found there was no \r\n  change of circumstances and left custody with Mother. After correspondence with \r\n  the parties, however, the family court issued a second set of instructions which \r\n  were ultimately reflected in the final order. \r\n \r\n3.  For \r\n  simplicity, we combine Mother's various arguments regarding the custody issue \r\n  into a single discussion. Additionally, we necessarily deal with Father's appeal \r\n  of the custody issue at this juncture. \r\n \r\n4.  Father \r\n  points to other evidence which he contends proves a change in custody is warranted. \r\n  However, the events pointed to by Father were either given little merit by the \r\n  family court in reaching its decision or were events which took place before \r\n  the original decree and are thus irrelevant to a change of circumstances determination. \r\n  Moreover, taking our own view of the evidence, we do not find the events clearly \r\n  established by the evidence presented to the family court. \r\n5.  At \r\n  oral argument, Mother's counsel indicated Mother remains employed at Sanger. \r\n  \r\n6. Laura's \r\n  report cards and \"Daily Reading Record\" from her school in Charlotte establish \r\n  that she is doing very well academically. Additionally, Laura enjoys playing \r\n  soccer and singing. \r\n7. \r\n Father earns $5166 per month. \r\nMother earns $1820 per month. \r\n8.  At \r\n  the close of the trial, the family court asked how the parties wished to proceed \r\n  on determining the guardian's fees. Father's counsel responded: \"Well, she just \r\n  needs to submit a statement. I don't think any of us here are going to question \r\n  the -- her hours or rate. I haven't seen it, I -- but I -- generally, the lawyers \r\n  we work with, I think, we submit truthful statements.\" In his motion for reconsideration, \r\n  however, Father argued that the guardian's fee of $100 per hour was excessive. \r\n  In brief and at oral argument before this court, Father's counsel made additional \r\n  arguments about the guardian ad litem system, including the use of attorney \r\n  guardians. While this court appreciates his concerns, these arguments were not \r\n  raised to the family court and are therefore not within our purview. See \r\n  McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 497, 511 S.E.2d 365, 368-69 (1999). \r\n  Moreover, Father's prior counsel and Wife's counsel did not object to the appointment \r\n  of the guardian in this case. Thus, Father cannot be heard to challenge the \r\n  selection of an attorney guardian in this case. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3227","title":"Waterpointe I Property Owner's Association, Inc. v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis action arises from \r\n  a contract whereby Paragon, Inc. agreed to manage Waterpointe I Horizontal Property \r\n  Regime, a high-rise condominium in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In December \r\n  1988, Bob Johnston of Paragon presented Waterpointe's Board of Directors with \r\n  a copy of Paragon's proposal. The proposal stated inter alia: \"Included \r\n  in Paragon's routine services will be the supervision of all personnel, subcontractors, \r\n  contract negotiation, insurance coverage coordination and purchase and other \r\n  routine functions required in the day to day operation of the Association.\" \r\n  After reviewing the proposal, the Board voted that same day to accept Paragon \r\n  as its new management company. Two Board members, Isidore Melekos and Patricia \r\n  Wilkie, subsequently negotiated a contract with Paragon. Paragon assumed management \r\n  of Waterpointe on January 1, 1989.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the April 15, 1989 Board \r\n  meeting, Johnston requested budget amendments for certain improvements and repairs. \r\n  The Board voted not to amend the budget and advised Johnston to abide by the \r\n  December 1988 budget he had helped develop. The budget is derived from homeowner \r\n  assessments, interest income and vending proceeds.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn August 1989 the Board \r\n  discovered Johnston was overspending the budget. The very next month, Hurricane \r\n  Hugo hit Myrtle Beach. Melekos testified he went to Waterpointe the day after \r\n  Hugo and discovered Johnston had not taken action to protect Waterpointe from \r\n  the storm. The electricity was still on. Both elevators were on the ground floor \r\n  flooded with seawater and covered with sand. The ground floor, fence and gates, \r\n  lattice work, decking, pool and pool furniture, carpet, and lobby were destroyed \r\n  or heavily damaged.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Board was not able to \r\n  meet again until October. At its October meeting, the Board learned it had some \r\n  accounts receivable and only a few hundred dollars in the Waterpointe account. \r\n  Additionally, the Board discovered Johnston had spent the previous year's reserve \r\n  of $45,000.00. Moreover, Johnston informed the Board that Waterpointe did not \r\n  have flood insurance to cover much of Hugo's damage. This was the first time \r\n  the Board learned there was no flood insurance in place.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Board fired Paragon \r\n  in November and hired a CPA firm to undertake an audit of the way Paragon had \r\n  spent Waterpointe's money. On August 13, 1991, Waterpointe initiated this action \r\n  against Paragon alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract \r\n  and failure to renew insurance. Waterpointe sought damages of $25,490.00 on \r\n  the breach of contract action and actual damages of $126,000.00 on the failure \r\n  to renew insurance cause of action. Several causes of action were subsequently \r\n  dismissed via motions by Paragon.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe case was heard by a \r\n  master-in-equity on July 22 and 23, 1996. Paragon moved for a directed verdict \r\n  at the close of Waterpointe's case. The master declined to rule on the motion \r\n  initially, and Paragon declined to put up any evidence. The master ultimately \r\n  rendered judgment in favor of Waterpointe for $25,490.00 on the breach of contract \r\n  cause of action, and $79,703.86 for failing to renew the flood insurance. Paragon \r\n  appeals the master's denial of its motion for directed verdict and the master's \r\n  failure to enter judgment in its favor.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\n  Scope of Review \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe note initially that while \r\n  Paragon's motion at the close of the evidence was couched as a \"directed verdict\" \r\n  motion, governed by Rule 50, SCRCP, this was a non-jury action. As Rule 50 by \r\n  its nature is applicable to jury trials, the proper motion for Paragon to have \r\n  made was a motion for involuntary non-suit under Rule 41, SCRCP. \"After the \r\n  plaintiff in an action tried by the court without a jury has completed the presentation \r\n  of his evidence, the defendant, . . . may move for a dismissal on the ground \r\n  that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\" \r\n  Rule 41(b), SCRCP; see Ducworth v. Neely, 319 S.C. 158, 159 \r\n  n.1, 459 S.E.2d 896, 897 n.1 (Ct. App. 1995) (noting that motion styled directed \r\n  verdict in non-jury action actually was a motion for involuntary non-suit under \r\n  Rule 41(b), SCRCP, and therefore reviewing as such). Rule 41(b) allows the judge \r\n  as fact finder to weigh the evidence and determine the facts. Johnston v. \r\n  J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., 308 S.C. 116, 118, 417 S.E. 2d 527, 529 (1992). \r\n  Therefore, Paragon's appeal is from the master's factual findings as a judge \r\n  in a non-jury action at law. See South Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. \r\n  Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 310 S.C. 232, 235, 423 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1992) \r\n  (stating an action seeking money damages for breach of contract is an action \r\n  at law); Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997) (same). \"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a \r\n  jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless \r\n  found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings.\" \r\n  Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976). Thus, this court must affirm if there is any evidence to support \r\n  the master's findings. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFailure \r\n  to Renew Insurance \r\n  \r\n   \r\nParagon first contends the \r\n  master erred in failing to enter judgment or to grant a directed verdict in \r\n  its favor on the failure to renew insurance cause of action. Paragon's argument \r\n  is premised on the ground the failure to renew cause of action sounds in tort \r\n  rather than in contract. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaterpointe's complaint \r\n  provides in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n14. That the Defendant had \r\n  a duty to care for, preserve and maintain the property of the Association and \r\n  to insure that proper insurance coverages were in place to care for and preserve \r\n  the property. That the contract, under Paragraph 3(b)(4) specifically allocates \r\n  certain responsibilities concerning insurance coverage placements and renewals \r\n  to the Manager, and the Board of Directors further, and specifically, allocated, \r\n  directed and requested the Manager to undertake the placement of insurance coverages \r\n  and the renewals of those that were so necessary. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n15. That the defendant did \r\n  undertake the responsibilities and obligations for the placement and renewal \r\n  of all insurance coverages at the Association through the course of its ongoing \r\n  Contract. \r\n   \r\n16. That the Defendant did \r\n  fail to renew the underlying flood insurance coverage on the property of the \r\n  Association for the year 1989, and as a result, when Hurricane Hugo struck the \r\n  coast of South Carolina in September of 1989, the Association was without proper \r\n  underlying flood insurance coverage. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n17. That there was extensive \r\n  damage to property of the Association as a result of Hurricane Hugo, the damage \r\n  to said property being in excess of One Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand and No/100s \r\n  ($126,000.00) Dollars of insurable interest in the property of the Association. \r\n  That as a direct result of the breach of Contract of the Manager and breach \r\n  of direct instructions and directions from the Board of Directors, the Association \r\n  has been damaged by the lack of flood insurance coverage for those insurable \r\n  items that would have been covered under such underlying Flood Insurance Policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(emphasis added). The last \r\n  line of the above paragraph of the complaint reveals it is an action in contract \r\n  rather than tort. Clearly there is a breach of duty alleged; however, that duty \r\n  arose solely from the contract. Thus, we hold the premise for Paragon's argument \r\n  - that the action is one in tort - is without merit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nParagon further claims even \r\n  if the action is one in contract, the contract is the complete agreement between \r\n  the parties and there is no evidence in the record Paragon owed a contractual \r\n  duty to Waterpointe to obtain flood insurance. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe record reveals Paragon's \r\n  management proposal listed the purchase and coordination of insurance coverage \r\n  as part of the Manager's \"routine service.\" The contract between Waterpointe \r\n  and Paragon allowed Waterpointe to delegate the duty to obtain insurance to \r\n  Johnston. The applicable contract provision stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n4. The MANAGER [Johnston] \r\n  has the right, but not the duty, to make recommendations to the Board of Directors \r\n  as to the form or forms of insurance needed to protect [Waterpointe], and which \r\n  may be required to comply with the provisions of the Condominium Documents. \r\n  The MANAGER shall assist the Board in acquiring insurance policies for [Waterpointe] \r\n  as outlined in the Condominium Documents. [Waterpointe] may delegate to the \r\n  MANAGER its sole and exclusive authority to obtain bids for, contract to purchase \r\n  and actually purchase such insurance for [Waterpointe] as the MANAGER in its \r\n  sole discretion shall deem advisable and in the best interests of [Waterpointe]. \r\n  In such event, the MANAGER shall solicit and actually receive bids for such \r\n  insurance, except in the event of an emergency requiring immediate coverage. \r\n  [Waterpointe] agrees to add MANAGER to any and all liability insurance policies \r\n  as a named insured. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe contract does not contain \r\n  a merger clause indicating it is the complete agreement between the parties. \r\n  Patricia Wilkie, President of the Board of Directors in 1988 and 1989, testified \r\n  Johnston was placed in charge of all of Waterpointe's affairs and she believed \r\n  the Board delegated the responsibility for the purchase and placement of insurance \r\n  to Johnston and Paragon. Furthermore, Johnston sent Wilkie a letter dated July \r\n  13, 1989 advising her of Waterpointe's insurance coverage. The letter stated: \r\n  \"Insurance was renewed on 5/17/89 consistent with last year's coverage. Nationwide \r\n  was the lowest bidder in light of the coverage required. A summary of the Insurance \r\n  is attached. We bound this coverage and we will leave it as is unless we here \r\n  (sic) from you to the contrary.\" The enclosed attachment from Nationwide Insurance \r\n  indicated Waterpointe's basic flood insurance was with another agent. The fact \r\n  that Johnston obtained and purchased insurance for Waterpointe other than flood \r\n  insurance suggests the Board also delegated its responsibility to obtain flood \r\n  insurance coverage to Johnston. Clearly there is evidence Johnston and Paragon \r\n  had the duty to renew Waterpointe's flood insurance. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDamages \r\n  \r\n   \r\nParagon further asserts \r\n  the Association did not present evidence it suffered damage that would have \r\n  been covered by flood insurance. Paragon contends the damage to the ground floor \r\n  at Waterpointe would not have been covered by basic flood insurance even had \r\n  such insurance been in place at the time of the hurricane. In support of its \r\n  argument Paragon points to a standard flood insurance policy included in the \r\n  record. According to Paragon, the policy \"excludes spas, pools, decking, as \r\n  well as areas of a building below the second floor.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNotwithstanding Paragon's \r\n  assertion, an examination of the basic flood policy indicates it does provide \r\n  coverage for air conditioners, elevators and other relevant equipment installed \r\n  prior to October 1, 1987, as well as coverage for debris removal. Waterpointe \r\n  was developed in 1983 and 1984. Patricia Wilkie was President of the Board as \r\n  early as 1984, so Waterpointe was presumably completed by or in 1984. Moreover, \r\n  plaintiff's exhibit 11, introduced at trial and included in the record, lists \r\n  numerous damages that clearly would have been covered by the basic flood policy. \r\n  The master excluded certain damages contained in the exhibit presumably because \r\n  he found they would not be covered under the policy. However, the master found \r\n  some of the itemized damages plainly covered under the basic flood policy. The \r\n  allowable items of damage in exhibit 11 exceed the total amount of the master's \r\n  verdict. Therefore, we cannot say the record is without evidentiary support \r\n  for his findings. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBreach \r\n  of Contract \r\n  \r\n   \r\nParagon lastly argues the \r\n  master erred in declining to direct a verdict or enter judgment in its favor \r\n  on Waterpointe's cause of action for breach of contract. Paragon asserts Waterpointe \r\n  failed to present evidence it incurred any damage from Johnston's overspending \r\n  of Waterpointe's budget and depletion of reserves. Paragon's argument turns \r\n  on the fact that all of the money Johnston spent without authorization was spent \r\n  on Waterpointe, therefore Waterpointe suffered no net loss. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe contract between Paragon \r\n  and Waterpointe explicitly required Board approval for any expenditure over \r\n  $1,000.00. Johnston not only overspent the budget he actively assisted in preparing, \r\n  but also spent the reserve account without informing the Board or obtaining \r\n  approval. Johnston's actions were a clear breach of the contract. Waterpointe \r\n  had the right to determine how, when, and what large expenditures were made. \r\n  Johnston's actions deprived them of the right to prioritize and select large \r\n  expenditures. As a result of Johnston's actions, Waterpointe was low on cash \r\n  in October 1989 and without reserves to draw on to pay for repairs necessitated \r\n  by Hugo. This is sufficient evidence of damage to uphold the master's findings \r\n  on this cause of action. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing \r\n  reasons, the judgment of the master is hereby \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON and HUFF, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3228","title":"S.C.

South Carolina \r\n  Farm Bureau appeals. We affirm.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nIn the summer of 1997, William \r\n  Courtney owned two automobiles, a 1997 Saturn and a 1995 Chevrolet Camaro. Farm \r\n  Bureau insured both vehicles in separate policies. Each policy contained personal \r\n  liability and underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) in limits of $100,000 per \r\n  person and $300,000 per occurrence with property damage limits of $25,000 per \r\n  accident (100/300/25). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn September 1997, the Camaro, \r\n  driven by Courtney's wife Susan, was involved in an accident. Farm Bureau declared \r\n  the car a total loss and tendered payment under the vehicle's collision coverage. \r\n  Although the Camaro's insurance policy was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. on October \r\n  4, Farm Bureau never issued Courtney a notice of cancellation or refunded any \r\n  unearned premiums. On October 4, using the proceeds from Farm Bureau's payout \r\n  on the Camaro, Susan Courtney purchased a pick-up truck. She subsequently insured \r\n  the truck with Unisun Insurance Co. on October 8, apparently without her husband's \r\n  knowledge or consent. The Unisun policy provided personal liability limits of \r\n  $15,000 per person and $30,000 per occurrence with property damage limits of \r\n  $25,000. The policy provided for identical uninsured motorist coverage (UM) \r\n  but afforded no UIM coverage.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 27, William Courtney, \r\n  driving his Saturn, sustained serious injuries when another vehicle crossed \r\n  the center line and struck him head-on. These injuries confined Courtney to \r\n  a wheelchair for nine weeks and later required him to use a walker. The at-fault \r\n  driver's insurer disbursed its minimum limits coverage for the accident, but \r\n  Courtney's medical bills and other losses far exceeded the amount received. \r\n  As a result, Farm Bureau paid Courtney the UIM limits from his policy on the \r\n  Saturn but denied his attempt to stack UIM coverage from the Camaro's policy, \r\n  claiming the Unisun policy obtained by Susan Courtney automatically terminated \r\n  Farm Bureau's policy on the Camaro. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFarm Bureau brought this \r\n  declaratory judgment action against Courtney and Unisun, seeking judicial determination \r\n  of its obligation on the Camaro's policy. At Farm Bureau's request, the trial \r\n  court dismissed Unisun as a party to the lawsuit. The court held a hearing and \r\n  issued an order finding the Unisun policy on Susan Courtney's pick-up truck \r\n  did not terminate the Farm Bureau policy on William Courtney's Camaro. This \r\n  appeal followed.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA declaratory judgment action \r\n  is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying \r\n  issue. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Auto World of Orangeburg, Inc., 334 S.C. \r\n  137, 511 S.E.2d 692 (Ct. App. 1999). A suit to determine coverage under an automobile \r\n  insurance policy, based in contract, is an action at law. Id. This Court's \r\n  jurisdiction, therefore, is limited to correcting errors of law, and the trial \r\n  court's factual findings will not be disturbed unless unsupported by any evidence. \r\n  Id. \r\n   \r\nFarm Bureau contends Susan \r\n  Courtney's purchase and insurance of the pick-up truck with Unisun relieved \r\n  it of any obligation to indemnify William Courtney under the UIM provision of \r\n  the Camaro's policy. The automatic termination clause in Farm Bureau's policy \r\n  states in pertinent part:  \r\n   \r\nIf you obtain other insurance \r\n  on your covered auto, any similar insurance provided by this policy will terminate \r\n  as to that auto on the effective date of the other insurance. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn refusing to find termination \r\n  automatic under this clause, the trial court determined the phrase \"any similar \r\n  insurance,\" as employed in the Farm Bureau policy, was ambiguous. Construing \r\n  the term in favor of Courtney, the named insured, the court found that the Farm \r\n  Bureau and Unisun policies did not afford similar insurance because of the \"vast \r\n  difference\" in coverage between the two. In particular, the trial court noted \r\n  the Farm Bureau policy provided both liability and UIM coverage in amounts of \r\n  100/300/25 while the Unisun policy furnished only the minimum liability insurance \r\n  required by law and no UIM coverage at all. Farm Bureau, on the other hand, \r\n  claimed the two policies \"share sufficient characteristics in common\" because \r\n  they both provide first-person liability insurance and thus are substantially \r\n  similar. \r\nThe meaning of \"similar\" \r\n  insurance in the automatic termination clause in Farm Bureau's policy is a novel \r\n  question in this state.(1) Initially, we agree \r\n  with the trial court that the term \"similar\" is ambiguous. It is not defined \r\n  in the policy itself and creates uncertainty as to its precise meaning.(2) \r\n  In describing an identical automatic termination provision in Motors Insurance \r\n  Corp. v. Bodie, the district court stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"Similar\" is not defined \r\n  by the policy and may be used in English to mean the \"same\" or \"identical\" though \r\n  it is defined as \"showing some resemblance; related in appearance or nature; \r\n  alike though not identical.\" It is difficult to imagine being called upon to \r\n  interpret a more imprecise term. This inherent vagueness fully justifies the \r\n  conclusion that the term \"similar\" is ambiguous.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n770 F. Supp. 547, 550 (E.D. \r\n  Cal. 1991) (citation and footnote omitted). Likewise, Black's Law Dictionary \r\n  defines the term as: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNearly corresponding; resembling \r\n  in many respects; somewhat alike; having a general likeness, although allowing \r\n  for some degree of difference. . . . [S]imilar is generally interpreted to mean \r\n  that one thing has a resemblance in many respects, nearly corresponds, is somewhat \r\n  like, or has a general likeness to some other thing but is not identical in \r\n  form and substance, although in some cases \"similar\" may mean identical or exactly \r\n  alike. It is a word with different meanings depending on [the] context in which \r\n  it is used.  \r\n   \r\nBlack's Law Dictionary \r\n  1383 (6th ed. 1990)(internal citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Farm Bureau argues \r\n  that the word \"similar\" should not be construed as being synonymous with \"identical\" \r\n  and contends that because both its policy and the Unisun policy contained first-party \r\n  liability insurance, the policies are sufficiently similar to invoke its automatic \r\n  termination clause.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe agree with Farm Bureau \r\n  that \"similar\" should not be construed as being synonymous with \"identical.\" \r\n  See Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., 318 S.C. 231, \r\n  456 S.E.2d 912 (1995) (noting this court must give policy language its plain, \r\n  ordinary, and popular meaning). However, we reject Farm Bureau's argument that \r\n  the two policies are sufficiently similar simply because they both provide first-party \r\n  liability insurance. Doubtless, every automobile insurance policy is inherently \r\n  alike in that respect. Rather, in order to determine whether the two are sufficiently \r\n  alike to be deemed similar, the policies must be examined as a whole. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause South Carolina has \r\n  no case on point, we find it helpful to turn to courts of other jurisdictions. \r\n  In the context of automatic termination clauses, at least three courts interpreting \r\n  identical language have held policies differing in the amount of coverage provided \r\n  are not \"similar\" insurance as contemplated by the parties.(3) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn Employers Mutual Casualty \r\n  Co. v. Martin, 671 A.2d 798 (R.I. 1996), the Martins purchased insurance \r\n  through Employers in April 1989; the policy had liability limits of $300,000 \r\n  per accident. In May 1989, Employers informed the Martins that due to their \r\n  poor driving records, it was canceling the policy on July 10. At the end of \r\n  May, the Martins applied for and received insurance coverage from the Metropolitan \r\n  Property and Liability Insurance Company. The Metropolitan policy had limits \r\n  of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. From May 25 to July 10, the \r\n  Martins were covered under both policies. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn July 9, Paul Martin was \r\n  involved in an automobile accident with an uninsured driver that resulted in \r\n  the death of his five-year old son, Paul, Jr. The Martins filed claims with \r\n  both Employers and Metropolitan. Under the Metropolitan policy, the Martins' \r\n  recovery was limited to $200,000; however, under Employers' policy, the Martins \r\n  could recover up to $300,000. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a declaratory judgment \r\n  action, Employers asserted that its policy automatically terminated when the \r\n  Martins purchased \"similar\" insurance from Metropolitan, and thus Employers \r\n  was not liable under its policy. The Rhode Island Supreme Court disagreed. In \r\n  holding the two policies were not sufficiently similar to effectuate an automatic \r\n  cancellation, the court specifically found the \"disparity in coverage\" between \r\n  the policies precluded any interpretation that they represented similar insurance \r\n  as intended by the policy language. Id. at 801. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Motors Insurance Corp. \r\n  v. Bodie, Patrick Bodie obtained a policy from Motors on his pick-up truck \r\n  with limits of 25/50/10. A few months later the Bodies sought to add a Corvette \r\n  to the Motors' policy. Motors, however, refused to insure the Corvette. Teresa \r\n  Bodie, Patrick's wife, then insured the Corvette in her own name with Financial \r\n  Indemnity Co., along with the truck. The Financial policy had liability limits \r\n  of 15/30/10. The Bodies did not inform Motors that Financial had issued a policy \r\n  covering the truck.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nShortly thereafter, Patrick \r\n  Bodie was involved in a serious accident when his truck struck a vehicle occupied \r\n  by six other people. The Bodies immediately reported the accident to Motors, \r\n  which settled the collision claim on the truck. Upon learning of the Financial \r\n  policy, however, Motors denied coverage based on its policy's automatic termination \r\n  clause.  \r\n   \r\nThe federal district court, \r\n  applying California law to interpret the two allegedly \"similar\" insurance policies, \r\n  ultimately determined the policies were \"not the same\" because each provided \r\n  \"different limits for third party liability.\" Bodie, 770 F. Supp. at \r\n  550. In so finding, the court declared that \"[t]his difference [in coverage] \r\n  is likely to be the most important and significant difference in the eyes of \r\n  the insured.\" Id. The court, therefore, concluded the Financial policy \r\n  did not effect an automatic termination of the Motors' insurance policy. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, the Iowa Supreme \r\n  Court addressed this issue in United Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Victoria, \r\n  576 N.W.2d 118 (Iowa 1998). In United, the Victorias were in the process \r\n  of switching their insurance from United to State Farm. United, however, never \r\n  refunded the premiums, and for five days, the Victorias were covered by both \r\n  United and State Farm. During that time period, Victor and Mabel Victoria, along \r\n  with their son Roger, collided head-on with Timothy Hatting. Mabel was killed \r\n  in the accident. After the accident, Victor and Roger filed claims with United. \r\n  United denied coverage under its contract, asserting that its policy automatically \r\n  terminated with the purchase of the State Farm policy because the coverages \r\n  were \"similar insurance\" under its policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLike the policy at issue \r\n  in our case, the United policy did not define the word \"similar.\" The Iowa Supreme \r\n  Court, noting Bodie, found the term to be ambiguous. The court then noted \r\n  that the differences between the two policies were apparent. The State Farm \r\n  policy had limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident whereas the \r\n  United policy had limits of $250,000 and $500,000, respectively. Moreover, the \r\n  State Farm policy also provided no-fault coverage and road-side services that \r\n  the United policy did not, while the United policy included UIM coverage that \r\n  the State Farm policy did not. Based on these differences, the Iowa Supreme \r\n  Court determined that the State Farm policy was not \"similar\" so as to effectuate \r\n  automatic termination of the United policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe are persuaded by these \r\n  authorities that \"similar\" insurance as used in Farm Bureau's automatic termination \r\n  clause cannot be held to mean simply sharing common characteristics, particularly \r\n  in light of this state's policy of construing insurance policies in favor of \r\n  coverage for the insured. See Diamond, 318 S.C. at 236, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  at 915 (holding that ambiguities are construed against the insurer); accord \r\n  Bodie, 770 F. Supp. at 550 (\"Under applicable rules of interpretation, \r\n  therefore, the court cannot interpret 'similar' to mean 'showing some resemblance' \r\n  for that would be to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insurer.\"). Where, \r\n  as here, a second, subsequent automobile insurance policy differs in both the \r\n  amount of coverage and the kind of coverage provided, the policies will not \r\n  be held to be \"similar\" insurance as contemplated in an  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nautomatic termination provision. \r\n  Accordingly, the Unisun policy purchased by Susan Courtney did not cancel Farm \r\n  Bureau's policy on the Camaro.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and \r\n  ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n1.  Farm \r\n  Bureau's assertion that Camden Wholesale Grocery v. National Fire Ins. Co., \r\n  106 S.C. 467, 91 S.E. 732 (1917), and Walker v. Queen Ins. Co., 136 S.C. \r\n  144, 134 S.E. 263 (1926), are analogous is without merit. In these fire insurance \r\n  cases, the court upheld the denial of coverage based on automatic termination \r\n  clauses. The clauses therein, however, expressly stated the policies would terminate \r\n  if the insured procured any other contract of insurance, not \"similar \r\n  insurance.\" \r\n2.  See \r\n  Black's Law Dictionary 79-80 (6th ed. 1990) (words are ambiguous \r\n  when \"their signification seems doubtful and uncertain to persons of competent \r\n  skill and knowledge to understand them\"). \r\n3.  \r\nAdditionally, in Franklin \r\nv. Kimberly, 1997 WL 379173 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997), an unreported opinion, \r\nthe Tennessee Court of Appeals found that the word \"similar\" was ambiguous and \r\nmust be construed against the insurer. In so construing, the court held that insurance \r\ncoverage in two separate policies are similar only to the extent the policy amounts \r\nare similar. (We note that the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure, unlike \r\nthe analogous South Carolina rules, do not prohibit the use of unpublished opinions \r\nso long as a copy is provided to the judge and opposing counsel. Compare \r\nRule 11, Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure with Rule239, SCACR). \r\n4.  Because \r\n  we affirm the trial court on this ground, we need not reach Farm Bureau's other \r\n  issues. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3229","title":"deBondt v.

We affirm \r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe facts, in the light \r\n  most favorable to deBondt, are as follows. On June 10, 1996, deBondt, a car \r\n  collector, contracted to purchase the sixteenth 1998 model Mercedes SLK 230 \r\n  received by Carlton, a Mercedes dealership. She tendered a $1,000 deposit on \r\n  the $42,000 list price. The sales representative for Carlton informed deBondt \r\n  that the first 1998 model SLK automobile was not expected to arrive until February \r\n  1997 and that it might take eighteen months for deBondt's car to arrive. The \r\n  sales representative also informed deBondt that she would begin receiving special \r\n  SLK promotional materials, created and distributed by Mercedes, in the \"next \r\n  few months.\" \r\nThe promotional materials \r\n  were part of a \"Keep in Touch\" (KIT) marketing program developed by Mercedes \r\n  to keep purchasers informed of the production schedule for their automobiles. \r\n  Mercedes limited eligibility for the KIT program to the first 7,000 SLK owners, \r\n  known as \"SLK Charter Owners.\" Under the program, Mercedes mailed various packages \r\n  to the customers quarterly. The particular package mailed depended on the production \r\n  stage of the automobile. Each package contained a personalized letter from the \r\n  SLK itself as well as technical and/or historical information about the SLK. \r\n  According to deBondt, the promotional materials also included four personalized \r\n  CDs, a key chain signifying membership in the exclusive \"SLK Charter Members \r\n  Group,\" a photograph of an SLK prototype, and a \"family album\" of previous Mercedes \r\n  automobiles. Mercedes publicized the promotional materials as part of the sales \r\n  package for the first 7,000 SLKs purchased. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe KIT program centered \r\n  around a customer database managed by the dealer \"with market team assistance.\" \r\n  Managing the database involved entering the customer information into the database \r\n  and confirming customer status. Mercedes then conducted the actual mailings \r\n  to the customers based on the information entered into the database by the dealer. \r\n  As part of the process, Mercedes sent the dealer a manuscript on a quarterly \r\n  basis, indicating the mailing schedule for each of the customers listed in the \r\n  dealer's database. This provided the dealer an opportunity to clarify any discrepancies \r\n  and to check the status of each customer's order within the KIT program. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the KIT program, dealers \r\n  had the option of placing two different types of SLK orders in the database, \r\n  customer specific orders or stock orders. If the dealer entered customer information \r\n  with the SLK order, the customer received the KIT materials from Mercedes. If, \r\n  on the other hand, the dealer ordered the SLK under the dealer's name, the order \r\n  was merely a stock order and no promotional materials were mailed. The dealer \r\n  could change the status of a stock order by specifying a customer's name and \r\n  changing the code for the order in the database. Similarly, the dealer could \r\n  instruct Mercedes not to mail promotional materials to a particular customer \r\n  listed in the database by name. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn February 1997, deBondt \r\n  visited Carlton's showroom to select the accessories and colors for her new \r\n  car. At that time, Carlton representatives told her she would begin receiving \r\n  her KIT promotional materials \"in the near future.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn March 12, 1997, Carlton \r\n  sent deBondt a letter attempting to unilaterally cancel its contract with her. \r\n  Carlton represented to deBondt that it had received no SLKs at that time. During \r\n  subsequent discussions, however, Carlton's General Manager allegedly admitted \r\n  that Carlton had already received four SLKs.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDeBondt submitted to Carlton \r\n  a draft complaint alleging breach of contract and seeking specific performance \r\n  and damages. On June 30, 1997, Carlton's attorney wrote to deBondt's attorney \r\n  and confirmed that Carlton would \"place Ms. deBondt back on the waiting list \r\n  in the same position she occupied prior to this disagreement, including the \r\n  reinstatement of delivery of all promotional materials related to the production \r\n  and delivery of the SLK automobile with no time gaps and no incorrect personalization \r\n  . . . .\" However, deBondt's attorney subsequently received a letter from Mercedes, \r\n  dated August 26, 1997, indicating deBondt was not an SLK Charter Owner and therefore \r\n  was not entitled to receive items provided to the Charter Owners. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 9, 1997, Carlton \r\n  delivered an SLK to deBondt for the purchase price of $42,258.60. No promotional \r\n  materials were ever delivered to deBondt. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDeBondt filed this action \r\n  against Carlton and Mercedes on October 9, 1997, alleging four causes of action: \r\n  (1) violations of the Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers \r\n  Act; (2) fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation; (3)&nbsp;specific performance; \r\n  and (4) violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act. She alleged that Carlton \r\n  and Mercedes refused to supply her, as agreed, with the promotional materials \r\n  signifying her status as an SLK Charter Owner. Further, deBondt alleged the \r\n  limited production SLK automobiles with the appropriate promotional materials \r\n  were being resold by non-Mercedes dealers for $55,000, approximately $13,000 \r\n  more than the $42,000 list price of the vehicle.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMercedes initially denied \r\n  that deBondt was one of the first 7,000 purchasers of the SLK. However, Mercedes \r\n  subsequently admitted during discovery that deBondt was in fact one of the first \r\n  7,000 purchasers. Nevertheless, in its answers to deBondt's requests to admit, \r\n  Mercedes maintained deBondt was not eligible for the promotional materials because \r\n  Carlton did not submit her name to Mercedes as the purchaser, but rather listed \r\n  her purchase as a stock order, which prevented her from receiving the materials.\r\nOn July 29, 1998, Judge \r\n  Joseph Watson granted summary judgment to Carlton, finding Carlton neither manufactured \r\n  nor controlled the distribution of any of the SLK Charter Owners promotional \r\n  materials. Judge Watson found that Carlton timely ordered the promotional materials \r\n  from Mercedes, but Mercedes failed to deliver the materials. Judge Watson found \r\n  deBondt's complaint was against Mercedes, not Carlton.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 7, 1998, Mercedes \r\n  offered to settle the litigation by providing \"a pristine set of all promotional \r\n  materials received by Charter Owners of the SLK 230, complete with personalized \r\n  letters addressed to Ms. deBondt and the attached affidavit confirming the authenticity \r\n  of the materials, in return for a full and final release of all claims against \r\n  Mercedes.\" DeBondt tentatively accepted the settlement by letter on October \r\n  19, 1998, but subsequently refused the offered materials because they were not \r\n  in the condition promised. DeBondt claimed one of the containers for the materials \r\n  was scratched, the letters contained numerous typographical errors and other \r\n  inaccuracies, and a reply card was missing. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn November 20, 1998, Judge \r\n  Henry Floyd granted summary judgment to Mercedes, concluding that deBondt's \r\n  complaint raised no genuine issue as to any material fact. DeBondt appeals the \r\n  orders granting summary judgment to the defendants. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n  County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). In determining whether any \r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. \r\n  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Regulation of \r\n  Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn her first cause of action, \r\n  deBondt alleges Carlton and Mercedes committed acts in violation of the Regulation \r\n  of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (the \"Dealers Act\"), S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 56-15-10 to -130 (1991 &amp; Supp. 1999). She argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment to Carlton and Mercedes on this claim. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Dealers Act declares \r\n  certain unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices \r\n  to be unlawful. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-30(a) (1991). Any person injured by reason \r\n  of a violation of the Act may sue for damages. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-110(1) \r\n  (1991). It is a violation of the Dealers Act for any manufacturer or motor vehicle \r\n  dealer \"to engage in any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable \r\n  and which causes damage to any of the parties or to the public.\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-15-40(1) (1991) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough arbitrary conduct \r\n  is not defined in the Dealers Act, our supreme court has defined it for purposes \r\n  of the Act to include \"acts which are unreasonable, capricious or nonrational; \r\n  not done according to reason or judgment; depending on will alone.\" Taylor \r\n  v. Nix, 307 S.C. 551, 555, 416 S.E.2d 619, 621 (1992). Furthermore, our \r\n  supreme court has defined bad faith as:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe opposite of good faith, \r\n  generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to \r\n  deceive or mislead another, or a neglect or refusal to [fulfill] some duty or \r\n  some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights \r\n  or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nState v. Griffin, \r\n  100 S.C. 331, 333, 84 S.E. 876, 877 (1915) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe Dealers Act defines \r\n  \"fraud\" to include its \"normal legal connotation\" as well as \"misrepresentation \r\n  in any manner, whether intentionally false or due to gross negligence, of a \r\n  material fact; a promise or representation not made honestly and in good faith; \r\n  and an intentional failure to disclose a material fact.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-10(m) \r\n  (1991). \r\n   \r\nTo be liable under the Dealers \r\n  Act, the dealer must participate in the wrongful conduct. Jackson v. Speed, \r\n  326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997). \"An agent for an entity who makes misrepresentations \r\n  while attempting to sell a motor vehicle qualifies as a dealer who may be held \r\n  liable under this act.\" Id. at 302, 486 S.E.2d at 756. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs to Carlton, we find the \r\n  pleadings and affidavits raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \r\n  Carlton's actions were arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable. Viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to deBondt, the pleadings and evidentiary matter show \r\n  that Carlton represented to deBondt during its initial negotiations with her \r\n  that by ordering an SLK from them and placing her name on the waiting list, \r\n  she would become an SLK Charter Owner and would receive special promotional \r\n  materials related to her limited edition automobile. Although Carlton informed \r\n  deBondt that it might take eighteen months for her SLK to arrive, the sales \r\n  representative \"was able to seal the deal\" with her by explaining the benefits \r\n  she would receive through the Charter Owners program. Despite these promises, \r\n  Carlton placed deBondt's order for an SLK as a stock order, rather than as a \r\n  customer specific order, thus ensuring that no promotional materials would accompany \r\n  the order and that deBondt would not join the elite group of Charter Owners. \r\n  Although deBondt ultimately received her SLK and paid the purchase price for \r\n  the automobile, she did not receive the special promotional materials signifying \r\n  her status as an owner of a limited edition automobile. She therefore suffered \r\n  damages in the amount of the difference between the value of the automobile \r\n  with the promotional materials and the value of the automobile without the promotional \r\n  materials. \r\n   \r\nFrom these allegations, \r\n  a jury could infer that Carlton misled deBondt as to her status as a Charter \r\n  Owner in order to persuade deBondt to contract to purchase an automobile which \r\n  would not even arrive at the dealership for approximately one and a half years. \r\n  A jury also could infer Carlton neglected to fulfill an obligation owed to deBondt \r\n  under its contract not from an honest mistake but from some other motive. The \r\n  decision to place the SLK order as a stock order rather than as a customer specific \r\n  order apparently was a decision within Carlton's will, and Carlton made that \r\n  decision without informing deBondt, knowing she would not receive the special \r\n  SLK promotional materials as a result. Because a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  exists as to whether Carlton's actions were arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable, \r\n  we conclude the grant of summary judgment to Carlton on this cause of action \r\n  should be reversed. See Tupper, 326 S.C. at 325, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d at 191.  \r\n   \r\nAs to Mercedes, while the \r\n  evidence is more tenuous, we cannot say as a matter of law that no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact exists as to whether Mercedes' actions in developing and administering \r\n  the KIT program were arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable. Mercedes admitted \r\n  in its answer \"that the first 7,000 owners of Mercedes SLK 230 automobiles were \r\n  entitled to a series of promotional materials.\" It also admitted that it publicized \r\n  the promotional materials \"as being a part of the sales package of the first \r\n  7,000 Mercedes SLK 230 automobiles purchased.\" This contradicts Mercedes' assertion \r\n  at the summary judgment stage that it did not advertise the KIT promotional \r\n  program. Furthermore, information obtained during discovery indicates that Mercedes \r\n  informed the dealers that they could place either a customer specific order \r\n  for an SLK, which included the promotional materials, or a stock order for an \r\n  SLK, which did not include the promotional materials. Viewing this evidentiary \r\n  matter in the light most favorable to deBondt, it appears Mercedes instituted \r\n  a program which they publicized as entitling the first 7,000 owners of an SLK \r\n  to unique promotional materials, yet which allowed the dealers to choose at \r\n  will which owners actually received the publicized materials.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n We find the pleadings, \r\n  responses to discovery, and affidavits present factual issues requiring further \r\n  development of the case. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment \r\n  in favor of Mercedes on the Dealers Act cause of action. See L \r\n  &amp; W Wholesale, Inc. v. Gore, 305 S.C. 250, 407 S.E.2d 658 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991) (at the summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not weigh \r\n  conflicting evidence regarding a material fact in dispute, nor does it make \r\n  credibility determinations). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Fraud, Deceit, \r\n  and Negligent Misrepresentation \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn her second cause of action, \r\n  deBondt alleges fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation on the part of \r\n  Carlton and Mercedes. She alleges both defendants falsely represented to her \r\n  that they intended to sell her a Mercedes SLK 230 automobile and to provide \r\n  her with KIT promotional materials. She claims the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to both defendants on this cause of action.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe elements of fraud and \r\n  deceit are stated in M.B. Kahn Constr. Co. v. South Carolina Nat'l Bank, \r\n  275 S.C. 381, 271 S.E.2d 414 (1980): \r\n   \r\nIn order to recover in an \r\n  action for fraud and deceit, based upon misrepresentation, the following elements \r\n  must be shown by clear, cogent and convincing evidence: (1) a representation; \r\n  (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or \r\n  a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation \r\n  be acted upon; (6)&nbsp;the hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's \r\n  reliance on its truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; (9) the hearer's \r\n  consequent and proximate injury. Failure to prove any one of the foregoing elements \r\n  is fatal to recovery.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 384, 271 S.E.2d \r\n  at 415. See also O'Shields v. Southern Fountain Mobile Homes, \r\n  Inc., 262 S.C. 276, 204 S.E.2d 50 (1974). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurther, South Carolina \r\n  recognizes the common law tort of negligent misrepresentation. Gilliland \r\n  v. Elmwood Properties, 301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990). Where the damage \r\n  alleged by the plaintiff is a pecuniary loss, the plaintiff must prove the following \r\n  elements for negligent misrepresentation: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) the defendant made a \r\n  false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest \r\n  in making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he \r\n  communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached \r\n  that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied \r\n  on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the \r\n  proximate result of his reliance upon the representation.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAMA Management Corp. \r\n  v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 222, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\n  See also Winburn v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 287 S.C. \r\n  435, 339 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App.1985).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor purposes of proving \r\n  negligent misrepresentation, evidence that a statement was made in the course \r\n  of the defendant's business, profession, or employment is sufficient to prove \r\n  the defendant's pecuniary interest in making the statement, even though the \r\n  defendant received no consideration for it. AMA Management Corp., 309 \r\n  S.C. at 223, 420 S.E.2d at 874. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find deBondt raised questions \r\n  of fact on the issues of fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation as to \r\n  Carlton. Viewed in the light most favorable to deBondt, the pleadings, responses \r\n  to discovery, and affidavits show that Carlton falsely represented to deBondt \r\n  that she would receive the SLK promotional materials by ordering the car from \r\n  Carlton and paying the $1,000 deposit. Carlton knew or should have known that \r\n  deBondt would not receive the promotional materials when it placed her order \r\n  as a stock order instead of a customer specific order. Carlton's representations \r\n  as to the receipt of the promotional materials were material to deBondt, who \r\n  was a collector of limited edition automobiles and automobile paraphernalia, \r\n  and deBondt had a right to rely on the representations made to her by Carlton \r\n  during her negotiations for the purchase of the SLK. By placing her $1,000 deposit, \r\n  deBondt relied on Carlton's representations, and she suffered a pecuniary loss \r\n  when she did not receive the promised materials. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMoreover, the representations \r\n  regarding the promotional materials were not vague promises as to future events. \r\n  See, e.g., Davis v. Upton, 250 S.C. 288, 291, 157 S.E.2d \r\n  567, 568 (1967) (\"The general rule is that fraud must relate to a present or \r\n  pre-existing fact, and cannot ordinarily be predicated on unfulfilled promises \r\n  or statements as to future events.\"); Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Partnerships, \r\n  312 S.C. 102, 105, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (plaintiffs failed to \r\n  state a claim for negligent misrepresentation because the representation involved \r\n  future events, not existing facts). According to deBondt, Carlton represented \r\n  to her that she was an SLK Charter Owners Group member from the time she placed \r\n  her order and that she would receive the promotional materials by virtue of \r\n  her status as a Charter Owner. Thus, the obligation was immediate. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe conclude summary judgment \r\n  on this issue was inappropriate. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment \r\n  as to Carlton on the cause of action for fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs to Mercedes, however, \r\n  we find the information contained in the pleadings, responses to discovery, \r\n  and affidavits inadequate to support a cause of action for fraud, deceit, and \r\n  negligent misrepresentation. There is no indication that Mercedes made a representation \r\n  directly to deBondt that she would receive the promotional materials for the \r\n  SLK she purchased from Carlton. Therefore, we affirm the grant of summary judgment \r\n  in favor of Mercedes as to this cause of action. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Specific Performance \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn her third cause of action, \r\n  deBondt alleges a claim for specific performance as to Carlton only. She claims \r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Carlton on this cause \r\n  of action.  \r\n   \r\nDeBondt contends she and \r\n  Carlton entered into a valid contract which Carlton breached. She alleges Carlton's \r\n  attorney subsequently sent a proposed settlement agreement to her attorney, \r\n  promising to place deBondt back on the waiting list to purchase the sixteenth \r\n  SLK received by Carlton. She alleges the proposal also included a promise to \r\n  reinstate delivery of all promotional materials. DeBondt further alleges that \r\n  \"[t]he promotional materials [she] was to receive with her Mercedes SLK 230 \r\n  automobile are unique, and [she] has no adequate remedy at law for Defendant \r\n  Carlton's breach of contract.\" She therefore seeks specific performance of the \r\n  settlement agreement.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCarlton argues the purported \r\n  settlement agreement is not subject to specific performance. However, we note \r\n  deBondt also alleges that she paid the contract price \"for the automobile she \r\n  contracted to purchase, and, on information and belief, Defendant Carlton was \r\n  supposed to be selling the Mercedes SLK automobiles with the aforementioned \r\n  promotional materials for the contract or 'list' price, thus, specific performance \r\n  would be equitable between the parties.\" From this context, it appears deBondt \r\n  also is seeking specific performance based on Carlton's failure to perform under \r\n  the contract. Accordingly, viewing the record in the light most favorable to \r\n  deBondt, we find a genuine issue of material fact exists as to her claim for \r\n  specific performance and reverse the grant of summary judgment as to Carlton. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. Unfair Trade \r\n  Practices Act \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDeBondt's fourth and final \r\n  cause of action arises under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to -160 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999). DeBondt claims the \r\n  circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of both defendants \r\n  on this cause of action.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe UTPA declares unfair \r\n  methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct \r\n  of trade or commerce to be unlawful. S.C. Code Ann. Â§39-5-20(a) (1985). \"Any \r\n  person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, \r\n  as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive \r\n  method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, \r\n  but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (1985).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn unfair trade practice \r\n  has been defined as a practice which is offensive to public policy or which \r\n  is immoral, unethical, or oppressive. Young v. Century Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., \r\n  302 S.C. 320, 396 S.E.2d 105 (Ct. App. 1989), aff'd in part, rev'd in part \r\n  on other grounds, 309 S.C. 263, 422 S.E.2d 103 (1992). A deceptive practice \r\n  is one which has a tendency to deceive. Id. \"Even a truthful statement \r\n  may be deceptive if it has a capacity or tendency to deceive.\" Id. at \r\n  326, 396 S.E.2d at 108.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhether an act or practice \r\n  is unfair or deceptive within the meaning of the UTPA depends upon the surrounding \r\n  facts and the impact of the transaction on the marketplace. Id. \"The \r\n  [UTPA] should not be construed to increase a plaintiff's burden of proving liability \r\n  since its purpose is to give additional protection to victims of unfair trade \r\n  practices, not to make a case harder to prove than it would be under common \r\n  law principles.\" Id. at 326, 396 S.E.2d at 108.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo be actionable under the \r\n  UTPA, the unfair or deceptive act or practice must have an impact upon the public \r\n  interest. Haley Nursery Co. v. Forrest, 298 S.C. 520, 381 S.E.2d 906 \r\n  (1989). \"An unfair or deceptive act or practice has an impact upon the public \r\n  interest if the act or practice has the potential for repetition.\" Id. \r\n  at 524, 381 S.E.2d at 908. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere are two general ways \r\n  to demonstrate the potential for repetition: (1) by showing the same kind of \r\n  actions occurred in the past, thus making it likely the actions will continue \r\n  absent some deterrence, or (2) by showing the company's procedures create a \r\n  potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts. Crary v. Djebelli, \r\n  329 S.C. 385, 496 S.E.2d 21 (1998). These are not the only means of showing \r\n  the potential for repetition, however, and each case must be evaluated on its \r\n  own merits. Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 497, 473 \r\n  S.E.2d 47, 51 (1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs set forth above, the \r\n  pleadings and evidentiary matter in this case show Carlton representatives made \r\n  misrepresentations of material facts to deBondt regarding her receipt of promotional \r\n  materials and her status as a Charter Owner. Although Carlton promised deBondt \r\n  she would reap the benefits of her status as a Charter Owner of an SLK, Carlton \r\n  placed a stock order for deBondt's automobile which was not accompanied by any \r\n  of the promotional mailings. As alluded to earlier, a jury could infer Carlton \r\n  deceived deBondt as to her status as an SLK Charter Owner in order to induce \r\n  her into paying a $1,000 deposit and placing her name on a long waiting list \r\n  for an automobile. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the pleadings \r\n  and evidentiary matter demonstrate Mercedes instituted and administered the \r\n  KIT program in order to \"[lessen] the chance of customers selecting more available \r\n  competitive products\" and \"build anticipation, and thus loyalty, during the \r\n  waiting period.\" If, as deBondt alleges, Mercedes knew its dealers enticed their \r\n  customers into ordering Mercedes SLKs by promising them the benefits of the \r\n  promotional program and then placed all orders as stock orders without informing \r\n  the customers, a jury could determine the administration of the program was \r\n  an unfair and deceptive act prohibited by the UTPA. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs alleged by deBondt in \r\n  her complaint, the acts described were capable of repetition. We therefore conclude \r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to both defendants on the \r\n  UTPA claims at this time. See, e.g., Prestwick Golf Club, \r\n  Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. Partnership, 331 S.C. 385, 503 S.E.2d 184 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998), cert. denied (Apr. 12, 1999) (holding grant of summary judgment \r\n  was error where questions of fact existed as to whether there was a violation \r\n  of the UTPA). \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the grant of summary judgment to Carlton as to all causes of action is reversed, \r\n  the grant of summary judgment to Mercedes is affirmed in part and reversed in \r\n  part, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with \r\n  this opinion. \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, \r\n  REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and \r\n  STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n1.

Allen Lee Hawkins and Gryphon, Inc. appeal. \r\n\r\nWe reverse and remand. (1) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July 1987 Allen Lee Hawkins accepted delivery of a 52-foot Tayana sailboat,  which he christened the\r\n\r\n\"LadyHawk\" and documented with the United States Coast Guard.  Hawkins spent more than $300,000 to\r\n\r\nacquire and outfit the boat for sailing. In December 1989, on the advice of his attorney, Hawkins\r\n\r\ntransferred title of the LadyHawk to Gryphon, Inc., a Florida corporation of which he was the sole\r\n\r\nshareholder and officer.  Two years later, apparently upon an order of the family court in Hawkins' divorce\r\n\r\nproceeding, Gryphon transferred the vessel back to Hawkins. The LadyHawk was then re-documented\r\n\r\nwith the Coast Guard in Hawkins' name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of August 1995, Hawkins received two separate notices from the Beaufort County Treasurer. \r\n\r\nThe notices, dated August 16 and August 24 respectively, informed Hawkins his 1994 property taxes for\r\n\r\nthe LadyHawk in the amount of $2,814.67 were delinquent and that the boat was subject to sale on\r\n\r\nOctober 2.  Hawkins immediately retained an attorney to dispute the original tax assessment; however,\r\n\r\nHawkins did not pay the taxes and the vessel was sold to Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware\r\n\r\nfor the exact amount of the delinquency.  Hawkins learned of the sale on December 16, 1995 when law\r\n\r\nenforcement officers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida evicted him and took possession of the\r\nLadyHawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 19 Hawkins filed a petitory action in federal district court to quiet title in the LadyHawk,\r\n\r\nand the following day the court authorized a Warrant of Arrest in Rem for the vessel.  Bruno in turn filed a\r\n\r\nmotion to vacate the arrest and dismiss the action, asserting it was the LadyHawk's lawful owner as a\r\n\r\nresult of the tax sale.  On March 7, 1996, the district court held a show cause hearing on Bruno's motion. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the court determined it lacked jurisdiction over the petitory action because Hawkins was\r\n\r\nneither the current owner of the LadyHawk nor the real party in interest. (2)  Consequently, on July 16 the\r\n\r\ncourt dismissed Hawkins' action without prejudice and vacated the arrest of the LadyHawk.  In so doing,\r\n\r\nhowever, the district court specifically noted the dismissal was not an adjudication of title to the vessel.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1996, Hawkins brought the instant action to set aside the sale of the LadyHawk and restrain\r\n\r\nBruno from selling or otherwise encumbering the vessel.  The circuit court ordered the case referred to the\r\n\r\nMaster-in-Equity for Beaufort County.  On March 5, 1998, Bruno motioned the court to dismiss the\r\n\r\ncomplaint or, alternatively, grant summary judgment on the basis of judicial estoppel because Hawkins\r\n\r\nhad claimed in the prior federal proceeding that Gryphon, Inc., not he, was the LadyHawk's true owner.\r\n\r\nThe master declined to grant the motion and Hawkins filed a motion to join Gryphon, Inc. as a necessary\r\n\r\nparty.  The master granted this motion on May 29, 1998.  As a result, Hawkins filed a third amended\r\n\r\ncomplaint on June 18 adding Gryphon, Inc. as a party plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case was tried before the master on July 1, 1998. (3)  At the close of the evidence, Hawkins moved to\r\n\r\namend his complaint to assert additional causes of action for fraud and conversion plus a claim for money\r\n\r\ndamages.  The motion was based upon the fact that he had learned, just days earlier, that the LadyHawk\r\n\r\nhad been sold in July 1997 despite Bruno's repeated assurances to the contrary. (4)  The master took the\r\n\r\nmotion under advisement and reserved ruling.  On May 11, 1999 the master issued an order upholding the\r\n\r\ntax sale and entering judgment in favor of the defendants.  As an additional ground for the judgment, the\r\n\r\nmaster ruled Hawkins was judicially estopped from asserting an ownership interest in the LadyHawk\r\n\r\nbecause, in the previous federal proceeding in Florida, he had argued Gryphon, Inc. owned the vessel. (5)  In\r\n\r\naddition, because Hawkins' ancillary claims were contingent upon a favorable disposition on the tax sale\r\n\r\nissue, the master denied his motion to amend the complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, Hawkins filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.  On May 25,\r\n\r\n1999, the master amended his prior order and addressed more specifically Hawkins' arguments regarding\r\n\r\nthe validity of the tax sale.  Hawkins now appeals, arguing the master erred in applying the doctrine of\r\n\r\njudicial estoppel to bar his claims and in finding the sale of the LadyHawk valid despite the Beaufort\r\n\r\nCounty Treasurer's failure to comply with statutory requirements for the seizure and sale of delinquent\r\n\r\ntax property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn action to set aside a tax sale lies in equity.  See \r\nGodfrey v. Webb, 277 S.C. 246, 285 S.E.2d 883 (1982);\r\nFolk v. Thomas, 336 S.C. 466, 520 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 1999).  Accordingly, this Court may take its own\r\n\r\nview of the preponderance of the evidence. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 773 (1976); Folk, 336 S.C. at 469, 520 S.E.2d at 329.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Validity of the Tax Sale  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Levy Notices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkins first argues the master erred in upholding the tax sale because the County's levy notices were\r\n\r\ndefectively worded.  We agree.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procedure for collecting delinquent property taxes is governed by statute.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n\r\n12-51-40 (Supp. 1999); Durham v. United Companies Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 603, 503 S.E.2d 465, 467\r\n\r\n(1998) (\"The sale of the property of a defaulting taxpayer is governed by statute.\");\r\nF.C. Enterprises, Inc. v.\r\n\r\nDibble, 335 S.C. 260, 516 S.E.2d 459 (Ct. App. 1999).  Because Hawkins does not dispute he owed and\r\n\r\nfailed to pay 1994 property taxes on the LadyHawk in Beaufort County, the treasurer properly issued an\r\n\r\nexecution authorizing the tax collector to levy on and sell the vessel. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-45-180(A)\r\n\r\n(Supp. 1999) (\"If the taxes, assessments, and penalties are not paid before the seventeenth day of March,\r\n\r\nthe county treasurer shall issue his tax execution to the officer authorized and directed to collect\r\n\r\ndelinquent taxes . . . .\").  Thereafter, the County was required to mail a delinquency notice informing\r\n\r\nHawkins that, in the event the full amount due was not paid, the LadyHawk \"shall be advertised and sold\r\n\r\nto satisfy the delinquency.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(a) (Supp. 1999).  In addition, since the taxes\r\n\r\nremained unpaid, the tax collector was obliged to take exclusive possession of so much of the LadyHawk as\r\n\r\nwas necessary to satisfy the tax debt plus penalties and costs. Id. at Â§ 12-51-40(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this constructive possession, or \"levy by distress,\" the statutory scheme directs the County to\r\n\r\nmail the taxpayer a copy of the delinquency notice which \"shall specify that if the taxes, assessments,\r\n\r\npenalties, and costs are not paid before a subsequent sales date, the property must be duly advertised and\r\n\r\nsold . . . .\" Id.  (emphasis added).  In an effort to effectuate this mandate, Beaufort County employs a\r\n\r\nrubber stamp to imprint the following message upon delinquency notices in red ink:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF NOT PAID ON OR BEFORE 31 AUGUST THIS PROPERTY WILL BE DULY ADVERTISED AND SOLD FOR\r\n\r\nDELINQUENT TAXES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON THE FIRST MONDAY IN OCTOBER, THIS YEAR.  RETURN OF THIS\r\n\r\n\"CERTIFIED RECEIPT\" SHALL BE DEEMED EQUIVALENT TO \"LEVYING BY DISTRESS[.]\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy indicating payment is required \"on or before 31 August,\" this stamped annotation clearly contradicts\r\n\r\nthe explicit statutory language requiring notice to the taxpayer that if the taxes are not paid before the\r\n\r\ndate of sale, in this instance October 2nd, the property will be sold.  Moreover, the County compounded its\r\n\r\nerror by sending Hawkins a notice letter, dated August 24, which also contained the stamped annotation\r\n\r\nin red ink and read in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attached tax notice is delinquent.  The property is subject to sale at the October 2, 1995 delinquent tax\r\n\r\nsale.  Receipt of this notice constitutes levy by distress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll tax payments must be received by September 15, 1995 to avoid your name and property being\r\n\r\nadvertised in The Beaufort Gazette and The Island Packet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the defendants maintain the August 31 and September 15 deadlines set forth were merely dates\r\n\r\nby which Hawkins should have tendered payment in order to avoid the advertising of the LadyHawk for\r\n\r\nsale, we agree with Hawkins that these notices give the clear impression, contrary to statutory mandate,\r\n\r\nthat he was required to pay the taxes, penalties and costs at least two weeks before the October 2\r\n\r\n\"subsequent sales date.\"  We further agree the imposition of these artificial deadlines rendered the\r\n\r\nCounty's attempted notice inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Restricted Delivery Mail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkins next argues the tax sale was invalid because the treasurer failed to send the levy notices via\r\n\r\n\"restricted delivery\" mail.  We agree.  Section 12-51-40(b) provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of real property, exclusive possession is taken by mailing a notice of delinquent property taxes .\r\n\r\n. . to the current owner of record . . . by \"certified mail, return receipt requested-restricted delivery\".  In the\r\n\r\ncase of personal property, exclusive possession is taken by mailing the notice . . . to the person at the\r\n\r\naddress shown on the tax receipt or to an address of which the officer has actual knowledge.  The return\r\n\r\nreceipt of the \"certified mail\" notice is equivalent to \"levying by distress\". (6)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId.  Here, the County sent the required notice to Hawkins at 50 Palmetto Bay Road, Box 200, Hilton Head,\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina.  While the notice was sent \"certified mail, return receipt requested,\" the County failed to\r\n\r\nrestrict its delivery to Hawkins.  Because the Palmetto Bay Road address directed Hawkins' mail to a post\r\n\r\noffice box in his wife's name at Island Postal, a private mail service, Hawkins did not receive the August\r\n\r\nlevy notices until his wife picked up his mail and forwarded it to him in Fort Lauderdale.  Hawkins,\r\n\r\ntherefore, first received these notices at the end of August 1995.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Hawkins acknowledges the notices were sent by \"certified mail, return receipt requested,\" he\r\n\r\nargues they were defective in that delivery was not restricted to him personally.  On the other hand, the\r\n\r\ndefendants contend, and the master found, that the \"restricted delivery\" requirement applies only to real\r\n\r\nproperty, not personalty.  We agree with Hawkins that the statute requires restricted delivery when\r\n\r\nlevying by distress on both real and personal property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously, the \"restricted delivery\" language at issue only appears in the statute's sentence specifically\r\n\r\nreferencing real property.  The statute, however, must be read as a whole.  See \r\nWhitner v. State, 328 S.C.\r\n\r\n1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997) (in construing statutes, courts should consider not only the language of the\r\n\r\nparticular clause being construed, but each word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the\r\n\r\nwhole statute and policy of the law); South Carolina Coastal Council v. South Carolina State Ethics\r\n\r\nComm'n, 306 S.C. 41, 45, 410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991) (\"[I]n interpreting a statute, one does not look merely\r\n\r\nat a particular clause in which a word may be used, but rather looks at the word and its meaning in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the purpose of the whole statute, and in light of the object and policy of the law.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen read in context, it becomes apparent the \"restricted delivery\" language applies to personal property,\r\n\r\nas the statute clearly indicates delinquency notices on all property are sent via certified mail with a return\r\n\r\nreceipt attached. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(b) (Supp. 1999) (\"The return receipt of the 'certified mail'\r\n\r\nnotice is equivalent to 'levying by distress'.\").  In addition, subsection (c) of the statute provides for the\r\n\r\nphysical seizure of property, both real and personal, \"in the event the 'certified mail' notice has been\r\n\r\nreturned . . . .\" Id. at Â§ 12-51-40(c).  Because the sole reference in the entire statute to certified mail is that\r\n\r\nin subsection (b) requiring notice by \"certified mail, return receipt requested-restricted delivery,\" the only\r\n\r\nreasonable conclusion is that the legislature intended that all levy notices be sent in this manner\r\n\r\nregardless of the type of property involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, such a reading supports the underlying purpose of the statutory scheme governing tax\r\n\r\ncollection, that \"[a]ll requirements of law leading up to tax sales are intended for the protection of the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer against surprise or the sacrifice of his property.\"  Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C.\r\n\r\n552, 563, 521 S.E.2d 153, 159 (1999) (quoting Aldridge v. Rutledge, 269 S.C. 475, 478, 238 S.E.2d 165, 166\r\n\r\n(1977)); see also  Koenig v. S.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 325 S.C. 400, 404, 480 S.E.2d 98, 99 (Ct. App. 1996)\r\n\r\n(\"[Statutory] language must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with\r\n\r\nits general purpose.\"); Bennett v. Sullivan's Island Bd. of Adjustment, 313 S.C. 455, 458, 438 S.E.2d 273,\r\n\r\n274 (Ct. App. 1993) (\"Any ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and\r\n\r\nbeneficial operation of the law.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defendants concede the levy notices herein were not sent \"restricted delivery.\"  Accordingly, the\r\n\r\nCounty clearly failed to comply with the notice provisions of the statute in this regard.  See \r\nManji v.\r\n\r\nBlackwell, 323 S.C. 91, 473 S.E.2d 837 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding failure to send a redemption notice with\r\n\r\ndelivery restricted to addressee only did not comply with statutory notice requirements).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Property Description\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Hawkins contends the tax sale was void because the advertisement of the LadyHawk\r\n\r\ninsufficiently described the property.  Again, we agree.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a constructive \"levy by distress\" has been accomplished, the statute requires the tax collector to\r\n\r\n\"advertise[] the property for sale at public auction.\"  Id. at Â§ 12-51-40(d).  This subsection reads, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The advertisement] shall include the delinquent taxpayer's name and the description of the property, a\r\n\r\nreference to the county auditor's map-block-parcel number being sufficient for a description of realty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).  Here, the advertisement placed by the County in the Beaufort Gazette listed the\r\n\r\nowner of the LadyHawk as \"Hawkins Allen Lee\" and the description as \"PP550HAWALL,\" Hawkins' tax\r\n\r\naccount number.  Hawkins admits the ad heading identified a \"PP\" account as one involving the sale of a\r\n\r\n\"boat.\" He argues, however, that such a cursory identification does not give effect to the statute's intended\r\n\r\npurpose, i.e., to encourage competitive bidding so that the defaulting taxpayer suffers no more of a\r\n\r\ndeprivation of property than is necessary to meet his tax obligation.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.  See \r\nJoint\r\n\r\nLegislative Comm. v. Huff, 320 S.C. 241, 464 S.E.2d 324 (1995); Glover by Cauthen v. Suitt Constr.  Co.,\r\n\r\n318 S.C. 465, 458 S.E.2d 535 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to determine such intent, when confronted with an undefined statutory term we must give\r\n\r\nthe word its usual and customary meaning.  See \r\nAdoptive Parents v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 446\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 404 (1994); see also  Ray Bell Constr. Co., Inc. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 26,\r\n\r\n501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998) (\"Where the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms\r\n\r\naccording to their literal meaning.\"). A \"description\" is defined as \"[a] delineation or account of a\r\n\r\nparticular subject by the recital of its characteristic accidents and qualities.\"\r\nBlack's Law Dictionary 445\r\n\r\n(6th ed. 1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our view, the County's \"description\" of the LadyHawk as  \"PP550HAWALL\" does not meet the definition\r\n\r\nusually prescribed, and therefore is contrary to the clear direction of the statute.  See \r\nCoastal Council v.\r\n\r\nEthics Comm'n, 306 S.C. at 44, 410 S.E.2d at 247 (\"[I]n interpreting a statute, one does not look merely at\r\n\r\na particular clause in which a word may be used, but rather looks at the word and its meaning in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the purpose of the whole statute, and in light of the object and policy of the law.\").  This\r\n\r\nreading also comports with the statute's overriding objective to protect the defaulting taxpayer from unfair\r\n\r\nsurprise and sacrifice. See, e.g.,\r\nFolk v. Thomas, 336 S.C. 466, 470, 520 S.E.2d 327, 330 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n\r\n(construing Â§ 12-51-40(d) \"to protect against forfeiture\"); Manji, 323 S.C. at 94, 473 S.E.2d at 838 (\"The\r\n\r\nsound view is that all requirements of the law leading up to tax sales which are intended for the protection\r\n\r\nof the taxpayer against surprise or the sacrifice of his property are to be regarded [as] mandatory, and are\r\n\r\nto be strictly enforced.\") (quoting Osborne v. Vallentine, 196 S.C. 90, 94, 12 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1941)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.  Strict Statutory Compliance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appellate courts of this state have repeatedly stressed that all conditions governing tax sales are\r\n\r\nmandatory and strictly enforced.  Tanner, 336 S.C. at 563, 521 S.E.2d at 158-59;\r\nRives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C.\r\n\r\n287, 478 S.E.2d 878 (Ct. App. 1996).  Tax sales, therefore, \"must be conducted in strict compliance with\r\n\r\nstatutory requirements.\" In re Ryan Inv. Co., Inc., 335 S.C. 392, 395, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999);\r\nsee also\r\n\r\n Manji, 323 S.C. at 93, 473 S.E.2d at 838 (\"A statutorily-based tax sale requires strict adherence to the tax\r\n\r\nsale requirements.\"). This Court will set aside tax sales where the requisite statutory conditions of Â§ 12-51-40 have not been complied with by public officials.\r\nTanner, 336 S.C. at 563, 521 S.E.2d at 159.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case at bar, Beaufort County authorities did not comply with three separate provisions of Â§ 12-51-40\r\n\r\nin that they failed to 1) give proper, sufficiently-worded notice to Hawkins of the attempted levy; 2) restrict\r\n\r\ndelivery of the August 1995 levy notices; and 3) properly describe the LadyHawk in the tax sale\r\n\r\nadvertisement.  Each failure to comply with the requisite statutory mandate, in and of itself, is sufficient\r\n\r\nto void a tax sale.  See, e.g.,\r\nid. (\"Failure to give the required notice is a fundamental defect in the tax\r\n\r\nproceedings which renders the proceedings absolutely void.\") (citing Donohue v. Ward, 298 S.C. 75, 378\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1989)); Rives, 325 S.C. at 293, 478 S.E.2d at 881 (\"Due process of law requires some\r\n\r\nsort of notice to a landowner before he is deprived of his property.\"); Ryan, 335 S.C. at 395, 517 S.E.2d at\r\n\r\n693 (\"The failure to mail a redemption notice by restricted delivery mail is ground to invalidate a tax\r\n\r\nsale.\"); Manji, 323 S.C. at 94, 473 S.E.2d at 838 (voiding tax deed where Â§ 12-51-120 clearly required the\r\n\r\ntax collector to send a redemption notice \"certified mail, return receipt requested-deliver to addressee\r\n\r\nonly\" and official failed to comply, even where the notice was sent certified mail and the defaulting\r\n\r\ntaxpayer's wife signed the receipt); Rose v. Bradwell, 295 S.C. 147, 367 S.E.2d 443 (Ct. App. 1988) (setting\r\n\r\naside tax sale where required advertisement identified the property to be sold only by reference to an\r\n\r\nerroneous tax map number because it failed to strictly comply with the statutory requirement that the\r\n\r\nadvertisement specify the property to be sold).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite this clear guidance, the defendants repeatedly assert that \"Hawkins' dilemma and the loss of the\r\n\r\nLadyHawk was plainly the result of his inaction\" because he was aware the taxes were past due and failed\r\n\r\nto act to prevent the sale.  To the contrary, our appellate courts have expressly held proof of actual notice\r\n\r\nto the defaulting taxpayer does not excuse non-compliance with statutory notice requirements.  See  \r\nRyan,\r\n\r\n335 S.C. at 395, 517 S.E.2d at 693 (\"Even actual notice is insufficient to uphold a tax sale absent strict\r\n\r\ncompliance with statutory requirements.\"); Manji, 323 S.C. at 93, 473 S.E.2d at 838 (citing\r\nAldridge v.\r\n\r\nRutledge, 269 S.C. 475, 238 S.E.2d 165 (1977) (failure to provide the required statutory notice to the true\r\n\r\nowner of the property is not excused, regardless of actual notice)); South Carolina Fed.  Sav. Bank v.\r\n\r\nAtlantic Land Title Co., 314 S.C. 292, 295, 442 S.E.2d 630, 632 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"[S]tatutory notice\r\n\r\nrequirements may not be circumvented simply by establishing actual notice of a tax sale.\");\r\nDonohue v.\r\n\r\nWard, 298 S.C. 75, 83-84, 378 S.E.2d 261, 266 (Ct. App. 1989) (\"The giving of a mandatory notice to a tax\r\n\r\ndebtor is not waived by the informal knowledge on [his] part that taxes have not been paid . . . even if the\r\n\r\ndebtor has actual knowledge of it and attempts to waive a failure to give notice.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defendants further contend that the rule commanding strict construction of statutory notice provisions\r\n\r\napplies only to matters involving real property, not personalty.  This argument lacks merit.  No authority\r\n\r\nis cited in support of this proposition and we are aware of no case distinguishing between real and\r\n\r\npersonal property; indeed, both types of property are governed by the same provisions of our Code.  We\r\n\r\ntherefore see no reason not to require strict compliance in this instance.  Because the County failed to\r\n\r\nadhere to the mandatory notice provisions contained in Â§ 12-51-40, we conclude the tax sale of the\r\n\r\nLadyHawk was void.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Judicial Estoppel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his second issue on appeal, Hawkins asserts the master erred in applying the doctrine of judicial\r\n\r\nestoppel as a further bar to recovery of the LadyHawk.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial estoppel operates to prohibit a party to a lawsuit \"from adopting a position in conflict with one\r\n\r\nearlier taken in the same or related litigation.\"  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 472, 477 (1997).  Its purpose is not to protect the parties from allegedly dishonest conduct by\r\n\r\nadversaries; rather, judicial estoppel acts to ensure the integrity of the judicial process.\r\nId. (citing 31 C. J.\r\n\r\nS. Estoppel &amp; Waiver Â§ 139 (1996)).  The doctrine, therefore, sustains the truth-seeking function of the\r\n\r\ncourts. Id. at 252, 489 S.E.2d at 477.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance, the master applied judicial estoppel to preclude Hawkins from claiming ownership of the\r\n\r\nLadyHawk because he had previously argued in federal district court that Gryphon, Inc. owned the vessel. \r\n\r\nWe believe the defendants relinquished any right to assert judicial estoppel against Hawkins when\r\n\r\ncounsel for all parties agreed, on the record before the master, that Hawkins in fact owned the LadyHawk\r\n\r\nat the time of the tax sale.  (7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted above, judicial estoppel focuses on the relationship between the litigants and the judicial system. \r\n\r\nCourts invoke the doctrine to deter parties from playing \"fast-and-loose\" with the facts of a case such that\r\n\r\nthe judicial system is adversely impacted.  See 31 C. J. S. at 593-594.  Because judicial estoppel is an\r\n\r\nequitable concept, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case, application of the\r\n\r\ndoctrine is discretionary. Id. at 595.  This Court will not condone the application of judicial estoppel where\r\n\r\nto do so would work an injustice against the party being estopped while simultaneously subverting the\r\n\r\njudicial process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the parties and master stipulated that Hawkins owned the LadyHawk at the time of the tax sale at\r\n\r\nissue.  The defendants, however, now contend Hawkins is estopped from claiming ownership of the vessel. \r\n\r\nThis assertion in no way serves the truth-seeking function of the judiciary; instead, it corrupts the process\r\n\r\nit is meant to uphold.  We agree with Hawkins that equity demands that all parties to litigation be bound\r\n\r\nby the same set of facts.  To hold otherwise would perpetrate an injustice to Hawkins that judicial estoppel\r\n\r\nis not intended to effect.  This is particularly true in light of the fact that the defendants' admitted\r\n\r\nagreement induced Hawkins to abandon his argument claiming Gryphon, Inc. as the true owner of the\r\n\r\nLadyHawk. (8)  The master, therefore, erred in applying the doctrine of judicial\r\nestoppel.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the master's judgment and remand the case for reconsideration of Hawkins'\r\n\r\nmotion to amend and, in the event the LadyHawk cannot be recovered, an appropriate determination of\r\n\r\ndamages.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., concur.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Although the underlying complaint is styled as a declaratory judgment action, it is actually an action to void a tax\r\n\r\nsale and as such is not transformed into one for declaratory judgment solely by invoking the Declaratory Judgment\r\n\r\nAct. See  Rush v. Thigpen, 231 S.C. 230, 98 S.E.2d 245 (1957) (finding action for trespass to try title was not\r\n\r\nchanged by being cast under declaratory judgment statute).  In addition, though the final rulings herein are set forth\r\n\r\nin \"order[s] of dismissal,\" the master clearly granted judgment to each defendant.  \r\n\r\n2.\r\n   This conclusion was based on Hawkins' evidence indicating title to the LadyHawk did not pass to him from\r\n\r\nGryphon, Inc. in 1992 because the bill of sale lacked his signature. \r\n\r\n  3.\r\n   Prior to trial the parties stipulated that the LadyHawk was in fact subject to Beaufort County property taxes for\r\n\r\nthe 1994 tax year.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n   Discovery was completed the weekend before trial.  Therein, Hawkins discovered a Bill of Sale from Bruno to\r\n\r\nTreasure Auto Sales of Miami, Florida, dated July 11, 1997. \r\n\r\n  5.\r\n   In arguing the tax sale of the LadyHawk was void, Hawkins had presented the 1992 bill of sale to the court as\r\n\r\nevidence that Gryphon, Inc. was the true owner of the vessel.  Although the Coast Guard re-documented the\r\n\r\nLadyHawk in Hawkins' name based on the bill of sale, Hawkins, as corporate officer of Gryphon, Inc., had printed\r\n\r\nhis name on the document but failed to affix his signature.  \r\n\r\n  6.\r\n   At the time of the levy against Hawkins, the statute required notice by \"certified mail, return receipt requested,\r\n\r\ndeliver to addressee only.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(b) (Supp. 1994).  The legislature amended this subsection in\r\n\r\n1998 to substitute \"restricted delivery\" for \"deliver to addressee only.\"  The meaning, however, remains the same.\r\nSee  In re Ryan Inv. Co., Inc., 335 S.C. 392, 517 S.E.2d 692 (1999). \r\n\r\n7.\r\n   At trial, counsel for Hawkins rebutted the defendants' judicial estoppel argument with the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[I]f we're going to have this argument made that Mr. Hawkins disclaimed ownership, the necessary consequence[] is\r\n\r\nGryphon is still the owner.  All we ask is that . . . Mr. Bruno's side not be able to have it both ways either.  I mean,\r\n\r\none person was the owner of the boat before the tax sale.  We're happy to agree it was Mr. Hawkins.  But if we're\r\n\r\ngoing to be told that it wasn't Mr. Hawkins, then we are entitled to make the argument that it was Gryphon.  One of\r\n\r\nthe two is all we ask.\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we can all agree that Allen Lee Hawkins is the real party in interest, that he was the owner before the tax sale\r\n\r\nand that he was the proper person to be sent notices.  And that if the tax sale was invalid, he's the person entitled to\r\n\r\nattempt to recover possession of the vessel.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel for Beaufort County assented and Bruno's counsel then stated:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL: Your Honor, I have no problem that Allen Lee Hawkins was the owner at the time that the property\r\n\r\nwas taxed and at the time of the tax sale but I have a problem because a Federal Court has already determined that\r\n\r\nafter that he was not-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT: I'm not concerned about that.  As long as you say you have no problem about it then, that's what I'm\r\n\r\nconcerned about.  Okay.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL: Right.  I have no problem with that.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT: Let's go forward then.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkins' counsel then replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.  And I think we probably ought to go ahead and put [into evidence] this certificate of documentation\r\n\r\nshowing Mr. Hawkins as the owner as of 1992.  So, could we mark that, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT: Without objection I assume.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY COUNSEL: No objection.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUNO COUNSEL: No objection, your Honor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis finding is supported by the defendants' appellate brief, in which they state: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[I]t is undisputed that the LadyHawk was subject to the assessment of 1994 personal property taxes.  It is also\r\n\r\nundisputed that since, at least, March 10, 1992, when Gryphon sold the LadyHawk back to Mr. Hawkins, both\r\n\r\nGryphon and Mr. Hawkins shared the Palmetto Bay [a]ddress[.]\r\n. . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bruno Yacht Sales] always took the position that Mr. Hawkins owned the LadyHawk in 1994 when the County\r\n\r\nassessed the personal property taxes at issue, as well as[] in 1995 when the County sent the notices to him and sold\r\n\r\nthe vessel at the October 1995[] delinquent tax sale. . . .  Obviously, there can be only one owner and [Bruno Yacht\r\n\r\nSales] asserted it was Mr. Hawkins.  \r\n\r\n8.\r\n   We note that if Hawkins' position from the Florida federal court had been accepted by the master, i.e., that\r\n\r\nGryphon, Inc. failed to transfer the LadyHawk back to Hawkins in 1992, then the tax sale was void ab initio because\r\n\r\nBeaufort County never sent Gryphon, Inc. any notice of the sale.  It is therefore not surprising that the defendants\r\n\r\nreadily conceded that Hawkins was the vessel's true owner at the time of the sale.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3232","title":"State v.

The trial\r\n\r\ncourt sentenced him to fifteen years and ten concurrent years respectively.  Sweet appeals.  We reverse\r\n\r\nand remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the late evening of January 1, 1998, or early morning hours of January 2, 1998, someone broke\r\n\r\ninto Andrew and Robin Caroll's home, removing  thousands of dollars worth of personal property.  The\r\n\r\nCarolls provided police with a list of items taken from the home.  Items taken from the home included a\r\n\r\nTV, a VCR, a CD player, a flute, a jewelry box, a cellular telephone, and two rings.  Officers recovered a\r\n\r\nCD player, a pearl flute, and a ring with several diamond stones from local pawn shops.  Angela Holliday\r\n\r\npawned the flute and ring.   Tina Verba pawned the CD player. When questioned by an investigator,\r\n\r\nHolliday and Verba confessed to the burglary and implicated Sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greenville County Grand Jury subsequently indicted Sweet on charges of first degree burglary and\r\n\r\ngrand larceny.  At Sweet's trial, Holliday and Verba testified they, along with Sweet, burglarized the\r\n\r\nCarolls' home.   They explained Sweet entered the home through a window and then opened the door. \r\n\r\nThey also claimed the three made several trips to the home.   Verba testified that between trips Sweet\r\n\r\ncalled the home using the cellular telephone to ensure no one was home before returning for another trip.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the items pawned by Verba and Holliday, the State introduced evidence Sweet pawned a\r\n\r\none-half karat marquise cut diamond ring on January 4.  However, the State offered no evidence that the\r\n\r\nring Sweet pawned matched any ring taken from the Carolls' home.   According to Verba and Holliday,\r\n\r\nthey and Sweet used the money from the pawn shops to buy drugs and alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet did not testify or call witnesses.  The jury convicted him of first degree burglary and grand larceny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Sweet raises three separate arguments, he primarily asserts the solicitor's closing argument\r\n\r\nshifted the burden of proof from the State to the defense by impermissibly commenting on his failure to\r\n\r\ntestify.  Thus, he maintains the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe challenged portion of the State's closing argument is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon sense would tell you that when you have two people that were there, nobody else knows what\r\n\r\nhappened that night except Tony Sweet and those two girls.  Those girls came in, they confessed, I mean,\r\n\r\ntheir testimony is now of record.  There is no way on earth for them to back out of the fact that they are\r\n\r\nguilty of these crimes.  They have confessed to you, to the Court, to everybody.   And as part of their\r\n\r\nconfession they told you that Tony Sweet was there.  Part of that statement has been corroborated.  They\r\n\r\ntold you about the cell phone calls, we got the cell phone statements in.  They told you the fact that Tony\r\n\r\ngot jewelry, we got jewelry that Tony pawned two days after the burglary.  There isn't any testimony that\r\n\r\nconflicts with those statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately following this comment, Sweet's counsel objected, stating, \"Your Honor, may we please\r\n\r\nregarding that comment?\"   The judge did not rule on the objection, but simply responded, \"I note your\r\n\r\nobjection.\"   Counsel then asked the court to also note the \"appropriate motion.\"   The judge then charged\r\n\r\nthe jury before allowing Sweet to more formally present his objection and motion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the judge stated on the record that he wanted to protect Sweet's counsel concerning his\r\n\r\nmotion.  The judge recognized that Sweet's counsel was \"going to argue the shifting of the burden of proof\r\n\r\nor a comment.\"  Sweet's counsel then argued his objection and requested a mistrial on the ground the\r\n\r\nsolicitor directly commented on Sweet's failure to testify.  The judge refused to immediately rule on the\r\n\r\nmotion until after the jury reached its verdict, making a mistrial an impossibility.  See Howell v. Davis,\r\n\r\n278 S.C. 510, 299 S.E.2d 336 (1983) (A mistrial cannot be granted after the jury reaches a verdict.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later, the judge held a hearing on the motion.  Because the jury had returned a verdict, Sweet's\r\n\r\ncounsel made a motion for a new trial on the same grounds asserted for the mistrial motion.  The judge\r\n\r\ndenied the motion.  He found there was evidence that implicated Sweet, in particular letters that Holliday\r\n\r\nand Sweet had written to each other.  The judge concluded this evidence combined with his \"strong\" jury\r\n\r\ninstruction which addressed a defendant's right not to testify was sufficient to cure any prejudice to Sweet.\r\nAs a threshold issue, we disagree with the State's contention that Sweet did not properly preserve this\r\n\r\nissue for appeal because Sweet failed to make a specific objection, because the motion for mistrial was not\r\n\r\ntimely, and because the trial judge never ruled on the objection or motion for a mistrial.  Sweet's counsel\r\n\r\nimmediately objected to the solicitor's comment and attempted to move for a mistrial.  Although he did not\r\n\r\nstate a specific objection, it is clear from the trial judge's comments he was aware of the grounds for the\r\n\r\nobjection.  Moreover, the judge's failure to immediately rule on the objection and motion deprived Sweet of\r\n\r\nan opportunity to present argument about the comment before the jury began deliberations. Accordingly,\r\n\r\nwe find the error is preserved.   See Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE (a party's objection must be accompanied with a\r\n\r\nspecific ground unless the specific ground is contextually apparent); see also State v. Holliday, 333 S.C.\r\n\r\n332, 509 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1998) (whether trial court erred in allowing solicitor to use defendant's post-arrest silence to impeach his testimony at trial was preserved for appellate review where trial court and\r\n\r\nattorneys discussed the issue and the trial court stated on the record that it understood defense counsel's\r\n\r\nobjection); cf. City of Columbia v. Myers, 278 S.C. 288, 294 S.E.2d 787 (1982) (issue of improper closing\r\n\r\nargument was preserved for appellate review despite failure of defense counsel to request curative\r\n\r\ninstruction, mistrial, or new trial after his objection had been overruled).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now analyze the merits of Sweet's appeal.  The appropriateness of a solicitor's closing argument is left\r\n\r\nlargely to the trial court's sound discretion, including the decision of whether to grant a defendant's motion\r\n\r\nfor mistrial. State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996).  Ordinarily, a trial court's rulings on\r\n\r\nclosing arguments will not be disturbed.  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997), cert.\r\n\r\ndenied, Patterson v. South Carolina, 522 U.S. 853 (1997).  Prosecutorial comment, whether direct or\r\n\r\nindirect, on the defendant's failure to testify is impermissible. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 (1965);\r\n\r\nState v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999).  Where the solicitor refers to certain evidence as\r\n\r\nuncontradicted and the defendant is the only person who could contradict that particular evidence, the\r\n\r\nstatement is viewed as a comment on the defendant's failure to testify. State v. Robinson, 238 S.C. 140,\r\n\r\n119 S.E.2d 671 (1961), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n315 (1991) (abolishing in favorem vitae review).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              In this case, the assistant solicitor stated only Sweet could rebut Verba and Holliday's testimony. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, he told the jury \"nobody else knows what happened that night except Tony Sweet and those\r\n\r\ntwo girls,\" and then stated \"[t]here isn't any testimony that conflicts with [the statements of the two girls].\" \r\n\r\nClearly, the comment referenced Sweet's failure to testify and was not merely a comment on the evidence.\r\n\r\nCf. State v. Rouse, 262 S.C. 581, 584-85, 206 S.E.2d 873, 874 (1974) (holding solicitor's closing argument\r\n\r\nstatement, \"As I stated earlier it is uncontradicted what happened in that store that day,\" did not\r\n\r\nconstitute a comment on defendant's failure to testify, given appellant's defense was alibi and the comment\r\n\r\ndid not state that it was uncontradicted as to appellant's participation in the events in question, but\r\n\r\nrather, simply referred to what actually took place); Robinson, 238 S.C. at 158-59, 119 S.E.2d at 680\r\n\r\n(where solicitor's closing remarks could have applied to evidence other than that which might have been\r\n\r\nintroduced on the defendant's behalf, trial judge did not err in refusing to grant defendant a new trial).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving determined the solicitor's closing argument constituted an impermissible comment on Sweet's\r\n\r\nfailure to testify, we must decide whether reversal of his conviction is warranted.  Although it is improper\r\n\r\nfor a solicitor to directly or indirectly comment on a defendant's failure to testify, such comments do not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mandate reversal of a conviction. Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  The\r\n\r\nappellant bears the burden of demonstrating the solicitor's words denied him a fair trial. Id.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, \"any alleged impropriety must be examined on appeal in light of the entire record.\" State v.\r\n\r\nBrown, 333 S.C. 185, 191, 508 S.E.2d 38, 41 (Ct. App. 1998).   A  criminal defendant is entitled to a fair\r\n\r\ntrial, not a perfect one. State v. Mizell, 332 S.C. 273, 504 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied (Apr. 12,\r\n\r\n1999).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe Sweet demonstrated the assistant solicitor's comments deprived him of a fair trial.  The State's\r\n\r\ncase against Sweet was far from overwhelming.  Although pawn tickets linked Verba and Holliday to the\r\n\r\ncrime, the only evidence of Sweet's involvement was the contradictory testimony of the confessed burglars. \r\n\r\nFor example, Holliday claimed she never went inside the Carolls' home, but remained outside as a lookout. \r\n\r\n Verba, however, testified all three entered the home and took property.   Holliday and Verba's claim that a\r\n\r\ncellular telephone taken from the home was used to place calls to the home was corroborated by telephone\r\n\r\nrecords, but their testimony that Sweet placed the calls was not.  The State also did not conclusively prove\r\n\r\nthe diamond ring that Sweet pawned was the same item taken from the Carolls' home.  Although Sweet\r\n\r\nwrote Holliday concerning an alibi, one of his letters appears to proclaim his innocence as do two letters\r\n\r\nHolliday wrote him.  Given that the State's case was not particularly strong, we cannot find the assistant\r\n\r\nsolicitor's comments harmless.  See Edmond v. State, Op. No. 25155 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 26, 2000)\r\n\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 26 at 1, 5) (\"[T]he admission of comments or evidence of the defendant's exercise\r\n\r\nof a constitutional right is a 'trial error' subject to harmless error analysis.\"); State v. Gaskins, 284 S.C.\r\n\r\n105, 326 S.E.2d 132 (1985) (the solicitor's comment, during closing argument, that certain evidence was\r\n\r\nundisputed because of the defendant's failure to testify was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt in\r\n\r\ncontext of entire record and in light of overwhelming evidence of guilt), cert. denied, Gaskins v. South\r\n\r\nCarolina, 471 U.S. 1120 (1985), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 315 (1991); see also State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 531, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1996) (For the error to\r\n\r\nbe harmless where a solicitor improperly comments on a defendant's failure to call witnesses, \"the record\r\n\r\nmust establish the reference to the defendant's right to silence was a single reference, which was not\r\n\r\nrepeated or alluded to; the solicitor did not tie the defendant's silence directly to his exculpatory story; the\r\n\r\nexculpatory story was totally implausible; and the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.\"). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, because the trial judge did not give an immediate curative instruction, this case is\r\n\r\ndistinguishable from those cases where a curative instruction given in conjunction with a general jury\r\n\r\ninstruction was sufficient to cure the improper comment on a defendant's failure to testify.  See State v.\r\n\r\nCooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999) (even if solicitor's closing comments referred to defendant's\r\n\r\nfailure to testify or present a defense, any prejudice to defendant was cured when trial judge gave a\r\n\r\ncurative instruction immediately following defense counsel's objection and charged the jury after closing\r\n\r\narguments that defendant did not have the burden of proving his innocence and the jury could not\r\n\r\nconsider defendant's failure to testify); see also State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619 (1984) (where\r\n\r\nsolicitor in his closing argument referred to the fact that neither defendant would testify, any prejudice to\r\n\r\ndefendants was cured when solicitor promptly apologized to the jury after defense counsel's objection and\r\n\r\nthe trial judge instructed the jury concerning the right of a defendant to remain silent and the State's\r\n\r\nburden of proof), cert. denied, Plath v. South Carolina, 467 U.S. 1265 (1984).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues, however, the trial judge cured any error through its general jury charge that the jury\r\n\r\ncould not consider Sweet's failure to testify against him.  Although a general jury instruction has been held\r\n\r\nto cure comments which arguably addressed the defendant's failure to testify in other cases, we disagree\r\n\r\nthat such a charge will always cure this type of violation or that it does so in this case.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the instant case distinguishable from cases where our Supreme Court has found a judge's general\r\n\r\ninstruction to the jury sufficient to cure the error.  In Johnson v. State, our Supreme Court considered a\r\n\r\nprosecutorial argument which arguably commented on the defendant's failure to testify. Johnson v. State,\r\n\r\n325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  The Court concluded that the solicitor's comment actually constituted\r\n\r\na statement on the evidence which was before the jury rather than a comment on the defendant's failure to\r\n\r\ntestify.  In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted the State's argument also specifically advised the jury\r\n\r\nit could not consider the defendant's failure to testify against him in any way. Id. at 187 n.1, 480 S.E.2d at\r\n\r\n735 n.1.  The Court went on to state that \"even assuming arguendo the comment was improper, we find\r\n\r\nthe trial court's instruction to the jury [at the close of the evidence] that it could not consider [the\r\n\r\ndefendant's] failure to testify in any way and could not use it against him sufficient to cure any potential\r\n\r\nerror.\" Id. at 188, 480 S.E.2d at 735-36.  Johnson is distinguishable from this case because here the\r\n\r\nchallenged argument clearly placed an adverse inference before the jury.  Moreover, unlike in Johnson,\r\n\r\nwhere the defense raised no objection, the comment in this case was immediately objected to and allowed\r\n\r\nto stand uncorrected in the jury's presence, thereby allowing the jury to perceive it met with judicial\r\n\r\napproval.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Irvin, the appellants challenged a portion of the State's closing argument as a comment on their\r\n\r\nfailure to testify. State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978).  At trial, the defense immediately\r\n\r\nobjected and moved for a mistrial.  The trial court denied the mistrial motion, but prevented the solicitor\r\n\r\nfrom continuing further in his argument.  At the defense's request, the court did not issue a curative\r\n\r\ninstruction.  The Supreme Court found the statement improper, but cured by the court's general jury\r\n\r\ncharge concerning the defendant's failure to testify, which was nearly identical to the one issued in this\r\n\r\ncase.  The Court went on to conclude the comment was \"isolated, indirect, and at best a reference not to\r\n\r\nappellants' failure to testify but to the lack of any evidence contradicting the testimony introduced by the\r\n\r\nState,\" and the jury charge negated any potential adverse inference. Id. at 544, 243 S.E.2d at 197.  Irvin is\r\n\r\ndistinguishable from the case at bar for several reasons.  First, the trial judge in Irvin sustained defense\r\n\r\ncounsel's objection by preventing the solicitor from continuing further in his argument, thus, conveying to\r\n\r\nthe jury the comment was improper.  Secondly, Irvin's counsel refused a curative instruction.  Finally,\r\n\r\nthere is a significant difference in the nature of the solicitors' comments in both cases.  In Irvin, the\r\n\r\nsolicitor's argument was an indirect comment.  In contrast, the solicitor in Sweet's case directly commented\r\n\r\non Sweet's failure to testify, specifically pointing out that only Sweet could contradict the statements of\r\n\r\nVerba and Holliday given they were the only individuals involved in the crime.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther cases refuse to hold that improper jury argument can be cured by a general instruction in the court's\r\n\r\ncharge to the jury where an immediate curative instruction was needed.  In State v. Pickens, the solicitor\r\n\r\nimpermissibly discussed the defendant's failure to present any witnesses. State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528,\r\n\r\n466 S.E.2d 364 (1996).  The trial court found the comment improper, but refused to give a curative\r\n\r\ninstruction because it did not want to amplify the error.  On review, our Supreme Court found the trial\r\n\r\ncourt erred by refusing to cure the problem and held its general charge, given a short time later, did not\r\n\r\ncure it.  In Huckaby v. State, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded the prosecutor's\r\n\r\ncomment to the jury on the defendant's failure to testify might have been cured by an immediate\r\n\r\nadmonishment, but that it could not be cured by \"the court's standard charge on the presumption of\r\n\r\ninnocence and the defendant's right to testify or not as he might choose.\" Huckaby v. State, 457 S.W.2d\r\n\r\n872, 874 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1970).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assistant solicitor's comment on Sweet's failure to testify should have been immediately addressed\r\n\r\nupon his objection either by the judge granting a mistrial or issuing a curative instruction.  Because the\r\n\r\nevidence in this case is less than overwhelming, we do not find the comment harmless.  Furthermore, the\r\n\r\ncourt's general charge to the jury on Sweet's right not to testify was insufficient to cure the error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, for the reasons discussed above, Sweet's convictions for first degree burglary and grand\r\n\r\nlarceny are \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3233","title":"Shirley v.

We affirm as\r\n\r\nmodified herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Shirley (the father) and Sheila Shirley (the mother) were divorced by order of the family court dated May 6, 1994. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the divorce decree, the mother was granted custody of the parties' two minor daughters, Amanda (born\r\n\r\nFebruary 24, 1987) and Tabitha (born June 19, 1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father instituted this action for a change of custody in January 1996.  The mother answered, admitting certain factual\r\n\r\nallegations made in the father's complaint, but denying he was entitled to a change of custody.  A guardian ad litem was\r\n\r\nappointed to represent the children pursuant to a consent order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the family court issued its order, leaving custody with the mother.  The court required the father to pay the\r\n\r\nmother's attorney's fees of $2,692.50 as well as the guardian ad litem's fees.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n\r\npreponderance of the evidence.  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 440 S.E.2d 884 (1994).  This broad scope of review,\r\n\r\nhowever, does not relieve the appellant of the burden of convincing us that the family court committed error. Skinner v.\r\n\r\nKing, 272 S.C. 520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979).  Nor are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard\r\n\r\nthe witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimonies.  Cherry\r\n\r\nv. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981).  Because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct\r\n\r\nobservation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial court findings where matters of credibility are involved. \r\n\r\nSee Aiken County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 403 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App. 1991).  \"This is especially true in\r\n\r\ncases involving the welfare and best interests of children.\" Id. at 93, 403 S.E.2d at 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Custody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father argues the family court erred in failing to grant him custody of the child.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the child's welfare and best interests.  Cook v. Cobb, 271\r\n\r\nS.C. 136, 245 S.E.2d 612 (1978).  In reaching a determination as to custody, the family court should consider how the\r\n\r\ncustody decision will impact all areas of the child's life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial,\r\n\r\nemotional, and recreational aspects.  Pountain v. Pountain, 332 S .C. 130, 503 S.E.2d 757 (Ct. App. 1998).  Additionally,\r\n\r\nthe court must assess each party's character, fitness, and attitude as they impact the child.  Id. at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760. \r\n\r\n\"There exist no hard and fast rules for determining when to change custody and the totality of the circumstances peculiar to\r\n\r\neach case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.\"  Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C.\r\n\r\n524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order for a court to grant a change of custody based on changed circumstances, the party seeking the change must meet\r\n\r\nthe burden of showing changed circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the order in question.  Baer v. Baer, 282\r\n\r\nS.C. 362, 318 S.E.2d 582 (Ct. App. 1984); see also Bolding v. Bolding, 278 S.C. 129, 130, 293 S.E.2d 699, 700 (1982) (\"In\r\n\r\norder to justify a change of custody, the party seeking the transfer bears the burden of establishing a material change of\r\n\r\nconditions substantially affecting the welfare of the child.\").  \"A change in circumstances justifying a change in the custody of\r\n\r\na child simply means that sufficient facts have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the child will be\r\n\r\nserved by the change.\" Pitt v.  Olds, 333 S.C. 478, ___, 511 S.E.2d 60,61(1999); see also Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520,\r\n\r\n523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892-93 (1979).  \"(T)he change of circumstance relied on for a change of custody must be such as\r\n\r\nwould substantially affect the interest and the welfare of the child, not merely the parties, their wishes or convenience\"\r\n\r\nSharpe v. Sharpe, 256 S.C. 517, 183 S.E.2d 325 (1971) (citing Ford v. Ford, 242 S.C. 344, 130 S.E.2d 916; Pullen v.\r\n\r\nPullen, 253 S.C. 123, 169 S.E.2d 376.)  The circumstances warranting a change in custody must occur after the date of the\r\n\r\noriginal custody order.  Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 510 S.E.2d 722(Ct. App. 1998).  Custody decisions are matters\r\n\r\nleft largely to the discretion of the trial court.  Stroman v. Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 353 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 1987). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that\r\n\r\nof the trial court.  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 471 S.E.2d 154 (1996). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Mother's Failure to Administer\r\nAppropriate Medication to the Children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father asserts the family court erred in failing to find that the mother's failure to properly administer medication to the\r\n\r\nchildren constituted a change of circumstances warranting a change of custody.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth children have epilepsy, which is controlled with anti-convulsive medication.  Dr. Jan Shaw, the children's treating\r\n\r\nneurologist, set the prescribed dosages at therapeutic levels established through medical testing.  She testified that lowering\r\n\r\nthe medication dosage could result in \"breakthrough\" seizures and she would be concerned if one of the parents lowered the\r\n\r\nmedication dosage without contacting her.  She further testified that possible side effects of the medication include\r\n\r\ndrowsiness, fatigue, stomachaches, difficulty with gait, and personality changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is uncontested the mother reduced Tabitha's dosage of the anti-convulsive medication on one occasion for a period of\r\n\r\nfifteen days.  The mother apparently made this decision because Tabitha was experiencing adverse side effects from the\r\n\r\nmedication, including difficulty staying awake in school.  The child did not suffer any breakthrough seizures during the time\r\n\r\nthe mother reduced her medication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father testified the mother failed, on a number of occasions, to make sure the children had adequate amounts of their\r\n\r\nmedication with them when they visited with him.  He stated he would at times be forced to get a prescription filled during\r\n\r\nhis visitation with the children.  Nonetheless, he opined it was the responsibility of the parent who had the children at the\r\n\r\ntime the medication ran out to get the prescriptions filled.  The mother denied the children were ever without medication. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family court noted the mother has resumed giving the child's normal dosage of medication and there is no evidence the\r\n\r\nchild was harmed due to the temporary reduction in the prescribed dosage.  The court observed the mother and father both\r\n\r\npurchased medication for the children and they are equally responsible the children's uninsured medical costs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we share in the father's concern regarding the mother's decision to temporarily reduce Tabitha's prescribed dosage of\r\n\r\nmedication, we do not feel her actions in doing so evidence an indifferent or neglectful attitude towards the children's\r\n\r\nmedical care.  Although ill-advised, the mother's decision to reduce the child's dosage was made with the child's well-being\r\n\r\nin mind.  Thus, while we strongly admonish the mother to refrain from adjusting the children's prescribed dosages of\r\n\r\nmedication without first consulting their treating physician, we find no error in the family court's determination the incident\r\n\r\ndoes not warrant a change of custody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, our reading of the record does not convince us the mother has intentionally failed to provide the children with\r\n\r\nadequate amounts of medication during visitation with the father. Rather, it appears the parties' difficulties result from a lack\r\n\r\nof communication and cooperation.  While we think the parties should coordinate their efforts to resolve their problems, we\r\n\r\ndo not think the circumstances warrant a change of custody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Dental Care\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father contends the mother has failed to provide the children with necessary dental care.  Specifically, the father refers to\r\n\r\nthe mother's failure to take one of the children to an appointment with the dentist and her refusal to follow the dentist's\r\n\r\nadvice.  He claims the children have developed gingivitis and pyorrhea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother acknowledged she missed one of Amanda's dental appointments.  However, she explained the father, who made\r\n\r\nthe appointment, informed her he made the appointment but did not notify her of the time and did not confirm it with her. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the mother admitted that despite the advice of the child's regular dentist, she did not want Tabitha's tooth pulled. \r\n\r\nShe explained two of the child's \"baby\" teeth had already been removed.  Although the mother did not allow the children's\r\n\r\nregular dentist to pull Tabitha's tooth, she did not withdraw the children from the dentist's care.  At trial, she explained that\r\n\r\nshe had scheduled appointments for the children with a different dentist concerning their dental care.  The father agreed the\r\n\r\nchildren's problems with gingivitis and pyorrhea have improved, and the mother testified she supervises their use of the\r\n\r\nmouthwash recommended by their dentist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our view, the record does not evidence an attitude of indifference on the part of the mother regarding the children's dental\r\n\r\ncare.  Although she disagrees with some of the dentist's recommendations, she has not withdrawn the children from his care. \r\n\r\nAs well, there is no evidence in the record that the children's dental problems have developed due to any fault or omission on\r\n\r\nthe mother's part.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Exposure of Children\r\nto Mother's Illicit Relationships\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother and Mr. Hardin dated for approximately six weeks in October or November of 1995.  During that time, Hardin\r\n\r\nspent the night at the mother's home while the children were present on numerous occasions.  The mother conceded that on\r\n\r\ntwo or three occasions, the mother, Hardin, and the children slept in the same bed.  On these occasions Hardin slept in a\r\n\r\nwarm up suit.  The children did not observe him in any state of undress and no sexual activity occurred in their presence. \r\n\r\nThe mother terminated her relationship with Hardin after her parents confronted her about allowing him to stay in the home\r\n\r\novernight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father attempted to establish the mother was also involved with George Wharton.  After he observed a red sports car\r\n\r\nparked in the mother's driveway, the father hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance.  The private investigator\r\n\r\ntestified he observed the mother's home from 3:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. on July 31, 1996.  Wharton's car was in the mother's\r\n\r\ndriveway during the surveillance, but the investigator did not observe any people.  The mother admitted she dated Wharton\r\n\r\nfor a time, but denied he ever spent the night at her home.  She stated Wharton had two cars, one of which he left in her\r\n\r\ndriveway for safekeeping when he moved to another state.  The Father's private investigator confirmed that Wharton had in\r\n\r\nfact moved out of state. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father offered evidence of the mother's involvement with a man named \"Tony.\"  The private investigator conducted\r\n\r\nsurveillance on the mother's home on September 5 and 6, 1996, in an attempt to gather evidence of Tony's presence at the\r\n\r\nhome.  The investigator observed a black car in the mother's driveway at 5:00 p.m. and again at 3:00 a.m.   At 6:17 a.m., he\r\n\r\nsaw a man come out of the mother's home and leave in the car.  Although he confirmed the mother was in the home by\r\n\r\ntelephoning her, the private investigator did not see the children at the home.  The mother admitted she dated Tony for a\r\n\r\ntime, but denied he ever spent the night in her home with the children present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family court noted: \"although [the mother] exposed the children to her relationship with Mr. Hardin, that relationship\r\n\r\nended and no such conduct occurred for over one year prior to trial.\" The morality of a parent is a proper consideration in\r\n\r\ndetermining child custody but it is limited in its force to what relevancy it has, either directly or indirectly, to the welfare of\r\n\r\nthe child.  Marshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 534, 540-41, 320 S.E.2d 44, 48 (Ct. App.1984); see also Clear v.  Clear, 331 S.C.\r\n\r\n186, 500 S.E.2d 790 (Ct.  App.  1998).  We defer to the family court on this credibility issue.  Irrefutably, the mother's\r\n\r\nconduct in allowing the parties' two daughters to sleep in the same bed as the mother and a man to whom she is not married\r\n\r\ndemonstrates poor parental judgment.  We admonish and strongly discourage the mother from exposing the children to\r\n\r\nher relationships in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.  Mother's Work Schedule\r\nand Child Care Arrangements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father maintains the family court should have ordered a change of custody based on his ability to provide the children a\r\n\r\nstructured and consistent routine.   He specifically directs our attention to testimony by the children's neurologist that the\r\n\r\nchildren need an established routine inasmuch as fatigue, missing meals, and stress can trigger seizures.  We find no error. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother's employment at Guardian Industries requires her to work a twelve-hour rotating shift.  She either works from\r\n\r\n7:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., or from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  She rotates from the day shift to the night shift every two weeks\r\n\r\non a set scheduled.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children's maternal grandmother cares for them while the mother works.  If the mother works during the day, she\r\n\r\ndelivers the children to the grandmother's home at 6:20 a.m., where they get in bed with the grandmother until they arise and\r\n\r\ndress for school.  The grandmother then takes the children to school and picks them up in the afternoon.  When the mother\r\n\r\nworks at night, she delivers the children to the grandmother at 6:30 p.m. and they spend the night at the grandmother's\r\n\r\nhome.  The children go to bed by 9:00 p.m. and sleep together in a downstairs bedroom during overnight stays with the\r\n\r\ngrandmother.  The grandmother helps the children dress and helps them with breakfast.  The mother arrives at 7:30 a.m. and\r\n\r\ntakes the children to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of trial, the father worked from 8:30 a.m. until 4:15 p.m. or, if overtime was required, until 8:00 p.m. (1)  The\r\n\r\nfather's wife arrives home between 5:30 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. each day.  The father's stepchildren attend a daycare facility. \r\n\r\nHis wife explained in the event custody of the children was awarded the father, they would be cared for by a third party for\r\n\r\npart of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother's employment provides her with a $2,604.67 monthly income.  Although she rotates shifts, her schedule is fixed\r\n\r\nand can be anticipated.  The maternal grandmother and grandfather live next door to the mother.  Our reading of the record\r\n\r\nconvinces us the grandmother provides the children with exemplary care during the time the mother works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the mother's work schedule is atypical, we agree with the family court's determination the mother's childcare\r\n\r\narrangements are appropriate and provide the children with the benefit of being cared for by family members.  The record is\r\n\r\ndevoid of evidence indicating the children have experienced any major difficulties in adjusting to their daily schedules.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there is no evidence the children 1) experience fatigue or stress, 2) miss meals, or 3) fail to get the proper\r\n\r\namount of rest due to their daily schedules.  We hold  neither the mother's work schedule, nor her child care arrangement,\r\n\r\nconstitute a change of circumstances warranting a change of custody. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE.  Children's Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father avers the mother has failed to cooperate with him in registering the children for school, has failed to share relevant\r\n\r\nschool information, and has caused the children to miss or limit their participation in extracurricular activities.  We disagree\r\n\r\nwith the father's characterization of the mother's behavior.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the parties experienced a degree of difficulty in registering the children for school, the testimony at trial reveals the\r\n\r\ndifficulties were the result of schedule conflicts between the mother and father and confusion as to the location and\r\n\r\nsufficiency of the children's  birth certificates and inoculation records.  To lay all blame for the delay in registering the\r\n\r\nchildren at the mother's feet is to distort the circumstances as evidenced by the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father testified on one occasion the mother failed to tell him to take one of the children to school early so that she could\r\n\r\nattend a field trip.  We believe the mother's failure in this regard was an isolated incident of oversight.  He professes the\r\n\r\nchildren have either missed or had their participation limited in extracurricular activities due to the actions of the mother. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, he cites testimony indicating the mother attended only a few of the children's T-ball games, the children missed\r\n\r\npractice while in the mother's care, and the mother took little initiative in getting the children involved in extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities.  The mother stated she attended T-ball games when her work schedule permitted her to do so, that the children\r\n\r\nmissed practice only due to illness, and that the children simply declined to participate in certain extracurricular activities.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the mother testified she attends PTA meetings, makes cupcakes for the children's classes, goes on field trips, makes\r\n\r\ncrafts for their teachers, and maintains calendars with notations of their activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother has not displayed disinterest in the children's educational or extracurricular activities.  To the contrary, the\r\n\r\nevidence suggests she is quite active in the children's school.  The mother appears active in the children's extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities to the extent possible given her work schedule.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father asserts the family court's order should be reversed and custody of the children awarded to him due to the family\r\n\r\ncourt's finding: \"no evidence was presented that Tabitha is in danger of academic failure.\"  He contends this finding is\r\n\r\nerroneous in light of the following statement contained in the neurologist's report: \"Per the teacher questionnaire Tabitha is\r\n\r\nnot working on grade level . . . She may need to repeat first grade next year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssuming the statement contained in the neurologist's report constitutes evidence that Tabitha was indeed in danger of\r\n\r\nacademic failure, we decline to reverse the family court's order on this ground.  Although there is evidence Tabitha\r\n\r\nexperiences some difficulty in school, nothing in the record convinces us the difficulties she experiences are due to any act or\r\n\r\nomission on the part of the mother.  Any error the family court committed in\r\nthis regard does not constitute reason to disturb\r\n\r\nthe court's determination of custody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father has expressed concern at the number of tardies and absences listed in the children's attendance records.  Amanda\r\n\r\nhad thirteen tardies for the period of August 1995 to March 1996.  Only one of those tardies was excused for medical\r\n\r\nreasons, the others were listed as unlawful.  Tabitha had only one tardy, which was unlawful, during the same period. \r\n\r\nHowever, she was absent on eleven occasions, and four were unexcused.  The father opines this behavior evidences a lack of\r\n\r\na stable and predictable routine, likely caused by the mother's shifting schedule.  We have concernment in regards to this\r\n\r\nschool attendance deficiency, but conclude the mother has instituted curative actions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF.  Consideration of Mother's Occupancy\r\nof Former Marital Home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining custody should remain with the mother, the family court reasoned, in part: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [mother] and the children reside in the former marital home.  The children have lived there all their lives. No one other\r\n\r\nthan the [mother] and children live in this home.  The home is spacious and each child has her own bedroom.  The home is in\r\n\r\ngood condition.  Several witnesses testified that the [mother] is an impeccable housekeeper and always maintains a clean and\r\n\r\norderly home.  The [mother] also works in her yard and keeps it in good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children continue to reside in the home they have lived in all their lives, and that home is appropriate for the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father argues the family court erred in placing significant emphasis on the mother's occupation of the former marital\r\n\r\nhome.  He maintains such reliance was misplaced \"given the [mother's] history of failing to pay insurance premiums and\r\n\r\nmortgage payments\" and because the mother \"lied under oath with regard to the mortgage payments owing on the former\r\n\r\nmarital home.\" (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe falsity of the mother's testimony is not, standing alone, sufficient reason to overturn the family court's decision as to\r\n\r\ncustody.  Although the father alleged in his post-trial motion he was served with pleadings in a foreclosure action on the\r\n\r\nformer martial home, he produced no documentation that the foreclosure action was prosecuted to its conclusion or that the\r\n\r\nmother and children have been displaced from the home.  Moreover, the father presented no evidence to contradict the\r\n\r\nmother's testimony that although she allowed her homeowner's insurance to lapse for a short period of time, no pecuniary or\r\n\r\nproperty loss occurred as a result of the lapse and she had obtained coverage with a different company by the time of trial. \r\n\r\nThe family court's consideration of the wife's occupancy of the former marital home was but one factor among many the\r\n\r\nfamily court considered in making its custody determination.  We decline to reverse the family court's decision on this basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Role of the Guardian ad Litem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guardian ad litem filed a separate brief in which she raised questions regarding the weight a trial judge should place on\r\n\r\nthe guardian's recommendation.  She argues the recommendation should be given substantial weight and should not be\r\n\r\nrejected without stating on the record or in the order the reasons for rejecting that recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court addressed the concerns raised by the guardian in her report and at trial.  Her main concerns centered on the\r\n\r\nrelationship the mother had with Mr.  Hardin and on the mother's reduction of Tabitha's medication.  The trial court noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Guardian ad Litem described the children as bright and beautiful young girls who love both parents.  The Guardian ad\r\n\r\nLitem recommended that the parties be granted joint custody of the children and that the children reside with the [father]\r\n\r\nduring the school year and with the [mother] during the summer months.  Her recommendation is based upon two primary\r\n\r\nconcerns.  The first is the [mother's] prior relationship with Mr.  Hardin.  The Guardian ad Litem believes the [mother]\r\n\r\nexercised poor judgment in having Mr.  Hardin overnight in her home in the presence of the children.  The Guardian ad\r\n\r\nLitem's second major concern is the children's medical condition.  She also believes the [mother] exercised poor judgment\r\n\r\nby reducing the dosage of Tabitha's Tegretol.  Dr.  Shaw testified that the children need structure in their lives to minimize\r\n\r\nthe adverse consequences of their epilepsy.  The Guardian ad Litem feels such structure will exist if her recommendation is\r\n\r\nfollowed by this court.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe role of the guardian ad litem in making custody recommendations is to aid, not direct, the court.  Ultimately, the custody\r\n\r\ndecision lies with the trial judge.  Clear v.  Clear, 331 S.C. 186, 191, 500 S.E.2d 790, 792 (Ct.  App.  1998); see Shainwald\r\n\r\nv. Shainwald, 302 S.C. 453, 395 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App.1990).  This court in Shainwald explicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think much of the criticism of guardians ad litem stems from the failure of the bar to recognize the proper function of a\r\n\r\nguardian ad litem.   A guardian ad litem is a representative of the court appointed to assist it in properly protecting the\r\n\r\ninterests of an incompetent person.  Dawson v. Garcia, 666 S.W.2d 254 (Tex.App.1984); Clarke v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust\r\n\r\nCo., 393 Ill. 419, 66 N.E.2d 378 (1946); In re Hallstead's Estate, 338 Pa. 257, 12 A.2d 912 (1940); see Blackwell v. Vance\r\n\r\nTrucking Co., 139 F.Supp. 103 (D.C. S.C.1956).   A statement made by the court in Bahr v. Galonski, 80 Wis.2d 72, 83,\r\n\r\n257 N.W.2d 869, 874 (1977), is instructive:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requirement that the children have independent legal representation does not in any way suggest that the parents or the\r\n\r\ntrial court were unmindful of the children's welfare.   Rather, it reflects the conviction that the children are best served by the\r\n\r\npresence of a vigorous advocate free to investigate, consult with them at length, marshal evidence, and to subpoena and\r\n\r\ncross-examine witnesses.  The judge cannot play this role.  Properly understood, therefore, the guardian ad litem does not\r\n\r\nusurp the judge's function; he aids it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold the extent to which a guardian ad litem is permitted to testify and give an opinion or recommendation in a child\r\n\r\ncustody case is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.   However, judges should be mindful of the duty of the guardian\r\n\r\nad litem to advocate and fully protect the interests of his ward. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShainwald v. Shainwald, 302 S.C. 453, 457, 395 S.E.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App.1990)    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family court judge adequately recognized the concerns of the guardian and came to a different conclusion.  Based on our\r\n\r\nreview of the record, the judge gave proper weight and consideration to the recommendation delivered by the guardian ad\r\n\r\nlitem and did not abuse his discretion in refusing to follow the recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  Attorney's and Guardian Ad Litem's Fees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father claims the family court erred in ordering him to pay the mother's attorney's fees because the mother did not\r\n\r\nrequest such relief in her pleadings. We hold the issue of attorney's fees was tried by consent inasmuch as the father\r\n\r\nconsented to a request by the mother's attorney, made at the conclusion of the trial, that both parties be allowed to submit\r\n\r\nattorney's fee affidavits.  See McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441, 447, 481 S.E.2d 166, 169 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"When issues not\r\n\r\nraised in the pleadings are tried by consent, they will be treated as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\");   see also  Rule\r\n\r\n15(b), SCRCP (\"When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be\r\n\r\ntreated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings ... [and] failure so to amend does not effect the result of the\r\n\r\ntrial of these issues.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father also contends the family court failed to give proper consideration to the factors relevant to awarding the wife\r\n\r\n$2,235.00 in attorney's fees.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn award of attorney's fees will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412,\r\n\r\n415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).  In awarding attorney's fees, the court should consider the parties' ability to pay their own\r\n\r\nfee, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the parties' respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on\r\n\r\neach party's standard of living.  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).  In determining the\r\n\r\namount of attorney's fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the\r\n\r\ntime necessarily devoted to the case, counsel's professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results\r\n\r\nobtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315\r\n\r\n(1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the award of attorney's fees in light of the applicable factors.  Under the facts and circumstances of this\r\n\r\ncase, particularly the mother's successful defense of the action and the father's superior income, we find no abuse of\r\n\r\ndiscretion in the award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFather also contends the family court abused its discretion in ordering him to pay the entire balance of $813.25 for guardian\r\n\r\nad litem fees.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn award of guardian ad litem fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n\r\nabsent an abuse of discretion.  Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 520, 381 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 1986).  Although the mother\r\n\r\nultimately obtained beneficial results in this action, this is only one factor we consider when allocating an award of guardian\r\n\r\nad litem fees.  In the present case, the father had legitimate reasons for bringing this action.  His genuine concern for his\r\n\r\ndaughters' welfare necessitated the appointment of a guardian.  Furthermore, the recommendations of the guardian ad litem\r\n\r\nsupported a change in custody to the father.  Therefore, we find the family court abused its discretion in determining the\r\n\r\nfather should pay the entire amount of guardian ad litem fees.  We conclude the father and the mother should bear an equal\r\n\r\nburden in the assessment of guardian ad litem fees and thus modify the family court order to allocate fifty per cent of the\r\n\r\nguardian ad litem fees against each party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold there are no changes in the circumstances of the parties sufficient to warrant a change in the custody of the children. \r\n\r\nWe do find cause for concern in some of the actions of the mother, but we feel these are not illustrative of a continuing\r\n\r\npattern of disinterest or neglect of her children.  We rule the family court judge properly considered the concerns of the\r\n\r\nguardian ad litem, and find no abuse of discretion in refusing to follow her recommendation.  We conclude the award of\r\n\r\nattorney's fees to the mother was appropriate and not an abuse of discretion.  However, we determine the father and the\r\n\r\nmother should each bear an equal burden of the guardian ad litem fees.  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family\r\n\r\ncourt is \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.     According to his post-trial motion for reconsideration, the father now works for twelve hours on Friday night and twelve hours on Saturday\r\n\r\nnight, and is free during the remainder of the week.\r\n\r\n2.    At trial, the mother testified the mortgage payments on the home were current as of April 1997.

Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial \r\n  court denied Bower's request for reformation and granted summary judgment to \r\n  National General. Bower appeals. We reverse and remand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 1997, Jason Bower, while a passenger \r\n  in someone else's car, was injured in a wreck. The owner of the car in which \r\n  Bower was riding did not have UIM coverage. Bower, living with his father Robert \r\n  at the time of the accident, filed a claim for UIM coverage with his father's \r\n  insurance carrier, National General. National General denied the claim, asserting \r\n  Robert Bower had rejected its offer of UIM coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJason Bower subsequently filed this action \r\n  alleging National General failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage. \r\n  Based on this alleged failure, Bower sought reformation of the policy to include \r\n  UIM coverage up to the policy's limits of $100,000 per person, $300,000 per \r\n  occurrence, and $50,000 for property damage. The case was referred to a master-in-equity \r\n  with appeal directly to the Supreme Court. The master concluded National General \r\n  made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage that was rejected by Robert Bower and \r\n  granted summary judgment to National General. Bower appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to South Carolina Code section 38-77-160, \r\n  automobile insurers must \"offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage . . . .\" \r\n  S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. 1999). To fulfill this statutory obligation, \r\n  an insurer's offer of UIM coverage must be \"meaningful.\" State \r\n  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 \r\n  (1987). In order to constitute a meaningful offer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the insurer's notification process must \r\n  be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the insurer must \r\n  specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage \r\n  in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the \r\n  nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be told that optional \r\n  coverages are available for an additional premium. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556. When offering optional coverages, the insurer must \r\n  offer UIM coverage in any amount up to the policy limits. Todd \r\n  v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 305 S.C. 395, 409 S.E.2d 361 (1991) (emphasis \r\n  added).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insurer bears the burden of establishing \r\n  it made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage. Butler \r\n  v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996). If an insurer \r\n  fails to make a meaningful offer, the policy will be reformed by operation of \r\n  law to include UIM coverage up to the limits of liability insurance carried \r\n  by the insured. Id. It is irrelevant \r\n  that the insured rejects UIM coverage, as a \"noncomplying offer has the legal \r\n  effect of no offer at all.\" Hanover \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57, 389 S.E.2d 657, 659 \r\n  (1990). The question of whether an offer of UIM coverage is sufficient is a \r\n  question of law for the court. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present case, Bower contends National \r\n  General failed to satisfy the fourth element of the Wannamaker \r\n  test because its offer did not inform him of the right to select optional coverages \r\n  not listed on its form. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational General's offer form contained the \r\n  following language:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a right . . . to buy underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage in limits up to the limits of liability coverage you will \r\n  carry under your automobile insurance policy. The limits of underinsured motorist \r\n  coverage . . . are shown upon this Form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form then identified three choices of \r\n  both bodily injury and property damage UIM coverages equal to or less than Bower's \r\n  liability limits. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Wilkes \r\n  v. Freeman, 334 S.C. 206, 512 S.E.2d 530 (Ct. App. 1999), cert. \r\n  denied (August 23, 1999), this \r\n  Court addressed similar language in the context of whether an insured made a \r\n  meaningful offer. In Wilkes, \r\n  the insurer's offer form stated: \"[A]ll of the limits of underinsured motor \r\n  vehicle coverage we sell, together with the additional premiums you will be \r\n  charged, are shown on this form.\" Id. \r\n  at 208, 512 S.E.2d at 531. The policy then listed three UIM coverage options \r\n  that were equal to or less than Wilkes' liability limits. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a meaningful offer had been made, this Court recognized that an offer of UIM\r\n\r\n\"must contain language describing how the insured may request coverage 'up to' his liability limits, but\r\n\r\ndifferent from those amounts listed on the insurer's form.\"  Id. at 212, 512 S.E.2d at 533 (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe Court stated \"merely listing several available options without providing a clear description on how the\r\n\r\napplicant may request other limits is insufficient to discharge the insurer's  duty under section 38-77-160.\" \r\n\r\nId. at 211-12, 512 S.E.2d at 533.  The Court then held that the insurer failed to make a meaningful offer\r\n\r\nwhen it provided no indication that the insured could have requested coverage amounts other than those\r\n\r\namounts listed on the form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile National General's form does state that \r\n  the insured is entitled to purchase UIM insurance in amounts up to the liability \r\n  limits, that statement is immediately followed by language indicating that the \r\n  available limits are those identified on the form. This language can be fairly \r\n  construed as an offer to purchase only those coverage amounts identified \r\n  on the form so long as none of the amounts exceed the insured's current liability \r\n  limits. See Yarborough \r\n  v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 225 S.E.2d 344 (1976) (\"It \r\n  is well settled that in construing an insurance contract, all of its provisions \r\n  should be considered . . . . Presumably, all portions of a contract are inserted \r\n  for a purpose and the contract must be read as a whole, giving appropriate weight \r\n  to all provisions.\"); Diamond State \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., 318 S.C. 231, 456 S.E.2d 912 (1995) (noting \r\n  that to the extent there are conflicting or ambiguous provisions, we must construe \r\n  the language in favor of coverage). \r\n  Had National General intended the listed coverages to be mere examples of available \r\n  coverages or the most common coverages chosen, it certainly could have said \r\n  so. (2)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational General contends that the case at \r\n  bar is controlled by Norwood v. Allstate \r\n  Insurance Co., 327 S.C. 503, 489 S.E.2d 661 (Ct. App. 1997). We disagree. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Norwood, \r\n  this Court held that where an offer form listed at least three specific options \r\n  of UIM coverage below Norwood's liability limits, coupled with plain language \r\n  notifying her that she could increase or decrease her UIM coverage, the requirements \r\n  of section 38-77-160 were satisfied. The form in Norwood, \r\n  however, unlike the form in this case or in Wilkes, \r\n  gave no indication that the coverages listed were the only options offered. \r\n  Moreover, Norwood understood that the options listed were not the only coverages \r\n  available, as she struck through one of the listed policy amounts for uninsured \r\n  (UM) coverage and wrote in a different amount not on the form. The Court noted \r\n  that the instructions for selecting UM and UIM coverages were \"practically identical.\" \r\n  Id. at 507, 489 S.E.2d at 663.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause Robert Bower was not apprised of his \r\n  right to choose any amount of UIM coverage, including coverages not listed on \r\n  the form, National General failed to make a meaningful offer. Accordingly, we \r\n  reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of National General and remand \r\n  to the trial court for entry of summary judgment in favor of Bower and reformation \r\n  of the contract up to the liability limits. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., concurs. GOOLSBY, \r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting): \r\n  I believe Bower failed to show the trial court committed reversible error in \r\n  holding the offer of underinsured (UIM) coverage at issue here was legally sufficient. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina Code section 38-77-160, \r\n  automobile insurers must offer, at the insured's option, UIM coverage \"up to \r\n  the limits of the insured liability coverage . . . .\" (3) \r\n  The form to be used in offering such coverage must include, among other things, \r\n  \"a list of available limits and the range of premiums for the limits.\" \r\n  (4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has adopted the following \r\n  criteria for determining whether an insurer has made a meaningful offer of UIM \r\n  coverage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the insurer's notification process must \r\n  be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the insurer must \r\n  specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage \r\n  in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the \r\n  nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be told optional coverages \r\n  are available for an additional premium. (5) \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the insurer fails to make a meaningful \r\n  offer of UIM coverage, the policy is subject to reformation to include UIM coverage \r\n  up to the insured's liability limits. (6) In \r\n  this case, Bower argues National General failed to meet the fourth requirement \r\n  in that it should have explicitly informed his father that optional coverages \r\n  other than those shown on the form were available. I disagree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Wilkes \r\n  v. Freeman, (7) this court further clarified \r\n  the criteria for a meaningful offer of UIM coverage and held, \"An insurer's \r\n  form offering UIM coverage to a new applicant must contain language describing \r\n  how the insured may request coverage 'up to' his liability limits, but different \r\n  from those amounts listed on the insurer's form.\" (8) \r\n  In so holding, this court further stated, \"[M]erely listing several available \r\n  options without providing a clear description on how the applicant may request \r\n  other limits is insufficient to discharge the insurer's duty under section 38-77-160.\" \r\n  (9)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBower submits National General's form is legally \r\n  deficient because it does not \"offer any selection of the optional coverages \r\n  in a manner consistent with South Carolina law.\" In support of his position, \r\n  he cites a sample form developed by the South Carolina Department of Insurance \r\n  that states, \"If there are other limits in which you are interested, but which \r\n  are not shown upon this form, then fill in those limits.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational General's form, however, did not \r\n  necessarily have to duplicate the sample form approved by the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Insurance in order to constitute a meaningful offer of UIM coverage. \r\n  In a 1989 memorandum to all licensed carriers transacting automobile insurance \r\n  business in South Carolina, the Chief Insurance Commissioner characterized the \r\n  sample form as a \"suggested\" form and expressly stated that \"any insurance carrier \r\n  may draft its own version of this form and submit that form to me for my prior \r\n  approval.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in Norwood \r\n  v. Allstate Insurance Company, (10) this \r\n  court held an insurer had made a valid offer of UIM coverage because the insured \r\n  was both advised that she could purchase UIM coverage \"up to\" her liability \r\n  limits and instructed on how to increase or decrease this coverage. I see no \r\n  meaningful factual distinctions between Norwood \r\n  and the present case. The form at issue here advises the insured of \"a right \r\n  to buy underinsured motorist coverage in limits (11) \r\n  up to the limits of liability you will carry under your automobile insurance \r\n  policy.\" In addition, the language in National General's form instructing the \r\n  insured on how to increase or decrease UIM coverage is almost identical to that \r\n  appearing on the form in Norwood. \r\n  (12) Contrary to Bower's argument, then, the absence of an explicit \r\n  instruction by an insurer that an insured may purchase UIM coverage in limits \r\n  other than those shown on the form does not give rise to a genuine issue of \r\n  material fact as to whether the insurer's offer of such coverage is meaningful. \r\n  (13)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would affirm. \r\n\r\n1.   National General's form failed to list UIM coverage amounts of 15,000/30,000/5,000, even though National General was\r\n\r\nauthorized to sell those amounts.\r\n\r\n2.   In fact, National General's form once contained language stating that other coverage limits were available but not shown\r\n\r\nupon the form.  National General, however, elected to delete that language.\r\n\r\n3.   S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. 1999).\r\n\r\n4.   S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A)(2) (Supp. 1999). \r\n\r\n5.

By way of distinction, I note the analogous provision on the form concerning uninsured motorist (UM) coverage provides the\r\n\r\ninsured may increase UM coverage \"in various limits\" up to the limits of liability coverage. \r\n\r\n12.   A copy of the written offer of UIM coverage appearing in the record in Norwood was made a part of the record in the present case. \r\n\r\nThat offer stated in pertinent part:  \"In the future, if you wish to . . . increase or decrease your limits for underinsured motorist coverage,\r\n\r\nyou then must contact either your insurance agent or your insurance company.  You will not be presented with another copy of this Form\r\n\r\nunless you request it.\"  The written offer in the present case reads in pertinent part:  \"In the future, if you wish to increase or to decrease\r\n\r\nyour limits of . . . underinsured coverage, you must then contact your insurance company.  You will not be presented with another copy\r\n\r\nof this form by your insurance company upon renewal of your automobile liability insurance policy.\" As the master noted, the only\r\n\r\nmaterial difference between the form in the present case and that in Norwood is that, instead of the check-off blocks that appear in the\r\n\r\nNorwood form, National General's form had blanks for the insured to write in the desired limits.  I agree with the master that this\r\n\r\ndifference actually makes National General's form more \"insured friendly\" than that in Norwood.  See Rabb v. Catawba Ins. Co., ___\r\n\r\nS.C. ___, 528 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding a form that presented a number of split limit and single limit UIM coverage amounts\r\n\r\nand their accompanying premium costs and provided blanks for different coverage amounts and premiums constituted a meaningful offer\r\n\r\nof UIM coverage).\r\n\r\n13.   Bower also argues National General's form gives the impression the insured cannot choose any coverage limits other than those\r\n\r\nappearing on the form.  Specifically, he notes the following language on the form:  \"The limits of underinsured motorist coverage,\r\n\r\ntogether with the additional premium you will be charged, are shown upon this Form.\"  Bower also suggests that a letter from National\r\n\r\nGeneral to the Insurance Commission in which National General admitted it had deleted references to coverage limits available but not\r\n\r\nshown on the form and had included \"all limits available\" is evidence that National General deliberately failed to advise his father of the\r\n\r\navailability of other possible limits of UIM coverage.  Although the master referenced these facts in the appealed order, he made no\r\n\r\nexplicit ruling concerning their impact on the overall validity of National General's offer of UIM coverage.  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304\r\n\r\nS.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991) (holding that, when the trial court does not explicitly rule on a question and the appellant fails to move\r\n\r\nunder Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to amend or alter the judgment on that ground, the issue is not properly before the court of appeals and\r\n\r\nshould not be addressed); Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 225 S.E.2d 344 (1976) (stating that, in determining\r\n\r\nthe rights and obligations of the parties to a contract of insurance, the contract must be read and interpreted as a whole).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3235","title":"Welch v.

Welch, Jr.  The jury awarded\r\n\r\nactual damages of $28,535.88 in the survival suit, $3,000,000 in the wrongful death claim, and punitive damages of\r\n\r\n$3,900,000.  After the verdict, the judge issued an order entering a partial set-off against the verdicts based upon a\r\n\r\nsettlement with a prior defendant.  Cross appeals have been filed.  Dr. Franklin Epstein and Southern Neurologic Institute\r\n\r\n(hereafter, collectively referred to as Dr. Epstein) raise issues concerning (1) the denial of their motions for directed verdict\r\n\r\nand judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV); (2) the denial of their new trial motion based upon the excessiveness of\r\n\r\nthe actual and punitive damages verdicts; and (3) the jury charge on punitive damages. (1)  The personal representative,\r\n\r\nKimberly Johnson Welch, challenges the set-off order.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarshall O. Welch, Jr. (Welch) was a thirty-seven year old registered nurse employed by Southern Neurologic Institute.  He\r\n\r\nworked for Dr. Franklin Epstein, a board certified neurosurgeon, who practiced at Southern Neurologic Institute along with\r\n\r\nDr. Martin Greenberg.  Welch assisted Dr. Epstein for almost three years in the care of surgical patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWelch suffered from severe back pain, which began between 1990 and 1992.  Dr. Epstein characterized it as an  \"unrelenting\r\n\r\nbackache.\"  According to Dr. Epstein, Welch initially went to Dr. Greenberg about the problem because \"being a stoic, [he]\r\n\r\ndidn't want to let on to me directly that he was needing something.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June or July of 1995, Welch was taking a significant amount of prescribed pain medication, including Tylox and Vicodin. \r\n\r\nWelch might also have been using sample pain medication from the drug cabinet at Southern Neurologic Institute.  Even\r\n\r\nwith this medication, the pain was very severe.  Dr. Greenberg stated he did not know how Welch continued to work. \r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of 1995, Welch's pain worsened.  Dr. Greenberg recommended surgery.  Welch consulted Dr. Melvyn\r\n\r\nHaas, a neurologist, for a second opinion in February of 1996.  Dr. Haas agreed surgery was indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surgery involved a neurological and an orthopedic component.  The orthopedic procedure would result in blood loss. \r\n\r\nDr. Epstein declared Welch was adamant he did not want a transfusion unless there was no alternative.  As a result, a cell\r\n\r\nsaver was used during the surgery to \"save [Welch] from getting donor blood by using [his] own blood.\"  A cell saver is a\r\n\r\nmachine which processes blood lost from a patient during surgery.  The plasma and platelets are washed out and the packed\r\n\r\nred cells are returned for use in the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Thursday, February 22, 1996, Welch was admitted to the Aiken Regional Medical Center.  At admission,\r\n\r\nhis blood pressure was 126 over 72; temperature was 97.4; pulse was 71; and respiration was 18.  His pre-operative\r\n\r\nhemoglobin was 14.4 and hematocrit was 42.  Hemoglobin is a pigment within a red blood cell that carries the oxygen\r\n\r\nmolecule.  Hematocrit refers to the percentage of total blood volume that consists of red blood cells.  Welch's estimated\r\n\r\nblood volume was 5,852 cc's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein was the attending neurosurgeon assisted by Dr. Greenberg.  There is no issue concerning Dr. Epstein's\r\n\r\nperformance of the neurosurgery.  Henry Holsenback, a registered nurse anesthetist, administered the anesthesia to Welch\r\n\r\nand monitored his vital signs.  Welch received approximately 2,500 cc's of fluid and 625 cc's of  blood cells from the cell\r\n\r\nsaver.  Holsenback estimated that during the surgery Welch had a blood loss of 2,000 cc's, which is normal for this type of\r\n\r\nfusion back surgery.  Mary Ann Camp, the operator of the cell saver, noted a net blood loss of 2,000 cc's during surgery and\r\n\r\nanother 100 cc's of blood lost from the time Welch left the operating room until Camp hooked up the hemovac in the\r\n\r\nrecovery room.  A hemovac is a machine which pumps blood and other liquids from a wound or surgical site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the surgery, Holsenback applied a 50 micrograms per hour Fentanyl transdermal patch to Welch as ordered by Dr.\r\n\r\nEpstein for post-op pain control.  Fentanyl, a narcotic analgesic, is a very strong pain reliever.  It is fifty to one hundred\r\n\r\ntimes as potent as morphine.  A transdermal patch is designed to mimic an infusion or to drip medication into the patient's\r\n\r\nbody so as to deliver the medication over a long period of time.  Although not charted,  Holsenback asserted the patch came\r\n\r\noff and was missing when the sterile drapes were removed from Welch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaurel Phillips, a recovery room nurse, charted a total \"red drainage\" into the hemovac of 300 cc's.  Welch's heart rate\r\n\r\nelevated from 80 to 115 beats per minute.  Phillips contacted the anesthesiologist, who ordered a complete blood count\r\n\r\n(CBC) and 500 cc's of Hespan, a volume expander.  The lab report indicated a hemoglobin of 12 and a hematocrit of 33.2. \r\n\r\nWelch complained of pain and received 2.5 milligrams of Dilaudid, 25 milligrams of Phenergan, and 1 milligram of Valium. \r\n\r\nDilaudid is a narcotic analgesic.  Phenergan prevents nausea and is a mild anti-anxiety agent.  Valium is an anti-anxiety agent. \r\n\r\nAnother 50 microgram Fentanyl patch was applied pursuant to Dr. Epstein's orders to replace the patch which had fallen off. \r\n\r\nWelch was discharged to the floor.  At that time, his pulse rate was 120 and respirations were 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day, Friday, February 23, drainage from the hemovac was measured at 385 cc's.  Welch's hemoglobin level on\r\n\r\nFriday morning was 8.6.  His hematocrit was 24.6.  When Dr. Epstein saw Welch on Friday, Welch was puffy and pasty\r\n\r\nlooking, which is not unusual for someone who has just had major surgery.  He was aware of the hemoglobin level, but\r\n\r\nexpected the drop due to dilution from fluids received during surgery and in the recovery room.  Dr. Epstein claimed Welch\r\n\r\nwas fluid overloaded, not fluid depleted.  Dr. Epstein knew Welch was receiving a lot of pain medication.  During that day,\r\n\r\nWelch received six injections of Dilaudid, four injections of Phenergan, and a dosage of Valium by mouth.  Further, he was\r\n\r\nreceiving 50 micrograms of Fentanyl hourly from the patch.  Dr. Epstein computed the combined pain medication on Friday\r\n\r\nequaled ten milligrams of morphine per hour.  Yet, Dr. Epstein did not feel Welch was seriously volume depleted or over\r\n\r\nmedicated.  In addition, he did not believe the hemoglobin decrease was causing a problem as Welch was not short of breath,\r\n\r\nhad no chest pain, good mental status, and good urine output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, February 24, Darlene Colvin was the charge nurse on Welch's floor during the 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. shift. \r\n\r\nApproximately 100 cc's of drainage was charted before the hemovac was removed at 7:44 a.m.  Colvin noted a morning\r\n\r\nhemoglobin level of 6.9, which was rechecked and reported as 6.6.  Dr. Epstein called in that morning and Colvin advised\r\n\r\nhim of the hemoglobin level.  According to Dr. Epstein, the hemoglobin level was getting close to the 6.0 trigger point for\r\n\r\ntransfusion, but he was aware of Welch's desire not to have transfusions.  Since Welch had a normal blood pressure, was\r\n\r\nalert, and urinating, Dr. Epstein decided to wait and re-check the hemoglobin later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Melvyn Haas was taking calls for Dr. Epstein on Saturday.  Dr. Haas found Welch alert and oriented, but with a\r\n\r\ntemperature.  Dr. Haas noted the hemoglobin level was \"strikingly low\" in comparison to the pre-op level.  He talked to\r\n\r\nWelch about the possible need for a transfusion.  Welch indicated he did not want one because of the risks.&nbsp; Based upon the\r\n\r\npresence of a fever and his conversation with Welch, Dr. Haas ordered a CBC and an \"H and H,\" a hemoglobin and\r\n\r\nhematocrit check.  Dr. Haas felt he had an agreement from Welch that if the hemoglobin level went any lower, Welch would\r\n\r\nreceive a couple of units of packed red blood cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Dr. Greenberg saw Welch while he was on the floor checking another patient.  Dr. Greenberg ordered\r\n\r\nValium for Welch's back spasms.  Around 4:20 p.m., Dr. Haas called to check on Welch's lab results.  The hemoglobin level\r\n\r\nwas 6.5 and Welch still had a fever.  Dr. Haas ordered two blood cultures and a transfusion of two units of packed blood\r\n\r\ncells.  In her nurse's progress notes, Colvin wrote that Dr. Greenberg called the hospital at approximately 4:45 p.m. in\r\n\r\nresponse to Welch \"beep[ing] him.\"  Dr. Greenberg was notified of Welch's increasing temperature, his hemoglobin level of\r\n\r\n6.5, and Dr. Haas' transfusion order.  According to Colvin's notes, Dr. Greenberg agreed Welch needed a transfusion.  Dr.\r\n\r\nGreenberg denied making that statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5:30 p.m., Darlene Colvin called Dr. Epstein at home because Welch had asked her to contact him regarding Dr. Haas'\r\n\r\ntransfusion order.  Colvin's progress note reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein not on call this weekend, but I attempted to reach him.  I phone[d] his home and notified Dr. Epstein of\r\n\r\n[Welch's] condition.  Notified that Dr. Haas had given orders to transfuse [two] units of packed cells for [hemoglobin] of\r\n\r\n6.5.  Also notified that [Welch] had develop[ed] puffiness to the [left] side of incision that was soft.  Informed of [Welch's]\r\n\r\nincreasing temp[erature] with [no] response to Tylenol.  Notified Dr. Epstein that [Welch] was very rigid and [complaining\r\n\r\nof] discomfort to the groin area.  Dr. Epstein gave order to not transfuse [Welch] and to stop drawing labs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physician's order form indicates a phone order at 5:30 p.m. from Dr. Epstein per Darlene Colvin as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Cancel transfusion; (2) Cancel all labs; (3) Increase Fentanyl patch to 100 micrograms; (4) Valium, 5 milligrams, PO\r\n\r\nevery eight hours; (5) Compazine, 10 milligrams, PO every six to eight hours as needed; (6) Colace, 100 milligrams, PO,\r\n\r\nBID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein recalled the telephone conversation with Darlene Colvin.  He believed the slight drop in the hemoglobin level\r\n\r\nwas within an accepted error margin.  Dr. Epstein decided to \"hold off on\" the transfusion because Welch was thinking\r\n\r\nclearly, urinating, and had a stable blood pressure.  He instructed Colvin to increase the dosage of the Fentanyl by adding a\r\n\r\nsecond patch because of the regularity with which Welch was asking for additional pain medication.  Dr. Epstein did not do a\r\n\r\nblood culture for the fever because he was unconcerned with the presence of a fever a few days after surgery.  The additional\r\n\r\nFentanyl patch was not immediately applied by the nursing staff because Welch received injections of Dilaudid and\r\n\r\nPhenergan at 5:40 p.m. and was resting comfortably.  As charge nurse, Darlene Colvin agreed with this nursing decision by\r\n\r\nWelch's primary care nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 6:25 p.m., Dr. Haas called to check on the transfusion and lab results.  Darlene Colvin advised him that Dr. Epstein\r\n\r\nhad canceled the orders.  Dr. Haas then ordered a hemoglobin check and CBC to be performed at 8:00 p.m.  He asked to be\r\n\r\nnotified if the hemoglobin level decreased below 6.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring her Saturday shift, Colvin did not observe any indication of hypoventilation in Welch, but he was tachycardic. \r\n\r\nHypoventilation refers to depressed respiration, a slower than normal breathing rate.  Tachycardia, an abnormally rapid\r\n\r\nheartbeat, is a sign of blood loss.  Between 2:20 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, Welch received five injections of Dilaudid,\r\n\r\nthree injections of Phenergan, and two doses of Valium by mouth.  This was in addition to the Fentanyl patch of 100\r\n\r\nmicrograms, which was given at 10:15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSherryl Brooks Scott was the charge nurse for Welch's floor on the 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shift on Saturday night.  Scott\r\n\r\nwas working with Deborah Cole, a senior L.P.N. and the primary care nurse for Welch.  Around 8:30 p.m., Welch was given\r\n\r\nadditional Dilaudid and Phenergan and was resting comfortably.  Because of this, during the early evening hours, Scott and\r\n\r\nCole made a nursing decision not to apply the Fentanyl patch which Dr. Epstein had ordered at 5:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 8:00 p.m, blood was drawn for the lab work ordered by Dr. Haas.  A report of a hemoglobin level of 6.0 was received\r\n\r\naround 10:00 p.m.  About that time, Dr. Haas called to check on the lab results as he had not yet been notified.  Upon being\r\n\r\nadvised of the result, Dr. Haas told the nurse to call Dr. Epstein and see what he wanted to do.  Dr. Haas felt a transfusion\r\n\r\nwas required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScott \"beeped\" Dr. Epstein.  When Dr. Epstein called in, he spoke with Scott and Cole.  Scott's progress note provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein answered his page and was informed of [patient's hemoglobin] being 6.0 and was informed that Fentanyl patch\r\n\r\nwas held at this time due to [patient] being comfortable and sleeping but easily aroused.  Dr. Epstein ordered for 3 units of\r\n\r\nPRBC's [packed red blood cells] to be given and to put Fentanyl patch on now and to do a finger stick H and H after\r\n\r\ntransfusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her conversation with Dr. Epstein, Cole informed him that she had not applied the Fentanyl patch because Welch had been\r\n\r\ngiven Dilaudid and Phenergan at 8:30.  Her nursing judgment was to hold off on applying the patch.  Dr. Epstein was very\r\n\r\ncritical of her decision.  He ordered her to apply the patch immediately.  Cole removed the Fentanyl patch that was on Welch\r\n\r\nand applied two 50 microgram patches.  In his recollection of the conversation, Dr. Epstein testified he told the nurse to do\r\n\r\nwhat he said and put the patch on.  He made the decision to transfuse due to the lower hemoglobin level, the continued\r\n\r\ntachycardia, and reduced fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScott was unsuccessful in getting the needle into Welch's vein for the transfusion so she requested assistance from an ICU\r\n\r\nnurse.  The ICU nurse, Martha Ulmer, had a difficult time finding a vein in Welch's hands.  When the needle was inserted in\r\n\r\nhis right hand,  she did not \"get much of a blood return.\"  The transfusion needle was removed from the right hand and\r\n\r\ninserted in the left hand.  According to Ulmer, when there is not \"much of a blood return\" after an IV has been inserted, that\r\n\r\nmay indicate the patient has a low volume of blood, \"like there [isn't] much circulating.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nurse started the transfusion in the early morning hours of Sunday, February 25th.  When the nurse checked on Welch at\r\n\r\n2:00 a.m., she found the transfusion in progress with Welch sleeping but easily aroused, alert, and oriented.  At 4:00 a.m., a\r\n\r\nsecond unit of red blood cells was started.  At that time, Welch was alert, oriented and easily aroused from sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5:30 a.m., Cole checked on Welch and found him alert.  He spoke to her and held the thermometer while she took his\r\n\r\ntemperature.  However, at 6:00 a.m., Cole could not rouse Welch so she called Scott to the room.  Scott tried to rouse\r\n\r\nWelch but was unable to do so.  She called for an ICU nurse to come to the room.  The ICU nurse described Welch's skin as\r\n\r\n\"very, very white\" with his mouth and tongue a light white color.  That indicated Welch \"had a blood circulatory and blood\r\n\r\nvolume problem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately 6:10 a.m., while the nurses were in the room with him, Welch's pulse and respirations ceased.  The ICU\r\n\r\nnurse stated she lost his pulse and then she \"looked down and he was not breathing.\"  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was\r\n\r\nimmediately initiated and a code was called.  Narcan was administered to counter the effect of the narcotics.  Resuscitation\r\n\r\nefforts continued and Welch was transferred to ICU.  On Sunday morning, Dr. Epstein entered a note stating Welch had\r\n\r\nsuffered a respiratory arrest  secondary to narcotics.  Dr. Epstein declared that at the time this note was made he was not\r\n\r\naware that Welch's pulse had ceased prior to the time his respirations stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in the ICU, Welch received six units of blood and other fluids.  He was maintained on life support for several days. \r\n\r\nHowever, because he had failed to regain consciousness and exhibited no brain activity, he was removed from life support on\r\n\r\nFebruary 29, 1996.  Dr. Epstein's discharge summary noted a final diagnosis of \"respiratory arrest.\"  At the time of trial, Dr.\r\n\r\nEpstein testified his opinion was Welch did not receive an overdose of narcotics.  Based upon further review of the record,\r\n\r\nhe was of the opinion Welch died from a massive pulmonary embolism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpert Witnesses Presented by the Personal Representative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal representative presented three expert witnesses: (1) a clinical pharmacologist; (2) a hematologist; and (3) a\r\n\r\nneurosurgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Clinical Pharmacologist - Dr. Pamela J. Simms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Pamela Simms testified as an expert witness in the field of clinical pharmacology.  Dr. Simms reviewed the product\r\n\r\ninformation for the Fentanyl transdermal patch prescribed by Dr. Epstein.  A warning label on the package stated \"NOT FOR\r\n\r\nACUTE OR POSTOPERATIVE USE.\"  The product insert sheet for the Fentanyl patch contained the following\r\n\r\ncontraindication:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBECAUSE SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING HYPOVENTILATION COULD OCCUR, DURAGESIC (FENTANYL\r\n\r\nTRANSDERMAL SYSTEM) IS CONTRAINDICATED:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In the management of acute or post-operative pain, including use in out-patient surgeries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the insert sheet included a warning about the concomitant use of other drugs with the\r\nFentanyl:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCOMITANT USE OF OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS, INCLUDING OTHER\r\n\r\nOPIOIDS, SEDATIVES OR HYPNOTICS, GENERAL ANESTHETICS, PHENOTHIAZINES, TRANQUILIZERS,\r\n\r\nSKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS, SEDATING ANTIHISTAMINES, AND ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES MAY\r\n\r\nPRODUCE ADDITIVE DEPRESSANT EFFECTS.  HYPOVENTILATION, HYPOTENSION AND PROFOUND\r\n\r\nSEDATION OR COMA MAY OCCUR.  WHEN SUCH COMBINED THERAPY IS CONTEMPLATED, THE DOSE OF\r\n\r\nONE OR BOTH AGENTS SHOULD BE REDUCED BY AT LEAST 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the sheet provided a warning regarding the use of the drug in patients with a low blood volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Simms stated the product information contraindicated (1) using the patch in an acute care setting; (2) using starting\r\n\r\ndosages higher than 25 micrograms per hour; and (3) using the patch in the management of pain that could be treated with a\r\n\r\nnon-opiate drug.  In her opinion, the use of the transdermal patch was not an approved use in Welch's case because it was\r\n\r\nused for post-operative pain and it was started at the highest, rather than the lowest, dosage.  Dr. Simms testified the hospital\r\n\r\nrecord indicated Welch received moderate to aggressive dosages of Dilaudid, Phenergan, and Valium.  She declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A]ll of these medications affect the central nervous system; that system we were talking about that helps us stay alert, and\r\n\r\nthat controls our breathing and our heart and things like that.  And all of these medications tends to depress it, or cause it to\r\n\r\nbe less able to function.  So it causes a person to be more sedate, for them to breathe less efficiently, for their heart to beat\r\n\r\nless efficiently.  And all of these do that together.  And one of the rules that people use when they use medications like this\r\n\r\nthat add together the same . . . [e]ffect is each time you add another medication that has the same affect, you should decrease\r\n\r\nthe dose of one or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven that the other medications were used in conjunction with the Fentanyl patch, Dr. Simms opined the dosages should\r\n\r\nhave been reduced.  According to Dr. Simms, care should have been exercised in the use of the Fentanyl patch and the other\r\n\r\ndrugs if there was a low hemoglobin because the drugs would add to any underlying condition of drowsiness or improper\r\n\r\nbreathing.  Moreover, an inadequate hemoglobin slows down the body's ability to rid itself of the drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Hematologist - Dr. Samuel K. Morgan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel K. Morgan testified as an expert in the field of hematology.  In his opinion, Welch suffered a substantial blood\r\n\r\nloss and Dr. Epstein deviated from the standard of care by (1) not determining the cause of the bleeding; (2) not defining the\r\n\r\nextent of the bleeding; and (3) not timely treating the situation.  It was more likely than not that these deviations were a\r\n\r\ncause of Welch's death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drop in the hemoglobin levels indicated Welch was anemic and the anemia was due to blood loss.  Anemia is a condition\r\n\r\nwhich involves a low red blood cell count and hemoglobin.  The extent of the anemia was not recognized.&nbsp; Based upon a\r\n\r\ncomparison of the starting hemoglobin and hematocrit levels versus the last recorded levels before his arrest, Welch suffered\r\n\r\na blood loss equaling 58% of his total blood volume.  Dr. Morgan stated a loss of this percentage of blood volume is not\r\n\r\ncompatible with life.  He further testified:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that from the time that we began the surgery and when we had the numbers that he came into the hospital with for\r\n\r\nhemoglobin and hematocrit, namely 41.6 hematocrit and 14.4 hemoglobin, until the time we achieved this last level in the\r\n\r\nchart, we have a time in which the hemoglobin gradually fell in general figures from the pre-op 14 to recovery room 12 to a\r\n\r\nvalue the next morning after surgery at 5:45-that would have been on the 23rd, of 8.6, so we see a gradual fall in the\r\n\r\nhemoglobin.  And then no evaluation of his blood counts until 27 hours later at approximately 8:40 on the following\r\n\r\nmorning. . . . That would have been the 24th, from 5:45 am on the 23rd until 8:40 on the 24th, 27 hours. At which time, on the\r\n\r\n24th, his hemoglobin was 6.5. . . . I think that this was a critical period of time where no attention was paid to his blood\r\n\r\ncounts, and I said this was critical because if we show that he has lost more than 50 percent of his blood at the time the last\r\n\r\nblood count was done during this period of time that he must have passed through the time period where he lost at least 30\r\n\r\nto 40 percent of his blood.  And when we pass through that point, unless further hemorrhage or unless further blood loss is\r\n\r\nprevented and appropriate treatment undertaken, then significant organ damage occurs and death ensues.  Death occurs. \r\n\r\nThat doesn't say when death occurs but it says predictably that death will occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Neurosurgeon - Dr. Victoria Samuels\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Victoria Samuels, a board certified neurosurgeon, testified as an expert in the field of neurosurgery.  Based upon a\r\n\r\nreview of the medical records and deposition testimony of various witnesses, Dr. Samuels declared Dr. Epstein deviated\r\n\r\nfrom the generally accepted standard of care for neurosurgeons in (1) the management of the anemia; (2) the management of\r\n\r\nthe volume depletion; and (3) the use of medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her opinion, given the drop between the pre-operative and post-operative  hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, a check of\r\n\r\nthose levels should have been performed on Thursday evening after the surgery.  Moreover, according to Dr. Samuels, once\r\n\r\nthe levels were checked on Friday morning and a hemoglobin level of 8.6 was noted, a transfusion should have been\r\n\r\nconsidered.  Welch was anemic at that time and had experienced a significant blood loss.  It was a deviation from the\r\n\r\nstandard of care to wait until Saturday morning to obtain the next hemoglobin level.  Dr. Samuels stated Welch lost 3,245\r\n\r\ncc's or 55% of his total blood volume.  He was volume depleted.  I.V. fluids should have been started in the recovery room\r\n\r\nand continued.  Canceling the transfusion and lab orders on Saturday afternoon was a deviation from the standard of care. \r\n\r\nStarting the transfusion after midnight on February 25th was \"a day late and a dollar short.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of the Fentanyl patch was a deviation from the standard of care due to the contraindications in the product literature\r\n\r\nand Welch's low blood volume.  The use of the other pain medications at the levels prescribed in conjunction with the\r\n\r\nFentanyl patch was a deviation from the standard of care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Samuels' opinion, the cumulative effect of the drop in hemoglobin level, volume depletion, and use of the Fentanyl\r\n\r\npatch in conjunction with the other drugs caused Welch's death.  When asked the cause of Welch's coma, Dr. Samuels\r\n\r\nreplied:  \"The cause of the coma was anoxic brain injury which they were able to see on a CT scan, and it is my belie[f] that\r\n\r\nthe anoxic brain injury itself was through a combination of three factors; one being hypo-low volume; the second being . . .\r\n\r\nanemia and the third being the medication causing the hypoventilation.\"  The following colloquy occurred on redirect\r\n\r\nexamination:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Now, Doctor, let's sort of wrap it up.  We've got the situation with the volume depletion; we've got the situation with\r\n\r\nthe hemoglobin which went to 6, and we've got the Fentanyl patch and the concomitant use of the Dilaudid, Phenergan,\r\n\r\nValium and Compazine.  What cumulative [e]ffect did all three of those things [the medicines, the low volume and the low\r\n\r\nblood] have on [Welch]?. .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA: Okay.  I believe what it did was cause his demise.  The combination of the low blood volume, the low volume with the\r\n\r\nanemia is what they call a lethal combination in general surgery.  And the body's attempt to take care of that is with\r\n\r\nhyperventilation or breathing fast, upping your blood pressure and your heart rate, okay?  And unfortunately, the three things\r\n\r\nthe body-the only three things the body has to do to compensate, to help tackle the low volume and the low blood is those\r\n\r\nthree things, and those three things were markedly depressed because of the massive amount of medicine he was given and\r\n\r\nthe types of medicine he was given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

APPEAL OF DR. EPSTEIN AND SOUTHERN NEUROLOGIC INSTITUTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nJUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT (JNOV)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, this Court must employ the same standard as the trial\r\n\r\ncourt by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See, e.g.,\r\n\r\nSteinke v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999); Gastineau v.\r\n\r\nMurphy, 331 S.C. 565, 503 S.E.2d 712 (1998).  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than\r\n\r\none inference or its inference is in doubt.  Steinke, supra.  This Court will reverse the trial court only when there is no\r\n\r\nevidence to support the ruling below.  Id.; Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 491\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 571 (1997).  When considering directed verdict and JNOV motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has\r\n\r\nauthority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.  Creech, supra; Reiland v. Southland\r\n\r\nEquip. Serv. Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable jury could have reached the challenged verdict.  Crossley v. State\r\n\r\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 354, 415 S.E.2d 393 (1992).  The jury's verdict will not be overturned if any evidence\r\n\r\nexists that sustains the factual findings implicit in its decision.  Smalls v. South Carolina Dep't of Educ.,\r\nS.C.   , 528 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n682 (Ct. App. 2000); Hunter v. Staples, 335 S.C. 93, 515 S.E.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Motion for JNOV as to Negligence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for JNOV as to negligence.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a complex medical negligence case.  The personal representative presented three expert witnesses who gave their\r\n\r\nopinions concerning the applicable standard of care and deviations by Dr. Epstein from that standard of care.  Dr. Epstein\r\n\r\ntestified in his own defense.  In addition, he presented an expert witness, Dr. Joseph Marzouff, a board certified\r\n\r\nneurosurgeon, who testified there was no deviation from the applicable standard of care.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, conflicting evidence exists in this case.  It is not the function of this Court to weigh the evidence and resolve those\r\n\r\nconflicts.  In a negligence case on appeal from a jury verdict, the jurisdiction of an appellate court extends merely to the\r\n\r\ncorrection of errors of law and factual findings of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses there\r\n\r\nis no evidence which reasonably supports the findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, more than one reasonable inference could be drawn from the evidence.  The evidence supports the factual findings\r\n\r\nimplicit in the jury's verdict.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the personal representative, we find the trial\r\n\r\ncourt properly denied Dr. Epstein's motion for JNOV as to negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Motions for Directed Verdict and JNOV\r\nas to Punitive Damages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein claims the trial court erred in denying his motions for directed verdict and JNOV as to punitive damages because\r\n\r\nthe personal representative \"failed to present 'clear and convincing evidence' showing she was entitled to punitive damages.\" \r\n\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to receive an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence\r\n\r\nthe defendant's misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135\r\n\r\n(Supp. 1999); Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996).  A conscious failure to exercise due care constitutes\r\n\r\nwillfulness.  McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995);  Hawkins v. Pathology\r\n\r\nAssocs. of Greenville, 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998).  The issue of punitive damages must be submitted to\r\n\r\nthe jury if more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence as to whether the defendant's behavior was\r\n\r\nreckless, willful, or wanton.  Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984); Hawkins, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is clear and convincing evidence of Dr. Epstein's reckless culpability justifying an award of punitive damages.  Dr.\r\n\r\nEpstein was aware of the manufacturer's warning concerning the use of the Fentanyl transdermal patch in a post-operative\r\n\r\nsetting.  However, he chose to use the patch despite that warning.  Dr. Epstein testified on cross examination that he knew\r\n\r\nmore about the drug than \"people down here.\"  Dr. Epstein opined his practice was more advanced than others in the area. \r\n\r\nHe stated \"[t]his has been a recurrent theme to try to undercut me when I came here because the Augusta physicians and\r\n\r\nColumbia physicians were practicing like Eisenhower was still in office.\"  There was evidence no other doctor used the\r\n\r\nFentanyl transdermal patch in this manner.  While Dr. Epstein's expert witness, Dr. Marzouff, did not use Fentanyl in a post-operative setting, he declared it would be acceptable to use the Fentanyl patch in a hospital on a patient under close\r\n\r\nobservation with frequent vital sign checks, especially if the patient \"had been on a lot of narcotics before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was sufficient evidence to create a jury issue as to recklessness.  See McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 633 (1996)(package inserts for catheters introduced to support a punitive damages award by showing doctor's\r\n\r\nawareness of the conditions which may be caused by improper placement of catheter).  Therefore, the trial court did not err\r\n\r\nin denying Dr. Epstein's motions for directed verdict and JNOV as to punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  NEW TRIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    When a party moves for a new trial based on a challenge that the verdict is either excessive or inadequate, the trial judge\r\n\r\nmust distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion,\r\n\r\ncaprice or prejudice.  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 431 S.E.2d 557 (1993).  The trial court must set aside a\r\n\r\nverdict only when it is shockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and thus indicates that passion, caprice, prejudice,\r\n\r\nor other considerations not reflected by the evidence affected the amount awarded.  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1996).  In other words, to warrant a new trial absolute, the verdict reached must be so \"grossly\r\n\r\nexcessive\" as to clearly indicate the influence of an improper motive on the jury.  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 802 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a new trial absolute based on the excessiveness of a verdict rests in the sound discretion of the\r\n\r\ntrial court and ordinarily will not be disturbed on appeal.  Krepps v. Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 479 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n\r\nAn abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court's findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached\r\n\r\nare controlled by an error of law.  Id.  In deciding whether to assess error when a new trial motion is denied, this Court must\r\n\r\nconsider the testimony and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Vinson,\r\n\r\nsupra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court has wide discretionary power to reduce the amount of a verdict which in his or her judgment is excessive. \r\n\r\nRush, supra.  Indeed, when the verdict indicates the jury was unduly liberal in determining damages, the trial court alone has\r\n\r\nthe power to reduce the verdict by the granting of a new trial nisi remittitur.  Allstate, supra.  A motion for new trial nisi\r\n\r\nremittitur asks the trial court in its discretion to reduce the verdict because it is merely excessive, although not motivated by\r\n\r\nconsiderations such as passion, caprice or prejudice.  O'Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993).  If the\r\n\r\namount of the verdict is grossly excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice or some other influence outside\r\n\r\nthe evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial absolute, not a new trial nisi remittitur.  Id.  However, the jury's\r\n\r\ndetermination of damages is entitled to substantial deference.  Rush, supra.  The judge's decision will not be disturbed on\r\n\r\nappeal unless it clearly appears the exercise of discretion was controlled by a manifest error of law.  Id.  In considering a\r\n\r\nmotion for new trial nisi, the trial court must evaluate the adequacy of the verdict in light of the evidence presented.  Waring\r\n\r\nv. Johnson, Op. No. 3193 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 12, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 25 at 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Motion for New Trial as to Actual Damages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein challenges the denial of his motion for new trial or, in the alternative, new trial nisi remittitur, arguing the size of\r\n\r\nthe actual damages award indicates it resulted from passion, caprice, prejudice, or other considerations on the part of the\r\n\r\njury.  We find no error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual damages in a survival action are awarded for the benefit of the decedent's estate.  Scott v. Porter, Op. No. 3149 (S.C.\r\n\r\nCt. App. filed April 10, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 46).  Appropriate damages in survival actions include those for\r\n\r\nmedical, surgical, and hospital bills, conscious pain, suffering, and mental distress of the deceased.  Id.  Based upon the\r\n\r\nevidence that Welch lapsed into a coma from which he never recovered, the trial judge charged the jury it could only award\r\n\r\ndamages in the survival claim for the amount of the medical bills incurred from the point of the arrest to his death.  The jury\r\n\r\nawarded actual damages of $28,535.88, the amount of those medical bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a wrongful death case, the issue of damages is not directed toward the value of the human life that was lost, but rather the\r\n\r\ndamages sustained by the beneficiaries as a result of the death.  Zorn v. Crawford, 252 S.C. 127, 165 S.E.2d 640 (1969);\r\n\r\nSelf  v. Goodrich, 300 S.C. 349, 387 S.E.2d 713 (Ct. App. 1989).  Damages recoverable in a wrongful death action include:\r\n\r\n(1) pecuniary loss; (2) mental shock and suffering; (3) wounded feelings; (4) grief and sorrow; (5) loss of companionship;\r\n\r\nand (6) deprivation of the use and comfort of the intestate's society, including the loss of his experience, knowledge, and\r\n\r\njudgment in managing the affairs of himself and of his beneficiaries.  Smith v. Wells, 258 S.C. 316, 188 S.E.2d 470 (1972);\r\n\r\nScott, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Oliver Wood, a recognized expert in the field of economics and economic forecasts, testified the pecuniary loss resulting\r\n\r\nfrom the death of Marshall Welch was $630,690.  At the time of his death, Welch was thirty-seven years old and his widow,\r\n\r\nKim, was twenty-eight years old.  Their two children were eight and six.  Welch was an active, loving husband and father. \r\n\r\nDespite his physical pain, he was a hard worker.  According to Dr. Epstein, \"if you cut his legs off he would have tried to\r\n\r\nkeep going.\"  In addition to his nursing career, he helped his father on the family farm.  He assisted his wife with work\r\n\r\naround the house including yard work, maintenance, and cleaning.  Welch helped with the care of the children.  He was\r\n\r\ninvolved in their school and sports activities.  The family bicycled together.  He took his son hunting and fishing.  Every\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, Welch would take the children out to breakfast and spend the morning with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury awarded actual damages of $3,000,000 in the wrongful death claim.  Given the evidence of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses, we conclude the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant the new trial motion based upon\r\n\r\nthe size of the actual damages award.  Cf. Knoke v. South Carolina Dep't of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, 324 S.C. 136,\r\n\r\n478 S.E.2d 256 (1996)(wrongful death verdict of $3,000,000 for death of twelve year old was not an excessive verdict);\r\n\r\nScott v. Porter, Op. No. 3149 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 10, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 46)(wrongful death verdict\r\n\r\nof $1,500,000 for death of nineteen month old child was not excessive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the trial judge's denial of Dr. Epstein's motions for new trial absolute or, in the alternative, new trial nisi remittitur\r\n\r\nas to the actual damage verdicts in the survival and wrongful death actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Motion for New Trial as to Punitive Damages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na.  Gamble (2) Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein maintains the trial judge erred in denying his motion for new trial or, in the alternative, new trial nisi remittitur,\r\n\r\nasserting the excessive size of the punitive damages award indicates it resulted from passion, caprice, prejudice, or other\r\n\r\nconsideration on the part of the jury.  He further complains the trial judge failed to properly apply the Gamble factors.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury awarded punitive damages of $3,900,000.  The evidence at trial established that as of August of 1996, Dr. Epstein\r\n\r\nhad a net worth of $2,811,788.  His monthly salary was $60,000 with an estimated yearly bonus of $534,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of damages, actual or punitive, remains largely within the discretion of the finder of fact, as reviewed by the trial\r\n\r\njudge.  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991).  The trial judge is vested with considerable discretion\r\n\r\nover the amount of a punitive damages award, and this Court's review is limited to correction of errors of law.  South\r\n\r\nCarolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love Chevrolet, Inc., 324 S.C. 149, 478 S.E.2d 57 (1996); Lister v. NationsBank of\r\n\r\nDelaware, N.A., 329 S.C. 133, 494 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from imposing grossly excessive punishments on\r\n\r\ntortfeasors.  BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996).  In Pacific Mut.\r\n\r\nLife Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), the Supreme Court determined whether the Due\r\n\r\nProcess Clause rendered a punitive damages award unconstitutional.  The Court noted \"unlimited jury discretion--or\r\n\r\nunlimited judicial discretion for that matter--in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results that jar one's\r\n\r\nconstitutional sensibilities.\"  Id. at 18, 111 S.Ct. at 1043, 113 L.Ed.2d at 20.  In Haslip, the Court upheld the punitive\r\n\r\ndamages award, finding Alabama's post-trial procedures for scrutinizing such awards and its appellate review \"makes certain\r\n\r\nthat the punitive damages are reasonable in their amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred\r\n\r\nand to deter its repetition.\"  Id. at 21, 111 S.Ct. at 1045, 113 L.Ed.2d at 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to Haslip, the South Carolina Supreme Court, in Gamble, supra, developed an eight factor post-verdict review\r\n\r\nwhich trial courts are required to conduct to determine if a punitive damages award comports with due process.  The Gamble\r\n\r\nfactors are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) defendant's degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness or concealment; (4) the existence\r\n\r\nof similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award\r\n\r\nis reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendant's ability to pay; and finally, (8) as noted in\r\n\r\nHaslip, \"other factors\" deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGamble, 305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354.  Under Gamble, the trial court is not required to make findings of fact for\r\n\r\neach factor to uphold a punitive damage award.  McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge correctly submitted to the jury the issue regarding Dr. Epstein's recklessness.  The trial judge conducted\r\n\r\nan appropriate post-verdict Gamble review, arriving at well-reasoned conclusions amply supported by the record.  The court\r\n\r\nset forth its findings as to each of the relevant factors articulated in Gamble.  The judge found the challenged treatment by\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein took place over several days.  Dr. Epstein ignored a specific manufacturer's warning concerning the use of the\r\n\r\nFentanyl patch.  He canceled the orders of Dr. Haas for the transfusion on Saturday afternoon.  Expert testimony established\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein violated the standard of care in the treatment of anemia and blood volume loss.  The judge concluded the award\r\n\r\nwas reasonably related to the foreseeable harm, i.e., the death of the patient, and the award was within Dr. Epstein's ability\r\n\r\nto pay \"without effecting economic bankruptcy.\"  Further, the ratio of actual damages to punitive damages is clearly not\r\n\r\nexcessive.  We agree with the trial court's determination the punitive damages award was proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we find the damages award proper under Gamble, we must analyze the award in light of the United States\r\n\r\nSupreme Court's decision in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). \r\n\r\nThe Court provided the following guideposts for determining the reasonableness of punitive damages awards: (1) the degree\r\n\r\nof reprehensibility; (2) the ratio of the punitive damages award to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff; and (3) the\r\n\r\ncomparison of the punitive damages award and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable\r\n\r\nmisconduct.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the South Carolina Supreme Court's Gamble test and the United States Supreme Court's BMW \"guideposts,\" we hold\r\n\r\nthe punitive damage award of $3,900,000 was not unreasonable.  We find the punitive damage award is neither \"grossly\r\n\r\nexcessive\" so as to justify a new trial absolute nor \"merely excessive\" so as to justify a new trial nisi remittitur.  Thus, the\r\n\r\ntrial court did not err in denying Dr. Epstein's motions for new trial absolute or, in the alternative, new trial nisi remittitur as\r\n\r\nto the punitive damage verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb.  \"Economic Bankruptcy\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion for new trial or, in the alternative, new trial nisi remittitur,\r\n\r\nasserting the excessive size of the punitive damages award \"clearly violates the law by rendering [him] economically\r\n\r\nbankrupt.\"  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the wealth of a defendant is a relevant factor in assessing punitive damages, it is not necessarily controlling.  Hicks v.\r\n\r\nHerring, 246 S.C. 429, 144 S.E.2d 151 (1965).  The financial worth of a defendant is a fact properly to be considered by the\r\n\r\njury in determining the amount to be awarded as punitive damages, but evidence of net worth is not a prerequisite to a\r\n\r\npunitive damage award.  Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 106 S.E.2d 258 (1958).  The defendant's financial\r\n\r\nability to pay is always a factor to be considered by the jury in awarding punitive damages.  Charles v. Texas Co., 199 S.C.\r\n\r\n156, 18 S.E.2d 719 (1942).  Yet, evidence of ability to pay is not a sine qua non of a punitive damage award.  Id.  There is\r\n\r\n\"no requirement that the defendant be a man of means before the jury is justified in awarding punitive damages.\"  Norton v.\r\n\r\nEwaskio, 241 S.C. 557, 565, 129 S.E.2d 517,  521 (1963).  See also Clamp v. Clamp, 293 S.C. 142, 359 S.E.2d 86 (Ct.\r\n\r\nApp. 1987)(financial condition of defendant is factor to be considered by jury in awarding punitive damages but there is no\r\n\r\nrequirement the defendant be a man of means before the jury is justified in awarding punitive damages).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein cites Mattison v. Dallas Carrier Corp., 947 F.2d 95 (4th Cir. 1991), in support of his \"economic bankruptcy\"\r\n\r\nargument.  In Mattison, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reviewed South Carolina's post-Gamble\r\n\r\npunitive damages system.  The Court articulated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the plaintiff demonstrates an entitlement to punitive damages, we direct that the district court's instructions on the amount\r\n\r\nof punitive damages that may be awarded include instruction on four aspects, which are derived from Gamble and Haslip:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)  Relationship to harm caused:  Any penalty imposed should take into account the reprehensibility of the conduct, the\r\n\r\nharm caused, the defendant's awareness of the conduct's wrongfulness, the duration of the conduct, and any concealment. \r\n\r\nThus any penalty imposed should bear a relationship to the nature and extent of the conduct and the harm caused, including\r\n\r\nthe compensatory damage award made by the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Other penalties for the conduct:  Any penalty imposed should take into account as a mitigating factor any other penalty\r\n\r\nthat may have been imposed or which may be imposed for the conduct involved, including any criminal or civil penalty or any\r\n\r\nother punitive damages award arising out of the same conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  Improper profits and plaintiff's costs:  The amount of any penalty may focus on depriving the defendant of profits\r\n\r\nderived from the improper conduct and on awarding the costs to the plaintiff of prosecuting the claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  Limitation based on ability to pay:  Any penalty must be limited to punishment and thus may not effect\r\neconomic\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  To this end, the ability of the defendant to pay any punitive award entered should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMattison, 947 F.2d at 109-10 (emphasis added).  In Defender Indus., Inc. v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., 809 F. Supp.\r\n\r\n400, 402 (D.S.C. 1992), the District Court judge discussed Mattison:  \"The Mattison decision significantly altered the law of\r\n\r\npunitive damages in South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we note that Mattison and Defender Industries are not controlling precedent on this Court.  Dr. Epstein's reliance\r\n\r\nupon Mattison and Defender Industries is misplaced.  Neither Mattison nor Defender Industries holds that \"economic\r\n\r\nbankruptcy\" is an absolute bar to an award of punitive damages.  Rather, Mattison and Defender Industries involve jury\r\n\r\ninstructions that are inclusive of \"economic bankruptcy\" considerations as one factor in a punitive damage award.  If\r\n\r\nMattison and Defender Industries can be construed to erect \"economic bankruptcy\" as a complete defense to punitive\r\n\r\ndamages in South Carolina, we reject this holding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold the \"economic bankruptcy\" factor is not an absolute bar to the imposition of punitive damages in South Carolina\r\n\r\nunder Gamble, Hicks, Rogers, Charles, and Norton.  In a proper case, the jury may be instructed to consider \"economic\r\n\r\nbankruptcy\" as one factor in awarding punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad brush attack launched by Dr. Epstein in reference to the punitive damage award can be crystallized to a financial\r\n\r\nimpact analysis on Dr. Epstein as juxtaposed to his actual economic position.  The quintessence of the legal argument\r\n\r\npresented by Dr. Epstein is a contention that a punitive damage award can not thrust a party into \"economic bankruptcy.\" \r\n\r\nThe gist and gravamen of Dr. Epstein's assertion is that the law on punitive damages has evolved to the point of erecting an\r\n\r\nirrevocable financial barrier to the imposition of punitive damages if harsh financial realities emanate from the award.  We\r\n\r\nreject this position.  It is untenable and unsupportable under South Carolina precedent and decisions of the United States\r\n\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  JURY INSTRUCTION ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein asserts the trial judge's instruction to the jury as to punitive damages was incorrect because the charge implied\r\n\r\nthe jury could award punitive damages in an amount exceeding Dr. Epstein's net worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial was bifurcated. In the first phase, the jury determined liability and actual damages.  Special interrogatories were\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the jury.  The jury affirmatively answered the question \"[d]o you find that the plaintiff has proven by clear and\r\n\r\nconvincing evidence that Dr. Epstein acted recklessly, wilfully, wantonly, or in conscious disregard for the rights of his\r\n\r\npatient, Marshall O. Welch, Jr. in proximately causing injury to and the death of Mr. Welch?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence was received from Dr. Oliver Wood concerning Dr. Epstein's financial statements.  As of August of 1996, Dr.\r\n\r\nEpstein had a net worth of $2,811,788.  His monthly salary was $60,000 with an estimated yearly bonus of $534,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attorneys presented closing arguments.  The trial judge gave a charge on punitive damages.  The judge instructed in\r\n\r\npart:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you decide that punitive damages should be awarded, you must then determine the amount of the punitive damage award\r\n\r\nto be assessed against this defendant. In doing so, ladies and gentlemen, the law requires that you must consider several\r\n\r\nfactors.  First, the amount of the damages or punishment imposed by punitive damages should bare [sic] a reasonable\r\n\r\nrelationship to the nature and the extent of the wrongful conduct and the harm caused.  In other words, you should take into\r\n\r\naccount the degree of wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct and the extent of actual damages that resulted from the\r\n\r\nconduct; and there should be a reasonable relationship between the actual damages and the punishment imposed.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nyou must consider any other penalties that may be imposed against the defendant for the conduct involved. Third, you must\r\n\r\nconsider whether or not the defendant's wrongful conduct conferred any profit on him.  You may also consider awarding the\r\n\r\nplaintiff the cost of prosecuting her claim against the defendant.  And fourth, you must also consider the defendant's ability\r\n\r\nto pay the amount of the punitive damages awarded.  In making this determination, the defendant's wealth, or lack of it, is a\r\n\r\nrelevant factor and you would therefore award such amount of punitive damages as would punish the defendant\r\nbut not\r\n\r\neffect economic bankruptcy.  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur state supreme court has indicated that the following factors are relevant to an evaluation of an award of punitive\r\n\r\ndamages.  First, the defendant's degree of culpability; the degree of his wrongdoing and his responsibility for it.  Second, the\r\n\r\nduration of the wrongful conduct; how long it lasted.  Third, the defendant's awareness of wrongdoing or concealment of\r\n\r\nwrongdoing.  Fourth, whether the defendant had engaged in similar wrongdoing in the past.  Fifth, the likelihood that the\r\n\r\naward will deter the defendant, or others, from like conduct.  Sixth, whether the harm that actually resulted was reasonably\r\n\r\nrelated to the harm that was likely to result from the wrongdoing. In other words, was the harm foreseeable?  And seventh,\r\n\r\nthe defendant's ability to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA trial court must charge the current and correct law.  McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 603 (1995).  See also Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 481 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1997)(trial judge is required to\r\n\r\ncharge current and correct law applicable to issues presented).  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, an appellate\r\n\r\ncourt must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.  Keaton ex rel. Foster v.\r\n\r\nGreenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999).  If the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions\r\n\r\nwhich might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded in the jury charge is the statement \"but not effect economic bankruptcy.\"  The jury charge on punitive damages\r\n\r\nimproperly stated the law of South Carolina.  \"Economic bankruptcy\" is not a categorical prohibition to an award of punitive\r\n\r\ndamages.  Rather, financial net worth and ability to pay are factors for the jury to consider in awarding punitive damages. It\r\n\r\nis reversible error to charge a jury that an award of punitive damages may not exceed the net worth of a defendant nor effect\r\n\r\n\"economic bankruptcy.\"  The trial judge's instruction to the jury was more favorable to Dr. Epstein than he was entitled to. \r\n\r\nThus, we find no reversible error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  APPEAL OF THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days prior to trial, the personal representative settled wrongful death and survival claims against a co-defendant\r\n\r\n(hereafter referred to as Doe (3)).  The settlement totaled $450,000, of which the parties allocated $5,000 to the wrongful\r\n\r\ndeath claim and $445,000 to the survival claim.  Dr. Epstein objected to the proposed allocation between the two claims.  He\r\n\r\nfiled a post-trial motion seeking a set-off based upon a reallocation of the settlement proceeds.  The judge ordered a\r\n\r\nreallocation of the settlement: (1) survival action-$28,535.88; and (2) wrongful death action-$421,464.12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal representative does not challenge the offset and satisfaction of the survival verdict.  However, she argues only\r\n\r\n$5,000 should be offset against the wrongful death verdict.  She avers the trial judge erred because the parties' allocation\r\n\r\nbetween the two claims was not fraudulent and was a valid and reasonable apportionment based upon evidence of conscious\r\n\r\npain and suffering which could have been presented against Doe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA nonsettling defendant is entitled to credit for the amount paid by another defendant who settles.  Powers v. Temple, 250\r\n\r\nS.C. 149, 156 S.E.2d 759 (1967).  The reason for allowing such a credit is to prevent an injured person from obtaining a\r\n\r\nsecond recovery of that part of the amount of damages sustained which has already been paid to him.  Truesdale v. South\r\n\r\nCarolina Hwy. Dep't, 264 S.C. 221, 213 S.E.2d 740 (1975).  In other words, there can be only one satisfaction for an injury\r\n\r\nor wrong.  Id.; Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998).  However, the\r\n\r\nreduction in the judgment must be from a settlement for the same cause of action.  Hawkins, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court's jurisdiction to set off one judgment against another is equitable in nature and should be exercised when\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide justice between the parties.  Smalls v. South Carolina Dep't of Education,\r\nS.C.   , 528 S.E.2d 682\r\n\r\n(Ct. App. 2000); Hawkins, supra.  A set-off is not necessarily founded upon any statute or fixed rule of court, but grows out\r\n\r\nof the inherent equitable jurisdiction of the court.  Rookard v. Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line Ry., 89 S.C. 371, 71 S.E. 992\r\n\r\n(1911).  Therefore, such motions are addressed to the discretion of the court-a discretion which should not be arbitrarily or\r\n\r\ncapriciously exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein was not a party to the settlement between the personal representative and Doe and is not bound by its terms. \r\n\r\nWelch fell into a coma at the time of his arrest and did not recover from that condition.  While the personal representative\r\n\r\nclaims Welch was in considerable pain prior to the arrest, that pain was directly related to the back surgery.  Further, the trial\r\n\r\njudge charged the jury only medical bills could be recovered in the survival action and the personal representative did not\r\n\r\nappeal that ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our view, a set-off is warranted in the case sub judice.  Considering the facts and equities of this case, we agree with the\r\n\r\ntrial judge the allocation between the survival and wrongful death claims must yield to fairness and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal representative relies on Ward v. Epting, 290 S.C. 547, 351 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1986).  Ward is\r\n\r\ndistinguishable.  In Ward, prior to her arrest, there was some evidence Mrs. Ward was responding to directions while in the\r\n\r\nrecovery room.  Thus, a factual issue was presented as to conscious pain and suffering.  The trial judge in Ward rejected the\r\n\r\nargument the pain and suffering cause of action was a sham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the personal representative maintains the trial judge's order contravenes S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-50 (Supp.\r\n\r\n1999).  This statute is part of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act.  Section 15-38-50 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one of two or more persons\r\n\r\nliable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)  it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so\r\n\r\nprovide, but it reduces the claim against the others to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant, or\r\n\r\nin the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever is the greater; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  it discharges the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other\r\ntortfeasor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge's order complies with Â§ 15-38-50 because there is one complete satisfaction for the injury suffered by Welch. \r\n\r\nSee Ellis v. Oliver, 335 S.C. 106, 515 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 1999)(trial court correctly reduced jury verdict for wrongful\r\n\r\ndeath and survival claims against doctor by $140,000, amount of settlement with hospital, even though settlement\r\n\r\nconstituted the only amount of medical bills and no evidence regarding these hospital bills was introduced in trial against\r\n\r\ndoctor).  The trial court properly allocated the settlement proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the trial court's denial of Dr. Epstein's motions for directed verdict and JNOV as to actual and punitive damages. \r\n\r\nFurther, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the new trial motion based upon the size of the actual\r\n\r\ndamages award.  In addition, the judge did not err in denying Dr. Epstein's motion for new trial based upon the\r\n\r\nexcessiveness of the punitive damages verdict.  The trial judge conducted an appropriate post-verdict Gamble review.  We\r\n\r\nagree the punitive damage award is proper under Gamble and BMW.  We conclude the jury instruction by the trial court on\r\n\r\npunitive damages was not in compliance with South Carolina law.  In a proper case, the trial court may instruct the jury to\r\n\r\nconsider \"economic bankruptcy\" as one factor in awarding punitive damages.  Moreover, we hold the \"economic\r\n\r\nbankruptcy\" factor is not an absolute bar to the imposition of punitive damages.  We rule Dr. Epstein is entitled to a set-off\r\n\r\nin the sum of $421,464.12 as to the wrongful death verdict.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n1. The \"Statement of the Issues on Appeal\" by Dr. Epstein includes an issue concerning the format of the special interrogatories\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the jury, but the issue is not specifically argued in the body of the brief.  Thus, the issue is deemed abandoned.\r\nTaylor v.\r\n\r\nMedenica, 331 S.C. 575, 503 S.E.2d 458 (1998)(issue which is raised but not argued in brief is deemed abandoned and will not be\r\n\r\nconsidered on appeal).\r\n\r\n2.
