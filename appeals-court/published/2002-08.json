Madden, of Greenville, for appellant.\r\nThomas \r\n  W. Traxler and Katherine H. Tiffany, of Greenville, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, \r\n  C.J.:Â  In this divorce action, Elaine (Nutting) Greene (Wife) appeals several \r\n  aspects of the family courtâ€™s order of equitable distribution.Â  We affirm in \r\n  part, reverse in part, modify in part, and remand.\r\n \r\n  FACTS\r\nWife \r\n  and Jackson Edward Greene (Husband) were married on December 23, 1988 and separated \r\n  on March 17, 1998.Â  At the time of the marriage, Husband was retired and owned \r\n  substantial property, including a home situated on a 17-acre tract where the \r\n  parties lived during the marriage and a separate 135-acre tract.Â  Wifeâ€™s premarital \r\n  property consisted of $16,000 in proceeds from the sale of her former home. \r\n  \r\nDuring \r\n  the marriage, the parties operated a farm and horse business on the 17 acres \r\n  surrounding the home.Â  Both parties participated in giving riding lessons and \r\n  boarding, breeding, training, buying, selling, and leasing horses.Â  Proceeds \r\n  derived from the business were maintained in a joint bank account and applied \r\n  toward the expenses associated with the business.Â  The business, however, operated \r\n  at a loss, and Husband occasionally contributed personal funds to cover company \r\n  expenses. \r\nThroughout \r\n  the marriage, the parties maintained separate bank accounts.Â  Husbandâ€™s accounts \r\n  were funded primarily with his premarital retirement and Social Security income, \r\n  and proceeds from the sale of his premarital real estate.Â  Husband used his \r\n  retirement income to pay most of the partiesâ€™ living expenses, and used other \r\n  funds to pay for utilities, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and home \r\n  repairs.Â  Wifeâ€™s separate accounts were funded with the proceeds from the sale \r\n  of her home and income from her employment as a teacher.Â  She used money from \r\n  her accounts to acquire numerous investment accounts and four parcels of real \r\n  estate.\r\nEarly \r\n  in the marriage, the parties began repairing and improving the home.Â  Wife cleaned \r\n  the home and performed minor repair work.Â  In 1996, a fire destroyed \r\n  much of the home.Â  The insurance proceeds, approximately $171,000, were deposited \r\n  into Husbandâ€™s account and used to pay for restoration and renovations on the \r\n  marital residence. \r\nAt some \r\n  point during the marriage, Wife became romantically involved with a neighbor.Â  \r\n  She instituted this action against Husband seeking an order of separate support \r\n  and maintenance and ancillary relief.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed, \r\n  seeking, among other things, a divorce on the ground of adultery and equitable \r\n  distribution of marital property. \r\nThe family \r\n  court awarded Husband a divorce on the ground of adultery; identified, valued \r\n  and equally apportioned the partiesâ€™ marital property; awarded Wife a special \r\n  equity in the home; and awarded Husband $12,195 in attorney fees and costs. \r\n  \r\n \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\nIn appeals \r\n  from the family court, this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance \r\n  with its view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, \r\n  307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does \r\n  not, however, require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson \r\n  v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are \r\n  we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, \r\n  was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 \r\n  S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Identification of Marital Property\r\nA. Property Titled to Wife\r\nWife \r\n  first asserts the family court erred in identifying two parcels of property, \r\n  22 North Acres and 4 Kestrel Court, as marital property.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family \r\n  court found that both parcels of real estate were marital because \r\n  (1) the parties stipulated the properties were marital in nature;Â  (2) Wife \r\n  used marital funds to acquire a contractual interest in the properties prior \r\n  to the date of filing;Â  and (3) Wife used other marital funds to close on the \r\n  purchase of the properties.Â  Accordingly, the family court assigned equity values \r\n  to the properties and charged the full amount against Wifeâ€™s share of the marital \r\n  estate.\r\nThe family \r\n  court determined that the parties stipulated to the marital nature of the properties \r\n  based on Wifeâ€™s inclusion of the properties on the marital assets addendum of \r\n  her financial declaration submitted to the family court.Â  Our supreme court \r\n  has defined a stipulation as:\r\n\r\nan agreement, \r\n  admission or concession made in judicial proceedings by the parties thereto \r\n  or their attorneys.Â  Stipulations, of course, are binding upon those who make \r\n  them.Â  A stipulation is an agreement, an understanding.Â  The court must construe \r\n  it like a contract, i.e., interpret it in a manner consistent with the parties' \r\n  intentions.\r\n\r\nPorter \r\n  v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 333 S.C. 12, 30, 507 S.E.2d 328, 337 (1998) (internal \r\n  citations and quotationsÂ  omitted).Â  The purpose of a stipulation is to â€œobviate \r\n  need for proof or to narrow [the] range of litigable issues.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law \r\n  Dictionary 1415 (6th ed. 1990).\r\nOur reading \r\n  of the record does not convince us Wife intended to stipulate that the properties \r\n  were marital simply because she included them on the marital property addendum \r\n  of her financial declaration.Â  Rather, we accept Wifeâ€™s explanation that she \r\n  included them simply to disclose their existence to the court.Â  This explanation \r\n  is consistent with Wifeâ€™s position throughout her testimony that this was her \r\n  separate property.\r\n \r\n  Furthermore, we find the date of acquisition of these properties significant \r\n  to our determination that they are nonmarital.Â  Marital property is generally \r\n  defined as â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties \r\n  during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement \r\n  of marital litigation . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20&#8209;7&#8209;473 (Supp. \r\n  2001).Â  Although Wife used $2,000 in marital funds to pay earnest money deposits \r\n  on the property prior to the date of filing, legal title to the properties did \r\n  not vest until after the date marital litigation was commenced.Â  Because Wife \r\n  had no ownership interest in the properties until after the date of filing, \r\n  we find the disputed properties were improperly classified as marital.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse the family courtâ€™s finding that 22 North Acres and 4 Kestrel Court \r\n  were marital property.\r\nMoreover, \r\n  we modify the family courtâ€™s order to reflect the $10,000 loan from Wifeâ€™s father \r\n  for the down payment for 4 Kestrel Court.Â  Although the family court â€œrecognized \r\n  a contribution on Mrs. Greeneâ€™s behalf in the amount of $10,000 in the overall \r\n  equitable division of the marital estate,â€ the family court nonetheless included \r\n  the full equitable value of 4 Kestrel Court in valuing the marital estate for \r\n  equitable distribution.Â  This was error.Â  We find the $10,000 Wife borrowed \r\n  from her father for the down payment on 4 Kestrel Court was her separate property.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we modify the family courtâ€™s order to subtract $10,000 from the \r\n  assigned value of the Kestrel Court property for purposes of equitable distribution.\r\nHusband \r\n  may, however, be entitled to a special equity in 22 North Acres.Â  Although nonmarital \r\n  property is not subject to equitable distribution as such, if one spouse uses \r\n  marital funds to purchase property after the commencement of marital litigation, \r\n  the family court may properly award the other spouse a special equity in the \r\n  property.Â  Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 50-51, 467 S.E.2d 132, 136 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Wife testified she used $8,000 from her checking account to \r\n  make a down payment on this property.Â  This was clearly marital money, as the \r\n  checking account was funded with income she earned teaching during the marriage.Â  \r\n  Thus, Husband would be entitled to a special equity in the property.Â  However, \r\n  Wife claims Husbandâ€™s â€œDivision of Assetsâ€ exhibit presented at trial listed \r\n  the equitable value of the property at $8,000 without subtracting this amount \r\n  from Wifeâ€™s checking account.Â  The family court accepted Husbandâ€™s valuation \r\n  of the checking account, which would have the effect of counting the $8,000 \r\n  twice for purposes of equitable distribution.Â  Because we cannot discern whether \r\n  the $8,000 was subtracted from \r\n  the checking account prior to Husbandâ€™s listing of the value of that account \r\n  on his â€œDivision of Assetsâ€ list, we remand this issue to the family court to \r\n  make that determination. \r\nFurthermore, \r\n  we hold Wifeâ€™s share in the marital estate must be reduced by $2,000 in order \r\n  to account for the expenditure of marital funds to pay the earnest money deposits \r\n  on both properties.Â  On remand, the family court is directed to reapportion \r\n  the marital estate to account for this partial modification, and make a determination \r\n  as to whether the $8,000 from Wifeâ€™s checking account for 22 North Acres has \r\n  been counted twice in the equitable distribution. \r\nB.Â  \r\n  Property Titled in Husbandâ€™s Name\r\nWife \r\n  argues the marital home and surrounding acreage were transmuted into marital \r\n  property and should have been subject to equitable distribution, or alternatively, \r\n  that she is entitled to a greater than ten percent special equity in the home \r\n  and surrounding seventeen acres.Â  We disagree. \r\nGenerally, \r\n  property acquired by either party prior to the marriage is nonmarital property.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20&#8209;7&#8209;473(2) (Supp. 2001).Â  In certain circumstances, \r\n  nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if:Â  (1) it becomes \r\n  so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable;Â  (2) it is jointly \r\n  titled;Â  or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or \r\n  in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital \r\n  property.Â  Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996), affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).Â  Transmutation \r\n  is, however, a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.Â  \r\n  The spouse claiming transmutation bears the burden of producing objective evidence \r\n  showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property \r\n  as the common property of the marriage. Â Id.Â  The mere use of separate \r\n  property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent \r\n  to treat the property as marital, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nHere, \r\n  there is no question that the parties used Husbandâ€™s premarital home \r\n  and surrounding property in support of the marriage.Â  They lived in the home \r\n  and operated a horse business and farm on the surrounding property.Â  However, \r\n  the record clearly indicates Husband deliberately kept his premarital property \r\n  separate and distinct from their marital property.Â  Husband maintained a joint \r\n  account with Wife and separate accounts funded with his separate property; he \r\n  used money from his separate accounts to maintain the home and pay the homeownerâ€™s \r\n  insurance premiums.Â  He also subsidized the horse business and farm with money \r\n  from his separate accounts.Â  In our view, these efforts are evidence of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  intent to treat his premarital home and other premarital properties as nonmarital \r\n  property. Therefore, we find the family court properly determined that these \r\n  properties were nonmarital and not subject to equitable distribution.Â  \r\nWe also \r\n  reject Wifeâ€™s argument that she is entitled to a greater special equity in the \r\n  marital home and surrounding seventeen acres.Â  Although Husband maintained there \r\n  was no increase in the value of his home and farm acreage during the marriage, \r\n  the family court found Wifeâ€™s indirect contributions resulted in a ten percent \r\n  increase in value of the property and awarded Wife $28,200.Â  To the extent Wife \r\n  advanced a contrary position at trial, we find the family court acted within \r\n  its discretion in assigning more weight to Husbandâ€™s testimony, particularly \r\n  in light of the family courtâ€™s express determination that Husband was a more \r\n  credible witness than Wife.Â  See Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, \r\n  21-22, 553 S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating this court is not required \r\n  to ignore the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony).\r\nII.Â  \r\n  Post-filing Rental Income\r\nWife \r\n  next contends the family court erred in reducing her share in the marital estate \r\n  by the amount of rental income she received and disposed of after the date marital \r\n  litigation was commenced.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family \r\n  court found that during the course of litigation, Wife received approximately \r\n  $37,525 in rental income, including the North Acres property.Â  \r\n  In charging this income against Wifeâ€™s share in the marital estate, the family \r\n  court reduced the amount of income by the amount of income taxes associated \r\n  with the property, and ultimately determined Wifeâ€™s share should be reduced \r\n  by $24,391. \r\nThe family \r\n  court properly reduced Wifeâ€™s share in the marital estate by one-half ofÂ  the \r\n  amount of post-filing rental income derived from the partiesâ€™ marital property; \r\n  however, rental income derived from nonmarital property is nonmarital in nature.Â  \r\n  Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 161, 439 S.E.2d 312, 317 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n  In light of our holding regarding the nonmarital nature of the North Acres property, \r\n  and in the absence of any evidence that Husband directly or indirectly contributed \r\n  to the acquisition of the rental income, Husband is not entitled to any credit \r\n  for post-filing rental income attributable to this property. \r\n  [1] Â  On remand, the family court is directed to reduce the amount \r\n  of the charge against Wifeâ€™s share in the marital estate for post-filing rental \r\n  income by the amount of rental income attributable to the North Acres property.\r\nIII.Â  \r\n  Equitable Apportionment\r\nWife \r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to award her a greater share in the \r\n  marital estate. We disagree.\r\nThe apportionment \r\n  of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987).Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2001) lists fifteen \r\n  factors for the family court to consider in equitably apportioning a marital \r\n  estate.Â  The statute grants the family court discretion to decide what weight \r\n  to assign various factors.Â  On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness \r\n  of the apportionment and it is irrelevant that this court might have weighed \r\n  specific factors differently than the family court.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  296 S.C. 289, 300&#8209;01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nHere, \r\n  the family court expressly considered the factors relevant to making an award \r\n  of equitable apportionment.Â  We find the facts and circumstances of this case, \r\n  including but in no way limited to Wifeâ€™s marital misconduct, render the equal \r\n  division of marital assets fair and reasonable.Â  Therefore, we find no error.\r\nIV.Â  \r\n  Scheme of Equitable Distribution\r\nFinally, \r\n  Wife asserts the family court erred in awarding Husband a particular piece of \r\n  marital property at a value reduced by the amount of her contribution of nonmarital \r\n  funds for the purchase of the property.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family \r\n  court has wide discretion in determining how marital property is to be distributed.Â  \r\n  Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41-42 (1995).Â  In \r\n  so doing, it â€œmay use any reasonable means to divide the property equitably \r\n  . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the courtâ€™s apportionment of marital property \r\n  will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. \r\nThe family \r\n  court found that the partiesâ€™ Rose Garden property had an equitable value of \r\n  $50,500 and further found that $20,000 of the equity was attributable to Wifeâ€™s \r\n  contribution of premarital funds as a down payment on the property.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the family court assigned the property a value of $30,500 for purposes of equitable \r\n  distribution.Â  However, the court awarded the Rose Garden property to Husband \r\n  with a value of $30,500, giving Wife the option of retaining the property by \r\n  paying Husband $30,500 within 30 days of the final order.Â  We find this was \r\n  error.Â  Wife was entitled to a $20,000 credit for her nonmarital contribution \r\n  toward the acquisition of the property.Â  However, by awarding the property to \r\n  Husband at the reduced value and requiring Wife to purchase it from him, the \r\n  family court effectively gave Husband the full benefit of a credit intended \r\n  to benefit Wife.Â  As such, we remand this issue to the family court to revalue \r\n  and/or redistribute the Rose Garden property in a manner which properly accounts \r\n  for Wifeâ€™s contribution of nonmarital assets to its acquisition.\r\n \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n  IN PART, MODIFIED IN PART, REVERSED &amp; REMANDED IN PART.\r\nHUFF \r\n  and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Wife testified that Husband failed to contribute to the acquisition \r\n    of these properties and Husband did not contradict the testimony.Â  As noted \r\n    above, Husband is entitled to a special equity in the value of the \r\n    property due to Wifeâ€™s use of marital funds to purchase the property.Â  Accord \r\n    Cannon, 321 S.C. at 50-51, 467 S.E.2d at 136. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3541","title":"Satcher v.

Satcher, Sr. (Grandfather), asserting theories of an oral gift, oral contract \r\n    to devise, and promissory estoppel.Â  The trial court found Chip \r\n    failed to prove ownership under any of these theories.Â  We find \r\n    Chip established entitlement to a portion of Grandfatherâ€™s property based \r\n    on promissory estoppel but agree that Chip did not prevail as to the other \r\n    claimed property.Â  Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse \r\n    and remand in part.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  After Chipâ€™s parents \r\n    separated when he was fourteen years old, he lived with his grandparents. \r\n    Â In 1976, when Chip was twenty, his grandparents separated, \r\n    and Grandfather and Chip moved to a farmhouse on Slide Hill Road (Slide Hill).Â \r\n  Chipâ€™s girlfriend and later fiancÃ©e, Georgianna Vine (Gigi), moved \r\n    to Slide Hill in 1987.\r\n  In February \r\n    1990, Chip began working at the Westinghouse Savannah River Plant.Â  In 1993, he was promoted from a general maintenance employee to a power \r\n    operator, earning $26,520 per year plus benefits.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n    Chip left Westinghouse in early 1993 to farm Grandfatherâ€™s land.Â  At trial, several witnesses testified that Grandfather wanted \r\n    Chip to work the farm and it was their understanding that Grandfather promised \r\n    Chip that if he came back to the farm, it would be his.\r\n  Chip borrowed \r\n    money to purchase farm equipment and obtain working capital.Â  Until \r\n    Grandfatherâ€™s death, Chip planted crops, cleared new land, installed irrigation, \r\n    and sharecropped with neighboring farmers.Â  During this time, \r\n    Grandfather sold some of his property and leased other portions.\r\n  Grandfather \r\n    died testate in May 1998. Â The introductory paragraph \r\n    of the will specifically named Grandfatherâ€™s two sons, Ben and James Satcher, \r\n    and nine grandchildren, but no grandchild inherited under the will.Â  Ben was granted the â€œâ€˜Home Placeâ€™ in Edgefield County, South Carolina, \r\n    consisting of the lands on Slide Hill Road, Halford Place, and the Son Jeff \r\n    Place, all to contain 175 acres, more or less, and also my interest, if any, \r\n    in the â€˜Johnson Placeâ€™ . . . .â€â€” all the land to which Chip believed he was \r\n    entitled.\r\n  On June 3, 1998, Chip \r\n    filed the first of four notices of lis pendens on the property.Â  Later that month, Ben demanded he vacate the property so it could be \r\n    sold.Â  Chip filed a complaint seeking specific performance for \r\n    legal title, alleging equitable title passed to him through either a (1) parol \r\n    gift of the residence and farmland; (2) breach of contract to devise the residence; \r\n    and (3) promissory estoppel as to the residence and farmland.Â  Lastly, \r\n    Chip sought a declaratory judgment as to the personal property at Slide Hill; \r\n    however, this claim was later settled in probate court. Â Ben \r\n    answered and asserted various counterclaims including trespass.\r\n  A bench \r\n    trial was held, and the trial court found that Chip had not proved his claim \r\n    under any of his theories.Â  It also dismissed Ben Satcherâ€™s counterclaim \r\n    for trespass and dissolved Chipâ€™s notices of lis pendens.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nStandard of Review and burden of Proof\r\n  Chip seeks \r\n    specific performance of title in property in which he claims equitable title.Â \r\n  This remedy sounds in equity.Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., \r\n    340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 290 (2000); Wright v. Trask, 329 \r\n    S.C. 170, 176, 495 S.E.2d 222, 225 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In equity \r\n    actions, this court may review the record and make findings based on its view \r\n    of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City \r\n    of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, \r\n    we are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and \r\n    heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility.Â \r\n  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d \r\n    538, 543 (1989).Â \r\n  To prevail \r\n    under any of these theories and avoid the application of the Statute of Frauds \r\n    [1] , Chip must prove each element by clear, cogent, and \r\n    convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina case law provides a requirement \r\n    of clear and convincing evidence for proving a parol gift of land and a contract \r\n    to devise.Â  See Brown v. Graham, 242 S.C. 491, \r\n    493, 131 S.E.2d 421, 422 (1963) (holding contracts to make a will â€œare regarded \r\n    with suspicion and will not be sustained unless established by definite, clear, \r\n    cogent and convincing evidenceâ€); Knight v. Stroud, 214 S.C. 437, 441, \r\n    53 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1949) (giving burden of proof required to establish oral \r\n    gift).Â  With respect to promissory estoppel in real property \r\n    cases, the burden is less clearly defined.Â  However, we are instructed \r\n    by Knight that the partial performance exception for an oral gift â€œis \r\n    more in the nature of equitable estoppel.â€Â  214 S.C. at 442, \r\n    53 S.E.2d at 74.Â  We therefore extend this analogy to require \r\n    the same burden of proof in promissory estoppel cases where real property \r\n    is claimed.\r\n  Clear \r\n    and convincing evidence is that â€œdegree of proof which will produce in the \r\n    [fact finder] a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established.Â \r\n  Such measure of proof is intermediate, more than a mere preponderance \r\n    but less than is required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it does not \r\n    mean clear and unequivocal.â€Â  Anonymous v. State Bd. of Med. \r\n    Examâ€™rs, 329 S.C. 371, 374 n.2, 496 S.E.2d 17, 18 n.2 (1998).\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  I.Â  Promissory Estoppel\r\n  \r\nA contract \r\n  and promissory estoppel are two separate and distinct legal theories.Â  They \r\n  â€œare two different creatures of the law; they are not legally synonymous; the \r\n  birth of one does not spawn the other.â€Â  Duke Power Co. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. \r\n  Commâ€™n, 284 S.C. 81, 100, 326 S.E.2d 395, 406 (1985).Â  Our courts recognize \r\n  a remedy in equity if the claimant can prove:\r\n\r\n  (1) the presence of a promise unambiguous in its terms; \r\n    (2) reasonable reliance upon the promise by the party to whom the promise \r\n    is made; (3) the reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party who makes \r\n    the promise; and (4) the party to whom the promise is made must sustain injury \r\n    in reliance on the promise.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nWoods v. State, 314 S.C. \r\n  501, 505, 431 S.E.2d 260, 263 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The applicability of the doctrine \r\n  depends on whether the refusal to apply it â€œwould be virtually to sanction the \r\n  perpetration of a fraud or would result in other injustice.â€Â  Citizens Bank \r\n  v. Gregoryâ€™s Warehouse, Inc., 297 S.C. 151, 154, 375 S.E.2d 316, 318 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1988).Â  Unlike a contract which requires a meeting of the minds and consideration, \r\n  promissory estoppel looks at a promise, its subsequent effect on the promisee, \r\n  and in certain cases bars the promisor from making an inconsistent disposition \r\n  of the property.\r\n  \r\nA.Â  Slide \r\n  Hill\r\n  \r\n  Chip argues \r\n    he should receive title to Slide Hill under the theory of promissory\r\n  estoppel. \r\n    Â We agree and find the record proves Chip is entitled \r\n    to Slide Hill, described as â€œParcel No. 1â€ in his second amended complaint. \r\n    [2] Â  This tract, as shown on an Edgefield \r\n    County tax map, contains 83.5 acres and includes a house and pond.\r\n  There \r\n    is ample testimony from several disinterested witnesses that Grandfather promised \r\n    Slide Hill to Chip.Â  Grandfatherâ€™s former girlfriend testified \r\n    that Chip was the favorite grandchild and that Grandfather told her when Chip \r\n    was working at the Savannah River Plant he wanted Chip â€œto come back home.â€Â \r\n  After Chip returned, he repeatedly told her that â€œ[t]he house is [Chipâ€™s] \r\n    to do what he wants to doâ€ and when Slide Hill was being remodeled he said, \r\n    â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter to me what they do because itâ€™s going to be [Chipâ€™s] anyway.â€Â \r\n  Although she could not name with certainty which farmlands Grandfather \r\n    referenced when describing the property which would eventually be Chipâ€™s, \r\n    she testified that â€œthe land around the house at Slide Hill, we looked at \r\n    all that.Â  [Grandfather] said he was leaving that to Chip and \r\n    the house.Â  He said he would be well-fixed.â€Â  Gigi \r\n    recalled that Grandfather said on numerous occasions, â€œItâ€™s Chipâ€™s house.â€Â \r\n  \r\nChris Harper, Grandfatherâ€™s \r\n  fishing partner, testified that Grandfather told him he was trying to get Chip \r\n  to return to the farm.Â  He stated, â€œIf he comes back, I will give him the land \r\n  and all.â€Â  Harper approached Grandfather about selling the pond behind the house, \r\n  but Grandfather responded to his requests by saying, â€œWell, that pond belongs \r\n  to Chip.Â  This is Chipâ€™s pond and thatâ€™s Chipâ€™s house.â€Â  Another friend testified \r\n  that â€œMr. Satcher told me on several occasions the house and the farm was Chipâ€™sâ€ \r\n  and that upon visiting Slide Hill Grandfather said, â€œThis is Chipâ€™s place.â€Â  \r\n  Grandfatherâ€™s neighbor testified that Grandfather referred to Slide Hill as \r\n  Chipâ€™s house and when he asked Grandfather about whether he had deeded the house \r\n  to Chip, Grandfather responded, â€œOld boy, you know he is going to get that.â€Â  \r\n  One witness stated â€œif [Chip] would come back and run it and live at the place, \r\n  it would be his one day.â€\r\n  \r\n Lanyce Hatcher worked at the Savannah River Plant and farmed with Grandfather.Â  \r\n  Hatcher testified he worked with Chip at the plant and that Grandfather told \r\n  him he â€œshould talk to Chip.Â  Chip needed to be on the farm with them . . . \r\n  . and it was going to be his anyway.â€Â  Hatcher stated that he told Grandfather, \r\n  â€œFrom Chipâ€™sÂ  point, . . . you havenâ€™t given him anything in his name.Â  Heâ€™s \r\n  just taking a chance working for you here.â€\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       And what was Mr. Satcherâ€™s response \r\n    to that?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:Â &nbsp;\r\n       He told me, â€œAw, Chip \r\n    knows he wonâ€™t ever have anything to worry about.Â  I will take \r\n    care of him.Â  He is going to get everything.â€Â  I \r\n    said, â€œWhy donâ€™t you go on and give him something now, at least give him the \r\n    house and all.Â  You say you are going to give him that . . . \r\n    . he said â€œYeah, I sure did that.â€\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Chipâ€™s father, James Satcher, testified against his own interest in the estate \r\n  that â€œAll during [Grandfatherâ€™s] lifetime, he told me that was Chipâ€™s house, \r\n  that it belonged to him.â€Â  Additionally, â€œHe told me that [Slide Hill] belonged \r\n  to Chip, that it was Chipâ€™s.Â  If he moved out there, it was his.Â  Daddy was \r\n  the type of person he [sic] was scared to stay by himself.â€Â  In light \r\n  of this testimony, we find clear and convincing evidence of an unambiguous promise \r\n  by Grandfather to leave Chip Slide Hill.\r\n  In reasonable reliance on that promise, Chip moved to the house and \r\n    provided Grandfather with companionship and other services for more than twenty \r\n    years.Â  In further reliance, Chip gave up his opportunity to \r\n    purchase a house, investing time and effort in Slide Hill and Grandfatherâ€™s \r\n    care.Â  All of this was foreseeable and intended by Grandfather \r\n    who did not wish to live alone on the property.Â  Additionally, \r\n    we find that Grandfatherâ€™s actions during the course of the time Chip lived \r\n    with him reinforced Chipâ€™s reliance on that promise.Â  Grandfatherâ€™s \r\n    subsequent inconsistent actions do not weaken Chipâ€™s promissory estoppel claim \r\n    for Slide Hill.Â  See Furman Univ. v. Waller, 124 \r\n    S.C. 68, 87, 117 S.E. 356, 362 (1923) (finding that in the presence of a clear \r\n    promise, the promisee may make the promise irrevocable by spending money or \r\n    incurring liabilities in furtherance of the enterprise or undertaking as intended \r\n    by the promisor).Â  Moreover, we believe it would be an injustice \r\n    not to apply the doctrine of promissory estoppel here because of the extreme \r\n    amount of time and energy Chip has expended in reliance on Grandfatherâ€™s promise.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find Chip has proved his claim to Slide Hill and remand \r\n    this matter for further proceedings consistent with our decision.\r\n  \r\nB. Farmland\r\nChip argues he is also entitled to the acres \r\n  he was farming at Grandfatherâ€™s death under this theory.Â  We disagree.\r\n    Although there was testimony that \r\n      Chip and Grandfather had some arrangement regarding the farmland, we find \r\n      insufficient evidence of a specific promise by Grandfather to leave Chip \r\n      the land he claims.Â  Chip does not seek all of Grandfatherâ€™s holdings; instead, \r\n      he seeks only the property he was actively farming.Â  Between the time he \r\n      left his job and Grandfatherâ€™s death, Chip gradually cleared and cultivated \r\n      698.11 acres of the 1138.35 acres Grandfather owned.Â  \r\n    The witnesses described general references \r\n      to â€œitâ€ or the farm, but none described Grandfatherâ€™s promise in terms of \r\n      the acreage Chip actually farmed.Â  For example, one witness testified Chip \r\n      was to have â€œRight there around Slide Hill Road is the only thing I can \r\n      say, that pond to the house.Â  The other farmland out there, I donâ€™t really \r\n      know.â€Â  The most telling evidence of Grandfatherâ€™s and Chipâ€™s understanding \r\n      comes from Chipâ€™s testimony on cross-examination, as quoted in part below:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       What did Mr. Satcher say about what farmland \r\n      was?Â  Did he tell you, did he ever make a statement to you that says, â€œIf \r\n      you come back and farm parcel one, parcel two, this field, that field, this \r\n      place, that placeâ€?Â  Did he ever describe it for you?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       He would â€“ no, not farm.Â  He did not say, \r\n      â€œTake this farmland, tract number one or whatever, and do that.â€Â  He just \r\n      said the farm.Â  I consider any crops thatâ€™s planted on land, whether itâ€™s \r\n      peaches, cotton, that is farmland.Â  That is myâ€“ thatâ€™s what you wanted to \r\n      know I think.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       I was asking how he described it.Â  You are \r\n      telling me he didnâ€™t describe it?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       No.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n     Other than just saying farmland?\r\n        &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       He just said farm, thatâ€™s right.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n    . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       And itâ€™s unclear in your mind right now \r\n      as to whether he meant it was going to be yours immediately or going to \r\n      be yours at some point in the future; isnâ€™t that true?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A: \r\n       I took it the way he said it.Â  The way he said it at the time \r\n      was when I left Westinghouse if I would do that, it would be mine.Â  I didnâ€™t \r\n      question that.Â  I just took his word for it. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n    \r\nThus, even \r\n  Chip was unclear as to the details of the promise.Â  In addition, no other witness \r\n  testified to any specific promises by Grandfather other than those relating \r\n  to Slide Hill.Â  Therefore, Chip has not shown by clear and convincing evidence \r\n  that there was an unambiguous promise that he would receive the property he \r\n  actively farmed.Â  Accordingly, we find the test for promissory estoppel has \r\n  not been met with respect to the farmland.Â  See Woods, 314 S.C. \r\n  at 505, 431 S.E.2d at 263.Â  \r\n    II.Â  Oral Gift\r\n    \r\nChip also \r\n  argues the trial court erred in finding he did not prove an oral gift of Slide \r\n  Hill and the farmland.Â  We disagree.\r\n    \r\nThe trial \r\n  court found insufficient evidence to avoid the requirement that transfers of \r\n  land must be in writing.Â  In order to remove a parol gift of land from the Statute \r\n  of Frauds, the donee must either: (1) take possession of the land and perfect \r\n  his title to it by adverse possession for the statutory period; or (2) prove \r\n  sufficient partial performance, such as taking full possession of the property \r\n  and making permanent and valuable improvements to it.Â  Brevard v. Fortune, \r\n  221 S.C. 117, 125-26, 69 S.E.2d 355, 358 (1952).Â  However, mere possession of \r\n  the property with only slight improvements is insufficient to remove an oral \r\n  gift from the Statute of Frauds.Â  Barnwell v. Barnwell, 323 S.C. 548, \r\n  557, 476 S.E.2d 493, 498 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n    \r\nChip asserts \r\n  title through sufficient partial performance.Â  He and Gigi testified about their \r\n  contributions to the farm and household, including improvements to the house. \r\n  Â Chip also cleared land and performed other farm maintenance. Â However, \r\n  Grandfather continued to pay the larger expenses such as replacing the roof \r\n  on the house and paying property taxes.Â  The trial court found that Chipâ€™s efforts \r\n  â€œwere not such as would have been made only by an owner.Â  A tenant or permissive \r\n  user would just as likely have made the same expenditures for his or her benefit \r\n  without regard to ownership of the house.â€Â  It also found that Chipâ€™s farming \r\n  activities were â€œas consistent with a tenant sharecrop arrangement as with ownership.Â  \r\n  Buying equipment, clearing land, and borrowing money for farm operations are \r\n  not activities restricted to property owners.â€ \r\n    Although evidence in \r\n      the record suggests a definite intent to give Chip the property, we agree \r\n      with the trial court that Chip did not prove an oral gift of Slide Hill \r\n      and the farmland by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Moreover, we agree with \r\n      the trial court that there was no delivery of the gift.Â  To constitute a \r\n      gift, there must be an actual or constructive delivery of possession of \r\n      the property.Â  Barnwell at 556, 476 S.E.2d at 497.Â  â€œThere can be \r\n      no such thing as a parol gift commencing in futuro.â€Â  Knight, 214 \r\n      S.C. at 441, 53 S.E.2d at 73.Â  Chipâ€™s evidence was not clear and convincing \r\n      as to when or if Grandfather actually gave the property to him.Â  Witnesses \r\n      testified that Grandfather said everything from â€œThis is Chipâ€™s placeâ€ to \r\n      â€œHe is going to get it all anyway.â€Â  Chip testified that he was shocked \r\n      that he had not been left the property in the will, which is inconsistent \r\n      with the theory of an outright gift.Â  Thus, we find Chip had only the expectation \r\n      of an outright gift.\r\n    \r\n    III.Â  Mutual Mistake \r\n    \r\nChip argues \r\n  the language of the lease agreement entered by Grandfather invalidates the partiesâ€™ \r\n  trial stipulation that there was no writing supporting Chipâ€™s claim of ownership \r\n  and he was entitled to relief from that stipulation under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  \r\n  We find no error.\r\n    \r\nJimmy Forrest \r\n  leased one of Grandfatherâ€™s peach orchards.Â  Article IX of the lease reads: \r\n\r\n\r\n    LESSEE shall herewith be given and granted water rights \r\n      for irrigation by LESSOR and by J.M. (Chip) Satcher, III, who is also \r\n      signing herewith as adjoining property owner for use as is needed during \r\n      the life of this lease and renewal periods.\r\n\r\n    (emphasis added).\r\n    \r\nChip contends \r\n  the quoted provision evidences an ownership interest in property and, therefore, \r\n  conflicts with a stipulation entered into at trial. \r\n  [3] Â  However, the stipulation covered writings that might bring Chipâ€™s \r\n  claim within the Statute of Frauds, not any written reference to Chipâ€™s claim.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find there is no conflict between the stipulation and the lease \r\n  provision.Â Â Â Â \r\n    \r\n    IV.Â  Jury Trial\r\n    \r\nChip argues \r\n  that he was entitled to a jury trial as of right under Rule 38(a), SCRCP, or \r\n  in the alternative, a jury trial should have been granted by the trial court \r\n  pursuant to Rule 39, SCRCP. Â We find both arguments are without merit.\r\n    \r\nChipâ€™s argument \r\n  under Rule 38(a) is not appealable at this time.Â  Orders affecting the mode \r\n  of trial affect substantial rights protected by statute [4]  and must, therefore, be immediately \r\n  appealed.Â  Lester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 266, 491 S.E.2d 240, 241 (1997).Â  \r\n  â€œMoreover, the failure to timely appeal an order affecting the mode of trial \r\n  effects a waiver of the right to appeal that issue.â€Â  Id.  \r\n    \r\nHowever, \r\n  Chip also sought a jury trial under Rule 39 which provides, â€œnotwithstanding \r\n  the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which such a demand \r\n  might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order \r\n  a trial by jury of any or all issues.â€Â  A decision denying a jury trial based \r\n  on Rule 39(b) is discretionary and not immediately appealable.Â  Rowe Furniture \r\n  Corp. v. Carolina Wholesale Furniture Co., 292 S.C. 575, 576, 357 S.E.2d \r\n  725, 725 (Ct.

Pa. Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 675, 230 \r\n  S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976).Â  Here, Chip did not request a jury trial until after \r\n  filing his second amended complaint.Â  The trial court denied the request after \r\n  considering the issues involved, prejudice to Chip, timeliness of the request, \r\n  the docket, and the reason for Chipâ€™s delayed request.Â  It found that transferring \r\n  the case to the jury docket would not result in the â€œspeedy decision on the \r\n  issues in the case.â€Â  In addition to the trial courtâ€™s findings, we are unable \r\n  to discern any prejudice to Chip from the denial of a jury trial because the \r\n  estateâ€™s legal counterclaims were dismissed.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse \r\n  of discretion.\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    \r\nFor the \r\n  foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\n    \r\n AFFIRMED \r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART. \r\n    \r\nHOWARD \r\n  and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n[1]S.C.

The special referee \r\n  found the insurer, South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm \r\n  Bureau), failed to make an effective offer of UIM coverage and reformed the \r\n  policy because it did not specifically offer amounts less than the minimum liability \r\n  limits carried by the insured. Farm Bureau appeals. We reverse. \r\n   (1) \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nBurch is seeking UIM coverage for an automobile accident \r\n  that occurred on October 22, 1995 when he was struck by an at-fault motorist \r\n  whose insurance did not cover all of his losses. Freeman was a passenger in \r\n  Burch's vehicle.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the accident, Burch was driving a 1993 Toyota \r\n  Tercel which was insured by Farm Bureau under Policy No. 805760. The policy \r\n  carried bodily injury liability limits of $50,000/$100,000, but the declaration \r\n  page did not list any UIM coverage.\r\n\r\nBurch originally obtained the policy in question in January \r\n  1986 for coverage on a 1985 Chevrolet Chevette. On the 1986 application, the \r\n  blocks for uninsured (UM) and UIM coverages listed no coverage, and these blocks \r\n  were initialed by Burch where he rejected the coverage. In January 1988, Farm \r\n  Bureau sent a separate offer form to Burch, which he signed rejecting UIM coverage. \r\n  He checked the box which provided, \"I want only the minimum UM benefits. I understand \r\n  NO UIM benefits are provided.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the enactment of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350, Farm \r\n  Bureau made a new offer of UIM coverage to Burch in November 1989 on a form \r\n  approved by the South Carolina Department of Insurance. Burch signed the form \r\n  on December 4, 1989, again rejecting UIM coverage.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Burch purchased the 1993 Toyota Tercel and transferred \r\n  coverage from the Chevrolet to the Toyota. Burch also added comprehensive and \r\n  collision coverages to his policy at that time and added a lienholder. \r\n\r\nAfter his automobile accident in October 1995, Burch brought \r\n  this declaratory judgment action seeking reformation of the insurance policy \r\n  to include UIM coverage for the accident. (2) \r\n  The matter was referred to the special referee with finality. The referee found \r\n  Farm Bureau did not make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage because Farm Bureau \r\n  \"failed to offer UIM coverage in amounts less than the minimum liability limits, \r\n  which were [Burch's] liability limits at the time the form was signed.\" The \r\n  referee reformed Burch's policy to include UIM coverage in the amounts of $50,000/$100,000, \r\n  which were his liability limits at the time of the accident. Farm Bureau appeals.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFarm Bureau contends the referee erred in finding it did \r\n  not make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Burch. We agree.\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-160 provides automobile insurance carriers \r\n  shall offer, \"at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up \r\n  to the limits of the insured['s] liability coverage to provide coverage in the \r\n  event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by \r\n  an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist. . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 \r\n  (2002). This statute mandates that \"underinsured motorist coverage in any amount \r\n  up to the insured's liability coverage must be offered to a policyholder.\" \r\n  Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 154, 311 S.E.2d 723, 726 \r\n  (1984) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe initial burden is on the insurer to prove a meaningful \r\n  offer of optional coverage has been made to the insured. Butler v. Unisun \r\n  Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996). If the insurer fails to comply \r\n  with its statutory duty to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to the insured, \r\n  the policy will be reformed, by operation of law, to include such coverage up \r\n  to the limits of liability insurance carried by the insured. Id. A noncomplying \r\n  offer has the legal effect of no offer at all. Id. \r\n\r\nIn State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (1987), our supreme court held \"the statute mandates \r\n  the insured to be provided with adequate information, and in such a manner, \r\n  as to allow the insured to make an intelligent decision of whether to accept \r\n  or reject the coverage.\" Id. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556. The Wannamaker \r\n  court expressly adopted a four-part standard to determine whether an insurer \r\n  has complied with its duty to offer the optional coverage: \"(1) the insurer's \r\n  notification process must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing; \r\n  (2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely \r\n  offer additional coverage in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligently \r\n  advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4)&nbsp;the \r\n  insured must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional \r\n  premium.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Legislature enacted Â§ 38-77-350, \r\n  which provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (A) The director or his designee shall approve a form which \r\n    automobile insurers shall use in offering optional coverages required to be \r\n    offered pursuant to law to applicants for automobile insurance policies. This \r\n    form must be used by insurers for all new applicants. The form, at a minimum, \r\n    must provide for each optional coverage required to be offered:\r\n\r\n  (1) a brief and concise explanation of the coverage,\r\n\r\n  (2) a list of available limits and the range of premiums \r\n    for the limits,\r\n\r\n  (3) a space for the insured to mark whether the insured \r\n    chooses to accept or reject the coverage and a space for the insured to select \r\n    the limits of coverage he desires,\r\n\r\n  (4) a space for the insured to sign the form which acknowledges \r\n    that he has been offered the optional coverages,\r\n\r\n  (5) the mailing address and telephone number of the Insurance \r\n    Department which the applicant may contact if the applicant has any questions \r\n    that the insurance agent is unable to answer.\r\n\r\n  (B) If this form is properly completed and executed by the \r\n    named insured it is conclusively presumed that there was an informed, knowing \r\n    selection of coverage and neither the insurance company nor any insurance \r\n    agent has any liability to the named insured or any other insured under the \r\n    policy for the insured's failure to purchase any optional coverage or higher \r\n    limits.\r\n\r\n  (D) Compliance with this section satisfies the insurer and \r\n    agent's duty to explain and offer optional coverages and higher limits and \r\n    no person, including, but not limited to, an insurer and insurance agent is \r\n    liable in an action for damages on account of the selection or rejection made \r\n    by the named insured. \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350 (2002).\r\n\r\nThe cover letter Farm Bureau sent to Burch in 1989 instructed \r\n  the insured to contact his or her agent if there were any questions about the \r\n  form or policy coverages, limits, or rates, and directed the insured to read \r\n  the instructions before filling out the form. Section I of the enclosure, entitled \r\n  \"EXPLANATION OF COVERAGES,\" stated in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Your automobile insurance policy does not automatically \r\n    provide any underinsured motorist coverage. You have, however, a right to \r\n    buy underinsured motorist coverage in limits up to the limits of liability \r\n    coverage you will carry under your automobile insurance policy. Some of \r\n    the more commonly sold limits of underinsured motorist coverage, together \r\n    with the additional premiums you will be charged, are shown upon this Form. \r\n    If there are other limits in which you are interested, but which are not \r\n    shown upon this Form, then fill in those limits. If your insurance company \r\n    is allowed to market those limits within this State, your insurance agent \r\n    will fill in the amount of increased premium. (Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explanation portion of the form also informed the insured \r\n  he could increase or decrease his UIM coverage in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the above section, Section III, entitled \"OFFER \r\n  OF UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE,\" listed various split limits and premium \r\n  amounts as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Limits of Coverage \r\n     Amount of Increased Premium\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    (These increased premium charges must be \r\n      filled in by your insurance agent prior to your decision and signature.)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    $ 15,000/$ 30,000/$15,000\r\n     $&nbsp; 4.76\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    $ 25,000/$ 50,000/$25,000\r\n    $&nbsp; 8.65\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    $ 50,000/$100,000/$25,000\r\n    $ 12.17\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    $100,000/$300,000/$50,000&nbsp;\r\n     $ 18.81\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    _______/_______/_______ &nbsp; \r\n    $_____\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n\r\n      $250,000/$500,000/$50,000\r\n\r\n    \r\n    $ 27.66\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Do you wish to purchase the coverage,\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \"Underinsured Motorist \r\n      Coverage\"?

Farm Bureau contends, consistent \r\n  with South Carolina law, its Commission-approved form listed optional UIM coverage \r\n  in five different amounts, included a blank line for the policyholder to write \r\n  in any amounts desired but not specifically listed, and explained that the policy \r\n  holder had the right to purchase UIM coverage \"up to\" the limits of the insured's \r\n  liability coverage. Farm Bureau argues its offer comes within the parameters \r\n  of the offers approved in Norwood v. Allstate Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 503, \r\n  489 S.E.2d 661 (Ct. App. 1997), Tucker v. Allstate Ins. Co., 337 S.C. \r\n  128, 522 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1999), and Rabb v. Catawba Ins. Co., 339 \r\n  S.C. 228, 528 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2000). We agree that the form used by Farm \r\n  Bureau in this case falls within the requirements of South Carolina's statutory \r\n  and case law, such that Farm Bureau made a meaningful and effective offer of \r\n  UIM coverage to Burch.\r\n\r\nIn Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d \r\n  758 (1996), our supreme court held Â§ 38-77-350 does not modify the requirement \r\n  of Â§ 38-77-160 that insurance companies offer UIM coverage \"up to\" the limits \r\n  of the insured's liability limits. Thus, the insured was entitled to reformation \r\n  of her policy where the insurer failed to offer coverage below the minimum liability \r\n  limits of the policy. However, the court also expressly approved the following \r\n  language from Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 462 S.E.2d \r\n  291 (Ct. App. 1995) as satisfying the requirements of Â§ 38-77-350 as they interact \r\n  with Â§ 38-77-160:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Some of the more commonly sold limits of underinsured motorist \r\n    coverage, together with the additional premiums you will be charged, are shown \r\n    upon this Form. If there are other limits in which you are interested, but \r\n    which are not shown upon this Form, then fill in those limits. If your insurance \r\n    company is allowed to market those limits within this State, your insurance \r\n    agent will fill-in the amount of increased premium.\r\n\r\n\r\nButler, 323 S.C. at 408, 475 S.E.2d at 761. This \r\n  exact language was used by Farm Bureau in its offer of UIM coverage to Burch.\r\n\r\nIn Norwood, Allstate specifically offered Norwood \r\n  three choices of UIM coverage up to Norwood's $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 liability \r\n  limits: $15,000/$30,000/$5,000, $15,000/$30,000/$10,000, and $25,000/$50,000/$10,000. \r\n  In addition, Allstate's offer form indicated Norwood could purchase UIM coverage \r\n  \"up to\" her liability limits. We found that Allstate's inclusion of at least \r\n  three specific options of UIM coverage below Norwood's liability limits, coupled \r\n  with the plain language of Allstate's offer form notifying Norwood that she \r\n  could increase or decrease her UIM coverage, satisfied the requirements of Â§ \r\n  38-77-160. Norwood, 327 S.C. at 506-507, 489 S.E.2d at 663.\r\n\r\nIn Tucker, Allstate's form offered five levels of \r\n  UIM coverage below Tucker's liability limits, and one above, but did not specifically \r\n  offer the exact same liability limits, nor any limits below the statutorily \r\n  required minimum limits. This court held the failure of the insurance company \r\n  to specifically offer the exact amount of liability coverage in its UIM offer \r\n  did not render the offer invalid because the offer specified that UIM coverage \r\n  could be purchased with limits up to the limits of liability coverage and informed \r\n  the insured UIM coverage could be increased or decreased. Tucker, 337 \r\n  S.C. at 131-32, 522 S.E.2d at 821-22.\r\n\r\nIn Rabb, this Court affirmed the lower court's finding \r\n  of a meaningful offer of UIM coverage where the form included the approved language \r\n  of Osborne and Butler. We found the form, which also included \r\n  \"a number of split limit and single limit UIM coverage amounts and their accompanying \r\n  premium costs,\" as well as blanks in which to fill in a different coverage and \r\n  premium amount, provided the insured with the opportunity to select coverage \r\n  in any amount, including amounts up to the limits of liability coverage. Rabb, \r\n  339 S.C. at 233-34, 528 S.E.2d at 695-96. As to the assertion that the offer \r\n  was ineffective because the insurer did not have advance approval to market \r\n  UIM premium rates under the minimum $15,000 limits, we found this lack of authorization \r\n  was irrelevant since the offers were meaningful and the insureds expressly rejected \r\n  them. Id. at 234-35, 528 S.E.2d at 696.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the foregoing, the circumstances present \r\n  in the case at hand lead us to the conclusion that Farm Bureau's offer of UIM \r\n  coverage to Burch effectively complied with the prevailing law, in particular \r\n  with the mandates of Â§Â§ 38-77-160 and 38-77-350. Although we find the placement \r\n  of blank lines between the $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 limits and the $250,000/$500,000/$50,000 \r\n  limits to be less than ideal, the explanation of coverage on the form contains \r\n  the precise language approved in Butler and Osborne, informing \r\n  the insured that if he is interested in other limits which do not appear with \r\n  the common examples on the form, he may fill in those amounts and his agent \r\n  will provide the attendant premium amounts if those limits are marketable within \r\n  this State. Additionally, there are instructions specifically advising the insured \r\n  that he may purchase UIM coverage in limits \"up to\" the limits of his liability \r\n  coverage. Finally, we note there is another blank line on the form, below the \r\n  various examples of commonly sold UIM limits, which asks the insured to specify \r\n  the limits desired, and specifically notes such limits cannot exceed the insured's \r\n  liability limits.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing circumstances, we conclude Farm Bureau \r\n  made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Burch. We therefore reverse the referee's \r\n  order granting reformation of the policy to include UIM coverage.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  We decide this case without oral \r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n 2.  By consent of all parties, Freeman \r\n  was added as a party plaintiff based on her interest in coverage as a passenger. \r\n  All references to \"Burch\" shall also include Freeman where appropriate. \r\n 3.  Farm Bureau asserts on appeal that \r\n  the reconstruction of the letter sent to Burch in November 1989 erroneously \r\n  showed minimum liability limits on Burch's existing policy, and that his limits \r\n  were actually $50,000/$100,000 in 1989 when Burch rejected the offer of UIM. \r\n  For purposes of this appeal, we assume Burch carried limits of $15,000/$30,000 \r\n  as found by the referee. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3543","title":"SCE&amp;G v.

Young, Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Opinion No. 3543\r\n    Heard June 4, 2002 - Filed August 19, 2002  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James B. Richardson, Jr., Patricia Smith; and Catherine \r\n          D. Taylor, all of Columbia, for appellants.\r\n\r\n        C. Mac Gibson, Jr., of Mt. Pleasant; Michael A. Molony and \r\n          Lea B. Kerrison, both of Charleston, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: South Carolina Electric and \r\n  Gas Company (SCE&amp;G) brought this action against the Town of Awendaw (Awendaw) \r\n  seeking a refund of fees it paid Awendaw under protest. The circuit court granted \r\n  Awendaw's motion for summary judgment. SCE&amp;G appeals. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWhen the Town of Awendaw was incorporated in 1992, all of \r\n  its inhabitants received their electric service from Berkeley Electric Cooperative. \r\n  Awendaw adopted an ordinance and executed a franchise agreement designating \r\n  Berkeley as the primary supplier of electrical energy to the town. In exchange, \r\n  Berkeley agreed to pay an annual franchise fee of 3% of its gross income derived \r\n  from sales of electricity in the town. \r\n\r\nSCE&amp;G had no customers within Awendaw at the time of \r\n  incorporation, but did service customers outside the town in areas assigned \r\n  to it by the Public Service Commission. As a result of the annexation of some \r\n  of these areas, approximately twenty-six SCE&amp;G customers and four SCE&amp;G \r\n  poles are now inside Awendaw's town limits. SCE&amp;G has 770 feet of electric \r\n  lines suspended above the town's public roads. SCE&amp;G has never entered into \r\n  a franchise agreement with Awendaw as the parties were unable to agree on terms. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAwendaw adopted a business license ordinance and notified \r\n  SCE&amp;G that the ordinance required all businesses to obtain a business license. \r\n  SCE&amp;G was required to pay a business license tax, which it did under protest. \r\n  After unsuccessful appeals to the Charleston County Business License/Users Fee \r\n  Appeals Board and the Awendaw Town Council, SCE&amp;G filed this action in circuit \r\n  court, seeking a refund of the license tax it paid under protest. In its answer, \r\n  Awendaw characterized the sum SCE&amp;G paid as a franchise fee. Both parties \r\n  moved for summary judgment. The court held SCE&amp;G's complaint was without \r\n  merit and granted Awendaw's motion for summary judgment. SCE&amp;G appeals. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this \r\n  Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Osborne&nbsp;v. \r\n  Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001) (citing Baughman&nbsp;v. \r\n  Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991)). \"In determining \r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" \r\n  Id.  (citing Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997)). \r\n  \"On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will \r\n  review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the \r\n  evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.\" Id. \r\n  (citing Williams v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d \r\n  447 (1976)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the circuit court erred in granting Awendaw's \r\n  summary judgment motion. It contends Awendaw does not have authority to charge \r\n  SCE&amp;G a franchise fee for the right to keeps its poles and lines on Doar \r\n  Road and Bulls Island Road. We agree.\r\n\r\nIn its answer to the amended complaint, Awendaw stated \"that \r\n  Plaintiffs are charged a franchise fee under the Defendant's business license \r\n  ordinance.\" Further, the master held, \"[t]he amounts paid under protest by SCE&amp;G \r\n  are franchise fees versus taxes.\" Because this issue has not been appealed, \r\n  the law of the case is that the charge is a franchise fee. See ML-Lee Acquisition \r\n  Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, \r\n  472 (1997) (unappealed ruling is law of case and should not be reconsidered \r\n  by appellate court); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, \r\n  160-61, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, \r\n  is the law of the case). Further, Awendaw's counsel conceded at oral arguments \r\n  that the sum should be considered a non-consensually imposed franchise fee.\r\n\r\n\"A franchise has been defined as a special privilege granted \r\n  by the government to particular individuals or companies to be exploited for \r\n  private profits.\" Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. \r\n  156, 165, 547 S.E.2d 862, 867 (2001) (citing City of Cayce v. AT &amp; T \r\n  Communs., 326 S.C. 237, 486 S.E.2d 92 (1997)). \"Government franchisees are \r\n  traditionally service-type businesses that are willing to pay the municipality \r\n  for the privilege of doing business with its citizens.\" Quality Towing, 345 \r\n  S.C. at 166, 547 S.E.2d at 867. \"A 'franchise' is a privilege of doing that \r\n  which does not belong to citizens generally by common right.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. Co-op., Inc., \r\n  287 S.C. 361, 338 S.E.2d 831 (1985), our supreme court balanced the rights of \r\n  a previously assigned electrical supplier and the annexing municipality. The \r\n  court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A franchisee possessing a valid PSC territorial assignment \r\n    to serve an area subsequently annexed or newly incorporated:\r\n\r\n  (1) Is permitted to continue service in that area to those \r\n    premises being served as of the date of annexation or incorporation;\r\n\r\n  (2) Is prohibited, without prior consent of the municipality, \r\n    from extending or expanding service in that area by the use of streets, alleys, \r\n    public property or public ways after the date of annexation or incorporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 370-71, 338 S.E.2d at 836.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the City of Abbeville  case, SCE&amp;G \r\n  is permitted to continue serving the twenty-six customers it serviced on the \r\n  date of annexation but is prohibited from extending or expanding its service \r\n  after that date without Awendaw's prior approval.\r\n\r\nSection 5-7-30 states, \"[e]ach municipality of the State \r\n  [has the authority to] grant franchises for the use of public streets and make \r\n  charges for them.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (Supp. 2001). Awendaw relies on BellSouth \r\n  v. City of Orangeburg, 337 S.C. 35, 522 S.E.2d 804 (1999), for the proposition \r\n  that section 5-7-30 permits it to impose a non-consensual franchise fee on SCE&amp;G. \r\n  The facts of BellSouth  are distinguishable. In BellSouth, the \r\n  municipality granted the telephone utility a franchise by ordinance in 1894, \r\n  but did not begin charging a fee for the franchise until 1993. BellSouth, \r\n  337 S.C. at 38-39, 522 S.E.2d at 805-06. Our supreme court held the city had \r\n  the power to impose this fee even though the franchise had formerly been gratuitous. \r\n  Id. at 44-45, 522 S.E.2d at 808-09. In the present case, however, Awendaw \r\n  has never granted SCE&amp;G a franchise. SCE&amp;G services customers in Awendaw \r\n  pursuant to the operation of the City of Abbeville decision, rather than \r\n  a franchise granted to it by Awendaw. As such, absent a franchise agreement, \r\n  Awendaw cannot impose a franchise fee on SCE&amp;G. Accordingly, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.  \r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., Dissenting:  Unlike the majority, \r\n  I would find BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. City of Orangeburg, 337 S.C. \r\n  35, 522 S.E.2d 804 (1999), applies to this action. I therefore respectfully \r\n  dissent.\r\n\r\nIn BellSouth, the telephone company brought a declaratory \r\n  judgment action seeking to invalidate the City's 1993 franchise ordinance, which \r\n  imposed a franchise fee on BellSouth's use of the City's public streets. Id. \r\n  at 38, 522 S.E.2d at 805. Prior to the enactment of the 1993 ordinance, the \r\n  parties operated under an 1894 franchise ordinance which permitted BellSouth \r\n  to use the streets exempt from taxes or fees for a period of five years. Id. \r\n  at 39, 522 S.E.2d at 806. (1) BellSouth contended \r\n  the 1993 ordinance violated a statute authorizing public utilities to maintain \r\n  and operate their lines over public roads. Id. at 43, 522 S.E.2d at 808. \r\n  Our supreme court determined the statutory authorization must be read in light \r\n  of article VIII, Â§ 15, of the state constitution, which provides: \"No law shall \r\n  be passed by the General Assembly granting the right to construct and operate \r\n  in a public street . . . without first obtaining the consent of the governing \r\n  body of the municipality. . . .\" Id. at 43-44, 522 S.E.2d at 808. The \r\n  court also discussed S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (Supp. 1998), which specifically \r\n  delegates to municipalities the power to grant franchises for the use of public \r\n  roads and charge fees for the franchises. BellSouth, 337 S.C. at 44, \r\n  522 S.E.2d at 808-09.\r\n\r\nThe court recognized, however, that the constitutional provision \r\n  did not permit municipalities to oust a utility by imposing fees for the continuation \r\n  of a franchise. Id. at 44, 522 S.E.2d at 808. The court concluded, however, \r\n  that the imposition of the fee, 5% of BellSouth's gross revenue earned within \r\n  the City and a one-time administrative fee, did not constitute an ouster. Id.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as a result of annexation, SCE&amp;G is using \r\n  the Town of Awendaw's roads to service its lines. Unlike in BellSouth, \r\n  the parties were not already operating under a franchise ordinance. I would \r\n  find, however, that the critical inquiry in this case is not whether a franchise \r\n  ordinance existed prior to the imposition of the franchise fee. See Athens-Clarke \r\n  County v. Walton Elec. Membership Corp., 454 S.E.2d 510, 513 (Ga. 1995) \r\n  (finding a franchise agreement unnecessary because under the enacted ordinance, \r\n  the utility company's continued use of the streets rendered them liable for \r\n  the payment of the fees). Rather, I would find the inquiry is whether, after \r\n  annexation, the imposition of a franchise fee constitutes an ouster, which is \r\n  prohibited under City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. Coop., Inc., 287 S.C. \r\n  361, 338 S.E.2d 831 (1985). I would conclude there is no evidence that the Town \r\n  of Awendaw's imposition of a franchise fee of 3% of SCE&amp;G's gross income, \r\n  derived from sales of electricity to customers located in Awendaw, would constitute \r\n  an ouster. Accordingly, I would affirm the circuit court.\r\n\r\n1.  In 1914, the original franchise ordinance \r\n  was expanded to include underground use of the public streets.

Weldon, of Greenville, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        John M. Croft, Samuel D. Harms, John R. Peace and \r\n          Joel D. Bieber, all of Easley, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: \r\n  Angel Ann Brown Gilliland brought this automobile negligence action against \r\n  unknown driver John Doe pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170. Following a \r\n  jury trial, Gilliland was awarded actual and punitive damages. Doe appeals. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1996, Gilliland was injured in an \r\n  automobile accident as she was returning from the store. According to Gilliland, \r\n  several young men tried to get her attention in the parking lot as she was leaving \r\n  the store. When she exited the parking lot in her vehicle, she testified she \r\n  was followed closely by these same young men and that, \"they were right on my \r\n  bumper and I was trying to get away . . . I was scared.\" With the unknown vehicle \r\n  behind her, Gilliland lost control of her car and ran off the road. The unknown \r\n  vehicle never came in contact with Gilliland's vehicle. \r\n\r\nGilliland filed this action against Doe, the unknown \r\n  driver of the unidentified vehicle, pursuant to section 38-77-170. She alleged \r\n  Doe's pursuit of her caused her to run off the road and strike a tree. Gilliland \r\n  suffered severe injuries as a result of the accident.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Gilliland presented the testimony of \r\n  Gayle Norris who was traveling in the opposite direction at the time of the \r\n  accident. Norris had stopped around the curve where Gilliland ran off the road \r\n  to yield the right of way before turning left. Norris testified that Gilliland's \r\n  car \"came around the curve and come [sic] almost completely around the curve \r\n  and then it just kind of went straight into a tree and a ditch.\" Norris also \r\n  testified she saw the headlights of another vehicle shining on Gilliland's bumper \r\n  just before Gilliland ran off the road.\r\n\r\nA jury awarded actual damages to Gilliland in the \r\n  amount of $110,880.00, and punitive damages in the amount of $96,250.00. This \r\n  appeal follows.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nDoe argues the trial court erred in denying his \r\n  motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, his \r\n  motion for a new trial, as Gilliland's evidence was insufficient to satisfy \r\n  the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"In ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence \r\n  and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most \r\n  favorable to the party opposing the motions.\" Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, \r\n  Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). \r\n  \"The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one \r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt.\" Id. \"This Court will reverse the trial \r\n  court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.\" Welch \r\n  v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing \r\n  Steinke, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999); Creech v. S.C. Wildlife &amp; \r\n  Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997)).\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-170 provides the following:\r\n\r\nIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which \r\n  causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, there is \r\n  no right of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, unless:\r\n\r\n(1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported \r\n  the accident to some appropriate police authority within a reasonable time, \r\n  under all the circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n\r\n(2) the injury or damage was caused by physical \r\n  contact with the unknown vehicle, or the accident must have been witnessed by \r\n  someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle; provided \r\n  however, the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts \r\n  of the accident contained in the affidavit;\r\n\r\n(3) the insured was not negligent in failing to \r\n  determine the identity of the other vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle \r\n  at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2002)(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn 1987, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-850 was amended \r\n  and recodified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170. The language of the new statute \r\n  is essentially identical to the old statute. However, one difference is that \r\n  the second condition for recovery under the statute was changed in order to \r\n  provide an alternate method of satisfying that condition. This condition can \r\n  now be met by either evidence of physical contact with the unknown vehicle or \r\n  evidence provided by an independent witness to the accident. \"The purpose of \r\n  the second condition [of 38-77-170] [was] to assure adequate proof the accident \r\n  involved a second unknown vehicle.\" Wausau  Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, \r\n  309 S.C. 269, 275, 422 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1992) (citing Coker v. Nationwide \r\n  Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 175, 161 S.E.2d 175 (1968)). \"The legislature, by the \r\n  1987 amendment, has determined an independent witness is sufficient to reduce \r\n  the possibility of false claims.\" Id. \r\n\r\nDoe contends Gilliland did not satisfy subsection \r\n  (2) of S.C. Code Â§ 38-77-170, in that there was no physical contact between \r\n  the two vehicles, and the testimony offered by Norris was insufficient to satisfy \r\n  the requirement that the accident be witnessed by someone other than the owner \r\n  or operator of the vehicle. Doe argues that subsection (2) requires that the \r\n  witness to the accident provide some evidence, independent of the operator of \r\n  the vehicle, that an unknown driver's conduct caused or contributed to the accident. \r\n  Gilliland, on the other hand, avers that the statute does not require the witness \r\n  to observe the cause of the accident, but instead requires only that the witness \r\n  observe the actual collision. Accordingly, Gilliland argues Norris's testimony \r\n  was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute, inasmuch as Norris \r\n  testified that she witnessed Gilliland's car run off the road and into a tree. \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen interpreting a statute, our primary concern \r\n  is to determine the legislature's intent, if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language of the statute when construed in the light of the statute's \r\n  intended purpose. \"The uninsured motorist legislation is remedial in nature, \r\n  enacted for the benefit of injured persons, and is to be liberally construed \r\n  so that the purpose intended may be accomplished.\" Franklin v. Devore, \r\n  327 S.C. 418, 421, 489 S.E.2d 651, 653 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Gunnels v. \r\n  Am. Liberty Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 161 S.E.2d 822 (1968)). \"However plain \r\n  the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, [we] will reject \r\n  that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that \r\n  it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat \r\n  the plain legislative intention.\" Collins v. Doe, 343 S.C. 119, 123-24, \r\n  539 S.E.2d 62, 64 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nWe find the intent behind the language in the uninsured \r\n  motorist legislation -- that the \"accident must be witness[ed] by someone other \r\n  than the owner . . . of the insured vehicle\" and the witness must attest \"to \r\n  the facts of the accident\" -- is that the witness must testify to more than \r\n  the actual collision itself. The witness must also be able to attest to the \r\n  circumstances surrounding the accident, i.e. what actions of the unknown driver \r\n  contributed to the accident. To hold otherwise would circumvent the legislative \r\n  intent of preventing fraudulent claims under the unknown motorist statute. See \r\n  Collins, 349 S.C. at 125, 539 S.E.2d at 65 (finding eyewitness testimony \r\n  sufficient where witness testified to the existence of an unknown vehicle who \r\n  failed to yield the right of way and ran driver off the road). See also \r\n  Georgia Uninsured Motorist Statute, Ga. Code Ann. Â§ 33-7-11(b)(2) (2001) (\"[I]n \r\n  order for the insured to recover under the endorsement where the owner or operator \r\n  of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured \r\n  is unknown, actual physical contact must have occurred between the motor vehicle \r\n  owned or operated by the unknown person and the person or property of the insured. \r\n  Such physical contact shall not be required if the description by the claimant \r\n  of how the occurrence occurred is corroborated by an eyewitness to the occurrence \r\n  other than the claimant.\"); Rogers v. Schuman-Mann Supply Co., 397 S.E.2d \r\n  463, 465 (Ga. Ct. App. 1990) (interpreting Georgia Uninsured Motorist statute \r\n  and finding that statutory language required eyewitness corroboration of the \r\n  description of the accident); Fisher v. Clarendon Nat. Ins. Co., 437 \r\n  S.E.2d 344, 346 (Ga. Ct. App. 1993) (finding testimony did not satisfy the \"eyewitness\" \r\n  requirements on the Uninsured Motorist Statute when witness did not observe \r\n  the accident, but only circumstantial evidence of the occurrence).\r\n\r\nNorris testified that she pulled up to an intersection \r\n  and saw the curve from which Gilliland appeared. She testified that \"two cars \r\n  started around the curve.\" She only saw the headlights of the second car, though \r\n  she stated she was \"convinced it was a car.\" She added she saw lights shining \r\n  on Gilliland's bumper but was unable to testify how close the alleged other \r\n  vehicle was to Gilliland's automobile. Norris's testimony fails to verify the \r\n  existence of an unknown vehicle, driven by an unknown driver, that caused Gilliland \r\n  to run off the road into the tree. We find that Norris's testimony was insufficient \r\n  to meet the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. section 38-77-170. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the denial of Doe's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, STILWELL and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; In light \r\nof our disposition of the above question, we decline to address the remaining \r\nissues on appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3545","title":"Black v.

Church, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: Neighboring landowners \r\n  brought an action against Jagdish and Usha Patel claiming superior title to \r\n  a portion of property Dr. Abraham Karrottukunnel conveyed to the Patels by general \r\n  warranty deed. The Patels commenced a third-party action against Dr. Karrottukunnel. \r\n  Although Dr. Karrottukunnel participated in the defense, he refused to defend \r\n  the action in its entirety. The master-in-equity ruled in favor of the Patels, \r\n  concluding the plaintiffs failed to establish superior title. In a separate \r\n  order, the master ruled the Patels could recover their costs from Dr. Karrottukunnel, \r\n  but not their attorney's fees. The Patels appeal. We affirm.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nSeveral years after purchasing the property, the \r\n  Patels completed construction of a separate one-story hotel building on the \r\n  property. The portion of the property on which this building was located is \r\n  the subject of the action against the Patels. Neighboring landowners sent a \r\n  letter to the Patels offering to sell them the disputed property for $400,000. \r\n  The Patels refused the offer and the neighbors filed suit for trespass and nuisance, \r\n  alleging the one-story building was situated on their property. They sought \r\n  a decree allowing them to demolish the building as well as granting them a portion \r\n  of the hotel's rental proceeds during the period of encroachment. \r\n\r\nThe Patels did not immediately answer the complaint, \r\n  but asked their title insurance company to defend. It refused. Thereafter, they \r\n  requested in writing that Dr. Karrottukunnel defend the action pursuant to the \r\n  terms of his general warranty deed. Dr. Karrottukunnel did not respond. The \r\n  Patels then filed their answer which included a third-party complaint against \r\n  Dr. Karrottukunnel for breach of warranty. \r\n\r\nThe case was referred to the master-in-equity. \r\n  Dr. Karrottukunnel did not defend the trespass and nuisance case on the Patels' \r\n  behalf, but, with his attorney, participated in the defense including offering \r\n  expert testimony from a surveyor. The master's ruling that the neighboring landowners \r\n  had failed to establish their title to the disputed land appears to have been \r\n  based in no small part on the expert testimony offered by Dr. Karrottukunnel. \r\n  In a separate order, the master held the Patels could recover the cost of their \r\n  defense of the title action from Dr. Karrottukunnel, but could not recover their \r\n  attorney's fees from him because of our supreme court's decision in Jeter \r\n  v. Glenn, 43 S.C.L. (9 Rich.) 374 (1856). (1) \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe Patels contend Dr. Karrottukunnel breached \r\n  his covenant of quiet enjoyment and the master erred in refusing to allow them \r\n  to recoup from Dr. Karrottukunnel the attorney's fees they incurred in defending \r\n  their title. We note Dr. Karrottukunnel participated in the underlying action \r\n  and defended the Patels' title by presenting evidence of its validity which \r\n  ultimately proved successful. However, because we agree with the master that \r\n  Jeter v. Glenn precludes the Patels' recovery of attorney's fees, we \r\n  need not decide whether Dr. Karrottukunnel breached any covenant of his general \r\n  warranty deed by failing to take over the defense entirely.\r\n\r\nA South Carolina general warranty deed embraces \r\n  all of the following five covenants usually inserted in fee simple conveyances \r\n  by English conveyors: (1) that the seller is seized in fee; (2) that he has \r\n  a right to convey; (3) that the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall quietly \r\n  enjoy the land; (4) that the land is free from all encumbrances; and (5) for \r\n  further assurances. The first and second covenants have the same effect as the \r\n  third and fourth covenants. \r\n\r\nMartin v. Floyd, 282 S.C. 47, 51, 317 S.E.2d \r\n  133, 136 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\n\r\nIn Jeter, Glenn conveyed by general warranty \r\n  deed property he purchased at a sheriff's sale to a person who later conveyed \r\n  the property by general warranty deed to Jeter. The widow of a prior owner of \r\n  the property sued Jeter to recover her dower. Jeter \"vouched in\" Glenn to defend. \r\n  (2) Jeter, 43 S.C.L. at 374-75. It is difficult if not impossible \r\n  to ascertain the extent to which Glenn participated in the defense of the suit, \r\n  if at all. After a verdict in the widow's favor, Jeter brought a breach of warranty \r\n  action against Glenn to recover the amount of the dower plus costs of litigation. \r\n  A jury awarded Jeter the amount assessed for the dower but no costs. Id. \r\n  at 375. On appeal, Jeter sought costs and attorney's fees incurred defending \r\n  against the widow's action. The Court of Appeals of South Carolina, predecessor \r\n  to our current supreme court, held Jeter was entitled to recover costs plus \r\n  interest from Glenn. Id. at 380. However, the court ruled Jeter \r\n  could not recover attorney's fees as \"there is no authority for including counsel \r\n  fees in the damages recoverable upon contracts.\" Id. at 380-81.\r\n\r\nThe Patels argue the claim in Jeter was \r\n  based on the covenant against encumbrances and is therefore distinguishable \r\n  from the instant action, which is based on the covenants of general warranty \r\n  and quiet enjoyment. We do not read Jeter so narrowly. The court in Jeter \r\n  noted that of the covenants included in a general warranty deed, the covenant \r\n  of quiet enjoyment and the covenant against all encumbrances \"may be united \r\n  in one.\" Jeter, 43 S.C.L. at 379. Moreover, the court explained that \r\n  although the general warranty \"may well be understood to embrace all the usual \r\n  covenants for title,\" it was enough for resolution of the claim that the deed \r\n  be shown to include the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the covenant against \r\n  encumbrances. Id. The court then analyzed the duties a grantor owes under \r\n  the language of the general warranty itself. Id. at 130. Because the Jeter \r\n  court addressed both the covenant against encumbrances and the covenant of quiet \r\n  enjoyment, we find no rational basis for distinguishing the decision.\r\n\r\nNext, the Patels assert we should not apply Jeter \r\nas precedent because, unlike this case, Jeter was awarded substantial damages \r\nagainst Glenn following the unsuccessful defense of his title. The Patels reason \r\n\"the Court in Jeter was concerned that an innocent buyer not be overcompensated. \r\nThe question in this case is far different; whether an innocent buyer is entitled \r\nto any compensation at all.\" We are unpersuaded by this argument as the Jeter \r\ncourt gave no indication that attorney's fees were denied because Jeter was awarded \r\ndamages against Glenn. We do not construe the opinion in Jeter as barring \r\nattorney's fees only when the underlying claim is successful. \r\nFinally, the Patels challenge the legal authority \r\n  cited in Jeter on the issue of attorney's fees. They submit the authority \r\n  cited by Jeter (Sedgwick on Damages) is no longer sound or, alternatively, \r\n  that this court should turn its attention to another passage from that text, \r\n  rather than the one relied upon in the decision. We cannot offer the Patels \r\n  relief from Jeter on this basis as we are bound, not by the underpinnings \r\n  of Jeter, but by Jeter itself. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 9 (\"The decisions \r\n  of the Supreme Court shall bind the Court of Appeals as precedents.\"); Duval \r\n  v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 339 S.C. 616, 620, 529 S.E.2d 566, 569 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000) (same). \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nCURETON and SHULER, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.  We granted the Patels' motion \r\n  to argue against the precedent of Jeter solely for the purpose of allowing \r\n  them to preserve the issue for further appellate review.  \r\n2.  Vouching-in is a common \r\n  law \"procedural device by which a defendant may give notice of suit to a third \r\n  party who is liable over to the defendant on the subject-matter of the suit, \r\n  so that the third party will be bound by the court's decision.\" Black's Law \r\n  Dictionary 1572 (7th ed. 1999). The device has been largely replaced \r\n  by third-party practice.
