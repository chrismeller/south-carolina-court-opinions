Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4349\r\nHeard February 5, 2008 â€“ Filed March 4,\r\n  2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tEdward E. Gilbert, of North Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid C. Alford, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  MBNA America Bank, N.A. (MBNA) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant\r\n  of Mark Christiansonâ€™s motion to vacate an arbitration award.Â  We affirm. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nMBNA filed an arbitration claim against Mark\r\n  Christianson in the National Arbitration Forum (the Forum) alleging he had\r\n  entered into and defaulted on a credit card agreement.Â  Christianson responded\r\n  several times asserting he never agreed to arbitrate.Â  Despite Christiansonâ€™s\r\n  assertions, the Forum continued with the claim and determined the parties\r\n  entered into an arbitration agreement.Â  The Forum awarded MBNA $13,579.57. \r\n \r\nMBNA filed an application for confirmation\r\n  of the arbitration award in the circuit court, and Christianson filed a\r\n  motion to vacate the award.Â  MBNA filed a Memorandum of Law in response and\r\n  attached an unsigned, undated photocopy of one page of a pamphlet it alleges is\r\n  the arbitration agreement.Â  MBNA provided no other evidence of the existence of\r\n  an arbitration agreement between these parties.Â  Â \r\nThe circuit court found MBNA failed to provide evidence\r\n  Christianson agreed to arbitration and the Forum had no jurisdiction to hear\r\n  the matter absent an arbitration agreement.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court granted\r\n  Christiansonâ€™s motion to vacate the award.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnless the parties otherwise provide, the question of\r\n  the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination. Â Zabinski\r\n    v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001). Â Determinations\r\n  of arbitrability are subject to de novo review, but if any evidence reasonably\r\n  supports the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings, this court will not overrule\r\n  those findings.Â  Stokes v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609-10,\r\n  571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The South Carolina\r\n  Uniform Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)\r\nThe\r\n  parties to this appeal cite to South Carolina and federal law governing\r\n  arbitration.Â  Christianson argues MBNA â€œshould not be allowed to argue federal\r\n  or state [law] at its whim.â€Â  Accordingly, we initially address this conflict\r\n  of laws issue.Â  Unless the parties have otherwise contracted, the FAA applies\r\n  in federal or state court to any arbitration agreement regarding a transaction\r\n  that involves interstate commerce.Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343\r\n  S.C. 531, 538, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 (2001).Â  â€œâ€˜[I]nvolving commerceâ€™ is the same\r\n  as â€˜affecting commerce,â€™ which has been broadly interpreted to mean Congress\r\n  intended to utilize its powers to regulate interstate commerce to its full\r\n  extent.â€Â  Blanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 540, 570 S.E.2d 565, 568\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œTo ascertain whether a transaction involves commerce within\r\n  the meaning of the FAA, the court must examine the agreement, the complaint,\r\n  and the surrounding facts.â€ Â Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 594, 553 S.E.2d at\r\n  117.Â  Here, the underlying facts involve interstate commerce.  \r\nDespite application of the\r\n  FAA, however, South Carolina law applies to the initial determination of\r\n  whether an arbitration agreement exists.Â  See Munoz, 343 S.C. at\r\n  539, 542 S.E.2d at 364 (General contract principles of state law apply in a\r\n  courtâ€™s evaluation of the enforceability of an arbitration clause.).Â  See\r\n    also MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. v. Straub,&nbsp;815 N.Y.S.2d 450, 452&nbsp;(N.Y.\r\n  City Civ. Ct. 2006) (â€œJudicial review of the petition should commence under the\r\n  New York provisions governing confirmation of an arbitration award, but if the\r\n  written contract and cardholder agreement are established by the petition the\r\n  manner of service of the notice and award and treatment of supplementary\r\n  information should be considered under the Federal Arbitration Act provisions .\r\n  . . .â€).Â  Accordingly, we apply South Carolina law to the initial determination\r\n  of arbitrability but look to federal law for additional guidance.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nII. Motion to Vacate the\r\n  Arbitration Award\r\nMBNA argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in granting Christiansonâ€™s motion to vacate the arbitration\r\n  award because the motion was filed more than ninety days subsequent to the\r\n  entry of the award.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn application to vacate,\r\n  modify, or correct an arbitration award must be made within ninety days. Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-48-130(b) (2005) (â€œAn application [for vacating, modifying, or\r\n  correcting the award] shall be made within ninety days after delivery of a copy\r\n  of the award to the applicant.â€).Â  See also 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 12 (1999) (â€œNotice\r\n  of a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award must be served upon the\r\n  adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or\r\n  delivered.â€).\r\nHowever,\r\n  in this case, Christianson disputed the existence of an agreement to arbitrate\r\n  with MBNA prior to entry of the award.Â  â€œOn application, the court may stay an\r\n  arbitration proceeding commenced or threatened on a showing that there is no\r\n  agreement to arbitrate.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(b) (2005).Â  Similarly, the\r\n  FAA provides:\r\n\r\n\tA party\r\n  aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate\r\n  under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any United States\r\n  district court . . . for an order directing that such arbitration proceed. . . .Â \r\n  If the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal\r\n  to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial\r\n  thereof. Â If no jury trial be demanded by the party alleged to be in default .\r\n  . ., the court shall hear and determine such issue. . . .Â  [If a jury trial is\r\n  demanded and] the jury find[s] that no agreement in writing for arbitration was\r\n  made . . . the proceeding shall be dismissed. \r\n\r\n9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 4 (1999).Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find support from the Kansas Supreme Court in MBNA America Bank, N.A. v.\r\n    Credit, 132 P.3d 898 (Kan. 2006).Â  Therein,\r\n  the Court noted MBNA could not rely on the debtorâ€™s tardiness in\r\n  challenging the award if the arbitrator never had jurisdiction to arbitrate and\r\n  enter an award.Â  Credit, 132 P.3d at 900. Â The Kansas court stated:Â  â€œAn\r\n  agreement to arbitrate bestows such jurisdiction. Â When the existence of the\r\n  agreement is challenged, the issue must be settled by a court before the\r\n  arbitrator may proceed.â€Â  Id. (citing 9 U.S.C. Â§ 4 (2000); Kan. Stat.\r\n  Ann. Â§ 5-402).[1]Â \r\n  The court found that â€œ[u]nder both federal and state law, [the debtorâ€™s]\r\n  objection to the arbitrator meant the responsibility fell\r\n  to MBNA to litigate the issue of the agreementâ€™s existence. Â Neither MBNA, as\r\n  the party asserting existence of an arbitration agreement, nor the arbitrator\r\n  was simply free to go forward with the arbitration as though [the debtor] had\r\n  not challenged the existence of an agreement to do so.â€ Â Id. at 900-01\r\n  (citing 9 U.S.C. Â§ 4; Kan. Stat. Ann. Â§ 5-402). Â The Kansas court looked â€œto\r\n  MBNA as the appellant to demonstrate that the objection was somehow ineffective\r\n  to trigger its responsibility to seek court intervention to compel arbitration.â€Â  Id. at 900.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIf\r\n  there is a challenge to the arbitration, it is for the courts, not the\r\n  arbitrator, to decide whether the agreement to arbitrate exists and whether the\r\n  issue in dispute falls within the agreement to arbitrate. . . . Under either the Federal\r\n  Act or the Kansas Act, the arbitratorâ€™s power to resolve the dispute must find\r\n  its source in the agreement between the parties. The arbitrator has no\r\n  independent source of jurisdiction apart from consent of the parties . . . . Â \r\n\r\nId. at 901 (quoting Dreyer, Arbitration Under the\r\n  Kansas Arbitration Act: The Role of the Courts, 59 J. Kan. B. Assâ€™n. 33, 35\r\n  (May 1990)) (omissions by court).Â  Accordingly, once Christianson disputed the\r\n  existence of an arbitration agreement, the Forum did not have jurisdiction to enter\r\n  an arbitration award until MBNA petitioned the courts to compel arbitration. \r\n \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  MBNA did not demonstrate to the circuit court that Christianson had agreed to\r\n  arbitrate.Â  Before a circuit court confirms an arbitration award subject to the\r\n  Federal Arbitration Act, there must be evidence of an arbitration agreement.Â  9\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 13 (1999).Â  The Kansas Supreme Court, addressing this issue in Credit,\r\n  found:\r\n\r\n\tMBNA\r\n  failed to attach a copy of the arbitration agreement to its motion to confirm\r\n  the award. Â This violated the Federal Arbitration Act for which MBNA intermittently\r\n  expresses respect. . . . This alone would have justified\r\n  the district court in its decision to deny MBNAâ€™s motion to confirm the award.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n132 P.3d at 901 (citing 9\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 13 (2000)).Â Â  According to 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 13:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  party moving for an order confirming, modifying, or correcting an award shall,\r\n  at the time such order is filed with the clerk for the entry of judgment\r\n  thereon, also file the following papers with the clerk:\r\n\t(a) The agreement; the selection or\r\n  appointment, if any, of an additional arbitrator or umpire; and each written\r\n  extension of the time, if any, within which to make the award.\r\n\r\n9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 13 (1999).Â  MBNA denies this code section requires it to file the\r\n  agreement with its application for confirmation of the award.Â  MBNA argues the\r\n  statute merely requires the agreement to be filed before the clerk performs the\r\n  ministerial act of entering the judgment.Â  We again look to foreign\r\n  jurisdiction for guidance in rejecting this argument.Â  See, e.g., MBNA\r\n    Am. Bank, N.A. v. Boata, 893 A.2d 479 (Conn. Ct. App. 2006); MBNA Am.\r\n      Bank, N.A. v. Berlin, 2005 WL 3193850 (Ohio Ct. App. 2005). Â As stated by\r\n  the Kansas Supreme Court, â€œGiven MBNAâ€™s casual approach to this litigation, we\r\n  are not surprised that [a national trend in which consumers are questioning\r\n  MBNA and whether arbitration agreements exist] may be growing.â€Â  Credit,\r\n  132 P.3d at 902.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find no error by the circuit court in granting Christiansonâ€™s motion to\r\n  vacate the arbitration award.\r\nIII.Â  Notice\r\nMBNA next contends\r\n  the circuit court improperly relied on issues Christianson raised for the first\r\n  time at the hearing.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for appellate review. \r\n \r\nChristianson\r\n  proceeded pro se in filing his motion to vacate the arbitration\r\n  award.Â  Before the hearing on the motion to vacate and MBNAâ€™s motion to confirm\r\n  the award, Christianson obtained counsel, who filed a memorandum.Â  MBNAâ€™s\r\n  counsel could not attend the hearing but sent another attorney in his stead.Â  At\r\n  the hearing, this attorney did not raise the issue that MBNA lacked notice of\r\n  Christiansonâ€™s memorandum, nor did the attorney ask for a continuance.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal,\r\n  it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional\r\n  circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Kansas statutes, relied upon by the Kansas\r\n  Supreme Court, are identical to our corresponding statutes.Â  See Kan.\r\n  Stat. Ann. Â§ 5-402 &amp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20 (proceedings to compel or\r\n  stay arbitration); Kan. Stat. Ann. Â§ 5-411 &amp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-120\r\n  (confirmation of an award); Kan. Stat.

Hawthorne Barrett, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: In\r\n  this action for wrongful death and negligence under the survival statute,\r\n  Floree Hooper appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment toEbenezer Senior Services and Rehabilitation Center (Ebenezer) based on the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nIn February 2003, Albert Clinton became a resident of\r\n  Ebenezer, a nursing home facility.Â  Two months later, Clinton was taken to a\r\n  hospital and remained there until his death on May 15, 2003.Â  Hooper, as\r\n  Personal Representative of Clintonâ€™s Estate, filed an action against Ebenezer on\r\n  February 6, 2006, for negligence under the survival statute and wrongful death.\r\nWhen Hooperâ€™s attorney (Counsel) received the filed\r\n  pleadings from the clerk of court, he called Ebenezerâ€™s telephone number.Â  A\r\n  receptionist answered, â€œAgape Rehabilitation.â€Â  Counsel inquired about Ebenezer\r\n  Senior Services and was told the business had been sold and was now Agape\r\n  Rehabilitation (Agape).Â  A telephone search revealed Agape had the same street\r\n  address as Ebenezer.Â  Counsel drove to the location, and signage identified the\r\n  facility as â€œAgape Rehabilitation of Rock Hill.â€Â   \r\nCounsel searched the South Carolina Secretary of\r\n  Stateâ€™s website and found a current listing for Ebenezer as a domestic entity\r\n  in good standing listing a registered agent: â€œJack G. Hendrix, Jr., 1415 Richland Street, Columbia, SC.â€Â  Counsel forwarded the pleadings to the Richland County\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s office for service upon Hendrix, but service was not accomplished\r\n  because he â€œmoved to an unknown address on Assembly St.â€Â   \r\nCounsel hired an investigator to locate Hendrix.Â  The\r\n  investigator discovered an address in Pelion, and Counsel again sent the\r\n  pleadings to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department for service.Â  The\r\n  Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department returned the pleadings because the address\r\n  was in Lexington County.Â  Counsel transmitted the pleadings to the Lexington\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department for service, and the Sheriffâ€™s office responded\r\n  with an affidavit stating the department was unable to serve the pleadings\r\n  because â€œper neighbor [Hendrix] left his wife a year ago and unknown where he\r\n  lived now.â€Â   \r\nHaving exhausted his options of service by sheriff,\r\n  Counsel hired an investigator to take the papers to Agape.Â  The investigator\r\n  served the pleadings upon Janet Inkelaar, the administrator of Agape\r\n  Rehabilitation, on June 15, 2006, at the facility.Â  Inkelaar indicated she was authorized\r\n  to accept service on Ebenezerâ€™s behalf.Â  By Hooperâ€™s calculation, service was\r\n  completed 129 days after the filing of the summons and complaint.Â   \r\nEbenezer moved the circuit court to dismiss the\r\n  action, asserting it was not commenced in a timely fashion pursuant to Rule 3,\r\n  SCRCP, and section 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code, the three year statute\r\n  of limitations.Â  Hooper argued: (1) the statute of limitations should be\r\n  equitably tolled; (2) the 120-day period under Rule 3(a), SCRCP, should not begin\r\n  to run until the end of the limitations period; (3) Ebenezer should be estopped\r\n  from asserting the statute of limitations due to its own unlawful actions; and\r\n  (4) under Rule 86, SCRCP, the former version of Rule 3, SCRCP, should apply to\r\n  permit service within a reasonable time after filing following delivery to the\r\n  sheriff.Â   \r\nThe Master in Equity, sitting as a Special Circuit Judge,\r\n  ruled the action was not timely commenced because it was not served within 120\r\n  days of filing.Â  Hooper sought reconsideration of the courtâ€™s order, and a\r\n  hearing was scheduled.Â  Hooper then served notice of appeal from the dismissal,\r\n  and the hearing on reconsideration was not held.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the 120 day period for \r\n\t\t\tservice under Rule 3(a), SCRCP, commence when the action was filed or when the limitations period\r\n  expired?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court properly \r\n\t\t\trefuse to equitably toll the statute of limitations?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tIs it unjust and inequitable to \r\n\t\t\tpermit Ebenezer to assert the statute of limitations as a defense?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tShould the circuit court have \r\n\t\t\tapplied the former Rule 3(a), pursuant to Rule 86, SCRCP, and determined that service was timely when\r\n  completed within a reasonable time after delivery to the sheriff?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\tSummary judgment is defined by Rule 12(c), SCRCP:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIf, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters\r\n  outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the Court, the\r\n  motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided\r\n  in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present\r\n  all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId.\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary\r\n  judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\r\n  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Â In determining whether\r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.

Marcus,\r\n  322 S.C. 150, 470 S.E.2d 389 (Ct. App. 1996):\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  statute of limitations reduces the interval between the accrual and\r\n  commencement of a right of action to a fixed period, thereby putting to rest\r\n  claims after the passage of time.Â  This procedural device operates as a defense\r\n  to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of action.Â  Unless an action\r\n  is commenced before expiration of the limitations period, the plaintiff's claim\r\n  is normally barred.\r\n\r\nId. at 152, 470 S.E.2d at 390\r\n  (citations omitted).\r\nThe purpose\r\n  of statutes of limitation is to ensure litigation is â€œbrought within a\r\n  reasonable time in order that evidence be reasonably available and there be\r\n  some end to litigation.â€Â  City of North Myrtle Beach v.

Floydâ€™s Wholesale, 299 S.C. 127,\r\n  382 S.E.2d 907 (1989), our Supreme Court determined the statute of limitations\r\n  is tolled for a workersâ€™ compensation claim during a reliance period in â€œwhich\r\n  an employee is induced by the employer to believe his claim is compensable and\r\n  will be taken care of without the employee filing a claim.â€Â  Id. at 129,\r\n  382 S.E.2d at 908.Â  The Court announced:  \r\n\r\n\tWe believe the rule . . .\r\n  which tolls the statute of limitations during the reliance period is the better\r\n  rule.Â  The fact finder in these types of cases must necessarily determine that\r\n  a reliance period existed and that the claim is otherwise compensable.Â  To hold\r\n  that claims must be filed within a reasonable time following the end of the\r\n  reliance period would add yet another layer of fact finding resulting in\r\n  greater uncertainty as to which claims are compensable.Â  This uncertainty would\r\n  inevitably result in an increase in litigation associated with such claims.\r\n\r\nId. at 129-130, 382 S.E.2d at 909.\r\nTiralango\r\n  v. Balfry, 335 S.C. 359, 517 S.E.2d\r\n  430 (1999), addressed tolling the statute of limitations with respect to\r\n  non-resident motorists.Â  Tiralango, a New York resident, and Balfry, a Quebec resident, were involved in an auto accident in Myrtle Beach on April 5, 1992.Â  Balfryâ€™s address was recorded on the police report the day of the accident, but\r\n  Tiralango did not request and receive a copy of the report for approximately\r\n  one month.Â  Tiralango filed a summons and complaint against Balfry on March 21, 1995, and served Balfry on April 11, 1995.Â  The action was filed before the\r\n  running of the three year statute of limitations, but Balfry was not served\r\n  within three years.Â  (The former Rule 3, SCRCP, did not include the provision\r\n  allowing for service within 120 days of the filing of the summons and complaint\r\n  and required service within the statute of limitations.)Â  The South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review whether the statute of limitations should be\r\n  tolled while the defendantâ€™s address is unknown to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\tThe Court\r\n  inculcated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tResolution\r\n  of this issue turns upon construction of the phrase â€œknown to the plaintiffâ€ in \r\n\t\tMeyer.Â  If construed as a requirement of actual, subjective\r\n  knowledge, then the statute is tolled for the period during which Tiralango did\r\n  not â€œknowâ€ Balfry's address.Â  If construed as an objective knowledge\r\n  requirement, i.e., â€œcould have/should have known,â€ then the statute is not\r\n  tolled as Balfry's address was at all times available.Â  We find the latter\r\n  construction more consistent with our opinion in Meyer, and with\r\n  the reasoning in other jurisdictions.\r\n\t\tIn Meyer, we addressed the rationale for holding the statute is not tolled when the\r\n  defendant is amenable to service, stating, â€œ[t]o construe the tolling statute\r\n  in the manner urged by the plaintiff (i.e., as being tolled until the plaintiff\r\n  decides to serve the defendant) would allow suits to be postponed indefinitely,\r\n  for no good purpose, and to be brought in some cases at the virtually unlimited\r\n  pleasure of the plaintiff.â€Â  330 S.C. at 183, 498 S.E.2d at 639.Â  In the\r\n  present case, were we to apply an actual knowledge requirement, Tiralango would\r\n  have been free to wait six months or one year (or longer) to obtain the report\r\n  and the statute would nonetheless be tolled, notwithstanding the address was at\r\n  all times available to him.Â  Such a result is patently inconsistent with our\r\n  holding in Meyer and, accordingly, we decline to so hold.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId., 335 S.C. at 362, 517 S.E.2d at 432 (footnote\r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  doctrine of equitable tolling is articulated with exactitude:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  time requirements in lawsuits between private litigants are customarily subject\r\n  to equitable tolling if such tolling is necessary to prevent unfairness to a\r\n  diligent plaintiff.Â  However, equitable tolling, which allows a plaintiff to\r\n  initiate an action beyond the statute of limitations deadline, is typically\r\n  available only if the claimant was prevented in some extraordinary way from\r\n  exercising his or her rights, or, in other words, if the relevant facts present\r\n  sufficiently rare and exceptional circumstances that would warrant application\r\n  of the doctrine.\r\n\t\tEquitable\r\n  tolling has been deemed available whereâ€” \r\n\t\tâ€”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extraordinary circumstances\r\n  prevented the plaintiff from filing despite his or her diligence.\r\n\t\tâ€”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the plaintiff actively pursued his\r\n  or her judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory\r\n  period or the claimant has been induced or tricked by the defendant's\r\n  misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.\r\n\t\tâ€”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the plaintiff, despite all due\r\n  diligence, is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of\r\n  his or her claim. \r\n\t\tIt has\r\n  been held that equitable tolling applies principally if the plaintiff is\r\n  actively misled by the defendant about the cause of action or is prevented in\r\n  some extraordinary way from asserting his or her rights.Â  However, it has also\r\n  been held that the equitable tolling doctrine does not require wrongful conduct\r\n  on the part of the defendant, such as fraud or misrepresentation.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n51\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Limitation of Actions Â§ 174 (2007).\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of Alaska distinguished the concepts of equitable tolling and\r\n  equitable estoppel:\r\n\r\n\tFederal\r\n  precedent permits equitable estoppel or equitable circumstances to extend the\r\n  three-year limitations period.Â  Many federal cases seem to merge these two\r\n  doctrines.Â  For example, Seattle Audubon Society\r\n    v. Robertson [931 F.2d 590 (9th Cir. 1991), revâ€™d on\r\n      other grounds, 503 U.S. 429 (1992)] stated\r\n  that equitable tolling may be applied when plaintiffs are â€œprevented from\r\n  asserting their claims by some kind of wrongful conduct on the part of the\r\n  defendant.â€Â  But it is only equitable estoppel that requires\r\n  wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, i.e., fraud or\r\n  misrepresentation.Â  The federal\r\n  equitable tolling doctrine, on the other hand,\r\n  does not require any conduct by the defendant.\r\n\r\nAbbott v. State,&nbsp;979 P.2d 994, 997-998&nbsp;(Alaska 1999)\r\n  (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court elucidated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tFederal\r\n  courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly. We have allowed\r\n  equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has\r\n  actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during\r\n  the statutory period, or where the complainant has\r\n  been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing\r\n  deadline to pass.Â  We have generally been much less forgiving in\r\n  receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in\r\n  preserving his legal rights.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIrwin v. Depâ€™t of Veterans\r\n  Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990) (footnotes and citations omitted).Â  The Court annunciated: â€œBut the principles of\r\n  equitable tolling described above do not extend to what is at best a garden\r\n  variety claim of excusable neglect.â€Â  Id.\r\nCourts\r\n  often apply equitable tolling when a plaintiff has timely pursued his rights\r\n  through an administrative body or where a plaintiff was enjoined or otherwise\r\n  legally prohibited from bringing his claims in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n\tArizona courts have recognized and applied the equitable\r\n  tolling doctrine.Â  See Hosogai v. Kadota, 145 Ariz. 227,\r\n  229, 700 P.2d 1327, 1329 (1985) (applying doctrine when second wrongful death\r\n  claim untimely filed after successful verdict on first claim overturned on\r\n  appeal due to defective service of process); Kosman [v. State], 199\r\n  Ariz. 184, Â¶Â¶ 6, 10, 16 P.3d at 213 (applying doctrine where plaintiff prisoner\r\n  failed to timely file notice of claim against state because he first pursued\r\n  claim through prison's administrative grievance procedure); Kyles v.\r\n    Contractors/Eng'rs Supply, Inc., 190 Ariz. 403, 404, 406, 949 P.2d 63, 64,\r\n  66 (App.1997) (applying doctrine when right-to-sue letter from Arizona Attorney\r\n  General's office contained incorrect date by which plaintiff was required to\r\n  sue on his claim).\r\n\r\nMcCloud v. State, Ariz. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 170 P.3d 691,\r\n  696&nbsp;(Ariz. Ct. App. 2007).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Supreme Court of California enunciated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEquitable\r\n  tolling is a judge-made doctrine which operates independently of the literal\r\n  wording of the Code of Civil Procedure to suspend or extend a statute of\r\n  limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.Â  This\r\n  court has applied equitable tolling in carefully considered situations to\r\n  prevent the unjust technical forfeiture of causes of action, where the\r\n  defendant would suffer no prejudice.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLantzy v. Centex Homes, 73 P.3d 517, 523 (Cal. 2003) (quotations and citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  Delaware Supreme Court examined the application of equitable tolling where\r\n  defendants were subject to substituted service:\r\n\r\n\tIn any\r\n  event, whatever the precise argument made may be, we think that the Delaware statute of limitations on actions for personal injuries runs continuously without\r\n  interruption when there is available to the plaintiff throughout the period an acceptable means\r\n  of bringing the defendant into court.Â  Therefore, the answer to the first\r\n  question posed is that there has been no tolling of the statute of limitations\r\n  since these defendants, at all times, were subject to substituted service.\r\n\r\nHurwitch\r\n  v. Adams, 155 A.2d 591,594&nbsp;(Del.\r\n  1959).\r\nThe Florida court observed, as an equitable remedy,\r\n  the prejudice to the defendant must be considered before application:\r\n\r\n\tThe doctrine of equitable\r\n  tolling was developed to permit under certain circumstances the filing of a\r\n  lawsuit that otherwise would be barred by a limitations period.Â  \r\n\tSee Bailey v. Glover, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 342, 22 L.Ed. 636 (1874).Â  The tolling doctrine is used in the interests of\r\n  justice to accommodate both a defendant's right not to be called upon to defend\r\n  a stale claim and a plaintiff's right to assert a meritorious claim when\r\n  equitable circumstances have prevented a timely filing.Â  Equitable tolling is a\r\n  type of equitable modification which â€œâ€˜focuses on the plaintiff's excusable\r\n  ignorance of the limitations period and on [the] lack of prejudice to the\r\n  defendant.â€™â€Â  Cocke v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561\r\n  (11th Cir.1987) (quoting Naton v. Bank of California, 649 F.2d 691, 696\r\n  (9th Cir.1981)).Â  Contrary to the analysis of the majority below, equitable\r\n  tolling, unlike estoppel, does not require active deception or employer\r\n  misconduct, but focuses rather on the employee with a reasonably prudent regard\r\n  for his rights.\r\n\r\nMachules v. Depâ€™t of\r\n  Admin., 523 So.2d 1132,\r\n  1133-1134&nbsp;(Fla. 1988) (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n\tMaryland case law\r\n  disfavors tolling the statute of limitations:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWe have long maintained a\r\n  rule of strict construction concerning the tolling of the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  Absent legislative creation of an exception to the statute of\r\n  limitations, we will not allow any implied and equitable exception to be\r\n  engrafted upon it.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHecht\r\n  v.

Stripling, 675 So.2d 1242, 1244 (Miss.1996) (citing\r\n\t\tTraina v. United States, 911 F.2d 1155 (5th Cir. 1990)).Â  There is\r\n  nothing in the record to indicate that the representatives' failure to file was\r\n  anything other than a result of their own inactions or omissions.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCity of Tupelo v. Martin, 747 So.2d 822, 829&nbsp;(Miss. 1999).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Supreme Court of New Mexico opined:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEquitable\r\n  tolling is a nonstatutory tolling theory which suspends a limitations period.Â \r\n\t\tSee Gathman-Matotan Architects and Planners, Inc. v. State Dep't of Fin. &amp;\r\n    Admin., 109 N.M. 492, 494, 787 P.2d 411, 413 (1990).Â  Equitable tolling\r\n  typically applies in cases where a litigant was prevented from filing suit\r\n  because of an extraordinary event beyond his or her control.Â  Martinez v. Orr, 738 F.2d 1107, 1110 (10th Cir.1984).Â  However, where a plaintiff\r\n  fails to receive notice of the right to sue through his or her own fault,\r\n  equitable tolling does not apply.Â  See Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v.\r\n    Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 151, 104 S.Ct. 1723, 80 L.Ed.2d 196 (1984) (â€œOne who\r\n  fails to act diligently cannot invoke equitable principles to excuse that lack\r\n  of diligence.â€). \r\n\t\r\n\r\nOcana v. American\r\n  Furniture Co., 91 P.3d 58,\r\n  66&nbsp;(N.M. 2004).\r\nThe\r\n  North Dakota Supreme Court determined a plaintiffâ€™s failure to timely serve the\r\n  defendants did not warrant equitable tolling:\r\n\r\n\tEven if\r\n  we were to adopt the equitable tolling doctrine in this case, Riemers' failure\r\n  to commence his action against the defendants within the statute of limitations\r\n  was not the result of his timely pursuit of one of several other available\r\n  legal remedies which may have tolled the statute of limitations.Â  Rather, as in\r\n\tReid, 2000 ND 108, Â¶ 16, 611 N.W.2d 187, Riemers' failure to commence\r\n  his action within the statute of limitations resulted from his failure to\r\n  effectuate timely service of process on the defendants.Â  We therefore conclude\r\n  the equitable tolling doctrine would not apply to Riemers' claims.\r\n\r\nRiemers v. Omdahl, 687 N.W.2d 445, 454&nbsp;(N.D. 2004).\r\nHooperâ€™s\r\n  equitable tolling argument relies on an unpublished order of the United States\r\n  District Court in Snyder v. Roberts, No. 0:04-22910-CMC-BM, 2006 WL\r\n  22181 (D.S.C. 2006).Â  We are not bound by that courtâ€™s interpretation of South Carolina law.Â  Santee River Cypress Lumber Co. v. Query, 168 S.C. 112, 117, 167\r\n  S.E. 22, 24 (1932) (â€œWe are not bound by the construction placed upon the Statute\r\n  by any Federal Court, and the Federal Courts should adopt and follow our\r\n  construction.â€).Â  In Snyder, the plaintiff filed a pro se action\r\n  arising out of an automobile accident.Â  Under the federal procedure, which\r\n  differs from South Carolina procedure, the court issues the summons and\r\n  complaint.Â  When a pro se complaint is filed in district court, it is\r\n  forwarded to a staff attorney who makes a recommendation to a Magistrate Judge.\r\n  Â Snyder, 2006 WL 22181 at *1.Â  The Magistrate Judge decides whether a\r\n  summons should issue or whether to recommend dismissal of some or all claims.Â  Id.Â  In Snyder, there was some delay because one plaintiff did not submit an\r\n  original signature on a document, but that defect was cured.Â  The summonses were\r\n  ultimately issued 101 days after the action was filed.Â  Plaintiffs effected\r\n  service 31 days later; service occurred 132 days after the action was filed.Â  Id. at *2.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  order authorizing issuance of the summonses advised Plaintiffs service was\r\n  required to be accomplished within 120 days of filing of the complaint. . . .Â \r\n  The order made no reference to the corresponding state court rules which govern\r\n  when actions are â€˜commencedâ€™ for statute of limitations purposes.â€Â  Id.Â  The court analyzed the situation where the state rule did not contemplate\r\n  delays by the court that arose under the federal procedure:\r\n\r\n\tThis\r\n  court is, therefore, faced with a state court rule and statute which suggest no\r\n  leeway in the requirement for service within 120 days but which do not envision\r\n  court imposed delays in issuance of the summons such as are required or\r\n  authorized in federal court.Â  The state court rule (and corresponding statute)\r\n  do not, in any case, appear to anticipate court imposed delay of service which\r\n  leaves plaintiffs with only the most minimal time (19 or fewer days in the\r\n  present case) within which to serve the complaint before expiration of the 120\r\n  day period allowed under S.C.R. Civ. P. 3(a)(2).Â  The situation is further\r\n  complicated in the case at bar because the order which was forwarded to\r\n  Plaintiffs with the summonses referred only to the federal service requirements\r\n  and, in doing so, suggested the time could be extended for â€œgood cause.â€Â  See Dkt No. 5 (advising Plaintiffs the 120 day service requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P.\r\n  4(m) could only be extended upon a showing of good cause).\r\n\r\nId. at *5 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  court explained: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t[t]hat\r\n  trial courts have the inherent authority to extend the time for service under\r\n  the state court's commencement rules where the delay in service is the result\r\n  of the court's delay in authorizing service and where such delay is so\r\n  substantial as to significantly impair the plaintiff's ability to effect timely\r\n  service.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at *5.\r\nHooper\r\n  did not ask the court to allow service by publication pursuant to section\r\n  15-9-710 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Wachovia Bank of S.C., N.A. v. Player,\r\n  341 S.C. 424, 428-429, 535 S.E.2d 128,130 (2000) (â€œAn order for service by\r\n  publication may be issued pursuant to [the code] when an affidavit,\r\n  satisfactory to the issuing officer, is made stating that the defendant, a\r\n  resident of the state, cannot, after the exercise of due diligence, be found,\r\n  and that a cause of action exists against him.â€); Montgomery v. Mullins,\r\n  325 S.C. 500, 505, 480 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œService of process by\r\n  publication is authorized . . . where the defendant is a resident of this\r\n  state, but after a diligent search cannot be found in this state.â€).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the court did not create the delay in service.Â  Hooper failed\r\n  to diligently investigate the relationship between Ebenezer and Agape soon\r\n  after filing to see if personal service could be accomplished at the facility.Â \r\n  After determining the registered agent was not at the address provided in Columbia, Hooper did not seek leave from the court to effect service by publication.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  present litigation does not rise to the level necessary for the application of the\r\n  salutary and salubrious doctrine of equitable tolling.Â  Concomitantly, we\r\n  refuse to actualize the doctrine of equitable tolling to the relevant statute\r\n  of limitations in this case.\r\nIII.Â  Equitable Estoppel\r\nHooper\r\n  contends Ebenezer should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations\r\n  as a defense due to its failure to maintain current information for a\r\n  registered agent with the Secretary of State.Â  Her asseveration fails because\r\n  the elements of estoppel are not fulfilled.\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Judicial Court of Maine differentiated the concepts of equitable\r\n  tolling and equitable estoppel in Dasha v. Maine Medical Center,&nbsp;665\r\n  A.2d 993 (Me. 1995).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  doctrine of equitable estoppel is distinct from the doctrine of equitable\r\n  tolling.Â  In cases of equitable estoppel, the statute of limitations has expired\r\n  and the defendant asserts the running of the statute of limitations as a\r\n  defense.Â  The defendant, however, is estopped from benefitting from the statute\r\n  of limitations as a defense because the defendant has acted in such a way as to\r\n  cause the claimant to forego filing a timely cause of action.Â  See Vacuum\r\n    Sys., Inc. v. Bridge Constr. Co., 632 A.2d 442, 444 (Me.1993); Hanusek\r\n      v. Southern Me. Medical Ctr., 584 A.2d 634, 637 (Me.1990).Â  In contrast, in\r\n  cases involving the doctrine of equitable tolling, the defendant does not have\r\n  the statute of limitations as a valid defense because it has not yet run.Â  Rather,\r\n  the statute of limitations is tolled when strict application of the statute of\r\n  limitations would be inequitable.Â  Lambert v. United States, 44 F.3d 296,\r\n  298 (5th Cir.1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Id.&nbsp;at 996 n.2.\r\nThis\r\n  Court previously expounded upon equitable estoppel in Dillon County School\r\n    Dist.

Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 531 S.E.2d 287 n. 2 (2000).Â  Essential\r\n  elements of estoppel as related to the party claiming the estoppel are: (1)\r\n  lack of knowledge and of means of knowledge of truth as to facts in question;\r\n  (2) reliance upon conduct of the party estopped; and (3) prejudicial change in\r\n  position.Â  Mayes v. Paxton, 313 S.C. 109, 437 S.E.2d 66 (1993).Â  â€œEstoppel\r\n  cannot exist if the knowledge of both parties is equal and nothing is done by\r\n  one to mislead the other.â€Â  Evins v.

Bright Acres\r\n  Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 589, 553\r\n  S.E.2d 110, 114 (2001).\r\n\r\n\tUnder South Carolina law, a defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as\r\n  a defense if the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute had\r\n  been induced by the defendant's conduct.Â  Such inducement may consist of an\r\n  express representation that the claim will be settled without litigation or\r\n  conduct that suggests a lawsuit is not necessary.Â  The defendant's conduct may\r\n  also involve inducing the plaintiff either to believe that an amicable\r\n  adjustment of the claim will be made without suit or to forbear exercising the\r\n  right to sue.\r\n\r\nKleckley v. Nw. Nat. Cas. Co., 338 S.C. 131, 136-137, 526 S.E.2d 218, 220\r\n  (2000) (quotations and citations omitted).\r\nWe\r\n  previously illuminated the application of estoppel when a party portrays the\r\n  claim will be settled:  \r\n\r\n\tSimilarly,\r\n  in situations involving settlements in civil cases, one will be equitably estopped\r\n  to defend with the statute of limitations by either (a) expressly representing\r\n  that the claim will be settled without litigation, or (b) conduct which\r\n  suggests that a lawsuit is not necessary.Â  See, e.g. Black v. Lexington Sch. Dist. No. Two, 327 S.C. 55, 488 S.E.2d 327 (1997) (citing and discussing\r\n  various other cases on this issue). In Strong v. University of South\r\n    Carolina School of Medicine, 316 S.C. 189, 447 S.E.2d 850 (1994), the court\r\n  discussed the fraudulent concealment defense to the statute of limitations,\r\n  which flows from the duty to disclose inherent in the relationship between\r\n  physicians and patients.\r\n\tFinally,\r\n  the general doctrine of equitable estoppel has been applied to affect the\r\n  running of the statute of limitations in other situations besides those of\r\n  unconsummated settlement.Â  Equitable estoppel operates to deny a party â€œthe\r\n  right to plead or prove an otherwise important fact.â€Â  Parker v. Parker,\r\n  313 S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994).\r\n\r\nMaher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 380-381, 500 S.E.2d 204, 209 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998).\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a trial courtâ€™s refusal of an equitable\r\n  estoppel contention where the plaintiff had not proved the delay was due to the\r\n  defendantâ€™s conduct:\r\n\r\n\tIn Vines\r\n  [v. Self Memorial Hospital], 314 S.C. 305, 443 S.E.2d 909, which was\r\n  brought under the Tort Claims Act, the defendant claimed the statute of\r\n  limitations as a bar, and the plaintiff argued the defendant was equitably\r\n  estopped from asserting the statute.Â  The plaintiff based her equitable\r\n  estoppel argument on the fact the defendant's employees assisted her in\r\n  completing certain claim forms.Â  She argued that this assistance â€œcaused her to\r\n  believe she had done all that she needed to do.â€Â  Vines, 314 S.C. at\r\n  308, 443 S.E.2d at 911.Â  The trial court rejected this argument and granted the\r\n  defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.Â  On\r\n  appeal, this Court affirmed, finding there was no showing that the plaintiff\r\n  had delayed filing suit in reliance on the defendant hospitalâ€™s conduct.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nBlack v. Lexington School\r\n  Dist. No. 2, 327 S.C. 55, 61, 488\r\n  S.E.2d 327, 330&nbsp;(1997).\r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, Hooper was not delayed from filing her action, but she\r\n  advances Ebenezerâ€™s failure to maintain a registered agentâ€™s current address hindered\r\n  service.Â  No evidence suggests Ebenezerâ€™s omission in updating the Secretary of\r\n  State was intended to defraud or conceal facts from Hooper.Â  Ebenezer had no\r\n  knowledge Hooper would rely on the information to attempt service.Â  When\r\n  questioned by Hooperâ€™s investigator, Inkelaar freely admitted she was\r\n  authorized to accept service for Ebenezer.\r\nEbenezer\r\n  did not engage in conduct warranting estoppel to preclude the assertion of the\r\n  statute of limitations as a defense.Â  The trial court correctly rejected\r\n  Hooperâ€™s estoppel argument.\r\nIV.Â  Rule 86 to Resurrect\r\n  Former Procedure\r\nHooper posits because of Rule 86, SCRCP, the trial\r\n  court erred in failing to apply the previous version of Rule 3, SCRCP, instead\r\n  of the current rule.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 86(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure states:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThese rules shall take effect\r\n  on July 1, 1985.Â  They govern all proceedings in civil actions brought after\r\n  they take effect and also all further proceedings in actions then pending, except\r\n  to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a\r\n  particular action pending when the rules take effect would not be feasible or\r\n  would work injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThe former â€œRule\r\n  3(b), SCRCP, tolls the statute of limitations once a plaintiff files his\r\n  summons and complaint and delivers the pleadings to the sheriff of the county\r\n  where the defendant was known to last reside for service upon the defendant,\r\n  provided actual service occurs within a reasonable time thereafter.â€Â  Montgomery\r\n    v.

Jefferson found the Stateâ€™s petition\r\n  set forth sufficient facts to establish probable cause to believe Valentine met\r\n  the statutory criteria for confinement.Â  Thereafter, a probable cause hearing\r\n  was held on March 10, 2006, before the Honorable R. Markley Dennis.Â  The only\r\n  issue before the court was whether the State could demonstrate probable cause\r\n  in showing that Valentine was a sexually violent predator.Â  In order to make\r\n  such a showing, the State argued that Valentine suffered from the mental abnormality\r\n  of pedophilia.Â  In support of this argument, the State submitted evidence to\r\n  the court concerning several risk factors suggesting Valentineâ€™s propensity to\r\n  re-offend in future acts of sexual violence.Â  The risk factors included:Â  (1)Â \r\n  multiple victims, (2) the victims were between the ages of thirteen to fifteen,\r\n  (3) prior non-sexual convictions,[3] (4) Valentineâ€™s â€œfour sentencing dates which are criminal in nature,â€ (5) a\r\n  victim he was not related to, (6) his length of sexual offending was between\r\n  one and six years, (7) he victimized two or more age groups, (8) a pattern of\r\n  substantial substance abuse, and (9) one major discipline report while\r\n  incarcerated.Â   \r\nJudge\r\n  Dennis found the State produced insufficient evidence to demonstrate Valentine was\r\n  a sexually violent predator as defined by the Act.Â  In so finding, he relied on\r\n  the Stateâ€™s reduction of one lewd act charge to an ABHAN charge, the\r\n  availability of treatment during Valentineâ€™s probationary sentence, the absence\r\n  of a psychological exam, and the fairly lenient sentence Valentine received. Â This\r\n  appeal followed.Â   \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nâ€œ[O]n review, the\r\n  appellate court will not disturb the hearing courtâ€™s finding on probable cause\r\n  unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the hearing courtâ€™s\r\n  finding.â€Â  In re Care &amp; Treatment of Beaver, 372 S.C. 272, 278, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 582 (2007).Â Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State asserts\r\n  the hearing judge based his conclusion on impermissible speculation.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â   \r\nI.&nbsp; SEXUALLY VIOLENT\r\n  PREDATOR ACT\r\nSections\r\n  44-48-10 to 44-48-170 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2006), provide\r\n  for the involuntary civil commitment of sexually violent predators who are\r\n  â€œmentally abnormal and extremely dangerous.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  The Act is not intended to be punitive in nature, nor is it intended to\r\n  stigmatize the mentally ill community.Â  Id.Â  â€œ[T]he purpose of the\r\n  requirements in the SVP Act is to ensure that these involuntary commitment procedures\r\n  are only used to control a limited subclass of dangerous persons and not to\r\n  broadly subject any dangerous person to what may be indefinite terms.â€ In re\r\n    Care and Treatment of Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003).Â  \r\n \r\nThe Act\r\n  defines a â€œsexually violent predatorâ€ as a person who: â€œ(a) has been convicted\r\n  of a sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or\r\n  personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual\r\n  violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and\r\n  treatment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30 (1) (Supp. 2006).Â  When a person has\r\n  been imprisoned for one or more of the sexually violent offenses identified in\r\n  section 44-48-30, the Act requires the agency with jurisdiction over that\r\n  person to notify the Attorney General and a multidisciplinary team designed to\r\n  evaluate the particular offender prior to his release.Â  See S.C. Code Â§\r\n  44-48-40(A) (Supp. 2006).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  multidisciplinary team reviews relevant records to determine if probable cause\r\n  exists that the offender satisfies the definition of a sexually violent\r\n  predator under the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2006).Â  These records\r\n  may include, but are not limited to, the personâ€™s criminal offense record, any\r\n  relevant medical and psychological records, treatment records, victimâ€™s impact\r\n  statement, and any disciplinary or other records formulated during confinement\r\n  or supervision.Â  Id.Â  If the multidisciplinary team determines probable\r\n  cause exists that the person meets the statutory definition, the team forwards\r\n  its assessment and all relevant records to a prosecutorâ€™s review committee.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s review committee then undertakes its assessment of whether\r\n  probable cause exists to believe the individual is a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-60 (Supp. 2006).Â  In addition to the records\r\n  and reports from the multidisciplinary team, the committee must consider any\r\n  information provided by the circuit solicitor who originally prosecuted the\r\n  person.Â  Id.Â   \r\nIf the prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  review committee finds probable cause, the Attorney General files a petition\r\n  with the court in the jurisdiction where the person committed the offense.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-70 (Supp. 2006).Â  A probable cause hearing is then held\r\n  to determine whether sufficient evidence exists that would lead a reasonable\r\n  person to believe the person named in the Attorney Generalâ€™s petition is a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80 (Supp. 2006).Â  At the\r\n  hearing, the law instructs the court to:Â  (1) verify the detaineeâ€™s identity;\r\n  (2) receive evidence and hear arguments from the detainee and the Attorney\r\n  General; and (3) determine whether probable cause exists to believe the\r\n  detainee is a sexually violent predator.Â  Id.Â  The detainee is\r\n  guaranteed: (1) to be represented by counsel; (2) to present evidence on his\r\n  own behalf; (3) to cross-examine witnesses who testify against him; and (4) to\r\n  view and copy all petitions and reports in the court file.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-48-80(B) (Supp. 2006).Â   \r\nIt is important to\r\n  emphasize that a finding of probable cause at the probable cause hearing does\r\n  not finally decide the question of whether the detainee is a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  Beaver, 372 S.C. at 275, 642 S.E.2d at 580 n.2 (citing S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-80 through 90 (Supp. 2006)).Â  On finding probable cause, the\r\n  detainee is transferred to an appropriate secure facility for an evaluation as\r\n  to whether he, in fact, suffers from a mental abnormality or personality\r\n  disorder that meets the statutory criteria for commitment under the Act.Â  Id.Â  After the evaluation, a trial is held to determine whether the person is a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  Id.Â  This trial is before a judge, unless\r\n  the detainee or Attorney General requests a jury trial.Â  Id.Â  The State\r\n  must prove the person is a sexually violent predator beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  Harvey, 355 S.C. at 60, 584 S.E.2d at 896; see also S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100 (Supp. 2006).\r\nII.&nbsp; PROBABLE CAUSE\r\n  STANDARD\r\nÂ â€œProbable\r\n  cause is a flexible, common-sense standard.Â  The very term itself does not\r\n  import absolute certainty.Â  Probable cause may be found somewhere between\r\n  suspicion and sufficient evidence to convict.â€Â  Care and Treatment of Brown\r\n    v. State, 372, S.C. 611, 619-20, 643 S.E.2d 118, 122 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nSufficient\r\n  probable cause exists to find that a sex offender meets the definition of a\r\n  sexually violent predator, as defined by the Act, if the offender has been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offense, i.e., lewd act upon a minor.Â  Beaver,\r\n  372 S.C. at 277, 642 S.E.2d at 581.Â  For the purposes of the Act, â€œ[c]onvicted\r\n  of a sexually violent offenseâ€ means a person has:  \r\n\r\n\t(a) pled guilty to, pled nolo contendere to, or been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offense;\r\n\t(b) been adjudicated delinquent as a result of the\r\n  commission of a sexually violent offense;\r\n\t(c) been charged but determined to be incompetent to\r\n  stand trial Â  for a sexually violent offense;\r\n\t(d) been found not guilty by reason of insanity of a\r\n  sexually violent offense; or\r\n\t(e)\r\n  been found guilty but mentally ill of a sexually violent offense.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â   \r\nProbable\r\n  cause to believe someone to be a sexually violent predator requires that the\r\n  evidence presented would lead a reasonable person to believe and\r\n  conscientiously entertain suspicion that the person meets the definition of a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  Brown, 372, S.C. at 620, 643 S.E.2d at 122. Â Probable\r\n  cause to believe someone to be a sexually violent predator does not demand a\r\n  showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.Â  Id. at 620, 643 S.E.2d at 123.\r\nIII.&nbsp; THE CIRCUIT\r\n  COURTâ€™S ANALYSIS\r\nAs noted earlier, a\r\n  two-pronged test exists under the Act to guide the court in making that\r\n  determination.Â  A person is a sexually violent predator if Â he (1) â€œhas been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offenseâ€; and (2) â€œsuffers from a mental\r\n  abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.â€Â  S.C. Code Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2006).Â  Pursuant\r\n  to the Act, committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of sixteen is a\r\n  sexually violent offense.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 44-48-30(2)(k) (Supp. 2006).Â   \r\nHere, the first\r\n  prong of the statutory requirement defining a â€œsexually violent predatorâ€ was\r\n  satisfied when Valentine pled guilty to â€œlewd act upon a minor under the age of\r\n  sixteen,â€ an offense enumerated under section 48-44-30 as a â€œsexually violent\r\n  offense.â€Â  Therefore, the hearing judgeâ€™s determination regarding\r\n  probable cause hinged upon the second prong:Â  whether Valentine suffers from a\r\n  mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.Â  As referenced above, our supreme court recently\r\n  addressed this second prong in Beaver, a case we find to be\r\n  substantially similar to the one at hand. [4]Â   \r\nIn Beaver,\r\n  the supreme court held the circuit court judge erred as a matter of law when he\r\n  found Beaver was not a sexually violent predator based on the following\r\n  factors:Â  the non-violent nature of Beaverâ€™s fondling convictions, the fact\r\n  that a longer sentence could have been imposed upon Beaver, and the Stateâ€™s\r\n  lack of mental health evidence at the probable cause hearing.Â  Beaver, 372\r\n  S.C. at 276-78 n.3, 642 S.E.2d at 580-82.Â  In regard to the hearing judgeâ€™s\r\n  characterization of fondling as a non-violent crime, the Beaver court\r\n  stated that although the charge of committing a lewd act upon a minor is\r\n  considered non-violent for criminal purposes, â€œthe Legislature has deemed it\r\n  appropriate to consider that charge violent for the purposes of the SVP Act.â€Â  Id. at 277, 642 S.E.2d at 581.Â  In addition, the Beaver court found the\r\n  hearing judge committed legal error when he commented on the duration of Beaverâ€™s\r\n  sentence.Â  Id. at 276 n.3, 642 S.E.2d at 581.Â  Furthermore, the supreme\r\n  court acknowledged the State should not be penalized for its failure to produce\r\n  any mental health information at the probable cause hearing because probable\r\n  cause must be found by the hearing judge before such evidence can be obtained.Â  Id. at 278, 642 S.E.2d at 582.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAs in Beaver,\r\n  we find the hearing judge in this case erred by relying on a myriad of factors\r\n  wholly outside the scope of the sexually violent predator determination as\r\n  outlined by the Act.Â  First, the hearing judge relied on the Stateâ€™s offer of a\r\n  plea agreement to Valentine, reducing one charge of lewd act on a minor to\r\n  ABHAN.Â  The hearing judge remarked, â€œ. . . if the State entertained and\r\n  accepted a plea to ABHAN, that tells me something about the strength of that\r\n  case and [its] belief in the allegations of the victim.Â  So you can offer it,\r\n  but it doesnâ€™t really help from my viewpoint.â€[5]Â \r\n  The State may offer or accept a plea agreement from a person charged with a\r\n  crime for a variety of reasons ranging from a lack of evidence, to the\r\n  realization that testifying at trial will be a traumatic experience for the\r\n  victim.Â  We find no inherent connection between the reasons the State had for entering\r\n  into a plea agreement and the evaluation of whether Valentine suffers from a\r\n  mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.Â   \r\nSecond, the hearing\r\n  judge relied on the five years of probation Valentine faced following his\r\n  release from jail as a factor in denying the Stateâ€™s motion, stating â€œI would\r\n  agree with you that he needs [treatment], if he didnâ€™t have probation.â€Â  It is\r\n  clear the hearing judge thought probation provided adequate safeguards against\r\n  Valentineâ€™s propensity to re-offend on the basis of his mental abnormality of pedophilia.Â \r\n  By creating the Act, our legislature has made it clear that the safeguards\r\n  probation offers to protect society are inadequate for sexually violent\r\n  predators.Â  Therefore, if indeed the hearing judge found that Valentine needed\r\n  treatment, he should have issued an order finding probable cause that Valentine\r\n  was a sexually violent predator.Â  See Brown, 372 S.C. at 622, 643\r\n  S.E.2d at 124 (stating the hearing judge erred by finding no probable cause\r\n  even after acknowledging Brown needed treatment based on his prior convictions\r\n  for voyeurism).Â  Rather than focusing on the safeguards offered by probation, the\r\n  courtâ€™s analysis should have been directed to whether Valentine suffers from a\r\n  mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes him likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  hearing judge relied on the absence of a psychological exam as evidence\r\n  demonstrating the State did not meet its burden of proof.Â  The State correctly\r\n  pointed out that it was unable to present a psychological examination until it\r\n  demonstrated probable cause that Valentine was a sexually violent predator.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, the judge opined that the State should amend the statute.Â  The\r\n  ability or inability of the State to have the Act amended is in no way relevant\r\n  to the inquiry of whether the State has demonstrated that Valentine is a\r\n  sexually violent predator.  \r\nFinally,\r\n  the hearing judge considered Valentineâ€™s original sentence as a factor in\r\n  determining whether he was a sexually violent predator, stating â€œ[T]he\r\n  presiding judge heard this, too . . . and he said this guyâ€™s not that big a\r\n  risk; the risk factors arenâ€™t that severe.â€Â  Further, he remarked, â€œ[A] judge\r\n  who has the ability to put him in jail for fifteen years, he puts him in jail\r\n  for five . . . which is significant to me.â€Â  While the sentencing judge\r\n  undoubtedly considered a number of factors in imposing the sentence upon\r\n  Valentine, we must assume the sentencing judge was concerned only with\r\n  criminally punishing Valentine for his past crimes.Â  However, the civil nature\r\n  of confinement under the Act presents quite a different analysis.Â  Under the Act,\r\n  the hearing judge is asked to evaluate whether probable cause exists to label\r\n  the prisoner a sexually violent predator.Â  The fundamental disconnect between\r\n  the criminal nature of punishment, with which the sentencing judge was entirely\r\n  concerned, and the civil nature of confinement, upon which a sexually violent\r\n  predator determination is based, renders the duration of punishment irrelevant.\r\nThe hearing judge\r\n  was limited to an analysis based on probable cause under the Act.Â  Instead of\r\n  engaging in such an analysis, the hearing judge reached his decision on the\r\n  basis of the plea agreement, availability of probation, absence of a\r\n  psychological exam, and the sentence imposed.Â  Pursuant to Beaver and\r\n  the language of the Act itself, these factors were not relevant in determining\r\n  whether Valentine suffered from a mental abnormality that made him likely to\r\n  engage in an act of sexual violence.Â   \r\nMoreover, three\r\n  separate probable cause determinations preceded Valentineâ€™s probable cause\r\n  hearing.Â  The initial inquiry was made by the statutorily required\r\n  multidisciplinary team, composed of â€œ(1) a representative from the Department\r\n  of Corrections; (2) a representative from the Department of Probation, Parole\r\n  and Pardon Services; (3) a representative from the Department of Mental Health\r\n  who is a trained, qualified mental health clinician with expertise in treating\r\n  sexually violent offenders; (4) a retired judge appointed by the Chief Justice\r\n  who is eligible for continued judicial service pursuant to Section 2-19-100;\r\n  and (5) an attorney with substantial experience in the practice of criminal\r\n  defense law to be appointed by the Chief Justice to serve a term of one year.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2006).Â  The prosecutorâ€™s committee reviewed\r\n  the multidisciplinary teamâ€™s report and made the second probable cause\r\n  finding.Â  That committee must include, but is not limited to, a member of the\r\n  staff of the Attorney General, an elected circuit solicitor, and a victimâ€™s\r\n  representative.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-60 (Supp. 2006).Â  Finally, the\r\n  preliminary probable cause determination by the circuit judge in Charleston County found the Attorney Generalâ€™s petition set forth sufficient facts to\r\n  establish probable cause to believe Valentine meets the statutory criteria for\r\n  civil commitment.Â   \r\nConsidering the\r\n  scope of the Act and the standard for determining probable cause, we are\r\n  convinced the record does not reasonably support the hearing judgeâ€™s finding\r\n  that the State failed to meet its burden of demonstrating probable cause in\r\n  this case.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order and hold that the State\r\n  demonstrated probable cause under the Act.  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and ANDERSON, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In addition to the accusations made by the friend and\r\n  the step-daughter, Valentineâ€™s daughter also accused him of fondling her;\r\n  however, Valentine denied the charges, and the State did not pursue them.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] S.C. Code Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to 44-48-70 (Supp. 2006).\r\n[3] Although Valentine has no prior convictions for\r\n  sexual offenses, he has a prior record for public drunkenness and possession of\r\n  marijuana.Â   \r\n[4] We note this decision was not rendered prior to the\r\n  circuit judgeâ€™s ruling in the instant case.\r\n[5] Although the hearing judgeâ€™s written order stated\r\n  Valentineâ€™s probation restrictions would adequately protect the public, and\r\n  that the State failed to present sufficient evidence Valentine suffered from\r\n  any mental abnormality or personal disorder, his comments from the bench\r\n  indicating he considered additional criteria in his determination were improper\r\n  under Beaver. We acknowledge that when there is a conflict between a\r\n  judgeâ€™s oral ruling and the subsequent written order, the latter controls.Â  Parag\r\n    v. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, 226, 508 S.E.2d 590, 592 (Ct. App. 1998).Â \r\n  Here, however, as was apparently the case in Beaver, the hearing judgeâ€™s\r\n  comments from the bench were consistent with his written order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4352","title":"SCDC v.

Â This appeal followed.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 1-23-610 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) sets forth the standard of review when the court of\r\n  appeals is sitting in review of a decision by the ALC on an appeal from an\r\n  administrative agency.Â  â€œThe review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order\r\n  must be confined to the record.â€Â  Id. Â The court of appeals may reverse\r\n  or modify the decision only if substantive rights of the appellant [have] been\r\n  prejudiced because the decision is clearly erroneous in light of the reliable\r\n  and substantial evidence on the whole record, arbitrary or otherwise\r\n  characterized by an abuse of discretion, or affected by other error of law.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Department first argues that the ALC should have dismissed Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in accordance with Al-Shabazz\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000); Sullivan v. SCDC, 355\r\n  S.C. 437, 586 S.E.2d 124 (2003); Slezak v. SCDC, 361 S.C. 327, 605\r\n  S.E.2d 506 (2004); and Skipper v. SCDC, 370 S.C. 267, 633 S.E.2d 910 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006). Â We disagree.\r\nOur supreme court recently offered clarification of Al-Shabazz and its progeny as to the ALCâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction in Furtick v.\r\n  South Carolina Department of Corrections, 374 S.C. 334, 649 S.E.2d 35\r\n  (2007). Â In Furtick, the court reiterated Al-Shabazzâ€™s holding\r\n  that â€œthe ALC has subject matter jurisdiction over an inmateâ€™s appeal when the\r\n  claim sufficiently â€˜implicates a state-created liberty interest.â€™â€Â  Furtick,\r\n  374 S.C. at 339, 649 S.E.2d at 38. Â The court further quoted its clarification\r\n  of jurisdiction in Slezak, stating â€œthe ALC has jurisdiction over all inmate grievance appeals that have been properly filed; the ALC however, is\r\n  not required to hold a hearing in every matter.â€Â  Id. at 340, 649 S.E.2d\r\n  at 38 (emphasis in original).Â   \r\nWe reject the Departmentâ€™s contention that the ALC should have\r\n  dismissed the appeal because it believes Mitchellâ€™s shoe request does not fall\r\n  within a protected right.Â  Furtick holds that when an inmateâ€™s grievance\r\n  to an ALC does not implicate a state-created liberty or property interest, the\r\n  ALC may summarily dismiss the appeal at its discretion.Â  (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Thus, the ALC clearly had subject matter jurisdiction to hear\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s appeal.Â  Although the ALC could have addressed whether Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  claim implicated a liberty or property interest, and thus could have summarily\r\n  dismissed the case if it determined Mitchellâ€™s claim did not, the ALC chose not\r\n  to, and heard the appeal.Â  Under Furtick, this was in the ALCâ€™s\r\n  discretion.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nThe Department next maintains the ALC improperly reversed the partiesâ€™\r\n  burden of proof on appeal.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of\r\n  review an ALC must apply when reviewing an agencyâ€™s decision:\r\n\r\n\tThe court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the\r\n  agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may\r\n  affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.\r\n  The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the\r\n  appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences,\r\n  conclusions, or decisions are: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) in violation of constitutional or\r\n  statutory provisions; \r\n\t\t(b) in excess of the statutory authority\r\n  of the agency; \r\n\t\t(c) Â  made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t\t(d)  affected by other error of law; \r\n\t\t(e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the Â Â  whole record;\r\n  or \r\n\t\t(f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted Â Â  exercise\r\n  of discretion. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380 (A)(6) (2005).\r\nIn its order, the ALC explains its rationale in reversing the\r\n  Department by concluding â€œthis court cannot find that the Departmentâ€™s decision\r\n  to deny the Appellantâ€™s grievance was the result of a good-faith exercise of\r\n  the Departmentâ€™s administrative responsibilities and not arbitrary or\r\n  capricious in nature.â€ Â Under the statute stated above, there is no good faith component\r\n  that is required for decisions of the Department.  \r\nMoreover, when appealing an agencyâ€™s decision, the burden rests\r\n  squarely on the appellant to prove that substantive rights were prejudiced based\r\n  on one of six statutory criteria listed above.Â  â€œThe party challenging a\r\n  governmental bodyâ€™s decision bears the burden of proving the decision is\r\n  arbitrary.â€ Â Pressley v. Lancaster County, 343 S.C. 696, 704, 542 S.E.2d\r\n  366, 370&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThe burden is on appellants to prove convincingly\r\n  that the agencyâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence.â€ Â Waters v. S.C. Land Res. Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 226, 467 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1996).\r\nThe ALC order is devoid of any finding of evidence adduced by\r\n  Mitchell warranting the ALCâ€™s reversal of the Department.Â  Undeniably,\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s request for medically\r\n  recommended support shoes implicates no state-created liberty interest.Â  Therefore, the ALCâ€™s decision\r\n  must be based on the evidence in the record.Â  We can find no evidence\r\n  indicating the Departmentâ€™s decision was either clearly erroneous, or\r\n  arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Mitchell appears to have received what the neurologist initially\r\n  recommended, i.e., â€œbetter shoes for walking.â€Â  Instead, the ALCâ€™s order\r\n  appears to be based on the Departmentâ€™s failure to file a substantive brief.Â \r\n \r\nFinally, the Department contends the ALC erred in not reopening the\r\n  case pursuant to the Administrative Law Judge Divisionâ€™s Rules\r\n  of Procedure, and that the ALC exceeded its authority by reversing the decision of\r\n  the Department.Â  Because we find the determination of the issue above\r\n  to be dispositive in the appeal before us, we need not review Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  remaining contentions.Â  See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n    (ruling an appellate court need not\r\n  review remaining issues when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\n  appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  ALC erred in improperly reversing the burden of proof and the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  decision on appeal.Â  The ALCâ€™s order is therefore\r\nREVERSED.[2]  \r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., and THOMAS, J., concur.  \r\n\r\n[1] We note the Department did not appeal the ALCâ€™s\r\n  denial of its motion to reopen the appeal.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4353","title":"Turner v.

Aiken County of Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102,\r\n  107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct.Â  App. 2005).Â  Section 1-23-380(a)(5) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) establishes the substantial evidence rule as the\r\n  standard of review.Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse or\r\n  modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or\r\n  modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  The court\r\n  reviewing the agencyâ€™s decision should not substitute its own findings of fact\r\n  for those of the agency nor should the court substitute its judgment for that\r\n  of the agency as to the weight of the evidence.Â  Tobey v. L &amp; P Constr.\r\n    Co., 296 S.C. 122, 125, 370 S.E. 2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 1988).Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nTurner\r\n  first asserts the circuit court erred in finding the Appellate Panel set forth\r\n  adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision in\r\n  this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s findings must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to\r\n  determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence.Â  Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 66, 456 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1995).Â  In this case, the\r\n  Appellate Panel amended its original decision and order to include more\r\n  specific findings of fact.Â  In its amended order, the Appellate Panel makes\r\n  reference to specific medical reports establishing the course of treatment for\r\n  Turner, the various diagnoses made as part of her care and treatment, the dates\r\n  on which various providers found her to have reached maximum medical\r\n  improvement, and their opinions regarding the degree of permanent physical\r\n  impairment sustained by Turner as a result of the injury.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  Appellate Panel makes specific reference to those portions of the testimony\r\n  presented to the single commissioner which support the findings and conclusions\r\n  regarding the reasons she left her work and the extent of permanent\r\n  disability.Â  Therefore, we find the circuit court did not err in concluding\r\n  that the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings were sufficiently detailed.Â   \r\nII.\r\nTurner\r\n  also asserts the circuit court erred in concluding that the decision of the\r\n  Appellate Panel is supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nTurner\r\n  was evaluated by Dr. W. David Redmond who found she sustained a lumbar strain\r\n  and aggravation of a pre-existing degenerative arthritic condition and sustained\r\n  seven percent impairment to her lower back.Â  Dr. Donald Johnson stated Turner\r\n  suffered from degenerative lumbar disc disease and from a cervical strain.Â  He\r\n  also stated that Turner had reached medical maximum improvement and suffered\r\n  ten percent impairment to her back and five percent impairment to her neck.Â \r\n  Moreover, Dr. Guy Heyl, to whom Turner was referred by her attorney, opined\r\n  that her neck and upper extremity problems were not related to her fall down\r\n  the stairs, and that she had sustained a fourteen percent impairment to her\r\n  back.Â  Finally, Turner was seen by Dr. Jeffrey Rueben in November of 2001, who\r\n  stated he did not recommend any additional treatment.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  record, therefore, is replete with evidence sufficient to satisfy the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s findings.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the\r\n  record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion\r\n  that the [Appellate Panel] reached.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of America, Inc.,\r\n  344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThe possibility of\r\n  drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\n  administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C.\r\n  430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984)).Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court\r\n  did not err.Â Â Â   \r\nIII.\r\nTurner next asserts\r\n  she is entitled to an award of ongoing and future medical treatment pursuant to Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc. et al., 334 S.C. 574, 514 S.E.2d\r\n  593 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  DHEC concedes this issue in its brief; therefore Turner\r\n  is entitled to that award.Â   \r\nIV.\r\nTurner\r\n  also contends Southern Neurological Institute should have been designated as\r\n  the authorized treating medical provider, and DHEC should be required to pay\r\n  all medical expenses associated therewith.Â   \r\nTurner\r\n  argues she is entitled to have her doctors declared the authorized physicians,\r\n  and that defendants are required to pay for such medical costs.Â  This\r\n  proposition is inconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (Supp. 2007) and Â§ 42-9-10\r\n  (1985), which establish the rights of the employer and the employee with regard\r\n  to payment for treatments, and ultimately gives great deference to the\r\n  Appellate Panel.Â  This statute does not give a unilateral right to claimants to\r\n  select their treating physician, and such an unencumbered right undermines the\r\n  authority of the commission, as prescribed by the legislature.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find there is substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision\r\n  not to declare Turnerâ€™s doctors the authorized physicians in this case.Â  \r\n \r\nV.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Turner contends she is entitled to reimbursement for travel expenses. Turner\r\n  relies on Section 67-1601 of the South Carolina Code of Regulations (1976),\r\n  which is titled â€œExpenses Incurred in Receiving Medical Treatment,\r\n  Reimbursement.â€Â  It states the following:\r\n\r\n\tA.&nbsp; The expenses incurred for travel\r\n  to receive medical attention which shall be reimbursed to the claimant are:\r\n\t(1)&nbsp; Mileage to and from a place of medical attention which\r\n  is more than five miles away from home in accordance with the amount allowed\r\n  state employees for mileage; and\r\n\t(2)&nbsp; Actual cost of expenses incurred in using public\r\n  transportation; and\r\n\t(3)&nbsp; Actual cost of reasonable overnight lodging and\r\n  subsistence.\r\n\tB.&nbsp; The claimant shall receive\r\n  reimbursement from the employerâ€™s representative.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nTurner appears to be entitled\r\n  to reimbursement from DHECâ€™s representative under this statute.Â  Moreover, DHEC\r\n  does not address this issue in its brief.Â  See First Union Natâ€™l Bank\r\n    v. FCVS Communications, 321 S.C. 496, 502, 469 S.E.2d 613, 617 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) (if respondent fails to respond to an issue in his brief, the appellate\r\n  court may treat the failure to respond as a confession that the appellantâ€™s\r\n  position is correct), reversed on other grounds, 328 S.C. 290, 494\r\n  S.E.2d 429 (1997).Â  However, since it is not clear from the record the amount\r\n  of money Turner is seeking for travel reimbursement, we remand this case to the\r\n  circuit court for the purpose of entering an appropriate order remanding the\r\n  case to the Appellate Panel for a hearing solely on the issue of travel\r\n  reimbursement.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing reasons, we conclude there is substantial evidence to affirm\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s findings; however, we modify the order to the extent Turner\r\n  is entitled to ongoing and future medical treatments, and remand the issue of\r\n  travel reimbursement.Â  The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and THOMAS, J., concur.

Buyck, of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  After being injured in a brawl outside of a bar, James\r\n  Mellen brought a civil action for assault and battery against David Patrick Lane.Â  The Master-in-Equity found Lane liable for Mellenâ€™s injuries, awarding Mellen\r\n  $200,000 in actual damages, but declining to award punitive damages.Â  Lane\r\n  contends the Master erred in determining his actions were the proximate cause\r\n  of Mellenâ€™s injuries.Â  Mellen maintains the Master erred by denying punitive\r\n  damages.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nIn the early\r\n  morning hours of September 23, 2001, Mellen sustained a fractured skull when he\r\n  was struck in the head with a bottle during a melee outside Big Johnâ€™s, a bar\r\n  located in Charleston, South Carolina.Â  At the time of the incident, Mellen was\r\n  twenty-one years old, and attending the College of Charleston.\r\nAfter leaving work\r\n  around 10 p.m., on September 22, 2001, Mellen and his friend Josh Tarokh joined\r\n  a group of friends who were already at a bar.Â  The group consisted of Stephanie\r\n  Vrla, Mellenâ€™s girlfriend; Vrlaâ€™s roommates, Melissa and Jennifer; Jenniferâ€™s\r\n  boyfriend; and James Trabert.Â  Mellen and his friends relocated to Big Johnâ€™s\r\n  between 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.Â  Upon arriving at Big Johnâ€™s, Mellen observed\r\n  a group of men, including Lane:\r\n\r\n\tI\r\n  noticed that there was a group of gentlemen at the bar, kind of loud,\r\n  obnoxious, kind of drunk guys you donâ€™t want to get in their way.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\t[Y]ou\r\n  know, they were kind of - - they were definitely having a good time.Â  One of\r\n  the gentlemen was passing shots around, it seems like to whatever girls would\r\n  walk by him.\r\n\r\nMellen stated he\r\n  did not interact with the men inside Big Johnâ€™s, other than â€œ[a]t one point,\r\n  [he] took the shot off the table and [he] placed it back on the bar.â€Â  At\r\n  approximately 1:30 a.m., Big Johnâ€™s issued their â€œlast callâ€ for drinks and\r\n  Mellen and his friend began to leave.Â  Mellen described the altercation and the\r\n  events leading up to it:\r\n\r\n\tWe all\r\n  kind of gathered up inside the bar after they called last call.Â  And we walked\r\n  out the front door onto East Bay Street.Â  And after that we walked around the\r\n  corner to Pinckney Street and started walking down Pinckney Street.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\t[Lane]\r\n  was standing in the doorway, and I was walking with Stephanie by my side.Â  Her\r\n  friend Melissa and Jennifer, they were in front of us.Â  Mr. Lane was standing\r\n  in the doorway.Â  And I noticed him, he was kind of hassling Melissa and\r\n  Jennifer, kind of, you know, hey, come back in, that kind of thing.Â  And so it\r\n  kind of put me on guard right off the bat.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tWell, we\r\n  came up, and they kept on walking, Melissa and Jennifer.Â  And when we got up\r\n  there, Mr. Lane reached across my body and started grabbing my girlfriend.Â  I\r\n  caught his arm, and I asked him, you know, pretty politely, I said:Â  â€œLeave it\r\n  alone.Â  Weâ€™re leaving.â€Â  And at that point he started saying numerous\r\n  expletives to me.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tI turned\r\n  back to him, you know, said some certain things to him, and then turned to walk\r\n  away.Â  And I remember being pushed very hard in the back.Â  And thatâ€™s all I\r\n  remember after that.Â  And I woke up and I was in the hospital.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n  Tarokh was aware of the group of men in Big Johnâ€™s:Â  â€œThey were just [a] loud,\r\n  obnoxious, drunk crowd.â€Â  Tarokh, who was walking with Mellen, saw Lane shove\r\n  Mellen, and asserted Lane â€œ[kept] pursuing [Mellen],â€ prompting Tarokh to\r\n  â€œ[swing] at Mr. Lane.â€Â  Tarokh recalled the incident:\r\n\r\n\tI just -\r\n  - immediately after I swung at Mr. Lane, all of his friends at the door, you\r\n  know, they immediately started coming after me.Â  So I just, you know, them swinging\r\n  at me, you know, and I just kind of cover my head, ran about 10 yards away.Â \r\n  And by the time I turned around, thatâ€™s when Mr. Mellon [sic] was struck, and\r\n  everybody just scattered.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tAmh, you\r\n  know, I had two guys like trying to punch me, and come at me.Â  I saw [Mellen]\r\n  and Mr. Lane in front of each other, you know.Â  But after that, you know - -\r\n  and then after everyone ran, I just saw [Mellen] laying on the ground.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tI ran\r\n  towards [Mellen], and then saw that his head was busted open, blood\r\n  everywhere.Â  And I chased after Mr. Lane.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tI was\r\n  going to the parking lot behind Big Johnâ€™s.Â  By then Mr. Lane was, you know,\r\n  shutting the door of his car, you know.Â  And I was on the phone with the\r\n  dispatch, you know, and I was screaming at him, telling him to stop.\r\n\r\nDuring\r\n  cross-examination, Tarokh was asked if Mellen fell as a result of Laneâ€™s\r\n  initial push.Â  He responded â€œNoâ€ and confessed he did not see who actually\r\n  struck Mellen in the head, causing Mellenâ€™s brain injuries.\r\nJames Trabert was\r\n  involved in the brawl, and attested he â€œthought [he] saw [Mellen] get hit with\r\n  a bottle.â€Â  The Master-in-Equity quizzed Trabert, â€œAnd somebody wearing a\r\n  Citadel polo shirt is who slammed [Mellen] with a bottle?â€Â  Retorting\r\n  affirmatively, Trabert identified Lurie Poston as the bottle wielder.Â   \r\nDavid Lane\r\n  professed he planned to tailgate prior to and attend the Citadel football game\r\n  on September 22, 2001.Â  He began consuming alcohol at approximately 2 p.m.,\r\n  while tailgating, and continued drinking throughout the day.Â  Lane and his\r\n  comrades left the game and went to Big Johnâ€™s at about 10 p.m., staying there\r\n  until the bar closed.Â  Lane depicted his involvement in the skirmish:\r\n\r\n\tWell, I\r\n  turned, turned away, and then I was pushed from behind.Â  There were three\r\n  people in front of me, two guys and a girl, and I was shoved from behind.Â  And\r\n  then I hit into the person in front of me, and he went to go - - he went almost\r\n  down.Â  I grabbed him by the back of the shirt to pick him back up.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tThen the\r\n  individual with the shirt turned around, the individual on the left turned\r\n  around.Â  The individual on the left shoved his finger in my face, told me donâ€™t\r\n  do it.Â  Weâ€™ll beat the crap out of you, something along those lines.Â  I let out\r\n  an expletive, and I got hit.\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n  questioned about causing Mellenâ€™s injuries, Lane asseverated:Â  â€œNo.Â  I thought\r\n  I was preventing an injury.â€Â  Lane denied reaching for Vrla.  \r\nLaneâ€™s\r\n  friend Peter Swiderski accompanied Lane to the Citadel game and Big Johnâ€™s the\r\n  night Mellen was injured.Â  Swiderski, while declaring he did not see who hit\r\n  Mellen with a bottle, witnessed the altercation:\r\n\r\n\tI walked\r\n  out.Â  We were walking around the corner of Big Johnâ€™s, make a left walking\r\n  towards the back, and I see David Lane surrounded by about three men.Â  And they\r\n  were, you know punching at them.Â  Iâ€™m like, whatâ€™s going on here.Â  Iâ€™m like\r\n  this is not good.Â  I took off after them, okay.Â  Peeled the guy that was, if\r\n  you have A David Laneâ€™s back was to me, because Iâ€™m coming around the corner.Â \r\n  I took the guy that was on his right â€“ hand side, pushed him off to the side.Â \r\n  Me and him got into a scuffle there, okay?Â  And I looked back and the Plaintiff\r\n  was on the ground.\r\n\r\nAnother companion\r\n  of Laneâ€™s that night was Gregory McHone.Â  McHone remembered the row:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e\r\n  walked up to [the fight].Â  It looked like some of our buddies were in the mix,\r\n  and we just stepped in and started trying to separate people.\r\n\tAnd at\r\n  some point I remember I had my back to the parking lot.Â  And I remember the\r\n  level of crowd noises increasing, like some particular event had happened.Â  And\r\n  I turned and to my left rear I saw Mr. Mellon [sic].Â  Well, I didnâ€™t know it\r\n  was him, at the time, but I saw a gentleman laying on the ground.\r\n\r\nMcHone checked on\r\n  Mellen, but Mellen did not answer:Â  â€œI asked him if he was okay, and he didnâ€™t\r\n  respond to me.â€\r\nLurie Poston is the\r\n  individual Trabert identified as hitting Mellen with the bottle.Â  He advanced\r\n  he and his companions did purchase shots at Big Johnâ€™s but denied they were\r\n  overly rambunctious:Â  â€œWell, you know, we did buy some shots, but we werenâ€™t\r\n  rowdy.Â  You know, we were respectful.â€Â  When asked if he saw what injured\r\n  Mellen, Poston stated:Â  â€œMy impression was he fell.Â  I never saw him get hit.â€Â \r\n  Acknowledging Trabertâ€™s allegations, Poston offered:\r\n\r\n\tAnd you\r\n  know, Mr. Trabert just said he saw me bending over the guy, hit him with a\r\n  bottle.Â  Thatâ€™s - - I never did that.Â  I was not even there when that\r\n  happened.Â  I came after Mr. Mellon [sic] was already down on the ground.Â  And\r\n  it was my attempt to help him.Â  But his girl friend was so hysterical, you\r\n  know, that I said, well, maybe we better just back off and let them handle it.\r\n\r\nOriginally, Mellen\r\n  sued Lane, McHone, Swiderski and Poston.Â  Prior to trial, all defendants were\r\n  dismissed by consent except Lane.Â  The case was referred by consent to the\r\n  Master-in-Equity for trial.\r\nThe\r\n  Master-in-Equity for Charleston County heard this action and issued an order\r\n  awarding Mellen $100,000 in actual damages.Â  The Master found the testimony and\r\n  evidence offered by Mellen more credible than that offered by Lane.Â  In his\r\n  order, he named several factors contributing to his credibility determination:Â \r\n  (1)Â  â€œLane (and his witnesses) had admittedly been drinking for approximately\r\n  twelve hours prior to the brawl;â€ (2) Laneâ€™s testimony at trial was\r\n  inconsistent with statements he gave to police shortly after the incident; (3)Â \r\n  Laneâ€™s and his friendsâ€™ flight from the scene was behavior consistent with\r\n  wrongdoing (noting McHone was the only person in Laneâ€™s party to check on\r\n  Mellenâ€™s condition before leaving the scene); (4)Â  â€œ[Mellen] and his two\r\n  eyewitnesses, both by their demeanor, lesser amount of drinking and substance\r\n  of their testimony, [were] more credible witnesses;â€ and (5) Laneâ€™s testimony regarding\r\n  the push from behind was not believable.Â  The Master-in-Equityâ€™s factual\r\n  finding of proximate cause provides:\r\n\r\n\tI find\r\n  that the shove of Mellen by Lane was the proximate cause of Mellenâ€™s injury.Â \r\n  The shove by Lane was certainly the direct cause, i.e., â€œbut forâ€ the shove by\r\n  Lane there would have been no incident which erupted into a general melee in\r\n  the course of which Mellen was injured.Â  I also find it foreseeable that the\r\n  original assault could have caused Mellenâ€™s injuries.Â  The assault occurred at\r\n  closing time at a bar.Â  Defendant and his friend had been drinking on and off\r\n  for around twelve hours â€“ a long day of drinking by anyoneâ€™s standards â€“\r\n  including the ordering of â€œshotsâ€ by Defendant Lane and his friends.Â  I find\r\n  that the Defendant made a rude remark, accompanied by touching Plaintiff\r\n  Mellenâ€™s girlfriend, as they walked passed the Defendant.Â  As Plaintiff turned\r\n  to leave, the Defendant forcefully pushed him from behind into the street.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Master held a hearing on punitive damages and issued an order inculcating:\r\n\r\n\tUpon\r\n  review and weighing of the [Gamble] factors as set forth above I find\r\n  that while Defendantâ€™s conduct in initiating the action which led to\r\n  Plaintiffâ€™s injury and his apparent attempt to conceal his involvement in that\r\n  activity is reprehensible, I find that it is not of a sufficient level of proof\r\n  by the clear and convincing standard to form the basis for an award of punitive\r\n  damages under the specific facts of this case.\r\n\r\nA\r\n  final order increased Mellenâ€™s actual damage award to $200,000 and denied punitive\r\n  damages.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Master-in-Equity err in \r\n\t\t\tfailing to find the intervening act of a third party broke the chain \r\n\t\t\tof causation and insulated Lane from liability for Mellenâ€™s injuries?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Master-in-Equity err in \r\n\t\t\tawarding $200,000 in actual damages?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Master-in-Equity err in \r\n\t\t\tdenying punitive damages?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate courtâ€™s â€œscope of review for a case heard by a Master-in-Equity who\r\n  enters a final judgment is the same as that for review of a case heard by a\r\n  circuit court without a jury.Â  Tiger, Inc. v.

If, however, the death was caused not by the wound or the\r\n  injury that the deceased had, but was caused merely by the gross, erroneous\r\n  treatment, that is, where a treatment was so gross, where a treatment was so\r\n  deliberate, so willful, that it was the cause of death, then the defendant\r\n  would not be liable. . .

Â He determined Lane made rude comments to Mellen as\r\n  he exited Big Johnâ€™s and grabbed at Mellenâ€™s girlfriend.Â  Lane shoved Mellen in\r\n  the back, and the Master reasoned this act proximately caused the fracas, without\r\n  which Mellen would not have been injured.Â  But for Laneâ€™s action, there would\r\n  have been no brawl and no injury.Â  While it is not necessary for Lane to have\r\n  contemplated the exact result of Mellen being struck with a bottle, the\r\n  altercation and actions therein were the natural and probable consequences of\r\n  Laneâ€™s initiation of the fight under the attendant circumstances.Â  The intervention\r\n  of someone hitting Mellen with the bottle did not break the sequence or causal\r\n  connection between Laneâ€™s instigation of the bout and Mellenâ€™s injury.Â  Because\r\n  this intervention was reasonably foreseeable in the attendant circumstances,\r\n  Lane is not insulated from liability.Â  Thus, the evidence amply supports the\r\n  Masterâ€™s factual finding of proximate cause.\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damages Awards\r\nLane\r\n  argues the evidence in the record does not support the Masterâ€™s actual damages\r\n  award to Mellen.Â  Mellen contends the Master erred in denying him punitive\r\n  damages.Â  We are mindful of the Master-in-Equityâ€™s discretion in awarding\r\n  damages, and the â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of review for actual and punitive\r\n  damages in the present case.Â  We review the awards seriatim.\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual Damages\r\nLane\r\n  maintains the evidence does not support the actual damages award.Â  We disagree.\r\nActual damages are properly called compensatory\r\n  damages, meaning to compensate, to make the injured party whole, to put him in\r\n  the same position he was in prior to the damages received insofar as this is\r\n  monetarily possible. Â See Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000).\r\n  Â Actual damages are awarded to a litigant in compensation for his actual loss\r\n  or injury. Â Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 396, 134 S.E.2d 206, 210 (1964).\r\n  Â Actual damages are such as will compensate the party for injuries suffered or\r\n  losses sustained. Â Id. Â They are such\r\n  damages as will simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong or\r\n  injury. Â Actual damages are damages in satisfaction of, or in recompense for,\r\n  loss or injury sustained. Â Barnwell v. Barber-Colman Co., 301 S.C. 534, 537, 393 S.E.2d 162, 163 (1989).\r\n  Â The goal is to restore the injured party, as nearly as possible through the\r\n  payment of money, to the same position he was in before the wrongful injury\r\n  occurred. Â Clark, 339 S.C. at 378, 529 S.E.2d at 533.\r\nActual or compensatory damages include compensation\r\n  for all injuries which are naturally the proximate result of the alleged\r\n  wrongful conduct of the defendant. Â See Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 578, 106 S.E.2d 258, 264 (1958).\r\n  Â The basic measure of actual damages is the amount needed to compensate the\r\n  plaintiff for the losses proximately caused by the defendant's wrong so that\r\n  the plaintiff will be in the same position he would have been in if there had\r\n  been no wrongful injury. Â See Rogers, 233 S.C. at 578, 106 S.E.2d at 264; Hutchison v. Town of Summerville, 66 S.C. 442, 448, 45 S.E. 8, 10 (1903).\r\n\r\n\tIn awarding actual damages in the instant case, the\r\n  Master expounded:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tBecause\r\n  I find the evidence as to the assault and battery, the proximate cause, and the\r\n  nature and extent of damages have been proved by the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence, I find an award of actual damages is appropriate.\r\n\t\tI find\r\n  that the fractured skull, the need for EMS, the hospitalization at MUSC, loss\r\n  of a semester at college, the need for the Plaintiff to move in with his\r\n  parents to recuperate, and the various aspects of his recuperation as detailed\r\n  by his sister and parents, are all actual damages proximately caused by the\r\n  Defendantâ€™s conduct.Â  Plaintiffâ€™s permanent loss of smell and the closed head\r\n  injury as outlined by Dr. Waid, Plaintiff, and his family are also the direct\r\n  and proximate result of the assault by Defendant.\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  evidence establishes that Plaintiff sustained a painful and debilitating\r\n  fractured skull.Â  The first few days were excruciatingly painful and life\r\n  threatening. . . . Because of his fragile state, several weeks passed before he\r\n  was left alone for any significant period.Â  He required help getting around the\r\n  house and continued to subsist in extreme pain.Â  He was nauseated, weak,\r\n  confused, and in extreme pain.\r\n\t\t. . .\r\n\t\tPlaintiff\r\n  does have some permanent injuries.Â  His sense of smell is virtually\r\n  non-existent.Â  There are certain citrus smells he notices at times.Â  His lack\r\n  of smell affects his taste of food.Â  It also presents safety issues. . . . \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHe suffered\r\n  a subdural hematoma (i.e., bleeding in his brain) and had a closed head\r\n  injury.Â  The permanent effects of his injury involve loss of certain\r\n  â€œmultitasking skillsâ€ as testified by the Plaintiff and his family and\r\n  supported by the medical evidence of Neuropsychologist Randolph Waid.\r\n\t\t. . . \r\n\t\tClosely\r\n  associated with the deficiencies in the ability to â€œmultitaskâ€ are the\r\n  secondary factors of increased anxiety, fatigue and frustration.Â  Plaintiff now\r\n  tends to withdraw from the frivolity of crowds and friendly (and even family)\r\n  social interaction.Â  Because he becomes mentally fatigued more easily, he is\r\n  more likely to lose his temper with co-workers or friends.Â  He becomes easily\r\n  flustered and anxious in social situations.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Master initially awarded $100,000 in actual damages:Â  $8,000 for past medical\r\n  expenses, $40,000 for past physical pain and suffering, $12,000 for past\r\n  emotional distress, $15,000 for past loss of enjoyment of life, and a\r\n  cumulative $25,000 for actual future damages.Â  Later, the Master amended his actual\r\n  future damages award, averring:\r\n\r\n\tHaving\r\n  considered the merits of the Plaintiffâ€™s argument [to increase actual future damages]\r\n  and the life expectancy tables as well as the sufficiency of evidence tending\r\n  to establish that the Plaintiff will suffer future damages as a result of the\r\n  injuries sustained as a result of the Defendantâ€™s conduct, I hereby alter and\r\n  amend my prior award of actual future damages as follows:\r\n\tFor\r\n  future physical pain and suffering, I find actual damages in the amount of\r\n  $25,000.\r\n\tFor\r\n  future emotional distress, I find actual damages in the amount of $50,000.\r\n\tFor\r\n  future loss of enjoyment of life, I find actual damages in the amount of\r\n  $50,000.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  total actual damages awarded to Mellen amount to $200,000.Â  The record contains\r\n  sufficient evidence to support the Masterâ€™s award for actual damages.Â  Mellen\r\n  was a virile young man in his early 20s when he was injured.Â  There was a\r\n  plethora of evidence regarding the cause and effect of Mellenâ€™s skull fracture\r\n  to justify the Masterâ€™s determination of actual damages, and there was no error\r\n  of law or abuse of discretion.\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\nMellen\r\n  contends the Master erred by denying punitive damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nPunitive damages, alternatively known as exemplary\r\n  damages, are imposed as punishment. Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378-379, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000).Â \r\n  Punitive damages are allowed in the interest of society in the nature of\r\n  punishment and as a warning and example to deter the wrongdoer and others from\r\n  committing like offenses in the future. Â Id. Â Moreover, they serve to vindicate a private\r\n  right by requiring the wrongdoer to pay money to the injured party. Â Id.\r\nAt\r\n  least three important purposes are served by a punitive damages award: (1)\r\n  punishment of the defendant's reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct;\r\n  (2) deterrence of similar future conduct by the defendant or others; and (3) compensation for\r\n  the reckless or willful invasion of the plaintiff's private rights. Â Id. Â The paramount purpose for awarding punitive damages\r\n  is not to compensate the plaintiff but to punish and set an example for others.\r\nOn\r\n  the issue of punitive damages, the highest burden of proof known to the civil\r\n  law is applicable. Â Section 15-33-135 of the South Carolina Code provides:Â  â€œIn any civil action where punitive\r\n  damages are claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (Supp. 2003). Â Punitive damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff proves by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence the defendant's misconduct was willful, wanton,\r\n  or in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights. Â Taylor v.\r\n    Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 220, 479 S.E.2d 35, 46 (1996); Lister v.\r\n      NationsBank of Delaware, 329 S.C. 133, 149, 494 S.E.2d 449, 458 (Ct.App.1997).\r\nThere\r\n  is no formula or standard to be used as a measure for assessing punitive\r\n  damages. However, factors relevant to consideration of punitive damages are:Â  (1)\r\n  the character of the defendant's acts; (2)\r\n  the nature and extent of the harm to plaintiff which defendant caused or\r\n  intended to cause; (3) defendant's\r\n    degree of culpability; (4) the punishment that should be imposed; (5) duration\r\n    of the conduct; (6) defendant's awareness or concealment; (7) the existence of similar\r\n    past conduct; (8) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from\r\n    like conduct; (9) whether the award is\r\n  reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; and (10)\r\n  defendant's wealth or ability to pay.Â  See Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-112, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991); see also Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 306, 536 S.E.2d 408, 422 (Ct.App.2000) ( â€œUnder Gamble, the trial court is\r\n  not required to make findings of fact for each factor to uphold a punitive\r\n  damage award.â€).\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court illuminated the\r\n  discretionary nature of an award of punitive damages in Jordan v. Holt,\r\n  362 S.C. 201, 608 S.E.2d 129 (2005):\r\n\r\n\t[The Court of Appeals] must\r\n  affirm the trial court's finding of punitive damages if any evidence reasonably\r\n  supports the judge's factual findings. Â An award of punitive damages is left\r\n  almost entirely to the discretion of the jury and trial judge. Â Charles v. Texas Co., 199 S.C. 156, 18 S.E.2d 719 (1942). Â The\r\n  rationale for vesting discretion in the trial court was expressed in Lucht v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, 138, 221 S.E.2d 854, 860 (1976):\r\n\tThe fact [the trial judge] heard the evidence and was\r\n  more familiar than we with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial gives [the trial\r\n  judge], we think, a better informed view than we have. Â This is particularly\r\n  true when the elements of damage are intangibles and the appraisal depends\r\n  somewhat on the observation of the [witnesses] and evaluation of their\r\n  testimony.\r\n\tFinally,\r\n  we conclude the trial court also conducted a post-trial review of the punitive\r\n  damages award using the factors outlined by this Court in Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991) and\r\n  properly set forth its findings on the record. Â In Gamble, the Court explained\r\n  the trial court should consider: (1) the defendant's degree of culpability; (2)\r\n  duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness or concealment; (4) the\r\n  existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood that the award will deter the\r\n  defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably\r\n  related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) the defendant's\r\n  ability to pay; and (8) other factors deemed appropriate. Â Id. Â The trial\r\n  court found particularly reprehensible Respondents' ouster of Petitioners from\r\n  the management of the business and Respondents' constant failure to respond to\r\n  Petitioners' requests for meetings and financial information. Â The trial court\r\n  again noted Respondents' misappropriation of the LLC's assets and use of money\r\n  for their own personal benefit. The trial court's findings are supported by\r\n  evidence in the record.\r\n\r\nJordan, 362 S.C. at 207, 608 S.E.2d at 132.Â  In reinstating\r\n  the punitive damages award, the Court emphasized the application of the Gamble factors, the discretion of the fact finderâ€™s award, and the â€œany evidenceâ€\r\n  standard applicable to appellate review of punitive damages awards.\r\n\r\n\tHere, in the order denying punitive damages, the\r\n  Master opined:\r\n\tWhile the Defendantâ€™s initial\r\n  shove of the Plaintiff that set the brawl in motion was intentional, the\r\n  resulting injuries to Mellenâ€™s head were unintentional; however, I specifically\r\n  found that Defendant was the proximate cause of Plaintiffâ€™s injuries since the\r\n  injuries suffered by the Plaintiff were the natural and foreseeable\r\n  consequences of the Defendantâ€™s actions.\r\n\tPlaintiff argues that the\r\n  reckless behavior of the Defendant entitles Plaintiff to punitive damages as a\r\n  matter of right. . . .\r\n\tI do not believe that\r\n  Defendantâ€™s reckless conduct necessitates a finding of punitive damages.\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find no error of law in the Master-in-Equityâ€™s denial of punitive damages.Â  He weighed\r\n  each factor before denying a punitive damages award, as set forth in his\r\n  November 7, 2006, order.Â  While the Master declared in his factual findings,\r\n  â€œLaneâ€™s shove to Mellen in the back constituted a battery and was an\r\n  intentional and deliberate act which was willful, wanton, reckless, and\r\n  malicious under the circumstances,â€ it is completely within his discretion to\r\n  deny a punitive damages award.Â  The Master found Mellen was successful in\r\n  proving by the preponderance of evidence Laneâ€™s conduct was the proximate cause\r\n  of his injuries, but he held Mellen fell short of the clear and convincing\r\n  evidence standard required for a punitive damages award.Â  Because punitive\r\n  damages are not mandatory or obligatory and within the Masterâ€™s discretion, the\r\n  denial of a punitive damages award was proper.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  rule Laneâ€™s conduct was the proximate cause of Mellenâ€™s injuries.Â  We affirm\r\n  the Master-in-Equityâ€™s order awarding actual damages and denying punitive\r\n  damages.Â  Accordingly, the orders of the Master-in-Equity are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4355","title":"Grinnell Corporation v.

(Tyco), obtained a policy of\r\n  insurance with American Home.Â  At the time Tyco obtained the policy, Grinnell\r\n  was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco.Â  The policy provided commercial auto\r\n  coverage with liability limits in the amount of $5,000,000 and applied to\r\n  vehicles owned and operated by Grinnell. Â Along with the policy, Tyco and\r\n  American Home executed a â€œpayment agreementâ€ which required Tyco to reimburse\r\n  American Home up to $500,000 for each claim American Home paid.Â  Using a\r\n  standard form, American Home made an â€œOffer of Additional Uninsured and Underinsured\r\n  Automobile Insurance Coveragesâ€ (the Offer Form) for Tycoâ€™s South Carolina\r\n  policy.\r\nGerald\r\n  M. Goetz executed the Offer Form for Tycoâ€™s South Carolina policy.Â  At the\r\n  time, Goetz was serving as Vice President of Risk Management for Tyco.Â  He had\r\n  worked in the insurance industry as a risk manager since 1978 and earned\r\n  several degrees relating to risk management.Â  Goetz signed only the\r\n  acknowledgement section of the Offer Form.Â  He testified the Offer Form was not\r\n  completed by Tyco; it was filled out by either American Home or the insurance\r\n  broker.Â Â Â   \r\nGoetz\r\n  asserted he was fully aware of Tycoâ€™s options and the nature of UM and UIM\r\n  coverage when he executed the form.Â  According to Goetz, Tyco was â€œeffectively\r\n  self-insuredâ€ due to the $500,000 deductible, and explained that Tyco would not\r\n  have bought additional UM and UIM coverage under any circumstances because\r\n  doing so would increase its own exposure to liability.Â  Additionally, Goetz professed\r\n  Tyco desired to purchase minimum UM and UIM coverage because it carried workersâ€™\r\n  compensation coverage for employees who might be injured while driving company\r\n  vehicles.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  May 1, 2000, John Wood sustained injuries from an accident while driving a\r\n  vehicle owned by Grinnell, his employer at the time.Â  The vehicle was insured\r\n  under the policy American Home issued to Grinnell.Â   \r\nWood\r\n  brought a claim for workersâ€™ compensation benefits against Grinnell which was\r\n  paid.Â  Wood also sought recovery under UM and UIM coverage in the case of John\r\n    Wood v. Lisa Ackerman and John Doe, 2003-CP-08-615.Â  In that action, which\r\n  is currently pending, Wood served both American Home and Government Employees Insurance\r\n  Company (GEICO), the insurance provider for his personal vehicle.\r\nGrinnell\r\n  filed this separate action against Wood, GEICO, and American Home seeking a\r\n  declaratory judgment that it had successfully rejected UIM and additional UM\r\n  coverage under its policy with American Home.Â  GEICO answered, filing a\r\n  counterclaim against Grinnell and a cross-claim against American Home, asking\r\n  for a reformation of Grinnellâ€™s policy to include additional UM and UIM\r\n  coverage.Â  GEICO requested a declaration that American Home is the primary\r\n  insurance provider for UM and UIM coverage.Â  Wood answered and filed a\r\n  cross-claim against American Home, beseeching a reformation of the policy and\r\n  damages for bad faith.\r\nFollowing\r\n  discovery, Grinnell, GEICO, and Wood filed motions for summary judgment on the\r\n  issues of the offer of UM and UIM and reformation of the policy.Â  American Home\r\n  joined in Grinnellâ€™s motion at the hearing.Â  The motions were heard on the stipulated\r\n  facts above.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to Wood and GEICO. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nI.&nbsp; Summary\r\n  Judgment/Sufficiency of Offer\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard of review as the trial court\r\n  under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Pye v.

Â â€œThe insurer bears\r\n  the burden of establishing that it made a meaningful offer.â€Â  Progressive 362 S.C. at 348-49, 608 S.E.2d at 571.Â  Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475\r\n  S.E.2d at 759.\r\nIn\r\n  response to the Wannamaker decision, the legislature passed section\r\n  38-77-350, which establishes the requirements for forms used in making offers\r\n  of optional insurance coverages.Â  Progressive, 362 S.C. at 349, 608\r\n  S.E.2d at 571.Â  â€œ[W]hen enacting section 38-77-350, the Legislature did not\r\n  intend to repeal section 38-77-160.â€Â  Butler, 323 S.C. at 407, 475\r\n  S.E.2d at 761.Â  Section 38-77-350 (A) states:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  director or his designee shall approve a form that automobile insurers shall\r\n  use in offering optional coverages required to be offered pursuant to law to\r\n  applicants for automobile insurance policies. This form must be used by\r\n  insurers for all new applicants.Â  The form, at a minimum, must provide for each\r\n  optional coverage required to be offered:\r\n\t(1) a\r\n  brief and concise explanation of the coverage,\r\n\t(2) a\r\n  list of available limits and the range of premiums for the limits,\r\n\t(3) a\r\n  space for the insured to mark whether the insured chooses to accept or reject\r\n  the coverage and a space for the insured to select the limits of coverage he\r\n  desires,\r\n\t(4) a\r\n  space for the insured to sign the form which acknowledges that he has been\r\n  offered the optional coverages,\r\n\t(5) the\r\n  mailing address and telephone number of the Insurance Department which the\r\n  applicant may contact if the applicant has any questions that the insurance\r\n  agent is unable to answer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (2002).Â   \r\nIf\r\n  the insurerâ€™s form complies with these requirements, section 38-77-350(B) provides\r\n  a conclusive presumption.\r\n\r\n\tIf this\r\n  form is properly completed and executed by the named insured it is conclusively\r\n  presumed that there was an informed, knowing selection of coverage and neither\r\n  the insurance company nor any insurance agent has any liability to the named\r\n  insured or any other insured under the policy for the insuredâ€™s failure to\r\n  purchase any option coverages or higher limits.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (2002)[1].Â \r\n  â€œIf the form does not comply with the statute, the insurer may not benefit from\r\n  the protections of the statute.â€ Progressive, 362 S.C. at 349, 608\r\n  S.E.2d at 572&nbsp;(citing Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479,\r\n  486, 462 S.E.2d 291, 295 (Ct. App. 1995)).Â   \r\nGrinnell\r\n  concedes the offer form fails to meet the requirements of section 38-77-350(A),\r\n  so the conclusive presumption of section 38-77-350(B) does not apply.Â  An insurerâ€™s\r\n  failure to comply with section 38-77-350 does not necessarily presage the lack\r\n  of a meaningful offer.Â  See Butler 323 S.C. 402, 475\r\n  S.E.2d 758.Â  The insurer still has an\r\n  opportunity to prove an offer is meaningful under the requirements of Wannamaker.Â Â  See Antley,&nbsp;350 S.C. at 633, 567 S.E.2d at 878.Â  â€œWhether a\r\n  meaningful offer was made depends on the facts and circumstances of a\r\n  particular case.â€Â  Croft v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 420,\r\n  618 S.E.2d 909, 918 (2005).Â   \r\nGrinnell\r\n  and American Home assert that while the offer form fails to meet the requirements\r\n  of 38-77-350(A), the offer form still meets the requirements of Wannamaker.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIt\r\n  is axiomatic that a form which fails under the requirements of section 38-77-350(A)\r\n  would not meet the requirements of Wannamaker without evidence outside\r\n  of the offer form.Â  Section 38-77-350(A) sets forth the minimum requirements of\r\n  a form offering optional coverage.Â  Butler 323 S.C. at 408, 475 S.E.2d\r\n  at 761.Â  â€œ[A] form does not necessarily constitute a meaningful offer simply\r\n  because it was approved by the Department of Insurance.â€Â  Floyd, 367\r\n  S.C. at 262, 626 S.E.2d at 12.Â  To meet its burden of proof, an insurer must\r\n  provide evidence outside of the offer form itself to prove satisfaction of the Wannamaker test.Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAn illustration\r\n  of this principle can be seen in McDowell v. Travelers Property &amp; Casualty\r\n    Company, 357 S.C. 118, 590 S.E.2d 514 &nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  In McDowell an employee sought reformation of his employerâ€™s policy on the ground that\r\n  there was not a meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM coverage.Â  Id.Â  This court conducted a Wannamaker analysis after concluding the offer\r\n  form did not meet the requirements of section 38-77-350(A).Â  Id.Â  We\r\n  ruled the insurer had made a meaningful offer because the contract between the\r\n  parties provided the necessary information which was missing from the offer\r\n  form.Â  Id. at 124, 590 S.E.2d at 517 (â€œMcDowellâ€™s only contention under\r\n  the Wannamaker analysis is that Travelers failed to provide the premium\r\n  amounts for the optional UIM coverage. Although the offer form contained no\r\n  premium amounts in the blanks provided, the contractual agreement between\r\n  Goodyear and Travelers includes a detailed formula for calculating the premium\r\n  for UIM coverage.â€).Â  Essentially, the contract â€œcuredâ€ the offer formâ€™s\r\n  insufficiency.Â  However, without the contract, the insurer would not have\r\n  provided the necessary information.  \r\nThe\r\n  present case is distinguishable from McDowell.Â  In McDowell, the sole deficiency was the\r\n  offer formâ€™s failure to provide premium amounts.Â  Id.Â  This court\r\n  determined the offer was still meaningful under Wannamaker because\r\n  premiums could be established from the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  Id.Â  In the case sub judice, the offer form had several shortcomings;\r\n  there is no evidence American Home cured these defects by providing the\r\n  necessary information in some other way.Â   \r\nWhile\r\n  the form stated that additional coverage was available up to the policy limits, the actual offers of optional coverages printed on the form were for\r\n  amounts far less that the $5,000,000 policy limit.Â  The increased premium charges\r\n  were left blank even though the form itself states that they must be completed.Â \r\n  The form had been filled out to state that â€œSingle Limit[s]â€ of additional\r\n  coverage were selected, which is clearly inconsistent with a denial of\r\n  additional coverage.Â  Lastly, the form required signatures next to the\r\n  boxes where the insured elects not to choose optional coverage, but no one\r\n  signed those blanks.\r\nTo\r\n  illustrate the offer form was a meaningful offer, Grinnell and American Home\r\n  point to evidence of Grinnellâ€™s level of sophistication and understanding of UM\r\n  and UIM insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n\t[E]vidence\r\n  of the insureds [sic] knowledge or level of sophistication is relevant and\r\n  admissible when analyzing, under Wannamaker, whether an insurer\r\n  intelligibly advised the insured of the nature of the optional UM or UIM\r\n  coverage. It is a subjective inquiry to the extent the insured may offer\r\n  evidence of his understanding, or lack thereof, of the nature of UM or UIM\r\n  coverage. It also is an objective inquiry because the factfinder should\r\n  consider the insureds [sic] knowledge and level\r\n  of sophistication in determining whether the insurer intelligibly explained\r\n  such coverage to the insured.\r\n\r\nCroft v. Old Republic Ins.\r\n  Co., 365 S.C. 402, 420-21, 618 S.E.2d\r\n  909, 918 (2005).\r\nSome\r\n  of the omissions in the offer form cannot be reconciled regardless of how\r\n  sophisticated the insured may be.Â  For example, the actual offers of optional\r\n  coverages were for amounts far less than the $5,000,000 policy limit, and the\r\n  form had been filled out to state that â€œSingle Limit[s]â€ of additional coverage\r\n  were selected.Â  Such serious errors may not be mitigated by the insuredâ€™s stature.Â \r\n  The sophistication level of the insured, while relevant to the sufficiency of\r\n  the advice given by the insurer, does not completely relax the requirement that\r\n  an insurer make a meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM coverage. Indeed,\r\n  insurers are required to make a meaningful offer to even the most sophisticated\r\n  parties because â€œthe Legislature has\r\n  recognized that commercial insureds, like non-commercial insureds, undoubtedly\r\n  run the gamut from the ill-informed to knowledgeable purchasers.â€Â  Id. atÂ  420, 618 S.E.2d at 918.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  that American Home did not make a meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM.Â  We\r\n  rule the circuit court properly reformed the policy of insurance to include UM\r\n  and UIM coverage in the amount of the policy limits.Â   \r\nAccordingly, the order of the\r\n  circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J., concurs.Â  \r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nSHORT, J.,\r\n  (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nThe majority\r\n  opinion distinguishes the facts and circumstances of this case from those in\r\n  this courtâ€™s opinion in McDowell v. Travelers Property &amp; Casualty\r\n    Company, 357 S.C. 118, 590 S.E.2d 514 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  I conclude McDowell applies and would reverse the trial courtâ€™s reformation of the partiesâ€™\r\n  contract.\r\nIn McDowell,\r\n  this court found a meaningful offer despite the failure of the offer form to\r\n  meet the Wannamaker test.Â  Id.Â  See State Farm Mut.\r\n    Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987)\r\n  (adopting a four-part test for determining the sufficiency of an offer of\r\n  optional UM and UIM).Â  The court noted that failure to meet the statutory\r\n  requirements â€œdoes not necessarily require reformation of the policy.Â  Rather,\r\n  the insurer bears the burden of establishing it made a meaning offer. . . .â€Â  McDowell,\r\n  357 S.C. at 123, 590 S.E.2d at 516.Â  I find the insurer met that burden in this\r\n  case.\r\nIn the typical\r\n  case, the insured is the party seeking reformation.Â Â  This case presents the\r\n  more unusual circumstance of the insured arguing the offer was meaningful and a\r\n  third party seeking reformation.Â  Under the partiesâ€™ payment agreement, Tyco is\r\n  essentially self-insured for the first $500,000 of a claim.Â  Gerald Goetz, the\r\n  Vice President of Risk Management for Tyco, clarified the valid business\r\n  purpose for denying optional UM and UIM.Â  Goetz explained that Tyco would not\r\n  have bought additional UM and UIM because doing so would expose it to\r\n  additional liability.Â  Gerald Goetz asserted he was knowledgeable and aware of\r\n  his options when declining additional UM and UIM.Â  Goetz had worked in the\r\n  insurance industry as a risk manager for over thirty years and had extensive\r\n  education relating to risk management.Â   \r\nI\r\n  would find Goetz made a knowing and informed decision in rejecting the optional\r\n  coverage.Â  See id. at 124-25, 590 S.E.2d at 517 (finding the risk\r\n  manager made a knowing and informed decision).Â  Furthermore, like the court in McDowell,\r\n  I would consider the arrangement between the contracting parties in this case\r\n  and conclude the insurer met its burden of proving it made a meaningful offer\r\n  to Tyco.Â  Moreover, Goetzâ€™s sophistication is a factor to consider in\r\n  determining whether Tyco received a meaningful offer.Â  See Anders v.\r\n    S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 376, 415 S.E.2d 406, 409 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1992) (finding the sophistication of the insured is a factor that may be\r\n  considered in determining if an offer of optional insurance is meaningful).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough\r\n  this offer may not have been meaningful to the typical insured, under these\r\n  circumstances, considering the sophistication of the insured, I find the offer\r\n  meaningful.Â  See Croft v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402,\r\n  420, 618 S.E.2d 909, 918&nbsp;(2005) (stating â€œ[w]hether a meaningful offer was\r\n  made depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular caseâ€).Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This section was amended with an effective date of\r\n  June 14, 2006, but the amendment would not affect our analysis of the form as\r\n  it was executed on July 1, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4356","title":"Morgan v.

Bruce Morgan appeals the order of the Administrative Law Court\r\n  (ALC) requiring the purchase price to be calculated based on Morganâ€™s highest\r\n  salary.Â  We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nFrom 1982 to 1991, Morgan worked for the State of South Carolina and earned eight years of service credit in Retirement Systems.Â  Morgan\r\n  later withdrew these contributions.Â  From 1991 to 1997, Morgan worked for the\r\n  State of North Carolina and earned public service credit toward his retirement\r\n  account (N.C. Public Service).Â  Morgan rejoined Retirement Systems in November\r\n  2000 when he became Mayor of the City of Union, South Carolina.Â   \r\nIn 2004, Morgan sought to increase his service credit in\r\n  Retirement Systems.Â  On August 20, 2004, Morgan submitted a request to\r\n  Retirement Systems to purchase credit for his N.C. Public Service and\r\n  additional credit equal to the amount he had previously earned between 1982 and\r\n  1991 for his South Carolina service, but had later withdrawn (Withdrawal\r\n  Service).Â  Retirement Systems acknowledged receipt of his request and informed\r\n  him processing might take up to ninety days.Â  On October 4, 2004, Retirement\r\n  Systems notified Morgan he could purchase Withdrawal Service credit for\r\n  $18,995.95 until April 2, 2005.Â  After Retirement Systems received verification\r\n  of Morganâ€™s N.C. Public Service, it notified Morgan he could purchase N.C. Public\r\n  Service credit for $35,562.91 until April 16, 2005.Â   \r\nSoon thereafter, Morgan visited Retirement Systems in person to\r\n  discuss how it had calculated the price of his N.C. Public Service credit.Â \r\n  During this visit, Morgan also inquired about purchasing Non-Qualified Service\r\n  credit.Â  Retirement Systems informed Morgan it had based the price of his\r\n  Public Service credit on the $33,592.00 salary indicated in the Withdrawal\r\n  Service invoice.Â  Furthermore, Retirement Systems advised Morgan if he elected\r\n  not to buy Withdrawal Service first, it could recalculate the purchase price of\r\n  his Public Service credit and Non-Qualified Service credit using his\r\n  then-current salary of $6,610.00.Â  Retirement Systems stated Morgan could\r\n  purchase up to five years of Non-Qualified Service based on the $6,610.00 salary.Â \r\n  Retirement Systems did not advise Morgan he was currently not qualified to purchase\r\n  Non-Qualified Service.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nSubsequently, Morgan submitted a written request to purchase\r\n  Non-Qualified Service credit and N.C. Public Service credit based on the $6,610.00\r\n  salary.Â  Morganâ€™s letter specified he would purchase Withdrawal Service credit\r\n  later.Â  Pursuant to this letter, Retirement Systems recalculated the price of\r\n  Morganâ€™s N.C. Public Service credit as $6,998.03.Â  The October 28, 2004,\r\n  invoice for Morganâ€™s N.C. Public Service credit included a postscript\r\n  indicating â€œyou are not eligible to purchase non qualified service until you\r\n  have reached 5 years of earned service.â€Â  Four weeks later, Morgan purchased\r\n  N.C. Public Service credit from Retirement Systems. Â \r\nOn November 29, 2004, Morgan again called Retirement Systems,\r\n  which erroneously advised him he could purchase Non-Qualified Service credit\r\n  after his N.C. Public Service credit purchase posted.Â  Nine days later,\r\n  Retirement Systems corrected this error by advising Morgan he must have five\r\n  years of earned service before he could purchase Non-Qualified Service credit.Â \r\n  Morgan stated he would first purchase his Withdrawal Service credit, which\r\n  would satisfy the earned-service requirement, and would later submit his\r\n  request to purchase Non-Qualified Service credit.Â  However, instead of\r\n  purchasing Withdrawal Service credit first, Morgan visited Retirement Systems\r\n  and requested to purchase Non-Qualified Service credit.Â  Despite the fact\r\n  Morgan had already completed the purchase of N.C. Public Service credit,\r\n  Retirement Systems instructed Morgan to complete a new written request to\r\n  purchase that credit, and he did so.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  December 14, 2004, Morgan called Retirement Systems and inquired whether he\r\n  could purchase just enough Withdrawal Service credit to make him eligible to\r\n  purchase Non-Qualified Service credit.Â  Retirement Systems informed him he\r\n  could do so, but if he did, he would be unable to purchase the remainder of his\r\n  Withdrawal Service until the following fiscal year.[2]Â \r\n  Morgan submitted a written request to Retirement Systems to purchase Withdrawal\r\n  Service credit, providing Retirement Systems with information about the Smith\r\n  Barney IRA account he intended to use to fund the purchase.Â  Two weeks later,\r\n  Retirement Systems notified Morgan the information he had provided was\r\n  insufficient because it failed to indicate whether the Smith Barney IRA\r\n  consisted of pretax funds.Â  On January 10, 2005, Morgan started a new state job\r\n  at a career-high salary of $89,000.00. Â \r\nMorgan did not contact Retirement Systems again until February 7,\r\n  2005, when he inquired about purchasing Withdrawal Service credit using\r\n  rollover funds from his Wachovia account.Â  In March 2005, Morgan purchased\r\n  Withdrawal Service credit pursuant to the October 4, 2004, invoice using funds\r\n  from a different account than before.Â  Thereafter, Retirement Systems informed\r\n  Morgan that Wachovia had overpaid, and Morgan requested Retirement Systems\r\n  apply the overpayment to his purchase of Non-Qualified Service credit.Â  When Morgan\r\n  learned the cost, he declined to purchase the Non-Qualified Service credit.Â  On\r\n  April 21, 2005, Retirement Systems refunded the overpayment to Wachovia for deposit\r\n  in Morganâ€™s account.Â   \r\nIn May 2005, with no other service available for Morgan to\r\n  purchase, Retirement Systems confirmed the cost of Non-Qualified Service credit\r\n  as $155,750.00, based on his $89,000.00 salary.Â  Morgan appealed in a letter to\r\n  the Director of Retirement Systems.Â  Retirement Systems issued a final agency\r\n  determination confirming $155,750.00 as the cost of Morganâ€™s Non-Qualified\r\n  Service credit.Â  Morgan contested and requested the ALC hear this matter.Â  The\r\n  ALC affirmed Retirement Systemsâ€™ final agency determination.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nReview\r\n  of a decision by the ALC is confined to the record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(4), 1-23-610(C) (Supp. 2006). Â â€œThe findings of the agency are\r\n  presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence.â€Â  Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318\r\n  S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995).Â  â€œâ€˜Substantial evidenceâ€™ is not a\r\n  mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the\r\n  case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached\r\n  or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMorgan\r\n  argues the ALC erred in declining to estop Retirement Systems from calculating\r\n  the cost of Morganâ€™s Non-Qualified Service credit using his current,\r\n  career-high salary because Retirement Systemsâ€™ misinformation and delays\r\n  prevented Morgan from completing his purchase before his salary increased.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â   \r\nUnder\r\n  South Carolina law, active members of Retirement Systems may establish\r\n  service credit for public service, non-qualified service, and previously\r\n  withdrawn service by making payments into the system.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-1140 (Supp. 2007).Â  Furthermore:Â   \r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  active member who has five or more years of earned service credit may establish\r\n  up to five years of nonqualified service by making a payment to the system to\r\n  be determined by the board, but not less than thirty-five percent of the\r\n  memberâ€™s current salary or career highest fiscal year salary, whichever is\r\n  greater, for each year of credit purchased.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 9-1-1140(E).Â  Of the three\r\n  types of purchasable service credit listed above, only previously withdrawn\r\n  service credit may substitute for earned service.Â  Â§&nbsp;9-1-1140(J).Â   \r\nMisrepresentations\r\n  by government officials acting within the proper scope of their authority may\r\n  subject the government to estoppel.Â  McCrowey v.

City of Charleston, 304 S.C. 250,\r\n  257-58, 403 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1991)).Â  Estoppel will not lie against a\r\n  government entity where a government employee gives erroneous information in\r\n  contradiction of statute.Â  Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 415-16 (1990).Â  Simply stated, equity follows the law.Â  Smith\r\n    v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 164, 650 S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ct. App. 2007).Â   \r\nEstoppel\r\n  based on erroneous advice is inappropriate under the facts of this case.Â  Retirement\r\n  Systems administers South Carolinaâ€™s state-employee retirement plans.Â \r\n  Providing plan members with correct information concerning their rights and benefits\r\n  is therefore within Retirement Systemsâ€™ purview.Â  Morgan argues Retirement\r\n  Systems misled him concerning his eligibility to purchase Non-Qualified Service.Â \r\n  However, eligibility to purchase service credit is purely statutory.Â \r\n  Retirement Systems had no discretion to determine an individual memberâ€™s\r\n  eligibility and thus lacked authority to contradict the statute.Â  Therefore,\r\n  estoppel is improper here under both McCrowey and Richmond.Â  \r\n \r\nMorgan\r\n  further argues Retirement Systems should be estopped because Retirement\r\n  Systemsâ€™ delays in processing his requests for service credit prevented him\r\n  from effecting the purchases before his salary increased.Â  The doctrine of equitable estoppel may be enforced in\r\n  a court of law as well as in equity\r\n  matters.â€Â  Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 85, 650 S.E.2d 465,\r\n  471 (2007).Â  â€œThe party asserting estoppel bears the burden of establishing all\r\n  its elements.â€Â  Estes v. Roper Temp. Servs., 304 S.C. 120, 122,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  A government entity may be equitably\r\n  estopped in matters that do not affect the due exercise of its police power or\r\n  the application of public policy.Â  Grant v. City of Folly Beach, 346 S.C. 74, 80, 551 S.E.2d 229, 232 (2001).Â  Estoppel may apply against a\r\n  government agency.Â  Id. Â A party asserting estoppel against the\r\n  government must prove â€œ(1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of\r\n  the truth as to the facts in question, (2) justifiable reliance upon the\r\n  governmentâ€™s conduct, and (3) a prejudicial change in position.â€Â  Id.Â  Absent even one element, estoppel will\r\n  not lie against a government entity.Â  Id. Â However, citizens are presumed to know the law and are charged with exercising â€œreasonable care to\r\n  protect [their] interest[s].â€Â  Smothers v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co.,\r\n  322 S.C. 207, 210-11, 470 S.E.2d 858, 860 (Ct. App. 1996).Â   \r\nMorganâ€™s\r\n  estoppel argument fails on the first two elements.Â  First, Morgan argues he\r\n  lacked knowledge because Retirement Systems misled him as to the truth of his\r\n  situation by failing to inform him he could purchase Non-Qualified Service\r\n  credit only after he purchased Withdrawal Service credit.Â  Furthermore, Morgan\r\n  argues Retirement Systems improperly encouraged him to apply to purchase\r\n  Non-Qualified Service credit immediately after his purchase of N.C. Public\r\n  Service credit posted.Â  However, section 9-1-1140 clearly outlines eligibility\r\n  requirements for each type of service.[3]Â \r\n  Therefore, Morgan had the means to discern for himself whether he was eligible\r\n  to purchase service credit, and thus, he failed to satisfy the first element.Â  \r\n \r\nFor\r\n  the second element, justifiable reliance, Morgan argues he missed his\r\n  â€œdeadlineâ€ because he relied on Retirement Systems to guide him and process his\r\n  requests timely, but Retirement Systems instead misinformed him and caused\r\n  delays.Â  However, Retirement Systems misinformed Morgan on only one occasion,\r\n  correcting its error within nine days.Â  No evidence suggests Morgan acted on\r\n  this misinformation until after Retirement Systems had correctly informed him\r\n  of the need to purchase Withdrawal Service credit first.[4]Â \r\n  Furthermore, no evidence suggests Retirement Systems was aware of any\r\n  â€œdeadline.â€Â  Retirement Systems noted Morgan was confident he would be\r\n  re-elected as mayor and wanted to purchase additional service before he got a\r\n  â€œreal job.â€ Â However, we do not find these notations sufficient to establish\r\n  Retirement Systems knew Morganâ€™s salary would increase significantly on January\r\n  10, 2005.Â  Rather, Retirement Systems appears to have handled a multitude of\r\n  Morganâ€™s requests, both for information and for action, in a reasonably timely\r\n  manner.Â  Lacking any evidence he justifiably relied on the misinformation, Morgan\r\n  failed to satisfy the second element as well.Â   \r\nFor\r\n  the final element, a prejudicial change in position, the record reflects\r\n  Morganâ€™s salary increase permanently raised his cost of purchasing additional\r\n  service credit.Â  This element alone is satisfied.Â  However, without all three\r\n  elements, Morganâ€™s estoppel argument fails.Â   \r\nEquitable\r\n  estoppel against a government entity requires successful proof of all three\r\n  elements.Â  Morgan successfully proved a prejudicial change in position, but he\r\n  failed to prove either lack of knowledge or justifiable reliance.Â  Therefore,\r\n  estoppel against Retirement Systems is inappropriate in this matter.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRetirement\r\n  Systems should not be estopped from using Morganâ€™s January 10, 2005, salary to\r\n  calculate the cost of Non-Qualified Service credit, because Morgan fails to\r\n  satisfy two of the three required elements for estoppel against a government\r\n  entity.Â  Morgan has proved neither lack of knowledge nor justifiable reliance.Â \r\n  Without proving all three elements, Morgan is not entitled to estoppel.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the ALC is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It appears Retirement Systems was unaware at this\r\n  time that Morganâ€™s salary would increase within a few months.Â  Had Morgan\r\n  declined to purchase Withdrawal Service credit, Retirement Systems could not\r\n  have used his former career-high salary of $33,592 to calculate the purchase\r\n  price of other types of credit.Â  Consequently, had Morgan continued to work at\r\n  the $6,610.00 salary until he earned five years of retirement credit,\r\n  Retirement Systems could have calculated the cost of Non-Qualified Service\r\n  credit using his $6,610.00 salary.Â   \r\n[2] See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1140(K).Â   \r\n[3] Morgan attempts to analogize Landing Dev. Corp. v.\r\n  City of Myrtle Beach, 285 S.C. 216, 329 S.E.2d 423 (1985), in which\r\n  estoppel was appropriate where an individual had relied upon the Cityâ€™s\r\n  consistent but improper representations concerning a zoning ordinance, and the\r\n  City later sought to enforce the ordinance.Â  However, that case is\r\n  distinguishable from the one at bar because Morgan at all times had the ability\r\n  to review the statute for himself.Â  Moreover, no evidence indicates Retirement\r\n  Systems consistently misinterpreted the statute.Â   \r\n[4] Morgan often\r\n  repeats Retirement Systemsâ€™ statement, â€œYou will not be penalized due to our\r\n  delay.â€Â  A reasonable person might expect this statement to preclude Retirement\r\n  Systems from imposing any late-filing penalties due to processing delays.Â \r\n  However, Morgan seems to interpret it as an unlimited promise by Retirement\r\n  Systems to indemnify him against any and all changes that might occur during\r\n  the pendency of his request, including those changes within his control.Â  We\r\n  disagree with this view.Â  Morgan undoubtedly knew the effective date and amount\r\n  of his new salary and had the power to decline to accept it.Â  He elected to\r\n  accept it in spite of any consequences to his cost of purchasing retirement\r\n  credit.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4357","title":"State v.

Elliott,\r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.: &nbsp;Appellant Gary Robert Moore (Moore) was convicted of\r\n  felony driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident\r\n  involving death. Moore asserts the trial court erred in refusing to suppress\r\n  evidence removed from his brotherâ€™s truck because the search exceeded the scope\r\n  of consent. He also asserts the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial\r\n  when the solicitor implied that Moore had an affirmative duty to modify his\r\n  statement to police.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\r\nOn the night of\r\n  October 19, 2002, and into the early morning of October 20, 2002, a truck driving\r\n  on Highway 17 in Horry County hit a pedestrian walking on the median and drove\r\n  off. Police investigated this traffic fatality, received a witness report\r\n  describing the vehicle involved, collected remaining parts of the car from the\r\n  scene of the crime, and notified news media.Â  Thereafter, an off duty officer\r\n  reported a truck with a matching description and called in its tag number. Â Officers\r\n  then used that tag number and went to the home of Moore and his brother. Â Both Moore and his brother were informed of the hit\r\n  and run incident and were asked by the police to give consent to process the vehicle. Mooreâ€™s brother notified the\r\n  police that the he owned the truck but that Moore typically drove it.Â  Both\r\n  brothers consented verbally and in writing to allow processing of the truck by\r\n  the South Carolina Highway Patrol. Â In an abundance of caution, a search\r\n  warrant was obtained before taking parts off the vehicle. Â That warrant was\r\n  challenged as defective at trial; however, the state indicated to the court\r\n  that it was proceeding on its theory of consent and the efficacy of the search\r\n  warrant was never addressed by the trial court.Â  Moore concedes on appeal that\r\n  the search warrant issue is not preserved for our review.[2]\r\nWhen processing was\r\n  completed on the vehicle, parts were missing and the battery had been removed\r\n  and placed in the bed of the truck. The truck was inoperable at that point and\r\n  had to be towed for return. Â Because of these actions, Moore asserts the\r\n  officers exceeded the scope of any consent given.Â  Mooreâ€™s motion to suppress\r\n  the evidence was denied by the trial court.\r\nAt trial, Moore also asserted that the solicitor improperly commented on his constitutional right to\r\n  remain silent by suggesting the defendant had a duty to contact the police to\r\n  correct a mistake in his statement to the police.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion and gave a cautionary instruction to the jury.\r\nFrom these rulings,\r\n  the defendant now appeals.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). The appellate\r\n  court â€œis bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.â€ State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d\r\n  105, 111 (2000). The appellate court â€œdoes not re-evaluate the facts based on\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether\r\n  the trial judge's ruling is supported by any evidence.â€ Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI\r\nDid the trial court err by\r\n  denying Mooreâ€™s motion to suppress based on the allegation that investigating\r\n  officers exceeded the scope of consent by removing parts of the truck and\r\n  returning it in an inoperable condition?\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.â€ State v. Gaster, 349 \r\nS.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (citations omitted). â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when\r\n  the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law.â€ State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000) (quoting Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000)).Â  In an appeal from a motion to\r\n  suppress evidence based on Fourth Amendment grounds, our\r\n  review is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s decision.Â  State v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 501, 623 S.E.2d 378,\r\n  386 (2005).\r\nAs to his consent\r\n  argument, Moore primarily relies on State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637,\r\n  541 S.E.2d 837 (2001). Â Forrester stands for the proposition that under the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution, â€œsuspects are free to limit the scope of the\r\n  searches to which they consent.â€ Id. at 648, 541 S.E.2d at 843. â€œWhen\r\n  relying on the consent of a suspect, a police officer's search must not exceed\r\n  the scope of the consent granted or the search becomes unreasonable.â€ Id. â€œThe scope of the consent is measured by a test of â€˜objectiveâ€™ reasonableness- what\r\n  would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the\r\n  officer and the suspect?â€ State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577,\r\n  585-86, 575 S.E.2d 852, 856 (Ct. App. 2003) (citation omitted).Â  Admittedly, a\r\n  cursory review suggests a search which partially dismantled the truck and left\r\n  it inoperable arguably exceeded the scope of consent given.Â  See State\r\n    v. Garcia, 127 N.M. 695, 698, 986 P.2d 491, 494 (N.M. App. 1999), cert.\r\n      granted, 128 N.M. 150, 990 P.2d 824 (N.M. Aug. 11, 1999) (No. 25,837)\r\n  (although an individual consenting to a vehicle search should expect the search\r\n  to be thorough, he need not anticipate the search to include the destruction of\r\n  his vehicle).\r\nHowever, the case\r\n  at hand is distinguishable from the authority upon which Moore relies.Â  While Moore might have had some interest in the truck being searched pursuant to his status as a\r\n  permissive user, even if the search of his brotherâ€™s truck exceeded the scope\r\n  of Mooreâ€™s consent, it did not violate Mooreâ€™s privacy interests.Â  South Carolina cases such as Forrester, which address the scope of consent given to\r\n  investigating officers, pertain to the expansion of an existing search to\r\n  incorporate a compartment or container not covered by the consent given.Â  In\r\n  the case at hand, the issue is not whether the investigating officers intruded\r\n  into a protected, private or hidden area, but rather, the issue is whether they\r\n  exceeded the scope of consent by damaging or dismantling the truck they were\r\n  searching. The damaging or dismantling of Mooreâ€™s truck may give some right of\r\n  recourse to Mooreâ€™s brother, but affords no specific constitutional right to\r\n  Moore himself based on the facts presented in this case.\r\nInitially, we\r\n  question whether Mooreâ€™s constitutional rights were violated due to his lack of\r\n  any reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle since consent to search was\r\n  also given by his brother, the true owner of the vehicle in question.Â  As\r\n  previously mentioned, this case does not involve a violation of Mooreâ€™s right to privacy.Â  For Fourth Amendment purposes, â€œ[a] â€˜seizureâ€™ of property occurs when there is some meaningful\r\n  interference with an individual's possessory interests in\r\n  that property.â€ U.S. v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 133, 104\r\n  S.Ct. 1652, 1656 (1984) (citing U.S. v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 2638 (1983)). Â The only evidence\r\n  presented was that Moore was a regular driver of the vehicle and thus, was a\r\n  permissive user of the vehicle.Â  Even if Moore were the only one to regularly\r\n  drive the vehicle, since Mooreâ€™s brother, the owner, also consented to the\r\n  search and seizure of the vehicle, Moore cannot now claim that any alleged\r\n  possessory interest in the vehicle was infringed or violated.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the context of a passenger occupant, the United States Supreme Court in Rakas\r\n    v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421(1978), addressed whether evidence\r\n  seized in an automobile in which defendants had been passengers should have\r\n  been suppressed. Â The Court held that:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œFourth\r\n  Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional\r\n  rights, may not be vicariously asserted.â€ Â A person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only\r\n  through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third\r\n  person's premises or property has not had any of his Fourth Amendment rights\r\n  infringed. Â And since the exclusionary rule is an attempt to effectuate the\r\n  guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, it is proper to permit only defendants\r\n  whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the rule's\r\n  protections. Â There is no reason to\r\n  think that a party whose rights have been infringed will not, if evidence is\r\n  used against him, have ample motivation to move to suppress it. Â Even if such a\r\n  person is not a defendant in the action, he may be able to recover damages for\r\n  the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, or seek redress under state law\r\n  for invasion of privacy or trespass.\r\n\r\nRakas, 439 U.S. at 133-34, 99 S.Ct. at 425 (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  While there may be\r\n  circumstances under which a non-owner driver can demonstrate the requisite\r\n  expectation of privacy under Rakas to gain standing, no such circumstances have\r\n  been presented in this case. Assuming, arguendo, that a person may have some\r\n  expectation of privacy over that personâ€™s own vehicle parked in the backyard of\r\n  his own residence, Mooreâ€™s constitutional claim is nonetheless unavailing. Â While\r\n  Moore has demonstrated he resided at the location, the record still does not\r\n  suggest such a privacy interest in the vehicle itself to invoke further\r\n  scrutiny by this court. Â He did not have sole custody of the vehicle nor was he\r\n  stopped while he was using the vehicle.Â  We see nothing more of record than his\r\n  status as a permissive user.Â  Any concern raised by virtue of the vehicleâ€™s\r\n  location in the backyard, especially under the South Carolina Constitution, was\r\n  rectified by the consent to take the vehicle from the backyard. Further, as the\r\n  trial court indicated, the only evidence used against him was visually\r\n  accessible on the outside of the vehicle.Â  Thus, any reasonable expectation of\r\n  privacy Moore may have had in the vehicle was not infringed. Additionally, Moore has failed to particularize any injury in fact that he has suffered as a result of\r\n  the search.Â  Accordingly, we find neither a violation of his Fourth Amendment\r\n  rights nor a violation of Art. 1, Section 10 of the S.C. Constitution.Â   \r\nFurthermore, the investigating\r\n  officers had probable cause to search the vehicle obviating the need for expanded\r\n  consent or for analyzing the scope thereof.Â  â€œGenerally, a warrantless search\r\n  is per se unreasonable and thus violative of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition\r\n  against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€ State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 331, 457 S.E.2d 616, 621 (Ct.App.1995) (citing State v. Bailey, 276 S.C. 32, 274 S.E.2d 913\r\n  (1981)). â€œHowever, a\r\n  warrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search\r\n  falls within one of a few specifically established and well delineated\r\n  exceptions to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.â€ Bultron, 318 S.C.\r\n  at 331-32, 457 S.E.2d at 621 (citing State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 347\r\n  S.E.2d 882 (1986)). These exceptions include: (1) search incident to a lawful\r\n  arrest; (2) â€œhot pursuitâ€; (3) stop and frisk; (4) automobile exception; (5)\r\n  â€œplain viewâ€ doctrine; (6) consent; and (7) abandonment. State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 456-57, 462 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1131, 116 S.Ct. 951 (1996).\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  burden of establishing probable cause as well as the existence of circumstances\r\n  constituting an exception to the general prohibition against warrantless\r\n  searches and seizures is upon the prosecution.â€ Bultron, 318 S.C.\r\n  at 332, 457 S.E.2d at 621.Â  The record establishes the requisite probable cause\r\n  in this case.Â  Officer Harrelson testified that a witness who viewed the\r\n  collision described the truck as â€œa camouflaged type colored vehicle, an older\r\n  pickup truck and the clincher was that the license tag was mounted on the left\r\n  side of the bumper which is something you donâ€™t see often.â€ Â That description\r\n  was then conveyed to news media, and a day or two later an off duty officer\r\n  called in a license plate number of a vehicle matching that unique\r\n  description.Â  From that license plate information, Officer Harrelson was able\r\n  to obtain an address for the suspect vehicle. Â Upon arriving at that\r\n  address, Officer Harrelson saw the suspect vehicle in the driveway behind the\r\n  residence.Â  Through visual inspection of that vehicle, Officer Harrelson\r\n  noticed that the license plate was off center, the truck was so rusty that at\r\n  night it could appear camouflage in color, and that it had sustained damage to\r\n  front end.Â  Before giving the consent to take the vehicle, and after being\r\n  given Miranda warnings, Moore voluntarily told the officer he had been driving\r\n  on the night in question around the time of the incident.Â  He further indicated\r\n  that he thought he hit an animal or a bump or something and that there were no\r\n  mechanical problems with the car. Â This combination of information is\r\n  sufficient to establish that the officer had probable cause which, when\r\n  combined with one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement, justifies a\r\n  warrantless search of the vehicle.\r\nAs\r\n  to those previously listed exceptions, we first look to the automobile\r\n  exception.Â  â€œThe two bases for the exception are: (1) the ready mobility of\r\n  automobiles and the potential that evidence may be lost before a warrant is obtained;\r\n  and (2) the lessened expectation of privacy in motor vehicles which are subject\r\n  to governmental regulation.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 491, 351 S.E.2d 570, 571 (1986)\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  In Cox, the\r\n  court found that â€œunder the automobile exception, probable cause alone is\r\n  sufficient to justify a warrantless search.â€ Id. at 492, 351 S.E.2d at\r\n  571-72 (citing California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386, 105 S.Ct. 2066 (1985)). Â \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in State v. Weaver, 374 S.C. 313, 320-21, 649 S.E.2d 479, 483 (2007), the\r\n  supreme court noted that if there is probable cause to search a vehicle at the\r\n  time it is seized, this rationale does not disappear merely because the vehicle\r\n  is taken into police custody or immobilized. Â The court also indicated that it\r\n  does not matter if a few days have passed before the search is conducted. While\r\n  the majority in Weaver suggests it does not matter whether the vehicle\r\n  was on private or public property and the dissent took exception thereto, we\r\n  need not address any further the public / private dichotomy since the concerns\r\n  of both the majority and the dissent are met by the consensual act of Moore and\r\n  his brother allowing the police onto the property to take the vehicle. Â Therefore,\r\n  under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, the presence of\r\n  probable cause validated the search and seizure of the vehicle despite the\r\n  scope of consent given and impoundment of the vehicle by investigating officers.\r\nWe conclude, under\r\n  the circumstances presented, the record herein does not support a violation of\r\n  any reasonable expectation of privacy assertion by Moore to warrant suppression\r\n  of the evidence and we also conclude that Moore failed to particularize any\r\n  specific injury suffered. Moreover, even if the officers exceeded the scope of\r\n  consent, their search of the vehicle was still lawful under the automobile\r\n  exception to the warrant requirement and the evidence was appropriately\r\n  admitted into Mooreâ€™s trial.[3]\r\nII\r\nDid the trial court err by\r\n  failing to declare a mistrial when the solicitor allegedly suggested that Moore had an affirmative duty to modify his statement to police?\r\nMoore argues that\r\n  during closing arguments the solicitor made an impermissible comment on the\r\n  defendantâ€™s right to remain silent when he stated the following:\r\n\r\n\tRemember\r\n  this.Â  Tim Novembrino, a friend of his, Tim Novembrino said, â€œAfter the police\r\n  talked with him, he comes up and says immediately runs to the phone.â€Â  He says,\r\n\t\r\n\tâ€œTim, I\r\n  was with you last night. Right?â€\r\n\tâ€œNo, you\r\n  wasnâ€™t at my house.â€ Â \r\n\tâ€œI spent\r\n  the night with you on the 20th, the 19th going into the\r\n  20th.Â  Right?â€Â  \r\n\tâ€œNo.â€\r\n\tâ€œWell, I\r\n  told the police that.â€\r\n\tTim\r\n  Novembrino said, â€œYou better go back and tell the police something different\r\n  because that is not true.â€\r\n\tPeople,\r\n  you can consider that as evidence of a guilty mind.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion\r\n  amounting to an error of law. State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33,\r\n  615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C.\r\n  454, 458, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct. App. 2000). Granting of a mistrial is a\r\n  serious and extreme measure which should only be taken when the prejudice can\r\n  be removed no other way. Stanley, 365 S.C. at 34, 615 S.E.2d at\r\n  460.Â   \r\nWhile\r\n  the state may not directly or indirectly refer to or comment upon a defendantâ€™s\r\n  exercise of a constitutional right, namely his right to remain silent, here the\r\n  solicitor was commenting on what he characterized as Mooreâ€™s attempt to create\r\n  a false alibi.Â  Furthermore, the solicitor simply restated the testimony that\r\n  was already in the record without objection.Â  â€œImproper comments on a\r\n  defendant's failure to testify do not automatically require\r\n  reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.â€ Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 221, 552 S.E.2d 26, 33 (2001). â€œThe defendant bears the burden of\r\n  demonstrating that improper comments on his refusal to testify deprived him of\r\n  a fair trial.â€ Id. â€œFurthermore, even if the solicitor makes an\r\n  improper comment on the defendant's failure to testify, a curative instruction emphasizing the jury cannot consider [the]\r\n  defendant's failure to testify against him will cure any potential error.â€ Id . Â \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge first gave a cautionary instruction to the jury during trial that\r\n  the testimony of the witness about instructing Moore to call the police was not\r\n  to be held against the defendant and the judge further reminded the jury that\r\n  the defendant had the constitutional right to remain silent.Â  In the final\r\n  charge, the judge again stated that Moore did not have the duty to report to or\r\n  call the police. The judge also reiterated the defendantâ€™s right to remain\r\n  silent and that the defendantâ€™s silence may not be considered against him. Â Even\r\n  if the comment by the solicitor was inappropriate, which we do not so hold,\r\n  having considered the entire record and the charge as a whole, the trial judge\r\n  cured the alleged improper inference by the solicitor, if any.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  any alleged error did not prejudice Moore and was therefore harmless.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons the judgment of the trial court is hereby  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] While we note the existence of a valid search\r\n  warrant may satisfy our concerns about the evidence seized, we nonetheless feel\r\n  compelled to address the arguments on appeal since the state requested the\r\n  trial court to proceed only on the consent theory.\r\n[3] Appellate rules provide that we may affirm a decision upon any grounds appearing in the record. Rule 220(c), SCACR (2006). Â In\r\n  that regard, we note that the plain view doctrine is also potentially\r\n  applicable and was addressed by the trial court.Â  However, one of the elements\r\n  of the doctrine recognized by the South Carolina Supreme Court case is\r\n  inadvertent discovery.Â  State v. Culbreath, 300 S.C. 232, 237, 387\r\n  S.E.2d 255, 257 (1990).Â  Shortly after Culbreath was decided, the United\r\n  States Supreme Court in Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 130, 110\r\n  S.Ct. 2301, 2304 (1990), ruled that the plain view exception to the Fourth\r\n  Amendmentâ€™s warrant requirement applies even if the discovery of the evidence\r\n  was not inadvertent, if the other requirements of the exception are satisfied.Â \r\n  Due to our disposition and in light of the fact that the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court has not yet indicated whether Horton will impact South Carolina\r\n  jurisprudence, especially as it may apply to the South Carolina Constitution,\r\n  we need not address this issue.

Barber, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4358\r\nHeard January 8, 2008 â€“ Filed March 13,\r\n  2008\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert B. Ransom, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t  Charles E. Hill and R. Hawthorne, both of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J:Â  This is an appeal from a directed\r\n  verdict for Dr. Jeffrey Dootson in a medical malpractice case.Â  The disposition\r\n  of this appeal turns on whether there is evidence that Dr. Dootson had notice\r\n  that a surgical drill overheated prior to the injury to the patient, Kelvin\r\n  Thomas.Â  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Thomas, as we must,\r\n  we find evidence Dr. Dootson had notice that the surgical drill was defective\r\n  prior to the injury.Â  As a result, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nI.\r\nDuring\r\n  oral surgery, Thomasâ€™ mouth was severely burned by a malfunctioning drill.Â \r\n  Thomas filed a medical malpractice claim against Dr. Dootson and Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital.[1]Â \r\n  The trial court directed a verdict for Dr. Dootson at the close of Thomasâ€™\r\n  case.\r\nThe\r\n  critical issue at trial, and before us on appeal, is whether Dr. Dootson had\r\n  notice the surgical drill overheated prior to Thomasâ€™ injury.Â  The case was\r\n  tried on the premise that the surgical drill was defective.Â  Beginning with his\r\n  opening statement at trial, Dr. Dootsonâ€™s counsel stated, â€œ[t]he reason this\r\n  injury occurred is quite simple.Â  There was an equipment malfunction.Â  The\r\n  surgical drill that Dr. Dootson was using overheated and burned Mr. Thomasâ€™\r\n  mouth.â€Â  This concession was reiterated on appeal, as Dr. Dootson acknowledged:\r\n\r\n\tThere has never been\r\n  any real dispute that a defective surgical drill resulted in the burn to\r\n  Thomasâ€™ lip.Â  Indeed, the fact was essentially presumed at trial, since the\r\n  Hospital, which had provided the drill, had already settled out of the case.Â \r\n  The central issue at trial, therefore, was whether Dr. Dootson breached his\r\n  standard of care by using the drill during the surgical procedure.\r\n\r\nDr.\r\n  Dootson is bound by his concessions.Â  See Ex parte McMillan, 319\r\n  S.C. 331, 335, 461 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1995) (stating an issue conceded at trial is\r\n  procedurally barred from appellate review); Shorb v. Shorb, 372 S.C. 623, 628 n.3, 643 S.E.2d\r\n  124, 127 n.3 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding a party is bound by a concession in his\r\n  brief).\r\nDr.\r\n  Dootson on appeal attempts to resurrect the need for expert testimony and\r\n  recast the issue by stating, â€œ[i]f the equipment at issue had been something\r\n  simpler and more common, that argument might have some merit.Â  The problem for\r\n  Thomas, though, is that the proper operation of a surgical drill is not something within the lay knowledge of jurors.â€Â  (emphasis in original).Â  We\r\n  believe the concession, as noted above, removed the need for expert testimony\r\n  regarding standard of care concerning the operation of the surgical drill.\r\nWere\r\n  we in any event inclined to adopt Dr. Dootsonâ€™s argument that his argument\r\n  concerning the need for expert testimony is properly before us, we would reject\r\n  it.Â  Generally, expert testimony is required in medical malpractice cases to\r\n  show the doctor failed to conform to the required standard of care; however, an\r\n  exception exists when â€œthe common knowledge or experience of laymen is\r\n  extensive enough for them to be able to recognize or infer negligence on the\r\n  part of the doctor and also to determine the presence of the required causal\r\n  link between the doctorâ€™s actions and the patientâ€™s medical problems.â€Â  Pederson\r\n    v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 142, 341 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1986).Â  The South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court has held a tubal ligation rendering an intrauterine\r\n  device or any other birth control device useless constitutes a matter of common\r\n  knowledge.Â  Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 192, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913\r\n  (1978).Â  If the subject matter of Green is within the common knowledge\r\n  exception, a claim arising from a surgical drill that burns skin on contact\r\n  would fall well within the common knowledge or experience of laymen.\r\nWe\r\n  turn to the dispositive issue of notice to determine if evidence of notice\r\n  existed.Â  When reviewing a directed verdict, this court will view the evidence\r\n  and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.Â  Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).Â \r\n  â€œA jury issue exists where the evidence is susceptible of more than one\r\n  reasonable inference.â€Â  Jones v. Ridgely Commcâ€™ns, Inc., 304 S.C. 452,\r\n  454, 405 S.E.2d 402, 403 (1991).Â  â€œWhen considering directed verdict and JNOV\r\n  motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to\r\n  decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.â€Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 419 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000).Â  Further, this court stated in Weaver v. Lentz, 348 S.C. 672,\r\n  680-81, 561 S.E.2d 360, 365 (Ct. App. 2002):\r\n\r\n\t[I]t is\r\n  not unusual for a case to have contradictory evidence and inconsistent\r\n  testimony from a witness.Â  In a law case tried\r\n  before a jury, it is the jury that must decide what part of the witnessâ€™s\r\n  testimony it wants to believe and what part it wants to disbelieve.Â  Under such\r\n  circumstances, it is not the function of this Court to weigh the evidence and\r\n  determine the credibility of the witnesses.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, Thomas presented testimony Dr. Dootson was warned of a drill\r\n  overheating in a previous surgery and the drill being used for Thomasâ€™ surgery\r\n  was hot.Â  At trial, the following exchange occurred without objection during\r\n  the questioning of surgical technician, Michael Ellis:[2]\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Mr.\r\n  Ellis, thereâ€™s no question, you said, that the drill malfunctioned?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Correct.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  No\r\n  question that Dr. Dootson was warned about this drill?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Correct.\r\n\tQ.Â Â Â Â Â  After\r\n  you had warned him and after it started getting hot, did Dr. Dootson do\r\n  anything to check the drill to see whether it was still safe to use?\r\n\tA.Â Â Â Â Â  No.\r\n\r\nEllis also testified when Dr.\r\n  Dootson passed him the drill prior to Thomasâ€™ injury, Ellis noticed the drill\r\n  was â€œwarmer than normal.â€\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the following colloquy occurred without objection during the direct examination\r\n  of surgical technician, Charlotte Rivers:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  After\r\n  you noticed the drill was getting hot, did you say anything to Dr. Dootson?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  No.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And\r\n  why not?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  He\r\n  had already been told that the drill was hot.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Was\r\n  [Dr. Dootson] aware there was a problem with the drill before [Thomas] got\r\n  burned?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a jury question\r\n  was presented on the issue of notice, rendering a directed verdict\r\n  inappropriate.\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court excluded some of the testimony regarding notice as hearsay.Â  We\r\n  address this assignment of error now in the interest of judicial economy.Â  See Floyd v. Horry County Sch. Dist., 351 S.C. 233, 234, 569 S.E.2d 343, 344\r\n  (2002) (addressing the merits in the interest of judicial economy).\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™\r\n  is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\r\n  trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.â€ Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Conversely, statements offered not for the truth\r\n  of the matter asserted, but rather as evidence of notice, do not constitute\r\n  hearsay.Â  Player v. Thompson, 259 S.C. 600, 610, 193 S.E.2d 531, 535\r\n  (1972).\r\nFrom\r\n  an evidentiary standpoint, the facts and analysis in Player mirror those\r\n  in this case.Â  In Player, the court held testimony a filling station\r\n  attendant told the defendant she had slick tires prior to the accident did not\r\n  constitute hearsay.Â  Id.Â  The testimony was not offered to prove the\r\n  tires were slick, but only to establish the defendant had notice of her tiresâ€™\r\n  condition prior to the accident.Â  Id.Â  Other evidence established the\r\n  slickness of the tires.Â  Id.\r\nSimilarly\r\n  in this case, Thomas attempted to offer additional testimony from Rivers that\r\n  Dr. Dootson had been warned the drill was hot prior to the injury.Â  The trial\r\n  court improperly ruled the statement was hearsay. Â The testimony, just as in Player,\r\n  was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather as evidence of\r\n  notice.Â  The argument for admissibility is at least equally strong here as in Player,\r\n  for here we are presented with a concession concerning the defective condition\r\n  of the surgical drill.Â  It was error to exclude this testimony.\r\nWe\r\n  decline to address the remaining issues.Â  See Ringer v. Graham,\r\n  286 S.C. 14, 20, 331 S.E.2d 373, 377 (Ct. App. 1985) (determining discussion of\r\n  remaining issues was unnecessary when an issue was dispositive in reversing a\r\n  directed verdict).\r\nIII.\r\nThe\r\n  grant of the directed verdict is reversed, as is the ruling excluding Riversâ€™\r\n  testimony.Â \r\n  We remand for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The claim against the hospital was settled\r\n  prior to trial.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Dr. Dootson argues Ellis solely warned Dr. Dootson a\r\n  drill malfunctioned in a prior surgery; however, this is not necessarily\r\n  consistent with the testimony and is a question for the jury when weighing the\r\n  testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4359","title":"State v.

Elliott,\r\n  and Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney\r\n  General, of Columbia, and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.: Virgil Lee Culbreath appeals from his\r\n  conviction for trafficking of crack cocaine, asserting the trial judge erred in\r\n  denying Culbreathâ€™s motion for a mistrial after the Stateâ€™s witness mentioned\r\n  prior drug dealings with Culbreath.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nCulbreath was indicted in 2004 on one\r\n  count of trafficking crack cocaine and one count of distribution of crack\r\n  cocaine within the proximity of a school or park.Â  Both counts arose from an\r\n  April 30, 2004 controlled sale to a confidential informant.Â Â   \r\nAt trial,\r\n  the State called the confidential informant, Kontay Gaines as a witness.Â \r\n  Gaines testified he had been arrested several times for selling drugs and\r\n  incarcerated twice.Â  Gaines further stated that after he was arrested in\r\n  November 2003, he told law enforcement officials he could buy drugs from Culbreath.[2]Â  The solicitor then asked Gaines how\r\n  he knew Culbreath but instructed him not to talk about any business\r\n  transactions.Â  Culbreathâ€™s counsel moved for a mistrial, contending the term\r\n  â€œbusiness transactionsâ€ inferred drug transactions.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion.Â  Before the jury returned to the courtroom, the solicitor specifically\r\n  instructed Gaines not to talk about any prior drug transactions with\r\n  Culbreath.Â   \r\nDuring direct examination Gaines testified he met Culbreath in\r\n  1994 and that Culbreath dated his stepsister. Â Gaines proceeded to detail the\r\n  April 30, 2004 controlled sale from Culbreath.Â  Gaines explained he met with\r\n  law enforcement officers at the airport where the officers searched Gaines and\r\n  his vehicle.Â  The officers provided Gaines with $3000 and a beeper.Â  Gaines\r\n  went to Culbreathâ€™s residence and arranged to purchase three ounces of crack\r\n  cocaine for $3000.Â  Once Gaines left Culbreathâ€™s residence, the officers\r\n  contacted Gaines and instructed him to meet them at a nearby church.Â  The\r\n  officers searched Gaines and the vehicle, and changed the battery in the\r\n  beeper.Â  Gaines then drove to a restaurant parking lot to wait for Culbreathâ€™s\r\n  call.Â   \r\nCulbreath pulled up next to Gaines in the parking lot and told\r\n  Gaines to follow him.Â  Gaines followed Culbreath to a house in Edgefield.Â  Once\r\n  inside Culbreath explained he could not get the three ounces Gaines wanted but\r\n  gave Gaines a paper bag containing two ounces of crack cocaine.Â  Gaines paid\r\n  Culbreath $2000, left the house, and drove to a prearranged location to meet\r\n  with the officers.Â  He turned the crack cocaine and remaining $1000 over to the\r\n  officers.Â   \r\nOn cross-examination, Culbreathâ€™s counsel asked Gaines if the\r\n  drugs he sold when he was arrested in November 2003 were â€œfrontedâ€ to him.Â \r\n  Gaines replied, â€œ[y]es sir, from Virgil Culbreath.â€Â  Culbreathâ€™s counsel\r\n  indicated he had a motion, and the trial court indicated it would be\r\n  entertained later.Â  Culbreathâ€™s counsel continued to question Gaines about the\r\n  drugs he purchased from Culbreath on April 30, 2004. Â Gaines was asked if he\r\n  checked inside the package containing the crack cocaine.Â  Gaines replied he did\r\n  not, and then asked if he could say why he did not check the package.Â \r\n  Culbreathâ€™s counsel asked him â€œwhy,â€ and Gaines responded â€œ[b]ecause I dealt\r\n  with [Culbreath] before and I never had to check it.â€Â  Defense counsel again\r\n  indicated he had a motion, and the trial court stated he could make it at the\r\n  proper time.Â   \r\nAfter Gaines finished testifying, counsel moved for a mistrial\r\n  based on Gainesâ€™ testimony referring to previous dealings with Culbreath.Â  In\r\n  reply, the State noted Gaines testified, without objection, he told the police\r\n  he knew he could buy drugs from Culbreath.Â  Further, the State argued Gainesâ€™\r\n  subsequent testimony was in response to questions from defense counsel and\r\n  therefore the defense opened the door to the testimony.Â  The trial court found\r\n  counsel opened the door to the testimony by asking whether Gaines had drugs\r\n  â€œfrontedâ€ to him, and then asking him why he did not check inside the package\r\n  he received from Culbreath.Â  Thus, the trial court conditionally denied the\r\n  mistrial motion and instructed Culbreathâ€™s counsel he could provide the court\r\n  with relevant case law the following day.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  next morning, defense counsel presented two cases in support of his request for\r\n  a mistrial.[3]Â \r\n  After reviewing the cases, the trial court denied the motion, finding the cases\r\n  were distinguishable because they involved the Stateâ€™s attempt to introduce\r\n  prior bad acts or prior crimes evidence, while the instant case involved\r\n  responses to questions posed by the defense counsel.Â   \r\nThe trial court directed a verdict for Culbreath on the proximity\r\n  charge and submitted the trafficking charge to the jury.Â  Culbreath was\r\n  convicted of trafficking crack cocaine and sentenced to fifteen years\r\n  incarceration.Â  This appeal follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether to grant or\r\n  deny a mistrial motion is a matter within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion,\r\n  and the courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1,\r\n  12-13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999); State v. White, 371 S.C. 439, 443-44,\r\n  639 S.E.2d 160, 162 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  A mistrial should be declared only when\r\n  absolutely necessary.Â  Council, 335 S.C. at 13, 515 S.E.2d at 514.Â  In\r\n  order to receive a mistrial, a defendant must show error and resulting\r\n  prejudice.Â  Id.Â  It is only in cases of abuse of discretion which result\r\n  in prejudice that this court will intervene and grant a new trial.Â  White,\r\n  371 S.C. at 444, 639 S.E.2d at 162. Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially, we note\r\n  that any argument by Culbreath that the trial court erred in denying his motion\r\n  for a mistrial based upon a comment or question made by the solicitor is not\r\n  properly presented for appeal.Â   \r\nâ€œIn\r\n  order for an issue to be properly presented for appeal, the appellantâ€™s brief\r\n  must set forth the issue in the statement of issues on appeal.â€Â  Langehans\r\n    v. Smith, 347 S.C. 348, 352, 554 S.E.2d 681, 683 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered\r\n  which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€).Â   \r\nCulbreathâ€™s\r\n  appellate brief contains only one argument. Â The heading above the argument\r\n  states, â€œ[t]he trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial after the\r\n  Stateâ€™s key witness mentioned several times prior drug dealings with\r\n  appellant.â€Â  While Culbreathâ€™s appellate brief recounts the question asked by\r\n  the solicitor, the legal argument presented applies only to the statements made\r\n  by Gaines.Â  Culbreath provides no legal authority or supportive arguments as to\r\n  any improper question asked by the solicitor.Â   \r\nIt\r\n  is error for the appellate court to consider an issue not properly raised to\r\n  it.Â  First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514\r\n  (1994).Â  Therefore, this court is limited to addressing the single issue raised\r\n  by Culbreath in his brief as to whether the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  grant a mistrial after Gaines mentioned prior drug dealings with Culbreath.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nCulbreath\r\n  contends Gainesâ€™ references to Culbreathâ€™s prior drug dealings were an\r\n  impermissible attempt to submit evidence of prior bad acts.Â  Further, Culbreath\r\n  claims the references were prejudicial because they were shockingly similar to\r\n  the charge for which Culbreath was on trial.Â   \r\nGenerally,\r\n  evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is not admissible to prove the crime for\r\n  which the defendant is charged.Â  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 416, 118\r\n  S.E. 803, 807 (1923).Â  Such evidence is admissible when it tends to show (1)\r\n  motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme\r\n  or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other\r\n  that proof of one tends to establish the others; or (5) the identity of the\r\n  person charged with the commission of the crime on trial.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  evidence of prior crimes or bad acts must be relevant to prove the alleged\r\n  crime.Â  State v. Campbell, 317 S.C. 449, 451, 454 S.E.2d 899, 901 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1994).Â  When the prior bad acts are â€œstrikingly similar to the one for\r\n  which the appellant is being tried, the danger of prejudice is enhanced.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Gore, Â 283 S.C. 118, 121, 322 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1984).Â  â€œ[E]ven if [the]\r\n  prior bad act evidence is clear and convincing and falls within an exception,\r\n  it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.â€ State v. Gillian, 373 S.C.\r\n  601, 611, 646 S.E.2d 872, 877 (2007).Â  This balancing process is reflected in\r\n  Rule 403, SCRE.\r\nNotwithstanding,\r\n  a defendant may open the door to what would be otherwise improper evidence\r\n  through his own introduction of evidence or witness examination. Â State v.\r\n    Young, 364 S.C. 476, 485-87, 613 S.E.2d 386, 391-92 (Ct. App. 2005), cert granted, Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 9 (Jan. 5, 2007) (discussing South Carolina jurisprudence regarding opening the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence).Â \r\n  A party cannot complain of prejudice from evidence to which he opened the\r\n  door.Â  State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 474, 409 S.E.2d 404, 408 (1991); Young, 364 S.C. at 485-88, 613 S.E.2d at 391-93, cert granted,\r\n  Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 9 (Jan. 5, 2007).  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the State did not submit any evidence regarding Culbreathâ€™s prior\r\n  drug transactions and specifically instructed Gaines not to discuss prior drug\r\n  transactions between him and Culbreath.Â  The evidence at issue resulted from\r\n  defense counselâ€™s questioning of Gaines.Â  When counsel asked Gaines whether the\r\n  crack cocaine he was selling in November 2003 was â€œfrontedâ€ for him, Gaines\r\n  replied, â€œ[y]es sir, from [Culbreath].â€Â  Culbreathâ€™s counsel subsequently asked\r\n  Gaines if he checked the package he received from Culbreath, and Gaines\r\n  replied, â€œ[n]o sir.â€Â  Gaines then asked if he could state why he did not check\r\n  the package.Â  When Culbreathâ€™s counsel asked him â€œ[w]hy,â€ Gaines stated\r\n  â€œ[b]ecause I dealt with [Culbreath] before and I never had to check it.â€Â  We\r\n  find the defense opened the door to the references made about Culbreathâ€™s prior\r\n  drug dealing with Gaines.Â  Accordingly we find the trial court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial.Â   \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the decision of the trial court is hereby  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Culbreath\r\n  did not object to this testimony.Â   \r\n[3] Culbreath presented State v.

Elliot,\r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, Office of the\r\n  Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of\r\n  Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Hoss Hicks appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision to grant\r\n  the Stateâ€™s motion to reconsider his sentence, specifically asserting that good\r\n  cause was not shown to require him to register as a sex offender.Â  We disagree\r\n  and affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nHicks was indicted for criminal sexual conduct with a minor\r\n  (Victim).Â  At trial, Hicks pled guilty to the lesser offense of assault and\r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN), although he admitted to \r\nhaving had sex with the fourteen-year-old Victim.Â  During sentencing, both\r\n  parties were invited to make statements to the court, and defense counsel indicated\r\n  that he didnâ€™t think Hicks knew where Victim lived. Â Ultimately, Hicks was\r\n  sentenced to ten years imprisonment, suspended upon time served with five years\r\n  probation.Â  Although the State had requested it as an additional condition to\r\n  his sentence, Hicks was not required to register as a sex offender.Â  However, the\r\n  circuit court did include as a condition of his probation, that Hicks not live\r\n  within five miles of Victimâ€™s family and have no contact with the family or Victim.\r\n \r\nThe following day,\r\n  the State moved to reconsider the sentence, arguing Victimâ€™s father was not\r\n  able to attend the plea and wished to be heard by the court.Â  In addition, the\r\n  State sought to clarify defense counselâ€™s assertion that Hicks did not know\r\n  where Victim lived.Â  Upon reconsideration, the court declined to increase\r\n  Hicksâ€™ sentence, but ordered Hicks to register as a sex offender.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed absent a prejudicial\r\n  abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.â€ Â State v. Sheldon,\r\n  344 S.C. 340, 342, 543 S.E.2d 585, 585-586 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when\r\n  grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHicks argues the\r\n  circuit court abused its discretion in reconsidering its sentence. Â We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  authority to change a sentence rests exclusively with the sentencing judge and is\r\n  within his or her discretion.Â  State v. Smith, 276 S.C. 494, 498, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 200, 202 (1981). Â A judge or\r\n  other sentencing authority is to be accorded very wide discretion in\r\n  determining an appropriate sentence, and must be permitted to consider any and\r\n  all information that reasonably might bear on the proper sentence for the\r\n  particular defendant, given the crime committed.Â  Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559, 563 (1984).Â  Here, the State made a timely motion to reconsider\r\n  based upon additional information which Victimâ€™s father, who was not present at\r\n  the original sentencing, could provide, as well as to clarify alleged\r\n  misstatements made by Hicksâ€™ counsel during sentencing.Â  We find the circuit\r\n  court acted within its authority in hearing the motion to reconsider Hicksâ€™ sentence.Â  \r\n \r\nHicks\r\n  also maintains the circuit court abused its discretion in ordering him to\r\n  register as a sex offender.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  23-3-430 of the South Carolina Code (2007) provides the instances in which it\r\n  is appropriate for a court to order a person to register as a sex offender.Â \r\n  Although ABHAN, the crime to which Hicks pled guilty, is not included in the\r\n  list, Section D provides that:\r\n\r\n\t[U]pon\r\n  conviction, adjudication of delinquency, guilty plea, or plea of nolo\r\n  contendere of a person of an offense not listed in this article, the presiding\r\n  judge may order as a condition of sentencing that the person be included in the\r\n  sex offender registry if good cause is shown by the solicitor.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(D) (2007).\r\nHicks\r\n  contends the State failed to show â€œgood causeâ€ sufficient to require him to\r\n  register as a sex offender.Â As noted earlier, although he pled to ABHAN, Hicks \r\nadmitted at the plea hearing to having sex with the fourteen-year-old Victim. In the reconsideration hearing, the court heard\r\n  from Victimâ€™s father that, contrary to defense counselâ€™s statement during the\r\n  initial sentencing, Hicks did indeed know where Victim lived; Hicks lived\r\n  within a half mile of Victimâ€™s house. Â Describing the nature of Hicksâ€™\r\n  behavior, Victimâ€™s father stated Hicks had been by Victimâ€™s house on numerous\r\n  occasions, both before and after the ABHAN.Â  During the course of several of\r\n  these occurrences, Hicks made gestures towards Victimâ€™s father that could be\r\n  interpreted as confrontational or predatory.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  court also heard from Victimâ€™s mother a second time, but she was limited to\r\n  providing information she had not given during the initial sentencing.Â  She confirmed\r\n  Victimâ€™s fatherâ€™s statement that, not only did Hicks know where Victim lived,\r\n  but that it was her understanding from Victim that Hicks had actually been in\r\n  Victimâ€™s house on two occasions.Â  This new information combined with the\r\n  previous statements Victimâ€™s mother made regarding the many girls, similar in\r\n  age to Victim, who lived in the same neighborhood within a half mile of Hicks,\r\n  supports the circuit courtâ€™s finding that good cause was shown. Â Â \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED[1].\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4361","title":"Abate v.

additionally, it found Father in contempt on one issue\r\n  and in violation of the Decree on another issue.Â  The family court declined to\r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees or costs to either party.Â   \r\nFather\r\n  moved for reconsideration of eight issues, including contempt findings and the\r\n  denial of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  After rehearing, the family court still declined to\r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees but held Mother in contempt on five issues.Â  It held\r\n  Father in contempt on one issue, his refusal to give Child his ADHD medication\r\n  during July 2005.Â  Furthermore, the family court held Father was not entitled to\r\n  a credit for his childcare expenses and must reimburse Mother the amount of the\r\n  money he had withheld.Â  The family court did not hold Father in contempt for\r\n  claiming the childcare credit.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Contempt for\r\n  Failure to Medicate\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred in holding him in contempt for failing to give\r\n  Child ADHD medication during summer vacation.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nAn\r\n  appellate court should reverse a decision regarding contempt only if it is\r\n  without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.Â  Brandt\r\n    v. Gooding, 368 S.C. 618, 627, 630 S.E.2d 259, 263&nbsp;(2006).Â  An\r\n  appellate court will reverse a manifest abuse of discretion where the error of\r\n  law is â€œso opposed to the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion as to amount to a\r\n  deprivation of the legal rights of the party.â€ Â Jeter v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 438, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 143, 145-46 (2006).Â  The term â€œabuse of discretionâ€ does not reflect\r\n  negatively on the trial court; rather, it merely indicates the appellate court\r\n  believes an error of law occurred in the circumstances at hand.Â  Macauley v.\r\n    Query, 193 S.C. 1, 5, 7 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1940).Â   \r\nâ€œContempt\r\n  results from a willful disobedience of a court order.â€Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay,\r\n  328 S.C. 329, 345, 491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Willful disobedience\r\n  requires an act to be â€œdone voluntarily and intentionally with the specific\r\n  intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to\r\n  do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose\r\n  either to disobey or disregard the law.â€ Spartanburg Co. Depâ€™t of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988).Â  A party seeking a contempt finding for\r\n      violation of a court order must show the orderâ€™s existence and facts\r\n      establishing the other party did not comply with the order.Â  Hawkins v.\r\n        Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\n\r\nWe find the family court\r\n  abused its discretion in holding Father in contempt for not giving Child his\r\n  ADHD medication during summer break.Â  Father and Mother agreed, and the family\r\n  court ordered, that:\r\n\r\n\tBoth\r\n  parties shall follow [Child]â€™s pediatricianâ€™s and/or psychiatristâ€™s orders\r\n  regarding medication, and in particular, that he timely and without\r\n  interruption takes his prescribed medicine for ADHD and both parties shall\r\n  ensure that [Child] continues with counseling on a regular basis when he is in\r\n  their respective care.Â  The parties concur that they shall strive to utilize\r\n  drug-free methods of raising [Child].Â  \r\n\r\nTwo of the Decreeâ€™s three provisions\r\n  concerning Childâ€™s health care required interaction with health care\r\n  providers.Â  However, the family court held Mother in contempt for â€œfailure to\r\n  communicate with [Father] on issues of the childâ€™s health, education, and\r\n  welfare and failure to provide [Father] full accessâ€ to Childâ€™s medical\r\n  records.Â  The family court specifically found Mother redacted the names and addresses\r\n  of Childâ€™s Ohio medical providers from the documents she provided to Father.Â \r\n  Moreover, Mother withheld the second opinion she obtained concerning Childâ€™s\r\n  ADHD diagnosis from Father until the time of trial.Â  We believe that without\r\n  full access to Childâ€™s Ohio physicians and records, Father could not reasonably\r\n  be expected to perform his obligations.Â   \r\nAbsent\r\n  direction from Childâ€™s Ohio physicians, Father attempted to consult with the\r\n  physicians whose identities he divined.Â  Childâ€™s Ohio pediatrician agreed with Fatherâ€™s\r\n  suggestion of a drug holiday.Â  After Childâ€™s current Ohio psychiatrist declined\r\n  to opine concerning a drug holiday, Father presented Child to a Charleston physician for an evaluation and recommendation.Â  After exhausting his contacts\r\n  in Ohio and obtaining the Charleston physicianâ€™s approval of a temporary\r\n  suspension of medication, Father stopped giving Child his ADHD medication.[2]Â   \r\nWe\r\n  believe Fatherâ€™s acts demonstrate a good-faith effort to comply with the\r\n  Decreeâ€™s requirement to follow Childâ€™s â€œpediatricianâ€™s and/or psychiatristâ€™s\r\n  orders regarding medication.â€ Â Additionally, we believe Fatherâ€™s temporary,\r\n  physician-sanctioned drug holiday for Child indicates an effort to comply with\r\n  the Decree by exploring â€œdrug-free methods of raising [Child]â€ outside Childâ€™s\r\n  school year to avoid compromising Childâ€™s performance in school.Â  Father did\r\n  not willfully disobey a court order.Â  Therefore, the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in finding Father in contempt for failing to give Child his ADHD medication\r\n  during the summer holiday.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp; Childcare Costs\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred in excluding his summer 2005 work-related\r\n  childcare expenses from the childcare costs divisible between the parties.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the agreement on its face does not indicate Fatherâ€™s summer 2005 work-related\r\n  childcare costs should be included in total childcare costs.Â  In any event, the\r\n  agreement contains no provision for Father to obtain credit for his\r\n  work-related childcare costs.Â  â€œUnambiguous marital agreements will be enforced\r\n  according to their terms . . . regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or\r\n  the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.â€Â  Davis v.\r\n    Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 75, 641 S.E.2d 446, 451-52 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  A court\r\n  will only look to extrinsic evidence if an ambiguity exists in the agreementâ€™s\r\n  terms.Â  Id. at 75, 641 S.E.2d at 452.Â  In the case at bar, the Decree\r\n  required that Father â€œcontribute to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;one-half of\r\n  [Childâ€™s] work related childcare costs.Â  MOTHER shall provide FATHER with\r\n  copies of receipts for same with FATHER reimbursing MOTHER within Thirty (30)\r\n  days.â€Â  (emphasis in original)Â  The parties agreed this provision was\r\n  unambiguous and waived their rights to present additional evidence of intent.Â \r\n  Interpretation of this provision thus became a question of law.Â  Consequently,\r\n  we see no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to exclude Fatherâ€™s work-related\r\n  childcare costs.[3]Â   \r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred in denying Fatherâ€™s motion for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â \r\n  We disagree but remand for further consideration of the effects of this appeal\r\n  on the outcome of this matter.Â   \r\nIn a\r\n  family court matter, â€œ[t]he award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left to the discretion\r\n  of the trial judge and will only be disturbed upon a showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648\r\n  (2006).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award either party\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees in this matter.Â  Under South Carolina law, the family court has\r\n  jurisdiction to determine whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees in a matter properly\r\n  before it.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(38) (Supp. 2006).Â  The family court\r\n  may award attorneyâ€™s fees under different theories.[4]Â \r\n  Here, the family court evaluated the request on the basis of beneficial\r\n  results.Â  â€œIn making this determination, the court should evaluate the\r\n  requesting partyâ€™s ability to pay, the partiesâ€™ respective financial\r\n  conditions, the effect of the award on each partyâ€™s standard of living, and the\r\n  beneficial results achieved.â€Â  Upchurch, 367 S.C. at 28, 624 S.E.2d at\r\n  648.Â  A beneficial result will not secure an award of attorneyâ€™s fees where the\r\n  other factors do not support such an award.Â  Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C.\r\n  203, 214, 532 S.E.2d 890, 895 (Ct. App. 2000).[5]Â   \r\nIn declining\r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees to either side, the family court found each party had\r\n  achieved beneficial results.Â  Of the nine issues for which Father sought a\r\n  contempt ruling against Mother, the family court held Mother in contempt on\r\n  five and found her in violation of the Decree, but not in contempt, on one.Â  Of\r\n  the three issues for which Mother sought a contempt ruling against Father, the\r\n  family court held Father in contempt on one and in violation of the Decree, but\r\n  not in contempt, on one.Â  It appears each party prevailed on at least one issue\r\n  and successfully defended against at least one issue, thereby achieving a\r\n  beneficial result.Â   \r\nNo\r\n  evidence exists concerning either partyâ€™s ability to pay, either partyâ€™s\r\n  financial condition, or the likely effect of such an award on either partyâ€™s\r\n  standard of living.Â  The issues presented to the family court were complex, and\r\n  we believe both parties proceeded in good faith.Â  Accordingly, we find the\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in ordering each party to pay his or\r\n  her own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, because we herein reverse the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding of contempt for Fatherâ€™s failure to medicate, Father is no longer in\r\n  contempt on any issues and has prevailed on six issues.Â  By contrast, Mother\r\n  was found in contempt on five issues and has prevailed on one, the issue of\r\n  Fatherâ€™s claimed credit for childcare costs.[6]Â \r\n  Consequently, we remand on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for consideration of\r\n  the effects of this appeal.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of contempt, we find Father made good-faith efforts to comply with\r\n  the terms of the Decree by giving Child a physician-recommended drug holiday.Â \r\n  Because Father did not willfully disobey a court order, we find the family\r\n  court erred in holding Father in contempt for temporarily suspending Childâ€™s\r\n  ADHD medication.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the order of the family court on this\r\n  issue.Â   \r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of Fatherâ€™s work-related childcare costs, we find the governing\r\n  language of the Decree does not provide for Father receiving credit or\r\n  childcare costs he expended.Â  We find the family court did not err in excluding\r\n  Fatherâ€™s summer 2005 work-related childcare costs from its analysis, and we affirm\r\n  the order of the family court on this issue.Â   \r\nFinally,\r\n  as to the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees, we remand this issue to the family court for\r\n  further consideration in light of this decision.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] No health care provider has specifically warned or\r\n  recommended against a temporary suspension of Childâ€™s medication.Â  Both Childâ€™s\r\n  Ohio pediatrician and the Charleston doctor who provided Fatherâ€™s second\r\n  opinion endorsed the proposed drug holiday.Â  Childâ€™s Ohio psychiatrist declined\r\n  to comment on the proposed drug holiday.Â  The doctor who provided Mother with a\r\n  second opinion made recommendations for modifications to Childâ€™s prescription\r\n  but did not address whether Child should have a drug holiday outside the school\r\n  year.Â   \r\n[3] Our decision today does not preclude the parties from\r\n  petitioning the family court to reinterpret the provision to ascertain the\r\n  intention of the parties.Â   \r\n[4] The issue of whether the family court applied the\r\n  correct standard to the question of attorneyâ€™s fees is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  However, we note the family court could have applied the compensatory\r\n  contempt theory enunciated in Miller v. Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 463, 652\r\n  S.E.2d 754, 764-65 (Ct. App. 2007):\r\n\r\n\tCourts,\r\n  by exercising their contempt power, can award attorneyâ€™s fees under a\r\n  compensatory contempt theory. &nbsp;Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc.,\r\n  348 S.C. 171, 178-79, 557 S.E.2d 708, 711-12 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp;\r\n  Compensatory contempt seeks to reimburse the party for the costs it incurs in\r\n  forcing the non-complying party to obey the courtâ€™s orders. &nbsp;â€œIn a civil\r\n  contempt proceeding, a contemnor may be required to reimburse a complainant for\r\n  the costs he incurred in enforcing the courtâ€™s prior order, including\r\n  reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is not a\r\n  punishment but an indemnification to the party who instituted the contempt proceeding.â€&nbsp; \r\n\tPoston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1998); Lindsay\r\n    v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 345, 491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œA\r\n  compensatory contempt award may include attorney fees.â€); Curlee v. Howle,\r\n  277 S.C. 377, 386-87, 287 S.E.2d 915, 919-20 (1982) (â€œCompensatory contempt is\r\n  a money award for the [Wife] when the [Husband]&nbsp; has injured the [Wife] by\r\n  violating a previous court order . . . . &nbsp;Included in the actual loss are\r\n  the costs of defending and enforcing the courtâ€™s order, including litigation\r\n  costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.â€). &nbsp;The court is not required to provide the\r\n  contemnor with an opportunity to purge himself of these attorneyâ€™s fees in\r\n  order to hold him in civil contempt.&nbsp; Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56,\r\n  76, 615 S.E.2d 465, 476 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Poston, 331 S.C. at\r\n  111-15, 502 S.E.2d at 88-91).&nbsp; â€œ[T]he award of attorneyâ€™s fees is\r\n  not part of the punishment; instead, this award is made to indemnify the party\r\n  for expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of the court's order.â€&nbsp; Id. at 77, 615 S.E. 2d at 476 (quoting \r\n\tPoston, 33 S.C. at 111-15, 502 S.E.2d\r\n  at 88-91).\r\n\r\n[5] Because the\r\n  reasonableness of attorneyâ€™s fees is not at issue here, we do not consider the\r\n  factors enunciated in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\n[6] Although we\r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s ruling that Father may not take a credit for his\r\n  summer 2005 childcare expenses, we believe the language in the Decree\r\n  addressing this issue is ambiguous, and the issue of future childcare expenses ultimately\r\n  may be resolved in either Fatherâ€™s or Motherâ€™s favor.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4362","title":"State v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4362\r\nHeard February 5, 2008 â€“ Filed March 20,\r\n  2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn G. Reckenbeil, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Blair\r\n  Adams appeals the circuit courtâ€™s failure to grant his motion to suppress\r\n  evidence.Â  Adams maintains the purpose of the initial traffic stop had been\r\n  fulfilled, and police had no reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or Adamsâ€™ consent to continue the stop.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPolice Officer Bradford James pulled Adams\r\n  over during the officerâ€™s patrol of the Park Hills area of Spartanburg.Â  James noticed\r\n  Adamsâ€™ vehicle make a left turn without first signaling, and thereafter James pulled\r\n  the vehicle over.Â  James approached the vehicle and asked Adams to produce his\r\n  driverâ€™s license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance.Â  James\r\n  testified Adams was visibly nervous and unsure during the encounter, and\r\n  stuttered slightly when answering his questions.Â  James also noticed the\r\n  vehicle had numerous air fresheners hanging from his rearview mirror, and there\r\n  was a box filled with plastic bags in the passenger-side floorboard.[1]Â   \r\nBecause of the nervousness displayed by Adams, as well as the\r\n  potential existence of narcotics, and the safety concerns of James standing\r\n  partially in the roadway, James asked Adams to exit and accompany him to the\r\n  rear of the vehicle while he conducted the registration check. Â This check\r\n  revealed Adams was not the registered owner of the vehicle, and that Adamsâ€™ driving license had previously been suspended as a result of a drug conviction.Â  During\r\n  this police dispatch check, a second officer, William Reese came on the scene.Â  \r\n \r\nWhile in the presence of Reese, James asked Adams for permission\r\n  to search his vehicle.Â  Conflicting testimony exists as to whether Adams granted James permission to search his vehicle.Â  James testified Adams initially did\r\n  not understand his rights, and that he asked James whether he could say no to\r\n  the request.Â  Reese testified he arrived during this conversation and told Adams â€œyou do not have to give consent if you donâ€™t want to.â€Â  Thereafter, both James and\r\n  Reese testified Adams gave consent to search the vehicle.Â  Adams meanwhile,\r\n  testifying only to the issue of consent, maintained he never granted the\r\n  officers permission to search his vehicle, and after he attempted to leave, the\r\n  officers searched his vehicle without his consent to do so.\r\nAccording to both officers, Reese remained with Adams at the rear\r\n  of the vehicle while James conducted the search.Â  An initial inspection\r\n  revealed a quantity of white powder in the center console.Â  James field-tested\r\n  the powder, revealing a positive indication for cocaine.Â  Adams was then placed\r\n  under arrest.Â  A subsequent search incident to the arrest revealed an\r\n  additional 11.75 grams of powder that field-testing indicated was cocaine, as\r\n  well as a set of digital scales.Â  Â Â \r\nA grand jury indicted Adams for trafficking in cocaine.Â  During\r\n  the ensuing bench trial, Adams made a motion to suppress the evidence found in Adamsâ€™ vehicle as a product of an illegal search, which was denied.Â  Subsequently, a bench\r\n  trial was held, and the circuit court found Adams guilty of trafficking cocaine,\r\n  and sentenced him to twenty-five years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed. Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the circuit court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\n  the circuit court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error\r\n  of law. Â State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467\r\n  (2000).\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court only reviews\r\n  errors of law.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498,\r\n  500&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (citing State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545\r\n  S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)).Â  We are bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings\r\n  unless we find that they are clearly erroneous.Â  This standard of review also applies\r\n  to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain\r\n  evidence in criminal cases.Â  Id.Â  We are limited in our review of Fourth\r\n  Amendment search and seizure cases to determining whether there is any evidence\r\n  to support the circuit courtâ€™s finding.Â  State v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485,\r\n  501, 623 S.E.2d 378, 386&nbsp;(2005).Â  An appellate court will reverse only when\r\n  clear error exists.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAdams maintains the purpose of the initial\r\n  traffic stop had been fulfilled, and police had no reasonable suspicion,\r\n  probable cause, or Adamsâ€™ consent to continue the stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note\r\n  Adams does not appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order finding James had probable\r\n  cause to initiate a traffic stop based on his observation of Adams making a\r\n  turn without an appropriate turn signal.Â  Where probable cause exists to\r\n  believe that a traffic violation has occurred, the decision to stop the\r\n  automobile is reasonable per se. Â Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810 (1996).Â  When a vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, a\r\n  police officer may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating\r\n  the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 111 (1977).Â  In carrying out the stop,\r\n  an officer â€œ â€˜may request a driverâ€™s license and vehicle registration, run a\r\n  computer check, and issue a citation.â€™ â€ United States v. Sullivan,\r\n  138 F.3d 126, 131 (4th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). Â However, â€œ[a]ny further detention\r\n  for questioning is beyond the scope of the [] stop and therefore illegal unless\r\n  the officer has a reasonable suspicion of a serious crime.â€ Â Id.Â  \r\n \r\nOur inquiry then\r\n  requires an analysis of whether James detained or seized Adams anew, thereby\r\n  triggering the Fourth Amendment and potentially rendering any subsequent\r\n  consent to a search of his vehicle invalid, or if the encounter turned into a\r\n  consensual one invoking no constitutional scrutiny.Â  See State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 599, 571 S.E.2d 703, 707-08 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  James\r\n  testified the entire encounter from the initial detention to the arrest of Adams took no longer than ten minutes.Â  Additionally, James testified he requested Adamsâ€™ consent to search his vehicle within thirty seconds of receiving the return call on\r\n  the vehicle registration check.Â  This request was made before James had\r\n  returned to his cruiser to fill out the necessary paperwork to issue Adams a citation.Â  As stated above, Reese arrived on the scene at approximately the same\r\n  time, and both officers testified Adamsâ€™ consent to search the vehicle was\r\n  given a short time later.Â  Therefore, we find Adamsâ€™ disputed consent was given\r\n  within the initial parameters of the lawful detention.\r\nâ€œWarrantless\r\n  searches and seizures are reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\r\n  when conducted under the authority of voluntary consent.â€ Â Palacio\r\n    v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 514, 511 S.E.2d 62, 66 (1999). â€œUndoubtedly, a law\r\n  enforcement officer may request permission to search at any time. However, when\r\n  an officer asks for consent to search after an unconstitutional detention, the consent\r\n  procured is per se invalid unless it is both voluntary and not an exploitation\r\n  of the unlawful detention.â€ State v.

McGraw, Jr.Â  McGrawâ€™s vehicle\r\n  collided with Lewis Lesesne Scottâ€™s vehicle, and Tracy was killed in the\r\n  accident.Â  Tracy had no automobile insurance at the time of his death.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the time of Tracyâ€™s death, Ernest owned and paid taxes on the Spartanburg County home.Â  He did not maintain insurance on that home.Â  The Smiths insured their\r\n  automobiles through Auto-Owners Insurance Company (Auto-Owners).Â  The\r\n  automobile insurance policy listed the Laurens County home as the Smithsâ€™\r\n  residence.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  the accident, Scott sued McGraw.Â  Tracyâ€™s son, Brandon Smith, intervened on\r\n  behalf of the Estate and subsequently joined Auto-Owners as a defendant.Â  Scott\r\n  and McGraw settled with each other and with the Estate and are not parties to\r\n  this appeal.Â  The Estate and Auto-Owners submitted the issue of â€œwhether Tracy\r\n  Smith qualifies as an insured under Ernest and Brenda Smithâ€™s underinsured\r\n  motorist coverageâ€ to the trial court for determination.Â  In an order dated\r\n  September 28, 2006, the circuit court ruled Tracy Smith was not an insured\r\n  party under his parentsâ€™ policy.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law.Â  Nationwide\r\n    Mut. Ins.Co. v. Prioleau, 359 S.C. 238, 241, 597 S.E.2d 165, 167 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004); see also Kizer v. Kinard, 361 S.C. 68, 71, 602 S.E.2d 783,\r\n  785 (Ct. App. 2004) (determination of whether underinsured motorist coverage\r\n  applies is an action at law).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the\r\n  appellate courtâ€™s standard of review extends only to the correction of errors\r\n  of law. &nbsp;Pope v. Gordon, 369 S.C. 469, 474, 633 S.E.2d 148, 151 (2006).&nbsp; We\r\n  will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless those findings are\r\n  â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous conception or\r\n  application of the law.â€ &nbsp;Gordon v. Colonial Ins.\r\n    Co. of Cal., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe\r\n  determination of resident relative status is a question of fact, and thus, we\r\n  will not disturb the circuit courtâ€™s ruling if the record contains any evidence\r\n  supporting it. Â Id. at 155, 536 S.E.2d at 378.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEstate\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in ruling that Tracy Smith was not an insured\r\n  resident of his parentsâ€™ household.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, the definition of â€œinsuredâ€ includes â€œrelativesâ€ of the named\r\n  insured and his or her spouse, as long as those relatives are â€œresident[s] of\r\n  the same household.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) (2002).Â  In this case, no party\r\n  disputes that Tracy was a relative of the Smiths.Â  A determination of whether Tracy qualified as an insured under his parentsâ€™ policy necessarily requires an examination\r\n  and a comparison of where Tracy and each of the named insureds resided.Â  The\r\n  circuit court engaged in factfinding concerning Ernest and Tracyâ€™s presence at both\r\n  the Spartanburg County and Laurens County homes and ruled Tracy did not reside\r\n  in the same household as the Smiths.Â  Therefore, because neither party disputed\r\n  Tracy lived at the Spartanburg County home, the circuit courtâ€™s order implicitly\r\n  ruled that Ernest resided in the Laurens County household.Â   \r\nSection\r\n  38-77-30(7) of the South Carolina Code defines â€œinsuredâ€ to include both the\r\n  insured person or persons named in a policy and â€œwhile\r\n  resident of the same household, the spouse of any named insured and relatives\r\n  of either.â€Â  No statute provides guidance concerning whether an insured may\r\n  maintain more than one household simultaneously.Â  Although the courts have\r\n  contemplated the meaning of â€œresident relativeâ€ on numerous occasions,[2] the issue of whether an insured may\r\n  reside in multiple households simultaneously is one of first impression.Â  Our\r\n  task here is limited to determining whether facts in the record supported the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s finding the Smiths and Tracy did not reside in the same\r\n  household.Â  Consequently, we do not reach the issue of whether an insured may\r\n  reside in multiple households.\r\nThe circuit court found the evidence conclusively established Tracy\r\n  and his parents resided in two separate households in May 2004.Â  To reach this\r\n  conclusion, the circuit court necessarily undertook a two-prong analysis.Â \r\n  First, the circuit court determined where each of the Smiths resided.Â  The\r\n  record reflects that in May 2004, Tracyâ€™s only residence was the Spartanburg   County home.Â  Tracy occasionally visited his parents at the Laurens County home but did not live there.Â  In May 2004, Brendaâ€™s only residence was the Laurens County home.Â  In May 2004, Ernest lived at the Laurens County home with Brenda,\r\n  having moved there from the Spartanburg County home when he retired in March of\r\n  2003.Â  However, Brenda testified that Ernest kept clothes, toiletries, and\r\n  other items at the Spartanburg County home for his personal use when he stayed\r\n  there following his retirement.Â  Ernest maintained duplicate items at the Laurens County home.Â  \r\n \r\nThe conflict in this matter revolves around the time Ernest spent\r\n  at the Spartanburg County home, the time Ernest resided in the Laurens County home, and his intention with respect to these homes and his son.Â  Because\r\n  the record supports the assertions that Ernest resided in both homes, the\r\n  circuit court was required to proceed to the second prong of its analysis.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the second prong of the analysis, the circuit court applied the Buddin standard of â€œone, other than a temporary or transient visitor,\r\n  who lives together with others in the same house for a period of some duration,\r\n  although he may not intend to remain there permanently.â€Â  250 S.C. at 339, 157\r\n  S.E.2d at 636.Â  We note that in 1996, our supreme court adopted a similar but\r\n  somewhat more stringent approach to determining residency.Â  State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Breazell, 324 S.C. 228, 478 S.E.2d 831 (1996).Â  Under the Waite test enunciated in Breazell,\r\n  a person resides in a household with another if he or she:\r\n\r\n\t1) liv[es] under the same roof; 2) in a close, intimate, and\r\n  informal relationship, and 3) where the intended duration of the relationship\r\n  is likely to be substantial, where it is consistent with the informality of the\r\n  relationship and from which it is reasonable to conclude that the parties would\r\n  consider the relationship in contracting about such matters as insurance or in\r\n  their conduct in reliance thereon.\r\n\r\nBreazell, 324 S.C. at 231, 478 S.E.2d at 832 (citing A.G. by Waite v. Travelers Ins. Co., 331 N.W.2d 643 (Wis. Ct. App.\r\n  1983)).Â   \r\nIn applying the Waite test to Ernestâ€™s two possible\r\n  households, we agree with the circuit court that Ernest was a resident of the Laurens County home and was a temporary, transient visitor to the Spartanburg County home.Â  Waite requires residents to â€œliv[e] under the same roof . . . in a close,\r\n  intimate, and informal relationshipâ€ that anticipates both a substantial length\r\n  and some durability.Â  Id.Â  Brenda and Ernest lived in the Laurens County home together as husband and wife, thus satisfying the first two factors.Â \r\n  Ernest considered his home to be with Brenda at the Laurens County home.Â  His purpose in leaving that home was to work, and he returned there when not\r\n  working.Â  Ernest and Brendaâ€™s living arrangements in the Laurens County home also satisfied the third factor, that the relationship be lengthy and durable.Â \r\n  Using the Laurens County address, Ernest and Brenda purchased homeowners and\r\n  automobile insurance, filed joint tax returns, received mail, and paid bills.Â \r\n  These acts clearly satisfy the final factor, confirming Ernestâ€™s residency at\r\n  the Laurens County home under Waite.Â   \r\nBy contrast, Ernestâ€™s presence at the Spartanburg County home does not appear to satisfy all of the Waite factors for residency.Â  Ernest\r\n  and Tracy did indeed live together, at least for part of each week.Â  Ernestâ€™s\r\n  work schedule necessitated his visits to Spartanburg County.Â  Depending upon\r\n  his employerâ€™s needs, he would be in Spartanburg between two and four days per\r\n  week.Â  With regard to the second Waite factor, Ernest and Tracy appear\r\n  to have enjoyed a â€œclose, intimate, and informal relationship,â€ given that they\r\n  were father and son and the record does not indicate that their living\r\n  arrangement included any restrictions or formal division of household\r\n  responsibilities.Â  However, this relationship fails to satisfy the third\r\n  factor.Â  No evidence in the record indicates Ernest and Tracy intended their\r\n  living arrangement to be substantially long or durable or that they treated\r\n  their living arrangement as anything but a matter of temporary convenience.Â \r\n  Ernest and Tracy did not insure their automobiles together or share the\r\n  responsibilities of taxes or household bills.Â  Ernest did not insure the Spartanburg   County home at all.Â  Although Ernest may have spent up to four nights per\r\n  week in the Spartanburg County home, it appears he stayed there merely as a matter\r\n  of convenience and in lieu of renting a hotel room.Â   \r\nTherefore, the circuit court did not err in finding Ernest had\r\n  only one household in Laurens County that he shared with his wife.Â  His use of\r\n  the Spartanburg County home did not constitute maintenance of a second\r\n  household, and Tracy did not qualify as an insured under his parentsâ€™\r\n  automobile insurance coverage.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not err in finding Tracy did not qualify as an insured under\r\n  his parentsâ€™ automobile insurance coverage.Â  The record indicates Tracy lived in Spartanburg County and his parents lived in Laurens County.Â  Further, Ernestâ€™s\r\n  occasional visits to the Spartanburg County home did not constitute\r\n  establishment of a household with Tracy.Â  Therefore, Tracy was not an insured\r\n  under his parentsâ€™ policy.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.Â   \r\n[2] See, e.g., Buddin v.
