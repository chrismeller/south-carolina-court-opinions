Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4227\r\nHeard March 6, 2007 â€“ Filed April 2, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDuke K. McCall, Jr., Rebecca H. Zabel and Zandra Johnson, all of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\nBelinda Ellison, of Lexington and James B. Richardson, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, Cally R. Forrest, Jr. sustained injuries from a work-related accident while employed by Appellant A.S. Price Mechanical.[1]Â  Appellant concedes that Forrest is entitled to lifetime medical and workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Appellant assigns error to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s computation of Forrestâ€™s compensation, the finding that Forrest has reached maximum medical improvement (MMI), and the admission of Forrestâ€™s vocational expertâ€™s report.Â  We affirm.\r\nI.\r\nWith the exception of four semesters spent at Clemson University, Forrest was employed full-time since graduating from high school in 1995, usually working multiple jobs.[2]Â  As a high school student, Forrest worked regularly, including seasonal, full-time work with Monetta Peach Packers.Â  He continued seasonal employment with Monetta Peach Packers until his injury on May 26, 2001.Â  During the remaining months of the year, Forrest worked for several employers, including Appellant A.S. Price Mechanical, Priceâ€™s Metal Shop, Gibson Construction Company, and J.E. Oswalt &amp; Sons (â€œOswaltâ€).Â  \r\nAfter leaving Clemson in December of 1998, Forrest began working full-time for Larry Price at Priceâ€™s Metal Shop.[3]Â  Forrest also worked for Appellant on the weekends.Â  In the fall of 1999, Forrestâ€™s job with Appellant changed from part-time to full-time, and he began working for Larry Price only part-time.Â  When work with Appellant was slow, Forrest would work for Gibson Construction Company.Â  Eventually, his job with Gibson Construction Company became full-time, and he worked for Appellant only part-time.Â  By the start of the 2000 peach season, the specific construction Forrest was working on was completed with Gibson Construction Company, and Forrest once again began his seasonal work with Monetta Peach Packers.Â  \r\nAt the end of the peach season in 2000, Forrest began working full-time for Oswalt and part-time with Appellant.Â  When the peach season began in 2001, he left his job at Oswalt and went back to Monetta Peach Packers.Â  Forrest testified he intended to go back to work for Oswalt at the end of the 2001 peach season.Â  He further noted that the owner of Oswalt and one of the owners of Monetta Peach Packers were friends and knew of his intentions.Â Â  \r\nForrest was injured during the 2001 peach season when he fell from a roof while working part-time for Appellant.Â  Forrest was twenty-four years old at the time of the accident.Â  The injuries rendered him a paraplegic.\r\nAppellant agreed to pay Forrest workersâ€™ compensation at a rate of $490.00.Â  This amount reflected Forrestâ€™s combined wages from Appellant and Monetta Peach Packers.Â Â  \r\nThe single commissioner subsequently adjusted the compensation rate to $532.72.Â  This compensation rate represented Forrestâ€™s average weekly wage from January 1, 2001 to May 26, 2001, while working for Appellant, Monetta Peach Packers, and Oswalt.Â  The Commission adopted the order of the single commissioner.Â  The circuit court held the Commissionâ€™s findings were supported by substantial evidence and affirmed.\r\nII.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  This court reviews facts based on the substantial evidence standard.Â  Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 877 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Under the substantial evidence standard, the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006).Â  The appellate court may reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nIII.\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s computation of Forrestâ€™s average weekly wage of $532.72.Â  First, Appellant asserts that the doctrines of estoppel and laches preclude Forrest from asserting a different wage than the parties agreed upon.Â  Next, Appellant objects to the inclusion of Oswalt as an employer in the rate computation, and maintains that Forrest was not employed with Oswalt at the time of his injury.Â  Appellant contends any wages earned as a result of his previous employment with Oswalt are irrelevant per section 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  Finally, Appellant argues there are no exceptional circumstances justifying an adjustment or computation of Forrestâ€™s average weekly wage in a method other than that employed originally.\r\nAt the outset we hold that the doctrines of estoppel and laches do not preclude the Commission from adjusting the average weekly wage prior to the administrative bodyâ€™s final determination.Â  Appellantâ€™s argument stems from the fact that Forrestâ€™s initial compensation rate was $300 per week until he requested that this rate be increased to include wages earned from Monetta Peach Packers.Â  Appellant states it agreed to the new calculation ($490 per week) and filed a new Form 15 with the Commission in exchange for Forrest agreeing to withdraw his request for a hearing.Â  Forrest filed a new Form 19 with the Commission confirming his acceptance of the rate, and Appellant maintains it relied to its detriment on Forrestâ€™s promise of acceptance.Â  \r\nThe circuit court correctly held that neither a Form 15 nor a Form 19 is a final judgment.Â  Section 42-17-10 of the South Carolina Code (1985) allows the Commission to adjust a claimantâ€™s compensation rate after the filing of the claim, even when the parties agree to the preliminary compensation rate.Â  Section 42-17-10 provides: â€œAll such agreements [between the claimant and employer as to rate of compensation] shall be subject to adjustment and correction as to the compensable rate if subsequent to filing with the Commission it is determined that such rate does not reflect the correct average weekly wage of the claimant.â€Â  Moreover, Appellant has failed to establish any detrimental reliance. \r\nOn the merits, we disagree with Appellantâ€™s contention that the Commission erred in including Oswalt as an employer in Forrestâ€™s average weekly wage computation. Section 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) defines â€œaverage weekly wageâ€ for the purposes of computing compensation and sets forth four different methods of calculation.[4]Â  The methods for calculating average weekly wage explained in section 42-1-40 have been interpreted by our courts to implement the â€œusualâ€ job situation with one employer.Â  See Foreman v. Jackson Minit Markets, Inc.\r\n  265 S.C. 164, 167, 217 S.E.2d 214, 215 (1975) (summarizing the four different methods of calculating average weekly wage in the predecessor to section 42-1-40).Â  However, section 42-1-40 further provides that when exceptional reasons make one of the standard approaches unfair to either the employer or employee, â€œsuch other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.â€Â  We note that exceptional circumstances have been found where an employee has multiple employers at the same time.Â  See, e.g. Brunson v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 344 S.C. 107, 111, 542 S.E.2d 732, 734 (Ct. App. 2001) (listing several cases where multiple employment has been sufficient to justify exceptional circumstances).\r\nAppellant argues section 42-1-40 requires that the wage being earned at the time of the injury be the wage that controls the compensation rate.Â  On the date of the injury, Appellant correctly points out that Forrest only worked for Appellant and Monetta Peach Packers.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Commission found that the following â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€ justified deviation from the usual statutory method of average weekly wage computation: (1) Forrestâ€™s young age of twenty-four years at the time of injury;[5] (2) Forrestâ€™s demonstration of the interest, aptitude, ability, work ethic, and work history to be both a welder or maintenance worker and an employee who had worked year-round with multiple employers; (3) the fact that Forrest worked for Monetta Peach Packers during the peach season for several months each year since he was fifteen and had worked for two or three additional employers to complete his annual earnings and year-round employment; (4) the severity of Forrestâ€™s injury; and (5) the fact that Appellant knew that Forrest regularly worked full-time and part-time for multiple employers.Â  \r\nThe circuit court did not err in affirming the Commission.[6]Â  The Commission acted within its broad discretion in determining that exceptional circumstances existed.Â  In finding exceptional circumstances in other cases, this court has reasoned that â€œ[section 42-1-40] provides an elasticity or flexibility with a view toward always achieving the ultimate objective of reflecting fairly a claimantâ€™s probable future earning loss.â€Â  Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 698 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œMoreover, it is well established that the objective of wage calculation is to arrive at a fair approximation of the claimantâ€™s probable future earning capacity.â€Â  Elliott v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 362 S.C. 234, 238, 607 S.E.2d 90, 92 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œDisability reaches into the future, not the past; loss as a result of the injury must be thought of in terms of its impact on probable future earnings.â€Â  Id. (citing Bennett v. Gary Smith Builders, 271 S.C. 94, 98-99, 245 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1978)).Â  \r\nForrestâ€™s work history demonstrates a laudable, strong work ethic.Â  There is no reason to second-guess the Commissionâ€™s finding that, were it not for his injury and subsequent paraplegia, Forrest would be working full-time and part-time, year-round for several different employers because of his commitment to seasonal employment with Monetta Peach Packers.Â  To arrive at a fair average weekly wage in this case, it was reasonable for the Commission to examine Forrestâ€™s actual work history.Â  The Commission looked to the period from January 1, 2001 until the date of Forrestâ€™s injury on May 26, 2001â€”a twenty-one-week period.Â  This time period reflected Forrestâ€™s true earnings and thus a fair estimation of his future earning capacity.Â  The rate of compensation determined by the Commission is consonant with the statutory scheme, as well as a fair rate to both Forrest and Appellant.Â  \r\nAppellant attempts to distinguish this case from Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 564 S.E.2d 694 (Ct. App. 2002), a case relied upon by the Commission.Â  This case is not distinguishable in any meaningful way that Appellant urges.Â  In Sellers, a case where exceptional circumstances were found to exist, a sixteen-year-old became a paraplegic as a result of a job injury.Â  350 S.C. at 186, 564 S.E.2d at 696.Â  The Commission noted the similarity between the two claimants (Sellers and Forrest) in that they were both of a young age and regularly worked three jobs.Â  Appellant contends in Sellers the claimant demonstrated that he planned to become a master electrician, which warranted the Commission increasing his compensation rate to that of an electrician.Â  Unlike the claimant in Sellers, Appellant argues Forrest has made no such showing.Â  Appellant contends Forrest â€œhas voluntarily assumed a pattern of work that is somewhat unconventional[.]â€Â  By conceding Forrestâ€™s â€œpattern of work,â€ Appellant in effect lends support to the Commissionâ€™s reliance on Forrestâ€™s true work history.Â  This reliance on Forrestâ€™s demonstrated work history supports the Commissionâ€™s finding of exceptional circumstances.Â  If anything, Forrest presents a stronger case for a finding of exceptional circumstances than Sellers did.\r\nAs for the argument that Forrestâ€™s testimony about intending to return to work for Oswalt is too speculative to determine future earnings, we find substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  Forrestâ€™s future work plans, interrupted by his injury, may be reasonably gauged by his work history. \r\nPerhaps Forrestâ€™s strong work ethic is â€œunconventional,â€ but that is no reason to discount his actual work history and earnings.Â  The law mandates the Commission evaluate each case (including a claimantâ€™s average weekly wage) in accordance with its particular facts.Â  The quest here is one for truth in light of the particular case, not by resort to an employerâ€™s idea of what is â€œconventionalâ€ that can be advanced when an employer is up against a claimant with a solid work ethic and a demonstrable pattern of consistent work and earnings.Â  Substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s determination of Forrestâ€™s average weekly wage.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nAs for Appellantâ€™s remaining assignments of error, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities: Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 224, 628 S.E.2d 262, 268 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting that MMI is a factual determination left to the discretion of the Commission); Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 580-81, 514 S.E.2d 593, 596 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding MMI â€œindicate[s] that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment[,]â€ while disability is the â€œincapacity because of an injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employmentâ€); Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (noting the qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony are matters within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion); Peterson v. Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005) (â€œDefects in an expert witnessâ€™ education and experience go to the weight, not the admissibility, of the expertâ€™s testimony.â€); Gadson, 368 S.C. at 229, 628 S.E.2d at 270 (finding that the Commission acted within its discretion in allowing a certified rehabilitation counselor with a masterâ€™s degree to render an opinion on employability).Â  \r\nV.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the order of the circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The employerâ€™s carrier, Oâ€™Steen Adjusting Services, is also an appellant.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; Forrest testified that although he received a scholarship to attend Clemson, he left after two years because he wanted to work full-time and get married.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Larry Price is Forrestâ€™s father-in-law and Allen Priceâ€™s uncle.Â  Allen Price is the owner of Appellant A.S. Price Mechanical.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Section 42-1-40 provides as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œAverage weekly wagesâ€ means the earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury . . . .Â  â€œAverage weekly wageâ€ must be calculated by taking the total wages paid for the last four quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the injury occurred . . . divided by fifty-two or by the actual number of weeks for which wages were paid, whichever is less.Â  When the employment, prior to the injury, extended over a period of less than fifty-two weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed, as long as results fair and just to both parties will be obtained.Â  Where, by reason of a shortness of time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or the casual nature or terms of his employment, it is impracticable to compute the average weekly wages as defined in this section, regard is to be had to the average weekly amount which during the fifty-two weeks previous to the injury was being earned by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; The Commissionâ€™s order states Forrest was twenty-three at the time of injury.Â  Forrestâ€™s testimony and birth date (May 22, 1977) show, however, that Forrest turned twenty-four four days prior to his accident.\r\n[6]&nbsp; We recognize the difficulty with the factor concerning the severity of a claimantâ€™s injury and the implication of a sliding scale relationship between injury and determination of average weekly wage.Â  But see Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 699 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding the extent of Sellersâ€™ injury was a factor warranting a ruling of exceptional circumstances).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4228","title":"Abercrombie v.

Rucker, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4228\r\nHeard March 7, 2007 â€“ Filed April 2, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRodney M. Brown, of Fountain Inn, for Appellant.\r\nJim S. Brooks, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this domestic action, Keith Abercrombie (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s (1) valuation and equitable division of marital property, (2) award of alimony to Sherrie Lynn Abercrombie (Wife), and (3) decision to retain a portion of the equitable distribution awarded to Husband to clean hazardous waste materials he left on the marital property.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married in December 1974.Â  The parties separated in 2003, and Wife sought a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  The family court granted Wife the divorce based on Husbandâ€™s infidelity, granted Wife custody of the children, awarded Wife child support, made a fifty-fifty equitable distribution of the marital estate, awarded Wife alimony, and retained a portion of Husbandâ€™s equitable distribution to clean hazardous waste from the marital property.[1]Â  \r\nAfter the hearing, the family court found the marital property of the parties consisted of the marital home, a small rental property, a mobile home, forty-six acres of property, a daycare business and accompanying real estate, and the proceeds of a sale of additional rental property.Â  The family court valued the assets as follows: the marital home, mobile home, and forty-six acres at $300,000; the rental property at $20,000; the daycare business and property at $200,000; and the proceeds from the sale of rental property at $31,965.39.Â  The real estate of the parties was found to be encumbered by a mortgage of $418,000.Â  Thus, the total value of the marital estate was found to be $133,965.39.Â  The family court then divided the marital property equally between Husband and Wife with each receiving a distribution equaling $66,982.70.[2]Â  \r\nWife received the marital real estate and daycare business, along with the $418,000 mortgage.Â  The family court, however, reduced Husbandâ€™s share of the marital property by $48,453.47, which accounted for an $18,000 child support arrearage and $30,453.47 in delinquent taxes Husband owed Greenville County.Â  After these offsets, Husbandâ€™s equitable distribution was reduced to $18,529.23, which the family court ordered be placed in escrow to be used for the removal of hazardous waste left on the property by Husband.Â  No post trial motions were filed.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 615 S.E.2d 98 (2005).Â  In spite of this broad scope of review, we remain mindful that the family court judge saw and heard the witnesses and generally is in a better position to determine credibility.Â  Id. Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in valuing the marital property.Â  Specifically, he argues section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) applies to valuation of marital property, and because the family court did not use the fifteen factors to value the property, the court erred in valuing the marital home, forty-six acres, and the daycare.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 20-7-472 provides in part:\r\n  \r\nIn a proceeding for divorce a vinculo matrimonii or separate support and maintenance . . . and in other marital litigation between the parties, the court shall make a final equitable apportionment between the parties of the partiesâ€™ marital property upon request by either party in the pleadings.Â  In making apportionment, the court must give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  It is evident from the language of section 20-7-472 itself that the factors apply to the apportionment of marital property not the valuation of the property.Â  Furthermore, in Husbandâ€™s brief he does not cite any authority for his proposition that this section applies to valuation of marital property.\r\nIn making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must identify real and personal\r\nmarital property and determine the propertyâ€™s fair market value. Â Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œIn the absence of contrary evidence, the court should accept the\r\nvalue the parties assign to a marital asset.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, in South Carolina, a property owner is competent to offer testimony as to the value of his property.Â  Cooper v. Cooper, 289 S.C. 377, 379, 346 S.E.2d 326, 327 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  â€œA family court may accept the valuation of one party over another, and the courtâ€™s valuation of\r\nmarital property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented.â€ Â Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nIn this matter, Wife specifically testified, as she was qualified to do as owner of the property, that the marital home and forty-six acres had a value of $300,000, and the daycare had a value of $200,000.Â  While Husband provided other values for the business, the value accepted by the family court was within the range presented at trial.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in valuing the marital property.\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred in effecting the equitable distribution.[3]Â  He claims his portion of the award should have totaled â€œat the minimum a distribution in kind or proceeds after a sale of $400,000.â€Â  Specifically, he contends the family court erred in the division because it improperly valued the marital assets and offset his equitable distribution share by the $18,000 outstanding child support, the $31,965.39 in unpaid taxes, and the $18,529.23 to remove the hazardous waste from the property.Â  However, we note that Husband never raised the issue of the offset of child support, unpaid taxes, or the cleaning fee to the family court by way of a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.)Â  Â Â Â \r\nLastly, Husband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife alimony.Â  Husband essentially argues there was no factual basis to support an award of alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Â Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  â€œIt is the duty of the family court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well founded.â€ Â Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family court is required to consider all relevant factors in determining alimony. Â Patel v.

App. 1994).\r\nThe record reflects that the family court considered the relevant statutory factors in awarding alimony to Wife.Â  In making the award of alimony to Wife, the family court properly considered the income levels of the parties, the duration of the marriage, the fault of Husband, the standard of living established during the marriage, and the financial ability of Husband to pay support.Â  At the hearing, Wife specifically testified to Husbandâ€™s income, his marital misconduct, the length of the marriage, and the standard of living the parties enjoyed during the marriage.[4]Â  Therefore, the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding alimony to Wife.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the family court is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â The parties had three children, only one of which was a minor at the time of the divorce.Â  Neither custody nor child support is at issue in this appeal.\r\n[2] Â Husband was not present at the hearing but was represented by counsel.Â  \r\n[3] Â Husband agrees the fifty-fifty split is proper.Â  He merely challenges the impact the offsets had on his portion of the distribution.\r\n[4] Â Husband presented no evidence to counter Wifeâ€™s testimony regarding these issues.Â  In fact, Husband failed to even file a financial declaration with the family court as required by the family court rules.Â  Therefore, he cannot now complain that the family court improperly relied on Wifeâ€™s testimony in awarding alimony.Â  See, e.g., Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C. 344, 347, 440 S.E.2d 387, 390 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating the appellant has the burden â€œto show the family court committed reversible error and a\r\nparty cannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to the appellate court complaining of the insufficiency of\r\nevidence to support the family courtâ€™s findingsâ€).

Jamison appeals his convictions for trafficking cocaine, trafficking crack cocaine, resisting arrest, failure to stop for a blue light, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the night of January 6, 2004, the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Office dispatched Deputy Andrew Wall to investigate a suspicious vehicle parked in the middle of a dead-end road located in a cul-de-sac.Â  He found the vehicle, a Chevrolet pickup truck, parked without any lights on. Â Wall shone his patrol vehicleâ€™s exterior spotlight into the truck as he was driving by, did not see anyone inside, and believed the truck was abandoned.Â  He positioned his patrol car behind the truck and called in the truckâ€™s license plate to his dispatcher.\r\nWhile waiting for the dispatcher to respond, Wall saw an individual, later identified as Jamison, suddenly sit up in the driverâ€™s seat of the truck.Â  Jamison immediately put the truck into motion and began driving away.Â  Wall turned on his blue lights and pursued the truck.Â  The truck stopped several times during the chase, but never long enough for Wall to approach the truck on foot.Â  Wall radioed for backup; Deputy John Little and Deputy Tasha Cox quickly joined the pursuit.\r\nOnce the truck stopped long enough for the deputies to approach, Wall and Cox advanced toward the vehicle on foot.Â  Wall ordered Jamison to exit the vehicle and he slowly complied.Â  The deputies searched Jamison and placed him into one of the patrol vehicles.Â  Upon searching Jamisonâ€™s truck, the deputies discovered a loaded .45 caliber pistol and a bag from a fast-food restaurant containing four, clear plastic bags with drugs inside.Â  Two of the four bags contained cocaine and the other two contained crack cocaine.Â  Altogether the bags contained 54.77 grams of cocaine and 19.21 grams of crack cocaine.\r\nThe Greenville County Grand Jury indicted Jamison for trafficking cocaine, trafficking crack cocaine, resisting arrest, failure to stop for a blue light, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  A jury found Jamison guilty on all charges and the trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of confinement totaling ten years plus three years probation.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJamison argues the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to present expert testimony about the dollar value of cocaine and crack cocaine.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe qualification of a witness as an expert and the admissibility of his or her testimony are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion and prejudice to the opposing party.Â  Nelson v. Taylor, 347 S.C. 210, 214, 553 S.E.2d 488, 490 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).\r\nDuring Jamisonâ€™s trial, the State sought to call Investigator Keith Grounsell of the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Office as an expert on the street value of cocaine and crack cocaine.Â  Jamison objected, arguing testimony about the value of cocaine and crack cocaine was irrelevant and prejudicial because there was no evidence he committed or attempted a drug transaction.Â  The trial court allowed Grounsell to testify as an expert, but limited his testimony to the â€œwholesaleâ€ and â€œretailâ€ values of cocaine and crack cocaine for the general area.\r\nThe trial court allowed Grounsellâ€™s testimony based on several cases from the United States Court of Appeals,\r\nFourth Circuit.Â  The trial court reasoned that jurors typically do not have knowledge about the illegal drug industry.[2]Â  Grounsell testified that the drugs found in Jamisonâ€™s truck had a street value of between $2,750.00 and $9,319.00, depending on the quantities sold.\r\nIn his defense, Jamison claimed the drugs belonged to someone else, possibly one of his employees who also had access to the truck.\r\nWe agree with the trial court that jurors typically do not know the current street prices of illegal drugs.Â  Grounsellâ€™s valuation of the drugs, based on his years of law enforcement experience, allowed the jury to better determine whether a person would reasonably leave expensive narcotics unguarded and disguised as trash in a truck allegedly used by numerous people.\r\nIf the jury did not believe Jamisonâ€™s assertion that an unknown individual left thousands of dollars worth of drugs disguised as garbage in an area where other people had access to the drugs and might even throw them away, it reinforced the Stateâ€™s case that Jamison was knowingly in actual or constructive possession of the drugs at the time of his arrest, a key element of the trafficking charges.Â  We therefore hold the trial court did not err by allowing Grounsell to testify about the street value of the drugs found in Jamisonâ€™s truck.[3]\r\n\r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  See, e.g., U.S. v. Gastiaburo, 16 F.3d 582, 589 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting the court has â€œrepeatedly upheld the admission of law enforcement officersâ€™ expert opinion testimony in drug trafficking cases.â€); U.S. v. Johnson, 54 F.3d 1150, 1156-57 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding the district court did not err in qualifying a detective as an expert and allowing the detective to testify about the current street price of illegal drugs).\r\n[3]Â  See State v. Matthews, 720 So. 2d 153 (La. Ct. App. 1998) (holding an agent from the Drug Enforcement Agency could testify regarding the street value of cocaine where the agent was testifying regarding matters within his personal knowledge and experience as a narcotics officer); State v. McCoy, 414 S.E.2d 392, 395 (N.C. Ct. App. 1992) (ruling a law enforcement officerâ€™s testimony on the street value of cocaine was properly admitted in defendantâ€™s trial for trafficking cocaine because the testimony was both helpful and relevant in showing the defendantâ€™s intent); Martin v. State, 823 S.W.2d 726, 728 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (ruling a sheriffâ€™s testimony on the price of marijuana was admissible and relevant because it allowed the jury to comprehend the quantity of illegal drugs recovered in terms that are easily understood); cf.

Dâ€™Agostino, of York, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliot, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  William White Rutledge appeals his conviction for simple possession of marijuana, first offense, arguing the trial court erred in ruling that the search warrant was sufficient to establish probable cause, and in determining that the affidavit in support of the warrant was valid.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case began when narcotics officers from the Rock Hill Police Department assigned to the York County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit received an anonymous tip through Crime Stoppers regarding drug activity at 162 Bailey Avenue in Rock Hill.Â  The anonymous informant stated that Rutledge and two other men were selling marijuana at that address.Â  Based on the tip, the officers checked the electric company records and determined that the electricity at that address was registered in Rutledgeâ€™s name.Â  The officers also checked Rutledgeâ€™s criminal history and discovered he had two prior convictions for simple possession of marijuana in 1990 and 1991.Â  The officers conducted surveillance for several days at the address, but did not see any activity at the residence.Â  The officers then conducted a â€œtrash pullâ€ at the address.Â  The trash can was located at the curb in front of 162 Bailey Avenue, but not on the property itself.Â  The officers found marijuana seeds and stalks inside, about midway down the trash can.Â  \r\nBased on this information the officers went to the magistrate seeking a search warrant for the residence.Â  The affidavit supporting the search warrant stated, in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\nThe affiant, who is a certified Law Enforcement officer assigned to the York County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit and has several years law enforcement experience, to include narcotics investigations, states the following facts to support probable cause to search the premises within the curtilage of the property listed within:\r\nThe affiant has received information that William Rutledge and two other subjects only known as Steve and Richie are selling marijuana from 162 Bailey Ave., Rock Hill, South Carolina.\r\nWithin the past 72 hours officers of the YCMDEU conducted a narcotics investigation focused on 162 Bailey Ave., Rock Hill, SC.Â  As a result of this investigation, officers recovered marijuana, marijuana seeds and marijuana stalks from 162 Bailey Ave.Â  A Criminal Records check of William Rutledge found that Rutledge has prior convictions for marijuana.Â  Officers of the YCMDEU confirmed through Rock Hill Utilities that William Rutledge is drawing power at 162 Bailey Ave.\r\nBased on the affiantâ€™s training and experience in narcotics investigations, it is believed that drug dealers keep contraband, proceeds of drug sales and records of drug transactions that may include written records, photographs, video tapes, audio tapes, computer hard drives and disks within secure locations of their residences and out buildings within the curtilage of their property.Â  See oral testimony.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following oral testimony was provided with the affidavit:\r\n\r\nOn July 21, 2005 Officer Cantey of the York County Multi Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit conducted a narcotics investigation focused on the illegal drug activities occurring at 162 Bailey Ave., Rock Hill, County of York, South Carolina.Â  During the investigation the trash from the residence was located in front of the residence.Â  The trash was located off the property and sat out for normal pick-up.Â  This date is the regularly scheduled day for the garbage collection from the residence.Â  During the investigation, marijuana was recovered from the trash of the residence.\r\n\r\nBased on this information, the magistrate issued the search warrant.Â  \r\nWhen they executed the search warrant, officers found marijuana on the kitchen counter.Â  Rutledge acknowledged to the officers that the marijuana was his, and told the officers that there was also a marijuana plant in the house that belonged to him.Â  The officers found the plant inside what the officer described as â€œa hydroponics marijuana growerâ€ in Rutledgeâ€™s bedroom.Â  \r\nAfter a bench trial, Rutledge was convicted of simple possession of marijuana, first offense, and sentenced to thirty days incarceration or to pay a fine of $100 plus court costs and assessments, for a total of $432.50.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviewing the decision to issue a search warrant should decide whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.Â  State v. Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 461, 454 S.E.2d 905, 907 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  A reviewing court should give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable cause.Â  State v. Davis, 354 S.C. 348, 355, 580 S.E.2d 778, 782 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nRutledge argues the circuit court erred in determining that the affidavit was sufficient to demonstrate probable cause, and in failing to determine that the search warrant was misleading and therefore invalid. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nA search warrant may issue only upon a finding of probable cause.Â  State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999).Â  Search warrants may be issued â€œonly upon affidavit sworn before the magistrate . . . establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985).Â  Oral testimony may be used to supplement search warrant affidavits.Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678-79 (2000).Â  The magistrateâ€™s task in determiningÂ  whether to issue the search warrant is to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.Â  State v. Dunbar, 361 S.C. 240, 246, 603 S.E.2d 615, 618 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Insufficiency Argument\r\nRutledge first argues that the affidavit was insufficient to demonstrate probable cause. Specifically, he argues that the affidavit fails to detail the â€œinvestigationâ€ referred to, to mention that the trash can where the marijuana was found was in the public domain and not on the property of the residence, and because the confidential informantâ€™s reliability was not established. We disagree.\r\nThe affidavit stated that the officers had â€œreceived information that William Rutledge and two other subjects only known as Steve and Richie are selling marijuana from 162 Bailey Ave., Rock Hill, South Carolina.â€Â  This tip provided the specific crime being committed, the names of the people involved in the crime, and the specific location where the activity was occurring. See Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 144, 519 S.E.2d at 349 (noting that specificity of information provided by a confidential informant indicates greater reliability).Â  Because an anonymous informant is correct about some facts, that informant is more likely correct about other facts, including illegal activity.Â \r\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 244 (1983).\r\nRutledge cites State v. Coin Operated Video Games Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000), to attack the reliability of the confidential informantâ€™s tip.Â  This case holds that a warrant based solely on information provided by a confidential informant must contain information supporting the credibility of the informant and the basis of his knowledge.Â  Id.Â  However, the warrant in this case was not based solely on the tip from the confidential informant.Â  The marijuana the officers found in the trash can in front of the residence, and Rutledgeâ€™s prior convictions for marijuana serve as additional evidence of a crime, while along with the electric bill registered in Rutledgeâ€™s name, also substantiating the credibility of the informant and the veracity of his statements.Â  See Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 144-45, 519 S.E.2d at 349 (finding confirmation of the reliability of an informantâ€™s information, which detailed the caliber and/or make of three guns, when the information correlated with 3 of 20 guns that had been stolen from a police station).\r\nGiven all the circumstances in the affidavit and the supporting oral testimony, including the informantâ€™s information, the electric bill in Rutledgeâ€™s name, Rutledgeâ€™s prior convictions, and the marijuana found in the trash can in front of the residence, we conclude that the magistrate had substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to issue a search warrant of the residence.Â  Accordingly, we find the affidavit was sufficient.\r\nII.&nbsp; Misleading Argument\r\nRutledge next argues that the affidavit was misleading, demonstrating a reckless disregard for the truth, because it overstates the evidence the officers had of any ongoing illegal activity.Â  Specifically, he argues that the affidavit should have disclosed the lack of independent evidence of ongoing illegal activities at the residence, should have indicated that the marijuana, seeds, and stalks were discovered in a trash can off the property, and that Rutledgeâ€™s prior convictions were in 1990 and 1991.Â  He thus requests that the alleged distorted facts in the affidavit be disregarded pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), in considering the affidavitâ€™s sufficiency to demonstrate probable cause.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere is a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant. Â Id. at 171.Â  Rutledge contends first that the affidavit incorrectly informed the magistrate that illegal activities at the residence were ongoing.Â  However, the anonymous tip and the marijuana found in the trash can within seventy-two hours of the affidavitâ€™s submission support such a contention.Â  \r\nRutledge next contends the affidavit improperly implied that the officers recovered the marijuana, seeds, and stalks from the residence itself.Â  But, the affidavit merely states, â€œ[O]fficers recovered marijuana, marijuana seeds, and marijuana stalks from 162 Bailey Avenue.â€Â  Nowhere does the affidavit say it was found in the house.Â  Further, the affiantâ€™s oral testimony stated exactly how and where the officers found the trash can and the marijuana.Â  These statements do not constitute a reckless disregard for the truth.\r\nFinally, Rutledge argues that the officers improperly left out the dates and severity of Rutledgeâ€™s marijuana convictions.Â  However, the exculpatory value of that information is dubious.Â  Rutledge contends that the omission of that information left the magistrate with the impression that Rutledge was involved with illegal narcotics.Â  But the inclusion of the specific date and type of conviction could still allow that impression.Â  Further, there is no Franks violation if the affidavit, including the omitted exculpatory information, still contains sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.Â  Id. Â Had the affidavit noted the dates of Rutledgeâ€™s prior marijuana convictions, the substantial basis for probable cause would not be diminished, because any doubt as to current illegal activities at the residence would be obviated by the recent informantâ€™s tip and discovery of marijuana outside the residence.Â  Therefore, we find nothing in the affidavit demonstrates a reckless disregard for the truth.\r\nCONCLUSION Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, Rutledgeâ€™s conviction for simple possession of marijuana, first offense, is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4231","title":"Stearns Bank National Association v.

Booth, III, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Glenwood Falls, LP, appeals the masterâ€™s order denying its motion to set aside a default judgment.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nI.\r\nGlenwood Falls is a South Carolina limited partnership.Â  Glenwood Falls hired DC Development, a South Carolina corporation, to construct apartments on real property Glenwood Falls owned in York County.Â  To fund this project, Glenwood Falls obtained a $1.8 million mortgage from Stearns Bank. \r\nOn January 30, 2004, Stearns Bank brought a foreclosure action against Glenwood Falls, DC Development, and Charleston Affordable Housing (â€œAffordable Housingâ€).Â  Affordable Housing, a South Carolina non-profit corporation, is one of Glenwood Fallsâ€™ general partners.Â  On March 15, 2004, DC Development answered and filed a cross-claim against Glenwood Falls, seeking to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien on the property and asserting causes of action for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit.Â  DC Developmentâ€™s attorney, William Booth, mailed the cross-claim via certified mail to Glenwood Fallsâ€™ registered agent, Cathy Kleiman, but Kleiman did not sign the return receipt.Â  Instead, an unauthorized person signed it.Â  \r\nKleiman nevertheless received the cross-claim and, on May 13, 2004, forwarded it to Robert Nettles, an attorney she believed represented Glenwood Falls.Â  Over the next several months, Kleiman attempted to contact Nettles multiple times to ascertain the status of the cross-claim, but Nettles did not respond.Â  The record does not establish that Nettles was ever retained to represent Glenwood Falls in this matter.Â  \r\nOn June 17, 2004, the master issued a foreclosure order, but retained jurisdiction to hear the cross-claim.Â  On July 28, 2004, DC Developmentâ€™s attorney, Booth, purportedly received a phone message from Affordable Housingâ€™s attorney, Frank Cisa, regarding Cisaâ€™s representation of Glenwood Falls.Â  On November 8, 2004, Booth wrote Cisa the following:\r\n\r\nI represent DC Development, Inc. and I believe you represent Glenwood Falls, LP and Charleston Affordable Housing, Inc.Â  I have scheduled the trial of a Cross-Claim of DC Development, Inc. against Glenwood Falls, LP.Â  The trial is scheduled for December 16, 2004, at 1:30 PM in the office of the Master in Equity for York County. \r\n\r\nCisa replied the next day (â€œthe November 9 letterâ€).Â  He wrote:\r\n\r\nI do represent Charleston Affordable Housing, Inc. and I am now taking over the representation of Glenwood Falls, LP.Â  What I gather from you[r] letter is that no Answer was filed on behalf of Glenwood Falls, LP to the Cross-Claim of DC Development, Inc.Â  If that is the case, it was caused by the failure of the original attorney for Glenwood Falls, LP to respond.Â  In any event, for DC Development, Inc. to recover any money in this action, my opinion is that Glenwood Falls, LP needs to assert a claim over and against the architects and engineers who designed this project.Â  Glenwood Falls, LP has no assets . . . .\r\n\r\nOn December 16, 2004, the master heard DC Developmentâ€™s cross-claim against Glenwood Falls, as Booth mentioned in his letter to Cisa.Â  Cisa, however, did not appear on Glenwood Fallsâ€™ behalf.Â  That same day, Booth filed an affidavit of default.Â  On January 5, 2005, the master entered a default judgment of $1.3 million against Glenwood Falls.Â  \r\nIn April 2005, Glenwood Falls moved to set aside the default judgment.Â  Glenwood Falls argued (1) the judgment was void because the court did not have personal jurisdiction over Glenwood Falls as a result of DC Developmentâ€™s failure to properly serve Glenwood Falls, and (2) the judgment was procured through excusable neglect.Â  The master denied Glenwood Fallsâ€™ motion.Â  The master found (1) the court had personal jurisdiction over Glenwood Falls, despite DC Developmentâ€™s failure to serve Glenwood Falls properly, because Glenwood Falls made a voluntary appearance, which waived its right to contest personal jurisdiction, and (2) the judgment was not procured through excusable neglect.Â  Glenwood Falls appeals. \r\nII.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a motion for relief from judgment lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 502-03 (2006).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion arises where the judge issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or where the order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 503.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nGlenwood Falls argues the master erred in denying its motion to set aside a default judgment because (1) the judgment was void, as Glenwood Falls was not properly served and did not make a voluntary appearance, and (2) the judgment was procured through excusable neglect, as Glenwood Fallsâ€™ attorneys abandoned it.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Glenwood Fallsâ€™ motion for relief from default judgment.[1]  \r\nA. Â Â Â Â  Voluntary Appearance \r\nGlenwood Falls contends the judgment was void as a result of DC Developmentâ€™s improper service, and the master erred in finding Glenwood Falls made a voluntary appearance.Â  We disagree. \r\nA court may set aside a default judgment in accordance with Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  See Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(b)(4) provides: â€œOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a\r\nparty or his legal representative from a final judgment . . . [if] the judgment is void . . . .â€Â  â€œA judgment is void if a court acts without personal jurisdiction.â€Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 503&nbsp;(2006). \r\nA court usually obtains personal jurisdiction by the service of the summons and complaint.Â  To serve a partnership, a copy of the summons and complaint must be delivered to â€œan officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process,â€ or sent by â€œregistered or certified mail, return receipt requested and delivery restricted to the addressee.â€Â  Rule 4(d)(3) &amp; (8), SCRCP.Â  Although a court commonly obtains personal jurisdiction by the service of the summons and complaint, it may also obtain personal jurisdiction if the defendant makes a voluntary appearance.Â  Rule 4(d) (â€œVoluntary appearance by defendant is equivalent to personal service.â€).[2]Â Â  \r\nAs the master found, and neither party contests, DC Development did not properly serve Glenwood Falls under Rule 4(d)(8), because an unauthorized person signed the return receipt.Â  Normally, this would be a suitable ground to grant relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(4).Â  See Rule 4(d)(8) (â€œAny such default or judgment by default shall be set aside pursuant to Rule 55(c) or Rule 60(b) if the defendant demonstrates to the court that the return receipt was signed by an unauthorized person.â€).Â  But the master did not set aside the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(4) because he found Glenwood Falls made a voluntary appearance, which under Rule 4(d) is â€œequivalent to personal service.â€Â  Thus, the master concluded the court had personal jurisdiction over Glenwood Falls.Â  \r\nThe critical issue, therefore, is whether the master erred in finding Glenwood Falls made a voluntary appearance.Â  â€œThe term â€˜appearanceâ€™ is used particularly to signify or designate the overt act by which one against whom suit has been commenced submits himself to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction.â€Â  4 Am. Jur. 2d Appearance Â§ 1 (1995).Â  â€œAn appearance may be expressly made by formal written or oral declaration, or record entry, or it may be implied from some act done with the intention of appearing and submitting to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction.â€Â  Id.Â  No specific act constitutes an appearance, as â€œa defendant may choose to come into court with trumpets, or quietly by the back door.â€Â  Stephens v. Ringling, 102 S.C. 333, 342, 86 S.E. 683, 685 (1915).Â  Accordingly, courts decide on a case by case basis whether a defendantâ€™s act demonstrates an intent to submit to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  \r\nHere, the master found the November 9 letter from Glenwood Fallsâ€™ attorney, Cisa, to DC Developmentâ€™s attorney demonstrated an intent to submit to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction and, therefore, constituted a voluntary appearance.Â  The master cited Petty v. Weyerhaeuser Company, 272 S.C. 282, 251 S.E.2d 735&nbsp;(1979), for the proposition that a letter from one attorney to another may constitute a voluntary appearance.Â  Glenwood Falls argues Petty is distinguishable from this case.Â  \r\nIn Petty, plaintiffâ€™s counsel sent the summons and complaint to defense counsel in Tacoma, Washington.Â  A few weeks later, defense counsel called plaintiffâ€™s counsel to request an extension of time to answer the complaint, which plaintiffâ€™s counsel granted.Â  Defense counsel memorialized this exchange in a letter to plaintiffâ€™s counsel, which read: â€œConfirming our telephone conversation of February 27, please consider this letter as an informal notice of appearance on behalf of [the defendant] in the suit you recently instituted . . . .â€Â  Id. at 284, 251 S.E.2d at 736.Â  The letter also stated the defendant would like to â€œexplore settlement possibilities prior to retaining counsel in South Carolina for formal appearance, answer and defense or settlement by local counsel.â€Â  Id.Â  When, after numerous attempts, plaintiffâ€™s counsel could not reach defense counsel to discuss settlement possibilities, plaintiffâ€™s counsel filed an affidavit of default, and an order of default was issued.Â  Defense counsel moved to set aside the order of default, arguing the court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant because the plaintiff improperly served it.Â  The trial court found service was proper and, even if service were improper, the defendant made a voluntary appearance.Â  Our supreme court found service was improper, but nevertheless held the defendant made a voluntary appearance.\r\nGlenwood Falls asserts Petty is distinguishable from this case because (1) in Petty defense counsel acknowledged the summons and complaint, but in this case Cisa did not acknowledge the cross-claim; and (2) in Petty defense counsel expressly stated the letter should be considered an appearance, but in this case Cisa did not expressly state the November 9 letter should be considered an appearance.Â  \r\nGlenwood Fallsâ€™ attempt to distinguish Petty is unpersuasive.Â  First, Cisa does acknowledge DC Developmentâ€™s cross-claim.Â  In the November 9 letter to Booth, Cisa writes, â€œWhat I gather from you[r] letter is that no Answer was filed on behalf of Glenwood Falls, LP to the Cross-Claim of DC Development, Inc.â€ (emphasis added).[3]Â  Clearly, then, Cisa recognized DC Developmentâ€™s cross-claim against Glenwood Falls.\r\nSecond, the mere fact that Cisa did not mention the word â€œappearanceâ€ in the November 9 letter does not mean Glenwood Falls failed to make an appearance.Â  Again, the inquiry is whether Glenwood Fallsâ€™ conduct demonstrated an intent to submit to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  The inquiry is not whether Glenwood Falls invoked the term â€œappearance.â€[4]Â  On many occasions our supreme court has found that a party can make a voluntary appearance without formally announcing it.Â  See, e.g., Triangle Auto Spring Co. v. Gromlovitz, 270 S.C. 386, 389-90 n.1, 242 S.E.2d 430, 431&nbsp;n.1 (1978) (holding that consenting to a confession of judgment constitutes a voluntary appearance); Connell v. Connell, 249 S.C. 162, 167, 153 S.E.2d 396, 399&nbsp;(1967) (holding that raising the defense of res judicata constitutes a voluntary appearance); Se. Equip. Co. v. One 1954 Autocar Diesel Tractor,&nbsp;234 S.C. 213, 218, 107 S.E.2d 340, 342&nbsp;(1959) (holding that filing a motion to set aside an attachment constitutes a voluntary appearance).Â  \r\nAs the master correctly held that a letter from one attorney to another may serve as a basis to find a voluntary appearance, we now examine whether the master erred in finding that Glenwood Falls made a voluntary appearance.Â  We believe the November 9 letter manifests Glenwood Fallsâ€™ intent to submit to the jurisdiction of the court.Â  In the November 9 letter, Cisa not only announces his representation of Glenwood Falls without reservation but also expresses an intent to reach the merits of the case, especially when he writes â€œfor DC Development, Inc., to recover any money in this action, my opinion is that Glenwood Falls, LP needs to assert a claim over and against the architects and engineers who designed this project.â€Â  See Jenkinson v. Murrow Bros. Seed Co., 272 S.C. 148, 154, 249 S.E.2d 780, 783 (1978) (Ness, J., concurring) (â€œIn order to establish waiver of the right to contest jurisdiction, it is only necessary that a party, by its conduct, evince an intent to proceed to the merits of the case.â€).Â  Moreover, the November 9 letter contains not the slightest hint of a desire to challenge service of process.Â  Based on the record before us, we hold the master did not err in finding the November 9 letter was a voluntary appearance by Glenwood Falls.[5]\r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Excusable Neglect \r\nGlenwood Falls contends the master erred in finding the judgment was not procured through excusable neglect because Glenwood Fallsâ€™ attorneys willfully abandoned it.Â  We disagree. \r\nA default judgment may be set aside on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  Relief from judgment is available upon a showing of excusable neglect and a meritorious defense; case law also directs the trial court to consider the presence or absence of prejudice to the party opposing the motion.Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œIn determining whether to grant a motion under Rule 60(b), the trial judge should consider: (1) the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the reasons for the failure to act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious defense, and (4) the prejudice to the other party.â€).\r\nIn the case before us, because of our ultimate disposition, we need only address Glenwood Fallsâ€™ excusable neglect claim arising from the assertion of willful abandonment by its counsel.Â  Concerning a claim of attorney neglect, the general rule is that â€œthe neglect of the attorney is attributable to the client.â€Â  Graham v. Town of Loris,&nbsp;272 S.C. 442, 451, 248 S.E.2d 594, 598&nbsp;(1978).Â  In discussing this general rule, the Graham court quoted approvingly from Simon v. Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 551, 99 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1957):\r\n\r\nAlthough a wide discretion is vested in courts to set aside or vacate judgments because of the neglect, misconduct or inadvertence of counsel employed in the case, the general rule undoubtedly is that the neglect of the attorney is the neglect of the client, and that no mistake, inadvertence or neglect attributable to the attorney can be successfully used as a ground for relief, unless it would have been excusable if attributable to the client.Â  The acts and omissions of the attorney in such case are those of the client. \r\n\r\nHowever, â€œ[t]he rule that an attorneyâ€™s negligence may be imputed to his client and prevent the latter from relying on that ground for opening or vacating a judgment does not necessarily prevail in the event of the attorneyâ€™s abandonment or withdrawal from the case.â€Â  Graham, 272 S.C. at 452, 248 S.E.2d at 599 (citing 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments Â§ 737 (1969)).Â  To overcome the general rule that the neglect of the attorney is attributable to the client, the client must establish that its former attorney willfully and unilaterally abandoned it.Â  Id. at 452, 248 S.E.2d at 599; Paul Davis Sys. Inc. v. Deepwater of Hilton Head, LLC, 362 S.C. 220, 226, 607 S.E.2d 358, 361 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œThis is not a case of willful and unilateral abandonment of the client by counsel in which we could refuse to apply the general rule that the neglect of the attorney is the neglect of the client.â€).\r\nOur law thus instructs that an exception to the general rule applies when the attorneyâ€™s inaction was the consequence of willful abandonment or withdrawal from the case.Â  Where an attorney is merely neglectful, the general rule applies and relief from judgment is unavailable; where an attorneyâ€™s conduct transcends mere neglect and the party seeking relief establishes willful abandonment or withdrawal from the case, relief from judgment is available.Â  \r\nThe facts in Graham are instructive.Â  The Town of Loris was represented by its city attorney.Â  The day before a summary judgment hearing the Town of Loris received a letter from the city attorney announcing his immediate resignation.Â  The city attorney did not inform any town official of the impending summary judgment hearing.Â  When no one appeared at the hearing on behalf of the Town of Loris, summary judgment was entered against it.Â  The trial court ultimately granted the Town of Loris relief from judgment, holding that the Town of Loris had no notice of the summary judgment hearing and that its attorney had resigned.Â  The supreme court affirmed, noting that â€œunder the rare circumstances of this case,â€ the Town of Loris â€œshould not be charged with the abandonment of the case by its counsel.â€Â  Graham,&nbsp;272 S.C. at 452, 248 S.E.2d at 599.\r\nIn Simon, 231 S.C. 545, 99 S.E.2d 391, defense counsel failed to answer a complaint because he was involved in a multi-day trial.Â  As a result of defense counselâ€™s failure to answer the complaint, the court entered a default judgment against defendant.Â  On appeal, our supreme court was sympathetic to defense counselâ€™s plight but nevertheless adhered to the general rule and imputed the neglect of counsel to his client.Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\n[T]he default was the result of forgetfulness on [the attorneyâ€™s] part which in turn was due to pressure of his business in the trial of cases . . . .Â  In the crowded routine of a busy lawyerâ€™s life a mistake such as the record here discloses is understandable; but it entails the penalty of default under strict enforcement of the rule of procedure, and the trial courtâ€™s refusal to forgive it affords no basis for reversal.\r\n\r\nId.Â  at 550-51, 99 S.E.2d at 394.Â  \r\nWe now turn to Glenwood Fallsâ€™ claims of excusable neglect in connection with attorneys Nettles and\r\nCisa.\r\n1.&nbsp; Nettles\r\nGlenwood Falls argues Nettles willfully abandoned it.Â  We initially observe that it is doubtful whether Nettles actually represented Glenwood Falls in this litigation. Â In fact, Nettles wrote Kleiman and Cisa on June 24, 2004, and disavowed any representation of Glenwood Falls.Â  This uncertainty about Nettlesâ€™ purported representation of Glenwood Falls, standing alone, is enough to sustain the masterâ€™s ruling.\r\nMoreover, under no circumstance has Glenwood Falls shown that it was prejudiced by Nettles alleged representation.Â  As the November 9 letter illustrates, Glenwood Falls arranged for Cisa to take over the representation of Glenwood Falls before default was entered. Â Therefore, Glenwood Falls, through Cisa, had ample time following the November 9 letter to take appropriate action to protect itself from default.Â  Glenwood Falls failed to do so.Â  Now, Glenwood Falls attempts to resurrect its alleged problems with Nettles in May, June, and July of 2004 to extricate itself from its failure to act to protect its interests in November and December of 2004.Â  This it cannot do.Â  We find the master did not abuse his discretion in denying Glenwood Falls relief based on the purported representation by Nettles. \r\n2.&nbsp; Cisa\r\nGlenwood Falls argues Cisa willfully abandoned it.[6]Â  Cisa began representing Glenwood Falls on November 9, 2004, at the latest.Â  Even if we assume that Cisaâ€™s failure to act between the November 9 letter and the default judgment was neglectful, we may not assume that Cisaâ€™s failure to act transcends mere neglect and rises to the level of willful abandonment or withdrawal from the case.Â  Resolution of the appeal concerning Cisa turns on this critical difference.Â Â  Â \r\nAs noted, mere neglect invokes the general rule of imputing the neglect of the attorney to the client, while willful abandonment triggers the exception to the general rule and allows relief to the client.Â  This distinction may be best illustrated by reiterating the critical factual distinction between Simon and Graham.Â  In Simon, the attorney simply forgot to answer the complaint against his client, and the supreme court upheld the trial courtâ€™s denial of relief of judgment because the attorneyâ€™s conduct did not transcend mere neglect.Â  Simon, 231 S.C. at 550-51, 99 S.E.2d at 394.Â  In Graham, the moving party established that its attorney affirmatively withdrew by resigning on the eve of a summary judgment hearing leaving the client unaware of the imminent and dispositive motion hearing.Â  Our supreme court upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant relief from judgment based on the fact that the attorney willfully abandoned his representation by resigning right before the summary judgment hearing.Â  Graham, 272 S.C. at 453, 248 S.E.2d at 599.Â  \r\nThis case is controlled by Simon, for evidence of willful abandonment is missing.Â  Thus, even if we assume Cisaâ€™s failure to act following the November 9 letter constituted neglect, the scant record before us does not permit the additional finding of willful abandonment, partly due to Glenwood Fallsâ€™ generic and nonspecific Rule 60(b) motion.Â  We, of course, decline to speculate in a manner that favors Glenwood Falls.Â  Therefore, Glenwood Falls has not established that Cisa willfully abandoned or withdrew from the case.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the masterâ€™s refusal to find excusable neglect.Â  \r\nConsequently, we find no error in the masterâ€™s denial of Glenwood Fallsâ€™ Rule 60(b)(1) motion to set aside a default judgment for excusable neglect with respect to attorneys Nettles and Cisa.\r\nIV.\r\nWe hold the master did not abuse his discretion in refusing to set aside the default judgment obtained by DC Development against Glenwood Falls.Â  The November 9 letter constitutes a voluntary appearance by Glenwood Falls, and the judgment was not procured through excusable neglect.Â  The masterâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n SHORT, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion. \r\nÂ ANDERSON, J. (dissenting in a separate opinion):Â  Â I disagree with the majorityâ€™s reasoning and analysis.Â  In my view, the trial court erred in failing to set aside the default judgment on the basis of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  Specifically, Glenwood is entitled to relief because its attorneys abandoned it.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE.\r\nABANDONMENT\r\nJuridical writing in South Carolina articulates the general rule that the acts and omissions of an attorney are attributable to the client.Â  Hillman v. Pinion, 347 S.C. 253, 257, 554 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 2001); Simon v. Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 99 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1957).Â  The exception to this rule is recognized in the seminal case, Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 248 S.E.2d 594 (1978).Â  Graham inculcates: \r\n\r\nAlthough a wide discretion is vested in courts to set aside or vacate judgments because of the neglect, misconduct or inadvertence of counsel employed in the case, the general rule undoubtedly is that the neglect of the attorney is the neglect of the client, and that no mistake, inadvertence or neglect attributable to an attorney can be successfully used as a ground for relief, unless it would have been excusable if attributable to the client.Â  The acts and omissions of the attorney in such case are those of the client.\r\nHowever, under the facts of the present case, we are not merely considering neglect, inadvertence, or mistake of counsel.Â  We are concerned with a wilful and unilateral abandonment of the client by counsel.Â  There is authority for the proposition that the general rule is not applied to such a factual situation.Â  This exception to the general rule is expressed at 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments, s 737 (1969) in the following language:\r\nThe rule that an attorneyâ€™s negligence may be imputed to his client and prevent the latter from relying on that ground for opening or vacating a judgment does not necessarily prevail in the event of the attorneyâ€™s abandonment or withdrawal from the case.\r\n\r\n272 S.C. 442, 451-52, 248 S.E.2d 594, 599; accord Paul Davis Systems, Inc. v. Deepwater of Hilton Head, LLC, 362 S.C. 220, 226, 607 S.E.2d 358, 361 (Ct. App. 2004) (recognizing an exception to the general rule when the attorneyâ€™s conduct constitutes willful abandonment).Â  \r\nThe rule that the acts and omissions of an attorney are attributable to the client is not a hard and fast rule.Â  Brown v. Butler, 347 S.C. 259, 265, 554 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œRather, it is one that is â€˜to be applied rationally, with a fair recognition that justice to the litigants is always the polestar.â€™ â€ Id. (citing Graham, 272 S.C. at 452, 248 S.E.2d at 599).Â  \r\nIn Graham, our Supreme Court held â€œthe attorneyâ€™s action in withdrawing from this case at a crucial stage without reasonable notice to his client is one of willful abandonment.â€Â  272 S.C. at 452, 248 S.E.2d at 599.Â  â€œAn attorney who undertakes the conduct of an action impliedly stipulates to carry it to its termination and is not at liberty to abandon it without reasonable cause and reasonable notice.â€Â  Graham, 272 S.C. at 452-53, 248 S.E.2d at 599 (citing Perkins v. Sykes, 233 N.C. 147, 152, 63 S.E.2d 133, 137 (1951)); Floyd v. Kosko, 285 S.C. 390, 393, 329 S.E.2d 459, 460 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  When counsel withdraws from a case at a crucial stage in litigation without reasonable notice to his client, the â€œ[client] should not be charged with the abandonment of the case by its counsel.â€Â  Graham, 272 S.C. at 452-53, 248 S.E.2d at 599 (â€œConscience requires this Court to charge the attorney alone with his gross dereliction of duty and not to visit its consequences upon an innocent client.â€). \r\nThe majority enunciates the position that any failure of counsel must be based upon assumptions.Â  The French phrase â€œpas du toutâ€[7] is efficacious.Â  Not only does the failure in this case transcend mere neglect, it rises to the level of abandonment.Â  \r\nKleinman believed Nettles to be Glenwoodâ€™s attorney when she forwarded DC Developmentâ€™s cross-complaint to him on May 13, 2004.Â  She persisted in attempting to contact Nettles, but he did not respond, nor did he file an answer to the cross-claim.Â  On June 24, 2004, in a letter to Kleinman and Cisa, Nettles disavowed representation of Glenwood.Â  In addition, Cisaâ€™s November 9, 2004 letter to counsel for DC Development indicated he was taking over Glenwoodâ€™s representation.Â  Cisa explained the reason no answer to DC Developmentâ€™s cross-claim had been filed was due to â€œthe failure of the original attorney for Glenwood Falls, LP to respond.â€Â  \r\nIt is commonly understood that a client may assume a lawyer who has previously represented him will continue to serve in that capacity.Â  When the attorney becomes aware the client is operating under that assumption, it is incumbent upon the attorney to immediately and clearly resolve any doubt about whether the attorney-client relationship still exists.Â  Delay in clarifying whether the representation continues risks exposing the client to prejudice, should the client mistakenly believe the attorney is acting to protect the clientâ€™s interests.Â  Although Nettles had the cross-complaint in his possession and had received multiple contacts from Kleinman, he nevertheless delayed nearly six weeks before addressing the attorney-client relationship.Â  During that time the cross-complaint should have been answered to avoid admission of the allegations therein.Â  Glenwood needed the advice of counsel on how to protect its interests.Â  Glenwood was unquestionably prejudiced by Nettlesâ€™ conduct.Â  \r\nThe etiology of the default position of Glenwood arises from the failure and inaction of Nettles.Â  The default position of Glenwood is concatenated from Nettles through Cisa.Â  On November 8, 2004, Cisa received DC Developmentâ€™s letter informing him of the December 16, 2004 trial date.Â  In acknowledgement of that letter, Cisa confirmed he was taking over Glenwoodâ€™s representation and indicated he intended to proceed on the merits of the case.Â  Cisa represented Glenwood on November 9, 2004, at the latest.Â  The majority agrees his conduct thereafter was neglectful.Â  \r\nRecognizing the dissimilitude of the facts in Graham v. Town of Loris as juxtaposed to this record, the annunciation of the principles and doctrines of law in Graham command the same result in this case.Â  The attorney representing the Town of Loris resigned the day before a summary judgment hearing without notifying the town of his resignation.Â  When no one appeared at the summary judgment hearing the court granted summary judgment against the Town of Loris.Â  In this case, Cisa acknowledged he represented Glenwood, had notice of the December 16 trial, yet simply failed to appear at the trial.Â  Entry of default and the subsequent default judgment against Glenwood resulted from Cisaâ€™s abandonment.Â  His failure to appear at this critical stage in litigation without any notice to Glenwood was tantamount to unilateral and willful abandonment.Â  The rationale in Graham is equally applicable in this case:Â  â€œConscience requires this Court to charge the attorney alone with his gross dereliction of duty and not to visit its consequences upon an innocent client.â€ \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe opinion of the majority is infected with expository difficulty when juxtaposed to the precedent extant in South Carolina law on abandonment.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE.  \r\n\r\n[1] The amended Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion that is the basis of this appeal is generic and unspecific, leaving us to speculate as to the precise basis of the motion.Â  Beyond this, the record on appeal does not contain the transcript from the motion hearing.Â  Although we could affirm on issue preservation grounds alone, we elect to treat the issue as preserved, for we can reasonably discern the basis of the motion in the masterâ€™s order denying the motion.\r\n[2] Although Rule 5(b), SCRCP, generally provides less stringent standards for serving pleadings subsequent to the original summons and complaint, Rule 5(a), SCRCP, requires service pursuant to Rule 4 when a party makes new or additional claims against another party that has been held in default for failure to appear.\r\n[3] Glenwood Falls emphasizes in its brief to this court that the November 9 letter does not even mention the cross-claim.Â  Glenwood Falls writes Cisa â€œsimply stated that he was â€˜now taking over the representation of Glenwood Falls, LPâ€™ without even mentioning the Cross-Claim.â€ (emphasis added).Â  Glenwood Fallsâ€™ claim is not accurate, for the November 9 letter clearly addresses the cross-claim. \r\n[4] Glenwood Falls argues that because the November 9 letter did not formally announce Glenwood Fallsâ€™ intent to make an appearance, Glenwood Falls did not waive its right to contest personal jurisdiction.Â  Glenwood Falls cites Boland v. South Carolina Public Service Authority, 281 S.C. 293, 315 S.E.2d 143 (Ct. App. 1984), for the proposition that a letter from defense counsel to plaintiffâ€™s counsel does not constitute a voluntary appearance if the letter does not expressly invoke the term â€œappearance.â€Â  Boland does not create such a bright-line rule.Â  In Boland, this court upheld the trial courtâ€™s finding that the communication from defense counsel to plaintiffâ€™s counsel did not constitute an appearance.Â  That the communication did not use the term appearance was only one fact, among many, that was considered in the decision.Â  Other relevant factors included, for example, the timing and level of communication between the attorneys, as well as the fact that the defendantâ€™s â€œnext move in [the] lawsuit following [defense counselâ€™s] letter was to make a special appearance . . . .â€Â  Id. at 297, 315 S.E.2d at 146.Â  It is thus incorrect to suggest that the holding in Boland turned merely on the absence of the term â€œappearanceâ€ in the letter.Â Â  \r\n[5] In light of this holding, we need not address whether Cisaâ€™s actions on behalf of Affordable Housing also constituted a voluntary appearance for Glenwood Falls. \r\n[6] We question whether this issue was part of Glenwood Fallsâ€™ Rule 60(b) motion.Â  Glenwood Fallsâ€™ Rule 60(b) motion is conclusory and while it is clear from the masterâ€™s order that the Rule 60(b) motion involved attorney Nettles, we are left to speculate about Cisa.Â  The master, for example, in his order denying Rule 60(b) relief focused on Nettles and observed, â€œThe only substantial reason posed for [Glenwood Fallsâ€™] failure to act promptly in this matter is alleged â€˜abandonmentâ€™ by its original attorney.â€Â  The master further noted that â€œGlenwood [Falls] asserts that its first counsel in this matter abandoned it . . . .â€Â  Although there is no substantive discussion about Cisa in the masterâ€™s order, the order does contain indirect references to â€œeither counselâ€ of Glenwood Falls and the â€œattorneysâ€ of Glenwood Falls.Â  While a close question is presented, we treat the claim against Cisa as preserved.\r\n[7] This phrase means â€œnot soâ€ or â€œnot at allâ€.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4232","title":"State v.

Clare, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor David M. Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Travis Anthony Ladson was convicted of first-degree burglary following a three-day trial.Â  Ladson was sentenced on November 10, 2004, to prison for a non-parolable term of twenty-five years.Â  Ladson timely appealed his conviction and sentence.Â  In accordance with standard procedure, Ladson promptly requested the transcript of the trial from the court reporter.Â  Approximately ten months later, in August of 2005, the court reporter finally disclosed that there was no record of the trial court proceedings.\r\nBecause of the complete absence of a transcript, Ladson moved this court to reverse the convictions and sentences and for a new trial.Â  Based on the Stateâ€™s assurance that the record could be easily reconstructed, a judge of this court denied Ladsonâ€™s motion and remanded the matter to the trial court to reconstruct the record.Â  More than a year after the trial, the trial judge convened a hearing with trial counsel in an effort to reconstruct the record.\r\nWe now have before us what the State contends is a reconstructed record of the trial court proceedings sufficient to permit appellate review.Â  Ladson contends the conclusory and summary nature of the purported record on appeal does not permit meaningful appellate review.Â  Because we find the reconstructed record insufficient for meaningful review of direct appeal issues, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nI.\r\nOn January 5, 2006, pursuant to this courtâ€™s order, the trial judge held a hearing to reconstruct the record for appeal.[1]Â  It was clear from the outset of this hearing that reconstructing the record from scratch, after such a substantial delay, would be an uphill struggle.Â  The State presented two affidavits from witnesses and â€œsummarizedâ€ the testimony of the other witnesses.Â  \r\nThe information provided by the State was conclusory. The State usually prefaced its recall of witness testimony with statements like â€œhis testimony generally would be,â€ â€œhe testified generally to the following,â€ and â€œthe next witness . . . will be by summation.â€Â  Ladson took issue with the Stateâ€™s summary reconstruction of the record.Â  The trial judge, noting that he no longer had his handwritten notes from the trial, typically would conclude with respect to a particular witness that the State presented â€œan accurate summation of the testimony,â€ or the Stateâ€™s general description was â€œa correct summation of the testimony,â€ or â€œthe summation presented by the State . . . [was] a correct statement.â€Â  \r\nWhen the State concluded its summary of the testimony of one witness, the trial court concurred with the summary as â€œan accurate reflection of her testimony,â€ and further held that the witness was â€œqualified as an expert in her field, and . . . the court found her testimony to be credible.â€Â  The trial court then remarked, â€œI do not believe there was any question, at any point in time, as to the chain of evidence regarding these particular fingerprints.â€Â  The State corrected the trial court and noted that the witness was not qualified as an expert and further that Ladsonâ€™s trial counsel had preliminarily objected to the chain of custody. Â The trial court promptly agreed and explained the confusion by referring to another witness.\r\nThe State, too, had difficulty recalling the witnesses and the testimony.Â  For example, the State had completely forgotten about one witness, whose identity was determined only by reference to Ladsonâ€™s trial counselâ€™s notes.Â  As the Solicitor acknowledged, â€œthe final witness that I have to admit I discovered from [Ladsonâ€™s trial counselâ€™s] notes.â€Â  \r\nThere is even a dispute as to whether Ladson testified in his own defense.Â  Ladson claims he did not testify.Â  The trial court found otherwise, noting the â€œcourtâ€™s remembrance and recollection that the Defendant was not credible, and did not help himself in his testimony before the jury.â€ \r\nThe trial court appeared equally confident that the jury returned its verdict the same day it began its deliberations: â€œMy only recollection is that, after the court answered [a question from the jury], that the jury came out relatively soon after that with a verdict.â€Â  When confronted with a different recollection from Ladsonâ€™s counsel (claiming the jury was excused for the day and reached a verdict the following day), the trial court responded, â€œI usually require the jury to stay for as long as it takes [until it] come[s] back with a verdict.Â  I donâ€™t ever remember an occasion where I have allowed a jury to go home and come back.â€Â  The trial courtâ€™s recollection was proven faulty when the State called attention to the juror note dated November 9, 2004, and the juryâ€™s verdict dated the next day, November 10.Â Â  \r\nThe trial court and the State are confident that Ladson made timely objections at trial and moved for a directed verdict â€œbased upon the evidence.â€Â  Presumably, the State believes these concessions enlighten Ladson and us to the specific issues to address on appeal.Â  \r\nOn January 26, 2006, the trial court issued an â€œOrder for the Record on Appeal.â€Â  \r\nII.\r\nLadson maintains the reconstructed record does not allow for meaningful review of his direct appeal.Â  The State disagrees and asserts this court should find the record adequate for appellate review of the claims Ladson raised at the reconstructed hearing.Â  \r\nIt is clear from the record before us that all parties made a diligent effort to reconstruct the record.Â  Despite these good faith efforts, the reconstructed record is largely conclusory, with testimony, objections, and the like recalled only in summary fashion.Â  Thus, we must first determine the analytical framework for assessing the sufficiency of a reconstructed record, followed by a determination if the law warrants a new trial under the record before us.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina jurisprudence recognizes the trial courtâ€™s authority to set the record for appeal.Â  In China v. Parrot, 251 S.C. 329, 334, 162 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1968), our supreme court held that where a portion of the court reporterâ€™s notes were lost, the trial judge properly considered affidavits from counsel and the court reporter in reconstructing the record.Â  See also Koon v. State, 358 S.C. 359, 367, 595 S.E.2d 456, 460 (2004) (recognizing a courtâ€™s power to remand for a reconstruction hearing), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 105, 610 S.E.2d 494, 501 (2005); Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 221, 574 S.E.2d 200, 203 (2002) (finding that when a transcript has been lost or destroyed, an appellate court may remand to have the record reconstructed); Dolive v. J.E.E. Developers, Inc., 308 S.C. 380, 383, 418 S.E.2d 319, 321 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding trial court did not err in granting property ownerâ€™s request to reconstruct the record of zoning proceeding where portions of original tape of hearing were incapable of being transcribed).\r\nThe authority of the trial court in South Carolina to reconstruct the record for appellate purposes aligns our state with the majority of jurisdictions that hold â€œthe inability to prepare a complete verbatim transcript, in and of itself, does not necessarily present a sufficient ground for reversal.â€Â  Smith v. State, 433 A.2d 1143, 1148 (Md. 1981); e.g., Lewis v. State, 123 S.W.3d 891, 893 (Ark. 2003); Wilson v. State, 639 A.2d 696, 699 (Md. 1994); State v. Deschon, 85 P.3d 756, 760 (Mont. 2004); Lopez v. State, 769 P.2d 1276, 1280 (Nev. 1989); State v. Izaguirre, 639 A.2d 343, 346\r\n  (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1994); People v. Shire, 803 N.Y.S.2d 309, 310 (N.Y. App. Div. 2005); State v. Quick, 634 S.E.2d 915, 918 (N.C. Ct. App. 2006); Dickerson v. Commonwealth, 548 S.E.2d 230, 232-33 (Va. Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nMost jurisdictions require an appellant to demonstrate specific prejudice flowing from an incomplete or reconstructed record.Â  See, e.g., Lewis, 123 S.W.3d at 893 (â€œ[I]t is the appellantâ€™s duty to demonstrate that prejudice results from the state of the recordâ€); State v. Williams, 629 A.2d 402, 406 (Conn. 1993) (holding appellant must show â€œspecific prejudice that results from having to address his claims on appeal with the reconstructed recordâ€); Jones v. State, 923 So.2d 486, 489 (Fla. 2006) (noting appellant must point to prejudice resulting from missing portions of trial transcript); State v. Wright, 542 P.2d 63, 65 (Idaho 1975) (holding appellant must demonstrate â€œspecific prejudiceâ€ resulting from failure to reconstruct record); Simpson v. Commonwealth, 759 S.W.2d 224, 228 (Ky. 1988) (holding a showing of â€œprejudicial errorâ€ in having to proceed using substitute transcript is required); Smith, 433 A.2d at 1148 (noting â€œdefects must be of a prejudicial characterâ€); Commonwealth v. Chatman, 406 N.E.2d 1037, 1040 (Mass. App. Ct. 1980) (holding appellant must â€œcome forward with articulable claims [by] which the reconstruction may be judgedâ€); State v. Borden, 605 S.W.2d 88, 92 (Mont. 1980) (holding appellant must demonstrate prejudice); State v. Dupris, 373 N.W.2d 446, 449 (S.D. 1985) (holding appellant must show â€œspecific error or prejudiceâ€ resulting from failure to record entire proceedings of trial); State v. Neal, 304 S.E.2d 342, 345 (W. Va. 1983) (â€œGenerally, the failure to report some part of the proceeding will not alone constitute reversible error[;] [s]ome identifiable error or prejudice must be shown by the defendant.â€).Â  â€œ[B]efore a defendant can establish that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of an inadequate reconstructed record, he must identify a specific appellate claim that this court would be unable to review effectively using the reconstructed record.â€Â  Harris v. Commâ€™r of Corr., 671 A.2d 359, 363 (Conn. App. Ct. 1996).Â  We believe our supreme court would follow a rule requiring the party challenging a reconstructed record on appeal to demonstrate prejudice flowing from an inadequate record.\r\nWe conclude from China and its progeny, combined with a review of the law of other jurisdictions, that our supreme court would require a reconstructed record on appeal to allow for â€œmeaningful appellate review.â€Â  A new trial is therefore appropriate if the appellant establishes that â€œthe incomplete nature of the transcript prevents the appellate court from conducting a â€˜meaningful appellate review.â€™â€Â  In re D.W., 615 S.E.2d 90, 94 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005); see also State v. Chanze, 565 S.E.2d 379, 382-83 (W. Va. 2002) (finding criminal defendant is entitled to meaningful appellate review of his lower court proceedings, and if this is not possible from reconstructed record, a new trial is appropriate).Â  For a host of reasons, we find Ladson has established prejudice and demonstrated that the reconstructed record before us does not allow for meaningful appellate review.Â  \r\nWe recognize that the excellent trial judge did the best he could to reconstruct this case under difficult circumstances.Â  Approximately ten months transpired after the appeal was filed before the court reporter notified the parties (for a reason that is unclear) that her recording equipment failed and no part of the trial was recorded.[2]Â  The court reporterâ€™s delay in disclosing the lack of a transcript made a bad situation worse, as the passage of time clearly dimmed the recall of the participants.Â  We, too, must accept our share of the blame, for the remand order of this court required the trial court to reconstruct the record, with no option given to simply conclude that the record could not be reconstructed with the specificity to support meaningful appellate review.Â  Cf. Koon, 358 S.C. at 367, 595 S.E.2d at 460 (denying request to remand for reconstruction of a post-conviction hearing after appellant failed to allege specifics regarding his assignments of error); and Whitehead, 352 S.C. at 221, 574 S.E.2d at 203 (remanding matter to circuit court for reconstruction hearing and instructing, â€œIf the circuit court judge determines that reconstruction is not possible, he shall notify this Court . . . .â€). Â \r\nThe hearing to reconstruct the record for this three-day trial on a violent, non-parolable offense took place on January 5, 2006, more than a year after Ladson was convicted and sentenced.Â  We are mindful of the tremendous workloads faced by our fine trial court judges.Â  It is simply unrealistic and unreasonable to think that a trial judge and counsel canâ€”under these circumstancesâ€”reconstruct a proper record that will permit meaningful appellate review, especially in light of our issue preservation rules.Â  The continuing dispute as to whether Ladson even testified (much less the content of his purported testimony) is but one example of the trial court and counsel groping in the dark as to what actually happened at trial.\r\nMost cases around the country addressing this subject concern situations where only a part of the trial transcript is unavailable.Â  In many such circumstances, meaningful appellate review can occur and the rights of the parties are not prejudiced.Â  In this case, we are essentially left with a bare bones summary of the evidence (with more remaining unknown than known) from a lengthy multi-day and fact-intensive trial that resulted in a non-parolable twenty-five year prison term.\r\nMoreover, the fact of a missing portion of the trial transcript is usually brought to the courtâ€™s attention much earlier than the year-plus delay present here.Â  We are left with a few gratuitous references to generic motions and objections, but we do not know the context of&nbsp;the motions, the specific nature of the motions, and whether the challenged evidence was cumulative to other unchallenged evidence.Â  The list of unknowns continues.Â  In short, we are left to speculate, and we decline to do so.Â  See In re Rholetter, 592 S.E.2d 237, 244 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIf a transcript is altogether inaccurate and no adequate record of what transpired at trial can be reconstructed, the court must remand for a new trial.â€).Â  \r\nThe record before us does not permit meaningful appellate review.Â  To hold this record is sufficient would guarantee the affirmance of Ladsonâ€™s conviction and twenty-five-year non-parolable sentence without a genuine review.Â  We would simply be constrained to affirm based on an insufficient record and issue preservation principles.Â  Moreover, it would effectively foreclose any collateral challenge through post conviction relief or otherwise.Â  We hold Ladson has demonstrated clear prejudice.\r\nWe finally remind the State that this court previously remanded this matter to the trial court for the purpose of reconstructing the record on the â€œassuranceâ€ by the State that this was a simple and straightforward case.&nbsp; The State should therefore have no problem retrying this simple and straightforward case.\r\nIII.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we are convinced that under the circumstances of this case the reconstructed record lacks the completeness and reliability necessary for this court to engage in meaningful appellate review.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion. \r\n ANDERSON, J. (concurring in result only in a separate opinion):Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  The reliance by the majority on decisions from other jurisdictions is unnecessary.Â  I respectfully concur in result ONLY.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE and REMAND the convictions and sentences of Travis Anthony Ladson for a new trial.Â  \r\nThe precedent extant in South Carolina, consisting of: China v. Parrott, 251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d 276 (1968); Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 574 S.E.2d 200 (2002); Koon v. State, 358 S.C. 359, 595 S.E.2d 456 (2004); and Dolive v. J.E.E. Developers, Inc., 308 S.C. 380 418 S.E.2d 319 (Ct. App. 1992), establishes the rule and procedure in regard to reconstruction of the record of the trial court proceedings.Â  Our law places the burden upon the circuit judge to utilize discretion in the reconstruction proceeding.Â  The ruling of the circuit court judge will only be reversed in the event of an abuse of discretion.\r\nIn China:\r\nThe defendant objects to the fact that the trial judge considered the affidavits of plaintiff's counsel and the court reporter in determining what transpired. The trial of this case was held in January 1965 and the affidavits were signed in April and May of 1967, over two years after the trial. The defendant contends that the long lapse of time since the trial should have rendered the affidavits of little probative value, especially in view of the inability of the trial judge and defendant's counsel to recall what took place and the statement by the trial judge in his previous order that the verdict of the jury apparently exonerated the defendant of the charge of recklessness. We find no error in the action taken by the trial judge.\r\nWhere there is a disagreement as to what the record on appeal should contain, the duty and responsibility of settling the question rests upon the trial judge. \r\n. . . \r\nIn doing so he properly considered the affidavits of counsel and the court reporter as to what happened. The fact that the notes of the court reporter were lost and the trial judge had no independent recollection of the incident under inquiry did not preclude him from determining the question upon the basis of the affidavits submitted. Their probative value was for him to determine and his conclusions thereabout are binding on the court.\r\n251 S.C. at 333-34, 162 S.E.2d at 278 (internal citations omitted).\r\nWhitehead inculcates:\r\nPetitioner sought a remand to reconstruct the record of his first PCR hearing.Â  See China v. Parrott, supra.Â  We now grant his motion and remand the case to Jasper County for a hearing to reconstruct the first PCR record.Â  This hearing should be held within 45 days of the date this opinion is filed.Â  If the circuit court judge determines that reconstruction is not possible, he shall notify this Court and the parties within 15 days of the reconstruction hearing.Â  If the record is reconstructed, the parties shall notify this Court and the matter will proceed according to King v. State, supra.\r\n352 S.C. at 221, 574 S.E.2d at 203.\r\nOur supreme court in Koon succinctly instructs as to the judicial duty if the original trial record is deficient:\r\nWhere a transcript has been lost or destroyed, a court may remand to have the record reconstructed.Â  See Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 574 S.E.2d 200 (2002); China v. Parrott, 251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d 276 (1968) (trial judge reconstructed the record where court reporter records were unavailable).\r\n358Â  S.C. at 367, 595 S.E.2d at 460.\r\nFinally, this court edifies in Dolive:\r\nAppellants first contend the circuit court erred in allowing additional matters into the record on appeal arguing that, while Title 5 zoning cases allow supplementation of the record, there is no such provision for Title 6 zoning cases under which this case falls.Â  However, this case does not involve supplementation of the record.Â  The circuit court merely allowed J.E.E. to reconstruct the record by means of an affidavit.Â  In China v. Parrott, 251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d 276 (1968), our Supreme Court held, where portions of stenographic notes of a trial proceeding were lost before they were transcribed by the court reporter, it was not error for the trial judge to consider affidavits of plaintiff's counsel and the court reporter in determining what transpired.Â  Based on the fact that this matter has already been twice appealed to the circuit court and the loss of the vital portions of the record appear to have been through no fault of the respondent, we find no error in the circuit court's ruling allowing for reconstruction of the record.\r\n308 S.C. at 383, 418 S.E.2d at 321.\r\nThe vagaries and vicissitudes of a reconstruction hearing are demonstrated with clarity in the case sub judice.Â  The reconstructed record contains:Â  \r\n1.

Breeden, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. Â 4233\r\nHeard March 7, 2007 â€“ Filed April 16, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia and C. Bradley Hutto, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman M. Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â Â  William Smoak Fairey was tried in absentia and without counsel for the charge of obtaining goods and monies under false pretenses.Â  A jury found Fairey guilty, and the judge sentenced him to eight years in prison, suspended to five years service and four years probation.Â  On motion to vacate sentence and for a new trial, the judge reduced Faireyâ€™s sentence to eight years, suspended to four years service and four years of probation with a special condition to make restitution.Â  Fairey appeals arguing: (1) the trial court erred in holding trial in his absence, because he was not given proper notice of his trial or warned of possible trial in absentia; (2) the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial because he was not cautioned against proceeding pro se and thereby wrongfully denied the right to counsel; and (3) the trial court erred in refusing to give him access to grand jury documents.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 1997, Fairey contracted with Scott Rudisill, a small business owner, to develop and install a computer system for Rudisillâ€™s business and personal records.Â  On July 7, 1997, Fairey approached Rudisill for a $25,000 loan.Â  Fairey told Rudisill that he was offered a job with the White House as a liaison to President Bill Clinton, but he had to overnight $25,000 to secure the position.Â  Fairey explained that the money would be immediately refunded once he began his new position and promised to immediately return the money to Rudisill. Â Rudisill agreed to loan the money and had Fairey sign a promissory note for $25,000 with interest on unpaid principal, at a rate of ten percent.Â  The note indicated all monies were to be paid on October 7, 1997.Â  Before October 7, Rudisill called Fairey a couple times regarding the money; each time Fairey indicated that he would have no problems repaying the loan.Â  However, Fairey did not repay Rudisill on October 7, and when Rudisill contacted Fairey, he said that he would deposit the money in Rudisillâ€™s account but never did.\r\nOn January 26, 1998, Fairey was served with an arrest warrant for obtaining goods and monies under false pretenses.Â  Following Faireyâ€™s arrest, Fairey signed a bond sheet, wherein under the heading, â€œAcknowledgment By Defendant,â€ it indicated he understood a trial would proceed in his absence if he failed to appear.Â  On July 23, 1998, notice was sent to Faireyâ€™s attorney, Richard Weldon, that the charge against Fairey had been dismissed.\r\nOn June 23, 2001, Fairey was indicted by a grand jury for the same charge of obtaining goods and monies under false pretenses.Â  In June 2002, Weldon made a motion to be relieved as counsel for Fairey.Â  Weldon cited substantial disagreement with Fairey regarding trial strategy, Faireyâ€™s failure to pay Weldon for his services, and Faireyâ€™s desire to proceed pro se as reasons for withdrawal.Â  Weldon additionally stated Fairey was given reasonable warning of Weldonâ€™s intent to withdraw if Fairey did not pay Weldon for his services.Â  On July 23, 2002, the trial judge granted Weldonâ€™s motion to withdraw as counsel.Â  The order stated, â€œ[i]t appears to the court that there is just cause for granting the motion and that Doak Fairey consents to the requested withdrawal as signified by the signature of Doak Fairey on the attached consent form.â€Â  Also in the order, Fairey was instructed that he needed to keep the court informed as to where papers should be served, had the obligation to retain counsel if he desired, and had the responsibility to prepare for trial.Â  \r\nOn August 22, 2002, Fairey informed the solicitor of a change of address: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Consent Order regarding â€œkeeping the court informed as to where notices, pleadings, and other papers may be served,â€ I am informing the court of my new address. Â All notices, pleadings and other papers should be delivered to:\r\n  \r\nDoak Fairey\r\n31545 Vaca Drive\r\nCastaic, California 91384\r\n  \r\nThis address change is valid immediately\r\nSo that I might adequately prepare for trial, please assure that any and all future correspondence is sent to this address. \r\n\r\nOn September 8, 2002, after being sent a subpoena to his former Florida address, Fairey informed the court and solicitor, once again, that the California address was the correct address to send all correspondence.Â  This letter stated:\r\n\r\nToday, I received VIA FAX a copy of a subpoena relating to my case.Â  This document was sent to my old address in Sarasota, Florida.\r\nIn my previous correspondence (copy attached), I informed you and the court of my address change.Â  I followed the procedure as spelled out in your correspondence of 7/30/02.Â  You have chosen to ignore the Rule, and your own written procedure, and failed to properly send documents to me at my address . . . .Â  Please assure that all correspondence and information for trial is sent to my new address:\r\nDoak Fairey\r\n31545 Vaca Drive\r\nCastaic, CA 91384Â  \r\n\r\nOn March 10, 2003, Fairey made a motion to quash the indictment.Â  In his motion to quash, Fairey listed his addresses as:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      31545 Vaca\r\n        Drive&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      5629 Boulder Blvd\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Castaic, CA 91384&nbsp;\r\n      Sarasota, FL 34233\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      941-284-5896\r\n       (temporary address)\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe motion was signed, â€œDefendant pro se.â€Â  (emphasis in original).Â  The motion listed as reasons to quash the indictment: (1) the State failed to provide defendant with a preliminary hearing; (2) the State failed to produce documents related to his previously dismissed charge; and (3) the State failed to produce documents relating to the 2001 grand jury indictment.Â  \r\nA hearing on the motion to quash was held on March 24, 2003.Â  Fairey appeared at the hearing without counsel and proceeded to represent himself. Â Fairey complained that the State possessed documents relating to the case that was originally dismissed in July 1998.Â  Fairey â€œrequested memorialization of the Grand Jury proceedings in this caseâ€ and explained that he was â€œtrying to determine . . . exactly what the Grand Jury saw, what they heardâ€ because of the belief that they could not review evidence relating to the previously dismissed case.Â  Fairey based his argument on an expungement statute, S.C. Code Â§ 17-1-40, which requires the expungement of certain documents after a charge is dismissed.Â  In response the State noted that Fairey was directly indicted by the grand jury after the earlier dismissal of the charge, and â€œ[t]here is no evidence that I could produce to him of the Grand Jury proceeding other than a certified copy of an indictment.â€ Â Further, the State explained that the process of destroying documents provided for in the expungement statute was not an automatic process once a case is dismissed. Â Rather, a defendant must file a motion to have his record expunged and the court sign an order directing the State to destroy the documents relating to the dismissed case. Â During the hearing Fairey made a motion to dismiss and afterward filed the motion to dismiss with the court, indicating Fairey as a pro se defendant and listing a Florida address.Â  \r\nOn March 31, 2003, the judge denied Faireyâ€™s motion to quash on the following reasons: (1) Faireyâ€™s right to a preliminary hearing was extinguished by virtue of the fact his case had been presented to the Grand Jury; (2) Faireyâ€™s reliance on a expungement statute in regard to the expungement of the 1998 documents was misplaced in this case: (3) failure to comply with discovery was not remedied through the quashing of an indictment; and (4) there was no merit to Faireyâ€™s allegation regarding the validity of the Grand Jury proceeding.Â  The judge also reinstated Faireyâ€™s previous bond.Â  The order notified Fairey: â€œ[t]he defendant is required to appear at the call of his case by the State and shall keep the Court and the State advised of any changes in his address.â€Â  The court order was sent to Fairey at the temporary Florida address provided in the motion to quash.Â  \r\nThe solicitorâ€™s office subpoenaed Fairey to appear in the Conway Judicial Building from July 9 through 23, 2004.Â  The subpoena, dated June 21, 2004, listed Faireyâ€™s California address and a Myrtle Beach address.Â  The case was called on July 21, 2004, but Fairey did not appear.Â  At the hearing, the administrative assistant for the solicitorâ€™s office testified the subpoena was sent to: (1) the California address because it was the last official address provided by Fairey in his August 22 and September 8 letters; and (2) the Myrtle Beach address because it was the address provided in Faireyâ€™s original bond form.Â  After the solicitor presented evidence that Fairey received notice of the date and time of his trial, the court found that the solicitor made an adequate showing Fairey received notice and the trial proceeded in Faireyâ€™s absence.Â  \r\nOn July 21, 2004, the trial court sentenced Fairey to eight years imprisonment, suspended to five years service and four years probation.Â  Fairey was also fined $128.75 and ordered to pay restitution of $25,000. \r\nFairey was apprehended in Florida and brought in for sentencing on October 21, 2004.Â  Faireyâ€™s counsel moved for a vacation of his conviction and new trial based on the lack of notice and because Fairey was tried without counsel.Â  The judge denied the motion finding Fairey adequately and legally waived his right to counsel and his right to be present at the trial.Â  The judge then reduced Faireyâ€™s sentence to eight years, suspended to four years service and four years probation with a special condition to make restitution to Rudisill in the amount of $25,000.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Notice and Trial in Absentia \r\nFairey argues that the trial court erred in holding his trial in his absence, where the State failed to show: (1) he received notice of his right to be present; and (2) he was warned the trial would proceed in his absence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAlthough the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of an accused to be present at every stage of his trial, this right may be waived.Â  State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 401, 360 S.E.2d 706, 711 (1987); Â Ellis v. State, 267 S.C. 257, 260, 227 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1976).Â  Rule 16 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:\r\n\r\n[A] person indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried in his absence upon a finding by the court that such person has received notice of his right to be present and that a warning was given that the trial would proceed in his absence upon a failure to attend the court.\r\n\r\nRule 16, SCRCrimP.Â  \r\nHowever, a waiver of such an important right is permitted only in limited circumstances.Â  Aiken v. Koontz, 368 S.C. 542, 547, 629 S.E.2d 686, 689 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Therefore, before a defendant may be tried in absentia, the trial court must determine a defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial, making findings of fact on the record that the defendant (1) received notice of his right to be present and (2) was warned that the trial would proceed in his absence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Notice \r\nâ€œNotice of the term of court for which the trial is set constitutes sufficient notice to enable a criminal defendant to make an effective waiver of his right to be present.â€Â  Aiken v. Koontz, 368 S.C. 542, 547, 629 S.E.2d 686, 689 (Ct. App. 2006). Â However, if the record does not reveal that the defendant was afforded notice of his trial, the resulting conviction in absentia cannot stand.Â  State v. Jackson, 290 S.C. 435, 436, 351 S.E.2d 167, 167 (1986).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the solicitor subpoenaed Fairey to appear in court from July 9 through July 23, 2004. Â Notice was sent to Fairey at both the California address he forwarded to the solicitorâ€™s office in the August 22 and September 8 letters and the North Myrtle Beach address provided in the reinstated bond.Â  Fairey failed to appear in court when his name was called.Â  The judge heard the solicitor on notice to Fairey and made a determination on the record that: (1) the State made an adequate showing that the defendant was placed on notice of the date and time of his trial; (2) failure of the defendant to appear was willful; and (3) the defendant had â€œnotice that he had a right to be present and that if he wasnâ€™t present he would be tried in his absence.â€ \r\nFairey argues that since the solicitor â€œinexplicablyâ€ did not send notice of his trial to Florida, but rather to California, Fairey did not receive notice of his right to be present.Â  Fairey further bolsters his argument claiming that because the solicitor â€œhad been sending legal mail to [Fairey] in Florida since the March 2003 hearing,â€ the solicitor should have sent notice of his trial to his Florida address.Â  However, the record indicates that Faireyâ€™s permanent address for service of notice was his California address, whereas the Florida address was only a â€œtemporary addressâ€ used by Fairey during a period in 2003. \r\nOn July 23, 2002, when the court granted Faireyâ€™s counselâ€™s motion to withdraw, the court warned Fairey that he had â€œthe burden of keeping the court informed as to where notices, pleadings and other papers may be served.â€Â  At that time it was noted that service of notice would be sent to Fairey at his home address in Sarasota, Florida.Â  However, in the August 22 letter Fairey informed the solicitor of a change of address, listing his California address. Â And again, in the September 8 letter Fairey informed the court and solicitor that the California address was the correct address to send all correspondence.Â  \r\nFairey never sent a letter to the court or solicitor to inform them of a change of address from the California address to the Florida address as he did in his August 22 and September 8 letters.Â  Thus, the last official, permanent address provided to the court and solicitor by Fairey was his California address.Â  Merely because Fairey listed a â€œtemporary addressâ€ on his motion to quash and motion to dismiss over a year prior to his trial does not notify the court and solicitor of a change of address so as to direct where all notices, pleadings and other papers may be served.Â  Therefore, notice of Faireyâ€™s trial was properly sent to California, and as such, Fairey was placed on notice of his right to be present at his July 2004 trial.Â  \r\n B.&nbsp; Trial in Absentia \r\nFurther, Fairey contends he was not warned his trial would proceed in his absence.Â  A bond form that provides notice that a defendant can be tried in absentia may serve as the requisite notice.Â  Aiken v. Koontz, 368 S.C. 542, 548, 629 S.E.2d 686 689-90 (Ct. App. 2006); Â State v. Goode, 299 S.C. 479, 385 S.E.2d 844 (1989).Â  \r\nIn Aiken v. Koontz the defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license, and when he posted bond the day after his arrest, he was provided an order specifying methods and conditions of release. Â 368 S.C. at 547-48, 629 S.E.2d at 689. Â The defendant also signed a form entitled, â€œAcknowledgement by Defendant,â€ which read â€œI understand and have been informed that I have a right and obligation to be present at trial and should I fail to attend the court, the trial will proceed in my absence.â€Â  Id. at 548, 629 S.E.2d at 689.Â  Thus, this court held that Koontz was warned a failure to appear would result in a trial in his absence and that he understood the warning and obligation by signing the â€œAcknowledgement.â€ Â Id.  \r\nIn January 1998, Fairey signed a bond sheet wherein under the heading, â€œACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY DEFENDANT,â€ it reads: â€œI understand and have been informed that I have a right and obligation to be present at trial and should I fail to attend the court, the trial will proceed in my absence.â€Â  As in Koontz, Faireyâ€™s signature on the â€œAcknowledgementâ€ served as a warning that he would be tried in his absence, and therefore, Fairey understood such warning.Â  \r\nRelying on State v. Goode, Fairey contends because the indictment, for which the bond was signed, was dismissed, it was thereby extinguished and could not serve as notice to appear.Â  In State v. Goode the defendant was arrested for breaking into a motor vehicle and released on bond.Â  299 S.C. at 480, 385 S.E.2d at 845.Â  He signed a bond form that provided him notice that his trial would proceed in his absence if he failed to appear. Â Id.Â  He failed to appear and a bench warrant was issued. Â He was subsequently indicted for both breaking into a motor vehicle and grand larceny and was tried in his absence for both charges. Â Id. at 481, 385 S.E.2d at 845. Â The supreme court held that Goode did not have adequate notice that he would be tried for the newly indicted crime, grand larceny, in his absence since the crime was not listed on the bond signed by Goode. Â Id. at 842-43, 385 S.E.2d at 846.Â  However, because Goode signed the bond form related to the charge of breaking into a vehicle the court held that he had notice he would be tried for that crime in his absence. Â Id. at 842, 385 S.E.2d at 846.\r\nWhile Faireyâ€™s original indictment was dismissed, he was directly indicted for the same crime on June 26, 2001, and the 1998 bond was reinstated on July 23, 2002 by court order.Â  Therefore, the 1998 bond was in effect and thereby served as notice to Fairey that he would be tried in his absence. \r\nII.&nbsp; Right to Counsel \r\nFairey also argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial because he was denied the right to counsel.Â  We disagree\r\nâ€œThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right to counsel.â€Â  State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 243, 584 S.E.2d 432, 437 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  â€œOf all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have.â€Â  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 654 (1984).Â  However, this right may be waived.Â  State v. Gill, 355 S.C. at 243, 584 S.E.2d at 437. Â This court has explained that â€œa defendant may surrender his right to counsel through (1) waiver by affirmative, verbal request; (2) waiver by conduct; and (3) forfeiture.â€Â  State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 262, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nIn this case we confine our analysis to the question of whether Fairey waived this right by his conduct.Â  A defendant may waive his right to counsel through his conduct. Â Id. at 263, 584 S.E.2d at 135 (citations omitted). Â Deliberate and dilatory conduct on behalf of a defendant can suffice to waive the right to counsel.Â  State v. Pride, Op. No. 4208 (S.C. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 69);Â  see also State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, 128, 245 S.E.2d 606, 608 (1978) (holding a waiver of the right to counsel can be inferred from a defendantâ€™s actions).\r\nIn support of his argument, Fairey relies on our decision in Thompson.Â  However, neither Thompson nor our more recent case of State v. Roberson, 371 S.C. 334, 638 S.E.2d 93 (Ct. App. 2006) requires reversal of Faireyâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  Rather, we are guided by this courtâ€™s recent decision in State v. Pride.Â  As discussed in Pride, there is a crucial difference between the facts in Prideâ€™s and Faireyâ€™s cases and those of Thompson and Roberson.Â  \r\nIn Pride, the defendant was indicted for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute (PWID) and PWID within proximity of a school. Â On the first day of the term of court for which Pride was originally scheduled to go to trial, a public defender, William All, was appointed to represent Pride.Â  On that same day Pride was also represented by a private attorney, Fletcher Smith.Â  Smith subsequently withdrew as counsel and All was appointed.Â  Pride failed to appear for two scheduled appointments with All.Â  All sent letters to Pride indicating the date of trial and that he could not adequately represent Pride without speaking to him.Â  Pride scheduled another appointment, which he again failed to appear for and offered no explanation.Â  Eventually when Pride and All met, Pride indicated Smith was again representing him.Â  However, when All contacted Smithâ€™s office, the administrative assistant indicated that Smith did not represent Pride.Â  On the morning of the trial Pride did not appear, and Smithâ€™s office informed the solicitor that Smith did not represent Pride. Â The solicitor moved to have Pride tried in absentia, and All was relieved as counsel.Â  The judge specifically found Pride waived his right to counsel by conduct and Pride was then tried and convicted for the drug offenses.Â  When Pride eventually appeared before the judge for sentencing, All appeared at the hearing and indicated he could â€œperfect an appeal for [Pride] if he wants to raise the issue of whether or not he shouldnâ€™t have been tried in his absence.â€Â  The judge imposed his sentencing. \r\nOn appeal, Pride argued the circuit court erred in relieving All as his counsel and proceeding with the trial in his absence, contending that his conduct was insufficient to establish that he waived his right to counsel.Â  This court acknowledged the significance of Thompson and Roberson as it applied to Prideâ€™s case but found a â€œcrucial differenceâ€ between the facts in his case and those of Thompson and Roberson.Â  The defendants in both Thompson and Roberson were not represented by counsel until the sentencing hearing.Â  This court concluded if it were to find the defendants in Thompson and Roberson waived their right to counsel it would be based solely on their failure to appear for trial.Â  On the other hand, Pride not only failed to appear for trial, but he was afforded a public defender whom he failed to cooperate with prior to his trial.Â  He was also given additional time to prepare for the trial, failed to appear for his scheduled appointments with the public defender and failed to offer any assistance in preparation for his defense.Â  Further, he gave assurances to the public defender, up to the day before his trial, that a private attorney would represent him, yet was aware that this private attorney was relieved as counsel.Â  Based on Prideâ€™s actions, this court found that it was not only Prideâ€™s failure to appear for trial but also â€œPrideâ€™s deliberate and dilatory conduct [which were] sufficient to waive his right to counsel.â€Â  State v. Pride, Op. No. 4208 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 20, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 69). \r\nIn this case, just as in Pride, Fairey was originally represented by counsel, and it was because of his own conduct and failure to cooperate with his counsel that he failed to be represented at the time of his trial.Â  Fairey hired private counsel, Weldon, and had ample opportunities to meet with him and discuss the case.Â  At some point in his representation, Fairey had a disagreement with Weldon as to the fundamental representation and trial strategies and failed to pay Weldon for his services even after a â€œreasonable warningâ€ that Weldon would withdraw.Â  Finally, Fairey desired to represent himself pro se and signed a consent form agreeing to relieve Weldon.Â  \r\nFrom the date the court granted Weldonâ€™s motion to be relieved, Fairey was aware of his duties and obligation as a pro se litigant and was alternatively instructed to hire counsel.Â  Fairey failed to hire another attorney and proceeded to represent himself.Â  Fairey was aware of his obligations and seemed knowledgeable about the legal system, as he maintained contact with the court and solicitor, made two requests to produce to the solicitor and filed various pro se motions.Â  Further, his statements and conduct during proceedings reflected a familiarity with the workings of the legal system and the options legally available to him.Â  The circuit court found:\r\n\r\n[Fairey] had been acting as his attorney for some time, making erudite motions and other things. Â Itâ€™s not like we had some ignorant person here that didnâ€™t know anything, we had a very intelligent person here acting as his own attorney. Â And asking that notices be sent to him and not his attorney. Â To be sent to him. Â He knew he was acting as his attorney.\r\n\r\nYet, during that period, Fairey also engaged in delay tactics.Â  He moved throughout the country, making service and notice difficult for the solicitor.Â  In the instances the solicitor was able to track Faireyâ€™s whereabouts and serve notice, Fairey made motions to continue, based on the inconvenience of appearing in South Carolina on the noticed dates.Â  The solicitor agreed to Faireyâ€™s motions and continuances were granted.Â  When the solicitor sent Fairey a certified copy of his indictment, a consent order for a personal recognizance bond and an acknowledgement for the receipt of the indictment, Fairey failed to sign and return any of the items.Â  Faireyâ€™s tactics further delayed the case and required the aforementioned items be addressed at a later hearing in March 2003.Â  Based on Faireyâ€™s actions, we find Fairey engaged in deliberate and dilatory conduct sufficient to waive his right to counsel.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Grand Jury Documents\r\nFairey argues the trial court erred by refusing to grant his request for grand jury documents to prepare for his defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Faireyâ€™s written motion to quash and at the hearing on the motion, Fairey claimed the solicitor failed to comply with his discovery requests for documents memorializing the grand jury proceeding in his case.Â  Fairey contended that documents relating to his previously dismissed case should have been expunged and therefore not reviewed by the grand jury. Â In his March 31, 2003 order the judge denied Faireyâ€™s motion to quash finding that Faireyâ€™s reliance on the expungement statute was misplaced and that the failure to comply with discovery requests was not remedied through the quashing of an indictment.Â  Fairey failed to challenge either ruling and therefore they are the law of the case.Â  State v. Sampson, 317 S.C. 423, 427, 454 S.E.2d 721, 723 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case);Â  Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 293 n. 2, 592 S.E.2d 315, 318 n.2 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Faireyâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4234","title":"Eastern Savings Bank v.

Â \r\nOn November 3, 2005, the Bank inquired with Hook in regard to the bid from Sanders.Â  Hook then contacted the court, whereupon she learned the Property involved a deficiency judgment and immediately recognized she had made a mistake in her earlier bidding instructions to her assistant.Â  \r\nOn November 9, 2005, the Bank filed a motion to vacate and set aside the sale to Sanders.Â  The Bank argued the low sales price, along with the misunderstanding and circumstances that caused the Bank to mistakenly bid only $100,000.00, dictated the sale be set aside.Â  Additionally, the Bank asserted the price Sanders paid was so low as to shock the conscience of the court.\r\nThe master held a hearing on the matter in January 2006.Â  As stated in the masterâ€™s order, Hook â€œcandidly admitted that she made a mistake in her bid instructions and that no one else was responsible for the error.Â  She stated that the sale was properly held and that no third party interfered with bidding.â€Â  \r\nTestimony and other evidence provided values of the Property ranging from $324,940.00 to $900,000.00.Â  The assistant vice-president for the Bank testified that despite Bank authorizing only $550,000.00 as its highest bid, he valued the Property at $700,000.00 for lending purposes.Â  Although the Rouses never received an offer, the home had been marketed for sale prior to foreclosure and was listed for as low as $625,000.00.Â  Renee Bolos, the real estate agent who first represented the Rouses, stated she estimated the Property to be worth $900,000.00. Â Rusty Johnson, a real estate agent who later attempted to sell the Property, valued it at $750,000.00.Â  After listing the Property at this price for six months, the amount was reduced to $600,000.00. Â Â Nevertheless, Johnson was unable to generate any offers. Â When the Rouses attempted to sell the Property at private auction with a reserve price of $650,000.00, the highest bid received was $350,000.00.Â  The county tax appraisal for the home was $324,940.00.\r\nThe master found the value of the Property to be $550,000.00.Â  Although recognizing the sales price was below market value, he stated that he did not believe it to be so inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court.Â  Further, the master determined it was by mistake on the part of the bidder on the Bankâ€™s behalf, not any conduct by the sales officer or other bidder, that caused the winning bid to be less than the actual value of the Property. Â Accordingly, the master denied the Bankâ€™s motion to vacate and set aside the sale.Â  The Bank filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  The master denied this motion.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity. Â Our scope of review of a case heard by a master who enters a final judgment is to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€ Â Hayne Federal Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997) (internal citations omitted).Â  However, the determination of whether a judicial sale should be set aside is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Â Investors Sav. Bank v. Phelps, 303 S.C. 15, 17, 397 S.E.2d 780, 781 (Ct. App. 1990) (citing Bonney v. Granger, 300 S.C. 362, 387 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 1990)). Â The review of a judicial sale is equitable in nature and within the discretion of the trial court. Fed. Natâ€™l Mortgage Assâ€™n v. Brooks,304 S.C. 506, 512, 405 S.E.2d 604, 607 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing Spillers v. Clay, 233 S.C. 99, 102, 103 S.E.2d 759, 760 (1958)). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Bank contends the master erred in failing to grant its motion to set aside and vacate the sale.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhere a mortgagee has sought a deficiency judgment, law requires the foreclosure sale held open for thirty days after the initial sale date. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-720 (2005).Â  The South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\nIn all judicial sales of real estate for the foreclosure of mortgages and sales in execution the bidding shall not be closed upon the day of sale but shall remain open until the thirtieth day after such sale, exclusive of the day of sale. Â Within such thirty day period any person other than the highest bidder at the sale or any representative thereof in foreclosure and execution suits may enter a higher bid upon complying with the terms of sale by making any necessary deposit as a guaranty of his good faith, and thereafter within such period any person, other than such highest bidder at the sale or any representative thereof, in foreclosure suits may in like manner raise the last highest bid, and the successful purchaser shall be deemed to be the person who submitted the last highest bid within such period and made the necessary deposit or guaranty. Â But the mortgagee or his representative shall enter such bid as he desires at the time the sale is made, and he and all persons acting in his behalf shall be precluded from entering any other bid in any amount at any other time except the single or last bid made by him or in his behalf at the sale. . . .\r\nThe bidding shall be reopened by the officer making the sale on the thirtieth day after the sale, exclusive of the day of the sale, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon and the bidding shall be allowed to continue until the property shall be knocked down in the usual custom of auction to the successful highest bidder complying with the terms of sale. . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-720 (2005).Â  Thus, â€œ[t]he mortgagee must enter his bid at the time the sale is made and is precluded from entering any other bid after his last bid at the initial sale. Â This effectively forces the mortgagee to enter his highest and best bid at the initial sale.â€Â  27 S.C. Juris. Manner of Sale Â§ 128 (1996) (internal citation omitted).\r\nâ€œA judicial sale should not be set aside except for cogent reasons. Â The purpose of the law and of the proceedings in which a sale has been decreed is that it shall be final.â€Â  Spillers v. Clay, 233 S.C. 99, 104, 103 S.E.2d 759, 761-62 (1958). Â â€œAs has been said time and again in cases involving the setting aside of judicial sales, it is the policy of the Courts to uphold such sales when regularly made, and when it can be done without violating principle or doing injustice . . . .â€ Â Henry v. Blakely, 216 S.C. 13, 18, 56 S.E.2d 581, 583 (1949). Â Our courts zealously insure judicial sales be openly and freely conducted and nothing be allowed to chill the bidding.Â  Howell v. Gibson,208 S.C. 19, 31, 37 S.E.2d 271, 276 (1946).\r\nâ€œ[T]he rule is well settled that inadequacy of price, unless so gross as to shock the conscience of the court, or accompanied by other circumstances warranting the interference of the court, will not justify the setting aside of a judicial sale.â€Â  Spillers, 233 S.C. 99, 104, 103 S.E.2d 759, 761 (citing Brownlee v. Miller, 208 S.C. 252, 37 S.E.2d 658 (1946)).Â  â€œ[M]ere inadequacy of price, unaccompanied by other circumstances which would invoke the exercise of the Courtâ€™s discretion is not sufficient, unless, perhaps, it is so great as to raise a presumption of fraud or to shock the conscience of the Court.â€ Â Henry, 216 S.C. at 18, 56 S.E.2d at 583.Â  â€œWhere unfair means have not been employed to prevent competition at a judicial sale, mere inadequacy of price is no ground for setting [the sale] aside.â€Â  Ex parte Cooley,69 S.C. 143, 154-55, 48 S.E. 92, 95 (1904).Â  Thus, a judicial sale can be set aside for two reasons: (1) if the inadequacy of the price is so gross as to shock the conscience of the court; or (2) if the price is inadequate and this inadequacy is accompanied by other circumstances that warrant the interference of the court.Â  \r\nI. Circumstances Impeaching the Fairness of the Transaction \r\nWhen an inadequacy of price exists and is the result of action by the officer selling the property or successful bidder, and that action could not have been reasonably anticipated by the party for whose benefit the property was being sold, the court should provide relief by setting aside the sale.Â  See Henry, 216 S.C. at 19, 56 S.E.2d at 583. Â â€œ[T]he circumstances impeaching the fairness of the transaction should relate to the conduct of the officer making the sale . . . or to the conduct of the purchaser participating in the attempt to stifle competition or affected with notice thereof . . . .â€ Â Â Appeal of Paslay, 230 S.C. 55, 61, 94 S.E.2d 57, 59-60 (1956) (quoting Ex parte Cooley, 69 S.C. 143, 155, 48 S.E. 92, 96 (1904)).Â  If neither the officer making the sale nor the purchaser contributed to the mistake of a party intending to bid higher, and the sale was fair and regularly conducted, simply because a party intended to bid higher, but neglected to do so, or was prevented by a mistake, is not a sufficient ground for setting aside a judicial sale.Â  Id. at 154, 48 S.E. at 95; see also Howell, 208 S.C. at 33, 37 S.E.2d at 276 (declining to set aside the sale where a plan to bid did not succeed, but its failure was due to no fault of the master, auctioneer, the winning bidder or any other person connected with the sale, but was due to the negligence or fault of the party complaining).\r\nIn Appeal of Paslay, 230 S.C. 55, 94 S.E.2d at 57 (1956), the appellant alleged he had been prepared to bid at least $1,000.00 for property that sold for $450.00.Â  The appellant instructed his lawyer to bid as such; however, the attorney was prevented from attending the sale as a result of the mechanical failure of his automobile.Â  Noting counselâ€™s explanation for his absence did not involve the actions of the selling officer, the South Carolina Supreme Court found the circumstances did not warrant vitiating the sale. Â Â Id. at 58, 94 S.E.2d at 58. Â \r\nIn Spillers, where the officer conducting the sale deviated from the usual sales procedure, the Supreme Court found the claim of misapprehension and excusable mistake on the part of counsel was in relation to the conduct of the sale and accordingly affirmed the setting aside of the sale.Â  233 S.C. 99, 105, 103 S.E.2d 759, 762 (1958).Â  Distinguishing the facts of Spillers and Paslay, the court enunciated:\r\n\r\nDistinction between that case and this is readily apparent. Â There no factor was present for which the selling officer had any responsibility; here the claim of misapprehension and excusable mistake on the part of counsel was in relation to the conduct of the sale.\r\n. . .\r\nIn the case at bar Judge McGowan concluded from all of the evidence that the auctioneer had probably been overhasty in knocking the property down to Mr. Spillers, and that under all the circumstances Mr. Clayâ€™s misapprehension of the final bid was excusable. These conclusions, together with his further finding that the property is worth much more than the price at which it was knocked down, that the parties to the cause were ready to bid a much higher figure, and that to permit completion of the sale at the price bid by Mr. Spillers would result in injustice to the partitioners, are not without support in the evidence.\r\n\r\nId. at 105, 103 S.E.2d 762.\r\nIn the case sub judice, neither the officer presiding over the sale, Sanders, nor any other buyer made a mistake or perpetrated a fraud.Â  The Bank demanded the deficiency judgment and therefore knew, or should have known, the sale would follow the deficiency procedure.Â  Hook, whose actions are imputable to the Bank, testified the mistake was solely her own.Â  Assuming, arguendo, the selling price to Sanders was inadequate (but not so great as to shock the conscience), there are simply no factors attributable to the selling officer or successful bidder or other circumstances warranting the sale be set aside.Â  Accordingly, the master correctly found the judicial sale should not be vitiated.Â  \r\nII. Inadequacy of Price as to Shock the Conscience\r\nThe Bank argues the master incorrectly determined the value of the Property and therefore erred in finding the final bid was not so inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court because.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough the master found the Property to be worth $550,000.00, the Bank urged the master to set the value of the Property at $750,000.00.Â  We find no error in the masterâ€™s valuation.Â  When offered at private auction, the property did not receive a bid remotely close to its $650,000.00 reserve price.Â  Real estate agent Johnson tried for over half a year to sell the property at $750,000.00 and was still unable to sell the property when the Rouses dropped the listing price to $600,000.00.Â  Even the Bankâ€™s own witnesses agree there were copious factors negatively affecting the Propertyâ€™s curb appeal and value.Â  Testimony revealed the house is not in a particularly attractive location but is on a busy thoroughfare with commercial property next door and a trailer across the street, has no yard, remains unfinished, and is over-sized for the area it is located.Â  Chris Johnson, an assistant vice-president at the Bank asseverated, â€œI said bid up to $550,00.00 based on what I consider the value to be at the time and on subsequent events, the fact that it hadnâ€™t yet sold and the list price was down to $600,000.00, so given that situation, I thought if a third party bid that [on] sale, that was a number that we were willing to let the property go.â€Â  The evidence luculently supports the masterâ€™s finding that the Property value be set at $550,000.00.\r\nEven assuming the master should have determined the value of the Property to be $750,000.00, Sanders still paid a third of the value.Â  While this may have been inadequate, it is not so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina has not established a bright line rule for what percentage the sale value must be with respect to the actual value in order to shock the conscience of the court.Â  However, a search of South Carolina jurisprudence reveals only when judicial sales are for less than ten percent of a propertyâ€™s actual value, have our courts consistently held the discrepancy to shock conscience of the court. Â In Investors Sav. Bank v. Phelps, 303 S.C. 15, 19, 397 S.E.2d 780, 782 (Ct. App. 1990), this court affirmed the masterâ€™s decision to set aside a sale where the bid of $510.00 was slightly more than one percent of the original amount of the loan and mortgage.Â  We found that even if the property was worth only a fourth of the amount loaned on it four and a half years earlier, the bid was still only four percent of the value.Â  Id.Â  The court noted New York courts consistently hold foreclosure sale bids of less than ten percent of the value are unconscionably low.Â  Id. (citing Polish Natâ€™l Alliance of Brooklyn, U.S.A. v. White Eagle Hall Co., 470 N.Y.S.2d 642, 649 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983) (â€œ[F]oreclosure sales at prices below 10% of value have consistently been held unconscionably low in this State . . . .â€)).Â  In Poole v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co., 174 S.C. 150, 158, 177 S.E. 24, 28 (1934), the South Carolina Supreme Court set aside a foreclosure sale based, in part, on the fact that the high bid was $500.00 for property worth more than $5,000.00. Â \r\nBy comparison, in Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Graham, 291 S.C. 178, 352 S.E.2d 511 (Ct. App. 1987), this court found the sale price of $48,100.00 for property subsequently appraised at $73,000.00, was not so inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court and affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision not to set aside the sale.Â  The court stated, â€œAlthough the sale price in the instant case was less than the value of the property, it was not so grossly inadequate as to shock . . . .â€Â  Id. at 182, 352 S.E.2d at 513.\r\nIn the present case, the Property would have to be worth more than $2,460,000.00 for the sale price to be less than ten percent of the actual value.Â  None of the Bankâ€™s experts set its worth at more than $900,000.00.Â  Taking the value the Bank asserts the master should have placed on the Property, $750,000.00, the sale price was approximately a third of the actual value.Â  Accordingly, the inadequacy of the price was not so gross as to shock the courtâ€™s conscience. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the master did not err in determining the sale should not be set aside. Â The sale price was less than the value of the Property because of a mistake by the Bankâ€™s counsel, not as a result of conduct by an official conducting the sale or another bidding party.Â  The master correctly determined the inadequacy of the sale was not so gross as to shock the conscience of the court.Â  Therefore, the order of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4235","title":"Collins Holding Corp. v.

(2) breach of Collinsâ€™ location contracts; (3) tortious interference with Collinsâ€™ location contracts; (4) violation of the UTPA; (5) breach of fiduciary duty; and (6) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Collins also requested permanent injunctive relief.Â  \r\nCollins dismissed its causes of action for breach of location contracts, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and at the conclusion of Collinsâ€™ case the trial court dismissed both the breach of employment contract cause of action pertaining to Richard and the request for a permanent injunction.Â  The trial court issued an order entering judgment for the Defibaughs on all of the remaining causes of action.Â  \r\nCollins filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration on the basis that the trial court failed to address Collinsâ€™ assertion that the Defibaughsâ€™ machines were deceptive and harmful to the general public and thus violated the UTPA.Â  The trial court issued an amended order finding the Defibaughsâ€™ machines utilized a technique known as â€œreflexive payout,â€ meaning the owner of the machine can control how much the machine pays back to players over the lifetime of the machine.Â  The machine, unbeknownst to the player, makes adjustments to the gameâ€™s outcome to stay within the payback percentage.Â  The machine simply discards the winning symbol or icon that would have exceeded the allowable payout percentage and selects a symbol that will keep the payout within the predetermined percentage.Â  This is referred to as â€œmorphing.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court found Collins met its burden of demonstrating the machines were misleading and deceptive due to their utilization of reflexive payout.Â  Further, the trial court found because the use of the machines was continuous, ongoing, and capable of repetition, Collins demonstrated an adverse effect on the public.Â  The trial court found Collins suffered ascertainable damages consisting of Collinsâ€™ lost profits during the time period both partiesâ€™ machines were at the same locations.Â  \r\nThe lost profits were determined by taking the weekly average of Collinsâ€™ income earned before the Defibaughsâ€™ games were placed at the location and subtracting the weekly average for the income earned when the Defibaughsâ€™ games were at the same locations.Â  Some weeks, Collinsâ€™ games actually earned more money than they had before the Defibaughsâ€™ games were placed there.Â  Those weeks were not factored into the lost profits calculation.Â  The damages amounted to $107,461.00.Â  The trial court determined the violation was not willful, because Collins failed to demonstrate that the Defibaughs knew that changing the payout percentage would affect the outcome of the games.Â  Therefore, the trial court declined to treble Collinsâ€™ damages.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  The trial courtâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.Â  Chapman&nbsp;v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 567, 211 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1975).Â  This court must determine whether any evidence reasonably supports the factual findings of the trial court.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd., 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 776.Â  Additionally, the appellate court can correct errors of law.Â  Okatie River,\r\nL.L.C. v. Se. Site Prep, L.L.C. 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Defibaughs argue the trial court erred in finding Collins suffered damages under the UTPA.Â  We agree.\r\nThe UTPA declares unlawful the employment of â€œunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1976).Â  Section 39-5-140(a) creates a private right of action in favor of â€œ[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 . . . .â€Â  Additionally, under Section 39-5-140(a), a plaintiff can recover treble damages where â€œthe use or employment of the unfair or deceptive . . . act or practice was\r\na willful or knowing violation of Â§ 39-5-20.â€Â  Noack Enters., Inc. v. Country Corner Interiors of Hilton Head Island, Inc., 290 S.C. 475, 477, 351 S.E.2d 347, 348-49 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nâ€œRecoverable damages include compensation for all injury to plaintiffâ€™s property or business which is the natural and probable consequence of defendantâ€™s wrong.â€ Â Global Prot. Corp. v. Halbersberg, 332 S.C. 149, 159, 503 S.E.2d 483, 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œActual damages under the UTPA include special or consequential damages that are a natural and proximate result of deceptive conduct.â€Â  Id. (citing Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996)).\r\nWhile Collins may have demonstrated some lost profits arising from the Defibaughsâ€™ placement of their machines at the same locations as where Collinsâ€™ machines were placed, Collins did not show that the utilization of reflexive payout on those machines was the cause of any lost revenue.Â  Collinsâ€™ director of operations, Jefferson Gibbons, testified that the primary reason the Defibaughsâ€™ machines hurt Collinsâ€™ business was because the Defibaughsâ€™ machines were easy to play.Â  Gibbons also testified that the Defibaughsâ€™ machines were faster and involved no thinking or skill.Â  The UTPA only creates causes of action in those suffering a loss as a result of a deceptive act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (emphasis added). Â While â€œmorphingâ€ may have affected the players of the games, that feature is not what caused Collinsâ€™ machines to earn less money than before the Defibaughsâ€™ machines were placed at the same locations.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding for Collins on the UTPA cause of action.[1]\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Therefore, we need not consider the Defibaughsâ€™ remaining issues including whether or not â€œmorphingâ€ is deceptive, or Collinsâ€™ argument that its damages should be trebled.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4236","title":"Dropkin v.

Macaulay, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4236\r\nHeard March 6, 2007 â€“ Filed April 16, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDavid H. Berry, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.Â  \r\nErin DuBose Dean, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: Â Kathe Dropkin filed this negligence action against Beachwalk Villas Condominium Association, Inc.Â  Dropkin appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of her motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence per se and her motion for a new trial.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn April 1998, Dropkin vacationed with her family at a Beachwalk condominium on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.Â  As Dropkin left the condominium one night to go to dinner, she slipped and fell down the staircase.Â  Dropkin suffered serious injuries to her hip and incurred $60,000 in medical expenses.Â  Dropkin commenced this action for negligence against Beachwalk.Â  \r\nBeachwalk was constructed in approximately 1980.Â  Prior to trial, the parties stipulated the 1979 Standard Building Code applied at the time of construction.Â  The 1979 Standard Building Code required the staircase to include a handrail located between thirty and thirty-four inches above the stair tread.Â  The parties do not dispute that the handrail failed to meet the code.[1]Â  \r\nAt trial, Dropkin moved for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence per se because the staircase was not code compliant.Â  Dropkin did not move for a directed verdict on the issue of proximate cause.Â  The trial court denied the motion finding the code violation merely evidence of Beachwalkâ€™s violation of its duty of care.Â  The court submitted the case to the jury.\r\nThe verdict form asked, in pertinent part:Â  â€œDo you find that the Defendant, Beachwalk Villas Condominium Association, Inc., was negligent and that this negligence proximately caused the Plaintiffâ€™s injuries?â€Â  Dropkin did not object to the verdict form.Â  The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Beachwalk.Â  Dropkin moved for a new trial, arguing the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict based on negligence per se, or, in the alternative, by failing to charge negligence per se to the jury.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The decision whether to grant a\r\nnew trial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and generally will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 380, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDropkin contends the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict as to her allegation of negligence per se, and erred in failing to grant her post-trial motions, because Beachwalk was negligent as a matter of law.[2]Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nIn order to recover for negligence per se in this case, Dropkin must prove an alleged duty, breach thereof, and the causal connection between Beachwalkâ€™s negligence and her injury before she is entitled to damages.Â  â€œThe finding of a statutory violation [in an action alleging negligence per se], however, does not end the inquiry.Â  The causation of the injury must also be evaluated.â€Â  Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 54, 410 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1991).Â  In Rowe v. Frick, the plaintiff, a young boy injured while crossing a highway, alleged the defendant violated the applicable statute and injured him.Â  250 S.C. 499, 504-05, 159 S.E.2d 47, 50 (1968).Â  Our supreme court found the issue of whether such an alleged breach proximately caused plaintiffâ€™s injury a question for the jury.Â  Id. at 505, 159 S.E.2d at 51.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dropkin requested a directed verdict on the theory of negligence per se, a verdict form combining this issue with the issue of proximate cause was submitted to the jury without objection.Â  The verdict the jury rendered could have been based on the lack of proximate cause.Â  Furthermore, although Dropkin argues there is no evidence supporting a defense verdict on the issue of proximate cause, the record contains evidence from which the jury could conclude the handrail violation was not the proximate cause of Dropkinâ€™s injuries.Â  Dropkinâ€™s own expert witness, Bryan Durig, testified as follows:Â  \r\nCounsel for Beachwalk:Â  Now we all agree here today that the railings . . . are in violation of the standard 1979 Standard Building Code based on the improper height; correct?\r\nMr. Durig:Â  Yes.Â  I mean, in my opinion they are, yes.\r\nCounsel for Beachwalk:Â  But that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean . . . [the] code violation was the proximate . . . cause of Mrs. Dropkinâ€™s fall; correct?Â  \r\nMr. Durig:Â  No, not â€“ not the initiating event of the fall, no.Â  The handrails are there to provide you [sic] once you have a mis-step. Â So uh my comments earlier about the roundness of the stairs and the fact that they were wet and donâ€™t have any traction, thatâ€™s what initiated this event where she slipped and mis-stepped and lost her balance, and the handrails are designed to provide you some assistance in the case that you have that event, and in this case, they didnâ€™t provide them, so she continued to fall down.Â  \r\nSo itâ€™s not the initiating event.Â  Itâ€™s a contributing factor, because they werenâ€™t there to properly help her regain her balance.Â  \r\n\r\nBeachwalkâ€™s expert witness, Allen Campbell, testified as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nCounsel for Beachwalk:Â  All right.Â  And were you able to come up um with â€“ with an opinion, based on a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, uh with regard to the construction of the stairway relative to Mrs. Dropkinâ€™s accident?Â  \r\nMr. Campbell:Â  Yes.Â  \r\nCounsel for Beachwalk:Â  And what â€“ what opinion was that?Â  \r\nMr. Campbell:Â  Based on my review of the stairs, my assessment and reviewing her testimony, based on her own description of â€“ of how she fell, it certainly is my opinion that she slipped on the stairs as she was descending, and the handrail is not an issue.Â  She slipped on the treads, on more than one occasion.Â Â  \r\n\r\nBecause there is evidence to support the verdict on the issue of proximate cause, and the jury returned a general verdict as to the issues of negligence and proximate cause, we must uphold the verdict.Â  Where a case is submitted to the jury on two or more issues and a general verdict is returned, the verdict will be upheld if it is supported by at least one issue.Â  Anderson v. West, 270 S.C. 184, 188, 241 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1978).\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has discussed this rule in detail:Â  \r\n  \r\nâ€˜Under the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, when the jury returns a\r\ngeneral verdict involving two or more issues and its verdict is supported as to at least one issue, the\r\nverdict will not be reversed on appeal.â€™ Â Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 287 S.C. 190, 193, 336 S.E.2d 472, 473-74 (1985). Â The â€œtwo\r\nissueâ€ rule may be applied by appellate courts in a few situations. Â In one situation, when a juryâ€™s\r\ngeneral verdict is supportable by more than one cause of action submitted to it, the [appellate] court will affirm unless the appellant appeals all causes of action. Â See Sierra v. Skelton, 307 S.C. 217, 414 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1991) (trial courtâ€™s decision affirmed where jury returned a general verdict, and appellant only raised abuse of process issue, but failed to raise defamation issue). Â Under a second application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, the appellate court will find it unnecessary to address all the grounds appealed where one requires affirmance. Â See Smoak&nbsp;v. Liebherr-America, Inc., 281 S.C. 420, 315 S.E.2d 116 (1984) (where case was presented to jury on negligence and breach of warranty causes of action, appellate court need not address breach of warranty\r\nexceptions if it finds that verdict was supported by the evidence under the theory of negligence).\r\n\r\nThese two applications of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule are illustrated in the following example: Â A case is submitted to the jury on the issues of defamation and invasion of privacy. Â The jury returns a\r\ngeneral verdict for the plaintiff. Â The defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by failing to direct a\r\nverdict on the defamation issue. Â Under one application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, an appellate court would affirm because defendant has failed to appeal the invasion of privacy issue as well. Â Assuming, however, that the defendant has appealed both issues, the appellate court would affirm on the basis of a second application of the â€œtwo\r\nissueâ€ rule, if either of the two issues supported affirmance.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAnderson v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 419-20, 472 S.E.2d 253, 254-55&nbsp;(1996) (footnote omitted). Â \r\nIn this case, the issue of proximate cause supports affirmance.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to direct a verdict and acted within its discretion in denying Dropkinâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  The order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It is difficult from the record to discern whether a handrail even existed.Â  The staircase was flanked by a tall, solid-surface wall with a flat top on one side and a tall, wooden barrier with a wide, cupped top on the other side.Â  As each was located approximately forty-three inches above the stair tread, neither was at the appropriate height to comply with the code. \r\n[2] Dropkinâ€™s theory of negligence per se was not presented to the jury in the form of a jury instruction.Â  Following the jury charge, Dropkin made no objection to the omission of an instruction on negligence per se. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4237","title":"State v.

Elliott, Special Assistant Attorney General Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia; Â and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Appellant Rebecca Lee-Grigg (â€œLee-Griggâ€) challenges her conviction for forgery, contending the trial court erred in denying her (1) motion for a directed verdict; (2) request to charge the jury on a good faith defense; and (3) request to instruct the jury on use of evidence of good character.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nLee-Grigg worked as the director of MEGS House, a shelter for abused women serving McCormick, Edgefield, Greenwood, and Saluda counties.Â  In that capacity, she arranged for the relocation of an endangered victim to another state. Â Lee-Grigg planned to accompany the victim to assist with the transition.Â  Initially Lee-Grigg sought financial assistance for relocation expenses from the South Carolina Victimâ€™s Assistance Network (â€œSCVANâ€).Â  SCVAN generally provides financial assistance to cover only a victimâ€™s expenses and reimburses mileage at less than the state reimbursement rate.Â  Lee-Grigg found SCVANâ€™s coverage inadequate.Â  Subsequently, she contacted Police Chief Brooks (â€œChiefâ€) of the City of Greenwood (â€œCityâ€) to ask for help.Â  The City furnished a vehicle and a driver to transport the victim.Â  Lee-Grigg accompanied the driver and the victim to facilitate the relocation on October 10-11, 2003.Â  The City paid for fuel and lodging for the driver and victim only; Lee-Griggâ€™s costs were not covered.Â  Lee-Grigg testified the Chief told her she could apply for reimbursement of the expenses the City paid in relocating the victim.Â  Lee-Grigg emphasized the Chief assured her he would not apply for reimbursement of the Cityâ€™s costs. \r\nFollowing the trip, Lee-Grigg submitted documents to SCVAN requesting reimbursement for the Cityâ€™s relocation expenditures.Â  However, she represented those expenditures as her own.Â  Included among the materials Lee-Grigg supplied was a â€œTravel Support Documentâ€ with the following attestation signed by\r\nLee-Grigg:\r\n\r\nI hereby certify or affirm that the above expenses were actually incurred by me as necessary traveling expenses in the performance of my official duties; any meals or lodging included in a conference or convention registration fee have been deducted from this travel claim, conforms with the requirements of local and grant laws, rules and regulations.Â  \r\n\r\nLee-Grigg requested mileage reimbursement in the amount of $189.23 and attached copies of fuel receipts she obtained from the Cityâ€™s driver to support that request.Â  The signature of the driver and the Chiefâ€™s initials that appeared on the original fuel receipts were absent from the copies Lee-Grigg submitted to SCVAN.Â  Lee-Grigg averred she concealed the driverâ€™s signature and the Chiefâ€™s initials in order to obscure any trail that might lead to discovery of the victimâ€™s new location. Â Lee-Grigg additionally enclosed:\r\n\r\nÂ· a receipt for fuel costs incurred on October 8, 2003 involving transportation of the victim from Charleston to Greenwood Â \r\nÂ· copies of meal receipts that obviously included meals other than the victimâ€™s\r\nÂ· a copy of a Holiday Inn receipt for $88.76, paid in full by the Cityâ€™s driver.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, the Cityâ€™s driver contacted SCVAN to inquire about obtaining reimbursement for the same relocation costs.Â  SCVAN identified the potential duplication of reimbursement requests.Â  A SLED investigation ensued leading to Lee-Griggâ€™s indictment and conviction for forgery.Â  Lee-Grigg was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, suspended to one year of probation.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n(1) Did the trial court err in denying Lee-Griggâ€™s motion for a directed verdict when the document in question was a genuine document with a genuine signature, and the State failed to prove the document in question was falsely made, forged or counterfeited?\r\n(2) Did the trial court err in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of good faith?\r\n(3) Did the trial court err in failing to charge the jury on the use of evidence of good character when Lee-Grigg presented testimony of her good character and reputation in the community?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 506, 626 S.E.2d 59, 63 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Thus, an appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.; State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 504 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion. Â State v. Walker, 363 S.C. 643, 653, 623 S.E.2d 122, 127 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who will not be reversed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 230, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nLee-Grigg contends the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to prove all of the statutory elements for the charge of forgery.Â  Specifically, Lee-Grigg alleges the document in question was not falsely made, forged, or counterfeited as required by statute because the document was a genuine document that contained a genuine signature.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648, (2006); State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 41-42, 615 S.E.2d 455, 464 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 271, 580 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 2003). Â A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged. Â State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004) (citing State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003)); State v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 633, 608 S.E.2d 886, 889 (Ct. App. 2005); Padgett, 354 S.C. at 271, 580 S.E.2d at 161.Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court views evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Weston, 367 S.C. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648; State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 101, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005) cert. denied; State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Weston, 367 S.C. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648; Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593, 606 S.E.2d at 478; McKnight, 352 S.C. at 642, 576 S.E.2d at 172; State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 190, 562 S.E.2d 320, 323 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 563, 598 S.E.2d 279, 284 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).Â  The appellate court may reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the courtâ€™s ruling. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).\r\nThe trial court should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the defendant is guilty. Â State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 390, 605 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2004).Â  â€œSuspicionâ€ implies a belief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.â€ Â Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478. Â However, a trial court is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis. Â Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478.Â  \r\nSection 16-13-10 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (2003) provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A) It is unlawful for a person to\r\n(1) falsely make, forge, or counterfeit; cause or procure to be falsely made, forged, or counterfeited; or wilfully act or assist in the false making, forging, or counterfeiting of any writing or instrument of writing;\r\n(2) utter or publish as true any false, forged, or counterfeited writing or instrument of writing;\r\n. . . or . . . \r\n(4) willingly act or assist in any of the premises, with an intention to defraud any person.\r\n\r\nForgery consists of the fraudulent making or altering of a writing by one intending to defraud, prejudice, or damage another person. Â Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 650 (6th ed. 1990).Â  It has been defined as a false making of an instrument, on its face purporting to be good and valid, with a design to defraud, prejudice, or damage another. Â See State v. Walton, 107 S.C. 353, 356, 93 S.E. 5, 6 (1917); State v. Floyd, 36 S.C.L. 58 (5 Strob. 58) (S.C. App. L. 1850).\r\nIn order to constitute forgery by uttering or publishing a forged instrument or writing the instrument must be uttered or published as true or genuine, known by the party uttering or publishing it that it is false, forged, or counterfeited, and intended to prejudice, damage or defraud another person.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10(A) (2003); State v. Pace, 337 S.C. 407, 417, 523 S.E.2d 466, 471 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing State v. Wescott, 316 S.C. 473, 450 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 1994)); State v. Singletary, 187 S.C. 19, 196 S.E. 527 (1938); State v. Murray, 72 S.C. 508, 52 S.E. 189 (1905). \r\nThe crime of forgery involves: (1) a false making or material alteration of some written instrument; (2) that is the apparent foundation of some legal liability; and (3) that is uttered or published with the intent to defraud or prejudice another.Â  Walton, 107 S.C. at 356, 93 S.E. at 6 (defining the offense of forgery asâ€œ[t]he material altering, with intent to defraud, of any writing, which, if genuine, might apparently be the foundation of a legal liability.â€); see also William Shepard McAninch &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina 421 (4th ed. 2002). \r\n A.&nbsp; False Making or Material Alteration of a Written Instrument\r\nA material alteration of an instrument makes it speak a language different in legal effect from the language it originally spoke, or generates some change in the rights, interests, or obligations of the parties to the writing. Â McAninch at 422.Â  The alteration may be accomplished by additions to or subtractions from the instrument, such as erasures or deletions of words, numbers, or symbols that change the instrumentâ€™s effect.Â  See State v. Wescott, 316 S.C. 473, 477-78, 450 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 1994). Â â€œAs a general rule, forgery cannot be committed by the genuine making of an instrument for the purpose of defrauding; however, the making of a false instrument is as much a forgery as is the false making of an instrument.â€Â  Id. at 477-78, 450 S.E.2d at 601 (affirming forgery conviction for passing a legitimate check, drawn on a legitimate account with an authorized signature because the account was opened with intent to defraud).Â  â€œForgery is the alteration of a deed or writing, in a material part, to the prejudice of another, as well as where the whole deed or writing is forged.â€ Â State v. Floyd, 36 S.C.L. 58 (5 Strob. 58) (S.C. App. L. 1850) (proclaiming â€œ[t]he alteration of a receipt for money, by erasing the word â€œpart,â€ and inserting, in lieu of it, the words â€œfull up to date,â€ constitutes the offence of forgery. . . .â€). Â \r\n\r\n[T]he mischief is just as fully and conveniently perpetrated by one of various alterations, as it could be by fabricating the whole instrument. Â A note or a receipt is either genuine, or it is not. Â If it be falsely and fraudulently altered in a particular making, it speaks a different language, calculated to produce a different result in its operation, to the prejudice of some one who is designed to be defrauded or injured thereby.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nâ€œOnly those alterations which change, or initially create, the legal meaning of the document will suffice.â€ Â McAninch at 422 (â€œAlteration of an immaterial part of the document does not affect its genuineness.â€). \r\n B. Legal Efficacy of the Instrument\r\nTo constitute forgery, it is essential that the falsely made or altered instrument possess some apparent legal efficacy; otherwise it would have no tendency to defraud. Â State v. Webster, 88 S.C. 56, 58, 70 S.E.2d 422, 423 (1911).Â  As long as a forged instrument is the apparent foundation of legal liability, â€œthe instrument need not be complete in all its particulars to amount to forgery.â€ Â McAninch at 422 (citing State v. Bullock, 54 S.C. 300, 32 S.E. 424 (1898).Â  \r\nAny writing that may defraud or prejudice another, or that, if genuine, would have legal effect or operate as the foundation of another manâ€™s liability may be the subject of forgery.Â  It is sufficient if the forged instrument, believed to be genuine, might have operated to the prejudice of another.Â  See Webster, 88 S.C. at 58, 70 S.E.2d at 423.\r\nC. Intent to Defraud\r\nâ€œIntent to defraud means an intention to deceive another person, and to induce such other person, in reliance upon such deception, to assume, create, transfer, alter or terminate a right, obligation or power with reference to property.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, 423 (6th ed. 1990).\r\nâ€œA defendant may not be convicted of a criminal offense unless the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with the criminal intent, or mental state, required for a particular offense.â€ Â State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 271, 531 S.E.2d 512, 515 (2000). Â Intent to defraud is an essential element of the crime of forgery.Â  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803, 809 (1923).Â  One possesses the intent required for a forgery conviction if he â€œwillingly act[s] or assist[s] in any of the [proscribed] premises, with an intention to defraud any person.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10 (2003); see State v. Zimmerman, 79 S.C. 289, 60 S.E. 680 (1908) (ruling that an indictment for forgery need not charge that the forgery was complete in all its parts; the essence of the crime is the intent to defraud, and the indictment cannot be defeated merely because all the steps necessary to perfect the fraud are not set out therein) (emphasis added). \r\nTo constitute the crime of forgery, it is not necessary that anyone should have been actually injured or defrauded by the false writing or alteration; the mere possibility of injury will suffice.Â  Webster, 88 S.C. at 58, 70 S.E.2d at 423. Â It is sufficient if the false instrument was made with intent to defraud and has the potential to prejudice the rights of another accepting it as true. Â See William Shepard McAninch &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina 420 (4th ed. 2002) (â€œIt is not essential that the scheme succeed, that anyone actually be defrauded or injured in any way.Â  The creation of the false document or the attempt to pass a false document, if accompanied by the requisite intent, will suffice.â€Â  (quoting State v. Jones, 1 McMul. 236 (1841))).Â  The intent to defraud need not be targeted at any particular person.Â  A possibility or probability that some person will be defrauded is sufficient.Â  Id.  \r\nMoreover, the intent need not include the expectation of personal advantage to the accused. Â Brown v. Bailey, 215 S.C. 175, 54 S.E.2d 769, 773 (1949) (articulating that, in proving forgery, it is not necessary to show the defendant profited or intended to profit by the forgery). Â The intention to prejudice or to assist in prejudicing some other person is all that is required. Â Id.\r\nIntent is a question of fact and is ordinarily for jury determination.Â  State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295, 299, 185 S.E.2d 607, 607 (1971).Â  Because intent is seldom susceptible to proof by direct evidence, the circumstances surrounding the making or uttering of the forged instrument are relevant for establishing the requisite intent. Â State v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 288, 559 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2001) affâ€™d 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004) (quoting Tuckness, 257 S.C. at 299, 185 S.E.2d at 607).Â  â€œ[I]ntent may be shown by acts and conduct from which a jury may naturally and reasonably infer intent.â€ Â State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 16, 479 S.E.2d 50, 52 n. 4 (1996); see State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803, 809 (1923);Â  State v. Murray, 72 S.C. 508, 52 S.E. 189, 191 (1905) (â€œThe intent is only matter of circumstance, which naturally follows and springs out of the facts.â€); accord Terrell v. State, 601 S.E.2d 500 (Ga. Ct. App. 2004) (determining criminal intent may be found by the jury upon consideration of words, conduct, demeanor, motive, and all other circumstances connected with the prosecuted act); In re Washington, 691 N.E.2d 285 (Ohio 1998) (finding the intent of an accused person dwells in his mind; not being ascertainable by exercise of any or all of the senses, it can never be proved by direct testimony of third person, and it need not be; it must be gathered from surrounding facts and circumstances under proper instructions from court); State v. Lowery, 667 S.W.2d 52 (Tenn. 1984) (recognizing a jury may infer a criminal defendantâ€™s intent from the surrounding facts and circumstances).\r\nâ€œ[A] person who causes a particular result is said to act purposefully if â€˜he consciously desires that result, whatever the likelihood of that result happening from his conduct.â€™ â€ State v. Jeffries, 316 S.C. 13, 19, 446 S.E.2d 427, 431 n.7-8 (1994) (quoting United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 405, 100 S. Ct. 624, 632, 62 L.Ed.2d 575, 587 (1980)). Â Concomitantly, a person â€œis said to act knowingly if he is aware the â€˜result is practically certain to follow from his conduct, whatever his desire may be as to that result.â€™ â€ Id.\r\nIn the instant case, the State presented undisputed evidence that Lee-Grigg applied to SCVAN to obtain reimbursement for expenses she admittedly did not incur.Â  By her signature Lee-Grigg attested that the application document was a true representation of her costs.Â  In support of her request for reimbursement Lee-Grigg attached the Cityâ€™s fuel receipts that she later confirmed she had altered.Â  The document, viewed in its entirety, would unquestionably produce an operative result different from the result it would have produced unaltered.Â  If Lee-Grigg had successfully obtained reimbursement from SCVAN, the City might have been precluded from recovering its relocation expenses.Â  Alternatively, SCVAN may have inadvertently disbursed funds twice for the same relocation expenses.Â  SCVANâ€™s accidental complicity in Lee-Griggâ€™s undertaking may have threatened its future funding.Â  According to her own testimony, Lee-Grigg knew she had not incurred the relocation expenses; she knew the document misrepresented, concealed, or otherwise communicated false information.Â  \r\nThough denying any knowledge of wrongdoing, Lee-Grigg nevertheless tendered an instrument that did not genuinely represent the facts as they occurred.Â  Â \r\nEvidence supported the Stateâ€™s allegation that Lee-Griggâ€™s conduct met the statutory definition of forgery: the willful false making of an instrument, uttered as true and deemed to be genuine, with the intent that it might operate to the prejudice of another.Â  Viewed in a light most favorable to the State, Lee-Griggâ€™s guilt may be reasonably, fairly, and logically deduced from the evidence.Â  The case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury ChargesÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\nGenerally, a trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 119, 631 S.E.2d 244, 251 (2006); Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472-73 (2004); State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 106, 610 S.E.2d 859, 865 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 261-62, 607 S.E. 2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when read as a whole.Â  Rayfield, 369 S.C. at 119, 631 S.E.2d at 251; Sheppard, 357 S.C. at 665, 594 S.E.2d at 473; State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nThe law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001); State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 512 (2000); State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 325 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 172, 539 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993). Â A trial court has a duty to give a requested instruction that is supported by the evidence and correctly states the law applicable to the issues. Â State v. Peer, 320 S.C. 546, 553, 466 S.E.2d 375, 380 (Ct. App. 1996); see also State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 458, 385 S.E.2d 830, 831 (1989) (acknowledging that a defendant is generally entitled to a requested jury instruction if it is a correct statement of the law on an issue raised by the indictment); State v. West, 138 S.C. 421, 136 S.E. 736, 737 (1927) (finding the court has a duty to charge jury as to law applicable to facts brought out in testimony).\r\nA trial court commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised by the evidence. Â State v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004); State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999); Harrison, 343 S.C. at 172, 539 S.E.2d at 74. Â On review of a jury charge, an appellate court considers the charge as a whole in view of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A confusing charge alone is insufficient to warrant reversal.Â  State v. Kerr, 330 S.C. 132, 144-45, 498 S.E.2d 212, 218 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing State v. Jefferies, 316 S.C. 13, 22, 446 S.E.2d 427, 432 (1994)); see also State v. Peay, 321 S.C. 405, 410, 468 S.E.2d 669, 672 (Ct. App. 1996) (concluding that the trial court commits reversible error when it fails to give requested charge on issue raised by indictment and evidence presented).\r\nA.&nbsp; Good Faith Defense\r\nLee-Grigg asserts the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury as follows:Â  â€œ[i]f one in good faith or ignorance of the effect of his act, without intent to defraud, makes or alters an instrument, he is not guilty of forgery.â€ Â We disagree.Â Â  \r\n\r\nOur time-tested precedent establishes: \r\n  \r\n[i]t may well be that a person may, most innocently and with perfect good faith, make representations which prove to be false in fact, in which case there would be an absence of any criminal intent; but if the representations are not only false, but known to be so by the person who makes them, then the intent to deceive would necessarily be inferred.\r\n  \r\n\r\nState v. Haines, 23 S.C. 170 (1885).Â  \r\nLee-Grigg implores this court to consider that she relied on the Chiefâ€™s assurance he would not seek reimbursement and, therefore, acted in good faith without fraudulent intent.Â  Our case law dictates a different conclusion.Â  It is no defense to the charge of forgery that the defendant considered herself justly entitled to what she would obtain by means of forgery. Â State v. Webster, 88 S.C. 56, 58, 70 S.E.2d 422, 423 (1911).Â  Likewise, it is no defense that the act was done under the instructions or orders of another.Â  State v. Blurton, 352 S.C. 203, 573 S.E.2d 802 (2002) (emphasizing that the â€œorders of anotherâ€ jury charge is a correct proposition of law).Â  Furthermore, it is no defense if it was done in partnership or cooperation with another person.Â  Brown v. Bailey, 215 S.C. 175, 54 S.E.2d 769 (1949) (stating that, both under the forgery statute and the common law, a person may commit forgery by being present and knowingly aiding and abetting another in the perpetration of the crime). Â Â Â \r\nAdvancing the position articulated in Mathews v. United States, Lee-Grigg urges that â€œ[a]s a general proposition a defendant is entitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his favor.â€Â  485 U.S. 58, 63 (1988).Â  However, we are not aware of any South Carolina authority acknowledging a good faith defense to the crime of forgery.Â  Luculently, if one operates with criminal intent, one does not operate in good faith.Â  Fraudulent intent is the essence of the crime of forgery.Â  Consequently, a comprehensive jury instruction on what constitutes fraudulent intent obviates a good faith charge.\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court delivered the following jury instruction on the mental state required for the crime of forgery:\r\n\r\nThe State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant willfully and knowingly acted in falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, altering, changing, defacing or erasing or causing to be falsely made, forged, counterfeited, altered, changed, defaced or erased any record, writing or other written instrument with an intent to defraud any person or organization.Â  A fraudulent intent is the essence of the crime of forgery.Â  It is not necessary, however, to make out the crime of forgery, that any person or any organization be actually defrauded or sustained any loss because of the forgery.Â  The terms willfully and knowingly in connection with the word act, such as the State must prove that the defendant willfully and knowingly acted, those terms used in that area mean a wrongful act which is done by a person who knows the difference between right and wrong and that the act is wrong and who in spite of such knowledge proceeds to do the wrongful act. \r\nAn intent to defraud is an intent to deceive another person or organization for the purpose of monetary gain or induce the other party to part with property or money and accomplish that purpose by some false statement, false pretense, wrongful concealment or suppression of truth or by any other artifice or act which is intended to deceive.\r\nThe making of a false instrument is as much of a forgery as is the false making of an instrument.Â  The false making of an instrument is forgery, and the making of a false instrument is forgery.Â  In order for an accused person to be convicted of the crime of forgery the State must prove three essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\nThat the instrument was uttered or published, uttered means to distribute it, published means disseminate it or give it to another, as true and genuine. \r\nSecond, it must be known by the person who uttered or published the instrument that it was false, forged or counterfeited.\r\nAnd third, that it must be uttered or published with an intention to prejudice, damage or defraud another person or organization. \r\nIt is not necessary that the State show injury or loss to make out the offense of forgery or that the defendant profited or intended to profit by the deception.Â  The intent of the accused may be shown by acts and conducts of the accused and by other circumstances from which you may naturally and reasonably infer intent.\r\nNow, criminal intent is a necessary element of each crime that must be proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Criminal intent is always a matter that must be determined by the jury from the circumstances surrounding the situation.Â  There is no way to prove criminal intent to any mathematical certainty.Â  There is no way that medical science can dissect a personâ€™s brain and determine what he or she had in mind at the time in question.Â  \r\nSo, the law says that criminal intent may be inferred from the circumstances shown to have been in existence or have existed at the time in question.Â  This is how the jury makes a determination of whether or not the element of intent as required was present.Â  Criminal intent is a state of mind which operates jointly with an act in the commission of a crime.Â  Criminal intent is a mental state, a conscious wrongdoing.Â  So, it is up to you the jury to determine what the defendant intended to do, based upon the circumstances shown to have existed.\r\nThe State must prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt just as the State must prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, as was already explained to you. . . .Â  While the State may prove motive, it is unnecessary that the State prove motive but the State must prove criminal intent. Â \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nThe jury requested that the trial court clarify the definition of criminal intent, and the trial court reiterated the major portions of the original charge.Â  Both the original and subsequent instructions elaborated on the willful and knowing commission of the wrongful act, emphasizing that the act must be a â€œconscious wrongdoingâ€â€”the passage of an instrument as â€œtrue and genuineâ€ Â and known by the passer to misrepresent, conceal, or otherwise communicate false information.Â  The trial court explained the terms willfully and knowingly described actions of a person who knew right from wrong, yet proceeded to do a wrongful act in spite of that knowledge.Â  \r\nReading the trial courtâ€™s instruction as a whole, we verify that it accurately charged the correct law of South Carolina by thoroughly defining and describing the mental state for the crime of forgery. Â We discern no error in the trial court refusing to issue a good faith defense instruction. Â \r\n B.&nbsp; Character Evidence\r\nLee-Grigg maintains the trial court erred in denying her request for a jury instruction on the use of evidence of her good character.Â  We agree the jury should have been charged on evidence of Lee-Griggâ€™s good character.Â  \r\nRule 404(a)(1), SCRE, allows evidence of a pertinent character trait to be offered by the defendant or offered by the State to rebut the defendantâ€™s character trait evidence.Â  State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 635 n.1, 541 S.E.2d 833, 836 n.1 (2001).Â  Accordingly, our supreme court has held the good reputation of the accused, if proved, may be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether or not he or she committed the crime charged.Â  State v. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 171-72, 539 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Hill, 129 S.C. 166, 170, 123 S.E. 817, 818 (1924) (â€œEvidence of the defendantâ€™s good reputation for peace and good order is strongly persuasive of his good character in that respect, and is offered for the very purpose stated by the circuit judge, to show the improbability that the defendant would have committed or did commit the crime charged.â€)); State v. Lyles, 210 S.C. 87, 41 S.E.2d 625 (1947). \r\n\r\nGenerally, where requested and there is evidence of good character, a defendant is entitled to an instruction to the effect that evidence of good character and good reputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to guilt and should be considered by the jury, along with all the other evidence, in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. \r\n\r\nState v. Green, 278 S.C. 239, 240, 294 S.E.2d 335, 335 (1982).\r\nIn the case sub judice, Lee-Grigg requested the following jury instruction:Â  â€œGood character of a defendant, when it is established to the satisfaction of the jury, should be considered by them just as they would consider evidence of any other fact.â€Â  The trial court declined to issue the charge, finding it to be in the nature of argument.Â  The record, on the other hand, contains testimony regarding Lee-Griggâ€™s good character and reputation in the community.Â  One witness averred â€œsheâ€™s a good woman, that I know about, yes.â€ Â A second witness, a former shelter board member, testified:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       Based on your involvement with Becky Lee-Grigg do you have an opinion as to her character in the community?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, I do.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       What is that opinion?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n      I think without question she is the most straightforward person of integrity and honesty that I have ever seen.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       Do you have an opinion as to her reputation for truth and veracity?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, I do.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Knowing that reputation, would you believe her under oath?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       . . .\r\n      \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       I would not believe that she would be capable of doing\r\n        anything that would be wrong.Â  I just think Becky is such a straight arrow, and I used to jokingly say to her, â€œYouâ€™re the most predictable person I have ever seen, you will do\r\n        right, regardless.â€\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       So you would believe her under oath?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Any question about that?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Not at all.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLee-Grigg presented evidence of her good character and, accordingly, requested a charge on that evidence.Â  The trial court erred in denying her request.\r\nC.&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nThe determination that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on evidence of Lee-Griggâ€™s good character does not end the inquiry.Â  The refusal to charge the jury with her requested instruction is subject to harmless error analysis.Â  \r\n&nbsp;At the outset, we identify the trial courtâ€™s error as procedural as opposed to structural.Â  In Arizona v. Fulminante, 429 U.S. 279, 310 (1991), the United State Supreme Court explained certain â€œstructural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanismâ€ result in deprivations that affect the entire framework within which the trial is conducted, from beginning to end.Â  These â€œstructuralâ€ defects compromise the reliability with which a criminal trial functions as a vehicle for determining guilt or innocence and are not subject to harmless error analysis.Â  Id.Â  (citing Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 577-78 (1986).Â  The Fulminante court identified the following examples of structural defects not subject to harmless error analysis: the total deprivation of the right to counsel at trial, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963);Â  the lack of an impartial judge, Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927); the unlawful exclusion of members of the defendantâ€™s race from a grand jury, Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254 (1986); the right to self-representation at trial, McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984); and the right to public trial, Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39 (1984). Â Id. Â \r\n&nbsp;Constrastively, a trial error occurring in the presentation of the case to the jury may â€œbe quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  Fulminante, 429 U.S. at 307-08.Â  Generally, â€œthe Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.â€Â  Id. at 306-07 (citing e.g., Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738 (1990) (unconstitutionally overbroad jury instructions at the sentencing stage of a capital case); Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249 (1988) (admission of evidence at the sentencing stage of a capital case in violation of the Sixth Amendment Counsel Clause); Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263 (1989) Â (jury instruction containing an erroneous conclusive presumption); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497 (1987) (jury instruction misstating an element of the offense); Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570 (1986) (jury instruction containing an erroneous rebuttable presumption); Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683 (1986) (erroneous exclusion of defendantâ€™s testimony regarding the circumstances of his confession); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986) (restriction on a defendantâ€™s right to cross-examine a witness for bias in violation of the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause); Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114 (1983) (denial of a defendantâ€™s right to be present at trial); United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499 (1983) (improper comment on defendantâ€™s silence at trial, in violation of the Fifth Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause); Hopper v. Evans, 456 U.S. 605 (1982) (statute improperly forbidding trial courtâ€™s giving a jury instruction on a lesser included offense in a capital case in violation of the Due Process Clause); Kentucky v. Whorton, 441 U.S. 786 (1979) (failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence); Moore v. Illinois, 434 U.S. 220 (1977) (admission of identification evidence in violation of the Sixth Amendment Counsel Clause); Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223 (1973) (admission of the out-of-court statement of a nontestifying codefendant in violation of the Sixth Amendment Counsel Clause); Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371 (1972) (confession obtained in violation of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964)); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42 (1970) (admission of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970) (denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing in violation of the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause)).\r\n\r\nIn applying harmless-error analysis to these many different constitutional violations, the Court has been faithful to the belief that the harmless-error doctrine is essential to preserve the â€˜principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendantâ€™s guilt or innocence, and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.â€™ â€ \r\n\r\nId. at 308 (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986)). \r\nSouth Carolina courts acknowledge the appropriateness of harmless error analysis in cases where procedural errors rather than defects in the trial mechanism itself affect a defendantâ€™s constitutional rights. Â See State v. Burkhart, 371 S.C. 482, ___, 640 S.E.2d 450, 454 n.3 (2007) (Pleicones, J. concurring in a separate opinion (citing Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992))); State v.

Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 175, 399 S.E.2d 595, 596 (1991) (â€œError in a criminal prosecution is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€).Â  â€œAn error is not reversible unless it is material and prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant.â€Â  Visual Graphics Leasing Corp., Inc. v Lucia, 311 S.C. 484, 489, 429 S.E.2d 839, 841 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nNo definite rule of law governs finding an error harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 454-55, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990)); State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985); State v.

Â Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular facts of each case, including:\r\n\r\nthe importance of the witnessâ€™ testimony in the prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and of course the overall strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.\r\n\r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318-19 (quoting Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684).\r\nFor the error to be harmless, we must determine â€œbeyond a reasonable doubt the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.â€Â  Taylor, 312 S.C. at 181, 439 S.E.2d at 821 (citing Arnold, 309 S.C. at 165, 420 S.E.2d at 839); Jeffries, 316 S.C. at 22, 446 S.E.2d at 432; State v.

Â â€œ[A]n insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where â€˜guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€™ â€ Pagan, 369 S.C. at 212, 631 S.E.2d at 267 (quoting State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989)); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 381, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002) (holding assistant solicitorâ€™s improper comment, during closing argument was harmless error, where evidence of guilt was overwhelming) overruled on other grounds; State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (noting this court will not set aside conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached). \r\nTo warrant reversal based on the trial courtâ€™s failure to give a requested jury instruction, the failure must be both erroneous and prejudicial.Â  State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 231, 589 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2003); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 232, 625 S.E.2d 245, 239 (Ct. App. 2006) cert pending; State v. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 172, 539 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000)).Â  Prejudice to the appellantâ€™s case is a prerequisite to reversal of a verdict due to an erroneous jury charge.Â  State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195-96, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 2003); Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding â€œ[a]n error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversalâ€).Â  Failure to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial error when the instructions given afford the proper test for determining the issues.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002) (citation omitted). Â \r\nArnold v. State provides a reviewing court with the accepted framework for analyzing a defective jury instruction for harmless error.Â  309 S.C. at 166, 420 S.E.2d at 838.Â  \r\n\r\nTo say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is, rather, to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the record. . . .\r\nBefore reaching such a judgment, a court must take two quite distinct steps. Â First, it must ask what evidence the jury actually considered in reaching its verdict ... [Secondly, the Court] must weigh the probative force of the evidence as against the probative force of the presumption standing alone.\r\nFollowing Arnold, the court applied this bifurcated analysis in Taylor v. State and reversed the defendantâ€™s conviction for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and marijuana.Â  312 S.C. at 183, 439 S.E.2d at 822.Â  The court determined the jury heard sufficient evidence on possession, but no direct evidence on intent to distribute.Â  Instead, the State relied on statutory inferences of the defendantâ€™s intent.Â  Id. at 182, 439 S.E.2d at 821.Â  In light of the trial courtâ€™s jury instructions, those inferences became presumptions that the defendant was required to rebut. Â Id.Â  â€œWhile there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred the Petitionerâ€™s intent to distribute the cocaine and marijuana, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt the jury did not base its verdict on the erroneous jury charge.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Jeffries, our supreme court considered an inadequate and confusing jury charge on an element of the crime of kidnapping.Â  316 S.C. at 22, 446 S.E.2d at 432.Â  Accordingly, the court weighed the facts the jury actually heard against the trial courtâ€™s confusing jury charge to determine what effect, if any, it had on the verdict.Â  Id. Â Concluding the juryâ€™s confusion centered on a defense that had no support in view of the facts, the supreme court decided, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury verdict did not rest on the inadequate charge.Â  Id. at 23, 446 S.E. 2d at 433.Â  Â Â \r\nAddressing the trial courtâ€™s failure to instruct on good character evidence, our supreme court held the error was harmless when the whole record conclusively established the defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  State v. Green, 278 S.C. 239, 240, 294 S.E.2d 335, 335 (1982).Â  Concomitantly, in State v. Harrison, the Court of Appeals found the trial courtâ€™s failure to issue a good character charge was not harmless error because the State did not present overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  343 S.C. at 175, 539 S.E.2d at 76.Â  The State charged and tried Harrison for simple possession of cocaine.Â  Harrison admitted he attempted to purchase cocaine but denied he ever possessed the substance.Â  Id.Â  Harrison submitted evidence of his community involvement with adolescents and testimony about the assistance he provided to two single mothers.Â  Id. at 170, 539 S.E.2d at 73. Â The Stateâ€™s main evidence consisted of the arresting officerâ€™s testimony that he saw Harrison drop the drugs. Â Id. at 174, 539 S.E.2d at 75.Â  Harrison requested an instruction regarding the evidence of his good character, which the trial court denied.Â  Id. at 173, 539 S.E.2d at 75.Â  While deliberating, the jury repeatedly questioned the trial court, indicating it struggled significantly with the decision of Harrisonâ€™s guilt.Â  Id.Â  We ruled the trial courtâ€™s denial was reversible error: \r\n\r\nA different verdict might have been reached if the jury had been instructed that evidence of good character and good reputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to guilt and should be considered by the jury, along with all the other evidence, in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Â The State did not present overwhelming evidence of Harrisonâ€™s possession of cocaine, and did not try him for attempting to possess cocaine.Â  Thus, the refusal to charge the requested instruction regarding evidence of good character and reputation was not harmless, but was reversible error.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 175, 539 S.E.2d at 76.\r\nIn the present case, the jury had before it evidence that Lee-Grigg signed a reimbursement request claiming she had incurred the relocation expenses.Â  The State presented testimony that the City actually paid the costs of relocating the victim.Â  Lee-Grigg professed she attempted to collect the funds because she believed the Chief had authorized her reimbursement.Â  Furthermore, she asserted the Chief did not plan to claim reimbursement for the Cityâ€™s costs.Â  Lee-Grigg averred she concealed the driverâ€™s signature and the Chiefâ€™s initials on the Cityâ€™s fuel receipts to protect the victimâ€™s new location.Â  At least two witnesses testified as to Lee-Griggâ€™s good character and reputation in the community.\r\nAfter deliberating an hour, the jury asked for clarification on the definition of criminal intent.Â  The trial court recharged criminal intent.Â  Subsequently, the jury notified the trial court it was deadlocked, with â€œsix for guilty, four not guilty, and two undecided.â€Â  The trial court then issued an Allen charge.[1]Â  Within an hour the jury returned a verdict of guilty. \r\nWeighing the evidence the jury had before it against the failure of the trial court to issue the good character charge, we cannot conclude the trial courtâ€™s error was harmless.Â  The linchpin of Lee-Griggâ€™s defense was her claim she lacked the criminal intent necessary to constitute the crime of forgery.Â  She repeatedly testified the Chief authorized her claim for reimbursement and assured her the City would not attempt to recoup its costs.Â  The Chiefâ€™s testimony neither confirmed, nor denied Lee-Griggâ€™s assertion.Â  Because she relied on the Chiefâ€™s authorization, Lee-Grigg contends she did not have the requisite intent to defraud.Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nIndubitably, the jury struggled with this case (to the point an Allen charge was given), and it seems fair to conclude the struggle centered around whether the State proved the critical element of criminal intent. Â In our view, the element of intent is inextricably connected to defendantâ€™s character. Â We cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the good character charge would not have made a difference in the outcome.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the State provided direct and substantial circumstantial evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of Lee-Griggâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  We adhere to our established precedent that good faith is not a defense to forgery.Â  We rule that Lee-Grigg was entitled to a jury instruction on good character and the trial courtâ€™s failure to issue that instruction was reversible error.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the request to charge evidence of good character is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n KITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] An Allen charge is â€œan instruction advising deadlocked jurors to have deference to each otherâ€™s views, that they should listen, with a disposition to be convinced, to each otherâ€™s argument; deriving its name from the case of Allen v.

(Kajima) and its workersâ€™ compensation carrier, Zurich American Insurance Company (Zurich), were entitled to transfer liability to the Fund pursuant to Section 42-1-415 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  The Fund argues the circuit court erred by: (1) concluding Kajima satisfied the requirements of section 42-1-415 to transfer liability; (2) concluding no substantial evidence existed to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that the certificate of insurance presented to Kajima showed coverage only in Georgia; and (3) relying on our decision in South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œAny review of the [C]ommissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached.â€Â  Id. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.Â  â€œThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nAs noted above, an appellate court may reverse the Commission when the Commissionâ€™s decision is based on an error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.Â  Certain situations involve a mixed question of law and fact.Â  Statutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  House, 360 S.C. at 470, 602 S.E.2d at 82.Â Â  But whether the facts of a case were correctly applied to a statute is a question of fact, subject to the substantial evidence standard.Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 369 S.C. 176, 184-85, 631 S.E.2d 899, 904 (2006) (The meaning of a statutory term is a question of law, but whether a gas and electric companyâ€™s activities met this definition is a question of fact.).\r\nTherefore, the determination of the requirements to transfer liability under section 42-1-415 is a question of law.Â  However, whether Kajima and Zurich met those requirements is a question of fact.\r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fund initially argues the circuit court erred by concluding Kajima satisfied the requirements of section 42-1-415 to transfer liability to the Fund.Â  In other words, the Fund contends the circuit court erred because substantial evidence existed to support the Commissionâ€™s conclusion that Kajima did not satisfy the requirements under section 42-1-415.Â  However, before we determine the issue of whether Kajima met the requirements of section 42-1-415, we must ascertain what those requirements are. \r\n \r\nA.Â  Requirements of section 42-1-415 \r\n\r\n\tSection 42-1-415 in pertinent part provides:\r\n\t(A) [U]pon the submission of documentation to the commission that a . . . subcontractor has represented himself to a higher tier . . . contractor . . . as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance at the time the . . . subcontractor was engaged to perform work, the high tier . . . contractor . . . must be relieved of any and all liability. . . . In the event that [the subcontractor] is uninsured . . . the higher tier . . . contractor . . . shall . . . pay all benefits due. . . . The higher tier . . . contractor . . . may petition the commission to transfer responsibility for continuing compensation and benefits to the Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund.Â  The Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund shall assume responsibility for claims within thirty days of a determination of responsibility made by the commission.\r\n\t(B) To qualify for reimbursement . . . the higher tier . . . contractor . . . must collect documentation of insurance as provided in subsection (A) on a standard form acceptable to the commission.Â  The documentation must be collected at the time the . . . subcontractor is engaged to perform work and must be turned over to the commission at the time a claim is filed by the injured employee.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIf the language in the statute is plain and unambiguous, there is no need to resort to the rules of statutory interpretation.Â  City of Columbia v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 2d 747, 749 (1996).Â  If the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, we must first determine if the language used in section 42-1-415 is ambiguous.\r\nThe dispute between Kajima and the Fund arises in their interpretation of the type of documentation required to transfer responsibility for compensation.Â  Kajima ultimately argues as long as a subcontractor provides a general contractor with proof of workersâ€™ compensation insurance in any state, the general contractor is relieved of its duty, irrespective of whether the subcontractor has coverage in South Carolina.Â  The Fund argues there must be coverage in South Carolina for section 42-1-415 to apply.\r\nSection 42-1-415 provides the means for a general contractor to shift liability for workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  To gain this benefit, the subcontractor has to provide the general contractor with â€œdocumentationâ€ that shows the former has workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  Â§ 42-1-415.\r\nâ€œDocumentationâ€ is not a defined term in section 42-1-415.Â  However, Regulation 67-415 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) sets out an acceptable way to demonstrate insurance coverage.Â  This regulation provides: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tFor purposes of Section 42-1-415, the ACORD Form 25-S, Certificate of Insurance, as published by the ACORD Corporation and as issued by the insurance carrier for the insured, shall serve as documentation of insurance.Â  The Certificate of Insurance must be dated, signed, and issued by an authorized representative of the insurance carrier for the insured.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, it would appear Regulation 67-415 sets out the definition of â€œdocumentation.â€Â  However, our recent decision in Barton v. Higgs, Op. No. 4197, --- S.C. ----, ---S.E.2d ----, 2007 WL 102986 (Ct. App. 2007), is illustrative on this point.Â  In that case, we held Regulation 67-415 describes documentation that is always acceptable.Â  Id.Â  But the Regulation does not set out the only acceptable means to prove coverage.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nBecause the term is susceptible to at least two different meanings, it is ambiguous.Â  Consequently, we must resort to the rules of statutory construction to ascertain its meaning.Â  \r\n \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to determine and give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993).Â  Following Kajimaâ€™s interpretation of the statute would lead to a conclusion that the legislature did not intend.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nKajimaâ€™s argument stands for the proposition that although a subcontractor does not have workersâ€™ compensation insurance in South Carolina, if a subcontractor shows a general contractor proof of coverage in another state, a general contractor is relieved of liability.Â  In other words, if Hunt, the subcontractor, had coverage only in Alaska and showed proof of this coverage to Kajima, Kajima would be relieved of liability.Â  \r\n \r\nFollowing this interpretation would allow a general contractor to escape liability by turning a blind eye towards the obvious.Â  Moreover, such an interpretation would place a general contractorâ€™s liability upon the shoulders of South Carolina, by deducting from the State treasury money owed by a general contractor.Â  Surely, the legislature did not intend such a result when it enacted section 42-1-415.Â  See Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 22, 416 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1992) (Workersâ€™ compensation statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of coverage.); see also Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001) (Statutes that impose liability on the State must be liberally construed in favor of limiting liability to the State.); Vulcan Materials Co. v. Greenville County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 342 S.C. 480, 496, 536 S.E.2d 892, 900 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration should be accorded great deference and will not be overruled without a compelling reason.â€). Â \r\nNonetheless, Kajima argues the language of section 42-1-415 is unambiguous.Â  However, no matter how â€œclear the language of a statute may be, the court will reject that meaning when it leads to an absurd result not possibly intended by the legislature.â€Â  Hamm v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 287 S.C. 180, 182, 336 S.E.2d 470, 471 (1985).Â  Even if we were to assume the language of section 42-1-415 is clear, such a reading would lead to the absurd result described above.[1]Â  Having determined that section 42-1-415 does not reward a general contractor for turning a blind eye to the obvious, we must now determine whether Kajima complied with this section. \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Kajima noncompliance with section 42-1-415 Â \r\nThe Fund argues the circuit court erred by concluding Kajima satisfied the requirements of section 42-1-415 to transfer liability.Â  In other words, the Fund contends there was substantial evidence that the certificate of insurance presented to Kajima showed coverage only in Georgia and not in South Carolina.Â  WeÂ  agree. Â \r\nAs described above, whether an agency correctly applied the facts of a case to a statute is a question of fact, subject to the substantial evidence standard.Â  Bursey, 369 S.C. at 184-85, 631 S.E.2d at 904.Â  Thus, our review of whether the Commission correctly concluded Kajima met the requirements of section 42-1-415 is subject to the well-known substantial evidence standard.\r\nThe certificate of insurance provided by Hunt to Kajima, dated September 4, 2003, lists the insured as â€œTerry Hunt Construction Company . . . Valdosta, [ Georgia] 31602.â€Â  The certificate holder is listed as â€œKajima Construction Services, Inc. . . . Atlanta, [Georgia] 30305-1503.â€Â  The coverage producer is listed as â€œBB&amp;T Insurance Services, Inc. . . . Macon, [Georgia] 31210.â€Â  The block labeled â€œDescription of Operations/Locationsâ€ is blank.Â  There is no indication on the certificate of insurance in which state, if any, Hunt had workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â Â  Based on this, there is substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that Kajima did not satisfy section 42-1-415.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred by concluding Kajima satisfied the requirements of section 42-1-415 to transfer liability.Â  \r\n \r\nC.Â  The House case\r\nThe Fund argues the circuit court erred by relying on our decision in South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Conversely, Kajima asserts House is factually similar to this case; therefore, Kajima should be able to pass liability to the Fund.Â  We agree with the Fund.Â  \r\n \r\nIn House, a general contractor employed a subcontractor for framing work.Â  Id. at 469, 602 S.E.2d at 81.Â  During the course of employment, an employee of the subcontractor was injured.Â  Id.Â  Prior to the accident, the subcontractor presented to the general contractor a certificate indicating workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  Id.Â  However, by the time of the accident, the subcontractorâ€™s coverage had lapsed.Â  Id. at 469-70, 602 S.E.2d at 81-82.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Commission concluded the subcontractor committed fraud by failing to notify the general contractor of the lapse.Â  Id.Â  The Commission transferred the general contractorâ€™s liability to the Fund pursuant to section 42-1-415.Â  Id.Â  The circuit court reversed and concluded the general contractor had notice of the subcontractorâ€™s lapse in coverage.Â  Id.Â Â  The general contractor appealed to this Court, and we reversed the circuit court.Â  Id.Â  Kajima argues this factual similarity requires us to affirm the circuit court.Â  However, House is distinguishable from this case.Â  \r\n \r\nThe central issue in House was whether a general contractor had a continuous duty to collect proof of insurance coverage.Â  Id.Â  We noted section 42-1-415 does not â€œrequire a [general] contractor to continue to collect proof of insurance coverage from its subcontractor after originally collecting documentation at the time of the hire.â€Â  Id. at 471, 602 S.E.2d at 82 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n \r\nIn House, the subcontractor initially provided the general contractor with proper documentation.Â  Id.Â  We did not address the issue of what happens if the documentation originally submitted to the general contractor did not provide coverage in South Carolina.Â  House does not stand for the proposition that a general contractor may escape liability simply by collecting documentation that shows a lack of workersâ€™ compensation coverage in South Carolina.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred in relying on House.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nREVERSED.  [2]Â  \r\n\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Our ruling today does not put an extra duty upon the general contractor to inquire into the validity of the subcontractorâ€™s coverage.Â  However, a general contractor cannot expect to turn a blind eye to the subcontractorâ€™s obvious lack of coverage in South Carolina and have the State shoulder that burden.Â  A determination of what type of conduct constitutes an obvious lack of coverage in South Carolina will have to be settled on a case-by-case basis. \r\n \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4239","title":"State v.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Â The State appeals the trial courtâ€™s sua sponte grant of a new trial to the respondent Jeremiah Dicapua following his convictions for distribution of crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.Â  We reverse and reinstate Dicapuaâ€™s sentence.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 16, 2003, the Horry County Police Department and Myrtle Beach Police Department organized a sting operation in Myrtle Beach.Â  They rented connecting rooms at a Red Roof Inn in Myrtle Beach.Â  One room was to be used as a transaction room and the other as a control room where the officers, using surveillance equipment consisting of a hidden camera and a microphone, would monitor what occurred in the transaction room.\r\nThe police issued a female informant $180 in â€œmarked police buy moneyâ€ with which to buy drugs from Dicapua, a person from whom the informant claimed to have purchased drugs on a prior occasion.Â  The police had arrested the informant and another woman whom the record describes as a â€œcooperating witnessâ€ earlier that day, charging them with prostitution.Â  Before Dicapua ever entered the transaction room, the police conducted a search of the room and of the informant and the other woman. Â Once the officers had everything in place for the sting operation, the informant left the room.\r\nDetective Kent Donald of the Narcotics and Vice Division of the Horry County Police Department saw Dicapua and the informant enter the transaction room as he watched from the control room next door using the hidden camera.Â  Once inside the transaction room, the informant gave Dicapua money and Dicapua tossed â€œsomethingâ€ onto the bed.Â  Either the informant picked up whatever Dicapua dropped onto the bed or Dicapua handed the â€œsomethingâ€ to her.Â  Regardless, the informant placed what Dicapua dropped or handed to her inside her pocket.Â  The officers entered the room and arrested Dicapua as he prepared to leave.\r\nThe police immediately searched Dicapua and found 0.8 grams of crack cocaine and $160 in marked bills on his person.Â  The informant turned over two bags of crack cocaine.Â  All total, the police recovered 2.4 grams of crack cocaine.\r\nBefore the start of trial, Dicapua sought to suppress the videotape because it did not have any audio.Â  The audio surveillance system had failed to record what was said in the transaction room because of a machine malfunction.Â  The trial court, however, refused to suppress the videotape.\r\nOnce the trial began, the State introduced the videotape through its first witness, Detective Donald.Â  When the trial court asked what the defenseâ€™s position was regarding the introduction of the videotape, Dicapuaâ€™s counsel specifically stated, â€œWe have no objection, Your Honor.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  Whereupon, the trial court entered the videotape into evidence â€œ[w]ithout objection.â€\r\nAfter the jury found Dicapua guilty on both charges, he â€œrenew[ed] all of [his] prior Motions . . . made during the course of the trial, as well, as at the end of the Stateâ€™s case.â€Â  Dicapua also moved for a new trial â€œon the basis of what else was set out before the Court, the objections and request going back to the CI, the chain, and all those things.â€Â  The trial court denied Dicapuaâ€™s motions, ruling that the juryâ€™s verdict was supported by the evidence.Â  The trial court sentenced Dicapua to two concurrent sentences of thirty months in prison and fined him $25,000 on each offense.\r\nThe trial court vacated Dicapuaâ€™s convictions and sentences the next day, acting sua sponte.Â  The trial court focused upon the videotape, finding its introduction â€œinappropriate for multiple reasons.â€[1]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the trial court abused its discretion when it granted Dicapua a new trial.Â  We agree.\r\nIt is well settled that the grant or refusal of a new trial is within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of that discretion.[2]Â  Where there is no evidence to support a conviction, an order granting a new trial should be upheld.[3]Â  â€œThe State may appeal the grant of a new trial when it appears it is based â€˜wholly upon an error of law.â€™â€[4]\r\nAs the record reflects, Dicapuaâ€™s sole objection to the videotape came in the form of a motion in limine to suppress the videotape because of its lack of audio.Â  Once the State moved to enter the videotape into evidence and publish it to the jury, however, Dicapuaâ€™s counsel specifically stated he had â€œno objection.â€Â  We find this amounted to a waiver of any issue Dicapua had with the videotape.\r\nIn Martelly v. State, a case similar to the one here, the defendantâ€™s counsel not only failed to object to the introduction of evidence that he had previously moved to suppress through a pretrial motion, but affirmatively stated that he had no objection to its introduction.[5] Â The Court of Appeals of Maryland, in finding the defendant waived his objection, held:\r\n\r\n\t[A]ppellantâ€™s express waiver of objection to the admission of the evidence now in question was tantamount to a withdrawal of his previous motion to suppress, and . . . consequently the issue of admissibility is not now before us. Â To hold otherwise would be to say that a defendant could not change his mind and affirmatively consent to the admission of the evidence at trial. Â It is settled law that when an accused is present in court and represented by competent counsel, he is bound by the actions and concessions of counsel, and that even constitutional rights may be waived in the course of a trial.[6]\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J., (concurring in result):Â  I concur with the majority in its decision to reverse the grant of a new trial, but write separately to explain why I would reverse on a different ground.\r\nDicapua raises the issue of the ability of the State to appeal the grant of a new trial.Â  This is a threshold issue not addressed in the majority opinion.Â  The Stateâ€™s ability to appeal the grant of a new trial is closely circumscribed by precedent.Â  If the grant of a new trial by the trial court is based on the insufficiency of the evidence, the State has no right to appeal.Â  State v. Lynn, 120 S.C. 258, 261, 113 S.E. 74, 75 (1922).Â  On the other hand, the State may appeal the grant of a new trial when it appears it is based wholly upon an error of law.Â  State v. DesChamps, 126 S.C. 416, 418, 120 S.E. 491, 492 (1923).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough the grant or refusal of a new trial motion lies within the discretion of the trial court, â€œ[a]n abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 656, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\n \r\nIn this instance, I agree the State may appeal because the ruling of the trial court that the videotape is not admissible is, in my view, an error of law.Â  The flaws in the videotape go to the weight of the evidence and not to its admissibility.Â  The trial courtâ€™s grant of a new trial was premised solely on the finding that the videotape was inadmissible.Â  I believe that ruling to be an error of law that allows the appeal, and its prejudicial nature compels the reversal.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The trial court also suppressed the introduction of the videotape in any subsequent trial of Dicapua on the charges, an issue we need not address in view of our decision to reverse the grant of the new trial.\r\n[2]Â  State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 63, 447 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1993).\r\n[3]Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993).\r\n[4] Â State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 184, 189, 610 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct.

We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn August 2003, BAGE, L.L.C. (â€œBAGEâ€) entered into a written contract with Southeastern Roofing Company of Spartanburg, Inc. (â€œSoutheastern Roofingâ€).Â  Under the agreement, Southeastern Roofing was to perform re-roofing work on a commercial office building BAGE owned.Â  More specifically, the company was to remove the outer layers of the existing roof system and install of a new, modified bitumen roof on the structure.Â  Southeastern Roofing was to immediately commence the project after the contract was signed and to complete the job within approximately six weeks.Â  Work on the roof, however, did not begin until the end of October 2003 and continued only sporadically through the winter and into the spring of 2004. \r\n \r\nFrom almost the moment Southeastern Roofing started operations on BAGEâ€™s building, significant leaks in the roof began to occur.Â  These leaks resulted in interior water infiltration, manifested by falling ceiling tiles, water gushing down interior walls, light fixtures filling with water, and the growth of mold and mildew.Â  BAGE repeatedly contacted Southeastern Roofing, demanding the leaks be stopped.Â  Despite BAGEâ€™s requests, the necessary repairs were never made and water continued to infiltrate and further damage the building.Â  BAGE ultimately filed suit, claiming breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranties, and negligence.Â  \r\n \r\nAt the fledgling stages of the litigation, BAGEâ€™s counsel spoke with Southeastern Roofingâ€™s general manager, Jamie Cubitt, who initially agreed to accept service of process by mail.Â  When Cubitt failed to return the summons and complaint, BAGE sought to serve the company through its registered agent.Â  After discovering that the agent listed with the Secretary of State was no longer affiliated with Southeastern Roofing, BAGE pursued service via a private process server. Â \r\nOn July 9, 2004, the process server arrived at Southeastern Roofingâ€™s office with the intendment of serving Cubitt with BAGEâ€™s summons and complaint.Â  Cubitt was not in the office at that time, and the server was instead met by Debbie Green, another Southeastern Roofing employee.Â  Green was able to reach Cubitt by telephone.Â  After being informed someone was in the office with papers to serve, Cubitt instructed Green to accept the documents.Â  This communication with Cubitt was relayed to the process server.Â  Green signed for the service of process.Â  An affidavit of service was filed on July 13, 2004.Â  \r\n \r\nUpon returning to the office, Cubitt instructed another employee, Cheri Barnette, to send a copy of the summons and complaint to Southeastern Roofingâ€™s insurance agency.Â  These documents were faxed to the insurance company on July 13, 2004.Â  No cover letter was included in this facsimile nor was any follow-up with its insurance carrier ever taken by Southeastern Roofing.\r\nSoutheastern Roofing never responded to the complaint.Â  BAGE filed an affidavit of default and motion for an entry of default on September 7, 2004.Â  That same day, an entry of default was dated and filed with the court. Â By a motion filed on September 20, 2004, Southeastern Roofing moved to set aside the order granting the entry of default.\r\nA hearing on the motion to set aside the entry of default was held before the circuit court on December 8, 2004.Â  Southeastern Roofing argued (1) the service of process had been improper and thus deprived the court of personal jurisdiction and (2) â€œgood causeâ€ existed to set aside the entry of default under SCRCP Rule 55(c).\r\nBy an order dated April 28, 2005, the judge denied Southeastern Roofingâ€™s motion to set aside the entry of default.Â  In regard to service of process, the order specifically found (1) Green was an office manager at Southeastern Roofing for the purposes relevant to service of process and (2) Green had Cubittâ€™s specific authorization to accept service of process.Â  With respect to the Rule 55(c) motion, the judge found Southeastern Roofing had failed to show good cause as to allow relief from the entry of default. Â Southeastern Roofing timely moved for reconsideration of the order denying its motion to set aside default.Â  This motion was denied.Â  \r\n \r\nOn April 27, 2006, following a damages hearing before the Richland County master-in-equity, BAGE obtained a default judgment against Southeastern Roofing in the amount of $1,151,888.84.Â  This judgment was properly filed with the court on May 3, 2006.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œQuestions of fact arising on a motion to quash service of process for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant are to be determined by the court.â€ Â Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct. App. 2001); accord Lawson v. Jeter, 243 S.C. 103, 106, 132 S.E.2d 276, 277 (1963); Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 524, 473 S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. App. 1996). The findings of the circuit court on such issues are binding on this court, unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or manifestly influenced or controlled by error of law. Â Id.\r\nâ€œThe decision of whether to grant relief from an entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€ Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1989) (citing Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C. 372, 360 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1987)); accord In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 259, 495 S.E.2d 454, 459 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œThis court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trial judge and will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s decision absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.â€ Â Ricks, 293 S.C. at 374, 360 S.E.2d at 536; Ammons v. Hood, 288 S.C. 278, 279, 341 S.E.2d 816, 818 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  In reviewing a trial judgeâ€™s exercise of discretion, the issue before an appellate court is not whether it believes good cause existed to set aside the entry of default, but whether the trial judgeâ€™s determination is supported by the evidence and not controlled by an error of law.Â  Pilgrim v. Miller, 350 S.C. 637, 640-41, 567 S.E.2d 527, 528 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Service of Process\r\nSoutheastern Roofing argues the delivery of process to Green was insufficient as a matter of law.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 4(d), SCRCP addresses service of process and states:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSummons: Personal Service. The summons and complaint must be served together. Â The plaintiff shall furnish the person making service with such copies as are necessary. Â Voluntary appearance by defendant is equivalent to personal service; and written notice of appearance by a party or his attorney shall be effective upon mailing, or may be served as provided in this rule. Â Service shall be made as follows:\r\n\t\t. . . \r\n\t\t(3) Corporations and Partnerships. . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe rule provides service of the summons and complaint may be made upon a corporation by â€œdelivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process . . . .â€Â  Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP.Â  Service on a managing or general agent is sufficient even though the corporation has a registered agent.Â  Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 274 S.E.2d 290 (1981).\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe rule permits service on two types of agents: an agent authorized by appointment and an agent authorized by law.Â  Evidence of an actual appointment by the defendant for the specific purpose of receiving service is normally required to show the authority of the agent.Â  The courts look at the circumstances to find express or implied authority to accept the service.Â  Agency for accepting process is not necessarily established by the act of accepting the process, statements by the person served, or the existence of another agency relationship.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJames F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 20 (2nd ed. 1996).\r\n\r\n\tOur supreme court has enunciated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tService on a corporation may be made by hand delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation or to an authorized agent of the corporation.Â  Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP. Â The rule â€œpresupposes that an officer of the corporation will know what to do with the papers served and will see that the corporation takes steps to defend the action.â€ 62B Am. Jur. 2d,\r\n\t\tProcess Â§ 268 (1990). Â Once papers have been served on an officer of the corporation, the corporation then has actual notice of the action. Â Pioneer Util. Corp. v. Scott-Newcomb, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 616 (E.D.N.Y.1939). \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nRoche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 210, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899-900 (1995).Â  â€œRule 4, SCRCP serves at least two purposes. Â It confers personal jurisdiction on the court and assures the defendant of reasonable notice of the action.â€Â  Roche, 318 S.C. at 209, 456 S.E.2d at 899; Moore, 322 S.C. at 523, 473 S.E.2d at 66. \r\n \r\nâ€œThe plaintiff has the burden to establish that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.â€ Â Moore, 322 S.C. at 523, 473 S.E.2d at 66 (citing Jensen v. Doe, 292 S.C. 592, 358 S.E.2d 148 (Ct. App. 1987)). Â However, exacting compliance with the rules is not required to effect service of process. Â Roche, 318 S.C. 209-10, 456 S.E.2d at 899 (citing Foster v. Crawford, 57 S.C. 551, 36 S.E. 5 (1900) (when officerâ€™s return defective as to time and place of service, it can be amended to state facts); Saunders v. Bobo, 2 Bailey 492 (1831) (sheriffâ€™s incomplete return that was not sworn to may be amended); Miller v. Hall, 28 S.C.L. 1, 1 Speers 1 (1842)); Moore, 322 S.C. at 66, 473 S.E.2d at 523. Â Rather, inquiry must only be made as to whether the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.Â  Moore, 322 S.C. at 523, 473 S.E.2d at 66; Roche, 318 S.C. at 210, 456 S.E.2d at 899. Â â€œWhen the civil rules on service are followed, there is a presumption of proper service.â€Â  Roche, 318 S.C. at 211, 456 S.E.2d at 900 (citing 62B Am. Jur. 2d Process Â§ 111 (1990)).Â  The defendant, not the plaintiff, bears the burden of proving that the service of process was signed by an unauthorized person.Â  See Roche, 318 S.C. at 211, 456 S.E.2d at 900 (stating that when service of process is accomplished by certified mail under Rule 4(d)(8), â€œthe defendant, not the plaintiff, must prove the receipt was signed by an unauthorized person.â€).\r\nNot every employee of a corporation is an â€œagentâ€ of the corporation for the purposes of service of process.Â  Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583-84, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631-32 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  If the employee in question is not a managing or general agent, the question is whether the individual possessed â€œspecific authorization to receive process.â€Â  Id.Â  This court has inculcated:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tActual appointment for the specific purpose of receiving process normally is expected and the mere fact a person may be considered to act as defendantâ€™s agent for some purpose does not necessarily mean that the person has authority to receive process. Â The courts must look to the circumstances surrounding the relationship and find authority which is either express or implied from the type of relationship between the defendant and the alleged agent.Â  Claims by one to possess authority to receive process or actual acceptance of process by an alleged agent will not necessarily bind the defendant. Â Rather, there must be evidence the defendant intended to confer such authority.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMoore, 322 S.C. at 523, 473 S.E.2d at 67 (internal citations omitted); accord Hamilton v. Davis, 300 S.C. 411, 414, 389 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nThis court addressed a factually similar issue in Schenk v. National Health Care, Inc., 322 S.C. 316, 471 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In Schenk, the plaintiff attempted to serve process on the defendantâ€™s registered agent by means of a private process server.Â  When the server took the summons and complaint to the address recorded with the secretary of state, an individual different from the one on file, Carol Grant, informed him the listed agent was no longer there and had retired from the company.Â  Grant signed for the papers, assuring the server that she was duly authorized to accept service as the office manager.Â  She assured him that she would pass the documents along to the companyâ€™s corporate headquarters.Â  The defendant never answered the complaint and an entry of default ensued.Â  A motion to set aside default for improper service was denied by the circuit court.Â  On appeal, this court found service of process had been effective and affirmed the circuit court.Â  Noting Grant was the defendantâ€™s office manager and that she assured the process server of her authorization to accept service of process, we concluded she was a managing agent for the defendant under Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP.Â  Id. 322 S.C. at 319-20, 471 S.E.2d 738. Â \r\nAlthough, â€œ[w]ithout specific authorization to receive process, service is not effective when made upon an employee of the defendant, such as a secretary,â€ Brown, 348 S.C. at 584, 560 S.E.2d at 632 (citing Moore, 322 S.C. at 523-24, 473 S.E.2d at 67), Green indubitably served in a much greater capacity at Southeastern Roofing than simply that of a secretary.Â  The testimony given by Green during her deposition clearly refutes the contents of her prior affidavit submitted by Southeastern Roofing and its assertion that she was only a â€œsecretary/receptionist.â€Â  During Greenâ€™s deposition, the following colloquy took place:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.\r\n\t\t\tIf Joanie Burnett is not there and youâ€™re there, then accordingly wouldnâ€™t you then be in charge of the office?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, Sir.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAnd on this particular day, you \r\n\t\t\twere there and you were in charge of the office?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCorrect.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Green indicates it was common practice for her to sign for the receipt of documents:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tWas it normal for you to sign \r\n\t\t\tfor mail for Southeastern?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNormally it is.Â  I mean as far as, you know, signing for certified mail.Â  Yeah, we usually sign for certified mail.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe deposition demonstrates Greenâ€™s specific authorization to accept the service of process:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\t. . . Did you tell Mr. Cubitt that the person that was there had a summons and complaint for Mr. Cubitt?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tYes, Sir.&nbsp; I \r\n\t\t\tjust told him that he had some -- the server had some papers from \r\n\t\t\thim for some -- for him to sign for.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. . . .\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid Mr. Cubitt indicate to you it was ok if you --\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tYeah.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\t--- Accepted the papers?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tMm-Hmm (Affirmative Response).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn his order denying the motion to set aside the entry of default, the circuit judge found:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAs indicated in Ms. Greenâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tdeposition, the office management responsibilities pertaining to \r\n\t\t\tDefendantâ€™s office are shared by the administrative personnel in the \r\n\t\t\toffice and Ms. Green manages the office and is in charge if no one \r\n\t\t\telse is there.&nbsp; On July 9, 2004, Ms. Green was in charge of \r\n\t\t\tmanaging the office of Defendant when the subject process server \r\n\t\t\tarrived for the purpose of serving the Summons and Complaint in this \r\n\t\t\tcase.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tAccording to Ms. Green, and \r\n\t\t\twhile the process server was at the office, she either called Mr. \r\n\t\t\tJamie Cubitt or Mr. Cubitt called her and, after informing Mr. Cubitt that someone was there with papers to be served, she was authorized by Mr. Cubitt to accept the subject documents, such being told to the process server as acknowledged by Ms. Green in her deposition and also referenced in the process serverâ€™s Affidavit of Service which has been filed in this case.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tAfter examination by counsel for \r\n\t\t\tPlaintiff in her deposition, and on further examination by counsel \r\n\t\t\tfor Defendant, Ms. Green reconfirmed her conversation with Mr. Jamie Cubitt about being â€œokayedâ€ to â€œreceive whatever it was that the server was there to give you.â€\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no case in South Carolina specifically defining â€œmanaging agentâ€ or â€œagent authorized by appointmentâ€ under Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, Schenk confirms that an office manager of the corporate defendant involved can be deemed a â€œmanaging agentâ€ under the rule.Â  Additionally, the facts of the case prove that Green had Cubittâ€™s authorization to sign for the summons and complaint.Â  Although Southeastern Roofing argues contrarily, the evidence inexplicably supports the circuit judgeâ€™s finding that service on Southeastern Roofing was proper under Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP.Â  \r\n \r\nFurthermore, we would note the efficacy and rationale behind the requirement for service of process--that the defendant has notice of the proceedings--has luculently been met in this case.Â  See Roche, 318 S.C. at 210, 456 S.E.2d at 899 (â€œRule 4, SCRCP serves at least two purposes.Â  It confers personal jurisdiction on the court and assures the defendant of reasonable notice of the action.â€); Moore, 322 S.C. at 523, 473 S.E.2d at 66 (â€œRather, inquiry must only be made as to whether the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction of the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.â€).Â  The history and dealings between the parties through July 9, 2004 reveal that BAGEâ€™s counsel spoke with Cubitt in regard to this suit and that BAGE attempted to serve process through the postal service.Â  Accordingly, it seems disingenuous for Southeastern Roofing to claim Cubitt, in his conversation with Green, was unaware the papers being served by the process server were the summons and complaint at issue.Â  Moreover, Southeastern Roofingâ€™s manager readily admits to having knowledge of the summons and complaint long before the deadline to answer passed.Â  In his affidavit, Cubitt states: â€œ[O]n or about July 10, 2004, I was notified that a Summons and Complaint concerning this case was left at SE Roofingâ€™s place of business the prior day.â€Â Â  \r\n \r\nII. Â Entry of Default\r\nSoutheastern Roofing argues the court erred in not setting aside the entry of default as provided under Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide: â€œFor good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default . . . .â€Â  Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  Thus, under the rule, the standard for granting relief from an entry of default is â€œgood cause,â€Â  Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc.,Â  298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1989), and is more lenient than the standard for granting relief from a default judgment under Rule 60(b) SCRCP.Â  Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C. 372, 274, 360 S.E.2d 535, 536 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing H. Lightsey, J. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure, 82 (2nd Ed. 1985)).\r\nPublic policy favors the disposition of cases â€œon their merits rather than on technicalities.â€Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 511, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Columbia Pools, Inc. v. Galvin, 288 S.C. 59, 339 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Rule 55(c) should be â€œliberally construed to promote justice and dispose of cases on the merits.â€Â  Dixon v. Besco Engâ€™g, 320 S.C. 174, 178, 463 S.E.2d 636, 638 (Ct. App. 1995); Ricks, 293 S.C. at 374-75, 360 S.E.2d at 536; see also Mann v. Walker, 285 S.C. 194, 328 S.E.2d 659 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding under the earlier statutory provisions for default judgment pursuant to section 15-27-130 of the 1976 Code of Laws of South Carolina, the rules dealing with default are liberally construed to see that justice is promoted and to strive for the disposition of cases on their merits).Â  \r\n \r\nThe decision of whether to grant relief from an entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial court. Â Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501. Â An abuse of discretion in setting aside an entry of default arises when the judge issuing the order was controlled by some error of law or when the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal conclusions, is without evidentiary support.Â  In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 259, 495 S.E.2d 454, 459 (Ct. App. 1997); Boland v. S.C. Public Service Authority, 281 S.C. 293, 315 S.E.2d 143 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  An order based on this discretion will not be set aside absent an error of law or lack of evidentiary support. Â Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501; Stanton v. Town of Pawleyâ€™s Island, 309 S.C. 126, 420 S.E.2d 502 (1992) (stating the appellate court will not disturb a discretionary ruling unless the ruling is without evidentiary support or is controlled by an error of law); Ricks, 293 S.C. 372 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding abuse of discretion in setting aside an entry of default occurs when order was controlled by some error of law or, based upon factual-as distinguished from legal conclusions-was without evidentiary support).Â  Williams v. Vanvolkenburg makes clear the appellate court reviews an evidentiary record under the â€œgood causeâ€ standard by determining whether the trial judgeâ€™s determination is supportable by the evidence and not controlled by an error of law.Â  312 S.C. 373, 440 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1994). Â \r\nThe seminal case articulating the application of â€œgood causeâ€ under Rule 55(c) to a factual scenario is Wham v. Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 381 S.E.2d 499 (Ct. App. 1989). Â Wham provides:\r\n\r\n\tUnder S.C.R.Civ.P. 55(c), as under F.R.CIV.P. 55(c), the standard for granting relief from an entry of default is â€œgood cause.â€ Â The decision of whether to grant relief from an entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial court. Â An order based on an exercise of that discretion, however, will be set aside if it is controlled by some error of law or lacks evidentiary support.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tIn deciding the question of whether to grant the motion by [the defendant] for relief from the entry of default, the master did not employ the â€œgood causeâ€ standard. Â Instead, the master erroneously applied the more rigorous standard of â€œexcusable neglect,â€ a standard used under Rule 60(b). Â He did this even though he recognized the â€œgood causeâ€ standard was applicable.\r\n\r\nId. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501 (citations omitted).\r\nA â€œgood causeâ€ analysis under Rule 55(c) ordinarily is made by the trial judge.Â  In deciding whether to set aside an entry of default, the factors the judge should consider are: (1) the timing of the motion for relief; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted. Â Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501-02; Weeks, 329 S.C. at 259, 495 S.E.2d at 459.Â  However, it is not necessary for the trial judge to make specific findings in regard to the factors enumerated in Wham. Â This court has held, â€œ[t]he trial judge will not be reversed for failing to make specific findings of fact on the record for each factor if there is sufficient evidentiary support on the record for the finding of the lack of good cause.â€Â  Dixon, 320 S.C. at 179, 463 S.E.2d at 639.\r\nIn this case, over two months elapsed between the time Southeastern Roofing was served with the summons and complaint and when it moved for relief.Â  Although the summons and complaint were allegedly sent to Southeastern Roofingâ€™s insurance agent, any negligence by the insurance agent in handling these documents is imputable to Southeastern Roofing.Â  Pilgrim v. Miller, 350 SC. 367, 567 S.E.2d 527 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Pursuant to the findings of the circuit court, Southeastern Roofing mishandled the service of process of this lawsuit:\r\n\r\n\tIt is apparent from the Affidavits filed on behalf of the Defendant that Defendant simply failed to give this matter the proper attention which needed to be given when an entity is served with a Summons and Complaint.Â  There is no indication that there was even a cover letter or other follow up by any representatives of Defendant with its insurance agent after the Summons and Complaint were allegedly faxed to such agent. . . .Â  Defendantâ€™s failure to properly respond to the Summons and Complaint in this case resulted from its failure to take proper action in order to assure that a response was timely filed in regard to Plaintiffâ€™s Summons and Complaint. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBased on the alleged defective workmanship of Southeastern Roofing, the circuit court did not believe Southeastern Roofing had a meritorious defense.Â  The circuit judge stated:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he Defendant does not otherwise have a meritorious defense to the Complaint based on the alleged poor roofing workmanship of Defendant which has apparently caused Plaintiff to sustain continuing damage to the building involved in this case due to water infiltration . . . Â \r\n\r\nIn support of its motion to set aside the order of default, Southeastern Roofing filed several affidavits.Â  The court specifically addressed two of these affidavits in its order:\r\n\r\n\tAs to the Affidavit of Cheri Barnette submitted on behalf of Defendant, Ms. Barnette clearly confirms that Mr. James Cubitt did timely receive the Summons and Complaint which was served in this case and that instructed Ms. Barnette to send the Summons and Complaint to Defendantâ€™s insurance agent, all of which was apparently without any transmittal or follow up by Defendant.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs to the Affidavit of James Cubitt submitted on behalf of Defendant, Mr. Cubitt confirms (1) that he did receive the Summons and Complaint in a timely fashion, and (2) that he did instruct Cheri Barnette to fax a copy of the Summons and Complaint to Defendantâ€™s insurance agent (i.e. all of which was apparently done according to Ms. Barnette in her Affidavit) and that it was Mr. James Cubittâ€™s understanding that the insurance agent would contact Defendant concerning the Summons and Complaint.Â  Apparently, there was no follow up by Defendant.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe circuit court found the evidence did not show the existence of good cause as to allow Southeastern Roofing relief from the entry of default.Â  In making this determination, the circuit judge relied upon Stark Truss Co. v. Superior Construction Corp., 360 S.C. 503, 602 S.E.2d 99 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Stark, the circuit court refused to relieve the defendants from an entry of default, finding they had failed to present sufficient proof of good cause under Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Noting the defendantâ€™s only explanation for not filing an answer within thirty days was that the companyâ€™s president was â€œstruggling with some depression and had a lot things slip through his fingersâ€ and gave no reason why its attorney failed to file an answer, this court found â€œthere was evidence to support the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to set aside the entry of default.â€Â  Id., 360 S.C. at 510, 602 S.E.2d at 103.\r\nAs determined by the circuit judge, Southeastern Roofingâ€™s failure to properly respond to the summons and complaint resulted from its failure to take proper actions in order to assure a response was timely filed.Â  The company offers no good or valid explanation as to why it failed to respond.Â  There is no indication that there was any follow-up by the employees of Southeastern Roofing with its insurance agent after the summons and complaint were allegedly faxed to the agent.Â  It is axiomatic that Southeastern Roofing simply did not give this matter the proper attention it required.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe come to the ineluctable conclusion Green qualifies as both a managing and authorized agent of the appellant. Â Concomitantly, the appellant was properly served when the summons and complaint were delivered to Green as an agent of the appellant.Â  There is copious evidence in the record to support the circuit judgeâ€™s finding that appellant did not prove the existence of good cause to allow the court to set aside the entry of default.Â  We hold there was no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in refusing to grant the appellant relief under SCRCP, Rule 55(c).\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4241","title":"Shaw v.

Â Coleman bought his one-acre property in 1990.Â  The Shaws purchased their land in 1992.\r\n \r\nAfter numerous problems with Coleman beginning in August of 2002, including harassing behavior and his firing of weapons on and off his property, the Shaws and the Snowdens brought a nuisance action seeking a permanent injunction[2] of Colemanâ€™s use of firearms, damages for Colemanâ€™s alleged violation of section 31-18-30 of the South Carolina Code (2007),[3] damages for alleged conversion, and damages and a permanent injunction for alleged trespass.[4] Â Ultimately, the courtâ€™s ruling was limited to the question of whether a permanent injunction should be issued.\r\nAs a threshold matter, the trial court had to determine whether Coleman had a shooting range on his property because Coleman attempted to use section 31-18-30 of the South Carolina Shooting Range Protection Act (the Act) as a defense.Â  In reaching this decision, the trial court heard two days of testimony and visited the property with the parties.\r\n \r\nTerry and Violette Thompson purchased ten acres from the Snowdens in August of 2002.Â  Coleman had previously expressed an interest in purchasing this land, but the offer was rejected.Â  Prior to the sale, the Snowdens did not have any problems with Coleman.Â  Ms. Shaw testified that before the sale she heard four or five shots on Colemanâ€™s land over two to three months.Â  According to Patricia Rowell, who also lives near Holly Road, Coleman fired guns occasionally prior to August of 2002, and after August of 2002, Colemanâ€™s shooting was continuous.Â  When the Thompsons bought the property, the frequency of Colemanâ€™s shooting greatly escalated.Â  The Thompsons sold their property back to the Snowdens in October of 2003 due to Colemanâ€™s continued shooting.\r\n \r\nMs. Shaw testified that Coleman planned to run the Thompsons off the property because he wanted to purchase it.Â  Mr. Shaw concurred with his wife when he testified that Coleman did not want anyone living on the property the Thompsons purchased, and that he planned to run the Thompsons off of their land.Â  Additionally, Mason Draper, a neighbor, discussed the Thompsons with Coleman.Â  According to Draper, Coleman stated that he would keep shooting until the Thompsons moved.\r\n \r\nOther nearby property owners experienced similar treatment by Coleman when they sold a portion of their property to a party other than Coleman. Â The Stackhouses testified that Coleman appeared at their residence screaming that they could not sell their property.Â  In addition, following Frank Shawâ€™s purchase of land near Colemanâ€™s property, Coleman followed Shaw and filmed him with a video camera.\r\nThere was also testimony that Coleman did not limit his shooting to his property, but instead, targeted specific individuals.Â  Both Mr. Shaw and Mr. Snowden testified that Coleman fired bullets over their heads.Â  Additionally, Mr. Snowden watched Coleman fire his rifle over the Thompsonsâ€™ property.Â  Ms. Thompson also saw Coleman firing over a public road and over her head and her sonâ€™s head.Â  Thomas Nolan witnessed Coleman crouched down near the Shawsâ€™ property while wearing a side-arm holster.Â \r\n \r\nIn addition to Colemanâ€™s shooting, witnesses also described Colemanâ€™s harassing and threatening behavior.Â  Mr. Shaw stated that Coleman took pictures of him.Â  Mr. Thompson testified that while he was driving on a dirt road, Coleman appeared and drove erratically behind him while waving a gun.Â  Coleman also repeatedly fired an air cannon on his land.\r\nDuring this contentious time, Travis Rowell delivered thirty tons of dirt to Colemanâ€™s property in December of 2002.Â  Rowell deposited the dirt on a small mound with targets, which was already present prior to the delivery.Â  Additionally, Coleman installed slats on his chain link fence in response to noise complaints.Â \r\n \r\nIn presenting his case, Coleman testified that he wanted to become a shooting instructor and met Charles Shortsleeve, an instructor, in 2003.Â  Coleman claimed he taught as many as fifty people about guns.Â  He further testified that he first obtained a business license for the Sports Shooting Club on his property in 1992, and the license is still effective.Â  Coleman acknowledged the license was for â€œgun smithing activities.â€\r\n \r\nOn behalf of Coleman, several people testified regarding firearms being shot on Colemanâ€™s property.Â  Ray Williams testified he fired guns on Colemanâ€™s property from 1997 to 2001.Â  Between 1990 and 1993, Vicky Bostic observed Coleman shooting at his backstop a few times.Â  Stacey Jordan fired guns on Colemanâ€™s property as early as 1993.Â  Brian Polston remembered firing guns on Colemanâ€™s property as early as 1997.\r\n \r\nRobert Butler, who was involved in drafting several amendments to the Act, stated he saw distance markers and a backstop between ten and twelve feet on Colemanâ€™s property the morning of his testimony. Â Butler believed that Colemanâ€™s property met the requirements of the Act.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nAfter the hearing, the trial court issued an order on May 9, 2005. Â The court held under section 31-18-20 that Colemanâ€™s property was not a shooting range because â€œthe primary use of [Colemanâ€™s] property is as a residence for Mr. Coleman, and the use of weaponry is a collateral use incident to his residence at the property.â€ Â Based on this analysis, the court held that Coleman â€œmay not avail himself of the protections of the South Carolina Shooting Range Act,â€ and found that the Act did not apply to Colemanâ€™s property.Â  As a result of these findings, the court permanently enjoined Coleman from discharging firearms on his property or the surrounding property, from discharging air rifles or pellet guns toward the Shawsâ€™ or Snowdensâ€™ property or person, and from screaming obscenities at the Shaws or the Snowdens or otherwise provoking the Shaws or the Snowdens.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œActions for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.â€ Wiedemann v.

App. 1994).Â  However, this scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the trial court that saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility.Â  Blanks v. Rawson, 296 S.C. 110, 114, 370 S.E.2d 890, 893 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Shooting Range Protection Act\r\nColeman argues the trial court erred in granting the permanent injunction because section 31-18-30 of the Act protects his shooting range from this nuisance action.Â  We disagree.\r\nRelying on the provisions of the Act, the trial court found that Colemanâ€™s property, which was his residence, was not a shooting range given that firing firearms was not the â€œusual, regular, and primary activity occurring in the area.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 31-18-20(1)(b) (2007).Â  Coleman asserts the trial court â€œerred as a matter of law in interpreting the statute to per se exclude Colemanâ€™s property because he lives there.â€ \r\n \r\nBecause the disposition of this case turns on the interpretation of the Act, we must rely upon the rules governing statutory construction. â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature.â€Â  Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 260, 626 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2005). Â â€œWhere the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning, without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€&nbsp; Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332&nbsp;(2002).Â  An issue regarding statutory interpretation is a question of law. S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 470, 602 S.E.2d 81, 82 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\n\tSection 31-18-20 defines a shooting range as follows:\r\n\t(1) â€œshooting rangeâ€ or â€œrangeâ€ means an area that is:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) designated, utilized, and operated by a person for the firing of firearms; where\r\n\t\t(b) the firing of firearms is the usual, regular, and primary activity occurring in the area; and where\r\n\t\t(c) the improvements, size, geography, and vegetation of the area are such that a projectile discharged from a firearm at a target would not reasonably be expected to escape its boundaries by virtue of the trajectory of the projectile, or by virtue of a backstop, berm, bullet trap, impact barrier, or similar device designed to prevent the escape of such projectiles.\r\n\t\r\n\t(2) â€œpersonâ€ means an individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, club, association, governmental entity, or other legal entity.\r\n\t(3) â€œsubstantial change in useâ€ or â€œsubstantial change in the useâ€ means that the current primary use of the range no longer represents the activity previously engaged in at the range.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 31-18-20 (2007).\r\nOn Colemanâ€™s one-acre property there is his residence as well as an area specifically designated for firing weapons, which includes a backstop or berm.Â  Coleman also offered evidence that he has a valid business license and all the appropriate permits to operate firearms on the property. Â Additionally, two witnesses, Butler and William Powell, testified Coleman has established a shooting range which complies with the Act.Â  Based on this evidence, we believe Colemanâ€™s property constituted a shooting range and fell within the ambit of the statute. Â Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in excluding Colemanâ€™s property from the protection of the Act because the property was his residence and shooting was not the sole activity conducted on the property. Â Â \r\nAlthough the classification of Colemanâ€™s property as a shooting range implicates section 31-18-30 of the Act, that section does not necessarily preclude the Shaws and the Snowdens from bringing their nuisance claim or provide Coleman with absolute immunity from the claim.Â  Section 31-18-30 states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t(A) Except as provided in this subsection, a person may not maintain a nuisance action for noise against a shooting range, or the owners, operators, or users of the range, located in the vicinity of that personâ€™s property if the shooting range was established as of the date the person acquired the property. Â If there is a substantial change in the use of the range after the person acquires the property, the person may maintain a nuisance action if the action is brought within three years from the beginning of the substantial change.\r\n\t(B) A person who owns property in the vicinity of a shooting range that was established after the person acquired the property may maintain a nuisance action for noise against that shooting range, or the owners, operators, or users of the range, only if the action is brought within five years after establishment of the range or three years after a substantial change in use of the range.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 31-18-30 (2007).Â  As evidenced by the terms of the statute, a nuisance claim may be filed against the owner of a shooting range, but it must be filed within specific time limits. Â We believe the Shaws and the Snowdens filed their claim in compliance with the above-outlined section.\r\nThe Shaws purchased their land in 1992, and the Snowdens moved to their property in 1959.Â  Coleman bought his one acre property in 1990.Â  The record indicates people fired guns on Colemanâ€™s property for many years.Â  However, the intensity greatly increased in 2002.Â  In addition, Travis Rowell delivered thirty tons of dirt to Colemanâ€™s property in December of 2002, which served as a backstop for firing guns.Â  Moreover, Coleman at that time began taking certification classes and attempted to put up signs to make the public aware of the existence of a shooting range. Â Therefore, we find that while shooting occurred sporadically on Colemanâ€™s property, the shooting range was not established until 2002.\r\nThe Shaws and the Snowdens filed their initial complaint against Coleman on May 13, 2004.Â  This filing was well within the five years after the establishment of a range allowed under section 31-18-30(B).Â  Therefore, although the trial court misapplied section 31-18-20 regarding the existence of a shooting range on Colemanâ€™s property, we find this error is harmless given section 31-18-30(B) does not protect Coleman from the filing of the nuisance action.\r\nHaving found the Act is applicable and that the Shaws and the Snowdens properly filed their claim, we must determine whether Colemanâ€™s conduct created a nuisance sufficient to warrant a permanent injunction.\r\nIn explaining the theoretical underpinnings for the procedure employed in assessing whether a nuisance has been created, our court has stated:\r\n\r\n\tIn resolving issues relating to a private nuisance, we must deal with the conflicting interests of land owners.Â  To establish the line beyond which oneâ€™s exercise of his property rights becomes a legal infringement upon the property rights of another requires a delicate balancing of the correlative rights of the parties; the right of one generally to make such lawful use of his property as he may desire and the right of the other to be protected in the reasonable enjoyment of his property.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nOâ€™Cain v. Oâ€™Cain, 322 S.C. 551, 560, 473 S.E.2d 460, 465 (Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted).\r\nâ€œThe traditional concept of a nuisance requires a landowner to demonstrate that the defendant unreasonably interfered with his ownership or possession of the land.â€Â  Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œ[N]uisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiffâ€™s use and enjoyment of his property.â€Â  Id.; see Blanks v. Rawson, 296 S.C. 110, 113, 370 S.E.2d 890, 892 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œA nuisance has been defined as â€˜anything which works hurt, inconvenience, or damages; anything which essentially interferes with the enjoyment of life or property.â€™â€ (quoting Strong v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 240 S.C. 244, 253, 125 S.E.2d 628, 632 (1962))).Â  â€œIf a lawful business is operated in an unlawful or unreasonable manner so as to produce material injury or great annoyance to others or unreasonably interferes with the lawful use and enjoyment of the property of others, it will constitute a nuisance.â€ LeFurgy, 313 S.C. at 558, 443 S.E.2d at 579. Â â€œSince the degree of annoyance or inconvenience necessary to constitute an actionable nuisance cannot be generally quantified, each case must depend largely on its own facts.â€Â  Id. at 559, 443 S.E.2d at 579.Â  â€œThe question is not whether the plaintiffs have been annoyed or disturbed by the operation of the business in question, but whether there has been an injury to their legal rights.â€Â  Id.\r\nBeginning in 2002, Coleman fired guns continuously, over roads, over property, and over individuals.Â  Coleman also caused excessive noise by firing an air cannon on his property.Â  Several of Colemanâ€™s neighbors testified they felt threatened by Colemanâ€™s actions. Â Mr. Snowden also stated that Colemanâ€™s actions prevented him from selling any area property. Â Based on this evidence, we hold Colemanâ€™s conduct on his shooting range constituted a nuisance that was not based solely on excessive noise.Â  See Oâ€™Cain, 322 S.C. at 562, 473 S.E.2d at 466 (â€œWhile a business may be a legitimate one and not a nuisance per se, it may become a nuisance per accidens by . . . the manner in which it is conducted.â€). Â Therefore, we find the trial court correctly determined Coleman created a nuisance in that he unreasonably interfered with the Shawsâ€™ and the Snowdensâ€™ ownership and possession of their property. \r\n \r\nWe believe our decision is consistent with the intent of the Legislature in establishing the Act.Â  As both parties agree, property owners near shooting ranges will undoubtedly be annoyed by the noise created by the firing of weapons.Â  However, if the conduct on the shooting range becomes such as to be a nuisance, a property owner must have some recourse to abate the nuisance.Â  As we understand the Act, the Legislature clearly intended to protect the investments of shooting range owners by establishing a limitation on when a nuisance claim may be filed against them.Â  See Act No. 260, 2000 S.C. Acts 1924 (providing that enactment of South Carolina Shooting Range Protection Act of 2000 was â€œto regulate nuisance actions in connection with the acquisition of property near existing shooting ranges, the establishment of shooting ranges near existing property, and dormant shooting ranges . . . .â€).Â  This limitation assures that property owners may not move to an area where a shooting range has been established and then assert a nuisance claim.Â  Instead, by permitting a property owner to file a nuisance claim, within established statutory time limits, the Legislature effectively balanced the competing interests of the shooting range owners and their neighbors.Â  Here, the Shaws and the Snowdens properly filed their legitimate nuisance claim within the governing statute of limitations.Â  \r\n \r\nII.Â  Permanent Injunction\r\nEven if his shooting range does not have absolute immunity from a nuisance action under the Act, Coleman argues a permanent injunction is an extreme remedy, which is not appropriate because the Shaws and the Snowdens have alternative legal remedies available. Â We disagree. \r\n \r\nâ€œThe remedy of injunction is a drastic one and should be cautiously applied only when legal rights are unlawfully invaded or legal duties are willfully or wantonly neglected.â€ LeFurgy, 313 S.C. at 558, 443 S.E.2d at 578.Â  â€œIn cases where an injunction is sought to abate an alleged private nuisance, the court must deal with the conflicting interests of the landowners by balancing the benefits of an injunction to the plaintiff against the inconvenience and damage to the defendant, and grant or deny an injunction as seem most consistent with justice and equity under the circumstances of the case.â€ Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn its order, the trial court recognized the serious nature of an injunction and acknowledged the need to balance the partiesâ€™ conflicting interests and pointed to evidence of Colemanâ€™s â€œconfrontational and threatening behavior.â€Â  We agree with the trial court and find the preponderance of the evidence shows that Colemanâ€™s conduct on his shooting range constitutes a private nuisance and should be enjoined.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Shaws and the Snowdens testified Coleman willfully fired a rifle towards his neighbors and over their land. Â There was also testimony that Coleman created excessive noise through the use of an air canon.Â  Based on Colemanâ€™s actions, several of the neighbors testified that they felt threatened.Â  Mr. Snowden also testified that Colemanâ€™s actions prevented him from selling any area property. Â Therefore, we agree with the trial court that â€œMr. Coleman unreasonably interfered with their ownership and possession of their land.â€Â  Although we recognize, as did the trial court, the injunction will inconvenience Coleman by preventing him from maintaining his shooting range and being an instructor, the safety benefits to the Shaws and the Snowdens outweigh the inconvenience suffered by Coleman.Â  See Citizens for a Safe Grant v. Lone Oak Sportsmenâ€™s Club, Inc., 624 N.W.2d 796, 804 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001) (affirming trial courtâ€™s decision to issue a permanent injunction and finding that gun clubâ€™s conduct at shooting range created a nuisance where neighbors were apprehensive about going outside on their property during times of shooting, went indoors to avoid the noise, experienced bullets or shotgun pellets passing over their heads, and saw â€œsigns of indiscriminate shooting on the club propertyâ€); see also F.S. Tinio, Annotation, Gun Club, or Shooting Gallery or Range, as Nuisance, 26 A.L.R.3d 661 (1969 &amp; Supp. 2007) (â€œThe remedy generally availed of by persons who have been injured or have suffered damages on account of the maintenance of shooting galleries, gun clubs, or shooting ranges, is injunction.Â  The grant or denial of this remedy depends on the relevant surrounding circumstances and the evidence presented by the plaintiff.â€).\r\nAdditionally, Coleman suggests the Shaws and the Snowdens have legal actions available to them, and thus, a permanent injunction as an equitable remedy was not appropriate. Â Coleman is correct that equity is reserved for situations where there is no adequate remedy at law. Â See Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989) (â€œEquitable relief is generally available only where there is no adequate remedy at law.â€).Â  The Shaws and the Snowdens, however, are seeking an injunction to prevent Colemanâ€™s dangerous behavior, which cannot be adequately accomplished by an award of damages.Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn their amended complaint, the Shaws and the Snowdens sought an injunction to prevent the â€œcontinuous discharging of firearms and threatening of plaintiffsâ€ in addition to actions for damages for alleged trespass, conversion, and violation of section 31-18-30.Â  Mr. Snowden saw Coleman firing onto peopleâ€™s property and over individualsâ€™ heads.Â  Coleman also fired over Ms. Thompsonâ€™s and her sonâ€™s head.Â  Because the desired action is to prevent Colemanâ€™s dangerous activity, an injunction is appropriate in this case.Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a permanent injunction.Â  See Oâ€™Cain, 322 S.C. at 561, 473 S.E.2d at 466 (â€œA lawful business should not be enjoined on account of every trifling or imaginary annoyance, such as may offend the taste or disturb the nerves of a fastidious or overly sensitive person, but on the other hand, no one, whatever his circumstances or condition may be, should be compelled to leave his home or live in mental discomfort, although caused by a lawful and useful business carried on his vicinity.â€). \r\n \r\nIn reaching our decision, we have considered the cases from other jurisdictions which were submitted by Coleman.Â  Upon review, we find these cases are factually distinguishable, particularly those that discuss excessive noise as the sole basis to bar nuisance actions against shooting ranges.Â  Moreover, we are unable to glean a general rule from these cases for which to resolve the very fact-specific determination of whether to issue a permanent injunction based on a nuisance claim.Â  Balancing the benefits of an injunction to the Shaws and the Snowdens against the inconvenience and damage to Coleman, we hold the trial court correctly granted the injunction.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court erred in concluding that Coleman did not own a shooting range solely on the basis that he resided on the property at issue.Â  Because we believe Coleman did own a shooting range beginning in 2002, we hold the Act was applicable.Â  We also hold the Shaws and the Snowdens properly filed and established a claim for nuisance against Coleman.Â  Finally, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a permanent injunction.\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â This case was originally scheduled for oral argument.Â  Because the parties agreed to submit this case on the record and briefs, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â The trial court granted a temporary injunction by order dated August 17, 2004. \r\n \r\n[3]Â  As will be more fully discussed, section 31-18-30 of the South Carolina Code is one of the statutory provisions comprising the â€œSouth Carolina Shooting Range Protection Act of 2000.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 31-18-10 to -60 (2007).\r\n[4]Â  In a pre-trial ruling, the court denied the Shawsâ€™ and the Snowdensâ€™ motion to amend their complaint to include the conversion claim.Â  At the conclusion of the Shawsâ€™ and Snowdensâ€™ case, the court also directed a verdict in favor of Coleman as to the trespass claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
