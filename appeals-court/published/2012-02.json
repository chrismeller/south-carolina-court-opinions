filed suit for conversion, slander of\r\n  title, and negligence against Navy Federal Credit Union (the Bank) after Jimmy L.\r\n  Mullins, Sr., with whom she owned a house, obtained a mortgage on the house\r\n  from the Bank without her knowledge.  The Bank was held in default after it\r\n  failed to answer Solley's complaint.  After the special referee required Solley\r\n  to elect the theory of

hearing,\r\n  failing to find she was a consumer under federal regulations, and not allowing\r\n  her to reform her complaint to conform to the evidence and issues actually\r\n  tried.  The Bank appeals arguing the default judgment should be vacated because\r\n  Solley failed to plead the elements for slander of title.  The Bank also argues\r\n  the special referee committed several errors in awarding damages because Solley\r\n  did not establish she suffered any damages; she did not establish its conduct was\r\n  willful, wanton, or reckless; and the punitive damages are excessive compared\r\n  to the actual damages.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 2000, Solley and Mullins[1] purchased a\r\n  house in Jasper County from Solley's sister.[2] \r\n  Solley's sister gifted Solley the equity in the home, which Solley believed to\r\n  be approximately $100,000 at the time.  Solley and Mullins obtained financing\r\n  of $100,000 from the Bank to satisfy her sister's outstanding mortgage. \r\n  Mullins and Solley satisfied that mortgage in 2005 or 2006.\r\nIn April of 2006, without\r\n  Solley's knowledge, Mullins obtained another loan from the Bank on the home\r\n  amounting to $233,000.[3] \r\n  The Bank recorded the mortgage with the Register of Deeds in Jasper County. \r\n  Solley learned of the mortgage in December 2007 and hired an attorney, who\r\n  contacted the Bank.  On January 14, 2008, Mullins filed an action against\r\n  Solley for partition.  Mullins was incarcerated at the time, and his sister\r\n  filed the action via his power of attorney.  On February 13, 2008,\r\n  Solley filed an answer and counterclaim.  She also filed a third-party\r\n  complaint against the Bank, alleging conversion, slander of title, and\r\n  negligence.\r\nAfter being properly served,\r\n  the Bank failed to timely respond and Solley moved for a judgment by default.  On July 21, 2008, the court entered an order and entry of judgment against\r\n  the Bank.  The Bank did not pursue having the default set aside.  The court\r\n  severed the third-party action from the original action.  The court referred\r\n  the matter to a special referee to conduct the damages hearing.  The Bank\r\n  appeared at the hearing.\r\nAt the hearing, Solley\r\n  testified that the mortgage had &quot;destroyed [her] life.&quot;  She stated\r\n  that she did not know &quot;how to resolve the issue.&quot;  She could not have\r\n  visitors because she did not know when she might be forced to leave and where\r\n  she would go.  She further testified that her son and grandchildren grew up in\r\n  the home.  Solley provided that she had not slept a night since this incident had\r\n  begun and she lost her job, her family, and her grandchildren all because of\r\n  the mortgage.  She indicated she and Mullins had separated when he went\r\n  to prison in January of 2008 and were no longer together.  She testified she\r\n  has no control over what Mullins will do with the mortgage, and this\r\n  causes her to suffer from anxiety.  She also stated she had to hire an attorney\r\n  to resolve this matter and has had to expend costs in filing the lawsuit.\r\nSolley offered Raymond Molony,\r\n  a senior vice president at a different bank, to testify.  Molony stated he had\r\n  worked in the banking business since 1978 and had worked for a number of\r\n  different banks.  The special referee qualified him as an expert witness in\r\n  banking and mortgages.  Molony testified that if the Bank commenced a\r\n  foreclosure action, it could foreclose on the entire piece of property.  He\r\n  further testified that if the Bank foreclosed and recovered enough funds to\r\n  satisfy Mullins's mortgage and pay Solley for her interest in the property, she\r\n  would still be evicted from the property.\r\nA manager at the Bank, Laura\r\n  Suzanne Hall, was also present at the damages hearing.  Solley did not call\r\n  Hall as a witness, but in response to questioning by the special referee, Hall\r\n  indicated the mortgage was not in foreclosure.  She also testified she did not\r\n  know who closed the mortgage.  She provided that normally &quot;an\r\n  attorney would go over the [d]eed.&quot;  She testified that the loan should\r\n  have been closed by an attorney in South Carolina.  The Bank conceded\r\n  that no attorney's name was listed on the signature page of the loan.\r\nThe special referee found the\r\n  Bank published a false statement by filing a mortgage Solley was not privy to\r\n  upon property in which she was an undivided co-owner.  The referee found the\r\n  mortgage was a false statement because it is invalid as Solley does not owe the\r\n  Bank a debt.  The special referee further found malice by the Bank because it\r\n  had previously accepted a joint mortgage on the property from Solley and\r\n  Mullins and then recklessly accepted this singular mortgage. \r\nThe special referee noted\r\n  that based on Solley's testimony, the home was worth around $200,000 at the\r\n  time of the hearing.  The referee found that had she wished to borrow against\r\n  her interest in the home, the &quot;mortgage would have either severely\r\n  restricted her borrowing power or not enabled her to borrow at all.&quot; \r\n  Solley's expert testified Solley would likely not have been able to obtain a\r\n  loan on the home due to Mullins's loan.  Further, the referee determined the\r\n  Bank was &quot;entirely culpable for its conduct,&quot; which lasted over three\r\n  years and was still continuing.  The referee noted the Bank was in the sole\r\n  position to mitigate Solley's damages and made no attempt to do so.  The\r\n  referee found Solley presented ample evidence of the Bank's net worth, which\r\n  allowed it to afford an award of punitive damages.  The referee posited the\r\n  award should punish the Bank and deter subsequent similar conduct by it and\r\n  other lenders.\r\nThe special referee found\r\n  Solley was entitled to special damages, including actual damages sufficient to\r\n  satisfy the mortgage on the property and remove the impediment to her title.  The\r\n  referee also found she was entitled to punitive damages, &quot;due to the\r\n  egregious conduct&quot; of the Bank.  Accordingly, the referee awarded Solley\r\n  $233,000 in actual damages and $400,000 in punitive damages.[4]  The Bank filed a motion\r\n  for reconsideration and to set aside judgment pursuant to Rules 59(a),(e) and\r\n  60(b), SCRCP.  Solley filed a motion for reconsideration of the election of\r\n  remedies.  The referee denied all motions.  Both parties appealed.    \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An action in tort for\r\n  damages is an action at law.&quot;  Longshore v. Saber Sec. Servs., Inc.,\r\n  365 S.C. 554, 560, 619 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2005).  In an action\r\n  at law, the appellate court corrects errors of law, but\r\n  affirms the special referee's\r\n  factual findings unless no evidence reasonably supports those findings.  Roberts\r\n    v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).  The\r\n  trial court's findings are equivalent to a jury's findings in a law action.  King\r\n    v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 389, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).  &quot;We\r\n  must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the respondents and\r\n  eliminate from consideration all evidence to the contrary.&quot;  Sheek v.\r\n    Crimestoppers Alarm Sys.,&nbsp;297 S.C. 375, 377, 377 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1989).  Questions regarding credibility and weight of evidence are\r\n  exclusively for the trial court.  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; THE BANK'S APPEAL\r\nA. Sufficiency of Solley's\r\n  Complaint\r\nThe Bank argues Solley failed\r\n  to plead several of the elements of slander and thus the judgment is void. \r\n  Specifically, it contends the mortgage is not false and Solley did not plead\r\n  malice, plead special damages, or allege the value of the property was\r\n  diminished in the eyes of a third party.  We find this issue unpreserved.\r\nIn Bardoon Properties, NV\r\n  v. Eidolon Corp.,&nbsp;326 S.C. 166, 168, 485 S.E.2d 371, 372 (1997), the\r\n  defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment was\r\n  denied. After a damages hearing, the\r\n  plaintiff was awarded damages.  Id.  Subsequently, the defendant filed a\r\n  motion to reconsider in which it raised, for the first time, the plaintiff was\r\n  not the real party in interest.  Id.  That motion was denied.  Id. \r\n  On appeal, this court held the defendant had waived any challenge to the\r\n  plaintiff's status as the real party in interest by failing to object prior to the\r\n  entry of default.   Id.  The supreme court found\r\n  this court correctly held the issues raised by the defendant, not having been\r\n  timely raised prior to the entry of default, were\r\n  waived.  Id. at 171, 485 S.E.2d at 374.\r\nThe Bank first raised this\r\n  issue in its Rule 59(e), SCRCP, or in the alternative Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion\r\n  to reconsider and to set aside judgment, after damages were awarded and the\r\n  default judgment had been entered, much like Bardoon.  Accordingly, this\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.  \r\nB.&nbsp;  Special Damages\r\nThe Bank argues Solley is not\r\n  entitled to special damages because she did not plead them.  It further\r\n  contends she did not prove the damages and they are excessive.  We agree in\r\n  part.\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    trial judge has considerable discretion regarding the amount of damages, both\r\n    actual or punitive. Because of this discretion, our review on appeal is limited\r\n    to the correction of errors of law.  Our task in reviewing a damages award is\r\n    not to weigh the evidence, but to determine if there is any evidence to support\r\n    the damages award. \r\n  \r\n  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 310-11, 594\r\n    S.E.2d 867, 873&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (citations omitted).\r\nA defendant in default admits\r\n  liability but not the damages as set forth in the prayer for relief.  Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 566, 274 S.E.2d 290, 292 (1981).  The\r\n  amount of damages in a default action must be proved by the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.  Id.; see Jackson v. Midlands Human Res. Ctr.,\r\n  296 S.C. 526, 529, 374 S.E.2d 505, 507&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) (&quot;A judgment for money damages must be warranted by the\r\n  proof of the party in whose favor it is rendered.&quot;).\r\n\r\n  [T]here\r\n    is a difference between a defendant being declared in default and subsequently having judgment\r\n    entered against him for damages.  By defaulting, a defendant forfeits his\r\n    &quot;right to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint.&quot;  In essence,\r\n    the defaulting defendant has conceded liability. However, a defaulting\r\n    defendant does not concede the [a]mount of liability. \r\n\r\nHoward v. Holiday Inns,\r\n  Inc., 271 S.C. 238, 241-42, 246\r\n  S.E.2d 880, 882 (1978) (citations omitted).  At the\r\n  damages hearing, the defendant may only participate by cross-examining witnesses\r\n  and objecting to evidence.  Id. at 242, 246 S.E.2d at 882.\r\n\r\n  In a\r\n    default case, the plaintiff must prove by competent evidence the amount of his\r\n    damages, and such proof must be by a preponderance of the evidence.  Although\r\n    the defendant is in default as to liability, the award of damages must be in\r\n    keeping not only with the allegations of the complaint and the prayer for\r\n    relief, but also with the proof that has been submitted. \r\n\r\nJackson, 296 S.C. at 529, 374 S.E.2d at 506 (citations\r\n  omitted).  \r\n&quot;[T]o maintain a claim\r\n  for slander of title, the plaintiff must establish (1) the publication (2) with\r\n  malice (3) of a false statement (4) that is derogatory to plaintiff's title and\r\n  (5) causes special damages (6) as a result of diminished value of the property\r\n  in the eyes of third parties.&quot; Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. 142, 149,\r\n  459 S.E.2d 886, 891&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).  &quot;Actual malice can mean the\r\n  defendant acted recklessly or wantonly, or with conscious disregard of the\r\n  plaintiff's rights.&quot;  Constant v. Spartanburg Steel Prods., Inc.,\r\n  316 S.C. 86, 89, 447 S.E.2d 194, 196 (1994).\r\n&quot;Wrongfully recording an\r\n  unfounded claim against the property of another generally is actionable as\r\n  slander of title.&quot;  Huff, 319 S.C. at 149, 459 S.E.2d at 891.  &quot;[M]alice\r\n  merely means a lack of legal justification and is to be presumed if the\r\n  disparagement is false, if it caused damage, and if it is not privileged.&quot;  Home Invs. Fund v. Robertson, 295 N.E.2d 85, 87&nbsp;(Ill. App. Ct. 1973)\r\n  (citing Gates v. Utsey, 177 So. 2d 486, 488 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1965)). \r\n  In Huff, 319 S.C. at 149-50, 459 S.E.2d at 891, the court found a jury\r\n  reasonably could conclude the defendant published a false statement when she\r\n  filed a lien she knew or should have known was\r\n  invalid.  &quot;A publication is derogatory to the\r\n  plaintiff's title if the publication disparages or diminishes the quality,\r\n  condition, or value of the property.&quot;  Id. at 150, 459 S.E.2d at\r\n  891.  The court further found the defendant's lien clearly diminished the value\r\n  of the property in the eyes of a third party, given that the plaintiff was\r\n  required to discharge the lien before he could complete the refinancing of the\r\n  property.  Id.\r\nIn Huff, the defendant\r\n  also contended that the plaintiff had no claim for slander of title because the\r\n  lien was filed against only the plaintiff's former wife's interest in the\r\n  property and thus did not encumber the plaintiff's interest in the property.  Id. at 150 n.2, 459 S.E.2d at 891&nbsp;n.2.  In support of this argument, at oral\r\n  argument the defendant relied on the rule that a cotenant may separately encumber\r\n  his interest in property and such encumbrance binds only the cotenant's\r\n  interest in the property.  Id.  The property was owned by the plaintiff\r\n  and his ex-wife at the time the lien was recorded, and the lien specifically\r\n  stated it was placed against the property of both of them.  Id.  This\r\n  court found &quot;[w]hile it may be true that, had the lien been foreclosed and\r\n  the property sold, the lien could have been satisfied only through the [ex-w]ife's\r\n  interest in the property, the lien nonetheless attached to the property as\r\n  whole and affected the value of the property as a whole.&quot;  Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial\r\n  justice to all parties.&quot;  Rule 8(f), SCRCP; see also Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 338, 340 (1991) (holding to ensure substantial justice to the parties,\r\n  the pleadings must be liberally construed).  &quot;[T]echnical, restrictive or\r\n  outmoded requirements of Code Pleading are not necessarily required [under the\r\n  SCRCP].&quot;  Gaskins v. S. Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., 343 S.C. 666,\r\n  671, 541 S.E.2d 269, 271&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Harry M. Lightsey, Jr.\r\n  &amp; James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 93-94 (2nd ed. 1996)).\r\n\r\n  &quot;Special damages\r\n    recoverable in a slander of title action are the pecuniary losses that result 'directly\r\n    and immediately from the effect of the conduct of third persons, including\r\n    impairment of vendibility or value caused by disparagement, and the expense of\r\n    measures reasonably necessary to counteract the publication, including\r\n    litigation.'&quot;  Huff, 319 S.C. at 150-51, 459 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting\r\n    50 Am. Jur. 2d Libel &amp; Slander § 560; citing Restatement (Second) of\r\n    Torts § 633)).  In Huff, the plaintiff paid the defendant the money\r\n    demanded in the lien so that he could close the refinancing of the property.  Id. at 151, 459 S.E.2d at 892.  The court found, &quot;The money paid to satisfy\r\n    the lien was an expense necessary to counteract the publication and, therefore,\r\n    constitutes special damages.&quot;  Id.  \r\n\r\n[S]pecial\r\n  damages in the context of a slander of title claim can take at least two forms.\r\n   For instance, if a slanderous statement forces a party to sell land at a\r\n  reduced price, the reduction in value is a realized loss that can form the\r\n  basis of a damages award.  Alternatively, a landowner may take legal action to\r\n  remedy the effects of the slanderous statement.  To the extent that this legal\r\n  action is reasonably necessary to remove clouds from the party's title, the\r\n  party may recover those attorney fees.\r\nNeff v. Neff, 247 P.3d 380, 401 (Utah 2011) (footnotes omitted).\r\nThe Huff court relied\r\n  on TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 419 S.E.2d 870, 879\r\n  (W. Va. 1992), in determining the elements for slander of title.  319 S.C. at\r\n  149, 459 S.E.2d at 891.  The Huff court recognized that the TXO court had followed the guidelines the Restatement (Second) of Torts provided\r\n  for those elements.  Id.  In TXO, the court observed, &quot;Ordinarily,\r\n  attorneys' fees are not considered damages. However, slander of title is a\r\n  special case.&quot;  419 S.E.2d at 881.  The TXO court found &quot;[t]he\r\n  appellees spent $19,000 responding to TXO's declaratory judgment action that\r\n  the appellees would not have spent if TXO had not filed the false quitclaim\r\n  deed and then sued the appellees in an attempt to steal their land.&quot;  Id.  The court followed &quot;the clear majority rule in holding that attorneys'\r\n  fees incurred in removing spurious clouds from a title qualify as special\r\n  damages in an action for slander of title.&quot;  Id. (citing Rayl v.\r\n    Shull Enters., Inc., 700 P.2d 567 (Idaho 1984); Chesebro v. Powers,\r\n  44 N.W. 290 (Mich. 1889); Paulson v. Kustom Enters., Inc., 483 P.2d 708\r\n  (Mont. 1971); Den–Gar Enters. v. Romero, 611 P.2d 1119 (N.M. Ct. App. 1980), cert. denied, 614 P.2d 545 (N.M. 1980); Summa Corp. v. Greenspun,\r\n  655 P.2d 513 (Nev. 1982); Dowse v. Doris Trust Co., 208 P.2d 956 (Utah\r\n  1949); Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 633 (1977)).\r\nThe Restatement (Second) of\r\n  Torts § 633, which describes slander of title as a form of the general tort of\r\n  publication of an injurious falsehood, provides the following requirements for\r\n  special damages:\r\n\r\n  (1) The\r\n    pecuniary loss for which a publisher of injurious falsehood is subject to\r\n    liability is restricted to\r\n  \r\n    (a) the pecuniary loss that results directly and\r\n      immediately from the effect of the conduct of third persons, including impairment\r\n      of vendibility or value caused by disparagement, and\r\n    (b) the\r\n      expense of measures reasonably necessary to counteract the publication,\r\n      including litigation to remove the doubt cast upon vendibility or value by\r\n      disparagement.\r\n  \r\n\r\n&quot;[A]ttorney fees may be\r\n  recoverable as special damages if incurred 'to clear title or to undo any harm\r\n  created by whatever slander of title occurred.'&quot; Gillmor v.

Libel § 323 (2005) (&quot;Under some, but not all, authority, attorney's fees may\r\n  constitute special damages in an action for slander of title or injurious\r\n  falsehood.&quot;).\r\n&quot;[T]he trial court's\r\n  award of attorney fees as special damages is discretionary in slander of title\r\n  cases . . . .&quot;  Gillmor v. Cummings, 904 P.2d at 709&nbsp;(citing Day\r\n    v. W. Coast Holdings, Inc., 699 P.2d 1067, 1071 (Nev. 1985)).  &quot;[T]he\r\n  award of damages must be made on the basis of findings of fact supported by the\r\n  evidence.&quot;  Id. (citing Cabrera v. Cottrell, 694 P.2d 622,\r\n  625 (Utah 1985)). In Utah, when the trial court has not provided adequate\r\n  findings of fact concerning the special damages incurred, the court has remanded\r\n  to the trial court to properly determine the amount of damages that should be\r\n  awarded.  Id.\r\n\r\n  However,\r\n    there is some disagreement among the courts as to whether or not the injured\r\n    party, in order to establish special damages, must identify a particular\r\n    prospective purchaser who was prevented by the slander from buying the\r\n    disparaged property, some courts holding that a particular prospective\r\n    purchaser must be identified, unless it is impossible to do so, and others that a particular prospective purchaser need not be identified.\r\n\r\nJames O. Pearson, Jr.,\r\n  Annotation, What Constitutes Special Damages in Action for Slander of Title,\r\n  4 A.L.R.4th 532, 537 §2[a] (1981) (footnotes omitted).\r\nThe Utah Supreme Court has\r\n  denied recovery when a party's claim for harm to the value of his property has\r\n  been based on appraisal value instead of sale of the land at a reduced price,\r\n  because the damages had not yet been realized.  Neff, 247 P.3d at 401 (citing Valley Colour, Inc. v. Beuchert Builders, Inc., 944 P.2d 361, 364 (Utah\r\n  1997) (&quot;Proof of special damages usually involves demonstrating a sale at\r\n  a reduced price or at greater expense to the seller. It is not sufficient to\r\n  show that the land's value has dropped on the market, as this is general damage,\r\n  not a realized or liquidated loss.&quot;)).  The Utah court also reversed an\r\n  award of attorney's fees when plaintiffs took no action to clear the clouds\r\n  from their title, on the basis that the fees were gratuitous in the absence of\r\n  proof of any other damages.  Id. (citing Bass, 761 P.2d at 569).\r\nIn Sullivan v. Thomas\r\n  Organization, the defendants asserted the plaintiffs &quot;failed to allege\r\n  'special' damages, because mere unmarketability of title without the actual\r\n  loss of a sale is not a compensable injury.&quot;  276 N.W.2d 522, 526 (Mich. Ct.\r\n  App. 1979) (citing 50 Am. Jur. 2d Libel and Slander § 546, at 1065-66; William\r\n  L. Prosser, Law of Torts § 128, at 920 (4th ed. 1971)).  However, the Sullivan court noted that &quot;in Chesebro[, 44 N.W. 290], the [Michigan] Supreme\r\n  Court held that reasonable expenses incurred by the plaintiff in removing the\r\n  cloud from his title were recoverable as damages in a disparagement of title\r\n  action.&quot;  Sullivan, 276 N.W.2d at 526.   The plaintiffs in Sullivan requested as relief the cloud on their title be removed, as well as costs and\r\n  attorney's fees, and the court found this was a sufficient allegation of\r\n  special damages.  Id.\r\nIn determining whether it\r\n  allowed attorney's fees as special damages, the Washington Supreme Court noted\r\n  that it &quot;adhere[d] to the American rule, which states that absent a\r\n  contract, statute, or recognized ground of equity, the prevailing party does\r\n  not recover attorney fees as costs of litigation. Nevertheless, we have also\r\n  recognized certain circumstances where attorney fees should be recovered as\r\n  damages.&quot;  Rorvig v. Douglas, 873 P.2d 492, 497 (Wash. 1994)\r\n  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nThe court found it had allowed attorney's fees to be recoverable as\r\n  special damages in malicious prosecution and wrongful attachment or garnishment.\r\n   Id.  &quot;In malicious prosecution, it has long been the rule that\r\n  damages include the attorney fees for the underlying action made necessary by\r\n  the defendant's wrongful act.&quot;  Id.  &quot;Similarly, in wrongful\r\n  attachment or garnishment actions, and in actions to dissolve a wrongful\r\n  temporary injunction, attorney fees are a necessary expense incurred in\r\n  relieving the plaintiff of the wrongful attachment or temporary injunction, and\r\n  are recoverable.&quot;  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The\r\n  Washington court found:\r\n\r\n  Slander\r\n    of title is analogous to these actions.  It is the defendant who by intentional\r\n    and calculated action leaves the plaintiff with only one course of action: that\r\n    is, litigation. In malicious prosecution, wrongful attachment, and slander of\r\n    title, the defendants actually know their conduct forces the plaintiff to\r\n    litigate.  In addition, similar to malicious prosecution and wrongful\r\n    attachment, actual damages are difficult to establish and often times are\r\n    minimal in slander of title.  Fairness requires the plaintiff to have some\r\n    recourse against the intentional malicious acts of the defendant.\r\n\r\nId.  The court noted, &quot;The majority of jurisdictions\r\n  that have considered the question in recent years have adopted this rule.&quot;  Id. (citing Rayl, 700 P.2d at 573; Summa Corp., 655\r\n  P.2d at 515; Rogers v. Home Invs. Fund, 295 N.E.2d 85 (Ill. App. Ct. 1973); Dowse, 208 P.2d at 959).  &quot;The trend is to recognize that attorney\r\n  fees and other legal expenses incurred in clearing the disparaged title are\r\n  recoverable as damages in the common law action of slander of title.&quot;  Id. (citing James O. Pearson, Jr., Annotation, What Constitutes Special Damages\r\n    in Action for Slander of Title, 4 A.L.R.4th 532, 560 (1981)).  Additionally, &quot;the Restatement (Second) of\r\n  Torts supports allowing recovery of attorney fees in a slander of title action.  It describes\r\n  slander of title as a form of the general tort of publication of an injurious\r\n  falsehood.&quot;  Id.\r\nThe Tennessee Court of\r\n  Appeals has explained why attorney's fees are appropriate as special damages in\r\n  slander of title cases:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    sole way of dispelling another's wrongful assertion of title is by hiring an\r\n    attorney and litigating. If the defamed party were to simply speak out in\r\n    denial, as he might with a character attack, he could risk completely losing\r\n    title by adverse possession. The plaintiffs here were forced into court by the\r\n    defendants' actions. They were required to hire counsel, take depositions,\r\n    arrange for court reporters, and run up numerous other expenses. These costs,\r\n    which represented the only possible course of action to clear their title, flow\r\n    directly and proximately from the defendants' conduct. But for the defendants['\r\n    actions], the plaintiffs would not have incurred these expenses. As such, they\r\n    represent an actual pecuniary loss that, if substantiated, should be\r\n    recoverable as special damages.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  position we take today regarding proof of special damages and litigation\r\n  expenses is supported by the Restatement (Second) of Torts . . . .\r\n\r\n  Ezell v. Graves, 807 S.W.2d 700, 703&nbsp;(Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).\r\nIn Childers v. Commerce\r\n  Mortgage Investments,&nbsp;579 N.E.2d 219, 222 (Ohio Ct. App. 1989), the\r\n  trial court found the defendant liable to the plaintiffs for, among other\r\n  things, the entire amount for which they could have sold their house if not for\r\n  the defendant's actions and allowed the plaintiffs to keep the house.  The\r\n  court found, &quot;In effect, this gave the [plaintiffs] a double recovery, to\r\n  which they are not entitled.&quot;  Id.\r\nIn this case, as the dissent\r\n  and the Bank argue, the Bank's mortgage is a nullity.  However, unlike the\r\n  dissent and the Bank, we believe this makes Solley's action for slander of\r\n  title even stronger.  Recording a mortgage that is a nullity should be\r\n  considered a false statement derogatory to Solley's title.  Further, Solley's\r\n  expert witness testified she likely would not have been able to obtain a loan\r\n  on her share of the home due to Mullins's mortgage.  However, Solley did not\r\n  attempt to sell or mortgage her interest in the home.  The majority view\r\n  requires a party to actually suffer a loss, i.e. sell the property for less\r\n  than it was worth, not be able to sell the home at all, or be unable to obtain\r\n  a loan.  Solley did not attempt to do any of these things.  Solley and her\r\n  attorney contacted the Bank to discuss the mortgage, and the Bank would not\r\n  speak to her or her attorney about it.  Solley had no other choice than to\r\n  bring this lawsuit.  Accordingly, she is entitled to the cost of this litigation,\r\n  which is the $150 filing fee and her attorney's fees and costs in bringing the\r\n  action.  Accordingly, we remand this action to the special referee to determine\r\n  attorney's fees and costs.     \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\nThe\r\n  Bank argues Solley is not entitled to punitive damages because at most it made\r\n  a mistake in issuing the mortgage and did not harbor any ill will.  In the\r\n  alternative, it maintains the punitive damages are excessive compared to what\r\n  it contends are Solley's actual damages, the $150 filing fee.  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The purposes of\r\n  punitive damages are to punish the wrongdoer and deter the wrongdoer and others\r\n  from engaging in similar reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct in the\r\n  future,&quot; as well as &quot;to vindicate a private right of the injured\r\n  party by requiring the wrongdoer to pay money to the\r\n  injured party.&quot;  Clark v. Cantrell, 39 S.C. 369, 378-79, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  528, 533 (2000).  &quot;'Recklessness\r\n    implies the doing of a negligent act knowingly'; it is a 'conscious failure to\r\n    exercise due care.'&quot;  Berberich v.

App.\r\n    2005).  &quot;'In any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the\r\n    plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing\r\n    evidence.'&quot;  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C.\r\n    298, 313, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n    15-33-135).\r\nIn Cody P., Op No.\r\n  4875 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 93) this court found the trial court\r\n  properly denied the bank's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV)\r\n  on punitive damages.  In that case, the plaintiff presented evidence that bank\r\n  employees had not followed bank procedures when opening an account.  Id. \r\n  In the present case, Molony, Solley's banking expert, testified that anytime\r\n  two people were on a deed, a banker would want both people to sign the\r\n  mortgage, acknowledging the debt.  He stated that was the practice for 28 years\r\n  at the banks where he had been employed.  He testified to loan money on a piece\r\n  of property, one needs to look at who owns the property.  He further testified\r\n  that when putting a residential home loan on a piece of property, one needs to\r\n  get the consent of all the owners.  He testified he had seen no evidence in the\r\n  loan document the Bank had contacted Solley.  He stated that at his bank, as an\r\n  owner Solley would be required to acknowledge the debt one way or the other and\r\n  that the mortgage would encumber her property.\r\nBoth Solley's and Mullins's\r\n  names were on the loan they satisfied in 2005 or 2006 for the Property from the\r\n  Bank.  Accordingly, the Bank was on notice Solley was an owner of the\r\n  Property.  The Bank asserted in a post-trial motion it was misled by Mullins. \r\n  However, although we recognize the Bank was not allowed to present evidence\r\n  because it was in default, no evidence of any fraud is contained in the record.\r\n    Further, the deed on record with Jasper County was in both Mullins's and\r\n  Solley's names and thus any documents or information by Mullins that Solley no\r\n  longer owned the Property could have been easily verified by the Bank.  Solley\r\n  testified the Bank had not contacted her and she had no knowledge of the loan\r\n  until over a year-and-a-half after Mullins had obtained it.  Based on the banking\r\n  expert's testimony, the Bank's failure to verify the owner of the Property was\r\n  reckless.   In her complaint against the Bank, Solley alleges the Bank was\r\n  negligent and/or grossly negligent.  Because the Bank defaulted, all\r\n  allegations in the complaint are deemed admitted.  Additionally, the evidence\r\n  in the record indicates the Bank failed to have an attorney close the mortgage,\r\n  as required by law.  Further, even after being contacted by Solley's attorney,\r\n  the Bank did nothing to rectify the situation.  Accordingly, the record\r\n  contains sufficiently clear and convincing evidence for the special referee to\r\n  decide to award punitive damages.   \r\nBecause we are remanding this\r\n  case for the special referee to recalculate the actual damages, we also must remand\r\n  the award of punitive damages for determination in light of the new amount of\r\n  actual damages.  See Reid v. Harbison Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 319,\r\n  322, 345 S.E.2d 492, 493 (1986), overruled on other grounds by O'Neal\r\n    v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993) (&quot;Generally, actual\r\n  damages should not be separated from punitive damages for a retrial on actuals\r\n  alone.  Punitive damages may only be awarded if actuals are recovered, and\r\n  therefore, retrial only on actual damages may be improper since punitive\r\n  damages may change depending on the actual damage award. In the interest of\r\n  justice and fairness to all parties, both actual and punitive damages should be\r\n  reconsidered together on retrial.&quot; (citations omitted)).  Because the special\r\n  referee will make a new determination of Solley's punitive damages on remand,\r\n  we need not address the Bank's contention that the amount of punitive damages\r\n  was excessive.  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing an appellate court\r\n  need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is\r\n  dispositive of the appeal).  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; SOLLEY'S APPEAL\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Election of\r\n  Remedies\r\nSolley argues the special\r\n  referee erred by requiring her to elect a remedy prior to the damages hearing. \r\n  We find this issue unpreserved.\r\nThe record must show that the\r\n  issue was raised in the trial court.  Zaman v.

Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 195, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645&nbsp;(1998); see\r\n      also State v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305, 315-16, 642 S.E.2d 582, 588\r\n  (2007) (holding if an appellant conceded trial court's ruling was not\r\n  prejudicial, he could not assert on appeal the ruling denied him a fair trial); Ex parte McMillan, 319 S.C. 331, 335, 461 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1995) (providing a party cannot\r\n  concede an issue at trial and then complain on appeal).  \r\nThe record does not contain\r\n  the Bank's motion for Solley to elect a remedy or the special referee's ruling\r\n  on the matter.  The record does include what seems to be a summary of an\r\n  off-the-record hearing on the matter.  The special referee stated: \r\n\r\n  Let the\r\n    record reflect that after the close of testimony in the case, that [Solley]\r\n    elected to proceed in this matter on the cause of action for slander of title,\r\n    which it appears from the facts presented one way or the other would be the\r\n    probable cause of action and that's what [s]he's elected to proceed under as\r\n    far as arguing damages.\r\n\r\nThe record also contains\r\n  Solley's later request to be allowed to look further into which cause of action\r\n  she wished to pursue.  The Bank objected, stating Solley had &quot;made the\r\n  election, and [it] made [its] argument based on what was elected.&quot;  The\r\n  special referee stated, &quot;I'm not going to change the ruling as far as what\r\n  he's already moved and you've already elected, and I can't change that.&quot; \r\n  Even though the motion is alluded to after the ruling has occurred, we do not\r\n  have either side's argument on it or the referee's actual ruling.  Therefore, we\r\n  find this issue unpreserved.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumer Under\r\n  Federal Law\r\nSolley maintains the special\r\n  referee erred in finding she was not a consumer under federal law.  An\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal.  Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999).  Solley's\r\n  being considered a consumer does not relate to the slander of title cause of\r\n  action and instead seems to relate to the negligence cause of action. \r\n  Accordingly, because the slander of title cause of action is the only action\r\n  remaining, we need not consider this issue.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amending of Complaint\r\nSolley argues the special\r\n  referee erred in failing to allow her to\r\n  amend her complaint to conform to the evidence and issues actually tried.  An\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal.  Id.  Because of our\r\n  determination the Bank's argument regarding pleading the elements of slander of\r\n  title is unpreserved for our review, we need not reach this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  decision of the special referee is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring in\r\n  part and dissenting in part: I concur\r\n  in Section II of the majority opinion.  However, I would resolve the issues\r\n  addressed in Section I by finding the special referee committed two errors of\r\n  law: (1) awarding the amount of the loan as special damages and (2) awarding\r\n  punitive damages.  I would reverse the judgment of actual and punitive damages\r\n  and remand for a new trial as to actual damages only, at which Solley must\r\n  prove special damages proximately resulting from the conduct the Bank admitted\r\n  in default to be slander of title.  \r\nSolley is not entitled to the\r\n  value of the mortgage as special damages because the mortgage is ineffective. \r\n  Solley alleged she &quot;has and holds title as a joint tenant with rights of\r\n  survivorship to the above described real property.&quot;  Because the Bank defaulted,\r\n  that allegation is deemed to be true.  See Roche v. Young Bros.,\r\n    Inc., of Florence, 332 S.C. 75, 81, 504 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1998) (stating\r\n  &quot;the defaulting party is deemed to have admitted the truth of the\r\n  plaintiff's allegations&quot;).  \r\nTaking as true the allegation\r\n  that Solley and Mullins owned the property as joint tenants with a right of\r\n  survivorship, section 27-7-40 of the South Carolina Code (2007) prevented\r\n  Mullins from encumbering the property.  The statute states that if property is\r\n  held by joint tenants with a right of survivorship, such \r\n\r\n  joint\r\n    tenancy includes, and is limited to, the following incidents of ownership: . .\r\n    . (iii) The fee interest in real estate held in joint tenancy may not be\r\n    encumbered by a joint tenant acting alone without the joinder of the other\r\n    joint tenant or tenants in the encumbrance.  (iv) If all the joint tenants who\r\n    own real estate held in joint tenancy join in an encumbrance, the interest in\r\n    the real estate is effectively encumbered to a third party or parties. \r\n\r\n§ 27-7-40(iii)-(iv). \r\n  Therefore, because the mortgage is ineffective to encumber the property, it was\r\n  error for the special referee to award Solley $233,000.00 in actual damages.  \r\nThe majority argues that the\r\n  ineffectiveness of the mortgage makes Solley's slander of title action\r\n  stronger.  I do not disagree.  However, because the Bank admitted liability for\r\n  slander of title in default, the strength of Solley's case is not the issue. \r\n  The issue is the amount of special damages.  I would find it was improper for\r\n  the referee to measure the award of special damages by the amount of the\r\n  mortgage because the mortgage is ineffective and does not encumber the\r\n  property.  \r\nThe Bank argues Solley is not\r\n  entitled to punitive damages.  I agree.  Solley's cause of action for slander\r\n  of title against the Bank, even including allegations incorporated by\r\n  reference, does not contain any allegation of reckless or willful conduct. \r\n  Therefore, even by admitting Solley's allegations in default, the Bank has not\r\n  admitted liability for punitive damages.  See Mishoe v. QHG of Lake\r\n    City, Inc., 366 S.C. 195, 201, 621 S.E.2d 363, 366&nbsp;(Ct.

Catoe, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Petitioner,\r\n  Marlon Jermaine Smith, was convicted of armed robbery and use of a deadly\r\n  weapon during the commission of a violent crime.  The trial court imposed a\r\n  sentence of twenty-two years for armed robbery, and a concurrent five-year\r\n  sentence for the weapon charge.  This court granted certiorari to review\r\n  petitioner's belated appeal from the denial of his application for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR).  Petitioner asserts the PCR judge erred in\r\n  denying and dismissing his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\r\n  because trial counsel failed to (1) adequately communicate with petitioner, (2)\r\n  interview or present the testimony of witnesses, and (3) advise petitioner to\r\n  testify in his defense.  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was charged with armed robbery and use of a deadly\r\n  weapon during a violent crime stemming from his alleged participation in the\r\n  robbery of a Best Western Hotel.  The desk clerk at the motel testified that\r\n  while she was working on October 7, 1998, two men rushed in with guns and took\r\n  a money bag and a cell phone, along with her purse.  The clerk described one of\r\n  the men as being about 5'4&quot; or 5'5&quot;, and the other as being taller\r\n  and bigger.  Shortly after reporting the incident, the clerk was taken to\r\n  another location, and officers separately pulled three individuals from police\r\n  cars for the clerk to view, placing a spotlight on each.  The clerk did not\r\n  recognize the first individual, but recognized the second individual by his\r\n  clothes and build.  When the third individual was brought out, the clerk\r\n  &quot;knew it was him&quot; from the time she &quot;saw him and heard\r\n  him.&quot;  This person was around 5'4&quot; in height, and she recognized his\r\n  voice from the robbery.  She was also able to identify him because of his\r\n  clothes.  The clerk identified petitioner as this third individual, and stated\r\n  there was no doubt in her mind when she identified him.  When the clerk\r\n  identified petitioner to the police, she had a strong reaction, crying and\r\n  attempting to get away by exiting the police car, stating she was afraid he was\r\n  going to kill her. \r\nAfter a dispatch was issued concerning the robbery at the Best\r\n  Western, the police stopped a vehicle that was driven by petitioner and\r\n  occupied by two passengers.  Petitioner told the police that he was simply\r\n  giving the two passengers a ride.  One of the passengers, Cohiese Prince, told\r\n  the police he &quot;did not rob that motel.&quot;  When asked what motel he was\r\n  referring too, Prince became visibly nervous.  The other passenger, a juvenile\r\n  named Demetris, fled into a nearby wooded area and was subsequently\r\n  apprehended.  Demetris then led officers to a bush, where he had placed two\r\n  hand guns and a phone belonging to the motel.  Petitioner, who was also the\r\n  owner of the car, gave officers permission to search the vehicle.  The officers\r\n  found a bank bag full of money and the clerk's purse in the trunk of the car. \r\n  When asked, petitioner denied that anyone else had been driving the car or had\r\n  the keys to his car or had been in the trunk of his car that night.  Testimony\r\n  revealed petitioner was five feet and four inches tall, while Prince was six\r\n  feet and one inch and Demetris was six feet tall.\r\nPrince, who is petitioner's cousin and who was initially to be\r\n  tried along with petitioner, pled guilty to this robbery on the morning of the\r\n  trial.  Prince then testified on petitioner's behalf at the trial claiming he\r\n  and Demetris committed the armed robbery, and though petitioner drove them to\r\n  the Best Western, he was unaware that Prince and Demetris planned to rob the\r\n  motel.  According to Prince, petitioner was supposed to go pick up petitioner's\r\n  brother from work.  Trial counsel also presented petitioner's brother, John\r\n  Gause, as a witness.  Gause testified that on the night of the incident, he\r\n  asked petitioner to pick him up from work, but petitioner never showed. \r\n  Although petitioner initially indicated to the court that he wished to testify\r\n  on his own behalf, petitioner did not, in fact, take the stand, and the defense\r\n  rested after presenting the testimony of Gause and Prince.\r\nIn closing arguments, the defense attacked the eyewitness\r\n  identification of petitioner by the clerk, noting that the clerk's written\r\n  statement to police shortly after the incident indicated the two gunmen were\r\n  both of average height, whereas her testimony on the stand was distinctly\r\n  different, and further maintained that Prince's testimony supported their\r\n  defense that petitioner simply gave Prince and Demetris a ride and was unaware\r\n  of the robbery.  The State argued there were three possible scenarios for the\r\n  jury to consider: (1) that Prince and Demetris robbed the hotel and petitioner\r\n  knew nothing about it, (2) that Prince and Demetris robbed the hotel, but\r\n  petitioner knew about the robbery and was in on the plan, or (3) the clerk properly\r\n  identified petitioner as one of the two men who robbed her at gunpoint.  The\r\n  jury convicted petitioner as charged.        \r\nFollowing his direct appeal, petitioner filed an application for\r\n  PCR, which was denied and dismissed by Judge Thomas.  Petitioner thereafter\r\n  sought review of the denial of PCR pursuant to Austin v. State, 305 S.C.\r\n  453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991), alleging ineffective assistance of his original PCR\r\n  counsel in failing to seek review.  Judge Baxley issued a consent order for an Austin review; petitioner submitted a petition for writ of certiorari; and this court\r\n  subsequently granted the writ of certiorari.          \r\nISSUE\r\n Petitioner\r\n  contends the PCR judge improperly denied and dismissed his application,\r\n  asserting the result of the proceeding and his right to a fair trial were cast\r\n  in doubt by the ineffective assistance of trial counsel in that trial counsel\r\n  (1) failed to adequately communicate with him, (2) failed to interview or\r\n  present the testimony of witnesses, and (3) failed to advise petitioner to\r\n  testify in his defense.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nUnder the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 684-86 (1984); Lomax v. State, 379 S.C.\r\n  93, 100, 665 S.E.2d 164, 167 (2008).  &quot;There is a strong presumption that\r\n  counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional\r\n  judgment in making all significant decisions in the case.&quot;  Ard v.\r\n    Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007).  The burden of proof\r\n  is on the applicant in a PCR proceeding to prove the allegations in his\r\n  application.  Id.  &quot;On appeal, the PCR court's ruling should be\r\n  upheld if it is supported by any evidence of probative value in the\r\n  record.&quot;  Simuel v. State, 390 S.C. 267, 270, 701 S.E.2d 738, 739\r\n  (2010).  \r\n\r\nTo establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the PCR\r\n  applicant must prove:  (1) counsel's performance fell below an objective\r\n  standard of reasonableness, and (2) counsel's deficient performance prejudiced\r\n  the defendant's case.  &quot;An error by counsel, even if professionally\r\n  unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal\r\n  proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.&quot;  To establish\r\n  prejudice, the defendant is required &quot;to show that there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\n  proceeding would have been different.  A reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.&quot;  \r\n\r\nSmith v. State, 386 S.C. 562, 565-66, 689 S.E.2d 629,\r\n  631 (2010) (citing to and quoting from Strickland, 466 U.S. 668).  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Failure to Communicate\r\nIn regard to petitioner's allegation that trial counsel failed to\r\n  adequately consult with him and prepare his case, the PCR judge noted that\r\n  brevity of time spent in consultation, without more, is insufficient to\r\n  establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and petitioner failed to point to\r\n  any specific matters counsel failed to discover, aside from other allegations\r\n  of ineffective assistance of counsel, for which the court found no merit.\r\nPetitioner contends the PCR court erred in dismissing and denying\r\n  his application for relief, asserting the result of the proceeding and his\r\n  right to a fair trial were cast in doubt by the ineffective assistance of trial\r\n  counsel in that trial counsel failed to adequately communicate with his\r\n  client.  Petitioner argues that during the hearing, trial counsel confirmed\r\n  that he met with petitioner only twice, once prior to trial and then again on\r\n  the day of the trial.  Trial counsel also admitted that he would have had to\r\n  have discussed discovery with petitioner immediately prior to the trial. \r\n  Petitioner also contends trial counsel only took about five to ten minutes to\r\n  explain to him that he should not testify.  Accordingly, petitioner maintains\r\n  that as a result of trial counsel's failure to adequately communicate with him,\r\n  trial counsel was not sufficiently familiar with petitioner's version of events\r\n  to defend against the armed robbery charge, counsel did not prepare petitioner\r\n  to testify, petitioner was not prepared to examine Prince in depth, and counsel\r\n  failed to call petitioner's character witnesses to testify. \r\nWe find petitioner failed to demonstrate that trial counsel's\r\n  preparation and communication with him was inadequate, and further failed to\r\n  offer any evidence or argument as to how counsel's alleged lack of preparation\r\n  or communication prejudiced him.  At the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified\r\n  in regard to his trial preparation that he had a taped statement from Demetris\r\n  and, even though petitioner's and Prince's defenses were somewhat antagonistic\r\n  toward each other, he was in contact with Prince's attorney on several\r\n  occasions and they were able to work together.  He did not inform the\r\n  Solicitor's office of the possibility that a co-defendant might testify that\r\n  petitioner did not commit the robbery because it was not until Prince pled\r\n  guilty that morning that such information arose.  Thus, trial counsel did not\r\n  anticipate any testimony from Prince.  Trial counsel stated he reviewed the\r\n  co-defendants' statements prior to trial, spoke with Prince's attorney,\r\n  discussed the State's plea offer with petitioner, filed for discovery, and\r\n  reviewed the discovery material with petitioner prior to trial.  Trial counsel\r\n  also spoke with petitioner's mother concerning petitioner's defense, and\r\n  arranged for a polygraph examination of petitioner.  He further acknowledged\r\n  that he reviewed the discovery material with petitioner immediately prior to trial,\r\n  and that petitioner was able to read the discovery material; he talked with\r\n  petitioner about the material and made him aware of the State's evidence;\r\n  petitioner was able to tell counsel his differing version of the facts; and\r\n  petitioner seemed to understand the material.  Additionally, trial counsel did\r\n  not feel like he needed a continuance, but felt he was prepared to go to\r\n  trial.  Further, the record shows the trial judge informed petitioner of his\r\n  right to testify or not testify, and petitioner agreed with the trial judge\r\n  that he had discussed this right with trial counsel.  The trial judge then\r\n  allowed a ten minute break for petitioner to further discuss the matter with\r\n  counsel.  Finally, petitioner testified at his PCR hearing that there was\r\n  nothing he could think of that was requested of trial counsel that counsel did not\r\n  do for petitioner.\r\nThus, the uncontradicted evidence in the record shows that counsel\r\n  met with petitioner prior to trial, discussed the discovery materials with him,\r\n  and provided petitioner the opportunity to explain his version of the events. \r\n  Counsel further prepared for the defense by arranging a polygraph examination\r\n  and meeting with petitioner's mother to discuss the incident and petitioner's defense. \r\n  Counsel also consulted with petitioner throughout the two day trial. \r\n  Additionally, the record reflects petitioner indicated to the trial court that\r\n  he had discussed with trial counsel the right to testify, and the trial court\r\n  thereafter gave petitioner an additional ten minutes to discuss his decision\r\n  with trial counsel.  The brevity of time spent in consultation with a defendant\r\n  alone is not indicative of inadequate trial preparation.  Harris v. State,\r\n  377 S.C. 66, 75, 659 S.E.2d 140, 145 (2008).  Additionally, petitioner did not\r\n  offer any evidence of how additional preparation or communication would have\r\n  resulted in a different outcome.  See Jackson v. State, 329 S.C.\r\n  345, 353-54, 495 S.E.2d 768, 772 (1998) (where PCR applicant failed to present\r\n  any evidence of what counsel could have discovered or what other defenses he\r\n  would have requested counsel pursue had counsel more fully prepared for the\r\n  trial, applicant failed to show his counsel's lack of preparation prejudiced\r\n  him); Skeen v. State, 325 S.C. 210, 214-15, 481 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1997)\r\n  (finding applicant was not entitled to post-conviction relief where there was\r\n  no evidence presented at the PCR hearing to show how additional preparation\r\n  would have had any possible effect on the result of the trial).  \r\nII.&nbsp; Failure to Interview and Present Witnesses\r\nOn the issue of failure to call witnesses, the PCR judge held\r\n  prejudice from trial counsel's failure to interview or call witnesses cannot be\r\n  shown where the witnesses did not testify at the PCR hearing, and petitioner's\r\n  mere speculation as to what a witness' testimony would have been could not\r\n  satisfy his burden of showing prejudice.\r\nPetitioner contends the PCR judge erred in denying and dismissing\r\n  his application for PCR based on trial counsel's failure to interview his\r\n  co-defendant or call his character witnesses to testify at trial.  He argues,\r\n  as a result of Prince's testimony, the State altered its theory of the case,\r\n  switching from relying on the clerk's identification of petitioner to proposing\r\n  that petitioner was merely &quot;driving the get-away car&quot; and must have\r\n  been aware the robbery was taking place.  Petitioner contends, because trial\r\n  counsel failed to interview Prince prior to trial, he was not prepared for the\r\n  change in the State's theory and was thus able to perform only a limited\r\n  examination of Prince and made no attempt to blunt the prosecution's response\r\n  that Prince and petitioner were &quot;family.&quot;  Petitioner further\r\n  contends trial counsel failed to call petitioner's character witnesses to the\r\n  stand, even though he had asked counsel to speak with them and they were\r\n  present in the courtroom at the time of his trial.  Petitioner argues, although\r\n  these character witnesses did not testify at the PCR hearing, at least one of\r\n  the character witnesses was present at the PCR hearing.  Petitioner asserts the\r\n  substance of the character witnesses' testimony should be presumed. \r\nRule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR\r\n  provides as follows:\r\n\r\nIn representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the\r\n  subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented\r\n  by another lawyer in the matter unless the lawyer has the consent of the other\r\n  lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.\r\n\r\nThus, trial\r\n  counsel properly communicated with Prince's attorney during the pre-trial\r\n  phase.  Further, trial counsel testified at the PCR hearing that just prior to\r\n  Prince's testimony, once he decided to plead guilty, counsel met with Prince\r\n  and the solicitor to discuss Prince's statement that petitioner was not\r\n  involved in the robbery.  All indications were that Prince decided to take a\r\n  plea agreement at the last minute, and it was not until then that trial counsel\r\n  was able to learn that Prince would testify petitioner was unaware of the\r\n  robbery.  Once counsel learned of this change, he called Prince to testify on\r\n  petitioner's behalf.  Additionally, petitioner failed to present any testimony\r\n  from Prince at the PCR hearing to establish prejudice from any inadequate\r\n  questioning of Prince at trial.  Further, there is nothing in the record to\r\n  indicate that interviewing Prince prior to Prince's guilty plea would have led\r\n  to any different result.  See Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329,\r\n  334, 496 S.E.2d 415, 417 (1998) (holding, where there was nothing in the record\r\n  to indicate that interviewing the victims would have led to any different\r\n  result, trial counsel's failure to conduct an independent investigation did not\r\n  constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, as the allegation was supported\r\n  only by mere speculation as to the result).     \r\nAs well, petitioner failed to present any testimony from the\r\n  alleged character witnesses at the PCR hearing in order to establish prejudice\r\n  from the lack of testimony of these witnesses at trial.  Thus, petitioner\r\n  failed to show trial counsel's actions or inactions resulted in prejudice.  See Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 303, 509 S.E.2d 807, 809 (1998)\r\n  (noting our courts have &quot;repeatedly held a PCR applicant must produce the\r\n  testimony of a favorable witness or otherwise offer the testimony in accordance\r\n  with the rules of evidence at the PCR hearing in order to establish prejudice\r\n  from the witness' failure to testify at trial&quot;); Glover v. State,\r\n  318 S.C. 496, 499, 458 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1995) (holding a PCR applicant's mere\r\n  speculation as to what the witnesses' testimony would have been cannot, by\r\n  itself, satisfy the burden of showing prejudice).  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Failure\r\n  to Advise Petitioner to Testify\r\nPetitioner's PCR application alleged numerous grounds to support\r\n  his assertion of ineffective assistance of trial counsel but, notably, did not\r\n  specifically assert counsel was ineffective in advising petitioner not to\r\n  testify at trial.  Rather, in regard to the presentation of witness testimony,\r\n  petitioner simply maintained that trial counsel &quot;presented no witnesses on\r\n  [his] behalf, not even a character witness.&quot;  At the PCR hearing, the\r\n  judge asked PCR counsel to specify what allegations of ineffective assistance\r\n  were being made so the court would know what allegations had been abandoned. \r\n  PCR counsel then outlined the various allegations contained in petitioner's\r\n  application, again maintaining trial counsel &quot;presented no witnesses on\r\n  [petitioner's] behalf, not even a character witness,&quot; but PCR counsel failed\r\n  to specifically assert error in trial counsel's advice to petitioner that he\r\n  not testify.  During the PCR hearing, however, PCR counsel questioned trial\r\n  counsel as to how many witnesses he called on behalf of petitioner, and trial counsel\r\n  incorrectly stated he called no defense witnesses, including petitioner.  PCR\r\n  counsel thereafter asked trial counsel how many witnesses the State called, to\r\n  which counsel replied that the State had called eleven witnesses, and agreed\r\n  with PCR counsel that zero witnesses had been called on behalf of petitioner. \r\n  However, a review of the trial transcript reveals that the State called nine\r\n  witnesses to testify before the jury, and trial counsel called two witnesses;\r\n  petitioner's brother, John Gause, and co-defendant Prince.  Based on this\r\n  misapprehension that the defense called no witnesses, trial counsel testified\r\n  that he advised petitioner against testifying at his trial in order to\r\n  &quot;preserve the last close in this case.&quot;  Counsel noted that the\r\n  clerk's written statement regarding the height description of the two robbers\r\n  differed from her trial testimony, but he believed he could illustrate that\r\n  point without having petitioner testify.  Trial counsel also testified he\r\n  discussed with petitioner the strategy of not calling petitioner to the stand in\r\n  order to maintain last argument, but also discussed with petitioner &quot;the\r\n  dangers, the advantages and disadvantages of him testifying.&quot;  \r\nPetitioner testified at the hearing that he thought the outcome of\r\n  his trial would have been different had he been able to tell the jury what\r\n  happened that night, and one of his bases for a new trial was that trial\r\n  counsel advised him not to testify.  In his summation to the court, PCR counsel\r\n  argued that the State called eleven witnesses, while trial counsel called zero\r\n  witnesses in petitioner's defense.  PCR counsel further maintained, given the\r\n  way the State had to change gears during the trial, that petitioner &quot;could\r\n  have shed some light on the fact that maybe it wasn't him,&quot; creating doubt\r\n  for the jury that ultimately convicted petitioner.  Importantly, no one\r\n  corrected the misapprehension that the defense presented no witnesses and was\r\n  thereby able to present the last closing argument.\r\nIn her order of dismissal, the PCR judge addressed several\r\n  allegations raised by petitioner, but did not specifically address whether\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective for advising petitioner not to testify at trial\r\n  or whether petitioner was prejudiced thereby.  However, the following language\r\n  was included in the order:\r\n\r\nAs to any and all allegations which were raised in the\r\n  application or at the hearing in this matter and not specifically addressed in\r\n  this Order, this Court finds that the applicant failed to present any evidence\r\n  regarding such allegations.  Accordingly, this Court finds that the applicant\r\n  waived such allegations and failed to meet his burden of proof regarding them.  \r\n. . . Therefore, any and all allegations not specifically\r\n  addressed in this Order are hereby denied and dismissed.\r\n\r\nPetitioner asserts the PCR judge erred in denying and dismissing\r\n  his application for PCR where the result of the proceedings and his right to a\r\n  fair trial were cast in doubt by ineffective assistance of trial counsel in\r\n  that trial counsel advised petitioner not to testify in his own defense.  He\r\n  contends trial counsel acknowledged that petitioner was intelligent enough to\r\n  testify at trial, and that, in retrospect, putting petitioner on the stand\r\n  &quot;could have made a difference.&quot;  Most importantly, petitioner argues\r\n  trial counsel's explanation that he made a strategic decision to forgo the\r\n  benefit of petitioner's testimony in exchange for the right to last argument\r\n  was objectively unreasonable and established counsel's assistance was\r\n  ineffective because trial counsel did, in fact, call witnesses to the stand and\r\n  the defense was not afforded the last argument.  Petitioner maintains that, but\r\n  for trial counsel's ineffective performance in advising petitioner not to testify\r\n  in his defense, the result of the proceeding would very likely have been\r\n  different.  \r\nWe agree with the State's contention that this issue is not\r\n  preserved for review.  It is clear that the PCR court did not rule on\r\n  petitioner's assertion at the PCR hearing that he was entitled to a new trial\r\n  based on trial counsel's advice that he not testify.  Additionally, there is no\r\n  indication in the record that petitioner filed a Rule 59(e) SCRCP, motion to\r\n  address the matter.  Our supreme court has made it abundantly clear that, where\r\n  a PCR court fails to set forth findings and the reasons for those findings, the\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review if the petitioner fails to make a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion requesting the PCR court make specific findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law on the allegations.  Marlar v. State, 375 S.C. 407,\r\n  408-10, 653 S.E.2d 266, 266-67 (2007).  The court in Marlar noted that\r\n  &quot;[p]ursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 17-27-80 (2003), the PCR judge must make\r\n  specific findings of fact and state expressly the conclusions of law relating\r\n  to each issue presented,&quot; and the failure to specifically rule on the\r\n  issues precludes appellate review of the issues.  Id.  at 408, 653\r\n  S.E.2d at 266.  Further, the court in Marlar held language in the PCR\r\n  court's order similar to that contained in the order at hand - providing that\r\n  as to any allegations raised in the application or at the hearing not\r\n  specifically addressed by the PCR order, the PCR court found that the applicant\r\n  failed to present any evidence regarding such allegations -- did not constitute\r\n  a sufficient ruling on any issues since it did not set forth specific findings\r\n  of fact and conclusions of law.  Id. at 409, 653 S.E.2d at 266.  Thus, this\r\n  language in the order in the present matter is not sufficient to preserve the\r\n  issue for review.  Accordingly, we hold this issue is not preserved for review,\r\n  as the PCR court did not rule on the matter and petitioner failed to make a\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment to include specific\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.  At any rate, this argument is also\r\n  not preserved inasmuch as it was not raised to or ruled upon by the PCR judge.  Petitioner\r\n  did not argue to the PCR court, as he does on appeal, that counsel's advice to\r\n  forego testifying in order to gain last argument was not objectively reasonable\r\n  and fell far below the professional standard where counsel did not, in fact,\r\n  make the last argument.  Indeed, the fact that trial counsel called two\r\n  witnesses to the stand for the defense and that he was therefore not afforded\r\n  the last closing argument was never brought to the PCR court's attention.  See Kolle v. State, 386 S.C. 578, 589, 690 S.E.2d 73, 79 (2010) (noting an\r\n  issue that was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the PCR court is not preserved\r\n  for appellate review); State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620\r\n  S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005) (finding argument advanced on appeal was not raised and\r\n  ruled on below and therefore was not preserved for review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing reasons, the order denying petitioner's PCR\r\n  application is\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\nPIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4940","title":"York County v.

Harmon, of Greenville, for Respondent C&amp;D Management\r\n  Company, LLC.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: The South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (DHEC) issued C&amp;D Management Company a permit for a\r\n  construction, demolition, and land-clearing debris landfill in York County.  The\r\n  County challenged that decision before the Administrative Law Court (ALC),\r\n  which ruled in favor of C&amp;D Management.  The County appeals the ALC's judgment,\r\n  arguing DHEC impermissibly ignored a County ordinance purporting to impose a\r\n  moratorium on the construction of any new landfills.  We affirm.I.&nbsp; Facts and Procedural\r\n    History\r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and\r\n  Management Act provides that each county must adopt a solid waste management\r\n  plan.  S.C. Code Ann. § 44-96-80 (2002).  Before DHEC may issue any permit\r\n  for the construction and operation of a landfill in a particular county, DHEC\r\n  must determine that the proposed landfill is consistent with the county's solid\r\n  waste management plan and other applicable local ordinances.  S.C. Code Ann. § 44-96-290(F)\r\n  (2002).\r\n  \r\nIn August 2005, C&amp;D Management\r\n  submitted an application to DHEC for a permit for the landfill.  At that time, York\r\n  County managed its solid waste using the 1994 Catawba Regional Solid Waste\r\n  Management Plan (1994 Plan).  In September 2005, DHEC issued a letter to\r\n  C&amp;D Management stating it made a determination that the landfill was\r\n  consistent with the 1994 Plan. \r\n  \r\nWhile DHEC continued to process C&amp;D\r\n  Management's application over the next year, the County moved towards adopting\r\n  a new solid waste management plan.  On January 9, 2007, York County Council passed\r\n  what it called an &quot;emergency ordinance,&quot; which stated &quot;all\r\n  proposed landfills and landfill expansions not yet permitted by DHEC are\r\n  declared inconsistent with the 1994 Plan.&quot;  The emergency ordinance described\r\n  the declaration as a &quot;moratorium&quot; that would give the County more\r\n  time to complete and adopt a new plan.    \r\n  Initially, DHEC believed the emergency ordinance\r\n    prevented it from issuing C&amp;D Management a permit for the landfill. \r\n    However, DHEC ultimately determined the emergency ordinance did not affect its\r\n    determination that the proposed landfill was consistent with the 1994 Plan.  On\r\n    February 22, 2007, it issued C&amp;D Management a permit.    \r\n  \r\nThe County asked the South Carolina Board\r\n  of Health and Environmental Control to review DHEC's decision to issue the\r\n  permit.  The Board declined, and the County requested a contested case\r\n  hearing before the ALC.   \r\n  \r\nThe ALC affirmed DHEC's decision to issue\r\n  the permit.  With regard to the emergency ordinance, the ALC determined that\r\n  under Southeast Resource Recovery, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of\r\n  Health &amp; Environmental Control, 358 S.C. 402, 595 S.E.2d 468&nbsp;(2004)\r\n  (per curiam), DHEC could not defer to the County's declaration of\r\n  inconsistency, as doing so would amount to an improper delegation of DHEC's exclusive\r\n  authority over permitting decisions for solid waste management facilities.  The\r\n  ALC therefore concluded DHEC properly disregarded the emergency ordinance in making\r\n  its permitting decision. \r\n  \r\nII.&nbsp; Effect of the Emergency\r\n    Ordinance\r\n  We agree DHEC properly disregarded the emergency\r\n    ordinance.  Our supreme court has made clear that DHEC alone has the authority\r\n    to make consistency determinations.  In Southeast Resource Recovery, the\r\n    court held DHEC may not delegate that authority to counties.  358 S.C. at 408,\r\n    595 S.E.2d at 471.  Prior to the court's decision in that case, DHEC's practice\r\n    was to leave consistency determinations to county governments, which issued their\r\n    determinations in the form of letters of consistency.  Id.  The court\r\n    held the practice was impermissible, stating: \r\n\r\n  There is no statutory authority providing a county's\r\n    consistency determination is determinative of the ultimate permitting\r\n    decision.  Although Section 44-96-290(F) requires a proposed facility comply\r\n    with local standards, it does not designate the county as the final arbiter on\r\n    whether the proposed facility complies with its local zoning, land use, and\r\n    other ordinances. \r\n  . . . DHEC, not\r\n    the county, is charged with ensuring [solid waste management] facilities meet\r\n    the requirements for permitting.  \r\n\r\n  Id.; see also Sandlands C &amp; D, LLC v. Cnty. of Horry, 394 S.C. 451, 463, 716 S.E.2d 280, 286 (2011)\r\n    (stating &quot;there is no doubt the express language of the [Solid Waste\r\n    Policy and Management Act] provides for DHEC's exclusive authority in the area\r\n    of permitting&quot; (emphasis in original omitted)).  \r\n  We view the emergency ordinance as an effort by the County\r\n    to control DHEC's permitting decision.  The only effect the emergency ordinance\r\n    purports to have is to impose a &quot;moratorium&quot; on new and expanded landfills\r\n    in York County.  The section entitled &quot;Scope of Moratorium&quot; states in\r\n    its entirety: &quot;During the time that the emergency moratorium is in effect,\r\n    all proposed landfills and landfill expansions not yet permitted by DHEC are\r\n    declared inconsistent with the 1994 Plan.&quot;  No other language in the\r\n    emergency ordinance explains the scope or the effect of the moratorium.  Therefore,\r\n    by its own terms, the emergency ordinance merely makes a blanket determination\r\n    that all new landfills are inconsistent with the 1994 Plan.  \r\n  Looking past the emergency ordinance's\r\n    &quot;moratorium&quot; label and focusing instead on its content and actual effect,\r\n    we find no meaningful distinction between the emergency ordinance and the\r\n    letters of consistency that Southeast Resource Recovery prohibits DHEC\r\n    from following.  In both situations, a county makes a consistency determination\r\n    regarding a proposed landfill—a power only DHEC may exercise.  The only\r\n    difference here is that instead of DHEC willingly delegating its authority to\r\n    local government, as it did in Southeast Resource Recovery, local\r\n    government has attempted to usurp that authority.  Because DHEC could not\r\n    follow the emergency ordinance without delegating its authority in violation of Southeast Resource Recovery, DHEC was required to disregard it.  \r\n  The County argues it had the authority to enact the\r\n    emergency ordinance, and because subsection 44-96-290(F) requires DHEC to\r\n    consider &quot;applicable local ordinances&quot; when it makes a consistency\r\n    determination, DHEC was required to consider whether the proposed landfill was\r\n    consistent with the emergency ordinance.  We disagree.  Subsection 44-96-80(K),\r\n    on which the County relies for its authority, prohibits a county from enacting\r\n    an ordinance that is inconsistent with state law.  As Southeast Resource Recovery explains, it is\r\n    inconsistent with state law for DHEC to follow a county's consistency\r\n    determination.  See 358 S.C. at 408, 595 S.E.2d at 471.  In this respect,\r\n    the emergency ordinance is not consistent with state law, and is therefore not\r\n    &quot;applicable&quot; under subsection 44-96-290(F).  DHEC properly\r\n    disregarded the emergency ordinance.\r\n  III.&nbsp; Other Issues  \r\nThe remaining\r\n    issues the County raises relate to factual determinations.  As to those issues,\r\n    we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: S.C.\r\n    Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2010) (providing this court may reverse a\r\n    decision of the ALC that is &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n    probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record&quot;); Risher v.\r\n      S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 204, 712 S.E.2d\r\n    428, 431 (2011) (stating a factual decision of the ALC should be upheld if it\r\n    is supported by substantial evidence in the record). \r\n  \r\nThe judgment of the\r\n    Administrative Law Court is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  PIEPER, J., concurs.  \r\n  LOCKEMY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n  LOCKEMY, J. dissenting:  I respectfully dissent. Although I agree with the majority decision to\r\n    affirm the other issues, I would reverse the ALC's determination that the\r\n    proposed landfill was consistent with the 1994 Plan, and revoke C&amp;D's permit\r\n    for the proposed landfill based on the County Council's enactment of the\r\n    emergency ordinance. \r\n  The ALC determined the County Council enacted the\r\n    emergency ordinance in an attempt to affect DHEC's permitting decision, and\r\n    therefore, it was impermissible under Southeast Resource Recovery.  The\r\n    ALC also found, underSimpkins v. City\r\n      of Gaffney, 315 S.C. 26, 431 S.E.2d\r\n    592&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993), that the County Council lacked the authority to enact\r\n    an ordinance imposing a moratorium on DHEC's permitting authority.  According\r\n    to the ALC, the emergency ordinance was an attempt by the County Council to\r\n    affect DHEC's permitting decisions, and therefore, it was inconsistent with\r\n    sections 44-96-260(2) and 44-96-290(A) of the Solid Waste Act, which give DHEC\r\n    the exclusive authority to issue permits for the construction of solid waste\r\n    management facilities.  I disagree.  \r\n  I would find the ALC erred in determining the\r\n    emergency ordinance was inconsistent with the Solid Waste Act.  Pursuant to\r\n    section 44-96-80(K),  \r\n\r\n  [t]he governing body of a county is authorized to\r\n    enact such ordinances as may be necessary to carry out its responsibilities\r\n    under this chapter; provided, however, that the governing body of a county may\r\n    not enact an ordinance inconsistent with the state solid waste management plan,\r\n    with any provision of this chapter, with any other applicable provision of\r\n    state law, or with any regulation promulgated by the department providing for\r\n    the protection of public health and safety or for protection of the\r\n    environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. § 44-96-80(K) (2002).  While DHEC has the sole authority to\r\n    issue landfill permits and make consistency determinations, the governing body\r\n    of each county has the authority, pursuant to section 44-96-80(A), to determine\r\n    the content of the county's solid waste management plan.  In addition, counties\r\n    have the authority to enact ordinances to carry out their responsibilities\r\n    under their plans.  Here, the County Council adopted the emergency ordinance to\r\n    preserve the status quo while it reviewed and modified its solid waste plan.  The\r\n    County began efforts to revise its solid waste management plan in 2003.  In\r\n    August 2006, the County Council gave first reading to Ordinance 207 which\r\n    authorized the County to withdraw from the 1994 Plan and adopt a new County\r\n    solid waste management plan.  Thereafter, in October 2006, the County Council\r\n    gave second reading to Ordinance 207.  On January 8, 2007, the County Council\r\n    adopted the emergency ordinance.  On January 30, 2007, DHEC notified C&amp;D it\r\n    was holding C&amp;D's landfill permit in abeyance while it considered the\r\n    effect and validity of the emergency ordinance. Thereafter, on February 22,\r\n    2007, DHEC determined the emergency ordinance did not amend the 1994 Plan and\r\n    issued C&amp;D a permit for the proposed landfill.  On February 28, 2007, the\r\n    County Council gave third reading and adopted Ordinance 207 which created a\r\n    separate York County Solid Waste Management Plan.  \r\n   The emergency ordinance stated that &quot;an imminent peril\r\n    to the public health, safety, welfare and property rights require[d] the\r\n    adoption of an emergency ordinance and moratorium.&quot;  The emergency\r\n    ordinance further provided that its adoption was necessary to give the County\r\n    sufficient time to study and review issues concerning the impact of\r\n    unprecedented growth and development, and to evaluate the need for additional\r\n    waste disposal sites.  I would find the County Council acted within its\r\n    authority under section 44-96-80(K) in enacting the emergency ordinance.  See Sandlands, 394 S.C. at 463-64, 716 S.E.2d at 286 (holding neither the Solid\r\n    Waste Act nor the DON Regulation contain express provisions prohibiting county\r\n    regulation of the flow of waste) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 44-96-80 (A), (J),\r\n    (K); S.C. Code Ann. § 44-96-290(F) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;[N]o permit to construct\r\n    a new solid waste management facility or to expand an existing solid waste\r\n    management facility within a county or municipality may be issued by the\r\n    department unless the proposed facility or expansion is consistent with local\r\n    zoning, land use, and other applicable local ordinances, if any[.]&quot;)\r\n    (emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. § 61–107.B.5.c (Supp. 2010) (requiring\r\n    consistency determinations account for any local ordinances)).\r\n  I would also find neither Southeast Resource\r\n    Recovery nor Simpkins are applicable in this case.  In Southeast\r\n      Resource Recovery, our supreme court found DHEC's practice of delegating to\r\n    the counties the authority to determine consistency through the counties'\r\n    issuance of letters of consistency was impermissible.  358 S.C. at 408, 595\r\n    S.E.2d at 471. &nbsp;The court determined that although section 44-96-290(F)\r\n    &quot;requires a proposed facility comply with local standards, it does not\r\n    designate the county as the final arbiter on whether the proposed facility\r\n    complies with its local zoning, land use, and other ordinances.&quot;  Id.   Southeast Resource Recovery is not applicable to this case because the\r\n    emergency ordinance is not a consistency determination.  The emergency\r\n    ordinance was adopted by the County Council to carry out the County's solid\r\n    waste plan as authorized by section 44-96-80(K). \r\n  I would also find the ALC erred in relying on Simpkins in determining the County Council lacked the authority to impose a moratorium\r\n    on DHEC's permitting decisions.  In Simpkins, this court found a city\r\n    council did not have the authority to put a moratorium in place by merely\r\n    passing a motion to that effect.  315 S.C. at 29, 431 S.E.2d at 594.  The Simpkins court found neither sections 5-23-40 and 5-23-50, which grant municipal\r\n    corporations the authority to provide for the manner in which zoning regulations\r\n    are established and amended, nor any other statute supplies authority for a\r\n    municipal corporation to suspend an ordinance by merely passing a motion\r\n    creating a moratorium.  Id.  The court noted our supreme court has held\r\n    municipal ordinances cannot ordinarily be amended or repealed by a mere\r\n    resolution, and instead, a new ordinance must be passed.  Id.  Here,\r\n    unlike in Simpkins, the County Council enacted a new ordinance to modify\r\n    and amend the 1994 Plan, and did not merely pass a motion that called for a\r\n    moratorium.   \r\n  Finally, the effect of the majority decision permits\r\n    an agency of this state to ignore legislation adopted and duly passed by\r\n    representatives of the people of a local government.  The emergency ordinance was\r\n    neither a consistency determination nor a motion, but was an ordinance duly\r\n    adopted by the required super majority vote of the County Council\r\n    members present pursuant to section 4-9-130 of the South Carolina Code of Laws\r\n    (1986).  If there was concern about the legality or constitutionality of the\r\n    legislation, then a challenge, including injunctive relief, should have been\r\n    instituted in circuit court.  The County\r\n    Council complied with the long legal process to adopt a new solid waste management\r\n    plan.  It was only after the County was at the precipice of this process that\r\n    the emergency ordinance was adopted, not as a consistency determination, but to\r\n    preserve the status quo while the new plan was completed.  Indeed, DHEC took no\r\n    action for three weeks after its adoption and then decided to suspend the\r\n    permitting process for another three weeks.  Six weeks was more than enough\r\n    time to seek temporary and immediate injunctive relief from a judicial body if\r\n    there was a question about the effect and validity of the duly adopted\r\n    legislation.  Instead, on the virtual eve of third reading and with time\r\n    running out before the effective date of the new solid waste management plan,\r\n    DHEC chose to issue the permit just ahead of the pending legislation.  \r\n  Even assuming my colleagues are correct, in hindsight,\r\n    that &quot;DHEC properly disregarded the emergency ordinance,&quot; are we to\r\n    permit an agency of the executive branch of government to just disregard such\r\n    laws of a legislative body on its own determination prior to any judicial\r\n    review?  If agencies are permitted to\r\n    unilaterally decide to ignore county legislation prior to judicial review can\r\n    they also do so for state legislation they deem improperly passed?  Just to say\r\n    that the emergency ordinance was reviewed by this court and eventually found to\r\n    be improper overlooks the effect had no appeal been taken from the ALC\r\n    determination.  There are many small municipalities in South Carolina that are\r\n    too financially strained to challenge big state agencies wielding executive,\r\n    legislative, and judicial power.    \r\n  Accordingly, I would find the ALC erred in determining\r\n    the emergency ordinance was inconsistent with the Solid Waste Act.  I would reverse\r\n    the ALC's determination that the proposed landfill was consistent with the\r\n    County's solid waste management plan and revoke C&amp;D's permit for the\r\n    proposed landfill.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4941","title":"State v.

Rogers, Jr.,\r\n          of Bennettsville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Bentley\r\n  Collins was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and three counts of owning a\r\n  dangerous animal after his dogs killed a ten-year-old boy.  Collins appeals the\r\n  convictions claiming the trial court erred by (1) admitting seven autopsy photographs\r\n  of the boy's partially eaten body and (2) denying his directed verdict motions\r\n  as to both crimes.  Because we find the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  admitting the photos, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts\r\nAt around 7:00 p.m. on\r\n  November 3, 2006, the boy's mother returned from a trip to find her son had not\r\n  come home for dinner.  After looking for him at neighbors' houses, she called\r\n  the sheriff's department.  The responding officers searched the neighborhood with\r\n  her.  They found the boy's body in Collins' yard surrounded by at least three dogs.[1]  The boy's mother later testified &quot;he was torn to pieces.  Pieces.&quot; \r\nCollins was indicted for\r\n  involuntary manslaughter and three counts of owning a dangerous animal under\r\n  the Regulation of Dangerous Animals Act.  S.C. Code Ann. §§ 47-3-710 to -770 (Supp.\r\n  2011).  After a jury convicted him of all charges, the trial court sentenced\r\n  him to five years in prison, followed by five years of probation.[2]\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Admissibility of the Photographs\r\nThe State offered into\r\n  evidence ten photos of the boy's body.  The photos were taken by a forensic pathologist\r\n  before he performed an autopsy.  Collins objected to the admission of the\r\n  photos under Rule 403, SCRE, arguing that the danger of unfair prejudice\r\n  substantially outweighed their probative value.  After a hearing outside of the\r\n  jury's presence, the trial court admitted seven of the photos.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard of Review\r\n&quot;The admission of evidence is within the circuit\r\n  court's discretion and will not be reversed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot;  State v. Dickerson, 395 S.C. 101, 116, 716 S.E.2d 895, 903&nbsp;(2011). \r\n  A trial court has particularly wide discretion in ruling on Rule 403 objections.  See State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003) (&quot;A trial judge's decision regarding the comparative probative\r\n  value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional\r\n  circumstances.  We . . . are obligated to give great deference to the trial\r\n  court's judgment [regarding Rule 403].&quot; (internal citation omitted)).  We\r\n  nevertheless hold that in this case the trial court abused its discretion.  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probative Value\r\nRule 403 provides that,\r\n  &quot;[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.&quot;  &quot;Probative&quot;\r\n  means &quot;[t]ending to prove or disprove.&quot;  Black's Law Dictionary 1323 (9th ed. 2009).  Probative value is the measure of the importance of that\r\n  tendency to the outcome of a case.  It is the weight that a piece of relevant\r\n  evidence will carry in helping the trier of fact decide the issues. \r\n  &quot;[T]he more essential the evidence, the greater its probative\r\n  value.&quot;  United States v. Stout, 509 F.3d 796, 804 (6th Cir. 2007)\r\n  (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, a court analyzing probative value\r\n  considers the importance of the evidence and the significance of the issues to\r\n  which the evidence relates.  As our supreme court stated in State v. Torres,\r\n  390 S.C. 618, 703 S.E.2d 226 (2010), &quot;[p]hotographs calculated to arouse\r\n  the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are . . . not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.&quot;  390 S.C. at 623,\r\n  703 S.E.2d at 228 (emphasis added).  The evaluation of probative value cannot\r\n  be made in the abstract, but should be made in the practical context of the\r\n  issues at stake in the trial of each case.  See State v. Lyles,\r\n  379 S.C. 328, 338, 665 S.E.2d 201, 206 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;When [balancing\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice] against the probative value, the determination\r\n  must be based on the entire record and will turn on the facts of each\r\n  case.&quot; (citing State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872,\r\n  876 (2007))).   \r\nUnderstanding the\r\n  practical context of the trial of this case begins with the elements of the\r\n  crimes charged.  A person is guilty of owning a dangerous animal when the State\r\n  proves (1) he owned or had custody or control of an animal; (2) he knew or\r\n  reasonably should have known the animal had a propensity, tendency, or\r\n  disposition to attack unprovoked, cause injury, or otherwise endanger the\r\n  safety of human beings; (3) the animal made an unprovoked attack; (4) the\r\n  attack caused bodily injury to a human being; and (5) the attack occurred while\r\n  the animal was unconfined on the owner's premises.  S.C. Code Ann. §§\r\n  47-3-710(A)(1)-(2)(a), (D); -720; -760(B) (Supp. 2011).  \r\nTo convict a defendant of\r\n  involuntary manslaughter, the State must prove one of the following: &quot;(1)\r\n  the unintentional killing of another without malice, but while engaged in an\r\n  unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or\r\n  (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful\r\n  activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others.&quot;  State v.\r\n  Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51-52, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).  \r\nOn the dangerous animal\r\n  charges in this case, the trial focused almost exclusively on issues relating\r\n  to the second and third elements.  Importantly, the fourth element—that the\r\n  dogs' attack caused bodily injury to a human being—was never in dispute.  In\r\n  the hearing regarding admissibility of the photos, the State argued they would\r\n  be important for the testimony of both the pathologist and the dog behavior\r\n  expert.  The State then explained how the photos were important, arguing only\r\n  that they were probative of the third element.  The State did not argue the\r\n  photos were probative of any other element of the dangerous animal charges or\r\n  any element of involuntary manslaughter.  \r\nThe State thus argued the\r\n  probative value of the photos was primarily to establish that the dogs' attack\r\n  on the boy was unprovoked.  The State's theory on this point was that Collins underfed\r\n  the dogs, and because the dogs were hungry, they became aggressive and attacked\r\n  the boy for food.  On appeal, the State makes two specific arguments as to how\r\n  the photos support its theory: the pathologist needed the photos to explain\r\n  that the dogs ate the boy, and the photos corroborate the testimony of its dog\r\n  behavior expert.  \r\nAs to the State's first argument,\r\n  the photos do show that the dogs ate a significant portion of the boy's flesh. \r\n  Prior to the introduction of the photos, however, the State presented convincing\r\n  testimony to prove the same thing.  The pathologist testified:\r\n\r\n  There\r\n    were extensive traumatic injuries consisting of loss of skin and soft tissue in\r\n    a tearing fashion about the face, the ears, the eyes, the neck, the chest. \r\n    There was loss of skin and soft tissue with exposure of the bones of both\r\n    shoulders.  Essentially, the humeral bone in the upper arm, both right and left,\r\n    was exposed from the shoulder to the elbow.  \r\n\r\nThe State also put the\r\n  autopsy report into evidence prior to the photos.  The pathologist testified to\r\n  the contents of the report as follows:\r\n\r\n  I\r\n    described it as extensive traumatic injury, loss of skin to the face to include\r\n    the nose, the ears and all soft tissues around the lips with exposure of the\r\n    mandible, which is the lower jaw, teeth, and the underlying bony part of the\r\n    skull. . . . The ears and nose were completely eaten away.\r\n\r\nThe State asked the\r\n  pathologist what led him to conclude the ears and nose were &quot;eaten\r\n  away.&quot;  He responded: &quot;There was a virtual complete absence of the\r\n  ear structures on the right side and just remnants, shredded remnants of skin\r\n  and what were probably portions of the ear on the left.  They were essentially\r\n  gone.&quot;  Finally, the pathologist said he normally does not take photos of\r\n  an autopsy, but did so in this case because &quot;[t]his autopsy showed\r\n  tremendous traumatic injury to this young man.  This degree of injury was [as]\r\n  significant [a] traumatic injury as I've seen.  I've never seen an attack by animals\r\n  of this type . . . .&quot;  Thus, before the photos were admitted, the\r\n  pathologist's testimony conclusively established that the dogs ate the boy.  The\r\n  photos add very little to the jury's ability to understand the pathologist's\r\n  testimony on this point.      \r\nThe State's second\r\n  argument relates to its dog behavior expert, who testified the dogs attacked\r\n  the boy out of hunger, not provocation.  The expert used photographs of the\r\n  dogs to describe physical features that showed they were malnourished.  The\r\n  officers who responded to the scene testified there were no visible food bowls\r\n  for the dogs.  Based on this evidence, the dog behavior expert gave an opinion\r\n  that the dogs attacked the boy because they were hungry.[3]\r\nThe State argues the\r\n  photos corroborate the dog behavior expert's testimony and thus tend to prove the\r\n  attack was unprovoked.  However, the photos relate to the expert's opinion only\r\n  to the extent they show the same fact testified to by the pathologist, that the\r\n  dogs ate the boy.  As discussed above, the photos add little to the\r\n  pathologist's testimony.  Moreover, the expert hardly mentioned the photos of\r\n  the boy.  The assistant solicitor asked this expert only one question regarding\r\n  the photos: &quot;Could you tell the jury what you found significant in\r\n  reviewing those particular photos . . . as it relates to the level of\r\n  aggression with the dogs[?]&quot;  The witness's response to the question did\r\n  not relate the photos to his opinion or to how he arrived at it.  Rather, the\r\n  response highlights the unfair prejudice in the photos.\r\n\r\n  Based\r\n    on – in ten years going back on reports that I've noted on dog bites and dog\r\n    attacks and deaths caused by dogs this is the worst case I've ever seen.  I\r\n    worked for the sheriff's office for over a decade, and I have never seen\r\n    something so gruesome.  \r\n\r\nThe photos add little to\r\n  the jury's ability to understand the dog behavior expert's testimony.\r\nFinally, we address the\r\n  trial court's statement that the photos are probative of the cause of the boy's\r\n  death.  In explaining his ruling to admit the photos, the trial court stated\r\n  &quot;we've got to keep in mind . . . involuntary manslaughter, which involves\r\n  cause of death.&quot;  We find the photos add very little to the pathologist's\r\n  ability to explain or the jury's ability to understand the cause of death.  The\r\n  pathologist testified the boy &quot;died as a result of extensive traumatic\r\n  injury secondary to being mauled by dogs.&quot;  In particular, the pathologist\r\n  testified the dogs &quot;lacerated, basically transected the jugular vein on\r\n  the left side.&quot;  When the pathologist discussed the photos, however, he\r\n  had already completed his explanation of the cause of death.  The only mention\r\n  the pathologist made of the cause of death during his discussion of the photos\r\n  was his description of one of the photos as &quot;an enlarged view showing the\r\n  degree of injury to the left neck of this young man.&quot;  As to that photo,\r\n  he stated that the torn jugular vein was &quot;very hard to see in this\r\n  picture.&quot;  Other than to discount the importance of the photos with this\r\n  statement, the pathologist did not use any of them to explain the cause of\r\n  death. \r\nWe agree that the photos\r\n  have some probative value in helping the jury understand each of the three\r\n  points argued by the State: (1) the pathologist's testimony that the dogs ate\r\n  the boy, (2) the dog behavior expert's opinion that the dogs' attack on the boy\r\n  was unprovoked, and (3) the pathologist's testimony that the dogs' attack in\r\n  general and the torn jugular vein in particular caused the boy's death.  However,\r\n  the photos add little to the testimony of the witnesses on these three points. \r\n  Referring to the supreme court's statement in Torres that &quot;[p]hotographs\r\n  calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded\r\n  if they are . . . not necessary to substantiate material facts,&quot; the\r\n  photos in this case are hardly &quot;necessary.&quot;  390 S.C. at 623, 703\r\n  S.E.2d at 228.\r\nMore importantly, the\r\n  issues the State argues the photos relate to are hardly &quot;material.&quot;  The\r\n  three points argued by the State relate to the conduct of the dogs.  As to the\r\n  elements of the crimes, the focus of the trial should have been on Collins'\r\n  conduct and whether his conduct was criminal in nature.  The conduct of\r\n  the dogs is important, but only to the extent the dogs' conduct shows Collins'\r\n  conduct.  The photos are far removed from Collins' conduct, and even farther\r\n  removed from whether Collins' conduct was criminal.  The photos show the boy's\r\n  body after the dogs attacked and killed him.  The condition of the boy's body\r\n  circumstantially shows the conduct of the dogs on the day of the attack—they\r\n  ate the boy.  From the conduct of eating the boy, the State argues the jury\r\n  should infer the dogs were hungry, from which in turn the State argues the jury\r\n  should infer that Collins starved them.  At this point in the chain of\r\n  inferences that the State asks the jury to draw from these photos, Collins has\r\n  not violated the Dangerous Animals Act.  At least two more steps are required. \r\n  From the fact that he starved the dogs, the State argues Collins must have done\r\n  so knowingly, and from this he reasonably should have known the dogs &quot;had\r\n  a propensity, tendency, or disposition to make an unprovoked attack&quot; on a\r\n  child to get food.  In the practical context of the issues at stake in the\r\n  trial of this case, these photos are of little significance.\r\nFor these reasons, we\r\n  find the probative value of the photos is minimal.\r\nC. The Danger of Unfair Prejudice\r\nThe probative value of\r\n  the photos must be balanced against &quot;the danger of unfair prejudice.&quot; \r\n  Prejudice that is &quot;unfair&quot; is distinguished from the legitimate impact\r\n  all evidence has on the outcome of a case.  &quot;'Unfair prejudice does not\r\n  mean the damage to a defendant's case that results from the legitimate\r\n  probative force of the evidence; rather it refers to evidence which tends to\r\n  suggest decision on an improper basis.'&quot;  State v. Gilchrist, 329\r\n  S.C. 621, 630, 496 S.E.2d 424, 429&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998) (quoting United\r\n  States v. Bonds, 12 F.3d 540, 567 (6th Cir. 1993)).  &quot;All\r\n  evidence is meant to be prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice which\r\n  must be [scrutinized under Rule 403].&quot;  Id.&nbsp;(quoting United\r\n  States v. Rodriguez–Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir. 1989)); see\r\n  also United States v. Mohr, 318 F.3d 613, 619-20 (4th Cir. 2003)\r\n  (&quot;Rule 403 only requires suppression of evidence that results in unfair\r\n  prejudice—prejudice that damages an opponent for reasons other than its probative\r\n  value, for instance, an appeal to emotion . . . .&quot;).  \r\nPhotographs pose a danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice when they have &quot;an undue tendency to suggest a decision\r\n  on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional\r\n  one.&quot;  State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 290, 676 S.E.2d 690, 697\r\n  (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This definition of unfair prejudice\r\n  was taken originally from the Advisory Committee Notes to the formerly\r\n  identical federal rule 403.[4]  See State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149\r\n  (1991) (adopting the definition of unfair prejudice recited in the Notes of the\r\n  Federal Rules Advisory Committee).  Regarding this definition, the Supreme\r\n  Court of the United States stated: &quot;The term 'unfair prejudice,' as to a\r\n  criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence\r\n  to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof\r\n  specific to the offense charged.&quot;  Old Chief v. United States, 519\r\n  U.S. 172, 180 (1997).  Like probative value, unfair prejudice should be\r\n  evaluated in the practical context of the issues at stake in the trial of the\r\n  case.  See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 830\r\n  (2001) (&quot;The determination of prejudice must be based on the entire record\r\n  and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.&quot;).    \r\nThe seven photos admitted\r\n  are graphic and shocking.  They depict a ten-year-old boy's body on an autopsy\r\n  table after being partially eaten by dogs.  The photos are in color.  One photo\r\n  provides an encompassing view of what remains of the boy's upper body.  Three\r\n  close-up photos show the remains of his face.  The exposed skull and jaw bone\r\n  are plainly visible in these photos.  Two of these close-ups also show the\r\n  exposed arm, shoulder, and rib bones, where the flesh was eaten away from the\r\n  middle of his chest, across his shoulder and down to his elbow, on both sides. \r\n  One photo shows the left side of the boy's face from the back, again with the\r\n  exposed jaw bone visible.  The remaining two photos are of the body from the\r\n  waist down, showing his blood-stained shorts and the bite marks on his legs. \r\n  The pathologist described what the photos show, but seeing the photos draws an\r\n  intense emotional response and a level of sympathy for the dead child that does\r\n  not come from the testimony.  It is difficult to look at each photo, and the combined\r\n  effect of all seven is disturbing.  The photos that show what remains of the\r\n  child's face are chilling.  The danger of unfair prejudice of the admitted\r\n  photos is extreme.\r\nD.&nbsp; Balancing Probative Value and Unfair Prejudice\r\nWe have noted that a\r\n  trial court has particularly wide discretion in ruling on Rule 403 objections.  Adams, 354 S.C. at 378, 580 S.E.2d at 794.  In this case, however, we\r\n  find the danger of unfair prejudice in these photographs substantially\r\n  outweighs their probative value, and the trial court abused its discretion in ruling\r\n  otherwise.  \r\nOur analysis depends\r\n  heavily on the capacity of these photos to draw the jury's attention away from\r\n  the elements of the crimes charged, which are framed to focus the jury\r\n  primarily on the conduct of the defendant.  Seeing the photos of the child's\r\n  partially eaten body lying on the autopsy table prompts an intense emotional\r\n  response.  The photos evoke sympathy for the boy and also for his mother for\r\n  what she must have endured when she saw her son in this condition in Collins'\r\n  yard.  Consequently, the photos have precisely the effect contemplated by the\r\n  definition of unfair prejudice: &quot;an undue tendency to suggest a decision\r\n  on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional\r\n  one.&quot;  Holder, 382 S.C. at 290, 676 S.E.2d at 697 (internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).  As stated in Old Chief, the photos &quot;lure\r\n  the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific\r\n  to the offense charged.&quot;  In Old Chief, the improper ground for\r\n  declaring guilt was the defendant's propensity to commit crimes.  519 U.S. at\r\n  180-81.  Other courts have identified additional improper grounds, such as when\r\n  the evidence &quot;appeals to the jury's sympathies [or] arouses its sense of\r\n  horror.&quot; &nbsp;United States v. Thompson,&nbsp;359 F.3d 470,\r\n  479&nbsp;(7th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \r\nThese gruesome photos\r\n  have an overwhelming capacity to lure the jury into declaring guilt on the emotional\r\n  basis of sympathy for the boy and his mother and horror at the sight of the boy's\r\n  body.  This is the unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the probative\r\n  value of the photos.  We recognize that the photos add a visual element not\r\n  present in the testimony of the witnesses.  However, this visual element does far\r\n  more to create a danger of unfair prejudice than it does to add probative value. \r\n  These photos are beyond &quot;the outer limits of what our law permits a jury\r\n  to consider.&quot;  See Torres, 390 S.C. at 624, 703 S.E.2d at\r\n  229.  For this reason, we find the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  admitting the photos.[5]\r\nE.&nbsp; The Probative Value of Corroboration\r\nThe State argues,\r\n  however, that the photos corroborate the testimony of the pathologist and the\r\n  dog behavior expert, and thus have sufficiently high probative value that it is\r\n  not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  The State is\r\n  correct that the extent to which an autopsy photograph corroborates other\r\n  evidence or testimony increases its probative value.  However, the probative\r\n  value from a photograph's tendency to corroborate will vary depending on the\r\n  facts of an individual case.  In some cases, photographs that corroborate\r\n  important testimony on issues significant to the case may have very high\r\n  probative value.  As we have already explained, however, the photos in this\r\n  case have minimal probative value, even considering the limited extent to which\r\n  they corroborate the testimony of the witnesses.  \r\nThis conclusion is\r\n  supported by our opinion in State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 564 S.E.2d\r\n  362 (Ct. App. 2002).  In Jarrell, we stated: &quot;A test to determine\r\n  whether the trial court abused its discretion is whether the photographic\r\n  evidence serves to corroborate the testimony of witnesses offered at trial.  'If\r\n  the photograph serves to corroborate testimony, it is not [an] abuse of\r\n  discretion to admit it.'&quot;  350 S.C. at 106, 564 S.E.2d at 371 (quoting State\r\n  v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 597, 518 S.E.2d 588, 590 (1999)).  As our\r\n  opinion in Jarrell indicates, however, the photographs admitted in that\r\n  case corroborated important testimony on significant issues to such an extent\r\n  that their probative value was very high.  \r\nJarrell was charged with\r\n  homicide by child abuse, accessory before and after murder, criminal sexual\r\n  conduct, and unlawful conduct towards a child.  350 S.C. at 95, 564 S.E.2d at\r\n  365.  Like the photos in this case, the photographs admitted in Jarrell showed the extent of the child's injuries.  Unlike this case, however, the\r\n  child's injuries in Jarrell were essential to the State's ability to\r\n  prove the crimes of homicide by child abuse, criminal sexual conduct, and\r\n  unlawful conduct towards a child.  This is because the elements of those crimes\r\n  require the jury to focus on the effect the defendant's conduct had on the\r\n  child.  Thus, we placed importance on the fact that the Jarrell photographs &quot;corroborated the testimony about the condition of the child.&quot; \r\n  350 S.C. at 106, 564 S.E.2d at 371.  Further, the time of the child's death was\r\n  an important issue in Jarrell.  The fact that the baby had been dead\r\n  long enough for rigor mortis to set in and decomposition to begin, as shown by\r\n  the photographs, &quot;corroborated the pathologist's testimony about the time\r\n  of death&quot; and &quot;support[ed] the charge against Jarrell of accessory\r\n  after the fact.&quot;  Id.  \r\nMost importantly, the Jarrell photographs corroborated testimony supporting the State's theory of motive. \r\n  Jarrell discussed the abuse and death of the child with inmates while she was\r\n  in jail awaiting trial.  &quot;She . . . stated that she and Father planned to\r\n  kill the baby . . . because the baby had an upcoming doctor's appointment and\r\n  the abuse would be readily apparent to anyone examining the baby.&quot;  350\r\n  S.C. at 96, 564 S.E.2d at 366.  We explained the significance of the photos to\r\n  Jarrell's motive as follows:  \r\n\r\n  We\r\n    agree that the photographs were necessary to corroborate the testimony\r\n    presented at trial. A photograph displaying the anal injuries due to the sexual\r\n    abuse corroborated both the pathologist's testimony regarding the extent of\r\n    those injuries and the witnesses' testimony that Jarrell's motive for planning\r\n    to kill the baby was because the sexual abuse was readily apparent.\r\n\r\n350\r\n  S.C. at 106, 564 S.E.2d at 371.\r\nThe supreme court has\r\n  also placed importance on the fact that autopsy photographs corroborate the\r\n  testimony of witnesses.  In Holder, the court stated: &quot;'If the\r\n  offered photograph serves to corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of\r\n  discretion to admit it.'&quot;  382 S.C. at 290, 676 S.E.2d at 697&nbsp;(quoting State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 508, 466 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1996)).  Holder was also a homicide by child abuse case.  Thus, as in Jarrell, the\r\n  injuries to the child were critical to the State's ability to prove the\r\n  elements of the crime.  The supreme court explained: &quot;The photographs\r\n  corroborated the pathologist's testimony about the extensive bruising\r\n  on the child, which was in various stages of healing, and showed that even\r\n  internal organs manifest signs of bruising.  This is particularly helpful to\r\n  jurors who are unversed in medical matters.&quot;  382 S.C. at 290-91, 676\r\n  S.E.2d at 697.  The photos also corroborated the pathologist's testimony\r\n  refuting Holder's testimony.  \r\n\r\n  Although\r\n    Holder testified she was unaware of any marks on her son prior to his death and\r\n    thought he was suffering from simple food poisoning, it is abundantly clear\r\n    from the extensive bruising on the child, which was in various stages of\r\n    healing, and the torn internal organs, that he had been seriously injured.\r\n    These photographs demonstrate that the damage to the child would have been\r\n    difficult to ignore.\r\n\r\n382 S.C. at 291, 676\r\n  S.E.2d at 697.  \r\nBecause the photographs\r\n  in Jarrell and Holder strongly corroborated important testimony\r\n  on significant issues, the photographs were found to have very high probative\r\n  value.  The supreme court explained this in Holder: &quot;We find the\r\n  photographs clearly demonstrate the extent and nature of the injuries in a way\r\n  that would not be as easily understood based on the testimony alone.&quot;  382\r\n  S.C. at 290, 676 S.E.2d at 697.  \r\nDepending on the facts of\r\n  a specific case, there may be other ways in which evidence challenged under\r\n  Rule 403 corroborates evidence.  See Black's Law Dictionary 636\r\n  (9th ed. 2009) (&quot;[C]orroborating evidence&quot; is &quot;[e]vidence that\r\n  differs from but strengthens or confirms what other evidence shows (esp. that\r\n  which needs support).&quot;).  Trial courts should consider the corroborating\r\n  effect of evidence when analyzing its probative value.  However, the limited\r\n  extent to which these photos corroborate the testimony of the witnesses does\r\n  not significantly increase the minimal probative value of the photos.  A\r\n  photograph of the partially eaten body of a child is not necessary to\r\n  demonstrate that the dogs killed the boy and ate a significant portion of his\r\n  flesh.  These facts are readily understood based on the pathologist's testimony\r\n  alone.  Thus, we disagree with the State that these photos sufficiently\r\n  corroborate the testimony of the pathologist or the dog behavior expert such\r\n  that the probative value of the photos is not substantially outweighed by the\r\n  extreme danger of unfair prejudice. \r\nF.&nbsp; Deference to the Trial Court's Analysis\r\nThe State also argues the\r\n  trial court's exclusion of several photographs indicates it did exercise\r\n  discretion, and we should not disturb that exercise.  The State correctly points\r\n  out that both the supreme court and this court have deferred to the judgment of\r\n  the trial court when the record reveals the trial court actually exercised its\r\n  discretion.  See, e.g., Jarrell, 350 S.C. at 106, 564 S.E.2d at\r\n  371 (&quot;Significantly, the trial court did not admit all the photographs,\r\n  giving the State a choice between two photographs depicting the same injury. .\r\n  . . [T]he trial court's exclusion of photographs demonstrates it exercised its\r\n  discretion.&quot;); see also Torres, 390 S.C. at 624, 703\r\n  S.E.2d at 229 (&quot;[T]he trial judge did exercise his discretion by excluding\r\n  three of the State's photographs, ruling that they were duplicative and\r\n  prejudicial.&quot;).\r\nThe record in this case,\r\n  however, shows that the trial court did not independently analyze the probative\r\n  value of the photos.  Therefore, the trial court did not properly exercise its\r\n  discretion.  See State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 86, 538 S.E.2d\r\n  257, 267&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;The failure to exercise discretion, however, is\r\n  itself an abuse of discretion.&quot;). \r\n  The State called the pathologist to testify during the admissibility hearing. \r\n  The court began its examination of the pathologist by telling him the State\r\n  wanted to admit the photos at issue because they were &quot;necessary for you\r\n  to explain your findings.&quot;  The court then asked the pathologist to &quot;confirm&quot;\r\n  whether or not he &quot;need[ed]&quot; each photo.  The pathologist answered\r\n  the question in conclusory fashion: &quot;Your honor, these would certainly\r\n  enable me to describe the degree of injury and show the extent of it. . . .\r\n  [T]hese I think would be very beneficial to explain exactly what happened to\r\n  this young man.&quot;  The court then asked the pathologist: &quot;Are there\r\n  some in there that we could pull out that are merely repetitious?&quot;  The\r\n  pathologist identified three photos, which were not admitted.  The court then\r\n  stated:\r\nOkay,\r\n  based on [the pathologist's] testimony [that] he needs it in his scientific\r\n  explanation I'm allowing those in . . . . \r\nAfter counsel for Collins\r\n  and the State questioned the pathologist, the trial court ruled:\r\n\r\n  It\r\n    is an unusual case, however, we've got to keep in mind that we've got\r\n    involuntary manslaughter which involves death, cause of death.  You've got [the\r\n    pathologist] here who is one of the best, and he's informed the Court that he\r\n    needs it.  All right.  I'm standing by what I've done.  I'm overruling the\r\n    objections . . . . \r\n\r\nWithout evaluating the\r\n  probative value of the photos, the trial court was unable to balance that\r\n  probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice, as required by Rule\r\n  403.  The trial court's failure to independently make that evaluation is\r\n  particularly significant in this case because, as we discussed earlier, the\r\n  pathologist's explanation of the importance of the photos does not withstand\r\n  scrutiny.  Moreover, while the pathologist is fully capable of understanding\r\n  the importance of the photos to medical considerations such as cause of death,\r\n  the pathologist is not the person charged with the responsibility of relating\r\n  that importance to the legal issues in the case.  The trial court is charged\r\n  with that responsibility.  \r\nThe danger of unfair\r\n  prejudice is so high that it required little analysis.  The probative value, on\r\n  the other hand, required careful analysis.  In Jarrell and Torres the appellate court deferred to the judgment of the trial court when it\r\n  admitted some autopsy photographs but excluded others.  The deference in those\r\n  cases, however, was not simply to the trial court's decision.  Rather, the\r\n  appellate court deferred to the trial court's analysis.  We do not defer to the\r\n  trial court's decision in this case because the record reflects it was not\r\n  based on the court's own analysis.  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nWe have considered\r\n  whether the admission of the photographs was harmless beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.  See State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 48, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492\r\n  (2004) (declining to reverse for error under Rule 403 because the error was\r\n  harmless).  In making the determination that the error was not harmless, we\r\n  have considered the fact that the other evidence of the condition of the\r\n  child's body also has potential to cause a similar emotional reaction we find constitutes\r\n  the unfair prejudice in these photographs.  Thus, we have evaluated whether the\r\n  additional emotional impact of the photographs over and above that caused by\r\n  other evidence in the case is such that the erroneous admission of the\r\n  photographs is harmless.  Given the intense emotional reaction caused by\r\n  viewing these photos, we cannot say that their admission into evidence was\r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's\r\n  decision to admit the photos and remand for a new trial.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nCollins argues the trial\r\n  court erred in denying his motions for directed verdict as to both crimes.  We\r\n  find evidence in the record to support each element of both crimes.  Therefore,\r\n  the trial court ruled correctly in denying Collins' motions for directed\r\n  verdict.  See State v. Phillips, 393 S.C. 407, 412, 712 S.E.2d\r\n  457, 459 (Ct. App. 2011) (&quot;An appellate court may reverse the trial court's denial of a directed verdict motion\r\n  only if no evidence supports the trial court's ruling.&quot;).\r\nAccordingly, the decision\r\n  of the trial court to admit the photos is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for a new trial.\r\nTHOMAS and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Collins was not home at the time of the incident or when the officers and the\r\n  boy's mother arrived. \r\n[2] The specific sentences were five years for involuntary manslaughter and three\r\n  years concurrent for two of the dangerous animal convictions.  On the third\r\n  dangerous animal conviction, the sentence was three years consecutive suspended\r\n  on five years' probation and the payment of $8,000 in restitution to the boy's\r\n  family for funeral expenses.\r\n[3] The dog behavior expert also testified the dog bites on the lower part of the\r\n  boy's body indicated &quot;the dogs had bitten the ten-year-old in the legs\r\n  taking him down first. . . . They would go for the legs first and take him down\r\n  which shows from the bites and the tissue loss.&quot; \r\n[4] Rule 403 and other federal rules of evidence were\r\n  amended on December 1, 2011, &quot;as\r\n  part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood\r\n  and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.&quot;  Rule\r\n  403, FRE, advisory committee's note.  The changes to Rule 403, FRE, are\r\n  &quot;stylistic only,&quot; with &quot;no intent to change any result in any\r\n  ruling on evidence admissibility.&quot;  Id.  \r\n[5] See Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 182-83 (&quot;If an alternative [is]\r\n  found to have substantially the same or greater probative value but a lower\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice, sound judicial discretion would discount the value\r\n  of the item first offered and exclude it if its discounted probative value were\r\n  substantially outweighed by unfairly prejudicial risk.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4942","title":"State v.

Coombs, and Solicitor Kevin Brackett, all of  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:  Jomar Antavis\r\n  Robinson (Robinson) was convicted of possession of crack cocaine with intent to\r\n  distribute, possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within\r\n  one-half mile of a public park, unlawful carrying of a pistol, possession of\r\n  marijuana, and resisting arrest.  The circuit court sentenced Robinson to life\r\n  imprisonment.  Robinson appeals, arguing the circuit court erred in (1) denying\r\n  Robinson's motion to suppress drugs found as a result of an illegal search and\r\n  seizure; and (2) allowing the State to qualify the Commander of the Drug\r\n  Enforcement Unit as an expert witness.  We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn March 20,\r\n  2010, Sergeant Rayford Louis Ervin, Jr. (Ervin) with the York County Drug\r\n  Enforcement Unit (the Drug Enforcement Unit) conducted surveillance of the Hall\r\n  Street Apartments in response to numerous anonymous complaints of criminal\r\n  activity in the area.  Ervin stated he observed conduct consistent with drug\r\n  transactions and called for back-up.  Lieutenant James M. Ligon (Ligon) and\r\n  Officer Brian Schettler (Schettler) with the Drug Enforcement Unit responded. \r\n  Upon their arrival, Ervin informed the officers he observed an individual,\r\n  wearing a black leather jacket, meeting vehicles that pulled into the parking\r\n  lot, going up to the vehicles' windows for a short time, and then returning to\r\n  the porch of an apartment.  \r\nLigon and\r\n  Schettler approached the porch and smelled a strong odor of marijuana.  Of the\r\n  five individuals on the porch, two men were wearing black jackets matching\r\n  Ervin's description.  Ligon and Schettler asked the men for their\r\n  identification.  Ligon noticed one of the individuals, later identified as\r\n  Robinson, had a pistol hanging out of the right pocket of his jacket.  Ligon\r\n  told the two individuals he could smell marijuana and see Robinson's pistol,\r\n  and he was going to conduct a Terry[1] search.  As Robinson began to retreat, both Ligon and Robinson reached for\r\n  Robinson's pistol, and a fight between Ligon and Robinson ensued.  During the\r\n  struggle, Robinson's jacket fell to the ground and Robinson fled the\r\n  scene.  Ligon pursued him, and after an altercation, Ligon placed Robinson in\r\n  handcuffs.  Once Robinson was in custody, Schettler searched the inside of\r\n  Robinson's jacket and found the pistol, a bag containing marijuana, and a bag\r\n  containing crack cocaine.  \r\nA York County\r\n  grand jury indicted Robinson for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, possession\r\n  of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within one-half mile of a public\r\n  park,\r\n  unlawful carrying of a pistol, possession of marijuana, and resisting arrest.  \r\nRobinson moved\r\n  in limine to suppress the pistol, marijuana, and crack cocaine found in\r\n  Robinson's pocket, arguing the contents of his jacket were the result of an\r\n  illegal search.  The circuit court denied this motion finding the search did\r\n  not violate Robinson's Fourth Amendment rights; Robinson did not have an expectation\r\n  of privacy on the porch; and the officers had reasonable suspicion to\r\n  investigate.  When\r\n  the State introduced the pistol and crack cocaine into evidence during trial,\r\n  Robinson timely objected.  However, despite his motion in limine to suppress\r\n  the marijuana, Robinson offered the bag of marijuana into evidence during the\r\n  cross-examination of one of the State's witnesses as a trial strategy.[2]  \r\nThe State called\r\n  Commander Marvin Brown (Commander Brown) of the Drug Enforcement Unit as a\r\n  witness.  The State offered Commander Brown as an expert in &quot;how crack\r\n  cocaine is packaged, sold, the going price, the typical intoxicating dose, and\r\n  the different habits between the typical addict, the user, and the typical drug\r\n  dealer.&quot;  Robinson objected, arguing Commander Brown was not\r\n  qualified as an expert witness under Rule 702 of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence.  After voir dire of Commander Brown, the circuit court concluded he\r\n  was qualified to testify as an expert.  \r\nFollowing the\r\n  State's case-in-chief, Robinson moved for a directed verdict.  In addition,\r\n  Robinson renewed his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search,\r\n  but he specifically conceded the marijuana was admissible based on his\r\n  introduction of the marijuana during trial.  The court denied Robinson's\r\n  motions.  Robinson was convicted of all charges and was subsequently sentenced\r\n  to life imprisonment pursuant to section 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2010).[3] \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court reviews errors of law only.  State v. Butler,\r\n  353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003).  The appellate court is\r\n  bound by the circuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Motion\r\n  to Suppress \r\nRobinson argues the marijuana and\r\n  cocaine were improperly admitted at trial because they were obtained in an\r\n  unlawful manner.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marijuana\r\n  \r\n\r\nRobinson introduced\r\n  the marijuana into evidence during his cross-examination of Ligon; therefore,\r\n  he cannot now complain of its admission on appeal.  See State v.\r\n  Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 498, 381 S.E.2d 732, 733 (1989) (holding a defendant\r\n  who expressly consented to the admission of evidence at trial waived any right\r\n  to raise the issue of admissibility on appeal); State v. O'Neal, 210\r\n  S.C. 305, 312, 42 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1947) (holding a defendant may not complain\r\n  of admission of evidence when he introduced the same kind of evidence on cross-examination); State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n  (holding a defendant cannot complain about the admission of evidence on appeal\r\n  when he opened the door to the introduction of that evidence).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crack Cocaine\r\n  \r\n\r\nRobinson argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in admitting the crack cocaine at trial when (1) he had\r\n  a reasonable expectation of privacy on the porch; and (2) Ligon and Schettler\r\n  entered without a warrant and in the absence of exigent circumstances.  We\r\n  disagree and address each argument in turn.\r\n i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectation\r\n  of Privacy \r\nRobinson\r\n  contends the search was in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights because he\r\n  had an expectation of privacy on the porch.  We disagree. \r\nFor Robinson to\r\n  establish a Fourth Amendment violation, he must show a legitimate expectation\r\n  of privacy on the porch.  See State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 112,\r\n  603 S.E.2d 594, 596 (2004) (&quot;To claim protection under the Fourth\r\n  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, defendants must show that they have a\r\n  legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched.&quot;).  &quot;A\r\n  legitimate expectation of privacy is both subjective and objective in nature:\r\n  the defendant must show (1) he had a subjective expectation of not being\r\n  discovered, and (2) the expectation is one that society recognizes as\r\n  reasonable.&quot;  Id. (quoting Oliver v. U.S., 466 U.S. 170, 177\r\n  (1984)). \r\n&quot;A\r\n  reasonable expectation of privacy exists in property being searched when the\r\n  defendant has a relationship with the property or property owner.&quot;  State\r\n  v. Flowers, 360 S.C. 1, 5, 598 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ct. App. 2004).  While an\r\n  overnight guest may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the host's\r\n  property, &quot;a person present only intermittently or for a purely commercial\r\n  purpose does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.&quot;  Id.\r\nHere, the\r\n  circuit court found Robinson did not have the same expectation of privacy as he\r\n  would have in his own home.  Robinson did not live in the apartment connected\r\n  to the porch or any apartment located in the Hall Street Apartment complex. \r\n  Furthermore, there is no evidence he was an overnight guest or otherwise had a\r\n  connection to the premises or apartment lessee to give him a reasonable\r\n  expectation of privacy.  Robinson failed to establish he had an expectation of\r\n  not being discovered on the porch, nor did he ask the police to leave.  See In the Matter of Brazen, 275 S.C. 436, 436, 272 S.E.2d 178, 178 (1980)\r\n  (finding the defendant did not have a subjective expectation of privacy in an\r\n  open garage when he had an opportunity to demonstrate an expectation of privacy\r\n  or ask the police to leave, but instead did nothing).  Therefore, Robinson\r\n  failed to show he had a reasonable expectation of privacy on the porch. \r\n ii.&nbsp; Reasonable\r\n  Suspicion \r\nRobinson also\r\n  argues Ligon and Schettler violated his Fourth Amendment rights because they\r\n  entered the porch without a warrant and in the absence of exigent\r\n  circumstances.  We disagree.  \r\n&quot;A police\r\n  officer may stop and briefly detain and question a person for investigative\r\n  purposes, without treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when the officer has\r\n  a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of probable cause\r\n  for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal activity.&quot;  State\r\n  v. Taylor, 388 S.C. 101, 109, 694 S.E.2d 60, 64 (Ct. App. 2010) (quoting State\r\n  v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 248, 525 S.E.2d 535, 539 (Ct. App. 1999)).\r\n  &quot;'Reasonable suspicion' requires a 'particularized and objective basis\r\n  that would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.'&quot;  State\r\n  v. Khingratsaiphon,&nbsp;352 S.C. 62, 69, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2002) (quoting U.S. v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981)).  In determining\r\n  whether reasonable suspicion exists, the totality of the circumstances should\r\n  be evaluated.  State v. Corley, 383 S.C. 232, 240, 679 S.E.2d 187,\r\n  191&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).  While anonymous tips do not supply the indicia of\r\n  reliability to establish reasonable suspicion, an &quot;anonymous tip can\r\n  provide the basis of an investigatory stop if the officer conducting the stop\r\n  verifies the tip's reliability by observing the suspect engaged in criminal\r\n  activity.&quot;  Taylor, 388 S.C. at 114, 694 S.E.2d at 66.  The\r\n  officer's experience and intuition is an additional factor to consider in\r\n  determining whether reasonable suspicion exists.    Id. at 116, 694\r\n  S.E.2d at 68. \r\nHere, the\r\n  circuit court held:\r\n\r\n  [T]aking\r\n    the totality of the circumstances, the officer's knowledge about the area, what\r\n    had been reasonably observed, that there were anonymous tips, the police\r\n    officers investigation and observing the area, . . . the drug transactions\r\n    [that] were going on in the parking lot based on an officer's knowledge of what\r\n    drug transactions look like in those situations, . . . they are going there\r\n    simply to determine the identification of the people who are there, . . .\r\n    heightened by the fact that they smelled the green marijuana, and heightened by\r\n    the fact that they saw a weapon hanging out of the defendant's pocket. So all\r\n    of that, taking the totality of the circumstances they would have reasonable\r\n    suspicion to investigate further and to pat down the defendant . . . .\r\n\r\nLigon and\r\n  Schettler testified to specific and articulable facts to show they had\r\n  reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. Based on Ervin's\r\n  observation of conduct consistent with drug transactions, Ligon and Schettler\r\n  approached the porch, and Ligon asked for Robinson's identification.  Ligon and\r\n  Schettler both testified this was a consensual encounter, and Robinson could\r\n  have terminated the encounter at any time.  See State v. Foster, 269 S.C. 373,\r\n  380, 237 S.E.2d 589, 592 (1977) (holding an officer's request to see\r\n  identification does not constitute a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth\r\n  Amendment).  The\r\n  fact that the officers smelled marijuana as they approached the porch reasonably\r\n  heightened their suspicion.  See State v. Banda, 371 S.C. 245,\r\n  253, 639 S.E.2d 36, 40 (2006) (holding the court recognizes there is an\r\n  &quot;indisputable nexus between drugs and guns&quot; to justify a frisk for\r\n  weapons when an officer has reasonable suspicion that drugs are present)\r\n  (internal citation omitted).  When Schettler saw the pistol hanging out of Robinson's\r\n  jacket pocket, he had reasonable suspicion to frisk Robinson for weapons.  We\r\n  find the police had reasonable suspicion to stop Robinson, and thus did not\r\n  violate his Fourth Amendment rights. \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  affirm the circuit court's denial of Robinson's motion to suppress the crack\r\n  cocaine. \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp;Expert\r\n  Witness Qualification\r\nRobinson next\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in qualifying Commander Brown as an expert\r\n  witness.  We disagree. \r\nA\r\n  person is competent as an expert when he or she has acquired knowledge, skill,\r\n  or experience so that he or she is better able than the jury to form an opinion\r\n  on the subject matter.  Rule 702, SCRE;  see also Gooding v. St.\r\n  Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997)\r\n  (&quot;To be competent to testify as an expert, 'a witness must have acquired\r\n  by reason of study or experience or both such knowledge and skill in a\r\n  profession or science that he is better qualified than the\r\n  jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of his testimony.'&quot;) (internal\r\n  citation omitted).  &quot;An expert is not limited to any class of persons acting\r\n  professionally.&quot;  Id. at 252, 487 S.E.2d at 598 (internal citation\r\n  omitted).  &quot;The party offering the expert has the burden of showing his\r\n  witness possesses the necessary learning, skill, or practical experience to\r\n  enable the witness to give opinion testimony.&quot;  State v.\r\n  Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 505, 435 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1993).  However, defects\r\n  in the amount or quality of education or experience go to the weight of the\r\n  expert's testimony and not its admissibility.  State v. Myers, 301 S.C.\r\n  251, 256, 391 S.E.2d 551, 554 (1990). \r\nRobinson\r\n  questioned Commander Brown regarding writings, publications, and experience in\r\n  the area of narcotics enforcement.  Commander Brown indicated he wrote an\r\n  article in a national magazine for the United States Attorney's Office detailing\r\n  how the Drug Enforcement Unit was organized.  He testified he teaches three\r\n  classes: search and seizure, asset forfeiture, and basic narcotics.  In\r\n  addition, Commander Brown makes an annual appearance as a guest instructor at a\r\n  commander's school for the United States Attorney's Office regarding drug\r\n  enforcement and drug trends.  Commander Brown testified he was the narcotics\r\n  supervisor for over twenty years.  Further, he stated he worked on the first\r\n  crack cocaine case in York County and has observed crack cocaine &quot;evolve\r\n  as to how it's packaged and sold throughout the years, especially . . . in York\r\n  County.&quot;  Moreover, Commander Brown stated he had been qualified more than\r\n  six times as an expert in previous state court criminal cases in &quot;how\r\n  cocaine is packaged, sold, the going price, the typical intoxicating dose.&quot; \r\n  Commander Brown also affirmed that he has been qualified as an expert in\r\n  federal court twice on the same subject matter.  \r\nWe find Commander\r\n  Brown's thirty years of experience in narcotics enforcement coupled with his\r\n  involvement in hundreds of crack cocaine cases sufficient to qualify him as an\r\n  expert on this topic.  See State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 273, 495\r\n  S.E.2d 463, 466&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;There is no abuse of discretion as\r\n  long as the witness has acquired by study or practical experience such\r\n  knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give\r\n  guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is\r\n  beyond the scope of the jury's good judgment and common knowledge.&quot;).  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  because the qualification of Commander Brown did not require the jury to give\r\n  his testimony any greater weight than that given to a lay witness, Robinson did\r\n  not suffer any prejudice from Commander Brown's expert qualification.  See State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499, 503, 671 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2009) (finding\r\n  a defendant was not prejudiced by the witness's expert qualification because\r\n  the fact that the witness was qualified as an expert did not require the jury\r\n  to accord her testimony any greater weight than that given to any other\r\n  witness); State v. White, 382 S.C. 265, 271, 676 S.E.2d 684, 687 (2009)\r\n  (finding the circuit court properly instructed the jury to give the expert\r\n  witness's testimony &quot;such weight and credibility as you deem appropriate\r\n  as you will with any and all witnesses that will testify at this trial&quot;); State\r\n  v. Commander, 384 S.C. 66, 75, 681 S.E.2d 31, 35 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;As\r\n  with any witness, the jury is free to accept or reject the testimony of an\r\n  expert witness.&quot;) (internal citation omitted). \r\nThe State\r\n  offered Commander Brown's testimony to advise the jury as to how crack cocaine\r\n  was sold and packaged, which is information not commonly known to the average\r\n  juror.  Further, this information would aid the jury in determining whether\r\n  Robinson intended to distribute the crack cocaine or only possessed the crack\r\n  cocaine for personal use.  Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in qualifying Commander Brown as an expert witness. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  circuit court's rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Terry v.\r\n  Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).\r\n[2] Robinson's\r\n  attorney affirmed at trial he introduced the marijuana into evidence\r\n  as a trial strategy. \r\n[3] Pursuant\r\n  to section 17-25-45, upon conviction of possession of crack \r\n  cocaine with\r\n  intent to distribute within one-half mile of a public park:\r\n\r\n  &quot;[A]\r\n    person must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life without the\r\n    possibility of parole if that person has two or more prior convictions for: (1)\r\n    a serious offense; (2) a most serious offense; (3) a federal or out-of-state\r\n    offense that would be classified as a serious offense or most serious offense\r\n    under this section; or (4) any combination of the offenses listed in (1), (2),\r\n    and (3) above.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4943","title":"Magnolia North POA v.

(HMNI), and BuildStar\r\n  Corporation (BuildStar) (collectively, Appellants), seek review of the jury's\r\n  verdict in this construction defect action.[1] \r\n  Appellants assign error to the trial court's:  (1) finding of an amalgamation\r\n  of Appellants' corporate interests, entities, and activities so as to blur the\r\n  legal distinction between the corporations and their activities; (2) admitting\r\n  evidence of construction defects at other HCI projects; (3) instructing the\r\n  jury regarding actual and punitive damages; (4) granting of a directed verdict\r\n  for Respondent Magnolia North Property Owners' Association, Inc.

Did\r\n    the trial court err in granting a directed verdict for the POA on its causes of\r\n    action for negligence and breach of the warranty of workmanlike services?\r\n  V.&nbsp; Did\r\n    the trial court err in denying Appellants' motions for a directed verdict and\r\n    JNOV?\r\n  VI.&nbsp; Did\r\n    the trial court err in upholding the jury's punitive damages award?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The standard of review\r\n  for an appeal of an action at law tried by a jury is restricted to corrections\r\n  of errors of law.&quot;  Felder v. K-Mart Corp., 297 S.C. 446, 448, 377\r\n  S.E.2d 332, 333 (1989).  A factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed\r\n  unless there is no evidence which reasonably supports the finding.  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amalgamation\r\nAppellants\r\n  maintain the trial court erred in ruling\r\n  that their entities were amalgamated because (1) a court cannot disregard the\r\n  corporate form when the requirements for &quot;piercing the corporate\r\n  veil&quot; have not been met, and (2) the concept of amalgamation does not\r\n  apply to the facts of this case.  We disagree.  \r\nIn Kincaid v. Landing Development\r\n  Corp., 289 S.C. 89, 91, 344 S.E.2d 869, 871 (Ct. App. 1986), three related\r\n  corporations (a development corporation, a management corporation, and a\r\n  construction corporation) were sued for negligent construction and breach of\r\n  warranty.  The management corporation argued the court should have directed a\r\n  verdict in its favor because it was merely the marketing and sales company.  Id. at 96, 344 S.E.2d at 874.  In addition to sharing owners, the three companies\r\n  shared a location.  Id.  Furthermore, the management company was the entity\r\n  called to remedy problems.&nbsp;  Id.&nbsp;  Finally, the company's\r\n  letterhead identified the management company as, &quot;A Development,\r\n  Construction, Sales, and Property Management Company.&quot;&nbsp;  Id.&nbsp;\r\n   This court affirmed the trial court's finding that the evidence revealed\r\n  &quot;an amalgamation of corporate interests, entities, and activities so as to\r\n  blur the legal distinction between the corporations and their\r\n  activities.&quot;&nbsp;  Id. (quoting the trial court); see Mid-South\r\n  Mgmt. Co. v. Sherwood Dev. Corp., 374 S.C. 588, 597-605, 649 S.E.2d 135,\r\n  140-44 (Ct. App. 2007) (discussing Kincaid as one of three theories\r\n  raised for holding a parent corporation liable in place of a subsidiary; i.e.:  (1)\r\n  piercing the corporate veil; (2) alter-ego or instrumentality theory; and (3)\r\n  the amalgamation of interests or blurred identity theory). &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHere, the trial court\r\n  concluded that the facts of the instant case closely paralleled the facts in Kincaid. \r\n  The trial court further concluded that the piercing of the corporate veil\r\n  analysis did not apply to this case.  The trial court stated: &quot;The\r\n  evidence has revealed an amalgamation of the corporate interest, the entities,\r\n  and activities so as to blur the legal distinction between the corporation[s]\r\n  and their activities.&quot;  \r\nThe evidence supports the\r\n  trial court's ruling.  Gwyn Hardister,\r\n  chief operating officer and president of HCI, testified HCI was the parent\r\n  corporation of HMNI and BuildStar.  The other officers of HCI were Roger Van\r\n  Wie and Jack Green.  Van Wie also oversaw BuildStar, the general contractor\r\n  supervising the construction at Magnolia North.  Separate corporations were\r\n  created for each HCI development for the purpose of operating as &quot;cost\r\n  centers,&quot; thereby containing each development's expenses and oversight as\r\n  it applied to property management and construction cost allocation.[4] \r\n  All of these corporations shared officers, directors, office space, and a phone\r\n  number with HCI.  HMNI, the corporation HCI created to operate as a cost center\r\n  for Magnolia North, created the POA; its officers were also officers for HCI. \r\n  HCI officers controlled the POA until September 9, 2002, when the unit owners were\r\n  given control of the POA.  \r\nHardister testified it could\r\n  be assumed that the employees of BuildStar were also the employees of HCI.  At\r\n  the first annual meeting of the POA, Van Wie acknowledged construction problems\r\n  and represented that the problems would be corrected.  Moreover, the warranty\r\n  manual distributed to the unit owners upon purchase was entitled:\r\n  &quot;Heritage Communities, Inc. Limited Warranty Manual,&quot; and it identified\r\n  HCI as the corporation extending the warranty.  \r\nTherefore, as in Kincaid,[5]  this case involves several indicia of an amalgamation of interests between\r\n  HCI, HMNI, and BuildStar.  The\r\n  corporations shared a location, telephone number, board members, officers, and\r\n  employees.  In its warranty, HCI held itself out to the homeowners as the\r\n  corporation responsible for construction defects.  In light of these indicia, the trial court's ruling\r\n  that Appellants' entities were amalgamated  is supported by the law and the\r\n  evidence.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Heritage Projects\r\nAppellants assert that this\r\n  court should order a new trial because the trial court allowed the POA to\r\n  repeatedly present evidence of\r\n  construction defects at other Heritage projects.  Appellants argue that the\r\n  admission of this evidence violated Rule 404 of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence as well as the limitation on admission of similar events evidence set\r\n  forth in Whaley v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 483, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 286, 300 (2005).  We disagree.\r\nRule 404(b), SCRE states:\r\n  &quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the\r\n  character of a person in order to show action in conformity\r\n  therewith.&quot;&nbsp;  Rule 404(b), SCRE.&nbsp;  In Whaley, our supreme\r\n  court recognized that similar acts are admissible if they tend to prove or\r\n  disprove some fact in dispute. &nbsp; See Branham v. Ford Motor Co.,\r\n  390 S.C. 203, 230, 701 S.E.2d 5, 19 (2010) (discussing Whaley).&nbsp;  Evidence\r\n  of similar acts has the potential to be exceedingly prejudicial.&nbsp;  Branham,\r\n  390 S.C. at 230, 701 S.E.2d at 19.&nbsp;  Accordingly, a plaintiff must present\r\n  facts showing the other acts were substantially similar to the event at\r\n  issue.&nbsp;  Whaley, 362 S.C. at 483, 609 S.E.2d at 300.&nbsp;  Further,\r\n  other acts may be admissible for the purpose of establishing the facts\r\n  necessary to prove entitlement to punitive damages.&nbsp;  Judy v. Judy,\r\n  384 S.C. 634, 642-43, 682 S.E.2d 836, 840-41 (Ct. App. 2009), aff'd on other\r\n  grounds, 393 S.C. 160, 712 S.E.2d 408 (2011) (affirming when the trial\r\n  court admitted evidence of a similar prior lawsuit).&nbsp;  The admission of\r\n  evidence is within the trial court's discretion, and the trial court's decision\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&nbsp;  Whaley,\r\n  362 S.C. at 483, 609 S.E.2d at 300 (applying the abuse of discretion standard\r\n  of review to the admissibility of evidence of similar accidents).\r\nIn the present case, Gwyn Hardister,\r\n  HCI's chief operating officer and president, testified that after his first\r\n  month of employment with HCI, it became apparent that Magnolia Place had issues\r\n  with water intrusion, including window leaks, and water issues on the decks and\r\n  breezeways, before construction had begun at Magnolia North.  Hardister\r\n  admitted that the construction defects were virtually identical across all\r\n  developments.  Other testimony setting forth the details of defects in projects\r\n  other than Magnolia North supports Hardister's admission.  Drew Brown, the\r\n  POA's expert in general contracting, estimating, and building diagnostics,\r\n  testified that he investigated other HCI projects that used the engineered wood\r\n  trim, just as Magnolia North did, and that the trim was inherently defective as\r\n  an exterior trim.  He also stated that, as with Magnolia North, there was\r\n  improper flashing and a lack of engineered sealant joints in the other\r\n  projects.  Additionally, three of the other projects used the same brand of\r\n  windows as Magnolia North, and Brown tested several of these windows at the four\r\n  projects.  Brown indicated that he tested the windows in over 20 units, and\r\n  they consistently failed to meet the water intrusion resistance requirement\r\n  that the labeling had represented.  \r\nBrown also found sheathing\r\n  damage beneath the windows and improper weight bearing of lintels at window\r\n  heads in Magnolia Place and in other HCI projects.[6] \r\n  Other defects common to Magnolia Place and the other projects were improper\r\n  sloping on bricks, improper waterproofing, improper installation of trim\r\n  products, and improper installation of brick veneer.  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  construction defects at the other HCI developments were substantially similar\r\n  to those experienced by Magnolia North.  Further, the evidence is admissible to\r\n  prove many of the elements required for a punitive damages award.  See Mitchell\r\n  v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 584-89, 686\r\n  S.E.2d 176, 183-86 &nbsp;(2009) (listing guideposts to consider in conducting a\r\n  review of a punitive damages award)[7]; Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-12, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991)\r\n  (listing factors to consider in conducting a review of punitive damages).[8] \r\n  The evidence was relevant to the Mitchell element of the\r\n  reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct and the Gamble elements of the duration of the conduct, Appellants' awareness,\r\n  and similar past conduct.  For example,\r\n  HCI was aware of water issues in other projects as early as 1998, before\r\n  construction on Magnolia North had begun.  \r\nIn sum, the trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Instructions\r\nAppellants maintain they\r\n  should receive a new trial because the trial court gave the jury two erroneous\r\n  instructions  regarding: (1) actual damages on the POA's negligence claim; and\r\n  (2) punitive damages.  We address each of these issues in turn.\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard for\r\n  Jury Instructions  \r\nThe trial court is required\r\n  to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. &nbsp; Clark\r\n  v.

Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497-98, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999).&nbsp;  A jury charge that is substantially\r\n  correct and covers the law does not require reversal.  &nbsp;Id. at 496,\r\n  514 S.E.2d at 574. \r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual Damages\r\n  on Negligence Claim\r\nAppellants maintain the trial\r\n  court instructed the jury that it had granted a directed verdict to the POA on\r\n  its negligence claim, and, therefore, the jury must award the POA damages on\r\n  this claim.  Appellants argue the trial court improperly gave the jury the\r\n  impression it had already determined the POA had established proximate cause. \r\n  We disagree with Appellants' interpretation of the trial court's jury\r\n  instruction.\r\nAt the close of evidence, the\r\n  trial court directed verdicts for the POA on their claims for negligence and\r\n  breach of warranty of workmanlike services.  As to the negligence claim, the\r\n  trial court instructed the jury, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Now I\r\n    charge you that as a matter of law, I have determined that the defendants were\r\n    negligent and breached the implied warranty of workmanlike services in the\r\n    construction of these condominiums and as a result of [sic] you must award the\r\n    plaintiff property owners['] association damages proximately caused by the negligent construction.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  \r\nAppellants argue the trial\r\n  court's inclusion of the phrase &quot;proximately caused by the negligent\r\n  construction&quot; following its statement that the jury must award damages did\r\n  not remedy the error.  We disagree.  The trial court's statement sufficiently\r\n  qualified the requirement to award damages by describing the damages as those\r\n  &quot;proximately caused by the negligent construction.&quot;  See Stevens v. Allen 342 S.C. 47, 51, 536 S.E.2d 663, 665&nbsp;(2000) (setting\r\n  forth the prerequisites to an award of damages on a negligence claim).  \r\nBecause the challenged jury\r\n  instruction accurately reflected all elements required to be established for a\r\n  damages award on the POA's negligence claim, the trial court did not commit\r\n  error in  giving its charge.  See Stewart v. Richland Mem'l Hosp.,\r\n  350 S.C. 589, 595, 567 S.E.2d 510, 513 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating a jury charge\r\n  that is substantially correct does not require reversal).  \r\nc.&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\nAppellants contend their due\r\n  process rights were violated by the trial court's instruction advising the jury\r\n  it had a duty to award punitive damages if it found the plaintiff entitled to\r\n  such.  Appellants argue it no longer is appropriate for South Carolina to\r\n  require the imposition of punitive damages after the jury determines the\r\n  plaintiff's entitlement because a judicial evaluation of a punitive damages\r\n  award is required, pursuant to State Farm Mutual\r\n  Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell, 538\r\n  U.S. 408 (2003) and Mitchell v. Fortis Insurance Co., 385 S.C. 570, 584-89, 686 S.E.2d 176, 183-86&nbsp;(2009). \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAppellants\r\n  challenge the following portion of the trial court's jury instruction on\r\n  punitive damages:\r\n\r\n  If you should find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover\r\n    punitive damages in\r\n    addition to actual damages, it would be your duty to include such damages in\r\n    your verdict and award such an amount as you may deem reasonable and proper in\r\n    light of the facts and circumstances.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThis court has\r\n  previously held that in South Carolina, the award of punitive damages does not\r\n  rest in the jury's discretion, but is recoverable as a matter of right.  Broom\r\n  v. Se. Highway Contracting Co., 291 S.C. 93, 98, 352 S.E.2d 302, 305&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;1986), abrogated on other grounds, Davenport v. Cotton Hope\r\n  Plantation Horizontal Prop.

Co., 183 S.C. 399,\r\n  410, 191 S.E. 209, 214 (1937)).  In Sample,\r\n  our supreme court held there was no error in charging the jury that it would have\r\n  a duty to award punitive damages if it found that the plaintiff's rights\r\n  &quot;had been consciously, willfully, and recklessly violated.&quot;  183 S.C.\r\n  at 410, 191 S.E. at 214.  In that case, the court stated:\r\n\r\n  [U]nder the settled rule prevailing in this state punitive damages\r\n    are awarded not only as punishment for a wrong, but also as vindication of [a] private\r\n    right, and when under proper allegations a plaintiff proves a\r\n      willful, wanton, reckless, or malicious violation of his rights, it is not\r\n    only the right but the duty of the jury to award punitive damages.\r\n\r\nId. at 410, 191 S.E. at 214 (emphasis added). \r\n  Appellants argue Broom and Sample are no longer controlling in\r\n  light of the concerns expressed in Campbell and Mitchell.  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn Campbell,\r\n  the United States Supreme Court acknowledged the existence of procedural and\r\n  substantive constitutional limitations on punitive damages awards.  538 U.S. at\r\n  416.  It explained: &quot;The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n  prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or\r\n  arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.&quot;  Id.  (citations omitted); see\r\n  also BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, 517\r\n  U.S. 559, 568 (1996) (&quot;Only when an award can\r\n  fairly be categorized as 'grossly excessive' in relation to these interests\r\n  does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of\r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;); Pacific\r\n  Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499\r\n  U.S. 1, 22 (1991) (holding that the Alabama Supreme\r\n  Court's post-verdict review ensured that punitive damage awards were not\r\n  grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense and had some\r\n  understandable relationship to compensatory damages).  In this context, Campbell primarily addressed the\r\n  excessiveness of punitive damages awards, and it imposed limits on whether to\r\n  include any punitive damages in a verdict only to the extent that the conduct\r\n  on which the award is based does not have a nexus to the plaintiff's harm or is\r\n  not sufficiently reprehensible to justify such an award.  Id. at 419, 422-23. \r\n  Otherwise, states retain discretion over the imposition of punitive damages.  Id. at 416 (&quot;While States possess discretion over the imposition of punitive\r\n  damages, it is well established that there are procedural and substantive\r\n  constitutional limitations on these awards.  The Due Process Clause of the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary\r\n  punishments on a tortfeasor.&quot;) (citations omitted). \r\nIn Mitchell,\r\n  our state supreme court implemented the constitutional limitations set forth in Campbell, Gore, and Haslip.  The Mitchell opinion\r\n  confirmed that Gore and Haslip addressed the excessiveness of\r\n  punitive damages awards and that Campbell prohibited any punitive\r\n  damages award for conduct unrelated to the plaintiff's harm or conduct that was\r\n  insufficiently reprehensible.  385 S.C. at 584-86, 686 S.E.2d at 183-84.  Further,\r\n  in Campbell, the United States Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n  [P]unitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant's\r\n    culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to\r\n    warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or\r\n    deterrence.\r\n\r\nCampbell, 538 U.S. at 419.  This language dovetails with Sample's\r\n  requirement that &quot;when . . . a plaintiff proves a willful, wanton, reckless, or\r\n  malicious violation of his rights, it is not only the right but the duty of the\r\n  jury to award punitive damages.&quot;  183 S.C. at\r\n  410, 191 S.E. at 214 (emphasis added).  \r\nIn other words, only after\r\n  the jury has evaluated the evidence and concluded the plaintiff is entitled to\r\n  punitive damages does it become the jury's &quot;duty&quot; to impose such\r\n  damages on the defendant.  This is precisely what the trial court in the\r\n  present case instructed:  &quot;If you should find\r\n  that the plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive damages in addition to\r\n  actual damages, it would be your duty to include such damages in your verdict\r\n  and award such an amount as you may deem reasonable and proper in light of the\r\n  facts and circumstances.&quot;  This instruction communicated to the\r\n  jury that it had the discretion to determine the POA's entitlement to punitive\r\n  damages; and, if entitlement were so determined, the duty to award punitive\r\n  damages.  \r\nAppellants argue that Haslip prohibits states from requiring the imposition of punitive damages.  We do not\r\n  interpret Haslip as Appellants suggest.  First, in Haslip, the\r\n  issue of whether states may require the imposition of punitive damages was not\r\n  squarely before the Court.  Rather, the Court in Haslip analyzed the\r\n  adequacy of Alabama's method for assessing punitive damage awards, which\r\n  included a jury instruction explaining the nature, purpose, and basis for the\r\n  award; a post-trial review enabling the trial court to scrutinize the award;\r\n  and an appellate review process ensuring that the award was reasonable and\r\n  rational.  499 U.S. at 19-23.  Rather than expressing a need to increase the jury's\r\n  discretion in the imposition of punitive damages, the Haslip opinion\r\n  expressed a need to limit the jury's discretion:  \r\n\r\n  To be sure, the instructions gave the jury significant discretion\r\n    in its determination of punitive damages.  But that discretion was not\r\n    unlimited.  It was confined to deterrence and retribution, the state policy\r\n    concerns sought to be advanced.  And if punitive damages were to be awarded,\r\n      the jury &quot;must take into consideration the character and the degree of the\r\n      wrong as shown by the evidence and necessity of preventing similar wrong.&quot;\r\n     The instructions thus enlightened the jury as to the punitive damages'\r\n    nature and purpose, identified the damages as punishment for civil wrongdoing\r\n    of the kind involved, and explained that their imposition was not compulsory.\r\n  . . . \r\n  As long as the discretion is exercised within reasonable\r\n    constraints, due process is satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 19 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).  Thus, Appellants'\r\n  interpretation of Haslip is unfounded.  The Court did not prohibit\r\n  states from requiring the jury to impose punitive damages after evaluating the\r\n  evidence and determining the plaintiff's entitlement.  \r\nIn Campbell, which\r\n  post-dates Haslip, the United States Supreme Court clearly recognized\r\n  the discretion of the state to establish policies on punitive damages, within\r\n  the constitutional limits of excessiveness and arbitrariness.  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 416.  South Carolina imposes a\r\n  duty on the jury to award punitive damages only after it determines the\r\n  plaintiff is entitled to such an award based on its characterization of the\r\n  conduct harming the plaintiff as willful, wanton, malicious, or reckless.  Therefore,\r\n  the dictum in Haslip, on which Appellants rely, cannot justify a departure\r\n  from South Carolina precedent on the jury's duty to award punitive damages upon\r\n   the determination of entitlement.  See Clark v. Cantrell, 339\r\n  S.C. 369, 390, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000) (&quot;[T]he trial court is required\r\n  to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.&quot;). &nbsp;  &nbsp; \r\n    \r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial\r\n  court's punitive damages instruction as a whole falls within the limits of due\r\n  process and does not constitute reversible error.  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nAppellants assert the trial\r\n  court should not have directed a verdict for the POA on its claims for\r\n  negligence and breach of warranty of workmanlike services.  Appellants argue\r\n  the trial court misconstrued counsel's acknowledgment that defects existed as\r\n  an admission that Appellants were &quot;negligent as to, and were the proximate\r\n  cause of, all of the alleged defects.&quot;  Appellants further argue:  (1)\r\n  the factual issues as to whether certain defective conditions existed, and the\r\n  extent of such defects, should have been left for the jury to decide; and (2)\r\n  these factual issues go to the question of liability.  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling\r\n  on motions for directed verdict,\r\n  the trial court must view the evidence\r\n  and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the\r\n  light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.  Law v. S.C. Dep't\r\n  of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).  The trial court should deny the motions when either the evidence yields more than one inference\r\n  or its inference is in doubt.  McMillan v. Oconee\r\n  Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006). \r\n  &quot;However, this rule does not authorize submission of\r\n  speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the\r\n  jury.&quot;  Proctor v. Dep't of\r\n  Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 292-93, 628 S.E.2d 496, 503 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).  \r\nIn order to\r\n  establish a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must show:  (1) the defendant\r\n  owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached the duty by a\r\n  negligent act or omission; (3) the defendant's breach was the actual and\r\n  proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an\r\n  injury or damages.  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 400, 645 S.E.2d 245,\r\n  250&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp;  Further, to establish a claim for breach of the implied\r\n  warranty of workmanlike services, the plaintiff must show that the builder failed\r\n  to perform its work in a careful, diligent, and workmanlike manner.  Smith\r\n  v. Breedlove, 377 S.C. 415, 422, 661 S.E.2d 67, 71&nbsp; (2008) (holding\r\n  that a builder who contracts to construct a dwelling impliedly warrants that\r\n  the work undertaken will be performed in a careful, diligent, and workmanlike\r\n  manner).\r\nHere, there was overwhelming\r\n  evidence of Appellants' failure to meet the industry standard of care in\r\n  several aspects.  Viewing the trial in its entirety, Appellants\r\n  merely contested the extent of damages.  The POA's and Appellants'\r\n  experts testified to conflicting estimates of the extent of the damages.  The reports\r\n  differed primarily in the scope of work necessary to repair the defects and the\r\n  cost of the repairs.  Gwyn Hardister,\r\n  HCI's chief operating officer and president, also acknowledged the construction\r\n  problems.  \r\nFurther, during opening\r\n  arguments, Appellants' counsel conceded liability.  As to Appellants' argument\r\n  that their counsel acknowledged only some, and not all, of the alleged defects,\r\n  the existence and extent of specific defects bear on the issue of damages\r\n  proximately caused by Appellants' negligence.  An admission of counsel or\r\n  evidence supporting less than all of the complaint's specifications of negligent\r\n  conduct is sufficient to support a directed verdict for the POA.  Cf. Deason v. Southern Ry. Co., 142 S.C. 328, 336, 140 S.E. 575, 577&nbsp;(1927)&nbsp;(&quot;The Code requires the construction of pleadings in aid of\r\n  substantial justice, and it is the rule that the proof of one specification of negligence and wantonness will entitle plaintiff to a verdict,\r\n  if the jury sees that a case has been made out.&quot;).  Appellants\r\n  claim that our supreme court's opinion in Guffey\r\n  v. Columbia/Colleton Reg'l Hosp., Inc.,\r\n  364 S.C. 158, 612 S.E.2d 695&nbsp;(2005), requires an evidentiary showing or\r\n  admission that the defendant was negligent as to each and every specification\r\n  in the complaint before the trial court may direct a verdict for the plaintiff\r\n  as to the defendant's breach of the duty of due care.  We find Appellants' assertion\r\n  misapprehends the Guffey opinion.  \r\nIn Guffey,\r\n  our supreme court held: &quot;A directed verdict should be granted where the\r\n  evidence raises no issue for the jury as to the defendant's liability.  On\r\n  review, we will affirm a directed verdict [for the defendant] where there is no\r\n  evidence on any one element of the alleged cause of action.&quot;  364\r\n  S.C. at 163, 612 S.E.2d at 697 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).  The court\r\n  was referring to the required showing of duty, breach, causation, and damages\r\n  to establish a cause of action for negligence.  The court further held the\r\n  trial judge properly granted a directed verdict for the defendant on one of the\r\n  complaint's specifications of negligence, i.e., that a hospital was negligent\r\n  in giving aftercare instructions that conflicted with the emergency room\r\n  physician's instructions, because there was no evidence the conflicting\r\n  instructions proximately caused the decedent's death.  364 S.C. at 164,\r\n  612 S.E.2d at 697.  \r\nAppellants also argue the trial court erred in\r\n  granting a directed verdict on the claims for negligence and breach of warranty\r\n  of workmanlike services because BuildStar, as the general contractor, was not\r\n  responsible for the work performed by its subcontractors.  This argument has no\r\n  merit.  Although a general contractor is not automatically responsible for the\r\n  negligence of a subcontractor, a builder who undertakes to supervise the\r\n  construction of a building has a duty to exercise reasonable care.  See Fields\r\n  v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 561, 658 S.E.2d 80, 88-89\r\n  (2008) (rejecting the argument that a general contractor is automatically\r\n  responsible for the negligence of a subcontractor, but approving jury\r\n  instructions that included the law imposing a duty on a general contractor to\r\n  use due care in supervising a subcontractor).  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  trial court properly directed a verdict for the POA on its causes of action for\r\n  negligence and breach of warranty of workmanlike services.  \r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellants'\r\n  Directed Verdict Motion\r\nAppellants contend the trial\r\n  court erred in denying their motions for a directed verdict and JNOV on all of\r\n  the POA's causes of action.  Appellants argue: (1) they were not equitably\r\n  estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense; and (2) the\r\n  POA failed to establish damages as to its claims.  Appellants also contend the trial\r\n  court erred in denying their directed verdict and JNOV motions as to negligence\r\n  and punitive damages because the POA failed to establish: (1) each Appellant\r\n  violated its respective standard of care; and (2) punitive damages by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence as to each Appellant.  We disagree.  \r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard as the trial court.  Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp.,\r\n  361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004).  The court is required to view\r\n  the evidence and inferences that\r\n  reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236\r\n  (2002).  An appellate court will only reverse the trial court's ruling when no\r\n  evidence supports the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by an error of\r\n  law.  Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336\r\n  S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).\r\nIn the instant matter, the\r\n  trial court held \r\n\r\n  I find\r\n    that equitable tolling applies and that based on when the suit was filed and\r\n    the property turned over to the homeowners['] association that the, the defense\r\n    is estopped from raising the statute of limitations defense . . . .\r\n\r\nWe address the theories of\r\n  equitable tolling and equitable estoppel in turn.  \r\n a.  Equitable\r\n  Tolling\r\nThe POA's claims\r\n  are governed by a three-year statute of limitations.  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  § 15-3-530 (2005) (establishing\r\n  three years as the limitation for filing an action on a contract, obligation,\r\n  or liability, except those provided for in section 15-3-520).  Appellants maintain that the statute began\r\n  to run on March 8, 2000, the date of the POA's first meeting.  Thus, they\r\n  argue, the statute expired prior to the filing of this action on May 28, 2003.  We agree with the trial\r\n  court's ruling that equitable tolling is justified in this case.  \r\nIn Hooper v.\r\n  Ebenezer Senior Services and Rehabilitation Center, our supreme court\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  Equitable tolling is judicially created; it stems from the\r\n    judiciary's inherent power to formulate rules of procedure where justice\r\n    demands it.  Where a statute sets a limitation period for action, courts have\r\n    invoked the equitable tolling doctrine to suspend or extend the statutory\r\n    period to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.  \r\n  The party claiming the statute of limitations should be tolled\r\n    bears the burden of establishing sufficient facts to justify its use.  \r\n  It has been observed that equitable tolling typically applies in\r\n    cases where a litigant was prevented from filing suit because of an\r\n    extraordinary event beyond his or her control. \r\n  . . . \r\n  The equitable power of a court is not bound by cast-iron rules but\r\n    exists to do fairness and is flexible and\r\n    adaptable to particular exigencies so that relief will be granted when,\r\n    in view of all the circumstances, to deny it would permit one party to\r\n      suffer a gross wrong at the hands of the other.  Equitable tolling may be\r\n    applied where it is justified under all the circumstances.\r\n\r\n386 S.C. 108, 115-17,\r\n  687 S.E.2d 29, 32-33&nbsp;(2009) (citations and quotation marks omitted)\r\n  (emphasis added).  Unlike equitable estoppel, equitable tolling does not\r\n  require a showing that the defendant has made a misrepresentation to the\r\n  plaintiff.  See Hooper, 386 S.C. at 115, 687 S.E.2d at 32 (&quot;Equitable\r\n  tolling is judicially created; it stems from the judiciary's inherent power to\r\n  formulate rules of procedure where justice demands it.&quot;). \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the POA board consisted of Appellants' officers until the date of\r\n  &quot;turnover,&quot; September 9, 2002.  We find unpersuasive Appellants'\r\n  claim that an organization they controlled would have initiated an action\r\n  against itself during this period. Further, after the property owners gained\r\n  control over the POA, they exercised due diligence by filing this action on May\r\n  28, 2003, approximately eight months after assuming control.  Therefore, we\r\n  affirm the trial court's ruling on this issue. \r\nb.  Equitable\r\n  Estoppel\r\nThe law on equitable\r\n  estoppel also supports the trial court's ruling.  In South Carolina, \r\n\r\n  [a] defendant will be estopped to assert the statute of\r\n    limitations in bar of a plaintiff's claim when the delay that otherwise would\r\n    give operation to the statute has been induced by the defendant's conduct. \r\n  The doctrine is, of course, most clearly applicable where the\r\n    aggrieved party's delay in bringing suit was caused by his opponent's intentional misrepresentation; but deceit is not an essential element of estoppel.  It\r\n    is sufficient that the aggrieved party reasonably relied on the words\r\n    and conduct of the person to be estopped in allowing the limitations period to\r\n    expire. \r\n  The conduct may involve either inducing the plaintiff to believe\r\n    that an amicable adjustment of the claim will be made without suit or inducing\r\n    the plaintiff in some other way to forbear exercising his right to sue.  Some\r\n    courts hold that repairs by a defendant may toll the statute of limitations.  One's\r\n    assurances to an injured party that defects can be corrected coupled with his\r\n    attempts to correct them is conduct that may lead the injured party to reasonably\r\n      believe that it will receive satisfaction without resort to litigation. \r\n  \r\n  Dillon Cnty.

Statute\r\n  of Limitations as to Breach of Fiduciary Duty         \r\nAppellants argue\r\n  that the trial court erred in its conclusions regarding equitable tolling and\r\n  equitable estoppel, and, as a result, the trial court should have granted\r\n  Appellants' motion for a directed verdict on the ground of the statute of\r\n  limitations.  However, the POA asserts that, even if neither equitable tolling\r\n  nor equitable estoppel apply to this case, the statute of limitations did not\r\n  begin to run on the breach of fiduciary duty claim until HCI turned over its control\r\n  of the POA to the owners on September 9, 2002, because this was the date that\r\n  the breach occurred.  We agree.\r\nIn Concerned\r\n  Dunes West Residents, Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., our supreme court\r\n  held:\r\n\r\n  [T]he developer has a fiduciary duty to the POA to transfer common\r\n    areas that are in good repair; if the developer transfers substandard common\r\n    areas, the developer must, at the time of transfer, provide the POA with\r\n    the funds necessary to bring the common areas up to a standard of reasonably\r\n    good repair.  The developer who breaches this duty, by transferring common\r\n    areas that are not in reasonably good repair and without the funds necessary to\r\n    bring the common areas up to standard, is liable to the POA for all damages\r\n    proximately flowing from the breach, including damages for the continued\r\n    deterioration of these areas.\r\n    349 S.C. 251, 260, 562 S.E.2d\r\n    633, 638&nbsp;(2002) (emphasis added).  Therefore, in the present case, the\r\n    breach occurred on September 9, 2002, the date HCI turned over control of the\r\n    POA to the unit owners.  Because the POA filed its breach of fiduciary duty\r\n    claim approximately eight months later, the three-year statute of limitations had\r\n    not yet expired.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-530 (2005) (establishing\r\n    three years as the limitation for filing an\r\n    action on a contract, obligation, or liability, except those provided for in\r\n    section 15-3-520).  \r\n  \r\nd. Damages\r\nAppellants also assert the\r\n  POA failed to establish its damages as to any of its claims.  We disagree.\r\nTo recover\r\n  damages, the evidence must enable the jury to determine the amount of damages\r\n  with reasonable certainty or accuracy.  Whisenant v. James Island Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281\r\n  S.E.2d 794, 796 (1981).  However, &quot;proof with mathematical certainty of\r\n  the amount of loss or damage is not required.&quot;  Id.  The\r\n  determination of damages may depend to some extent on the consideration of\r\n  contingent events if a reasonable basis of computation is provided, allowing a\r\n  reasonably close estimate of the loss.  Piggy Park Enter., Inc. v. Schofield,\r\n  251 S.C. 385, 391-92, 162 S.E.2d 705, 708 (1968).\r\nHere, the POA's expert in building diagnostics testified that in\r\n  his investigation of buildings, he often finds hidden damages.  He also\r\n  testified that it is common for buildings like those at Magnolia North to look\r\n  great on the outside, but to reveal rot &quot;when you peel the onion[.]&quot;  Further, the POA's expert in estimating construction repair testified that usually, hidden\r\n  damage in condominium projects is approximately twenty percent of the contract\r\n  price, and he had included a hidden damage allowance in his estimate to repair\r\n  Magnolia North.[9] \r\n  This evidence provides a\r\n  sufficiently reasonable basis of computation of damages to support the trial\r\n  court's submission of damages to the jury.  See May v. Hopkinson,\r\n  289 S.C. 549, 559, 347 S.E.2d 508, 514 (Ct. App. 1986) (affirming the award of\r\n  damages based on the contractor's repair estimate even though the exact repairs\r\n  needed could not be determined because the removal of defective wood was\r\n  expected to reveal additional problems).  \r\nAppellants also\r\n  argue that as to the breach of fiduciary duty claim, the POA failed to offer evidence of its\r\n  damages at the time of the transfer of control.  In response, the POA contends\r\n  the construction defects in question existed at the time of the  transfer of\r\n  control.  We agree with the POA that the evidence of construction defects,\r\n  combined with Prime South's estimate\r\n  for repair costs, was sufficient to allow the jury to determine the resulting\r\n  damages from Appellants' breach of fiduciary duty.  \r\n\r\n  [T]he developer has a fiduciary duty to the POA to transfer common\r\n    areas that are in good repair; if the developer transfers substandard common\r\n    areas, the developer must, at the time of transfer, provide the POA with the\r\n    funds necessary to bring the common areas up to a standard of reasonably good\r\n    repair.  The developer who breaches this duty, by transferring common areas\r\n    that are not in reasonably good repair and without the funds necessary to bring\r\n    the common areas up to standard, is liable to the POA for all damages proximately\r\n    flowing from the breach, including damages for the continued deterioration\r\n      of these areas.\r\n\r\n  Concerned Dunes West Residents, Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 349 S.C.\r\n  251, 260, 562 S.E.2d 633, 638&nbsp;(2002)&nbsp;(emphasis added).  Therefore,\r\n  Prime South's estimate for repair costs properly included the current cost to\r\n  repair the construction defects.\r\nAppellants\r\n  further maintain that general maintenance\r\n  items were improperly included in the damages total, citing Jennifer Harmon's\r\n  testimony regarding the amount the POA spent on repairs after the turnover of\r\n  control to the unit owners.[10] \r\n  However, any mistaken inclusion of general maintenance items in Harmon's repair\r\n  records does not detract from the strength of other evidence of damages.  Chris\r\n  Cooper estimated the total cost of repairs, not including an owners'\r\n  contingency or contract administration fee, as $7,793,468.  After the owners'\r\n  contingency and contract administration fee were added, the total contract\r\n  price was $9,310,902.  Id.  The POA also sought reimbursement for the\r\n  total amount it had to spend on repairs since the transfer of control from\r\n  Appellants to the unit owners.  Jennifer Harmon testified this amount was over\r\n  $500,000.  However, the jury awarded the POA only $6,500,000 in actual\r\n  damages.  Thus, even if Harmon's repair records included some general\r\n  maintenance items, there was sufficient evidence of other damages to support\r\n  the $6.5 million award for actual damages.  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  trial court properly denied Appellants' directed verdict and JNOV motions.[11]\r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Punitive\r\n  Damages Award\r\nFinally, Appellants contend\r\n  the admission of evidence of defects at HCI projects other than Magnolia North\r\n  violated their due process rights because it resulted in the imposition of\r\n  punitive damages based on alleged harm to non-parties to this litigation. \r\n  Appellants also argue the punitive damages award was inconsistent with the\r\n  guidelines established in Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d\r\n  350 (1991), and Mitchell v. Fortis Insurance Co., 385 S.C. 570, 584-89, 686 S.E.2d 176, 183-86&nbsp;(2009).[12]  \r\na.  Non-parties\r\nAppellants contend the admission of evidence of defects at HCI projects\r\n  other than Magnolia North violated their due process rights because it resulted\r\n  in the imposition of punitive damages based on alleged harm to non-parties to\r\n  this litigation.  We need not address\r\n  this issue because we have previously determined the trial court properly admitted\r\n  evidence of defects at other HCI developments.[13]  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address an\r\n  issue when a decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nb. Gamble/Mitchell\r\n  factors\r\nAppellants maintain that the Gamble and Mitchell factors require the award in this case to be set aside.  In\r\n  particular, Appellants argue (1) the award of punitive damages has no deterrent\r\n  effect because Appellants went out of business prior to the commencement of\r\n  this litigation, and (2) Appellants have no ability to pay punitive damages.  \r\nAssuming, arguendo, the lack\r\n  of a deterrent effect on Appellants, neither this consideration nor the absence\r\n  of evidence of Appellants' ability to pay punitive damages precludes such an\r\n  award if the trial court's findings on other relevant factors are sufficient to\r\n  uphold the award.  See Miller v. City of W.\r\n  Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 231-32, 471 S.E.2d\r\n  683, 687-88 (1996) (rejecting Appellant's argument\r\n  that the trial court erred in failing to strike the punitive damages award because the record did not\r\n  establish that he had an ability to pay and holding the trial court was not\r\n  required to make specific findings of fact for each Gamble factor); id. at 232, 471 S.E.2d at 687 (&quot;[E]ven if the record did not establish that [Appellant]\r\n  . . . had an ability to pay, the judge's findings on the remaining factors are\r\n  sufficient to uphold the jury's award of punitive damages.&quot;).  Here,\r\n  the trial court conducted a post-trial\r\n  review of the punitive damages award using the factors outlined in Gamble and Mitchell and properly set forth its findings on the record.  Considering the factors in both Gamble and Mitchell,\r\n  the evidence supports the trial court's post-trial review of the punitive\r\n  damages award.  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the trial court properly upheld the jury's punitive damages\r\n  award.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  jury's verdict is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This court recently issued an opinion in a similar\r\n  action against Heritage Communities, Inc. and BuildStar Corporation brought by\r\n  the property owners' association at the Riverwalk development in Myrtle Beach.  See Pope v. Heritage Cmtys., Inc., 395 S.C. 404, 717 S.E.2d 765\r\n  (Ct. App. 2011).  \r\n[2] HCI was the parent corporation of both HMNI (the\r\n  seller) and BuildStar (the general contractor responsible for supervising all\r\n  construction).  Prior to the construction, HCI and BuildStar developed numerous\r\n  other properties in Horry County, South Carolina.  \r\n[3] Prior to trial, HCI went out of business.  \r\n[4] HCI developments included Magnolia Place, Riverwalk,\r\n  The Gardens, Azalea Lakes, Avian Forest, and Magnolia North.  \r\n[5] This court reached the same conclusion in Pope v.\r\n  Heritage Communities, Inc., 395 S.C. 404, 717 S.E.2d 765 (Ct. App. 2011).  \r\n[6] A lintel is a horizontal architectural member\r\n  spanning and usually carrying the load above an opening.  Merriam-Webster's\r\n  Collegiate Dictionary at 725 (11th ed. 2003).\r\n[7] The Mitchell guideposts are:  (1) the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct; (2)\r\n  the disparity between the actual or potential harm to the plaintiff and the\r\n  amount of the punitive damage award; and (3) the difference between the\r\n  punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or\r\n  imposed in comparable cases.  Mitchell, 385\r\n  S.C. at 584-89, 686 S.E.2d at 183-86.  In Mitchell, our supreme court announced that its previous opinion in Gamble remained relevant to the post-judgment due process analysis only insofar as it\r\n  added substance to the guideposts in BMW of North America v. Gore, 517\r\n  U.S. 559 (1996) and adopted in Mitchell.  The\r\n  supreme court decided Mitchell on September 14, 2009, after the trial court\r\n  had already conducted a punitive damages review in the present case.\r\n[8] The Gamble factors are:  (1) defendant's\r\n  degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness\r\n  or concealment; (4) existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood of\r\n  deterring the defendant or others from similar conduct; (6) whether the award\r\n  is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7)\r\n  defendant's ability to pay; and (8) other factors deemed appropriate.  Gamble,\r\n  305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354.\r\n[9] Appellants argue this expert's\r\n  estimate of hidden damage was speculative because his past experience in\r\n  assessing hidden damage included some buildings with stucco siding, while\r\n  Magnolia North's buildings had Hardie Plank siding above a brick veneer. \r\n  However, the fact that this expert's past experience with assessing hidden\r\n  damages included buildings with stucco siding would go to the weight of the\r\n  evidence rather than its existence.  Cf. Dep't\r\n  of Transp. v. Rogers, 259 S.E.2d 775&nbsp;(N.C. Ct. App.&nbsp;1979)\r\n  (holding that there was no error in admitting into evidence the testimony of the\r\n  defendant's expert regarding the value of the defendant's condemned property\r\n  because the fact that the expert had not observed the property at the time of the\r\n  taking went to the weight given his testimony by the jury).\r\n[10] Jennifer Harmon worked for the Noble Company, which\r\n  managed the Magnolia North property for the POA. \r\n[11] Appellants also\r\n  argue (1) the POA failed to establish that each Appellant violated its\r\n  respective standard of care, and (2) the jury's award of punitive damages was\r\n  not based on individualized determinations that clear and convincing evidence\r\n  supported such damages against each Appellant.  Because the trial court did not\r\n  err in finding Appellants' entities were amalgamated, it is unnecessary to\r\n  address this issue.  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n  Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate\r\n  court need not address an issue when a decision on a prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).\r\n[12] See supra n. 7 &amp; n. 8.\r\n[13] As stated earlier in this opinion, the evidence of\r\n  other HCI projects was relevant to the Gamble elements of the duration of the conduct, Appellants' awareness,\r\n  and similar past conduct.  For example,\r\n  HCI was aware of water issues in other projects as early as 1998, before\r\n  construction on Magnolia North had begun.  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4944","title":"Consumer Advocate v.

Elam, Jr., and Hana P.

(NCCI), files loss costs on behalf of\r\n  all insurers with the DOI for approval.  The filing by the NCCI contains an\r\n  overall increase or decrease.  In November 2008, the NCCI presented a loss\r\n  costs filing with a -0.3% change in the overall loss costs figure—an overall\r\n  decrease.  However, that overall figure contains approximately 700 job\r\n  classifications—roofers, attorneys, and teachers, for example—and the increases\r\n  and decreases among the various classifications averaged out to an overall\r\n  decrease.  The DOI did not publish notice of this filing, and the Consumer\r\n  Advocate sued contending that section 38-73-910(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2010) mandated the filing.  \r\nThe\r\n  ALC determined the plain language of the statute indicated publication of the\r\n  loss costs filing was only required when there was an overall increase to the\r\n  loss costs and the fact that the DOI may have previously interpreted the\r\n  statute differently was not persuasive because its interpretation had been an\r\n  error of law.  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n&quot;Statutory interpretation\r\n  is a question of law.&quot;  Hopper v. Terry Hunt Constr., 373 S.C. 475,\r\n  479, 646 S.E.2d 162, 165 (Ct. App. 2007).  This court is free to decide matters\r\n  of law with no particular deference to the lower court.  Pressley v. REA\r\n    Constr. Co., 374 S.C. 283, 287, 648 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Consumer Advocate contends the ALC erred in finding section 38-73-910(A) did\r\n  not require publication of notice of the loss costs filing because the filing\r\n  contained an overall decrease.  We agree.\r\n&quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the\r\n  one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered\r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the\r\n  intended purpose of the statute.&quot;  Kiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns,\r\n    Inc.,\r\n  312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).  &quot;The\r\n  court has no right to add the words [the legislature] omitted, nor to\r\n  interpolate them on conceits of symmetry and policy.&quot;  Kinard v. Moore,\r\n  220 S.C. 376, 388, 68 S.E.2d 321, 325 (1951) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \r\nLanguage in a statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes\r\n  with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.  Hitachi Data\r\n    Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992). &quot;Any ambiguity in a statute\r\n  should be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of\r\n  the law.&quot;  Bennett v. Sullivan's Island Bd. of Adjustment, 313 S.C.\r\n  455, 458, 438 S.E.2d 273, 274 (Ct. App. 1993).  &quot;Courts will reject a\r\n  statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it\r\n  could not have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain\r\n  legislative intention.&quot;  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 351, 688\r\n  S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010).    \r\nSection\r\n  38-73-910(A) provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)  An increase in the\r\n    premium rates may not be granted for workers' compensation insurance, nor for\r\n    any other line or type of insurance with respect to which the director or his\r\n    designee has, by order, made a finding that (a) legal or other compulsion upon the\r\n    part of the insured to purchase the insurance interferes with competition, or\r\n    (b) under prevailing circumstances there does not exist substantial\r\n    competition, unless notice is given in all newspapers of general, statewide\r\n    circulation at least thirty days in advance of the insurer's proposed effective\r\n    date of the increase in premium rates. The notice must state the amount of\r\n    increase, the type and line of coverage, and the proposed effective date and must\r\n      allow any insured or affected party to request within fifteen days a public\r\n    hearing upon the propriety of the rate increase request before the\r\n    Administrative Law Judge Division.  A copy of the notice must be sent to the\r\n    Consumer Advocate.  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nSection 38-73-910(A) states notice is to be given when there is &quot;an\r\n  increase&quot; in rates.  In this case, the NCCI's filing contains increases in\r\n  many classifications.  Had the legislature intended to make publication a\r\n  requirement only for overall increases, it could have amended section 38-73-910\r\n  to specify it is only concerned with &quot;overall&quot; increases as it did in\r\n  other paragraphs of section 38-73-910.  \r\nFurthermore, the overarching purpose of the statute is to give any\r\n  &quot;insured or affected party&quot; the opportunity to protest rate increases before they become effective.  We acknowledge that 38-73-910(A) does not\r\n  specifically recognize some of the restructuring of the workers' compensation\r\n  ratemaking process.  The notice of NCCI's filing only serves to put insureds on\r\n  inquiry notice that their rate may ultimately be affected by a loss costs\r\n  increase.  Nevertheless, to interpret section 38-73-910(A) as applying only to\r\n  overall increases is contrary to the statute's purpose.  Under the DOI's\r\n  interpretation, an insured might get notice of the filing one year and might\r\n  not get notice the following year even though that insured's loss costs\r\n  increased in both years.  Such an arbitrary result cannot have been intended.   \r\nBased on the language and intent of the statute, we conclude the\r\n  ALC's determination was in error.  Because we conclude section 38-73-910(A)\r\n  mandates publication of the notice of the NCCI's loss costs filing, we need not\r\n  address the Consumer Advocate's remaining argument regarding whether the\r\n  failure to publish the notice constitutes a due process violation.  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address\r\n    remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nTherefore\r\n  the order of the ALC is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4945","title":"State v.

Walker, Op. No. 2004-UP-618 (S.C. Ct. App. filed\r\n  Dec. 9, 2004).\r\nIn January 2005, Walker\r\n  filed a PCR application alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.  Walker\r\n  argued trial counsel was ineffective because she did not (1) investigate Reed\r\n  as an alibi witness, (2) ask for a continuance to await the written results of\r\n  a DNA test, (3) cross-examine the victim about her alcohol use, and (4) cross-examine\r\n  the victim and call other witnesses about the victim's conflicting statements\r\n  as to the time of the incident.\r\nTrial counsel testified at\r\n  the PCR hearing that she watched the DVD of Walker's interview.  In the\r\n  interview, Walker referred to Reed numerous times and claimed he could not have\r\n  committed the crimes because he spent the night with her on March 2, 2002.  Specifically,\r\n  Walker admitted he was at the BP station on March 2, but denied helping the\r\n  victim fix her car.  He said he left the BP station and went to see Reed at\r\n  Hardee's, where she worked as a manager.  Walker said he then stayed at a\r\n  friend's house until about 10:00 p.m., when he drove to Reed's house to spend\r\n  the night.\r\nDespite watching the DVD\r\n  of the interview, trial counsel did not investigate Reed as a potential\r\n  witness.  At the PCR hearing, she claimed she thought her investigator was\r\n  following up on Reed.  Walker testified he told the investigator about Reed,\r\n  and the investigator wrote Reed's name in the case file.  Trial counsel said\r\n  she did not know what, if anything, her investigator did to investigate Reed.  She\r\n  also testified she &quot;was not aware of any claim that [Walker] was with\r\n  anyone on&quot; the night of the crime.  The PCR court summed up trial\r\n  counsel's knowledge of Reed as a potential alibi witness in the following\r\n  question: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court: So, there is an interview tape of the defendant that says he was with .\r\n    . . Ms. Reed on the night of the incident.  That name appears in the file, but\r\n    we don't know what was done as far as finding out what Ms. Reed would or would\r\n    not have said; is that correct?\r\n  [Trial\r\n    counsel]: Yes, your honor.\r\n\r\nReed testified at the PCR\r\n  hearing that Walker was her boyfriend on March 2, 2002.  She said Walker had a\r\n  key to her house and spent most weekend nights with her.  When asked if she and\r\n  Walker spent the night together on March 2, 2002, Reed answered: &quot;I guess\r\n  I did.&quot;  The judge asked Reed: &quot;You're telling me that you spent –\r\n  [Walker] was staying with you that first weekend in March of 2002.&quot;  Reed\r\n  answered &quot;Yes.&quot;  On cross-examination, however, she changed her\r\n  answer as follows:\r\n\r\n  Q:\r\n    2002 is when y'all broke up?\r\n  A:\r\n    Yea.\r\n  Q:\r\n    You know the exact date?\r\n  A:\r\n    No, sir.\r\n  Q:\r\n    But you knew he was with you that night?\r\n  A:\r\n    Huh?\r\n  Q:\r\n    You knew he was with you on March 2?\r\n  A:\r\n    Well, I know he was with me, but I can't say a particular date.  No, I don't\r\n    know what date y'all want.\r\n  Q:\r\n    But you can't remember the date y'all broke up?\r\n  A:\r\n    Right.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Do you know what you were doing the night of March 1, 2002?\r\n  A:\r\n    No, I can't go back that far.\r\n  Q:\r\n    Well, that's just the day before when you said Mr. Walker was with you?\r\n  A:\r\n    You said he was with me, but that's all I can say.\r\n  Q:\r\n    So, you don't know what you were doing March 1, 2002?\r\n  A:\r\n    We could have been together in 2002.  I don't even know what day that was.\r\n  Q:\r\n    But you don't know specifically?\r\n  A:\r\n    Right, that's what I'm saying.\r\n  Q:\r\n    But you know specifically right now what you were doing March 2, 2002?\r\n  A:\r\n    No, I ain't said that.\r\n  Q:\r\n    So, you don't know what you were doing March 2, 2002 that night?\r\n  The\r\n    Court: Ma'am, do you know whether or not you were with this man over here Mr.\r\n    Walker?\r\n  The\r\n    Witness: I know we spent a lot of days together.  I can't tell you no\r\n    particular day.\r\n  Q:\r\n    So you can't tell –\r\n  A: A\r\n    particular day; right.\r\n  Q:\r\n    You can't tell us you were with him March 2, 2002?\r\n  A:\r\n    Right.\r\n\r\nAs to Reed's testimony,\r\n  the PCR court found:\r\n\r\n  [Walker]\r\n    and Reed had an intimate relationship that was ongoing at the time of the\r\n    alleged incident    . . . .  [Reed] further testified that [Walker] was usually\r\n    with her during the time frame of [the] incident.  [Walker] testified that he\r\n    had been spending many nights, and most, if not all, weekends with Reed prior\r\n    to, and including, the date of the alleged incident . . . .  While Reed's\r\n    memory of specific dates is not perfect since it has been approximately five\r\n    years since the incident, and approximately four years since the trial, her\r\n    testimony corroborated that of [Walker].  \r\n   . . . [T]he Court finds that the testimony of Reed at the\r\n    PCR hearing was credible.\r\n  The jury would have weighed the credibility of the testimony\r\n    of the witness, and it is reasonable to assume that the outcome of the\r\n    deliberations may have been different had this witness testified in light of\r\n    the facts of this case.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court granted\r\n  Walker's application on two grounds.  First, the court found the failure to investigate\r\n  the alibi witness was deficient and prejudiced the defense.  Second, the court found\r\n  Walker\r\n\r\n  independently\r\n    established a second ground for prejudice with the cumulative effect of Trial\r\n    Counsel's error in her failure to investigate [the victim's] alcohol use, her\r\n    failure to move to continue the hearing to await the written results of the\r\n    forensic testing, her failure to cross-examine the witnesses as to the\r\n    discrepancy of the conflicting times of the incident, and her failure to\r\n    investigate or interview Reed, the combination of which prejudiced [Walker].\r\n\r\nThe judge explained that,\r\n  standing alone, none of the first three instances of deficient performance\r\n  established prejudice, but when they were added together with the failure to\r\n  investigate Reed as an alibi witness, &quot;[these] failures cumulatively\r\n  prejudiced&quot; Walker.  The State appeals both grounds upon which the PCR\r\n  judge granted the application.[1]\r\n\r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applicable Law and Standard of Review\r\nTo obtain post-conviction\r\n  relief based on the alleged denial of effective assistance of counsel under the\r\n  Sixth Amendment, the applicant must satisfy the two-prong test set out in Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).  First, the applicant must show\r\n  that trial counsel's performance was deficient based on a standard of &quot;'reasonableness\r\n  under prevailing professional norms.'&quot;  Edwards v. State, 392 S.C.\r\n  449, 456, 710 S.E.2d 60, 64 (2011) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688). \r\n  Second, the applicant &quot;must demonstrate that this deficiency prejudiced\r\n  him to the point that he was deprived of a fair trial whose result is\r\n  reliable.&quot;  Id.  To satisfy this second prong, the applicant\r\n  &quot;must demonstrate that his attorney's errors had an effect on the judgment\r\n  against him.&quot;  392 S.C. at 458-59, 710 S.E.2d at 65.  An error will be\r\n  found to affect the judgment if the applicant proves &quot;'that there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\r\n  result of the proceeding would have been different.'&quot;  392 S.C. at 459,\r\n  710 S.E.2d at 66 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).  &quot;In other\r\n  words, [the applicant] must show that 'the factfinder would have had a\r\n  reasonable doubt respecting guilt.'&quot;  Id.  (quoting Strickland,\r\n  466 U.S. at 695). \r\nAn appellate court must\r\n  affirm the factual findings of the PCR court if they are supported by any probative\r\n  evidence in the record.  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d\r\n  624, 626 (1989).  This court &quot;will reverse the PCR court only where there\r\n  is either no probative evidence to support the decision or the decision was\r\n  controlled by an error of law.&quot;  Edwards, 392 S.C. at 455, 710\r\n  S.E.2d at 64.  \r\n III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ineffective Assistance of Counsel—Alibi Witness\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp; First Prong of Strickland\r\n\r\nWe agree with the PCR court's\r\n  finding that trial counsel's failure to investigate Reed as an alibi witness\r\n  was deficient performance.  Counsel admitted she watched the DVD of Walker's\r\n  interview.  Therefore, she was aware of Walker's claim that he was with Reed on\r\n  the night of the crime.[2] \r\n  &quot;[C]riminal defense attorneys have a duty to undertake a reasonable\r\n  investigation, which at a minimum includes interviewing potential witnesses and\r\n  making an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.&quot;  Edwards, 392 S.C. at 456, 710 S.E.2d at 64.  The duty to investigate a potential\r\n  witness is even more critical when the witness might provide an alibi.  Accordingly,\r\n  the Sixth Amendment requires that criminal defense attorneys thoroughly investigate\r\n  potential alibi witnesses.\r\nTrial counsel did nothing\r\n  personally to investigate Reed as a witness.  Her claim that her investigator\r\n  was exploring Reed's role in the case also does not satisfy her obligations\r\n  under the Sixth Amendment.  The duty to represent the client belongs to the\r\n  lawyer.  While it may be reasonable to allow investigators and paralegals to do\r\n  some or all of the investigatory work, trial counsel has a duty to supervise\r\n  the investigation, make sure it is completed, and familiarize herself with the\r\n  results.  Trial counsel's failure to adequately investigate Reed as an alibi\r\n  witness under the circumstances presented in this case was unreasonable under\r\n  prevailing professional norms, and therefore deficient performance under the\r\n  Sixth Amendment.    \r\nThe State points out,\r\n  however, that the defense presented a theory that Walker and the victim had consensual\r\n  intercourse and there was no rape.  The State argues this was &quot;a far\r\n  better theory&quot; than an alibi defense because an alibi would not have\r\n  explained the victim's detailed and accurate description of Walker's house and truck. \r\n  The State thus argues that trial counsel's failure to investigate Reed as an\r\n  alibi witness is justified as a valid strategic decision.  This argument\r\n  mischaracterizes the role of strategy in the analysis of trial counsel's\r\n  performance.  If counsel had properly investigated the alibi defense, and then\r\n  made an informed strategic decision not to pursue it, the State's argument\r\n  would be persuasive.  However, because trial counsel did not conduct an\r\n  adequate investigation of the alibi defense, she could not have made an\r\n  informed strategic choice.  \r\nIn Strickland, the\r\n  Supreme Court stated that \r\n\r\n  strategic\r\n    choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to\r\n    plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made\r\n    after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent\r\n    that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on\r\n    investigation.     . . . [C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations\r\n    or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations\r\n    unnecessary.  \r\n\r\n466 U.S. at 690-91; see Council v. State, 380 S.C. 159, 175, 670 S.E.2d 356, 364 (2008).  Here,\r\n  trial counsel articulated no reasonable basis for her decision not to investigate\r\n  Reed as an alibi witness.  Therefore, reasonable professional judgment does not\r\n  support the limitation on the investigation.  Moreover, such a decision could\r\n  not have been reasonable professional judgment.  Because an alibi is a complete\r\n  defense to a criminal charge,[3] there is no conception of sound judgment that will permit trial counsel to\r\n  choose not to investigate the testimony of a witness whom counsel has reason to\r\n  believe could provide an alibi.\r\nWe find, therefore, that\r\n  there is evidence to support the PCR court's ruling that Walker met the first\r\n  prong of the Strickland test.  We agree with the court's conclusion that\r\n  trial counsel's performance was deficient because we find &quot;'counsel made\r\n  errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the &quot;counsel&quot;\r\n  guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.'&quot;  Edwards,&nbsp;392\r\n  S.C. at 456, 710 S.E.2d at 64 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).  \r\n\r\n  B.&nbsp; Second Prong of Strickland\r\n\r\nAs to the second prong of Strickland, however, we find the PCR court's ruling that trial counsel's\r\n  deficient performance prejudiced Walker was controlled by an error of law.  To\r\n  qualify as an alibi, a witness's testimony must account for the defendant's\r\n  whereabouts during the time of the crime such that it would have been\r\n  physically impossible for the defendant to commit the crime.  Glover v.\r\n    State, 318 S.C. 496, 498, 458 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1995).  Reed's testimony at\r\n  the PCR hearing did not meet the definition of alibi.  Therefore, trial counsel's\r\n  failure to present the testimony cannot form the basis of a finding of\r\n  prejudice under Strickland.  Glover, 318 S.C. at 498, 458 S.E.2d\r\n  at 539-40. \r\nThis case is similar to Glover. \r\n  There, the PCR applicant &quot;argued trial counsel was ineffective for failing\r\n  to contact several witnesses who could have testified [the applicant] was in\r\n  Florida when the crimes were committed.&quot;  318 S.C. at 497, 458 S.E.2d at\r\n  539.  One witness initially said he &quot;believed&quot; the applicant was in\r\n  Florida, but then said he could not remember and &quot;knew 'nothing.'&quot;  Id. \r\n  The second witness testified the applicant was in Florida eleven hours before\r\n  the crime was committed at a location only approximately six-and-a-half hours\r\n  away.  318 S.C. at 497-98, 498 n.1, 458 S.E.2d at 539-40, 540 n.1.  The\r\n  testimony of either witness would have made it less likely the applicant\r\n  committed the crime.  Nevertheless, the supreme court found &quot;no evidence\r\n  to support the PCR judge's finding of prejudice&quot; because &quot;neither\r\n  witness's PCR testimony established an alibi defense.&quot;  318 S.C. at 498,\r\n  458 S.E.2d at 539-40.  In support of its finding, the supreme court cited State\r\n    v. Robbins, 275 S.C. 373, 271 S.E.2d 319 (1980) for the following\r\n  proposition: &quot;[S]ince an alibi derives its potency as a defense from the\r\n  fact that it involves the physical impossibility of the accused's guilt, a\r\n  purported alibi which leaves it possible for the accused to be the guilty\r\n  person is no alibi at all.&quot;  Glover, 318 S.C. at 498, 458 S.E.2d at\r\n  540.  \r\nWe interpret Glover to establish a framework for analyzing an alleged failure to investigate an\r\n  alibi witness.  When a PCR applicant alleges trial counsel failed to\r\n  investigate or present an alibi witness, the PCR court must make two findings\r\n  to determine if counsel's deficient performance constitutes prejudice under Strickland. \r\n  First, the court must find as a matter of law whether the witness's testimony\r\n  meets the legal definition of an alibi.  Second, the court must assess the\r\n  witness's credibility.  In making the first finding, the court must consider\r\n  the entire record to determine what the testimony would have been if it had\r\n  been presented at trial.  The PCR court must consider the testimony as a whole,\r\n  take it as true and credible, and view it in the light most favorable to the PCR\r\n  applicant.  \r\nAnalyzing Reed's\r\n  testimony under the Glover framework, we conclude her testimony does not\r\n  qualify as an alibi.  Reed's testimony makes it less likely Walker is guilty. \r\n  Taken as a whole, however, her testimony does not account for Walker's\r\n  whereabouts on March 2, 2002, such that it was physically impossible that he\r\n  committed the crimes.  Although Reed began by saying Walker spent the weekend\r\n  with her, she eventually said she could not specifically remember whether\r\n  Walker spent the night with her on March 2.  Even her specific testimony that Walker\r\n  &quot;was staying with [her] that . . . weekend&quot; does not foreclose the\r\n  possibility that he arrived at her house on Saturday morning after committing\r\n  the crimes on Friday night.  Therefore, like the testimony of the two witnesses\r\n  in Glover, Reed's testimony does not establish an alibi because it\r\n  leaves open the possibility that Walker is guilty.[4]  \r\nBecause Reed's testimony\r\n  does not meet the legal definition of an alibi, Walker failed to show a\r\n  reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different if trial\r\n  counsel investigated and presented Reed's testimony.  Therefore, the PCR court\r\n  committed an error of law in finding that Walker satisfied the second prong of\r\n  the Strickland test.   \r\n\r\n IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ineffective Assistance of Counsel—Cumulative Prejudice\r\nThe PCR court found that\r\n  trial counsel's performance was deficient in three additional instances.  The PCR\r\n  court determined that Walker had not independently met the prejudice prong of\r\n  the Strickland test as to any one of these deficiencies.  However, the\r\n  court found that the cumulative effect of the three, combined with the failure\r\n  to investigate the alibi, did satisfy the prejudice prong.  We disagree.  We\r\n  find no evidence to support the PCR court's ruling that two of the instances were\r\n  deficient performance.  The other instance, which was deficient performance, and\r\n  the failure to investigate Reed as an alibi witness have no cumulative prejudicial\r\n  effect.[5]  Therefore, the PCR court erred in granting relief.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuance to Await the Written Results of a DNA Test\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found trial\r\n  counsel's performance was deficient because she did not ask for a continuance\r\n  to wait for the written report from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division\r\n  showing that no DNA evidence linked Walker to the crime.  We do not find\r\n  evidence in the record to support this finding.\r\nSLED tested a &quot;bite\r\n  mark&quot; with the victim's blood and found &quot;no DNA profile unlike the\r\n  victim.&quot;  SLED did not release the written results of this analysis until\r\n  a month after Walker's trial.  However, both the assistant solicitor and trial\r\n  counsel were aware of the test results before trial.  The assistant solicitor testified\r\n  at the PCR hearing that the verbal SLED report generally becomes available\r\n  &quot;much earlier&quot; than the written report.  The PCR court found counsel\r\n  should have sought a continuance to wait for the written SLED report because\r\n  she &quot;could have shown [the report] to the jury in order to stress that the\r\n  only evidence linking the Applicant to the incident was [the victim's]\r\n  identification.&quot;  \r\nFirst, the victim's\r\n  identification of Walker is not the only evidence linking him to the crime. \r\n  The victim's descriptions of Walker's truck and house were detailed and\r\n  accurate.  Based on these descriptions, the State was able to argue\r\n  persuasively that the victim was in Walker's house.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the trial transcript shows that counsel did stress to the jury the results of\r\n  the DNA test—that no DNA evidence was found linking Walker to the crime.  On\r\n  direct examination of the police officer assigned to the case, the officer\r\n  admitted that no DNA evidence was found in Walker's house or truck.  On\r\n  cross-examination, the officer admitted that the rape kit was never sent to\r\n  SLED for DNA testing, he was unable to collect any samples for DNA testing from\r\n  Walker's house, and hairs collected from Walker's car were not sent to SLED. \r\n  Accordingly, the SLED report would have been only marginally helpful to Walker\r\n  because the contents of the report were made known to the jury through the\r\n  testimony of the officer.  Moreover, the report would have been offered to\r\n  prove the truth of what is asserted in the report.  Thus, the report would\r\n  likely have been inadmissible hearsay.  See State v. Jennings, 394\r\n  S.C. 473, 479, 716 S.E.2d 91, 94 (2011) (finding portions of a written report\r\n  constituted inadmissible hearsay).  Trial counsel's decision not to seek a\r\n  continuance so that a marginally helpful and probably inadmissible report\r\n  containing the same information counsel could present to the jury in other\r\n  forms is not deficient performance.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    B.&nbsp; Cross-Examination of the Victim on Alcohol Use\r\n\r\nThe nurse who performed\r\n  the victim's rape kit noted that the victim told her she planned to attend\r\n  &quot;ETOH treatment&quot;[6] that week.  The PCR court found trial counsel's performance deficient because\r\n  she did not investigate the reference to &quot;ETOH treatment&quot; in the\r\n  nurse's notes or the smell of alcohol noted by the police.  The court found trial\r\n  counsel's lack of an investigation was deficient because the &quot;only\r\n  evidence linking [Walker] to [the victim] was [her] identification of [Walker]&quot;\r\n  and counsel's failure &quot;prevented the jury from considering [the victim]'s\r\n  credibility in her identification of [Walker].&quot;  We do not find any evidence\r\n  in the record to support this finding.  \r\nAs explained above, there\r\n  is more evidence linking Walker to the crime than the victim's identification. \r\n  Additionally, the jury was not prevented from considering the victim's alcohol\r\n  use on the day of the crime in assessing her credibility.  The record contains several\r\n  instances of trial counsel bringing the victim's alcohol use to the jury's\r\n  attention.  Counsel asked the victim about beer she drank while at the\r\n  assailant's house.  Counsel cross-examined the victim about the rum and coke\r\n  she drank when she got home on the morning of March 3, 2002.  Counsel\r\n  cross-examined the victim's cousin about the victim bringing an alcoholic drink\r\n  with her to the cousin's house on March 3.  Finally, counsel mentioned the\r\n  victim's alcohol use in her closing argument.  Thus, the trial transcript\r\n  reflects that trial counsel investigated and brought to the jury's attention, through\r\n  cross-examination and in closing argument, the victim's use of alcohol during\r\n  and after the incident, allowing the jury to consider how the alcohol could\r\n  have affected her credibility in identifying Walker.  \r\nWe recognize that the\r\n  nurse's note shows more than merely that the victim drank alcohol during and\r\n  after the crime.  Rather, the reference to alcohol treatment paints the victim\r\n  as an alcoholic.  However, evidence that the victim is an alcoholic is not\r\n  admissible to prove she was intoxicated at a particular time.  See Rule\r\n  404(a), SCRE (&quot;Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is\r\n  not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a\r\n  particular occasion.&quot;).  While &quot;[e]vidence of a pertinent trait of\r\n  character of the victim of the crime offered by an accused&quot; is admissible\r\n  under Rule 404(a)(2) in some circumstances, the victim's alcoholism is not a pertinent\r\n  trait of character in this case.  See State v. Mizell, 332 S.C.\r\n  273, 278, 504 S.E.2d 338, 341 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;[T]he 'prevailing view is\r\n  that only pertinent traits—those involved in the offense charged—are\r\n  provable.'&quot; (quoting John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 191\r\n  (4th ed. 1992))).   \r\nMoreover, evidence of the\r\n  victim's alcoholism is not admissible under Rule 608(a), SCRE, because it is\r\n  not evidence of her character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.   See Rule 608(a), SCRE (&quot;The credibility of a witness may be attacked . . .\r\n  subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for\r\n  truthfulness or untruthfulness.&quot;); see also State v. Aleksey,\r\n  343 S.C. 20, 34, 538 S.E.2d 248, 255 (2000) (&quot;Narcotics offenses are\r\n  generally not considered probative of truthfulness.&quot;).  While evidence of a\r\n  person's intoxication at a specific point in time may be admissible to show\r\n  credibility, evidence that a person is an alcoholic is not.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    C.&nbsp; Cross-Examination on Conflicting Evidence as to the Time of the\r\n      Incident\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found trial\r\n  counsel's performance was deficient because she did not &quot;adequately\r\n  prepare for trial through her failure to call witnesses&quot; whose testimony\r\n  would have shown the victim initially stated she was at the BP station at night\r\n  and then later stated she was there in the afternoon.  The nurse's report\r\n  states that the victim said &quot;on 3/2/02 at approx 7PM, she was at a gas\r\n  station and her car wouldn't start back up.&quot;  The PCR transcript refers to\r\n  a police incident report that says the victim recounted she stopped at the BP station\r\n  &quot;at approximately 8 P.M.&quot;  The videotape from the BP station shows\r\n  the victim was there at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon.  At trial, she\r\n  testified she was at the BP station in the afternoon while it was still light\r\n  outside.  Counsel had both reports in her case file, but did not ask the victim\r\n  about the conflicting times.  The PCR court found counsel should have explored\r\n  the discrepancy to place doubt in the minds of the jury as to whether the\r\n  victim accurately identified Walker.  We uphold the PCR court's finding of\r\n  deficient performance in this respect because there is evidence in the record\r\n  to support the finding.  \r\n\r\n  D.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cumulative Effect of Counsel's Deficient Performance\r\n\r\nWe find two instances of trial\r\n  counsel's deficient performance—her failure to investigate Reed as a potential\r\n  alibi witness and her failure to cross-examine the victim or call witnesses to\r\n  testify about conflicting evidence as to the time of the incident.  To the\r\n  extent the failure to investigate Reed as a potential alibi witness caused some\r\n  prejudice, we have determined the prejudice did not rise to a level warranting\r\n  relief under Strickland.  As to the failure to bring out the victim's\r\n  conflicting statements on the time of the incident, the PCR court found any\r\n  prejudice resulting from that deficiency did not independently warrant relief\r\n  under Strickland.  Even if South Carolina did allow PCR based on the\r\n  cumulative prejudicial effect of two or more instances of deficient\r\n  performance,[7] Walker would still have to demonstrate &quot;a reasonable probability that, but\r\n  for [the cumulation of] counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\n  proceeding would have been different.&quot;  Edwards, 392 S.C. at 459,\r\n  710 S.E.2d at 66 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).  We find he has\r\n  not.  These instances of deficient performance are unrelated to each other and\r\n  neither one makes the other more prejudicial.  Therefore, even if we could\r\n  evaluate them together, there is no cumulative prejudicial effect that would\r\n  warrant relief under Strickland.\r\n\r\n V.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nThe judgment of the PCR\r\n  court granting a new trial is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTHOMAS and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The State also contends the PCR court applied an incorrect standard by\r\n  requiring counsel to articulate a trial strategy for each alleged instance of\r\n  deficient performance.  However, we do not read the PCR court's order to\r\n  include such a requirement.  We read the order as merely noting that trial\r\n  counsel did not articulate a strategy in defense of her performance.  \r\n[2] Walker never personally told trial counsel about Reed.  However, trial counsel\r\n  could not have watched the interview without knowing Reed was a potential alibi\r\n  witness.\r\n[3] See State v. Robbins, 275 S.C. 373, 375, 271 S.E.2d 319, 320\r\n  (1980). \r\n[4] Because Reed's testimony does not meet the legal definition of an alibi, it is\r\n  not necessary to make the second finding.  \r\n[5] &quot;[W]hether the cumulation of several errors, 'which by themselves are not\r\n  prejudicial, would warrant relief is an unsettled question in South\r\n  Carolina.'&quot;  Lorenzen v. State, 376 S.C. 521, 535 n.3, 657 S.E.2d\r\n  771, 779 n.3 (2008) (quoting Green v. State, 351 S.C. 184, 197, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 318, 325 (2002)).  As discussed below, we find it unnecessary to answer\r\n  this question because Walker has failed to prove prejudice under any\r\n  interpretation of the law.\r\n[6] ETOH is an abbreviation for ethanol and refers to alcohol and alcohol abuse. \r\n  Trial counsel knew this.  \r\n[7] See footnote 5.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4947","title":"Ferguson Fire v.

(Ferguson Fire) argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in holding Immedion, LLC (Immedion) was not liable on the\r\n  materialman's lien when Immedion paid its general contractor in full after\r\n  receiving notice from Ferguson Fire.  Ferguson Fire also contends the circuit\r\n  court erred in holding its notice to Immedion was ineffective under South\r\n  Carolina law.  In addition, Ferguson Fire claims the circuit court erred in\r\n  determining South Carolina law does not protect a materialman's lien until\r\n  after the materialman records and serves a statement of the lien.  Finally,\r\n  Ferguson Fire argues the circuit court erred in awarding Immedion attorney's\r\n  fees related to the filing and prosecution of a third-party claim.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe facts in this\r\n  appeal are not in dispute.  Immedion contracted with Rescom, LLC (Rescom) to\r\n  serve as general contractor in performing upfit work to Immedion's data center.  Rescom, in turn, hired Preferred Fire Protection,\r\n  LLC (Preferred Fire) as a subcontractor to perform work in connection with the\r\n  upfit of the property.  In addition, Immedion separately contracted with\r\n  Preferred Fire to install a pre-action fire suppression system in the data\r\n  center for a contract price of $30,973.  Preferred Fire subsequently hired Ferguson\r\n  Fire and Fabrication, Inc. (Ferguson Fire) to provide the materials necessary\r\n  for installation of the pre-action fire suppression system.\r\nBeginning on\r\n  August 24, 2007, and continuing through October 16, 2007, Ferguson Fire\r\n  delivered the materials for the pre-action system.  On September 21, 2007,\r\n  Ferguson Fire sent a &quot;Notice of Furnishing Labor and Materials&quot; (Notice) to Immedion stating Ferguson Fire was employed by\r\n  Preferred Fire and &quot;ha[s] provided or will provide fire\r\n  sprinkler/pipe/valve/fittings with an estimated value of $15,000.&quot;  The Notice did not specify an &quot;amount\r\n  claimed to be due&quot; and did not indicate when it expected delivery of the\r\n  materials to be completed.  Instead, the Notice provided that materials\r\n  &quot;were actually furnished or scheduled to be furnished by [Ferguson Fire]\r\n  to the Project from Sep 10, 2007 [sic] through _______.&quot; The Notice further stated:\r\n\r\n  Please be advised that this company is hereby providing you with\r\n    notice of furnishing labor and materials to the Project described below\r\n    pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-20(B) and § 29-5-40.  It is important to note that this is not a lien.  This is\r\n    a routine procedure to comply with certain state requirements that may exist\r\n    and should not reflect in any way on the integrity or credit standing of\r\n    Preferred Fire Protection . . . . [1]\r\n\r\nOn August 30,\r\n  2007, prior to receiving Ferguson Fire's Notice,\r\n  Immedion issued a check to Preferred Fire for $15,486.50, according to their\r\n  agreement.  After receiving Ferguson Fire's Notice, but\r\n  prior to the date all materials were delivered by Ferguson Fire, Immedion\r\n  issued a second check to Preferred Fire on October 3, 2007, in the amount of\r\n  $14,513.50.  On October 31, 2007, Immedion issued a third and final check to\r\n  Preferred Fire for the remaining contract balance of $973.  Although Immedion\r\n  made full payment to Preferred Fire for the installation of the pre-action\r\n  system, Preferred Fire failed to pay Ferguson Fire $15,548.93 for the materials\r\n  it furnished.\r\nOn January 8,\r\n  2008, Ferguson Fire filed and served a notice of mechanic's lien to Preferred Fire and Immedion.  Ferguson Fire subsequently\r\n  filed a summons and complaint against Preferred Fire and Immedion alleging\r\n  Ferguson Fire provided certain &quot;materials, services, and/or labor to the\r\n  improvements located on the Property pursuant to a binding contract and\r\n  agreement with Preferred Fire and with the knowledge and permission of Immedion\r\n  . . .&quot; and sought to foreclose its mechanic's lien. \r\n  Preferred Fire did not answer Ferguson Fire's complaint,\r\n  and on January 14, 2009, Ferguson Fire obtained a default judgment against\r\n  Preferred Fire that it has been unable to collect.  Immedion answered,\r\n  asserting Ferguson Fire's complaint should be dismissed because\r\n  Immedion paid Preferred Fire all sums due to Preferred Fire on the contract prior\r\n  to receiving Ferguson Fire's Notice.  In addition, Immedion filed a\r\n  third-party complaint against Rescom for breach of contract and attorney's fees.  Immedion and Rescom subsequently settled the third- party\r\n  claims and dismissed that action on July 20, 2009.\r\n In the\r\n  present action, Immedion filed a motion for summary judgment, contending it\r\n  paid in full all work performed by its contractors.  Ferguson Fire filed a\r\n  cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing Immedion should have been on notice\r\n  of its claim because Ferguson Fire provided Immedion the Notice prior to\r\n  Immedion's full payment to Preferred Fire.  The circuit\r\n  court issued an order granting Immedion's motion for\r\n  summary judgment, holding the Notice that Ferguson Fire provided was\r\n  ineffective under section 29-5-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) as a\r\n  notice of lien.  The circuit court's order also\r\n  awarded Immedion attorney's fees for successfully defending against\r\n  the mechanic's lien.  This appeal followed.  &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is proper\r\n  when no genuine issue of material fact exists, and the moving party is entitled\r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v.\r\n    Dorchester Cnty., 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).  When\r\n  plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot\r\n  differ, summary judgment should be granted.  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C.\r\n  509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\n\r\n  When reviewing the grant of\r\n    summary judgment, this court applies the same standard that governs the circuit\r\n    court under Rule 56, SCRCP.  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entm't, Inc., 363\r\n    S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005) (internal citations omitted).  &quot;On\r\n    appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the\r\n    evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;  Id. at 536, 611 S.E.2d at 925.\r\n\r\nIn addition,\r\n  &quot;the award of attorney's fees is left undisturbed absent abuse of the\r\n  [circuit] court's discretion.&quot;  Taylor, Cotton, &amp; Ridley, Inc. v.\r\n    Okatie Hotel Group, LLC, 372 S.C. 89, 100, 641 S.E.2d 459, 464 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (internal citation omitted). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Ferguson Fire's Notice[2]\r\nFerguson Fire asserts the\r\n  circuit court erred in holding its Notice\r\n  was ineffective as a notice of lien under section 29-5-40.  We disagree. \r\n&quot;A person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or\r\n  furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection,\r\n  alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real estate, by virtue of\r\n  an agreement with or with the consent of the owner or his agent, shall have a\r\n  mechanic's lien upon the real property to secure payment of the debt.&quot;  See S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-10(a) (Supp. 2011).  &quot;The right to a lien arises,\r\n  inchoate, when labor is performed or material furnished.&quot;  Preferred\r\n    Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, Inc. v. Royal Garden Resort, Inc., 301 S.C. 1, 3,\r\n  389 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1990) (emphasis added); see also Wood v. Hardy,\r\n  235 S.C. 131, 138, 110 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1959); Williamson v. Hotel Melrose,\r\n  110 S.C. 1, 30, 96 S.E. 407, 409 (1918).  When the person claiming the lien was\r\n  employed by someone other than the owner, he must notify the owner of the\r\n  furnishing of labor or material in order for the lien to attach to the\r\n  property.  S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-40 (Supp. 2011). \r\nA\r\n  mechanic's lien is purely statutory.  Therefore, the requirements of the\r\n  statute must be strictly followed.  See Shelley Constr. Co. v. Sea\r\n    Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 27, 336 S.E.2d 488, 490 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding\r\n  mechanic's liens are purely statutory and issues concerning them must be\r\n  decided in accordance with the terms of the statute).  Section 29-5-40 allows a\r\n  subcontractor or supplier to place an owner on notice of a lien as provided by\r\n  section 29-5-20(a) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).[3] \r\n  Section 29-5-40 provides, in pertinent part:\r\nWhenever\r\n  work is done or material is furnished for the improvement of real estate upon the employment of a contractor or some\r\n  other person than the owner and such . . . materialman shall in writing notify\r\n    the owner of the furnishing of such labor or material and the amount or value\r\n    thereof, the lien given by § 29-5-20 shall attach upon the real estate\r\n  improved as against the true owner for the amount of the work done or material\r\n  furnished.  But in no event shall the aggregate amount of liens set up hereby exceed\r\n  the amount due by the owner on the contract price of the improvement made. \r\n(emphasis added).  According\r\n  to the plain language of the statute, a lien attaches to the real estate\r\n  against the owner of the real estate for the value of the material furnished. \r\n  The lien must be for &quot;the amount of the work done or material\r\n  furnished&quot; and the materialman must notify the owner in writing of the\r\n  same.  § 29-5-40.  Therefore, no lien attaches until the materials, which are\r\n  the subject of the lien, have been delivered, and the written notice, including\r\n  the value of those materials, is provided to the owner.\r\nFerguson Fire's Notice is insufficient\r\n  under the statute, and has no legal effect.  The September 21, 2007 Notice\r\n  stated that Ferguson Fire would be supplying materials beginning September 10,\r\n  2007, but the Notice never provided a project completion date.  Ferguson Fire's\r\n  final delivery of materials to Preferred Fire was on October 16, 2007, yet it\r\n  failed to provide notice after this date to Immedion that the material was\r\n  furnished and its job was completed.  In addition, the Notice listed an\r\n  approximate value of the materials it planned to deliver, but the Notice contained\r\n  no indication that any payment was due at the time.  Accordingly, Ferguson Fire\r\n  failed to follow the requirements of the statute because all of the materials\r\n  had not been furnished, and it did not identify the final amount of the supplies\r\n  yet to be delivered when it notified Immedion.  See § 29-5-40 (&quot;Whenever\r\n    work is done or material is furnished . . . [the] materialman shall in\r\n  writing notify the owner of the furnishing of such labor or material and the\r\n    amount or value thereof . . . .&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\nIn addition to failing to\r\n  effectively notify Immedion pursuant to section 29-5-40, our jurisprudence also\r\n  provides that no lien attaches to the property until notice of an actual demand\r\n  for payment is made to the owner.  See Sloan Constr. Co., v. Southco\r\n    Grassing, Inc., 377 S.C. 108, 121, 659 S.E.2d 158, 165 (2008) (&quot;[T]he\r\n  owner's liability is limited to the remaining unpaid balance on the contract\r\n  with the general contractor at the time the owner receives notice from the\r\n    subcontractor of the general contractor's nonpayment.&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added).  It is axiomatic that compliance with the notice provision of section\r\n  29-5-40, including a demand for payment, would be a prerequisite to recovery.  Because\r\n  Ferguson Fire's Notice was sent prior to furnishing all the material, failed to\r\n  identify the final amount of the goods delivered, and never made a demand for\r\n  payment, we find the notice was inadequate. \r\nFerguson Fire argues that our\r\n  court's opinion in Stoudenmire Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Co. v. Craig\r\n    Bldg. P'ship, 308 S.C. 298, 417 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1992), controls this\r\n  case.  In Stoudenmire, we reversed a master's finding that Stoudenmire's\r\n  notice of mechanic's lien was filed after the owner exceeded the amount due on\r\n  the contract price.  Id. at 302, 417 S.E.2d at 637.  Our court found\r\n  that a letter Stoudenmire wrote to the owner &quot;provide[d] sufficient\r\n  written notice to the owner to meet the requirements of § 29-5-40.&quot;  Id. (citing Lowndes Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229 S.C.\r\n  619, 635, 93 S.E.2d 855, 863 (1956) (stating the statute does not prescribe the form of the notice)). \r\nWhile we agree the statute\r\n  does not prescribe the specific format of the notice, we find Stoudenmire distinguishable from the instant case.  The letter that provided notice to the\r\n  owner in Stoudenmire was sent after Stoudenmire's work on the project\r\n    was complete, and it advised the owner that Stoudenmire had not been paid\r\n  by the general contractor.  Id. at 300, 417 S.E.2d at 636.  Moreover,\r\n  Stoudenmire demanded payment from the owner for its work on the\r\n  project.  Id.  Here, on the other hand, Ferguson Fire's Notice was sent\r\n  before it had completed the delivery of materials for the project and before\r\n  any payment was due by Preferred Fire or Immedion.  Although section 29-5-40\r\n  does not contain a time limit for providing written notice to the owner, it is\r\n  impossible for a notice of a lien to precede the actual performance of work that\r\n  creates the lien.  See § 29-5-40 (stating the lien attaches only after\r\n  &quot;work is performed or material is furnished&quot;); cf. Wood,\r\n  235 S.C. at 138, 110 S.E.2d at 160 (holding although notice may be given at any\r\n  time, it will be ineffective if the other prerequisites to the perfection and\r\n  enforcement of the lien are not met).  In addition, Ferguson Fire's Notice did\r\n  not include a demand for payment.  See Sloan Constr. Co., 377\r\n  S.C. at 121, 659 S.E.2d at 165.  Accordingly, Ferguson Fire's reliance on Stoudenmire is misguided, and the circuit court did not err in finding the Notice was\r\n  insufficient to notify Immedion of a lien.\r\nFerguson Fire also places\r\n  great weight on Lowndes Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229\r\n  S.C. 619, 635, 93 S.E.2d 855, 863 (1956), arguing our supreme court held a materialman\r\n  can provide a notice of furnishing material to an owner at anytime—even prior\r\n  to completing the task.  Such a reading misconstrues the holding in Lowndes.  \r\nLowndes, the owner of the\r\n  property, entered into a contract with Builders Lumber Company (Builders) for\r\n  the construction of a building.  Id. at 623, 93 S.E.2d at 856. \r\n  Greenville Concrete Company (Greenville Concrete) furnished supplies to\r\n  Builders between May 11 and August 12, 1953, and Builders failed to pay\r\n  Greenville Concrete $2,800.46 for the materials utilized in the erection of the\r\n  building.  Id. at 623, 93 S.E.2d at 857.  After all the material was\r\n  furnished and the work was completed, Greenville Concrete filed a mechanic's\r\n  lien on October 9, 1953, and served Lowndes the same day.  Id.  Several\r\n  months later, Greenville Concrete sought to foreclose their mechanic's lien and\r\n  served the petition upon Lowndes on January 28, 1954.  Id.  The master\r\n  held, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  [S]uch\r\n    service did not comply with the requirement of Section 45-254[4] as to notice to the owner, for the reason that Section 45-259[5] relates only to the dissolution of the lien obtained under Section 45-254, to\r\n    which lien the notice under Section 45-254 is a condition precedent, and\r\n    consequently, since the notice required by Section 45-254 had not been given\r\n    prior to the recording and service of the certificate, no lien had ever been\r\n    obtained.\r\n\r\nId. at 628-29, 93 S.E.2d at 859.  Upon review from the\r\n  circuit court, our supreme court concluded this finding was erroneous and stated\r\n  the requirement that the materialman provide notice twice was simply that—needless\r\n  duplication.  Id. at 630, 93 S.E.2d at 860.  In so holding, our supreme\r\n  court stated: \r\n\r\n  Section\r\n    45-254 specifies no time at which or within which notice of the furnishing of\r\n    material is to be given to the owner.  [Because a] delay in giving the notice\r\n    cannot operate to the detriment of the owner, [the owner's] liability under the\r\n    lien is limited to the balance due by [the owner] to the prime contractor at\r\n    the time [the owner] receives the notice.   \r\n\r\nId. at 629-30, 93 S.E.2d at 860.  Because Greenville\r\n  Concrete complied with the requirements of the statute by delivering all of the\r\n  materials, detailing a specific amount for those materials, and subsequently\r\n  sending notice, it was irrelevant that Greenville Concrete notified Lowndes in\r\n  the process of perfecting its lien as Lowndes's liability was limited to the\r\n  balance due at the time it received notice.  Id. at 636, 93 S.E.2d at\r\n  863.  Thus, the holding in Lowndes stands only for the proposition that\r\n  notice can be sent anytime after a lienor completely furnishes the material.  Accordingly,\r\n  Ferguson Fire's reliance on Lowndes is misplaced, and the circuit court\r\n  did not err in finding the Notice was insufficient to notify Immedion of a lien.\r\nIn light of our determination\r\n  that the circuit court properly found Ferguson Fire's Notice was insufficient\r\n  to notify Immedion of a lien, we need not reach Ferguson Fire's issue relating\r\n  to the lienor's preference under section 29-5-50 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2007).  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review\r\n  remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\n  appeal). \r\nII.&nbsp;Attorney's Fees\r\nFerguson Fire next argues\r\n  that, even if Immedion was entitled to summary judgment, the circuit court\r\n  abused its discretion in granting attorney's fees relating to Immedion's filing\r\n  and prosecution of a third-party claim.  We disagree. \r\nSection 29-5-20(A) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) provides that &quot;[i]f the party defending\r\n  against the lien prevails, the defending party must be awarded costs of the\r\n  action and a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court.&quot;  In\r\n  addition, the amount of attorney's fees that should be awarded under the\r\n  mechanic's lien statute is within the sound discretion of the circuit court.  D.A.\r\n    Davis Constr. Co. v. Palmetto Props., Inc., 281 S.C. 415, 419, 315 S.E.2d\r\n  370, 372 (1984).  The circuit court's decision regarding such a matter will not\r\n  be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.  Id.  An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when, inter alia, the circuit court's ruling is based upon an\r\n  error of law.  Bayle v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 128, 542 S.E.2d 736, 742 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIn Jackson v. Speed, 326\r\n  S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997), our supreme court held the following six\r\n  factors should be considered when determining reasonable attorney's fees: &quot;(1)\r\n  the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily\r\n  devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of\r\n  compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for\r\n  similar services.&quot;  Id. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760 (internal citations\r\n  omitted).  &quot;[O]n appeal, an award for\r\n  attorney's fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record\r\n  supports each factor.&quot;  Id.\r\nIn the instant case, the\r\n  circuit court considered each of the requisite factors, and the record supports\r\n  the circuit court's finding.  Initially, we note the circuit court reviewed\r\n  detailed affidavits of Immedion's counsel outlining their respective experience\r\n  and qualifications, and counsel provided a chart itemizing the time and\r\n  expenses incurred in defense of Immedion.  In addition, the circuit court conducted\r\n  a separate hearing and considered the testimony of Immedion's counsel regarding\r\n  expenses incurred in connection with Immedion's third-party complaint against\r\n  Rescom.  At the hearing, Immedion's counsel testified that he only submitted a\r\n  request for fees which were necessitated by Ferguson Fire's filing of the\r\n  mechanic's lien and he severed out &quot;anything having to do with the kind of\r\n  negotiation and the pre-agreement work&quot; that was involved in Rescom's\r\n  defense of the third-party complaint to prevent any duplication of fees.  We\r\n  agree with the circuit court's determination the attorney's fees incurred were\r\n  reasonable in light of the nature of the work performed, particularly when\r\n  counsel was required to research and address novel legal issues with regard to\r\n  the mechanic's lien.  Moreover, Immedion obtained a beneficial result when the\r\n  circuit court granted summary judgment and dissolved the lien.  Finally, we\r\n  find the fee and the court costs did not exceed the amount of the lien as\r\n  required by the statute.  See § 29-5-20(A).  We therefore find the\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Immedion attorney's fees\r\n  and costs in the amount of $14,472.55.   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit\r\n  court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both parties concede the Notice gives Ferguson Fire\r\n  no rights under section 29-5-20(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011). \r\n[2] We combine Ferguson Fire's first and second arguments. \r\n[3] Section 29-5-20(a) provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  Every\r\n    laborer, mechanic, subcontractor, or person furnishing material for the\r\n    improvement of real estate when the improvement has been authorized by the\r\n    owner has a lien thereon, subject to existing liens of which he has actual or\r\n    constructive notice, to the value of the labor or material so furnished,\r\n    including the costs of the action and a reasonable attorney's fee which must be\r\n    determined by the court in which the action is brought but only if the party\r\n    seeking to enforce the lien prevails.   \r\n\r\n[4] Section 45-254 is the precursor to section 29-5-40 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010), and the statutory sections are substantially\r\n  identical.\r\n[5] Section 45-259 is the precursor to section 29-5-90 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010), and the statutory sections are\r\n  substantially identical.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4948","title":"Hennes v.

Kern-Fuller, of Easley, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Ralph L. Gleaton, II, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:  This appeal stems from a previously-litigated\r\n  dispute between two upstate realtors over the sale and commission of a parcel\r\n  of real estate on Lake Keowee.  John Shaw (Mr. Shaw) claims the circuit court\r\n  committed reversible error when it denied his motion for directed verdict on\r\n  Adrienne Hennes' (Ms. Hennes) claim for breach of contract and when it granted Ms.\r\n  Hennes' motion for directed verdict on Mr. Shaw's claim for violation of the\r\n  South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA).  Mr. Shaw also contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in excluding evidence of attorney's fees he incurred from the\r\n  prior related litigation with Ms. Hennes.  He argues the fees were an element\r\n  of damages in his tortious interference with a contract claim against Ms.\r\n  Hennes in the current litigation.  Finally, Mr. Shaw claims the circuit court erred\r\n  when it sua sponte charged the jury on conversion.  We affirm in part, reverse\r\n  in part, and remand in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nMs. Hennes and Mr.\r\n  Shaw are licensed realtors in the upstate of South Carolina.  The parties first\r\n  met in April 2005 and decided to co-list approximately nine or ten real estate properties\r\n  in both the commercial and residential sectors.  According to Mr. Shaw, the\r\n  parties' relationship began to deteriorate at the end of 2005 when Ms. Hennes\r\n  systematically replaced his contracts on properties with those of her own,\r\n  specifically a contract for the purchase of a piece of property on Lake Keowee\r\n  (the Pelfrey Property).  The owners of the Pelfrey Property brought a\r\n  declaratory judgment action to determine whether Mr. Shaw's or Ms. Hennes'\r\n  contract was the superior contract for purposes of purchasing the owners' property. \r\n  After a bench trial, the master-in-equity issued an order dated March 7, 2007,\r\n  in which it held that Mr. Shaw had a fully enforceable contract to purchase the\r\n  Pelfrey Property for $460,000.  \r\nSubsequent to Mr.\r\n  Shaw's purchase of the Pelfrey Property, Ms. Hennes filed suit against Mr. Shaw\r\n  in circuit court alleging Mr. Shaw breached a loan agreement between the\r\n  parties and owed Ms. Hennes $27,662.15.  In response, Mr. Shaw answered\r\n  and counterclaimed against Ms. Hennes, asserting claims for tortious\r\n  interference with contract, violation of the UTPA, fraud, conspiracy, and breach\r\n  of fiduciary duty.  During trial, Ms. Hennes claimed she issued three checks to\r\n  Mr. Shaw in the amounts of $20,000, $3,800, and $3,862.15 in anticipation of\r\n  them &quot;working together to expand real estate.&quot;  To the\r\n  contrary, Mr. Shaw testified Ms. Hennes endorsed three checks in those amounts\r\n  to him as a partial advance for commissions on properties they had co-listed.  Once\r\n  their relationship began to deteriorate, Ms. Hennes testified she requested Mr.\r\n  Shaw return the money she gave to him for &quot;the expansion of real estate&quot;\r\n  because the money was not a gift.  Despite these requests, Ms. Hennes claimed Mr.\r\n  Shaw refused to return the money, which prompted the present suit.  In\r\n  contrast, Mr. Shaw claimed he was entitled to keep these monies because Ms.\r\n  Hennes and her realty company solely received the remainder of the commissions\r\n  on several of the properties they co-listed.  \r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of Mr. Shaw's case, the court directed a verdict in favor of Ms. Hennes on Mr.\r\n  Shaw's claims for unfair trade practices and fraud.  Mr. Shaw conceded his\r\n  breach of contract claim against Ms. Hennes, but Ms. Hennes maintained her sole\r\n  claim for breach of contract against Mr. Shaw.  Mr. Shaw's remaining claims for\r\n  tortious interference with contract, conspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty\r\n  went to the jury.  At the conclusion of closing arguments, the court charged\r\n  the jury on conversion, tortious interference with contract, conspiracy, and\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty.  The circuit court, however, failed to charge breach\r\n  of contract to the jury.  \r\nThe jury charge on\r\n  conversion, which is before this court on appeal, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Now,\r\n    the plaintiff alleges that defendant assumed and exercised an unauthorized\r\n    right of ownership or dominion over personal property belonging to the\r\n    plaintiff to the exclusion of the owner's rights.  This may arise by some\r\n    illegal use or misuse or by illegal detention of another's personal property. \r\n    It is a wrongful act which may arise from either a wrongful taking or a\r\n    wrongful detention.  It cannot arise from the defendant's exercise of a\r\n    legal right over property.  Any act of the defendant inconsistent with the\r\n    plaintiff's right of possession or subversive of her right to the property is\r\n    conversion.  The gist of conversion is the interference with control of the\r\n    property.  To recover in an action for conversion, the plaintiff must prove by\r\n    the preponderance or greater weight of the evidence an interest by the\r\n    plaintiff in the thing converted, the defendant converted the property to his\r\n    own use and that the use was without the plaintiff's permission.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the\r\n  jury exited the courtroom, Mr. Shaw objected to the jury charge on conversion\r\n  on two grounds, stating, &quot;[Ms. Hennes] never moved to amend under Rule\r\n  15(b) to add conversion.  Their cause of action was breach of contract.  I\r\n  never hear [sic] the court instruct the jury that . . . [Ms. Hennes] must show\r\n  that [Mr. Shaw] did this without [Ms. Hennes'] permission . . . .&quot;  The\r\n  circuit court overruled Mr. Shaw's objection and stated, \r\n\r\n  I think that I did charge without permission, wrongful detention. \r\n    It's noted.  I looked very carefully [at] plaintiff's claim or cause of action,\r\n    and although it uses the word &quot;loan agreement,&quot; he does not allege a\r\n    contract that was given according to a contract [sic].  And the law of\r\n    conversion really is nothing more than the wrongful detention of someone else's\r\n    property when requested that it be returned.  So I note your objection and\r\n    request and I deny it for the record.\r\n\r\nThe jury\r\n  subsequently returned a verdict for Ms. Hennes in the amount of $27,662.15 and\r\n  a verdict for Mr. Shaw in the amount of $8,750.[1] \r\n  Mr. Shaw moved for additur to his verdict based on the attorney's fees incurred\r\n  in litigating his claim against Ms. Hennes in the previous action.  Mr.\r\n  Shaw also moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the conversion\r\n  claim.  The court permitted ten days for the filing of post-trial motions.  On\r\n  December 12, 2008, the circuit court formally denied Mr. Shaw's motion for JNOV\r\n  and new trial nisi additur as well as Ms. Hennes' motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nWhen reviewing a motion for\r\n  directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard as the circuit court.  Elam v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004).  Accordingly, &quot;[i]n\r\n  deciding a motion for directed verdict, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;  Minter v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 527, 473 S.E.2d 67, 69 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).  &quot;If more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, the\r\n  case must be submitted to the jury.&quot;  Id.  Moreover, in reviewing a\r\n  circuit court's grant or denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, this\r\n  court reverses only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the\r\n  ruling is governed by an error of law.  Austin v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp.,\r\n  387 S.C. 22, 42, 691 S.E.2d 135, 145 (2010) (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Breach of Contract\r\n\r\nFirst, Mr. Shaw claims the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying his directed verdict motion on Ms. Hennes'\r\n  breach of contract claim.  We disagree.\r\nThe necessary elements of a\r\n  contract are offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.  Sauner v. Pub.\r\n    Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).  Valuable consideration may consist of &quot;some right,\r\n  interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance,\r\n  detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.&quot;\r\n   Prestwick Golf Club, Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. P'ship, 331 S.C. 385, 389,\r\n  503 S.E.2d 184, 186 (Ct. App. 1998).  With certain exceptions, a contract need\r\n  not be in writing to be enforceable.  Gaskins v. Firemen's Ins. Co. of Newark, N.J., 206 S.C. 213, 216, 33 S.E.2d 498, 499 (1945) (noting that if there is a meeting of the\r\n  minds with regard to the essential elements of a contract, it is immaterial\r\n  whether the contract is written or oral).  To\r\n  recover for a breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove: (1) a binding\r\n  contract; (2) a breach of contract; and (3) damages proximately resulting from\r\n  the breach.  Fuller v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124\r\n  S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).\r\nViewing the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to Ms. Hennes, we find conflicting evidence exists on\r\n  whether a contract was formed, and thus, the circuit court properly denied Mr.\r\n  Shaw's motion for a directed verdict on Ms. Hennes' breach of contract claim.  Mr.\r\n  Shaw maintained the parties did not have a &quot;loan agreement,&quot; and Ms.\r\n  Hennes was not entitled to a return of the money because the checks, which Mr.\r\n  Shaw deposited into his business banking account, were an advance for\r\n  commissions on the nine or ten properties they co-listed together.  Despite the\r\n  absence of a written contract, both parties' testimony indicates the checks\r\n  were not a gift, but rather were given to Mr. Shaw as part of their agreement to\r\n  buy and sell real estate together.  We find the checks constituted valuable\r\n  consideration in that they created a benefit to Mr. Shaw and a detriment to Ms.\r\n  Hennes.  See Shayne of Miami, Inc. v. Greybow, Inc., 232 S.C.\r\n  161, 167, 101 S.E.2d 486, 489 (1957) (&quot;[A] benefit to the promisor or a\r\n  detriment to the promisee is sufficient consideration for a contract.&quot;).  Because\r\n  the evidence as to the existence of an oral contract conflicted, we find the\r\n  circuit court properly denied Mr. Shaw's directed verdict motion.  See Hendricks\r\n    v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 459, 578 S.E.2d 711, 716 (2003) (holding\r\n  that if the evidence as to the existence of a contract is conflicting or raises\r\n  more than one reasonable inference, the issue should be submitted to the jury).  \r\n\r\n  2. The UTPA\r\n\r\nNext, Mr. Shaw claims the\r\n  circuit court erred in directing a verdict on his unfair trade practices cause\r\n  of action based on the regulated industries exemption in the UTPA.  In\r\n  response, Ms. Hennes claims that even if the circuit court erred in relying on\r\n  this exemption, Mr. Shaw failed to demonstrate Ms. Hennes' actions adversely\r\n  affected the public interest.  We agree with Ms. Hennes.\r\nAn action for damages may be\r\n  brought under the UTPA for &quot;unfair methods of competition and unfair or\r\n  deceptive acts or practices&quot; in the conduct of trade or commerce.  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 39-5-20(a) (Supp. 2010).  A party's ability to bring suit under the UTPA\r\n  is limited, however, by section 39-5-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2010).  Subsection (a) provides the UTPA does not apply to &quot;[a]ctions or\r\n  transactions permitted under laws administered by any regulatory body or\r\n  officer acting under statutory authority of this State or the United States or\r\n  actions or transactions permitted by any other South Carolina state law.&quot; \r\n  § 39-5-40(a).    \r\nThe supreme court expounded\r\n  on the breadth of subsection (a) in the case of Ward v. Dick Dyer &amp; Assoc., Inc., 304 S.C. 152, 403 S.E.2d 310 (1991).  In Ward, the\r\n  supreme court determined whether buyers could bring an unfair trade practice\r\n  claim against a car dealership for its alleged failure to disclose to the\r\n  buyers that the car they purchased had been previously involved in an\r\n  accident.  Id. at 153-54, 403 S.E.2d at 311.  In finding the buyers\r\n  could bring an action against the car dealership, despite its regulation by a\r\n  South Carolina regulatory agency, the court held &quot;the exemption is\r\n  intended to exclude those actions or transactions which are allowed or\r\n    authorized by regulatory agencies or other statutes.&quot;  Id. at\r\n  155, 403 S.E.2d at 312 (emphasis added).  Finding the reasoning persuasive and\r\n  applicable to our statutory exemption, the supreme court cited language from Skinner\r\n    v. Steele, 730 S.W.2d 335, 337 (Tenn. App. 1987):\r\n\r\n  The purpose of the exemption is to insure that a business is not\r\n    subjected to a lawsuit under the [UTPA] when it does something required by law,\r\n    or does something that would otherwise be a violation of the [UTPA], but which\r\n    is allowed under other statutes or regulations. It is intended to avoid\r\n    conflict between laws, not to exclude from the [UTPA]'s coverage every activity\r\n    that is authorized or regulated by another statute or agency. \r\n\r\nId. at 156, 403 S.E.2d at 312.\r\nIn support of Mr. Shaw's\r\n  claim that Ms. Hennes violated the UTPA, he produced evidence that Ms. Hennes\r\n  repeatedly replaced his contracts with her own contracts and excluded him from\r\n  commissions to which he otherwise would have been entitled.  At the close of\r\n  evidence, the circuit court granted Ms. Hennes' motion for a directed\r\n  verdict on Mr. Shaw's unfair trade practices claim.  The majority of the\r\n  colloquy between the parties and the circuit court regarding this particular\r\n  ruling was omitted in the record on appeal, but the circuit court cited Scott\r\n    v. Mid Carolina Homes, Inc., 293 S.C. 191, 359 S.E.2d 291 (Ct. App. 1987), in\r\n  support of its decision.[2] \r\n  While the circuit court acknowledged Scott had been overruled, it\r\n  concluded it was &quot;still good law as far as where the individual is a\r\n  licensed realtor, and their action is premised on that.&quot;  Although Ms. Hennes\r\n  states in her brief that &quot;cooperation with other real estate professionals\r\n  and sub agency is permitted&quot; under section 40-57-137 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2011), she fails to specifically argue how the Department of Labor,\r\n  Licensing, and Regulation specifically allowed or authorized her actions. Accordingly,\r\n  we find the circuit court improperly relied on Scott, and furthermore,\r\n  we find the regulated industries exemption from section 39-5-40(a) is\r\n  inapplicable.  \r\nDespite the circuit court's\r\n  error in relying on the regulated industries exemption, Mr. Shaw failed to\r\n  present any evidence that Ms. Hennes' actions caused public harm, which is\r\n  required for a viable claim under the UTPA.  See Columbia E. Assoc.\r\n    v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 299 S.C. 515, 522, 386 S.E.2d 259, 263 (Ct. App. 1989) (&quot;To\r\n  be actionable under the [UTPA], an unfair or deceptive act or practice must\r\n  have an impact upon the public interest.  The [UTPA] is not available to\r\n  redress a private wrong when the public interest is unaffected.&quot;).  The\r\n  record on appeal fails to show Mr. Shaw introduced any evidence prior to Ms.\r\n  Hennes' directed verdict motion to prove that her actions impacted the public\r\n  interest.  Furthermore, as the appellant, Mr. Shaw has the burden to include\r\n  evidence in the record on appeal to support his claim.  See Bonaparte\r\n    v. Floyd, 291 S.C. 427, 444, 354 S.E.2d 40, 50 (Ct. App. 1987) (declining\r\n  to address appellant's claim of error because appellant failed to furnish this\r\n  court with a sufficient record on appeal to permit consideration of the issue). \r\n  Without the inclusion of the circuit court's complete ruling on this issue or\r\n  any testimony or evidence from trial to show Ms. Hennes' conduct was actionable\r\n  under the UTPA, we decline to reverse the circuit court's ruling on this issue.\r\n   See Sweatt v. Norman, 283 S.C. 443, 448, 322 S.E.2d 478, 481\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (finding defendant, as appealing party, has the burden of\r\n  furnishing a sufficient record from which this court can make an intelligent\r\n  review).  Thus, we affirm the circuit court's decision to grant a directed\r\n  verdict on the UTPA cause of action.  \r\nII.&nbsp;Jury Charge on Conversion\r\nMr. Shaw contends the circuit\r\n  court committed reversible error when it sua sponte charged the jury on\r\n  conversion.  In response, Ms. Hennes contends this issue is not preserved\r\n  because Mr. Shaw failed to request a continuance after the charge as required\r\n  by Rule 15(b), SCRCP.  We agree with Mr. Shaw.\r\nIn reviewing an alleged error\r\n  in jury instructions, we are mindful that an appellate court will not reverse\r\n  the circuit court's decision absent an abuse of discretion.  See Cole\r\n    v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008) (applying an abuse of\r\n  discretion standard of review to an alleged error in jury instructions).  In\r\n  reviewing jury charges for error, the appellate court must consider the circuit\r\n  court's jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at\r\n  trial.  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000).  If the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions that\r\n  might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.  Keaton ex rel.\r\n    Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575\r\n  (1999). \r\nMr. Shaw's claim of error\r\n  stems from the circuit court's jury charge on conversion.  &quot;Conversion is\r\n  the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods\r\n  or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of the condition\r\n  or the exclusion of the owner's rights.&quot;  Regions Bank v. Schmauch,\r\n  354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003) (internal citation\r\n  omitted).  To establish the tort of conversion, the plaintiff must establish\r\n  either title to or right to the possession of the personal property.  Id.\r\nAlthough Ms. Hennes contends\r\n  Mr. Shaw did not properly preserve this issue for appeal because Mr. Shaw\r\n  failed to request a continuance under Rule 15(b), we find Rule 15(b) does not\r\n  apply in this instance.[3] \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 15(b), SCRCP,\r\n\r\n  When\r\n    issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of\r\n    the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised\r\n    in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings . . . may be made upon motion\r\n    of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not\r\n    affect the result of the trial of these issues. . . . [T]he court may allow the\r\n    pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the\r\n    merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to\r\n    satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in\r\n    maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. The court shall upon motion\r\n    grant a continuance reasonably necessary to enable the objecting party to meet\r\n    such evidence.\r\n\r\nFirst, the record does not\r\n  reflect the parties expressly consented to try the issue of conversion.  See Rule 15(b), SCRCP (stating issues impliedly or expressly tried by consent are\r\n  treated as if raised in the pleadings).  Second, Mr. Shaw's objection after the\r\n  circuit court charged the jury on conversion demonstrates there was no implied\r\n  consent to try this cause of action.  See Dunbar v. Carlson, 341\r\n  S.C. 261, 267, 533 S.E.2d 913, 917 (Ct. App. 2000)(internal citation and emphasis omitted) (&quot;[T]his\r\n  Court will not find implied consent to try an issue if all of the parties did\r\n  not recognize it as an issue during trial, even though there is evidence in the\r\n  record - introduced as relevant to some other issue - which would support the\r\n  amendment.&quot;).  Third, Ms. Hennes did not make a motion to amend the\r\n  pleadings during the trial or even after judgment, despite Mr. Shaw's objection\r\n  to the jury charge.  See Rule 15(b), SCRCP (&quot;Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to\r\n  cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made\r\n  upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment[.]&quot;).  Thus,\r\n  this argument has no merit.  \r\nIn the alternative, Ms.\r\n  Hennes argues Mr. Shaw was not prejudiced because Mr. Shaw was on notice of a\r\n  cause of action for conversion based on the language of the complaint.  We disagree.\r\n In Ms. Hennes' one-page complaint,\r\n  she alleged the following: Ms. Hennes loaned Mr. Shaw $27,622.15; Ms. Hennes\r\n  demanded payment; Mr. Shaw failed to make payment; and his actions were in\r\n  breach of their loan agreement, which entitled her to damages for Mr. Shaw's &quot;breach\r\n  of the contract.&quot;  We find the language in the complaint does not\r\n  sufficiently place Mr. Shaw on notice of a claim for conversion as it\r\n  specifically categorized the action as a &quot;breach of contract.&quot; While\r\n  a conversion action may lie when the plaintiff shows unauthorized detention of\r\n  property, after demand, we find the complaint failed to sufficiently flesh out\r\n  the requisite facts to support a conversion claim.  See Mackela v.\r\n    Bentley, 365 S.C. 44, 48, 614 S.E.2d 648, 650 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;A\r\n  plaintiff claiming conversion may prevail based upon a showing of unauthorized\r\n  detention of property, after demand.&quot;).  Further, during trial and closing\r\n  arguments, both parties only discussed Ms. Hennes' claim against Mr. Shaw in\r\n  the context of breach of contract.  Moreover, the circuit court charged\r\n  conversion without notifying the parties that it would issue this charge,\r\n  despite Mr. Shaw's request to review the charges.[4]  \r\nIn conclusion, the circuit\r\n  court's sua sponte jury charge prejudiced Mr. Shaw because he was deprived\r\n  of the opportunity to prepare for the issue of conversion and to raise the\r\n  appropriate affirmative defenses at trial.  See Armstrong v. Collins,\r\n  366 S.C. 204, 230, 621 S.E.2d 368, 381 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;In considering\r\n  potential prejudice, the court should consider whether the opposing party has\r\n  had the opportunity to prepare for the issue now being formally raised.&quot;).\r\n   Because this was Ms. Hennes' only cause of action against Mr. Shaw, and the\r\n  jury returned a verdict against Mr. Shaw, the jury undoubtedly was influenced\r\n  by this flawed jury instruction.  See Ellison v. Simmons,\r\n  238 S.C. 364, 372, 120 S.E.2d 209, 213 (1961) (finding an erroneous jury instruction\r\n  is not grounds for reversal unless the appellant can show prejudice from the\r\n  erroneous instruction).  Accordingly, we reverse and remand.[5]  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  decision to grant Ms. Hennes' motion for a directed verdict on Mr. Shaw's UTPA\r\n  cause of action.  We affirm the circuit court's decision to deny Mr. Shaw's\r\n  motion for a directed verdict on Ms. Hennes' breach of contract cause of\r\n  action.  However, the circuit court erred in sua sponte charging the jury on\r\n  conversion.  Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial on the remaining\r\n  causes of action: breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, conspiracy, and breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty.\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The $8,750 figure represented half the commission for\r\n  the sale of two properties co-listed by Ms.\r\n  Hennes and Mr. Shaw.\r\n[2] In Scott, the court of appeals held that the\r\n  regulation of a mobile home seller by the manufactured housing board exempted\r\n  the seller from liability under the UTPA.  Id. at 201, 359 S.E.2d at\r\n  297.  This holding was later overruled in Ward v. Dick Dyer &amp; Assoc.,\r\n    Inc., 304 S.C. 152, 403 S.E.2d 310 (1991).\r\n[3] Ms. Hennes also makes a cursory assertion that Mr.\r\n  Shaw failed to timely object to the circuit court's jury charge. We disagree\r\n  and find that Mr. Shaw's counsel timely objected to the charge outside the\r\n  jury's presence pursuant to Rule 51, SCRCP, which states, &quot;No party may\r\n  assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he\r\n  objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating\r\n  distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds for his objection.\r\n  Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the\r\n  jury.&quot;\r\n[4] In response to Mr. Shaw's request, the circuit court\r\n  stated, &quot;Well, I'm not going to let you look over the charge.  I'll tell\r\n  you what it is. You can take the exceptions to it after it's charged.&quot;  \r\n[5] In light of our disposition on this issue, we decline\r\n  to address Mr. Shaw's remaining arguments.  See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (declining to address\r\n  additional issues when one issue is dispositive).  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
