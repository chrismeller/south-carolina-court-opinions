all other causes of action were allowed to proceed.Â  \r\nRenaissance thereafter filed a motion for attorney fees and costs.Â  The circuit court found Renaissance was the â€œprevailing partyâ€ as required for an award of attorney fees under section 29-5-10(a)[5] and awarded Renaissance attorney fees and costs in the amount of $10,434.00.Â  EFCO appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien is an action at law in South Carolina.[6]Â  â€œIn an\r\naction at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence reasonably supporting them.â€[7]Â  â€œThe judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.â€[8]Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Prevailing Party\r\nEFCO first argues the circuit court erred in awarding Renaissance attorney fees and costs because Renaissance could not be deemed a â€œprevailing partyâ€ under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â  Specifically, EFCO contends (a) Renaissance prevailed in its motion for summary judgment as to Lien One based on a mere technicality, not the merits, and (b) Renaissance might not prevail on the other causes of action that are still pending.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe determination of who is a prevailing party for the purposes of an award of costs is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.â€[9]Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by some error of law, or where the order is based upon findings of fact lacking evidentiary support.â€[10]\r\nThe general rule in South Carolina is that attorney fees are not recoverable unless they are authorized by contract or by statute.[11]Â  There is no right under the common law to attorney fees.[12]Â  It is undisputed that the mechanicâ€™s lien statute at issue here specifically authorizes the recovery of attorney fees and costs.Â  Section 29-5-10(a) provides in relevant part as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nA person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real estate . . . shall have a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of the building or structure in the lot of land upon which it is situated to secure the payment of the debt due to him.Â  The costs which may arise in enforcing or defending against the lien under this chapter, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee, may be recovered by the prevailing party.[13]\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has defined a â€œprevailing partyâ€ as â€œone who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of the original contention [and] is the one in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.â€[14]Â  â€œ[I]n a mechanicâ€™s lien action the defendant is entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party if it is determined that a mechanicâ€™s lien cannot be enforced against it.â€[15]Â Â Â  \r\na.Â  Merits of the Action\r\nThe definition of a prevailing party â€œclearly envisions a victory to some degree on the merits.â€[16]Â  â€œWhere the word â€˜meritsâ€™ is used when referring to a case having been decided on the merits, it embraces a consideration of substance, not of form; of legal rights, not of mere defects of procedure or the technicalities thereof.â€[17]Â  \r\nIn the current appeal, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Renaissance as to Lien One primarily because EFCO did not bring a foreclosure action within six months of filing its lien as required by statute.Â  â€œStatutes of limitations are not simply technicalities.â€[18]Â  We find Renaissance was a prevailing party because it successfully defended the action based on EFCOâ€™s failure to comply with what, in essence, amounted to a statute of limitations.[19]Â  This finding is in line with prior case law.Â  For example, in Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri[20] we held â€œa party may recover attorneyâ€™s fees and costs under Â§ 29-5-20(A)[21] as a â€˜prevailing partyâ€™ even though the party obtained a dismissal via a procedural rule, provided the dismissal was not due to [a] mere technicality.â€[22]Â  \r\nWe noted in Keeney that â€œalthough Appellants were dismissed pursuant to a procedural rule, the dismissal was not on a mere technicality.Â  Instead, Appellants prevailed because, as a matter of law, they could not be held liable for the damages Keeney sought under any circumstance.â€[23]Â  Similarly, in the current appeal, Renaissance could not held liable because, as a matter of law, the time for enforcing the lien had already expired.Â  \r\nb.Â  Other Pending Claims \r\nTo the extent EFCO further asserts the circuit court erred in finding Renaissance was a prevailing party because several causes of action are still pending, we find no error.Â  Section 29-5-10(b) of the South Carolina Code provides in relevant part:Â  â€œFor purposes of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the determination of the prevailing party is based on one verdict in the action.â€[24]Â  Under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, a party who successfully defends a claim for a lien is entitled to recover attorney fees regardless of the outcome of any remaining causes of action.[25]Â  The fees are limited, however, to those actually incurred in defending the lien.[26]Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in awarding attorney fees to Renaissance relating to its defense of the mechanicâ€™s lien claim.Â  \r\nII.Â  Amount of Attorney Fees Awarded\r\nEFCO next argues that, even if Renaissance was properly deemed a prevailing party, the circuit court abused its discretion in granting attorney fees to Renaissance because the amount of the award was excessive.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe determination of the amount of attorney fees that should be awarded under the\r\nmechanicâ€™s lien statute is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.[27] Â The courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\nabuse of discretion.[28]Â  \r\nâ€œ[T]he court should consider the following six factors when determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.â€[29]Â  â€œ[O]n appeal, an award for attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record supports each factor.â€[30]Â  \r\nIn this case, the circuit court considered each of the requisite factors and the record supports the courtâ€™s findings.Â  Initially, we note Renaissance provided a detailed time sheet outlining the time spent on, and the tasks performed for, this case.Â  We agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination that the total fee is reasonable in light of the nature of the work performed and the time it took to prepare the case.Â  In addition, Renaissance obtained a beneficial result when the circuit court granted summary judgment to it and dissolved Lien One.Â  Further, the circuit court considered the fees customarily charged in the locality and determined the award was reasonable for defending a lien of approximately $772,841.00 and was related solely to the defense of the mechanicâ€™s lien claim.Â  The remaining factors were not in dispute. Â We therefore find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Renaissance attorney fees and costs in the amount of $10,434.00.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased of the foregoing, we hold Renaissance was the prevailing party under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute and the award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $10,434.00 was not excessive.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Â S.C.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Dana Rae Rikard appeals her plea of guilty to felony driving under the influence causing death and felony driving under the influence causing great bodily injury.Â  She asserts the circuit court judge erred in refusing to allow her to withdraw her guilty plea.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter spending the afternoon and evening at the I-20 Speedway in Pelion on April 6, 2002, Rikard drove home with her four-year-old daughter at approximately 11:15 p.m.Â  While driving down US-178, Rikard collided with an on-coming vehicle driven by Stephanie Braithwaite.Â  Rikardâ€™s daughter, who was not restrained by a seatbelt or a car seat, died at the scene after she was ejected from the vehicle.Â  Braithwaiteâ€™s four-year-old son was rendered unconscious as a result of the impact.Â  Braithwaite, with the assistance of a passerby, was able to extricate her son from the vehicle before it caught fire.Â  Braithwaiteâ€™s son was immediately airlifted to Palmetto Richland Hospital where he spent several days to be treated for a subdural hematoma and a broken femur. \r\nWhile investigating the accident, the officers called to the scene searched Rikardâ€™s vehicle.Â  During this search, the officers observed the speedometer was â€œlockedâ€ around eighty miles per hour and found several empty bottles of Zima.Â  According to the officers, Rikard admitted drinking eight Zimas prior to the accident.Â  Three hours after the accident, Rikardâ€™s blood was tested at the hospital.Â  Toxicology reports revealed Rikardâ€™s blood alcohol content was .11.Â  As part of the SLED investigation, the toxicologist opined that Rikardâ€™s blood alcohol content would have been approximately .173 at the time of the accident.\r\nOn November 1, 2004, a Lexington County grand jury indicted Rikard for the following offenses:Â  child endangerment, open container violation, violation of the child restraint law, a seatbelt violation, felony driving under the influence (DUI) causing great bodily injury, and felony DUI causing death.Â  \r\nOn April 4, 2005, Rikard pleaded guilty to the felony DUI charges.[2]Â  Â Â During the plea colloquy, the circuit court judge inquired about Rikardâ€™s education level, marital status, and employment history.Â  As to the specific charges, the judge informed Rikard that her plea would be a â€œstraight-upâ€ plea without any recommendations or negotiated sentence from the State.Â  He further informed her of the maximum possible sentence for each offense and the constitutional rights she was waiving by pleading guilty.Â  Upon hearing the judgeâ€™s instructions, Rikard admitted she was guilty of the charged offenses and indicated that she wanted to plead guilty.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter determining that Rikardâ€™s guilty plea was freely and voluntarily given, the judge permitted the solicitor to give a recitation of the facts.Â  At the conclusion of this presentation, the solicitor stated, â€œwe would ask for the maximum sentence allowed under the law in this case.â€ Â The judge accepted Rikardâ€™s guilty plea after hearing the factual basis for the plea. \r\nIn mitigation, Rikardâ€™s counsel stated that Rikard was remorseful and that she had two children who needed her at home.Â  Counsel claimed Rikardâ€™s husband, from whom she was separated, was not notified in time to attend the plea proceeding.Â  Counsel further challenged points in the accident investigation, specifically the alleged speed of Rikardâ€™s vehicle before the collision.Â  Additionally, counsel stated that Rikard did not believe she was under the influence at the time of the accident even though she admitted to drinking some alcohol that night. Â He requested the court â€œbe as merciful as possible in this case.â€\r\nAfter hearing from Rikard and her mother, the judge sentenced Rikard to twenty-two years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine for felony DUI causing death and fifteen years imprisonment and a $5,000 fine for felony DUI causing great bodily injury.Â  The sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Rikard filed a motion to withdraw her plea, or in the alternative, a motion to reconsider the sentence.Â  In this motion, Rikardâ€™s counsel alleged prejudicial misconduct on the part of the State. Â Counsel submitted affidavits and letters from Rikardâ€™s family in support of this assertion. \r\nIn terms of the alleged misconduct, Rikard claimed the State acted improperly before and during the plea hearing.Â  Specifically, Rikardâ€™s counsel contended the State failed to disclose during discovery:Â  (1) that there was evidence Rikardâ€™s blood alcohol content was .173; (2) photographs of the scene depicting the deceased child; and (3) Rikardâ€™s alleged admissions regarding her consumption of alcohol prior to the accident.Â  Additionally, counsel claimed the State failed to notify Rikardâ€™s husband and her two other children of the hearing pursuant to the Victimâ€™s Bill of Rights.[3]Â  Rikard believed her family members could have offered evidence in mitigation.Â  \r\nWith respect to the Stateâ€™s actions during the hearing, Rikardâ€™s counsel asserted the solicitorâ€™s representation of the facts, particularly the description of the deceased childâ€™s final moments after the accident and the cause of the accident, was exaggerated and rose to the level of misrepresentation.Â  Counsel contended Rikard did not agree with this recitation of the facts. Rikardâ€™s counsel further argued the State failed to honor its representation that it would not make a recommendation regarding sentencing when the solicitor requested the maximum sentence during the hearing.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court judge denied Rikardâ€™s motion to withdraw her plea as well as the motion to reconsider the sentence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRikard argues the circuit court judge erred in accepting her plea or refusing to allow her to withdraw her plea on the grounds:Â  (1) she did not admit to the facts presented by the State; and (2) the State indicated on the sentencing sheet that it would make no recommendation regarding her sentence but then, during the plea hearing, requested the court impose the maximum sentence.Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial judge should not accept a guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary.Â  Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 241 (1969).Â  Additionally, to knowingly and voluntarily enter a plea of guilty, all that is required is that a defendant has a full understanding of the consequences of her plea and the charges against her.Â  Simpson v. State, 317 S.C. 506, 508, 455 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1995).Â  Moreover, the record in a guilty plea proceeding must establish a factual basis for the plea.Â  LoPiano v. State, 270 S.C. 563, 569, 243 S.E.2d 448, 451 (1978); State v. Armstrong, 263 S.C. 594, 598, 211 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1975).Â  In accepting a guilty plea, â€œthe trial judge is free to use any appropriate procedure for determining the accuracy of the guilty plea.Â  The judge must be certain that the defendant understands the charge and the consequences of the plea and that the record indicates a factual basis for the plea.â€Â  Armstrong, 263 S.C. at 598, 211 S.E.2d at 891. Â â€œAll that is required before a plea can be accepted is that the defendant understand the nature and crucial elements of the charges, the consequences of the plea, and the constitutional rights he is waiving, and that the record reflect a factual basis for the plea.â€Â \r\nRollison v. State, 346 S.C. 506, 511, 552 S.E.2d 290, 292 (2001).\r\nâ€œThe withdrawal of a guilty plea is generally within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Riddle, 278 S.C. 148, 150, 292 S.E.2d 795, 796 (1982).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial judgeâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Lopez, 352 S.C. 373, 378, 574 S.E.2d 210, 212 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A determination the plea was voluntarily entered â€œwill normally show the trial judge did not abuse his discretion.â€Â  Riddle, 278 S.C. at 150, 292 S.E.2d at 796; see State v. Cantrell, 250 S.C. 376, 378, 158 S.E.2d 189, 191 (1967)(â€œA motion to withdraw a plea of guilty, and to be allowed to enter a plea of not guilty, addresses itself to the discretion of the trial judge before whom the plea is entered, and, in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, this court will not interfere.â€).\r\nAlthough we will separately address each of Rikardâ€™s contentions, we find the circuit court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Rikardâ€™s motion to withdraw her plea.Â  \r\nIn terms of the factual basis for the plea, the judge properly allowed the solicitor to give a recitation of the facts on the record.Â  Even though Rikard did not specifically acknowledge the accuracy of the Stateâ€™s factual presentation, she did not raise any objection at the hearing and, through her counsel, had the opportunity to challenge certain aspects of the Stateâ€™s factual presentation.Â  Moreover, during the plea colloquy Rikard admitted she was guilty of the charged offenses for which she had been apprised of the elements.Â  Because the solicitor provided a sufficient factual basis in the record to support each of the DUI charges, we find Rikardâ€™s argument to be without merit.\r\nNext, we turn to Rikardâ€™s allegation that the State failed to abide by its representation on the sentencing sheet not to recommend a sentence.Â  Rikard contends she was induced to plead guilty and would not have but for the Stateâ€™s representation that it would not recommend any particular sentence.Â  Initially, we note Rikard concedes in her brief that the sentencing sheet did not constitute a formal plea agreement. Â Thus, we do not believe the same stringent requirements of plea agreements would apply to the instant case.Â  However, even if we construe the sentencing sheet as rising to the level of a contractual obligation, we find the judge did not err in declining to allow Rikard to withdraw her plea.Â  See Sprouse v. State, 355 S.C. 335, 338, 585 S.E.2d 278, 279 (2003)(â€œ[S]tate prosecutors are obligated to fulfill the promises they make to defendants when those promises serve as inducements to defendants to plead guilty.â€ (citing Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971))); State v. Thomason, 355 S.C. 278, 286, 584 S.E.2d 143, 147 (Ct. App. 2003)(â€œOur supreme court has recognized a plea agreement rests on contractual principles.â€).\r\nRikardâ€™s reliance on the sentencing sheet is unavailing.Â  The sentencing sheet offers three alternatives to designate the nature or status of the plea.Â  Those alternatives provide that the plea is:Â  (1) without negotiations or recommendation; (2) a negotiated sentence; or (3) a recommendation by the State.Â  In this instance, the option of â€œwithout negotiations or recommendationâ€ was selected by the solicitor, Rikard, and Rikardâ€™s counsel.Â  It is axiomatic that the phrase â€œwithout negotiations or recommendationâ€ means that the State and the defendant have not agreed on sentencing.Â  Therefore, either party is free to request a favorable sentence.\r\nDuring the plea colloquy Rikard acknowledged to the judge that she understood the charges, the maximum possible sentences, and that her plea was a â€œstraight-upâ€ plea without any negotiations or recommendations.Â  Taking all of these considerations into account, the judge ultimately determined Rikard was freely and voluntarily pleading guilty.Â  Finally, the judge exercised discretion when he declined to impose the maximum sentence on each charge and ordered the sentences to be served concurrently.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2945(A)(1), (2) (Supp.Â  2005) (establishing maximum term of imprisonment for felony DUI when death results as twenty-five years imprisonment and fifteen years for felony DUI causing great bodily injury); Brooks v. State, 325 S.C. 269, 271, 481 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1997)(â€œA trial judge is allowed broad discretion in sentencing within statutory limits.â€).Â  Thus, we find no error in the judgeâ€™s decision accepting Rikardâ€™s plea and refusing her request to withdraw her plea.[4]Â  See State v. Barton, 325 S.C. 522, 531, 481 S.E.2d 439, 444 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding no error in trial judgeâ€™s refusal to allow appellant to withdraw guilty plea where appellant failed to object at any point before the judge accepted his guilty plea and judge:Â  considered evidence presented by appellant, allowed appellant to testify about the nature of the guilty plea, and thoroughly questioned appellant during guilty plea).\r\nAccordingly, Rikardâ€™s guilty plea and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  The solicitor dismissed the collateral traffic violations as a result of the plea. \r\n[3]Â Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 24.\r\n[4]Â Â  In support of her argument, Rikard relies on our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Jordan v. State, 297 S.C. 52, 374 S.E.2d 683 (1988).Â  We find this case to be distinguishable from the instant case.Â  In Jordan, appellant petitioned for post-conviction relief on the ground his counsel was ineffective for failing to withdraw appellantâ€™s guilty plea after the State reneged on a plea bargain.Â  According to appellant, he only agreed to plead guilty when the assistant solicitor indicated the State would neither recommend nor oppose a probationary sentence for the charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon.Â  At the guilty plea hearing, another assistant solicitor appeared for the State and opposed a probationary sentence.Â  Appellantâ€™s counsel did not request to withdraw the plea or point out to the judge that the State had changed the plea agreement.Â  The trial judge declined to reconsider his sentence because he was not influenced by the assistant solicitorâ€™s opposition to probation.Â  Our supreme court vacated appellantâ€™s sentence and remanded for either specific performance of the plea agreement and resentencing or for a new trial.Â  The court found appellantâ€™s counsel erred in failing to protect appellantâ€™s right to enforce the plea agreement.Â Â  Here, unlike in Jordan, the State did not promise anything in exchange for Rikardâ€™s plea.Â  Rikard also acknowledged during the plea hearing that it was a â€œstraight-upâ€ plea without any negotiations.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4157","title":"Sanders v.

Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\nBen C. Harrison, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, MeadWestvaco Corporation (Westvaco) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the Â Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) awarding Â Kenneth Sanders (Sanders) a 40% permanent partial disability Â to his lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint (SI joint).Â  Westvaco also appeals the circuit courtâ€™s failure to find it was entitled to credit for overpayment of temporary total disability from the date Sanders reached maximum medical improvement.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nSanders, a chip mill operator employed by Westvaco, was injured on March 16, 2001, when a front-end loader flung a piece of wood that struck Sanders in his knee. Â Sanders was taken immediately to the emergency room where he was treated for the injury. Â \r\nSeveral months later Sanders began to complain about lower back pain that radiated into his right hip and buttock region. Â On August 27, 2001, Dr. Phillip Milner noted that Sanders was having a â€œpalpable snapâ€ of the right SI joint, occurring repetitively when he turned his leg or lifted his leg, which he described as a â€œvery consistent and a noticeable finding.â€ After an MRI scan showed a herniated disc at L4/5 with right L5 root involvement, Dr. Milner referred Sanders to Dr. Charles Hughes for an epidural injection.Â  \r\nDr. Hughes attempted to treat Sandersâ€™ herniated disc with several epidural steroid injections, followed by a right SI joint block injection procedure.Â  He believed, as did Dr. Jacquelyn Van Dam, who was consulted to perform an EMG study, that the herniated disc was not a reasonable source of Sandersâ€™ back pain and that surgery would not benefit him. When conservative treatment failed to make a notable difference, Dr. Hughes referred Sanders to Dr. William Felmly at the Moore Orthopedic Clinic for another surgical opinion.Â  Â \r\nAfter meeting with Sanders on a single occasion, Dr. Felmly concluded Sanders had a chronic SI joint problem but surgery was not warranted. Dr. Felmly opined Sanders had a 2% permanent partial impairment of the SI joint.Â  After reviewing Dr. Felmlyâ€™s report, Dr. Hughes found Sanders had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) and had a 12% impairment of the SI joint and a whole person impairment of 2%. Â Further, Dr. Hughes believed, as did Dr. Felmly, that Sanders was limited by his own subjective complaints. \r\nSanders then saw Dr. Samuel Seastrunk.Â  After an independent medical evaluation of Sanders, Dr. Seastrunk stated Sanders had: (1) an L4/5 disc herniation with significant involvement of the L5 nerve root and radiculitis, and (2) a complex problem with SI instability. Dr. Seastrunk, in sharp contrast with previous doctors, rated the impairment of the lumbar spine at 18%, and an impairment of 22% to the whole person. Â \r\nOn September 26, 2002, Westvaco filed a Form 21 Hearing Request seeking to stop payment of temporary total disability benefits. Â Moreover, Westvaco sought a credit for any overpayment beyond Sandersâ€™ date of MMI, which both parties stipulated occurred on August 21, 2002.Â  Also, Westvaco questioned the compensability of Sandersâ€™ claim of anxiety and depression as well as the extent of his disability.Â  Sanders contended he was permanently and totally disabled and sought additional medical care. Â \r\nAfter a hearing, the single commissioner concluded Sanders did not meet his burden of proving his depression and anxiety were causally related to his work-related injury. Â The single commissioner also found that Sanders had a 13% loss of use of his right leg due to the accident.Â  Further, the single commissioner found:\r\n\r\nAfter considering the opinion of Dr. Seastrunk and his impairment rating of 22%, and after considering the opinions of Dr. Hughes, Dr. VanDam, and Dr. Felmly suggesting that the Claimantâ€™s subjective complaints are out of proportion with his objective physical findings . . . and after considering the opinions [of all of the doctors] indicating that the Claimant did not need surgery or other invasive treatment as a result of the March 16, 2001 accident; and notwithstanding the Dr. Hughesâ€™s and Dr. Felmlyâ€™s opinion that Claimant sustained only a 2% impairment, I find that the Claimant is credible and has a 40% loss of use of his lumbar spine and SI Joint as a result of chronic pain and a potential need for surgery to these areas. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the single commissioner found Sanders was entitled to future medical treatment â€œfor medication, pain management, his TENS unit, and SI beltâ€ to lessen his period of disability.Â  The single commissioner granted Westvacoâ€™s request to terminate temporary total disability compensation but found Westvaco was only entitled to a credit for overpayment for the period after January 16, 2003, which was the day before the hearing.\r\nThe Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner, adopting the single commissionerâ€™s findings in full. Â Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Appellate Panel, finding the decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record and that Sandersâ€™ testimony alone provided substantial evidence to support the finding that he had 40% loss of use of his back.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Appellate Panel.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The Appellate Panel is specifically reserved the task of assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded evidence.Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn appeal from the Appellate Panel, this court may reverse or modify a decision if the findings or conclusions of the Appellate Panel are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  This court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  A finding is supported by substantial evidence â€œunless there is no reasonable probability that the facts could be as related by a witness upon whose testimony the finding was based.â€Â  Lark, 276 S.C. at 136, 276 S.E.2d at 307.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Section 42-9-30 Analysis\r\nOn appeal, Westvaco first argues that section 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (1985) permits disability awards based on degrees of medical impairment to Â­Â­specified body parts, and the circuit court erred in affirming an award of benefits based upon impairment to functional units of the back, i.e., the lumbar spine and SI joint which are not scheduled for compensation under section 42-9-30.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Appellate Panel concluded Sanders was entitled to compensation under section 42-9-30 (19) for â€œpermanent loss of use of the lumbar spine and SI joint.â€ Section 42-9-30(19) provides for compensation for injury to the back as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the total loss of use of the back, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wages during three hundred weeks. The compensation for partial loss of use of the back shall be such proportions of the periods of payment herein provided for total loss as such partial loss bear to total loss . . . . \r\n\r\nIn affirming the Appellate Panel, the circuit court interpreted the Appellate Panelâ€™s order to have awarded benefits based on injuries to the back. The circuit court concluded â€œ[a] review of the record reflects that these injuries and disabilities were clearly to the back.â€Â Â  Westvacoâ€™s argument that because the Appellate Panelâ€™s order was too specific in identifying the regions of the back where Sandersâ€™ loss of use occurred and that these regions are somehow separate from the back itself is without merit. \r\nAccordingly, even though the SI joint and lumbar spine are not specifically mentioned in section 42-9-30, we find no reversible error in the manner in which the Appellate Panel characterized Sandersâ€™ injuries.[1] Â A review of the Appellate Panelâ€™s order and the record reflects Sandersâ€™ injury and subsequent disability was clearly to his back.Â  This approach is consistent with our policy of\r\nliberally construing the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in favor of coverage.Â  Schulknight v. City of N. Charleston, 352 S.C. 175, 178, 574 S.E.2d 194, 195 (2002); see also Mgmt. Recruiters v. R.J.R. Mech., Inc., 304 S.C. 399, 401, 404 S.E.2d 908, 909 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding when construing a judgment, the determinative factor is the â€œintent of the officer who wrote it, as gathered not from an isolated part of the judgment, but from all parts thereofâ€). Â \r\nII. Impairment Rating\r\nNext, Westvaco argues the evidence was insufficient to establish Sanders suffered a 40% loss of use of his back.Â  Westvacoâ€™s contentions are twofold: (1) the medical testimony established, at most, a 22% impairment rating; and (2) the circuit court erred in affirming an award based upon the potential need for future surgery.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Evidence of Impairment \r\nWestvaco argues Sanders is not entitled to benefits because the evidence was insufficient to establish he suffered a 40% loss of use of his back.Â  Westvaco contends only the opinion of medical experts can be used to assess Sandersâ€™ impairment.Â  We disagree.\r\nWestvaco argues that since Sanders was awarded disability under Â§ 42-9-30, Wigfall v. Tideland Util., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 580 S.E.2d 100 (2003), should be controlling regarding the impairment rating.Â  After reviewing the Wigfall courtâ€™s decision, we agree that this case falls within the Wigfall medical model encompassed in Â§ 42-9-30. 354 S.C. at 107, 580 S.E.2d at 103. We do not agree that a determination of impairment under this section mandates that only medical evidence may be considered by the Commission in determining the degree of disability.\r\nWhile an impairment rating may not rest on â€œsurmise, speculation or conjecture . . . Â it is not necessary that the percentage of disability or loss of use be shown with mathematical exactness.â€Â  Roper v. Kimbrellâ€™s of Greenville, 231 S.C. 453, 461, 99 S.E.2d 52, 57 (1957) (citations omitted); see also Linen v. Ruscon Constr. Co., 286 S.C. 67, 68-69, 332 S.E.2d 211, 212 (1985) (finding that although expert testimony found claimant suffered from a 20-30% impairment to his back, testimony of vocational expert and claimant provided substantial evidence to affirm Appellate Panelâ€™s decision finding claimantâ€™s impairment exceeded 50%); Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co, 315 S.C. 440, 445-46, 434 S.E.2d 292, 294-95 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding, pursuant to section 42-9-30, that while expert testimony suggested claimant suffered only a 35% impairment to his back, testimony of claimant and others provided substantial evidence that claimantâ€™s impairment exceeded 50%).Â  \r\nFurther, the Appellate Panel is not bound by the opinion of medical experts and â€œmay find a degree of disability different from that suggested by expert testimony.â€Â  Lyles, 315 at 445, 434 S.E.2d at 295 (citations omitted).Â  Expert medical testimony is merely intended to aid the Appellate Panel in coming to the correct conclusion.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 624, 571 S.E.2d 92, 98 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 513 S.E.2d 843 (1999)).Â  â€œUnless the question of the extent of partial loss of use under [section] 42-9-30 is so technically complicated as to require exclusively expert testimony, lay testimony is admissible.â€Â  Linen, 286 S.C. at 68, 332 S.E.2d at 212.\r\nAlthough Dr. Seastrunk found Sandersâ€™ impairment was at 22% to the whole person, Sanders testified at length to the character and extent of his back injury and the restrictions the injury has placed on his physical activities.Â  Sanders testified he has pain in the lower back shooting down into his right buttock and into his leg stopping just above his knee.Â  He utilizes a TENS unit for pain as well as a sacroiliac belt that he wears daily.Â  He has trouble sitting because he must constantly change positions to keep weight off his right buttock.Â  He takes pain medication in order to walk normally.Â  His pain affects his sleeping, allowing him to sleep only five hours a night.Â  He can no longer walk up the steps in the front of his house and now must enter through the back.Â  Sanders testified he used to play tennis three times a week and enjoyed fishing, hunting, and horseback riding.Â  He even built his own home.Â  He testified since his work-related accident, he is no longer an active person and cannot even tie his own shoes.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAlthough some of the medical evidence may suggest Sanders is not impaired by his back injury, â€œit is not for this court to balance objective against subjective findings of medical witnesses, or to weigh the testimony of one witness against that of another.â€Â  Roper, 231 S.C. at 461, 99 S.E.2d at 57.Â  That function belongs to the Appellate Panel alone.Â  Id.Â  Further, the Appellate Panel correctly considered both medical and lay testimony in arriving at its decision.Â  See Linen, 286 S.C. at 68, 332 S.E.2d at 212. Â Â Â \r\nA review of the Appellate Panelâ€™s order reveals it considered, in detail, all expert and lay testimony before making its ruling.Â  Important to the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision was Sandersâ€™ testimony, which the Appellate Panel found credible.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s consideration of both lay and medical testimony in arriving at its decision.Â Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Award Based on Potential Need for Surgery Â  \r\nAlthough we agree with Sanders that the Appellate Panel may utilize lay testimony to reach an impairment rating higher than that testified to by the medical experts, we find that the Appellate Panel erred as a matter of law in basing its award of a 40% impairment of the back on a potential need for surgery. \r\nAs we stated in Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 467, 622 S.E.2d 577, 585 (Ct. App. 2005), â€œ[m]aximum medical improvement is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.â€ (citations omitted).Â  However, the fact that a claimant has reached MMI does not necessarily preclude a finding that additional medical treatment may be needed if the medical treatment would tend to improve the claimantâ€™s quality of life but not further improve the medical condition.Â  See Pearson v. JPS Converter &amp; Indus. Corp., 327 S.C. 393, 398, 489 S.E.2d 219, 221 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 459 S.E.2d 324 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œContinued treatment of prescriptive medicine did not preclude a finding of maximum medical improvement, because the medication could temporarily alleviate claimantâ€™s symptoms but not further improve his medical condition.â€).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the parties stipulated Sanders reached MMI on August 21, 2002, and as such was entitled to future medical care that would tend to alleviate his symptoms but not further improve his medical condition.Â  Moreover, Westvaco has not appealed the Appellate Panel awarding Sanders future treatment for pain as future medical care. Â However, the Appellate Panel incorrectly premised its award of 40% loss of use of the back on a potential need for surgery.Â  Sanders has not pointed to any case law, statute or regulation that would allow the Appellate Panel to base an impairment rating under section 42-9-30 upon a potential need for surgery, where no evidence suggests that the surgery would be needed to alleviate Sandersâ€™ symptoms as opposed to further improving his medical condition.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Appellate Panel to determine how much of its award was based upon its conclusion that Sanders may need surgery in the future and to recalculate, if appropriate, Sandersâ€™ degree of impairment.Â  Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Overpayment of Temporary Total Benefits\r\nWestvaco argues the Appellate Panel erred in limiting its credit for overpayment to the period commencing the day preceding the hearing before the single commissioner. Â We agree.Â  Â \r\nCredit for overpayment of temporary total benefits is governed by section 42-9-210 (1985) of the South Carolina Code:\r\n\r\nAny payments made by an employer to an injured employee during the period of his disability, or to his dependents, which by the terms of this Title were not due and payable when made may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation; provided, that in the case of disability such deductions shall be made by shortening the period during which compensation must be paid and not by reducing the amount of the weekly payment.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 414, 517 S.E.2d 698, 703 (Ct. App. 1999), we held that â€œ[o]nce the [Appellate Panel] affirmed that (employee) had reached MMI, it was then appropriate to terminate TTD benefits in favor of either permanent partial or permanent total disability benefits, if warranted by substantial evidence in the record.â€Â  (citations omitted).Â  See also Smith v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Health, 335 S.C. 396, 399, 517 S.E.2d 694, 696 (1999) (â€œThe rationale for ceasing temporary benefits upon a finding of MMI is to permit entry of a permanent award.Â  Clearly, if an employee has reached MMI and remains disabled, then his injury is permanent . . . This is precisely the reason to terminate temporary benefits in favor of permanent benefits upon a finding of MMI.â€). \r\nIt is undisputed MMI was reached on August 21, 2002, and the hearing before the single commissioner was on January 16, 2003.Â  The Appellate Panel found that due to the fact the hearing was rescheduled â€œseveral times,â€ Westvaco was only entitled to credit for overpayments for the period after January 16, 2003. Â The Respondent admitted at oral argument that the hearing had been rescheduled twice, once at the request of the employer, and once at the request of Sanders. Â Under section 42-9-260, Westvaco was entitled to have its request to terminate temporary total benefits heard within 60 days of filing the request. Â Here, the delay in having a timely hearing falls squarely on both parties.

During their fourteen-year marriage the parties relocated a number of times to pursue Husbandâ€™s professional opportunities and to improve the partiesâ€™ financial position. \r\nIn Lafayette, Louisiana, where the parties married, both worked for Comtel, a telecommunications company.Â  Wife was employed as a sales representative and Husband was a senior executive.Â  Her salary at the time was approximately $45,000.00 and Husbandâ€™s was approximately $75,000.00.Â  \r\nComtel merged in 1990 with a long distance telecommunications company, and the couple relocated to Jackson, Mississippi. Â Husbandâ€™s salary at that time was approximately $80,000.00, plus stock options.Â  Wife completed her college education during that time and, in addition, worked in a local boutique. \r\nEarly in the 1990s Husband started a wireless paging company in Covington, Louisiana.Â  He earned approximately $40,000 per year in this two-year venture.Â  Wife started a bridal registry business, which, though allegedly successful, did not result in any personal income because she put all profits back into the business. \r\nIn 1993 or 1994, the couple relocated to Rochester, New York, where Husband accepted an executive level management position with ACC Communications at an initial salary of approximately $150,000.00, plus stock options.Â  Wife returned to work for a short time until the parties decided to buy a home and start a family.Â  Both agreed Wife would not work outside the home.Â  \r\nIn 1997 Husband left ACC, having acquired approximately four million dollars in assets generated by his stocks and options.Â  The family moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where Husband entered a start-up telecommunications venture, â€œNew South,â€ and assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO).Â  His initial annual salary was $70,000.00, plus stock options.Â  When Husband was terminated from New South in 2001, his annual salary was $150,000.00, plus bonuses and stock options. \r\nAt the time of the final hearing in March of 2004, both parties resided in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  Wife was thirty-eight years old and Husband was forty-three.Â  Both graduated from college.Â  Wife takes prescription medication for anxiety but claimed to be in good health otherwise.Â  Husband has severe back problems, has had surgery, and continues to suffer chronic pain.Â  Associated with Husbandâ€™s back injury is a history of addiction to pain medication, for which he has received some rehabilitative treatment.Â  Husband has not been employed since his termination from New South.Â  Â Wife began working in the spring of 2003 as a Physicianâ€™s Liaison with the Greenville Hospital System, earning approximately $75,000.00 annually. \r\nOn February 25, 2002, Wife petitioned for divorce on the ground of continuously living separate and apart for one year without intervening cohabitation. Subsequently, Husband and Wife agreed upon custody, visitation, family support, and division of certain marital assets.[1]  \r\nThe parties had significant marital property, which, in addition to the marital home, included cash, checking accounts, retirement assets, investment accounts and securities, insurance policies and proceeds, potential income tax refunds and substantial personal property in the form of antiques, home furnishings, vehicles, firearms, coin collections, childrenâ€™s portraits, jewelry, and gold coins. \r\nAt the commencement of trial Wife withdrew her requests 1) for permanent alimony; and 2) that Husband maintain a life insurance policy as an incident of support.Â  Instead, Wife sought equitable apportionment of the policy as one of the marital assets.Â  The issues before the court for disposition on final hearing included: divorce; identification, valuation and apportionment of marital assets and marital debts; child support; modification of prior support orders; and attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nThe family court awarded Wife a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation without intervening cohabitation.Â  The parties stipulated that Wife maintain custody of the three minor children, allowing Husband reasonable visitation.Â  The litigants agreed to the permanent apportionment of New South interests in percentages consistent with the apportionment of the general marital estate.Â  Stipulations of the parties were adopted, incorporated into and merged with the final decree and order.Â  The family court identified, valued and equitably apportioned the partiesâ€™ marital property and debts. The final order provided:\r\n\r\n   Among the marital assets is the marital home . . . . [T]he greater and more credible evidence supports a fair market valuation of $700,000.00 . . . . The marital home is subject to mortgage indebtedness which has a date of filing balance due of $404,000.00 . . . .\r\n    [A]fter considering this indebtedness, the net fair market value of the equity in this home is $296,000.00.\r\n  [I]n the event the marital home is sold within six years of this Order, and the sales price exceeds $700,000.00, any excess net proceeds (resulting from a sales price over $700,000.00) shall be distributed equally to the parties, provided, that any increase in the value of the house that is the direct result of Wifeâ€™s direct contribution or improvement to the house subsequent to this Order shall not be subject to distribution.Â  This Court reserves jurisdiction to determine the extent of direct contributions in the event that the marital home sells within the six-year period.\r\n   Without question or contest, Husband made the vast majority of the direct contributions to the marriage . . . . Wife clearly made the vast majority of the indirect contributions to the marriage . . . . When considered in their entirety, the contributions of each party to the marriage, both direct and indirect combined, are equal in value. Â \r\n   Husband is either not employed or significantly underemployed.\r\n   Based on all the credible evidence, Husband has the ability to earn in the lower range of the senior level salaries, or about $100,000.00 per year. Husband is therefore imputed with this level of gross income for purposes of this Order.\r\n   Based on the findings of this Order, and all the credible evidence presented, Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income for purposes of calculating child support is $8330.00.Â  Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income for child support purposes is $6250.00. Beginning with the first day of the first month following the filing of this Order, Husband shall pay child support directly to Wife in the amount of One Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty and 00/100 Dollars ($1930.00) per month.\r\n   As an incident of child support, for so long as the children are enrolled in private school, Husband shall pay to Wife, on a monthly basis, 57% of the childrenâ€™s private school tuition.\r\n   Husband shall contribute the sum of Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) to Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and suit costs.\r\n   Based on careful review of all the evidence, and consideration of all appropriate factors, the marital estate should generally be equally divided between the parties . . . . To effectuate an equal division of the marital estate, Wife shall pay Husband $48,925.00 . . . offset by the $50,000.00 contribution required by Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees . . . with this offset Wifeâ€™s obligation to pay Husband is satisfied and Husband owes Wife $1075.00 . . . .\r\n   It does not appear that any of the nine listed pieces of jewelry was identified as being non-marital . . . . Based on the evidence presented, the marital jewelry has a fair market value of $46,400.00.\r\n\r\nBoth parties filed motions to alter or amend the family courtâ€™s judgment, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Husband filed a motion to dismiss Wifeâ€™s motion as not timely filed.Â  The family court found Wifeâ€™s motion was timely filed.Â  Wife objected to Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend on ground that Husband failed to properly serve the motion.Â  The court ruled on both partiesâ€™ motions and held:\r\n\r\n  [T]he jewelry, as declared in the Final Order and Divorce Decree was appropriately declared marital property.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The findings and conclusions regarding the marital home should not be altered or amended.\r\n\r\n\r\n   In addition to the obligation to contribute to Plaintiffâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and general litigation costs, Defendant shall contribute the sum Five Thousand Five Hundred Thirty-Two and 50/100 Dollars ($5532.50) to the expert fees incurred by Plaintiff. Therefore, Defendantâ€™s total contribution to Plaintiffâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is and shall be the sum of Fifty-Five Thousand Five Hundred Thirty-two and 50/100 ($55,532.50) . . . . Â This obligation shall be satisfied by Wife offsetting this contribution for the balance due to Husband for the equitable apportionment of marital property. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n   With the evidence before me . . . there is no need to alter or amend the findings regarding Defendantâ€™s earning capacity as determined in the Final Order and Divorce Decree.\r\n\r\nBy Supplemental Order dated September 29, 2004, the family court awarded guardian ad litem fees in the amount of $3,617.00, and ordered that each party share equally in paying the obligation, less any monies already paid in satisfaction of this obligation. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  However, this broad review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (citing Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E. 2d 154, 157 (1996)). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially, we dispose of a procedural issue challenging this courtâ€™s jurisdiction to consider Husbandâ€™s appeal in this matter.Â  Wife maintains the time for filing Husbandâ€™s notice of intent to appeal lapsed because the time was not tolled by Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend. Â Husband served his motion by facsimile, which Wife argues is not proper service in accordance with Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  We agree with the family court judge that, though Husband technically failed to properly serve his motion, â€œto refuse to address this motion based on this technical defect would not do substantial justice in this action.â€ â€œ[T]he overriding purpose of service is noticeâ€ and Wife unquestionably had notice of Husbandâ€™s motion. \r\nHUSBANDâ€™S APPEAL\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Imputed Income\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in imputing income to him. Specifically, Husband argues the record failed to demonstrate Husbandâ€™s continued unemployment was voluntary because: 1) Wife did not establish that employment was available at the level of income imputed by the court; 2) Husband suffered both physical and mental limitations due to severe injury; and 3) the family court considered available out of state employment that would alienate Husband from his minor children. \r\nThe family court judge declared that â€œ[w]hen one or more parties is unemployed or underemployed and issues of equitable distribution, child support and attorneyâ€™s fees are presented, the family court judge must determine the partyâ€™s reasonably anticipated income and earning potential.â€ Consistent with that determination the court will impute income to the unemployed or underemployed party for purposes of calculating support obligations. See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720 (Supp. 2005).Â  The statutes addressing domestic matters in South Carolina mandate that the family court consider certain factors in dividing marital property and awarding spousal and child support.Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code requires that, in making an equitable division of marital assets and debts, the family court give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to fifteen enumerated factors.Â  Those particularly relevant for imputation of income include: \r\n\r\n3) the value of the marital property, whether the property\r\nbe within or without the State. The contribution of each spouse to the\r\nacquisition, preservation, depreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the contribution of the spouse as homemaker; provided, that the court shall consider the quality of the contribution as well as its factual\r\nexistence;\r\n(4) the income of each spouse, the earning potential of each spouse, and the opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets;\r\n(5) the health, both physical and emotional, of each spouse; . . .\r\n(15) such other relevant factors as the trial court shall expressly enumerate in its order.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nIn awarding spousal support, the family court must consider thirteen factors. Those pertaining to the question of imputing income include: \r\n\r\n(2) the physical and emotional condition of each spouse . . .\r\n(4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse . . .\r\n(6) the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses;\r\n(7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spouses . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005).\r\nFor calculation of child support under guidelines promulgated pursuant to section 43-5-580(b) of the South Carolina Code, income is defined as â€œactual gross income of the parent, if employed to full capacity, or potential income if unemployed or underemployed.â€ 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(1) (Supp. 2005). Â Regarding the imputation of income, the guidelines provide:\r\n\r\nIf the court finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, it should calculate child support based on a determination of potential income which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent . . . .\r\n(b) In order to impute income to a parent who is unemployed or underemployed, the court should determine the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent based on that parentâ€™s recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community. \r\n\r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(B) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\nGiven the general principles of imputation of income in family court litigation, we are instructed by our case law involving child support.Â  South Carolina courts have not hesitated to impute income in child support cases where a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.Â  In 1986, before the legislature mandated adherence to the child support guidelines, we held that a fatherâ€™s earning potential was properly considered in calculating his child support obligation where he voluntarily removed himself from the job market to attend law school.Â  Chastain v. Chastain, 289 S.C. 281, 283, 346 S.E.2d 33, 35 (Ct. App 1986).Â  Subsequently, in Eckstein v. Eckstein, 306 S.C. 167, 169-70, 410 S.E.2d 578, 580 (Ct. App. 1991), this court concluded the family court properly considered the wifeâ€™s potential income in calculation of her child support obligation, though she had custody of two young children and was responsible for their care.Â  We noted the record reflected the family courtâ€™s appropriate inclusion of child care costs in its determination. Id. at 170, 410 S.E.2d at 580; see also, Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 532, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (affirming family courtâ€™s properly imputing minimum wage income to voluntarily unemployed or underemployed wife, though she had custody of two children, but was capable and energetic).Â  In Holcombe v. Hardee, our Supreme Court reversed the family courtâ€™s refusal to require child support from the wife who claimed she was unable to pay that obligation. 304 S.C. 522, 523, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991).Â  The Court found the wife had potential income, investments, and many assets from which she could contribute to her childâ€™s support. Id. at 525, 405 S.E.2d at 822-23.Â  Citing Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 312, 384 S.E.2d 715, 716 (1989), the Court listed the following factors to be considered in determining child support obligations: both parents 1) incomes; 2) ability to pay; 3) education; 4) expenses; 5) assets; and the 6) the facts and circumstances surrounding each case. Id.  \r\nIn Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 361, 461 S.E.2d 397, 398 (Ct. App. 1995), the family court awarded an increase in child support based on income imputed to the husband after finding him voluntarily underemployed. The family court imputed an annual income of $30,000.00 even though the husband claimed his income as an attorney was $700.00 per month. Â Evidence of voluntary underemployment included testimony that recent hires in the community started at yearly salaries of $35,000.00. Id. at 362, 461 S.E.2d at 398.Â  Additionally, the University of South Carolina School of Law placement office reported the lowest starting salary for new attorneys in the community was $25,000.00 annually. Id.Â  Eleven years prior to the court hearing and before attending law school, the husband had earned $17,000.00 annually. Id.Â  Further, he made no efforts to find more lucrative employment, his present wife was unemployed, and he frequently borrowed money from his father. Id.Â  This court, â€œ[b]ased on the evidence of the fatherâ€™s occupational qualifications, prevailing job opportunities, earning levels in the community, and his insincere efforts to provide the trial court with evidence of his earning potential, [affirmed] the family courtâ€™s finding that the father [was] voluntarily underemployed.â€ Id. at 363, 461 S.E.2d at 399.Â  Similarly, in Fisher v. Fisher, 319 S.C. 500, 506, 462 S.E.2d 303, 306 (Ct. App. 1995), we affirmed the family courtâ€™s imputing $8.00 per hour income to the husband for purposes of calculating child support, although he was unemployed at the time of the hearing.Â  Evidence in the record showed that the husband had been employed at $8.00 per hour for about eighty days, but voluntarily left that position because â€œit was too far away, too dirtyâ€ and unrelated to work he previously performed. Id. at 507, 462 S.E.2d at 307. \r\nAs in Chastain, 289 S.C. at 283, 346 S.E.2d at 35, we found no error in the family courtâ€™s imputing income to the wife for child support purposes in Â Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 450, 539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The wife had a masterâ€™s degree and had been employed as a department coordinator at Furman University earning $28,000.00 per year when she voluntarily chose to relocate to pursue graduate studies. The family court imputed $28,000.00 per year, reasoning she would have earned at least that much had she not voluntarily terminated her employment at Furman. Id.\r\nIn Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 209, 532 S.E.2d 890, 893 (Ct. App. 2000), we affirmed the family courtâ€™s imputation of income over the wifeâ€™s objection that the imputed amount was less than the husbandâ€™s earning potential.Â  In Mazzone, the husband had voluntarily provided some financial support for the child before the commencement of the family court action.Â  Id. at 206, 532 S.E.2d at 892.Â  When husband was terminated from his five-year employment where his income was $12.50 per hour, he started a tractor trailer repair business, which had been in operation for less than one year. The business was operating at a loss at the time of trial. Id. at 207, 532 S.E.2d at 892.Â  The family court imputed minimum wage to the husband in calculating child support.Â  Wife argued husbandâ€™s employment potential was considerably greater. Id. at 208, 532 S.E.2d at 892. Â The family court found no evidence indicating the termination from his job was the result of any wrongdoing and no evidence the decision to start his own business was motivated by a desire to avoid support obligations.Â  Husband testified he was fired for refusing to participate in fraudulent activity and few available jobs existed that were similar to his former employment. He further admitted that the expenses in his new business were greater than anticipated. Id. at 208-9, 532 S.E.2d at 893. Â We concluded the evidence reflected the husbandâ€™s good faith effort to pursue self-employment. â€œThe fact that the newly-formed business ha[d] not yet shown a profit does not constitute a showing the fatherâ€™s efforts at making the business a success [were] less than sincere.â€ Id.  \r\nMesser v. Messer was a spousal support case in which the husband declared income he received from a covenant not to compete as capital gains, thus lowering his income and avoiding payment of alimony. 359 S.C. 614, 619, 598 S.E.2d 310, 313 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The family court found the covenant not to compete was ordinary income and imputed income to the husband, despite the fact he did not work. Id. at 626, 598 S.E.2d at 317.Â  We held:\r\n\r\n[t]hough the terms of the decree grant Husband great latitude in his choice of employment and provide a standard measure for reporting income, Husbandâ€™s right to manipulate his income must be governed by what is reasonable in light of the purpose of the agreement and the decree . . . . Read as a whole, one purpose of the decree was to provide a continuing means of support for Wife that kept pace with Husbandâ€™s income. Therefore, we hold the family court did not err by ruling income should be imputed to Husband. \r\n\r\nId. at 628, 598 S.E.2d at 318. \r\nFinding no evidence of earning potential impaired by age or health, the court of appeals imputed an annual salary to the husband in the amount of $86,000.00, based on his annual salary from 1988 though 1993. Id. at 630, 598 S.E.2d at 319.Â  It is important to note we reversed the family courtâ€™s finding that husbandâ€™s minimizing his ordinary income and, consequently, his alimony obligation, violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  We agreed with the husband that he had not acted in bad faith by attempting to minimize his tax consequences, though it had the effect of decreasing the wifeâ€™s support. Id. at 622, 598 S.E.2d at 315. \r\nContrastively, in Patrick v. Britt, we agreed with the family court in its finding that the husband â€œpurposefully arranged his finances in a manner that would make it difficult to determine his actual income.â€ 364 S.C. 508, 511, 613 S.E.2d 541, 542 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Husband was the owner and operator of a business that reported over $430,000.00 in income in 2002.Â  Yet, he reported only $66.01 per month in income on his financial declaration, attributing his low income to high costs of running the business.Â  Id. at 510, 613 S.E.2d at 542.Â  The family court imputed income of $100,000.00 and we affirmed, based on the accountantâ€™s evidence, the applicable law and Brittâ€™s refusal to assist the court in resolving the issue. Â Id. at 513, 613 S.E.2d at 543 (citing Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 364, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1995)). \r\nLikewise, in Penny v. Green, we affirmed the family courtâ€™s imputation of $120,000.00 to the husband, rather than the $100,000.00 income he claimed. 357 S.C. 583, 590, 594 S.E.2d 171, 175 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The family court correctly determined the husband relocated voluntarily, and his purported $100,000.00 salary was based on a three day work week.Â  Therefore, the family court imputed $120,000.00 in income based on the husbandâ€™s previous earnings. Id. at 591, 594 S.E.2d at 175.Â  This court explained â€œ[w]here a parent voluntarily lessens his or her earning capacity, this court will closely scrutinize the facts to determine the parentâ€™s capacity to earn, rather than his or her actual earnings.â€ Â Id. (citing Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. at 363, 461 S.E.2d at 399).Â  Additionally, we reversed the family courtâ€™s reduction in husbandâ€™s support obligation. 357 S.C. at 590, 594 S.E.2d at 174.Â  Husband maintained his income decrease after his move was a substantial change in circumstances, warranting modification, because, during the pendency of the divorce proceedings, he underreported his income in his original financial declaration.Â  Thus, the disparity between his true income and current income was substantial. We concluded the family court erred in allowing the husband to contradict his previous financial declaration in order to demonstrate a larger disparity from his present income. Id. at 591, 594 S.E.2d at 175.Â  â€œA party cannot misrepresent income and expenses on a financial declaration for purposes of having an agreement approved and then refute the accuracy of that document in a subsequent modification action.â€ Id. Â (citing Rogers v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 332, 540 S.E.2d 840, 841 (2001)). \r\nMost recently, we reversed the family courtâ€™s imputation of the husbandâ€™s income at over $9000.00 per month where there was no evidence in the record that his income was voluntarily depressed. Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 281, 609 S.E.2d 821, 828 (Ct. App. 2005) cert. granted, March 23, 2006.Â  Though the husband was well educated and could earn additional income, the amount of imputed income was not warranted without evidence that his â€œfailure to make additional income was due to any wrongdoing on his part or motivated by a desire to decrease his support obligation.â€ Id. (citing Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 209, 532 S.E.2d 890, 893 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  We opined that taking wifeâ€™s contention that the husband was capable of earning more income to its logical conclusion, a family court could conceivably impute income to a spouse by merely finding he or she was capable of earning more income.Â  â€œThis is simply not the test for imputation of income in this state.â€ Id. at 282, 609 S.E.2d at 828.\r\nThe principles distilled from Mazzone and Arnal suggest that voluntariness, for the purposes of imputing income, encompasses unemployment or underemployment that is not only intentional, but is additionally the result of some wrongdoing or effort to avoid a support obligation. Â Our neighboring jurisdictions are guided by similar principles.Â  In North Carolina, â€œ[t]he determination of whether to impute income to a parent who is voluntarily unemployed is a determination based in part on the conduct of the parent.â€ Roberts v. McAllister, 621 S.E.2d 191, 198 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) (citing Wolf v. Wolf, 566 S.E.2d 516 (N.C. Ct. App. 2002)). Â The â€œearning capacity ruleâ€ is the basis for imputation of income articulated in the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines: Â \r\n\r\nIf either parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed to the extent that the parent cannot provide a minimum level of support for himself or herself and his or her children when he or she is physically and mentally capable of doing go, and the court finds that the parentâ€™s voluntary unemployment or underemployment is the result of a parentâ€™s bad faith or deliberate suppression of income to avoid or minimize his or her child support obligation, child support may be calculated based on the parentâ€™s potential, rather than actual income. Potential income may not be imputed to a parent who is physically or mentally incapacitated or is caring for a child who is under the age of three years and or whom support is being determined. \r\n\r\nChild Support Guidelines, 2003 Ann. R. (N.C.) 33, 35 (2003) (cited in Cook v. Cook, 583 S.E.2d 696, 698 (2003)).\r\nBefore earning capacity may be used as the basis of an award, there must be a showing that the actions which reduced the partyâ€™s income were taken in bad faith, to avoid family responsibilities.Â  Pataky v. Pataky, 585 S.E.2d 404, 415 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003) (citing Bowers v. Bowers, 541 S.E.2d 508 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001)); Sharpe v. Nobles, 493 S.E.2d 288 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nIn Florida, \r\n\r\n[i]ncome on a monthly basis shall be imputed to an unemployed or underemployed parent when such employment or underemployment is found to be voluntary on that parentâ€™s part, absent physical or mental incapacity or other circumstances over which the parent has no control. In the event of such voluntary unemployment or underemployment, the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent shall be determined based upon his or her recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing earnings level in the community; however, the court may refuse to impute income to a primary residential parent if the court finds it necessary for the parent to stay home with the child. \r\n\r\nFla. Stat. Â§ 61.30(2)(b) (2005).\r\nFloridaâ€™s standard for imputing income requires the family court to set forth specific findings on earning potential, source of income imputed and actual income. Â See Alich v. Clapp, 926 So. 2d 467, 468 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (holding the family court erred in imputing income where no evidence supported finding).Â  The family court may only impute a level of income supported by the evidence of employment potential and probable earnings based on history, qualifications, and prevailing wages. Id.; see Edel v. Walker, 927 So. 2d 989, 990 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (finding record was sufficient to support family court findings of imputed income); Morin v. Morin, 923 So. 2d 582, 584 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (concluding family court erred in imputing income at level greater than level ever earned during the marriage). \r\nVirginia adheres to similar evidentiary requirements. In Mir v. Mir, 571 S.E.2d 299, 301 (Va. Ct. App. 2002), the court held evidence was insufficient to support finding the former husband was voluntarily unemployed or to impute $5600.00 monthly income for purposes of child support.Â  Nothing in the record suggested the husband ever made monthly income in the imputed amount or demonstrated jobs were available that would generate such an income.Â  Id. at 303.Â  Additionally, evidence indicated the husband had health problems preventing him from working longer hours or doing other jobs.Â  Id.Â  The court concluded the manner of imputation and the amount were inconsistent with the evidence in the record and remanded to the family court for further consideration.Â  Id. at 304. \r\nIn Hatloy v. Hatloy, 588 S.E.2d 389, 390 (Va. Ct. App. 2003), the court held the evidentiary burden was satisfied that former husbandâ€™s inability to pay his support obligation was not due to his own voluntary act.Â  Husband had previously worked for AOL, earning $55,070.00 yearly but was terminated through no fault of his own. Id.Â  Though the husband sought employment with other high tech industries, he testified that no jobs were available to him at his level of education. Id.Â  Consequently, he returned to work in the hospitality industry, earning a salary based on profits of a seasonal recreational resort. Id.Â  The venture lost money during the first year, but the husband anticipated drawing a salary of $1000.00 per month in the near future. Id. at 391.Â  The appellate court affirmed the family courtâ€™s imputation of $1600.00 per month income rather than the amount previously earned from AOL. Id. at 392.\r\nThe Virginia Court of Appeals refused to impute income to a former wife in determining the parentsâ€™ child support obligations.Â  In Budnick v. Budnick, 595 S.E.2d 50, 59 (Va. Ct. App. 2004), the husband argued wifeâ€™s refusal to accept a job transfer to a different geographical area constituted voluntary unemployment and the resulting loss of income should be imputed to her at the salary she would have earned.Â  When wifeâ€™s position was terminated and she was asked to relocate, the partiesâ€™ daughter was a senior in high school and their son was enrolled in special education classes. Â The court found, â€œno authority for a per se rule which would hold that a supporting spouse always becomes voluntarily underemployed or unemployed when he or she refuses to accept an offer of comparable employment in another geographical location.â€ Id. (quotingÂ  Reece v. Reece, 470, S.E.2d 148, 151 (Va. Ct. App. 1996)).Â  Moreover, â€œwhether failure to relocate constitutes voluntary unemployment or underemployment, sufficient to justify imputing income is a matter for a trial court to determine on the particular facts of the case before it.â€ Id. Â \r\nVirginiaâ€™s child support guidelines, like North Carolinaâ€™s, specifically articulate a good faith basis for determining the voluntariness of unemployment or underemployment.Â  The statute reads, in pertinent part: â€œ[A]ny consideration of imputed income based on a change in a partyâ€™s employment shall be evaluated with consideration of the good faith and reasonableness of employment decisions made by the party . . . .â€Â  Va. Code. Ann. Â§ 20-108.1 (2006).\r\nUnder South Carolina law, where an obligor voluntarily lessens his or her earning capacity, this court will closely scrutinize the facts to determine earning potential, rather than actual income. Camp v. Camp, 269 S.C. 173, 174, 236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977); Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 363, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  However, the failure to reach full earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically equate to voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed. Â Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 488-89, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Instead, when actual income versus earning capacity is at issue, the court should closely examine the payorâ€™s good faith and reasonable explanation for the decreased income. Â Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 281, 609 S.E.2d 821, 828, (Ct. App. 2005), cert. granted, March 23, 2006. Furthermore, lack of evidence indicating Â Â unemployment or underemployment resulted from any wrongdoing or was motivated by desire to avoid support obligations is at least persuasive the Â Â unemployment or underemployment is less than voluntary. Mazzone, 341 S.C. at 209, 532 S.E.2d at 893. Â That Husband had at times earned incomes in the range of $100,000.00-$200,000.00 does not warrant the imputation of income in that range without evidence showing his â€œfailure to make additional income was due to any wrongdoing on his part or motivated by a desire to decrease his support obligation.â€ Arnal, 363 S.C. at 281, 609 S.E.2d at 828 (citing Mazzone, 341 S.C. at 209, 532 S.E. 2d at 893). Â Wife presented no evidence that any jobs for which Husband is qualified exist or are available in the community. Availability of employment in the community commensurate with the partyâ€™s education and occupational history is, likewise, relevant to the inquiry of voluntariness. See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720; Robinson, 319 S.C. at 362, 461 S.E.2d at 398. Â Finally, Husbandâ€™s poor health, combined with the fact he is making some efforts to either secure employment or establish a business persuade us that his continued unemployment or underemployment is not entirely voluntary.Â  Earning potential, impaired by age or health, is relevant for imputing income. See Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 359 S.C. 614, 630, 598 S.E.2d 310, 319 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn the case sub judice, the family court judge determined that Husband was â€œeither not employed or significantly underemployed,â€ and imputed $100,000 in income to Husband. The judgeâ€™s order indicates he based the imputed income amount on evidence he found credible. Wifeâ€™s expert witness, Ron Morgan, a telecommunications recruiter, testified as to available jobs in the telecommunications industry which offered salaries in the range of $100,000.00-$200,000.00.Â  Morgan explained his conclusions about potential jobs were derived from computer generated print outs from his recruiting companyâ€™s database and an outside database.Â  In addition, he reviewed Husbandâ€™s New South â€œbio.â€ However, few, if any of the positions Morgan identified presented opportunities at the senior executive level. Â Moreover, the positions Morgan observed were located in Tennessee, California, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Colorado, Washington, and Arkansas, all of which would require Husbandâ€™s relocation outside the community in which he currently lives and away from his three minor children.Â  Morganâ€™s testimony confirmed the telecommunications industry was depressed at the time of filing, and the climate for job opportunities in the industry in 2001 and 2002 was â€œflat.â€ Morgan opined it would take someone â€œlooking eight to ten hours per day, everyday, full timeâ€ to find reemployment in telecommunications. \r\nHusband stated he was seeking employment in the film industry.Â  He believed looking to the telecommunications industry for employment would be futile.Â  He maintained the only position available to him would be a sales or technician position at a salary of $50,000.00, and that if he took such a position his prospects for returning to senior executive position in telecommunications would be â€œover.â€Â  Husband declared he contacted all of the companies listed in Morganâ€™s client database. Â He did not contact local independent telephone companies to inquire about positions because he had no experience in that particular area.Â  Nor did Husband seek employment with other telecommunications entities in South Carolina that were former competitors because he surmised they would not consider hiring him. Additionally, he turned down a job as a CEO of a school renovation project. Husband testified he could obtain a job earning $50,000.00 annually and added he was involved in establishing a new company. \r\nEven if senior executive positions were determined to be available in the Greenville area, evidence suggests Husbandâ€™s poor health would prevent him from working at the level of intensity his previous occupation required. Before his termination from New South in 2001, Husband was working fourteen to sixteen-hour days, seven days a week.Â  The family court judge observed at trial that Husbandâ€™s behavior was not consistent with a senior executiveâ€™s behavior, noting Husband was habitually late and appeared â€œlethargic, either from pain or medication.â€Â  The judge indicated â€œHusband walked with the assistance of a cane and outwardly exhibited pain.â€ Â Â \r\nHusband had severe back problems from an injury in 1985.Â  A flare up in 1999 resulted in Husbandâ€™s regular use of pain medication and his eventual addiction to oxycontin.Â  Though Husband denied addiction and referred to his dependency as habituation, his medication use, nevertheless, interfered with Â his work and apparently led to his termination from New South in January of 2001.Â  Husband had back surgery in May of 2001 but continued to experience problems associated with medication.Â  Wife stated he attempted rehabilitation in Florida in October of 2001.Â  Under direct examination by her attorney, Wife testified to the following about Husbandâ€™s health:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       You told us about his health, with respect to his back. Otherwise,\r\n         how has his physical health been, prior to the back problem.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Itâ€™s horrible.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q;\r\n       Prior to the back problems?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Oh, it is - - it was pretty good. I mean, his back would go out, you know once a year, then it was once a month, you know. I mean, itâ€™s degenerative disk problem [sic], you know?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       Other than, the back problems?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       You know, he had allergies. And heâ€™d get bad colds, heâ€™d get run down or whatever, but it was good.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      . . . . \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       And how would you describeâ€”other than what youâ€™ve described, how would you describe your husbandâ€™s psychological demeanor, prior to this last few years?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       You know, heâ€™s always been a little crazy and different. But he was, you know, kind of normal, off center.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Did he have anything that he took medication for?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, he took Klonopin forâ€”well heâ€™s taken Klonopin, since Jackson, Mississippi, for anxiety.Â  Heâ€™s got, I would say, an anxiety disorder.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       In this case, we took a deposition of his internist, Dr. Grover?[2]\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Right.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       And weâ€™re going to submit that, as part of this record today by stipulation.Â  Dr. Grover generally described him, as not being very healthy?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Right. He said, he was in pretty poor health.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Is that consistent, with your current observations?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n      Yes, it is.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       And during the course of this litigation, has [Husband] discussed his health with you, on multiple occasions?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yeah, he gives me a pity party, every time I talk to him, about how heâ€™s broken a rib, or heâ€™s broken a toe, or heâ€™s fallen down another flight of stairs.Â  Heâ€™s very accident prone. Heâ€”in fact, I understand he just fell down his attorneyâ€™s stairs, last week.Â  Heâ€™s always got something wrong.Â  He said he had pneumonia; he had SARS, one time.Â  He had, you knowâ€”he just, heâ€™s just got something all the time.Â  Heâ€™s, a hypochondriac.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       Despite all these issues, are you aware of anything that would keep him from working?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nConcluding from the testimony and observations at trial that the frenzied pace of Husbandâ€™s efforts to save New South likely exacerbated his physical impairment, increased his reliance on pain medication, and accelerated his overall decline, it is doubtful he could realistically be expected to return to the demanding work environment of a senior executive at this time.Â  In light of the circumstances of the case, the family court judge erred in the amount imputed to Husband.Â  Concomitantly, we reverse the amount of imputation of income and remand for a calculation of imputed income consistent with this opinion. Â No evidence in the record substantiates that jobs exist in the community, commensurate with Husbandâ€™s qualifications and experience, warranting the imputed amount. â€œ[T]he court should determine the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent based on that parentâ€™s recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community.â€ 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(b) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added). \r\nII.&nbsp; Marital Assets Division\r\nWith regard to the division of marital assets, Husband argues the family court erred by (1) assigning equal value to each partyâ€™s contributions to the marital assets; (2) failing to consider he was forced to invade his property award to provide temporary support for Wife; and (3) awarding Wife the marital home as part of the equitable distribution of marital assets. \r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code requires that â€œ[i]n making apportionment, the court must give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriateâ€ to all of the fifteen enumerated factors. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2005).Â  When distributing marital property in a divorce action, the family court should consider all fifteen factors set forth in the applicable statute. Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285,Â­Â­Â­ 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005). Â In reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment, an appellate courtâ€™s role is to examine the fairness of the apportionment as a whole.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001). Â â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€ Â Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001). Â The family court has broad discretion in determining how marital property is to be valued and distributed. Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995); Phillips v. Phillips, 290 S.C. 455, 457, 351 S.E.2d 178, 180 (Ct. App. 1986). Â Therefore, the court may use any reasonable means to divide the property equitably, and its judgment will only be disturbed where abuse of discretion is found. Â Murphy, 319 S.C. at 329, 461 S.E.2d at 41-42; Barrett v. Barrett, 290 S.C. 453, 454, 351 S.E.2d 177 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\nA. Contributions to the Marriage\r\nSection 20-7-474 of the South Carolina Code provides that, in determining the value of each partyâ€™s respective contributions, the court:\r\n\r\n(1) shall make findings of fact from credible evidence of the values of property and services, if any;\r\n(2) is empowered to take judicial notice of official reports of the federal and state governments, including official bulletins, publications, and reports of general public interest where these reports are made and published by authority of law or have been adopted by state statute;\r\n(3) has the authority to appoint experts as necessary for the purpose of valuation of property and contributions and to assess the cost against any or all parties to the action.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-474 (Supp. 2005).\r\nThe doctrine of equitable distribution is based on the recognition that marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership. Â Morris v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525, 530, 517 S.E.2d 720, 723 (Ct. App. 1999); Walker v. Walker, 295 S.C. 286, 288, 368 S.E.2d 89, 90 (Ct. App.1988). Â It is well settled that in making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must (1) identify the marital property, real and personal, to be divided between the parties, (2) determine the fair market value of the property so identified, (3) identify the proportionate contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to the acquisition of the marital property, and (4) provide for an equitable division of the marital property. Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996). Â Upon dissolution of a marriage, property acquired during the marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, regardless of which spouse holds legal title. Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 197, 612 S.E.2d 707, 715 (Ct. App. 2005). The ultimate goal of apportionment is to divide the marital estate, as a whole, in a manner which fairly reflects each\r\nspouseâ€™s contribution to the economic partnership and also the relative effects of ending that partnership on each of the parties. Â Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 298, 372 S.E.2d 107, 112 (Ct. App. 1988). Â The family court has wide discretion in determining the contributions made by each spouse to the marital property. Ball v. Ball, 314 S.C. 445, 448 445 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1994).\r\nHere, the family court judge properly concluded the contributions of each party, when considered as a whole, were equal in value. Â Though Husband unquestionably made the majority of the direct contributions to the marriage in terms of tangible assets, Wife made the majority of indirect contributions. In the beginning, both parties worked and contributed their respective salaries and income in support of the marriage. Â When Husband had an opportunity for professional advancement, Wife suspended her career and relocated. Â Wife worked at each new location until children were born and both parties agreed she would not continue outside employment.Â  She maintained a household, enhanced the value of their home, performed social roles that benefited Husbandâ€™s business, and had primary responsibility for the care of their three children.Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s ruling in the instant case is consistent with our precedent.Â  We have previously held the family courtâ€™s equal division of marital property was fair, even though the husband provided the majority of the income, where the wife was a homemaker and also worked outside the home, and her income assisted in meeting the familyâ€™s needs. Kirsch v. Kirsch, 299 S.C. 201, 203, 383 S.E.2d 254, 255 (Ct. App. 1989). Â Similarly, we have concluded equal apportionment of the marital estate between the parties was equitable, even though most of the appreciation in the value of the assets was attributable to the husbandâ€™s earnings and income during the marriage, where the wife faithfully performed her homemaker role during the marriage under the most trying of circumstances, and gave up her own career and dutifully contributed her labor to provide a good marital home for her husband. Johnson, 296 S.C. at 298-99, 372 S.E.2d at 112; see also Harlan v. Harlan, 300 S.C. 537, 541, 389 S.E.2d 165, 168 (Ct. App. 1990) (awarding wife fifty percent interest in the marital residence was not error where the marriage lasted eighteen years, the wife worked a significant\r\nportion of that time, and the wife was also the primary caretaker of the children); Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 200, 363 S.E.2d 404, 408 (Ct. App. 1987) (awarding each party fifty percent\r\nof marital property despite expertâ€™s testimony that wifeâ€™s contributions to accumulation of marital assets did not exceed thirty-seven percent was not error; trial court was not bound to accept expertâ€™s testimony regarding wifeâ€™s contributions, and wifeâ€™s testimony about her contributions indicated that during an eighteen-year marriage, wife provided homemaker services and on occasion worked either part-time or full-time, contributing monies she earned to support family); Leatherwood v. Leatherwood, 293 S.C. 148, 149, 359 S.E.2d 89, 90 (Ct. App. 1987) (awarding wife fifty percent of marital home, and fifty\r\npercent of joint savings account was not error; although husband made greater monetary contribution throughout marriage, wife did work at beginning of marriage, contributed her services as homemaker, and was therefore entitled to equitable interest in property acquired by wage-earner husband). \r\nThe family court judge did not err in finding each partyâ€™s contributions, when considered as a whole, were equal in value. Consequently, the disposition of marital assets on a generally equal basis was not an abuse of discretion.\r\nB.Â  Invasion of Husbandâ€™s Assets for Temporary Support\r\nHusband complains the family court erred in failing to consider that in order to pay Wife temporary support, he was forced to invade the assets he received as a result of equitable distribution. Husband avers as a consequence his marital property distribution was substantially reduced. \r\nFactors to be considered in making an alimony award include: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant. Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (Ct. App. 2005); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005). Generally, alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as practical, in the same position as enjoyed during the marriage. Id.; Johnson, 296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113. Â â€œAlimonyâ€ is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship. Craig, 365 S.C. at 292, 617 S.E.2d at 362. An award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of discretion. Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001); Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 155, 459 S.E.2d 892, 894-95 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe family court judge found no basis for retroactive modification in the amount of temporary support awarded to Wife during the pendency of this case. Â We agree.Â  Modification of alimony is within the sound discretion of family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse thereof. Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 236, 578 S.E.2d 3, 6 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThe April 10, 2002 temporary order incorporated the partiesâ€™ agreement as to both the support and mortgage payments. At that time, six months remained during which Husband received a net $15,000.00 income from the New South severance package. Husband agreed to make the monthly mortgage payment and pay Wife $7500.00 per month in family support. Husband requested relief on these issues in an amended motion on September 2, 2002, but failed to file a financial declaration or appear at the motion hearing. In its September 10, 2002 order, the family court reserved its ruling on modification of the April 10, 2002 temporary order pending review of Husbandâ€™s financial declaration.Â  By its order dated May 16, 2003, the family court found Husbandâ€™s monthly income had been reduced warranting a modification of the April 10, 2002 temporary order. Husband was ordered to continue paying the monthly mortgage obligation, but his spousal support was reduced to $3000.00 per month, taxable to Wife and deductible by Husband.Â  The September 10, 2003 order terminated Husbandâ€™s spousal support and reduced his monthly mortgage payment by one-half.Â  On final disposition, Wife was awarded the marital home and the responsibility for satisfying the mortgage debt. Wife did not seek permanent spousal support. \r\nHusband alleges Wife enjoyed a $75,000.00 income during the entire pendency of these proceedings.Â  However, according to the record, Wife only began work in April of 2003, more than a year after the commencement of this action and eleven months prior to the final hearing.Â  Additionally, Husband either overlooks or misrepresents other pertinent facts in his argument for retroactive modification.Â  The New South income from Husbandâ€™s severance package continued through September of 2002. By order of the family court, Husband was to pay Wife $3000.00 from May of 2003 until the September 2003 order terminating all spousal support and one-half of the mortgage payment.Â  At most, it appears Husband paid the $3000.00 for approximately five months, though he claims to have paid that amount monthly for a year and one-half.Â  Prior to May, 2003, the April 10, 2002 temporary order ($7500.00 family support and full mortgage payment) was still in effect, presumably due, in part, to Husbandâ€™s failure to file his financial declaration and failure to appear at the hearing on the motion requesting relief. \r\nWe discern nothing in the record to indicate the family court judge failed to consider the appropriate factors in determining temporary spousal support.Â  Section 20-3-130(B)(6) affords the family court broad discretion in awarding alimony and allows the court to fashion an alimony award which is just under the circumstances. Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 155, 459 S.E.2d 892, 895Ct. App. 1995). â€œOur inquiry on appeal is not whether the family court gave the same weight to particular factors as this court would have; rather, our inquiry extends only to whether the family court abused its considerable discretion in assigning weight to the applicable factors. Â No one factor is dispositive.â€ Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 631 S.E.2d 279, 284 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 186, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct, App. 2001)).\r\nC.&nbsp; Award of Marital Home to Wife\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding Wife the marital home as part of the equitable division of marital property. Â We disagree. \r\nThe disposition of the marital residence as part of the equitable distribution of marital assets is largely within the discretion of the family court. Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 542, 615 S.E.2d 98, 103 (2005); Nasser-Moghaddassi v Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 202, 612 S.E.2d 707, 718 (Ct. App. 2005). Â In order to effect an equitable apportionment, the family court may require the sale of marital property and a division of the proceeds. Wooten, 364 S.C. at 542, 615 S.E.2d at 103 (citing Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 360, 382 S.E.2d 741, 745 (1989)).Â  â€œAlthough the court is generally required to attempt an in-kind distribution of assets, an in-kind distribution of the marital home is not feasible.â€ Nasser-Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. at 203, 612 S.E.2d at 718. â€œAccordingly, the court may either award the home to one of the parties, or order the home sold and the proceeds distributed.â€ Id.Â  Additionally, in deciding the disposition of the marital home, the family court must consider and give appropriate weight to the fifteen statutory factors. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2005).\r\nIn his final order the family court judge observed: \r\n\r\n[t]here is compelling evidence to support Wife retaining the marital home as part of her share of the marital estate. This compelling evidence includes the desirability of maintaining the home for the minor children. With minor children who are 8, 5, and 4 years old, in a safe and comfortable home well-suited to their needs, which is the only home known to them, avoiding a sale of the marital home will enhance their stability and promote their best interests. \r\n\r\nConclusively, the family court judge, having given appropriate weight and consideration to the relevant statutory factors, did not abuse his discretion in awarding the marital residence to Wife. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Child Support Calculation\r\nHusband challenges the family courtâ€™s calculation of his child support obligation on the ground it erred by imputing income to Husband in the amount of $100,000.00.Â  We have concluded the imputed amount was in error. Â Therefore, Husband is entitled to have child support recalculated and adjusted accordingly upon the family courtâ€™s reassessment of Husbandâ€™s imputed income. \r\nHusband contends the family court erred by failing to consider substantial private school tuition in calculating child support under the child support guidelines. Â Â \r\nIn determining the amount of child support, the family court is generally required to follow the child support guidelines. Sexton v. Sexton, 321 S.C. 487, 488, 469 S.E.2d 608, 609 (Ct. App. 1996). Â Although the family court may deviate from the guidelines, any deviation must be justified and should be the exception rather than the rule. Id. Â Though the guidelines govern all actions involving questions of child support, the family court retains a certain amount of discretion when making the final award. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 13, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996). \r\nâ€œIn any proceeding for the award of child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines required under Section 43-5-580(b) is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-852(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  When a child support award varies significantly from the amount resulting from the application of the guidelines, the family court must make specific, written findings of those facts upon which it bases its conclusion supporting that award. Â Among the factors which the family court may consider to justify deviating from the guidelines are the educational expenses for the child or children, including those incurred for private school tuition and related costs. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4710 (Supp. 2005). \r\nIn this case, the family court judge noted the application of the guidelines does not contemplate private school tuition.Â  He found: \r\n\r\n[t]he parties have historically placed their children in private school. Both parties find and believe private school is in the best interest of the children. Private school is within the financial ability of the parties. The annual tuition costs for all three children is currently $9,400.00. Wife requests Husbandâ€™s participation in this expense, and for Husband to pay for miscellaneous fees, books, uniforms, and school lunches. \r\n\r\nConsequently, the family court judge ordered Husband to pay Wife, on a monthly basis, fifty-seven percent of the childrenâ€™s private school tuition only. The miscellaneous fees Wife requested were deemed to be items included in the child support guidelines calculations. The family court judgeâ€™s written findings clearly describe the nature and extent of the deviation and are sufficient to support this requirement. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband claims the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2005) of the South Carolina Code provides that â€œSuit money, including attorneyâ€™s fees, may be assessed for or against a party to an action brought in or subject to the jurisdiction of the family court.â€\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 553, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004); Bowen v Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272, (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court, in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standards of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). Â In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the family court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991); see also, Â Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 633, 598 S.E.2d 310, 320 (Ct. App. 2004) (refusing to find an abuse of discretion as to award of attorneyâ€™s fees when the family court analyzed each of the factors, detailed its findings in its final order, and those findings were supported by affidavits). \r\nIn his final order, the family court judge concluded: \r\n\r\nWife obtained beneficial results from this litigation.Â  She secured the best interest of her children and obtained significant economic advantage as the result of the distribution of the marital assets and the payment of support. While both Husband and Wife have significant assets from which to pay their fees and suit costs, any fees or costs paid by Wife will adversely impact the partiesâ€™ children and their standard of living. \r\n\r\nThe judge evaluated the reasonableness of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, her attorneyâ€™s extensive experience and standing in the Bar, and the number of hours involved in this litigation against the backdrop of Husbandâ€™s failure to cooperate with discovery, failure to cooperate with the guardian ad litem, and apparent failure to cooperate with his own attorney. We, therefore, affirm the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nWIFEâ€™S APPEAL\r\nI.&nbsp; Future Profits from Sale of Marital Home\r\nWife asserts the family court erred in awarding Husband a share in the profits of the sale of the marital home if the sale occurred within six years from the date of the divorce decree and exceeded the $700,000.00 value of the home. \r\nFamily court judges have wide discretion in determining how marital property is to be distributed; they may use any reasonable means to divide property equitably, and their judgment will not be disturbed absent abuse of discretion. Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 341, 569 S.E.2d 393, 400 (Ct. App. 2002); Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (citing Pierson v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 254, 417 S.E.2d 604, 608 (Ct. App. 1992)). Â There are many factors which the family court may consider in the apportionment of marital property. On review, the appellate court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, the fact the appellate court may have weighed specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant. Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 300, 596 S.E.2d 505, 514 (Ct. App. 2004); Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 89, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996) affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998); Johnson v. Johnson, Â 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988)\r\nThe value of the marital home was the focus of considerable disagreement. Wife offered the testimony of a certified appraiser who opined the home had a fair market value of $700,000.00. Husband maintained the value was more accurately reflected by the sales price at which the home was marketed prior to this action. Â He believed the home had a fair market value of $825,000.00.Â  In fashioning a remedy to account for the disputed value and potential additional equity in the home, the family court judge placed a condition on the award of the marital residence to Wife as part of equitable distribution.Â  Given the judgeâ€™s expressed concern that the property may be undervalued, he provided for Husbandâ€™s share of profits from the sale of the marital home if the sale exceeded the Wifeâ€™s valuation of $700,000.00 and occurred within six years from the date of the final order. Â Wife and Husband were to share equally in the profits, less the value of any direct contributions Wife made to the appreciation of the home.Â  The family court retained jurisdiction to determine the value of any such contributions should the home sell within the six year period. \r\nWife argues this apportionment constituted a distribution of future non-marital assets that the family court had no authority to value or apportion. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005) (â€œThe court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital property.â€)Â  We disagree. If, as the family court judge suspected, there was a difference between Wifeâ€™s valuation of the marital home and its true fair market value, then that difference, represented by profit if the home is sold for over $700,000.00, was additional equity in the home and subject to equitable distribution. If the home was undervalued, then the additional equity existed at the time the marital litigation commenced and was, therefore, marital property subject to equitable distribution. Section 20-7-473 defines marital property as â€œall real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation, regardless of how legal title is held.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005).\r\nAwarding Husband a share in future profits prevents any injustice that might result from undervaluation. As Husband points out, the remedy provided is to ensure a fair determination of Husbandâ€™s additional equity in the home and to provide for its distribution. The family court reasonably considered the unique circumstances in this case. The judge was within his discretion in fashioning a remedy to preclude potential inequity. The family court did not err in awarding Husband a share in the profits of the sale of the marital home if the sale occurred within six years from the date of the divorce decree and exceeded the $700,000.00 value of the home.\r\nII.&nbsp; Classification of Jewelry as Marital Property\r\nWife argues the family court erred in classifying all jewelry as marital property. We disagree. \r\nGenerally, property acquired by either party by gift from a party other than the spouse is nonmarital property. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1) (Supp. 2005). Â Nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if: (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Pool, 321 S.C. at 86, 467 S.E.2d at 756.). Â Transmutation of nonmarital property into marital property, for equitable distribution purposes, is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case. Id. Â The spouse claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the marriage has the burden of proving that the property is part of the marital estate. Â If the spouse carries this burden, he or she establishes a prima facie case that the property is marital property.Â  If the opposing spouse then wishes to claim the property so identified is not part of the marital estate, he or she has the burden of presenting evidence to establish its nonmarital character. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 111 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThe family court judge instructed that Wife bore the burden of proving the jewelry in existence at the time of filing the marital litigation was owned prior to the marriage. Wife met that burden. Once it was established the jewelry was premarital, Husband bore the burden of proving transmutation in order for the jewelry to be considered marital.Â  Husband met that burden by demonstrating that â€œthe premarital items were mixed with other items of jewelry and modified using marital funds.â€ Wife did not refute Husbandâ€™s evidence. Therefore, the family court appropriately declared the jewelry marital property. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Jurisdiction to Issue Supplemental Order \r\nWife contends the family court judge did not reserve jurisdiction to issue the Supplemental Order awarding guardian ad litem fees. Â The order was issued on September 29, 2004, after both the final order dated March 11, 2004 and the order addressing post trial motions dated August 2, 2004. Wife relies on our holding in Heins v. Heins where, pursuant to Rule 59(e) SCRCP, we held the family court did not have authority to alter or amend a judgment sua sponte once the judgment was more than ten days old.Â  364 S.C. 146, 157, 543 S.E.2d 224, 229 (Ct. App. 2001). Â We find Wifeâ€™s reliance on Heins in the present case misplaced. \r\nFirst, we note the final order dated March 11, 2004 contains a provision retaining and reserving jurisdiction to issue any and all orders necessary to effectuate the terms of the order and to effectuate compliance with the terms of this order. Â Arguably, guardian ad litem fees were not terms of the March 11, 2004 order, but, in light of the judgeâ€™s Supplemental Order and recent legislation, this court determines the exclusion of the term for payment of guardian fees was an oversight.Â  \r\nAn award of guardian ad litem fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 196, 612 S.E.2d 707, 714 (Ct. App. 2005). Section 20-7-1545 of the South Carolina Code provides that, in a private action in which custody or visitation is an issue, a guardian ad litem may be appointed when both parties consent to the appointment. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1545 (Supp. 2005).Â  Additionally, section 20-7-1553 requires:\r\n\r\n(A) At the time of appointment of a guardian ad litem, the family court judge must set forth the method and rate of compensation for the guardian ad litem, including an initial authorization of a fee based on the facts of the case. If the guardian ad litem determines that it is necessary to exceed the fee initially authorized by the judge, the guardian must provide notice to both parties and obtain the judgeâ€™s written authorization of the consent of both parties to charge more than the initially authorized fee. \r\n    \r\n(B) A guardian appointed by the court is entitled to reasonable compensation, subject to the review and approval of the court. In determining the reasonableness of the fees and costs, the court must take into account:\r\n(1) the complexity of the issues before the court;\r\n(2) the contentiousness of the litigation;\r\n(3) the time expended by the guardian;\r\n(4) the expenses reasonably incurred by the guardian;\r\n(5) the financial ability of each party to pay fees and costs; and\r\n(6) any other factors the court considers necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1553 (A-B) (Supp. 2005).\r\nIn light of the legislatureâ€™s direction for compensating guardians ad litem, the judgeâ€™s omission of a provision for guardianâ€™s fees was an oversight. Â Rule 60(a), SCRCP, provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n[c]lerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, leave to correct the mistake must be obtained from the appellate court. The ending of a term of court or departure from the circuit shall not operate to deprive the trial judge of jurisdiction to correct such mistakes. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Therefore, the family court had jurisdiction to issue the September 29, 2004 Supplemental Order pursuant to Rule 60(a) SCRCP. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the ruling of the family court in regard to:\r\n\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  the partiesâ€™ contributions to the marriage; \r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  the invasion of Husbandâ€™s assets for temporary support;\r\n(3)Â Â Â Â  the award of the marital home to Wife; \r\n(4)Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s share of childrenâ€™s private school tuition;\r\n(5)Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s share in future profits from the sale of the Â Â  marital home;\r\n(6)Â Â Â Â  the classification of Wifeâ€™s jewelry as marital property; and\r\n(7)Â Â Â Â  the award of guardian fees in the Supplemental Order. \r\n\r\nWe reverse the holding of the family court in reference to the amountÂ of income imputed to Husband and remand for a determination consistent with this opinion as it relates to the calculation of the child support award. Â \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband left New South with a severance package which included, in addition to other benefits, a gross income of $500,000.00 to be paid over an eighteen-month period.Â  Parties initially agreed to use the after tax income from New South, which amounted to approximately $15,000.00 monthly, to pay the $3365.18 monthly mortgage payment on the marital home and to pay non-taxable family support to Wife in the amount of $7,500.00 per month. Husband received the balance for his use.Â  The agreement was formalized by Temporary Order of Judge Amy C. Sutherland, dated April 10, 2002.Â  At that time, only six months of income remained to be disbursed from the New South severance package.Â  Consequently, the provisions of the order allowed for additional temporary relief when the New South income ended. Â Subsequent orders dated September 10, 2002, May 16, 2003, and September 10, 2003, modified the original support agreement, eventually relieving Husband of spousal support and reducing his obligation under the marital home mortgage to one-half. \r\n[2] Dr. Groverâ€™s deposition was not included in the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4159","title":"State v.

Morgan, Â of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Thaddeus Curry appeals his convictions for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime in connection with the death of Heath Hamilton.Â  On appeal, Curry argues (1) the trial court erred in limiting the scope of his cross-examination of two co-defendants on sentencing exposure they faced for murder and other charges related to Hamiltonâ€™s death, and (2) the trial court erred in charging the jury on â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nShortly after midnight on March 18, 2003, Hamilton and Ronald Coursey drove to an apartment complex in Augusta, Georgia, to purchase marijuana.Â  In the apartment complexâ€™s parking lot, they encountered Anthony Savage and Curry and asked if they had any marijuana to sell.Â  Curry and Savage said they had no marijuana, but agreed to procure some and sell a quarter poundâ€™s worth to Hamilton and Coursey for $220.Â  \r\nHamilton and Coursey drove to an ATM and withdrew money to pay for the drugs.Â  Meanwhile, Curry, Savage, and Jeremy Simuel drove around Augusta looking for marijuana to sell to Hamilton and Coursey.Â  They were unsuccessful.Â  When they all returned to the apartment complex, Hamilton and Coursey followed Curry, Savage, and Simuel to Simuelâ€™s apartment.Â  Hamilton and Coursey waited outside the apartment while the others went inside and closed the door. They were soon informed the transaction would occur later.Â  \r\nHamilton and Coursey left the apartment complex and went to Hamiltonâ€™s home in Beech Island in Aiken County, where they smoked marijuana and waited until Curry and Savage called.Â  The parties spoke by phone and agreed to meet at a gas station in Beech Island.Â  Although Curry, Savage, and Simuel failed to procure marijuana to sell Hamilton and Coursey, they apparently intended to meetÂ  under the guise of a drug sale in order to rob Hamilton and Coursey. \r\nHamilton and Coursey met Curry and Savage in a dark area behind the gas station.Â  Curry and Savage exited their car, where Simuel remained seated.Â  They approached the car in which Hamilton and Coursey waited.Â  Savage told Hamilton they did not have any marijuana, but demanded to see the money.Â  Within minutes, Hamilton was shot and killed while still seated in his vehicle with Coursey.Â  Curry and Savage fled in the waiting car driven by\r\nSimuel.\r\nCurry, Savage, and Simuel were charged in connection with the robbery and Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  At Curryâ€™s trial, Coursey, Savage, and Simuel implicated Curry in Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  Coursey testified he had not met Curry, Savage, or Simuel before the night of the murder.Â  He stated they first met around midnight in the dark parking lot of the apartment complex, a short time later at the apartment complex, and finally in the dark parking lot of the gas station where Hamilton was killed.Â  He testified he called 911 after the shooting but was unable to provide many details about the perpetrators, telling the 911 dispatcher, â€œI donâ€™t know, itâ€™s dark[,] man, I just donâ€™t know.â€Â  However, at trial Coursey testified Curry had the gun in his hand and that Savage never had possession of the gun.Â  Moreover, he unequivocally identified Curry as the shooter.Â  \r\nSavage testified Curry carried a gun with him on the night of the murder and claimed he saw Curry fire the gun three or four times at the murder scene.Â  Savage further testified that after the shooting, Curry and he fled in a car driven by Simuel.Â  According to Savage, Curry exclaimed, â€œI think I dome capped him,â€ implying he shot Hamilton in the head.Â  Savage testified Curry later told him he had disposed of the murder weapon.Â  Simuel largely corroborated Savageâ€™s testimony but did not provide an eyewitness account of Curry firing the gun.Â  Â Â \r\nCurry sought to question the motives and biases of Simuel and Savage by cross-examining them on the possible sentences they faced in connection with Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  When Curry questioned Simuel about the possible sentences he faced, the trial court sustained the Stateâ€™s objection and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony.Â  \r\nPrior to Savageâ€™s testimony, Curry asked the trial court in limine to allow impeachment of Savage on bias and motive by questioning him about the possible sentences he faced for charges related to Hamiltonâ€™s death.Â  The trial court denied his request. Â In reaching its decision, the trial court considered Curryâ€™s request in light of State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002), and stated:\r\n\r\nUnder [the circumstances in Mizzell], sir, part of the problem I think in that case was that, as I read it, the witness was given an offer to plead to one particular charge versus the potential sentence, the maximum sentence on the other charges that the defendant would have faced had she been convicted or tried on the original charges, and we donâ€™t have that here.Â  Thereâ€™s no deal between the State at all.\r\n\r\nCurry later sought clarification, asking, â€œSo the Court is ruling that he says he has no deal, then I am prohibited from asking about these penalties that heâ€™s facing, is that correct?â€Â  The trial court responded affirmatively. Â The trial court elaborated, â€œWeâ€™re not going to bring him out here to elicit whether or not he knows what his potential sentences are.Â  As I understand it thereâ€™s no negotiations or deals between the State and this particular witness.â€Â Â  Â \r\nThe jury convicted Curry on both charges.Â  He received concurrent prison sentences of five years for the firearms charge and life in prison for the murder charge.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Scope of Cross-examination \r\nCurry argues the trial court committed reversible error in denying his request to cross-examine Simuel and Savage concerning possible sentences he faced in connection with Hamiltonâ€™s death. [1]Â  We disagree.\r\nTo constitute error, a ruling to admit or exclude evidence must affect a substantial right. Â Rule 103(a), SCRE; State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609 S.E.2d 520, 524 (2005).Â  However, error is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the trialâ€™s outcome. Â State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  In considering whether error is harmless, a caseâ€™s particular facts must be considered along with various factors including:\r\n\r\n. . . the importance of the witnessâ€™ testimony in the prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.\r\n\r\nState v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, 482, 445 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1994).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€ State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989). Â A violation of a defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness is not per se reversible error if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994). \r\nIn this case, Curry relied on State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002), in support of his argument that he should be allowed to cross-examine his co-defendants as to any possible sentences they faced in connection with Hamiltonâ€™s death.Â  In Mizzell, our Supreme Court found error in the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude evidence of possible sentences faced by Mizzellâ€™s co-defendant where the parties faced the same charges and the co-defendant had not yet pled guilty or reached a plea agreement with the State.Â  The court found:\r\n\r\nThe fact the witness has yet to reach a plea bargain or been found guilty should not prevent the admission of such evidence. The lack of a negotiated plea, if anything, creates a situation where the witness is more likely to engage in biased testimony in order to obtain a future recommendation for leniency. \r\n\r\nId. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318. Â Â \r\nSimilar to the scenario in Mizzell, Curryâ€™s co-defendants faced the same charges as Curry and had not pled guilty or reached a plea agreement.Â  The trial court refused to allow Curry to cross-examine his co-defendants on the possible sentences they faced because Savage and Simuel had not pled guilty or reached a plea agreement with the State.Â  We find this ruling contradicts the settled law established in Mizzell.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in barring the cross-examination of Simuel and Savage on the possible sentences they faced.\r\nHowever, the refusal to allow Curry to cross-examine his co-defendants on any possible sentences they faced in connection with Hamiltonâ€™s death was harmless.Â  At trial, the testimony given by the co-defendants was not the only evidence of Curryâ€™s involvement in the shooting of Hamilton.Â  Ronald Coursey, the other victim of the robbery, unequivocally identified Curry as the shooter.Â  He testified:\r\n\r\nCoursey: And then the next I knew, he came up, Mr. Curry, over there had the gun.\r\nQ: You saw Mr. Curry with the gun?\r\nA: Yes, sir, he had the gun the whole time.\r\nQ: What did he do with the gun?\r\nA: â€¦ he started shooting.\r\nâ€¦\r\nQ:Â  Could you describe the gun?\r\nA: â€¦it was either automatic or semi-automatic.Â  It went off real fast.\r\nQ: And how was [Curry] holding it?\r\nA: In one hand.\r\nQ: Okay.Â  And so what did he say when he pulled the gun out?\r\nA: I donâ€™t think he said anything, it just happened too fast and he shot and hit [Hamilton] in the head.\r\nâ€¦\r\nQ: Did you see who pulled the trigger?\r\nA: Yes, sir. It was Mr. Curry over there.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in addition to Coursey, Javon Rushon provided the following testimony regarding a conversation he overheard between Curry and Savage regarding the murder weapon:\r\n\r\nQ: What specifically did you hear Mr. Curryâ€”what if anything, did you hear Mr. Curry mention about the gun?\r\nA: â€œThey would never find it.â€Â  â€œThe hammer came off of it.â€Â  You know, â€œIt was chopped up.â€\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Rushon further clarified that it was in fact Curry who was talking about the gun, stating â€œThaddeus Curry was talking to [Savage] about it.â€Â  \r\nThe testimony of the co-defendants, Simuel and Savage, was merely cumulative to that given by Coursey and Rushon.Â  As a result, Curryâ€™s guilt or innocence did not hinge solely on the testimony of his co-defendants; the testimony of Coursey and Rushon provided other competent evidence upon which a rational verdict of guilty could be based.Â  Therefore, as the error on the part of the trial judge in limiting the scope of cross-examination could not have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial, it was harmless.[2]\r\nII.&nbsp; Jury Charge\r\nCurry next argues the trial court erred in its charge on â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA charge is sufficient if, when considered as a whole, it covers the law applicable to the case.â€Â  State v. Ezell, 321 S.C. 421, 425, 468 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œThe substance of the law is what must be charged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.â€Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 318-19, 577 S.E.2d 460, 464 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œJury instructions must be considered as a whole and, if as a whole, they are free from error, any isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 526, 377 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1989).Â  \r\nAt trial, Curry argued the courtâ€™s proposed charge on â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory lacked â€œsufficient emphasis on the issue of probable or natural consequence . . . .â€Â  Based on language drawn from State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 534 S.E.2d 268 (2000), Curry suggested the following charge:\r\n\r\n[I]f two or more combine together to commit an unlawful act and a crime is committed by one of the actors as a probable and natural consequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, all present and participating in the unlawful undertaking are as guilty as the one who committed the act.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe trial judge rejected Curryâ€™s proposed charge.Â  He subsequently charged the jury twice on â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory.Â  The first charge, which he gave along with the other charges prior to jury deliberations, stated:\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to charge you now that if a crime is committed by two or more people who are acting together in committing a crime, the act of one is the act of all.Â  If a person joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose, he is criminally responsible for everything done by the other person which occurs as a natural consequence of the acts done in carrying out the common plan and purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the jury left to deliberate, Curry renewed his objection to the charge on the basis that â€œthe instruction as given did not convey to the jury that the act in this case, a homicide, must be a natural or probable consequence of the preexisting plan in order . . . for the theory of the hand of one, hand of all to apply. . . .â€ (emphasis added).Â  The trial judge noted Curryâ€™s exception.\r\nDuring its deliberation, the jury asked the court to re-charge â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  The court brought the jury out and charged accomplice liability as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n[I]f a crime is committed by two or more people who are acting together in committing a crime, the act of one is the act of all.Â  I tell you further that a person who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is criminally responsible for everything done by the other person which occurs as a natural consequence of the acts done in carrying out the common plan or purpose.Â  When two or more people are acting together â€¦ assisting each other in committing the offense the act of one is the act of all, or as is sometimes said, the hand of one is the hand of all.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina courts frequently approve accomplice liability charges that lack language stating an accompliceâ€™s criminal act must be â€œa probable and natural consequenceâ€ of the accompliceâ€™s common plan.Â  For instance, in State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 515 S.E.2d 98 (1999), our supreme court stated that under â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory, â€œone who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.â€Â  In State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 76-77, 502 S.E.2d 63, 76 (1998), the supreme court approved a broader accomplice liability charge that stated, â€œâ€¦ if a crime is committed by two or more persons who are acting together in the commission of a crime, then the act of one is the act of both.â€ Moreover, in State v. Crowe our Supreme Court approved the following charge for accomplice liability:Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[T]wo or more combine together to commit an unlawful act, such as robbery, and, in the execution of that criminal act, a homicide is committed by one of the actors, as a probable or natural consequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, all present participating in the unlawful undertaking are as guilty as the one who committed the fatal act. This principle was stated in State v. Cannon, 49 S.C. 550, 27 S.E. 526:Â  â€œThe common purpose may not have been to kill and murder, but if it was unlawful, as, for instance, to break in and steal, and in the execution of this common purpose a homicide is committed by one, as a\r\nprobable or natural consequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, then all present participating in the unlawful common design are as guilty as the slayer.â€\r\n\r\n258 S.C. 258, 265, 188 S.E.2d 379, 382 (1972) (emphases added).Â  Therefore, the approval of this charge demonstrates that the â€œnatural and probable consequenceâ€ language need not be included in the charge, as requested by Curry, if the charge as a whole adequately conveys the law.Â  Additionally, with the approval of the disjunctive â€œorâ€ in the â€œprobable or natural consequenceâ€ language of State v. Crowe, the trial courtâ€™s charge arguably benefited Curry as it only included the â€œnatural consequencesâ€ rather than the â€œnatural or probableâ€ language.\r\nTherefore, when viewing the challenged portion of the jury charge as a whole with the rest of the trial courtâ€™s instruction, we find the trial court adequately charged the law regarding â€œhand of one hand of all.â€Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, Curryâ€™s conviction is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J. dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting in a separate opinion):Â  I disagree with majorityâ€™s reasoning and analysis.Â  In my view, the trial court erred in (1) limiting his cross-examination of two co-defendants on sentencing exposure they faced for murder and other charges related to Hamiltonâ€™s death; and (2) giving an erroneous charge on accomplice liability.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nShortly after midnight on March 18, 2003, Hamilton and Ronald Coursey drove to an apartment complex in Augusta, Georgia, to purchase marijuana.Â  In the apartment complex parking lot, they encountered Curry and Anthony Savage and asked if they had any marijuana to sell.Â  Curry and Savage said they had no marijuana, but agreed to procure and sell a quarter-pound to Hamilton and Coursey for $220.Â  \r\nHamilton and Coursey drove to an ATM and withdrew money to pay for the drugs.Â  Meanwhile, Curry, Savage, and Jeremy Simuel drove around Augusta looking for marijuana.Â  They were unsuccessful.Â  When they returned to the apartment complex, Hamilton and Coursey followed Curry, Savage, and Simuel to Simuelâ€™s apartment.Â  Hamilton and Coursey waited outside the apartment while the others went inside and closed the door. They were soon informed the transaction would occur later.Â  \r\nHamilton and Coursey left the apartment complex and went to Hamiltonâ€™s home on Beech Island in Aiken County, where they smoked more marijuana and waited until Curry and Savage called.Â  The parties spoke by phone and agreed to meet at a gas station on Beech Island.Â  Curry, Savage and Simuel failed to procure marijuana to sell Hamilton and Coursey, but apparently intended to meet under the auspices of a drug sale in order to rob Hamilton and Coursey of their money.Â  \r\nHamilton and Coursey met Curry and Savage in a dark area behind the gas station.Â  Curry and Savage exited their car, where Simuel remained seated.Â  They approached the car in which Hamilton and Coursey waited.Â  Savage told Hamilton they did not have any marijuana, but demanded to see the money.Â  Within minutes, Hamilton was shot and killed while still seated in his vehicle.Â  Curry and Savage fled in the waiting car driven by\r\nSimuel.\r\nCurry, Savage and Simuel were all charged in connection with the robbery and Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  Curry was tried on the charges before a jury. \r\nAt trial, Coursey, Savage and Simuel implicated Curry in Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  Coursey attested that he saw Curry shoot Hamilton.Â  He testified the first time he met Curry, Savage, and Simuel was the night of the murder when he saw them around midnight in the dark parking lot of the apartment complex, a short time later at the apartment complex, and finally in the dark parking lot of the gas station where Hamilton was killed.Â  Coursey admitted he had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana throughout the evening.Â  He averred he called 911 after the shooting but was unable to provide many details about the perpetrators, telling the 911 dispatcher, â€œI donâ€™t know, itâ€™s dark man, I just donâ€™t know.â€Â  When he provided police a written statement one week later, he was only able to describe the gunman as â€œa black male with a white t-shirt on[.]â€ \r\nSavage asseverated Curry carried a gun with him on the night of the murder, and claimed he saw Curry fire the gun three or four times at the murder scene.Â  Savage further testified that after the shooting, Curry and he fled in a car driven by Simuel.Â  According to Savage, Curry exclaimed, â€œI think I dome capped him,â€ indicating he shot Hamilton in the head.Â  Curry later told Savage he had disposed of the murder weapon.Â  Simuel largely corroborated Savageâ€™s testimony, but did not provide an eyewitness account of Curry firing the gun.Â  \r\nCurry sought to question the motives and biases of Simuel and Savage by cross-examining them on the sentencing exposure they faced for Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  When Curry questioned Simuel about the potential sentences he faced, the trial court sustained the Stateâ€™s objection and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony.Â  \r\nPrior to Savageâ€™s testimony, Curry asked that he be allowed to show motive and bias by questioning Savage on the possible sentence he faced in connection with Hamiltonâ€™s death.Â  In reaching its decision, the trial court considered Curryâ€™s request in light of State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002), and stated:\r\n\r\nUnder [the circumstances in Mizzell], sir, part of the problem I think in that case was that, as I read it, the witness was given an offer to plead to one particular charge versus the potential sentence, the maximum sentence on the other charges that the defendant would have faced had she been convicted or tried on the original charges, and we donâ€™t have that here.Â  Thereâ€™s no deal between the State at all.\r\n\r\nCurry later sought clarification, asking, â€œSo the Court is ruling that he says he has no deal, then I am prohibited from asking about these penalties that heâ€™s facing, is that correct?â€Â  The trial court responded affirmatively.Â  Further, the trial court declined Curryâ€™s request to proffer the testimony: â€œWeâ€™re not going to bring him out here to elicit whether or not he knows what his potential sentences are.Â  As I understand it thereâ€™s no negotiations or deals between the State and this particular witness.â€Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Curry on both charges.Â  He received concurrent prison sentences of five years for the firearms charge and life in prison for the murder charge.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Limitation of Cross-Examination\r\nA.Â  Confrontation Right\r\nCurry argues the trial court committed reversible error in denying his request to cross-examine Savage and Simuel concerning the possible sentences they faced in connection with Hamiltonâ€™s death.Â  I agree.\r\nâ€œAmong other protections, the Sixth Amendment assures: â€˜In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]â€™Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.â€Â  State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 372, 613 S.E.2d 760, 764 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. granted (Feb. 15, 2006).Â  The Sixth Amendment was incorporated and made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965); State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002); Davis, 364 S.C. at 372, 613 S.E.2d at 764.Â  The right of confrontation is essential to a fair trial in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and insures that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.Â \r\nCalifornia v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970);State v. Martin, 292 S.C. 437, 439, 357 S.E.2d 21, 22 (1987); State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Feb. 16, 2006).Â  The primary interest secured by the Confrontation Clause is the right to cross-examination.Â  Gillian at 450, 602 S.E.2d at 71 (citing State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001); Starnes v. State, 307 S.C. 247, 414 S.E.2d 582 (1991)); see also State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 444 S.E.2d 525 (1994) (observing that specifically included in defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness is the right to meaningfully cross-examine an adverse witness).Â  \r\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees an accused the opportunity to cross-examine a witness concerning bias.Â  Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 319-20 (1974); State v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 171, 399 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1991).Â  Considerable latitude is allowed in cross-examining a witness for potential bias from which jurors could draw inferences relating to the witnessâ€™s liability. Â State v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, 481, 445 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1994); Brown, 303 S.C. at 171, 399 S.E.2d at 594.Â  However, the Confrontation Clause does not preclude the trial court from limiting a defendantâ€™s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness.Â \r\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986); Gillian, 360 S.C. at 451, 602 S.E.2d at 72.Â  Rather, the trial court retains broad discretion to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about issues including harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant. Â Id.Â  \r\nIn State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002), our supreme court found error in the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude evidence of possible sentences faced by the Mizzell brothersâ€™ co-defendants where all defendants faced the same charges and the co-defendants had not yet pled guilty or reached a plea agreement with the State. Â The Mizzell brothers were tried together on charges of first degree burglary, grand larceny, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime for breaking into the victimâ€™s home and stealing several guns.Â  Stateâ€™s witness Donald Steele had been charged with the same crimes as the Mizzells.Â  Steele testified that he and his wife drove the Mizzells to the victimâ€™s home and watched as they kicked in the door, entered the home, and returned carrying guns.Â  On cross-examination, Steele admitted the State had charged him with the same crimes as the Mizzells.Â  â€œThe trial court excluded evidence of the possible sentence Steele faced but permitted petitioners to examine Steele about the sentence in general terms.â€Â  349 S.C. at 330, 563 S.E.2d at 317.Â  \r\nThe issue for the court was whether the trial court had violated the defendantsâ€™ confrontation rights by refusing to allow evidence of Steeleâ€™s potential sentence if convicted of the same crimes as the Mizzells.Â  The Mizzell court began by juxtaposing the right of a defendant to cross-examine a witness with the discretion of a trial judge to dictate reasonable limits on the scope of cross-examination:\r\n\r\nA criminal defendant may show a violation of the Confrontation Clause â€œby showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby â€˜to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.â€™â€ Â Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 684 (1986). Â The trial judge retains discretion to impose reasonable limits on the scope of cross-examination. Â State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); accord Delaware v. Van Arsdall, supra. Â Before a trial judge may limit a criminal defendantâ€™s right to engage in cross-examination to show bias on the part of the witness, the record must clearly show the cross-examination is inappropriate. Â State v. Graham, supra. Â If the defendant establishes he was unfairly prejudiced by the limitation, it is reversible error. Â State v. Brown, supra.\r\n\r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at 317.Â  The court elaborated that â€œ[t]he jury is, generally, not entitled to learn the possible sentence of a defendant because the sentence is irrelevant to finding guilt or innocence.â€Â  Id. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  â€œHowever,â€ the court intoned, â€œother constitutional concerns, such as the Confrontation Clause, limit the applicability of this rule in circumstances where the defendantâ€™s right to effectively cross-examine a co-conspirator witness of possible bias outweighs the need to exclude the evidence.â€Â  Id. at 331-32, 563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  \r\nThe court discussed State v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 399 S.E.2d 593 (1991), a case in which a witness admitted she testified in exchange for a conspiracy charge which carried a seven and one-half year maximum sentence, rather than a trafficking in cocaine charge.Â  The trial judge refused to allow the defense to cross-examine the witness as to the maximum punishment she would have faced under the trafficking charge.Â  The Brown court found that evidence the witness was avoiding a mandatory prison term of â€œmore than three times the duration she would face on her plea to conspiracyâ€ constituted â€œcritical evidence of potential bias that appellant should have been permitted to present to the jury.â€Â  Brown, 303 S.C. at 171, 399 S.E.2d at 594. Â Further, the witnessâ€™s testimony was the only evidence linking Brown to trafficking cocaine.Â  \r\nThe Mizzell court noted that unlike in Brown, Steele did not have a deal with the State.Â  However, the court concluded that the lack of an agreement with the prosecution would make the potential for witness bias even more likely:\r\n\r\nThe fact the witness has yet to reach a plea bargain or been found guilty should not prevent the admission of such evidence. The lack of a negotiated plea, if anything, creates a situation where the witness is more likely to engage in biased testimony in order to obtain a future recommendation for leniency. \r\n\r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  Thus, Mizzell stands for the proposition that the lack of an agreement with the State may increase the likelihood of witness bias where the witness has been charged with the same crimes as the defendant. Â Â  \r\nSimilar to the scenario in Mizzell, Curryâ€™s co-defendants faced the same charges as Curry and had not pled guilty or reached a plea agreement.Â  Here, the trial court refused to allow Curry to cross-examine his co-defendants on their sentencing exposure because Savage and Simuel had not pled guilty or reached a plea agreement with the State.Â  This ruling contradicts the law established in Mizzell.Â  \r\nState v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Feb. 16, 2006), likewise addressed the Confrontation Clause in the context of questioning a witness on a potential sentence.Â  Gillian was convicted of murder.Â  He had coordinated a burglary and recruited several teenagers, including Stateâ€™s witness Page, to break into the home.Â  Among the items stolen was a .38 revolver which was later used to kill the victim, Michael Ward.Â  At Gillianâ€™s trial, Page testified to Gillianâ€™s possession of the gun, to Gillianâ€™s statement that he was going to â€œdo some dirtâ€ with it, and to an altercation between Gillian and the victim on the night of the murder.Â  â€œOn direct examination, Page admitted he was currently charged with first-degree burglary and the Richland County Solicitor had agreed to advise his plea judge of his cooperation in Gillianâ€™s trial.â€Â  360 S.C. at 449, 602 S.E.2d at 70.Â  Defense counsel sought to cross-examine Page on the possible sentence he faced, but the trial judge limited references to the sentence to â€œa lot of timeâ€ and â€œserious time.â€Â  Id.Â  Relying on Mizzell and State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 558 S.E.2d 518 (2002), we inculcated:\r\n\r\nIncluded in the Confrontation Clause protection is the right to cross-examine any Stateâ€™s witness as to possible sentences faced when there exists â€œa substantial possibility [the witness] would give biased testimony in an effort to have the solicitor highlight to [a] future [court]â€ how the witness cooperated in the instant case. Â See Sims, 348 S.C. at 25, 558 S.E.2d at 523; see also Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 332-33, 563 S.E.2d at 318. \r\n\r\nGillian, 360 S.C. at 454, 602 S.E.2d at 73. Â Accordingly, we found the trial court had erred in excluding evidence of Pageâ€™s potential sentence. Â \r\nApodictically, a defendant has a protected right under the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s Confrontation Clause to cross-examine a witness as to the possible sentence he faces where there exists a substantial possibility of bias.Â  In the case sub judice, where the witnesses were charged with the same crimes as the co-defendant against whom they were testifying, the requisite potential for bias was present.Â  Curry had a right to question on the possible sentences Simuel and Savage were facing, and the trial court erred by refusing this inquiry.\r\nB.Â  Harmless Error Analysis\r\nA determination that the trial court committed error does not end the inquiry.Â  A violation of a defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness is not per se reversible error if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994). Â In State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 454, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Feb. 16, 2006), this Court stated the law of harmless error with exactitude:\r\n\r\nNo definite rule of law governs the finding that an error was harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990); State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004). Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular facts of each case and upon a host of factors, including: \r\n  \r\nthe importance of the witnessâ€™ testimony in the prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and of course the overall strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case. \r\n  \r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318-19 (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)).\r\nâ€œHarmless beyond a reasonable doubtâ€ means the reviewing court can conclude the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319; Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).Â  â€œIn determining whether an error is harmless, the reviewing court must review the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the verdict.â€Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â \r\nState v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795; see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (noting that when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result).\r\n\r\nGillian, 360 S.C. at 454-55, 602 S.E.2d at 74-75.\r\nThe Mizzell court found the erroneous limitation of the cross-examination of a witness constituted reversible error under the facts of that case.Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319.Â  The court noted the witnessâ€™s testimony provided the only direct link between the defendant and the crime scene.Â  Moreover, no physical evidence linked the defendant to the crime scene.Â  In fact, nothing else corroborated the Stateâ€™s case.\r\nConversely, in State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 26, 558 S.E.2d 518, 523 (2002), our supreme court found harmless error where the Stateâ€™s case was â€œstrongâ€ without the witnessâ€™s testimony and exclusion of the testimony could not possibly have affected the trialâ€™s outcome.Â  In considering the strength of the Stateâ€™s case, the Sims court noted the defendantâ€™s fingerprints were found at the crime scene, the victimâ€™s mother testified Sims threatened the victim on the date of her death, and Sims had â€œspontaneously confessedâ€ to law enforcement officers investigating the incident.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court found harmless error in Gillian, where the witnessâ€™s testimony was â€œlargely cumulativeâ€ to testimony from other witnesses and other evidence suggested Gillianâ€™s guilt.Â  Gillian, 360 S.C. at 457-58, 602 S.E.2d at 74-75.Â  We distinguished the facts in Gillian from those in Mizzell, noting the absence of the witnessâ€™s testimony left â€œno material point of the Stateâ€™s case uncorroborated or unsupported by the testimony of other witnesses.â€Â  Id. at 458, 602 S.E.2d at 75.\r\nHere, Simuel and Savageâ€™s testimony was critical to the caseâ€™s outcome.Â  They testified to Curryâ€™s motive; to his possession of a gun similar to that used in the shooting; to his conduct before and after the shooting; and to self-incriminating statements Curry made about discarding the weapon.Â  Most significantly, Savage testified to seeing Curry fire the gun.Â  Without their testimony, the only evidence linking Curry to the crime scene is Courseyâ€™s vague and unspecific testimony.Â  Coursey provided few details of the gunman in the description he provided to the 911 dispatcher immediately after the shooting and in his written statement to police made one week later.Â Â  Coursey testified the shooting occurred in a dark area, and that he met Curry and Savage for the first time hours before in another dark location.Â  Moreover, Coursey testified he observed the shooting after spending several hours drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana.Â  Consequently, the testimony of Simuel and Savage provided the crucial nexus establishing Curry as the gunman.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s error in limiting Curryâ€™s cross-examination could have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial.Â  The error was not harmless.Â  \r\nII.Â  Accomplice Liability Charge\r\nAdditionally, Curry maintains the trial courtâ€™s charge on the hand of one is the hand of all theory was inadequate because it failed to specify that a crime committed by an accomplice must be a â€œprobable or natural consequenceâ€ of the actions taken in pursuit of the accomplicesâ€™ common plan.Â  I agree.Â  Although the courtâ€™s charge included the words â€œnatural consequence,â€ the charge should have included both â€œnaturalâ€ and â€œprobable.â€\r\nAt trial, Curry argued the courtâ€™s proposed charge on â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory lacked â€œsufficient emphasis on the issue of probable or natural consequence[.]â€Â  Based on language drawn from State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 534 S.E.2d 268 (2000), Curry suggested the following charge:\r\n\r\n[I]f two or more combine together to commit an unlawful act and a crime is committed by one of the actors as a probable and natural consequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, all present and participating in the unlawful undertaking are as guilty as the one who committed the act.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nThe trial judge rejected Curryâ€™s proposed charge and subsequently charged the jury twice on â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory.Â  The first charge, which the judge gave along with the other charges prior to jury deliberations, stated:\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to charge you now that if a crime is committed by two or more people who are acting together in committing a crime, the act of one is the act of all.Â  If a person joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose, he is criminally responsible for everything done by the other person which occurs as a natural consequence of the acts done in carrying out the common plan and purpose.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  After the jury left to deliberate, Curry renewed his objection to the charge on the basis that â€œthe instruction as given did not convey to the jury that the act in this case, a homicide, must be a natural or probable consequence of the preexisting plan in order . . . for the theory of the hand of one, hand of all to apply. . . .â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The trial judge noted Curryâ€™s exception.\r\nDuring its deliberations, the jury asked the court to re-charge â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  The court brought the jury out and charged accomplice liability as follows:\r\n\r\n. . . if a crime is committed by two or more people who are acting together in committing a crime, the act of one is the act of all.Â  I tell you further that a person who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is criminally responsible for everything done by the other person which occurs as a natural consequence of the acts done in carrying out the common plan or purpose.Â  When two or more people are acting together . . . assisting each other in committing the offense the act of one is the act of all, or as is sometimes said, the hand of one is the hand of all.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  After re-charging the jury on additional areas of law, including mere presence, the trial judge sent the jury back for continued deliberation.Â  The judge stated to Curryâ€™s counsel, â€œI note your continuing objection to the charge on hand of one as stated earlier.â€Â  \r\nCurry argues the accomplice liability charge erroneously failed to specify that an accompliceâ€™s crime must be â€œa probable and natural consequenceâ€ of actions taken in pursuit of the accomplicesâ€™ shared plan.Â  The language advanced by Curry limits criminal liability for an accompliceâ€™s actions that are inconsequential to the execution of their common scheme or plan.Â  As one treatise explains:\r\n\r\nWhen several persons are involved in the perpetration of one crime, and one of them goes outside the common purpose for which they combined or conspired in committing a fatal act which is not a natural and probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose, the others are not criminally liable for the homicide.Â  There is a requirement of a direct causal connection between the underlying felony and the homicide which is something more than mere coincidence in time and place between the two. The actual legal relation between the killing and the crime committed or attempted must be such that the killing can be said to have occurred as a part of the perpetration of the crime, or in furtherance of an attempt to commit it; that is, the fatal act must have been the ordinary, probable, or necessary result or effect of the execution of the conspiracy, or of the concerted action, in which the defendant participated.\r\nWhether or not the act done was in furtherance of the common design, or whether it was a natural and probable consequence flowing from the execution of the common design is always a question for the jury.\r\n\r\n3 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 2d 551, Homicide Outside of Common Design, Â§ 6 (2005) (emphasis added). \r\nOur courts have approved of accomplice liability charges that lack language stating an accompliceâ€™s criminal act must be â€œa probable and natural consequenceâ€ of the accomplicesâ€™ common plan.Â  For instance, in State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 648, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1999), our supreme court stated that under â€œthe hand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory, â€œone who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â Â Â  In State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 76-77, 502 S.E.2d 63, 76 (1998), the supreme court approved a broader accomplice liability charge that stated, â€œ. . . if a crime is committed by two or more persons who are acting together in the commission of a crime, then the act of one is the act of both.â€Â Â  \r\nHowever, other cases present accomplice liability charges that include the language Curry requests.Â  In State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 265, 188 S.E.2d 379, 382 (1972), our supreme court described accomplice liability as whereÂ Â Â  \r\n\r\n. . . two or more combine together to commit an unlawful act, such as robbery, and, in the execution of that criminal act, a homicide is committed by one of the actors, as a probable or natural consequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, all present participating in the unlawful undertaking are as guilty as the one who committed the fatal act. This principle was stated in State v. Cannon, 49 S.C. 550, 27 S.E. 526:Â  â€œThe common purpose may not have been to kill and murder, but if it was unlawful, as, for instance, to break in and steal, and in the execution of this common purpose a homicide is committed by one, as a probable or natural consequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, then all present participating in the unlawful common design are as guilty as the slayer.â€\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Peterson, 287 S.C. 244, 335 S.E.2d 800 (1985), revâ€™d on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), our supreme court considered the necessity of the â€œprobable or natural consequenceâ€ language in an accomplice liability charge.Â  Peterson involved the joint appeal of two accomplices who appealed their convictions for murder, armed robbery, grand larceny of a motor vehicle, and conspiracy.Â  The court stated:\r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s charge was a correct statement of the general law of this jurisdiction concerning accomplice liability.Â  In the present case, however, the jury reasonably could have found that the murder was not the probable or natural consequence of the larceny of a motor vehicle.\r\nHad the jury determined that either appellant conspired only to commit an unarmed larceny of a car, and had it further concluded that the state failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a homicide was the natural or probable consequence of a plan to steal the victimâ€™s car, the appellant would have been entitled to an acquittal on the charge of murder.\r\nIt was therefore essential under the facts and circumstances of this case that the jury be instructed that it had to find that the homicide was a natural or probable consequence of the acts actually agreed on by the appellants before the law would hold him responsible for such a homicide.Â  The failure of the trial judge to so instruct was error because it permitted the jury to convict an appellant of murder merely by finding (1) that appellant had combined with another to commit the non-life threatening crime of grand larceny of a motor vehicle and (2) that appellantâ€™s accomplice thereafter took a life without appellantâ€™s prior knowledge, approval, or assistance.\r\n\r\nPeterson, 287 S.C. at 246-47, 335 S.E.2d at 801-02 (emphasis added).\r\nThus, the facts and circumstances of a particular case ultimately dictate whether an accomplice liability charge must instruct the jury that an accompliceâ€™s actions be a â€œnatural or probable consequenceâ€ of actions taken in pursuit of the accomplicesâ€™ shared plan.\r\nI would hold that here, as in Peterson, the facts and circumstances warrant the language requested by Curry.Â  Evidence presented at trial suggested the possibility that the codefendants met Hamilton and Coursey under the pretense of selling them marijuana, but in fact had no marijuana to sell and only intended to rob them of their money.Â  The testimony is not conclusive that the codefendants agreed to use weapons to accomplish the crime; only that one of them apparently had the intention and shot Hamilton during the commission of the crime.Â  Had the jury determined that either codefendant conspired only to commit an unarmed robbery and had it further concluded that the State failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a homicide was the natural or probable consequence of the robbery, the appellant would have been entitled to an acquittal on the charge of murder.Â  Crowe and Peterson utilize both â€œnaturalâ€ and â€œprobable.â€Â  Each word has a different meaning.Â  Accordingly, the use of both words was necessary in the case sub judice.Â  The courtâ€™s failure to include the word â€œprobableâ€ here renders the charge inadequate. \r\nCurry further alleges the trial court erred (1) by refusing to allow him to cross-examine Savage on possible sentence he faced for pending charges unrelated to Hamiltonâ€™s death; (2) by allowing testimony regarding alleged bad acts; and (3) by allowing the State to elicit testimony that Curry was in jail at the time of the trial.Â  Because I would reverse on the Confrontation Clause and accomplice liability charge issues, I decline to address these issues.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE.\r\n\r\n[1] Curry also argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine Savage about pending criminal charges unrelated to Hamiltonâ€™s murder.Â  Curry never proffered the evidence or even attempted to proffer it.Â  The evidence is not part of the record.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved.Â  See State v. Hawkins, 310 S.C. 50, 54, 425 S.E.2d 50, 57 (Ct. App. 1991) (declining to rule on alleged error in exclusion of evidence, where no proffer was made and excluded evidence was not part of record).Â  Lastly, Curry argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence that he was incarcerated.Â  This issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (â€œA party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.â€).\r\n[2] Curry also argues the trial court erred in admitting improper character or habit evidence during Savageâ€™s testimony.Â  Curry contends the testimony regarding â€œthe black bagâ€ where Curry allegedly kept his gun was inadmissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  Any possible error by the circuit court was harmless given the other evidence admitted at trial.Â  See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (finding that error is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4160","title":"Auten v.

Goode, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4160\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 9, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPhilip E. Wright, of Lancaster, for Appellant.\r\nFrancis L. Bell, Jr. and William J. Nowicki, both of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Â Leila Eugenia Auten, the sister of Millard Benton Parrish, Jr., and personal representative of his estate, instituted this action to recover funds from Parrishâ€™s retirement account that were disbursed to his ex-wife, Sylvia Snipes.Â  The trial court held Auten failed to meet her burden of proving a separation agreement between Parrish and Snipes had the effect of extinguishing any interest Snipes had in the account.Â  Auten appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 18, 2000, Parrish rolled his 401K into a Roth IRA with Signator Investments.Â  Parrish named Snipes, his wife at the time, as primary beneficiary to receive the proceeds of the account upon his death.Â  Â \r\nParrish and Snipes later separated.Â  On April 9, 2001, they executed a separation agreement providing in pertinent part as follows: Â \r\n\r\nHusband and wife will each keep all money and bank accounts and 401K plans and profit sharing plans which are in his or her name. . . .\r\n. . .\r\nLASTLY, IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the Husband and Wife release and forever discharge the other of and from all causes of action, claims, property rights or any demands whatsoever in law or in equity . . . and the parties to each declare this to be a full, final and complete settlement of all of their property rights, and each party does hereby release and relinquish unto the other all of his or her rights, title, claim, interest and demand, rights of dower in and to the property of the other, whether now in being or hereinafter acquired . . . . \r\n\r\n(Boldface in original.)Â  Contemporaneous with the separation agreement, Parrish executed a power of attorney, which allowed Snipes to proceed with a divorce in the Dominican Republic.Â  By decree dated May 23, 2001, a judge in the Dominican Republic dissolved the marriage.[2]Â  Soon after the divorce, Snipes remarried.Â  Even after execution of the separation agreement and the divorce, Parrish never changed his will or the beneficiary designation on the Signator account. \r\nParrish died September 20, 2002.Â  In May 2003, Snipes contacted Signator Investments and received the balance of the account, totaling $114,582.52. \r\nOn June 13, 2003, Auten, on behalf of Parrishâ€™s estate, sued Snipes for the proceeds of the Signator account and other relief.Â  On August 26, 2003, Snipes filed her answer and counterclaim.Â  \r\nThe trial court, sitting without a jury, held a final hearing in the case on November 16, 2004.Â  By that time, the parties had dismissed or resolved all matters in this litigation except for Autenâ€™s claim for recovery of the funds in the Signator account. \r\nOn May 20, 2005, the trial court issued an order denying Auten the relief she requested.Â  In the order, the trial court made the following findings: Â (1) because the agreement did not specifically address a retirement account in which one spouse possessed an expectancy as a named beneficiary, the general language of the separation agreement by which Snipes purportedly waived her beneficiary interest in the Signator account was ineffective; and (2) Parrish failed to change the beneficiary on the Signator account notwithstanding that he had both the ability and ample time to do so.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn South Carolina, the construction of a separation agreement is a matter of contract law.[3]Â  Whether the language of a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.[4] Â The construction of a clear and unambiguous contract is a matter for the court to decide.[5] Â â€œWhere a contract\r\nis capable of legal construction, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it.â€[6]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We reject Autenâ€™s challenge to the trial courtâ€™s conclusions that (1) the general release language in the agreement was not intended as a relinquishment of Snipesâ€™s claim to the proceeds in the Signator account; and (2) the agreement was not intended to operate as a relinquishment of Snipesâ€™s right to be the designated beneficiary of Parrishâ€™s retirement account.\r\nIn Stribling v. Stribling, this court recently observed that â€œ[g]enerally, in South Carolina, divorce does not per se affect the rights of a beneficiary interest. . . . However, it is generally recognized that a beneficiary may contract away the beneficiary interest through a separation or property settlement agreement, even if the beneficiary designation is not formally changed.â€ [7] Â  \r\nNevertheless, such a relinquishment requires more than â€œgeneral language of releaseâ€ in the separation or property settlement agreement.[8]Â  As this court went on to state in Stribling:\r\n\r\n[I]n South Carolina, a separation agreement may preclude a named beneficiary from recovery of an expectancy interest in two ways.Â  First, a named beneficiary may be precluded from recovery when a separation agreement specifically addresses a particular policy/account providing an expectancy interest and the agreement contains language of release applicable to the policy/account. Second, when a separation agreement provides general language of release without specifically addressing the policy/account providing the expectancy interest, a named beneficiary may be precluded from recovery when the policy/account owner intended for the general waiver to apply to the expectancy interest.[9]\r\n\r\nWe hold the first method by which the agreement could have precluded Snipesâ€™s expectancy interest in the funds is inapplicable here.Â  The trial court correctly determined the separation agreement did not specifically address a retirement account in which one spouse had an expectancy interest as a named beneficiary.Â  Rather, the agreement merely awarded Parrish and Snipes the retirement accounts that were in his or her name respectively and had no explicit provisions regarding beneficiary interests.[10]Â  Furthermore, the agreement had only general release language and did not specifically require Parrish and Snipes to waive their expectancy interests in each otherâ€™s retirement accounts.Â  Thus, by the terms of the separation agreement, Snipes did not waive her beneficiary interest in the Signator account.[11]\r\nLikewise, Auten cannot rely on the second way that a separation agreement can prevent a named beneficiary from recovering an expectancy interest.Â  We found no evidence in the record before us suggesting Parrish intended the waiver to apply to a beneficiary interest in his retirement account.Â  Significantly, Auten did not challenge the trial courtâ€™s finding that Parrish never attempted to change the beneficiary designation on the Signator account during the seventeen months between the time of the divorce until his death even though he was able to do so.[12]Â  In addition, although, as Auten argued, there were plausible reasons that Parrish would not desire to leave his retirement funds to Snipes,[13] these motives do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that he no longer intended her to be the beneficiary of those funds in the event she survived him.[14]  \r\n2.Â  Auten argues the trial court erred in failing to make a â€œspecific findingâ€ that the separation agreement was unambiguous.Â  Auten contends that, although the trial court found â€œ[t]he appellant, through her attorney, presented in open court that the [a]greement was unambiguous,â€ this was not a â€œspecific finding.â€Â  Assuming without deciding that Auten has preserved this matter for our review,[15] we hold this argument does not support a finding of reversible error.Â  Any failure by the trial court to make the desired finding did not inure to Autenâ€™s prejudice.Â  Indeed, Autenâ€™s insistence that the separation agreement is unambiguous would, if anything, bar consideration of parol evidence as to whether or not Parrish intended that the agreement would prevent Snipes from receiving his retirement funds as the named beneficiary on the account.[16]Â  \r\n3.Â  Auten further argues the trial court erred in interpreting the word â€œkeep,â€ alleging that, in the appealed order, the definition of the term appearing in the sixth edition of Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary was selectively edited to fit Snipesâ€™s desired interpretation of the agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe definition quoted by the trial court excluded the phrases â€œto continueâ€ and â€œnot to lose or part with.â€Â  Notwithstanding these omissions, we hold the trial court did not interpret the quoted part of the definition out of context.[17]Â  Rather, it appears the trial court was following the well-established principle that alienability is an intrinsic attribute of ownership.[18]Â  Undue emphasis on the excluded portion of the definition would have the undesirable effect of compromising what was and should have been Parrishâ€™s unfettered right to dispose of his property as he wished.Â  This right included the option of retaining Snipes as the beneficiary of his retirement funds upon his death.\r\n4.Â  Finally, we reject Autenâ€™s suggestion that Snipesâ€™s failure to testify or introduce evidence warrants a finding that she had no expectancy interest in the Signator account.Â  The focus of this controversy is Parrishâ€™s intent with respect to his retirement funds.Â  In any event, it is evident from the pleadings that Snipes herself contacted Signator Investments after Parrishâ€™s death for payment of his retirement account proceeds; therefore, it would appear that she had reason to believe she had a valid claim to the funds.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n BEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The divorce decree provided the â€œseparation agreement entered into between the parties . . . shall survive in this judgment of divorce by reference but not be merged and that the parties are hereby ordered and directed to comply with each and every provision of said agreement.â€\r\n[3]Â  McDuffie v.

Â \r\n[9]Â  Stribling, 369 S.C. at ___, 632 S.E.2d at 294 (emphasis added). Â Â Â Â \r\n[10] In her brief, Auten argues the last paragraph of the agreement operated as a waiver of Snipesâ€™s beneficiary interest in the Signator account.Â  We disagree.Â  This paragraph provides that â€œeach party does hereby release and relinquish unto the other all of his or her rights, title, claim, interest and demand, rights of dower in and to the property of the other, whether now in being or hereinafter acquired.â€Â  Contrary to what Auten suggests, the phrase â€œwhether now in being or hereinafter acquiredâ€ refers to property that Parrish or Snipes might receive after executing the agreement, not to after-acquired rights that either could obtain in the otherâ€™s assets.\r\n[11] We further disagree with Auten that the release language at issue here is sufficiently similar to that in Estate of Altobelli v. International Business Machines, 77 F.3d 78 (4th Cir. 1996), so as to warrant a finding that it amounted to a relinquishment of Snipesâ€™s right as the named beneficiary on the Signator account.Â  The parties to the separation agreement in Altobelli, expressly â€œwaive[d] and transfer[red]â€ to each other â€œany interestâ€ each had in certain accounts awarded to the other spouse.Â  Id. at 80.Â  This language is more specific than the general release paragraph in the separation agreement between Parrish and Snipes.\r\n[12] See Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at 479, 484 S.E.2d at 117 (suggesting one year to be a reasonable time for an insured to make a change in beneficiaries) (citing Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Wadsworth, 689 P.2d 46 (Wash. 1984)). \r\n[13] The reasons Auten cited were (1) the divorce, (2) Snipesâ€™s remarriage soon after, and (3) Parrishâ€™s terminal illness.\r\n[14] See Snakenberg v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 299 S.C. 164, 172-73, 383 S.E.2d 2, 7 (Ct.

Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (stating an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal but must have been raised to and ruled on by the trial court); Hawkins v.

App. 2004) (finding an issue is not preserved when the trial court does not explicitly rule on it and the appellant does not move to alter or amend the judgment on that ground).\r\n[16] See Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at 478, 484 S.E.2d at 116 (â€œWhere a property settlement agreement is ambiguous, the court may consider parol evidence to ascertain the intent of the parties.â€).Â  We further note that Rushton v. Lott, 330 S.C. 418, 499 S.E.2d 222 (Ct. App. 1998), which Auten cites in her brief, is of questionable applicability to this case.Â  In Rushton, extrinsic evidence in the form of a letter was admitted as evidence that the parties to the separation agreement at issue had intended to divest the husbandâ€™s beneficiary interest in a particular asset.Â  Id. at 421, 499 S.E.2d at 224.\r\n[17] In the appealed order, the trial court stated as follows:Â  â€œThe word â€˜keep,â€™ in its plain and ordinary meaning, means to â€˜have or retain in oneâ€™s own power or possession; . . . ; to preserve or retain; to maintain, carry on, conduct, or manage.â€ (Ellipses in original.)\r\n[18] Cf.

Evans appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Melony A. Cusack under the family purpose doctrine.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEvans brought this action against Blake C. Stewart and Blakeâ€™s mother, Cusack, seeking damages arising from an automobile accident.Â  Evans was a passenger in a car driven by Stewart when Stewart fell asleep at the wheel, causing a head-on collision with another car.Â  At the time of the accident, Stewart, Evans and another friend were returning from a two day trip to the beach for spring break.Â  Evans filed a complaint against Stewart and Cusack seeking damages from Stewart based on Stewartâ€™s negligence and damages from Cusack based on the family purpose doctrine and negligent entrustment.Â  Cusack moved for summary judgment asserting there was no genuine issue of material fact and she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on the matter, the parties submitted the deposition of Stewart.Â  Stewart testified that at the time of the accident, he was eighteen years old and had moved out of his motherâ€™s home two to three months prior to the accident.Â  Stewart was working full time and was sharing a house with two roommates, paying approximately $150 a month in rent.Â  He was entirely self-supporting.Â  Stewart had moved out of his motherâ€™s home because he could not get along with his stepfather.Â  Although he did move back in with his mother following the accident because he needed someone to take care of him, it was not his intention to return to her home after he moved.Â  The truck Stewart was driving at the time of the accident was purchased by Stewart for a total of $1,200, with $1,000 from money he had in savings and $200 from his stepfather.Â  Because Stewart was only seventeen at the time of purchase, the car was registered in Cusackâ€™s name.Â  Cusack also paid Stewartâ€™s insurance until Stewart â€œcould get on [his] feet.â€Â  Stewart testified he drove the truck mostly and considered it his truck, and that he paid for gas and the maintenance of the truck.Â  The truck stayed in Stewartâ€™s possession, he drove it to and from work, and he used it for recreational purposes.Â  When the accident occurred, Stewart did not feel he needed to ask his motherâ€™s permission to take the vehicle to the beach, and she did not know that he had gone on the trip.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Cusack submitted her affidavit in which she swore, although the truck in question was titled in her name, she was not the true owner; that she and her husband gave Stewart $200 toward the purchase of the automobile but that Stewart used $1,000 of his own money to buy the truck; Stewart was still a minor at the time of purchase and the truck was therefore registered in her name; Stewart was responsible for all costs and expenses involved in operating the truck; Stewart was the sole user of the truck and he kept it for his own pleasure and convenience; and at the time of the accident, she had no control over Stewartâ€™s use of the truck and had no knowledge of his trip to the beach.Â  \r\nThe trial judge noted that Stewart did not live with Cusack, he was self-supporting, the truck was kept at Stewartâ€™s residence and was in his sole possession, Stewart paid the insurance, maintenance and gas for the vehicle, and at the time of the accident, Stewart was on his way back from a beach trip of which Cusack had no knowledge.Â  He found Evans had not presented any evidence to contradict the testimony of Stewart or the affidavit of Cusack, and thus found there was no basis to support Cusackâ€™s liability under the family purpose doctrine and Cusack was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  He further determined there was no basis to support a claim for negligent entrustment as there was no evidence Cusack had control over the truck, nor any evidence that Stewart was addicted to intoxicants or had the habit of drinking or drove while intoxicated.Â  Accordingly, he also found Cusack was entitled to summary judgment on the negligent entrustment cause of action as well.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  â€œA motion for summary judgment shall be granted â€˜if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â \r\nId. Â (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  It is not sufficient for one to create an inference that is not reasonable or an issue of fact that is not genuine.Â  Durkin v. Hansen, 313 S.C. 343, 346, 437 S.E.2d 550, 552 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Although summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked, where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEvans contends the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment to Cusack under the family purpose doctrine.Â  He asserts there were genuine issues of fact in dispute relating to ownership, control, and use of the vehicle such that summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œUnder the family purpose doctrine, the head of a family who owns, furnishes, and maintains a vehicle for the general use and convenience of his family is liable for the negligence of a family member having general authority to operate the vehicle for such a purpose.â€Â  Thompson v. Michael, 315 S.C. 268, 272, 433 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1993).Â  The doctrine has its genesis in the law of agency, and it will impose liability on a parent when a child is acting as his agent.Â  Id.Â  Thus, â€œone â€˜who has made it his business to furnish a car for the use of his family is liable as principal or master when such business is being carried out by a family member using the vehicle for its intended purpose, the family member thereby filling the role of agent or servant.â€™â€Â  Campbell v. Paschal, 290 S.C. 1, 8, 347 S.E.2d 892, 897 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting 8 A.L.R.3d 1191 at 1196 (1966)).Â  Even if a parent owns the car, it must be determined whether the parent provided the car for the general use and convenience of the family, and if the car was not provided for the general use and convenience of the family, there is no relationship of principal and agent at the time of the wreck to impose liability on the parent.Â  Thompson, 315 S.C. at 273, 433 S.E.2d at 855.Â  Further, while the applicability of the family purpose doctrine is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury, where no factual issue is created the question becomes one of law, properly decided by the trial judge.Â  Lucht v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, 133, 221 S.E.2d 854, 857 (1976). \r\nEvans points to Stewartâ€™s deposition testimony in arguing genuine issues of fact exist. He asserts Stewart testified that while he drove the truck, it was titled in Cusackâ€™s name, and Stewart received no insurance proceeds from the loss of the vehicle.Â  He also notes Stewart stated that Cusack could have driven the truck if she wanted to and she controlled who drove the truck, and that if Cusack had needed the truck to haul something somewhere, she could have used it.Â  Finally, he asserts Stewartâ€™s testimony that Cusack had instructed him to bring the truck back to her once or twice while he lived away from home was evidence of her continued control of the use of the truck after he moved out of her home.Â  \r\nA review of Stewartâ€™s deposition reveals that, while the truck was titled in Cusackâ€™s name, Stewart provided the bulk of the funds to purchase the vehicle, he paid for the maintenance of the vehicle, the truck was titled in his motherâ€™s name merely because Stewart was a minor at the time of purchase, and Stewart considered the truck to be his.Â  As to insurance proceeds from the totaled truck, while Stewart testified he did not receive anything for it, neither did he know if his mother received anything for it.Â  Stewartâ€™s testimony regarding the use of the truck by others reveals only that Cusack or her husband would have been allowed to use the truck if they had the need, as Stewart, â€œwouldnâ€™t tell [his] mom she couldnâ€™t use the truck,â€ and would not tell his stepfather he could not use the truck because he â€œrespect[ed] him too.â€Â  Finally, concerning Cusackâ€™s directive that he return the truck to her home after Stewart moved out, the deposition testimony shows only that â€œmaybe once or twiceâ€ Cusack instructed Stewart to bring the vehicle back to her when the two had argued, however, the truck was not in fact taken to Cusack on those occasions, but remained in Stewartâ€™s possession.Â  \r\nEven if we were to assume Cusack â€œownedâ€ the vehicle since it was titled in her name, ownership alone is insufficient. There must also be evidence Cusack furnished and maintained the vehicle for the general use and convenience of her family.Â  If the car was not provided for the general use and convenience of her family, there is no relationship of principal and agent at the time of the wreck to impose liability on Cusack.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Evans, there is simply no evidence Cusack furnished and maintained the truck for the general use and convenience of her family such that she is liable as principal or master for Stewartâ€™s use of the vehicle as her agent or servant.Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order granting Cusack summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4162","title":"Reed-Richards v.

Nichols , of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This is a workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  Clemson University, the employer, and the State Accident Fund, the carrier,[1] appeal the award of lifetime benefits to Susan Reed-Richards.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 13, 2000, Reed-Richards sustained an injury arising out of the scope of her employment as an administrative assistant at Clemson University.Â  She sought lifetime medical care and weekly compensation benefits for life.Â  Appellants denied Reed-Richards had become a paraplegic as a result of the accident and sought to limit her benefits to the normal statutory maximum of 500 weeks.\r\nIn 1973, Reed-Richards had sustained a compression fracture of her spine at the T-11/T-12 vertebrae level as the result of a motor vehicle accident.Â  She did relatively well after the accident until 1978, when she developed difficulty with bladder control and walking. \r\nIn 1979, Reed-Richards had surgery for a posterior fusion and the placement of Harrington rods in her spine.Â  She did well after this procedure until 1993, when she began having some bladder leakage at night.Â  In 1994, she underwent additional surgery, which included removal of the Harrington rods and â€œan anterior two-level corpectomy with strutting and fusion with plate.â€Â  Shortly after these procedures, she lost control of her bowel and bladder and developed urinary retention.Â  Because of increasing pain and bowel and bladder difficulties, she had still more surgery in 1995, after which she was able to control her bowel functions. Â Â \r\nOn August 14, 2000, Reed-Richards began working for Clemson University, performing clerical work.Â  Approximately three months later, on November 13, 2000, she fell after catching her leg on an open file drawer. \r\nAs a result of the accident, Reed-Richards has to use a walker, something she never needed before.Â  She has also lost the ability to control her bowels; they empty at random times, forcing her to wear adult diapers and restricting her from going out in public because of odor problems.Â  Her bladder condition originating from her 1973 accident has worsened, requiring her to catheterize herself more often than she had to in the past.Â  Because of these problems, she is able to perform only menial tasks and cannot pursue additional vocational training.Â  In addition, she has had to take medications for anxiety, pain, and leg spasms.\r\nAfter a hearing on April 17, 2002, the single commissioner issued an order finding Reed-Richards totally and permanently disabled, but limited her benefits to 500 weeks.Â  Reed-Richards appealed to the full commission, alleging she was entitled to lifetime benefits.Â  The full commission vacated the single commissionerâ€™s order and remanded the matter for a de novo hearing. \r\nOn remand, the single commissioner held a hearing on April 8, 2003.Â  On September 16, 2003, the single commissioner issued an order finding Reed-Richards was a paraplegic as a result of the accident and therefore entitled to lifetime benefits.Â  This finding was based in large part on the deposition and notes of Dr. David Shallcross, one of Reed-Richards treating physicians, who on March 21, 2003, wrote a letter stating in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\nThis patient has an incomplete paraplegia (is a paraplegic). â€˜Paraplegiaâ€™, according to the International Standards of Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, Revised Sixth Edition, dated 2000, is â€˜impairment or loss of motor and/or sensory function in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral segments of the spinal cord secondary to damage of neural elements within the spinal\r\ncanal.â€™\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nBy order dated May 27, 2004, an appellate panel of the full commission upheld the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  Appellants sought judicial review in the circuit court, which issued an order dated August 15, 2002, affirming the full commission.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Appellants contend the circuit court erred in affirming the finding that Reed-Richards was a paraplegic and therefore entitled to lifetime workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe right of an injured worker to obtain lifetime workersâ€™ compensation benefits is controlled by South Carolina Code section 42-9-10.Â  This section provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the five hundred week limitation prescribed in this section or elsewhere in this title, any person determined to be totally and permanently disabled who as a result of a compensable injury is a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical brain damage is not subject to the five hundred week limitation and shall receive the benefits for life.[3]\r\n\r\nWe understand Appellantsâ€™ arguments to be as follows:Â  (1) the circuit court erred in determining that, because the statute did not differentiate between complete and incomplete paraplegia, the legislature would have to make that distinction; (2) had the legislature intended to include incomplete paraplegia as a condition under which a claimant was eligible for lifetime benefits, it could have done so; (3) a holding that incomplete paraplegia can entitle a claimant to lifetime benefits would lead to an absurdly inconsistent result when considered with other workersâ€™ compensation statutes that set out a compensation scheme distinguishing between total loss and less than total loss; (4) it was improper to rely on both a medical text and a common usage dictionary to determine that the term â€œparaplegicâ€ could include a diagnosis of incomplete paraplegia; and (5) the â€œliberal purposeâ€ of the workersâ€™ compensation legislation â€œis not an unbridled fiat to engage in judicial legislation in violation of the separation of powers.â€[4]  \r\nWe do not fault the workersâ€™ compensation commission or the circuit court for relying on both a medical text and a common usage dictionary in determining that the term â€œparaplegicâ€ could embrace one diagnosed with â€œincomplete paraplegiaâ€ as opposed to â€œcomplete paraplegia.â€[5]Â  \r\nFirst, Dr. Shallcross expressly stated, albeit parenthetically, that Reed-Richards â€œis a paraplegic,â€ thus implying she was eligible for lifetime benefits under section 42-9-10.Â  It was reasonable for the commission to consider the authority on which he based this pronouncement.[6]\r\nSecond, as the circuit court aptly noted, the only alternative definition offered by Appellants was their counselâ€™s â€œlay personâ€™s definitionâ€ that â€œyou have total and full and complete loss of use of your lower extremities.â€Â  We agree with Reed-Richards and the circuit court that this definition is not evidence at all, let alone substantial evidence upon which to base a reversal of the commission.[7]Â  Moreover, we are unaware of any legal authority restricting â€œplain and ordinaryâ€ meanings to commonly held stereotypes of the terms they describe.\r\nWe therefore hold the commission and the circuit court correctly interpreted the term â€œparaplegicâ€ to include a diagnosis of incomplete paraplegia.Â  This interpretation, though consistent with the legislative purpose of construing workersâ€™ compensation laws in favor of claimants,[8] does not rise to the level of judicial legislation.Â  There was no need for the legislature to specify that a claimant can recover lifetime benefits based on a diagnosis of incomplete paraplegia if the claimant is totally and permanently disabled as a result of this condition.Â  \r\n2.Â  We do not address Appellantsâ€™ contention that the interpretation of the term â€œparaplegicâ€ endorsed by both the commission and the circuit court cannot be logically reconciled with other statutes within the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act that set forth a partial loss ratio scheme on which statutory benefits are based.Â  There is no explicit ruling on this argument by the single commissioner, full commission, or the circuit court, and the record does not indicate Appellants raised this omission in any post-trial motion; therefore, we cannot address it in this appeal.[9]\r\n3.Â  Appellants further challenge the finding that Reed-Richards was a paraplegic under section 42-9-10 as a result of the accident on November 13, 2000.Â  We hold there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support this finding.[10]Â  \r\nAppellants correctly note that, before the November 2000 injury, Reed-Richards had a seventeen-year history of back and spinal problems that included pain, bladder and bowel incontinence, and ambulatory difficulties.Â  They also point to Dr. Shallcrossâ€™s description on July 30, 2001, of Reed-Richardsâ€™s injury as â€œincomplete paraplegia due to T-12 fracture,â€ and there is no dispute that she had suffered a T-11/T-12 vertebrae fracture in 1973.Â  Nevertheless, before the November 2000 accident, Reed-Richards had never been diagnosed with paraplegia and was able to work full time, including overtime.Â  Although she had experienced numbness in her right leg before her on-the-job injury, there is no evidence that she ever had a problem with both legs before this accident.Â  Likewise, although she had temporary bowel problems in the past, she did not have any trouble controlling her bowels from the time she began working for Clemson until her injury several months later.Â  The change in her bowel condition is significant because, as Dr. Shallcross testified, the loss of control of her anal sphincter, as evidenced in an anal EMG, further convinced him that her complaints were genuine.\r\nDr. Shallcross further stated that â€œbased on the fact that [Reed-Richards] was fully ambulatory without any assisted device prior to the injury and based on the fact that she was not suffering from fecal incontinence prior to that injury, her inability to work is pretty much all related to the workersâ€™ comp injury.â€Â  Significantly, when asked specifically about the cause of her present symptoms, Dr. Shallcross responded that Reed-Richards â€œhad a pre-existing injury to the lower part of her spinal cord which was made worse by her workersâ€™ comp injury.â€Â  (Emphasis added).[11]\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the record in this case has substantial evidence to support the commissionâ€™s finding that, pursuant to section 42-9-10, Reed-Richards became totally and permanently disabled as a result of the accident on November 13, 2000.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Clemson University and the State Accident Fund will also be collectively referred to as â€œAppellants.â€\r\n[2]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005).\r\n[4]Â  See Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 498, 541 S.E.2d 526, 531 (2001) (noting that even a liberal construction of workersâ€™ compensation statutes â€œ â€˜does not authorize the amendment, alteration or extension of its provision beyond its obvious meaningâ€™ â€) (quoting Gajam v. Bradlick Co., 355 S.E.2d 899, 902 (Va. Ct. App. 1987)).\r\n[5]Â  The commission cited the 2000 edition of the International Standards of Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, to which Dr. Shallcross referred in explaining his diagnosis, and Websterâ€™s Ninth Collegiate Dictionary for the â€œplain and ordinary meaning of â€˜paraplegia.â€™ â€\r\n[6]Â  As noted earlier in this opinion, Dr. Shallcross stated in his letter that the International Standards of Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury defines paraplegia â€œas impairment or loss of motor and/or sensory function in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral segments of the spinal cord secondary to damage of neural elements within the spinal canal.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)\r\n[7]Â  See Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 64, 624 S.E.2d 649, 653 (2000) (â€œIt is well established that counselâ€™s statements regarding the facts of a case and counselâ€™s arguments are not admissible evidence.â€).\r\n[8]Â  See Lizee v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 367 S.C. 122, 130 n.2, 623 S.E.2d 860, 864 n.2 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting â€œthe principle that workersâ€™ compensation laws in general . . . are to be liberally construed in favor of claimants and coverageâ€).\r\n[9] Â See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding an issue was not preserved for appellate review when the trial court did not explicitly rule on the appellantâ€™s argument); United Dominion Realty Trust v. Wal-Mart Stores, 307 S.C. 102, 107, 413 S.E.2d 866, 869 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that, when the circuit court sitting in an appellate capacity does not address an issue and the appellant fails to move to alter or amend on that ground, the alleged error is not preserved for further appellate review).\r\n[10] See Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999) (â€œThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the Commissionâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€). \r\n[11] The contention that the November 2000 accident alone would not have caused Reed-Richardsâ€™s present condition is no reason for Appellants to disclaim liability. Â See Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C. 272, 275, 353 S.E.2d 280, 282 (1987) (â€œIt is no defense that the accident, standing alone, would not have caused the claimantâ€™s condition, because the employer takes the employee as he finds him.â€).Â  Likewise, a showing that the accident resulted only in the exacerbation of existing problems would not preclude recovery.Â  See Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores, 318 S.C. 431, 437, 458 S.E.2d 76, 80 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA condition is compensable unless it is due solely to the natural progression of a pre-existing condition.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4163","title":"Walsh v.

Walsh (Husband), brought this action against Husbandâ€™s former wife, Joyce K. Woods (Wife I), seeking relief pertaining to the disposition of surviving spouse benefits (SSB) made available through Husbandâ€™s retirement plan.Â  Wife II appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting Wife Iâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nWe note at the commencement that although some changes and additions have been made, the facts largely mirror those in Walsh v. Woods, 358 S.C. 259, 594 S.E.2d 548 (Ct. App. 2004), revâ€™d Walsh v. Woods, Mem. Op. No. 2005-MO-043 (S.C.Sup.Ct. filed Sept. 19, 2005).Â  Husband married Wife I in 1957, and they separated in 1970.Â  Although Husband and Wife I lived apart, they remained married for twenty years after their separation.Â  In 1980, Husband met Wife II and they began dating.Â  In 1989, after forty years of employment at E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (DuPont), Husband retired. Â During his tenure at DuPont, Husband participated in a joint and survivor annuity plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).Â  When he retired, Husband signed a Post Retirement Company-Paid Survivor Benefits and Spouse Benefit Option designating Wife I, to whom he was still married, as the beneficiary of his SSB plan in the event he predeceased her.Â  \r\nOn August 24, 1990, Husband and Wife I divorced.Â  Incident to the divorce, they entered into an agreement which the family court approved, adopted, and incorporated into the divorce decree.Â  The decree provided, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n[T]he parties shall sign whatever documents or other paperwork that is necessary to enforce this Agreement.Â  I find that the parties have further agreed that each shall retain what .Â  .Â  . retirement plans, pension plans .Â  .Â  . etc., that he or she has in his or her possession.Â  If the wife is required to sign any papers concerning the husbandâ€™s retirement or benefit options from DuPont of Westinghouse, then she shall sign those. \r\n\r\nHusband never presented Wife I with any documents to sign regarding his retirement plan, and neither party obtained a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) during Husbandâ€™s lifetime.Â  \r\nOn May 31, 1991, Husband wrote DuPont a letter informing the company that he had divorced Wife I and that his â€œex-wife has waived any claim to my pensions . . . and this has been documented as part of the divorce decree.â€Â  The letter further stated Husband wished to change his beneficiary to Wife II.Â  In 1994, Husband and Wife II married.Â  On November 30, 1994, Husband again wrote DuPont.Â  Apparently, Husband believed his first letter to DuPont sufficed to change the beneficiary of his planâ€™s SSB from Wife I to Wife II.Â  Accordingly, his second letter advised DuPont he wished to change the beneficiary from Frances Dudley to Frances Dudley Walsh, inasmuch as he had married Wife II.Â  Further, the letter stated â€œ[i]f this letter does not suffice [to change the beneficiary], please send me the necessary paperwork to have my wife eligible for . . . spouse benefits.â€Â  Despite the two letters to DuPont, the change Husband requested was never made legally effective.Â  \r\nOn January 27, 1996, Husband died. Â His will named Wife II as the sole beneficiary and the personal representative of his estate.Â  After Husbandâ€™s death, DuPont began paying benefits to Wife I.Â  In 1997, Wife II filed suit against DuPont, which was removed to federal court, seeking a judicial determination that the SSB should be paid to her rather than Wife I.Â  DuPont successfully moved for summary judgment on the grounds no QDRO existed terminating Wife Iâ€™s right to receive benefits at the time of Husbandâ€™s retirement.Â  \r\nWife II then contacted John W. Harte, the attorney who represented Husband in his divorce from Wife I, and requested he prepare and submit a QDRO to DuPont.Â  Harte prepared the QDRO, then contacted Vickie Johnson, the attorney who represented Wife I in the divorce action, and requested she obtain Wife Iâ€™s signature on the document.Â  Wife I did not sign the QDRO, but authorized Johnson to sign it on her behalf.Â  Wife I noted on the document, however, that she authorized her signature under protest and out of concern she would be held in contempt of court if she refused to sign.Â  \r\nAfter Harte submitted the QDRO to DuPont, he received a letter from the company advising him that the document was not valid because it did not comply with the mandates of the Internal Revenue Code.Â  Further, the letter stated that â€œ[a] QDRO cannot be entered after the death of the participant. Â A participant must be a living person.Â  There was no QDRO in effect at the participantâ€™s death that awarded any benefits to an alternate payee.Â  Therefore, there are no benefits payable pursuant to a QDRO.â€Â  In addition, DuPontâ€™s letter advised that even if the document had been prepared at some point after his retirement, but prior to Husbandâ€™s death, it would nonetheless be ineffective to divest Wife I of her SSB because Wife I owned thoseÂ  benefits which vested upon Husbandâ€™s retirement.Â  \r\nWhen DuPont refused to pay the SSB to Wife II, she commenced an action to recover all monies past, present and future paid to Wife I.Â  Her suit, filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Richland County, was subsequently removed to the United State District Court for the District of South Carolina.Â  DuPont then successfully moved for summary judgment.Â  \r\nOn December 18, 2000, Wife II filed the instant action against Wife I seeking recovery under the following seven legal and equitable theories:Â  (1) unjust enrichment; (2) â€œlaw of the case;â€ (3) res judicata; (4) collateral estoppel; (5) breach of contract; (6) bad faith breach of contract; and (7) conversion.Â  Wife I answered, denying Wife II was entitled to the relief sought in her complaint, and asserted as defenses: (1) expiration of the statute of limitations; (2) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; (3) laches; and (4) res\r\njudicata.&nbsp; \r\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.Â  Wife I argued, inter alia, that all of Wife IIâ€™s causes of action failed because the SSB vested in Wife I in 1989, at the time of Husbandâ€™s retirement, and could not now be divested.Â  Wife I further asserted the applicable statute of limitations barred Wife IIâ€™s claims.Â  In support of her cross motion, Wife II asserted no genuine issues of material fact existed that Wife I had waived her rights to the benefits in the divorce proceeding.Â  In addition, Wife II asserted that the trial court could enforce the property settlement agreement by requiring Wife I to disgorge herself of all SSB payments she had received in the past and will receive in the future by transferring the payments to Wife II.\r\nThe trial court, relying on Hopkins v. AT&amp; T, 105 F.3d 153, 157 (4th Cir. 1997), granted Wife Iâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Under Hopkins, the trial court reasoned that (1) SSB vests in a plan participantâ€™s current spouse on the date the participant retires, whether or not spouses are married at the time the participant dies, and (2) surviving spouse benefits may not be paid to a spouse who marries a participant after the participantâ€™s retirement. Â The trial court expressly determined the holding in Hopkins was determinative of the entire case and, therefore, declined to address Wife Iâ€™s other grounds for summary judgment and further declined to reach Wife IIâ€™s cross motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nWife II appealed, and this court reversed, finding the trial court erred in determining Hopkins was dispositive of all of the issues on appeal because given the facts, the case of Estate of Altobelli v. International Business Machines Corporation, 77 F.3d 78 (4th Cir. 1996), also applied.Â  Further, we found the trial court erred in reasoning that ERISA governed the disposition of all of Wife IIâ€™s legal and equitable claims.Â  Wife I petitioned for rehearing on the grounds that the statute of limitations barred Wife IIâ€™s claims.Â  We withdrew our opinion reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment and affirmed the trial court based on the statute of limitations.Â  The Supreme Court reversed, finding the statute of limitations did not bar Wife IIâ€™s claims and remanded the case to this court to determine whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Wife I.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which states that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 150-51, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004); see also, Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 316-17, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating all ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Â Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005); Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 542, 608 S.E.2d 440, 447 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them,\r\nsummary judgment should be denied. Â Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004). Â However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ,\r\nsummary judgment should be granted.Â Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 821 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nAs a threshold matter, we first turn our attention to Wife Iâ€™s assertion that Wife II failed to properly preserve the issue of whether her legal and equitable claims were barred by ERISA because the trial court expressly declined to rule on the issues.Â  Wife I argues because Wife II failed to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion requesting the trial court address such issues, she cannot argue them on appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court found Hopkins v. AT&amp; T, 105 F.3d 153, 157 (4th Cir. 1997), barred Wife IIâ€™s claim and therefore, the court ruled that it was â€œunnecessary to reach Francesâ€™[s] cross motion for summary judgment.â€Â  In so ruling, the trial court adopted the analysis espoused by Hopkins and implicitly denied Wife IIâ€™s claims.Â  A Rule 59(e) motion is required to preserve issues that have not been ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See Wilder Corp v. Wilke, 330 S.C, 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998) (noting that proper use of a Rule 59(e) motion is to preserve issues raised to but not ruled upon by the trial court). Â We hold that a motion under Rule 59(e) is unnecessary in this case because the trial courtâ€™s decision with respect to Wife IIâ€™s claims was clear.Â  These issues were clearly raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Accordingly, Wife II was not required to move for relief under Rule 59(e) in order to preserve the issues for review. Â Finally, because, ERISA claims involve subject-matter jurisdiction, they may be raised at any time. Baker Hospital v. Isaac, 301 S.C. 248, 391 S.E.2d 549 (1990).\r\nII.\r\nNext, Wife II argues the trial court erred in granting Wife I summary judgment.Â  She premises her claim upon the proposition that by virtue of Wife Iâ€™s putative waiver of her rights to SSB, those benefits ipso facto became the property of Husband and thus passed to her under his will. Â We disagree.[1]\r\nWe begin our analysis by discussing the function of ERISA preemptionÂ  law in this case. Â In the case of Lewis v. Local 382, Intâ€™l Brotherhood of Elec. Workers (AFL-CIO), 335 S.C. 562, 569, 518 S.E.2d 583, 596 (1999), our Supreme Court addressed the issue of preemption under\r\nERISA:\r\n\r\nAny and all State laws insofar as they relate to employee benefits plans are preempted by ERISA. 29 U.S.C.Â§1144(a); Duncan v. Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 310 S.C. 465. 427 S.E.2d 657 (1993). This Court has recognized that the pre-emptive effect of ERISA is a broad one. Baker Hosp. v Isaac, 301 S.C. 248, 391 S.E.2d 549 (1990). A state law â€œrelates toâ€ an ERISA-governed employee benefit plan, â€œif it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.â€ Shaw v. Delta air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 90, 103 S. Ct. 2890, 2896, 77 L. Ed.2d 490 (1983). Â Further, a state law â€œrelates toâ€ an ERISA plan if the rights or restrictions it creates are predicated on the existence of such a plan. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 111 S.Ct. 478, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990). However, those state actions which affect employee benefits plans in â€œtoo tenuous, remote or peripheral a mannerâ€ do not relate to the plan. Shaw, 463 U.S. 85, 90. \r\n\r\nHere, it is inescapable that Wife IIâ€™s claim to the SSB, like the retirement benefits in Lewis, are predicated upon the existence of the husbandâ€™s pension plan. Â While ERISA related claims involve subject-matter jurisdiction, 29 U.S.C. Â§ 1132(3)(1) vests both state and federal courts with concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction of certain civil actions brought by participants or beneficiaries against an employee benefit plan. Â Nevertheless, under preemption principles, federal ERISA law must control our decision on the issue of Wife IIâ€™s claim to the SSB. Â See Baker Hosp. v. Isaac, 301 S.C. 248, 391 S.E.2d 549 (1990)(holding ERISA preempted a hospitalâ€™s contract, promissory estoppel, negligence, and misrepresentation claims); see also Dorn v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, et. al., 211 F.3d. 938 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding a state law claim by an ex-wife regarding her rights to receive benefits from an ERISA plan necessarily â€œrelates toâ€ an ERISA plan and preempts Louisiana law of conversion).\r\nThe trial court concluded the ERISA provisions, as interpreted in Hopkins, were dispositive of Wife IIâ€™s legal and equitable claims. Â On appeal, Wife II argues the case of Estate of Altobelli v. IBM Corp., 77 F.3d 78 (4th Cir. 1996) permits an ERISA participantâ€™s ex-spouse to waive, in a separate agreement, incorporated into a divorce decree, her interest as a beneficiary in her ex-husbandâ€™s pension plan.Â  \r\nAltobelli analyzes the split among federal circuits on the issue of whether administrators of an ERISA plan are required to recognize a beneficiaryâ€™s waiver of his or her benefits. Â The majority of circuits that have addressed this issue have held such waivers are valid under certain circumstances. See Id.;\r\nMohamed v. Kerr, 53 F.3d 911 (8th Cir. 1995); Brandon v. Travelers Ins. Co., 18 F.3d 1321 (5th Cir. 1994); Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Hanslip, 939 F.2d 904 (10th Cir. 1991); Fox Valley &amp; Vicinity Constr. Workers Pension Fund v. Brown, 897 F.2d 275 (7th Cir. 1990) (en banc). Â Only two courts of appeals have disagreed, holding plan administrators need not look beyond the documents on file with the plan to determine whether there has been a valid waiver effectuated in outside private documents. Krishna v. Colgate Palmolive Co., 7 F.3d 11 (2nd Cir. 1993); McMillan v. Parrott, 913 F.2d 310 (6th Cir. 1990).Â  \r\nIn recognizing a split among the circuits, the Altobelli court followed the majority view and concluded that each of the parties in Altobelli â€œclearly intended to relinquish all interests in the pension plan of the other.â€Â  Id. at 81.Â  The court stated a beneficiary may waive pension benefits where the waiver specifically refers to and modifies the beneficiary interest, or through specific language in a divorce decree.Â  Id. at 81.Â  \r\nThe Altobelli court agreed with the Seventh Circuit that the anti-alienation clause does not apply to a beneficiaryâ€™s waiver.Â  According to the majority of federal courts, because ERISA does not explicitly address â€œwaiverâ€ by a beneficiary, the Fourth Circuit turned to federal common law to determine whether, and under what circumstances, an individual may validly waive her benefits in an ERISA plan. See Altobelli, 77 F.3d at 81. Â Under federal common law, an individualâ€™s waiver is valid if, â€œupon reading the language in the divorce decree, a reasonable person would have understood that she was waiving her beneficiary interest. . . .â€ Â Clift v. Clift, 210 F.3d 268, 271-72 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Mohamed, 53 F.3d at 914-15 (â€œa property settlement agreement entered into pursuant to a dissolution may divest former spouses of beneficiary rights in each otherâ€™s [ERISA benefits], if the agreement makes it clear that the former spouses so intend.â€). Moreover, â€œany waiver must be voluntarily made in good faith.â€ Clift, 210 F.3d at 272.\r\nHowever, Altobelli arose out of facts clearly distinguishable from those in the instant case.Â  Altobelli dealt with a waiver of life insurance and pension plan benefits while the instant case deals with a waiver of SSB.Â  The Altobelli decision only holds that the ex-wife of Altobelli had validly waived her rights to his pension benefits pursuant to a QDRO. Â We observe also that Hopkins, consistent with Altobelli, held that as far as Mr. Hopkinsâ€™s pension benefits[2] were concerned, the first wife was entitled to them under the provisions of her QDRO. Â Hopkins, 105 F.3d at 155.Â  The court noted, however, that â€œ[b]enefits provided under a pension â€˜plan may not be assigned or alienated,â€™ 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1056(d)(1), except pursuant to a â€˜qualified domestic relations order.â€™â€ Â Id.Â  The court stated further that:\r\n\r\nERISA defines a â€œdomestic relations orderâ€ as any judgment, decree, or order which, â€œ(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child,Â  or other dependent of a participant, and (II) is made pursuant to a state domestic relations lawâ€¦.â€ 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii). A domestic relationsÂ  order is â€œqualifiedâ€ if it, among other things, gives an alternate payee the right to â€œreceive all or a portion of the benefits payable to a participant under anÂ  planâ€¦.â€ 29 U.S.C.A Â§ 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I).\r\nâ€¦. AT&amp;T contends that on the day Mr. Hopkins retired, the rights to Surviving Spouse Benefits vested in [Wife II), his current spouse. As a result, AT&amp;T argues, the Surviving Spouse Benefits are no longer payable to a plan participant. Noting that a QDRO must relate to a benefit â€œpayable with respect to a participant.â€ 29 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I).\r\n\r\nId.Â \r\nThe Hopkins court agreed with AT&amp;Tâ€™s contention and held, as a matter of first impression in the federal courts, that Wife IIâ€™s rights to the SSB vested upon Mr. Hopkinsâ€™ retirement. Â Id.Â  Moreover, the court cited with approval the case of Anderson v. Marshall, 856 F. Supp. 604, 607 (D. Kan. 1994) for the proposition that â€œupon retirement, the Surviving Spouse Benefits â€˜became irrevocable and could not be changed [even by a] waiver of the designated beneficiary.â€™â€ See also, Rivers v. Central and South West Corporation, et al., 186 F.3d 681, 683-84 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding SSB irrevocably vested in plan participantâ€™s current wife â€œon the date of his retirement and [former wife] is forever barred from acquiring an interest in [his] pension planâ€).\r\nIn the present case, at the time Husband retired in 1989, the SSB vested in Wife I because the two were still married.Â  Although Husband had a ninety-day window prior to his retirement in which he could have, with Wife Iâ€™s written consent, removed her as a beneficiary of the SSB, this was not accomplished.Â  After Husband retired, even if Wife I had agreed to waive her SSB, she could not have done so under ERISA.Â  Wife Iâ€™s purported waiver in the divorce agreement was ineffective to waive the SSB because ERISA does not allow a beneficiary to waive SSB after a plan participant retires.\r\nMoreover, even if Husband had divorced Wife I prior to retiring, or had never married Wife I to begin with, Wife IIâ€™s position with respect to the survivor benefits would be no different: Wife II would not be entitled to any SSB because she married Husband after he retired.Â  ERISA provides SSB â€œmay not be paid to a spouse who marries a participant after the participantâ€™s retirement.â€ Hopkins, 105 F.3d at 157 (citing 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1055(f)) (emphasis added).Â Â  \r\nTherefore, because Wife Iâ€™s rights vested upon Husbandâ€™s retirement, those benefits belonged to her, not Husband. Â Under the terms of the property settlement agreement, each party was permitted to retain any pension plan in â€œhis or her possession.â€ Â Whether intended or not, the SSB were as much in Wife Iâ€™s â€œpossessionâ€ (control) as they could be. Â We agree with Wife I that even under the terms of the the partiesâ€™ property settlement agreement, she was entitled to retain her SSB because they were in her â€œpossessionâ€ at the time of the execution and approval by the court of the property settlement agreement. Â We therefore hold that Hopkins, not Altobelli is dispositive of the issues in this appeal.\r\nIt does seem untoward that Husband should not be able to have a component of his qualified joint and survivor annuity awarded to Wife II, rather than a woman from whom he was divorced and did not have a relationship with for years before his death. Â However, in keeping with our reading of federal law, there is no other resolution possible. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We find it difficult, as a practical matter, to imagine that such an arrangement could ever happen because as explained in Dorn v. Intâ€™l Brotherhood of Elec. Workers, et. al., 211 F.3d 938, 941 (5th Cir. 2000), an ERISA joint and survivor annuity is unlike a typical joint and survivor annuity â€œavailable in the commercial market, which commonly guarantees payment of a stipulated or determinable amount to two persons, frequently spouses, while both are living and after the death of either person, to whichever of the two survives.â€Â  In an ERISA annuity â€œ(1) the QJ&amp;SAâ€™s (qualified joint and survivor annuity) annuity payments cease at the death of the participant spouse, regardless of whether his death occurs before or after the death of the non-participant spouse; and (2) if, but only if, the non-participant spouse survives the participant spouse does the survivorâ€™s annuity kick in.â€Â  Id. at 942.Â  \r\n[2] The Hopkins court expresses in clear terms the operation ofÂ  a qualified joint and survivor annuity: â€œUnder the joint and survivor annuity, Mr. Hopkins receives a fixed income for life (pension benefits) and if his spouse survives him, she will receive 50% of the fixed income (Surviving Spouse Benefits) for the remainder of her life.â€Â  Hopkins, at 155.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4164","title":"Albertson v.

Brush, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This appeal involves a claim of a fraudulent conveyance pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth, as codified in section 27-23-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  The trial court found the challenged transfer of real property from Brian Robinson to his then wife, Maureen Robinson, was not a fraudulent transfer.Â  The judgment creditors appeal, and we reverse and remand. \r\nI.\r\nBrian and Maureen Robinson were married on October 4, 1980.Â  The Robinsons experienced difficulties throughout their marriage resulting from Mr. Robinsonâ€™s abuse of alcohol.Â  These difficulties eventually led to the couplesâ€™ divorce on February 18, 2005.Â  \r\nThe property at issue in this case is the Robinsonsâ€™ former marital home, which was purchased on September 2, 1985.Â  During their marriage, the Robinsons conveyed an interest in the marital home several times between one another.Â  On June 2, 1992, Mr. Robinson conveyed his interest in the marital residence to Mrs. Robinson.Â  On February 28, 1996, Mrs. Robinson re-conveyed a one-half interest in the marital residence to Mr. Robinson.Â  The reason for the conveyances was Mr. Robinsonâ€™s alcoholism and Mrs. Robinsonâ€™s fears that this disease would ultimately harm the family.Â  \r\nThe underlying action arises from Mr. Robinsonâ€™s failure to complete work on a pool he contracted to build for Nathan and Amanda Albertson in August 2000.Â  At the time, Mr. Robinson was the sole proprietor of a business called Southeast Pool Specialties.Â  The contract price for the Albertsonsâ€™ pool was $16,995, and the Albertsons paid $11,895 as a down payment.Â  Mr. Robinson did not complete the construction of the pool.Â  He attributed his failure to complete the contract to his alcoholism.Â  \r\nIn February 2001, the Albertsons filed suit seeking damages for breach of contract.Â  Mr. Robinson did not respond to the lawsuit, but on June 15, 2001, Mrs. Robinson submitted a response to the court in the form of a letter to Mr. Albertson.Â  On September 25, 2001, an entry of default was lodged against Mr. Robinson.Â  As of September 2001, the Robinsonsâ€™ marital residence was titled jointly in their respective names.\r\nOn March 1, 2002, Mr. Robinson conveyed his one-half interest in the marital home to Mrs. Robinson.Â  The stated consideration for this conveyance was $5.00 and â€œlove and affection.â€Â  The Albertsons contend this conveyance should be found void as a fraudulent transfer because the transfer occurred after Mr. Robinson became indebted to them.Â  In this regard, the Albertsons assert the transfer by Mr. Robinson to Mrs. Robinson of his interest in the property was done with the purpose of avoiding payment of the debt.\r\nOn July 22, 2002, the court conducted a damages hearing in the underlying breach of contract action.Â  Mr. Robinson failed to appear for the hearing and judgment was entered against him on August 27, 2002, in the amount of $42,134.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Robinsons separated on June 16, 2003, and a Separation Agreement was finalized and entered on August 29, 2003.Â  The Robinsons were divorced on February 18, 2005.Â  \r\nThe Albertsons filed the present action in 2004.Â  The Albertsons sought a declaratory judgment and relief based on the claim that the March 1, 2002, transfer of Mr. Robinsonâ€™s interest in the property was void as a fraudulent transfer.\r\nThe trial court, following a hearing, denied the Albertsonsâ€™ Complaint for declaratory relief.Â  The trial court found that Mr. Robinson was not indebted to the Albertsons at the time of the March 1, 2002 transfer; there was no evidence Mr. Robinson failed to retain sufficient assets to pay the resulting judgment; the transfer was supported by adequate consideration; and there was no intent to defraud creditors with the transfer.\r\nII.\r\nA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  An action to set aside a transfer as fraudulent pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth is an action in equity.Â  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 97 n.6, 478 S.E.2d 45, 49 n.6 (1996).Â  This court therefore has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  \r\nIII.\r\nThe Albertsons contend the March 1, 2002 conveyance between Mr. and Mrs. Robinson should be voided as a fraudulent transfer.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThough the Albertsons raise several arguments on appeal, this case is best dealt with by combining these arguments and examining the law concerning fraudulent transfers as a whole.Â Â  To do so, we first look to the statutes and case law concerning fraudulent transfers.Â  \r\nThe Statute of Elizabeth, as codified in section 27-23-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), governs fraudulent conveyances and provides in relevant part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Every . . . conveyance of lands . . . which may be had or made to or for any intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful . . . debts . . . must be deemed and taken . . . to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate and of no effect, any pretense, color, feigned consideration, expressing of use, or any other matter or thing to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina courts have held that under the Statute of Elizabeth conveyances may be set aside under two conditions: first, where the transfer is made by the grantor with the actual intent of defrauding his creditors where that intent is imputable to the grantee, even though there is a valuable consideration; and, second, where a transfer is made without actual intent to defraud the grantorâ€™s creditors, but without valuable consideration. Â McDaniel v. Allen, 265 S.C. 237, 242-43, 217 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1975).Â  We dispose of this appeal pursuant to the latter situation.Â  We therefore do not reach the trial courtâ€™s finding that Mr. Robinson (in transferring his interest in the property) did not intend to defraud the Albertsons.Â  Cf. Royal Z Lanes, Inc. v. Collins Holding Corp., 337 S.C. 592, 596, 524 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1999) (stating grossly inadequate consideration for a conveyance is a â€œbadge of fraudâ€ and creates a rebuttable presumption of intent to defraud).Â  \r\nWe thus begin our examination with a determination of whether the challenged conveyance was supported by valuable consideration.Â  We find the record compels a finding that the transfer in question was not supported by valuable consideration.Â  \r\nThe record yields but one reasonable inferenceâ€”the transfer from Mr. Robinson to Mrs. Robinson was not accompanied by valuable consideration.Â  For example, Mrs. Robinson testified she has no recollection of actually transferring the stated consideration of $5.00.Â  Moreover,the Robinsonsâ€™ testimony indicates the couple did not have a clear understanding as to what constituted the consideration.Â  Mrs. Robinson stated she gave â€œall of [her] years being married to himâ€ as consideration for the property.Â  Mr. Robinson never testified as to what he considered consideration, and instead asserted he was afraid if he did not convey his interest in the property to Mrs. Robinson, the family would lose everything because of his addiction to alcohol.Â  Mr. Robinson stated he â€œwas looking out for [his] kidsâ€ and hoped this conveyance would save his marriage. Â Â \r\nThe Robinsonsâ€™ additional claim that they conveyed the property pursuant to the separation agreement simply holds no weight.Â  The Robinsons did not separate until over a year after the conveyance, and Mr. Robinson testified he was attempting to avoid a separation in March of 2002.Â  In fact, there was testimony that Mr. Robinson may have still been living at the marital residence at the time the current declaratory action was commenced.Â  We find no consideration was exchanged in the conveyance.Â  \r\nThe absence of consideration does not end our inquiry.Â  Where a transfer is made without valuable consideration being exchanged, the transfer will be set aside only when the creditor establishes the following: (1) the grantor was indebted to the creditor at the time of the transfer; (2) the conveyance was voluntary; and (3) the grantor failed to retain sufficient property to pay his indebtedness to the creditor in full, not merely at the time of transfer, but in the final analysis when the creditor seeks to collect the debt.Â  Mathis v. Burton, 319 S.C. 261, 265, 460 S.E.2d 406, 408 (Ct. App. 1995).Â Â Â  \r\nWe must, therefore, determine whether the Albertsons were â€œexisting creditorsâ€ at the time of the March 1, 2002 conveyance.Â  The case of Matthews v. Montgomery, 193 S.C. 118, 133, 7 S.E.2d 841, 848 (1940) is instructive.Â  Matthews states that it does not matter whether a creditor obtained the judgment against a property owner before the conveyance:\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary that the debt should have been in existence or the right of action have accrued at or before the time of the transfer.Â  It may be reduced to judgment at a later date.Â  To determine whether a person is such an existing creditor as can invoke the protection of the statute the inception of the debt or obligation is the time which controls; and not the date of the subsequent entry of judgment.\r\n\r\nId.Â Â \r\nâ€œThe inception of the debt or obligationâ€ arose in 2000 when Mr. Robinson breached his contract with the Albertsons. The challenged conveyance came much later on March 1, 2002, after entry of default in the underlying breach of contract action.Â  Application of Mathis and Matthews obliges us to find that the Albertsons were existing creditors at the time of the March 1, 2002 conveyance. \r\nThe second prong shown in Mathis, that the conveyance be voluntary, is not in dispute.Â  The conveyance was voluntary.Â  \r\nThe third and final prong of Mathis requires a determination of whether sufficient funds existed to pay the judgment after the conveyance.Â  If the debtor retains sufficient assets to satisfy the debt in full, the challenged conveyance will not be set aside.Â  See Gardner v. Kirven, 184 S.C. 37, 42, 191 S.E. 814, 816-17 (1937).Â  \r\nMr. Robinsonâ€™s belief that the judgment would be between seven and ten thousand dollars is of no moment; however, he did not even maintain sufficient funds to pay this amount.Â  Mr. Robinson testified he transferred his interest in the house to his wife because he was afraid he was going to lose everything, and it was â€œthe last little bit I had.Â  You know, there wasnâ€™t much there.â€Â  He further testified that when he transferred the house, he did not keep anything other than his clothes.Â  He stated he anticipated there would be a judgment against him, and while he thought he would be able to borrow enough money to pay the judgment, he did not have sufficient funds in the bank.Â  Mr. Robinson apparently sold some tools, but he received around only $7,000 from the sale.Â  Therefore, the evidence establishes that Mr. Robinson failed to retain sufficient assets to satisfy his debt in full to the Albertsons.Â Â  \r\nIV.\r\nAccordingly, pursuant to the Statute of Elizabeth, we find the March 1, 2002 conveyance void as fraudulent.Â  We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n ANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4165","title":"Ex Parte: Johnson v.

The Bankruptcy Court granted Bank of America relief from the automatic stay to complete the foreclosure in accordance with state law.Â  The property was then advertised pursuant to a Second Notice of Sale on May 14, 21, and 28, 2005.[1]Â  \r\nOn July 6, 2005, the property was sold.Â  All prospective bidders had notice of the provision requiring the purchaser to pay the property taxes.Â  Bids were made on this basis.Â  Johnson was the highest bidder.Â  He purchased the property for $2.2 million dollars, which resulted in surplus funds.Â  \r\nJohnson made the required five percent deposit on July 6, and by July 26 had deposited the remainder of the purchase price with the Court, at which point the Master issued a deed.Â  This deed, consistent with the prior order, also noted the property was â€œsubject to assessments, Richland County taxes, existing easements, easements and restrictions of record, and other senior encumbrances.â€Â  Johnson filed his deed for the property on August 2, 2005. \r\nFollowing the sale and after delivery of the deed, Johnson sought to defeat the foreclosure order and avoid his obligation to pay the taxes and related assessments.Â  Johnson filed a motion, pursuant to section 12-49-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), in an attempt to have the taxes and assessments paid from the surplus proceeds.Â  The Master issued an Order of Disbursement and denied Johnsonâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n II.\r\nThe express terms of sale, established in the foreclosure order, set the property for sale subject to outstanding tax liens.Â  The foreclosure order stated the purchaser would be required to pay â€œany property taxes or assessments due and payable.â€Â  This was confirmed, without challenge, at the public commencement of the sale on June 6 when all present were reminded that the property would be sold subject to any outstanding property taxes.Â  The Masterâ€™s deed issued to Johnson on July 26 also stated the property was â€œsubject to assessments, Richland County taxes, existing easements, easements and restrictions of record, and other senior encumbrances.â€Â  Thus, by the express terms of the sale, Johnson and all other bidders understood that liability for the outstanding tax liens would fall to the successful bidder.\r\nUnder these specific facts, we concur with the Master that it would be inequitable to allow Johnson to profit from his late motion.Â  See BB &amp; T of S. C. v. Kidwell, 350 S.C. 382, 387, 565 S.E.2d 316, 319 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œAn action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is an action in equity.â€); see also \r\nQHG of Lake City, Inc. v. McCutcheon, 360 S.C. 196, 202, 600 S.E.2d 105, 107 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating that while an appellate court is free to take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence in an action in equity, the court is not required to\r\ndisregard the judgeâ€™s findings).Â  \r\nAt every stage of the proceedings, all interested parties were made aware that the property was being sold subject to tax liens.Â  As noted, the foreclosure order specifically provided that â€œthe purchaser [is] required to pay . . . for any property taxes or assessment due and payable.â€Â  The Second Notice of Sale followed suit by placing responsibility for the taxes and assessments on the purchaser.Â  The deed issued by the Master, which Johnson filed ten days prior to filing his motion under section 12-49-60, stated the property was â€œsubject to assessments, Richland County taxes, existing easements, easements and restrictions of record, and other senior encumbrances.â€Â  \r\nTo rewrite the terms of sale after the sale would be patently inequitable, especially to the other bidders who made bids knowing that a successful bid would result in the additional responsibility of approximately $230,000 in past due taxes.Â  Johnsonâ€™s post sale motion pursuant to section 12-49-60 came too late.Â  By that time, Johnson had participated in the sale under the terms of the foreclosure order, failed to make any motion prior to sale, and filed a deed which further acknowledged the terms of sale.\r\nAssuming Johnson may have invoked section 12-49-60 prior to the sale, equity must intervene when Johnson remained silent while all bidders made bids based on the additional responsibility for the payment of the substantial past due taxes and assessments.Â  Equity will not permit such an unwarranted windfall to Johnson under these circumstances.Â  See generally Collins v. Sigmon, 299 S.C. 464, 468, 385 S.E.2d 835, 837-38 (1989) (applying the ancient maxim â€œequity aids the vigilant and diligentâ€ and not those who sleep on their rights).\r\nFurthermore, it is the long-established policy in South Carolina that â€œ[t]he courts should be particularly jealous of the integrity of judicial sales.â€Â  In re Wilson, 141 S.C. 60, 63,&nbsp;139 S.E. 171, 172&nbsp;(1927).Â  â€œ[A]ny conduct on the part of those actively engaged in the selling or bidding [at a judicial sale] that tends to prevent a fair, free, open sale, or stifle or suppress free competition among bidders, is contrary to public policy[.]â€Â  Ex parte Keller,&nbsp;185 S.C. 283, 291, 194 S.E. 15, 19 (1937).Â  The filing of a motion under section 12-49-60 after the sale is contrary to such public policy under the circumstances here.Â  Where all parties and potential bidders in a foreclosure sale have notice of, and do not challenge, a valid court order assigning responsibility for outstanding taxes to the successful bidder as a condition of the purchase, the successful bidder may not thereafter gain a windfall by a tardy attempt to invoke section 12-49-60. \r\n III. \r\nWe further disagree with Johnsonâ€™s argument that disbursement of sale proceeds must always track section 12-49-60.Â  We find that the payment of taxes and related assessments from the sale proceeds under section 12-49-60 is not mandatory.Â  Section 12-49-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides:\r\n\r\nWhen any real estate shall be sold under any writ, order or proceeding in any court, the court shall, on motion of any person interested in such real estate or in the purchase or proceeds of the sale thereof, order all taxes, assessments and penalties charged thereon to be paid out of the proceeds of such sale as a lien prior to all others.\r\n\r\nThe statute is not self-executingâ€”it requires a â€œmotion of any interested person . . . [w]hen any real estate shall be sold.â€&nbsp; The statute does not take effect unless a timely motion is made by an interested party.&nbsp; Just as section 12-49-60 protects and assigns priority to a tax lien, the consent order of foreclosure in this case protected the tax lien of Richland County.&nbsp; Thus, the policy underlying section 12-49-60 is similarly achieved by giving efficacy to the foreclosure order before us today.Â  The foreclosure order here is in accord with well-established South Carolina lawâ€”â€œreal property subject to taxes cannot be sold in foreclosure free of the existing tax liens, unless provision for payment is made and they are paid.â€Â  Trustees of Wofford College v. Burnett, 209 S.C. 92, 107, 39 S.E.2d 155, 161 (1946).Â  This was the law of the land in 1881, at the time the predecessor to section 12-49-60 was originally passed.Â  See Smith v. Gatewood, 3 S.C. 333, 334 (1872) (finding purchaser of real estate purchased subject to tax lien when no provision provided otherwise and taxing authority not party to sale of property); See also 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales Â§ 160 (2006) (â€œThe rule that, absent an express stipulation to the contrary in the terms of sale, a purchaser takes the property subject to valid liens ordinarily applies to liens for taxes and assessments accruing prior to the confirmation of the sale or arising after the completion of the sale.â€).\r\nJohnson argues Truesdale v. Bellinger, 172 S.C. 80, 172 S.E. 784 (1934), mandates a contrary result.&nbsp; We disagree.Â  In Truesdale, property was sold by the probate court in aid of assets.&nbsp; Id.Â  There, the probate court notified all bidders before the sale that all debts of the estate would be paid from the proceeds.&nbsp; Id. at 85, 172 S.E. at 786.Â  When the taxes due on the land were not paid from the proceeds, the successful bidder brought an action against the probate judge.&nbsp; Id.Â  Although our supreme court ultimately ruled the probate judge made an error of law in his judicial capacity that was not actionable, the court noted that a motion for payment of taxes from the proceeds of a sale (pursuant to the predecessor to section 12-49-60) may be made after the sale but before the disbursement of the proceeds.Â  Id. at 87, 172 S.E. at 787.Â  Unlike in the instant case, however, payment of the taxes due in Truesdale out of the proceeds from the sale would not have changed the terms of the sale upon which the bidders had relied in making their bids.Â  We thus find Truesdale distinguishable, for application of section 12-49-60 here after the sale, would alter the terms of the sale upon which all bidders relied in making their bids.\r\nIV.\r\nThe judgment of the Master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We further note that the Second Notice of Sale also addressed payment of taxes, ordering that â€œthe purchaser be required to pay . . . for any property taxes which become due and payable after the date of sale[.]â€Â  We view this Second Notice of Sale as consistent with the foreclosure order.Â  Even assuming, however, that there is a conflict between the terms of the foreclosure order and Second Notice of Sale, the law is settled that the foreclosure order controls.Â  See Bonney v. Granger, 300 S.C. 362, 364, 387 S.E.2d 720, 722 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œ[t]he Notice of Sale does not set forth the conditions of sale, but refers to the prior order authorizing the sale.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4166","title":"Hall v.

Greene, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission found Hall (the claimant) had not reached maximum medical improvement and ordered United/Cambridge (employer/carrier) to pay for additional medical treatment that United/Cambridge did not authorize.Â  The circuit court affirmed and United/Cambridge appealed, contending (1) the Appellate Panelâ€™s requiring payment for unauthorized medical treatment violated section 42-15-60 of the South Carolina Code, and (2) the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Hall had not reached MMI was not supported by â€œreliable, probative, and substantial evidence.â€ We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJohn Hall sustained a back injury while working for United Rentals Inc. on October 1, 1999.Â  Hall was treated by Dr. James Aymond who performed a L5-S1 discectomy and a bilateral decompression.Â  Following his back operation Hall began having right leg pain. In April 2000, Hall had additional surgery on his back.Â  Subsequently, he began experiencing swelling and pain in his right knee.Â  He was referred to Dr. John McCrosson, who performed a right total knee arthroplasty in February of 2001.Â  Dr. McCrosson discharged Hall at maximum medical improvement with regard to his knee on June 29, 2001 with 37% impairment to the lower extremity.Â  Additionally, Dr. Aymond observed that Hall had developed depression secondary to his chronic pain and referred him to Dr. Samuel Rosen for psychiatric treatment. Â United/Cambridge accepted the back injury and provided temporary benefits and medical treatment but denied compensability for the injury to his right leg and depression.Â  In the initial workersâ€™ compensation action, the single commissioner found the injury to Hallâ€™s right leg and depression were causally related to the work injury.Â  The Appellate Panel adopted the findings of the single commissioner and ordered payment of expenses related to the right leg injury and depression.Â  The circuit court affirmed. Â \r\nAfter the two back surgeries, Hall continued to experience back and lower extremity pain.Â  A regimen of physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, and an array of medications, including Oxycontin, Oxycodone,Â  Neurontin, and Bextra, was required to manage Hallâ€™s pain.Â  The use of a temporary spinal stimulator reduced the pain in Hallâ€™s lower extremities but did not alleviate any of his back pain.Â  In March 2002, Dr. Aymond noted, â€œunfortunately, Mr. Hall is approaching the end of all possible options with respect to his discogenic pain.Â  In my opinion, he is not a candidate for a lumbar decompression and fusion as he has multiple levels involved.â€Â  Dr. Aymond indicated Hall would â€œlikely be at maximum medical improvementâ€ at the time of his next visit.Â  \r\nOn June 14, 2002, Dr. Aymond opined Hall had reached maximum medical improvement and was not capable of returning to work. Dr. Aymond estimated Hallâ€™s impairment to be 14% of the spine.Â  Hall sought a second opinion from Dr. Jeffrey Wingate regarding treatment for his back pain.Â  Based on Dr. Wingateâ€™s review of Hallâ€™s x-rays, a previous MRI, and new discography studies, Dr. Wingate advised that conservative treatment had failed and suggested surgical intervention.Â  After meeting with Dr. Wingate and discussing options, Hall requested United/Cambridgeâ€™s authorization for surgical treatment by Dr. Wingate.Â  United/Cambridge denied Hallâ€™s request. Nevertheless, Hall proceeded with the recommended surgery.\r\nIn June 2002, Hall underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion with instrumentation.Â  Two weeks after surgery, Dr. Wingate reported â€œJohn has done well since going home.Â  He has continued decreasing his pain medication and takes a single Lortab less than once every 6-8 hrs.â€Â  On Hallâ€™s July 2002 follow up visit, Dr. Wingate noted, â€œ[f]or the most part his back and legs feel much better.â€Â  Dr. Wingate indicated Hall was â€œwalking well and [had] return[ed] to a better activity level.â€ Â \r\nAt his five-week follow up visit after surgery, Hallâ€™s chief concern was left shoulder pain.Â  Dr. Wingate explained, â€œ[h]e complained about the left shoulder early after surgery.Â  He seems now to be developing a more global problem with it.â€Â  Later records revealed Hall suffered a left brachial plexus injury which likely resulted from his positioning on the operating table during the back surgery performed by Dr. Wingate.Â  In addition, Hall sustained paralysis of his left hemidiaphram during the surgery.Â  Consequently, Hall consulted additional doctors, including Dr. Wayne Vial and Dr. George Khoury, to treat the diaphragm and shoulder injuries.Â  However, Hallâ€™s shoulder pain continued to worsen and he experienced shortness of breath after minimal physical activity.\r\nNotwithstanding the complications, Dr. Wingateâ€™s surgery reduced Hallâ€™s back and leg pain for a period of time.Â  Three months after the surgery, Dr. Wingate observed, â€œ[Hallâ€™s] having about half the level of back pain that he had pre-surgery.Â  Overall he feels that his relief from the back and leg pain has been significant and worth the effort of going through surgery.â€Â  \r\nBy May 2003, Hall was again reporting back and leg pain and it appeared the pain may be caused by the loosening of screws placed during the spinal surgery.Â  Hall continued having shoulder pain as well, but the pain had decreased from previous reports.Â  \r\nHall filed a Form 50, seeking workersâ€™ compensation coverage for Dr. Wingateâ€™s treatment.Â  In addition, he sought payment for the treatment necessitated by the brachial plexopathy and the paralyzed diaphragm.Â  The single commissioner found, â€œ[t]he treatment by Dr. Wingate was necessary and tended to lessen Claimantâ€™s disability.Â  No other alternative was offered by the Defendants.â€Â  The single commissioner concluded:Â  \r\n\r\nThe Employer shall pay or cause to be paid all causally related medical treatment from the date of Claimantâ€™s accident and continuing. This responsibility includes but is not limited to those providers approved by Commissioner Catoeâ€™s Order of October 23, 2001, and shall in addition include the treatment of Doctors Wingate, Vial, and Khoury, and any other physician that has treated or evaluated the Claimant with reference to his back injury and his brachial plexopathy and collapsed diaphragm which resulted from complications from his two level fusion by Dr Wingate.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel adopted the findings and conclusions of the single commissioner and incorporated the commissionerâ€™s order into the final decision.Â  The circuit court affirmed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004). Section 1-23-380(A)(5) instructs that a reviewing court: \r\n\r\nmay not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are: \r\n(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; \r\n(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; \r\n(c) made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n(d) affected by other error of law; \r\n(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006).\r\nA reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 457, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law. Â Liberty\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision.Â  Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 628 S.E.2d 262 (Ct. App. 2006); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002); see Â Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€).Â  Pursuant to the APA, this courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 610 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. # 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); see Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.â€). \r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Â Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Gadson, 368 S.C. at 222, 628 S.E.2d at 266.Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of the Appellate Panel which are supported by substantial evidence. Â Id.; Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999). Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004); Jones v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 586 S.E.2d 111 (2003).\r\nThe Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 617 S.E.2d 369 (Ct. App. 2005); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495. The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); Smith v. NCCI Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 631 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 2006); DuRant v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 604 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Where there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive. Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2005); Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Mullinax v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 435, 458 S.E.2d 76, 78 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œWhere the medical evidence conflicts, the findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Medical Treatment\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Appellate Panelâ€™s discretion to prescribe additional medical treatment tending to lessen the period of disability.\r\nUnited/Cambridge argues the Appellate Panelâ€™s order requiring United/Cambridge to pay for additional medical treatment by Drs. Wingate, Vial, Khoury, and any other physician with reference to Hallâ€™s back injury violates section 42-15-60 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Specifically, United/Cambridge maintains Hall was required to receive only medical treatment prescribed by the authorized physician, Dr. Aymond.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn this state, â€œ[t]he construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration should be accorded great deference and will not be overruled without a compelling reason.â€Â  Risinger v. Knight Textiles, 353 S.C. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 222, 224 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Vulcan Materials Co. v. Greenville County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 342 S.C. 480, 496, 536 S.E.2d 892, 900 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  â€œ[T]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the court must ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature and in interpreting a statute, the court must give the words their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to a tortured construction which limits or expands the statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # 10420, 353 S.C. 100, 113, 576 S.E.2d 191, 198 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting State v. Dickinson, 339 S.C. 194, 199, 528 S.E.2d 675, 677 (Ct. App. 2000)). â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€ Id., (quoting TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998)). \r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act does not limit the Appellate Panelâ€™s ability to order a change in medical care provided to a claimant when necessary.Â  See id. at 114, 576 S.E.2d at 198.Â  The Panel is afforded much discretion under Section 42-15-60.Â  Id.Â  Section 42-15-60 provides: \r\n\r\nMedical, surgical, hospital and other treatment, including medical and surgical supplies as may reasonably be required, for a period not exceeding ten weeks from the date of an injury to effect a cure or give relief and for such additional time as in the judgment of the Commission will tend to lessen the period of disability and, in addition thereto, such original artificial members as may be reasonably necessary at the end of the healing period shall be provided by the employer. In case of a controversy arising between employer and employee, the Commission may order such further medical, surgical, hospital or other treatment as may in the discretion of the Commission be necessary. During the whole or any part of the remainder of disability resulting from the injury the employer may, at his own option, continue to furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the employee, and the employee shall accept an attending physician, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission and, in addition, such surgical and hospital service and supplies as may be deemed necessary by such attending physician or the Commission. The refusal of an employee to accept any medical, hospital, surgical or other treatment when provided by the employer or ordered by the Commission shall bar such employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases and no compensation shall at any time be paid for the period of suspension unless in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances justified the refusal, in which case the Commission may order a change in the medical or hospital service. \r\n\r\nS. C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\nSouth Carolina has a rich jurisprudential history in the area of medical care.Â  The medical benefits provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act allows the Appellate Panel to award medical benefits beyond ten weeks from the date of injury only where it determines such medical treatment would tend to lessen the period of disability.Â  Dykes v. Daniel Const. Co., 262 S.C. 98, 202 S.E.2d 646 (1974); Williams v. Boyle Const. Co., 252 S.C. 387, 166 S.E.2d 550 (1969); Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 514 S.E.2d 593 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Generally, even though a claimant has reached maximum medical improvement (MMI), if additional medical care or treatment would â€œtend to lessen the period of disability,â€ then the Appellate Panel may be warranted in requiring such treatment to at least maintain the claimantâ€™s degree of physical impairment.Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 81, 564 S.E.2d 354, 358 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œHowever, the fact a claimant has reached maximum medical improvement does not preclude a finding the claimant may still require additional medical care or treatment.â€Â  Dodge, 334 S.C. at 581, 514 S.E.2d at 596.Â  Therefore, â€œan employer may be liable for a claimantâ€™s future medical treatment if it tends to lessen the claimantâ€™s period of disability despite the fact the claimant has returned to work and has reached [MMI].â€Â  Lee, 350 S.C. at 81, 564 S.E.2d at 358 (quoting Dodge, 334 S.C. at 583, 514 S.E.2d at 598).Â  Concomitantly, a finding of MMI does not necessarily establish that the claimant is no longer disabled; unless the Appellate Panel finds disability has ended, it is presumed to continue. See Swinton v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 202, 203-04, 442 S.E.2d 215, 216 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œThe single commissionerâ€™s finding of maximum medical improvement did not establish that [the claimant] was no longer disabled as of May 21, 1990. Without such a finding, [the claimantâ€™s] disability was presumed to continue.â€); see also Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse, Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995) (renewing prescriptions for pain killer was not inconsistent with finding MMI; rather physicianâ€™s report concluding employee had reached MMI, coupled with continuation of prescriptive medicines constituted substantial evidence from which Appellate Panel could conclude medication helped alleviate employeeâ€™s remaining symptoms, but medical condition would not improve); Â Scruggs v. Tuxcarora Yarns, Inc., 294 S.C. 47, 50, 362 S.E.2d 319, 321 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding substantial medical evidence existed that claimant, who was still undergoing physical therapy, had reached MMI with respect to her back injury); \r\nIn the seminal case of Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., the circuit court held the Appellate Panel erred as a matter of law in concluding Bruccoli was no longer required to pay Dodgeâ€™s medical benefits because he had reached MMI. 334 S.C. 574, 514 S.E.2d 593 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Citing section 42-15-60, this court agreed, instructing that â€œ[t]his section clearly â€˜allows the [Appellate Panel] to award medical benefits beyond 10 weeks from the date of injury only where the [Panel] determines such medical treatment would tend to lessen the period of disability.â€™ â€Â  Id. at 580, 514 S.E.2d at 596 (quoting Sanders v. Litchfield Country Club, 297 S.C. 339, 344, 377 S.E.2d 111, 114 (Ct. App. 1989)).Â  Dodgeâ€™s physician opined he required continued medication and treatment to maintain his level of functioning.Â  On remand from the circuit court â€œ[t]he [Appellate Panel] awarded Dodge further medical treatment and medication which would prevent his partially disabling condition from becoming incapacitating and lessen the ultimate period of disability.â€ Id. at 578, 514 S.E.2d at 595.[1]  \r\nSubsequently, in Adkins v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., the Appellate Panel concluded a worker who suffered a weakening of the tympanic membrane, but had reached MMI with no permanent disability, was nevertheless entitled to ongoing medical benefits.Â  350 S.C. 34, 564 S.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2002). Adkins needed continued medical treatment for chronic ear infections which her physician opined could be controlled by medication.Â  The treatment eliminated Adkinâ€™s nausea and dizziness, allowing her to work at her normal occupation without interruption.Â  The court of appeals reversed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Adkins was not entitled to future medical benefits, concluding:\r\n\r\n[o]nce it is determined the claimant suffered a compensable injury, South Carolina law provides future medical costs can be awarded if the [Appellate Panel] determines the award will tend to lessen the time during which the claimant is unable to earn, in the same or other employment, the wages he or she received at the time of the injury. \r\n\r\nId. at 37, 564 S.E.2d at 340.Â  Relying on section 42-15-60, this court decided the evidence supported the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that, even though Adkins was not disabled, future medical treatment would tend to lessen her period of disability by keeping her from becoming disabled.Â  Id. at 38, 564 S.E.2d at 341.\r\nIn the case of a permanently disabled claimant, the legislature anticipated the need for continuing medical care and treatment throughout the claimantâ€™s lifetime.Â  When â€œtotal and permanent disability results, reasonable and necessary . . . treatment or care shall be paid during the life of the injured employee . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (Supp. 2005).Â  Accordingly, though a claimant may remain permanently disabled, â€œfurther medical treatment may improve [the claimantâ€™s] quality of life and ability to cope without improving the overall disability rating.â€Â  Pearson v. JPS Converter &amp; Indus. Corp., 327 S.C. 393, 399, 489 S.E.2d 219, 222 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nIn the case sub judice, Hall sought treatment from United/Cambridgeâ€™s authorized provider, Dr. Aymond.Â  However, Dr. Aymond opined further surgical treatment was not advisable.Â  Hall remained in pain and sought a second opinion.Â  Upon receiving the opinion of Dr. Wingate indicating further surgical intervention may be helpful, Hall specifically requested authorization for the suggested treatment.Â  In addition, Hall testified that if United/Cambridge had, instead, referred him to another doctor for an opinion or treatment, he would have complied with that referral.Â  United/Cambridge nevertheless denied Hallâ€™s request.Â  Apodictically, as in Dodge and Adkins, the Appellate Panel had the discretion to authorize additional medical treatment that would tend to lessen Hallâ€™s period of disability.  \r\nThe evidentiary record fully supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that the treatment by Dr. Wingate was necessary and beneficial.Â  The pain in Hallâ€™s back and lower extremities continued to worsen after the two surgeries performed by Dr. Aymond.Â  The surgery by Dr. Wingate lessened this pain significantly for nine months or more.Â  Unfortunately, while in surgery, Hall suffered complications necessitating additional medical treatment.Â  Yet the main purpose of the surgery, to relieve the back pain, was successful.Â  Hall testified, â€œI do not have the degree of pain that I had before I had the fusion. . . . I, in fact, can say I felt overall better.â€Â  Dr. Wingateâ€™s medical reports indicate that shortly after surgery Hall experienced increasing relief from back pain and improved mobility. At just over three months after the operation, Hall reported significant relief, having about half the level of back and leg pain he had prior to surgery.Â  Nine months after surgery, Hallâ€™s back and hip pain was no longer the severe pain he had before surgery.Â  Conclusively, the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision to require additional medical treatment that tended to lessen Hallâ€™s period of disability and provided some relief for his intractable pain is in accord with the discretion authorized in section 42-15-60.Â  Though Hall remained essentially disabled, the additional treatment improved his overall quality of life and ability to cope.\r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Appellate Panelâ€™s discretion to authorize medical providers.\r\nUnited/Cambridge contends the Appellate Panel erred in requiring payment to unauthorized physicians because section 42-15-60 obligated Hall to accept treatment only from an authorized treating physician.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe Workerâ€™s Compensation Act provides that the employer names the authorized treating physician once a case has been accepted.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-509 (1976) (â€œThe employerâ€™s representative chooses an authorized health care provider and pays for authorized treatment.â€); Clark v. Aiken County Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102, 620 S.E.2d 99 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Generally, a claimant may obtain compensation only by accepting services from the employerâ€™s choice of providers.Â  Id.Â  However, a claimant is not required to sacrifice much-needed treatment merely to comply with an employerâ€™s choice of physicians. See Risinger v. Knight Textiles, 353 S.C. 69, 73, 577 S.E.2d 222, 224-25 (2002) (holding â€œthe language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 does not allow an employer to dictate the medical treatment of injured employees.â€).Â  \r\nThe Appellate Panel, when necessary, may override the employerâ€™s choice of providers and order a change in the medical or hospital service provided. Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # 10420, 353 S.C. 100, 576 S.E.2d 191, (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Ultimately, the Appellate Panel is authorized and empowered to order further medical care and payment for that medical care when controversies arise between a claimant and the employer. Clark, 366 S.C. at 112, 620 S.E.2d at 104-05; Gattis, 353 S.C. at 111, 576 S.E.2d at 196-97. Â The controlling language in section 42-15-60 provides: \r\n\r\n[i]n case of a controversy arising between employer and employee, the Commission may order such further medical, surgical, hospital or other treatment as may in the discretion of the Commission be necessary . . . and the employee shall accept an attending physician, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission and, in addition, such surgical and hospital service and supplies as may be deemed necessary by such attending physician or the Commission.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Clark, this court analyzed Ford v. Allied Chemical Corp., 252 S.C. 561, 167 S.E.2d 564 (1969) with regard to this issue.Â  As explicated in Clark, the claimant in Ford sustained a neck and head injury.Â  His treating physician determined nothing further could be done to alleviate the claimantâ€™s pain and â€œsuggested only that he buy some aspirin and return to work.â€Â  Ford, 252 S.C. at 565, 167 S.E.2d at 566.Â  The claimantâ€™s family physician referred him to another orthopedic surgeon who placed claimant in the hospital for further treatment.Â  Id.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusion the claimant was justified in seeking care from a doctor other than his employerâ€™s authorized medical provider and awarded compensation.Â  Id. at 567, 167 S.E.2d at 567.\r\nUnder similar circumstances in Clark, this court reasoned:Â  â€œDr. Epstein [the authorized treating physician] indicated Clark was not a suitable candidate for treatment and referred him for pain management.â€ Clark, 366 S.C. at 111-112, 620 S.E.2d at 104. That treatment was unsuccessful.Â  Id. at 112, 620 S.E.2d at 104.Â  â€œBecause Clark related the continuing symptoms to the treating physicians and was unable to obtain relief, he was justified in seeking treatment elsewhere.â€Â  Clark, 366 S.C. at 114, 620 S.E.2d at 105.Â  We explained:Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough the more appropriate procedure would have been for Clark to seek an order from the full commission before engaging Dr. Greenberg [unauthorized physician] for treatment and surgery, we find that under Ford the full commission was not outside its discretion in ordering the County to pay for the surgery and continuing treatment, once it determined the treatment was medically necessary.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Dr. Aymond presented only conservative options to treat Hallâ€™s worsening condition, and United/Cambridge did not offer an alternative approach through another physician or allow Hall to seek a second opinion. On the other hand, Dr. Wingate, after conducting additional diagnostic studies, presented Hall with the possibility of relief from his intractable pain.Â  Luculently, as in Clark and Ford, the Appellate Panel had discretion to authorize medically necessary treatment by Dr. Wingate and to require payment of Hallâ€™s treatment and causally related medical expenses.\r\nUnited/Cambridge complains Hallâ€™s treatment by Dr. Wingate resulted in new injuries requiring additional medical treatment by Drs. Vial and Khoury.Â  United/Cambridge asserts it should not be responsible for the medical costs associated with those consequential injuries.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 42-15-70 of the South Carolina Code addresses the liability of the employer for medical treatment of injuries resulting from medical treatment of the work-related injury.Â  Specifically, the statute states:\r\n\r\nthe employer shall not be liable in damages for malpractice by a physician or surgeon furnished by him pursuant to the provisions of this section, but the consequences of any such malpractice shall be deemed part of the injury resulting from the accident and shall be compensated for as such. [2]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-70 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added); see Mullinax v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 436, 458 S.E.2d 76, 79 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing Whitfield v. Daniel Constr. Co., 226 S.C. 37, 41, 83 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1954) for the proposition that new injuries resulting indirectly from treatment for the original injury are compensable). \r\nDr. Wingateâ€™s medical records show Hall sustained brachial plexopathy and paralysis of the left diaphragm that â€œmost probablyâ€ resulted from positioning on the operating table during surgery.Â  Drs. Vial and Khoury concurred with Dr. Wingateâ€™s assessment.Â  Consequently, Hallâ€™s new injuries are deemed part of the injury resulting from the original accident and are, therefore, compensable by United/Cambridge.Â  \r\nII.Â  MMI\r\nUnited/Cambridge avers the circuit court erred when it affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Hall had not reached MMI.Â  United/Cambridge urges no â€œreliable, probative, and substantial evidenceâ€ existed to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusion. Â We disagree.\r\nMMI is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that, in the physicianâ€™s opinion, no further medical care or treatment will lessen the period of impairment.Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 622 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 2005); Lee v. Harborside Cafe, 350 S.C. 74, 564 S.E.2d 354 (Ct. App. 2002). Â â€œMMI is a factual determination left to the discretion of the [Appellate] [P]anel.â€Â  Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 224, 628 S.E.2d 262, 268 (Ct. App. 2006). Â â€œIt is not within our province to reverse findings of the [A]ppellate [P]anel which are supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Bass, 366 S.C. at 458-59, 622 S.E.2d at 581.Â  â€œAny disagreements in the evidence are to be resolved exclusively by the Appellate Panel.â€ Martin v. Rapid Plumbing, 369 S.C. 278, 278, 631 S.E.2d 547, 553 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999) (instructing that the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings of fact are conclusive as to conflicting evidence, whether from different witnesses or from the same witness,)); Nettles v. Spartanburg School Dist. #7, 341 S.C. 580, 535 S.E.2d 146 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThis courtâ€™s review is restricted to the evidence considered by the [A]ppellate [P]anel in reaching its decision.â€Â  Martin, 369 S.C. at 278, 631 S.E.2d at 553.\r\nSubstantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Hall had not reached MMI.Â  When released by Dr. Aymond, Hall required a complex regimen of narcotic medication and epidural steroid injections to manage his pain.Â  Dr. Wingate prescribed further diagnostic studies, including discography.Â  Based on those results and Dr. Wingateâ€™s opinion that conservative treatment had failed, Hall underwent surgery. Approximately two months after surgery Hall was able to discontinue most narcotic pain medication and nearly one year post-operatively Hallâ€™s low back and hip pain remained better than before surgery.Â  Dr. Wingateâ€™s diagnostic findings, the failure of conservative treatment in relieving Hallâ€™s intractable pain, and the significant, albeit temporary, improvement in Hallâ€™s back and leg pain is sufficient evidence to affirm the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Hall had not reached\r\nMMI.&nbsp; \r\nUnited/Cambridge claims the Appellate Panel improperly weighed the medical evidence in concluding Hall had not reached MMI.Â  We disagree. \r\nExpert medical testimony is designed to aid the Appellate Panel in coming to the correct conclusion.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846; Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Therefore, the Appellate Panel determines the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.Â  Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846; Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 293-94, 599 S.E.2d at 613; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct.App.2002).Â  Once admitted, expert testimony is to be considered just like any other testimony. Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846; Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 294, 599 S.E.2d at 613; Corbin, 351 S.C. at 624, 571 S.E.2d at 98.Â  Although medical testimony is entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if there is other competent evidence in the record.Â  Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 294, 599 S.E.2d at 613; see Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846 (confirming that medical testimony should not be held conclusive irrespective of other evidence).\r\nIn the instant case, the Appellate Panel was confronted with conflicting expert evidence.Â  Dr. Aymond declared he believed Hall reached MMI and estimated 14% impairment of Hallâ€™s spine.Â  Dr. Wingate, on the other hand, determined further treatment was possible and would alleviate some of Hallâ€™s pain and disability.Â  Moreover, after the surgery by Dr. Wingate, Hallâ€™s condition improved with regard to his back pain, lower extremity pain, and mobility.Â  Considering the record as a whole, evidence existed which would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Appellate Panel reached. Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not improperly determine the weight and credit it assigned the expert evidence in finding Hall had not reached MMI.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold section 42-15-60 authorized the Appellate Panel, in its discretion: (1) to order additional medical care that tended to lessen the claimantâ€™s period of disability, and (2) to order treatment, when necessary, from medical providers not previously authorized by the employer. \r\nSubstantial evidence exists to substantiate that the treatment by Dr. Wingate was necessary and beneficial to lessen Hallâ€™s disability and to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination that Hall had not yet reached MMI at the time of the hearing.Â  In addition, the treatment of the new injuries resulting from the medical treatment of Hallâ€™s work-related injury is compensable by United/Cambridge.\r\nAccordingly, the decision is of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J. and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Bruccoli appealed the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling on remand. This court then remanded the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling for the purposes of determining whether continued medical care after MMI would lessen Dodgeâ€™s period of disability.\r\n[2] There is no mention in the record of a malpractice claim, nor does this court address the viability of such a claim.Â  We cite S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-70 solely to illustrate the legislatureâ€™s intention that injuries resulting from medical treatment of a work-related injury are to be compensated as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4167","title":"Frierson v.

Frierson (collectively, the â€œFriersonsâ€) brought this declaratory judgment action against David L. Watson and others to establish an easement for the use of a hallway between two adjoining buildings.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to the Friersons, finding they had established an easement for the hallway.Â  Watson appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Friersons[2] have a two-story building at the corner of East Main Street and Pendleton Street in Easley, South Carolina.Â  The building shares a common wall with an adjacent two-story building owned by Watson and his wife.[3]Â  An outdoor stairway located on Watsonâ€™s property provides access to the second floor of both buildings.Â  This dispute arose when Watson began to construct apartments on the second floor of his building and proposed to close off a connecting hallway at the top of the stairs.Â  The Friersons assert they have an easement to use the outdoor stairway as well as the hallway to access the second floor of their building.[4]Â  They allege Watsonâ€™s construction violates their easement because it would deny them access to the second floor.Â  Watson does not dispute an easement exists for the stairway, but maintains there is no easement for the hallway and the Friersons would not be denied access to the upper floor of their building because there is a stairway inside the Frierson building.\r\nA review of the real estate records shows the Friersonsâ€™ predecessors-in-interest, E.C., E.O., and D.M. Frierson, purchased the building in 1929 from the â€œEstate of R.F. Smith, Inc.â€Â  The 1929 deed, dated January 14 and recorded on January 23, expressly conveyed â€œan easement in a certain four foot stair-way in the back of the building, with right of ingress and egress on said stairway to the second story of said building.â€Â Â Â  \r\nOn January 21, 1929, two days before the deed was recorded, the parties to the sale executed a â€œMemorandum of Agreementâ€ concerning an easement for the use of the hallway.Â  Although the agreement was signed, it was never recorded.Â  The agreement stated in relevant part:Â  \r\n\r\n[T]he party of the first part [Estate of R.F. Smith, Inc.] has sold to the parties of the second part [E.C., E.O. and D.M. Frierson], a certain brick building at the corner of Main and Pendleton Streets, the second story of which is not partitioned, but one-half belongs to each of the parties hereto.Â  There are offices constructed over the building of the parties of the second part covering practically the width of their building.Â  As a part of the consideration of the sale of this property, the party of the first part grants to the parties of the second part, the right to use the hall-way on the second floor as long as the said room remains unpartioned [sic] by brick and continuous through to the roof.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Friersons currently use the first floor of their building to operate a drug store.Â  Over the years, the family used the second floor for a variety of purposes.Â  At one point, it was a Masonic lodge.Â  Later, the family rented the second story to doctors, dentists, and others as office space and visitors used the hallway to access those offices.Â  The second floor eventually became unusable and the family utilized it for storage and for private office space.Â  The Frierson building passed through the estate of E.O. Frierson, one of the original parties named in the deed, to Virginia Friersonâ€™s husband, E.C. Frierson, III, and then through the husbandâ€™s estate to Virginia.Â  \r\nIn 2002, Watson and his wife purchased the two-story building adjacent to the Friersonsâ€™ building from Goodwill Industries of Upper South Carolina, Inc.Â  The deed, recorded June 6, 2002, noted an easement as follows:Â  â€œThis conveyance is made subject to an easement granted E.C. Frierson, et al. to use the stairway along this common line as ingress and egress to the second story of the Frierson building (See Deed Book 3-V at Page 229).â€Â  The 2002 deed also referenced â€œa plat prepared by J.C. Smith &amp; Associates, Surveyors, for Goodwill Industries of Upper South Carolina, Inc. dated April 23, 2002 . . . .â€Â  The plat showed access to the second floor via an external door, a twenty-eight foot stairway, and a forty-foot portion of an upstairs hallway. Â Â \r\nWatsonâ€™s closing attorney wrote a title opinion on June 3, 2002, prior to the closing, noting Goodwill was the owner of the property subject to easements for use of the exterior door, stairway, and hallway:\r\n\r\nGoodwill Industries of Upper South Carolina, Inc. is the fee simple owner of said property subject, however, to the following exceptions . . . Easement as to Tract No. 2., granted to E.C. Frierson, E.O. Frierson and D.M. Frierson, their heirs and assigns . . . and such easements or rights-of-way to the exterior door, stairwell and hallway as [shown] on a plat dated April 23, 2002, by Smith Surveyors, Inc. for Goodwill Industries of Upper South Carolina, Inc.Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing the purchase, Watson began constructing apartments on the second floor of their building.Â  He planned to place one of those apartments where the hallway was located.Â  The Friersons brought this declaratory judgment action to establish an easement to the hallway.Â  They also sought an injunction to stop Watsonâ€™s construction and additionally asserted claims for trespass and breach of contract.Â  The Friersons claimed Watsonâ€™s construction violated their easement by eliminating the hallway, which denied them access to the second floor of their building.Â  \r\nDuring his deposition for discovery, Watson testified that he saw the survey containing the hallway easement either at closing or up to one week prior to closing, but he did not realize until after closing that the survey was actually part of the deed.Â  Watson further testified that he received (1) either a copy of the 1929 deed or a document including the same language as the deed that granted an easement for the stairway and (2) a copy of the subsequent Memorandum of Agreement from 1929 that granted an easement for the hallway.Â  Also prior to the closing, Watson and a previous owner of the building had a conversation about an ongoing dispute with the Friersons about the hallway; during this conversation the previous owner informed Watson that the Friersons were claiming a right to use the hallway.Â  Watson acknowledged that an easement to only the top of the stairway served no purpose for the Friersons without some way to access their second floor from it.Â  \r\nThe Friersons moved for summary judgment.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court determined the Friersons had established an easement for use of the hallway by grant and by prescription and granted the Friersonsâ€™ motion.Â  Watson appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court may determine summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter,&nbsp;328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58&nbsp;(1997).\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002); see also Baird v. Charleston County,&nbsp;333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74&nbsp;(1999) (â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Watson contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the Friersons and determining they had established an easement by grant to use the hallway.Â  Specifically, Watson asserts the 1929 deed granting an easement for use of the stairway does not refer to the hallway and the Memorandum of Agreement granting the hallway easement was not recorded. \r\nâ€œAn easement is a right which one person has to use the land of another for a specific purpose.â€Â  Steele v. Williams, 204 S.C. 124, 132, 28 S.E.2d 644, 647&nbsp;(1944).Â  This right of way over land may arise in three ways:Â  (1) from\r\nnecessity, (2) by grant, and (3) by prescription.Â  Id. at 132, 28 S.E.2d at 647-48; see also Sandy Island Corp. v. Ragsdale, 246 S.C. 414, 419, 143 S.E.2d 803, 806&nbsp;(1965) (â€œOne of the ways of creating an easement is by an express written grant.â€).Â  \r\nâ€œA reservation of an easement in a deed by which lands are conveyed is equivalent, for the purpose of the creation of the easement, to an express grant of the easement by the grantee of the lands.â€ \r\n    Sandy Island Corp., 246 S.C. at 419, 143 S.E.2d at 806.\r\nÂ â€œ â€˜A grant of an easement is to be construed in accordance with the rules applied to deeds and other written instruments.â€™ â€Â  Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist., 348 S.C. 58, 71, 558 S.E.2d 902, 909 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 57 (1996)).Â  Both deeds and easements are valid to subsequent purchasers without notice when they are recorded.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  The purpose of the recording statute is to protect a subsequent buyer without notice.Â  Burnett v. Holliday Bros., 279 S.C. 222, 225, 305 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1983).Â  Additionally, one who already has notice of the existence of any instrument will be bound by such notice whether the instrument is recorded or not.Â  First Presbyterian Church v. York Depository, 203 S.C. 410, 416, 27 S.E.2d 573, 576 (1943).\r\nNotice of a deed is notice of its entire contents and whatever matters one would have learned upon the inquiry that the instrument made it oneâ€™s duty to pursue.Â  Binkley, 348 S.C. at 71, 558 S.E.2d at 909.Â  Further, â€œwhere a deed describes land as is shown as a certain plat, such becomes a part of the deed.â€Â  Carolina Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 105, 217 S.E.2d 16, 19 (1975).Â  The law imputes to a purchaser of real property notice of the recitals contained in the written instruments forming the purchaserâ€™s chain of title and charges him with the duty of making such reasonable inquiry and investigation as is suggested by the recitals and references therein contained.Â  McDonald v. Welborn, 220 S.C. 10, 16, 66 S.E.2d 327, 330&nbsp;(1951); LoPresti v. Burry, 364 S.C. 271, 276, 612 S.E.2d 730, 732-33 (Ct. App. 2005); see also S. Ry., Carolina Div. v. Howell, 79 S.C. 281, 286, 60 S.E. 677, 679 (1908) (finding the equivalence of notice in circumstances where one has knowledge of such facts as were sufficient to put one on inquiry, which if pursued with due diligence, would have led to the knowledge of oneâ€™s rights).\r\nAn easement by grant is not required to be recorded to be valid.Â  Although notice is assumed when a document conveying an interest in real property is recorded, recording is not necessary if the buyer has actual notice.Â  In this case, Watson testified regarding the numerous ways in which he knew about the hallway easement - his deed contained a survey noting the hallway easement and the previous owner had informed him of an ongoing dispute over the hallway.Â  Further, Watson testified that he received a document that granted the easement to the stairway and that he knew an easement only to the stairway itself provided the Friersons with no way of accessing their second story from the stairway.Â  Additionally, Watsonâ€™s attorney prepared a title opinion which included the hallway easement and, most importantly, Watson actually received a copy of the unrecorded document granting the hallway easement.Â  Watson, moreover, testified at his deposition that he has been involved in purchasing and developing real estate for at least ten years.Â  As the circuit court noted in its order, â€œWatson is a sophisticated businessman experienced in real estate.â€Â  The unrecorded document clearly granted an easement to the hallway and Watson had the document prior to closing.Â  We therefore hold the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the Friersons on the basis they had established an easement by grant.[5]Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Virginia Frierson held title to the property when this litigation began.Â  Virginia Frierson subsequently died and her sons, Ed Frierson, IV and Allie S. Frierson, as the personal representatives of her estate, were substituted for her in this action.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  Watson and his wife, Patricia, are the title holders to the property; however, the Notice of Appeal names Watson as the appealing party.Â  \r\n[4]Â  According to the Friersonsâ€™ Amended Complaint, the easement they seek is for the use of â€œ28 feet up the stairway and 40 feet down the hallway.â€Â  \r\n[5]Â  Because we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s award of summary judgment to the Friersons on the basis they established their right to an easement by grant, we need not address their entitlement to summary judgment on the additional basis that they had established the existence of an easement by prescription.Â  See Matthews v. Dennis, 365 S.C. 245, 248 n.2, 616 S.E.2d 437, 439 n.2 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting where the court affirmed the existence of an easement by prescription, it was unnecessary to address whether there was also an easement by necessity); see also Futch v.

Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Trousdell v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 639, 572 S.E.2d 264, 265 (2002)).Â  The judgment may be affirmed only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Â Â The reviewing court must consider the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Estate of Cantrell by Cantrell v. Green, 302 S.C. 557, 559, 397 S.E.2d 777, 778 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sovereign Immunity\r\nHuggins contends the circuit court erred in determining that his federal and state claims were identical and that the federal courtâ€™s determinations were dispositive of his state claims.Â  Huggins argues the federal court addressed only the reasonableness of the Police actions at the time immediately prior to Deceasedâ€™s shooting and that the state claim alleges negligence in the time frame leading up to the moment preceding the shooting.Â Â  We need not reach these issues in the disposition of this matter.\r\nThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Act) is â€œthe exclusive civil remedy available for any tort committed by a governmental entity, its employees, or its agents except as provided in Â§ 15-78-70(b).â€[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(b) (Supp. 2005).Â  The Act waives sovereign immunity â€œwhile also providing specific, enumerated exceptions limiting the liability of the state and its political subdivisions in certain circumstances.â€Â  Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 302, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  One such exception to the waiver of immunity is found in section 15-78-60(6) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) which states: â€œThe governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from: (6) civil disobedience, riot, insurrection, or rebellion or the failure to provide the method of providing police or fire protection.â€[2]Â  \r\nHuggins argued before the circuit court that unlike the federal claim, this state claim was about the preparation and events leading up to the time immediately preceding the shooting of Deceased.Â  This action concerns the manner in which the police chose to provide police protection.Â  Because the Act specifically exempts the Police from liability concerning the methods which they choose to utilize to provide police protection, we need not address Hugginsâ€™s other claims.Â  Even were we to accept all of Hugginsâ€™s assertions as true, it would not remove the immunity which the legislature has bestowed on the Police in this situation.Â  We find no genuine issues of material fact, and, therefore, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s granting of summary judgment.[3]Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s granting of summary judgment.Â  Based on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Section 15-78-70(b) states an employee of a governmental entity is not granted immunity from suit by this chapter if the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within the scope of his official duties, constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude. \r\n[2] This court has previously held this statute contains a scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  The conjunctive â€œorâ€ is missing.Â  Therefore, the statute is properly read as the governmental entity is not liable for the failure to provide or the method of providing police or fire protection. (See Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 304, 501 S.E.2d 746, 750 (Ct. App. 1998)).\r\n[3] Although the argument regarding immunity under the Tort Claims Act was not decided by the circuit court, this court â€œmay affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4169","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: William Snowdon appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the introduction of marijuana discovered on his person during a search incident to his arrest. We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nLocal police received a complaint of a disturbance at Snowdon's home. When the officers arrived at the scene, Snowdon was standing in his front yard &quot;grossly intoxicated.&quot; He was arrested for breach of the peace. During a search incident to the arrest, the officer discovered a small quantity of marijuana in Snowdon's wallet. Snowdon was charged with breach of the peace and possession of marijuana.\r\nSnowdon subsequently pled guilty to breach of the peace in magistrate court. Thereafter, and while he was on trial in circuit court for the marijuana charge, Snowdon sought to suppress introduction of the marijuana, arguing that it was the fruit of a search following an illegal arrest made without probable cause. The trial court determined Snowdon's guilty plea in magistrate court precluded him from contesting the legality of his arrest and, a fortiori, the search incident thereto. Snowdon was convicted of possession of marijuana and sentenced to one year in prison.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the\r\ntrial court's sound discretion. State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004). The court's ruling will not be disturbed unless a manifest abuse of discretion and probable prejudice are evident.  Id.  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. Â State v. Wallace, 364 S.C. 130, 135, 611 S.E.2d 322, 335 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGenerally, a knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims of constitutional violations.  Rivers v. Strickland, 264 S.C. 121, 124, 213 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1975).  &quot;A defendant who pleads guilty usually may not later raise independent claims of constitutional violations.&quot; \r\nGibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 523, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999). \r\nSnowdon does not contend that his guilty plea to breach of the peace was involuntary, nor does he assert that the search itself was otherwise improper.  He relies solely on the contention that the officer's warrantless arrest for breach of the peace was without probable cause and therefore violated his constitutional rights.  Continuing, he reasons the unconstitutional arrest made the search that was incident thereto improper, thereby requiring suppression of any evidence obtained as a result.  This contention is without merit.  Having pled guilty to breach of peace, Snowdon has waived any objection he may have had, and cannot, therefore, assert constitutionally based violations attendant to his initial arrest and the legal consequences flowing\r\ntherefrom. \r\nIn addition, Snowdon is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the validity of his arrest.[2] &quot;Collateral estoppel prevents a\r\nparty from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.&quot; Koon v. State, 358 S.C. 359, 364-365, 595 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2004) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)) (citing Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003)).  Because Snowdon pled guilty to breach of the peace, the issue of whether there was probable cause to arrest him for that offense was necessarily determined in the magistrate court proceeding.  Consequently, the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents Snowdon from raising that issue again at his trial for possession of marijuana.\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n[2]  Collateral estoppel can be used in a criminal proceeding.  See State v. Brown, 201 S.C. 417, 424, 23 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1942) (holding that defendant was estopped from relitigating the value of stolen goods in magistrate court where circuit court determined value and remanded to magistrate court based on that determination).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4170","title":"Ligon v.

Ligon appeals.Â  We reinstate the verdict.Â  \r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1993, Ligon and Norris were classmates at Duke Universityâ€™s business school.Â  Norris approached Ligon and numerous other students and faculty members, explaining his idea for an automated teller machine that would bypass lengthy loan processes and immediately dispense proceeds of a loan.Â  \r\nLigon had many contacts with potential investors in his home town of Columbia, South Carolina.Â  During a telephone conversation in June of 1993, in exchange for Ligonâ€™s assistance in raising capital, Norris allegedly offered Ligon a one percent interest in a startup company to be created to develop the concept.Â  \r\nLigon introduced Norris to numerous influential people.Â  Although none of them ultimately invested in the company, they assisted Norris in securing a lender, provided free office space, and introduced Norris to other potential investors. Â Dick Bannon, a contact provided by Ligon, served as chief financial officer and advised Norris on how to structure the company.Â  \r\nIn November 1993, Norris started the company as U.S. Loan, Inc.Â  Ligon and Bannon became members of the board of directors.Â  In January of 1994, based on Bannonâ€™s advice, U.S. Loan was dissolved and Affinity Financial Group, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware.Â  \r\nIn March or April of 1994, Norris asked both Bannon and Ligon to leave Affinity. Â According to Ligon, Norris assured Ligon his one percent interest in the company was secure.Â  Later that year, during a telephone conversation between Norris and Ligon, Ligon became concerned that Norris would not honor the oral contract.Â  Ligon therefore sent a letter to Duke University offering half of his one percent interest in Affinity in exchange for relief from a tuition debt.Â  By letter dated September 21, 1994, Norris informed Duke that Ligon had no interest in Affinity.Â  Norris sent a copy of the letter to Ligon.Â  \r\nDuring the ensuing two years, restricted shares of stock in the company were issued to various Affinity employees including Norris. Â Affinity offered common shares to the public on April 26, 1996.Â  The parties later stipulated that a one percent interest at that time was worth $5,468,881.Â  Ligon did not receive any stock from Norris or Affinity and consequently filed this action.\r\nThe matter was tried before a jury in July of 1998. Â The jury rendered verdicts in favor of Ligon against Affinity for $48,000 and against Norris for $20,000.Â  The trial court granted Ligon a new trial absolute. Â On appeal, this court affirmed in an unpublished opinion.Â  \r\nDuring a pre-trial motions hearing at the second trial, Ligon argued he was proceeding on an â€˜all or nothingâ€™ theory of recovery, asking for damages of $5,468,881, the value of one percent of the stock at the time of public issuance. Â He accordingly moved to exclude any evidence of stock valuations at any other time.Â  The court granted the motion.Â  During the trial, however, the jury saw and heard both evidence and arguments regarding stock values to which Ligon may have been entitled at times other than the date of the initial public offering.Â  After lengthy discussion at a charge conference, the trial court decided, without objection from either party, to submit a general verdict form rather than special interrogatories for the juryâ€™s consideration.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ligon for $382,148.Â  Thereafter, and once again following extensive discussion and consultation, the trial court submitted special interrogatories to the jury to assist the court in ruling on post-trial motions.Â  The jury answered the interrogatories finding a contract had been breached, but Ligon was not entitled to a one percent interest in the company at the time of the initial public offering.\r\nLigon moved, inter alia, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (jnov), new trial nisi additur, or new trial absolute.Â  The defendants moved for entry of judgment in conformance with the special interrogatories, jnov, or new trial absolute.Â  The trial court set aside the verdict and entered judgment for the defendants.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nLigon raises four issues on appeal, asserting 1) the trial court erred in denying his motion for jnov; 2) the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial nisi additur based on the juryâ€™s responses to the special interrogatories; 3) the verdict and responses to special interrogatories are irreconcilable, thereby entitling Ligon to a new trial absolute; and 4) the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the defendants and should reinstate the monetary verdict.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJNOV\r\nLigon argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for jnov.Â  Ligon asserts the only â€œlegally valid amount of damageâ€ is $5,463,881.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on a motion for jnov, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  The motion should be denied where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  The trial court can only be reversed when there is no evidence to support the ruling.Â  McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006).\r\nLigon claimed entitlement to valuation of one percent of the company as of the date of the public stock offering.Â  Although a preliminary business plan mentioned common stock at the time of the initial public offering, there is evidence of other valuation dates and methods in the record including the prospectus and testimony.Â  Ligonâ€™s own testimony was inconsistent regarding the manner and time of valuation.Â  Ligon admitted the parties did not discuss when the stock would be valued.Â  Ligon acknowledged his ownership share â€œcould go any number of ways, which was not discussedâ€ at the time of the formation of the contract. Â Ligon testified he was entitled to the same amount Peter Wilson received.Â  According to the prospectus, entered into evidence by Ligon, Wilson and other early investors and employees acquired stock as early as October of 1994, more than a year before the initial public offering.Â  Finally, Norris testified, without contemporaneous objection, that Ligonâ€™s alleged one percent interest would have been diluted by subsequent investors.Â  \r\nThus, regardless of the trial courtâ€™s rulings excluding evidence of any valuation time or manner other than as common stock at the time of the initial public offering, the jury heard evidence of other valuation times and methods.Â  Furthermore, despite the courtâ€™s ruling prohibiting the defendants from arguing alternate valuations in closing, Affinity argued, without objection from Ligon, that â€œLigon expected to get stock at the date of the first venture capital . . . in July of 1994â€ and that numerous others in like circumstances received restricted stock rather than the common stock issued at the initial public offering.â€[1]Â  Also without objection, the charge to the jury on the subject of damages was the classic general law of damages applicable to a breach of contract action, and excluded any reference to the stipulated value of one percent of the company at the time of the initial public offering.Â  Finally, the stipulation itself stated the value of one percent of the company on the date of the public offering but did not state that an award of damages was limited to that value.Â  While there was considerable discussion among the attorneys and the trial court about the â€œall or nothingâ€ theory of recovery, none of the discussion was held while the jury was present.Â  Thus, the jury was not privy to Ligonâ€™s â€œall or nothingâ€ demand.\r\nThe jury apparently determined the valuation of Ligonâ€™s interest in the company should have been calculated at a time other than the date of the initial public offering or for an amount other than the stipulated value.Â  As there was evidence in the record to support such a finding, the trial court did not err in denying Ligonâ€™s motion for jnov.Â  \r\nADDITUR\r\nLigon also argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial nisi additur in reliance on the juryâ€™s responses to the special interrogatories.Â  We disagree.\r\nAfter the jury rendered its general verdict of $382,148, the court submitted the following special interrogatories to the jury, and received the indicated responses:\r\n\r\nQuestion 1:Â  In reaching your verdict, do you unanimously find that a contract was formed between the Plaintiff and the Defendants?\r\nÂ X Â Â Â Yes\r\nÂ Â Â Â  Â Â Â No Â \r\nQuestion 2: Â If you answered yes to Question 1, do you unanimously find that the contract was for Plaintiff to receive 1% of Affinity Technology at the time of the initial public offering?\r\nÂ  Â Â Â Â Â Â Yes Â \r\nÂ X Â Â Â No\r\n\r\nLigon first asserts the issuance of special interrogatories to the jury after it rendered a general verdict constituted error.Â  Ligon also argues the interrogatories were confusing because a negative response to either question could be interpreted in more than one way.Â  Ligon asserts the juryâ€™s response to the second question could indicate either the jury was not unanimous in its verdict, or the jury did not find the contract was for one percent at the time of the initial public offering.Â Â  \r\nWe find Ligon failed to preserve the issue of the trial courtâ€™s submission of the interrogatories after the general verdict was returned.[2]Â  Although Ligon initially objected to the submission of interrogatories, the trial court and the partiesâ€™ attorneys discussed the issue and Ligon eventually stated:Â  â€œI withdraw my objection.Â  I think thatâ€™s the appropriate way to go.â€ Â An objection withdrawn at trial constitutes an express waiver of the issue and does not preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  Rosamond Enters., Inc. v. McGranahan, 278 S.C. 512, 513, 299 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983); 75 Am.Jur.2d Trial Â§ 422 (1991).Â  \r\nLigon also argues the interrogatories are flawed because they include the term â€œunanimously,â€ and a negative answer to either question could be interpreted as an answer regarding unanimity or an answer regarding the ultimate question.Â  We find the interrogatories were not so confusing as to necessitate reversal on this issue.\r\nInterrogatories must be considered in conjunction with the jury instructions.Â  Fortune v. Gibson, 304 S.C. 279, 282, 403 S.E.2d 674, 675 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  During general charges to the jury, the trial court instructed that the verdict must be unanimous. Â Again when the special interrogatories were submitted to the jury, the court instructed the jury to answer â€œcollectively and unanimously.â€ Â When considered with the jury instructions, we find no prejudice to Ligon based on the wording of the interrogatories.Â  See State v. Myers, 344 S.C. 532, 536, 544 S.E.2d 851, 853 (Ct. App. 2001) (affirming where â€œclear and cogent jury instructions ameliorated any possible prejudiceâ€ stemming from interrogatories).Â  \r\nFinally, Ligon argues the trial court erred in denying additur based solely on the answers to the interrogatories rather than based on the evidence at trial.Â  Even if the trial court erred in relying on the interrogatories, there is evidence in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny additur.\r\nThe trial court has the power to grant a new trial nisi additur when it finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate.Â  Oâ€™Neal&nbsp;v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993).Â  The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi additur is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  The consideration of a motion for a new trial nisi additur requires the court to consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of the evidence presented.Â  Waring v. Johnson, 341 S.C. 248, 257, 533 S.E.2d 906, 911 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for new trial nisi additur where there is evidence in the record to support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  See Steele v. Dillard, 327 S.C. 340, 345, 486 S.E.2d 278, 281 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding no abuse of discretion where the evidence in the record supports the amount of the jury award even though other evidence in the record indicated the jury could have awarded a larger verdict).\r\nAs discussed in addressing the trial courtâ€™s denial of Ligonâ€™s motion for jnov, we find evidence in the record to support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Ligonâ€™s motion for new trial nisi additur.\r\nNEW TRIAL ABSOLUTE\r\nLigon next argues the trial court should have granted him a new trial absolute based on the allegedly flawed interrogatories.Â  We disagree.Â  The trial court may grant a new trial absolute if the judge believes the verdict is not supported by the evidence.Â  Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267-68 (1990). Â The grant or denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law.Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 403, 477 S.E.2d 715, 722 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  As previously noted, we find evidence in the record to support the juryâ€™s verdict and further find no reversible error in the manner in which the interrogatories were worded.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ligonâ€™s motion for new trial absolute.Â  \r\nENTRY OF JUDGMENT FOR DEFENDANTS\r\nLigon finally argues the trial court erred in granting the defendantsâ€™ motion for entry of judgment in conformance with the special interrogatories.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWhen considering a motion for entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial judge cannot disturb the factual findings of a jury unless the record discloses no evidence supporting those findings.Â  Force v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 322 S.C. 283, 284, 471 S.E.2d 714, 715 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  If more than one reasonable inference exists, the jury verdict must stand.Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court found the answers to the special interrogatories were consistent with each other but inconsistent with the general verdict, finding no competent evidence of damages other than the stipulated value of one percent of the company at the time of the initial public offering.Â  However, we conclude competent evidence existed to support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  We therefore find no inconsistency in the juryâ€™s response to the special interrogatories and the general verdict.Â  \r\nBecause the trial court charged the jury the general law regarding contract damages, Affinity argued without objection regarding alternate manners and times to calculate damages, and evidence of other methods to calculate damages was presented to the jury, including the prospectus and testimony, we find the juryâ€™s verdict, including its responses to the special interrogatories, to be consistent with each other and supported by the record.Â  We therefore reverse the trial courtâ€™s award of judgment to the defendants and reinstate the jury verdict.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Ligonâ€™s motions for jnov, additur, and new trial absolute.Â  We reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of defendantsâ€™ motion for judgment in conformance with the special interrogatories.Â  Accordingly, the juryâ€™s verdict is reinstated.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  Ligon argues error arising from Affinityâ€™s closing argument.Â  However, Ligon failed to timely object to the closing argument.Â  When a party fails to make a timely objection to an improper closing argument, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. 155, 159, 345 S.E.2d 711, 714 (1986).Â  \r\n[2]  As the issue is not preserved, we make no ruling on the propriety of this unusual procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4171","title":"Rutland v.

Rutland, pro se, of West Columbia.\r\nCynthia K. Mason, of Columbia; Daniel Roy Settana, Jr., of Columbia; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Robert Rutland appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Respondents pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1987, Rutland was terminated from his employment as a project engineer for Yates Development Corporation (Corporation).Â  After the Corporation filed for bankruptcy in 1991, a dispute over the Corporationâ€™s patents arose between Rutland and Larry Yates, the owner of the Corporation.Â  In conjunction with this dispute, Yates was indicted in federal court for bankruptcy fraud.Â  Pursuant to an agreement, the charge was dismissed against Yates. Â In turn, Yates, who was represented by Francis Draine, filed a federal action against Rutland, the United States, and several government officials for what he claimed to be a groundless indictment and prosecution.Â  After the case against Rutland was dismissed by the federal district court, Rutland brought suit, case number 97-CP-40-4380, in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas against Yates and Draine for several causes of action, including malicious prosecution.Â  Although the court granted summary judgment in favor of Draine, Rutlandâ€™s counsel, James Corbett, obtained a $350,000 judgment against Yates.Â  Corbett appealed the dismissal of the case against Draine to this court.Â  After we affirmed the grant of summary judgment, Rutlandâ€™s counsel petitioned for certiorari to our supreme court. Â The supreme court denied the petition. \r\nSubsequently, Rutland, proceeding pro se, sued Corbett and his law firm for legal malpractice, breach of contract, and fraud in case number 02-CP-40-1724.Â  On January 30, 2004, Circuit Court Judge Alison Lee issued a form order, and ultimately a formal order, granting summary judgment in favor of Corbett and his law firm on the cause of action for legal malpractice and denying summary judgment for the remaining claims. Â On February 11, 2004, Circuit Court Judge Reginald Lloyd dismissed Rutlandâ€™s claims for breach of contract and fraud pursuant to Rule 12(h)(2) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\nWhile case number 02-CP-40-1724 was pending, Rutland filed another lawsuit against Corbett, case number 02-CP-40-1843, alleging legal malpractice arising out of the circuit court trial in which Corbett obtained a verdict of $350,000 in favor of Rutland against Yates.Â  This lawsuit ended in a grant of summary judgment for Corbett.\r\nOn February 24, 2004, Rutland filed a third lawsuit, case number 04-CP-40-0900, against Corbett and his law firm for breach of contract and fraud based on the above-outlined facts.Â  After a hearing, Circuit Court Judge Casey Manning issued a form order on August 9, 2004, granting the defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss.Â  Judge Manning indicated that he would issue a formal order.Â  The clerk of courtâ€™s office mailed a copy of the form order to the parties on August 10, 2004.Â  \r\nOn September 1, 2004, Respondents filed a motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act.[2]Â  On December 7, 2004, Judge Manning issued his formal order in which he dismissed Rutlandâ€™s lawsuit against Respondents on the grounds of res judicata/collateral estoppel and insufficient service of process.[3] Â A hearing on Respondentsâ€™ motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs was originally scheduled for December 7, 2004, but was continued until April 12, 2005, as a result of Rutland being hospitalized.Â  Â Â \r\nBy order dated September 20, 2005, Judge Manning granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in the amount of $2,585.79.Â  Rutland appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nRutland argues Judge Manning did not have jurisdiction to rule on Respondentsâ€™ motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs because the motion was untimely. Â Specifically, Rutland contends Respondents failed to file their motion within ten days of Judge Manningâ€™s order dismissing Rutlandâ€™s lawsuit on August 9, 2004.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe established case law is that a trial judge loses jurisdiction over a case when the time to file post-trial motions has elapsed.â€ Ex parte Beard, 359 S.C. 351, 358, 597 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œ[B]ecause a trial judge retains jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend a judgment within ten days of its issuance, a motion for sanctions would be timely if filed within ten days of judgment.â€Â  Pitman v. Republic Leasing Co., 351 S.C. 429, 431, 570 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn the instant case, Judge Manning issued a form order dismissing Rutlandâ€™s case against Respondents on August 9, 2004.Â  In issuing this order, Judge Manning specifically indicated that he intended to file a formal order.Â  Thus, Judge Manning retained jurisdiction until the time for post-trial motions elapsed after the issuance of his formal order on December 7, 2004.Â  Accordingly, Respondentsâ€™ motion filed on September 1, 2004, was timely and Judge Manning had jurisdiction to rule on the motion. Â See Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 605, 567 S.E.2d 514, 518 (Ct. App. 2002) (noting that a form order is not a final order if the circuit court specifies that a formal order will be filed); see also Culbertson v. Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 23, 471 S.E.2d 163, 164 (1996) (â€œAny judgment or decree, leaving some further act to be done by the court before the rights of the parties are determined, is interlocutory and not final.â€).\r\nII.\r\nTurning to the merits of the appeal, Rutland argues Judge Manning erred in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion.Â  Rutland contends Respondents failed to meet the burden of proof as required under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act.Â Â  Additionally, Rutland asserts he presented evidence that he brought the causes of action against Respondents with a proper purpose, thus, negating the imposition of sanctions under the Act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe determination of whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded under the Frivolous Proceedings Act is treated as one in equity.â€Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1997).Â  In reviewing the award in issue, this Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œHowever, following the determination of facts, an appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the decision to award sanctions and the specific sanctions awarded.â€Â  Ex parte Beard, 359 S.C. at 357, 597 S.E.2d at 838.\r\nThe South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act provides:\r\n\r\nAny person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding is subject to being assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs of the other party if:\r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are based; and\r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an assessment of the fees and costs.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (2005). \r\nIn order for a litigant to receive attorneyâ€™s fees and costs under the Act, he has the burden of proving:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (1)\r\n       the other party has procured, initiated, continued, or defended the civil proceedings against him;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)\r\n       the proceedings were terminated in his favor;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (3)&nbsp;\r\n       the primary purpose for which the proceedings were procured, initiated, continued, or defended was not that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the civil proceedings;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (4)&nbsp;\r\n       the aggrieved person has incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs; and\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       the amount of the fees and costs set forth in item (4).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-40 (2005).Â  â€œSection 15-36-20 creates a presumption that a person taking part in the initiation or continuation of proceedings acted with a proper purpose â€˜if he reasonably believes in the existence of facts upon which his claim is basedâ€™ and . . . reasonably believes under the facts that his claim may be valid under existing or developing law.â€ Hanahan, 326 S.C. at 156, 485 S.E.2d at 912 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-20(1)(Supp. 1995)).\r\nHere, Judge Manning found Respondents established that Rutland filed this lawsuit â€œprimarily for a purpose other than securing discovery or adjudication of a claim and that the lawsuit was terminated in their favor.â€Â  Additionally, Judge Manning stated â€œ[Rutland] was unable to establish that he instituted this action for a proper purpose as defined by South Carolina Code Annotated Â§ 15-36-20.â€ \r\nTaking our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we find Judge Manning properly imposed sanctions and awarded Respondents attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  In terms of Respondentsâ€™ burden of proof, they established the requisite elements of section 15-36-40.Â  Respondents offered evidence:Â  (1) that Rutland initiated case number 04-CP-40-0900 against them; (2) the lawsuit was dismissed; (3) they incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in defending against the action; and (4) of the amount of the fees and costs.Â  Furthermore, Respondents were able to show that the primary purpose for which the proceedings were initiated â€œwas not that of securing the proper . . . adjudication of the civil proceedings.â€Â  Â A review of the record reveals that the lawsuit at issue alleged causes of action for the same complaint as the previous lawsuits, i.e., Rutlandâ€™s dissatisfaction with Corbett and his law firm.Â  Significantly, Rutland filed one of the lawsuits despite the fact that Corbett procured a judgment in his favor of $350,000.Â  Rutland also withdrew his appeal of Judge Manningâ€™s dismissal of the instant lawsuit.Â  Furthermore, the complaints were ultimately resolved in favor of Respondents either through a grant of summary judgment or, as in the instant lawsuit, a motion to dismiss. Â In light of this unsuccessful procedural history, it is inconceivable that Rutland reasonably believed that his claims against Respondents were valid.Â  Â Â \r\nIII.\r\nIn the alternative, Rutland contends Judge Manning erred in awarding Respondents attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in the amount of $2,585.79.Â  He asserts Judge Manning failed to limit the amount awarded to the affidavit submitted by Respondents in support of their motion. We disagree. \r\nIn support of their motion for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, Respondents submitted an affidavit on September 1, 2004, in which they requested an award of $1,397.39.Â  At the hearing on the motion, which was held on April 12, 2005, Respondents requested a total of $2,585.79 for additional fees and costs incurred for the continued defense of Rutlandâ€™s action against them.Â  \r\nIt is indisputable Respondents incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in defending against case number 04-CP-40-0900 at the trial level and in preparing for the appeal of Judge Manningâ€™s dismissal of the case. Â Respondents offered evidence of the amount requested through Corbettâ€™s affidavit. Â Respondentsâ€™ counsel also indicated that Respondents had incurred additional fees since the affidavit was submitted for a total of $2,585.79.Â  Thus, we find Judge Manning did not abuse his discretion in awarding the entire amount requested by Respondents.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â The provisions of this Act are outlined in sections 15-36-10 through 15-36-50 of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 to -50 (2005).Â  We note that section 15-36-10 was completely revised by Act No. 27, 2005 S.C. Acts 114, Â§ 5, which became effective on July 1, 2005, and sections 15-36-20 through -50 were repealed by Act No. 27, 2005 S.C. Acts 121, Â§ 12, which became effective on March 21, 2005.Â  Because Respondents filed their motion on September 1, 2004, we believe the original Act still governed Judge Manningâ€™s decision.Â  Moreover, Rutland does not challenge the applicability of the former Act. \r\n[3] Rutland appealed this order on January 5, 2005, but voluntarily withdrew the appeal shortly after filing it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4172","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor David M. Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n BEATTY, J.:Â  Clinton Roberson was tried in absentia and without counsel for the charge of failing to register as a sex offender.Â  After the jury convicted Roberson, the circuit court judge sentenced Roberson to ninety days imprisonment.Â  Roberson appeals the judgeâ€™s denial of his motion for a new trial.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 6, 1999, Roberson was arrested for failing to register as a sex offender pursuant to sections 23-3-460 and 23-3-470 of the South Carolina Code.[2]Â  According to the affidavit attached to the arrest warrant, Roberson had been previously convicted of committing a lewd act on a minor and failed to re-register as a sex offender after he moved from Dorchester County to Charleston County.Â  Roberson was released on bond the day after his arrest.Â  The terms of the bond required Roberson to appear for roll call at the term of general sessions court in Dorchester County beginning on November 29, 1999.Â  By signing the bond, Roberson acknowledged that he would be tried in his absence if he failed to appear in court. Â The Dorchester County Solicitorâ€™s office mailed to Robersonâ€™s last known address two notices of appearance for the terms of court scheduled for November 29, 1999, and January 10, 2000.\r\nOn February 16, 2000, Roberson was tried in his absence and without counsel before a Dorchester County jury.Â  After the jury convicted Roberson of failing to register as a sex offender, the circuit court judge issued a sealed sentence of ninety days imprisonment.Â  \r\nOn April 24, 2003, Roberson, who was represented by counsel, appeared before the circuit court to be sentenced.Â  During this hearing, Roberson inquired whether he was represented by counsel at trial.Â  Based on this inquiry, Robersonâ€™s counsel moved for a new trial on the grounds Roberson did not knowingly and voluntarily fail to appear for his trial and he was denied his right to be represented by counsel at the trial.Â  Because it was not clear whether Roberson had been represented at trial, the judge continued the motion until a trial transcript could be located.Â  \r\nDuring the hearing on the motion, Robersonâ€™s counsel contended Roberson was not aware of the trial date[3] and he was not represented by counsel at trial.Â  Based on these grounds, counsel requested that the circuit court vacate Robersonâ€™s conviction and grant him a new trial.Â  In response, the solicitor asserted Roberson waived his right to counsel by failing to appear.Â  Additionally, the solicitor claimed Roberson was apprised of his right to counsel at the bond hearing.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court judge denied Robersonâ€™s motion.Â  The judge found that Roberson had waived his right to counsel because the terms of his bond indicated that he would be tried in absence if he failed to appear and he had been informed of his right to counsel at the bond hearing.Â  Roberson appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRoberson argues the circuit court judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial because he was denied the right to counsel at trial.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right to counsel.Â  This right may be waived.â€ State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 243, 584 S.E.2d 432, 437 (Ct. App. 2003)(citations omitted).Â  This court has explained that â€œ[a] defendant may surrender his right to counsel through (1) waiver by affirmative, verbal request; (2) waiver by conduct; and (3) forfeiture.â€Â  State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 262, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nInitially, we note neither the first nor the third above-outlined condition has been met to constitute a waiver of Robersonâ€™s right to counsel.Â  In terms of the first condition, there is no evidence in the record establishing that a trial judge advised Roberson of his right to counsel and warned him of the dangers of self-representation.Â  See Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 423-24, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990) (discussing Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), and noting that Faretta allows a defendant to waive his right to counsel if the following conditions are satisfied:Â  (1) the accused is advised of his right to counsel and (2) adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation).Â  Furthermore, we reject the Stateâ€™s contention that Roberson implicitly waived his right to counsel by signing his bond form.Â  Although the form stated that Roberson would be tried in his absence if he failed to appear for his trial, we do not believe that Robersonâ€™s acknowledgment of this statement can be construed as an affirmative waiver of his right to counsel.Â  \r\nRegarding the third condition, this court has stated that â€œ[s]ituations where a defendantâ€™s own conduct forfeits his right to counsel are unusual, typically involving a manipulative or disruptive defendant.â€Â  Thompson, 355 S.C. at 267, 584 S.E.2d at 137. Â The record is devoid of any egregious misconduct on the part of Roberson to warrant the drastic sanction of forfeiture of the right to counsel.Â  Significantly, the only apparent misconduct is Robersonâ€™s failure to appear at his trial.\r\nAccordingly, we confine our analysis, as do the parties, to the question of whether Roberson waived his right by his conduct, i.e., by failing to appear for trial.Â  In answering this question, we are guided by this courtâ€™s decision in State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 584 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In Thompson, the defendant was tried in absentia and without counsel for the offenses of discharging a firearm into a dwelling and malicious injury to personal property over $1,000 but less than $5,000.Â  After the jury convicted Thompson, the judge issued a sealed sentence.Â  At sentencing, Thompsonâ€™s counsel moved for a new trial because he was denied the right to counsel.Â  Counsel claimed that Thompson had appeared at four or five roll calls after his arrest.Â  Additionally, counsel alleged that Thompson, despite his request, had been turned down for a public defender because he did not meet the financial requirements to qualify.Â  In terms of Thompsonâ€™s failure to appear at trial, his counsel informed the court that Thompson was not given adequate notice of the trial date.Â  Id. at 260, 584 S.E.2d at 133.Â  The court denied Thompsonâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Id. at 260, 584 S.E.2d at 134.Â  On appeal, this court reversed the decision of the circuit court.Â  We held that Thompsonâ€™s failure to appear at trial did not rise to the level of waiver.Â  Id. at 266, 584 S.E.2d at 136.Â  Our decision was based on the following factors:Â  (1) Thompson had not been advised of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation under Faretta; (2) there was no inference in the record that Thompson understood the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation; and (3) Thompson did not have a prior record which would have familiarized him with the criminal court system.Â  Id. at 267, 584 S.E.2d at 137.\r\nApplying Thompson to the facts of the instant case, we find Robersonâ€™s failure to appear at trial did not constitute an affirmative waiver of his right to counsel.Â  Although Roberson, unlike Thompson, had a prior criminal record, we find this factor alone does not negate the significant fact that Roberson was never advised of proceeding without representation on the current charge.Â  Thus, we cannot infer that Thompsonâ€™s conduct constituted a waiver of his right.\r\nWe are cognizant of the existence of cases where our supreme court has inferred that a defendant waived his right to counsel.Â  In those cases, however, the defendant was represented by counsel prior to trial or had given assurances that he would retain counsel at the time of trial.Â  See State v. Cain, 277 S.C. 210, 210-11, 284 S.E.2d 779, 779 (1981) (inferring waiver of counsel and affirming defendantâ€™s conviction and sentence where defendant, who was tried in absentia and without counsel for third-offense driving under the influence, failed to fulfill the conditions of his appearance bond and neglected to keep in contact with his attorney despite knowing the trial was imminent); see also State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, 126-28, 245 S.E.2d 606, 607-08 (1978) (inferring defendant waived his right to counsel where:Â  (1) trial court allowed defendant, a non-indigent, reasonable time to retain counsel; (2) trial court urged defendant on several occasions to retain counsel and provided defendant access to a telephone and additional time to make the arrangements; (3) defendant on the day of trial did not name his attorney; and (4) defendant failed to make a sufficient showing of reasons for his failure to have counsel present at trial); State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 244, 584 S.E.2d 432, 437-38 (Ct. App. 2003) (inferring defendant waived his right to counsel where defendant failed to retain counsel for trial despite his repeated assurances to the court that he intended to hire private counsel and did not require the appointment of a public defender). \r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude Roberson was deprived of his fundamental right to the assistance of counsel.Â  Because this denial is a per se reversible error, we reverse the circuit court judgeâ€™s decision and remand for a new trial.Â  See Thompson, 355 S.C. at 261, 584 S.E.2d at 134 (â€œThe erroneous deprivation of a defendantâ€™s fundamental right to the assistance of counsel is per se reversible error.â€). \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] These sections outline the requirements for complying with the South Carolina Sex Offender Registry and the penalties for failing to comply.Â  S.C.

Hilton Head, II, Inc. and Charter Oak Group, Ltd., (collectively Charter) appeal (1) the trial courtâ€™s denial of their motion for a directed verdict; (2) the trial courtâ€™s decision to strike the defense of assumption of the risk; and (3) the trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow them to argue third party liability in their closing argument. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMargaret Oâ€™Leary-Payne was a manager at Lillian Vernon, a retail store located in the Hilton Head Factory Stores II (Shopping Center).[1]Â  Her duties included breaking down cardboard boxes and transporting them outside to the trash compactor.Â  Lillian Vernon required its employees to remove all trash before the close of the day because it received new shipments early in the morning.Â  \r\nAround dusk on the evening of April 2, 1998, Oâ€™Leary-Payne stacked several broken down cardboard boxes up to her waist on a cart. Â She then proceeded out the back door onto the sidewalk, which she had traversed numerous times before, to take the boxes to the trash compactor and dumpster provided by Shopping Center.Â  Although the sidewalk was lit, it was still quite dim.Â  As Oâ€™Leary-Payne was walking down the sidewalk, something caught her foot and she fell backwards.Â  Once she was on the ground, Oâ€™Leary-Payne noticed, for the first time, a metal pipe[2] protruding approximately five-and-a-half inches from the sidewalk.Â  As a result of the fall, her foot was bleeding and her shoe was torn.Â  She returned to the store, placed a bandage on the cut, and asked her assistant manager to return with her outside to look at the rod.Â  \r\nThe next morning, Oâ€™Leary-Payne reported her fall to the managerâ€™s office at the Shopping Center.Â  The accident report stated that Oâ€™Leary-Payne â€œtripped over a pipe sticking out [of the] sidewalk.â€Â  She and the manager then went to the scene of the accident.Â  They observed that no warnings were in place to call attention to the rod.Â  \r\nOn May 22, 1998, Oâ€™Leary-Payne visited a doctor for problems arising from her fall.Â  In addition to the cut on her foot, she complained of neck and lower back pain and headaches.Â  Immediately after the fall, she had experienced pain in her lower spine and buttocks.Â  After the accident, some of her injuries improved but others worsened.Â  Specifically, she continued to have problems with a vein, and eventually had to strap her right arm to her body because she lost all feeling in the arm.Â  She also was taking several pain medications and using a pain pump.Â  \r\nOn January 22, 2001, Oâ€™Leary-Payne instituted an action for negligence against Charter.Â  At trial, Oâ€™Leary-Payne sought to exclude any evidence of the liability of third parties.[3]Â  The trial court agreed, ruling Charter could not introduce any evidence of third party liability unless Oâ€™Leary-Payne opened the door.Â  During Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s presentation of a video deposition, a discussion arose between the trial court and the attorneys regarding third party liability.Â  Oâ€™Leary-Payne was â€œwilling to let [the jury] know there were other attorneys involved and who they represented.â€Â  The trial court responded, â€œSo youâ€™re going to let [Charterâ€™s attorney] open the door as far as anything of blaming other people for this situation?â€ Â Oâ€™Leary-Payne responded, â€œIf he wants to blame the other people in the case . . . he can blame them.â€ Â The trial court then asked Charter if it wanted the trial court â€œto let the jury know anything about who these people are, that this is another case going on somewhere else or another forum at another time?â€Â  Charter responded that it did not want the trial court to inform the jury about the other parties; it wished to let the video deposition play, and it would say â€œwho [the other attorneys] represent.â€Â  Charter maintained â€œit certainly opens my door to talk about the blame of these other people.â€Â  \r\nTrial proceeded with no further mention of the third parties until the trial court began ruling on motions prior to closing arguments.Â  Oâ€™Leary-Payne made a motion to strike Charterâ€™s defense of superseding and intervening negligence of other parties.Â  The trial court stated the record contained no evidence of third party liability, but Charter argued that because Oâ€™Leary-Payne stipulated that Charter could blame other parties, Charter did not need to present any evidence of the third partiesâ€™ liability.Â  The trial court responded that â€œthe stipulation was that you could blame, but you didnâ€™t blame.â€Â  The trial court ruled Charter could only argue evidence in the record, and because no evidence had been presented as to who constructed the sidewalk, Charter could not mention third party liability in its closing argument.Â  \r\nAt the close of Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s case, Charter moved for a directed verdict.Â  Charter argued Oâ€™Leary-Payne failed to satisfy her burden of proof because she presented no evidence that a hazardous, dangerous, or defective condition existed or that Charter had notice of a defective condition.Â  Upon questioning from the trial court regarding why Oâ€™Leary-Payne did not present expert testimony, she answered she was not required to present expert testimony to show a hazard existed because a lay person could determine the rod was hazardous from looking at the photograph.Â  Charter further argued that Oâ€™Leary-Payne was improperly attempting to use the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to meet her burden.Â  The trial court denied the directed verdict motion.Â  At the close of its case, Charter renewed its motion, which the trial court again denied.Â  \r\nOâ€™Leary-Payne also made a motion to strike Charterâ€™s assumption of the risk defense. Â Â Charter argued that she assumed the risk by going out on the sidewalk when she knew the lighting was poor and with the boxes stacked high enough to impair her line of sight.Â  Charter argued that she should have waited until the following morning to take the boxes to the dumpster. Â The trial court granted the motion to strike the defense. \r\nThe jury awarded Oâ€™Leary-Payne actual damages of $5,981,690, but found Oâ€™Leary-Payne was forty percent negligent and thereby reduced the verdict to $3,589,014.[4] Â Charter moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and a new trial, both of which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nCharter argues the trial court erred by failing to grant its motion for a directed verdict on several grounds.Â  Charter maintains (1) Oâ€™Leary-Payne relied on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and did not present any evidence that Charter created the dangerous condition, and (2) the rod was an open and obvious defect.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  This court must follow the same standard.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).Â  â€œIf more than one reasonable inference can be drawn or if the inferences to be drawn from the evidence are in doubt, the case should be submitted to the jury.â€ Â Chaney v. Burgess,\r\n246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1965).Â  This court will only reverse the trial court when no evidence supports its ruling. Â Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).\r\nAccording to South Carolina law, â€œ[o]ne who operates a shopping center where stores are leased to merchants and the owner retains possession and control of the parking area and sidewalks, is not an insurer of the\r\nsafety of those who use the parking lot and sidewalks as customers of the merchants leasing the stores . . . .â€ Â Bruno v. Pendleton Realty Co., 240 S.C. 46, 50-51, 124 S.E.2d 580, 582 (1962).Â  However, â€œthe owner of the premises owes the customers the duty of exercising ordinary care to keep the passageways, sidewalks and such other parts of the premises as are ordinarily used by the customers in transacting business in a reasonably safe condition.â€ Â Id. at 51, 124 S.E.2d at 582.\r\n A.Â  Res Ipsa Loquitur\r\nCharter argues the trial court erred in failing to grant its directed verdict motion because Oâ€™Leary-Payne relied on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.Â  We disagree.\r\nRes ipsa loquitur means â€œthe thing speaks for itself.â€Â  W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts Â§39, at 243 (5th ed. 1984).Â  According to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur:\r\n\r\nThere must be reasonable evidence of negligence; but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from lack of care.\r\n\r\nId. at 244.\r\nCharter mischaracterizes Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s argument as being â€œthe rod speaks for itself.â€Â  Oâ€™Leary-Payne did not attempt to prove Charterâ€™s negligence by asserting that simply because she was injured at Charterâ€™s Shopping Center, Charter was therefore negligent.Â  Instead, she attempted to prove negligence by introducing details about the rod, such as its height and location, from pictures and testimony.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in failing to grant Charter a directed verdict on the grounds that Oâ€™Leary-Payne relied on res ipsa loquitur to prove negligence.\r\nB.Â  Creation of a Defective Condition\r\nCharter next argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict because Oâ€™Leary-Payne presented no evidence that Charter created a dangerous or defective condition.Â  We disagree. \r\nTo recover damages for injuries caused by a dangerous or defective condition on a storekeeperâ€™s premises, the plaintiff must show either (1) that the injury was caused by a specific act of the defendant which created the dangerous condition; or (2) that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and failed to remedy it.Â \r\nWintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 35, 542 S.E.2d 728, 729 (2001).\r\nFirst, Charter maintains Oâ€™Leary-Payne presented no evidence the rod constituted a dangerous or defective condition because she did not have an expert testify the rod was a hazard nor did she demonstrate the rod was improperly placed or installed.Â  We find this argument unavailing.\r\nâ€œ[E]xpert testimony is not necessary to prove negligence or causation so long as lay persons possess the knowledge and skill to determine the matter at issue.â€Â  F. Patrick Hubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix, The Law of South Carolina Torts 167 (2d ed. 1997).Â  Expert testimony is not required to prove proximate cause if the common knowledge or experience of a layperson is extensive enough. Â Bramlette v. Charter-Med.-Columbia,\r\n302 S.C. 68, 72-73, 393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1990).\r\nHere, Oâ€™Leary-Payne was not required to provide expert testimony that the rod created a dangerous or defective condition.Â  A lay person could determine the rod was a hazard from the pictures of it and testimony about its height and position.Â  Accordingly, we find Charter was not entitled to a directed verdict on the grounds Oâ€™Leary-Payne did not use an expert to establish the rod was a hazard.\r\nNext, Charter claims Oâ€™Leary-Payne did not present evidence that Charter knew a dangerous or defective condition existed and failed to remedy it.[5]Â  We disagree.\r\nConstructive notice is a legal inference which substitutes for actual notice. It is notice imputed to a person whose knowledge of facts is sufficient to put him on inquiry; if these facts were pursued with due diligence, they would lead to other undisclosed facts.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 64, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 (1998).Â  During trial, Charter admitted Oâ€™Leary-Payne had established some evidence of constructive notice of the rod.Â  Further, Charter had adopted a procedure that required its employees to conduct regular inspections of all sidewalks to ensure they were in a safe condition.Â  Therefore, because Charter should have observed the rod during an inspection, it had constructive notice of the rod, and the trial court properly denied its motion for a directed verdict on this ground.\r\nC.Â  Open and Obvious Defect\r\nCharter also claims the trial court erred in not granting its directed verdict motion because the rod was an open and obvious defect, and Oâ€™Leary-Payne failed to present any evidence suggesting Charter could have anticipated any harm would arise from it.Â  This argument is not preserved for appellate review because Charter did not raise it to the trial court at the time it requested a directed verdict.Â \r\nSee, e.g., Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that an issue not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge is not\r\npreserved for appellate review); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).\r\nII.Â  Assumption of Risk\r\nCharter claims the trial court erred in striking its assumption of the risk defense. Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œAssumption of the risk is the deliberate and voluntary choice to assume a known risk.â€ Â Baxley v. Rosenblum, 303 S.C. 340, 347, 400 S.E.2d 502, 507 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The doctrine of assumption of the risk embodies the principle that plaintiffs may not recover for injuries received when they voluntarily expose themselves to a known and appreciated danger. Â Lowrimore v. Fast Fare Stores, Inc.,\r\n299 S.C. 418, 424, 385 S.E.2d 218, 221 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nThe supreme court abolished assumption of the risk as a bar to absolute recovery in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 87-88, 508 S.E.2d 565, 574 (1998).Â  The court, however, limited its ruling to apply to causes of action arising or accruing after November 9, 1998.Â  Id.Â  Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s cause of action accrued against Charter on April 2, 1998.Â  Therefore, on appeal, Charter correctly argues that assumption of the risk could act as a complete bar to Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s cause of action because it arose before the effective date of Davenport.\r\nAt trial, however, Charter never mentioned the effective date of the Davenport decision nor argued assumption of risk was a complete bar to the action.Â  In fact, in response to the trial courtâ€™s question as to whether assumption of the risk has been subsumed within comparative negligence, Charter stated:Â  â€œIt is, but still, the law of assumption of risk, even though itâ€™s incorporated within comparative, weâ€™re still entitled to a charge of that defense, because itâ€™s still a viable defense, itâ€™s just not an outright defense.â€\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Later in the colloquy the trial court provided Charter a second, and final, opportunity to address the assumption of the risk issue, and again Charter failed to argue any issues relating to the effective date of Davenport or that assumption of the risk would be a complete bar to Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s action.\r\nAccordingly, the argument that assumption of risk is a complete bar to Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s action is not preserved for our review because it was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court.Â \r\nSee Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546 (holding that an issue not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nIII.Â  Closing Arguments\r\nFinally, Charter argues the trial court erred by prohibiting it from raising third party liability in its closing argument after Oâ€™Leary-Payne stipulated it could blame third parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nClosing arguments must be confined to evidence in the record and reasonable inferences therefrom.Â \r\nState v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 107, 481 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1997).Â  A trial court is allowed broad\r\ndiscretion in dealing with the range and propriety of closing argument to the jury.Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 195-96, 562 S.E.2d 320, 325&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002). Â Ordinarily, the trial courtâ€™s rulings on such matters will not be disturbed.Â  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766&nbsp;(1997); see also \r\nState v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996) (â€œThe trial courtâ€™s discretion will not be overturned absent a showing of an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law that prejudices the defendant.â€).Â  An appellate court must review the argument in the context of the entire record.Â  Patterson, 324 S.C. at 17, 482 S.E.2d at 766.&nbsp;\r\nNeither Charter nor Oâ€™Leary-Payne presented any evidence of third party liability.Â  Charter argues Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s statement that it could blame third parties rose to the level of a stipulation thereby entitling it to argue third party liability to the jury.Â  While this is admittedly a close issue, we defer to the trial courtâ€™s judgment regarding the scope of the alleged stipulation.Â  The alleged stipulation occurred early in Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s case, before Oâ€™Leary-Payne even testified.Â  Therefore, Charter had ample opportunity to present evidence of third party liability, but it did not take advantage of that opportunity.Â  We also note that Charter declined the trial courtâ€™s offer to advise the jury as to the identity of the third parties and the existence of the other lawsuit.Â  Absent testimony on this issue or the trial courtâ€™s communication of the stipulation to the jury, the matter of third party liability was not in evidence.Â  Therefore, the trial court correctly refused to allow Charter to blame third parties during closing argument.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the trial court is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Lillian Vernon leased its store from the owner of the Shopping Center, R.R. Hilton Head, II.Â  The lease stated that R.R. Hilton Head, II was responsible for the management and maintenance of the common areas of the Shopping Center, including the sidewalks.Â  Charter Oak Group was the management company for the Shopping Center. Â Charter Oak Group and R.R. Hilton Head, II performed inspections to ensure that the sidewalks were clear of debris and to detect any hazards.Â  For simplicityâ€™s sake, both the owner and management company will be referred to as Charter.Â  \r\n[2] Eventually, she discovered the pipe was a grounding rod.Â  The rod was located approximately seventeen inches from the wall. Â \r\n[3] Charter initiated an action against the third parties after Oâ€™Leary-Payne brought the action under appeal.Â  In its action, Charter alleged these parties were responsible for Oâ€™Leary-Payneâ€™s injuries.Â  The third parties included the general contractor, the electrical subcontractor, and a subcontractor of the electrical subcontractor who actually installed the electrical systems and the grounding rod. Â Upon motion of the third parties, Charterâ€™s action was severed from the current action.Â  \r\n[4] No issue was raised on appeal concerning the amount of the verdict.\r\n[5] Whether Charter had actual notice of the grounding rod is not an issue in this appeal as both Charter and Oâ€™Leary-Payne maintained they never noticed the rod at any point prior to the accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
