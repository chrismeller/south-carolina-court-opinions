Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThe origins of this case began more than ten years ago, in February of 1995, when Father met Priscilla Jackson (Mother) in Long Island, New York. At that time, Mother had a four-year-old daughter named Jazmyn.Â  In June 1995, Father was arrested for first-degree assault and robbery.Â  After pleading guilty, he was imprisoned, and has been incarcerated in a New York State prison ever since.Â  He is not eligible for parole until 2007.[1]  \r\nThree months after Fatherâ€™s arrest in 1995, Mother gave birth to Child.Â  Shortly thereafter, Father affirmatively sought to establish paternity of Child, and in May 1996, a New York family court determined Father was Childâ€™s biological father.Â  A month after this determination, Father tried to send Child his limited inmate earnings.Â  He also attempted to arrange a life insurance policy that benefited Child. Â His attempts were in vain, however, because in November 1996, Mother, Jazmyn, and Child disappeared.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nFrom that moment onward, Father engaged in an exhaustive letter-writing campaign to learn the whereabouts of Child.Â  Father wrote hundreds of letters to numerous agencies, associations, centers, organizations, and government officials.Â  Fatherâ€™s effort was so intense, the Departmentâ€™s counsel stipulated at trial that Father â€œhas done more than anybody Iâ€™ve ever seen to try to find his son and to maintain contact with the agencies that had his son.â€Â  The family court took judicial notice of the fact that Father â€œdid everything, most probably more than anyone would ever expect anyone to ever do in the history of this courtâ€ to locate his son.Â Â  \r\nWhile trying to locate his son, Father expressed concern about losing his parental rights.Â  In May 1997, for example, he wrote a New York family court to ask for assistance of counsel to protect his legal rights in the event his legal connection with Child was in jeopardy because of his inability to locate Child. Â Father wrote that same court almost a year later to notify it that despite his best efforts he could not locate Child.Â  He told the family court he had contacted multiple investigators, non-profit corporations, bar associations, as well as the Ohio Departments of Social Security and Vital Statistics, which he contacted because Mother was from Ohio.Â Â Â  \r\nMeanwhile, in South Carolina, Mother and Childâ€™s life together was unraveling.Â  In August 1997, the Department took Child into emergency protective custody based on allegations Motherâ€™s boyfriend sexually abused Jazmyn.Â  In September 1997, the family court found this abuse constituted a threat of harm to Child.Â  The family court issued a restraining order against Motherâ€™s boyfriend and approved a treatment plan requiring Mother to attend individual counseling, parent effectiveness training classes, and a substance abuse treatment program.Â  It is unclear from the record what efforts, if any, the Department made to notify or contact Father.Â  \r\nIn January 1998, the family court ordered Mother to establish and maintain stable housing and an appropriate income to support her children.Â  Again, the Departmentâ€™s efforts to notify or contact Father were either non-existent or are unknown.Â  In February 1999, Mother disappeared,[3] and during her absence, the family court established a permanent plan of TPR and adoption.Â  This action occurred in July 1999, and once again, Father was never notified, though he was still doing everything he could to locate Child.\r\nIn February 2000, Father learned from the National Missing Childrenâ€™s Locate Center in Portland, Oregon that Mother resided in South Carolina.Â  He immediately wrote Mother, but his letter was returned with an indication that she had moved.Â  Father then began writing South Carolina agencies, courts, and legal services.Â  Finally, on August 22, 2000, culminating nearly four years of searching, the South Carolina Department of Social Services wrote Father, informing him Child was in foster care in the custody of the Department.Â  The Department also advised him it could not proceed with his case until after his release from prison.Â Â Â  \r\nWithin days, on August 28, 2000, Father began to write the Department.Â  Although he did not receive a response from his initial letters, he soon discovered Sue Christopher was Childâ€™s caseworker, and he began writing to her on October 9, 2000.[4]Â  In this letter, Father apprised the Department of his extensive search to find Child and his wish to establish â€œa positive line of communicationâ€ with the Department.Â  He also notified the Department he did not want his parental rights terminated, he needed legal representation, and he had a five-year-old file of correspondence the Department could review.Â  Despite the fact that Father had been searching for information about Child for four years, the Department did not respond. \r\nOn October 23, 2000, Father again wrote the Department.Â  Father expressed his wish to connect with Child and asked the Department about his options. Â Â The Department sent him a required form letter inviting him to a Foster Care Review Board (the Board) meeting, but did not otherwise respond.Â  On October 30, 2000, Father informed the Department he had received the Board invitation but could not attend because he was incarcerated in New York.Â  He also expressed his frustration that he had not received any information from the Department other than the invitation, and that he felt as though the Department was discouraging him from making contact with Child.Â  The Department did not respond. \r\nOn November 1, 2000, Father again wrote the Department.Â  This time, he asked for Childâ€™s address so he could write Child.Â  He also reiterated he did not want his parental rights terminated.Â  On the same day, Father wrote the Departmentâ€™s legal counsel with the same request.Â  Neither the Department nor the Departmentâ€™s legal counsel responded.Â  On November 29, 2000, Father again wrote the Department.Â  He alerted the Department it had not responded to any of his letters, and he wanted to know his options as well as the results of the Board meeting.Â  The Department did not respond.Â  On January 4, 2001, Father again wrote the Department. Â He expressed his utter distress that the Department had not responded to any of his letters. \r\nFinally, on January 9, 2001, the Department responded to Father.Â  Department caseworker Christopher informed Father of the July 1999 permanence planning order directing TPR and adoption, and assured him the Department would ask the court to appoint him a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) and legal counsel to protect his rights.Â  On January 10, 2001, Department director Odessa Williams informed Father the Department had not yet commenced a TPR action against him and requested that Father furnish the Department with a list of â€œadoptive resourcesâ€ for Child.Â  This January 2001 communication is the first time the Department responded to Fatherâ€™s letters, which began in October 2000, and the first time it contacted him since it took Child into emergency protective custody in August 1997. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn February 5, 2001, Father asked the Department multiple questions, including whether he could contact Child.Â  He received no reply, so Father wrote three additional letters on March 8, March 19, and April 16.Â  In these letters, he asked the Department to answer his inquiries and also requested a photograph of his son.Â  The Department did not reply to any of these letters. \r\nOn August 6, 2001, Father wrote Department caseworker Christopher the following:\r\n\r\nI believe [the Department] is supposed to unify families with problems, help them.Â  My son has been in foster care since [August 1997].Â  [To] this date I think that [is] over four years. . .Â  What can be done so I donâ€™t have to lose [or] give up my parental rights and forever lose my only child[?]Â  Can you, being the head of my sonâ€™s case, the only one who can provide answers, can you give me his social security number [so] at least if I die I can give [or] leave him something [?]\r\n\r\nChristopher did not respond to this letter.Â  On August 8, 2001, the Department filed a TPR action against Father.Â  This action was taken twenty-five months after the family courtâ€™s July 1999 order establishing a permanent plan of TPR and adoption and approximately twelve months after Father learned Childâ€™s whereabouts. \r\nAfter multiple continuances, this case was tried on July 17, 2003; December 11, 2003; and June 16 and 17, 2004.Â  On August 27, 2004, the family court terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights to Child.Â  The court found Father willfully failed to visit and support Child because it took Father â€œover a year and a half to provide the identity of the persons who could assume some of his parental duties.â€Â  The court referred to the fact that Father did not provide the names of adoptive resources that Department director Williams requested in January 2001 until July 2002.Â  The court also found Child had been in foster care for fifteen out of the last twenty-two months.Â  Finally, the family court found TPR would be in the best interest of Child, noting Childâ€™s GAL recommended it.Â  Father appealed this order.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather argues the family court erred in terminating his parental rights because (1) Father did not willfully fail to visit or support Child; (2) under the circumstances, Childâ€™s presence in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months alone is not sufficient to support TPR; (3) TPR is not in the best interest of Child; and (4) TPR violated Fatherâ€™s right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  We agree that Father did not willfully fail to visit or support child, and find that termination of Fatherâ€™s rights is not in Childâ€™s best interest.\r\nUnder the United States Constitution, natural parents are entitled to fundamentally fair procedures when the State seeks to sever the relationship they have with their child.Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1.; Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753-54 (1982).Â  In Santosky, the United States Supreme Court announced: \r\n\r\nThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.Â  Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life . . . .Â  When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.Â  \r\n\r\n455 U.S. at 753.Â  The Santosky Court also noted that at the fact-finding stage, â€œthe State cannot presume that a child and his parents are adversariesâ€ because â€œthe child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationshipâ€ until the State proves parental unfitness.Â  Id. at 761.Â Â Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, the procedures for TPR are governed by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1560 to -1582 (Supp. 2005).Â Â  The purpose of the TPR statute is:\r\n\r\n[T]o establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2005).Â  The TPR statute â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2005); Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 108, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).Â  The family court may order TPR if it makes the twofold finding that plaintiff has proved by clear and convincing evidence the existence of at least one statutory ground enumerated in section 20-7-1572 and TPR would be in the best interest of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Failure to Visit or Support Child\r\nFather argues the family court erred in finding he willfully failed to visit or support Child.Â  We agree. \r\nThe family court can terminate parental rights when TPR is in the best interest of the child and the â€œchild has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,â€ and during that time the parent has either â€œwilfully failed to visit the childâ€ or â€œwilfully failed to support the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) and (4) (Supp. 2005).Â  Willful conduct is conduct that â€œevinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  Whether a parent has willfully failed to visit or support his or her child is a â€œquestion of intent to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each individual case.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 610, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003); Stinecipher v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 98, 620 S.E.2d 93, 96 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The family court has wide discretion to make this determination, but the element of willfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Broome, 307 S.C. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838.Â  â€œThe court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including . . . the ability of the parent to provide support.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572.Â  \r\nIncarceration alone is insufficient to justify TPR.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 337, 543 S.E.2d 580, 583 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In Wilson, the father was incarcerated after the birth of his three children.Â  Two years after his incarceration, the Department took his children into emergency protective custody.Â  A year later, the Department brought a TPR action against the father for willful failure to visit his children.Â  The family court ordered TPR, even though the father requested an opportunity to visit his children at each review hearing.Â  We reversed the family court, holding that â€œ[t]erminating the parental rights of an incarcerated parent requires consideration of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances in the determination of wilfulness.â€Â  Id. at 340, 543 S.E.2d at 584.Â  We noted the record was replete with evidence of not only the fatherâ€™s repeated requests to the Department to visit his children, but also the Departmentâ€™s active role in thwarting the fatherâ€™s attempts to visit his children.Â  Id. at 338, 543 S.E.2d at 583.[5]Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn this case, the record demonstrates the Departmentâ€™s blatant indifference to Fatherâ€™s plight.Â  The Department took Child into emergency custody in August 1997.Â  The Department should have contacted Father at this time.Â  Instead, it appears the Department conducted the case as if Father did not exist.Â  In September 1997, the Department recommended, and the family court adopted, a treatment plan requiring Mother to attend individual counseling, parent effectiveness training classes, and a substance abuse treatment program.Â  The Department did not recommend a treatment plan for Father even though, by Department caseworker Christopherâ€™s own admission, one could have been recommended.Â  When Mother eventually failed to complete her treatment plan, the family court established a permanent plan of TPR and adoption.Â  Again, the Department did not contact Father, even though he risked losing his parental rights to Child.Â  \r\nFor reasons even the Department was unable to explain, the Department took more than two years to file a complaint seeking to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights to Child.Â  During this interim, Father discovered, after four years of searching, that the Department had custody of Child.Â  On October 9, 2000, he wrote Christopher a letter explaining his circumstances and hoping to establish a â€œpositive line of communicationâ€ with the Department.Â  Thus, it took the Department over three years to make contact with Father, and even then, the communication occurred only because Father contacted the Department as a result of his extraordinary efforts to locate Child.Â  It then took Christopher three months to respond.Â  Father continued to write.Â  He indicated he wanted to communicate with Child; he asked for Childâ€™s picture, address, and social security number.Â  He also asked to visit, or at the very least, to write Child.Â  Despite Fatherâ€™s multiple requests, Christopher did not respond until seven months later, on March 18, 2002.[6]Â  By the time Father received this letter, the Department had already brought a TPR action against him.Â Â Â  \r\nChristopher did not assist in connecting Child with his natural father.Â  She did not provide Father with any information that would help him communicate with Child, nor did she send him a picture of Child as Father requested.Â  At trial, Christopher testified she could not provide Father with the information he requested because a Department-hired therapist, Karen Tarpey, recommended Child not communicate with Father because it would not be in Childâ€™s best interest.[7]Â  Â However, Christopher never told Father this was the reason she continued to deny him access to any information regarding contact with Child. Â Instead, she simply did not respond to him.Â Â Â  \r\nEven assuming Christopher had told Father about Tarpeyâ€™s recommendation, there is not much Father could have done about it.Â  The fact remained Father could not communicate with Child because the Department would not allow him to contact Child.Â  Therefore, even if Father had been provided an address to write Child letters, or send him birthday cards, Child would not have received them.Â  The Department would not have allowed Fatherâ€™s correspondence to reach Child because Tarpey opined Childâ€™s exposure to Father would be detrimental.Â  \r\nThe Department can certainly rely on the opinion of a therapeutic expert in determining what is in the best interest of a child in its custody; however, if the expert recommends the child not have parental contact without even contacting the parent herself, it is disingenuous for the Department to initiate a TPR action against the parent for not contacting child.Â  Consequently, even assuming therapist Tarpeyâ€™s recommendation is correct, the mere fact that it may be detrimental to Child for Father to contact Child does not mean Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be automatically terminated. \r\nBased on the record, we find the Department did not demonstrate Father was so indifferent to the right of Child to receive his support and consortium that Father willfully failed to visit and support him.Â  To the contrary, the record reflects Father actively sought to visit and support Child, and, if anything, was prevented from exercising his parental duties because the Department was indifferent to his parental rights.Â  Father could not communicate with Child, let alone visit him, because the Department forbade him from doing so based on Tarpeyâ€™s recommendation.Â  Father was not able to send money to Child despite his attempts to do so because the Department never provided him with an address of where to send a check. \r\nThe family court emphasized the fact that after Father received a response from the Department in January 2001, he did not furnish a list of adoptive resources until July 2002. Â To the extent such a list is relevant, let alone dispositive, in determining whether Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated, we find Fatherâ€™s delay in providing the Department with a list of adoptive resources does not show a settled purpose to forego his parental duties.Â  Because Father grew up in foster care, he recommended his foster mother and foster sister as adoptive resources.Â  Although his foster mother testified she was no longer interested in adopting Child, his foster sister said she was still interested.Â  This recommendation, while not perfect, was nevertheless viable.Â  Moreover, if the Department had made an effort to contact Father when it initially took Child into emergency protective custody in August 1997, Father would have had more options than he does now.Â  In 1997, for example, Fatherâ€™s foster mother, biological father, and biological brother were all possibilities.Â  As Father testified at trial, with the passing years, â€œa lot of things started happening that no one [could] control.â€ Â Â Finally, the mere fact that Father was unable to find a suitable adoptive resource, does not necessarily mean Father willfully failed to visit or support Child.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter considering all relevant facts and circumstances, we hold the Department did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that Father willfully failed to visit or support Child.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights based on his willful failure to visit and support Child. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Child in Foster Care\r\nFather argues that, under the circumstances, Childâ€™s presence in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months alone is not sufficient to support TPR.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe family court can terminate parental rights when it is in the best interest of the child and the â€œchild has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1572(8).Â  â€œA finding pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8) alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 581, 578 S.E.2d 733, 736 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nFather points out that he had only been made aware of Childâ€™s presence in foster care twelve months prior to the filing of the TPR action.Â  However, the purpose of the statutory ground allowing for termination if a child has been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months is to ensure children do not languish in foster care when termination of parental rights would be in their best interests.Â  Doe, 353 S.C. at 581, 578 S.E.2d at 736 (â€œTPR statutes must be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.â€).Â  Thus, it is the childâ€™s perspective, and not the parentâ€™s, that we are concerned with when determining whether this statutory ground has been met.Â  Here, the letter of the law was met once Child resided in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months regardless of Fatherâ€™s knowledge of Childâ€™s whereabouts.[8]\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Best Interest of Child \r\nFather argues TPR is not in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  We agree. \r\nIn TPR cases, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 561, 340 S.E.2d 149, 153 (1986).Â  â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2005).\r\nChild currently resides in a therapeutic foster home with his sister Jazmyn.Â  Both children have special needs.Â  Child has some learning disabilities.Â  Because the two children support each other, all parties, including Father, agree they should remain together.[9]Â  However, there is no assurance the children will remain together, or even at the same foster home.Â  Childâ€™s current foster parents wish to remain as foster parents and, as of the TPR hearing, have not expressed an interest in adopting him.Â  Thus, terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights will not ensure future stability for Child.Â  Moreover, keeping Fatherâ€™s parental rights intact will not disrupt Childâ€™s current living situation.Â Â  Father does not gain custody of Child simply because the Department failed to terminate his parental rights at this time.Â  Rather, by not terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights, Father merely maintains his right to connect with Child as well as his obligation to support Child, emotionally, financially, or otherwise.Â  The Department should, in the best interest of Child, facilitate this connection and accompanying obligation.Â Â  \r\nThe family court noted that Childâ€™s guardian ad litem, William Jordan, recommended TPR would be in the best interest of Child.Â Â  However, Jordan testified that he did not know if Child would be harmed by contact with Father.Â Â  Jordan could not opine on the matter because he never spoke with Father and never talked to Child about Father.Â  Jordan also admitted he never responded to any of Fatherâ€™s correspondence, but said he let his counsel know about it.Â  Accordingly, Childâ€™s GAL recommended terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights without talking to Child about Fatherâ€™s existence and without talking to Father at all.[10]Â  Under these circumstances, we do not understand how Childâ€™s GAL can recommend TPR without any investigation into the situation between Child and his natural father.[11]Â  \r\nFatherâ€™s tireless efforts to connect with Child demonstrate a sincere concern for Childâ€™s well-being. Again, when Father learned of Childâ€™s birth, he immediately established paternity.Â  When Child disappeared, Father wrote hundreds of letters to try to locate Child.Â  After Father found Child, he wrote hundreds more to try to contact him, or even just to have a photograph of him.Â  In addition to expressing a desire to emotionally support Child, Fatherâ€™s letters expressed a desire to financially support Child with what little resources Father had.Â  As the Department stipulated, Father â€œhas done more than anybody [the Departmentâ€™s attorney had] ever seen to try to find his son and to maintain contact with the agencies that had his son.â€Â  Unless long-term incarceration alone is enough to terminate parental rights, which is not the case in South Carolina,[12] we cannot discern any evidence from the record before us indicating termination would be in Childâ€™s best interests.Â  Childâ€™s foster parents are not willing to adopt him, Fatherâ€™s efforts to maintain a relationship with Child have been extraordinary, and the social worker who advised against communication between Father and Child had neither spoken with Father nor spoken to Child about Father. \r\nFatherâ€™s connection with Child may be faint, but it is nevertheless existent.Â  It is also a fundamental liberty interest protected by the United States Constitution.Â  Santosky, 455 U.S. at 753.Â  Such an interest cannot be severed where, as here, the Department failed to present any reason why termination of parental rights would be in Childâ€™s best interest.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Due Process Violation \r\nFather argues TPR violates his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  However, this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the family court, and therefore it is not preserved for review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Jones v. Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 315, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing reasoning, the family court order terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Father was also eligible for parole in July 2005, but at the time of oral argument in January of 2006, Father was still incarcerated.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Apparently, the trio moved to South Carolina without telling Father.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  The Department did not locate her until September 2001.Â Â  \r\n[4]Â  This is the first time the Department acknowledges contact with Father.Â  \r\n[5] Â Compare Wilson to South Carolina Department of Social Services v. Ledford, 357 S.C. 371, 376, 593 S.E.2d 175, 177 (Ct. App. 2004), where we upheld the essential holding of Wilson that incarceration alone is insufficient to justify TPR.Â  In Ledford, the father was incarcerated in Georgia.Â  He only attempted to contact his child twice, and was unsuccessful on both occasions.Â  After a SCDSS caseworker found him via an internet search of the Georgia Department of Corrections, the father made no effort to contact the caseworker or any other SCDSS employee.Â  After SCDSS brought a TPR action against the father, he still made no effort to contact SCDSS.Â  The family court terminated his parental rights and we affirmed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[6]Â  This is only the second response Father received from Christopher, his sonâ€™s caseworker at the Department, since his initial letter of October 9, 2000.Â  \r\n[7]Â  Karen Tarpey is a licensed independent social worker, with a masterâ€™s degree in social work, who accepts referrals from the Department.Â  There is no indication in the record that Ms. Tarpey ever contacted Father prior to making this recommendation.\r\n[8] We note that although the letter of the law was met in this particular case, especially considering Fatherâ€™s incarceration will continue to necessitate foster care for Child, there may be some instances where this statutory ground would not support termination of parental rights despite the passage of a fifteen month stay in foster care.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 420, 589 S.E.2d 753, 756 (2003) (Pleicones, J., concurring) (â€œI am not willing to sever the parent-child relationship solely on the basis that the child has spent fifteen of twenty-two months in foster care where the appellant presented substantial evidence that much of the delay in the processing of this case is attributable to the acts of others.â€).\r\n[9]Â  The two children were not placed together in the same foster home until three years after the Department obtained custody of them.Â Â Â  \r\n[10]Â  Jordan submitted his report on July 16, 2003.Â  Accordingly, pursuant to section 20-7-1549 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), which became effective on January 15, 2003, Jordan had a duty and obligation to conduct an â€œindependent, balanced, and impartial investigation to determine the facts relevant to the situation of the child and the family,â€ including a mandatory interview of Childâ€™s parents.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1549(A)(2)(iv).Â Â Â Â  \r\n[11]Â  We also do not understand how Childâ€™s therapist, Karen Tarpey, can recommend Father not contact Child without ever talking to Child about Father, and without talking to Father at all.Â Â Â  \r\n[12] If the South Carolina General Assembly intended long-term incarceration alone to justify termination of parental rights, it would have made such a provision in the statute.Â  In many states, incarceration is a ground for termination, though even then, the best interests of the child are considered.Â  See, e.g., Ala.

Jackson Kimball, III, Master - In - Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4091\r\nHeard January 11, 2006 â€“ Filed March 6, 2006Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDonald L. Van Riper, Suzanne C. Boulware, of Columbia, for Appellants. \r\nWilliam P. Walker, Jr., of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, an explosion at work injured Charles West while he performed repairs on his own truck during working hours and using his employerâ€™s equipment.Â  The Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission adopted the order of the single commissioner and found that the injury arose out of and in the course of Westâ€™s employment.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  We now affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nAlliance Capital employed West and leased his services to Meylan Enterprises.Â  Frontier Insurance Company provided workersâ€™ compensation insurance to Alliance Capital and Meylan.Â  Meylan conducts business in many states and is primarily involved in heavy industrial cleaning at nuclear power plants and manufacturing facilities.Â  Westâ€™s supervisor, Tex Williams, described West as a â€œforeman . . . [who] overs[aw] the shop activities and all the mechanic work that goes on.â€Â  The injury here occurred at Meylanâ€™s Rock Hill, South Carolina facility.Â  \r\nMeylan required its employees to come to work, clock in and, in the absence of an off-site job assignment, remain on the premises for their eight-hour shift.Â  West and his fellow employees had to be present at the shop (or on a job assignment) to get paid.Â  Because the actual work was sporadic, employees at the Rock Hill facility were to await calls at the shop and do various tasks in preparation for upcoming job assignments.Â  While awaiting job assignments, employees could use their free time as they chose, provided they remained on site.Â  Meylan employees generally spent about half of their time at the shop preparing for a project or on standby and the other half of their time working at job sites.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found that a custom and practice existed at Meylanâ€™s shops of allowing employees, during working hours, to work on their own vehicles in the shop, using shop equipment.Â  Meylanâ€™s supervisors never prohibited or otherwise discouraged this practice.Â  The record contains many examples of Meylanâ€™s acquiescence and approval of this practice, including an instance where Williams, the supervisor, brought his sonâ€™s car into the shop for body work.Â  \r\nMeylan lacked a sufficient number of vehicles at the Rock Hill facility to transport people and equipment to the job sites.Â  Williams, for example, often used his personal vehicle to take people and supplies to and from jobs.Â  West informed Williams he had a truck that could be used to assist in transporting people and equipment.Â  The vehicle was at that time inoperable, and Williams authorized West to travel to West Virginia to transport the truck to Rock Hill for repairs so Meylan could use it for transportation.Â  \r\nSeveral weeks before the accident, West and another Meylan employee drove to West Virginia in a Meylan truck and trailer.Â  Meylan paid West for the trip, including his expenses.Â  Meylan expected to benefit from use of the truck for its operations.Â  When delivered to Rock Hill, the truck was stored in the enclosed shop area of the Meylan facility, where it remained for â€œprobably two or three weeksâ€ prior to the accident.Â  \r\nOn the date of the accident, West completed his work and waited for other Meylan employees to return from a job assignment.Â  During this downtime, West decided to work on the truck.Â  West and another employee removed the gas tank from the truck to clean it.Â  After emptying the gas out of the tank, West began sandblasting the inside of the tank using Meylan equipment.Â  The tank exploded, injuring both employees.[1]Â  West received second-degree and third-degree burns over fifty-four percent of his body.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found that the injury to West arose out of and in the course of his employment, noting that the truck repair was for Meylanâ€™s benefit, on company time, in Meylanâ€™s shop, with Meylanâ€™s equipment, and with Meylanâ€™s permission.Â  The single commissioner thus found the injury compensable and awarded benefits.Â  On review, the Commission affirmed, adopting the order of the single commissioner.Â  Alliance Capital appealed to the circuit court, challenging the finding that the injury arose out of and in the course of Westâ€™s employment.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (2005).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an administrative agency if â€œthe findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of that agency are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€ Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co.,&nbsp;360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control,&nbsp;60 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004)).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act requires that an injury by accident must be one â€œarising out ofâ€ and â€œin the course of employmentâ€ to be compensable.Â  Broughton v. South of the Border,&nbsp;336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 638&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).Â  The injury must both â€œarise out ofâ€ and occur â€œin the course of employmentâ€ to allow recovery.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 634.Â  As presented here, the question is largely one of fact for the Commission.Â  Id.Â  The claimant has the burden of proving facts sufficient to allow recovery under the Act.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nÂ I. Did the injury arise out of the employment?\r\nAlliance Capital first argues that the injury did not arise out of Westâ€™s employment because no causal connection existed between the working conditions and his injury.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe phrase â€˜arising out ofâ€™ in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act refers to the injuryâ€™s origin and cause.â€Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 497, 520 S.E.2d at 638.Â  For an injury to â€œarise out ofâ€ employment it must proximately cause the injury.Â  Id.Â  There must be a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist.,&nbsp;333 S.C. 43, 50, 508 S.E.2d 21, 25&nbsp;(1998).Â  \r\nThe requisite causal connection has been described as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n[I]f the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises â€˜out ofâ€™ the employment.Â  But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.Â  The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood.Â  It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant.Â  It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.Â  \r\n\r\nDouglas v. Spartan Mills, Startex Div.,&nbsp;245 S.C. 265, 269, 140 S.E.2d 173, 175&nbsp;(1965).Â  \r\nAlliance Capital argues the employment did not proximately cause the injury because Westâ€™s injury arose from merely permissive activities, not required duties.Â  Alliance Capital relies on Osteen,&nbsp;333 S.C. 43, 508 S.E.2d 21.Â  In Osteen, an attendance clerk working at an elementary school injured her back filling her ice chest with ice from the school cafeteria and placing it into her car.Â  Id. at 45-46, 508 S.E.2d at 22.Â  The court held the activity to be permissive, and thus no causal connection existed between Osteenâ€™s employment and her injury.Â  Id. at 50, 508 S.E.2d at 25.Â  \r\nIn another case, the court found no causal connection when an employee was injured after leaving work to check on an ill employee.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 497-98, 520 S.E.2d at 638.Â  The court noted that the claimantâ€™s job requirements did not include leaving work to check on sick co-workers.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn both Osteen and Broughton, however, the claimants sustained injuries during activities entirely unrelated to their work duties.Â  Here, the record supports the findingâ€”to the substantial evidence standardâ€”that the truck would be utilized in Meylanâ€™s operations following repairs.Â  A shortage of trucks existed, and West had volunteered the use of his truck once it was restored to operable condition.Â  According to West, whose testimony the Commission deemed credible,[2] supervisor Williams â€œknew that I was wanting to use [the truck] for work.â€ Williams authorized West to drive to West Virginia on company time and at company expense to bring the truck to the shop in Rock Hill, and permitted the truck to be kept at the shop.Â  Williams knew the repairs were necessary to make the truck operational.Â  \r\nWestâ€™s injury arose out of the employment because the truck was being repaired for Meylanâ€™s benefit, using company resources, with Meylanâ€™s consent.Â  We conclude the record establishes the requisite causal connection between the working conditions and the injury.[3]Â  \r\nII. Did the injury occur in the course of employment?\r\nAlliance Capital next argues that the injury did not occur in the course of Westâ€™s employment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe phrase â€˜in the course of the employmentâ€™ refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred.â€Â  Broughton,&nbsp;336 S.C. at 498, 520 S.E.2d at 639.Â  â€œAn injury occurs â€˜in the course ofâ€™ employment within the meaning of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act when it occurs within the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incidental thereto.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nA key factor in determining entitlement to compensation under this prong is whether an employeeâ€™s activity benefited the employer.Â  Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc.,&nbsp;335 S.C. 46, 49, 515 S.E.2d 532, 533&nbsp;(1999).Â  In Hicks, the court denied compensation to an employee who was repairing a personal vehicle at the worksite.Â  The circumstances of Westâ€™s injury present an entirely different situation, for the injury in Hicks occurred on a Saturday, during non-working hours, during work for which the employee received no compensation, and the employer derived no benefit from the vehicle repair.Â  Id.Â  Here, the employer paid West for repairing the vehicle at the worksite, and the activity occurred during working hours, using tools furnished by his employer and for the purpose of remedying the employerâ€™s vehicle shortage at the Rock Hill site.Â  The record sustains the finding that Westâ€™s injury occurred in the course of his employment with Meylan.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the truck repair was an activity arising out of and in the course of Westâ€™s employment with Meylan, and the resulting injury was compensable.Â Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The other employee settled his workersâ€™ compensation claim.\r\n[2]&nbsp; We decline, pursuant to our standard of review, Alliance Capitalâ€™s invitation to assign credibility to Williamsâ€™ contrary testimony.Â  Fact-finding is a matter exclusively within the province of the Commission.Â  Kennedy v. Williamsburg County,&nbsp;242 S.C. 477, 480, 131 S.E.2d 512, 513&nbsp;(1963).Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Because we find substantial evidence supports the finding that Westâ€™s truck was intended for use in Meylanâ€™s operations, we need not address the alternative groundsâ€”the personal comfort doctrineâ€”relied on by the Commission.Â  Osteen, 333 S.C. at 47-48, 508 S.E.2d at 23&nbsp;(observing that under workersâ€™ compensation law, â€œthe personal comfort doctrine has consistently been limited to imperative acts such as eating, drinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort, preparing to begin or quit work, and resting or sleepingâ€); see also Dukes v. Rural Metro Corp.,&nbsp;356 S.C. 107, 110, 587 S.E.2d 687, 689&nbsp;(2003) (â€œThe purpose of the personal comfort doctrine is to allow employees to attend to their biological personal requirements.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4092","title":"Cedar Cove Homeowners Association, Inc. v.

Strickland, Master-In-Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No. Â 4092\r\nHeard February 6, 2006 â€“ Filed March 13, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Rolf Mouin Baghdady, for Appellants.\r\n      Spencer Andrew Syrett, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This appeal concerns the construction of restrictive covenants.Â  Rudy and Margaret DiPietro are residents of the Cedar Cove subdivision in Richland County, South Carolina.Â  The Cedar Cove Homeownersâ€™ Association (the Association) sought and obtained an injunction requiring the DiPietros to remove a brick patio that encroached approximately three feet onto the common area of the subdivision.Â  The DiPietros appeal, and we reverse. Â We find the Declaration of Covenants governing the Cedar Cove Subdivision and a balancing of the equities preclude the issuance of the injunction.Â  \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMargaret and Rudy DiPietro have been residents in Cedar Cove since 1998.Â  The subdivision is managed by the Association, which operates pursuant to by-laws.Â  The property of Cedar Cove is subject to restrictive covenants, known as the â€œDeclaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions for Cedar Cove Subdivision.â€\r\nA previous owner of the DiPietro lot built a wooden deck behind the house, part of which encroached onto the common area.Â  The Association has never challenged the wooden deck and its encroachment onto the common area.Â  In 2001, the DiPietros desired to construct a patio underneath the deck, primarily because the area under the deck was â€œunsightly, and there was some soil erosion . . . .â€Â  Like the wooden deck, the patio would slightly encroach onto the common area.Â  Rudy DiPietro pursued the desired patio by following the then longstanding informal approach to such matters in Cedar Cove, for strict compliance with the procedural requirements in the restrictive covenants was largely ignored.[1]Â  Rudy prepared a sketch of the proposed patio and presented it to Clark Cowsert, a member of the Architectural Review Committee at the time.\r\nCowsert met with Rudy, reviewed the sketch, and even assisted with â€œpull[ing] a string acrossâ€ the ground to determine the precise location and parameters of the patio.Â  Cowsert recommended approval of the patio request to Mike Reed, then president of the Associationâ€™s Board of Directors.Â  According to Cowsert, â€œI gave it to Mr. Reed who was president of the Board[] and everything went according to what my recommendation was.â€Â  Reed also inspected the site, and the record establishes that Reed approved of the patio.Â  Even the Association concedes that â€œthere was some level of approval by Mike Reed.â€Â  Rudy then proceeded with construction of the patio.\r\nIn 2002, new officers were elected, and the days of lax governance were over.Â  As the Associationâ€™s new president, Doug Harder, said, â€œWe try to run the Association like a business.â€Â  The DiPietros were perhaps the first to experience the â€œbusinessâ€ approach.Â  On April 8, 2002, Harder and Charles Zinco, chairman of the Architectural Review Committee, delivered a letter to Rudy, directing Rudy to â€œstop construction.â€Â  As of April 8, 2002, the patio was substantially completed.[2]Â  Rudy was angered by the Associationâ€™s tactics and so informed Harder and Zinco with a â€œfew choice words.â€Â  When Zinco was asked whether it was his â€œimpression that [Rudy] intended to complete the project without further consultation with you all,â€ he responded, â€œOh, yes.Â  Yes, sir.â€Â  Harder expressed similar sentiments, stating that Rudy â€œdid make it known to usâ€ that he was not going to stop construction.Â  As expected, Rudy proceeded to complete the patio.\r\nThe Association delayed in taking action, perhaps because the new officers knew Reed, the former board president, gave â€œsome level of approvalâ€ to the DiPietrosâ€™ patio project.Â  According to Harder, there were a number of reasons for the boardâ€™s prolonged inaction:\r\n\r\n  First of all, we are a volunteer board, and we have lives to live and families to raise, and all three of us, as I recall were traveling a great deal during that spring and summertime.Â  I suppose in trying to â€“ we were trying to come up with some way that maybe we could convince Rudy to voluntarily stop, but I guess the summer got away from us enjoying our time on the lake.Â  So it was no conscious decisioin [sic] about, you know, delaying for any reason.Â  We had no attorney for the association at the time.Â  We had to begin, you know, a search for one.Â  That took some time. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe Association filed its Complaint on January 15, 2003.Â  By then, the patio was completed.Â  The Complaint alleges a trespass on the basis that the patio encroaches on the common areas, in violation of Articles V and VI of the restrictive covenants.Â  The claim for damages was withdrawn at trial, and the Association sought a mandatory injunction â€œdirecting [the DiPietros] to remove that portion of the brick patio that encroaches and trespasses onto the common areas owned by [the Association].â€Â  The master granted the injunction on the basis that the DiPietros failed to â€œsecure the approvalâ€ of the Association in accordance with the restrictive covenants.Â  The DiPietros appealed following an unsuccessful motion to reconsider.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhile a trespass action is one at law, the Association withdrew its claim for damages and sought only an injunction.Â  The character of an action as legal or equitable depends on the relief sought.Â  Compare Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 14, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992) (holding an action for breach of restrictive covenants was at law, because relief sought was general damages for loss of view and invasion of privacy) and Kneale v. Bonds, 317 S.C. 262, 265, 452 S.E.2d 840, 841 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.â€); see also&nbsp;S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001) (holding an action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is an equitable action).Â  Because the Associationâ€™s action is one to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction, it is in equity, and we may find facts in accordance with our own view of the evidence.Â  Brenco v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,&nbsp;363 S.C. 136, 142, 609 S.E.2d 531, 534&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  We acknowledge the superior position of the trial judge to assess witness credibility.Â  We would not, even under de novo review, lightly disregard a trial judgeâ€™s credibility determinations.Â  The resolution of this appeal, however, turns not on a credibility assessment, but on the application of largely undisputed facts to unambiguous restrictive covenants.Â  Moser v. Gosnell,&nbsp;334 S.C. 425, 430, 513 S.E.2d 123, 125&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (holding that when a covenant or contract is clear and unambiguous, matters of construction are questions of law for the court).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nThe DiPietros contend the master erred in granting the injunction.Â  We agree.\r\nWe first dispense with the suggestion that because the common area of the Cedar Cove subdivision is involved, the law of trespass governs and trumps the clear language of the restrictive covenants.Â  Where, as here, issues involving the common area of a subdivisionâ€”as raised by the pleadingsâ€”are resolved by reference to the applicable restrictive covenants, those covenants control.Â  The Associationâ€™s charge of trespass against the DiPietros emanates solely from the restrictive covenants.Â  Indeed, the Associationâ€™s Complaint cites no source to support its claim for relief other than the restrictive covenants.Â  This case was pled and tried on the theory that the DiPietros violated the restrictive covenantsâ€”specifically Articles V and VIâ€”by failing to properly secure approval for the patio.Â  \r\nArticle V of the restrictive covenants controls the resolution of this appeal:\r\nArticle V\r\nArchitectural Control\r\n\r\n  \r\n    No building, fence, wall or other structure shall be commenced, erected or maintained upon the Properties, nor shall any exterior addition to or change or alteration therein be made until the plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, shape, color, height, materials and location of the same shall have been submitted to and approved in writing as to harmony of external design and location in relation to surrounding structures and topography by the Declarant, or by a designated representative.Â  Such approval shall be determined by consideration of the workmanship, materials, harmony or exterior design with existing structures, and location with respect to topography and grade.Â  PROVIDED HOWEVER, that if approval or disapproval is not submitted, or no suit to enjoin construction is commenced prior to substantial completion thereof, it shall be presumed that the party has fully complied with this restriction. \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). \r\nWe find that Mike Reed gave â€œapprovalâ€ to the patio project, according to the longstanding informal approach to restrictive covenant compliance that existed at the time.Â  In any event, we believe the DiPietros must prevail irrespective of formal approval of the project.Â  It is undisputed that there has never been a formal â€œdisapprovalâ€ as contemplated by the restrictive covenants.Â  Harder was asked whether his â€œletter of April 8th [was] intended to be a disapproval of [the] project?â€ Harder answered, â€œNo.â€Â  The goal sought by the Association in the April 8 letter was â€œto stop, talk, and try to come to a resolution.â€Â  Association representatives, however, understood well that Rudy intended to finish the project, and yet the Association took no action until months later after the patio was completed.Â  The Association, which claims a desire for strict compliance with the covenants, may not escape from its own lack of compliance with the restrictive covenants.\r\nWe are then left with the provision that compliance with the restrictive covenants â€œshall be presumed . . . [if] no suit to enjoin construction is commenced prior to substantial completion thereof.â€Â  It is unchallenged, and the master so found, that after the April 8 letter and prior to this action, the DiPietros â€œproceeded to complete the project.â€Â  We adhere to the unambiguous terms of the restrictive covenants.[3]Â  Accordingly, we hold the DiPietros are entitled to the presumption of compliance and that the granting of the injunction was therefore in error.Â  See Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987) (noting that restrictive covenants are voluntary contracts between the parties, and courts should enforce such contracts unless they are indefinite or violate public policy). \r\nÂ Our reversal of the injunction based on a straightforward application of Article V of the restrictive covenants is further supported by our firm view that a balancing of the equities compels the denial of injunctive relief.Â  See Wells, 294 S.C. at 274, 363 S.E.2d at 896 (â€œA court does not automatically issue a mandatory injunction once it finds a restrictive covenant has been violated [as] [t]he court must balance the equities between the parties . . . .â€); Hunnicutt v. Rickenbacker, 268 S.C. 511, 515, 234 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1977) (â€œ[I]t is not every case of a structure erected in violation of a restriction which will call for [a mandatory injunction].â€); Rabon v. Mali, 289 S.C. 37, 40, 344 S.E.2d 608, 610 (1986) (holding equity will refuse her aid when a party, knowing his rights, suffers his adversary to incur expenses, enter into obligations, or otherwise change his position before asserting a claim for enforcement, â€œespecially if an injunction is [requested]â€); Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344-45, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387-88 (1992) (holding a horizontal property regime waived its right to enforce a restrictive covenant by failing to bring a claim for enforcement against a known violation until after a substantial amount was spent on improvements).Â  Having reversed the mandatory injunction, we do not reach the DiPietrosâ€™ remaining assignments of error.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (noting that an appellate court need not address the remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find that under the terms of the restrictive covenants the Association is not entitled to a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of the patio.Â  The order of the master granting the injunction isÂ  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs, and ANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion. \r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting in a separate opinion):Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s reasoning and analysis.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMargaret and Rudy DiPietro are the owners of Lot 5 in the Cedar Cove Subdivision and have resided there since 1998.Â  The subdivision is governed by the Cedar Cove Homeownersâ€™ Association (the Association), a non-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of South Carolina.Â  Management of the Association is governed by the By-Laws.Â  Both the common areas of the subdivision and Lot 5 are subject to the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions for Cedar Cove Subdivision (the restrictive covenants).Â Â  \r\nPursuant to the restrictive covenants, to gain approval for exterior work on oneâ€™s home, an owner must submit plans to the architectural review committee.Â  The plans are then presented to the Board for final approval.Â  In 2001, the DiPietros made an oral application to the Chairman of the Architectural Control Committee, Clark Cowsert, for approval to construct a brick patio behind their residence.Â  Cowsert visually inspected the proposed project and assisted the DiPietros in laying out the plan.Â  There is a question as to whether the plan contemplated an encroachment onto the common areas of the Association.Â  No written approval of the project was ever issued.Â  Cowsert only had authority to recommend the project to the Board of Directors.Â  He could not approve any project himself.Â Â  \r\nPrior to completion of the DiPietrosâ€™ addition, the Board membership changed.Â  The new Board considered the project and determined that it had no authority to consent to an encroachment onto the common areas.Â  The Board instructed the DiPietros to cease work and directed them to remove the portion of the patio that encroached on the common areas.Â  Mr. DiPietro informed the Board he had permission from the previous Board and he did not intend to stop construction.Â  The Board concluded that though there may have been some previous level of approval, the current project extended beyond that approval.Â  There is no record as to the extent of the previous approval.Â Â  \r\nOn January 15, 2003, the Association brought an action against the DiPietros alleging trespass and violations of the restrictive covenants.Â  The trial court found the DiPietros violated the covenants and committed trespass in building the patio.Â  The court ordered the DiPietros to remove that portion of the brick patio that encroaches onto the common areas.Â  The DiPietrosâ€™ deck extends into the common area, but the Board has not asked that it be removed due to the possible expense.Â  The DiPietrosâ€™ Motion to Reconsider was denied. Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe DiPietros raise numerous issues on appeal, most of which can be divided between Cedar Coveâ€™s claim involving trespass and its claim for violations of the restrictive covenants.Â  â€œWhen legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.â€Â  Kiriakides v.

App. 1986)); see also Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1508 (7th ed. 1999) (defining trespass as â€œa legal action for injuries.â€).Â  On appeal from an action at law that was tried without a jury, the appellate court can correct errors of law, but the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs.

Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 267, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct.

City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 544, 553, 409 S.E.2d 797, 802 (Ct. App. 1991) â€œTrespass is any intentional invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s interest in the exclusive possession of his property.â€Â  West v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., 357 S.C. 537, 544, 593 S.E.2d 500, 503 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001)); accord Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  As this Court stated in Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004), \r\n\r\n  â€œTo constitute actionable trespass, however, there must be an affirmative act, invasion of land must be intentional, and harm caused must be the direct result of that invasion.â€Â  Snow v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 544, 553, 409 S.E.2d 797, 802 (Ct. App. 1991); accord Mack v. Edens, 320 S.C. 236, 240, 464 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The gist of trespass is the injury to possession, and generally either actual or constructive possession is sufficient to maintain an action for trespass.Â  Macedonia Baptist Church v. City of Columbia, 195 S.C. 59, 71, 10 S.E.2d 350, 355 (1940).\r\n\r\nHawkins, 358 S.C. at 296-97, 594 S.E.2d at 565-66.Â  \r\n In Snow v. City of Columbia, we instructed,\r\n\r\n  The unwarrantable entry on land in the peaceable possession of another is a trespass, without regard to the degree of force used, the means by which the enclosure is broken, or the extent of the damage inflicted. Lee v. Stewart, 218 N.C. 287, 10 S.E.2d 804 (1940).Â  The entry itself is the wrong.Â  Thus, for example, if one without license from the person in possession of land walks upon it, or casts a twig upon it, or pours a bucket of water upon it, he commits a trespass by the very act of breaking the enclosure.Â  See Moore v. Duke, 84 Vt. 401, 80 A. 194 (1911); 1 G. Addison, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF TORTS, 388 (Wood ed. 1881); Restatement 2d of Torts, 158, comment i, illustration 3 (1965).Â  It is immaterial whether any further damage results.Â  See Brown Jug, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of America, Local 959, 688 P.2d 932 (Alaska 1984).Â  The mere entry entitles the party in possession at least to nominal damages.Â  Lee v. Stewart, supra.Â  To constitute an actionable trespass, however, there must be an affirmative act, the invasion of the land must be intentional, and the harm caused must be the direct result of that invasion.Â  Alabama Power Co. v. C.G. Thompson, 278 Ala. 367, 178 So.2d 525 (1965).Â  Trespass does not lie for nonfeasance or failure to perform a duty.Â  Id.\r\n  \r\n    Intent is proved by showing that the defendant acted voluntarily and that he knew or should have known the result would follow from his act.Â  Snakenberg v. Hartford Casualty Insurance Co., 299 S.C. 164, 383 S.E.2d 2 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Although neither deliberation, purpose, motive, nor malice are necessary elements of intent, the defendant must intend the act which in law constitutes the invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s right.Â  Id.Â  Trespass is an intentional tort; and while the trespasser, to be liable, need not intend or expect the damaging consequence of his entry, he must intend the act which constitutes the unwarranted entry on anotherâ€™s land.Â  See Phillips v. Sun Oil Co., 307 N.Y. 328, 121 N.E.2d 249 (1954); Lee v. Stewart, supra (it is immaterial whether defendant in committing the trespass actually contemplated the resulting damage to plaintiff).\r\n\r\nSnow, 305 S.C. at 52-53, 409 S.E.2d at 802.Â  \r\nThe essence of trespass is the unauthorized entry onto the land of another.Â  Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 464, 434 S.E.2d 296, 306 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œThe distinction between trespass and nuisance is that trespass is any intentional invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s interest in the exclusive possession of his property, whereas nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiffâ€™s use and enjoyment of his property.â€Â  Silvester, 344 S.C. at 286, 543 S.E.2d at 566 (citation omitted); see also F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 427 (2d ed. 1997) (â€œThe requirement of a physical entry distinguishes trespass from nuisance, which protects the right to enjoyment of land rather than the right of possession.â€).Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeownersâ€™ Associations/Trespass Actions Against Residents\r\nThe DiPietros argue that the patio cannot be considered a trespass as they have an interest in the common area.Â  The â€œcommon areaâ€ is defined in the By-Laws and the restrictive covenants as â€œall real property owned by the Association for the common use and enjoyment of the owners.â€Â  The issue of whether homeownersâ€™ associations may maintain trespass actions against residents is novel in South Carolina.Â  The By-Laws as well as South Carolina law concerning trespass is instructive.Â  My research of other jurisdictions reveals only one state analyzing a homeownersâ€™ associationâ€™s action for trespass.Â  In Pine Knoll Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Cardon, 484 S.E.2d 446 (N.C. Ct. App. 1997), the court stated the property ownersâ€™ association did not establish unauthorized entry onto the associationâ€™s seawall, and thus, failed to establish a trespass claim, where the landowner was an association member and association members had a right to use common properties.Â  Id. at 448.Â  \r\nThe DiPietros liken their interest in the common areas to that of ownership and state: â€œownership, together with a right of possession, is a defense to liability for trespass.â€Â  However, their rights, as defined in the By-Laws and the restrictive covenants only extend to the â€œcommon use and enjoymentâ€ of the area.Â  The Association is the owner.Â  The DiPietros were essentially given consent to use and enjoy the common area, but not to go beyond the type of use contemplated in the By-Laws and the restrictive covenants.Â  A trespass may be accomplished by going beyond the consent given for the original entry.Â  See Groce v. Greenville, S. &amp; A. Ry. Co., 94 S.C. 199, 78 S.E. 888 (1913) (holding that if the entry for the purpose of construction was made under the grant or by consent, actual or presumed, the defendant would nevertheless be liable for any trespass committed outside the right of way granted or for any invasion of the property rights of the plaintiff not incident to the proper location and construction of its road, just as it would be in case of an entry without such consent); Burnett v. Postal Telegraph &amp; Cable Co., 79 S.C. 462, 60 S.E. 1116 (1908) (holding that if a company which is given permission to enter on land and construct a line of telegraph wires thereon constructs it in a different place than that designated by the owner, it is guilty of a trespass, and the owner in suing for damages is not confined to a remedy under the condemnation statutes which apply when the entry is by permission and the acts done on the land are incident to the exercise of the right granted by the owner).Â Â  \r\nBy building a patio that encroached onto the common areas owned by the Association, the DiPietros went beyond the original consent given by the Association for the use and enjoyment of the common areas.Â  It is clear from the record that the patio built by the DiPietros encroaches onto the common areas by up to 4.2 feet.Â  In their trial testimony, the DiPietros admitted their right to use the common areas was not absolute and was subject to limitations.Â  For example, they conceded that they could not build a residence on the common areas but could walk over the area.Â  To the extent that the patio encroaches onto the common area, the encroachment constitutes a trespass.Â  \r\nThe DiPietros additionally argue the trial court erred in finding the DiPietros do not have a legal or equitable interest in the common area, because their rights are limited to the same rights â€œthat a shareholder in a corporation would have, essentially none.â€Â  However, the trial court used this statement merely as an analogy.Â  It was made in reference to the fact that the Association is a corporation, and the DiPietros are members of the corporation with no substantial rights involving the decisions of the Association concerning the common areas.Â  \r\nThe DiPietros specifically dispute the following findings of fact by the trial court concerning the trespass: the trial courtâ€™s finding that the patio is solely for the DiPietrosâ€™ personal use; the trial courtâ€™s finding concerning the patio as an enhancement; the trial courtâ€™s finding concerning the purpose of the patio as constructed and maintained for the benefit of the other homeowners; and the trial courtâ€™s finding whether there was a prohibition against the DiPietros from beautifying and enhancing the common area in a way that does not interfere with any other homeownerâ€™s right to use the area.Â  However, evidence was presented at trial that reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact.Â  See Townes Assoc. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (noting that on appeal from an action at law tried without a jury, the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless the findings are not reasonably supported by the evidence).Â Â  Furthermore, the disputed facts, even if found to be incorrect, would not alter the determination that the patio constitutes a trespass.Â  That the patio may be an enhancement or for the neighborhoodâ€™s benefit is not a defense to trespass.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Restrictive Covenants\r\nThe DiPietros argue the trial court erred in finding the DiPietros violated the restrictive covenants and in requiring them to remove the portion of their patio that extends into the common area.Â  I disagree.Â  \r\nThe DiPietros raise numerous arguments concerning the restrictive covenants, beginning with the contention that the trial court erred in finding the DiPietros violated Articles V and VI of the restrictive covenants.Â  Article V (Architectural Control) of the restrictive covenant states: \r\n\r\n  No building, fence, wall or other structure shall be commenced, erected or maintained upon the Properties, nor shall any exterior addition to or change or alteration therein be made until the plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, shape, color, height, materials and location of the same shall have been submitted to and approved in writing as to harmony of external design and location in relation to surrounding structures and topography by the Declarant, or by a designated representative.Â  Such approval shall be determined by consideration of the workmanship, materials, harmony or exterior design with existing structures, and location with respect to topography and grade.Â  PROVDIED HOWEVER, that if approval or disapproval is not submitted, or no suit to enjoin construction is commenced prior to substantial completion thereof, it shall be presumed that the party has fully complied with this restriction.Â Â  \r\n\r\nArticle VI refers to restrictions on the use of the property.Â  \r\nâ€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature.â€Â  Seabrook Island Property Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Berger, 365 S.C. 234, 239, 616 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2005.) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 75, 202 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1974)); see also Seabrook Island Property Owners Assâ€™s v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature and bind the parties thereto in the same manner as any other contract.â€) (citing Palmetto Dunes Resort v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 336 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 1985)).Â  â€œThe word â€˜covenantâ€™ means to enter into a formal agreement, to bind oneself in contract, and to make a stipulation.â€Â  20 Am. Jur. 2d Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions Â§ 1.1 (footnotes omitted). \r\nIn Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 363 S.E.2d 891 (1987), our supreme court edified:\r\n\r\n  The historical disfavor of restrictive covenants by the law emanates from the widely held view that societyâ€™s best interests are advanced by encouraging the free and unrestricted use of land.Â  See, Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 263 S.E.2d 378 (1980); Edwards v. Surratt, 228 S.C. 512, 90 S.E.2d 906 (1956). See also, Knox v. Scott, 62 N.C.App. 732, 303 S.E.2d 422 (1983).Â  Courts tend to strictly interpret restrictive covenants and resolve any doubt or ambiguities in a covenant on the presumption of free and unrestricted land use.Â  Edwards v. Surratt, supra.Â  Thus, to enforce a restrictive covenant, a party must show that the restriction applies to the property either by the covenantâ€™s express language or by a plain unmistakable implication.Â  Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., supra; see also, Davey v. Artistic Builders, Inc., 263 S.C. 431, 211 S.E.2d 235 (1975).\r\n  \r\n    The rule of strict construction governing restrictive covenants does not preclude their enforcement.Â  A restrictive covenant will be enforced if the covenant expresses the partyâ€™s intent or purpose, and this rule will not be used to defeat the clear express language of the covenant.Â  Palmetto Dunes v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 336 S.E.2d 15 (1985); Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., supra. See generally, Vickery v. Powell, 267 S.C. 23, 225 S.E.2d 856 (1976); Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 202 S.E.2d 363 (1974).Â  This restrictive covenant is a voluntary contract between the parties.Â  Courts shall enforce such covenants unless they are indefinite or contravene public policy.Â  Vickery v. Powell, supra.\r\n\r\nSea Pines, 294 S.C. at 270, 363 S.E.2d at 893-94.\r\nA covenant may run with the land where there is â€œan indication that the parties intended for the covenant to run with the land.â€Â  Charping v. J.P. Scurry &amp; Co., Inc., 296 S.C. 312, 315, 372 S.E.2d 120, 122 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Cheves v. City Council of Charleston, 140 S.C. 423, 138 S.E. 867 (1927)).Â  In Epting v. Lexington Water Power Co. 177 S.C. 308, 320, 181 S.E. 66, 71 (1935), the court explained that covenants running with the land must â€œrelate to the realty demised, having for its object something annexed to, or inherent in, or connected with the land; that its performance or nonperformance must affect the nature, quality, value, or mode of enjoyment of the demised premises; and in this State, certainly, the mere fact of its being a part of the consideration is not sufficient.â€ \r\n\r\n  Restrictive covenants often authorize the creation of a homeownersâ€™ association, usually in the form of a not-for-profit corporation, and grant it authority to manage common areas, make regulations, levy assessments, and other similar privileges.Â  Homeownersâ€™ associations are contractually limited by the restrictive covenants establishing them.\r\n  While homeownersâ€™ associations typically have the power to regulate the use of common areas, their regulations cannot prohibit a usage contrary to any restrictions creating easements or rights of use of property in owners.Â  \r\n\r\n17 S.C.

Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).\r\nIn Sprouse v. Winston, the supreme court observed:\r\n\r\n  The rule of construction applicable here is set forth in 26 C.J.S., Deeds, Â§ 163:\r\n  \r\n    â€˜Restrictive covenants are to be construed most strictly against the grantor and persons seeking [to] enforce them, and liberally in favor of the grantee, all doubts being resolved in favor of a free use of property and against restrictions.Â Â  This rule, however, obtains only where the parties have failed to express their meaning with sufficient clarity to enable the court to say that its construction is plain and admits of no doubt; the rule will not be applied to defeat the obvious purpose of the restriction, nor does it require an unnatural and strained construction of the words used; and before giving effect to the rule the court will have recourse to every aid, rule, or canon of construction to ascertain the intention of the parties, since it is the duty of courts to enforce, not to make, contracts.â€™\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Further quoting C.J.S., Deeds, Â§ 163, it is stated:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nâ€˜Words used are to be taken in their ordinary and popular sense, unless they have acquired a peculiar and special meaning in the particular relation in which they appear, or with respect to the particular subject matter, or unless it appears from the context that the parties intended to use them in a different sense. * * *â€™\r\n  \r\n\r\n212 S.C. 176, 184-85, 46 S.E.2d 874, 878 (1948).Â  See also Forest Land Co. v. Black, 216 S.C. 255, 57 S.E.2d 420 (1950) (â€œThe fundamental rule in construing covenants and restrictive agreements is that the intention of the parties as shown by the agreement, governs.â€).\r\nThere are numerous cases throughout the country with facts similar to those in the instant case.Â  In Wescott v. Burtonwood Manor Condominium Assâ€™n Bd. of Managers, 743 S.W.2d 555 (Mo. App. 1987), the court held that condominium unit ownersâ€™ construction of improvements without permission of the condominium association board of managers, and in violation of condominium by-laws, warranted the issuance of a mandatory injunction to remove flood retaining walls and glass greenhouse covers from common elements, even though they had been erected to prevent flood damage to the ownersâ€™ units.Â  Id. at 561.Â  Â Similarly, in The Fountains of Palm Beach Condominium, Inc. v. Farkas, 355 So.2d 163 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1978), the court upheld an injunction where the defendant/ownerâ€™s husband attempted to obtain permission for the construction of a patio on the common elements.Â  The management firm told the owner it had no objections, and the board of directors of the condominium association informed him that they had no legal status and were therefore unable to grant or deny permission. Id. at 163.Â  The owner proceeded with construction, and the association filed suit seeking a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of the patio slab at the ownerâ€™s expense.Â  Id.Â  The Declaration of Condominium provided that each owner agreed not to make structural additions or alterations to his unit and not to make alterations of the common elements without the prior written consent of the management firm and the association.Â  Id. at 164.Â  The declaration provided for the remedy of injunction to seek compliance with the provisions of the declaration.Â  Id.Â  The court granted a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of the patio slab, even though defendant argued that the failure of the management firm and the association to object to her intentions should operate as an estoppel or as a waiver of the associationâ€™s right to complain after the patio slab had been laid.Â Â  Farkas, 355 So.2d at 164.Â  \r\nThough it is not clear in the trial courtâ€™s order which section of Article VI the DiPietros violated, it is not necessary to find the DiPietros violated Article VI at all, as they violated Article V.Â Â  The DiPietros failed to seek approval as contemplated by the restrictive covenants prior to construction of their patio and did not stop construction when instructed to by the Board.Â  The DiPietros rely heavily on an exception in the restrictive covenants which provides that â€œif approval or disapproval is not submitted, or no suit to enjoin construction is commenced prior to substantial completion thereof, it shall be presumed that the party has fully complied with this restriction.â€Â  However, the evidence presented at trial supports the finding that the patio was not substantially complete prior to the letter informing the DiPietros to cease construction.Â  The bricks for the patio had not been laid when the letter was delivered. \r\nWhile â€œ[a] court does not automatically issue a mandatory injunction once it finds a restrictive covenant has been violated as the court must balance the equities between the parties,â€ the instant case merits an injunction.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 363 S.E.2d 891 (1987).\r\n\r\n  â€œThe right to enforce a restrictive covenant is not limited to mere preventive action, but will, in a proper case, extend to requiring a defendant, by mandatory injunction, to repair an injury already done, or to remove a structure already erected . . . .Â  However, it is not every case of a structure erected in violation of a restriction which will call for such relief.Â  The issuance of a mandatory injunction depends upon the equities between the parties, and it rests in the sound judicial discretion of the court whether such an injunction should be granted.Â  Where a great injury will be done to the defendant, with very little if any to the plaintiff, the courts will deny equitable relief.â€\r\n\r\nHunnicutt v. Rickenbacker, 268 S.C. 511, 515-16, 234 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1977)) (quoting 29 Am. Jur. 2d Covenants, etc., Â§ 328).Â  This is not a case where the harm to the DiPietros would outweigh the benefit to the Association.Â  The trial court found that the patio may be easily removed, and the testimony supports this finding. \r\nThe DiPietros specifically dispute the following findings of fact concerning the restrictive covenants: the trial courtâ€™s failure to find approval of the patio by the Board; the finding that work was commenced â€œsome months laterâ€ after the initial meeting with Cowsert; the failure to find evidence of action other than a telephone call with the chairman; and the finding that the DiPietros â€œconceded that they submitted no written proposal as required by the covenants.â€Â  The evidence supports all of these findings of fact.Â  The evidence submitted at trial supports the finding that there was a delay in beginning construction of the patio from the time Mr. DiPietro met with Clark Cowsert.Â  Mr. Cowsert stated, in response to the question of whether there was some delay, â€œI think so.â€Â  Other than a telephone call from the Chairman of the Committee to the Chairman of the Board, there was no evidence of any action on the DiPietrosâ€™ application.Â  The trial court apparently was referring to action by the Board itself and not by individual members of the Board.Â  Cowsert testified that he did not have the ability to grant permission; he only had the authority to recommend approval to the Board.Â  Though it was asserted that Mike Reed gave the DiPietros permission, he did not testify at trial.Â  Lastly, the DiPietros argue that because they showed Cowsert a drawing of the design for the patio, it should constitute a written request.Â  The trial court determined this was not the type of written request contemplated by the restrictive covenants and this conclusion is supported by the evidence.Â  \r\nIV. Additional Arguments Concerning Findings of Fact\r\nThe DiPietros raise numerous additional arguments concerning findings of fact by the trial court.Â  These arguments stem from the trial courtâ€™s order, but do not necessarily relate to either the claim of trespass or the violation of restrictive covenants.Â  I find these arguments unpersuasive.Â  \r\nThe DiPietros contend the trial court erred in finding that they ignored the letter of April 8, 2002.Â  This finding is completely supported by the evidence at trial.Â  Mr. DiPietro readily admitted that work did not cease after the receipt of the letter, and even though he knew the Board wanted him to stop building the patio, he continued.Â  The DiPietros maintain the trial court erred in failing to find that the Associationâ€™s lawsuit against the DiPietros was motivated by spite and a personal vendetta.Â  I agree with the trial court that the DiPietros failed to support this argument at trial.Â  Other than Mr. DiPietroâ€™s own testimony that he thought it was a vendetta, no other evidence was presented at trial that would support such an accusation.Â  There was evidence that other encroachments exist in the neighborhood that have not been the subject of litigation, but no evidence was submitted of other encroachments, unfinished at the time of the new Board that were overlooked.Â  In fact, the evidence showed that the new Board took initiative in making sure homeowners complied with the building requirements with a letter issued March 15, 2002, asking that homeowners wishing to build submit requests to the committee for approval. Â Â \r\nThe DiPietros contend the trial court erred in failing to find that the patio was approved and substantially complete prior to the appellantâ€™s receiving the request to cease and in finding an ouster.Â  I find no error.Â  The DiPietros further argue the trial court erred in finding no written document granting an easement in the common areas.Â  However, the trial courtâ€™s order actually stated, â€œThere is no written document granting the Defendants any easement or permission to maintain the encroachment.â€Â  In its order, the trial court was clearly referring to approval of the encroachment after it was built, not a prior easement.Â  The final three issues raised by the DiPietros are general complaints concerning the decision of the trial court, and do not need to be dealt with individually as the specifics of these arguments were dealt with in the analysis of other issues raised.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI would hold that an action for TRESPASS may be maintained by a homeownersâ€™ association against a resident homeowner in regard to the common elements property.Â  I would rule that an action for VIOLATION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS may be utilized by a homeownersâ€™ association against a resident homeowner in regard to the common elements property.Â  \r\nIn my view, the homeownersâ€™ association proved the theories of TRESPASS and VIOLATION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS against the resident homeowners in reference to the common elements property.Â  Accordingly, I VOTE to AFFIRM.\r\n\r\n[1] Â For example, Terry Frownfelter, a longtime Cedar Cove resident, acknowledged that many of the residents â€œthat have lived there over the fourteen years that Iâ€™ve been there basically have been able to do what they want to.Â  Iâ€™m thirty feet into the common area myself.â€Â  \r\n[2] The Associationâ€™s final brief refers to the patio as â€œ80% completed when [Rudy] received the [April 8] letter from the Board.â€ The Association characterizes the 80% figure as a concession by the DiPietros.Â  (Respondentâ€™s final brief, 6).\r\n[3] We reach this result without the aid of the settled principle that â€œ[r]estrictive covenants are to be construed most strictly against the grantor and persons seeking [to] enforce them, and liberally in favor of the grantee, all doubts being resolved in favor of a free use property and against restrictions.â€Â  Sprouse v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Appellant, James Rogers, was tried for and convicted of accessory before the fact of armed robbery.Â  He appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in failing to suppress evidence of money found in the back of a police car because it was the fruit of an illegal stop.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 31, 2002, a man with a gun walked into Cash U.S.A., demanded money from the assistant manager of the business, and left with over $1,000.Â  Thereafter, the Williamsburg County Grand Jury indicted Rogers, along with Cortez Brown, Kajuna Mitchum, and Quantrell Wilson, with various offenses concerning the armed robbery at Cash U.S.A.Â  \r\nAt the start of the case, Rogers made a pretrial motion to suppress money evidence in this case arguing it was the result of an illegal stop.Â  Rogers asserted the money, found in the back of a police car after he was transported in the car, was fruit of the poisonous tree because the authorities did not have probable cause to stop the vehicle in which Rogers was riding.Â  The trial court held an in camera hearing, at which time the State presented the testimony of Sergeant Shannon Coker with the Kingstree Police Department.Â  \r\nSergeant Coker testified that around 2:15 p.m. on January 31, he received a call from a confidential informant who was working with the Kingstree Police Department on various cases.Â  He then met with the informant, who told Sergeant Coker about a robbery that was to take place that afternoon at the Cash U.S.A. on Long Street.Â  He told the officer the individuals who would be involved in the armed robbery were James Rogers, Quantrell Wilson, Cortez Brown, and Kajuna Mitchum.Â  The informant also stated the men were supposed to use a white Honda automobile that Rogers had been seen driving.Â  The confidential informant told Sergeant Coker that he heard a conversation regarding the armed robbery that was supposed to take place, including where it would occur, the vehicle used, and the individuals involved.Â  This discussion occurred on the afternoon before the robbery.Â  Sergeant Coker remembered that the informant identified at least one of the co-defendants, Kajuna Mitchum, as having been involved in this conversation.Â  Sergeant Coker testified he had used the confidential informant that provided the information about the robbery numerous times in the past, and the past information he had provided proved to be reliable.Â  \r\nThe sergeant called his supervisor and relayed the information he had received.Â  As he was driving the confidential informant home, a call came over the radio indicating there had been an armed robbery at the Cash U.S.A.Â  The officer let the informant out of his vehicle and proceeded to the Pine Avenue area, where Rogers resided.Â  While watching Rogersâ€™ house, he observed a white Honda with four occupants pull up to a stop sign and turn right onto Pine Avenue.Â  The officer pulled in behind the vehicle and recognized it as the vehicle in which Rogers had been seen.Â  Sergeant Coker continued to follow the vehicle until his supervisor and other deputies arrived in the area.Â  He then activated his blue lights.Â  \r\nRogers exited the passenger side of the vehicle and the officers instructed him to get back into the vehicle.Â  Rogers continued to walk away from the vehicle, and the vehicle â€œtook off,â€ leaving Rogers behind.Â  Cokerâ€™s supervisor dealt with Rogers while the sergeant engaged in a vehicle pursuit of the Honda.Â  \r\nBased on the testimony of Sergeant Coker, the trial judge denied Rogersâ€™ motion to suppress finding that there was reasonable suspicion, â€œbased on sufficient facts to suspect that criminal activity was involved,â€ such that the authorities had a reasonable basis to stop the car.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case, the appellate standard of review is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 111, 603 S.E.2d 594, 596 (2004).Â  The appellate court will reverse only when there is clear error.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRogers appeals his conviction arguing the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the money found in the back seat of a police car in which he had been transported because it was tainted fruit seized as the result of an illegal stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œ[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  The stopping of a vehicle and the detention of its occupants constitute a seizure and implicate the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 389, 577 S.E.2d 498, 501 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653-54 (1979)).Â  Our courts have held that in South Carolina, an officer may stop and briefly detain the occupants of a car without treading on Fourth Amendment rights, even without probable cause to arrest, if he has a reasonable suspicion that the occupants are involved in criminal activity.Â  Id.; Sikes v. State, 323 S.C. 28, 30-31, 448 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1994); Knight v. State, 284 S.C. 138, 141, 325 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1985).Â  â€œâ€˜[A] policeman who lacks probable cause but whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime, may detain that person briefly in order to investigate the circumstances that provoke that suspicion.â€™â€Â  State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 192, 519 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1999) (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439 (1984)).Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜Reasonable suspicionâ€™ requires a â€˜particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.â€™â€Â  State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 69, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2002) (quoting United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981)).Â  â€œIn determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, â€˜the totality of the circumstances--the whole picture--â€™ must be considered.â€Â  Id.Â  (quoting Cortez, 449 U.S. at 417); see also State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe term â€˜reasonable suspicionâ€™ requires a particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.Â  In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the whole picture must be considered.â€)Â  Reasonable suspicion is something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.Â  State v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 202, 539 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  However, it is less than the level required for probable cause.Â  Id.  \r\nRogers contends there were insufficient indicia of reliability of the information provided by the confidential informant for the police to make an investigatory stop.Â  Accordingly, Rogers maintains the stop was improper, and the trial judge therefore erred in allowing the introduction of any evidence as a result of the investigatory stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making his argument, Rogers relies on the case of State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 532 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000), which relied on the case of Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), both of which held an anonymous tip provided insufficient indicia of reliability to justify an investigatory stop.Â  We find Green and J.L. clearly distinguishable from the case at hand.Â  Both Green and J.L. involved investigatory stops based on anonymous tips, wherein the courts found the anonymous tips provided insufficient indicia of reliability to make an investigatory stop.Â  Here, on the other hand, the tip was provided, not by an anonymous tipster, but a known confidential informant, whom the officers had used numerous times in the past and whose information had proved to be reliable.Â  In J.L., the United States Supreme Court noted, â€œUnlike a tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated, an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informantâ€™s basis of knowledge or veracity.â€Â  J.L., 529 U.S. at 270 (citations omitted).Â  In Green, this court, citing to J.L., stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe only information available to the officer was the statement of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the money and narcotics, nor supplied any basis for the officer to believe he had inside information about Green.Â  Since the telephone call was anonymous, the caller did not place his credibility at risk and could lie with impunity.Â  Therefore, we cannot judge the credibility of the caller, and the risk of fabrication becomes unacceptable.\r\n\r\nGreen, 341 S.C. at 218, 532 S.E.2d at 898 (citations omitted).\r\nIn the case at hand, the officer received the information from a known, accountable informant whose reputation could be assessed and who explained how he knew about the planned robbery, thereby supplying a basis, outside of his already proven reliability, for Sergeant Coker to believe the confidential informant had inside information on the matter.Â  \r\nWe further note, this case is distinguishable from Green and J.L. in that, at the time of the investigatory stop here, the officers knew that a crime had, in fact, already occurred.Â  Here, the officers were not investigating the possibility that a crime may be occurring, but were investigating a crime that had occurred and had been independently reported.\r\nThe record shows a known and reliable informant provided Sergeant Coker with the names of four persons, including Rogers, that were planning to commit an armed robbery at the Cash U.S.A. on Long Street that afternoon, and indicated the men planned to use a white Honda automobile that Rogers had been seen driving.Â  When Sergeant Coker received information that the robbery had just occurred, he drove to the area where Rogers lived, watched Rogersâ€™ house, and observed a white Honda with four occupants, the same number of people that the informant reported were to be involved in the robbery.Â  As he pulled in behind the Honda, he recognized the vehicle as the one â€œRogers had been in or had been seen to be in.â€Â  Under the totality of the circumstances, we hold Officer Coker had a particularized and objective basis that would lead Sergeant Coker to suspect the occupants of the Honda had committed a crime such that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the investigatory stop.Â  Accordingly, there is evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s findings and we find no error.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Rogersâ€™ conviction isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4097","title":"In the Interest of Terrence M.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4097","description":"The State appeals from a family court order in which the court found it did not have jurisdiction to order a juvenile to pay restitution because the juvenile was no longer on probation.

The possession of crack charge was dismissed without prosecution, and Terrence admitted to disturbing schools.Â  He also admitted he was in contempt of court for failing to comply with his home detention agreement.Â Â Â  Terrence was adjudicated delinquent and ultimately committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) for an indeterminate period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday. In the commitment order, the family court also directed the solicitorâ€™s office to schedule a restitution hearing to determine restitution owed on the 2002 possession of a stolen motor vehicle charge.Â  \r\nOn January 20, 2005, a restitution hearing was finally held. By this time, Terrence had been released from DJJ, was no longer on parole for his 2004 adjudication, and was incarcerated as an adult.Â  Prior to the restitution hearing, Terrence argued the family court lacked jurisdiction to order restitution because he was no longer on probation.Â  The family court initially disagreed, held the restitution hearing, and ordered Terrence to pay $1,184.62 in restitution.[2] Terrence simultaneously filed a notice of appeal and made a motion for reconsideration, reiterating his argument regarding jurisdiction.Â  Ultimately, the family court agreed, finding that because Terrence was no longer on probation, it did not have jurisdiction to order restitution.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBoth parties agree there is no statutory authority for the family court to impose restitution except as a condition of probation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7805(A)(3) (Supp. 2005) (â€œ[T]he court may impose monetary restitution . . . as a condition of probation.â€).Â  However, the State argues Terrenceâ€™s 2002 probationary sentence for an â€œindefinite periodâ€ had not terminated at the time of the restitution hearing.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family court has the authority to place a child on probation for a period of time not to exceed the childâ€™s eighteenth birthday. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7805(A)(3) (Supp. 2005). â€œA child placed on probation by the court remains under the authority of the court only until the expiration of the specified term of the childâ€™s probation.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn 2002, Terrence was placed on probation for an indefinite period. Two years after being placed on probation, Terrence was committed to DJJ on new charges.Â  Although we recognize the practical difficulty Terrenceâ€™s probation officer would have had supervising Terrence during his commitment, we cannot ignore the lack of a family court order revoking Terrenceâ€™s probation.Â  Because Terrenceâ€™s probation was never revoked and Terrence has not yet attained the age of eighteen, the language of section 20-7-7805(A)(3) constrains us to find his sentence of indefinite probation continued even after being committed to DJJ.Â Â  Thus, the family court had jurisdiction to order restitution on January 20, 2005.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court rescinding its previous order of restitution is reversed.Â  In fairness to Terrence, who never had the opportunity to appeal from the family courtâ€™s initial order setting the amount of restitution, we decline to reinstate that order and instead remand this case for a de novo restitution hearing.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Restitution was sought because of damage to the stolen car.\r\n[2] After ordering restitution, there was some confusion regarding which agency would be responsible for monitoring the case.Â  A representative from DJJ stated that Terrenceâ€™s probation ended once he was committed, and since then, his parole had ended from the crime for which he was committed.Â  According to the representative, DJJ had no jurisdiction over Terrence because he was no longer on probation or parole.Â  To circumvent that problem, the court ordered the solicitorâ€™s office to track Terrenceâ€™s restitution payments, and in the event Terrence failed to pay, the solicitorâ€™s office could file a contempt of court charge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4094","title":"City of Aiken v.

Early, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4094\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2006 â€“ Filed March 20, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLeon E. Green, of Aiken, for Appellant.\r\nCity Solicitor Richard L. Pearce, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â David Michael Koontz was tried in absentia and without counsel.Â  He was convicted of driving under suspension (DUS), third offense.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to six months and a $2,100 fine.Â  On appeal, Koontz argues the trial judge erred in proceeding with his trial in absentia.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn May 8, 2004, Koontz drove his children to the public safety headquarters to deliver them to his wife, from whom he was separated.Â  As Koontz drove up, his wife informed Aiken Department of Public Safety Officer Edgar Gonzalez that Koontz should not be driving because his license was suspended.Â  Officer Gonzalez observed Koontz driving a Dodge truck and verified with dispatch that Koontzâ€™s license was suspended.Â  He arrested Koontz for DUS, third offense.\r\nKoontz was charged with DUS, third offense, by South Carolina Uniform Traffic Ticket #70962CT.Â  The traffic ticket set a trial date for June 28, 2004.Â  Between May 8, 2004 and June 28, 2004, Koontz hired an attorney to represent him.Â  In defense counselâ€™s June 25, 2004 notice of representation letter, he notified the municipal judge he was representing Koontz, requested a jury trial, and asked that he be informed of all court dates.Â  The trial was continued from June 28 to another date.Â  Defense counsel was informed of the August 3, September 21, and October 19, 2004, Aiken Municipal Court jury terms.\r\nOn October 19, at the start of the October term of jury trials, defense counsel petitioned the municipal court judge to be relieved as attorney for Koontz due to Koontzâ€™s failure to: (1) respond to his phone calls; (2) pay him; and (3) otherwise aid in the defense preparation.Â  The Aiken City Solicitor informed the trial judge that defense counsel attended roll call on October 19, 2004 and â€œindicated that he had notified [Koontz] to be here and that he was going to be relieved as his attorney.â€Â  In his motion to be relieved, defense counsel declared: â€œUpon being notified that [Koontzâ€™s] case was on the trial roster for the week of October 18, [defense counsel] sent [Koontz] notice of his trial at the address provided by [Koontz].â€Â  Koontz did not contact his attorney, the city solicitor, or the municipal judge and did not show up for roll call or jury selection.Â  Defense counsel was relieved from further representation of Koontz on October 19, the same day as roll call and jury selection for Koontzâ€™s trial.\r\nOn October 20, 2004, Koontz was tried in his absence for DUS, third offense.Â  The jury found Koontz guilty as charged.\r\nKoontz received notice of his conviction the same day.Â  On October 26, 2004, Koontz filed an appeal with the circuit court.Â  Koontz alleged he was entitled to a new trial because he did not receive notice of the trial date and due process was denied him because he was not given the opportunity to defend himself at trial.Â  The circuit judge affirmed the conviction and sentence.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal appeals from municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception.Â  State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 556 S.E.2d 691 (Ct. App. 2001); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2005) (â€œThere shall be no trial de novo on any appeal from a municipal court.â€).Â  The appellate court reviewing the criminal appeal from the circuit court may review for errors of law only.Â  State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 199 S.E.2d 61 (1973); Henderson, 347 S.C. at 457, 556 S.E.2d at 692.Â  In criminal cases, the court of appeals sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); Landis, 362 S.C. at 101, 606 S.E.2d at 505.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKoontz asserts the trial court â€œcommit[ted] reversible error when it tried [Koontz] in his absence and did not make a factual finding on the issue of whether [Koontz] received notice of the trial.â€Â  Additionally, Koontz contends â€œthere was no finding of fact by the presiding judge that [Koontz] had in fact waived his right to be present for his trial.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nA criminal defendant has a constitutional right guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to be present at trial.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. VI; Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 338 (1970) (â€œOne of the most basic of the rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause is the accusedâ€™s right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his trial.â€).Â  However, Rule 16, SCRCrimP provides:\r\n\r\nExcept in cases wherein capital punishment is a permissible sentence, a person indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried in his absence upon a finding by the court that such person has received notice of his right to be present and that a warning was given that the trial would proceed in his absence upon a failure to attend the court.\r\n\r\nThus, it is well established that a defendant may be tried in his absence.Â  State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 584 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWhile Rule 16 permits a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to be present, such a waiver is permitted only in limited circumstances.Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In order for a criminal defendant to be tried in absentia, certain requirements must first be met.Â  State v. Truesdale, 345 S.C. 542, 548 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  A trial judge must determine a defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial in order to try the case in absentia.Â  State v. Ritch, 292 S.C. 75, 354 S.E.2d 909 (1987); State v. Jackson, 288 S.C. 94, 341 S.E.2d 375 (1986); Truesdale, 345 S.C. at 549 n.5, 548 S.E.2d at 899 n.5; State v. Castineira, 341 S.C. 619, 535 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d, 351 S.C. 635, 572 S.E.2d 263 (2002).Â  Additionally, the trial judge must make findings of fact on the record that the defendant (1) received notice of his right to be present; and (2) was warned that the trial would proceed in his absence should he fail to attend.Â  Jackson, 288 S.C. at 96, 341 S.E.2d at 375; Castineira, 341 S.C. at 623, 535 S.E.2d at 451.\r\nNotice of the term of court for which the trial is set constitutes sufficient notice to enable a criminal defendant to make an effective waiver of his right to be present.Â  State v. Jackson, 290 S.C. 435, 351 S.E.2d 167 (1986); Ellis v. State, 267 S.C. 257, 227 S.E.2d 304 (1976); see also State v. Goode, 299 S.C. 479, 385 S.E.2d 844 (1989) (stating general notice given by courts of general session as to which term an individual will be tried in is sufficient to enable that individual to effectively waive his right to be present).Â  If the record, however, does not include evidence to support a finding that the defendant was afforded notice of his trial, the resulting conviction in absentia cannot stand.Â  Jackson, 290 S.C. at 436, 351 S.E.2d at 167.\r\nWhen Koontz posted bond on May 9, 2004, the day after his arrest, he was provided an order specifying methods and conditions of release.Â  The order contained, in Paragraph 3, the following language:\r\n\r\n3.Â  That the defendant shall appear at . . . the session of . . . municipal . . . court beginning on . . . 6-28-04 at . . . 8:30 oâ€™clock, A.M., at . . . 251 Laurens Street, Aiken, SCÂ  29801.Â  If no final disposition is made during that session, the defendant shall appear at such other times and places as ordered by the court.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nKoontz specifically initialed this paragraph, which is highlighted on the form by being enclosed in a box. This form contained an â€œAcknowledgement by Defendant,â€ which read: â€œI understand and have been informed that I have a right and obligation to be present at trial and should I fail to attend the court, the trial will proceed in my absence.â€Â  Koontz signed his name at the bottom of this form.\r\nOn the â€œChecklist for Magistrates and Municipal Judgesâ€ dated May 9, 2004, the judge noted that Koontz â€œwas informed . . . [of] [h]is right and obligation to be present at trial and that trial will proceed in his absence if he fails to attend.â€\r\nOn October 19, prior to jury selection, the judge asked: â€œIs [Koontz] here?â€Â  The city solicitor responded: â€œNo sir, Judge. His lawyer appeared and he has a motion on your desk to be relieved as his counsel. We are ready to proceed with the trial in his absence.â€Â  After the jury was selected and the trial was about to begin on October 20, the judge reviewed Koontzâ€™s absence from the courtroom.Â  He advised the jury of Koontzâ€™s legal rights and that Koontz was given notice of his right to be present at trial.Â  The judge noted: â€œJust for a moment to revisit what I told you all last night Mr. Koontz was given a summons and notice to appear yesterday afternoon.â€\r\nAccording to defense counsel, Koontz was aware of the October 19 jury trial term and the need for him to be present for roll call and trial.Â  Koontz was on notice early in the process of his need to be at each term of municipal court.Â  More importantly, his retained attorney notified him of the October term when his case was going to be tried.\r\nThe record is replete with Koontzâ€™s notices to be in court for his trial.Â  He was warned that a failure to appear would result in a trial in his absence and signed a statement that he understood that warning and his obligations.Â  The City complied with Koontzâ€™s request for a jury trial and his request to be notified of his court dates through his attorney.Â  Koontzâ€™s case was not tried at two city court jury terms, August and September, instead being held over to the October term.Â  Koontz was given ample opportunity to defend himself at trial but he failed to appear for roll call or the trial itself, even after being notified of his trial date by his attorney.Â  He made no effort to contact the City or the court to inform them that defense counsel was no longer his attorney and that further notices should be sent to him personally or to request an extension after his attorney petitioned to be and was relieved from representation.\r\nThe municipal judge fully complied with the mandates of Rule 16, SCRCrimP.Â  The trial court correctly proceeded with a trial in Koontzâ€™s absence after making appropriate factual findings on the issue of whether Koontz had notice of the trial and whether he was warned the trial would proceed in his absence.Â  Further, Koontzâ€™s former attorney noted that Koontz had received the proper notice.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Koontzâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J. and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4095","title":"Garnett v.

Williams rented a car from Thrifty in Savannah, Georgia.Â  Williamsâ€™s rental contract indicates that she purchased optional Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI) coverage and paid a daily premium of $8.95.Â  This premium was to provide Williams with excess liability coverage against third-party claims up to a limit of $1,000,000; it was supplemental coverage for the difference between the amount under the state minimum financial responsibility law and $1,000,000.[3]Â  \r\nWhile driving the Thrifty rental car in South Carolina, Williams struck a vehicle in which Garnett was a passenger.Â  Garnett subsequently brought an action against Williams for injuries she allegedly sustained in the accident.Â Â Â  \r\nGarnett brought this declaratory judgment action against Thrifty and Philadelphia, seeking a determination of the amount of liability insurance coverage available on Williamsâ€™s rental vehicle.Â  Philadelphia contended only the minimum limits of $15,000/$30,000/$10,000 (i.e., $15,000 bodily injury per person, $30,000 bodily injury per accident, and $10,000 property damage per accident) are available to Williams.Â  Thrifty contended that, pursuant to the Dual Interest Endorsement, Williams was entitled to liability limits of $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 because the rental contract provided for limits in excess of the minimum state financial responsibility law.Â  Both Philadelphia and Thrifty moved for summary judgment.\r\nThe trial court granted Thriftyâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding the unambiguous terms of the insurance policy mandated the higher limits of coverage.Â  The court ruled the rental contract between Thrifty and Williams provided for coverage over the minimum imposed by the state financial responsibility law, thus invoking the higher coverage of $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 pursuant to the Dual Interest Endorsement in the Philadelphia policy that insured Thrifty.Â  Philadelphia appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€[4]Â  An action to construe a contract is at law.[5]Â  In an action at law, the trial court must be affirmed when there is â€œany evidenceâ€ to support the courtâ€™s findings.[6]Â  \r\nUnder the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€[7]Â  \r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€[8]Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€[9]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Philadelphia argues the trial court erred in finding it is required to provide coverage of $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 on the rental vehicle.Â  Philadelphia asserts the court erred in interpreting the clear terms of the insurance policy, in failing to consider the entire contract, and in ignoring relevant parol evidence in the event the contract is deemed ambiguous.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œUnless the parties agree to a different rule, the validity and interpretation of a contract is ordinarily to be determined by the law of the state in which the contract was made.â€[10]Â  In the case before us, the trial court found the vehicle rental was entered into in Georgia; therefore, Georgia law applies.[11]Â  \r\nâ€œUnder Georgia law, contracts of insurance are interpreted by ordinary rules of contract construction.â€[12]Â  â€œ â€˜Three well known rules . . . apply.Â  Any ambiguities in the contract are strictly construed against the insurer as drafter of the document; any exclusion from coverage sought to be invoked by the insurer is likewise strictly construed; and insurance contracts are to be read in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured where possible.â€™ â€[13]Â  â€œWhere the terms are clear and unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, the court is to look to the contract alone to ascertain the partiesâ€™ intent.â€[14]Â  \r\nPhiladelphia asserts the higher limits of coverage in the Dual Interest Endorsement are not triggered here because the rental contract â€œclearlyâ€ states that the SLI is to be provided under a â€œseparate policyâ€; therefore, excess coverage was not provided for in the rental contract itself.Â  Alternatively, Philadelphia asserts that it is undisputed that, at the time Williams executed the rental contract, Thrifty did not maintain an SLI policy with Philadelphia or any other carrier.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  The Dual Interest Endorsement provision clearly and unambiguously states that â€œ[w]hen the Insuredâ€™s rental contract provide[s] the renter with limits in excess of the minimum state financial responsibility laws,â€ the bodily injury limits are $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each accident, and the property damage limit is $50,000 per accident.Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  The rental contract in this case provides that renters who accept SLI coverage for an additional daily charge are â€œentitled toâ€ protection against third party liability claims equal to the minimum limits in Georgia, â€œand [ ] SLI provides [the renter] with a separate policy providing excess coverageâ€ up to $1,000,000.Â Â Â  \r\nWilliams accepted and paid for SLI from Thrifty; thus, Thrifty, through the rental contract, agreed to provide Williams with limits in excess of the minimum state financial responsibility law.Â  The fact that the rental contract states a separate policy is the source of the insurance does not negate the fact that the rental contract was the mechanism by which Thrifty became obligated to provide additional coverage.Â  Further, although Thrifty admits its employee was not authorized to sell SLI because Thrifty did not have a carrier for a policy at that time, this does not change our analysis.Â  Thrifty obligated itself to provide supplemental coverage, regardless of whether it was through an insurance policy or out-of-pocket.Â  Thriftyâ€™s counsel acknowledged this point at the hearing:Â  â€œ[T]here is no question but having sold [Williams] that coverage, we must provide it.Â  . . .Â  [T]he rental contract provides that sheâ€™s purchased a million dollars in single limit coverage . . . [a]nd she paid for it.Â  So there is no question but that itâ€™s there.â€Â  Thus, regardless of the source of the coverage, Thriftyâ€™s rental contract with its customer does, on its face, provide for coverage in excess of the minimum financial responsibility law.Â  This, in turn, triggers the higher coverage in the policy Thrifty carried with Philadelphia on its fleet of vehicles.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in holding Philadelphia is responsible for providing coverage on the rental vehicle of up to $100,000/$300,000/$50,000. [15] Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company is also referred to as the â€œPhiladelphia Insurance Companyâ€ in some of the trial records, but all parties state in their briefs that this is a misnomer.Â  Further, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company is the name listed on the insurance policy that is the subject of this appeal.Â  \r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  Section 10(A)(1) and (2) of Williamsâ€™s rental contract provided the following regarding SLI coverage:\r\n\r\n10.Â  OPTIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL LIABILITY INSURANCE (WHERE AVAILABLE).\r\nA.Â  Where available, and for an additional daily charge, if I have initialed that I accept the optional SLI at the beginning of the rental, I am entitled to the following:\r\n  \r\n1.Â  Thrifty will protect Me against third-party liability claims arising out of the use or operation of the Car for (i) bodily injury or death of another (excluding any of My or Additional Renterâ€™s family members related by blood or marriage or adoption residing with Me or them) and (ii) Property damage other than to the Car.Â  This protection is limited to an amount equal to the minimum limits specified by the compulsory insurance or financial responsibility laws relating to automobile liability insurance in the state in which the Car is rented and shall be referred to as Primary Protection; and,\r\n2.Â  SLI provides Me with a separate policy providing excess coverage against such claims for the difference between the Primary Protection and a maximum combined single limit of $1,000,000 (U.S.) per occurrence for bodily injury, including death and property damage, for other than the Car while the Car is on rent to Me.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n[4]Â  Felts v.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4096\r\nHeard February 8, 2006 â€“ Filed March 20, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMichael Stuart Davenport, of Wilmington, NC, and Shannon Lee Felder, of Columbia, for Appellants.Â  \r\nThomas E. Player, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Darnasai Hamin appeals a circuit court order finding Auto-Owners Insurance Company not liable to provide coverage under Haminâ€™s homeownersâ€™ insurance policy for a fire that occurred in her home.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHamin, a minor, owns a house insured by Auto-Owners.Â  Numerous family members reside in the house including Haminâ€™s mother, Melissa Stinnett, Haminâ€™s sister, Vermica Grant, two other siblings, and Haminâ€™s conservator and grandmother, Vermelle Simmons.Â  \r\nAt the time of the fire, Grant was fifteen years old.Â  A few hours before the fire, Grant returned to the house after an unexplained absence.Â  Upon her return, Stinnett and Grant argued.Â  Stinnett threatened to place Grant in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if she continued her behavior.Â  Grant replied that if she had to leave the house, she would see that â€œnobody lived in the house.â€ Â \r\nLater that night, the house was severely damaged in a fire.Â  Grant admitted she started the fire.Â  Grant stated she did so because she was upset with her mother, was jealous of her infant brother, and wanted to get her motherâ€™s attention.Â  Grant alleged she did not believe the house would ignite.Â  After its investigation, Auto-Owners concluded Grant started the fire by pouring gasoline in the basement and then lighting a piece of paper.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAuto-Owners filed this declaratory judgment action alleging the policyâ€™s intentional loss exclusion barred the claim.Â  The exclusion prevents coverage for any loss â€œcaused directly or indirectly by . . . [a]n action by or at the direction of any insured committed with the intent to cause a loss.â€ Â The policy defines insured as â€œyou, your relatives; and any other person under the age of 21 residing with you who is in your care or the care of a relative.â€Â  \r\nHamin moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, a judicial finding of coverage.Â  Hamin argued, inter alia, Grant was not an â€œinsuredâ€ under the policy because she possessed no insurable interest in the house, and the phrase â€œintent to cause a lossâ€ in the policy was ambiguous.Â  \r\nThe circuit court denied Haminâ€™s motion for summary judgment and found no coverage.Â  The court reasoned Grant was an insured and her lack of an insurable interest in the property was immaterial. Â Further, the court held the phrase â€œintent to cause a lossâ€ was not ambiguous and found Grant intended to cause a loss when she set the fire.Â  Finally, the court held a malicious mischief provision of the policy did not provide coverage.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeclaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor\r\nequitable, and therefore, the standard of review depends on the nature of the underlying issues.Â  Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 279, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  When the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage exists under an insurance policy, the action is one at law.Â  Horry County v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 344 S.C. 493, 497, 544 S.E.2d 637, 639-640 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are found to be without evidence that reasonably supports those findings.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Insurable Interest\r\nHamin contends Grant was not an insured under the policy because Grant had no insurable interest in the house.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe policy defines an â€œinsuredâ€ as â€œyou, your relatives; and any other person under the age of 21 residing with you who is in your care or the care of a relative.â€Â  Under the plain terms of the policy, Grant was an insured as she is Haminâ€™s relative and a resident of the household.Â  In South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. v. Kelly, this court found the policy definition of â€œinsuredâ€ rendered the issue of whether the adult son had an insurable interest immaterial because the adult son was a relative and lived in the house, and thus was an insured under the policy.Â  345 S.C. 232, 240, 547 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We likewise find the issue of whether Grant possessed an insurable interest immaterial because Grant is an insured under the terms of the policy.Â  See Pennell v. Foster, 338 S.C. 9, 18, 524 S.E.2d 630, 634 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating the terms of the policy govern the scope of the coverage, unless in conflict with statutory requirements). \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Ambiguity in the Intentional Loss Exclusion\r\nHamin also argues the phrase â€œintent to cause a lossâ€ in the intentional loss exclusion of the policy is ambiguous.Â  Again applying Kelly, we find no ambiguity.[1]Â  \r\nIn Kelly, the insurer initiated an action to recover money for two claims previously paid to the insured after the insuredâ€™s adult son confessed to starting the fires.Â  Kelly, 345 at 235-36, 547 S.E.2d at 873.Â  The intentional acts exclusion in Kelly mirrored the exclusion in this case, providing the insurer does â€œnot insure for loss caused directly or indirectly . . . out of any act committed by any insured with the intent to cause a loss.â€Â  Id. at 241, 547 S.E.2d at 876.Â  The Kelly court held the language clear and unambiguous.Â  Id.Â  We likewise find no ambiguity.[2]\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Capacity to Form IntentÂ  \r\nHamin next argues Grant did not have the mental or legal capacity to form the intent to cause a loss.Â  This argument was not ruled upon by the circuit court and, therefore, is not preserved for appeal.Â  See Harris v. Bennett, 332 S.C. 238, 245, 503 S.E.2d 782, 786&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998) (stating an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Public Policy\r\nLastly, Hamin contends public policy considerations prevent enforcement of the intentional loss exclusion.Â  This issue, having not been ruled upon by the circuit court, is not preserved.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because we find the exclusion unambiguous, we find no merit to Haminâ€™s argument that we must apply the malicious mischief provision to interpret the meaning of the exclusion.Â  See Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v. Litchfield, 313 S.C. 471, 474, 438 S.E.2d 275, 277 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œWhile a policy should be liberally construed in favor of coverage and against exclusion, courts are not permitted to torture the ordinary meaning of language to extend coverage expressly excluded by the terms of the policy.â€).\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We need not apply the Miller two-prong test of intent because the circuit court never explicitly ruled on the second prong of the test, and the parties neither argued the Miller test in their briefs nor raised the issue on appeal until their reply argument before this court.Â  See Miller v. Fidelity-Phoenix Ins. Co., 268 S.C. 72, 75, 231 S.E.2d 701, 702 (1977) (explaining the two prongs of the test as:Â  1) whether the act causing the loss was intentional, and 2) whether the result of the act was intended).Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Hunter v. Staples, 335 S.C. 93, 103, 515 S.E.2d 261, 267 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review); Continental Ins. Co. v. Shives, 328 S.C. 470, 474, 492 S.E.2d 808, 811 (Ct.

Coffee, of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\nJeffrey Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  A jury rendered a $688,503 verdict for Doug Proctor d/b/a Anderson Tire Recycling (Proctor) against the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).Â  The circuit judge reduced the award to $300,000 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1).Â  DHEC contends Proctor failed to prove gross negligence; the trial court incorrectly charged the jury; and the damages awarded were so unduly liberal or grossly excessive as to require a new trial.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nProctor owns and operates a waste tire processing and disposal facility in Anderson County, South Carolina.Â  South Carolina law endows DHEC with the authority to issue permits to waste tire facilities.Â  In 1993, when DHEC became involved in the regulation of waste tires, Proctor timely applied for all required permits.Â  Proctor became a permitted facility for both waste tire processing and waste tire disposal.Â  \r\nThe business of waste tire disposal turns on the availability of a per-tire rebate allowed by the South Carolina Department of Revenue.Â  Section 44-96-170(N) requires sellers of new tires to pay a two-dollar fee to the Department of Transportation for every new tire sold.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-170(N) (2005).Â  However, section 44-96-170(O) provides, â€œA wholesaler or retailer required to submit a fee pursuant to subsection (N) who delivers or arranges delivery of waste tires to a permitted or approved waste tire recycling facility . . . may apply for a refund of one dollar for each tire delivered.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-170(O) (2005).Â  A tire retailer is entitled to a one-dollar rebate per tire for each used tire delivered to a permitted waste tire facility.Â  Hence, the rebate essentially pays for the new-tire dealerâ€™s disposal of waste tires as the dealer pays a dollar to a waste tire disposal facility and gets back a dollar via the rebate.\r\nDHEC maintains a list of approved waste tire recycling facilities.Â  DHEC forwards the list to the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Revenue provides the rebate.Â Â  The Director of Solid Waste Management, and later the Director of Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling with the Bureau of Land and Waste Management, William Culler, compiled the rebate list.Â  \r\nIn 1998, DHEC found Proctor in violation of his permit and DHEC regulations.Â  DHEC initiated an enforcement action, levied a fine against Proctor, and removed him from the rebate list.Â  The case was eventually heard by this Court and resulted in an unpublished opinion.Â  The underlying facts of the instant action are described in our prior opinion:Â  \r\n\r\nDHEC deferred enforcement action based on Proctorâ€™s commitment to build sheds where used tires for sale to the public could be separately stored.Â  However, only one shed was constructed, and site conditions did not improve.Â  \r\nIn September 1998, DHEC issued an administrative order to Proctor to take corrective action at the site and pay a civil penalty of $51,330.Â  The order cited Proctor for numerous violations relating to storage of waste tires and removed Proctor from DHECâ€™s Waste Tire Facility Rebate List. . . . \r\nProctor appealed the order to the Administrative Law Judge Division.Â  The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) upheld $8,200 of the penalty and ordered Proctor to close out the on-site drain field, clean and maintain fire access lanes, and cease commingling waste and used tires.Â  The ALJ also ordered that Proctor be reinstated to the Waste Tire Rebate List.Â  Both Proctor and DHEC appealed to the DHEC Board.Â  The Board made its own findings of fact that the site exceeded the 1,500 tires allowed.Â  Based on its factual findings, it partially reversed the ALJ, removed Proctor from the Waste Tire Rebate List until he complied with his permit and the regulations, and increased the civil penalty by $500 to $8,700. Â Proctor appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n\r\nDoug Proctor d/b/a Anderson Tire Recycling v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 2003-UP-472 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 24, 2003).Â  We reversed the Boardâ€™s increase of the fine and removal of Proctor from the rebate list:\r\n\r\nProctor also argues the Board erred in reversing the ALJâ€™s order by increasing the fine where it was supported by substantial evidence.Â  In a related argument, he contends the Board erred in overturning the ALJâ€™s decision that he should remain on DHECâ€™s Waste Tire Rebate List.Â  We agree and reverse those portions of the Boardâ€™s order.\r\nUnder South Carolina Code Annotated Â§ 44-96-170(O) (2002), any retailer that sells new tires and delivers collected waste tires to a permitted facility is entitled to a refund of one dollar per waste tire delivered.Â  If a tire retailer does not deliver its waste tires to a licensed waste tire facility, it is not eligible to claim the refund.Â Â  Although DHECâ€™s administrative order took Proctor off the rebate list, the ALJ ordered that Proctor be restored to the list.Â  The Board then ordered Proctorâ€™s facility to be removed from the list until Proctor demonstrated â€œfull compliance with this Order, his permits, and applicable law and regulation.â€Â  The Board erred in doing so.\r\nThe ALJ found Proctor violated waste tire laws, but also found DHEC did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that he exceeded his storage limits or that he was indifferent to regulatory requirements.Â  As substantial evidence supports the ALJâ€™s decision to restore Proctor to the rebate list and supports the fine imposed, the Board erred in reversing the ALJ.Â  Further, section 44-96-170(O), which sets forth the rebate system, indicates that as long as a wholesaler or retailer delivers waste tires to a permitted or approved waste tire recycling facility, he may apply for the refund.Â  All permitted facilities are thus on the rebate list.Â  There is no authority for the ALJ, or any other entity, to remove a licensed business from the list; only by revoking or suspending its license can an entity be removed from the list.Â  As a licensed entity, Proctor is entitled to remain on the Waste Tire Rebate List.Â  \r\n\r\nProctor, 2003-UP-472 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 24, 2003).Â  \r\nProctor subsequently was restored to the rebate list.Â  Proctor initiated this action, maintaining DHEC was grossly negligent under section 15-78-60(12) of the South Carolina Code by keeping his facility off of the rebate list from 2000 until after this Courtâ€™s decision in 2003.Â  DHEC moved for a directed verdict on the ground Proctor failed to establish DHEC exercised a power or function in a grossly negligent manner.Â  The trial court denied the directed verdict motion, and the jury awarded actual damages to Proctor in the amount of $688,503.Â  Pursuant to Section 15-78-120(a)(1) of the South Carolina Code, the award was reduced to the statutory maximum of $300,000.Â  DHEC moved for a judgment not withstanding the verdict (JNOV), or, in the alterative, a new trial or new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial court denied these motions.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Tort Claims Act\r\nA.Â  Waiver of Immunity\r\nâ€œThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available in an action against a governmental entity or its employees.â€Â  Parker v. Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer Dist., 362 S.C. 276, 280, 607 S.E.2d 711, 714 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 584 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 2003); Wells v.

App. 2004).Â  â€œNotwithstanding any provision of law, this chapter, the â€˜South Carolina Tort Claims Actâ€™, is the exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity while acting within the scope of the employeeâ€™s official duty.â€Â  S.C.

Code Ann. section 44-96-170(O) (2002), any retailer that sells new tires and delivers waste tires to a permitted facility is entitled to a one-dollar rebate for every waste tire delivered.Â  All permitted waste tire facilities are thus on the rebate list.Â  As held in our prior unpublished opinion, DHEC erroneously removed Proctor from the rebate list.Â  Further, DHEC violated 25 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-72.205(A) (Supp. 2005), which provides, â€œA petition for review of an order stays the order.â€Â  DHEC did not stay its decision to remove Proctor from the rebate list even though he filed an appeal.\r\nAt trial, Proctor questioned former DHEC employee, George Tomlin, on the protocol for inspecting his tire disposal facility:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n        Okay.Â  Mr. Tomlin, are you familiar with the inspection procedures that DHEC does, in other words, the frequency, how often they do an inspection?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Yes, Iâ€™m familiar with it.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         In the solid waste section, I believe, is where Mr. Simpson worked; is that correct?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         That is correct.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         And Mr. Simpson was the person while you were there who inspected Anderson Tire Recyclingâ€™s facility; is that correct?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.Â  Did you know if heâ€”was he required to make inspections?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Yes, he was.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.Â  Was there a policy that he make inspections periodically?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         It was a policy for him to follow the requirements of the program to make inspections on a monthly basis.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDHECâ€™s policy was to inspect facilities on a monthly basis.Â  However, once DHEC removed Proctor from the list, it refused to inspect his facility, even though a favorable inspection was a prerequisite to his being restored to the list.Â  DHEC did not inspect Proctorâ€™s facility for over four years, despite his requests for an inspection.Â  DHEC employee Arthur Braswell could not explain the entityâ€™s failure to inspect:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       . . . . Whatâ€™s the purpose of not coming to the facility for four years and four months?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       I canâ€™t answer that.Â  I donâ€™t know why our inspections werenâ€™t done.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Who would be to blame for not doing these inspections?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Well, not to blame, but our districts are responsible for doing inspections at facilities.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, DHEC argues that Proctor would not have been put back on the list even if he had obtained a clear inspection because he had not paid the fine.Â  The evidence at trial suggests otherwise.Â  Proctor questioned Arthur Braswell on this very point:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       When Mr. Shissias told you to go to the facility and check it out, did he tell you to discuss that Mr. Proctor should pay the fine before he could get back on the list?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       No.Â  Heâ€”he discussed exactly what I told you during the meeting, or our inspection, that if you were in compliance, there was a good chance you would be put back on the list that week\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       So the supervisors . . . were the ones that were more concerned about getting the money, is that correct, than the compliance?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      . . . .\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       The money wasnâ€™tâ€”they were willing to let the money go in order for some additional conditions at the site to improve the compliance of the facility.Â  We discussed those issues during my inspection with you on April 10th, just as ideas of what would make the site better.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       But they werenâ€™t your conditions that you related to Mr. Proctor to be able to go back on the rebate list.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       They were not stated as conditions during the inspection; they were in that letter that was sent to you.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nProctor remained a permitted facility, yet DHEC did not perform an inspection, as it was its policy to do.Â  Further, DHEC ignored Proctorâ€™s requests for an inspection.Â  Proctor could not return to the rebate list without an inspection, and DHEC, without explanation, refused to give him an inspection for over four years.Â  \r\nThere is sufficient evidence to support the juryâ€™s finding of intentional, conscious failure by DHEC to do that which it ought to have done.Â  The record supports the trial courtâ€™s denial of DHECâ€™s motions for a directed verdict, JNOV, and a new trial.Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Section 15-78-60(1)-(5); (13) (2005)\r\nA.Â  Exceptions to the Waiver of Immunity\r\nDHEC contends the trial court erred in denying its motion in limine and motion for a directed verdict regarding charging the jury on subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (13) of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (2005).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe exceptions DHEC claims provide:Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n(1)Â  legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction;\r\n(2)Â  administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial nature; \r\n(3)Â  execution, enforcement, or implementation of the orders of any court or execution, enforcement, or lawful implementation of any process;\r\n(4)Â  adoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, or written policies;\r\n(5)Â  the exercise of discretion or judgment by the governmental entity or employee of the performance or failure to perform any act or service which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental entity or employee;\r\n. . . \r\n(13)Â  regulatory inspection powers or functions, including failure to make an inspection, or making an inadequate or negligent inspection, of any property to determine whether the property complies with or violates any law, regulation, code or ordinance or contains a hazard to health or safety[.]\r\n\r\nS.C.

App. 2004), addressed the exception found in subsection (1) of section 15-78-60.Â  Louie Hawkins sued the city of Greenville for improper and negligent design and maintenance of its municipal drainage system.Â  Hawkins alleged the Cityâ€™s malfeasance caused his property to flood.Â  This Court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City.Â  We noted that among other applicable exceptions to the waiver of immunity, â€œthe City [wa]s not liable for loss resulting from: â€˜legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction[.]â€™â€Â  Id. at 293, 594 S.E.2d at 564.Â  We instructed:\r\n\r\nFor each of these specific provisions, the determination of immunity from tort liability turns on the question of whether the acts in question were discretionary rather than ministerial. A finding of immunity under the Act â€œis contingent on proof the government entity, faced with alternatives, actually weighed competing considerations and made a conscious choice using accepted professional standards.â€Â  Wooten ex rel. Wooten v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999).Â Â  â€œThe governmental entity bears the burden of establishing discretionary immunity as an affirmative defense.â€Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 428, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002).\r\nAlthough our courts have not applied the Tort Claims Act to facts similar to those of the present case, the Supreme Court of Texas has held that municipalities are not liable for the design and planning of their sewage and drainage systems because these acts are considered quasi-judicial, discretionary functions for which a government entity is not liable.Â  City of Tyler v. Likes, 962 S.W.2d 489, 501 (Tex. 1997).Â  The court in City of Tyler opined: \r\n  \r\n The duties of the municipal authorities in adopting a general plan of drainage, and determining when and where sewers shall be built, of what size and at what level, are of a quasi judicial nature, involving the exercise of deliberate judgment and large discretion, and depending upon considerations affecting the public health and general convenience throughout an extensive territory; and the exercise of such judgment and discretion in the selection and adoption of a general plan or system of drainage is not subject to revision by a court or jury in a private action for not sufficiently draining a particular lot of land. \r\n  \r\n\r\n    Id.Â  We find a comparable degree of discretion was granted to the City in the present case to exercise the measured policy judgments required to build and maintain an adequate municipal sewer and drainage system in Greenville.Â  Accordingly, the City is immune from liability for negligence claims arising out of the design and maintenance of the drainage system in the Laurel Creek Basin.\r\n\r\nHawkins, 358 S.C. at 293-94, 594 S.E.2d at 564.\r\n Faile v.

Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 566 S.E.2d 536 (2002), involved a suit against the Department of Juvenile Justice by the parents of Brandon Faile, a nine-year-old boy who was attacked by a twelve-year-old named Fredrico.Â  Fredrico had a substantial record with DJJ, and had recently been put on probation with a one year suspended commitment to DJJ.Â  The Department removed Fredrico from his parentsâ€™ home and placed him in a therapeutic foster home.Â  This arrangement was short-lived, however, as Fredrico was expelled from the foster home after threatening his foster mother with a gun he had stolen from a school police officer.Â  Fredricoâ€™s DJJ probation counselor, Dorsey, returned Fredrico to the care of his biological mother, claiming no alternative placement was available.Â  \r\nDorsey then filed a Rule to Show Cause with the family court to show why Fredricoâ€™s probation should not be revoked, and Dorsey informed the judge that he would recommend Fredrico be committed to DJJ.Â  Dorsey did not tell the judge that Fredricoâ€™s current placement with his mother was in violation of a prior order.Â  The judge scheduled a hearing, but Fredrico assaulted Faile before the court heard the matter.Â  \r\nFaileâ€™s parents maintained the Department was grossly negligent in placing Fredrico back in his family home.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment for the Department, ruling it was immune from suit under section 15-78-60(1).Â  This Court reversed, finding a question of fact whether the trial judge ratified Dorseyâ€™s administrative act of placing Fredrico with his biological mother.Â  The supreme court affirmed, edifying:\r\n\r\nThe issue of whether juvenile probation officers are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity under the Tort Claims Act is one of first impression in South Carolina.Â  Section 15-78-60(1) provides: â€œ[t]he governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from: legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction.â€Â  In addition to the judicial immunity under the Tort Claims Act, common law judicial immunity was expressly preserved in South Carolina under the Tort Claims Act.Â  Oâ€™Laughlin v. Windham, 330 S.C. 379, 498 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied 1999 Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at p. iv.\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes three exceptions to judicial or quasi-judicial immunity. Judges and other officials are not entitled to judicial immunity if: (1) they did not have jurisdiction to act; (2) the act did not serve a judicial function; or (3) the suit is for prospective, injunctive relief only.Â  Id. at 385, 498 S.E.2d at 692.Â  The second exception, which emphasizes the importance of the act, as opposed to the actor, is relevant here.Â  Under the second exception, even judges are not insulated by judicial immunity when they act in an administrative capacity.Â  Id. (citing Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988)).Â  In determining whether an act is judicial, the Court looks to the nature and function of the act.Â  Id.; Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978).\r\nTherefore, we must determine whether probation officer Dorseyâ€™s placement of Fredrico had the nature and function of a judicial act, thereby entitling him, and thus DJJ, to quasi-judicial immunity.\r\nMuch of the analysis of judicial immunity has been made in the federal arena.Â  Several federal circuits have granted probation officers quasi-judicial immunity, but only when carrying out certain functions the courts have deemed to be judicial.Â  The Tenth Circuit has held that federal probation officers are absolutely immune when the action challenged is â€œintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.â€Â  Tripati v. United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., 784 F.2d 345 (10th Cir. 1986) (finding probation officer immune for damages resulting from reporting plaintiffâ€™s conviction to immigration authorities).Â  The Tenth Circuit has made clear the immunity arises from protected functions, not from protected individuals.Â  Mee v. Ortega, 967 F.2d 423 (10th Cir. 1992); Forrester, supra.Â  The key element is whether the officer was engaged in adjudicatory duties when the challenged act occurred. Harper v. Jeffries, 808 F.2d 281 (3d Cir. 1986).\r\n\r\nOther federal circuit courts have granted probation officers absolute immunity in preparing pre-sentencing reports, and in other situations when they act â€œas an arm of the court.â€Â  Gant v. United States Probation Office, 994 F.Supp. 729, 733 (S.D. W.Va. 1998) (citations omitted).Â  Many of these courts, however, find no absolute immunity for the same type of officer when the officer is acting in his executive capacity.Â  Gant, supra; Ray v. Pickett, 734 F.2d 370 (8th Cir. 1984); Ortega, supra; see also Harper v. Jeffries, 808 F.2d 281 (3d Cir. 1986) (denying absolute immunity of probation officer for charging appellant and presenting evidence against him at a parole hearing, because those were his duties as a parole officer).\r\n\r\n If the individual is acting pursuant to a direct court order, courts are more likely to grant quasi-judicial immunity for that action.Â  In Babcock v. Tyler, 884 F.2d 497 (9th Cir. 1989), a father sued the state for the actions of two social workers who placed his daughters in a home where they were sexually abused.Â  The social workers placed the girls temporarily in the abusive home in April 1982.Â  Id. at 449.Â  The juvenile court confirmed the placement by order in May 1982.Â  The sexual abuse did not occur until sometime after May.Â  Id.Â  Plaintiffs argued the social workers were not entitled to immunity for the temporary placement of the girls before the court order was issued. The court discounted this argument as irrelevant, however, on the grounds the abuse did not occur until after the court had confirmed the placement.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n Respondents argue the courtâ€™s confirmation of the placement was essential to the courtâ€™s finding of judicial immunity in Babcock.Â  Conversely, DJJ cites Babcock as holding that placement is a judicial act even if not made pursuant to a direct court order.Â  DJJâ€™s argument, however, overlooks that the judge formally confirmed the placement before the injury took place.Â  In the present case, Judge Barrineauâ€™s mere knowledge that Fredrico was placed in his familyâ€™s home, in the absence of any further act by him, does not amount to confirmation or ratification of Dorseyâ€™s act.\r\n\r\n Viewing the facts and all inferences that can be drawn in the light most favorable to Respondents, as the non-moving party, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to DJJ on this ground.Â  We agree with our Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that the placement of juveniles by a probation counselor is an administrative function.Â  We find persuasive the precedent discussed above from other jurisdictions which supports this analysis.Â  Just as police officers are not granted absolute immunity when they apply for arrest warrants, probation officers generally are not immune in performing their enforcement duties.Â  See Gant, supra; Acevedo v. Pima County Adult Prob. Depâ€™t, 142 Ariz. 319, 690 P.2d 38 (1984) (holding that supervision of probationers is an administrative task, unconnected with the performance of a judicial function).Â  Dorseyâ€™s placement of Fredrico was administrative.Â  The Family Courtâ€™s mere knowledge that Dorsey placed Fredrico with his family, without more, is insufficient to convert that placement into a judicial act.\r\n\r\n For the forgoing reasons, we conclude DJJ is not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity.\r\n\r\nFaile, 350 S.C. at 324-27, 566 S.E.2d at 540-42 (footnotes omitted).\r\n Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2001), construed subsections (1) and (2) of section 15-78-60 in the context of a suit against a solicitor and the Attorney General of South Carolina.Â  The Williams court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of the case, in part, pursuant to subsections (1) and (2):\r\n\r\n  In 1985, our Supreme Court decided McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741.Â  This case is significant because the Court largely abolished the doctrine of sovereign immunity.Â  Certain exceptions to this holding, however, were carved\r\n  out: \r\n  \r\n\r\n  [T]he abrogation of the rule will not extend to legislative, judicial and executive acts by individuals acting in their official capacity. These discretionary activities cannot be controlled by threat of tort liability by members of the public who take issue with the decisions made by public officials. We expressly decline to allow tort liability for these discretionary acts. The exercise of discretion includes the right to be wrong. \r\n  \r\n\r\n    Id. at 246, 329 S.E.2d at 742.\r\n\r\n When the General Assembly enacted the Tort Claims Act, it codified the McCall exceptions.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78- 60(1)(2) (Supp. 2000) (stating â€œThe governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from (1) legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction; and (2) administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial natureâ€).\r\n\r\nWilliams, 347 S.C. at 248-49, 553 S.E.2d at 508.\r\nWe determined that the â€œduties of a prosecutor fall into the exceptions enumerated by McCall and Â§ 15-78-60.â€Â  Id. at 249, 553 S.E.2d at 508.\r\n\r\nThe case law cited throughout this opinion clearly supports the proposition that a prosecutorâ€™s typical duties are â€œjudicialâ€ or â€œquasi-judicialâ€ in nature.Â  Accordingly, this Court finds a prosecutor, in his official capacity, is immune from a Tort Claims Act suit involving â€œjudicialâ€ or â€œquasi-judicialâ€ acts, provided a defendant prosecutor raises the affirmative defense of sovereign immunity in his return.Â  See Tanner v. Florence City-County Bldg. Commâ€™n, 333 S.C. 549, 511 S.E.2d 369 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding sovereign immunity is an affirmative defense that must be pled).\r\n\r\nWilliams, 347 S.C. at 249, 553 S.E.2d at 508.\r\nÂ  Wortman v. Spartanburg, 310 S.C. 1, 425 S.E.2d 18 (1992), analyzed subsections (3) and (4) of section 15-78-60.Â  Police arrested Wortman for possession of out-of-state lottery tickets, but the arresting officer dismissed the charges on the day of trial.Â  Wortman sued the City claiming his arrest was unlawful because possession of lottery tickets was not illegal.Â Â  The City obtained summary judgment, in part, on the trial judgeâ€™s finding section 15-78-60(3) and (4) exempted the City from liability.Â  The supreme court reversed, holding the City was not entitled to summary judgment under the claimed exceptions:\r\n\r\nThe facts in the record establish that Wortman was arrested before the City obtained a warrant from a magistrate.Â  Thus, the actions of the police did not occur during the execution or enforcement of the order of any court or during the lawful implementation of any process, as contemplated by section 15-78-60(3).Â  As to section 15-78-60(4), the City cannot claim that Wortmanâ€™s arrest for possession of lottery tickets resulted from its attempt to enforce a law absent a showing that a law exists that prohibits the possession of lottery tickets.\r\n\r\n We conclude that the actions of the City do not fall within the exception provisions of sections 15-78-60(3) and (4). Consequently, we hold that the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment on the ground that the City was immune from liability under the Tort Claims Act.\r\n\r\nWortman, 310 S.C. at 3-4, 425 S.E.2d at 20.\r\nAt issue in Adkins v. Varn, 312 S.C. 188, 439 S.E.2d 822 (1993), was whether section 15-78-60(4) provided immunity to Greenville County for its failure to enforce an ordinance.Â  The case arose when several vicious dogs chased a young girl on a bicycle into a street.Â  The girl was struck and killed by an automobile as she attempted to flee from the dogs.Â  Local residents had complained about the dogs to county animal control, and one neighbor had called the County at least five times just prior to the accident.Â  The trial court dismissed the action, finding the County was immune from liability for failure to enforce an ordinance.Â  The supreme court agreed:\r\n\r\n  The present facts establish that the County had notice that several vicious dogs were at large in the neighborhood.Â  The facts also show that the County, for whatever reason, did not enforce the ordinance on these particular animals.Â  It is undisputed that the County is a governmental entity within the meaning of the South Carolina Torts Claim Act, and therefore, is subject to the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-60(4).\r\n The provisions of Section 15-78-60(4) are clear and unambiguous on their face, and are not subject to judicial interpretation. The statute clearly exempts from liability any loss resulting from the failure to enforce an ordinance; therefore, the County is immune from suit for any loss as a result of their non-enforcement of the animal control ordinance.\r\n\r\nAdkins, 312 S.C. at 191-92, 439 S.E.2d at 824.\r\nIn Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Public Safety, 353 S.C. 291, 578 S.E.2d 16 (Ct. App. 2002), Amy Clark was killed when Charles Johnson crossed the centerline and hit her head-on.Â  Police were chasing Johnson when the accident occurred.Â  Trooper Lonnie Plyler was the supervisor at the time of the chase, but did not monitor the pursuit because he was administering a breathalyzer examination.Â  Clarkâ€™s father sued the Department and Johnson, and a jury returned a verdict of $3.75 million in damages against them.Â  The Departmentâ€™s $750,000 share of the damages was reduced to $250,000â€”the statutory maximum in place at the time.Â  At some point the jury submitted a note, which read: â€œThe Vehicle [and] Foot Pursuit Policy of SCDPS [the Department] dictates supervision of all pursuits.Â  During this pursuit no supervisors were present or notified until after the pursuit was ended.Â  It is our decision that this designates gross neglect on the behalf of SCDPS.â€Â  Id. at 298, 578 S.E.2d at 19-20.Â  Among its arguments on appeal, the Department contended â€œit was entitled to absolute immunity as a matter of law under section 15-78-60(4) of the Tort Claims Act.â€Â  Id. at 306, 578 S.E.2d at 24.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, the Department adopted the South Carolina Department of Public Safety Policy Directive, Vehicle and Foot Pursuit Policy, which addresses the duties of troopers and their supervisors.Â  The Pursuit Policy requires a supervisor to monitor all pursuits and states in relevant part: â€œThe supervisor will continuously evaluate pursuit and will order termination of the pursuit when it appears to constitute an unreasonable risk.â€\r\nCiting section 15-78-60(4), the Department asserts it is immune from liability for failing to enforce any written policy, in this case, the Pursuit Policyâ€™s guideline that a supervisor monitor all pursuits.\r\nIn denying the Departmentâ€™s directed verdict motion at the end of the plaintiffâ€™s case, the trial court found the Department was not entitled to absolute immunity under section 15-78-60(4) for the failure to enforce any law or written policy, stating, â€œI donâ€™t think it was a policy violation.Â  I think it was a violation of the standard of care that they are supposed to provide to the public.â€\r\nWe hold the trial court properly refused to grant the Department judgment as a matter of law because the actions of the Department do not fall within the parameters of section 15-78-60(4).Â  As noted by Clark, the Pursuit Policy was merely a statement of generally accepted law enforcement guidelines.Â  This broad provision is not the kind of written policy that should be afforded the protection of absolute immunity under the Tort Claims Act. \r\n\r\nClark, 353 S.C. at 307, 578 S.E.2d at 24 (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\nIn addition, the Department claimed discretionary immunity under section 15-78-60(5).Â  The court disagreed:\r\n\r\nClark presented the testimony of his expert in high-speed chases, Samuel Killman, that the Departmentâ€™s employees did not properly balance the competing considerations of capturing a fleeing suspect versus maintaining the publicâ€™s safety and that they disregarded appropriate standards in failing to terminate the pursuit.Â  The Department attempted to rebut this evidence with Bradleyâ€™s testimony that he did weigh these competing concerns.Â  This created a question of fact that could not be resolved by the trial court.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court properly denied the Departmentâ€™s motions for judgment as a matter of law on the ground of discretionary immunity.\r\n Moreover, we question whether the discretionary immunity provision is applicable to this case in any event.Â  Some jurisdictions determine whether an act is discretionary by considering if it can best be described as planning or operational.Â  In this case, we believe the function of the Departmentâ€™s employees in carrying out a general pursuit policy is operational in nature and is not the type of discretionary act contemplated in the Tort Claims Act.Â  The fact that the employees had to make decisions or exercise some judgment in their activities is not determinative.Â  To read the exception that broadly would encompass virtually all traffic stops made by the Departmentâ€™s employees, as they all involve some degree of decision-making, but they are not the type of discretionary act envisioned under the Tort Claims Act. \r\n\r\nClark, 353 S.C. at 305-06, 578 S.E.2d at 23 (footnotes omitted).\r\nJackson v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 301 S.C. 125, 390 S.E.2d (Ct. App. 1989), affâ€™d, 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d 377 (1990), was a suit against the Department of Corrections for the wrongful death of inmate Stroman Jackson.Â  Jackson was killed by another inmate, Wilson Atkinson.Â  Atkinson had an extensive history of attacking inmates and officers and had killed an inmate on a prior occasion.Â  A jury returned a verdict for Jackson, but the trial court granted the Departmentâ€™s JNOV.Â  The Department claimed immunity under section 15-78-60(5) for what it claimed was â€œthe exercise of discretion or judgmentâ€ in its decision to move Atkinson from a maximum-security facility to the facility where Jackson was killed.Â  We reversed the JNOV and remanded for the entry of the juryâ€™s verdict:\r\n\r\nWhile Atkinsonâ€™s transfer was admittedly an act requiring the discretion and judgment of the Department, Section 15-78-60(25) provides an exception to immunity where the governmental entity exercises its responsibility or duty in a grossly negligent manner.Â  Section 15-78-60(5) must be read in light of this exception.Â  If discretion is exercised in a grossly negligent manner, the exception to the normal rule of immunity applies.\r\n\r\n301 S.C. at 128, 390 S.E.2d at 468.\r\nIn Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 566 S.E.2d 536 (2002), after ruling the Department was not immune from liability under section 15-78-60(1), the court turned to the Departmentâ€™s claim of discretionary immunity under section 15-78-60(5).Â  The court concluded DJJ was not entitled to immunity under that provision:\r\n\r\nA governmental entity is not liable for losses resulting from an exercise of discretion by its employees.Â  Section 15-78-60(5) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act exempts governmental entities from liability for losses resulting from â€œthe exercise of discretion or judgment by the governmental entity or employee or the performance or failure to perform any act or service which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental entity or employee.â€Â  Discretionary immunity is an affirmative defense requiring DJJ to prove Dorsey evaluated competing alternatives and made a â€œjudgmentâ€ call based on applicable professional standards.Â  Foster v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 306 S.C. 519, 413 S.E.2d 31 (1992).\r\n\r\n In determining whether Dorseyâ€™s action was discretionary, it is helpful to compare the two classifications for the duties of public officials.Â  The duties of public officials are generally classified as either ministerial or discretionary.Â  Jensen v. Anderson County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (1991).Â  â€œThe duty is ministerial when it is absolute, certain, and imperative, involving merely execution of a specific duty arising from fixed and designated facts.â€Â  Id. at 203, 403 S.E.2d at 619.Â  The duty is discretionary if the governmental entity proves it actually weighed competing considerations, faced with alternatives, and made a conscious decision based upon those considerations.Â  Id. (citing Niver v. Depâ€™t Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 302 S.C. 461, 395 S.E.2d 728 (Ct. App. 1990)).\r\nIn Jensen, this Court affirmed the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that insufficient evidence was submitted to determine whether the Department of Social Services (â€œDSSâ€) made a discretionary decision.Â  Id.Â  In the case, a teacher reported a potential child abuse case to DSS.Â  A DSS social worker interviewed the child, and noted the presence of bruises and the childâ€™s fear of the motherâ€™s boyfriend.Â  However, the social worker failed to follow up on the interview and eventually closed the file.Â  One month later, the childâ€™s brother was beaten to death in the home.Â  The Court held that DSS had a duty to conduct a thorough investigation before deciding to close the file.Â  The Court concluded that conducting the investigation was ministerial but closing the file was discretionary because it required applying facts discovered through investigation to reach a decision.Â  Id.Â  Despite the fact that closing the file is discretionary, the Court held that there was insufficient evidence to grant discretionary immunity, because the decision was due to failure to complete the investigation, an administrative function, rather than a weighing of competing considerations.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n In the present case, DJJ claims Dorseyâ€™s decision to place Fredrico in his home after he was expelled from his foster home was a discretionary decision.Â  Respondents claim Dorsey placed Fredrico in his family home because he thought no one else would take him.Â  However, Respondents argue there was alternative placement available in the Greenville Group Home, which had agreed earlier to take Fredrico in an emergency.Â  Therefore, Respondents claim if Dorsey had weighed competing alternatives, he would have placed Fredrico in the Greenville Group home.Â  Based on our holding in Jensen and the evidence before us, DJJ is not entitled to discretionary immunity.\r\n\r\n In addition, even if we held Dorsey exercised discretion, the performance of discretionary duties does not give rise to immunity if the public official acted in a grossly negligent manner.Â  See Jackson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 301 S.C. 125, 390 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 1989) affâ€™d, 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d 377 (1990). â€œGross negligence is the intentional, conscious failure to do something which is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.â€Â  Richardson v. Hambright, 296 S.C. 504, 506, 374 S.E.2d 296, 298 (1988).Â  It is the failure to exercise even the slightest care.Â  Hollins v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 310 S.C. 486, 427 S.E.2d 654 (1993).Â  This Court has also defined it as a relative term that â€œmeans the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.â€Â  Hicks v. McCandlish, 221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1952).\r\nGross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question of law and fact.Â  See Clyburn v. Sumter County School District # 17, 317 S.C. 50, 451 S.E.2d 885 (1994).Â  When the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, it is solely a question of law for the court, otherwise it is an issue best resolved by the jury.Â  Id.Â  In most cases, gross negligence is a factually controlled concept whose determination best rests with the jury.\r\nIn Jackson, supra, a jury found the Department of Corrections grossly negligent for placing a prisoner with strong violent tendencies into a minimum security prison, where he killed a fellow inmate.Â  The Court of Appeals found the Department of Corrections transferred the inmate even though they knew he had multiple disciplinary violations, including the killing of a fellow inmate.Â  The Court of Appeals held the jury could view the transfer as gross negligence since it demonstrated a â€œconscious indifference to the threat posed to the safety of other inmates.â€Â  Jackson, 301 S.C. at 125, 390 S.E.2d at 468.\r\n\r\n In the instant case, Dorsey placed Fredrico into a home where DJJ workers noted there was no proper supervision.Â  Furthermore, Dorsey knew of Fredricoâ€™s violent tendencies.Â  He even wrote before the incident that he â€œwouldnâ€™t give (Fredrico) two weeks with his mother before he would get into big trouble.â€\r\nBased on the facts before us, DJJ is not entitled to discretionary immunity as a matter of law.Â  At a minimum, Faile has presented enough evidence to overcome DJJâ€™s summary judgment motion on the matter.\r\n\r\nFaile, 350 S.C. at 330-32, 566 S.E.2d at 544-45.\r\nB.Â  Denial of Motion In Limine and Request to Charge\r\nâ€œWhen instructing the jury, the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€Â  Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThe substance of the law is what must be instructed to the jury, not any particular verbiage . . . . A jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.â€Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 391, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  â€œTo warrant reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have not only been erroneous, but prejudicial as well.â€Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289; see also Daves, 355 S.C. at 224, 584 S.E.2d at 427 (stating a circuit courtâ€™s refusal to give a properly requested charge is reversible error only when the requesting party can demonstrate prejudice from the refusal).\r\nWhen a governmental entity asserts multiple exceptions to the waiver of immunity and at least one of the exceptions contains a gross negligent standard, we must interpolate the gross negligence standard into the other exceptions.Â  In Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999), our supreme court explained:\r\n\r\nThis Court and the Court of Appeals previously have recognized that the correct approach, when a governmental entity asserts various exceptions to the waiver of immunity, is to read exceptions that do not contain the gross negligence standard in light of exceptions that do contain the standard.Â  Duncan v. Hampton County School Dist. # 2, 335 S.C. 535, 517 S.E.2d 449 (1999) (reading discretionary immunity exception in light of exception to immunity in which governmental entity exercises its duty in a grossly negligent manner, such that discretionary immunity will not protect the government if it exercises that discretion in a grossly negligent manner); Etheredge v. Richland School Dist. I, 330 S.C. 447, 463, 499 S.E.2d 238, 246 (Ct. App. 1998) (when an action is brought alleging gross negligence by a governmental entity pursuant to an exception contained in Section 15-78-60, all other applicable exceptions must be read in light of the exception containing the gross negligence standard), cert. granted on other grounds, April 8, 1999. The principles expressed in Duncan and Etheredge are drawn from Jackson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 301 S.C. 125, 390 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 1989), affâ€™d, 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d 377 (1990).\r\n\r\n While provisions establishing limitations upon and exemptions from liability of a governmental entity must be liberally construed to limit liability, we also must presume in construing a statute that the Legislature did not intend to perform a futile thing.Â  See Gaffney v. Mallory, 186 S.C. 337, 195 S.E. 840 (1938).Â  We are constrained to avoid a construction that would read a provision out of a statute, and must reconcile conflicts if possible. Ballard v. Ballard, 314 S.C. 40, 443 S.E.2d 802 (1994).\r\n\r\nSteinke, 336 S.C. at 395-96, 520 S.E.2d at 153-54.Â  Accordingly, the Steinke court held:\r\n\r\n[T]he inspection powers exception must be read in conjunction with the key exception at issue in this case, Section 15-78-60(12), the licensing powers exception.Â  Department must inspect an amusement device before deciding whether to issue, suspend, or revoke a license.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-18-70 and 41-18-80.Â  Department also has an implicit duty to investigate potentially hazardous substantial modifications when it learns of them.Â  It would make no sense to say Department may be found grossly negligent in a licensing decision, yet allow Department to escape liability because the inspection powers exception does not contain a gross negligence standard.Â  The logical way to read these closely related provisions when both are at issue is that a governmental entity may be liable if it is grossly negligent in licensing or inspecting a particular device or activity.\r\n\r\nId. at 395-96, 520 S.E.2d at 153-54.\r\nTherefore, because Proctor proceeded under a theory of gross negligence as provided in section 15-78-60(12), the other subsections of that statute do not provide immunity from DHECâ€™s acts of gross negligence.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying DHECâ€™s motion in limine, motion for a directed verdict, or in its jury charge.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Evidence of Events Prior to 2000\r\nDHEC contends the trial court erred in allowing evidence of events and damages prior to the Boardâ€™s 2000 order, because this evidence was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission of evidence is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Seabrook Island Prop.

McLaughlin, 328 S.C. 504, 510, 492 S.E.2d 816, 819 (Ct.

Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.â€ Rule 402, SCRE; see Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 332 S.C. 605, 613, 506 S.E.2d 516, 520 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d as modified, 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000). â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE; In re Robert R., 340 S.C. 242, 246-47, 531 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct. App. 2000); Haselden, 341 S.C. at 497 n.12, 534 S.E.2d at 301 n.12; Hunter v. Staples, 335 S.C. 93, 101-02, 515 S.E.2d 261, 266 (Ct. App. 1999); see Watson ex rel Watson v. Chapman, 343 S.C. 471, 478, 540 S.E.2d 484, 487 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe dictates of Rule 401 are subject to the balancing requirement of Rule 403, SCRE, which requires a court to exclude relevant evidence upon a showing that its admission would be more prejudicial than probative.â€).Â  \r\nThe evidence at issue here was necessary as a means of introducing the jury to the background events leading up to the period of time from 2000 through the date of the trial.Â  For example, an e-mail referenced by Proctor served to show that DHEC officials were in a position to interact directly with retail sellers and would have knowledge of the rebate listâ€™s impact on a facilityâ€™s business.Â  Moreover, the facts surrounding this e-mail and any other acts prior to 2000 were excluded from consideration by the jury for damages.Â  The trial court specifically charged that â€œ[t]he period here for which you are concerned with is that period commencing with July the 27th, 2000.â€Â  The information relating to what happened prior to the issues in this case was relevant to the questions to be decided at trial.Â  Furthermore, the trial court properly charged the jury that they should consider only those acts occurring after July 27th, 2000.Â  Accordingly, we find no error.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Lost Profits/Damages\r\nDHEC asserts three issues dealing with lost profits and damages: (1) that the court erred in denying DHECâ€™s directed verdict motion as to damages and in charging the jury as to lost profits; (2) that the court erred in refusing DHECâ€™s request for a jury instruction limiting Proctorâ€™s damages to $9,500; and (3) that the damages were so excessive as to require a new trial absolute, or a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  \r\nA.Â  Reasonable Certainty Standard\r\nDHEC did not request the trial court to submit a special verdict form to determine whether the actual damages were for lost profits, loss of goodwill, or some other measure.Â  Without a special verdict form, it would be speculative for this Court to determine what portion of the award the jury attributed to lost profits as opposed to other tort damages.Â  See Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 251, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Even so, the law does not require absolute certainty of data upon which lost profits\r\nare to be determined, but requires such reasonable certainty that damages are not based upon speculation and conjecture.Â  It is sufficient if there is a certain standard or fixed method by which profits may be estimated and determined with a fair degree of accuracy.Â  Beck v. Clarkson, 300 S.C. 293, 298-99, 387 S.E.2d 681, 684 (Ct. App. 1989) (quoting South Carolina Fin. Corp. of Anderson v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. 109, 113 S.E.2d 329 (1960)).\r\nâ€œâ€˜Profitsâ€™ have been defined as the â€˜net pecuniary gain from a transaction, the gross pecuniary gains diminished by the cost of obtaining them.â€™â€Â  Moore, 360 S.C. at 253, 599 S.E.2d at 473 (quoting Restatement of Contracts Â§ 331, Comment B (1932)); see also Mali v. Odom, 295 S.C. 78, 367 S.E.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1988) (defining profits as the net of income over expenditures during a given period).Â  \r\nDrews Co., Inc. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Assocs., Inc., 296 S.C. 207, 371 S.E.2d 532 (1988), offers an erudite and comprehensive analysis of the standards governing recovery of lost profits:\r\n\r\nThe crucial requirement in lost profits determinations is that they be â€œestablished with reasonable certainty, for recovery cannot be had for profits that are conjectural or speculative.â€Â  South Carolina Finance Corp., supra, at 122, 113 S.E.2d at 336.Â  â€œThe proof must pass the realm of conjecture, speculation, or opinion not founded on facts, and must consist of actual facts from which a reasonably accurate conclusion regarding the cause and the amount of the loss can be logically and rationally drawn.â€Â  22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§ 641 (1988).\r\n\r\n Numerous proof techniques have been discussed and accepted in different factual scenarios.Â  See, e.g., Upjohn v. Rachelle Laboratories, Inc., 661 F.2d 1105, 1114 (6th Cir. 1981) (proof of future lost profits based on marketing forecasts by employees specializing in economic forecasting); Petty v. Weyerhaeuser Co., supra (skating rinkâ€™s projected revenues compared to those of another arena in a nearby town); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 352, at 146 (1981) (proof of lost profits â€œmay be established with reasonable certainty with the aid of expert testimony, economic and financial data, market surveys and analyses, business records of similar enterprises, and the like.â€); Note, supra, 48 Ohio St. L.J. at 872-3 (means of proving prospective profits include (1) â€œyardstickâ€ method of comparison with profit performance of business similar in size, nature, and location; (2) comparison with profit history of plaintiffâ€™s successor, where applicable; (3) comparison of similar businesses owned by plaintiff himself, and (4) use of economic and financial data and expert testimony).Â \r\n\r\nDrews Co., 296 S.C. at 213-14, 371 S.E.2d at 535-36.Â  The Drews Co. case dealt specifically with lost profits in the context of a new business.Â  The court explained: â€œWhile the factual contexts in which new business/lost profits cases arise will undoubtedly vary, these methods of proof and the â€˜reasonable certaintyâ€™ requirement bear an inherent flexibility facilitating the just assessment of profits lost to a new business due to contractual breach.â€Â  Id. at 214, 371 S.E.2d at 536.Â  Although the instant case does not involve lost profits of a new business, the courtâ€™s comment that the reasonable certainty requirement bears an inherent flexibility facilitating the just assessment of lost profits holds true here as well.\r\nIn Whisenant v. James Island Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1981), our supreme court observed:\r\n\r\nGenerally, in order for damages to be recoverable, the evidence should be such as to enable the court or jury to determine the amount thereof with reasonable certainty or accuracy.Â  While neither the existence, causation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess or speculation, proof with mathematical certainty of the amount of loss or damage is not required.Â  Piggy Park Enterprises, Inc. v. Schofield, 251 S.C. 385, 162 S.E.2d 705 (1968); Gray v. Southern Facilities, Inc., 256 S.C. 558, 183 S.E.2d 438 (1971).\r\n\r\nAccord Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 621 S.E.2d 368 (Ct.

Schofield, 251 S.C. 385, 162 S.E.2d 705 (1968), the supreme court inculcated:\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that the existence or amount of damages cannot be left to conjecture, guess or speculation. \r\nâ€˜As a general rule, the evidence should be such as to enable the court or jury to determine * * * the amount of damages with reasonable certainty or accuracy; and it is sufficient if they are so established. \r\n\r\nâ€˜Proof of the amount of loss with absolute or mathematical certainty is not required, and it does not matter that the determination of damages depends to some extent on the consideration of contingent events.Â  So, it had been held sufficient if a reasonable basis of computation is afforded, even though the result may be only approximate, or to adduce evidence which is the best the case is susceptible of under the circumstances and which will permit a reasonably close estimate of the loss.â€™ 25A C.J.S. Damages Â§ 162(2), p. 80. Cf. Powers v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 216 S.C. 309, 57 S.E.2d 638, 16 A.L.R.2d 1261; S. C. Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. Aetna Ins.

Weyerhaeuser Co., 288 S.C. 349, 355-56, 342 S.E.2d 611, 615-16 (Ct. App. 1986) (citations omitted).\r\n1.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nDHEC contends the trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor for failure to prove damages.Â  At the close of trial, DHEC moved for a directed verdict on damages, arguing: \r\n\r\nAnd also the third ground for my motion for directed verdict is the failure to prove his damages in this case by evidence that the jury can look at and not engage in speculation or conjecture, and thereâ€™s been no proper proof of damages in this case.\r\n\r\nIn its brief, DHEC reiterates, â€œProctor failed to introduce any evidence that a jury could use to determine an amount of damages.â€Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn this case, the evidence advanced at trial supports the juryâ€™s award of damages. Â The evidence showed there are three million tires discarded in South Carolina each year and there are fewer than ten waste tire facilities in the State.Â  Because Proctor was not on the rebate list, he was unable to sustain contracts with his major customers and lost the dollar he would have received for every tire he took into the facility.Â  Proctorâ€™s customers disposed of over 15,000 tires per quarter, each of which was subject to the one-dollar rebate.Â  Moreover, Proctor testified that â€œthirty-three to forty percent of the tires we got [from Samâ€™s Club] we could sell them and make a profit[.]â€Â  Thus, from 2000 until the time Proctor was returned to the list, he lost the rebate for each tire he would have received from Samâ€™s Club, plus lost profits from thirty-three to forty percent of the tires he would have sold as used tires.Â  Further, Proctor sold chips from tires for playgrounds, carpet backing, and septic systems.Â Â Â  \r\nProctor demonstrated that between 2000 and 2001, his company paid approximately $9,500 to take tires to another processing facility after he was removed from the rebate list.Â  Proctor presented evidence of the number of tires his business processed per year from 1995 through 2004, which included 30,000 tires in 1995, and 60,000 tires in 1996.Â  Proctor asseverated that as a result of DHECâ€™s actions, Anderson Tire Recyclingâ€™s business reputation had been damaged and had not yet recovered.Â  \r\nWe find sufficient evidence of damages to support the trial judgeâ€™s submitting this case to the jury.Â  See S.C. Prop. &amp; Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, 884-85 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting on appeal from the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court may only reverse if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling).\r\n2.Â  Jury Instructions\r\nSimilarly, we reject DHECâ€™s argument that the court erred by not charging the jury that Proctorâ€™s damages, if any, were limited to $9,500.Â  â€œWhen instructing the jury, the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€Â  Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  â€œTo warrant reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have not only been erroneous, but prejudicial as well.â€Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289.Â  Proctor proffered evidence of damages beyond the $9,500 he paid to another facility to take tires.Â  Therefore, the trial judge did not err by rejecting DHECâ€™s request to charge.Â  \r\nB.Â  Excessive Damagesâ€”New Trial Absolute/New Trial Nisi Remittitur\r\nFinally, DHEC contends the amount of damages found by the jury was so unduly liberal or grossly excessive as to require a new trial nisi remittitur or a new trial absolute.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œA new trial nisi is one in which a new trial will be granted unless the party opposing it complies with a condition set by the court.â€Â  Waring v. Johnson, 341 S.C. 248, 257, 533 S.E.2d 906, 911 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Elliot v. Black River Elec. Coop., 233 S.C. 233, 104 S.E.2d 357 (1958)).Â  The grant or denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge, and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.Â  Chapman v. Upstate RV &amp; Marine, 364 S.C. 82, 88-89, 610 S.E.2d 852, 856 (Ct. App. 2005); Waring, 341 S.C. at 256, 533 S.E.2d at 910; Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The trial court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when he finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Chapman, 364 S.C. at 89, 610 S.E.2d at 856 (citing McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995)); see also Evans v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 99, 522 S.E.2d 350, 352 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting that when the juryâ€™s verdict is inadequate or excessive, the trial judge has the discretionary power to grant a new trial nisi); Hawkins v. Greenwood Development Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 493 S.E.2d 875 (Ct. App. 1997) (same).Â  However, compelling reasons must be given to justify invading the juryâ€™s province by granting a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Cf. Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 61, 427 S.E.2d 673, 676 (1993).Â  The consideration for a motion for a new trial nisi remittitur requires the trial judge to consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of the evidence presented.Â  Cf. Vinson, 324 S.C. at 405, 477 S.E.2d at 723.Â  Great deference is given to the trial judge â€œwho heard the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial,â€ and who thus â€œpossesses a better-informed view of the damages than this Court.â€Â \r\nId. at 405-06, 477 S.E.2d at 723 (citing Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d 802 (1993)); accord Waring, 341 S.C. at 257, 533 S.E.2d at 911.Â  \r\nâ€œWhen considering a motion for a new trial based on the inadequacy or excessiveness of the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court must distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice, or prejudice.â€Â  Elam v.

Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993)).Â  \r\nâ€œThe decision to grant or deny a new trial absolute based on the excessiveness of a verdict rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not ordinarily be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Elam, 361 S.C. at 27, 602 S.E.2d at 781; see Crawford v. Charleston-Isle of Palms Traction Co., 126 S.C. 447, 120 S.E. 381 (1923) (observing the refusal to grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict was excessive was addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge).Â  â€œIn deciding whether to assess error when a new trial motion is denied, the appellate court must consider the testimony and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Becker v.

Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d 802 (1993).Â  The juryâ€™s determination of damages, however, is entitled to substantial deference.Â  Id.Â  The trial judge must grant a new trial absolute if the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruption or some other improper motives.Â  See Cock-n-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., ___ S.C. ___, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996); McCourt by and Through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995); Allstate Ins. Co. v.

Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993); Rush, supra.Â  The failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial absolute in this situation amounts to an abuse of discretion and on appeal this Court will grant a new trial absolute.Â  Weir v.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(H) (2003). Â The trial court dismissed Jamesâ€™ petition.Â  We reverse and remand for resentencing.\r\nAn indictment charged James with armed robbery.Â  Because he had a prior armed robbery conviction, the State sought to have him sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1) (2003).Â  South Carolina Code section 17-25-45(H) provides the following regarding notice: \r\n\r\nWhere the solicitor is required to seek or determines to seek sentencing of a defendant under this section, written notice must be given by the solicitor to the defendant and defendantâ€™s counsel not less than ten days before trial.[1]Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court found defense counsel received the required written notice but James did not; however, the trial court also found James had actual notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.\r\nOur recent case of State v. Johnson[2] controls the result here.Â  In Johnson, a majority of this court held insufficient the notice required by section 17-25-45(H) where the State served written notice upon the defendant but not upon his counsel, notwithstanding both the defendant and his lawyer had actual notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.Â  The court observed:\r\n\r\nBy its words in the recidivist statute, the General Assembly has mandated that the solicitor â€œmustâ€ notify the defendant and the defendantâ€™s counsel in writing if the solicitor intends to seek a life sentence without the possibility of parole.Â  For this Court to dismiss the clear and unambiguous language of the statute and merely require the defendantâ€™s counsel to have actual notice of the solicitorâ€™s intent to seek life without parole would have the effect of amending the statute.Â  In our view, actual notice under section 17-25-45(H) is insufficient unless and until the General Assembly decides otherwise and amends the statute itself.[3]\r\n\r\nAs noted in footnote two, supra, the supreme court declined to review the decision. Â It did so, notwithstanding one judge dissented.[4]Â  \r\nWe discern no meaningful distinction between the Johnson case and the one here. Â The statute in question requires both a defendant and defendantâ€™s counsel to receive written notice of the Stateâ€™s intention.Â  In Johnson, the solicitor notified the defendant in writing but not the defendantâ€™s counsel; here, the solicitor notified the defendantâ€™s counsel in writing but not the defendant.Â  To paraphrase the majorityâ€™s words in Johnson, for this court to dismiss the clear and unambiguous language of the statute and merely require the defendant to have actual notice of the solicitorâ€™s intent to seek life imprisonment without parole would have the effect of amending the statute.Â  The statute is the same today as it was when this court decided Johnson. \r\nRegarding the Stateâ€™s argument that written notice to defense counsel sufficed to provide written notice to the defendant because defense counsel served as the defendantâ€™s agent, we can only say not in this case â€“ not where the statute, as this court held in Johnson, in clear and unambiguous language requires both a defendant and his counsel to be served with written notice.Â  If a defendantâ€™s actual notice is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 17-25-45(H), then his imputed knowledge certainly is.\r\nTo establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove trial counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and there is a reasonable probability the result would have been different but for counselâ€™s error.[5]Â  James made such a showing here when he proved counsel did not raise the issue of the Stateâ€™s failure to serve the defendant with written notice, even though the statute, as this court later held, plainly required a defendant to be so served, and as a result James was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in violation of the statute.Â  This failure obviously prejudiced him.Â  Moreover, that this court decided Johnson after the trial court sentenced James is of little moment in view of the â€œclear and unambiguous languageâ€[6] of section 17-25-45(H).\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Â S.C.
