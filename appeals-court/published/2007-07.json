Since a land owner cannot benefit from artificial accretion, the State remained the owner of the disputed land.

Burns, of Mt. Pleasant and Douglas Whitsett MacNeille, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDean B. Bell and Gregory Milam Alford, both of Hilton Head Island and Assistant Deputy Attorney General J. Emory Smith, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this quiet title action, the Hilton Head Plantation Property Ownersâ€™ Association, Inc. (the Association) appeals the special refereeâ€™s order determining the State of South Carolina owns title to certain disputed land (the Property).Â  On appeal, the Association contends the special referee erred in failing to find it obtained the Property through chain of title or adverse possession.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Hilton Head Plantation Company, Inc. (the Developer) owned and developed a large tract of land known as Hilton Head Plantation.Â  To further this development, the Developer created the Association.Â  Within Hilton Head Plantation lies Bear Creek Subdivision II (the Subdivision).Â  A salt marsh conservatory borders lots 48 through 60 of the Subdivision.Â  The Property consists of a strip of land lying between these lots and the high water mark in the salt marsh conservatory.Â \r\n \r\nIn July 2000, the Association filed this quiet title action against the individual owners of lots 48 through 60, the State, and any other party claiming an interest in the Property.Â  The Association asserted title to the Property through a quitclaim deed from the Developer or alternatively through adverse possession.Â  The State answered, claiming paramount title to the Property pursuant to the public trust doctrine.Â  Thomas M. and Laura E. Donald, the owners of lot 54 in the Subdivision, also answered, reiterating the Stateâ€™s argument.Â  No other party asserted an interest in the Property.Â  \r\n \r\nThe case was referred to a special referee for trial.Â  At trial, Jack Best, an employee of the Developer from 1972 to 1984, testified the Developer dredged a nearby creek in 1972 and 1973.Â  This dredging caused spoil to build up and created a berm between Hilton Head Plantation and the marsh area.Â  Best further testified that prior to these activities, the area now constituting the Property was tidal.Â  In addition, the Developer did not provide for a buffer area between the newly platted lot lines and the marsh.Â \r\n \r\nThe special referee held the Property was created in the early 1970â€™s by spoil from the Developerâ€™s dredging.Â  Consequently, the special referee concluded the area belongs to the State.Â  The Association filed a motion to reconsider, which the special referee denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, an action to quiet title to land lies in equity.Â  Goldman v. RBC, Inc., 369 S.C. 462, 465, 632 S.E.2d 850, 851&nbsp;(2006).Â  However, when the defendantâ€™s answer raises an issue of paramount title to land, such as would, if established, defeat plaintiffâ€™s action, the issue of title is legal.Â  Mountain Lake Colony v. McJunkin, 308 S.C. 202, 204, 417 S.E.2d 578, 579&nbsp;(1992); see also Bryan v. Freeman, 253 S.C. 50, 52, 168 S.E.2d 793, 793-94&nbsp;(1969) (â€œ[W]hen the defendantâ€™s answer raises an issue of paramount title to land, such as would, if established, defeat plaintiffâ€™s action, it is the duty of the court to submit to a jury the issue of title as raised by the pleadings.â€).Â  â€œTherefore, in a case tried without a jury, the factual findings of a judge regarding title will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60-61, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157&nbsp;(1988).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Association contends the special referee erred in refusing to find it acquired the Property through chain of title or adverse possession.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œHistorically, the State holds presumptive title to land below the high water mark.â€Â  McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119&nbsp;(2003); see also Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 396, 252 S.E.2d 133, 135&nbsp;(1979) (â€œThis Court has held that lands lying between the usual high water line and the usual low water line on tidal navigable watercourses enjoy a special or unique status, being held by the State in trust for public purposes.â€).Â  â€œOne asserting title to this land must prove a specific grant from the sovereign[,] which is strictly construed against the grantee.â€Â  Coburg Dairy, Inc. v. Lesser, 318 S.C. 510, 512, 458 S.E.2d 547, 548&nbsp;(1995).\r\nThe Association claims the Developer, as the owner of Hilton Head Plantation at the time the Property was created, obtained title to the Property through accretion.Â  As a result, the Association asserts its quitclaim deed from the Developer conveyed the Property to the Association.Â  Generally, a riparian owner enjoys the right to any lands formed by accretion.Â  78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters Â§ 35 (2002); see also 65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters Â§ 95 (2000) (â€œ[A]ny increase of soil to land adjacent or contiguous to a navigable stream or water, formed by accretion or alluvion, belongs to the riparian or littoral owner.â€).Â  However, â€œartificial accretions which are caused solely by the act of the upland owner should not inure to his benefit, for the upland owner should not be permitted to enlarge his own estate at the expense of the State.â€Â  Horry County v. Tilghman, 283 S.C. 475, 481, 322 S.E.2d 831, 834&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984) (quoting Borough of Wildwood Crest v. Masciarella, 222 A.2d 138, 143 (N.J. Ch. 1966); see also 65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters Â§ 96 (2000) (â€œUnder the common law, a littoral owner cannot extend its own property into water by landfilling or purposely causing accretion.â€).\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this case, Bestâ€™s testimony supports the special refereeâ€™s conclusion that the Property was formed by the Developerâ€™s dredging activities in the early 1970â€™s.Â  Bestâ€™s testimony also supports the special refereeâ€™s decision that the State owned the Property because it was below the high water mark before this dredging.Â  As a result, the Developer did not have title to the Property at the time it quitclaimed the Property to the Association.Â  A fortiori, the Association may not claim the Property through a deed from the Developer.Â  Finally, based on our finding that the State holds title to the Property, the Association also may not claim the Property through a theory of adverse possession.Â  See Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 179-80, 345 S.E.2d 724, 726&nbsp;(1986) (â€œ[A]dverse possession does not run against the [S]tate or its duly constituted political subdivisions.â€).Â  Based on the foregoing, the special refereeâ€™s decision is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.

Hicks and Miss Kittyâ€™s, Inc. (hereafter collectively Hicks) contend the master in equity erred in finding Hicks liable for fraud.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nHicks leased the property in question from Danny Enterprises in 1998.Â  Hicks and Howard Hendricks entered into a contract in 2002, pursuant to which Hicksâ€™ leasehold interest was assigned to Hendricks.Â  Hendricks also purchased all the furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory, and good will connected with the ongoing business and the premises.Â  The contract also gave Hendricks the right to offset any loss or damage he incurred in the event of a breach of any of the warranties, representations, or covenants in the contract from any sum he may still owe.Â  \r\n \r\nHicks specifically warranted that â€œpublic water is available to the premisesâ€ and â€œapplicable zoning permits operation of an adult entertainment business on the premises.â€Â  The contract further stated, â€œwe have no knowledge of any fire, health, safety, building, pollution, environmental, zoning or other violation of law in respect to the property . . . .â€Â  \r\n \r\nHicks was operating a â€œgentlemanâ€™s clubâ€ on the premises prior to entering into the transaction with Hendricks and was litigating with the City of Myrtle Beach concerning sewer service to the property.Â  The property had to be within the city limits to connect to the sewer lines, but city zoning ordinances prohibited the operation of adult-oriented businesses in that particular location.[2]Â  Even though a state court order held that the city was under no obligation to provide sewer service, Hicks still contended he was entitled to the service, and the dispute was ongoing in federal court at the time of the transaction with Hendricks.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) notified Hicks of a temporary allowance permitting him to use the â€œpump and haulâ€ method of waste disposal until the business could connect to public sewer.Â  Hicks was then notified that if he could not connect to public sewer service he would have to cease operating his business because continued use of a septic system would constitute a violation.Â \r\n \r\nHendricks was aware there was an ongoing dispute between the city and Hicks with respect to the sewer connection.Â  However, it was not until after the closing that Hendricks learned of the cease and desist order from DHEC.Â  He also discovered that much of the furniture and other personal property covered by the assignment was not clear of liens and encumbrances as warranted.Â  This resulted in Hendricks spending significant amounts of money replacing the furniture and televisions that were repossessed.Â \r\n \r\nHendricks attempted to work with DHEC in order to reach a compromise on the sewer situation.Â  However, his efforts were to no avail.Â  Hendricks then informed Hicks of his intention to invoke the offset provision set forth in the contract.Â \r\n \r\nHendricks filed a complaint against Hicks alleging fraud, conversion, and breach of contract.Â  Hicks filed a timely counterclaim alleging breach of contract.Â  The matter was referred to the master who, after a hearing on the merits, issued an order granting judgment in favor of Hendricks for $100,826.51 ($72,000 on the fraud cause of action and $28,826.51 on the conversion cause of action).[3]Â  The order also dismissed Hicksâ€™ counterclaim with prejudice.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for fraud is one at law.Â  Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228, 230, 437 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App. 1993) (applying a legal standard of review on appeal from causes of action alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty). Â In an action at law tried without a jury, the courtâ€™s findings of fact will be upheld on appeal when the findings are reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Butler Contracting, Inc.,&nbsp;v. Court Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 127, 631 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2006). Â The courtâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or clearly influenced or controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. at 127, 631 S.E.2d at 255-56.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHicks contends the master erred in finding him liable for fraud without evidence supporting each element.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nTo establish a claim of fraud, plaintiffs must show by clear and convincing evidence (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the plaintiff act upon the representation; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury. Â King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 311, 318 S.E.2d 125, 127 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Failure to prove any one of these elements is fatal to recovery. Â Oâ€™Shields v. Southern Fountain Mobile Homes, Inc., 262 S.C. 276, 281, 204 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1974).\r\n\r\nHicks contends that because Hendricks was aware of the litigation between himself and the city, Hendricks could not have reasonably relied on any representation regarding available sewer service.Â  He further argues that any warranty regarding health or safety violations could not be false because his litigation with the city was ongoing and unresolved.Â  We disagree.[4]  \r\nHicks warranted that he had â€œno knowledge of any fire, health, safety, building, pollution, environmental, zoning, or other violation of law in respect to the property or any part thereofâ€ . . . nor had he â€œreceived written notice from any federal, state, county, or municipal government authority alleging any such violations.â€Â  He went on to warrant specifically â€œthat applicable zoning permits operation of an adult entertainment business on the premises.â€Â  The combination of these warranties represented to Hendricks that the purpose for which he was leasing the property, to open an adult entertainment business, would be possible.Â  \r\n \r\nEven though Hendricks was aware of the sewer-related litigation, he did not know DHEC was requiring discontinuation of the â€œpump and haulâ€ method of waste disposal, leaving him with no sewer service to the property.Â  Regardless of whether the city had improperly denied sewer service to Hicks, there was clearly a notice from DHEC that the continued use of a septic system constituted a violation.\r\nHendricks testified that Hicks showed him the â€œpump and haulâ€ system and explained the existing waste disposal system when he viewed the property before signing the contract.Â  The parties discussed possible repairs that could be made to the system.Â  At no point, however, did Hicks indicate this was an unacceptable form of waste removal nor did Hicks disclose that he had been told by DHEC that the â€œpump and haulâ€ system was only temporary.Â  Hendricks did not learn of the cease and desist order until the day after closing when he contacted DHEC himself.Â  This omission, coupled with the warranty that there were no health or safety violations related to the property, misled Hendricks on a clearly material issue.\r\n \r\nAs a result of the false representations, Hendricks was placed in the position of being unable to satisfy waste disposal requirements without being annexed into the city, at which time he would no longer be able to operate the adult entertainment business. Â The master found that Hendricks proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the representations made by Hicks were false, were justifiably relied on by Hendricks to his detriment, and Hendricks is entitled to judgment against Hicks.Â  There is ample evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s ruling.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\n \r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Hicks argued that because he had paid a sewer impact fee, he had a continuing contract with the city to provide sewer service to the premises regardless of annexation into the city.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] The master also found for Hendricks on the breach of warranty claim, but only awarded damages pursuant to the fraud and conversion claims. Â Hendricksâ€™ conversion claim was based on Hicksâ€™ improper self-help reclamation of the property after Hendricks attempted to invoke the offset provisions of the contract. \r\n \r\n[4] This appeal only involves the fraud cause of action based on the warranties and representations in the contract and lease assignment, not the fraud cause of action concerning the personal property, as Hicks makes no argument concerning the personal property in his brief.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4274","title":"Bradley v.

Â After summoning his son Bradley walked to the side of the road and began signaling for help with a flashlight. Â At about 3:15 a.m., United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Clifton Douglas, Jr. drove passed Bradley, turned his vehicle around, and headed toward the accident scene.Â  When Douglas returned in the northbound lane he saw a â€œlarge white garbage can bagâ€ in the middle of his lane.Â  Douglas parked his vehicle, approached Bradley, and observed that Bradley was bleeding from a head laceration.Â  While helping Bradley, Douglas heard another passing vehicle strike and drag the garbage bag down the road.Â  Bradleyâ€™s son and daughter subsequently arrived and noted the trash bag and trash scattered on the roadway.Â \r\n \r\nBradleyâ€™s friend, Thomas Bosley, had been with Bradley at the Waffle House.Â  As Bosley drove home on College Park Road minutes before Bradley, he saw â€œa large trash bag in the middle of the [northbound] lane,â€ less than one-quarter mile from the restaurant.Â  Bosley claimed he narrowly avoided the garbage bag and continued driving about another quarter-mile on College Park Road when he encountered a â€œwhite street sweeperâ€™s truck.â€Â  Bosley observed this truck â€œdrop another similar trash bag onto the public roadway.â€Â  He learned the next morning about Bradleyâ€™s accident.\r\nBradley brought this action against his insurer to collect under the uninsured motorist provision of his policy. The insurer represented Doe as the unknown driver.Â  Doe moved for summary judgment arguing Bradley failed to satisfy the statutory requirement for recovery under the uninsured policy provision because no one independently witnessed Bradleyâ€™s accident.Â  The trial court granted Doeâ€™s summary judgment motion and denied Bradleyâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006). Â Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP (â€œThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€); Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 134, 638 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2006); Houck v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005); Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631 (Ct. App. 2004). Â In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party; Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 619, 602 S.E.2d 747, 749 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 213, 609 S.E.2d 565, 567 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\n \r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Â Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 228, 612 S.E.2d 719, 722 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 376, 597 S.E.2d 181, 183 (Ct. App. 2004)). Â Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Id. (citing Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App. 2003). Â Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Â Jones, 364 S.C. at 228, 612 S.E.2d at 722 (citation omitted). Â The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder. Â Id. â€œSummary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.â€Â  BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 326, 608 S.E.2d 155, 159 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBradley asserts the trial court erred in granting Doeâ€™s summary judgment motion.Â  Specifically, Bradley urges that he satisfied the independent witness requirement in section 38-77-170(2) of the South Carolina Code of Laws by providing testimony from independent witnesses regarding circumstantial evidence of an unknown driverâ€™s negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Requirements of S.C.

Â§ 38-77-170\r\nSection 38-77-170 establishes the conditions under which an insured may recover uninsured motorist coverage when the owner or operator of the motor vehicle causing injury or damage is unknown:Â Â Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, \r\n\tunless:\r\n\t(1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate police authority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n\t(2) the injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, \r\n\tor the accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle; provided however, the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained in the affidavit;\r\n\t(3) the insured was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the other vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2002) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n \r\nWhere there is no physical contact with a vehicle driven by an unknown motorist, someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle must have witnessed the accident and attest to the facts of the accident in a signed affidavit.Â  See Wausau Underwriters Insurance Company v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 274-75, 422 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1992) (holding â€œno physical contact with the unknown vehicle is necessary when a witness other than the owner or driver of the insured vehicle is available to attest to the facts of the accident.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Rules of Statutory Construction\r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Â Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996); Shealy v. Doe, 370 S.C. 194, 199, 634 S.E.2d 45, 48 (Ct. App. 2006). Â The first question of statutory interpretation is whether the statuteâ€™s meaning is clear on its face.Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002); Eagle Container Co., LLC v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 622, 622 S.E.2d 733, 738 (Ct. App. 2005) (cert. granted January 31, 2007).\r\nWhen a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed, and this Court has no right to impose another meaning. Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372 S.C. 519, ___, 642 S.E.2d 751, 754 (2007); see Vaughn v. Bernhardt, 345 S.C. 196, 198, 547 S.E.2d 869, 870 (2001). Â â€œ[T]he words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004); see also Miller v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 447, 441 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1994) (â€œIn determining the meaning of a statute, the terms used therein must be taken in their ordinary and popular meaning, nothing to the contrary appearing.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute. Â Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 230, 612 S.E.2d 719, 723 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 102, 606 S.E.2d 503. 506 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 339, 478 S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996)). Â What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Â Jones, 364 S.C. at 230, 612 S.E.2d at 723 (citing Bayle v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001)). Â The language must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose. Â Jones, 364 S.C. at 230, 612 S.E.2d at 723 (citing Hitachi Data Sys. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992)). Â The courtâ€™s primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly. Â Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 87, 564 S.E.2d 358, 361 (Ct. App. 2002). Â â€œOnce the legislature has made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment based upon their own notions of public policy.â€ Â South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nIf the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself. Â State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 367, 574 S.E.2d 203, 207 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€ Â Collins Music Co., Inc. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 550, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998)).Â  Courts will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. Â Jones, 364 S.C. at 230, 612 S.E.2d at 723 (citing Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000); Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)). Â A court should not consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  See Hinton v. South Carolina Dept. of Prob., Parole and Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 333, 592 S.E.2d 335, 338 (Ct. App. 2004); Doe v. Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 580, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735-36 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Interpretation of S.C. Code Ann Â§ 38-77-170\r\nâ€œThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.â€ Â Catawba Indian Tribe, 372 S.C. at 519, 642 S.E.2d at 754 (citing Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995) (â€œThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.â€)). Â \r\nSection 38-77-170(2) is clear on its face. Â It expressly requires that someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle witness the accident.Â  â€œThe plain language of Â§ 38-77-170(2) requires that where the accident involves no physical contact between the insuredâ€™s vehicle and the unidentified vehicle, the accident â€˜must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicleâ€™ and the â€˜witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained therein.â€™ â€ Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 470, 574 S.E.2d 739, 744 (2002).\r\n\r\n\tThe Legislature first enacted a â€œJohn Doeâ€ statute in 1963, recognizing an insuredâ€™s right to receive uninsured motorist coverage for injuries caused by unknown drivers.Â  Since the statuteâ€™s enactment, the Legislature placed safeguards within the statute to prevent citizens from bringing fraudulent â€œJohn Doeâ€ actions. Â The initial safeguard was a requirement that the unknown vehicle make â€œphysical contactâ€ with the plaintiffâ€™s car. Â Act No. 312, 1963 S.C. Acts 535.\r\n\tThen in 1987, the Legislature amended the statute once again to allow insureds to bring a â€œJohn Doeâ€ action regardless of physical contact as long as an independent person witnessed the accident. Â Act. No. 166, 1987 S.C. Acts 1122.\r\n\r\nShealy v. Doe, 370 S.C. 194, 202, 634 S.E.2d 45, 49 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending (citing Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 199-200, 592 S.E.2d 626, 627-28 (2004)). \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe legislature again amended the statute in 1989, and added the sworn affidavit requirement.Â  The statute at large effecting this most recent amendment provides that the act is â€œto amend section 38-77-170 relating to the requirements to recover under the uninsured motorist provisions when the at-fault party is unknown, so as to require a witness to the accident to sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts about the accident and to provide a warning statement to be displayed on the affidavit.â€ Â Act No. 148, 1989 S.C. Acts 439. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nCollins, 352 S.C. at 466, 574 S.E.2d at 741.\r\nIn Collins, our supreme court concluded that â€œ[t]he legislature unambiguously required that a plaintiff seeking to recover against her uninsured motorist coverage for the negligence of an unknown John Doe driver strictly comply with the plain language of the statute.â€ Â 352 S.C. at 466, 574 S.E.2d at 741. Â In order to avoid colliding with vehicle driven by an unknown driver, Collins swerved and collided with another vehicle.Â  Id. at 464-65, 574 S.E.2d at 740.Â  She sustained injuries and sought recovery under her uninsured policy provision. Id.Â  Although Collins did not produce a witness-signed affidavit at trial, she produced a witness at trial who testified the unknown driver caused Collinsâ€™ collision. Â Id.Â  Collins argued the witnessâ€™ testimony satisfied the statutory requirements under section 38-77-170(2).Â  Id.\r\nCiting Criterion Ins. Co. v. Hoffmann, 258 S.C. 282, 188 S.E.2d 459, (1972), the Collins court reiterated the historical reasoning underlying the strict compliance requirement:\r\n\r\n\tThe right to sue and collect from oneâ€™s own liability insurance carrier in case of a loss caused by a hit-and-run driver or other driver of an uninsured automobile is a creature of the legislature. Â Except for the statute, and endorsements required, no right exists to recover from oneâ€™s own insurance carrier. Â One must look to the terms of the uninsured motorist statute and policy endorsements and comply therewith to get the benefit of law. . . .\r\n\tIt is the province of the lawmakers to create a right of action, to provide for process and to declare the procedure for collecting from oneâ€™s own insurance carrier . . . .\r\n\tThe terms of the statute . . . are clear and not ambiguous. Â This being true, there is no room for construction and we are required to apply the statute according to its literal meaning. Â Most courts take a liberal view when dealing with the question of coverage; however, the procedural obligations that the insured must discharge in order to recover, since they are prescribed by statute, are viewed by the courts as mandatory, and strict compliance with them is a prerequisite to recover.\r\n\r\nCollins, 352 S.C. at 467-68, 574 S.E.2d at 741-42 (quoting Criterion, 258 S.C. at 290-92, 188 S.E.2d at 462-63).Â  \r\n \r\nThe court held strict compliance was mandatory and reversed the court of appealsâ€™ ruling that testimony at trial was the â€œfunctional equivalentâ€ of a signed affidavit.Â  Collins, 352 S.C. at 471, 574 S.E.2d at 743.Â  â€œThe statute makes no provision for the functional equivalent of an affidavit.â€ Id. Consequently, the court declined to create an exception in the statute where none previously existed. Â Id.\r\nIn Gilliland v Doe, our supreme court considered â€œto what extent an independent witness must testify about the causal connection between the unknown vehicle and the accident . . .â€ in order to comply with section 38-77-170(2).Â  357 S.C. at 200, 592 S.E.2d at 628.Â  Gilliland crashed into a tree after being Â run off the road by an unknown vehicle.Â  Id. at 198, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  A witness waiting to enter the same roadway saw Gilliland crash, but did not see the unknown vehicle.Â  Id. Â However, before the accident the witness did observe two sets of oncoming headlights.Â  Id.Â  After Gillilandâ€™s crash the witness noticed the second set of headlights â€œarcing through a field,â€ as if making a u-turn and leaving the accident scene.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nAddressing the requirement that an independent witness must attest to â€œthe truth of the facts of the accident,â€ the Gilliland court agreed with the court of appealsâ€™ interpretation that the witness must â€œbe able to attest to the circumstances surrounding the accident, i.e., what actions of the unknown driver contributed to the accident.â€ Â Id. at 200, 592 S.E.2d at 628. Â The court concluded the witnessâ€™s attestation provided circumstantial evidence supporting Gillilandâ€™s testimony â€œthat an unknown driver contributed to her accident.â€ Id. at 202, 592 S.E.2d at 629.Â  Specifically, the court determined the witness, in addition to observing the accident, â€œsaw the lights of an unknown car that was turning around and fleeing the scene of the accident.â€Â  Id. (citing Marks v. Indus. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 212 S.C. 502, 505, 48 S.E.2d 445, 446 (1948) (â€œThe attending circumstances along with direct testimony may be taken into account by the jury in arriving at its decision as any fact in issue may be established by circumstantial evidence, if the circumstances, which must themselves be proven lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty.â€)).\r\nIn contrast to the holding in Collins, the Gilliland court reasoned the â€œfact requirement in section 38-77-170(2) was â€œarguably ambiguousâ€ and â€œtherefore, a strict interpretation . . . would undermine the statuteâ€™s purpose.â€Â  Gilliland, 357 S.C. at 201, 592 S.E.2d at 628. Â The plaintiff in Shealy v. Doe, 370 S.C. 194, 200, 634 S.E.2d 45, 48 (2006), attempted to broaden Gilliland by urging that evidence other than the personal observations of an independent eye witness might satisfy section 38-77-170(2).Â  In Shealy, two men riding in a truck bed were thrown from the vehicle and injured when the driver swerved suddenly to allegedly avoid hitting an unknown vehicle.Â  Id. at 196, 634 S.E.2d at 46.Â  Shealy submitted an affidavit stating the driver of the truck told him he swerved to avoid colliding with an unknown vehicle.Â  Id. at 197, 634 S.E.2d at 46.Â  We held Shealyâ€™s affidavit did not satisfy the independent witness requirement under section 38-77-170(2).Â  Id. at 198, 634 S.E.2d at 47.Â  \r\n \r\nShealy asserted section 38-77-170(2) did not require the witnessâ€™s affidavit to be based on personal knowledge.Â  This court concluded that argument directly contravene[d] the language of the statute:\r\n \r\n\r\n\tShealy submitted affidavits of two people who apparently did not witness the accident; their affidavits do not attest to facts they perceived, but merely restate the perceptions of the vehicleâ€™s operator.Â  Thus Shealy produced no evidence that someone other than [ ], the operator of the insured vehicle, witnessed the accident.Â  [The] affidavits do not comply with th[e] express directive [in section 38-77-170(2)].\r\n\r\nId. at 200, 634 S.E.2d at 48.\r\n\r\n\tWe reasoned that \r\n\t\r\n\t\tShealyâ€™s interpretation of section 38-77-170(2) would totally eviscerate the statuteâ€™s efficacy as it would allow an owner or operator to inform any third-party of the facts of the accident and have that third-party swear out an affidavit as to the owner or operatorâ€™s version of the events. Â In\r\n\t\tCollins, our supreme court elucidated that the â€œobvious purposeâ€ of the affidavit requirement of section 38-77-170(2) is â€œfraud prevention.â€Â  Shealyâ€™s reading of the statute would circumvent the fraud-preventing function of subsection (2), rendering that section meaningless.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 200-201, 634 S.E.2d at 48-49 (internal citation omitted).\r\nRelying on Gilliland, Shealy maintained the affiants provided circumstantial evidence of the accident sufficient to comply with section 38-77-170(2). Â Id. at 201, 634 S.E.2d at 49.Â  We distinguished Gilliland, explaining the affidavits Shealy submitted, unlike those in Gilliland, did not contain circumstantial evidence based on independent personal knowledge that supported the driverâ€™s version of the accident.Â  Id. at 205, 634 S.E.2d at 51.Â  At best, Shealyâ€™s affidavits merely repeated the driverâ€™s account of what happened and did not independently corroborate the driverâ€™s version of the accident.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\tThe purpose of section 38-77-120(2) is to prevent fraud.Â  Concomitantly, the affidavit of the independent witness must contain some independent evidence that an unknown vehicle was involved in the accident.Â  Shealy failed to satisfy the statuteâ€™s mandate; thus, the court properly granted summary judgment.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nIV.&nbsp; The Factual Record\r\nThe sole issue for consideration in the case sub judice is whether the circumstantial evidence provided by Bradleyâ€™s affiants complies with the statutory mandate in section 38-77-170(2).Â  We hold it does not. \r\n \r\nBradley relies on Gilliland in maintaining that circumstantial evidence provided by independent witnesses is sufficient to survive summary judgment.Â  However, Bradley overlooks that the affiant in Gilliland contemporaneously witnessed both the collision and the headlights of an unknown vehicle turning and leaving the scene.Â  The witnessâ€™s testimony, based on her personal observations, independently corroborated Gillilandâ€™s account of how that accident occurred.Â  \r\n \r\nHere, Bradley was the only witness to the accident.Â  None of the affiants actually saw Bradley swerve to avoid a trash bag in the road and collide with the tree.Â  By Bradleyâ€™s own testimony, he initially thought it was an injured dog lying in the road that caused him to veer off and lose control.Â  The fact that three people saw the bag of trash in the same roadway does not implicate involvement of another vehicle.Â  Testimony that a sweeper truck a quarter-mile down the roadway dropped a similar trash bag likewise fails to establish a sufficient causal link between the sweeper truck and Bradleyâ€™s collision.[3]  \r\nOur courts have historically required strict compliance with section 38-77-170(2). Â Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 452, 470, 574 S.E.2d 739, 743 (2002) Where the accident involves no physical contact between the insuredâ€™s vehicle and the unknown vehicle, the accident â€œmust have been witnessed by someone other than the owner of operator of the insured vehicleâ€ and the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained therein.â€Â  Id. Â â€œUnder the rules of statutory interpretation, use of words such as â€œshallâ€ or â€œmustâ€ indicates the legislatureâ€™s intent to enact a mandatory requirement.â€Â  Id.\r\nA plaintiffâ€™s strict compliance with the affidavit requirement is mandatory.Â  In Collins, the court held trial testimony was not the functional equivalent of an affidavit and did not satisfy the affidavit requirement.Â  In Shealy, witnessesâ€™ affidavits based on third-party communication rather than on personal knowledge of how the accident occurred failed to meet the affidavit requirement.Â  Contrastively, in Gilliland, the independent witnessâ€™s personal observations of the accident corroborated Gillilandâ€™s own account of the facts surrounding her accident and complied with the affidavit requirement.Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œFor circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to warrant the finding of a fact, the circumstances must lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty and must have sufficient probative value to constitute the basis for a legal inference, not for mere speculation.â€ Â Shealy v. Doe, 370 S.C. 194, 205, 634 S.E.2d 45, 51 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Bradleyâ€™s affiants had no personal knowledge of the facts of the accident.Â  Their observations before and after the accident did not establish with reasonable certainty a causal connection between Bradleyâ€™s injury and an unknown vehicle.Â  The affidavits of independent witnesses must contain some independent evidence of an unknown vehicleâ€™s involvement in the accident.Â  Bradley failed to comply with the statuteâ€™s mandate.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the affidavits submitted by Bradley did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bradleyâ€™s collision resulted from involvement with an unknown vehicle.Â  The trial court properly granted Doeâ€™s summary judgment motion.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\nSHORT, J. dissents in a separate opinion. \r\nSHORT , J. (dissenting):Â  I would reverse the order granting summary judgement and for that reason, I respectfully dissent.Â  I adopt the majorityâ€™s facts and standard of review, but I disagree with the analysis and would find as follows.\r\nSection 38-77-170 of the South Carolina Code dictates the â€œconditions to sue or recover under uninsured motorist provision when owner or operator of motor vehicle causing injury or damage is unknownâ€ and states:\r\n\r\n\tIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, unless:\r\n\t(1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate police authority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n\t(2) the injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, or the accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle; provided however, the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained in the affidavit;\r\n\t(3) the insured was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the other vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nThe record fails to include any allegation that Bradley failed to comply with the first or third elements of the above statutory requirement.Â  However, Doe claims Bradley failed to meet either of the two possible prongs set forth in the statuteâ€™s second requirement.Â  I will address these requirements individually.Â \r\n \r\nThe first possible manner in which the second requirement could be met would be to offer proof that the unknown vehicle contacted the insuredâ€™s vehicle during the accident.Â  Bradley does not allege any contact was made with another vehicle, but he noted in his affidavit that he believed he had made contact with the garbage bag prior to veering off the road.Â  The trial court correctly applied South Carolina case law in finding that even if this contact had occurred, it would not constitute physical contact with the unknown vehicle as required by the statute.Â  See Wynn v. Doe, 255 S.C. 509, 180 S.E.2d 95 (1971) (holding a motorcyclistâ€™s contact with a very slick and dangerous chemical substance on the highway, such having been dumped or spilled there by an unknown vehicle, did not constitute physical contact with the unknown vehicle); See also Davis v. Doe, 285 S.C. 538, 331 S.E.2d 352 (1985) (holding a wheel bearing which had dislodged from an unknown vehicle and broken through the insuredâ€™s windshield did not constitute physical contact with the unknown vehicle).\r\nThe above noted Davis opinion, while noting the physical contact requirement was instituted to prevent fraudulent claims, invited the legislature to change this strict physical contact requirement should they find such a change to be â€œadvisable.â€Â  285 S.C. at 541, 331 S.E.2d at 354.Â  Perhaps in response to this invitation, the legislature, in a 1987 amendment, added a second means by which an insured could satisfy the statutory requirements for recovery.[4]Â  See Wausau Underwriters Insurance Company v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 275, 422 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1992).Â  This second prong (Witness Prong) requires that a witness to the accident other than the owner/operator of the insured vehicle must attest in a signed affidavit to the facts of the accident.Â  \r\n \r\nWhile it is clear an item which has fallen from an unknown vehicle and struck an insuredâ€™s vehicle can not satisfy the physical contact element of the statutory requirement, I see no reason why it could not satisfy the Witness Prong.Â  The wisdom behind not allowing the physical contact requirement to be satisfied by contact with something which has fallen off a vehicle is evident.Â  A vehicle owner or operator who sought to defraud could easily refer to any item as having dislodged from an unknown vehicle and struck his vehicle while leaving the insurance company without a means to determine otherwise.Â  However, I fail to see how an independent witness observing an item falling from a vehicle would not be permitted to satisfy the Witness Prong of the statutory requirement.Â  I can discern no difference between a vehicle owner or operator who crashes in evasion of an item which has fallen off a vehicle and a vehicle owner or operator who crashes in evasion of the vehicle itself.Â  Both situations result in an unknown vehicle causing bodily injury and/or property damage to the insured.Â  In either instance, the same protection against fraud would apply in that a witness other than the vehicle owner or operator would have to submit an affidavit attesting to the events which caused the accident.Â  Having established the applicability of the statute, I now seek to determine its satisfaction.\r\nDoe urges this court to construe the statute strictly.Â  He argues the statuteâ€™s language â€œthe accident must have been witnessedâ€ dictates that the affidavits of only those who have seen the accident itself are permitted.Â  I find such a strict construction of the statute would undermine the statuteâ€™s purpose.Â  In fact, our state Supreme Court has recognized ambiguities in Â§38-77-170(2) and has urged a liberal construction.Â  Howser, 309 S.C. at 275, 422 S.E.2d at 110; Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 201, 592 S.E.2d 626, 628 (2004).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nI believe the intent of the language â€œthe accident must have been witnessedâ€ is to direct that the witness must have observed the factors leading to the accident.Â  Someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle simply witnessing the accident without witnessing an unknown vehicleâ€™s contribution can not logically be interpreted as entitling the owner or operator to an uninsured motorist claim.Â  Both this court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have addressed the witnessing requirement accordingly.\r\nIn Shealy v. Doe, this court found that two men who had been thrown from the back of a swerving pick-up truck were not entitled to recover under the driverâ€™s uninsured motorist policy.Â  370 S.C. 194, 634 S.E.2d 45 (2006).Â  The affidavits submitted by these two men stated that the driver of the pick-up truck told them that he had swerved to avoid colliding with an unknown vehicle.Â  Id. at 197, 634 S.E.2d at 46.Â  This court held these affidavits â€œdo not attest to facts they perceived, but merely restate the perceptions of the vehicleâ€™s operator.â€Â  Id. at 200, 634 S.E.2d at 48.Â  Additionally, this court stated that the affidavits were from two people who apparently did not witness the accident.Â  Id.Â  Clearly, these two men thrown from the truck witnessed the accident itself.Â  In fact, there was no accident until they were thrown from the truck and landed on the roadway.Â  Thus, this court was clearly construing â€œwitnessing the accidentâ€ to mean â€œwitnessing the events leading to the accident.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn Gilliland v. Doe, Gilliland, after crashing into a tree and sustaining significant injuries, alleged she was run off the road by an unknown vehicle.Â  357 S.C. at 198, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  No one other than Gilliland witnessed the unknown vehicle.Â  Another driver, Gayle Norris, was waiting to enter the roadway when she observed Gilliland round a curve in the road and crash.Â  Id. at 198-99, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Norris never saw a second vehicle, but did observe two sets of headlights, and observed the second set of headlights â€œarcing through a fieldâ€ as if the second vehicle was making a u-turn and leaving the accident scene.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Gilliland court entertained an analysis of whether circumstantial evidence could be used to satisfy the independent witness requirement.Â  If Norrisâ€™s witnessing the accident alone were enough, then the Court would not have performed an analysis to determine if circumstantial evidence was appropriate evidence to be used in documenting the events leading to the accident.Â  Further, the Supreme Court agreed with this courtâ€™s earlier characterization of the Â§38-77-170(2) requirement.Â  Both courts found that the independent witness must â€œbe able to attest to the circumstances surrounding the accident, i.e. what actions of the unknown driver contributed to the accident.â€Â  Id. at 201, 592 S.E.2d at 628 (quoting Gilliland v. Doe, 351 S.C. 497, 501-02, 570 S.E.2d 545, 548 (Ct. App. 2002)).Â  The Supreme Court found this analysis â€œconstitutes a fair interpretation of the ambiguous fact requirement of Â§38-77-170(2).â€Â  Gilliland, 357 S.C. at 201, 592 S.E.2d at 628. \r\n \r\nI find the critical query in these matters is not whether an independent witness has observed the actual accident itself, but rather it is whether an independent witness has observed evidence of an unknown vehicle causing bodily injury or property damage to the insured.Â  To find otherwise could create absurd results.Â  One could reasonably foresee an independent witness who clearly observes an unknown vehicle create a hazard but be prevented from attesting to these facts because just prior to the accident he lost sight of the vehicles as they rounded a bend in the road.Â  In situations where an independent witness observes evidence of an unknown vehicleâ€™s contribution to the accident, I fail to see the necessity of observing the accident itself.Â  This is especially true in light of the purpose of Â§38-77-170(2).Â  This statute was enacted to protect insured drivers from damages caused by unknown drivers while maintaining safeguards against fraudulent claims.Â  Gilliland, 357 S.C. at 199, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Our Supreme Court has instructed that legislative intent must be construed only after reading each of the statutes contained in the same act together.Â  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989).Â  This court has noted â€œthe uninsured motorist legislation is remedial in nature, enacted for the benefit of injured persons, and is to be liberally construed so that the purpose intended may be accomplished.â€ Â Franklin v. Devore, 327 S.C. 418, 421, 489 S.E.2d 651, 653 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Having established this interpretation of the witness requirement, I next endeavor to ascertain the propriety of using circumstantial evidence to establish the events leading to the accident.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nWhile none of the affiants utilized by Bradley observed the actual accident itself, Bradley attempts to rely upon the circumstantial evidence created by their observations.Â  As noted above, the South Carolina Supreme Court, in the Gilliland opinion, undertook an analysis of whether circumstantial evidence could be used to satisfy the independent witness requirement of Â§38-77-170(2).Â  The Court found â€œ[t]he attending circumstances along with direct testimony may be taken into account by the jury in arriving at its decision as any fact in issue may be established by circumstantial evidence, if the circumstances, which must themselves be proven lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty.â€Â  Gilliland, 357 S.C. at 202, 592 S.E.2d at 629 (emphasis added) (quoting Marks v. Indus. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 212 S.C. 502, 505, 48 S.E.2d 445, 446 (1948)).Â  The Court held that Norrisâ€™s statements regarding seeing two sets of headlights and what appeared to be an unknown vehicle making a u-turn were supportive of Gillilandâ€™s testimony and contained circumstantial evidence which created â€œa question of fact as to causation for the jury.â€Â  Gilliland, 357 S.C. at 202, 592 S.E.2d at 629.Â  The juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Gilliland was reinstated.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n \r\nLastly, I recognize temporal and spatial restrictions exist when seeking to utilize circumstantial evidence.Â  One can reasonably foresee attempts to utilize circumstantial evidence which was gathered a significant amount of time or distance from the accident itself, and I note these instances must be addressed under the peculiar facts of each individual accident.Â  In this matter, both Bosley and Bradley stated they left Waffle House shortly after 3 a.m..Â  Bosley stated he drove approximately one-quarter of a mile, swerved to avoid a large trash bag in the road, and then observed a street sweeper truck drop a similar garbage bag onto the road about one-quarter of a mile from the first trash bag.Â  Bradley stated he swerved to avoid the same first trash bag Bosley had seen and crashed his vehicle only minutes after Bosley had left the Waffle House.Â  Shortly after the accident, at approximately 3:15 a.m., Lieutenant Colonel Douglas also observed the large trash bag in the road when he stopped to assist Bradley.Â  All of these events took place over a maximum time period of less than fifteen minutes and the second trash bag was dropped approximately one-quarter of a mile from the accident.Â  I find this evidence falls within temporal and spatial requirements.\r\n \r\nThe closeness in time between Bosleyâ€™s and Douglasâ€™s observations of the trash bag on the road and the time of Bradleyâ€™s accident, and the closeness in time and proximity between the accident and Bosleyâ€™s observation of the street sweeper truck dropping a similar trash bag onto the roadway are relevant.Â  These circumstances elevate the notion of an unknown driver contributing to Bradleyâ€™s accident from mere speculation to plausible circumstantial evidence.Â  Accordingly, I find this circumstantial evidence is sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury as to the issue of causation.Â  Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from such evidence in the light most favorable to Bradley, I find sufficient circumstantial evidence exists to warrant a trial in this matter.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n[1] Ernest Bradley is joined by his wife Ester as â€œAppellants,â€ and John Doe is joined by Accusweep, Inc. as â€œRespondents.â€Â  However, for purposes of this appeal, we refer only to Ernest Bradley and John Doe.\r\n \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Bradley does not argue that hitting the trash bag constituted physical contact with the unknown vehicle.Â  However, even if the trash bag did, in fact, fall from the sweeper truck, Bradleyâ€™s collision with it would not meet section 38-77-170â€™s physical contact requirement.Â  Our supreme court has held the physical contact requirement is not met when a plaintiffâ€™s vehicle collides with an unattached portion of an unknown vehicle.Â  See Â Â Wynn v. Doe, 255 S.C. 509, 180 S.E.2d 95 (1971); Davis v. Doe, 285 S.C. 538, 331 S.E.2d 352 (1985).\r\n[4] A subsequent 1989 amendment to Â§38-77-170, instituted the requirement to prominently display on the face of the affidavit the specific language â€œA FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THIS AFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4275","title":"Neal v.

Scarborough, Special Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4275\r\nHeard October 10, 2006 â€“ Filed July 13, 2007\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Michael A. Molony and Lea B. Kerrison, of Charleston, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Andrew K. Epting, Jr., Clayton B. McCullough, and Leslie S.\r\n          Riley, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â Â Â Â Â Â  This appeal arises out of\r\n  David Nealâ€™s second permit application for a dock.Â  Neal\r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the Office of Ocean and Coastal\r\n  Resource Managementâ€™s (OCRMâ€™s) Coastal Zone Management\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s (Appellate Panelâ€™s) decision that had the effect of denying him the dock permit.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1997, three adjacent\r\n  parcels of land, located at 111 Hibben Street (the property), in Mount Pleasant, were conveyed to Neal Brothers, Inc., a company in which Neal was a part\r\n  owner. Â Â The three parcels had all been owned by the McIver family since 1930.Â \r\n  The property had a five foot wide by one hundred and nineteen foot long strip\r\n  connecting the inland property to Charleston Harbor.Â  Neal had the property\r\n  surveyed as required by his title insurance company prior to purchase.Â  The\r\n  survey, which indicated the three parcels were one lot, was recorded at the\r\n  Charleston County Register of Mesne Conveyances on September 10, 1997.Â  Shortly\r\n  after it was recorded, Neal Brothers transferred title of the property to\r\n  Tompkins and Company, LLC (Tompkins).[1]Â  \r\nIn 1998, Neal\r\n  first applied for a critical area permit to build a\r\n  dock off of the propertyâ€™s five feet of waterfront access.Â  OCRM denied the\r\n  first application stating: â€œYour dock is proposed to extend from a 5â€™ wide\r\n  access path.Â  This lot was apparently replatted in February, 1997 as a\r\n  combination of 3 lots.Â  As such, this lot does not meet the minimum lot width\r\n  standard in order to qualify for a single family dock.â€Â  Neal initially\r\n  appealed the denial, but the appeal was dismissed without prejudice after an\r\n  agreement with OCRM that allowed Neal to reapply for a permit.Â  \r\nIn September\r\n  1999, Amy Willis, the property owner adjacent to the property, filed suit\r\n  against Neal and Tompkins, claiming ownership of the five feet by one hundred and\r\n  nineteen feet strip of land extending from the property to Charleston Harbor.Â  The disputed property included Tompkinsâ€™ five feet of waterfront access.Â  The\r\n  trial court examined both chains of title, moved the property line nine inches,\r\n  but otherwise determined the property in question belonged to Tompkins in fee\r\n  simple absolute.\r\nIn June 2001, Neal applied a second time for a critical area permit to build a dock off of the five\r\n  feet of waterfront access. Â At the time Neal applied for the second dock\r\n  permit, the regulation controlling dock permits provided:\r\n\r\n  For lots platted\r\n    and recorded after May 23, 1993, before a dock will be permitted, a lot must\r\n    have 75 feet of water frontage along the marsh edge and at least 75 feet of\r\n    frontage between extended property lines. . . .Â  Lots less than 50 feet wide\r\n    are not eligible for a dock.[2]\r\n\r\n23A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(o) (Supp. 2001).Â  OCRM granted the permit application despite much public\r\n  opposition, including from property owners adjacent to Neal.Â  One of those\r\n  adjacent owners, Don Brown, appealed the issuance of the permit to the\r\n  administrative law court (ALC), arguing the property was not platted and\r\n  recorded in its current form until 1997, and therefore, it must comply with regulation\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(o) (the regulation).Â  \r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before the ALC.Â  Nealâ€™s neighbors, Brown and Willis, testified\r\n  regarding their opposition to the dock.Â  In addition to his own testimony, Neal\r\n  presented the testimony of Richard Chinnis, the Director of Regulatory Programs\r\n  at OCRM.Â  Chinnis testified that he drafted the regulation that was adopted by\r\n  the General Assembly.Â  Chinnis stated that he was incorrect in his initial\r\n  belief that the property had been â€œresubdividedâ€ when he denied Nealâ€™s first\r\n  application for a permit to build a dock.Â  Chinnis also testified that OCRM\r\n  interpreted the regulation as applying to lots subdivided into smaller lots\r\n  after the effective date.Â  Because the property had existed in its present form\r\n  since the early 1900s, with no â€œresubdivision,â€ Chinnis testified that OCRM\r\n  determined that the regulation did not apply to the property and granted Nealâ€™s\r\n  second application for a dock permit.Â  When asked by the ALC to specifically define\r\n  how he interpreted â€œplatted and recordedâ€ in evaluating Nealâ€™s permit\r\n  application, Chinnis stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  The wording in the court case . . . the basis that his lot\r\n    had existed in its present form.Â  When somebody buys a . . . every time Iâ€™ve\r\n    bought a house, the lots had to be replatted.Â  The lot wasnâ€™t recreated as a\r\n    new lot, it was just replatted as a result of some financial arrangement or\r\n    final recording.Â  Mr. Nealâ€™s lot obviously was platted after â€™97, but it was\r\n    the same lot that had existed for 30, 40, 50 years.Â  So it wasnâ€™t a new lot, it\r\n    was created and originally platted and recorded.\r\n\r\nThe ALC agreed with OCRMâ€™s interpretation of the regulation.Â \r\n  Looking to Dorman v. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 350\r\n  S.C. 159, 565 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 2002),[3] the\r\n  ALC found the regulation would only prohibit docks from properties with less\r\n  than seventy-five feet of water frontage, or prohibit shared docks from\r\n  properties with less than fifty feet of water frontage, if the property was\r\n  platted and recorded after the effective date, May 23, 1993.Â  The ALC further\r\n  determined that the regulation applied to properties platted and recorded after\r\n  May 23, 1993, only as a result of a subdivision of property.Â  The ALC reasoned\r\n  that â€œ[t]he term â€˜platted and recordedâ€™ assumes the platting and recording\r\n  involves a change in the configuration of the property.â€ Â The ALC concluded\r\n  â€œ[t]o assume otherwise would lead to an absurd resultâ€ because when property\r\n  owners, who had owned property in the same configuration for many years, recorded or rerecorded a plat of their\r\n  property at any time after May 23, 1993, they would be subject to the seventy-five feet requirement.Â \r\n  The ALC also determined if the regulation applied to any platting and recording,\r\n  it would prevent the construction of a dock for a purchaser of a lot that\r\n  formerly qualified for a dock because a survey and plat are normally required\r\n  for title insurance at the time of purchase. Â The ALC further found that\r\n  if a lot was recorded prior to May 23, 1993, even if it was never platted before\r\n  the date, the regulation would not apply.Â  Finally, the ALC noted that the\r\n  construction of a small dock from Nealâ€™s property would not detrimentally\r\n  affect the neighborsâ€™ property values or use and enjoyment of their own\r\n  property in violation of regulation 30-11(B)(10).[4]Â  Accordingly, the ALC affirmed OCRMâ€™s\r\n  issuance of the permit because the regulation did not apply to the property.Â  \r\nBrown appealed the ALCâ€™s ruling to the Appellate Panel.Â \r\n  The Appellate Panel correctly described its scope of review and determined the\r\n  ALC erred in its â€œinterpretation of [the regulation] by concluding that 75 feet\r\n  of frontage was not required in order for [Neal] to receive a private\r\n  recreational dock permitâ€ and reversed the ALCâ€™s order.Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  order did not contain any findings of fact.Â  \r\nNeal then appealed the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling to the\r\n  circuit court, which affirmed.Â  The circuit court found the property had been\r\n  platted and recorded more than one time after May 23, 1993; therefore, the regulation\r\n  applied to the property and a new dock was impermissible because the propertyâ€™s\r\n  waterfront footage was less than both the seventy-five foot and fifty foot\r\n  requirements.Â  The court found that the Neal property could not enjoy\r\n  â€œgrandfatheredâ€ status with regard to the regulation.Â  Finally, the court found\r\n  a dock would interfere with neighborsâ€™ value, use, and enjoyment of their\r\n  property.Â  Neal filed a motion for reconsideration claiming the circuit court\r\n  impermissibly made findings of fact.Â  The circuit court denied the\r\n  motion for reconsideration and issued a new order reiterating its decision and declaring\r\n  that its previous order did not include findings of fact. Â This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn contested permitting cases, the ALC serves as the finder\r\n  of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2006); Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410,\r\n  417 (2002); Dorman, 350 S.C. at 164, 565 S.E.2d at 122.Â  On appeal to\r\n  the Appellate Panel, the standard of review is whether the ALCâ€™s findings are\r\n  supported by substantial evidence pursuant to section 1-23-610(C) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).

App. 2004), cert. denied (Feb. 15, 2006).Â  Thus,\r\n  the Appellate Panel can reverse the ALC if the findings are not supported by\r\n  substantial evidence or are based on an error of law.Â  Dorman, 350 S.C.\r\n  at 165, 565 S.E.2d at 122.Â  The ALCâ€™s findings are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence if, looking at the record as a whole, there is evidence from which\r\n  reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion the administrative agency\r\n  reached.Â  Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 353,\r\n  461 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995).Â Â  \r\nJudicial review of the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision to the\r\n  circuit court is governed by section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005), which provides:\r\nThe court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\n  agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.

Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).[5]Â  This section also governs our review\r\n  of the circuit courtâ€™s decision. Â South Carolina Coastal\r\n      Conservation League v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363\r\n  S.C. 67, 73, 610 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2005); Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560\r\n  S.E.2d at 413.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Application of the Regulation \r\nNeal\r\n  argues the ALC correctly found that the regulation, and thus the width\r\n  limitations for a dock, do not apply to the property because the property was\r\n  not â€œplatted and recordedâ€ after May 23, 1993.Â  Thus, he asserts, the circuit\r\n  court erred in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s reversal of the ALCâ€™s decision.Â \r\nWe agree.\r\nGenerally, â€œ[c]ourts defer to the relevant administrative agencyâ€™s\r\n  decisions with respect to its own regulations unless there is a compelling\r\n  reason to differ.â€Â  South Carolina Coastal Conservation\r\n    League, 363 S.C. at 75, 610 S.E.2d at 486; see Dunton v. South Carolina Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353\r\n  S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987) (â€œThe construction of a statute by the agency charged\r\n  with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and\r\n  will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€); Dorman,\r\n  350 S.C. at 167, 565 S.E.2d at 123-24 (finding the portion of the Appellate Panelâ€™s order construing its regulation was proper). Â \r\nIf a statuteâ€™s terms are clear, the court must apply the terms\r\n  according to their literal meaning. Â Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health\r\n    &amp; Envtl. Control, 348\r\n  S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002).Â  â€œAn appellate court cannot construe a statute without regard to\r\n  its plain meaning and may not resort to a forced interpretation in an attempt\r\n  to expand or limit the scope of a statute.â€Â  Id.Â  While the appellate court\r\n  usually defers to the Appellate Panelâ€™s construction of its own regulation,\r\n  where the Appellate Panelâ€™s interpretation is contrary to the plain language of\r\n  the regulation, the court will reject its interpretation.Â  Id. at 515, 560 S.E.2d at 414.Â  \r\nNevertheless, â€œ[a]ll rules of statutory construction are\r\n  subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be\r\n    construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998)(emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  â€œHowever plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute\r\n  may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a\r\n  result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the\r\n  Legislature . . . .â€Â  Id.Â Id. Â \r\nThe central question in this case is whether the property\r\n  was â€œplatted and recordedâ€ prior to May 23, 1993.Â  However, the terms â€œplatâ€\r\n  and â€œsurveyâ€ are used interchangeably throughout this record.[6]Â  Thus, before determining the issues\r\n  at hand, we take this opportunity to distinguish the terms.Â  Generally, a\r\n  â€œsurveyâ€ is the process of determining the actual boundaries of a particular\r\n  piece of property.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1445 (6th ed. 1990). Â A\r\n  â€œsurveyâ€ can also be the result of a determination of boundary lines of a\r\n  particular piece of property reduced to writing, such as in a map.Â  Id.; see Overstreet v. Dixon, 131 S.E.2d 580, 583 (Ga. App. 1963)\r\n  (holding that a survey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and\r\n  its contents ascertained and is also a statement of or a paper showing the\r\n  result of the survey with the courses and distances and quantity of the land). Â \r\nA\r\n  â€œplat,â€ on the other hand, is generally a map of a piece of property or a plan of\r\n  more than one piece of property as laid out in a subdivision and with reference\r\n  to lots, streets, and block numbers.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1151 (6th\r\n  ed. 1990) (defining â€œplatâ€ as a â€œmap of a specific land area such as a town,\r\n  section, or subdivision showing the location and boundaries of individual\r\n  parcels of land subdivided into lots, with streets, alleys, easements, etc.,\r\n  usually drawn to scaleâ€).Â  Although not specifically defined as such in this\r\n  state, many jurisdictions have defined â€œplatâ€ as a document signifying the\r\n  subdivision of property or the dedication of property for a particular use.Â  See Sellon v. City of Manitou Springs, 745 P.2d 229, 234 (Colo. 1987)\r\n  (holding that the term â€œplatâ€ as used in a zoning ordinance referred to a\r\n  subdivision map); N. Indiana Pub. Serv. Co. v. McCoy, 157 N.E.2d 181, 184\r\n  (Ind. 1959) (holding that a plat is a division of land into lots, streets, and\r\n  alleys by means of a representation on paper so that they can be identified); Gannett\r\n    v. Cook, 61 N.W.2d 703, 707 (Iowa 1953) (holding that a plat is not a deed\r\n  but is a subdivision of land into lots, streets, and alleys marked upon the\r\n  earth and represented upon paper).Â  Thus, we find that, generally, a â€œplatâ€ is\r\n  a map of a piece of property or an area of land subdivided into lots.Â  \r\nCertainly,\r\n  the terms â€œplatâ€ and â€œsurveyâ€ are interrelated.Â  Notwithstanding their common\r\n  usage, the terms are not synonymous.Â  See State v. Bilbao,\r\n  943 P.2d 926, 928 (Idaho 1997) (noting that â€œrecords of surveyâ€ and â€œplatsâ€ are\r\n  not synonymous because the recording of a subdivision plat is intended to\r\n  partition property while a record of survey is not intended to serve as\r\n  evidence or notice that a landowner is seeking to partition the tract into lots).\r\nWith\r\n  those definitions in mind, we turn to the present case.Â  We find the circuit\r\n  court erred by not reversing the Appellate Panel and reinstating the order of\r\n  the ALC.Â  The â€œclear termsâ€ of the regulation include the words â€œplatted and\r\n  recordedâ€ with no further definitions or qualifications.Â  Although it would\r\n  appear to bar Nealâ€™s dock application because a survey was made of his property\r\n  and recorded after the effective date of the regulation, we agree with the ALC\r\n  that interpreting â€œplatted and recordedâ€ in this manner would lead to absurd\r\n  results.Â  It would mean that an owner of property that would qualify for a dock\r\n  permit under this regulation could be divested of this opportunity simply by\r\n  having a survey performed and recorded at the insistence of a title insurance\r\n  company when getting a second mortgage or at the urging of a court when a\r\n  neighbor institutes a boundary dispute.Â  It is apparent from the testimony of\r\n  Richard Chinnis, drafter of the regulation and the person in charge of\r\n  interpreting it at OCRM, that the word â€œplatâ€ as used in the regulation was\r\n  intended to indicate a subdivision of property, not the mere recordation of a\r\n  survey.Â  This evidence supports the ALCâ€™s determination of the legislative\r\n  intent of the regulation.Â  \r\nThe ALCâ€™s determination of the legislative intent is\r\n  further supported by the General Assemblyâ€™s decision to amend the regulation.Â \r\n  After Nealâ€™s hearing in front of the ALC and prior to the Appellate\r\n  Panel issuing its order in the present case, the regulation was amended to replace the words â€œplatted and recorded after May 23,\r\n  1993,â€ with the words â€œsubdivided or resubdivided after May 23, 1993.â€Â  23A S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(1)(o) (Supp. 2006).Â  Reference to the General\r\n  Assemblyâ€™s subsequent amendment of a statute can be considered clarification of\r\n  the legislative intent.Â  Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 276, 625 S.E.2d\r\n  636, 640 (2006) (noting that a subsequent statutory amendment may be\r\n  interpreted as clarifying statutory intent); Stuckey v. State Budget &amp; Control\r\n    Bd., 339 S.C. 397, 401, 529 S.E.2d 706, 708 (2000) (â€œA subsequent statutory\r\n  amendment may be interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent.â€); Cotty\r\n    v. Yartzeff, 309 S.C. 259, 262 n.1, 422 S.E.2d 100, 102 n.1 (1992) (noting\r\n  that the courtâ€™s interpretation of the statute was supported by subsequent\r\n  amendments to the statute which clarified the legislative intent).Â  Â Â Â \r\nThere was substantial evidence to support the ALCâ€™s factual\r\n  findings that the regulation applied only to lots subdivided after the\r\n  effective date.Â  The subsequent amendment of the regulation to specify its\r\n  application only to lots â€œsubdivided and resubdividedâ€ further clarifies the General\r\n  Assemblyâ€™s intent and supports the ALCâ€™s findings.Â  Despite the fact that the\r\n  propertyâ€™s water frontage was less than both the seventy-five foot and the\r\n  fifty foot requirements, the property in question qualified for a dock prior to\r\n  May 23, 1993, and had not been subdivided into smaller lots after that date.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the regulation did not apply to the property and should not bar\r\n  Nealâ€™s dock permit application.Â  \r\nAlthough the Appellate Panel is free to interpret OCRMâ€™s\r\n  regulations and this interpretation is normally entitled to deference, we find\r\n  there are compelling reasons to disregard the Appellate Panelâ€™s interpretation\r\n  of the regulation in this case.Â  South\r\n    Carolina Coastal Conservation League, 363\r\n  S.C. at 75, 610 S.E.2d at 486 (holding that the Appellate Panel,\r\n  not OCRM staff, is normally entitled to deference in interpreting its own regulations\r\n  â€œunless there is a compelling reason to differâ€).Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s order\r\n  merely states that it was reversing the ALC because it misinterpreted the\r\n  seventy-five foot requirement for awarding Neal a dock permit.Â  The order does\r\n  not explain how the ALC made an error of law.Â  See Brownlee v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 327 S.C. 119, 128, 641 S.E.2d 45, 49\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (noting that absent an explanation by the Appellate Panel of\r\n  why it believed the ALJ erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of\r\n  Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) or of why the facts supported the Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of the regulation, the court could find no error of law meriting\r\n  reversal of the ALJ). Â Â \r\nThe ALC correctly found that the word â€œplat,â€ as used in\r\n  this regulation, refers to a subdivision of property.Â  The ALCâ€™s interpretation\r\n  of the regulation is supported by substantial evidence and does not amount to\r\n  an error of law.Â  Thus, we find the circuit court erred in affirming the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision to reverse the order of the ALC.\r\nII.Â \r\n  Circuit Courtâ€™s Findings of Fact\r\nNeal also\r\n  contends the circuit court applied the wrong standard of review in its order by\r\n  making its own findings of fact.Â  We agree. \r\nAs previously\r\n  discussed, the ALC serves as the finder of fact in environmental permitting\r\n  cases, and the Appellate Panelâ€™s standard of review is whether the ALCâ€™s\r\n  findings are supported by substantial evidence.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2006); Brown, 348 S.C. at 520, 560 S.E.2d\r\n  at 417; Dorman, 350 S.C. at 164, 565 S.E.2d at 122.Â  The circuit court\r\n  has a limited scope of review, and it cannot consider issues that were not\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the Appellate Panel.Â  Kiawah Resort Assocs. v.\r\n    South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 505, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995) (â€œAs\r\n  such, the circuit court, like this Court, has a limited scope of review, and\r\n  cannot ordinarily consider issues that were not raised to and ruled on by the\r\n  administrative agency.â€).Â  \r\nThe Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s order did not make any findings of fact or even reference the findings\r\n  of fact by the ALC with which it disagreed.Â  The Appellate Panel merely stated\r\n  that the ALC erred in determining that seventy-five feet of water frontage was\r\n  not required for Neal to receive a dock.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order makes many\r\n  new â€œfindings of factâ€ that were not even addressed by the Appellate Panel and\r\n  were in direct conflict with the facts found by the fact finder, the ALC.Â  The\r\n  circuit court readily acknowledged in its order that it was deciding some\r\n  matters not considered by the Appellate Panel.Â Â  \r\nNeal points to\r\n  the following examples where the court made new findings:Â  (1) the circuit\r\n  court found that a plat was never recorded showing the Neal property as one\r\n  parcel until 1997; (2) the court found that Nealâ€™s own expert took a position\r\n  in the litigation adverse to Neal; and (3) the court found that Nealâ€™s dock\r\n  would be too close to the adjoining landownersâ€™ property and would impact the\r\n  neighbors value, use, and enjoyment.Â  With the possible exception of the first\r\n  example, these findings directly conflict with the findings by the ALC.Â \r\n  Further, the Appellate Panel did not rule on the questions of experts or the\r\n  impact on adjoining landownersâ€™ property.Â  While there may be some evidence in\r\n  the record to support the circuit courtâ€™s findings, the court is not entitled\r\n  to make findings when reviewing an appeal from the Appellate Panel.Â  The\r\n  courtâ€™s only considerations are whether:Â  there has been a violation of the\r\n  statute; the agency has exceeded its authority; the agency made a decision upon\r\n  an unlawful procedure; the decision was affected by an error of law; the\r\n  decision was clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence of record;\r\n  or the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision was characterized by an abuse of discretion. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005). Â \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  review is limited to matters decided by the Appellate Panel.Â  Because the Appellate\r\n  Panel only determined the ALC erred in its interpretation of the seventy-five\r\n  foot requirement found in the regulation, the circuit courtâ€™s review was\r\n  limited to this consideration.Â  Since the circuit court went on to make new\r\n  factual findings based on the record and rule on matters not decided by the\r\n  Appellate Panel, we find the circuit court erred in exceeding its scope of\r\n  review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record to support the\r\n  ALCâ€™s finding that the regulation did not bar Nealâ€™s dock permit application\r\n  because the property was not subdivided, and the property had been in the\r\n  current configuration since owned by the McIvers prior to 1940.Â  Thus, the\r\n  surveys conducted thereafter did not amount to having the property â€œplatted and\r\n  recordedâ€ under the regulation.Â  Further, the circuit court erred in reviewing\r\n  the record and making new findings of fact on matters not decided by the\r\n  Appellate Panel.Â  We find the Appellate Panel erred in reversing the ALC, and\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit\r\n  court upholding the Appellate Panelâ€™s order isÂ Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\n  Â GOOLSBY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion. Â \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.\r\n  (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent and would uphold, as did the circuit\r\n  court, the reversal by the Appellate Panel of the order of the Administrative Law Court that affirmed the issuance by the Office of Ocean and Coastal\r\n  Resource Management of a dock permit to the respondent David Neal.Â  The\r\n  relevant part of the regulation at issue provides, â€œFor lots platted and\r\n  recorded after May 23, 1993, before a dock will be permitted, a lot must have\r\n  75 feet of water frontage along the marsh edge . . . .â€[7]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(o) (Supp. 2001).Â  Inasmuch as Neal possesses\r\n  only five feet of frontage and platted and recorded his lot in 1997, the plain\r\n  language of the regulation applies and serves to proscribe issuance of the dock\r\n  permit that he seeks. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Neal is a controlling member and agent of Tompkins.Â \r\n[2] The regulation has been amended several times.Â  The\r\n  relevant part of the regulation currently reads, â€œThis section applies\r\n  to lots subdivided or resubdivided after May 23, 1993. . . . (i) To be eligible for a private, community or commercial\r\n  dock, a lot must have:Â  (a) 75 feet of frontage at the marsh edge, and . . . (iii)\r\n  Lots less than 50 feet wide are not eligible for a dock.â€Â  23A S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(1)(o) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\n[3]Â  In Dorman, this court found the regulation\r\n  only barred docks at properties that were less than seventy-five feet and less\r\n  than fifty feet wide where the lots were platted and recorded after May 23,\r\n  1993.Â  Dorman, 250 S.C. at 167, 565 S.E.2d at 123 (â€œBy its clear terms,\r\n  this subsection is inapplicable to this lot and does not prohibit the issuance\r\n  of a dock permit in this case.â€).\r\n[4]Â  This section requires general consideration by the\r\n  OCRM of how any project would potentially affect the value and enjoyment by\r\n  neighboring property owners in a critical area.Â  23A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-11(B)(10) (Supp. 2006). \r\n[5]Â  This section was amended, effective July 1, 2006, to\r\n  provide for an appeal from the Appellate Panel directly to this court.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (A)(1) (Supp. 2006).Â  The amended section also renumbered\r\n  the language of prior section 1-23-380 (A)(6) (2005) to section 1-23-380(A)(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  However, the underlying appeal proceeded under the prior version\r\n  of this section from the Appellate Panel to the circuit court and then to this\r\n  court.Â  Thus, the judicial review is controlled by the prior version, section\r\n  1-23-380 (A)(6) (2005). \r\n[6]Â  One witness at the hearing before the ALC, real\r\n  estate attorney Kenneth C. Krawcheck, was asked if there was a difference\r\n  between the terms.Â  He replied:Â  â€œPractically, not very much.Â  They look\r\n  identical.Â  A survey could be said to be any drawing of a piece of property,\r\n  whereas a plat is a document intended for recordation or actually recorded.Â \r\n  But the terms are used somewhat interchangeable.â€Â Â  \r\n[7] As the majority opinion points out, this regulation\r\n  has been amended several times.Â  See supra note 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4276","title":"McCrosson v.

Wife, who has a masterâ€™s degree in education, was\r\n  teaching elementary school, and Husband, who is now an orthopedic surgeon, was\r\n  finishing his education at the Medical University of South Carolina.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  dating for approximately eighteen months, the parties married on April 8, 1995.Â  Although Wife initially informed the family court in an affidavit\r\n  submitted at the temporary hearing that the parties had a â€œhealthy and normal\r\n  sexual relationship,â€ all the evidence at trial, including Wifeâ€™s testimony,\r\n  contradicts that initial statement.Â  In fact, the partiesâ€™ sexual\r\n  incompatibility plagued the couple throughout the marriage.\r\nDuring the first year of marriage, Wife taught elementary school\r\n  while Husband was a medical resident.Â  Wife became pregnant that year and quit\r\n  her job during the summer of 1996 so that she could be a stay-at-home mother\r\n  for Matthew, who was born on August 12, 1996.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1999, the parties moved to New York so Husband could complete his residency in\r\n  orthopedics.Â  While in New York, Wife met a man named Max while at Barnes &amp;\r\n  Noble with Matthew, who was three years old at the time.Â  Wife befriended Max,\r\n  and ultimately the two had a sexual affair.Â  Wife admitted that she would\r\n  either leave Matthew with a babysitter or with Husband while she secretly met\r\n  with Max.Â  Husband suspected the affair, especially after he found\r\n  incriminating emails between Wife and Max.Â  Husband confronted Wife about his\r\n  suspicions, and Wife denied having sex with Max but admitted having an\r\n  â€œemotional affair.â€Â  A serious argument between Husband and Wife ensued, and Wife\r\n  not only threatened to leave the marriage but actually packed her bags.Â  Both\r\n  parties agree the argument ended with Husband apologizing profusely and asking\r\n  that they â€œstart overâ€ and try to make the marriage work.Â  \r\nIn October\r\n  of 2000, Wife again told Husband she did not want to be married.Â  The couple\r\n  went to counseling for the first time, in an effort to salvage their marriage.Â \r\n  Two months later, Wife gave birth to the partiesâ€™ second child, Anna Madden.Â \r\n  Despite this happy event, Husband and Wifeâ€™s marriage continued to\r\n  deteriorate.Â  \r\nBy this\r\n  time, Husbandâ€™s income had increased significantly.Â  In February 2001, the\r\n  parties hired Annie Carter to help clean the home and Valerie Turner to help\r\n  watch the children.Â  Valerie quit around December of 2002, and Annie began\r\n  working two days a week, spending half of her time cleaning and half of her\r\n  time caring for the children.[1]Â \r\n  Annie testified that, at one point, she suspected Wife was having an affair\r\n  because she spent so much time away from home.Â  Annie also noted that Wife was\r\n  more reserved with Anna Madden and â€œnever even played with her.â€ As between the\r\n  two parties, Annie believed Husband was the more nurturing parent.Â  \r\nIn January 2002, the parties purchased a second home in\r\n  McClellanville, which was on deep water (the Shellmore residence). After moving\r\n  into the home, Wifeâ€™s HIV-positive cousin,[2] Matthew Madden, was released from prison after serving nine years for murder.Â \r\n  Wife wanted her cousin to move into the partiesâ€™ home so that he could have a\r\n  fresh start.Â  Annie Carter was relieved from her duties because Matthew Madden\r\n  was going to take care of the home.Â  Husband testified that he was apprehensive\r\n  about the arrangement, but he acquiesced in an effort to make Wife happy.Â \r\n  However, Husband insisted Matthew Madden leave the home when Husband learned\r\n  Wife was leaving the children unsupervised in his care. \r\nIn July of 2002, the parties continued to try to salvage their\r\n  relationship by attending marriage counseling with Alice Timmons.Â  When the issue\r\n  of Husbandâ€™s lingering suspicions of Wifeâ€™s infidelity came up, Wife continued\r\n  to deny ever having an affair.Â  \r\nIn August of 2002, Valerie Turner returned to the partiesâ€™ home\r\n  and worked twenty hours a week.Â  The parties left their children in Valerieâ€™s\r\n  care while they were out of town for the weekend.Â  When the parties returned,\r\n  they learned that someone had stolen their checkbook and attempted to negotiate\r\n  those stolen checks.Â  The perpetrator was a gentleman Valerie had invited to\r\n  the partiesâ€™ home while she was caring for the children.Â  The parties also\r\n  found an empty condom wrapper stuffed behind a cushion of the couch in the\r\n  childrenâ€™s playroom.Â  Wife contacted Valerie, who admitted having the man over to\r\n  the house, but denied having sex with him. Â After hearing Valerieâ€™s apology, as\r\n  well as her explanation that the condom wrapper had simply fallen out of her\r\n  purse, Wife wanted to give Valerie a second chance and continue using her as\r\n  the childrenâ€™s nanny. Husband, however, demanded Valerie be fired, which\r\n  ultimately happened. \r\nAfter Valerie was fired, Wife received a phone call from a woman\r\n  who was considering hiring Valerie as a nanny.Â  Wife lied about the reason\r\n  Valerie had been fired, explaining instead that Valerie was let go simply\r\n  because the parties were going through a divorce and Wife could no longer\r\n  afford a nanny.Â  \r\nDuring the partiesâ€™ marriage, Husband was not only concerned about\r\n  Wifeâ€™s past infidelity, but he also grew suspicious of Wifeâ€™s relationship with\r\n  a female friend, Adrienne. Â Husband confronted Wife about his suspicions, which\r\n  ultimately resulted in the partiesâ€™ separation.\r\nDuring the separation, the parties\r\n  attempted to reconcile and pursued counseling, this time with Acton Beard.Â \r\n  During these counseling sessions, Wife again denied ever being unfaithful to\r\n  Husband.Â  At trial, Wife admitted she had been untruthful when she denied the\r\n  affair, but that Max â€œwas never an issue in [the] marriage after [she promised\r\n  to stop seeing him] . . . even in marriage counseling, it wasnâ€™t like it was\r\n  concentrated on.â€Â  She explained that she was too terrified to admit the affair\r\n  to counselors for fear it would ruin the marriage.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  February of 2003, Husband met with Ken and Mary Ann Caldwell.Â  Ken was a\r\n  partner in Husbandâ€™s orthopedics practice, and Ken and Mary had previously been\r\n  the partiesâ€™ Sunday school teachers.Â  The Caldwells convinced Husband that\r\n  Wifeâ€™s behavior could be forgiven, and Husband called Wife to discuss the\r\n  possibility of reconciling. Â The parties talked on the phone over the course of\r\n  several days and eventually they went to church together.Â  They spent the day\r\n  at the Shellmore residence with the children, and they both spoke openly about\r\n  the problems in the marriage.Â  Husband explained that he did not like Wifeâ€™s\r\n  relationship with Adrienne, even if nothing sexual was occurring between them. Â Wife\r\n  assured Husband that she and Adrienne were not sleeping together, but Wife\r\n  finally confessed to her affair with Max.Â  After this admission and a long\r\n  conversation, Husband and Wife had sex.[3]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  partiesâ€™ reconciliation was short-lived.Â  Husband testified that after their\r\n  reconciliation weekend, Wife told all of her friends and family that she and\r\n  Husband had sex and he had forgiven her.Â  However, when Husband tried to see\r\n  Wife again, she declined to see him.Â  The following weekend Husband took the\r\n  children to Virginia for a previously planned ski trip.Â  On the drive home, he\r\n  called Wife and left a message on her voicemail.Â  When she returned the call,\r\n  the caller I.D. was blocked.Â  Wife said she was in the car with her sister.Â \r\n  More phone calls with a blocked I.D. followed, and Husband inquired why that\r\n  was happening.Â  Wife eventually admitted that she was actually at home with Adrienne.[4] Â Shortly upon his return to South Carolina, Husband filed for divorce.\r\nAt a temporary hearing, the parties were\r\n  awarded true joint custody of their children. Â Husband had the children from\r\n  Thursday afternoon to Monday morning, and Wife had the children for the\r\n  remainder of the week.[5]Â \r\n  Summers were split equally between the parties, and Husband was ordered to pay\r\n  $2,000 per month in child support, in addition to paying the mortgage,\r\n  utilities, and phone services for both marital homes.Â  Husband was also ordered\r\n  to pay for the childrenâ€™s educational expenses. \r\nDuring\r\n  the eighteen months that elapsed between the complaint being filed and the\r\n  final hearing, Wife had two more confirmed affairs.Â  However, she never\r\n  withdrew her request for alimony.Â  One affair was a â€œone-night standâ€ with â€œRhett,â€\r\n  a man she met at the beach.Â  The other was a longer term relationship with a\r\n  man named Darren Kerr.Â  At her deposition, Wife denied the affair with Rhett,\r\n  but she admitted it at trial.Â  She explained that she was afraid to tell the\r\n  truth about Rhett because it might cause her to lose custody of the children.Â  As\r\n  for Darren Kerr, the family court found Wife in contempt of court for going to\r\n  the Christmas parade with Darren and her daughter, Anna Madden. Â The family\r\n  court also found Wife in contempt of court for violating a consent order which\r\n  prohibited her from exposing the children to an alcoholic friend of Wifeâ€™s who\r\n  had recently been arrested for driving her car into her boyfriendâ€™s house.[6] \r\nThe\r\n  final hearing was a lengthy, twelve-day trial that was heard piece-meal over an\r\n  eight month period.Â  Numerous witnesses testified on behalf of both parties.Â \r\n  Husbandâ€™s witnesses portrayed him as an involved and loving father who was\r\n  committed to putting his children before work. Wifeâ€™s witnesses portrayed her\r\n  as a model mother who took an active role in her childrenâ€™s school and church\r\n  life. \r\nAlthough\r\n  Husband acknowledges that Wife was the primary caretaker of Matthew during his\r\n  early years, Husband testified that Wifeâ€™s attitude towards motherhood and her capabilities\r\n  as a parent changed remarkably when the parties moved to New York.Â  According\r\n  to Husband, after Anna Madden was born, Wife suffered from post-partum\r\n  depression and never seemed to bond with their daughter.Â  Husband also asserts\r\n  that Wife used daycare excessively in order to pursue her own private life.Â \r\n  Husband explained that he was at a point in his career where he had the luxury\r\n  of setting his own hours and that he could easily arrange his schedule around\r\n  the childrenâ€™s needs.Â  \r\nWife\r\n  claims that she has always been the primary caretaker of the children, and\r\n  unlike Husband, whose number one priority is work, her life has revolved around\r\n  the children.Â  Wife also claims that the great majority of the time she spent\r\n  out of the home was for child-centered activities, such as being Matthewâ€™s room\r\n  mother and chairing the schoolâ€™s Halloween carnival.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  guardian ad litem, Stephen Dey, filed a lengthy and thorough report.Â  In the\r\n  report, the guardian explained that he first believed that Husbandâ€™s claims\r\n  about Wife were farfetched and that he found Wife to be charming and sincere.Â \r\n  However, after spending more time with both parties, he learned Wife tended to\r\n  answer questions untruthfully.Â  She admitted to lying about her affair with Max\r\n  and lying about going out with her sister when in fact Adrienne was at the\r\n  house.Â  She also admitted that she lied to another parent regarding the\r\n  circumstances of Valerie Turnerâ€™s termination.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  guardian also expressed concern over Wifeâ€™s ability to parent based on her\r\n  handling of an incident during the partiesâ€™ separation. While the children were\r\n  in Wifeâ€™s custody, Wife took the dog outside one evening, and Anna Madden, who\r\n  was not quite three years old, climbed out of her crib and walked out of the\r\n  house.Â  Wife soon realized Anna Madden was missing and called the police.Â  Anna\r\n  Madden was found within fifteen minutes at a neighborâ€™s house.Â  Wife never told\r\n  Husband about their daughterâ€™s â€œescapeâ€ even though Husband lived on deep\r\n  water.Â  The guardian explained that he was not so concerned about Anna Madden\r\n  being lost, as scary things like that can happen to the best of parents, but\r\n  was more worried by Wifeâ€™s failure to reveal the incident to Husband because\r\n  she did not want it to hurt her custody case. \r\nThe\r\n  guardian also noted that even though Wife reported being â€œheartbrokenâ€ when the\r\n  children were in Husbandâ€™s care, she had Anna Madden in full-time, five days\r\n  per week daycare even after joint custody was ordered.Â  When the guardian asked\r\n  Wife about this, she said she did it because that is what the temporary order\r\n  required.Â  The temporary order does not contain any directive requiring\r\n  full-time daycare.\r\nThe\r\n  guardian expressed concern that Wife made the partiesâ€™ son, Matthew, feel\r\n  uncomfortable because she would interrogate him about what had transpired while\r\n  the children were in Husbandâ€™s care.Â  The guardian and the childrenâ€™s\r\n  therapist, Karen Tarpey, spoke to both parties about protecting the children\r\n  from such inquiries.\r\nAfter\r\n  the guardian filed his initial report, one of Wifeâ€™s best friends, Michelle\r\n  Crossland, contacted the people the guardian had interviewed and asked them if\r\n  they wanted to correct anything the guardian reported.Â  Ms. Crossland\r\n  personally delivered a letter to Annie Carter, the partiesâ€™ former nanny and\r\n  housekeeper, who provided some of the most unfavorable information regarding\r\n  Wife.Â  The letter was hand-delivered while Annie was working at a home of Ms.\r\n  Crosslandâ€™s friend.Â  Despite receiving this letter, Annie testified that the guardian\r\n  had accurately summarized her views.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Wife accused the guardian of being biased.Â  She alleged that he told her\r\n  she should settle the case in favor of Husband because no sitting judge would\r\n  rule against Husbandâ€™s attorney, whose wife is a family court judge.[7]Â  Wife also claims the guardian told\r\n  her the case would likely be heard by one of two Berkeley County judges, â€œboth\r\n  of whom are reputed to be unlikely to award custody to a litigant if any\r\n  adultery or other morality issues are raised.â€ Â The guardianâ€™s version of what\r\n  he told Wife is much different.Â  According to him, he met with both parties,\r\n  with the blessing of their attorneys, after mediation failed.Â  Apparently,\r\n  there was miscommunication regarding Husbandâ€™s settlement offer, and both\r\n  attorneys agreed the guardian would be in the best position to clear up that\r\n  miscommunication.Â  The guardian claims he spoke with both parties separately\r\n  prior to trial.Â  During that communication, he explained where they were in the\r\n  litigation process. Â He told them that if they went to trial it would most\r\n  likely be in front of an out of county judge because Husbandâ€™s attorney is\r\n  married to a Charleston County judge.Â  The guardian admitted that he told the\r\n  parties theirs was not the kind of case he would want to bring in front of a\r\n  judge.Â  He also talked with the parties about the concept of â€œfair.â€Â  He\r\n  explained that what is fair to one may be unfair to the other and that if\r\n  either wanted fair, he or she would have to â€œgo out to Ladsen because they have\r\n  a fair in October.â€Â  The guardian apologized for making this flippant remark,\r\n  but again stressed that he was trying to persuade the parties to consider\r\n  mediation, as both partiesâ€™ attorneys urged him to. \r\nNotably,\r\n  at trial, Wife blamed the guardianâ€™s bias as the reason she did not inform\r\n  Husband of Anna Maddenâ€™s escape.Â  However, Anna Madden was lost in October of\r\n  2003, and the guardian did not have the above conversation with Wife, to which\r\n  she attributes his bias, until December of 2003.[8]\r\nAfter\r\n  the trial, the family court granted primary custody to Wife and ordered Husband\r\n  to pay $5,500 per month in child support.Â  In the order, the family court noted\r\n  â€œconcernâ€ regarding statements Wife alleged the guardian had made and the\r\n  family court found â€œthese statements tend to impune [sic] both the Judiciary\r\n  and the entire Judicial System.â€Â  For that reason, it appears the family court\r\n  judge gave little if any weight to the guardianâ€™s report.Â  In addition to\r\n  granting Wife primary custody, the family court ordered the marital property be\r\n  divided fifty-fifty[9] between the parties and ordered Husband to pay $100,000 towards Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.[10]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten\r\n  v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 615 S.E.2d 98 (2005).Â  In spite of this broad\r\n  scope of review, we remain mindful that the family court judge saw and heard\r\n  the witnesses and generally is in a better position to determine credibility.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Child\r\n  Custody\r\nHusband\r\n  first argues the family court erred in awarding Wife primary custody of the\r\n  children.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that the family court had favorable findings with regard to each\r\n  partyâ€™s parenting ability.Â  As to Wife, the court found:\r\n\r\n  Since Matthewâ€™s birth, [Wife] has not\r\n    worked outside of the home and seemed to devote significant time and energy to\r\n    matters related to the childrenâ€™s activities. Â She has been very engaged in the\r\n    childrenâ€™s school activities, being a room mother and also volunteering and\r\n    participating in a variety of activities and events at the childrenâ€™s schools.Â \r\n    This has continued to be true during the pendency of this action. Â This Court\r\n    is satisfied that the children are happy and well cared for when in [Wifeâ€™s]\r\n    care and know how much she loves them.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the family court commended Husband as a parent:\r\n\r\n  [Husband] is also a dedicated and loving\r\n    parent.Â  While [Husbandâ€™s] time with Matthew was somewhat limited during the\r\n    first two years after Matthewâ€™s birth due to the demands of the Husbandâ€™s\r\n    residency program, I find that [Husband] was a â€œhands onâ€ parent even during\r\n    those early years and has become ever increasingly involved in all aspects of\r\n    the childrenâ€™s lives.Â  Credible testimony was provided by neighbors, Matthewâ€™s\r\n    soccer coach and others who testified as to their observations of [Husbandâ€™s]\r\n    healthy, instructive, and nurturing relationship and interactions with the children.Â \r\n    The children are clearly happy and well cared for while in [Husbandâ€™s] care.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina law is clear that when considering child custody, neither parent has any\r\n  right paramount to the right of the other.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 21-21-10.Â  The tender\r\n  years doctrine, a legal principle favoring mothers over fathers in custody\r\n  disputes, was abolished by statute over a decade ago.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1525 (Supp. 2005).Â  When making a determination regarding custody, a\r\n  parentâ€™s gender is of no significance.Â  Kisling v. Allison, 343 S.C.\r\n  674, 678, 541 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Rather, the best interests of\r\n  the children are the paramount and controlling consideration in all custody\r\n  controversies.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  To determine what is in the childrenâ€™s best interests, courts\r\n  should consider the â€œcharacter, fitness, attitude and inclination on the part\r\n  of each parent as they impact on the child.â€Â  Parris v. Parris, 319 S.C.\r\n  308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1985).Â  Additionally, courts should consider how\r\n  the custody decision will impact all areas of the childâ€™s life, including\r\n  â€œpsychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, and recreational\r\n  aspects.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  awarding Wife primary custody, the family court concluded:\r\n\r\n  [Wife] has been the childrenâ€™s primary\r\n    caretaker for the majority of their lives . . . .Â  [Wife] has demonstrated\r\n    parenting skills superior to those of [Husband] and even though Husband states\r\n    that he will be devoting less time to his career and more time to the family,\r\n    his career is such that he will be busy and by necessity will be away from the\r\n    children at odd hours.Â  Husband is career centered while Wife is child\r\n    centered.Â  [Wife] has shown that she is well suited to meet the childrenâ€™s\r\n    needs, paying consideration to the ages of the children, and Husband has shown\r\n    an inability to trust.Â  . . .Â  Wife has demonstrated Christian values of\r\n    forgiveness, repentance, and tolerance while Husband has failed to demonstrate those\r\n    same attributes as they pertain to his Wife.Â  Finally, I find that [Wife] is\r\n    most likely to encourage a healthy ongoing relationship between the children\r\n    and [Husband].Â  Husband still maintains that Wife is wicked and immoral,\r\n    continues to maintain that Wife is a lesbian and continues to hang on to hate\r\n    and anger, refusing to take responsibility for his part of the break down in\r\n    the marital relationship. \r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  an exhaustive review of the record, we find no support for the majority of\r\n  these findings by the family court.Â  Although Wife did not work outside the\r\n  home and may have been the childrenâ€™s primary caretaker when they were infants,\r\n  there was ample evidence that her role in the childrenâ€™s lives diminished as\r\n  they grew older.Â  Both children began attending daycare when they were two\r\n  years old, and prior to the partiesâ€™ separation, they had hired a nanny to work\r\n  in their home twenty hours a week.Â  Wife admitted that she used a babysitter on\r\n  at least one occasion so that she could meet with Max, and Annie Carter, who\r\n  had worked in the partiesâ€™ home for fifteen months, observed that Wife spent a\r\n  significant amount of time away from the home.Â  Even during the pendency of the\r\n  litigation, when Wife only had the children three nights a week, she continued to\r\n  have Anna Madden in full-time, five-days-a-week preschool.Â  When asked by the\r\n  guardian why she chose full-time preschool, Wife contended that the temporary\r\n  order required it; however, there was no such requirement in the order.Â Â Â \r\n  Furthermore, at the time of the final hearing, the parties had been operating\r\n  under a joint custody arrangement for eighteen months, so the amount of time\r\n  each party spent with the children had equalized.Â  \r\nThe record also does not support the family courtâ€™s finding that\r\n  Husbandâ€™s career will require him to work at odd hours.Â  Husbandâ€™s testimony,\r\n  as well as the testimony from his medical assistant, indicated that Husband\r\n  would be able to perform surgeries while the children were in school.Â  In fact,\r\n  during the period of time when the parties operated under the temporary order,\r\n  Husband often took Fridays off so that he could be with Anna Madden during the\r\n  day rather than sending her to preschool.Â  \r\nAs for the family courtâ€™s admiration of Wifeâ€™s â€œChristian value of\r\n  repentance,â€ we are not as impressed.Â  Wife denied her affair with Max for\r\n  several years, and she did not admit to sleeping with Rhett until she was on\r\n  the stand, after having already perjured herself on the subject. Â Furthermore,\r\n  adultery was a major issue in the case because Wife never withdrew her request\r\n  for alimony.Â  Under such circumstances, we are sympathetic to Husbandâ€™s\r\n  struggle to forgive.[11]Â \r\n  While we do believe it is important for divorced parents to foster, not\r\n  sabotage, their childrenâ€™s relationship with the other parent, there is no\r\n  indication that Husbandâ€™s inability to forgive Wifeâ€™s affairs hindered the\r\n  childrenâ€™s relationship with Wife.Â  To the contrary, the guardian reported that\r\n  it was Wife who made the partiesâ€™ son feel uncomfortable because she would\r\n  interrogate him about what had transpired while the children were in Husbandâ€™s\r\n  care.Â  At trial, Husband testified he would â€œdo everything within [his] power\r\n  to foster a loving relationship between [Wife] and the children for the rest of\r\n  [his] life.â€\r\nFinally, we disagree with the finding that Husband did not take\r\n  responsibility for his part in the marital break-up.Â  After the parties argued\r\n  about Wifeâ€™s relationship with Max while they still lived in New York, it was\r\n  Wife who packed her bags and was ready to leave the relationship and Husband\r\n  who begged forgiveness and asked her to stay.Â  Furthermore, it was Husband who\r\n  contacted Wife in February of 2003 and initiated the brief period of\r\n  reconciliation between the parties.Â  Even during the trial, Husband testified\r\n  that he was â€œ[g]ravely sorry if there [was] something that [he] could have done\r\n  better.â€ \r\nâ€œIn determining the best interest of the child[ren], the court\r\n  undertakes the awesome task of looking into the past and predicting which of\r\n  the two available environments will advance the best interest of the child and\r\n  bring about the best adjusted mature individual.â€Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271\r\n  S.C. 136, 142, 245 S.E.2d 612, 615 (1978).Â  Looking at the partiesâ€™ past\r\n  behavior, we have serious concerns regarding Wifeâ€™s judgment as a parent and\r\n  her ability to raise well-adjusted, mature children.\r\nThe family court listed a number of examples where each party\r\n  showed poor judgment in â€œchild related subjects and circumstances.â€Â  Motherâ€™s list included such alarming\r\n  behavior as failing to notify Father that the partiesâ€™ daughter had â€œescapedâ€\r\n  from her crib, ventured outside, and had been lost for approximately fifteen\r\n  minutes one evening; violating the temporary orderâ€™s prohibition against having\r\n  the children around a paramour; violating a consent order prohibiting her from\r\n  having the children around an alcoholic friend of hers who was facing criminal\r\n  charges; and hiring her cousin, a convicted murderer who was HIV positive, as\r\n  the childrenâ€™s nanny.Â  Mother also wanted to give a â€œsecond chanceâ€ to Valerie\r\n  Turner even though compelling evidence suggested Valerie had sexual relations\r\n  in the childrenâ€™s playroom with a man who stole and later tried to negotiate\r\n  blank checks he acquired while in the partiesâ€™ home.Â  When another parent\r\n  called seeking a reference for Valerie, Mother was dishonest about the circumstances\r\n  under which Valerie was fired and provided a positive recommendation, thus\r\n  putting an innocent child at risk. \r\nHusbandâ€™s list of â€œpoor judgmentâ€ contained much less serious\r\n  mishaps.Â  While in Husbandâ€™s care, the partiesâ€™ son received a cut while\r\n  playing with a PVC pipe with his friend, and on another occasion, the son cut\r\n  his feet on oyster shells while walking barefoot at Husbandâ€™s home.Â  The son\r\n  also was bruised when he was hit near the eye with a paintball while Husbandâ€™s medical\r\n  assistant was watching the children.Â  The partiesâ€™ daughter received burns to\r\n  her fingertips when she accompanied Father to a hunt club and placed her hand\r\n  on either a furnace or fire barrel; she also extensively cut her own hair when\r\n  left unattended while in Fatherâ€™s care. Â Â Husbandâ€™s list revolves more around every day accidents that\r\n  happen to most children while growing up than it does poor parental\r\n  decision-making skills.\r\nIn\r\n  addition to Wifeâ€™s poor judgment with regard to child related issues, we are\r\n  deeply troubled by the number of times Wife was caught lying during the\r\n  litigation.Â  The family court listed seven instances that reflected negatively\r\n  upon Wifeâ€™s credibility: (1) the perjury she committed when she lied about her\r\n  affair with Rhett during a deposition; (2) her being in contempt of court three\r\n  times,[12] two of which involved instances where she exposed the children to people she\r\n  was ordered not to; (3) her complaint during direct examination that she never\r\n  had a weekend with the children since the issuance of the temporary order; (4)\r\n  the statement from her initial affidavit wherein she claimed to have a â€œhealthy\r\n  and normal sexual relationshipâ€ with Husband; (5) her dishonesty, even to her\r\n  own therapist, about her relationship with Max; (6) her testimony that she\r\n  continually tried to reconcile with Husband up until March 2004, when in fact,\r\n  she had two admitted adulterous affairs during that time; and (7) her lying\r\n  about the circumstances of Valerieâ€™s termination when she was called as a\r\n  reference.\r\nAfter\r\n  listing Wifeâ€™s credibility problems, the family court went on to list twelve\r\n  instances in which it found Husband was not credible: (1) his allegation that\r\n  Wife traveled extensively, when evidence revealed she had only been alone on\r\n  vacation for twelve days during the marriage; (2) his claim that Wife suffered\r\n  from sex addiction, which the family court found was untrue; (3) his allegation\r\n  that Wife had a lesbian relationship with Adrienne; (4) his accusation that\r\n  Wife was in and out of counseling for many years and on antidepressants, which\r\n  the family court found was misleading; (5) his statement that Wife had no\r\n  concerns about leaving the children in daycare so that she could travel; (6)\r\n  his denial of knowing how Wife obtained a sex toy; (7) his statement that Wife\r\n  told him about several sexual encounters with girls when she was a teenager;\r\n  (8) his allegation that Wife drank excessively; (9) his accusation that Wife\r\n  has psychiatric problems based on physical violence, atypical sexual behavior,\r\n  depression, and significant alcohol consumption; (10) his claim that Wife did\r\n  not like to do housework or to cook; (11) his suggestion that Wife may have\r\n  been molested as a child; and (12) his allegation that Wife had slapped the\r\n  children in anger. \r\nWe find\r\n  that although Husbandâ€™s list is longer, very few items, if any, actually impact\r\n  Husbandâ€™s credibility.[13]Â \r\n  Many of the examples on the list surround his belief that Wife had sexually\r\n  deviant tendencies, which the family court found were not true.Â  While Husband\r\n  may be incorrect in his conclusions about Wife, it is unfair for his\r\n  credibility to be impugned simply because he harbors these suspicions,\r\n  especially in light of Wifeâ€™s history of being untruthful and having\r\n  extra-marital affairs. \r\nWhile the family court is generally in the better position to\r\n  determine a partyâ€™s credibility, where there are numerous confirmed instances\r\n  of a partyâ€™s dishonesty, as there are here, we believe a reviewing court may\r\n  have the advantage because it can consider the facts of a case without being\r\n  distracted by an emotionally charged trial.Â  After thoroughly reviewing this\r\n  3,000-plus page record, the bulk of which revealed a web of deceit woven by\r\n  Wife, the family courtâ€™s order awarding Wife primary custody came, quite\r\n  frankly, as a surprise twist ending.Â  To reach such a conclusion, the family\r\n  court not only adopted Wifeâ€™s version of events as opposed to Husbandâ€™s, but\r\n  also relied on her word over that of witnesses with nothing to gain from the\r\n  courtâ€™s decision.Â  For instance, the family court completely discredited the\r\n  guardianâ€™s testimony simply based on Wifeâ€™s allegations that the guardian was\r\n  biased, even though Wife had already perjured herself for the admitted purpose\r\n  of strengthening her case for custody.Â  The guardian, on the other hand, had no\r\n  vested interest in the case other than protecting the childrenâ€™s best\r\n  interests.Â  He has been a family court practitioner for thirty years, and the\r\n  record revealed no history of him being untruthful.Â  Moreover, Wife never moved\r\n  to have the guardian removed from the case because of his alleged bias.\r\nBased\r\n  on the concerns addressed above regarding Wifeâ€™s parental judgment and lack of\r\n  credibility coupled with the well-supported and unappealed findings of the\r\n  family court regarding Husbandâ€™s ability to care for the children, we reverse\r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision awarding Wife primary custody.Â  We adopt the\r\n  visitation plan set forth in the family courtâ€™s final order, except that\r\n  Husband is the primary custodian, and Wife receives the visitation schedule\r\n  originally given to Husband.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Child\r\n  Support\r\nHusband\r\n  next argues the family courtâ€™s award of $5,500 per month in child support was\r\n  excessive.Â  Because we reverse the custody arrangement and Husband does not\r\n  seek any child support from Wife in this action, we need neither address the\r\n  excessiveness of the support ordered nor remand this issue for recalculation.\r\nIII. Equitable\r\n  Distribution\r\nHusband\r\n  also argues the family court erred in effectuating the fifty-fifty division of\r\n  marital property.Â  Specifically, Husband argues the value of the Shellmore\r\n  residence, which he received in the division, should have been reduced by a six\r\n  percent real estate commission because the family court knew this asset was\r\n  being sold.Â  Husband also argues the family court overvalued the partiesâ€™ boat\r\n  by $6,000.Â  We find these issues regarding valuation are not preserved for\r\n  review because Husband failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion addressing these\r\n  issues.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54-55\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that the wifeâ€™s argument regarding the family courtâ€™s\r\n  valuation of marital property was not preserved for appellate review because\r\n  she failed to point out the alleged error to the family court in her Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion).\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s\r\n  Fees\r\nFinally,\r\n  Husband argues that if we reverse the custody determination, we should also\r\n  reverse the award of $100,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider\r\n  four factors: (1) the partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own attorneyâ€™s fee; (2)\r\n  the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective\r\n  financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s\r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812\r\n  (1992).Â  When the family court finds an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is justified,\r\n  the amount of fees should be determined by considering: (1) the nature, extent,\r\n  and difficulty of the services rendered; (2) the time necessarily devoted to\r\n  the case; (3) counselâ€™s professional standing; (4) the contingency of\r\n  compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal\r\n  fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991); Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 65, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 489, 499 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When a partyâ€™s beneficial results are\r\n  reversed on appeal, the attorneyâ€™s fee award must also be reconsidered. See Rogers v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 334, 540 S.E.2d 840, 842\r\n  (2001).\r\nWe recognize that even though our opinion erases Wifeâ€™s beneficial\r\n  results, the other three E.D.M. factors for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  weigh in Wifeâ€™s favor due to Husbandâ€™s superior financial position.Â  However,\r\n  in attempting to determine the amount of fees to award based on the factors set\r\n  forth in Glasscock, we come to the inescapable conclusion that no amount\r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees is warranted. \r\nIn her brief, Wife admits the â€œoverwhelming amount of time at\r\n  trial was devoted to the issue of child custody.â€Â  Wife did not receive\r\n  beneficial results with regard to this issue, especially considering Husbandâ€™s\r\n  offer of settlement, in which he agreed to share equal time with the children,\r\n  pay $2,000 per month in child support, and pay rehabilitative alimony.[14] Â We note that all of the attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees for which Wife requested reimbursement were incurred after Wifeâ€™s\r\n  rejection of Husbandâ€™s settlement offer.Â  Furthermore, the other factors to be\r\n  considered, such as the time devoted to the case and the difficulty of the\r\n  case, were exacerbated by Wifeâ€™s refusal to withdraw her request for alimony\r\n  despite her three extra-marital affairs.Â  \r\nBased on these considerations, we find Wife is not entitled to any\r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find Husband is\r\n  better suited to have primary custody of the partiesâ€™ two children.Â  We\r\n  therefore reverse the family courtâ€™s order with regard to custody and child\r\n  support.Â  We further find Wife is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because she\r\n  no longer received beneficial results and much of the litigation expenses are\r\n  attributable to her own actions.Â  Finally, we find Husbandâ€™s arguments\r\n  regarding the valuation of marital property are not preserved for our review.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nBEATTY\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] At one point, Wife claimed Annie was not a nanny.Â \r\n  Later, however, Wife testified that Annie was not a good housekeeper but was a\r\n  great child care provider.Â  Wife also testified at one point that Annie was not\r\n  terminated, but she quit, and at another point she said she was terminated.Â  \r\n[2] We note this fact because it was one of several\r\n  reasons Husband was wary of Matthew Madden being used as the childrenâ€™s\r\n  caretaker.\r\n[3] Husband testified that after the parties had disrobed\r\n  and he was about to engage in intercourse with Wife, she giggled and said, â€œI\r\n  guess this takes care of Max.â€Â  Wife denies this.\r\n[4] Wife admits she lied to Husband about being out with\r\n  her sister, but claims she told Husband this because she was upset that he had\r\n  not informed his mother of the partiesâ€™ reconciliation.Â  Because she was upset\r\n  with Husband, Wife did not want him to come to her house.Â  According to Wife,\r\n  Adrienneâ€™s presence in the home was coincidental, as she had merely stopped by\r\n  to look at some exercise equipment Wife was selling.\r\n[5] Wife complained about this arrangement because\r\n  Husband had the children over the weekend and she had the children during the\r\n  school week.Â  She said that she had to beg Husband for extra time with the\r\n  children and complained that she never had a weekend with the children after\r\n  the temporary order was issued.Â  When confronted with calendars on cross\r\n  examination, Wife admitted Husband had allowed her numerous weekends with the\r\n  children.\r\n[6] Wife was also held in contempt for failing to pay\r\n  Husbandâ€™s attorney for fees related to a motion to compel.\r\n[7] At trial, Mark Andrews represented Husband.Â  Mr.\r\n  Andrews is married to Judge Frances Segars-Andrews, a family court judge in Charleston.\r\n[8] Incidentally, the guardian did not find out about\r\n  Anna Madden being lost until Husband mentioned it in February of 2004.Â  Husband\r\n  explained he had not said anything before because he did not want it to have a\r\n  chilling effect on Wifeâ€™s decision to report incidents like that in the future.\r\n[9] Husband contends that even though the family court\r\n  ordered a fifty-fifty division, the way in which the marital estate was divided\r\n  resulted in Wife receiving ninety percent of the assets.Â  These issues\r\n  regarding valuation are addressed below.\r\n[10] Our court superseded the family courtâ€™s final order\r\n  upon Husbandâ€™s petition.Â  We reinstated the joint custody arrangement\r\n  established in the temporary order, reduced Husbandâ€™s child support to $2,000\r\n  per month, and ordered the appeal be expedited. \r\n[11] The partiesâ€™ Christian religion was a major theme\r\n  throughout the trial.Â  The family courtâ€™s finding regarding Husbandâ€™s inability\r\n  to forgive seems largely based on an entry from Husbandâ€™s prayer journal, which\r\n  was given to Wife in discovery.Â  According to the family court order, Husbandâ€™s\r\n  journal â€œindicates that his desire is to see to it that Wife be broken and\r\n  humbled and pray that the evil does not prevail against him.â€Â  While this\r\n  excerpt may seem harsh when read in isolation, the entire entry actually\r\n  reflects a writer who is desperately hopeful that his marriage might be saved.Â \r\n  The entry reads:\r\nToday\r\n  is the meeting with [Acton] Beard.Â  I pray that I am obedient to Godâ€™s will in\r\n  the meeting.Â  Spirit of love and peace preside.Â  Wisdom for [Acton] Beard,\r\n  myself, and Paige.Â  Paige be broken, humble, honest.Â  Paige see I want to help\r\n  her, not hurt her.Â  Let me receive instruction and rebuke if appropriate.Â  God\r\n  be glorified!Â  Childrenâ€™s interests a priority.\r\n[12] Since the final order, Wife has again been held in\r\n  contempt of court for refusing to sign papers so that Husband could sell the\r\n  Shellmore residence.Â  Thus, Wife has been held in contempt on four occasions\r\n  during this litigation.\r\n[13] Each accusation made by Husband has some support in\r\n  the record, and in his appeal, Husband argues these findings regarding his\r\n  credibility were incorrect.Â  Because it is obvious from the lists themselves\r\n  that the examples regarding Husbandâ€™s lack of integrity were based upon the\r\n  family courtâ€™s determination that Husband failed to prove certain allegations\r\n  against Wife and not based on proven lies told by Husband, we decline to go\r\n  through each finding Husband disputes.Â  Rather, we acknowledge none of the\r\n  examples listed revealed any admitted lies told by Husband, whereas Wifeâ€™s list\r\n  contained numerous conclusively proven instances of her dishonesty.Â  \r\n[14] The parties stipulated that Husbandâ€™s letter of\r\n  settlement was only relevant to the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees and would be\r\n  viewed by the family court only after it had ruled on all other issues.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Goode,\r\n  Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4277\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2007 â€“ Filed July 18, 2007\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Assistant\r\n          Appellate Defender Lanelle C. Durant, of Columbia for Respondent.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster,\r\n          Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General\r\n          Deborah R. J. Shupe and Assistant Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson,\r\n          all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  On July 5, 2005, the State\r\n  commenced an action pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator\r\n  Act (the Act),[1] alleging Kenneth White (White) met the statutory criteria for confinement as a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  Based on the Act, the State sought Whiteâ€™s\r\n  commitment in a secure facility for long-term care, control, and treatment.Â \r\n  The circuit court found no probable cause existed to establish White was a\r\n  sexually violent predator and accordingly dismissed the action.Â  We reverse and\r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\n White has a long history of sexually violent\r\n  behavior toward women.Â  In July 2002, White entered his victimâ€™s home, forced\r\n  her into a bedroom, and used aggravated force to rape her.Â  Based on this\r\n  incident, he was arrested and charged with criminal sexual conduct in the first\r\n  degree.Â  White pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct in the second degree and\r\n  was sentenced to ten years in prison, suspended to six months with a five-year\r\n  probation period. \r\nIn January 2004, White sexually\r\n  assaulted his former girlfriend at his residence.Â  White asked the victim to\r\n  come to his house, but when she arrived, he became increasingly angry with the\r\n  victim for ending their relationship.Â  He then threw her on the bed, choked\r\n  her, and sexually assaulted her.Â  White was again charged with criminal sexual\r\n  conduct in the first degree.Â  White entered a nolo contendre plea to criminal sexual conduct in the third degree and was sentenced to five\r\n  years in prison, suspended to fourteen months with a five-year probation\r\n  period. \r\nBefore Whiteâ€™s release, the\r\n  Director of the Department of Corrections notified the Attorney General and the\r\n  multidisciplinary team that White, as a potential sexually violent predator,\r\n  was to be released from confinement.Â  The multidisciplinary team reviewed his\r\n  case and determined White satisfied the definition of a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  Thereafter, the prosecutorâ€™s review committee reviewed the\r\n  multidisciplinary teamâ€™s recommendation and found probable cause to believe\r\n  White was a sexually violent predator.Â  \r\nBased on the multidisciplinary teamâ€™s and the\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s review committeeâ€™s recommendations, the State filed a petition in\r\n  circuit court to commit White to the South Carolina Department of Mental\r\n  Health.Â  The circuit court found the petition set forth sufficient facts to\r\n  establish probable cause that White met the statutory criteria for commitment.Â \r\n  The circuit court subsequently held a probable cause hearing. \r\nAt the probable cause hearing, in addition to the\r\n  July 2002 and January 2004 convictions, the State attempted to supplement its\r\n  petition with: (1) incident reports showing White repeatedly stalked, sexually\r\n  assaulted, and threatened a third victim over a five-year period, which\r\n  resulted in White being charged and arrested for unlawful use of a telephone,\r\n  harassment, violation of a restraining order, and assault; (2) an incident\r\n  report that charged White with raping a fourth victim whom he had stalked for\r\n  over a year and a half; and (3) a statement from the mother of Whiteâ€™s son who\r\n  claimed their relationship was â€œfilled with lies, deception, control, physical\r\n  and mental abuse, and continued infidelityâ€ and â€œif released, [White] pose[d]\r\n  an extreme danger to society.â€Â  \r\nWhite objected to the introduction of the\r\n  documents detailing these offenses on the grounds that the incidents did not\r\n  result in convictions, and only conduct resulting in criminal convictions may\r\n  be considered under the Act.Â  The circuit court sustained this objection.Â  \r\nIn response, the State argued that even if the\r\n  circuit court considered only Whiteâ€™s two convictions, his conduct met the\r\n  diagnostic criteria for sexual paraphilia as set forth in the fourth edition of\r\n  the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).Â  The State\r\n  then attempted to admit a copy of the definition of sexual paraphilia from the\r\n  DSM-IV into evidence, but White objected, claiming no basis existed to submit\r\n  the document.Â  The State argued because the DSM-IV is a recognized treatise and\r\n  because the Act expressly allows documentary evidence to be considered at a\r\n  probable cause hearing, the document should be admitted.Â  However, the court\r\n  disagreed and sustained Whiteâ€™s objection. \r\nThe circuit court held the State failed to\r\n  establish probable cause to commit White under the Act and dismissed the case.Â \r\n  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBy way of background, the Act\r\n  provides for the involuntary civil commitment of sexually violent predators who\r\n  are â€œmentally abnormal and extremely dangerous.â€Â  Â§ 44-48-20.Â  To determine\r\n  whether a person can be committed as a sexually violent predator under the Act,\r\n  a series of steps must occur.Â  First, the multidisciplinary team, appointed by\r\n  the Director of the Department of Corrections, must determine whether the\r\n  person meets the definition of a sexually violent predator.[2]Â \r\n  Â§ 44-48-50.Â  The multidisciplinary team may rely on the personâ€™s records, which\r\n  â€œinclude, but are not limited to, the personâ€™s criminal offense record, any\r\n  relevant medical and psychological records, treatment records, victimâ€™s impact\r\n  statement, and any disciplinary or other records formulated during confinement\r\n  or supervision.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIf the multidisciplinary team finds\r\n  the person meets the definition of a sexually violent predator, it then refers\r\n  the case to the prosecutorâ€™s review committee.Â  Id.Â  Relying on the\r\n  personâ€™s relevant records and the multidisciplinary teamâ€™s recommendation, the\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s review committee must determine whether probable cause exists to\r\n  commit the person as a sexually violent predator.Â  Â§ 44-48-60.Â  If the\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s review committee determines probable cause is present, the\r\n  Attorney General may file a petition in circuit court to request a probable\r\n  cause hearing.Â  Â§ 44-48-70.\r\nAt the probable cause hearing, the\r\n  court considers the Stateâ€™s petition, which may be supplemented by additional\r\n  documentary evidence or live testimony.Â  Â§ 44-48-80(B).Â  If probable cause\r\n  exists, the person is transferred to a secure facility for evaluation by a\r\n  court-approved qualified expert.Â  Â§ 44-48-80(D).Â  Within sixty days of the\r\n  probable cause hearing, a trial must be conducted, at which the State must\r\n  convince the court or jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  Â§ 44-48-90.Â Â  \r\nThe State first argues the circuit\r\n  court erred when it refused to consider Whiteâ€™s past unadjudicated sexual offenses\r\n  at the probable cause hearing.Â  In response, White argues only conduct\r\n  resulting in criminal convictions may be taken into account at the probable\r\n  cause hearing because the Act is triggered only by such conduct.Â  We agree with\r\n  the State.\r\nThe Act does not specifically\r\n  define whether the circuit court can consider a personâ€™s â€œcriminal offense\r\n  recordâ€ at the probable cause hearing, nor does the Act specify what â€œoffensesâ€\r\n  the circuit court can consider.Â  Â§ 44-48-80.Â  As such, we must first resolve\r\n  whether the circuit court can rely on a personâ€™s criminal offense record.Â  If\r\n  so, we must then determine what offenses the circuit court can permissibly\r\n  consider in its probable cause determination. \r\nIn construing a statute, this Court\r\n  should not consider the particular clause being construed in isolation, but we should\r\n  read the clause in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the\r\n  policy of the law. Â South Carolina Coastal Council v. South Carolina State Ethics Commâ€™n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, 410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991). Â Statutory\r\n  provisions should be given a reasonable construction consistent with the\r\n  purpose of the statute. Â Jackson v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 181, 447 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1994). Â Statutes that are part of the\r\n  same act must be read together. Â Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n  297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989). Â Statutes must be read as a\r\n  whole and sections that are part of the same general statutory scheme must be\r\n  construed together and each given effect, if reasonable. Â Higgins v. State,\r\n  307 S.C. 446, 449, 415 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1992).\r\nThe Act states that a â€œpersonâ€™s\r\n  records,â€ including a â€œpersonâ€™s criminal offense record,â€ may be considered by\r\n  the multidisciplinary team and the prosecutorâ€™s review committee in determining\r\n  whether a person is a sexually violent predator.Â  Â§44-48-50.Â  The Stateâ€™s\r\n  petition, submitted to the circuit court at the probable cause hearing, is\r\n  based in part on the recommendations and reports of the multidisciplinary team\r\n  and the prosecutorâ€™s review committee.Â  Â§Â§ 44-48-50 to -80.Â  The Act does not\r\n  explicitly limit the multidisciplinary team and the prosecutorâ€™s review\r\n  committee to considering only convictions when they make their respective\r\n  decisions.Â  Â§Â§ 44-48-50, 44-48-60.Â  By reading these statutes together, if the\r\n  circuit court can consider the Stateâ€™s petition at a probable cause hearing, it\r\n  follows that the circuit court can likewise consider any prior relevant\r\n  offenses, which may be contained in the Stateâ€™s petition.Â  \r\nBecause the circuit court can take\r\n  into account relevant criminal offenses, we must next determine what offenses\r\n  are appropriate to consider.Â  Based on our review, we find â€œoffenseâ€ to mean\r\n  either (1) convictions and crimes not resulting in convictions or (2) only convictions.Â \r\n  Consequently, this term in the Act is ambiguous. \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory\r\n  interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Hodges\r\n    v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  When a statuteâ€™s\r\n  terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory\r\n  construction, and a court must apply the statute according to its literal\r\n  meaning.Â  Univ. of S. California v. Moran, 365 S.C.\r\n  270, 276, 617 S.E.2d 135, 138 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, when the legislature\r\n  chooses not to define a term in a statute, courts will interpret the term in\r\n  accord with its usual and customary meaning.Â  City of Camden v. Brassell,\r\n  326 S.C. 556, 560, 486 S.E.2d 492, 494 (Ct. App. 1997) (citations omitted).\r\nAs â€œoffenseâ€ is not defined in the\r\n  Act, the termâ€™s customary and usual meaning is instructive in ascertaining the\r\n  legislatureâ€™s intent.Â  Offense is commonly defined as â€œa violation of the law;\r\n  a crime, often a minor one.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 885 (7th ed.\r\n  2000).Â  Further, â€œthe terms â€˜crime,â€™ â€˜offense,â€™ and â€˜criminal offenseâ€™ are all\r\n  said to be synonymous, and ordinarily used interchangeably.â€Â  22 C.J.S. Criminal\r\n    Law Â§ 3 (2007).Â  Distinguished from a crime or offense, a conviction is\r\n  â€œ[t]he act or process of judicially finding someone guilty of a crime [or]\r\n  [t]he judgment . . . that a person is guilty of a crime.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law\r\n    Dictionary 271 (7th ed. 2000).Â  It follows that while a conviction cannot\r\n  occur without the commission of an offense, an offense can occur without\r\n  necessarily resulting in a conviction.Â  As such, both convictions and offenses not\r\n  resulting in convictions can be considered under the Act based on the termâ€™s\r\n  usual and customary meaning.\r\nBecause the legislature fails to\r\n  limit or is silent on whether offenses can include only convictions, we must\r\n  assume the legislature intended to include both convictions and offenses not\r\n  resulting in convictions.Â  Cf. State v. Prince, 335 S.C. 466, 475-76,\r\n  517 S.E.2d 229, 234 (Ct. App. 1999) (In finding that an â€œact of violenceâ€ can\r\n  include an act against property under this Stateâ€™s aggravated stalking statute,\r\n  this Court held, â€œ[T]hat our legislature specifically chose not to define â€˜act\r\n  of violenceâ€™ buttresses our conclusion. Â Had the legislature intended for that\r\n  term to be defined narrowly, it could easily have inserted limiting language. Â Instead,\r\n  there is no limitation on the term. Â We decline to impliedly limit our\r\n  statutory scheme to acts of bodily injury when the legislature expressly did\r\n  not do so.â€).\r\nFurther, our Act is modeled after Kansasâ€™ Sexually Violent Predator Act, so we find Kansasâ€™ treatment of this matter to be\r\n  illustrative.Â  In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 649, 550 S.E.2d 311, 316\r\n  (2001) (stating South Carolinaâ€™s Act is based on Kansasâ€™ Sexually Violent\r\n  Predator Act).Â  In Matter of Hay, the defendant challenged the\r\n  introduction of prior uncharged conduct at his trial for civil commitment as a\r\n  sexually violent predator, claiming it was inadmissible.Â  953 P.2d 666, 677 (Kan. 1998).Â  The Kansas Supreme Court admitted the evidence, finding it was either a\r\n  necessary element of the charged conduct or relevant, despite its prejudicial\r\n  nature, to the ultimate issue.Â  Id.Â  The court held, â€œ[E]vidence of\r\n  prior conduct, charged and uncharged, [is] material evidence in [a sexual\r\n  predator] case.â€Â  Id. at 678.Â  In buttressing its conclusion, the court\r\n  also stated, â€œIn assessing whether an individual is a sexually violent\r\n  predator, prior sexual history is highly probative of his or her propensity for\r\n  future violence.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nSimilarly, our Supreme Court has\r\n  stated that â€œpast criminal history is directly relevantâ€ to proving a person is\r\n  a sexually violent predator.Â  In re Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 206, 577\r\n  S.E.2d 451, 453 (2003).Â  Further, â€œa personâ€™s dangerous propensities are the\r\n  focus of the . . . Act,â€ so admission of previous offenses that are similar to\r\n  one another is proper when directly relevant to the ultimate issue.Â  Corley,\r\n  353 S.C. at 206-07, 577 S.E.2d at 453-54.Â Â  \r\nIn this case, evidence of Whiteâ€™s criminal\r\n  sexual offenses not resulting in convictions was directly relevant to the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s probable cause determination.[3]Â \r\n  Consequently, we find the circuit court erred when it refused to admit Whiteâ€™s\r\n  previous unadjudicated offenses into evidence.\r\nThe State also avers that the\r\n  circuit court erred when it dismissed this action based on its finding that no\r\n  probable cause existed to establish White is a sexually violent predator.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nOn appeal, this Court will not disturb\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding on probable cause unless found to be without\r\n  evidence that reasonably supports the circuit courtâ€™s finding.Â  In re Tucker,\r\n  353 S.C. 466, 470, 578 S.E.2d 719, 721 (2003).Â  \r\nThe State petitioned the circuit\r\n  court to determine whether probable cause existed to believe White was a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  As stated earlier, a â€œsexually violent predatorâ€ is\r\n  a person who (1) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (2)\r\n  suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person\r\n  likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure\r\n  facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â  Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a) &amp;\r\n  (b).Â  \r\nIn this case, it is undisputed that White\r\n  satisfies the first prong of section 44-48-30(1).Â  His previous convictions for\r\n  second and third degree criminal sexual conduct are qualifying offenses under\r\n  the Act.Â  Â§ 44-48-30(2)(b) &amp; (c).Â  Thus, the determinate factor is whether\r\n  he suffers from a mental abnormality such that he is likely to commit acts of\r\n  sexual violence in the future.Â  \r\nAt the probable cause hearing, the State attempted\r\n  to introduce evidence that White suffers from sexual paraphilia[4] based on the diagnostic criteria set forth in the DSM-IV.[5]Â \r\n  We initially note the circuit court properly excluded the DSM-IV as the State\r\n  failed to lay the proper foundation for its admission.Â  The Stateâ€™s attempt to\r\n  introduce a photocopied definition of sexual paraphilia as â€œwhat a doctorâ€™s\r\n  probable diagnosis would beâ€ was improper without additional corroborating\r\n  evidence or testimony from an expert or witness.Â  See Rule 803(18), SCRE (stating that a learned treatise is admissible if â€œestablished\r\n  as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by\r\n  other expert testimony or by judicial notice.â€).Â  To indicate that White\r\n  suffers from the specific sexual disorder of sexual paraphilia without further\r\n  testimony or evidence mandates the exclusion of the DSM-IV.[6]\r\nAlthough the circuit court excluded\r\n  the DSM-IV, the State proffered evidence to establish probable cause.Â  First,\r\n  the State presented Whiteâ€™s two previous convictions, both of which involved\r\n  nonconsenting victims and were of a sexually violent nature.Â  Further, the\r\n  State attempted to introduce numerous documents regarding Whiteâ€™s unadjudicated\r\n  assaults against other nonconsenting female victims.Â  His unadjudicated conduct\r\n  and convictions establish a reasonable basis to believe that White suffers from\r\n  some type of mental abnormality or personality disorder.Â  As such, the second\r\n  prong of section 44-48-30(1) is satisfied.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  finding of no probable cause is not supported by the evidence. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court committed\r\n  reversible error when it excluded the Stateâ€™s evidence regarding Whiteâ€™s past\r\n  unadjudicated offenses.Â  Because the Act does not expressly prohibit the\r\n  introduction of prior offenses that are relevant to determining whether a\r\n  person is a sexually violent predator, it was error to exclude this evidence.Â  \r\nBecause the\r\n  evidence supports a finding of probable cause, we reverse and remand to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  On remand, the circuit court shall direct that White be\r\n  transferred to an appropriate secure facility for evaluation by a\r\n  court-approved qualified expert.Â  \r\nREVERSED and\r\n  REMANDED.[7]\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 et seq. (Supp. 2006).\r\n[2] Under the Act, a â€œsexually violent predatorâ€ is a person who (1) has been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (2) suffers from a mental\r\n  abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.Â  Â§ 44-48-30(1).Â  \r\n[3] In so holding, we are not stating past convictions\r\n  and prior offenses not resulting in convictions that have no bearing on whether\r\n  a person is a sexually violent predator should be admissible.Â  \r\n[4] Sexual paraphilia involves â€œrecurrent, intense\r\n  sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving . .\r\n  . the suffering or humiliation of . . . nonconsenting persons . . . that occur\r\n  over a period of at least 6 months.â€ Â DSM-IV 566 (4th ed. 1994). \r\n[5] The DSM-IV is an authoritative resource in\r\n  diagnosing mental abnormalities and personality disorders.Â  See Moriarty\r\n    v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 334 S.C. 150, 159, 511 S.E.2d 699, 704\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999) (The â€œ(DSM-IV) . . . is a widely used manual by psychiatrists\r\n  to define mental diagnostic categories and is published by the American Psychiatric\r\n  Association.â€).\r\n[6] Despite the exclusion of the DSM-IV, we believe a\r\n  finding of probable cause is consistent with prior South Carolina case law. Â In In re Care and Treatment of Beaver v. State, our Supreme Court stated\r\n  the circuit court erred in holding the State failed to provide sufficient\r\n  evidence to show the defendant suffered from a mental abnormality.Â \r\n  Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that â€œthe Stateâ€™s inability to provide\r\n  mental health evidence does not prevent a finding of probable cause.â€Â  372 S.C.\r\n  272, 278, 642 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2007).\r\n[7] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4278","title":"Bostic v.

(American Home) appeals the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of James Bostic.Â  American\r\n  Home argues the circuit court erred in finding that Bostic satisfied the\r\n  â€œrequestâ€ requirement of the Recording Statutes, specifically sections 29-3-310\r\n  and 29-3-320 of the South Carolina Code, by sending via certified mail a check\r\n  for the payoff amount of his mortgage.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 3, 1977, Bostic entered into a mortgage\r\n  agreement with Security Savings and Loan Association of Florence to secure a\r\n  loan in the amount of $22,475.00, on a parcel of land in Florence.Â  At\r\n  some point during the course of the mortgage, American Home acquired the note\r\n  and became the successor mortgagee. \r\nOn January 26, 2005, Bostic obtained a statement for\r\n  the payoff amount on the loan, which American Home listed as $4,848.23.Â  The\r\n  payoff amount included a â€œrelease feeâ€ and a â€œrecording fee.â€Â  On February 4,\r\n  2005, Bostic sent by certified mail a cashierâ€™s check to the order of American\r\n  Home in the amount of $4,848.23.Â  Three days later, American Home\r\n  received and signed for Bosticâ€™s check.Â  Bostic claimed to have\r\n  contacted American Home numerous times by telephone to inquire about the\r\n  release of the payoff documents.Â  According to Bostic, he was informed that the\r\n  release documents would be sent directly to him and they were in the mail. \r\nOn May 16, 2005, American Home sent Bostic a letter,\r\n  stating the loan â€œhas been paid in full effective 02/11/2005.Â  The payoff\r\n  release documents will be mailed within 60-90 days from this date.â€ Â Another\r\n  letter, with identical wording, was sent by American Home to Bostic on May 18,\r\n  2005.\r\nOn May 31, 2005, Bostic, through counsel, sent\r\n  American Homeâ€™s two locations a certified letter which stated in pertinent\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  As more than 90 days have elapsed since this loan was\r\n    paid off and the mortgage satisfaction has not been provided to Mr. Bostic nor\r\n    filed with the court, you are in violation of Â§29-3-310, S.C. Code Ann.\r\n    (2004).Â  I hereby request that you tender, within thirty days, the mortgage\r\n    satisfaction to our office, along with a penalty check for the amount of\r\n    $11,237.50, which represents half of the amount of the debt secured by the\r\n    mortgage, which Mr. Bostic is entitled to pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. (2004)\r\n    Â§29-3-320.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  June 3 and June 6, 2005, both American Home locations respectively received and\r\n  signed for the two demand letters.\r\nHaving received no further response from American\r\n  Home, Bostic filed a Complaint dated June 14, 2005, in which he alleged the\r\n  following causes of action:Â  (1) violation of section 29-3-310 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code; (2) breach of contact with fraudulent intent; and (3) breach of\r\n  contract.Â  In terms of damages, Bostic sought the statutory penalty\r\n  provided in sections 29-3-310 and 29-3-320, as well as actual and punitive\r\n  damages pursuant to the contract claims.Â  In its Answer, dated September\r\n  16, 2005, American Home generally denied the allegations and asserted that it\r\n  had complied with the statutory provisions by filing Bosticâ€™s mortgage\r\n  satisfaction on August 29, 2005.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed cross-motions for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court issued an order on March 6, 2006,\r\n  in which it granted Bosticâ€™s motion for summary judgment and denied American\r\n  Homeâ€™s motion.Â  Specifically, the court held:\r\n\r\n  The Court finds, as a matter of law, that the\r\n    Plaintiffâ€™s payment of the payoff amount ($4,848.23) which included the\r\n    â€œRelease feeâ€ and â€œFiling fee,â€ which was sent by certified mail, and accepted\r\n    and retained by Defendant, was sufficient to satisfy the request requirement of\r\n    Â§ 29-3-310 S.C. Code Ann. (2004).Â  Additionally, taking the evidence in the\r\n    light most favorable to [American Home], [American Home] failed to comply with\r\n    its own correspondence which stated that the mortgage satisfaction would be\r\n    filed within 60-90 days of May 16, 2005. \r\n  The Court further finds that [American Homeâ€™s] failure\r\n    to file [Bosticâ€™s] mortgage satisfaction until August 29, 2005 constitutes a\r\n    violation of Â§ 29-3-310 S.C. Code Ann. (2004), and subjects [American Home] to\r\n    the statutory penalty section Â§ 29-3-320 S.C. Code Ann. (2004).\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the court ordered the parties to schedule a hearing to determine damages.Â \r\n  American Home appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order.[1]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\r\n  and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there\r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\n  entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v.

Â§ 29-3-310 (2007) (emphasis added).Â  In conjunction, section 29-3-320\r\n  provides the statutory penalty for those mortgagees that fail to comply with section\r\n  29-3-310.Â  Section 29-3-320 states:\r\n\r\n  Any holder of record of a mortgage having received such payment,\r\n    satisfaction, or tender as aforesaid who shall not, by himself or his attorney,\r\n    within three months after such certified mail, or other form of delivery, with\r\n    a proof of delivery, request and tender of fees of office, repair to the proper\r\n    office and enter satisfaction as aforesaid shall forfeit and pay to the person\r\n    aggrieved a sum of money not exceeding one-half of the amount of the debt\r\n    secured by the mortgage, or twenty-five thousand dollars, whichever is less,\r\n    plus actual damages, costs, and attorneyâ€™s fees in the discretion of the court,\r\n    to be recovered by action in any court of competent jurisdiction within the\r\n    State. And on judgment being rendered for the plaintiff in any such action, the\r\n    presiding judge shall order satisfaction to be entered on the judgment or\r\n    mortgage aforesaid by the clerk, register, or other proper officer whose duty it shall be, on receiving such order, to record it and to\r\n    enter satisfaction accordingly.\r\n  Notwithstanding any limitations under Sections 37-2-202 and\r\n    37-3-202, the holder of record of the mortgage may charge a reasonable fee at\r\n    the time of satisfaction not to exceed twenty-five dollars to cover the cost of\r\n    processing and recording the satisfaction or cancellation.Â  If the mortgagor or\r\n    his legal representative instructs the holder of record of the mortgage that\r\n    the mortgagor will be responsible for filing the satisfaction, the holder of\r\n    the mortgage shall mail or deliver the satisfied mortgage to the mortgagor or\r\n    his legal representative with no satisfaction fee charged.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 29-3-320 (2007).\r\nBecause\r\n  our decision in this case requires us to determine what constitutes a â€œrequestâ€\r\n  as referenced in the above-outlined statutes, we are guided by the principles\r\n  of statutory construction.\r\nâ€œSouth Carolina has long recognized the principle that penal\r\n  statutes are to be strictly construed.â€Â  Hinton v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Prob., Pardon, and Parole Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 332, 592 S.E.2d 335, 338\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œFurthermore, even though penal\r\n  statutes are to be strictly construed, â€˜the canons of construction certainly\r\n  allow the court to consider the statute as a whole and to interpret its words\r\n  in the light of the context.â€™â€Â  Rorrer v. P.J. Club, Inc., 347 S.C. 560,\r\n  567, 556 S.E.2d 726, 730 (Ct. App. 2001)(quoting State v. Standard Oil Co.\r\n    of N.J., 195 S.C. 267, 288, 10 S.E.2d 778, 788 (1940)).Â  â€œWe should consider\r\n  not merely the language of the particular clause being construed, but the word\r\n  and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the\r\n  policy of the law.â€Â  Rorrer, 347 S.C. at 567, 556 S.E.2d at 730.\r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and\r\n  give effect to the intent of the Legislature.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of\r\n    Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  â€œThe\r\n  first question of statutory interpretation is whether the statuteâ€™s meaning is\r\n  clear on its face.â€Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559\r\n  S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002). Â If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and\r\n  conveys a clear meaning, then â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\n  needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€ Hodges v.\r\n    Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000). Â The words of the\r\n  statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to\r\n  subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation. Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992).Â  â€œA statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair\r\n  interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers. The\r\n  real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will\r\n  prevail over the literal import of particular words.â€ Sloan v. South Carolina Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606-07\r\n  (2006).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  previously stated, our analysis will be focused on the limited question of what\r\n  constitutes a â€œrequestâ€ within the meaning of the Recording Statutes.Â  Our\r\n  review of this stateâ€™s appellate decisions reveals that there is no case\r\n  specifically addressing this issue.[3]Â  Therefore, we rely on secondary authority for a general\r\n  definition of â€œrequestâ€ and then turn to case law from other jurisdictions\r\n  which discuss the specifics of this term in the context of recording statutes.\r\nThe\r\n  term â€œrequestâ€ as related to the mortgage satisfaction procedure has been\r\n  defined as follows:\r\n\r\n  A demand or request to the mortgagee to enter satisfaction of the\r\n    mortgage is a condition precedent to the right to sue for the statutory\r\n    penalty.Â  No particular form of words is necessary for this demand; it is\r\n    sufficient if it informs the mortgagee with reasonable certainty that an entry\r\n    of satisfaction of the particular mortgage is requested. \r\n\r\n59\r\n  C.J.S. Mortgages Â§ 483 (1998 &amp; Supp. 2007) (discussing cases involving\r\n  the penalties or damages which relate to the release or satisfaction of mortgages).Â \r\n  Another secondary authority provides a more detailed analysis:\r\n\r\n  A notice or request to the mortgagee that he or she enter a\r\n    satisfaction or execute a release of a satisfied mortgage is a condition\r\n    precedent to a right of action for the statutory penalty for a failure to do\r\n    so.Â  Usually, the statutes do not prescribe the form or substance of the\r\n    notice, and it is held that the notice or request may be either written or\r\n    oral, and need not be presented in any particular form.Â  In this respect, it is\r\n    generally held that a demand to satisfy is sufficient which calls to the\r\n    attention of the mortgagee the fact that the indebtedness secured by the\r\n    mortgage has been paid, and requests in consideration of that payment that a\r\n    satisfaction of the mortgage be executed or entered.Â  The language of the\r\n    notice must, however, in its fair and reasonable meaning, inform the mortgagee\r\n    as to what is desired . . . Moreover, the request not only must be worded in\r\n    proper terms, but must also, where written, be signed by the proper party or\r\n    parties, and be delivered to the proper person.Â  \r\n\r\n55\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages Â§ 440 (1996 &amp; Supp. 2007) (analyzing cases\r\n  involving the satisfaction and discharge of mortgages).\r\nAlthough\r\n  we have reviewed numerous cases from other jurisdictions, we narrow our focus\r\n  to a case issued by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rather than engage in a\r\n  lengthy recitation of cases.Â  See generally J.Q.L., Annotation, Validity\r\n    and Construction of Statute Allowing Penalty and Damages Against Mortgagee\r\n    Refusing to Discharge Mortgage on Real Property, 56 A.L.R. 335 (1928 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2007) (â€œIn a number of jurisdictions . . . statutes have been passed\r\n  which, although varying somewhat in their specific provision, provide in\r\n  general that a mortgagee who has received payment of the mortgage debt must\r\n  enter a satisfaction thereof on the mortgage record, or execute a release of\r\n  the mortgage, within a certain period after having been requested to do so by\r\n  the mortgagor; and that, on his failure to do so, he may be held liable by the\r\n  mortgagor, for a definite sum, and for additional damages which the mortgagor\r\n  may have sustained as a result of the mortgageeâ€™s refusal.â€).\r\nIn Oâ€™Donoghue v. Laurel Savings Association, the\r\n  Pennsylvania Supreme Court analyzed state mortgage statutes, which are similar\r\n  to our statutes,[4] and\r\n  considered the question of what constitutes a â€œrequestâ€ to mark a mortgage\r\n  satisfied for the purposes of imposing a statutory penalty pursuant to the\r\n  Mortgage Satisfaction Law.[5]Â  Oâ€™Donoghue v. Laurel Sav. Assâ€™n, 728 A.2d 914 (Pa. 1999).Â  \r\nIn Oâ€™Donoghue, the mortgagors obtained three loans from the\r\n  predecessor to Laurel Savings Association (Laurel) in 1978 and 1980.Â  On June\r\n  22, 1988, the mortgagors entered into a refinancing agreement with Laurel which resulted in a Laurel representative marking on the loan settlement sheet that\r\n  the original three loans had been satisfied.Â  Id. at 915.Â  In July or\r\n  August of 1992, the mortgagors discovered that the original three loans\r\n  appeared on their credit report as outstanding debt even though they had been\r\n  paid in full. Â By letter dated November 17, 1992, the mortgagors through an\r\n  attorney demanded that Laurel immediately mark each loan satisfied.Â  Laurel complied within eight days of the demand letter.Â  Ten months later, the mortgagors\r\n  filed a Complaint alleging they had suffered damages as a result of Laurelâ€™s negligence.Â  Included in their twelve causes of action, the mortgagors requested\r\n  the imposition of a statutory fine for Laurelâ€™s failure to satisfy the\r\n  mortgages pursuant to the state mortgage satisfaction law.Â  Id.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the trial court granted Laurelâ€™s motion for summary judgment on this cause of\r\n  action.Â  On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the summary judgment order,\r\n  finding that a written request for satisfaction was necessary before a\r\n  mortgagee was obligated to record satisfaction of a mortgage.Â  Id. at 916.Â  The Court further held that Laurel complied with the mortgage\r\n  satisfaction law because the demand letter dated November 17, 1992, was the\r\n  first written request for satisfaction and Laurel recorded the satisfaction\r\n  within eight days of receiving the letter.Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the mortgagorsâ€™ Petition for Allowance of\r\n  Appeal.Â  On appeal, the Court affirmed, but modified, the Superior Courtâ€™s\r\n  decision.Â  The Court held â€œ[t]he language of the statute and the common and\r\n  ordinary meaning of the word â€˜requestâ€™ lead us to conclude that the Mortgage\r\n  Satisfaction Law does not mandate a written request, and that a verbal request\r\n  will suffice.â€Â  Id. at 918.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the Court dissected\r\n  the mortgage satisfaction law and differentiated between the satisfaction of a\r\n  mortgage and marking the mortgage satisfied.Â  Specifically, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n  The statute does not automatically obligate a mortgagee to mark\r\n    the mortgage satisfied upon receipt of all money due pursuant to the loan.Â \r\n    Instead, a mortgagor has an affirmative duty to make his or her desire to have\r\n    the mortgage marked satisfied known to the mortgagee before an obligation\r\n    arises.Â  21 P.S. Â§ 682.Â  Thus, to prove entitlement to the fine pursuant to 21\r\n    P.S. Â§ 682, a mortgagor must demonstrate the following:Â  (a) he has paid all\r\n    sums due and owing pursuant to the mortgage; (b) he requested the mortgagee to\r\n    satisfy the mortgage; and (c) the mortgagee failed to mark the mortgage\r\n    satisfied within forty-five days of the request.\r\n\r\nId. at 917. Â In determining what constitutes a â€œrequest,â€ the Court\r\n  found the Superior Court erred in reading a writing requirement into the\r\n  statute.Â  Id.Â  Relying on secondary authority, the Supreme Court\r\n  concluded â€œ[t]he ordinary meaning of the term request . . . encompasses either\r\n  verbal or written expression.â€Â  Id.Â  Based on this conclusion, the\r\n  Supreme Court additionally found that â€œa verbal agreement that the mortgagee\r\n  will record the payment of the mortgage fulfills the request requirement of\r\n  Section 681 and 682.â€Â  Id. at 918.Â  Ultimately, the Supreme Court affirmed\r\n  the Superior Courtâ€™s decision on the ground that the verbal exchange between\r\n  the mortgagor and Laurel during the refinancing negotiations, prior to the\r\n  demand letter, was not sufficient to constitute a â€œrequest.â€ Because the demand\r\n  letter constituted the first â€œrequestâ€ and Laurel promptly complied with it,\r\n  the Supreme Court found Laurel did not violate the mortgage satisfaction law.Â  Id. at 919.\r\nGuided by the principles in the above discussion and keeping in\r\n  mind our primary responsibility, to effectuate the intent of the Legislature,\r\n  we conclude the term â€œrequestâ€ in the Recording Statutes, specifically sections\r\n  29-3-310 and 29-3-320, does not mandate a particular format.Â  Instead, the\r\n  request must operate to inform the mortgagee of the mortgagorâ€™s desire for the\r\n  satisfied mortgage to be recorded.Â  Once the mortgage has been satisfied and\r\n  the mortgagor expresses this desire, it is incumbent upon the mortgagee â€œto\r\n  promptly record the extinguishment of the lien.â€ See Kinard v. Fleet\r\n    Real Estate Funding Corp., 319 S.C. 408, 412, 461 S.E.2d 833, 835 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œClearly, the legislative intent in enacting these statutes was to provide\r\n  an incentive for the mortgagee, once it no longer has a monetary interest in\r\n  the mortgage loan, to promptly record the extinguishment of the lien.â€).Â \r\n  Because the Legislature has not issued a specific directive that a â€œrequestâ€\r\n  must be written or in some particular format, we decline to read such\r\n  requirement into the statute. \r\nAmerican Home, however, contends the Legislatureâ€™s\r\n  decision to amend the statute in 1999 to require that a request be sent via\r\n  certified mail is evidence that the Legislature wanted to â€œstrengthenâ€ the\r\n  request requirement and, thus, the mortgagor is required to send a written\r\n  request.Â  Act No. 67, 1999 S.C. Acts 226.Â  We disagree with this\r\n  contention, and instead believe the Legislature added the certified mail\r\n  requirement in order for the mortgagor and the mortgagee to definitively\r\n  establish the beginning of the three-month period in which the mortgagee was\r\n  required to record the mortgage satisfaction.Â  Additionally, we note the\r\n  statute does not restrict the method of verification to only certified mail,\r\n  but instead, provides the mortgagor may make the request â€œby certified mail or\r\n    other form of delivery.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-3-310 (2007) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Thus, it would be permissible under the statute for a mortgagor to\r\n  make an oral request to the mortgagee and then the mortgagee acknowledge the\r\n  request either verbally or through another form of communication such as a\r\n  letter or electronic mail.\r\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, we disagree with the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision that American Home violated section 29-3-310 and was\r\n  subject to the statutory penalty under section 29-3-320.Â  \r\nAs previously discussed, we find a written request is not\r\n  mandated by section 29-3-310. Â Instead, we believe the statute is satisfied if\r\n  the mortgagor:Â  Â (1) makes a â€œrequest,â€ either verbal or written, in which he\r\n  expresses his desire for the mortgagee to satisfy the mortgage and; (2)\r\n  demonstrates that the mortgagee has received or agreed to this request.\r\nHere, we find that Bosticâ€™s payoff check sent by\r\n  certified mail was insufficient to constitute a â€œrequestâ€ within the meaning of\r\n  the statute. Â Clearly, the cashierâ€™s check without additional\r\n  correspondence, either verbal or written, did not affirmatively convey to\r\n  American Home that Bostic expressly desired to have his mortgage recorded as\r\n  satisfied.Â  By sending the payoff check, Bostic effectively satisfied his\r\n  mortgage.Â  However, this check was only the first step in the mortgage\r\n  satisfaction process.Â  In order for Bostic to recover the statutory penalty\r\n  under section 29-3-320, he had to satisfy the condition precedent of making a\r\n  â€œrequestâ€ for American Home to record his mortgage as satisfied.\r\nBostic asserts that his alleged telephone conversations\r\n  with American Home after he mailed the payoff check could be construed as a\r\n  â€œrequest.â€Â  However, there is no evidence in the record that an American Home\r\n  representative spoke with Bostic.Â  Because this case was presented to the\r\n  circuit court at the summary judgment stage and there is no definitive evidence\r\n  that a verbal agreement was reached during these telephone conversations, we\r\n  cannot find that American Home was given a sufficient â€œrequestâ€ which obligated\r\n  it to mark the mortgage satisfied within the statutory time period.Â  \r\nAlternatively, Bostic contends the letters from\r\n  American Home dated May 16 and 18, 2005, implicitly indicate that American Home\r\n  understood that he had made a â€œrequest.â€ Specifically, Bostic points to the\r\n  text of the letters which states that American Home would mail to Bostic the payoff\r\n  release documents within sixty to ninety days.Â  These letters, however,\r\n  do not reference that a â€œrequestâ€ was made by Bostic.Â  The letters merely\r\n  indicate that American Home acknowledged that it had received the payoff amount\r\n  and that the mortgage was paid off.Â  This acknowledgement, however, did not\r\n  automatically entitle Bostic to the statutory penalty.Â  Instead, Bostic would\r\n  only have been entitled to the statutory penalty if he paid off the mortgage,\r\n  affirmatively made a verifiable â€œrequestâ€ to American Home, and American Home\r\n  failed to comply with the request within the statutorily-prescribed time\r\n  period. Â Bostic, however, failed to present evidence that the parties engaged\r\n  in a verbal exchange in which Bostic orally made a â€œrequestâ€ and American Home\r\n  agreed to honor this request. \r\nAs we read the limited record, Bosticâ€™s certified letter\r\n  dated May 31, 2005, which was received by American Home on June 3 and June 6,\r\n  2005, was the only correspondence which satisfied the â€œrequestâ€ requirement within\r\n  the meaning of section 29-3-310.Â  American Home filed Bosticâ€™s mortgage\r\n  satisfaction within ninety days of this â€œrequest.â€Â  Thus, given the record\r\n  before us, there is no evidence that American Home violated the provisions of\r\n  section 29-3-310 which would subject it to the statutory penalty under section\r\n  29-3-320. Â \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Bostic and remand for trial.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â As evident from the circuit courtâ€™s order, Bosticâ€™s breach of contract claims were not at issue during the hearing on the motions for summary judgment.Â  Accordingly, we confine our analysis to Bosticâ€™s cause of action involving the imposition of a statutory penalty.\r\n\r\n[2] Â Although American Home raises two separate issues, we have consolidated them into one issue in the interest of brevity and clarity.\r\n\r\n[3]Â Â  In his motion for summary judgment and in his brief, Bostic cites several cases from this court that he believes are significant because they discuss sections 29-3-310 and 29-3-320.Â  See Rowell v. Whisnant, 360 S.C. 181, 186-87, 600 S.E.2d 96, 99 (Ct. App. 2004)(discussing section 29-3-310 and finding creditor was not required to satisfy note and mortgage until debtor paid appropriate amount of attorneyâ€™s fees due\r\n  under the note); Swindler v. Swindler, 355 S.C. 245, 254-55, 584 S.E.2d 438, 443 (Ct. App. 2003) (applying Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code to note secured by a mortgage on real property and remanding with instructions to enter satisfaction of the mortgage in accordance with section 29-3-310); Kinard\r\n    v.

Grady Jordan, Olson, Smith, Jordan &amp; Cox, PA, of Easley, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tW. D. Yarborough, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Defaulting taxpayers brought an action to set aside a tax sale of real property, arguing Greenville County did not follow the statutory requirements.Â  The Master-in-Equity (the Master) issued an order setting aside the tax sale.Â  The purchaser of the property at the tax sale appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999, Kent Smith and Dorothy Smith (collectively the Smiths) purchased real property (the Property) located in Greenville County, South Carolina.Â  At the time of the purchase, the Smiths resided in Taylors, South Carolina.Â  Subsequent to this purchase, the Smiths moved to a new residence.Â \r\n \r\nMr. Smith testified he sent a letter to the Greenville County Tax Office (Tax Office) notifying it of his change of address.Â  Mr. Smith further testified he instructed the Tax Office to send future tax notices regarding the Property to the new address.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Tax Office either did not receive Mr. Smithâ€™s letter or failed to modify its records.Â  As a result, the tax notices continued to be sent to the Smithsâ€™ old address rather than their new address. Â The Smiths failed to pay the real property taxes for 2001.Â  Accordingly, the Tax Office allegedly posted a delinquent tax sale notice on the Property.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Smiths assert the notice was not posted on the Property, or in the alternative, the notice was improperly posted.Â  In either case, the taxes remained unpaid.Â  Consequently, a delinquent tax sale was conducted.Â  Dr. Daniel Barr acquired the Property at the sale for approximately $25,000.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Smiths brought an action to set aside the tax sale and to quiet title.Â  The Smiths argued the Tax Office failed to follow statutory requirements that control how a delinquent tax sale is to be conducted.Â  Specifically, the Smiths argued the Tax Office failed to send the tax notices to their new address.Â  In the alternative, the Smiths contended the Tax Office failed to properly post a delinquent tax sale notice on the Property.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Master-in-Equity, following a trial (1) set aside the tax sale because the Tax Office did not comply with the relevant statutory mandates; (2) ordered the Register of Deeds for Greenville County to mark â€œcancelled of recordâ€ on the deed given to Dr. Barr; (3) ordered the Smiths to reimburse Dr. Barr for any property taxes paid by the latter; (4) ordered Greenville County to reimburse Dr. Barr any amount Dr. Barr paid at the time of the tax sale; and (5) directed Dr. Barr to address any claim for interest on his bid to the Tax Office rather than to the Smiths.Â  Dr. Barr appeals.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOur scope of review for a case heard by a Master permits us to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990); see Folk v. Thomas, 344 S.C. 77, 80, 543 S.E.2d 556, 557 (2001) (An action to set aside a tax deed rests in equity.Â  Thus, an appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.).Â  If we choose to find facts in accordance with our view of the evidence, we must state such findings of fact and our reasoning for those findings.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).\r\nHowever, we are mindful that this scope of review does not require us to disregard the Masterâ€™s factual findings because the Master saw and heard witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility and demeanor.Â  Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 518, 429 S.E.2d 859, 860 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDr. Barr contends the Master erred in setting aside the tax sale.Â  Specifically, Dr. Barr argues the Tax Office followed the statutory notice requirements of a tax sale.Â  Dr. Barr also asserts equity favors a reversal of the Masterâ€™s decision.Â  Finally, Dr. Barr avers that even if the Master correctly set aside the tax sale, the Master erred by not requiring the Smiths to pay interest.Â  We address each argument in turn. \r\n \r\nA. Notification requirements \r\nThe sale of a defaulting taxpayerâ€™s real property is strictly governed by statute.Â  F.C. Enters., Inc. v. Dibble, 335 S.C. 260, 263, 516 S.E.2d 459, 461 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The proper procedure for notifying a taxpayer of delinquent taxes before conducting a tax sale is set out in section 12-51-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  Section 12-51-40(b) authorizes the Tax Office to â€œtake exclusive possession of the property necessary to satisfy the payment of the taxes . . . .â€Â  Among the acceptable means the Tax Office can employ to take possession, and the most relevant to this case, is by â€œposting a notice at one or more conspicuous places on the premises . . . .â€Â  Â§ 12-51-40(c).Â  \r\n \r\nThe rationale behind posting such a notice is to notify the defaulting taxpayer that delinquent property taxes are due.Â  Â§ 12-51-40.Â  The failure to give the required statutory notice renders the tax sale invalid.Â  Rives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C. 287, 293, 478 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDr. Barr argues the Master erred in setting aside the tax sale.Â  Specifically, Dr. Barr maintains the Master erred by shifting the burden of proof to require Dr. Barr to prove the tax sale conformed to the law.Â  Dr. Barrâ€™s arguments are misplaced.\r\nGenerally, there are two types of burdens: burden of production and burden of persuasion.Â  Burden of production refers to a partyâ€™s responsibility to introduce sufficient evidence on a contested issue to have that issue decided by the fact-finder, rather than decided against the party in a preemptory decision such as directed verdict.Â Â  Pike v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 231, 540 S.E.2d 87, 91 (2000).Â  Burden of persuasion is concerned with a partyâ€™s obligation to sway the fact-finder to view the facts in a way that favors that party.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn civil cases, the burden of persuasion rests with the plaintiff to prove his or her case, usually, by a preponderance of the evidence. Â In criminal cases, the burden of persuasion requires the state to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the present case, the burden of production is of little concern because neither party moved for a preemptory decision.Â  Conversely, the burden of persuasion is of interest.Â  In this non-jury case, the Master was the fact-finder.Â  Therefore, the Smiths shouldered the burden to prove to the Master, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax Office failed to properly post the required statutory notice on the Property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-160 (Supp. 2006) (â€œIn all cases of tax sale the deed of conveyance . . . executed to a private person . . . is prima facie evidence of good title in the holder, that all proceedings have been regular and that all legal requirements have been complied with.â€).Â  There is ample evidence in the record that shows the Smiths met their burden.Â  This evidence consists of testimony and the deed the Smiths acquired upon purchase of the Property.\r\nDorothy Smith worked in the subdivision where the Property is located.Â  She testified she would frequent the Property or the land adjoining the Property at least once a week.Â  She gave evidence that during those visits she never noticed a delinquent tax sign on the Property.Â  Kent Smith also gave testimony that he did not believe a delinquent tax sign was posted on the Property.Â  The Smithsâ€™ testimony may be viewed as self-serving, but Scott Rectorâ€™s testimony substantiates it. \r\n \r\nScott Rector, the manager of the subdivision where the Property is located, testified on behalf of the Smiths.Â  Rectorâ€™s testimony speaks for itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAll right, have you ever seen a delinquent sale sign on [the Property]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tNo, sir, I have not. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tDo you know what a delinquent sale sign is?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tYes, sir. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. . . \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAll right, now, how many times would you say . . . you have gone by [the Property] or been involved with [it]?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWell, pretty well every lot [in the subdivision], I would kind of go by once every couple of weeks. . . . But during that period of time, there was purposes [sic] when we were in there every day.Â  Like I say, we also have some materials actually stored on the [Property] that we use from time to time, some large boulders and things, so like I say, at least once a week to once every two weeks.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd on those frequent visits, you never saw a delinquent sale sign on the [Property]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tNo sir.Â  No, sir. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nRectorâ€™s testimony proves he was familiar with the Property due to his frequent visits.Â  During these regular visits, Rector did not notice a delinquent tax sign on the Property, even though he could readily identify a tax sign.Â  Additionally, the deed of conveyance confirms Rectorâ€™s and the Smithsâ€™ account that the Tax Office failed to post a delinquent tax sign on the Property.\r\nWhen the Smiths received title to the Property, the deed of conveyance listed an incorrect identification number.Â  This deed listed the Propertyâ€™s tax map number as 0645.06-01-003.00.[1]Â  This number corresponds to the lot that is located directly across the street from the Property.Â  The Tax Office utilized, at least partly, the tax map number in determining on which lot to post the delinquent tax sign.Â  Although this misnomer was corrected, the record is unclear as to whether the correction was accomplished prior to or subsequent to the tax sale.Â  Â \r\nThe incorrect tax map number and the testimony of the Smiths and Rector provide a sufficient basis to conclude the notice was not placed on the Property.Â  Thus, even if the Master improperly placed the burden upon Dr. Barr to demonstrate the tax sale complied with the requisite statutory requirements, based on our view of the preponderance of the evidence, we hold the Smiths met their burden to prove the Tax Office failed to post the mandatory notice on the Property as mandated by section 12-51-40.\r\nB. The equity claim\r\nDr. Barr argues equity requires the tax sale be validated.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Master ordered Greenville County to reimburse Dr. Barr any amount he paid at the time of the tax sale.Â  Additionally, the Smiths were ordered to reimburse Dr. Barr any property taxes paid by the latter.Â  As such, Dr. Barr will recover the money he spent on purchasing the Property at the tax sale.Â  We fail to see how this result is inequitable.Â  Moreover, other considerations support our conclusion.\r\nIt is well known that equity follows the law.Â  C &amp; S Natâ€™l Bank v. Modern Homes Constr. Co., 248 S.C. 130, 133, 149 S.E.2d 326, 327 (1966).Â  In South Carolina, â€œall requirements of the law leading up to tax sales which are intended for the protection of the taxpayer against surprise or the sacrifice of his property are to be regarded mandatory and are to be strictly enforced.â€ Â Â Donohue v. Ward, 298 S.C. 75, 83, 378 S.E.2d 261, 265 (Ct. App. 1989) (internal citations and quotations omitted).Â  Additionally, the failure to give the required statutory notice renders the tax sale invalid.Â  Rives, 325 S.C. at 293, 478 S.E.2d at 881.\r\nAs discussed above, the Tax Office failed to properly post the required statutory notice on the Property.Â  As a result, the law mandates that we set aside the tax sale.Â  Consequently, equity does not provide Dr. Barr relief because equity follows the law.Â \r\n \r\nC. Interest payment \r\nDr. Barrâ€™s final argument is that if the tax sale is set aside, he is entitled to an interest payment on the purchase price from the Smiths.Â  In support of this claim, Dr. Barr relies on section 12-51-90 of the South Carolina Code Section (Supp. 2006).\r\nSection 12-51-90 provides that â€œ[t]he defaulting taxpayer . . . may within twelve months from the date of the delinquent tax sale redeem each item of real estate by paying to the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs together with interest . . . .â€Â  The plain language of the statute does not entitle Dr. Barr to recover interest payments from the Smiths. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the Masterâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.  [2] Â Â \r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The correct number for the Property is 0645.06-01-001.00.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4281","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Appellant, George Wigington, was convicted of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime in the shooting death of his son, Scott.Â  He appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on (1) self-defense and (2) involuntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant and his son, Scott, Scottâ€™s two daughters, and Scottâ€™s girlfriend all lived together at the time of Scottâ€™s death.Â  Jessica, Scottâ€™s daughter and appellantâ€™s granddaughter, testified to the events leading up to the shooting.Â  On the night of June 26, 2005, Jessica and her father, Scott, engaged in a loud argument, discussing the matter for over an hour.Â  Around 7:00 the next evening, Scott told Jessica he wanted to talk to her about what had happened the previous night.Â Â  Jessica entered her fatherâ€™s bedroom and the two began talking.Â  Scott was lying in his bed under the covers.Â  During their discussion, appellant came home.Â  At this time, Jessica and Scott were cutting each other off as they discussed the matter, and Jessica â€œsquealedâ€ because her father was not letting her talk.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant entered the bedroom and Jessica was crying, saying her father would not let her talk.Â  Appellant told them they could not both talk at the same time, then moved in front of Scott, who was still in his bed.Â  Appellant and Scott began â€œholleringâ€ at each other and the argument escalated.Â  Appellant was crouched over Scott when Jessica heard her father yell that appellant had hit him; however, she did not actually see whether any punches were thrown.Â  Scott stood up from the bed and walked into the hallway.Â  Appellant pursued him, and the two stood on each side of a door, yelling.Â  The argument continued as Scott went into the living room and sat in a chair.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant walked into the living room and stood in front of Scott.Â  At this point, Jessica observed appellant strike Scott in his head and shoulders with three or four punches.Â  Scott stood from his chair, but did not hit his father or physically defend himself.Â  He walked to the hall and said to appellant, â€œif you hit me again Iâ€™ll kill you.â€Â  Appellant told Scott to sit down, and Scott complied, returning to the same chair.Â  Appellant sat down as well, the two facing each other as they spoke.Â  Appellant stated, â€œI thought you were going to hurt her,â€ and Scott replied, â€œI havenâ€™t hurt her, but you have.â€Â  Appellant then became increasingly upset and enraged.Â  He leaned over a table between them, pointed his finger at Scott, and told Scott to shut up.Â  Appellant then stood and walked out the side door to the carport, while Scott remained seated.Â  As appellant was walking out the door, Scott stated, â€œyouâ€™re gonna get your gun, arenâ€™t you.â€Â  Appellant returned, standing where he stood before he left.Â  Jessica was looking into her fatherâ€™s eyes when she heard a gunshot, saw blood coming from his eyes and face, and then saw her father slump over in the chair.Â \r\n \r\nJessica stated that at no point did her father hit, strike, kick at, or throw anything at appellant.Â  She further testified that after her grandfather came back inside, as she was looking at her father, her father was not swinging or reaching.Â  Right before she heard the gunshot, Scott sat with his hands in his lap, by his side.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant took the stand in his defense.Â  He testified that, on the night of the incident, he arrived home around seven oâ€™clock.Â  As he pulled into his carport, he heard a loud argument.Â  He entered the house and determined the voices were coming from his sonâ€™s bedroom.Â  As he walked into the bedroom, he saw his granddaughter standing near the bed with tears running down her face as Scott berated her.Â  Appellant told Scott, who was lying in his bed, to calm down and not be so loud.Â  Scott sat up on the side of the bed and kept arguing loudly.Â  Appellant left the bedroom and walked to the den.Â  He was followed by Jessica, and then by Scott, who was still arguing.Â  Appellant told Scott he was being too loud and that he needed to give Jessica a chance to talk.Â  Appellant and Scott sat down, and the arguing continued.Â  Appellant stood, walked over to Scott in his chair, put his hand on Scottâ€™s shoulder, and told Scott he needed to calm down and let Jessica talk.Â  Scott immediately jumped up and stood beside his chair.Â  Appellant testified Scott â€œdidnâ€™t advance on me,â€ but that Scott stated, â€œif you put your hands on me again, Iâ€™ll kill you.â€Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant testified he had been the victim of criminal domestic violence involving his son in 1998, and when his son made that statement, he did not know what would happen next.Â  He feared for his and his grandchildrenâ€™s safety and wanted to protect them and himself, so he walked out to his car and retrieved a pistol.Â  He looked at the gun to ensure the safety was on and then put it in his pocket before walking back into the room.Â  Scott remarked, â€œwent and got your gun,â€ and appellant stated, â€œyes, I did.â€Â  Appellant told Scott it was getting out of control and they were going to have to â€œde-escalateâ€ things.Â  Appellant had the gun out in his hand, but was not pointing it at Scott, who was sitting in a chair.Â  Scott grabbed appellantâ€™s hand with the gun in it. Â Appellant was concerned Scott was trying to get the gun out of his hand.Â  He did not point the gun directly at Scott until Scott grabbed his hand, and then the gun was â€œmore or less pointing at him.â€Â  When asked if he pulled the trigger, appellant stated that he evidently did, but that he did not mean to pull it and was surprised because the safety was on the gun. Â When he saw the bullet had struck Scott, he told another granddaughter to call 911.Â  Appellant denied that he ever hit Scott during the incident.Â  He admitted, though, that Scott never hit him either.Â  \r\n \r\nDefense counsel requested the court charge the jury on self-defense.Â  The trial court declined, finding appellant failed to meet two of the elements of self-defense: (1) that the defendant be without fault in bringing on the difficulty and (2) that he had no other probable way to avoid the danger of death or serious bodily injury than to act as he did under the circumstances.Â  Defense counsel then stated, â€œif you were to charge self-defense, I believe we would be entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter.â€Â  The trial court responded it would deny the request for an involuntary manslaughter charge based on the reasons stated.Â  After submission of the matter to the jury, appellant was found guilty of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.[2]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe evidence presented at trial determines the law to be charged. State v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004).Â  If there is any evidence in the record to support self-defense, the issue should be submitted to the jury. Â State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 260, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).Â  Additionally, if any evidence exists to warrant a jury charge on the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, then the charge must be given. Â State v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 380, 605 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Self-defense\r\nAppellant first contends the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the law of self-defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nIf there is any evidence of record from which it can be reasonably inferred that an accused justifiably inflicted a wound in self-defense, then the accused is entitled to a charge on the law of self-defense.Â  State v. Adkinson, 280 S.C. 85, 86, 311 S.E.2d 79, 80 (1984), overruled on other grounds by State v. Stone, 285 S.C. 386, 330 S.E.2d 286 (1985).Â  A jury charge on self-defense is not required unless it is supported by the evidence.Â  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 344, 520 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1999).Â  In order to establish self-defense in South Carolina, the following four elements must be present:Â  (1) the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent danger, a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief that he was actually in imminent danger and the circumstances were such as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence, firmness and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or loss of his own life; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger. Â Id. at 344-45, 520 S.E.2d at 321-22.\r\nIn the instant case, appellant fails to meet at least two of the necessary elements of self-defense.Â  First, appellant does not meet the requirement that he be without fault in bring on the difficulty.Â  â€œâ€˜[O]ne who provokes or initiates an assault cannot escape criminal liability by invoking self defense . . . .â€™â€ Â Id. at 345, 520 S.E.2d at 322 (quoting Ferdinand S. Tinio, Comment Note:Â  Withdrawal, After Provocation of Conflict, As Reviving Right Of Self-Defense, 55 A.L.R.3d 1000, 1003 (1974)).Â  â€œAny act of the accused in violation of law and reasonably calculated to produce the occasion amounts to bringing on the difficulty and bars his right to assert self-defense as a justification or excuse for a homicide.â€Â  Id.Â  In the very recent case of State v. Slater, Op. No. 26299 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 9, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 31), our supreme court determined Slater was not entitled to a self-defense charge because he failed to meet the requirement that he be without fault in bringing on the difficulty.Â  There, the court noted Slater approached an altercation that was already underway with a loaded weapon by his side, and that such activity could be reasonably calculated to bring on the difficulty that arose.Â  Id. at 34.Â  Similarly, viewing the evidence from appellantâ€™s version of the events, the record in the instant case shows appellant injected himself into a verbal argument between Scott and Scottâ€™s daughter, removed himself from the presence of the controversy, and returned with a loaded gun.Â  Thus, appellantâ€™s conduct could be reasonably calculated to bring about the difficulty that arose.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant maintains, however, that he had the right to arm himself in his own home after he is threatened, and such cannot constitute evidence he was at fault in bringing on the difficulty.Â  Appellant relies on the following quotation from State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 244 S.E.2d 503 (1978): Â â€œA man arming himself on his own land in a legal manner after he has been threatened is not evidence of his being at fault in bringing on the difficulty.â€Â  Id. at 659, 244 S.E.2d at 506. Â However, in Hendrix, the uncontroverted evidence showed the deceased, who had threatened Hendrix earlier in the day, advanced toward Hendrix on Hendrixâ€™s property.Â  After Hendrix pointed his shotgun at the deceased and told him to â€œback offâ€ three times, the deceased immediately went to his truck and returned with a shotgun to confront Hendrix.Â  It was only after this that Hendrix shot the deceased.Â  Id. at 660, 244 S.E.2d at 506.Â  Unlike the situation in Hendrix, Scott did not approach appellant and did not confront appellant with a gun or any other type of weapon.Â  Additionally, while the incident did occur in appellantâ€™s home, it was also the home of Scott. Â \r\nAppellant cites the case of State v. Grantham, 224 S.C. 41, 77 S.E.2d 291 (1953) for the proposition that he was under no duty to retreat where he and the victim lived in the same home.Â  In Grantham, the appellant, who was partially paralyzed from a stroke, testified that his wife had made repeated threats to kill him, that they had argued the night before, that at the time of the shooting he was seated on a couch, that she advanced upon him with a knife in hand, and that he fired his pistol when she was five or six feet from him.Â  Id. at 43, 77 S.E.2d at 292.Â  The court there noted as follows: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tA person need not retreat or seek to escape, even though he can do so without increasing his danger, but \r\n\tmay lawfully resist even to the extent of taking life if necessary, where, \r\n\tbeing without fault in bringing on the difficulty, he is assaulted while in his own dwelling house. . . .Â  However, \r\n\tthe rule is predicated on the absence of aggression or fault on his part in bringing on the difficulty; the doctrine is for defensive, and not offensive, purposes.\r\n\r\nId. at 43-44, 77 S.E.2d at 292 (quoting 40 C.J.S. Homicide, Â§ 130, Subsec. c., pp. 1015-1016) (emphasis added).Â  The court there held appellant was not burdened with the duty of retreating, that he was in his home lawfully occupied by him and because he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty, he was not bound to retreat in order to invoke the benefit of the doctrine of self-defense, but could stand his ground and repel the attack with as much force as was reasonably necessary; that under those circumstances of both the deceased and the appellant living in the home, the law imposed no duty upon him to retreat in order to avoid the deceased, but he might stand his ground if he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty. Â Id. at 45-46, 77 S.E.2d at 293. \r\n \r\nHere there is no evidence appellant â€œlawfully resist[ed]â€ or that he was â€œassaultedâ€ while in his own dwelling, or that there was any attack from Scott for him to repel.Â  The evidence is uncontroverted that Scott never hit, struck, or threw anything at appellant or presented any weapon during the verbal argument.Â  Although appellant testified Scott jumped out of his chair when appellant touched his shoulder and proceeded to verbally threaten appellant, he admitted Scott did not â€œadvanceâ€ on him at that time.Â  Appellant also agreed Scott was seated in his chair when appellant returned with his gun, and that appellant advanced close enough to Scott that Scott could grab his hand.Â  In short, the evidence shows that there were no actions by Scott which appellant had the right to â€œlawfully resist,â€ that appellant was at â€œfault in bringing on the difficulty,â€ and that there was no â€œabsence of aggression or faultâ€ on appellantâ€™s part.Â  Although appellant maintained Scott threatened to kill him, his words alone were insufficient to constitute legal provocation. Â While, depending on the circumstances, words accompanied by hostile acts may establish self-defense, Scottâ€™s words were never accompanied by any hostile act on his part.Â  See State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, 160, 634 S.E.2d 23, 27 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding evidence did not support charge of self-defense because it did not support finding appellant was without fault in bringing on difficulty even though appellant maintained deceased verbally berated him, where words were never accompanied by hostile act); State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 444, 377 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1989) (noting law that â€œwords accompanied by hostile acts, may, depending on the circumstances, establish a plea of self-defenseâ€); State v. Harvey, 220 S.C. 506, 518, 68 S.E.2d 409 (1951), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (â€œIt is well settled in this State that where death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon, words alone, however opprobrious, are not sufficient to constitute a legal provocation.â€).[3]\r\nFurther, we find appellant cannot satisfy the third prong of self-defense.Â  Although appellant testified he feared for his safety, a reasonable, prudent person of ordinary fitness and courage would not have entertained the same belief that he was actually in imminent danger and the circumstances were not such as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence, firmness and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or loss of his life.Â  Although there was some evidence that appellant had been the victim of criminal domestic violence at the hands of his son in the past, the record shows this prior incident was at least six years earlier and appellant was comfortable enough with Scottâ€™s presence that he continued to live with him thereafter, and even moved into another home with him.Â  Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, during the verbal disagreement Scott stood from his seated position, but did not advance on appellant, and told appellant he would kill him if appellant touched him again.Â  As previously noted, Scott did not advance toward the appellant, did not strike at the appellant and did not present any weapon before appellant walked out of the house, retrieved a loaded gun, returned with it and then shot Scott as he sat in a chair.Â  No reasonable person would have feared serious bodily harm or loss of life from Scottâ€™s words and actions.Â  \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Involuntary manslaughter\r\nAppellant also contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We disagree.\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is defined as (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51-52, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).Â  â€œTo constitute involuntary manslaughter, there must be a finding of criminal negligence, statutorily defined as a reckless disregard of the safety of others.â€Â  Id. at 52, 584 S.E.2d at 112. Â Further, â€œa person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm himself in self-defense at the time of the shooting.â€Â  Id.\r\nAppellant maintains there is evidence of record that he was lawfully armed in self-defense at the time of the fatal shooting and that he did not intentionally discharge the weapon, thereby entitling him to an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  Defense counsel never argued below that appellant was lawfully armed in self-defense or that there was any evidence of criminal negligence.Â  Counsel requested a charge of involuntary manslaughter only if the trial court determined a self-defense charge was appropriate.Â  Counsel never stated any specific reason for his entitlement to the charge.Â  Because we have affirmed the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge self-defense, appellant would not be entitled to a reversal on the only basis he raised below.Â  See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005) (finding argument advanced on appeal was not raised and ruled on below and therefore was not preserved for review); State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (â€œA party need not use the exact name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve it, but it must be clear that the argument has been presented on that ground.â€); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding arguments not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review, and a defendant may not argue one ground below and another on appeal).\r\nBased on the foregoing, Wigingtonâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n \r\n[2] Although the charges are not contained in the record before us, appellant indicates in his brief that in addition to murder, the trial court instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter and accident.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] On appeal, appellant asserts that he had the right to arm himself after his son stood and threatened him because Scott had physically attacked him in the past.Â  While appellant did testify that he had been the victim in a criminal domestic violence case involving his son, he admitted that the prior altercation occurred in 1998, some six or seven years before this incident, and that the prior incident occurred in another home and he and Scott had thereafter moved into another residence together.Â  This evidence is simply insufficient to establish words accompanied by a hostile act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4282","title":"State v.

Markley Dennis, accepted the plea and sentenced Davis to six years imprisonment suspended upon the service of two years probation.[1]Â  Judge Dennis (the Sentencing Judge) further ordered special conditions as follows:Â  â€œsex offender counseling with Bill Burke; not be required to register as a sex offender; such additional counseling as needed.â€Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nDavis attended counseling with Dr. Bill Burke, missing only those sessions where he was not permitted to participate because he could not afford the required fee.Â  However, Dr. Burke expressed concerns that Davis was not meaningfully participating in treatment because he refused to admit his guilt.Â  Consequently, Dr. Burke reported that Davis was not in compliance with the treatment plan, and Davis was brought before Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein (the Probation Judge) for a probation revocation hearing.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nDavis moved to have the probation revocation hearing transferred to the Sentencing Judge so that he could interpret his own order, but the Probation Judge denied this motion.Â  At this June 30, 2005 hearing, Dr. Burke testified regarding what he believed to be Davisâ€™s non-compliance with the treatment plan and stated that because Davis was in denial, he posed an increased risk to the community.Â  The Probation Judge revoked thirty days of Davisâ€™s probation and required that he serve this time on weekends.Â  Further, she held the decision on whether to place Davis in the Registry in abeyance for thirty days to allow the parties to brief that issue.Â \r\n \r\nOn August 11, 2005, Davis was once again brought before the Probation Judge with the State seeking the revocation of Davisâ€™s probation for non-compliance with his treatment plan.Â  On this occasion, Davis had failed to attend several of his counseling sessions, and although he had admitted his guilt, Dr. Burke doubted his sincerity.Â  After hearing testimony and recommendations from Dr. Burke and Davisâ€™s probation officer, the Probation Judge revoked Davisâ€™s probation and converted his sentence to youthful offender status.Â  Further, she â€œaddedâ€ Davisâ€™s placement in the registry â€œas a condition of his probation.â€[2]Â  This appeal followed.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Authority to Place on the Registry\r\nDavis cites section 23-3-430(D) of the South Carolina Code to support his contention that the probation revocation court lacked the authority to require his placement in the Registry.Â  This statute states:\r\n\r\n\tUpon conviction, adjudication of delinquency, guilty plea, or plea of \r\n\tnolo contendere of a person of an offense not listed in this article, the \r\n\tpresiding judge may order as a condition of sentencing that the person be included in the sex offender registry \r\n\tif good cause is shown by the solicitor.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(D) (2007) (emphasis added).Â  Davis argues this statute permits the presiding judge to order placement in the Registry as a condition of sentencing only when the solicitor has shown good cause.Â  We agree and note a presiding judge cannot sua sponte place the person in the registry for a crime, such as ABHAN, which is not specifically listed in the statute as an offense requiring placement in the Registry.Â  Davis further argues that because only the â€œpresiding judge may order as a condition of sentencing that the person be included in the sex offender registry,â€ the Probation Judge was without statutory authority to add him to the Registry at a later probation revocation hearing.Â Â \r\n \r\nThe Sentencing Judgeâ€™s order indicates that the plea agreement is the result of a recommendation by the State and includes the language â€œnot be required to register as a sex offender.â€Â  One might endeavor to read the portion concerning Davis not being required to register as a sex offender to be conditioned on the adjacent language requiring him to undergo sex offender counseling with Dr. Burke.Â  However, a clear reading of the order, which was signed by the solicitor, reveals assent by the parties to Davis not being registered as a sex offender.Â  We read this assent as illustrating that the State did not show â€œgood causeâ€ why Davis should be placed in the Registry.\r\nFurther, Davis stated both in his brief to the Probation Judge regarding her authority to place him in the Registry and in his appellate brief to this court that his not being required to be placed in the Registry was a condition of the plea agreement.Â  His brief to the Probation Judge further asserted that the solicitor agreed to this provision as was evidenced by the solicitorâ€™s oral statements to the Sentencing Judge in open court.Â  The State did not deny the veracity of any of these assertions by Davis.Â  In fact, the Stateâ€™s admission that Davis had not been evaluated prior to the plea hearing but that good cause was shown at the probation revocation hearing further enhances the notion that no good cause was shown at the plea hearing.Â  With no good cause having been shown at the plea hearing, the Sentencing Judge would be without the statutory authority to either sentence Davis to be placed in the Registry or to make it a condition of his probation.Â \r\n \r\nIt necessarily follows that once the Sentencing Judgeâ€™s order became final, neither he, nor the Probation Judge would be permitted to alter the sentence he had handed down.Â  See State v. Best, 257 S.C. 361, 373-74, 186 S.E.2d 272, 277-78 (1972) (noting, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to modify, change, or amend a sentence after adjournment of the term of court at which the court imposed the sentence.)[3]Â  The Sentencing Judge, that is the presiding judge at the time of sentencing, had specifically ordered that Davis not be required to register as a sex offender.Â  However, in requiring Davis to register as a sex offender, the Probation Judge stated that she was adding it as a condition of Davisâ€™s probation.Â  Section 24-21-430 of the South Carolina Code provides the trial court with the right to modify the conditions of probation.Â  However, this section does not grant jurisdiction for the trial court â€œto add, as a new condition of probation, a condition that the State expressly plea bargained away with court approval, particularly after the sentence, as here, has gone into execution and the term at which the sentence was imposed has ended.â€Â  State v. Rhinehart, 312 S.C. 36, 38, 430 S.E.2d 536, 537 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The State is bound by the bargain that it made to obtain a defendantâ€™s guilty plea.Â  Id. at 39, 430 S.E.2d at 537.Â  â€œThe trial court, having accepted the plea agreement, must honor it also.â€Â  Id. at 39, 430 S.E.2d at 538.Â  Further, because section 23-3-430(D) of the South Carolina Code states that only the â€œpresiding judge may order as a condition of sentencing that the person be included in the sex offender registry,â€ we find the Probation Judge, who was not the presiding judge at the time of sentencing, was without the statutory authority to add placement in the Registry as a condition of probation (emphasis added).Â  See Gordon v. Phillips Utilities, Inc., 362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005) (â€œIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.â€).Â  The statuteâ€™s plain language dictates that the courtâ€™s authority for placing individuals in the Registry exists only as a condition of sentencing.\r\nWe reverse and find Davis must be removed from the sex offender registry.Â  Due to our reversal under the first issue on appeal, we need not address the remaining issues on appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Probation Judge was without authority to place Davis in the sex offender registry.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court and order that Davis be removed from the Registry.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Stateâ€™s brief states Davis was convicted of two counts of ABHAN and sentenced to two six year terms to be served concurrently.Â  The Sentencing Judgeâ€™s order does not support this assertion.Â  Further, the State declares that Davis pled guilty.Â  This also is incorrect.Â  The order clearly states a plea of nolo contendere.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] The Probation Judge found Davis violated his probation and added a new condition to his probation.Â  Her statement that she could â€œaddâ€ placement in the registry as a condition of probation reflects her belief that it was not already a condition of probation.\r\n[3] We note Rule 29 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure modifies this common law rule to allow ten days from the imposition of the sentence, regardless of the end date of the term of court, in which to file a post trial motion.Â  This modification bears no impact under the facts of this matter. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4283","title":"HK New Plan v.

Â Bradley worked at the Institute but was not an owner.Â  The Instituteâ€™s main location was in West Ashley. Â On December 28, 1998, Bradley and Dale entered into a five-year lease (the Original Lease) with Festival Centre, LLC (Festival) to rent a space at the Festival Shopping Center to house the North Charleston location of the Institute.Â  The lease period began on March 1, 1999, and was to expire on February 29, 2004.Â  \r\n\r\nAround December 2001, the Institute began having problems with the floors at its North Charleston location due in part to termite damage.Â  In April 2002, Bradleyâ€™s wife, Roeman Coker, tried to mediate the problems between Dale and the leasing company.Â  According to Roeman, the representative for the leasing company informed her that Dale would have to sign a long lease as a prerequisite to getting the floors fixed and Dale agreed to do so. Â \r\nIn July 2002, Bradley stopped working at the Institute.Â  The Institute received the new lease Dale had agreed to sign.Â  The lease arrived with Bradleyâ€™s name on it.Â  Roeman contacted the leasing company to have Bradleyâ€™s name removed from the new lease and the Original Lease.Â  After speaking with the leasing companyâ€™s legal department, Roeman sent a letter to Festival requesting it remove Bradleyâ€™s name from the lease because he did not have an ownership interest and was no longer employed by the Institute. Â \r\nDale and Festival subsequently executed a â€œStandard Lease Renewal and First Amendmentâ€ (the Amendment).Â  The relevant provisions are as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.&nbsp; Tenantâ€™s Legal Name:\r\n\t\t\tDale A. Coker\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5.&nbsp; Tenantâ€™s Trade Name:&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJapan Karate \r\n\t\t\tInstitute\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t7.&nbsp; The Lease:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally dated on \r\n\t\t\tor about December 28, 1998 and entered into by Festival Centre, LLC, \r\n\t\t\tas Landlord, and Bradley Dale Coker as Tenant, to which Dale A. \r\n\t\t\tCoker, is successor in interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t9.&nbsp; Revised \r\n\t\t\tLease Term:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe term \r\n\t\t\tof the lease is hereby extended an additional period of five (5) \r\n\t\t\tyears commencing March 1, 2004 and expiring February 28, 2009.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Amendment further provided:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThis agreement is entered into by the Landlord and Tenant, as set forth above, and is intended to be an amendment of the Lease described above.Â  Any provision of this amendment which is inconsistent with any provision(s) of the Lease shall supersede the provision(s) in the Lease.Â  Also, any ambiguities and conflicts between this Amendment and the Lease shall be read in favor of the Amendment.Â  Except as amended hereby, all other terms and conditions of the Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and the terms of this Amendment shall be fully incorporated into, and apply in addition to the terms of, the Lease. Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Amendment also stated, â€œThis Standard Lease Renewal and Amendment shall be effective upon the execution by both Landlord and Tenant below . . . .â€ Â The tenant signature line only listed â€œDale A. Coker,â€ and he was the only party to sign as a tenant.Â  Dale signed on September 5, 2002, and Festival signed on October 28, 2002.Â  On December 12, 2002, Festival conveyed the shopping center to HK New Plan.Â  \r\n\r\nAt some point, HK New Plan stopped receiving rent payments from Dale Coker.Â  On January 25, 2005, HK New Plan filed a complaint against Dale and Bradley: Â alleging breach of contract for failure to pay rent; accelerating the rent due from July 1, 2003, through February 28, 2009, which amounted to $171,578.04; and requesting costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Bradley and Dale filed separate answers, and Bradley filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  HK New Plan also filed a motion for summary judgment in which it recognized Bradley was not liable for the rent due during the renewal period, and HK New Plan reduced its claim against Bradley to only the rent owed for the period between July 1, 2003, and February 29, 2004.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court found nothing in the Amendment released Bradley from his obligation under the Original Lease or modified the Original Lease.Â  The court determined that Bradley was bound for the full period of the Original Lease, granted HK New Planâ€™s motion for summary judgment, and denied Bradleyâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).&nbsp; \r\n \r\nIn determining whether a triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; Even if evidentiary facts are not disputed, summary judgment should be denied where the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts conflict. Â Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991). Â â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of law.â€Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy that should be cautiously invoked in order not to improperly deprive a litigant of a trial of the disputed factual issues. Â Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 138, 542 S.E.2d 743, 747 (Ct. App. 2001). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBradley contends the Amendment created an ambiguity, and the interpretation of the Amendment was a material question of fact for the jury.Â  We agree.[1]\r\nGenerally, the construction of a contract is a question of law for the court. Â Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc., 325 S.C. 231, 234, 482 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1997). Â Where a motion for summary judgment presents a question as to the construction of a written contract, if the language employed by the agreement is plain and unambiguous, the question is one of law. Â First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Conway Natâ€™l Bank, 282 S.C. 303, 305, 317 S.E.2d 776, 777 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œIn such a case, summary judgment is proper and a trial unnecessary where the intention of the parties as to the legal effect of the contract may be gathered from the four corners of the instrument itself.â€ Â Id.\r\nHowever, summary judgment is improper where the motion presents a question as to the construction of a written contract, and the contract is ambiguous because the intent of the parties can not be gathered from the four corners of the instrument.Â  Bishop v. Benson, 297 S.C. 14, 17, 374 S.E.2d 517, 518-19 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Where a contract is unclear, or is ambiguous and capable of more than one construction, the partiesâ€™ intentions are matters of fact to be submitted to a jury.Â  Wheeler v. Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. of City of N.Y., 125 S.C. 320, 325, 118 S.E. 609, 610 (1923). Â Under the parol evidence rule, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to vary or contradict the terms of a contract. Â Penton v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 326 S.C. 275, 280, 486 S.E.2d 742, 745 (1997).Â  â€œHowever, if a contract is ambiguous, parol evidence is admissible to ascertain the true meaning and intent of the parties.â€ Â Koontz v. Thomas, 333 S.C. 702, 709, 511 S.E.2d 407, 411 (Ct. App. 1999). Â An ambiguous contract is a contract capable of being understood in more than one way or a contract unclear in meaning because it expresses its purpose in an indefinite manner. Â Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Downâ€™Round Dev. Corp., 268 S.C. 80, 89, 232 S.E.2d 20, 25 (1977).\r\nWe find the Amendment creates ambiguities.Â  The Amendment lists only Dale as the tenant, refers to Dale as Bradleyâ€™s â€œsuccessor in interest,â€ and has a signature line only for Dale.Â  Despite language that any Amendment provision inconsistent with the Original Lease supersedes the Original Lease, the Amendment does not specifically state that Bradley is released from the Original Lease.Â  Thus, a question is raised regarding the partiesâ€™ intent, and the matter should be determined by a jury.Â Â \r\n \r\nFurther, the Amendment indicates that it becomes â€œeffectiveâ€ upon signing by the parties, but it also states that the revised lease term â€œcommencesâ€ March 1, 2004.Â  HK New Plan interprets the Amendment to mean that Bradley was subject to the Original Lease until March 1, 2004, and Bradley interprets it to mean that he was released immediately upon the signing of the Amendment.Â  Because even the parties have differing interpretations of the import of the â€œeffectiveâ€ and â€œcommencementâ€ dates, an ambiguity was created by the Amendment.Â \r\n \r\nThe Amendment does not specifically state that the parties intended to release Bradley from the Original Lease, nor does it specify whether the commencement date or the effective date was significant in making Dale the sole tenant.Â  This court need not decide whether it favors Bradleyâ€™s or HK New Planâ€™s view of the Amendment at this juncture; we need only determine whether the provision is ambiguous.Â  Gilliland v. Elmwood Props., 301 S.C. 295, 299, 391 S.E.2d 577, 579 (1990).Â  We find the provisions in the Amendment created ambiguities that must be determined by a jury.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the Amendment is ambiguous, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of HK New Plan.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Bradley also alternately argues that the language of the Amendment is clear that the parties intended to release him from liability and that the court erred in failing to admit parol evidence if there was an ambiguity.Â  Because we reverse based upon the ambiguity created in the Amendment, we need not reach the alternative issues on appeal.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding that the court need not rule on remaining issues when the disposition of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
