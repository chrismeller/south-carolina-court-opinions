but she did not\r\n  look at the children to see if they followed her instructions.Â  After Mrs. L.\r\n  arrived at her residence, she called the police.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBrett C. testified when he\r\n  walked up to the bus stop with Angela B. that morning, he observed one of Angela\r\n  B.'s friends slap Spencer R.Â  Brett C. explained Spencer R. returned to the bus\r\n  stop with his parents after the altercation and said he wanted to shoot Angela\r\n  B.Â  Brett C. testified when he and Angela B. got off the school bus later that\r\n  afternoon, he saw Spencer R. standing in the driveway with a gun.Â  He explained\r\n  Spencer R. was not waving or aiming the gun at them, but was holding it up.Â \r\n  Brett C. stated after he and Angela B. got into Mrs. L's car, Mrs. L. told them\r\n  to duck down as they drove by Spencer R.'s house.Â  He testified he looked out\r\n  of the window as he ducked down and saw Spencer R. holding the gun and &quot;staring\r\n  us down like he wanted to shoot us.&quot;Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nRodney T., another student,\r\n  testified he also observed Spencer R. with a gun that same afternoon.Â  After he\r\n  left the school bus, he walked by Spencer R.'s house and saw Spencer R. sitting\r\n  in a lawn chair in the driveway of his house with a gun between his legs and\r\n  his hands on the barrel of the gun.Â  Rodney T. asked Spencer R. what he was\r\n  doing, and Spencer R. replied he &quot;was going to shoot the bitch.&quot;Â \r\n  Rodney T. stated he thought Spencer R. was referring to Angela B.Â Â  \r\nThe family court found Spencer\r\n  R. guilty of presenting a loaded assault rifle at Mrs. L., Angela B., and Brett\r\n  C.Â  In its order, the family court defined presenting:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court has considered all offered definitions of the term &quot;presenting&quot;\r\n    and the [c]ourt finds that &quot;presenting&quot; means to offer for\r\n    observation, show or display.Â  In military terms, to present arms means to hold\r\n    up a rifle vertically in front of the body with the muzzle up.Â  The court finds\r\n    that clearly, the muzzle of the gun was up.Â  Clearly, the gun was in plain\r\n    view; it was observed by Mrs. L., Brett, and Rodney. \r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSection 16-23-410 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2003) states, in pertinent part: &quot;It is unlawful for\r\n  a person to present or point at another person a loaded or unloaded firearm.Â  A\r\n  person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Neither the South Carolina Code nor South Carolina case law squarely\r\n  define the phrase &quot;to present.&quot;Â  However, our supreme court has previously\r\n  determined what actions amount to presenting a firearm.Â  In State v. Reese,\r\n  the supreme court held Reese was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter\r\n  instruction because he &quot;presented a firearm&quot; when he took out a gun\r\n  and waved it in the victim's face.Â  370 S.C. 31, 36, 633 S.E.2d 898, 900-01\r\n  (2006), overruled on other grounds by State v. Belcher, 385 S.C.\r\n  597, 685 S.E. 2d 802 (2009).Â  Likewise, in State v. Cabrera-Pena, the\r\n  court found the defendant's conduct in showing the victim his pistol as a means\r\n  of intimidation and forcing her to walk towards a pickup truck constituted a\r\n  felony of either pointing or presenting a firearm or kidnapping, and thereby\r\n  precluded an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  361 S.C. 372, 381, 605 S.E.2d\r\n  522, 526-27 (2004).Â  Here, Spencer R. maintains the court's analysis in Reese provides the only applicable clarification of the term &quot;present,&quot; and\r\n  because he did not wave his firearm, insufficient evidence exists to support\r\n  his conviction for presenting a firearm.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe implication from the\r\n  court's discussion in Reese and Cabrera-Pena is that either\r\n  &quot;waving&quot; or &quot;showing&quot; a gun at someone in a direct, actively\r\n  aggressive, and threatening manner constitutes presenting a firearm.Â \r\n  Additionally, in both cases the victims were in close proximity to the\r\n  defendants.Â  The case at bar presents a more ambiguous set of facts because Spencer\r\n  R. displayed his assault rifle in the view of Mrs. L., Angela B., and Brett C.\r\n  while sitting on his driveway a couple of houses away from the bus stop.Â  Because\r\n  the phrase &quot;to present&quot; has not been defined in either statutory or\r\n  case law, the task of determining the plain and ordinary meaning of the term\r\n  &quot;to present&quot; requires an examination of the term as it arises in\r\n  other contexts.Â  See State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 366, 574\r\n  S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002) (&quot;When faced with an undefined statutory\r\n  term, the court must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary\r\n  meaning.&quot;).\r\nAlthough various definitions\r\n  of the infinitive &quot;to present&quot; exist, two definitions in particular\r\n  apply in the area of presenting firearms: &quot;to offer to view: show,&quot;\r\n  and &quot;to aim, point, or to direct (as a weapon) so as to face something or\r\n  in a particular direction.&quot; Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 921 (10th ed. 1993).Â  There is no formal legal definition of the term &quot;to\r\n  present&quot; a firearm.Â  See Black's Law Dictionary 1221-22 (8th\r\n  ed. 2004).Â  While these two definitions provide some guidance, our court has\r\n  recognized the inquiry cannot end here.Â  See Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of\r\n    Appeals for City of Beaufort, 346 S.C. 401, 409, 552 S.E.2d 42, 46 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001) (&quot;[W]e are reluctant to rely upon either a dictionary or cases\r\n  that have relied upon a dictionary for a definitive answer as to the definition\r\n  . . . when extensive case law exists that provides an accurate and reliable\r\n  definition for the term.&quot;).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nState legislatures in other\r\n  jurisdictions have enacted similar statutes criminalizing the presenting of a\r\n  firearm, but they have not employed the exact phrasing of &quot;to\r\n  present&quot; as provided in section 16-23-410 of the South Carolina Code. Instead,\r\n  they describe the crime as &quot;exhibiting&quot; or &quot;brandishing&quot; a\r\n  firearm.Â  See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Â§ 417(a)(2) (2009) (&quot;Every\r\n  person who, except in self-defense, in the presence of any other person, draws\r\n  or exhibits any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, in a rude, angry, or\r\n  threatening manner, or who in any manner, unlawfully uses a firearm in any\r\n  fight or quarrel is punishable as follows . . . .&quot;); Mo. Ann. Stat. Â§\r\n  571.030(1)(4) (2009) (&quot;A person commits the crime of unlawful use of weapons\r\n  if he or she knowingly . . . [e]xhibits, in the presence of one or more\r\n  persons, any weapon readily capable of lethal use in an angry or threatening\r\n  manner . . . . &quot;); Va. Code Ann. Â§ 18.2-282(A) (2009) (&quot;It shall be\r\n  unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or\r\n  gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being\r\n  fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of\r\n  another . . . .&quot;). \r\nWhile none of these statutes\r\n  are perfectly analogous to section 16-23-410, an examination of them in the\r\n  aggregate reveals an effort by the legislatures in these jurisdictions to\r\n  prohibit not only the overt action of pointing or directing a firearm at\r\n  someone, but also the more passive action of showing or displaying a firearm in\r\n  a threatening or menacing manner.Â  Courts in these jurisdictions interpreting\r\n  their respective statutes are consistent in this view.Â  See Morris v.\r\n    Commonwealth of Va., 607 S.E.2d 110, 114-15 (Va. 2005) (holding the\r\n  defendant brandished his gun when he exhibited or exposed the weapon in a\r\n  shameless or aggressive manner); People v. Sanders, 905 P.2d 420, 457\r\n  (Cal. 1995) (&quot;The crime of brandishing consists of drawing or exhibiting,\r\n  in the presence of another person, any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, in\r\n  a rude, angry or threatening manner.&quot;); State v. Overshon, 528\r\n  S.W.2d 142, 143 (Mo. Ct. App. 1975) (&quot;[I]t [is] unlawful for a person to\r\n  exhibit, in the presence of one or more persons, a deadly weapon in a rude,\r\n  angry, or threatening manner.&quot;).Â  Thus, we define the phrase &quot;to\r\n  present&quot; a firearm in section 16-23-410 as: to offer to view in a\r\n  threatening manner, or to show in a threatening manner. This definition is\r\n  consistent with the South Carolina Supreme Court's analysis of presenting a\r\n  firearm in Reese and Cabrera-Pena and also is in accord with the\r\n  crime as it is enacted in other jurisdictions.Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe elements of presenting a\r\n  firearm are:Â  (1) presenting, (2) a loaded or unloaded firearm, (3) at another.[2]Â  See State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 264, 589 S.E.2d 6, 8 (2003).Â  Thus,\r\n  we must determine whether Spencer R. showed his rifle in a threatening manner\r\n  at Angela B., Brett C., and Mrs. L.Â  Initially, we note there is a lack of evidence\r\n  establishing Spencer R. intended to present a firearm at Brett C. and Mrs. L.Â  No\r\n  testimony proved Spencer R. intended to specifically threaten Brett C. and Mrs.\r\n  L. when Spencer R. was sitting on his property, and Mrs. L. admitted Spencer R.\r\n  did not even turn towards her or see her when she initially observed Spencer R.\r\n  holding his assault rifle.Â Â  \r\nHowever, we find sufficient\r\n  evidence in the record exists to support Spencer R.'s conviction as to Angela\r\n  B.Â  See In re John Doe, 318 S.C. 527, 534, 458 S.E.2d 556, 561\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (holding this court must affirm an adjudication of delinquency\r\n  unless it is unsupported by the evidence).Â  Here, an evaluation of the\r\n  attendant circumstances surrounding Spencer R.'s actions establishes Spencer R.\r\n  presented his assault rifle in a threatening manner at Angela B.Â  Earlier in\r\n  the morning, Brett C. heard Spencer R. say that he wanted to shoot Angela B.,\r\n  and Mrs. L. testified she received a text message from Angela B. in the morning\r\n  stating that Spencer R. wanted to shoot and kill Angela B.Â  Later that\r\n  afternoon, after Angela B. arrived at the school bus stop, Mrs. L. warned Angela\r\n  B. to quickly enter the vehicle because Spencer R. had a gun and told them to\r\n  duck as they drove by his house. Additionally, Brett C. observed Spencer R.\r\n  standing in the driveway holding the assault rifle and staring at both him and Angela\r\n  B. like he wanted to shoot them.Â  Lastly, Rodney T. testified he believed\r\n  Spencer R. was referring to Angela B. when Spencer R. stated he &quot;was going\r\n  to shoot the bitch&quot; as Spencer R. was sitting in the driveway with his assault\r\n  rifle.Â  \r\nTaken as a whole, Spencer\r\n  R.'s actions as to Angela B. were not that of an ordinary citizen engaged in\r\n  the lawful use of a firearm on his property.[3]Â \r\n  Instead, the evidence demonstrates Spencer R. deliberately intended to show his\r\n  rifle at Angela B. in a threatening manner.Â  Even though Spencer R. did not\r\n  wave or point the assault rifle directly at Angela B., his decision to sit in\r\n  view of the school bus stop for an extended period of time while displaying his\r\n  assault rifle, combined with the events occurring that day and Rodney T.'s and\r\n  Brett C.'s testimony that Spencer R. said he wanted to shoot Angela B.,\r\n  constitute sufficient evidence to uphold Spencer R.'s conviction.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Each house lot was approximately one hundred feet\r\n  wide.Â  Â \r\n[2]Â  Unlike other states where the crime of exhibiting or\r\n  brandishing a firearm is completed after a person has shown the weapon to\r\n  anyone in view, South Carolina's statute explicitly requires a firearm\r\n  to be presented at someone.Â  Compare Burton, 356 S.C. at 264, 589 S.E.2d at 8 (stating section\r\n  16-23-410 requires a firearm be presented at another person) (emphasis\r\n  added), with State v. Johnson, 964 S.W.2d 465, 468 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (holding the exhibiting of a weapon does not require that the item be observed,\r\n  but merely that evidence of, or visible signs of the existence of the item be\r\n  revealed).Â  Thus, the State must offer direct or circumstantial evidence that a\r\n  person specifically intended to present a firearm at someone before a\r\n  conviction may be sustained under section 16-23-410.Â  See State v.\r\n    Attardo, 263 S.C. 546, 550, 211 S.E.2d 868, 870 (1975) (&quot;A basic\r\n  principle of criminal law is that the State has the burden of proof as to all\r\n  of the essential elements of the crime.&quot;).Â  For example, if A was walking\r\n  from his garage to place a rifle in his truck and B drove by, the State would\r\n  have to prove A presented his rifle purposely at B and offer evidence\r\n  that A specifically intended to threaten B by presenting his rifle at her\r\n  before A could be convicted of a violation of section 16-23-410.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Our Legislature has contemplated situations in which\r\n  a person may lawfully point or present a firearm at another person and has\r\n  specifically excluded these types of acts from being punishable as a crime.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (2003) (&quot;This section must not be\r\n  construed to abridge the right of self-defense or to apply to theatricals or\r\n  like performances.&quot;).Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n[4]Â  We note the State charged Spencer R. with pointing\r\n  or presenting a firearm at Mrs. L., Angela B., and Brett C. in a single\r\n  petition.Â  Because the State did not charge Spencer R. with separate counts as\r\n  to each individual, we hold there is sufficient evidence to affirm Spencer R.'s\r\n  conviction as a whole because testimony establishes Spencer R. presented a\r\n  firearm at Angela B.Â  SeeRule 220(c),\r\n  SCACR (&quot;The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or\r\n  judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4669","title":"Gorecki v.

Lance Sheek, of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\n        LaDonna Sargent Johnson, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In this appeal, Jeffrey Gorecki (Husband) contends the\r\n  family court erred in (1) awarding Leah Gorecki (Wife) a divorce on the grounds\r\n  of physical cruelty while denying Husband a divorce on the grounds of adultery;\r\n  (2) awarding Wife 40% of the marital residence; (3) awarding Wife permanent\r\n  periodic alimony; and (4) granting Wife attorneys' fees and costs.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on\r\n  November 20, 1975.Â  They had three children during the course of their\r\n  marriage, all of whom were emancipated before the parties' separation in\r\n  September 2005. Â At the time of the hearing, Wife worked with mentally\r\n  disabled children at a middle school, and Husband worked at Cooper Power\r\n  Systems where he was earning approximately $51,000 per year. \r\nShortly after the parties\r\n  separated, Wife filed for divorce on the ground of physical cruelty,\r\n  seeking spousal and child support, equitable division of the marital estate,\r\n  and attorneys' fees.Â  Husband counterclaimed, seeking a divorce based on\r\n  adultery and requesting custody[1] of their granddaughter, equitable division of the marital estate, and\r\n  attorneys' fees.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing on\r\n  October 2 and 3, 2006, Wife testified to several instances of physical\r\n  abuse in support of her claim that Husband was physically abusive.Â  In response\r\n  to Wife's allegations of abuse, Husband claimed Wife had previously engaged in\r\n  an extramarital affair.[2]Â \r\n  After hearing testimony from both parties and their respective witnesses, the\r\n  family court issued an order on November 9, 2006, awarding Wife a divorce on\r\n  the grounds of physical cruelty.Â  The family court granted Wife $1,000 per\r\n  month in permanent periodic alimony, divided the Husband's pension and 401(k)\r\n  on a 50/50 basis, and split the marital residence on a 60/40 basis in favor of\r\n  Husband.Â  The family court also required Husband to pay $8,038.65 in Wife's\r\n  attorneys' fees and costs.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court\r\n  order, this court has authority to correct errors of law and find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.D.M.\r\n    v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  When reviewing\r\n  decisions of the family court, we are cognizant of the fact the family court\r\n  had the opportunity to see the witnesses, hear &quot;the testimony delivered\r\n  from the stand, and had the benefit of that personal observance of and contact\r\n  with the parties which is of peculiar value in arriving at a correct result in\r\n  a case of this character.&quot;Â  DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 423,\r\n  192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972) (internal citation and quotations omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Grounds for Divorce\r\nHusband contends the family\r\n  court erred in awarding Wife a divorce based on physical cruelty when he\r\n  presented evidence entitling him to a divorce based on Wife's adultery.Â  We disagree.\r\nPhysical cruelty is &quot;actual\r\n  personal violence, or such a course of physical treatment as endangers life,\r\n  limb or health, and renders cohabitation unsafe.&quot; Â Brown v. Brown,\r\n  215 S.C. 502, 508, 56 S.E.2d 330, 333 (1949). Â In considering what acts\r\n  constitute physical cruelty, the family court must consider the circumstances\r\n  of the particular case. Â Gibson v. Gibson, 283 S.C. 318, 322, 322 S.E.2d\r\n  680, 682 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  A single assault by one spouse upon the other spouse\r\n  can amount to physical cruelty.Â  McDowell v. McDowell, 300 S.C. 96, 99,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 468, 469 (Ct. App. 1989). Â The assault must, however, be life-threatening\r\n  or must be either indicative of an intention to do serious bodily harm or of\r\n  such a degree as to raise a reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm in the\r\n  future. Â Gibson, 283 S.C. at 323, 322 S.E.2d at 683. Â The party alleging\r\n  physical cruelty has the burden of proving it by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Wood v. Wood, 269 S.C. 600, 605, 239 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1977).Â \r\n  A &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; is evidence which convinces as to\r\n  its truth. Â DuBose, 259 S.C. at 424, 192 S.E.2d at 331.Â  \r\nSimilarly, proof of adultery\r\n  must be &quot;clear and positive and the infidelity must be established by a\r\n  clear preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Â McLaurin v. McLaurin, 294\r\n  S.C. 132, 133, 363 S.E.2d 110, 111 (Ct. App. 1987) (internal citation and\r\n  quotations omitted). Â Because of the &quot;clandestine nature&quot; of\r\n  adultery, obtaining evidence of the commission of the act by the testimony of\r\n  eyewitnesses is rarely possible, so direct evidence is not necessary to\r\n  establish the charge. Â Fulton v. Fulton, 293 S.C. 146, 147, 359 S.E.2d\r\n  88, 88 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Accordingly, adultery may be proven by circumstantial\r\n  evidence; however, evidence placing a spouse and a third party together on\r\n  several occasions, without more, does not warrant a finding of adultery.Â  Hartley\r\n    v. Hartley, 292 S.C. 245, 246-47, 355 S.E.2d 869, 871 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nGenerally, &quot;proof [of\r\n  adultery] must be sufficiently definite to identify the time and place of the\r\n  offense and the circumstances under which it was committed.&quot; Â Loftis v.\r\n    Loftis, 284 S.C. 216, 218, 325 S.E.2d 73, 74 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  when issues relate to proof regarding which party, if either, is entitled to a\r\n  divorce, and the evidence is conflicting and susceptible of different\r\n  inferences, it becomes the family court's duty to determine not only the law of\r\n  the case but the facts as well because the family court observed the witnesses\r\n  and could determine how much credence to give each witness's testimony. Â Anders\r\n    v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985).\r\nIn this case, Wife testified\r\n  to many instances of physical abuse at the hands of Husband over the course of\r\n  their marriage.Â  She stated Husband\r\n  slapped her, pushed her into a wall, and knocked her to the ground while they\r\n  lived in Michigan in the 1980s. Â Wife also claimed Husband continued to abuse\r\n  her when they were living in South Carolina, including instances of Husband\r\n  hitting, shoving, slapping, and cursing at her, which resulted in Wife calling\r\n  police several times and being hospitalized on one occasion. Â At least one of these episodes was documented by a\r\n  police incident report and photographs of Wife's bruises.Â  The parties' eldest daughter corroborated Wife's\r\n  account of Husband's abuse at the hearing.Â  In contrast to her older sister, the\r\n  parties' youngest daughter stated that while her parents argued, she\r\n  never witnessed Husband physically abuse Wife, and to her knowledge, he had\r\n  never hit or pushed Wife.Â  Â Â \r\nAccording to Wife, although\r\n  she and Husband had separated numerous times over the course of their\r\n  thirty-one-year marriage, she finally decided to leave Husband in\r\n  September 2005 after he shoved her into a wall, verbally abused her and their\r\n  grandchild, and then broke her phone when she tried to call for help.Â  Wife\r\n  testified she was in serious fear of bodily harm as a result of this incident,\r\n  and even when he was not abusing her, she felt constantly threatened and under\r\n  his control.Â  \r\nWe find the September 2005\r\n  assault sufficient to grant Wife a divorce based on physical cruelty.Â  See McDowell, 300 S.C. at 99, 386 S.E.2d at 469 (&quot;A single assault by\r\n  one spouse upon the other spouse can constitute physical cruelty . . . [if it\r\n  is] life threatening or . . . indicative of an intention to do seriously bodily\r\n  harm or of such a degree as to raise a reasonable apprehension of great bodily\r\n  harm in the future.&quot;).Â  In any event, the numerous instances of abuse,\r\n  culminating in the September 2005 assault, indicate Husband's intent to\r\n  seriously harm Wife, which warrants a divorce based on physical cruelty. Â See Brown, 215 S.C. at 508, 56 S.E.2d at 333 (&quot;Continued acts of\r\n  personal violence producing physical pain or bodily injury and a fear of future\r\n  danger are recognized as sufficient cause for a divorce for cruelty in nearly\r\n  all jurisdictions . . .&quot;). Â The testimony elicited at the final hearing\r\n  proved that Husband's repeated cycle of abusive behavior over the course of\r\n  their marriage caused Wife to reasonably fear for her safety.Â  See Gibson, 283 S.C. at 323, 322 S.E.2d at 683 (stating an assault not\r\n  resulting in actual bodily injury may constitute physical cruelty when it\r\n  causes reasonable fear of serious danger or bodily harm in the future).Â  Moreover,\r\n  the family court specifically found Wife's testimony and that of her witnesses to\r\n  be more credible than that of Husband and his witnesses.Â  Based on the\r\n  testimony and evidence presented at the final hearing, we discern no error in\r\n  the family court's decision to grant Wife a divorce on the grounds of physical\r\n  cruelty.Â  See Tinsley v. Tinsley, 326 S.C. 374, 380, 483 S.E.2d\r\n  198, 201 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding the determination\r\n  of whether conduct falls within the meaning of physical cruelty is governed by\r\n  the particular circumstances of each\r\n  case).Â  \r\nRegarding Husband's\r\n  contention that the family court erred in failing to grant him a divorce on the\r\n  grounds of adultery, we find Husband's proof of adultery was insufficient.Â  \r\nIn support of his claim,\r\n  Husband called their son's ex-girlfriend, Nikki Hastings (Nikki), to testify at\r\n  the hearing.Â  Nikki stated she engaged in sexual relations with Wife on several\r\n  occasions after Wife revealed she had romantic feelings for her.Â  When\r\n  questioned by Wife's counsel, Nikki denied spreading rumors about sexual\r\n  encounters she claimed to have had with other women in the community.Â  \r\nWife denied these allegations\r\n  and stated Nikki had fabricated this story when Wife and Husband told Nikki\r\n  that she would have to move out of their residence after Wife caught Nikki viewing\r\n  pornographic websites.Â  Wife's half-sister testified on behalf of Wife and\r\n  stated she was certain Wife had never engaged in any homosexual relationships.Â \r\n  Susan Mohr, a mutual friend of Husband and Wife, stated Nikki had lied about\r\n  other sexual relationships with women in the past.Â  Another witness, Hope\r\n  Jonda, testified her family had allowed Nikki to live with them for a period of\r\n  time after Nikki was kicked out of her home.Â  Hope stated her mother had to ask\r\n  Nikki to move out because her mother could not handle Nikki due to Nikki's\r\n  emotional and behavioral issues.Â  Nikki then began to tell others that Hope and\r\n  she were engaged in a homosexual relationship, which was untrue. Â \r\nHusband stated Nikki\r\n  approached him about her adulterous relationship with Wife, but besides Nikki's\r\n  testimony, Husband introduced no corroborating evidence to substantiate his\r\n  claim that Wife had an extramarital affair.Â  Further, Husband set forth no testimony, either direct or\r\n  circumstantial, identifying the time, place, or circumstances of Wife's alleged\r\n  adulterous acts.Â  See Brown v. Brown, 379 S.C. 271, 278, 665\r\n  S.E.2d 174, 178 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding proof of adultery must be &quot;sufficiently\r\n  definite to identify the time and place of the offense and the circumstances\r\n  under which it was committed&quot;).Â  Wife denied any desire to engage in a\r\n  homosexual relationship, and Nikki identified only one specific occasionâ€”the\r\n  night of her 18th birthday at the Gorecki's homeâ€”where she and Wife had the\r\n  opportunity to commit adultery.Â  When Nikki testified to this sexual encounter,\r\n  she provided no details.Â  Nikki vaguely stated that it occurred between three\r\n  to five more times before their relationship terminated but failed to identify\r\n  the time, place, or circumstances surrounding these other alleged\r\n  interactions.Â  Id.Â  (stating adultery may be proven by circumstantial\r\n  evidence, but the evidence must be sufficiently definite to establish both a\r\n  disposition to commit the offense and the opportunity to do so).Â  \r\nImportantly, the family court\r\n  found Husband and his witnesses' testimony to be less credible than that of\r\n  Wife, which merits our deference based on the family court's ability to observe\r\n  witnesses and assess their credibility.Â  See Anders, 285 S.C. at\r\n  514, 331 S.E.2d at 341 (stating that when issues relate to proof regarding\r\n  which party, if either, is entitled to a divorce, and the evidence is conflicting\r\n  and susceptible of different inferences, it becomes the family court's duty to\r\n  determine not only the law of the case but the facts as well because the family\r\n  court observed the witnesses and could determine how much credence to give each\r\n  witness's testimony). Â Accordingly, the family court properly denied Husband a\r\n  divorce on the grounds of adultery.\r\n2. Marital Estate \r\nHusband claims the family\r\n  court erred in awarding him only 60% of the value of the marital residence\r\n  because Husband paid off a portion of the home with his inheritance. Â We\r\n  disagree.\r\nMarital property includes all\r\n  real and personal property the parties acquired during the marriage and owned\r\n  as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation. Â S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2009) (formerly S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(A) (Supp. 2007)).\r\n  Â The ultimate goal of apportionment is to divide the marital estate, as a\r\n  whole, in a manner which fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to the\r\n  economic partnership. Â Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 298, 372 S.E.2d\r\n  107, 112 (Ct. App. 1988). Â &quot;Upon dissolution of the marriage, property\r\n  acquired during the marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner\r\n  which fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to its acquisition, regardless\r\n  of which spouse holds legal title.&quot; Â Id. at 293, 372 S.E.2d at 109.\r\n  Â The division of marital property is within the family court's sound discretion\r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Â Craig\r\n    v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005).Â  The appellate\r\n  court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment. Â Deidun v. Deidun,\r\n  362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nThe family court's division\r\n  of the marital home was proper.Â  The parties purchased the mobile home at issue\r\n  in 1998, which renders it marital property.Â  See Â§ 20-3-630(A) (stating\r\n  marital property is all real and personal property acquired during the marriage\r\n  and owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation).Â  The\r\n  mobile home and surrounding acreage were appraised at $70,000, and at the time\r\n  of the order, the mortgage on the home was $25,000, leaving $45,000 in equity\r\n  to be divided between Husband and Wife. \r\nHusband testified he received\r\n  $100,000 from his father as an inheritance, and he spent a portion of this\r\n  inheritance to improve the marital residence.Â  Husband fails to establish the\r\n  specific dollar amount he spent from his inheritance, contending in his brief\r\n  that &quot;a remaining portion of this inheritance was placed into the marital\r\n  home,&quot; and stating at the hearing that he spent &quot;almost half of it on\r\n  [the marital residence] if you're gonna include tractors and everything else to\r\n  improve the land . . . .&quot;Â  Regardless, the family court took Husband's\r\n  expenditures from his inheritance into consideration by giving Husband 10% more\r\n  of the marital estate than Wife as well as awarding Husband the tractors and\r\n  equipment on the land that he purchased with his inheritance.Â  Accordingly, we discern\r\n  no error in the family court's decision to allocate 60% of the marital\r\n  residence's equity to Husband.\r\n3. Alimony\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court's alimony award to Wife was excessive.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of\r\n  alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be\r\n  disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Â Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351\r\n  S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs if\r\n  the court's ruling is controlled by an error of law or if the ruling is based\r\n  upon findings of fact that are without evidentiary support. Â Sharps v.\r\n    Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, 535 S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000).\r\n&quot;The purpose\r\n  of alimony is to provide the ex-spouse a substitute for the support which was\r\n  incident to the former marital relationship.&quot; Â Love v. Love, 367\r\n  S.C. 493, 497, 626 S.E.2d 56, 58 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;Generally, alimony\r\n  should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same\r\n  position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.&quot; Â Craig, 365 S.C. at 292, 617 S.E.2d at\r\n  362 (internal citations omitted). Â The objective of alimony should be to insure\r\n  that the parties separate on as equal a basis as possible. Â Patel v. Patel,\r\n  347 S.C. 281, 291, 555 S.E.2d 386, 391 (2001). Â Thus, &quot;[i]t is the duty of\r\n  the family court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if\r\n  the claim is well founded.&quot; Â Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554\r\n  S.E.2d 412, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nWhen awarding\r\n  alimony, the family court considers the following factors: (1) duration of the\r\n  marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational\r\n  background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the\r\n  parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current\r\n  and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably\r\n  anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of\r\n  the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11)\r\n  tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the\r\n  court considers relevant. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2009); Patel,\r\n  347 S.C. at 290, 555 S.E.2d at 391 (holding that the family court is required\r\n  to consider all relevant factors in determining alimony).\r\nThe family court\r\n  awarded Wife $1,000 per month in permanent periodic alimony.Â  In granting Wife\r\n  alimony, the family court considered the length of the marriage, Husband's and\r\n  Wife's education, the parties' health, Husband's greater income and ability to\r\n  pay alimony, and Wife's need for alimony based on the differences in their\r\n  standards of living.Â Â  The family court properly considered these relevant\r\n  statutory factors from section 20-3-130(C) to insure Wife would be able to\r\n  maintain a standard of living similar to what she enjoyed during the parties'\r\n  marriage.Â  See Craig, 365 S.C. at 292, 617 S.E.2d at 362 (&quot;Generally,\r\n  alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the\r\n  same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.&quot;). Â \r\nHusband's claim\r\n  that Wife is not entitled to alimony because she is underemployed is unfounded\r\n  because she works full-time as an aide to mentally disabled children in the\r\n  public school system and based on her education and past employments, she is\r\n  working to her full earning potential.Â  Moreover, Husband has the ability to\r\n  pay Wife the ordered alimony based on his monthly earnings of $4,300, which is\r\n  far superior to Wife's monthly wages.Â  Any reduction in Wife's alimony would\r\n  serve to penalize Wife when she has already attempted to defray her expenses by\r\n  maintaining full-time employment and her own health benefits.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  family court's award of alimony to Wife was appropriate.\r\n4. Attorneys' Fees \r\nHusband argues if this court\r\n  finds Husband was entitled to a divorce based on Wife's adultery, we should\r\n  reverse the award of $8,038.65 in attorneys' fees to Wife. Â Our finding that\r\n  Husband failed to establish Wife committed adultery disposes of Husband's\r\n  argument regarding the propriety of paying Wife's attorneys' fees.Â  See Whiteside\r\n    v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886,\r\n  889 (1993) (stating appellate courts need not address remaining issues when\r\n  resolution of prior issue is dispositive); Haselden v. Haselden, 347\r\n  S.C. 48, 65, 552 S.E.2d 329, 338 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding one of the husband's\r\n  arguments regarding attorneys' fees without merit when that argument to\r\n  overturn the award was based on his unsuccessful contention that the family\r\n  court's contempt ruling was in error).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family\r\n  court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The child custody issue was resolved prior to the\r\n  final hearing.Â Â  \r\n[2] Husband also\r\n  claimed Wife engaged in two other extramarital affairs but conceded they\r\n  reconciled after both of those alleged affairs occurred.

Cartrette, pro se, for Appellant.\r\n        Lake E. Summers, of Columbia, for Respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.: Billy Joe Cartrette filed a grievance with the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Corrections concerning conditions of his participation\r\n  in the Prison Industries Program (PIP).Â  Cartrette appeals the circuit court's\r\n  order remanding his case to the Administrative Law Court (ALC) for a\r\n  determination of the prevailing wage for similar work, reversing the ALC's\r\n  finding that Cartrette was an employee of the private sponsor, affirming the\r\n  ALC's denial of overtime wages, and affirming the ALC's denial of reimbursement\r\n  for certain pay deductions.[1]Â  We reverse as to overtime wages, remand that issue\r\n  to the ALC for further proceedings as outlined in this opinion, and affirm the\r\n  circuit court's decisions on all remaining issues.[2]Â \r\nAfter we issued our original opinion affirming in part and reversing in part, both parties petitioned for rehearing.  We deny Cartrette's petition for rehearing, grant the Department's petition for rehearing, withdraw our previous opinion, and substitute this opinion. \r\nFACTS\r\nCartrette was an inmate of\r\n  the Ridgeland Correctional Institution.Â  As a participant in PIP, Cartrette\r\n  provided on-site labor at the Ridgeland Correctional Institution, sometimes\r\n  working in excess of ninety hours per two-week period, for PIP sponsor Kwalu\r\n  Furniture.Â  Cartrette was compensated at a rate of $5.50 per hour.Â  Cartrette\r\n  filed a grievance with the Department complaining his hourly wage was\r\n  insufficient compared to the prevailing wage for similar work performed in the\r\n  private sector.Â  He asserted non-inmate employees earned $11.00 to $14.00 per\r\n  hour for the same work.Â  Cartrette further complained he did not receive\r\n  additional pay for overtime hours and the Department improperly withheld funds\r\n  from his paychecks.Â  Specifically, Cartrette challenged as unconstitutional the\r\n  withholding of funds for his room and board and additional funds for Victim's\r\n  Assistance.[3]Â  \r\nThe Department denied\r\n  Cartrette's grievance, and Cartrette appealed to the ALC.Â  The ALC reversed the\r\n  Department's refusal to pay Cartrette the prevailing wage and found the\r\n  prevailing wage was $5.25.Â  Furthermore, the ALC affirmed the Department's\r\n  denials of overtime and reimbursement for wage deductions.Â  \r\nBoth Cartrette and the\r\n  Department then appealed to the circuit court.Â  After a hearing, the circuit\r\n  court found $5.25 was not the prevailing wage and remanded that issue to the\r\n  ALC with seven questions for the ALC to consider in determining the correct\r\n  prevailing wage.Â  The circuit court reversed the ALC's apparent finding that Cartrette\r\n  &quot;worked for . . . or was otherwise ever an employee of Kwalu.&quot;Â \r\n  Finally, the circuit court affirmed the ALC's determinations Cartrette was\r\n  ineligible for overtime or reimbursement of wage deductions for room and board\r\n  and for Victims Assistance.Â  Cartrette now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe ALC has subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) to hear properly\r\n  perfected appeals from the Department's final orders in administrative or\r\n  non-collateral matters.Â  Slezak v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 361 S.C. 327,\r\n  331, 605 S.E.2d 506, 507 (2004).Â  Our standard of review derives from the APA.Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 379, 527 S.E.2d 742, 755 (2000).Â  We\r\n  may affirm, remand, reverse, or modify the appealed decision if the appellant's\r\n  substantive rights have suffered prejudice because the decision is:Â Â  \r\n\r\n  (a)Â Â  in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n    provisions; \r\n  (b)Â  in excess of the statutory authority of the\r\n    agency; \r\n  (c)Â Â  made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n  (d)Â  affected by other error of law; \r\n  (e)Â Â  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n    probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n  (f)Â Â  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by\r\n    abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Overtime Pay\r\nCartrette contends he is\r\n  entitled to time-and-a-half pay for overtime worked.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, a\r\n  non-inmate employee's right of action for overtime pay lies in Â§&nbsp;207(a)(1)\r\n  of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 201-219\r\n  (1998 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  Under the FLSA, non-inmate workers receive\r\n  compensation at a rate of one and one-half times their hourly rate for hours\r\n  worked in excess of forty per week.Â  29 U.S.C.A. Â§&nbsp;207(a)(2) (1998).Â  This\r\n  court recently examined the legislative intent underlying the FLSA and found:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    purpose of the FLSA is to protect &quot;the rights of those who toil, of those\r\n    who sacrifice a full measure of their freedom and talents to the use and profit\r\n    of others.&quot;Â  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No.\r\n      123, 321 U.S. 590, 597, 64 S.Ct. 698, 88 L.Ed. 949 (1944).Â  The FLSA was\r\n    enacted in response to a congressional finding that some industries, engaged in\r\n    commerce, maintained labor conditions which were detrimental to a minimum\r\n    standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and the general well-being\r\n    of workers.Â  See 29 U.S.C. Â§ 202(a) (1998).Â  The Act attempts to\r\n    eliminate unfair labor practices without substantially curtailing employment or\r\n    earning power.Â  29 U.S.C. Â§ 202(b). Because the FLSA is remedial and\r\n    humanitarian in purpose, it should be broadly interpreted and applied to\r\n    effectuate its goals.Â  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co., 321 U.S. at\r\n    597, 64 S.Ct. 698; Benshoff v. City of Virginia Beach, 180 F.3d 136 (4th\r\n    Cir. 1999).\r\n\r\nMiller v. Blumenthal\r\n  Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 221, 616\r\n  S.E.2d 722, 730 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\nOur supreme court has held\r\n  the FLSA does not extend to inmate workers because, for purposes of payment of\r\n  wages, inmate workers are not employees of PIP sponsors. Â Williams v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Corr., 372 S.C. 255, 260, 641 S.E.2d 885, 888 (2007).Â  Other courts,\r\n  including the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, have also\r\n  declined to extend the protections of the FLSA and state labor statutes to\r\n  inmates.Â  See, e.g., Harker v. State Use Indus., 990 F.2d 131,\r\n  135 (4th Cir. 1993). \r\nNonetheless, South Carolina\r\n  law requires that inmate workers in a PIP enjoy pay and working conditions\r\n  comparable to those enjoyed by non-inmate workers.Â  According to our supreme\r\n  court, the overall purpose of these statutes &quot;is to prevent unfair\r\n  competition.&quot;Â  Adkins v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 360 S.C. 413, 418,\r\n  602 S.E.2d 51, 54 (2004).Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    [Department] must determine prior to using inmate labor in a [PIP] that it will\r\n    not displace employed workers, that the locality does not have a surplus of\r\n    available labor for the skills, crafts, or trades that would utilize inmate\r\n    labor, and that the rates of pay and other conditions of employment are not\r\n    less than those paid and provided for work of [a] similar nature in the\r\n    locality in which the work is performed.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-315\r\n  (2007).Â  &quot;No inmate participating in [PIP] may earn less than the\r\n  prevailing wage for work of [a] similar nature in the private sector.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D) (2007).Â  &quot;Inmate participation in the program may\r\n  not result in the displacement of employed workers in the State of South\r\n  Carolina and may not impair existing contracts for services.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§24-3-430(E) (2007).Â  While inmates are not entitled to a private right of\r\n  action in tort, they may protest through the grievance process the Department's\r\n  failure to comply with these statutes.Â  Adkins, 360 S.C. at 419, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 55.Â  \r\nWe expand upon the analysis\r\n  of this issue in our original opinion, as that analysis appears to have been incomplete.Â \r\n  Cartrette properly brought this matter as a grievance and alleged the\r\n  Department denied him time-and-a-half overtime wages for the hours he worked\r\n  beyond forty each week.Â  As observed above, both federal and South Carolina\r\n  courts have held inmate workers do not qualify as &quot;employees&quot; and are\r\n  therefore excluded from the coverage of the FLSA.[4]Â  See Williams, 372 S.C. at 260, 641 S.E.2d at 888; Harker,\r\n  990 F.2d at 135.Â  However, our General Assembly has required the Department to\r\n  ensure inmate workers receive &quot;rates of pay and other conditions of\r\n  employment&quot; comparable to those afforded non-inmate workers performing\r\n  similar labor in the same locality.Â  See Â§ 24-3-315.Â  Consequently, we\r\n  hold that although the FLSA does not apply to inmate workers, sections 24-3-315\r\n  and 24-3-430(D) compel the Department to ensure inmate workers who are employed\r\n  under those sections receive the same pay rates and employment conditions as\r\n  their non-inmate peers.[5]Â  \r\nThe statutory mandate of\r\n  comparable pay rates and employment conditions does not expressly exclude\r\n  time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours worked.Â  Instead, sections 24-3-315 and\r\n  24-3-430(E) require that inmate workers receive comparable compensation and prohibit inmate workers from displacing non-inmate workers.Â  These provisions\r\n  appear to support Cartrette's argument for overtime pay.Â  Failure of the\r\n  Department's contracts with PIP sponsors to provide inmate workers with\r\n  time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours when their non-inmate counterparts\r\n  receive it would create an impermissible and unfair advantage for inmate labor\r\n  over private labor.Â  Moreover, any failure on the Department's behalf to pay\r\n  inmates time-and-a-half overtime pay when non-inmate workers receive it for\r\n  comparable work in the same area contradicts the Department's obligation under section\r\n  24-3-315.[6]Â \r\n  Consequently, the circuit court erred in denying Cartrette time-and-a-half pay\r\n  for overtime work without first determining whether non-inmate workers\r\n  performing the same work in the same locality receive time-and-a-half pay for\r\n  overtime.[7]Â  \r\nIn addition, we observe\r\n  section 24-3-430(D) requires inmates receive the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; paid\r\n  to their non-inmate peers for comparable work.Â  However, the question of the\r\n  prevailing wage to which Cartrette is entitled has been remanded to the ALC for\r\n  further proceedings.Â  We nonetheless have jurisdiction to consider whether the\r\n  prevailing wage language of section 24-3-430(D) entitles Cartrette to overtime\r\n  pay because the issue remanded concerned the proper hourly rate, only.Â \r\n  However, because we have found section 24-3-315 resolves Cartrette's dispute, we\r\n  need not address this argument.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding\r\n  appellate court need not discuss remaining issues when decision on prior issue\r\n  disposes of appeal).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's decision concerning overtime pay and remand this\r\n  issue to the ALC for a determination of whether the Department failed to pay\r\n  Cartrette at the time-and-a-half rate for the hours he worked in excess of\r\n  forty per week.Â  In the event of such a failure, we instruct the ALC to\r\n  determine the rate of compensation to which Cartrette was entitled, the number\r\n  of overtime hours that were underpaid, and the amount the Department owes\r\n  Cartrette for his labor. Â Â \r\nII. Remaining Issues\r\nWith\r\n  regard to Cartrette's remaining issues, we affirm based upon the following\r\n  authorities:Â  \r\n1. As\r\n  to the circuit court's remand to the ALC for determination of the prevailing\r\n  wage:Â  Condor, Inc. v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, City of N. Charleston, 328\r\n  S.C. 173, 178, 493 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1997) (preventing an appellant from arguing\r\n  on appeal an issue conceded in the trial court); Bowman v. Bowman, 357\r\n  S.C. 146, 160, 591 S.E.2d 654, 661 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding a party cannot seek\r\n  and receive a particular result at trial and then challenge it on appeal).Â  \r\n2.Â  As\r\n  to whether Cartrette was an employee of the private sponsor:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-3-40(A) (2007) (&quot;Unless otherwise provided by law, the employer of a\r\n  prisoner authorized to work . . . in a prison industry program provided under\r\n  Article 3 of this chapter shall pay the prisoner's wages directly to the\r\n  Department of Corrections.&quot;); Williams v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 372\r\n  S.C. 255, 258-59, 641 S.E.2d 885, 887 (2007) (holding a prison industries\r\n  program sponsor is not an employer of inmates because the sponsor does not\r\n  exclusively control the payment of inmate wages and finding agreement among\r\n  other jurisdictions that examined this issue).Â  \r\n3.Â  As\r\n  to whether Cartrette is entitled to reimbursement of monies deducted from his\r\n  pay for room and board because he was double-billed for this cost:Â  Rule\r\n  210(h), SCACR (limiting appellate review to facts appearing in the record on\r\n  appeal); State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 199, 498 S.E.2d 642, 647\r\n  (1998) (placing on appellant the burden of presenting a sufficient record to\r\n  allow appellate review).Â  \r\n4. As\r\n  to whether Cartrette is entitled to reimbursement of monies deducted from his\r\n  pay for room and board because the deduction was unconstitutional: Â S.C. Const.\r\n  art. XII, Â§ 2 (&quot;The General Assembly shall establish institutions for the\r\n  confinement of all persons convicted of such crimes as may be designated by\r\n  law, and shall provide for the custody, maintenance, health, welfare, education,\r\n  and rehabilitation of the inmates.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (2007)\r\n  (allocating portions of inmates' wages for restitution, the State Office of\r\n  Victim Assistance, child support, room and board, and inmate use); Brown v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d\r\n  410, 414 (2002) (&quot;An appellate court cannot construe a statute without\r\n  regard to its plain meaning and may not resort to a forced interpretation in an\r\n  attempt to expand or limit the scope of a statute.&quot;).Â  \r\n5. As\r\n  to whether Cartrette is entitled to reimbursement of monies deducted from his\r\n  pay for victim's assistance because inmate wages are outside the funds\r\n  available for appropriations by the General Assembly:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40\r\n  (2007) (allocating portions of inmates' wages for restitution, the State Office\r\n  of Victim Assistance, child support, room and board, and inmate use); S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-1260 (2003) (requiring persons convicted of criminal acts to\r\n  reimburse the State and directing such payments to be made from inmate wages to\r\n  the State Office of Victim Assistance); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1290 (2003)\r\n  (establishing Victim's Compensation Fund from which State Office of Victim\r\n  Assistance may pay victims' claims).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find sections 24-3-315 and\r\n  24-3-430(D) entitle inmate workers in a PIP to pay and working conditions\r\n  comparable to those enjoyed by workers in private industry, including\r\n  time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours worked.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  circuit court's decision on this issue and remand to the ALC for additional\r\n  proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm\r\n  the circuit court's decision on the remaining issues.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nPIEPER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part:\r\nI concur in the majority's\r\n  conclusion to affirm the decision to remand to determine a prevailing wage.Â  I\r\n  also concur in the determination that the inmate is not an employee of the\r\n  private sponsor or entitled to reimbursement for room and board and other\r\n  costs.Â  However, I respectfully dissent as to any finding that the inmate is\r\n  entitled to overtime pay.Â  Section 24-3-430 establishes an inmate's right to\r\n  the prevailing wage, stating &quot;[n]o inmate participating in the program may\r\n  earn less than the prevailing wage for work of similar nature in the private\r\n  sector.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D) (2007).Â  Our supreme court\r\n  recognizes that a critical purpose of the prevailing wage provision is to\r\n  prevent unfair competition.Â  Adkins v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 360 S.C.\r\n  413, 418, 602 S.E.2d 51, 54 (2004).Â  Nonetheless, I would distinguish between\r\n  prevailing wages and any right to overtime pay for inmates participating in a\r\n  prison industries program.Â  In fact, there is no authority within the\r\n  applicable state statutory scheme recognizing any right to overtime pay for\r\n  inmates.[8]Â  See Â§ 24-3-430(D) (2007) (stating only that no inmate participating in\r\n  the program may earn less than the prevailing wage).Â  Moreover, the inmate\r\n  never specifically raised the issue of whether a particular federal program\r\n  provides for the right to overtime pay.Â Â  \r\nWhile the Fair Labor\r\n  Standards Act (FLSA) provides a right to overtime pay for certain employees,\r\n  the protections of the act do not apply to inmates working within the prison\r\n  setting.Â  See Harker v. State Use Indus., 990 F.2d 131, 136 (4th\r\n  Cir. 1993) (&quot;For more than fifty years, Congress has operated on the\r\n  assumption that the FLSA does not apply to inmate labor. If the FLSA's coverage\r\n  is to extend within prison walls, Congress must say so, not the\r\n  courts.&quot;).Â  As noted by the Fourth Circuit in Harker, inmates\r\n  participating in these types of programs perform work not to &quot;turn profits\r\n  for their supposed employer, but rather as a means of rehabilitation and job\r\n  training.&quot;Â  Id. at 133.Â  \r\nIn sum, I am not convinced\r\n  the current statutory scheme provides for overtime pay to inmates.Â  Inmates are\r\n  not employees entitled to the protections of the FLSA, and I do not find it\r\n  appropriate to read into the prevailing wage statute any such right to inmates\r\n  voluntarily participating in a prison industries program.[9]Â \r\n  As Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit has explained: \r\n\r\n  People\r\n    are not imprisoned for the purpose of enabling them to earn a living. Â The\r\n    prison pays for their keep.Â  If it puts them to work, it is to offset some of\r\n    the cost of keeping them, or to keep them out of mischief, or to ease their\r\n    transition to the world outside, or to equip them with skills and habits that\r\n    will make them less likely to return to crime outside.Â  None of these goals is\r\n    compatible with federal regulation of their wages and hours.Â  The reason the\r\n    FLSA contains no express exception for prisoners is probably that the idea was\r\n    too outlandish to occur to anyone when the legislation was under consideration\r\n    by Congress. \r\n\r\nBennett v. Frank, 395 F.3d 409, 410 (7th Cir. 2005).Â  Accordingly, I\r\n  concur in the decision of the majority to affirm the circuit court and remand\r\n  to the ALC to determine a prevailing wage; however, I respectfully dissent as\r\n  to the overtime issue, and I would affirm the finding of the ALC and the\r\n  circuit court that the inmate is not entitled to overtime pay. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This appeal is being considered alongside S.C. Dep't\r\n  of Corr. v. George Lee Tomlin.Â  The material facts, substantive arguments,\r\n  and procedural postures of these two appeals are identical.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1290 (2003)\r\n  (establishing Victim's Compensation Fund from which State Office of Victim\r\n  Assistance may pay victims' claims); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1260 (2003)\r\n  (requiring persons convicted of criminal acts to reimburse the State and\r\n  directing such payments to be made from inmate wages to the State Office of\r\n  Victim Assistance).Â  \r\n[4] We specifically reject Cartrette's contention that Hamilton\r\n  v. Daniel Int'l Corp., 273 S.C. 409, 257 S.E.2d 157 (1979), established his\r\n  right to time-and-a-half pay for overtime work.Â  Although the Hamilton court cited to statutory language similar to that found in section 24-3-315, it\r\n  did not contemplate overtime work.Â  Id. at 410, 257 S.E.2d at 158.Â  The\r\n  issue in that case concerned the right of an inmate participating in a\r\n  work-release program to benefits under the Worker's Compensation Act.Â  Id. at 410-11, 257 S.E.2d at 158.Â  \r\n[5] While the Department argues our opinion impacts three\r\n  of its PIPs, this opinion is limited solely to the program in which Cartrette\r\n  was involved and that was promulgated and operated pursuant to sections\r\n  24-3-315 and 24-3-430.Â  \r\n[6] In its petition for rehearing, the Department declares\r\n  the majority's analysis of section 24-3-430's provision of a prevailing wage\r\n  for inmate labor &quot;obviously overlooked the explicit intent of our General\r\n  Assembly&quot; regarding inmate labor.Â  The Department cites section 24-3-310\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2007), which indicates the purposes of inmate labor\r\n  include self-maintenance, reimbursement of the State, restitution, and child\r\n  support.Â  In our opinion, these purposes harmonize with the General Assembly's\r\n  mandate that inmate labor not unfairly compete with non-inmate labor.Â  See Â§Â§ 24-3-315 &amp; -430(E); see also Adkins, 360 S.C. at 418, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 54 (finding the overall purpose of these statutes &quot;is to prevent\r\n  unfair competition&quot;).Â  By statute, seventy percent or more of each inmate\r\n  worker's pay is diverted for restitution, victim's programs, child support,\r\n  room and board, or taxes.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (2007).Â  Increased pay,\r\n  including overtime pay, for inmate workers ultimately benefits the Department\r\n  by increasing the funds available to relieve the burden of inmate housing and\r\n  care; benefits crime victims, both directly through fulfillment of inmates' restitution\r\n  obligations and indirectly by funding state agencies that provide victim\r\n  assistance; and benefits inmates' minor children by increasing the amount\r\n  available for child support.Â  We believe that in crafting these statutes, our\r\n  General Assembly carefully balanced its desire to maximize inmates' financial contributions\r\n  against the need to ensure inmate workers do not supplant non-inmate workers in\r\n  the labor force.Â  \r\n[7] We note with some consternation that despite its persistent\r\n  arguments against paying Cartrette time-and-a-half for overtime under\r\n  Cartrette's theories of entitlement, the Department admits in its petition for\r\n  rehearing that applicable federal regulations &quot;required [the\r\n  Department] to pay Cartrette time-and-a-half for his overtime labor.&quot;Â  (emphasis\r\n  supplied)Â  Furthermore, despite the fact the record in this case appears to\r\n  reflect a failure to pay overtime at the time-and-a-half rate, the Department repeatedly\r\n  asserts for the first time in its petition for rehearing that it did pay\r\n  Cartrette time-and-a-half overtime pay for his work on Kwalu projects &quot;on\r\n  numerous and diverse occasions.&quot;Â  We are troubled that these assertions,\r\n  which might have led to a speedy disposition of this issue before the ALC, escaped\r\n  counsel's attention for so long.Â  \r\n[8] Although not within the applicable statutory scheme, section\r\n  8-11-55 of the South Carolina Code mentions overtime in the context of state\r\n  employees.Â  That statute only applies to state employees and provides that\r\n  &quot;[a]ny state employee who is required to work overtime during any\r\n  particular week may, as a result, be given compensatory time . . . .&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 8-11-55 (Supp. 2009).Â  The statute further provides that any\r\n  compensatory time granted must be in accordance with the FLSA.Â  As indicated,\r\n  the FLSA does not apply to inmates and the prevailing wage statute at issue\r\n  specifically states that inmates participating in the prison industries program\r\n  are not considered employees of the state.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-3-430(F) (2007).\r\n[9] An inmate's participation in the prison industries program\r\n  is voluntary and contingent upon consent to the conditions of the employment.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(C) (2007) (â€œAn inmate may participate in the\r\n  program established pursuant to this section only on a voluntary basis and only\r\n  after he has been informed of the conditions of his employment.â€) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4671","title":"South Carolina Department of Corrections v.

We deny the petitions\r\n  for rehearing, withdraw our original opinion, and substitute this opinion.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nTomlin\r\n  was an inmate of the Ridgeland Correctional Institution.Â  As a participant in\r\n  PIP, Tomlin provided on-site labor at the Ridgeland Correctional Institution,\r\n  sometimes working in excess of eighty hours per two-week period, for PIP\r\n  sponsor Kwalu Furniture.Â  Tomlin was compensated at a rate of $5.25 per hour.Â \r\n  Tomlin filed a grievance with the Department complaining his hourly wage was\r\n  insufficient compared to the prevailing wage for similar work performed in the\r\n  private sector.Â  He asserted non-inmate employees earned $11.00 to $14.00 per\r\n  hour for the same work.Â  Tomlin further complained he did not receive\r\n  additional pay for overtime hours and the Department improperly withheld funds\r\n  from his paychecks.Â  Specifically, Tomlin challenged as unconstitutional the\r\n  withholding of funds for his room and board and additional funds for Victim's\r\n  Assistance.[3]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department denied Tomlin's grievance, and Tomlin appealed to the ALC.Â  The ALC\r\n  reversed the Department's refusal to pay Tomlin the prevailing wage and found\r\n  the prevailing wage was $5.25.[4]Â \r\n  Furthermore, the ALC affirmed the Department's denials of overtime and\r\n  reimbursement for wage deductions.Â Â Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  Tomlin and the Department then appealed to the circuit court.Â  After a hearing,\r\n  the circuit court found $5.25 was not the prevailing wage and remanded that\r\n  issue to the ALC with seven questions for the ALC to consider in determining\r\n  the correct prevailing wage.Â  The circuit court reversed the ALC's apparent\r\n  finding that Tomlin &quot;worked for . . . or was otherwise ever an employee of\r\n  Kwalu.&quot;Â  Finally, the circuit court affirmed the ALC's determinations\r\n  Tomlin was ineligible for overtime or reimbursement of wage deductions for room\r\n  and board and for Victims Assistance.Â  Tomlin now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  ALC has subject matter jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n  (APA) to hear properly perfected appeals from the Department's final orders in\r\n  administrative or non-collateral matters.Â  Slezak v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n  361 S.C. 327, 331, 605 S.E.2d 506, 507 (2004).Â  Our standard of review derives\r\n  from the APA.Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 379, 527 S.E.2d 742,\r\n  755 (2000).Â  We may affirm, remand, reverse, or modify the appealed decision if\r\n  the appellant's substantive rights have suffered prejudice because the decision\r\n  is:Â Â  \r\n\r\n\t(a)Â Â  in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n  provisions; \r\n\t(b)Â  in excess of the statutory authority of the\r\n  agency; \r\n\t(c)Â Â  made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d)Â  affected by other error of law; \r\n\t(e)Â Â  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n\t(f)Â Â  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by\r\n  abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Overtime Pay\r\nTomlin\r\n  contends he is entitled to time-and-a-half pay for overtime worked.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, a non-inmate employee's right of action for overtime pay lies\r\n  in Â§&nbsp;207(a)(1) of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 201-219 (1998 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  Under the FLSA, non-inmate\r\n  workers receive compensation at a rate of one and one-half times their hourly\r\n  rate for hours worked in excess of forty per week.Â  29 U.S.C.A. Â§&nbsp;207(a)(2)\r\n  (1998).Â  This court recently examined the legislative intent underlying the\r\n  FLSA and found:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  purpose of the FLSA is to protect &quot;the rights of those who toil, of those\r\n  who sacrifice a full measure of their freedom and talents to the use and profit\r\n  of others.&quot;Â  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No.\r\n    123, 321 U.S. 590, 597, 64 S.Ct. 698, 88 L.Ed. 949 (1944).Â  The FLSA was\r\n  enacted in response to a congressional finding that some industries, engaged in\r\n  commerce, maintained labor conditions which were detrimental to a minimum\r\n  standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and the general well-being\r\n  of workers.Â  See 29 U.S.C. Â§ 202(a) (1998).Â  The Act attempts to\r\n  eliminate unfair labor practices without substantially curtailing employment or\r\n  earning power.Â  29 U.S.C. Â§ 202(b). Because the FLSA is remedial and\r\n  humanitarian in purpose, it should be broadly interpreted and applied to\r\n  effectuate its goals.Â  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co., 321 U.S. at\r\n  597, 64 S.Ct. 698; Benshoff v. City of Virginia Beach, 180 F.3d 136 (4th\r\n  Cir. 1999).\r\n\r\nMiller v. Blumenthal\r\n  Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 221, 616\r\n  S.E.2d 722, 730 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court has held the FLSA does not extend to inmate workers because, for\r\n  purposes of payment of wages, inmate workers are not employees of PIP\r\n  sponsors.Â  Williams v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 372 S.C. 255, 260, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 885, 888 (2007).Â  Other courts, including the Federal Court of Appeals\r\n  for the Fourth Circuit, have also declined to extend the protections of the\r\n  FLSA and state labor statutes to inmates.Â  See, e.g., Harker v. State\r\n    Use Indus., 990 F.2d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 1993). \r\nNonetheless,\r\n  South Carolina law requires that inmate workers in a PIP enjoy pay and working\r\n  conditions comparable to those enjoyed by non-inmate workers.Â  According to our\r\n  supreme court, the overall purpose of these statutes &quot;is to prevent unfair\r\n  competition.&quot;Â  Adkins v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 360 S.C. 413, 418,\r\n  602 S.E.2d 51, 54 (2004).Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe [Department]\r\n  must determine prior to using inmate labor in a [PIP] that it will not displace\r\n  employed workers, that the locality does not have a surplus of available labor\r\n  for the skills, crafts, or trades that would utilize inmate labor, and that the\r\n  rates of pay and other conditions of employment are not less than those paid\r\n  and provided for work of [a] similar nature in the locality in which the work\r\n  is performed.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-315 (2007).Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-315 (2007).Â  &quot;No inmate participating in [PIP] may\r\n  earn less than the prevailing wage for work of [a] similar nature in the\r\n  private sector.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D) (2007).Â  While the prevailing\r\n  wage statutes do not entitle inmates to a private right of action in tort,\r\n  inmates may protest through the grievance process the Department's failure to\r\n  comply with these statutes.Â  Adkins, 360 S.C. at 419, 602 S.E.2d at 55.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  expand upon the analysis of this issue in our original opinion, as that\r\n  analysis appears to have been incomplete.Â  Tomlin properly brought this matter\r\n  as a grievance and alleged the Department denied him time-and-a-half overtime\r\n  wages for the hours he worked beyond forty each week.Â  As observed above, both\r\n  federal and South Carolina courts have held inmate workers do not qualify as\r\n  &quot;employees&quot; and are therefore excluded from the coverage of the FLSA.[5]Â  See Williams, 372 S.C. at 260, 641 S.E.2d at 888; Harker,\r\n  990 F.2d at 135.Â  However, our General Assembly has required the Department to\r\n  ensure inmate workers receive &quot;rates of pay and other conditions of employment&quot;\r\n  comparable to those afforded non-inmate workers performing similar labor in the\r\n  same locality.Â  See Â§ 24-3-315.Â  Consequently, we hold that although the\r\n  FLSA does not apply to inmate workers, sections 24-3-315 and 24-3-430(D) compel\r\n  the Department to ensure inmate workers who are employed under those sections\r\n  receive the same pay rates and employment conditions as their non-inmate peers.[6]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  statutory mandate of comparable pay rates and employment conditions does not\r\n  expressly exclude time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours worked.Â  Instead,\r\n  sections 24-3-315 and 24-3-430(E) require that inmate workers receive\r\n  comparable compensation and prohibit inmate workers from displacing\r\n  non-inmate workers.Â  These provisions appear to support Tomlin's argument for\r\n  overtime pay.Â  Failure of the Department's contracts with PIP sponsors to\r\n  provide inmate workers with time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours when their\r\n  non-inmate counterparts receive it would create an impermissible and unfair\r\n  advantage for inmate labor over private labor.Â  Moreover, any failure on the\r\n  Department's behalf to pay inmates time-and-a-half overtime pay when non-inmate\r\n  workers receive it for comparable work in the same area contradicts the\r\n  Department's obligation under section 24-3-315.[7]Â \r\n  Consequently, the circuit court erred in denying Tomlin time-and-a-half pay for\r\n  overtime work without first determining whether non-inmate workers performing\r\n  the same work in the same locality receive time-and-a-half pay for overtime.[8]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, we observe section 24-3-430(D) requires inmates receive the\r\n  &quot;prevailing wage&quot; paid to their non-inmate peers for comparable\r\n  work.Â  However, the question of the prevailing wage to which Tomlin is entitled\r\n  has been remanded to the ALC for further proceedings.Â  We nonetheless have\r\n  jurisdiction to consider whether the prevailing wage language of section\r\n  24-3-430(D) entitles Tomlin to overtime pay because the issue remanded\r\n  concerned the proper hourly rate, only.Â  However, because we have found section\r\n  24-3-315 resolves Tomlin's dispute, we need not address this argument.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding appellate court need not discuss remaining\r\n  issues when decision on prior issue disposes of appeal).\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court's decision concerning\r\n  overtime pay and remand this issue to the ALC for a determination of whether\r\n  the Department failed to pay Tomlin at the time-and-a-half rate for the hours\r\n  he worked in excess of forty per week.Â  In the event of such a failure, we\r\n  instruct the ALC to determine the rate of compensation to which Tomlin was\r\n  entitled, the number of overtime hours that were underpaid, and the amount the\r\n  Department owes Tomlin for his labor.Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Remaining Issues\r\nWith\r\n  regard to Tomlin's remaining issues, we affirm based upon the following\r\n  authorities:Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As\r\n  to the circuit court's remand to the ALC for determination of the prevailing\r\n  wage:Â  Condor, Inc. v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, City of N. Charleston, 328\r\n  S.C. 173, 178, 493 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1997) (preventing an appellant from arguing\r\n  on appeal an issue conceded in the trial court); Bowman v. Bowman, 357\r\n  S.C. 146, 160, 591 S.E.2d 654, 661 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding a party cannot seek\r\n  and receive a particular result at trial and then challenge it on appeal).Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether Tomlin was an employee of the private sponsor:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-3-40(A) (2007) (&quot;Unless otherwise provided by law, the employer of a\r\n  prisoner authorized to work . . . in a prison industry program provided under\r\n  Article 3 of this chapter shall pay the prisoner's wages directly to the\r\n  Department of Corrections.&quot;); Williams v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 372\r\n  S.C. 255, 258-59, 641 S.E.2d 885, 887 (2007) (holding a prison industries\r\n  program sponsor is not an employer of inmates because the sponsor does not\r\n  exclusively control the payment of inmate wages and finding agreement among\r\n  other jurisdictions that examined this issue).Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether Tomlin is entitled to reimbursement of monies deducted from his pay\r\n  for room and board because he was double-billed for this cost:Â  Rule 210(h),\r\n  SCACR (limiting appellate review to facts appearing in the record on appeal); State\r\n    v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 199, 498 S.E.2d 642, 647 (1998) (placing on\r\n  appellant the burden of presenting a sufficient record to allow appellate\r\n  review).Â  \r\n4.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether Tomlin is entitled to reimbursement of monies deducted from his pay\r\n  for room and board because the deduction was unconstitutional:Â  S.C. Const.\r\n  art. XII, Â§ 2 (&quot;The General Assembly shall establish institutions for the\r\n  confinement of all persons convicted of such crimes as may be designated by\r\n  law, and shall provide for the custody, maintenance, health, welfare,\r\n  education, and rehabilitation of the inmates.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40\r\n  (2007) (allocating portions of inmates' wages for restitution, the State Office\r\n  of Victim Assistance, child support, room and board, and inmate use); Brown\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d\r\n  410, 414 (2002) (&quot;An appellate court cannot construe a statute without\r\n  regard to its plain meaning and may not resort to a forced interpretation in an\r\n  attempt to expand or limit the scope of a statute.&quot;).Â  \r\n5.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether Tomlin is entitled to reimbursement of monies deducted from his pay\r\n  for victim's assistance because inmate wages are outside the funds available\r\n  for appropriations by the General Assembly:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (2007)\r\n  (allocating portions of inmates' wages for restitution, the State Office of\r\n  Victim Assistance, child support, room and board, and inmate use); S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-1260 (2003) (requiring persons convicted of criminal acts to\r\n  reimburse the State and directing such payments to be made from inmate wages to\r\n  the State Office of Victim Assistance); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1290 (2003)\r\n  (establishing Victim's Compensation Fund from which State Office of Victim\r\n  Assistance may pay victims' claims).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find sections 24-3-315 and 24-3-430(D) entitle inmate workers in a PIP to pay\r\n  and working conditions comparable to those enjoyed by workers in private\r\n  industry, including time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours worked.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's decision on this issue and remand\r\n  to the ALC for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  For the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court's decision on the remaining\r\n  issues.Â  \r\n&nbsp;AFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part:\r\nI\r\n  concur in the majority's conclusion to affirm the decision to remand to\r\n  determine a prevailing wage.Â  I also concur in the determination that the\r\n  inmate is not an employee of the private sponsor or entitled to reimbursement\r\n  for room and board and other costs.Â  However, I respectfully dissent as to any\r\n  finding that the inmate is entitled to overtime pay.Â  Section 24-3-430 establishes\r\n  an inmate's right to the prevailing wage, stating &quot;[n]o inmate\r\n  participating in the program may earn less than the prevailing wage for work of\r\n  similar nature in the private sector.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D)\r\n  (2007).Â  Our supreme court recognizes that a critical purpose of the prevailing\r\n  wage provision is to prevent unfair competition.Â  Adkins v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n  360 S.C. 413, 418, 602 S.E.2d 51, 54 (2004).Â  Nonetheless, I would distinguish\r\n  between prevailing wages and any right to overtime pay for inmates\r\n  participating in a prison industries program.Â  In fact, there is no authority\r\n  within the applicable state statutory scheme recognizing any right to overtime\r\n  pay for inmates.[9]Â  See Â§ 24-3-430(D) (2007) (stating only that no inmate participating in\r\n  the program may earn less than the prevailing wage). Moreover, the inmate never\r\n  specifically raised the issue of whether a particular federal program provides\r\n  for the right to overtime pay.Â Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) provides a right to overtime pay for\r\n  certain employees, the protections of the act do not apply to inmates working\r\n  within the prison setting.Â  See Harker v. State Use Indus., 990\r\n  F.2d 131, 136 (4th Cir. 1993) (&quot;For more than fifty years, Congress has\r\n  operated on the assumption that the FLSA does not apply to inmate labor. If the\r\n  FLSA's coverage is to extend within prison walls, Congress must say so, not the\r\n  courts.&quot;).Â  As noted by the Fourth Circuit in Harker, inmates\r\n  participating in these types of programs perform work not to &quot;turn profits\r\n  for their supposed employer, but rather as a means of rehabilitation and job training.&quot;Â  Id. at 133.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  sum, I am not convinced the current statutory scheme provides for overtime pay\r\n  to inmates.Â  Inmates are not employees entitled to the protections of the FLSA,\r\n  and I do not find it appropriate to read into the prevailing wage statute any\r\n  such right to inmates voluntarily participating in a prison industries program.[10]Â \r\n  As Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit has explained: \r\n\r\n\tPeople\r\n  are not imprisoned for the purpose of enabling them to earn a living. Â The\r\n  prison pays for their keep.Â  If it puts them to work, it is to offset some of\r\n  the cost of keeping them, or to keep them out of mischief, or to ease their\r\n  transition to the world outside, or to equip them with skills and habits that\r\n  will make them less likely to return to crime outside.Â  None of these goals is\r\n  compatible with federal regulation of their wages and hours.Â  The reason the\r\n  FLSA contains no express exception for prisoners is probably that the idea was\r\n  too outlandish to occur to anyone when the legislation was under consideration\r\n  by Congress. \r\n\r\nBennett v. Frank, 395 F.3d 409, 410 (7th Cir. 2005).Â  Accordingly, I\r\n  concur in the decision of the majority to affirm the circuit court and remand\r\n  to the ALC to determine a prevailing wage; however, I respectfully dissent as\r\n  to the overtime issue, and I would affirm the finding of the ALC and the\r\n  circuit court that the inmate is not entitled to overtime pay. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This appeal is being considered alongside S.C. Dep't\r\n  of Corr. v. Billy Joe Cartrette.Â  The material facts, substantive\r\n  arguments, and procedural postures of these two appeals are identical.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1290 (2003) (establishing\r\n  Victim's Compensation Fund from which State Office of Victim Assistance may pay\r\n  victims' claims); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1260 (2003) (requiring persons\r\n  convicted of criminal acts to reimburse the State and directing such payments\r\n  to be made from inmate wages to the State Office of Victim Assistance).Â  \r\n[4] The ALC's order seems to presume Tomlin complained of\r\n  receiving a &quot;training wage&quot; of less than $5.25 per hour.Â  However,\r\n  Tomlin appears to have complained only that $5.25 per hour was below the\r\n  prevailing wage.Â  \r\n[5] We specifically reject Tomlin's contention that Hamilton\r\n  v. Daniel Int'l Corp., 273 S.C. 409, 257 S.E.2d 157 (1979), established his\r\n  right to time-and-a-half pay for overtime work.Â  Although the Hamilton court cited to statutory language similar to that found in section 24-3-315, it\r\n  did not contemplate overtime work.Â  Id. at 410, 257 S.E.2d at 158.Â  The\r\n  issue in that case concerned the right of an inmate participating in a\r\n  work-release program to benefits under the Worker's Compensation Act.Â  Id. at 410-11, 257 S.E.2d at 158.Â  \r\n[6] While the Department argues our opinion impacts three\r\n  of its PIPs, this opinion is limited solely to the program in which Tomlin was\r\n  involved and that was promulgated and operated pursuant to sections 24-3-315\r\n  and 24-3-430.Â  \r\n[7] In its petition for rehearing, the Department declares\r\n  the majority's analysis of section 24-3-430's provision of a prevailing wage\r\n  for inmate labor &quot;obviously overlooked the explicit intent of our General\r\n  Assembly&quot; regarding inmate labor.Â  The Department cites section 24-3-310\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2007), which indicates the purposes of inmate labor\r\n  include self-maintenance, reimbursement of the State, restitution, and child\r\n  support.Â  In our opinion, these purposes harmonize with the General Assembly's\r\n  mandate that inmate labor not unfairly compete with non-inmate labor.Â  See Â§Â§ 24-3-315 &amp; -430(E); see also Adkins, 360 S.C. at 418, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 54 (finding the overall purpose of these statutes &quot;is to prevent\r\n  unfair competition&quot;).Â  By statute, seventy percent or more of each inmate\r\n  worker's pay is diverted for restitution, victim's programs, child support,\r\n  room and board, or taxes.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (2007).Â  Increased pay,\r\n  including overtime pay, for inmate workers ultimately benefits the Department\r\n  by increasing the funds available to relieve the burden of inmate housing and\r\n  care; benefits crime victims, both directly through fulfillment of inmates'\r\n  restitution obligations and indirectly by funding state agencies that provide\r\n  victim assistance; and benefits inmates' minor children by increasing the\r\n  amount available for child support.Â  We believe that in crafting these\r\n  statutes, our General Assembly carefully balanced its desire to maximize\r\n  inmates' financial contributions against the need to ensure inmate workers do\r\n  not supplant non-inmate workers in the labor force.Â  \r\n[8] We note with some consternation that despite its\r\n  persistent arguments against paying Tomlin time-and-a-half for overtime under\r\n  Tomlin's theories of entitlement, the Department admits in its petition for\r\n  rehearing that applicable federal regulations &quot;required [the\r\n  Department] to pay Tomlin time-and-a-half for his overtime labor.&quot;Â \r\n  (emphasis supplied)Â  Furthermore, despite the fact the record in this case appears\r\n  to reflect a failure to pay overtime at the time-and-a-half rate, the\r\n  Department repeatedly asserts for the first time in its petition for rehearing\r\n  that it did pay Tomlin time-and-a-half overtime pay for his work on Kwalu\r\n  projects &quot;on numerous and diverse occasions.&quot;Â  We are troubled that\r\n  these assertions, which might have led to a speedy disposition of this issue\r\n  before the ALC, escaped counsel's attention for so long.Â  \r\n[9] Although not within the applicable statutory scheme, section\r\n  8-11-55 of the South Carolina Code mentions overtime in the context of state\r\n  employees.Â  That statute only applies to state employees and provides that\r\n  &quot;[a]ny state employee who is required to work overtime during any\r\n  particular week may, as a result, be given compensatory time . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-11-55 (Supp. 2009).Â  The statute further provides that any\r\n  compensatory time granted must be in accordance with the FLSA.Â  As indicated,\r\n  the FLSA does not apply to inmates and the prevailing wage statute at issue specifically\r\n  states that inmates participating in the prison industries program are not\r\n  considered employees of the state.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(F)\r\n  (2007).\r\n[10] An inmate's participation in the prison industries program\r\n  is voluntary and contingent upon consent to the conditions of the employment.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(C) (2007) (â€œAn inmate may participate in the\r\n  program established pursuant to this section only on a voluntary basis and only\r\n  after he has been informed of the conditions of his employment.â€) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4672","title":"State v.

when Porter was\r\n  representing himself pro se; and (4) refusing to issue the kidnapping charge\r\nrequested by the defense.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  December 22, 2006, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Porter, along with Kenneth\r\n  Young (Young) and Donshavis Jones (Jones), entered the front door of the Lake\r\n  Wylie Branch of the Bank of York (the Bank).Â  All three men wore dark ski\r\n  masks, dark clothing, and gloves.Â  All three were armed with handguns and at\r\n  least one had a canister of pepper spray.Â  Porter and Young approached the\r\n  teller line and the customer service desk, pointed their guns at the employees,\r\n  and ordered them to lie down.Â  Porter and Young then ordered some of the\r\n  employees and customers to crawl into the main vault and told some of the\r\n  tellers to open their individual vaults.[1]Â \r\n  At the same time, Jones carried a pillowcase into the main vault and began\r\n  filling it with money.Â  After Jones retrieved roughly $18,000, the three men\r\n  left, leaving all of the employees and customers locked in the main vault.Â  The\r\n  three men got into a rented Ford Taurus (the Taurus) driven by Angela Laws\r\n  (Laws).[2]Â \r\n  The Taurus exited the Bank's parking lot and drove east on Highway 49 towards\r\n  Charlotte.Â  \r\nFortunately,\r\n  it was the Bank's policy to leave a key in the main vault at all times for such\r\n  an event, so the employees and customers were able to get out of the main vault\r\n  soon after the robbers left.Â  The vice president of the Bank, Mike Lubiato\r\n  (Lubiato), immediately called 9-1-1.Â  While he was on the phone with the 9-1-1\r\n  dispatcher, Lubiato spoke to a customer who had been waiting outside at the\r\n  drive through window.Â  The customer stated the getaway car was a gray or bluish\r\n  gray Ford Taurus with a dealer tag.Â  Lubiato relayed this information to the\r\n  dispatcher.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Terry Vinesett (Officer Vinesett) of the York County Sheriff's Department was\r\n  on duty in his patrol car on the morning of December 22, 2006, when he received\r\n  a call about an armed robbery at the Bank.Â  The dispatcher stated the robbery\r\n  involved four to five people, and the robbers fled the Bank in a blue or gray\r\n  Ford Taurus.Â  Constable Wes Scott (Constable Scott) was riding along with\r\n  Officer Vinesett that day.Â  Driving directly behind Officer Vinesett was\r\n  Officer Randy Gibson (Officer Gibson).Â  While the officers were about to make a\r\n  left turn onto Highway 49 from Carowinds Boulevard, Officer Gibson saw the\r\n  Taurus turning south on Carowinds Boulevard towards York County.Â  When Officer\r\n  Gibson alerted Officer Vinesett over his radio that he had seen the Taurus, he\r\n  and Officer Vinesett immediately made a U-turn and followed the Taurus.Â  As\r\n  soon as the Taurus crossed over the York County line, Officer Vinesett and\r\n  Officer Gibson turned on their lights and sirens.[3]Â \r\n  Upon seeing the officers' lights, Laws began to speed up and turned onto\r\n  Interstate 77 northbound towards Charlotte.Â  Laws traveled several miles on the\r\n  interstate before exiting at Arrowood Road in Charlotte.Â  \r\nEventually,\r\n  Laws turned into the parking lot of an apartment complex and came to a stop.Â \r\n  Jones, who was seated in the back seat on the driver's side of the Taurus,\r\n  attempted to flee.Â  Before he could exit the Taurus, however, Officer Vinesett\r\n  drove his patrol car into the left side of the Taurus, injuring Jones's left\r\n  leg.Â  Officer Gibson arrived in the parking lot just as the collision\r\n  occurred.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Vinesett, Constable Scott, and Officer Gibson exited their respective patrol\r\n  cars and ordered all four suspects out of the Taurus.Â  The officers placed the\r\n  suspects in handcuffs and searched them for weapons.Â  They did not read the\r\n  suspects their Miranda rights.Â  A short time later, officers from the\r\n  Charlotte Police Department arrived and took custody of the four suspects.Â \r\n  Both Officer Vinesett and Officer Gibson testified they did not take any of the\r\n  suspects before a magistrate that day.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  the back of the Taurus, Officer Vinesett found a dealer tag duct-taped over a\r\n  South Carolina license plate.Â  In the backseat floorboard of the Taurus,\r\n  Officer Vinesett found bullets, a blue ski mask, rubber gloves, a revolver, and\r\n  a pillowcase containing a nine millimeter pistol, several rounds of ammunition,\r\n  and roughly $18,000.Â  In the passenger seat, Officer Vinesett found a pack of\r\n  cigarettes and a wig.Â  On the ground outside the Taurus, Officer Vinesett found\r\n  another blue ski mask, a pair of black gloves, a blue shirt, a pair of black\r\n  boots with one containing a pocket knife, a black jacket, a pair of black\r\n  tennis shoes, and a pillowcase containing a pair of white tennis shoes, a white\r\n  dew rag, a can of pepper spray, and a black t-shirt.[4]Â  \r\nOn December 27,\r\n  2006, officials from the York County Sheriff's Office obtained warrants for the\r\n  four suspects and faxed them to the Charlotte Mecklenberg Police Department.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  York County officials commenced the extradition process in January 2007.Â  In\r\n  June 2007, Porter was indicted for kidnapping, entering a bank with intent to\r\n  steal, armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\n  crime, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.Â  Laws and Jones pled\r\n  guilty to armed robbery.Â  Young and Porter were tried before the\r\n  Honorable John C. Hayes, III in July 2007.Â  Porter proceeded pro se but was\r\n  appointed standby counsel.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State presented testimony from the employees and customers in the\r\n  Bank.Â  None of the employees or customers could identify any of the robbers\r\n  because they were all wearing ski masks and gloves during the robbery.Â \r\n  However, Lubiato testified that each teller at the Bank is instructed to keep a\r\n  record of the serial numbers of five $100 bills in their vault at all times.Â \r\n  This is commonly referred to as &quot;bait money.&quot;Â  In the event the Bank\r\n  is robbed, the money stolen can be identified because it will contain the bait\r\n  money.Â  Lubiato testified that the $18,000 stolen from the Bank on the morning\r\n  in question contained bait money.Â  He further testified the money the police\r\n  found in the Taurus and returned to the Bank contained all of the bait money from\r\n  one of the teller's vaults at the Bank.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State also presented video footage from security cameras mounted inside and\r\n  outside the Bank and also from the dashboard cameras mounted inside Officer\r\n  Vinesett's and Officer Gibson's vehicles.Â  The footage from the Bank showed\r\n  three men in dark clothing and ski masks enter the Bank, order the employees\r\n  and customers at gun point into the main vault, and then leave in a gray Ford\r\n  Taurus.Â  The footage from the dashboard cameras showed the chase from Highway 49\r\n  into the apartment complex in Charlotte.\r\nFinally, the State\r\n  presented testimony from Laws and Jones, both of whom had already pled guilty\r\n  to armed robbery.Â  Both testified that on the morning of December 22, 2006,\r\n  they, along with Porter and Young, drove a rented gray Ford Taurus to the\r\n  Bank.Â  They further testified Jones, Young, and Porter entered the Bank\r\n  carrying guns and wearing dark clothing and ski masks.Â  Jones specifically\r\n  testified Porter had called him earlier that week to ask him to be the &quot;money\r\n  man&quot; in a bank robbery and to bring a pillowcase to hold the money.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Porter guilty on all counts.Â  The trial court sentenced Porter to\r\n  life in prison without the possibility of parole for armed robbery, kidnapping,\r\n  and entering a bank with intent to steal, and five years for both the\r\n  conspiracy and possession of a firearm.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d 61, 65 (1973).Â  Appellate courts\r\n  are bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111\r\n  (2000).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\na. Motion To Quash The Indictments\r\n  or Dismiss The Case\r\nPorter\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to quash the indictments or dismiss\r\n  this case because the South Carolina officers who arrested him in North\r\n  Carolina failed to comply with the North Carolina law that would have permitted\r\n  his arrest.Â  However, we do not believe this issue is preserved for our review.\r\nAn\r\n  issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument\r\n  is raised in a brief but not supported by authority. Â Glasscock, Inc. v.\r\n    U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  In his brief, Porter argues:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    trial judge erred in refusing to quash the indictments or to dismiss the case\r\n    against appellant where appellant was arrested by South Carolina officers in\r\n    North Carolina and where the officers failed to comply with the North Carolina\r\n    statute which would have permitted such an arrest.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  that section of Porter's brief, however, he does not cite to any authority that\r\n  supports this specific argument.Â  The only citations in that section of his\r\n  argument are to the North Carolina statute and to two cases that define an\r\n  arrest.Â  The statute itself does not state the consequences of violating the\r\n  statute, either in North Carolina or anywhere else.Â  Thus, the mere fact that\r\n  Porter cited to the statute does not provide this court with any guidance as to\r\n  why the South Carolina officer's failure to present him to a magistrate should\r\n  result in the remedy he seeks, i.e., the quashing of the indictments or the dismissal\r\n  of the case against him.Â  While the argument contains citations to\r\n  authority, those authorities do not support his specific argument\r\n  whatsoever.Â  Consequently, we hold this issue unpreserved for failure to cite\r\n  any supporting authority.Â  See State v. Howard, 384 S.C.\r\n  212, 218, 682 S.E.2d 42, 45 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding argument abandoned when\r\n  defendant failed to cite any authority in specific support of his assertion\r\n  that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial).\r\nb. Admission of Items Found\r\n  Near Car\r\nPorter\r\n  argues the trial court erred in admitting into evidence items[5] that were found in the parking lot near the Taurus because (1) there was no\r\n  testimony tying these items to the defendants, (2) the items were not found in\r\n  the possession of the defendants or in the car, and (3) the police found no\r\n  fingerprints on the items.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court, and the court's decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265\r\n  (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court\r\n  either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. Â State\r\n    v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  To warrant a\r\n  reversal based on the admission of evidence, the appellant must show both error\r\n  and resulting prejudice. Commerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers\r\n    McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find no error in the trial court's decision to admit these items.Â  First, we\r\n  believe there was sufficient evidentiary support for the trial court's finding\r\n  there was a nexus between these items, the defendants, and the robbery.Â  See State v. Adams, 377 S.C. 334, 337, 659 S.E.2d 272, 274 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (holding the decision to admit evidence will not be reversed unless the\r\n  conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\n  controlled by an error of law).Â  As to the ski mask, gloves, blue shirt, black\r\n  jacket, black boots, and black tennis shoes, the State presented testimony from\r\n  numerous Bank employees and customers that the robbers all wore ski masks,\r\n  black or dark blue clothing, and gloves.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  same is true of the pillowcase.Â  Several of the State's witnesses testified the\r\n  robber who took the money from the Bank carried it in a pillowcase.Â  Further,\r\n  Jones testified Porter instructed him to bring two pillowcases to the robbery,\r\n  and he took one of the pillowcases into the Bank on the day of the robbery.Â \r\n  The mere fact that the pillowcase and the other items found in the parking lot\r\n  were not in the defendants' exclusive possession when the police detained them\r\n  does not render them inadmissible.Â  See State v. Jackson, 265\r\n  S.C. 278, 283, 217 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1975) (holding exclusive possession of\r\n  items by accused is not required for such items to be admissible in armed\r\n  robbery prosecution; the accused need only bear a distinctive relationship to\r\n  the property).\r\nSecond,\r\n  to the extent any of these items were improperly admitted, their admission was\r\n  harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence that established Porter's\r\n  guilt.Â  See State v. Allen, 269 S.C. 233, 242, 237 S.E.2d 64, 68\r\n  (1977) (holding overwhelming proof of guilt rendered harmless the admission of\r\n  the evidence in question).Â  In this case, the money found in the Taurus\r\n  contained the bait money that was stolen from the Bank. Furthermore,\r\n  surveillance video from the Bank showed three men in dark clothing and ski\r\n  masks exit the Bank with a pillowcase filled with money and get into a grey\r\n  Ford Taurus.Â  When the defendants were arrested, they were wearing dark\r\n  clothes, and they were driving a grey Ford Taurus in which the police found a\r\n  pillowcase filled with money, ski masks, and other dark clothing.Â  Finally,\r\n  Laws and Young both testified in specific detail as to Porter's involvement in\r\n  the robbery.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find no error in the admission of these items at trial.\r\nc. Exclusion of Porter from\r\n  Bench Conference\r\nPorter\r\n  argues the trial court erred in excluding him from a bench conference during\r\n  jury selection.Â  We believe this issue is not preserved for review.\r\nThe\r\n  general rule of issue preservation is if an issue was not raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court, it will not be considered for the first time on\r\n  appeal.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94\r\n  (2003).Â  Imposing this preservation requirement is meant to enable the trial\r\n  court to rule properly after it has considered all the relevant facts, law, and\r\n  arguments.Â  I'On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716,\r\n  725 (2000).Â  A contemporaneous objection is required to preserve issues for\r\n  direct appellate review. Â State v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 595, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  283, 287 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court\r\n  will not be considered on appeal. Â Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 338, 548\r\n  S.E.2d 862, 866 (2001).\r\nDuring\r\n  jury voir dire and selection, the trial court stated, &quot;Let me ask counsel\r\n  to come up here and Mr. Porter, I'll ask Mr. Jamison to tell you what I mention\r\n  up here.&quot;[6]Â \r\n  The court then held a conference in Porter's absence.Â  However, Porter did not\r\n  make a contemporaneous objection to his exclusion.Â  Consequently, we believe\r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review.[7]\r\nd. Kidnapping Charge\r\nPorter\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury if they found\r\n  Porter guilty of armed robbery, then in order for them to also find him guilty\r\n  of kidnapping, they would have to find Porter did something more than constrain\r\n  the bank employees and customers for the purposes of robbing them.Â  In other\r\n  words, the jury could not base a conviction for kidnapping on the restraint of\r\n  the employees and customers that was incidental to the armed robbery.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  the trial judge is required to charge the current and correct law of South\r\n  Carolina.Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 106, 610 S.E.2d 859, 865 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  Pursuant to section 16-3-910 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009),\r\n  a person is guilty of kidnapping if he &quot;unlawfully seize[s], confine[s],\r\n  inveigle[s], decoy[s], kidnap[s], abduct[s] or carr[ies] away any other person\r\n  by any means whatsoever without authority of law, except when a minor is seized\r\n  or taken by his parent, . . . .&quot;Â  Kidnapping is a continuous offense that\r\n  commences when one is wrongfully deprived of freedom and continues until freedom\r\n  is restored.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 13, 512 S.E.2d 99, 105\r\n  (1999).Â  Armed robbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money,\r\n  goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in\r\n  his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear. Â State v.\r\n    Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 241 (1996).\r\nLogically,\r\n  in order to commit armed robbery, an assailant must constrain his victim's\r\n  activities in some way; otherwise, the victim could simply walk away. Â The\r\n  issue here is whether the same act of constraining the employees and customers\r\n  that was necessary to commit the armed robbery could also be the basis for a\r\n  kidnapping conviction.Â  \r\nOur supreme\r\n  court has held &quot;[w]hen a single act combines the requisite ingredients of\r\n  two distinct offenses, the defendant may be severally indicted and punished for\r\n  each.&quot;Â  State v. Steadman, 216 S.C. 579, 589, 59 S.E.2d 168, 173\r\n  (1950).Â  The question of whether an act of confinement can constitute\r\n  kidnapping when that confinement is incidental to the commission of another\r\n  crime was raised in State v. Hall, 280 S.C. 74, 310 S.E.2d 429 (1983).Â \r\n  In that case, the victim was abducted at knifepoint as she placed a call from a\r\n  phone booth.Â  Id. at 75, 310 S.E.2d at 430.Â  The perpetrator forced the\r\n  victim to walk to an adjacent pool area where he sexually assaulted her and\r\n  forced her to walk to different locations around the pool.Â  Id.Â  At each\r\n  location, the perpetrator assaulted the victim.Â  Id.Â  On appeal of his\r\n  conviction for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, first\r\n  degree criminal sexual conduct, and kidnapping, Hall argued the trial court\r\n  erred in failing to charge the jury that in order to establish kidnapping, the\r\n  State must prove the confinement of the victim was more than incident to the\r\n  commission of another crime.Â  Id. at 77, 310 S.E.2d at 431.Â  Our supreme\r\n  court disagreed, holding the restraint of the victim constituted kidnapping\r\n  &quot;regardless of the fact that the purpose of the seizure was to facilitate\r\n  the commission of a sexual battery.&quot;Â  Id. at 78, 310 S.E.2d at 431.[8]\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the State presented voluminous testimony from Bank employees and\r\n  customers that they were confined while the robbery was taking place.Â  Under Hall,\r\n  that single act of confinement could support a finding of kidnapping regardless\r\n  of whether it was merely incidental to the commission of the armed robbery.Â \r\n  Moreover, the testimony established there were people in the Bank who were\r\n  being confined against their will but were not being robbed.Â  We believe this\r\n  act of confining the customers would support the kidnapping conviction\r\n  independently of the confinement required to commit the armed robbery. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find no error in the trial court's refusal to issue the kidnapping charge\r\n  that Porter requested.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.[9]\r\nSHORT, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] According to\r\n  testimony from Bank employees, each teller had his or her own individual vault contained\r\n  within the larger, main vault.Â  \r\n[2] Young testified\r\n  that prior to the robbery, he duct-taped a dealer tag over the South Carolina\r\n  license plate of the Taurus.Â  \r\n[3] The activation\r\n  of the lights automatically activated the dashboard cameras inside the patrol\r\n  cars, which captured the ensuing chase of the Taurus until it stopped in the\r\n  parking lot of an apartment complex in North Carolina.Â  The video taken from the\r\n  cameras was admitted into evidence without objection.Â  \r\n[4] The State's\r\n  forensic technicians all testified that none of the items found in the Taurus\r\n  had any fingerprints on them.Â  \r\n[5] Porter objected to the admission of (1) a blue ski\r\n  mask, (2) a pair of black gloves, (3) a blue shirt, (4) a pair of black boots,\r\n  (5) a pocket knife that was found in the left black boot, (5) a black jacket,\r\n  (6) a pair of black tennis shoes, and (7) a pillowcase containing a pair of\r\n  white tennis shoes, a white dew rag, a can of pepper spray, and a black\r\n  t-shirt.Â  Porter objected only to the admission of the pillowcase; he did not\r\n  the object to the items contained inside the pillowcase. Â \r\n[6] Mr. Jamison was\r\n  counsel for Porter's co-defendant, Young.\r\n[7] Porter urges this court to adopt the reasoning\r\n  of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Oses v. Comm. of Mass., 961\r\n  F.2d 985 (1st Cir. 1992).Â  In that case, the court found the appellant's Sixth\r\n  Amendment right of pro se representation was violated due to his exclusion from\r\n  over seventy bench and lobby conferences.Â  Id. at 986.Â  However, Oses is distinguishable because Oses actually moved to be admitted to any bench or\r\n  lobby conferences held during the trial.Â  Id.Â  In this case, neither\r\n  Porter nor his standby counsel moved to be admitted to any bench conferences\r\n  either before or during the trial.\r\n[8] Interestingly,\r\n  the South Carolina rule appears to be the minority view among other jurisdictions\r\n  that have considered this issue.Â  See State v. Anthony, 817\r\n  S.W.2d 299, 305 (Tenn. 1991) (citing to at least fifteen states' appellate\r\n  court decisions on this issue and stating that &quot;[b]y an overwhelming\r\n  margin, the majority view in other jurisdictions is that kidnapping statutes do\r\n  not apply to unlawful confinements or movements incidental to the commission of\r\n  other crimes&quot;); see also Model Penal Code Â§ 212.1 (2001) (requiring\r\n  movement over a substantial distance or confinement for a substantial period of\r\n  time).Â  \r\n[9] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4673","title":"Bailey v.

Holmes, of Mount Pleasant,\r\n  for Respondent Jean Townsend. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  In this dispute involving a dock,\r\n  James Bailey appeals from the Administrative Law Court's (ALC) order, arguing the\r\n  ALC erred in: (1) finding the dock was a private dock; (2) failing to remand\r\n  the permit application for consideration of the use of the proposed construction\r\n  and the impact of the use on Bailey; and (3) determining Bailey lacked legal\r\n  standing to contest the permit decision.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJames\r\n  Bailey, a landowner and part-time resident of Wadmalaw Island (the Island) in\r\n  South Carolina, challenged DHEC's decision to issue a permit to Jean Townsend,\r\n  a nearby property owner, for the modification of a private recreational dock.Â \r\n  Bailey's property is downstream from Townsend's property, and it is separated\r\n  from Townsend's property by two pieces of land, each owned separately by Dana\r\n  Beach and James Wells, neither of which are a party to this case.[1]Â \r\n  Wells' property is situated next to Townsend's property.\r\nTownsend and her two sisters inherited the property and dock in\r\n  1996.[2]Â \r\n  The dock was permitted by the War Department in 1948, and used as a commercial\r\n  dock until 1995.Â  Townsend's father ran a commercial shrimping operation from\r\n  the dock for years until he became ill, and then he leased the dock to another\r\n  commercial shrimping company.Â  The dock was larger than most other docks in the\r\n  area, and although the Island had been rezoned in the 1980s, the dock was\r\n  grandfathered and allowed to exist in the form it was in during 1977.\r\nIn 2005, several portions of the dock's walkway collapsed, and\r\n  DHEC granted two permits for repairs to the dock.Â  Bailey objected to the\r\n  repairs to the dock, and in response to Bailey's complaints, DHEC brought a\r\n  revocation action in 2007, to remove a 64-foot portion of the dock that had\r\n  already been approved and rebuilt.[3]Â \r\n  The action was heard in 2008, by Administrative Law Judge Ralph King Anderson,\r\n  III.Â  Judge Anderson denied the revocation, which is not at issue in this case.\r\nAt issue in this case is a permit granted by DHEC on September 6,\r\n  2007, for modifications to Townsend's dock.[4]Â  Although the construction involved\r\n  adding a floating dock, it did not enlarge or alter the dock's original\r\n  footprint because other parts of the dock were being removed.Â  On September 19,\r\n  2007, Bailey mailed DHEC a request for final review of the decision, claiming\r\n  the dock was being used commercially.[5]Â \r\n  Specifically, Bailey argued the modification was not for Townsend's personal\r\n  use but was to accommodate a fishing boat owned by John Bittner and a sailboat\r\n  owned by Robert Johnson.Â  Townsend claimed Bittner and Johnson were friends\r\n  that she allowed to use her dock as a favor; however, Bailey asserted Bittner\r\n  and Johnson's use of the dock was part of a commercial arrangement, indicating\r\n  the beginning of a marina.Â  Bittner's boat was a charter boat at one time, but\r\n  it had not been since 1996 or 1997.Â  Also, the boat did not have a captain, DNR\r\n  charter license, business license, or tuna license, and it did not dock at a\r\n  commercial facility as would be required if it were run as a charter.Â  At times,\r\n  both Bittner and Johnson had given money to Townsend to help pay for repairs to\r\n  the dock or dock expenses, such as electricity and insurance; however, Townsend\r\n  did not have a written agreement with them, and she did not rent slips or allow\r\n  the general public access to the dock.Â  As a result of Bailey's complaints, in\r\n  2008, Townsend requested that Bittner and Johnson stop giving her money for\r\n  dock-related costs.\r\nOn November 16, 2007, Bailey filed a notice of request and request\r\n  for a contested case hearing with the ALC.Â  In his request, Bailey stated the\r\n  grounds for review involved the permit's improper characterization of the\r\n  construction as being for private recreational use when the dock was originally\r\n  permitted as a commercial dock.Â  Bailey asserted if Townsend wanted to use the\r\n  dock for private use, she had to request a change of use from commercial to\r\n  private, and if the change was permitted, the dock would have to be modified to\r\n  conform with the regulations pertaining to private docks.Â  A hearing was held\r\n  on June 17, 2008, before Administrative Law Judge John Geathers, and was\r\n  concluded by conference call on the record with counsel for all parties on July\r\n  3, 2008.Â  Judge Geathers issued his order on July 23, 2008, finding Bailey\r\n  lacked standing to contest the permit.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe ALC presides over all hearings of\r\n  contested DHEC permitting cases and, in such cases, serves as the fact-finder\r\n  and is not restricted by the findings of the administrative agency.Â  S.C.

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61\r\n  (1992), the United State Supreme Court enunciated a three-part standing test:\r\n\r\n\tFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an &quot;injury in\r\n  fact&quot; â€“ an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete\r\n  and particularized, and (b) &quot;actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or\r\n  'hypothetical.'&quot;Â  Second, there must be a causal connection between the\r\n  injury and the conduct complained of â€“ the injury has to be &quot;fairly . . .\r\n  trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e]\r\n  result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Third, it must be &quot;likely,&quot; as opposed to merely\r\n  &quot;speculative,&quot; that the injury will be &quot;redressed by a favorable\r\n  decision.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted); see Smiley\r\n  v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 374 S.C. 326, 329, 649 S.E.2d\r\n  31, 32-33 (2007) (quoting Lujan). \r\nBailey asserts &quot;his use and enjoyment of the creek and his\r\n  dock have been and will continue to be harmed by the existing commercial use of\r\n  Townsend's dock and the failure of [DHEC] to give proper review to that\r\n  use.&quot;Â  Bailey claims he has standing because he &quot;has a concrete and\r\n  particularized injury which is actual or imminent and not conjectural.&quot;Â \r\n  He asserts this based on the following claims: (1) he uses his dock almost\r\n  every weekend; (2) his enjoyment of the creek and his property has been\r\n  adversely affected by the continued commercial use of the dock and DHEC's failure\r\n  to properly evaluate the dock's use; (3) there is a causal connection between\r\n  the injury to his interests and the conduct complained of; and (4) his injury\r\n  can be redressed by a remand to DHEC to require review of the actual use of the\r\n  dock, which would provide a forum for Bailey to have his concerns evaluated and\r\n  may lead to either a denial of the permit or an official recognition of the\r\n  actual use of Townsend's dock.\r\nJudge Geathers found Bailey lacked standing to challenge the dock\r\n  permit because he failed to meet all three of the elements of the standing\r\n  test.Â  First, Judge Geathers found Bailey did not show an injury in fact from\r\n  the permitted conversion of the fixed dock into a floating dock, and Bailey\r\n  presented no evidence to support his contention that the dock was being used\r\n  for commercial purposes.Â  Further, he found that Bailey's concern that the dock\r\n  would become a marina was conjectural and speculative.Â  Second, Judge Geathers\r\n  found no causal connection between Bailey's alleged injury and the permitted\r\n  conversion of the fixed dock into a floating dock because the boats had been\r\n  docked there for years, and they would continue to be docked there regardless\r\n  of the permitting decision.Â  Third, Judge Geathers found it was not likely that\r\n  Bailey's alleged injury would be redressed by a favorable decision because the\r\n  boats would remain at Townsend's dock regardless of whether the dock was a\r\n  fixed or floating dock.\r\nWe find the evidence supports Judge Geathers' finding that Bailey\r\n  lacks standing to contest the permit.Â  Bailey admitted the dock interfered with\r\n  the quiet enjoyment of his property whether it was fixed or floating.Â  He also\r\n  admitted he would not have a problem with the floating dock if there were no\r\n  boats at the dock.Â  Further, he admitted he did not have a problem with the\r\n  Johnsons' sailboat being at the dock.Â  He stated his concern was with Bittner's\r\n  motor boat because it was large, and he worried about the boat breaking away\r\n  from Townsend's dock and destroying his dock or hurting his children while they\r\n  were in the water.Â  Curtis Joyner, manager of wetland permitting and\r\n  certification at DHEC, testified that regardless of the changes, the potential\r\n  of having boats mooring at the dock would still exist.Â  He also testified that\r\n  the permitted dock changes that involved removing a portion of the dock and\r\n  adding a floating dock would not have any impact on the current navigation of\r\n  the waterway because the dock would be the same length.\r\nBailey testified that his objection was over the dock being used\r\n  in a commercial manner as a marina, and he asserted the Townsends did not need\r\n  a forty-foot floating dock for their personal use.Â  However, Bailey failed to\r\n  present any evidence showing that Townsend's dock was being used for commercial\r\n  purposes.Â  Townsend asserted Bittner and Johnson were friends that she allowed\r\n  to use the dock as a favor, not as a commercial arrangement.Â  Townsend did not\r\n  have a written agreement with Bittner or Johnson to pay her for using the dock,\r\n  and she did not rent slips or allow the general public access to the dock.Â \r\n  Further, due to Bailey's claims, Townsend requested that Bittner and Johnson\r\n  stop giving her money for dock-related costs.\r\nTherefore, we find no error in Judge Geathers' determination that\r\n  Bailey lacked standing to challenge the dock permit because he failed to meet\r\n  all three of the elements of the standing test.Â  Because we affirm the ALC's\r\n  order finding Bailey lacks standing to contest the permit decision, we need not\r\n  address Bailey's remaining arguments.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\n    of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding\r\n  an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of\r\n  another issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the ALC's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  James Wells is Townsend's son.\r\n[2] Â Townsend and her sisters jointly own the property as\r\n  members of an LLC; however, we refer to the property as the Townsend's property\r\n  to be consistent with the ALC's order.\r\n[3] Based on Bailey's allegations, DHEC and the\r\n  Charleston Planning Department conducted an investigation in 2006, but neither\r\n  found any evidence of commercial activity taking place at the dock.\r\n[4]Â  For the purpose of this appeal, Bailey only objected\r\n  to the conversion of a portion of the fixed dock to a floating dock with a\r\n  walkway.\r\n[5]Â  According to Bailey's brief, the DHEC board decided\r\n  not to hear the matter on October 18, 2007; however, a copy of this decision is\r\n  not included in the Record on Appeal.\r\n[6] These sections can now be found in S.C.

James' (James) motion for summary judgment in the matter she brought against him alleging a violation of her rights under the South Carolina Teacher Employment and Dismissal Act (Employment and Dismissal Act).[1] Brown asserts that (1) the circuit court abused its discretion when concluding she had not exhausted her administrative remedies; (2) the circuit court misinterpreted the Employment and Dismissal Act; (3) she had a legal right to appeal directly to the circuit court because the Board of Trustees (Board) had already reached a final decision regarding the nonrenewal of her contract; and (4) the circuit court abused its discretion when concluding that her motion to amend her complaint to add parties was moot.

On April 10, 2007, Brown was called to the Cherokee County School District (District) office to meet with Mr. William A. Jones (Jones), Chief Administrative Officer/Director of Personnel for the District.  Jones and Brown discussed an &quot;improvement letter&quot; Brown had received from Limestone's Principal, Sharon Jefferies (Jefferies), and the fact that Brown had filed a sexual harassment complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Jefferies.[2] Brown informed Jones that she had planned to file the sexual harassment complaint even before she received the improvement letter.[3] Jones told Brown she could either go back to work or take leave under the Family Medical Leave Act due to the &quot;hostile/threatening&quot; work environment.  Brown chose to take the leave because Jones told her she would be paid until the end of her contract year, which was July 2007.  Jones then informed Brown that he was going to recommend that her teaching contract not be renewed and advised her to resign. \r\n Subsequently, Brown received a letter dated April 12, 2007, from James, stating that at Jefferies' recommendation, her contract for the upcoming year would not be renewed. Brown retained attorney Theo W. Mitchell (Attorney Mitchell), and within fifteen days of the April 12, 2007 notice, she submitted a written request for an opportunity to be heard under the Employment and Dismissal Act. The Board received Brown's request on April 27, 2007.  However, on April 24, 2007, the Board took up James' April 12th &quot;notice of intent not to renew&quot; letter and voted to terminate Brown's contract that same day.  The Board did not inform Brown of its decision. \r\n  Even though the Board had already made its final determination regarding Brown's contract, the Board asked Attorney Mitchell if Brown would waive the fifteen-day requirement for scheduling the hearing to give it an opportunity to discuss the matter.  Brown agreed to the waiver. The Board then notified Attorney Mitchell that it wanted to depose Brown before the hearing.\r\n  Subsequently, Attorney Mitchell informed the Board that Brown would not be available for a deposition prior to a hearing.  Thereafter, on two separate occasions, the Board informed Attorney Mitchell that if it did not receive a response from either Brown or him regarding the scheduling of a deposition, it would consider Brown's noncooperation as a voluntary withdrawal of her request for a hearing, and the case would be closed.  Brown did not participate in a deposition.  On November 27, 2007, an attorney for the Board sent Attorney Mitchell a letter stating, &quot;As I have had no contact from you since September 25, 2007, the District now considers the request [for a hearing] to be withdrawn and the matter closed.&quot;  The Board did not schedule or give notice of a hearing.  Consequently, on November 29, 2007, Brown filed an action in the circuit court against James for violation of the Employment and Dismissal Act.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n Brown filed her initial complaint in circuit court because she believed her due process rights were violated under the Employment and Dismissal Act in that her contract was not renewed and she was never afforded an opportunity to be heard.  Specifically, in her complaint against James, Brown alleged breach of contract, fraud, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, negligence and/or negligent misrepresentation, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  In the case before us, Brown asserts the Board made a final decision regarding her employment before she was afforded an opportunity to be heard as required by the Employment and Dismissal Act.  Brown also asserts that she could not comply with the Employment and Dismissal Act's thirty-day appeal process regarding the Board's final determination as she did not have knowledge of the Board's final determination until eleven months after the decision.[4] James did not file a formal answer that addressed any of the issues Brown raised in her complaint.  Instead, on January 18, 2008, fifty days after the complaint was filed and served, James filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, SCRCP. \r\n  On February 13, 2008, Brown filed a motion to add the Board as a defendant.  On March 7, 2008, James renewed his motion, stating only that Brown had not exhausted her administrative remedies.  During February and March 2008, Brown filed a request for production of documents and requests to admit. During March and April, James answered the requests.  After Brown received the responses to the request for production, she sought to amend her complaint to add the Board's attorneys as defendants predicated on their knowledge of and involvement in what she perceived to be a fraudulent act. \r\n  \r\n  On April 28, 2008, the circuit court heard Brown's motion to amend and James' motion to dismiss.  On May 5, 2008, the circuit court issued an order granting James' motion to dismiss,[5] concluding that Brown had not exhausted her administrative remedies.  The court also concluded that based on the dismissal, Brown's motion to amend was rendered moot.  On May 12, 2008, Brown filed a motion for reconsideration, which included a request that if the court upheld the dismissal, that it be without prejudice.  On June 20, 2008, the circuit court issued an order denying Brown's motion.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\n The issue presented in this case is whether the circuit court erred in granting James' motion for summary judgment because it concluded that Brown failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, an appellate court applies the same standard of review as the circuit court under Rule 56, SCRCP.  Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C. 581, 585, 666 S.E.2d 901, 903 (2008).  The circuit court should grant summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is  no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334 (2003); Knox v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 566, 569-70, 608 S.E.2d 459, 461 (Ct. App. 2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. O'Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.  Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r\n  Brown argues the circuit court erred in concluding that her claims were not properly before it due to her failure to exhaust her exclusive statutory remedy under the Employment and Dismissal Act.  We agree.\r\n Initially, we address the applicability of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies to local school boards.  Whether under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA),[6] general administrative law standards, or the fundamental principles of administrative law, Brown was required to exhaust her administrative remedies before seeking judicial review.  Moreover, the Board was also subject to the limitations and exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine.\r\n\r\n   The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies requires that where a remedy before an administrative agency is provided, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts will act.  This doctrine is well established, is a cardinal principle of practically universal application, and must be borne in mind by the courts in construing a statute providing for review of administrative action. \r\n\r\n2 Am. Jur. 2d Administrative Law &sect; 595 (1962) (citing Bustos-Ovalle v. Landon, 225 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1955); James v. Consol. Steel Corp., 195 S.W.2d 955 (Tex. Civ. App. 1946); Bowen v. Dep't of Soc. Sec., 127 P.2d 682 (Wash. 1942)) (footnotes omitted);[7] see also 2 Kenneth Culp Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &sect; 15 (3rd ed. 1994) (quoting Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51 (1938)) (&quot;[It is] the long-settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.&quot;).\r\nUnder the APA, section 1-23-380 specifically states, &quot;A party who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review pursuant to this article and Article 1.&quot;  Our courts have applied the APA standards to certain local school board administrative decisions.  In Lee County School District Board of Trustees v. MLD Charter School Academy Planning Committee, a case involving a local school board's decision regarding a charter school application, our Supreme Court established that the standard of judicial review was the APA standard of review.  371 S.C. 561, 565, 641 S.E.2d 24, 26 (2007).  Also, and more notably, the Court referred to its analysis in Porter v. South Carolina Public Service Commission, 333 S.C. 12, 507 S.E.2d 328 (1998), as establishing the requirements for administrative agencies when presenting their findings.  The Court stated: &quot;[a]lthough Porter addresses the Public Service Commission, we find it applicable to all administrative agencies, including local school boards.&quot;  Lee County Sch. Dist., 371 S.C. at 567, 641 S.E.2d at 28.  (emphasis added).\r\n Further, in McWhirter v. Cherokee County School District No. 1, 274 S.C. 66, 261 S.E.2d 157 (1979), our Supreme Court referred to the actions of a local school board in language that indicates that the board is held to the standards of an &quot;agency&quot; as defined in the APA.  In McWhirter, similar to the case at hand, an elementary school teacher sought to enjoin the school district from terminating her under the Employment and Dismissal Act.  The Court stated:\r\n\r\n   In Law v. Richland County School District No. 1, 270 S.C. 493, 243 S.E.2d 192 (1978), we held that if any of the charges against a teacher are supported by substantial evidence, the school board's decision to dismiss must be sustained.  We defined &quot;substantial evidence&quot; as &quot;evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.&quot;  (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nMcWhirter, 274 S.C. at 68-69, 261 S.E.2d at 158 (emphasis added).\r\nAdditionally, there has also been a decision from this Court interpreting the power of the circuit court under the APA when dealing with a local school board's discretion in teacher terminations under the Employment and Dismissal Act.  In Adamson v. Richland County School District One, this Court stated: &quot;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-23-380(6) (Supp. 1997) [an APA provision] gives the circuit court authority to reverse an agency decision 'made upon unlawful procedure' or in excess of 'statutory authority.'&quot;  332 S.C. 121, 128, 503 S.E.2d 752, 755-56 (Ct. App. 1998) (emphasis added).\r\nHence,&nbsp;the aforementioned authorities militate the conclusion that&nbsp;the parties in the instant action are subject to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine of the APA.  And although the standards of the APA apply in this case, the application of the Employment and Dismissal Act primarily informs the analysis and renders its outcome.\r\n In this case, Brown received notice that her teaching contract was recommended for nonrenewal.[8] In order to fully exhaust her administrative remedies, Brown was required to request a hearing before the Board within the time frame prescribed by the Employment and Dismissal Act.  Section 59-25-420 of the South Carolina Code (2004) states, &quot;Any teacher, receiving a notice that he will not be reemployed for the ensuing year, shall have the same notice and opportunity for a hearing provided in subsequent sections for teachers dismissed for cause during the school year.&quot;\r\nIn order to secure her opportunity for a hearing, Brown was required to make a written request to the Board within fifteen days of the notice of nonrenewal pursuant to section 59-25-460 of the South Carolina Code (2004).  Here, there is no dispute that Brown timely requested a hearing after receiving the Board's April 12, 2007 notice.  The analysis of this matter is convoluted for two reasons: (1) the Board officially voted to terminate Brown's contract on April 24, 2007 (unbeknownst to Brown) prior to affording her the opportunity for a hearing, and (2) the Board dismissed her appeal on November 27, 2007, because she refused to submit to a deposition.  We will address each of these issues in turn.\r\nA. Finality of an Agency Action\r\nBrown asserts that the April 24, 2007 vote by the Board constituted a final action.  We agree.  The minutes of the April 24, 2007, Board meeting show a final decision regarding the termination of Brown's contract was made even before her fifteen-day period to request a hearing had expired.[9] On appeal, James admits a final determination regarding Brown's contract was made on April 24, 2007, but argues that the Board accepted the recommendation &quot;subject to the [Employment and Dismissal] Act's procedural protections, particularly [Brown's] right to a Board hearing.&quot;[10] Yet, there is no language in the Employment and Dismissal Act that states a final decision of the Board is subject to a teacher's right to a hearing after the fact.\r\nOur Supreme Court has expounded upon the exhaustion of administrative remedies with regard to an agency's final decision.  In South Carolina Baptist Hospital v. South Carolina Department of Health &amp; Environmental Control, the Court held:\r\n\r\n  An agency decision which does not decide the merits of a contested case . . . is not a final agency decision subject to judicial review . . . It would be premature for a court to decide the merits of a dispute when the agency responsible for making the decision has not yet had an opportunity to decide the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n291 S.C. 267, 270, 353 S.E.2d 277, 279 (1987).\r\n In that case, the Court did not find judicial review of an interlocutory decision to be appropriate.  Id. Conversely, judicial review would have been appropriate if an evidentiary hearing was conducted and a final decision was made regarding the merits of the case. Id.[11] Additionally, in Canteen v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 624, 682 S.E.2d 504, 507 (Ct. App. 2009), the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission reversed the findings of the single commissioner regarding a brain injury and remanded the case for a determination of permanency to body parts other than the claimant's brain.  The claimant immediately sought judicial review and the employer filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the Appellant Panel's decision was interlocutory because it had remanded the case for further proceedings.  Id. However, this Court held, &quot;because the appellate panel ruled on [the only issue before it], there was a final agency decision on the merits in this case and [the claimant] exhausted all of her administrative remedies.&quot;  Id.\r\nIn the case at hand, whether or not to terminate Brown was the only issue to be determined, and when the Board unanimously voted to terminate Brown, it reached a final decision on the merits.  Section 59-25-480 of the South Carolina Code (2004) specifically states, &quot;The decision of the district board of trustees shall be final, unless within thirty days thereafter an appeal is made to the court of common pleas of any county in which the major portion of such district lies.&quot;\r\nFurther, when the Board voted to accept James' recommendation for the nonrenewal of Brown's teaching contract prior to conducting a hearing, its decision had an immediate effect on Brown's legal rights.[12] Sections 59-25-460 and 59-25-470 of the South Carolina Code (2004) make it expressly clear that before the Board makes a final decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of a recommendation for nonrenewal of a teacher's contract, the teacher must be afforded the opportunity to be heard.  The observance of the procedural requirements of the Employment and Dismissal Act is mandatory and not a matter of discretion.\r\nWith regard to what Board action constituted a final agency decision, James inaccurately interprets the procedure outlined in section 59-25-470 and improperly conflates the requirements of section 59-25-410 with those of section 59-25-470.[13]\r\nSection 59-25-410 of the Employment and Dismissal Act instructs the Board to decide and notify the teachers &quot;in their employ concerning their employment for the ensuing year.&quot;  According to the statute, by April 15th of each year, the Board or its designee,[14] must notify the teachers in writing of the recommendations for non-renewal.   James notified Brown with an April 12th letter of his intent not to renew her contract for the ensuing year.  This satisfied the April 15th notice requirement of section 59-25-410.  Thereafter, pursuant to section 59-25-470, the Board must afford the adversely affected teachers a hearing based on the notice of dismissal that was recommended by the superintendent.  After the hearing is completed, the Board is required to either affirm or withdraw the notice and that action will translate into its final decision. See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 59-25-470 (2004); see also Adamson, 332 S.C. at 128, 503 S.E.2d at 756 (explaining the Board is free to reject the superintendent's recommendation, and, until then, there is no final board action).\r\nContrary to James' argument, there are no inconsistencies or conflicts between section 59-25-410 and 59-25-470.  When the Board voted unanimously on April 24th to terminate Brown's contract, it clearly affirmed the notice of dismissal and this constituted a final decision.  Consequently, there was nothing left procedurally under the Employment and Dismissal Act for Brown to do except appeal to the court of common pleas pursuant to section 59-25-480.  The fact that an administrative hearing was not conducted below rests with the Board's failure to follow procedure as prescribed in the Employment and Dismissal Act, and not in any failure of Brown to exhaust her administrative remedies.\r\nB.  Exceptions to the Requirement of Exhaustion\r\nBrown asserts that even if she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before the Board, exhaustion was not required because her case satisfied one of the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina, like most jurisdictions, recognizes exceptions to the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.  The general rule is that administrative remedies must be exhausted absent circumstances supporting an exception to application of the general rule.  Andrews Bearing Corp. v. Brady, 261 S.C. 533, 536, 201 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1973); Ex parte Allstate Ins. Co., 248 S.C. 550, 567, 151 S.E.2d 849, 855 (1966).  A commonly recognized exception to&nbsp;the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies exists when a party demonstrates that pursuit of administrative remedies would be a vain or futile act.  Moore v. Sumter County Council, 300 S.C. 270, 273, 387 S.E.2d 455, 458 (1990); Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 19, 538 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2000); Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 342 S.C. 34, 39, 535 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2000).  &quot;Futility, however, must be demonstrated by a showing comparable to the administrative agency taking 'a hard and fast position that makes an adverse ruling a certainty.'&quot;  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 438, 629 S.E.2d 642, 650 (2006) (citing Thetford Props. IV Ltd. P'ship v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., 907 F.2d 445, 450 (4th Cir. 1990)).  Another exception to the exhaustion requirement is recognized when an agency has acted outside of its authority.  Responsible Econ. Dev. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 371 S.C. 547, 553, 641 S.E.2d 425, 428 (2007).\r\nBrown argues she was not required to participate in a hearing after a final determination had already been made regarding the nonrenewal of her teaching contract, as such a pursuit would constitute a futile act.  Consequently, she asserts that she was within her legal right to appeal directly to the circuit court.  We agree.\r\nArticle 1, section 22, of the South Carolina State Constitution states:\r\n\r\n  No person shall be finally bound by a judicial or quasi\u001ejudicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights except on due notice and an opportunity to be heard . . . and he shall have in all such instances the right to judicial review.\r\n\r\nFurther, section 59-25-470 states that after the hearing has taken place and the Board has had the opportunity to determine &quot;whether the evidence showed good and just cause for the notice of suspension or dismissal,&quot; or in this case, nonrenewal of Brown's teaching contract, the Board &quot;shall render its decision accordingly, either affirming or withdrawing the notice of suspension or dismissal.&quot;  In his brief, James cites this section of the Code and admits &quot;recommendations, when adverse to a teacher, are subject to the [Employment and Dismissal] Act's procedural protections, particularly the right to a Board hearing pursuant to &sect; 59-25-470.&quot;[15]\r\nPlainly, the procedure is set in place to afford the teacher a meaningful review of the evidence prior to the Board making a final determination, as a review of the evidence after the fact would be futile.   &quot;The elementary and cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the Court ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the legislature.&quot;  Horn v. Davis Elec. Constructors, Inc., 307 S.C. 559, 563, 416 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1992).  Where, as here, the terms are clear and unambiguous, &quot;the Court must apply them according to [their] literal meaning.&quot;  Anders v. S.C. Parole &amp; Cmty. Corr. Bd., 279 S.C. 206, 209, 305 S.E.2d 229, 230 (1983).\r\nOur research has not revealed any specific South Carolina case law addressing whether a teacher must participate in a hearing after the Board has made a final determination regarding the nonrenewal of her contract.  However, courts in other jurisdictions have analyzed issues similar to the case at bar.  Specifically, the Indiana Court of Appeals has held:\r\n\r\n  [T]he notice by the school corporation to the tenure [sic] teachers was not sufficient, as it did not comply with the statutory requirements for the dismissal of a tenure teacher and such failure to comply with the statutory requirements did not require a tenure teacher to go forth with the burden of requesting a hearing for cause.\r\n\r\nJoyce v. Hanover Cmty. Sch. Corp., 276 N.E.2d 549, 564 (Ind. Ct. App. 1971) (finding that the school board's action was arbitrary and capricious as it pertained to tenured teachers), overruled on other grounds by Myers v. Greater Clark County Sch. Corp., 464 N.E.2d 1323 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984); see also  Tippecanoe Valley Sch. Corp. v. Leachman, 261 N.E.2d 880, 887 (Ind. Ct. App. 1970) (holding that &quot;evidence . . . was sufficient to sustain an implied finding by the trial court that the procedure provided by the contract for the removal of the plaintiff from his position as teacher was not followed and that failure to follow it was a gross abuse of discretion&quot;).\r\nThe statutes interpreted in the Pennsylvania case of In re Swink, 200 A. 200 (1938), are very similar to South Carolina law in that they afford a teacher who has been notified that her contract has been recommended for nonrenewal an opportunity to present her case to the local school board before a final decision on termination is made.[16] In that case, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held the Board of School Directors failed to comply with the statutory requirements and reversed the board's actions, stating that the observance of the prescribed procedure &quot;is not a matter of discretion.&quot;  Id. at 203.  The court further held, &quot;[T]he purpose of the procedure prescribed by the act for the dismissal of a teacher . . . is to prevent arbitrary action by the board, to afford a fair hearing to the teacher . . . before dismissal, and to provide for full, impartial, and unbiased consideration by the board of the testimony produced.&quot;  Id. (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the North Dakota Supreme Court has held that in order for a teacher to benefit from a hearing, she must be allowed to present her case in an atmosphere where even though there exists a contemplated recommendation for nonrenewal, the ultimate decision of termination has yet to be made.  Henley v. Fingal Pub. Sch. Dist. #54, 219 N.W.2d 106, 110 (N.D. 1974).  Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Connecticut has explained:\r\n\r\n  Notice before termination and notice after termination are not two sides of the same coin.  Once the board has committed itself by its action to a particular result it may be too late in the day to suggest a change of direction; at that stage the urge to proceed along its committed course is compelling.  But before the die is cast it is still possible for persuasion to affect the result.\r\n\r\nPetrovich v. New Canaan Bd. of Educ., 457 A.2d 315, 318 (Conn. 1983).\r\n Analogous to the cases cited above, in the present case, a hearing after the fact would have likely proven futile.  Sections 59-25-420 and 59-25-430 of the South Carolina Code (2004) provide for a hearing prior to a final decision of the Board to avoid futility and allow for a meaningful and fair administrative hearing.  Section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009) states in part, &quot;A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy.&quot;  Id., see also Jean Hoefer Toal, et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina 49 (2d ed. 2002).\r\nBrown did all that was required of her under the Employment and Dismissal Act.  Consequently, as a matter of law, Brown was entitled to have her case proceed before the circuit court, and the granting of James' motion for summary judgment was improper.\r\nC.  Procedures for Compelling Participation in a Deposition\r\nBrown argues the circuit court incorrectly concluded that because she did not participate in a deposition as requested by the Board, she essentially abandoned her right to a hearing and the Board was justified in dismissing her case.  We agree.\r\nJames argues Brown was required to participate in a deposition prior to a hearing and uses section 59-25-490 of the South Carolina Code (2004) to support his position.  Section 59-25-490, in pertinent part, states, &quot;Any party to such proceedings may cause to be taken the depositions of witnesses . . . .&quot;  (emphasis added).\r\nHowever, the Employment and Dismissal Act does not authorize the Board to dismiss actions for lack of participation in a deposition.  Instead, it outlines the procedure the Board should have taken.  Specifically, the pertinent portion of section 59-25-490 states:\r\n\r\n  Such depositions shall be taken in accordance with and subject to the same provisions, conditions and restrictions as apply to the taking of like depositions in civil actions at law in the court of common pleas; and the same rules with respect to the giving of notice to the opposite party, the taking and transcribing of testimony, the transmission and certification thereof and matters of practice relating thereto shall apply.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nHere, when the Board did not receive any response from Brown or her attorney regarding her participation in the requested deposition, it should have served Brown with a subpoena in an effort to compel her attendance at a deposition pursuant to section 59-25-500 of the South Carolina Code (2004).  Moreover, the Board could have moved before the circuit court to enforce such a subpoena under section 59-25-520.\r\nThe record does not indicate, nor was it asserted at oral argument, that the Board issued a subpoena or that one was served on Brown in an effort to compel her attendance at the requested deposition.  Further, the record does not indicate that Brown was ever served with notice of the deposition or notice of a hearing before the Board.  Section 59-25-520 of the Employment and Dismissal Act does not vest the Board with authority to dismiss Brown's request for a hearing based on her nonparticipation in a deposition;[17] rather, it prescribes procedural mechanisms including seeking sanctions from the circuit court to compel participation in a deposition.  However, the Board did not avail itself of this; instead, it presupposed to dismiss her case, which is not sanctioned under South Carolina law.\r\n II. Dismissal of the Motion to Amend \r\n Brown argues the circuit court abused its discretion when it dismissed her motion to amend her complaint to add parties on the grounds that her motion was moot in light of the fact that the court granted James' motion for summary judgment.  We agree.\r\nRule 15(a), SCRCP, states in part, &quot;[A] party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires and does not prejudice any other party.&quot;  Rule 15(c), SCRCP, further states, &quot;Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleadings, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.&quot;\r\n&quot;It is well established that a motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and that the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.&quot;  City of N. Myrtle Beach v. Lewis-Davis, 360 S.C. 225, 232, 599 S.E.2d 462, 465 (Ct. App. 2004).  &quot;Courts have wide latitude in amending pleadings and '[w]hile this power should not be used indiscriminately or to prejudice or surprise another party, the decision to allow an amendment is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will rarely be disturbed on appeal.'&quot;  Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 450, 492 S.E.2d 794, 792 (Ct. App. 1997).  &quot;The trial judge's finding will not be overturned without an abuse of discretion or unless manifest injustice has occurred.&quot;  Id.\r\nHere, Brown attempted to add the Board's attorneys as defendants based on responses she received from discovery requests.  Brown asserted the alleged improper conduct of the attorneys arose out of the same transaction or occurrence set forth in her original pleading.  Because the circuit court erred in concluding that Brown had not exhausted her administrative remedies and in granting James' motion for summary judgment, Brown's motion to amend her complaint should have been considered.  We, however, do not address the merits of her motion to amend her complaint and we remand the issue of whether Brown should be allowed to amend her complaint to the circuit court.\r\nIII. Automatic Renewal of Contract\r\nBrown contends that because the Board did not recommend the nonrenewal of her contract before the April 15th deadline, her termination was illegal and her contract was automatically renewed.  James argues the Board complied with the Employment and Dismissal Act's April 15th deadline as prescribed in section 59-25-410 of the South Carolina Code (2004) in that Brown received a letter on April 12, 2007, notifying her of his intention to recommend nonrenewal of her contract to the Board.  Brown did not raise the issue of automatic renewal to the circuit court; thus, this issue is not preserved for our review.  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 592 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe wording of the Employment and Dismissal Act is unambiguous regarding procedure, and the record fails to show the Board complied with its requirements.  As a result, the circuit court erred in concluding Brown did not exhaust her administrative remedies.  The circuit court also erred in interpreting the Employment and Dismissal Act, as Brown was not required to request a hearing of the Board after a final decision had been made regarding the nonrenewal of her contract; and, as a matter of law, Brown was entitled to appeal directly to the circuit court.  Accordingly, the circuit court erred when it granted James' motion for summary judgment and when it concluded that Brown's motion to amend her complaint to add parties was moot.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-25-410 to -530 (2004).\r\n[2] The record does not explain what an improvement letter is, but it can be inferred that it is a letter outlining a plan to improve the teacher's performance.  Section 59-25-440 of the South Carolina Code (2004) states:\r\n\r\n  Whenever a superior, principal, where applicable, or supervisor charged with the supervision of a teacher finds it necessary to admonish a teacher for a reason that he believes may lead to, or be cited as a reason for, dismissal or cause the teacher not to be reemployed he shall:  (1) bring the matter in writing to the attention of the teacher involved and make a reasonable effort to assist the teacher to correct whatever appears to be the cause of potential dismissal or failure to be reemployed and, (2) except as provided in section 59\u001e25\u001e450, allow reasonable time for improvement.\r\n\r\n[3] Brown's initial pro se complaint and her sworn affidavit make reference to her EEOC complaint, which she filed based on claims of sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and retaliation.\r\n[4] The Board never sent Brown a formal notification of its final decision regarding her termination.  She became aware of the date of the final decision through the Board's discovery responses to the case before the circuit court.\r\n[5] James filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.  Under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 116, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874 (2006).  In considering such a motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.  Id.  In the order granting the dismissal, the circuit court considered &quot;the record in this case, the applicable law, and the argument of counsel and Brown.&quot;  In doing so, it effectively treated James' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment as it based its ruling on allegations and information set forth outside the complaint.  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999); Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 27, 586 S.E.2d 861, 862-63 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n[6] S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-23-310 to -400 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009).\r\n [7] Although the current version of 2 Am. Jur. 2d Administrative Law does not include the quotation, the cases cited for its propositions are still binding.\r\n[8] The notice did not inform Brown of the cause for the nonrenewal of her contract, as required by sections 59-25-420 and 59-25-460 of the South Carolina Code (2004).\r\n[9] The Agenda for the April 24, 2007 Cherokee County School District No. 1, Board of Trustees, Board Meeting is replete with separate and distinct categories that address personnel recommendations; however, the reference to the nonrenewal of Brown's contract is titled &quot;Terminations.&quot;\r\n[10] James makes these assertions on pages 8 and 9 of the Final Reply Brief of Respondent.\r\n[11] In Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 144 (1993), the United States Supreme Court held that &quot;the finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial agency decision maker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury . . . .&quot;  Additionally, in Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307 F.3d 815, 825-28 (9th Cir. 2002), the Ninth Circuit held that under certain circumstances, an agency's initial decision can be considered final for exhaustion purposes.  Specifically, when an agency has completed the process for reaching an initial decision that has immediate legal effects on the petitioner, the initial decision will be considered a final decision, even though the initial decision-maker may reconsider its decision or the initial decision is subject to review within the agency.\r\n[12] During oral argument, the Court stated, &quot;Her [Brown's] contract was terminated on the 24th,&quot; to which counsel for James interjected, &quot;. . . effective on June 7th.&quot;  Consequently, in order for there to be an effective date of termination, there had to have been a decision to terminate Brown in the first place.\r\n[13] &quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.&quot;  Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 23, 579 S.E.2d 334, 336 (Ct. App. 2003).  &quot;It is well settled that statutes dealing with the same subject matter are in pari materia and must be construed together, if possible, to produce a single, harmonious result.&quot;  Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).\r\n[14] In this case, the Board's designee was Cherokee County Superintendant James.\r\n[15] James makes this assertion on page 9 of the Final Reply Brief of Respondent.\r\n[16] See 24 P.S. &sect; 1121 (1937) and note, and &sect;&sect; 1126, 1161, 1201, and 1202 (1937).\r\n[17] James contends that the Board did not dismiss Brown's request for a hearing for a lack of participation in a deposition.  However, in the November 27, 2007 letter to Brown's then attorney, Theo W. Mitchell, James' attorney states:\r\n\r\n  I am writing to follow up on my letter to you dated October 25, 2007, in which I informed you that it is our position that because Ms. Brown is unable or unwilling to appear for a deposition, she has withdrawn her request for a hearing regarding her non-renewal. . . As I have had no contact from you since September 25, 2007, the District now considers the request to be withdrawn and the matter closed.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4675","title":"Middleton v.

Spitz, all\r\n          of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J.:Â In this dispute involving the interpretation of a real\r\n    property lease, Ernest Middleton, III, and Marjorie Middleton (collectively, Appellants),\r\n    as co-trustees of the will of Ernest Middleton, Jr., appeal from the Master-in-Equity's\r\n    order finding in favor of Manly Eubank, 1625 Partnership, and Palmetto Ford,\r\n    Inc. (collectively, Respondents), the lessees of the property owned by Ernest\r\n    Middleton, Jr.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 28,\r\n  1983, Ernest Middleton, Jr. (Lessor) signed a lease with Eubank, individually\r\n  and as President of Palmetto Ford, Inc., and Hugh Cannon (Lessees), whereby Middleton\r\n  leased real property in Charleston, South Carolina to Palmetto Ford to relocate\r\n  its dealership on the land.[1]Â \r\n  The leased property was composed of two tracts: a 3.476-acre tract on Highway\r\n  17, and a 4.79-acre tract.[2]Â \r\n  The two parcels were separated by a third tract that was owned by a third\r\n  party.Â  At that time, Ford required its dealerships to be built on at least\r\n  seven acres of property.Â  Therefore, the parties agreed the lease would be\r\n  contingent upon the acquisition of an easement to the third-party tract of land\r\n  that would provide access between the two parcels of land, allowing the two\r\n  parcels to function as one and meet Ford's acreage requirement.Â  Almost one\r\n  year later, Lessor and 1625 Partnership were granted two easements for $25,000\r\n  in consideration paid by 1625 Partnership and $200 per month to use a portion\r\n  of the property owned by the third party to provide &quot;vehicular and\r\n  pedestrian access to and from both parcels&quot; of the leased land.Â  The first\r\n  easement connected the two separated parcels and the other provided access from\r\n  the property onto Highway 17.Â  The lease described the property as being\r\n  composed of two tracts, but referred to them collectively as the\r\n  &quot;Property.&quot;Â  The lease did not mention the easements.Â  The lease\r\n  further stated the Respondents would be making improvements to the property:\r\n\r\n  Leesee\r\n    [sic] will have improvements constructed and added to the Property, at a cost\r\n    of approximately $1.1 million, including buildings, paved areas for display and\r\n    parking of vehicles, driveways, lighting, signs, landscaping, and the equipment\r\n    and fixtures (such as heating and air conditioning) which are customarily\r\n    deemed to become a part of the real property to which they are affixed (but\r\n    excluding equipment which is solely for automotive uses) (hereinafter, all such\r\n    included improvements shall be collectively referred to as the\r\n    &quot;Improvements&quot;).\r\n\r\nThe lease\r\n  provided the initial term of the lease would be for thirty years, with the\r\n  possibility of two ten-year renewals, and the annual rent would be an amount\r\n  equal to nine percent of the valuation of the property, to be paid in monthly\r\n  installments.Â  The lease listed the then-current value of the parcels\r\n  separately and together.Â  The property was to be revalued three years from the\r\n  first day of the lease term, and every three years thereafter, and the rent for\r\n  the following three years was to be based on the valuation set at that time.Â  Section\r\n  four of the lease, titled &quot;Valuation,&quot; stated, &quot;The property\r\n  shall be revalued by a MAI appraisal based on raw, unencumbered land with no Improvements,\r\n  for the highest and best use thereof at such time, without regard to any improvements\r\n  thereon or to the use then being made of the property by lessee.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  Further, the lease provided the &quot;Valuation [of the property] shall not be\r\n  decreased during the first Fifteen (15) years of the Property Lease term, and\r\n  that the Valuation for this same Fifteen (15) years shall not be increased more\r\n  than Six percent (6%) per year.&quot;\r\nSeveral\r\n  different appraisers appraised the land from 1984 to 2005.Â  The initial\r\n  appraisal was done on January 13, 1984.Â  Fred Attaway, Jr., MAI, valued the\r\n  property, after the completion of the proposed improvements, at $1.83 million for\r\n  the fee simple estate and at $1.3 million for the leasehold estate.[4]Â \r\n  On January 24, 1994, Attaway re-appraised the raw land at $1.23 million and the\r\n  leased estate at $1.5 million.Â  In this appraisal, Attaway mentions the\r\n  property is divided into two parcels that can function fully; however, he\r\n  states the division has a negative effect on the value because the property is\r\n  separated by an access easement.Â  On August 11, 1999, Attaway appraised the\r\n  property at $2.1 million for the fee simple estate, considering the tracts as\r\n  one parcel because they function as one.Â  Appellants did not increase the rent\r\n  after the 1999 appraisal because the parties disagreed about the amount of the\r\n  appraisal.Â  As a result, the parties reached a temporary agreement that the\r\n  valuation for the following three years would be $1.7 million.\r\nIn\r\n  2002, Christopher Donato, MAI, appraised the property for Appellants.Â  On\r\n  November 13, 2002, Donato appraised the land &quot;as is&quot; at $2,897,000.Â  He\r\n  appraised the property as one parcel connected by the easements because the\r\n  &quot;two easements facilitate access to both tracts and have the affect of\r\n  linking the two tracts such that they can be used in concert.&quot;Â  One month\r\n  later, Donato re-appraised the land at $2,845,000.Â  In this appraisal, at the\r\n  request of Respondents, he appraised the property as separate tracts\r\n  independent of each other without the access easements.Â  On October 21, 2005,\r\n  Donato appraised the land &quot;as is&quot; at $6.34 million.\r\nMichael\r\n  Robinson, MAI, appraised the property for Respondents.Â  On March 3, 2003, Robinson\r\n  appraised the 3.476-acre tract, as if vacant, at $1,911,800 and the 5.577-acre\r\n  tract, as if vacant, at $655,300.Â  He appraised the property as two separate\r\n  and distinct tracts.Â  Hugh Cannon, the attorney who drafted the lease, contacted\r\n  Robinson in January or February 2003 and suggested the easements should not be\r\n  considered in the appraisal.Â  On November 15, 2005, Robinson appraised both\r\n  tracts, as if vacant, at $3,504,400.\r\nOn\r\n  March 2, 2006, Appellants filed a complaint in Charleston County Court of\r\n  Common Pleas against Respondents, seeking a judicial declaration as to the\r\n  rights and obligations of the parties under the Lease.Â  The complaint alleged\r\n  that based on the clear language of the valuation clause, the parties intended\r\n  that the appraisal would be based upon the most valuable and profitable use of\r\n  the property, which includes the easements and appraising both parcels together\r\n  as a unit. Â However, Respondents asserted the parcels must be appraised as\r\n  separate, unrelated, and unconnected parcels.Â  Appellants also claimed\r\n  Respondents refused to agree on a methodology for appraising the value of the\r\n  property.Â  In their amended answer, Respondents alleged:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    &quot;Property,&quot; as defined in the Lease and as it actually existed at the\r\n    time the Lease was entered, was two separate and distinct tracts of land, not\r\n    connected by easements, and thus the &quot;Property&quot; that is to be\r\n    revalued pursuant to [the valuation clause] should continue to consist of two\r\n    separate tracts of vacant land, as they existed on July 28, 1983, unconnected\r\n    by any easements and should therefore continue to be appraised as raw, unencumbered\r\n    land with no Improvements as set forth in the Lease.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  July 30, 2007, the parties consented to refer the declaratory judgment action\r\n  to the Master-in-Equity for Charleston County.Â  A non-jury trial was held on\r\n  December 5 and 6, 2007. Â At the close of the presentation of their case, Appellants\r\n  moved for a directed verdict on the question of whether an easement is an\r\n  improvement under the law and the lease.[5]Â \r\n  At the conclusion of the trial, the master ruled for Respondents from the bench,\r\n  and on December 18, 2007, he issued his order.Â  The master found that (1) the\r\n  lease was unambiguous; (2) the plain language of the lease negated consideration\r\n  of easements in the revaluation; (3) the easements were improvements; (4) the\r\n  parties' subsequent conduct supported his interpretation of the lease; and (5)\r\n  Appellants' interpretation of the lease would lead to unjust or absurd\r\n  results.Â  Appellants filed a motion for new trial, or in the alternative, for\r\n  reconsideration, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which was denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA declaratory\r\n  judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature\r\n  of the underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400\r\n  S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  A lease agreement is a contract, and an action to\r\n  construe a contract is an action at law.Â  Duncan v. Little, 384 S.C.\r\n  420, 424, 682 S.E.2d 788, 790 (2009); Piedmont Interstate Fair Ass'n v. City\r\n    of Spartanburg, 274 S.C. 462, 465, 264 S.E.2d 926, 927 (1980).Â  &quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect\r\n  to the parties' intentions as determined by the contract language.&quot;Â  McGill\r\n    v. Moore, 381 S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009).Â  When a contract's\r\n  language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the force and\r\n  effect of the contract.Â  Id.Â  &quot;A contract is read as a whole\r\n  document so that one may not create an ambiguity by pointing out a single\r\n  sentence or clause.&quot;Â  Id.Â  However, if a contract is deemed ambiguous,\r\n  the fact finder must ascertain the parties' intentions from the evidence\r\n  presented.Â  Duncan, 384 S.C. at 425, 682 S.E.2d at 790.Â  &quot;It is a\r\n  question of law for the court whether the language of a contract is ambiguous.&quot;\r\n  Â McGill, 381 S.C. at 185, 672 S.E.2d at 574.Â  In an action at law, tried\r\n  without a jury, the trial court's findings of fact will not be disturbed unless\r\n  there is no evidence that reasonably supports the court's findings.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the master erred in ignoring the plain language of the lease that\r\n  required a MAI appraisal of the property according to its highest and best use\r\n  at the time, which they assert includes the easements.Â  We disagree.\r\nAll\r\n  of the parties asserted the lease was unambiguous; therefore, the court was\r\n  required to ascertain and give legal effect to the parties' intentions as\r\n  determined by the contract language.Â  See McGill v. Moore, 381\r\n  S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009).\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the revaluation of the property according to &quot;its highest and best\r\n  use at the time&quot; must include the easements.Â  Appellants assert their\r\n  expert witnesses, Thomas Hartnett and Christopher Donato, both real estate\r\n  appraisers, recognized the highest and best use of the property at the time\r\n  they conducted their appraisals included the easements because the easements\r\n  allowed the two separate tracts to function as one parcel.Â  Therefore, they\r\n  testified that pursuant to the valuation clause of the lease, the two parcels\r\n  should be revalued as a single unified parcel with the connecting easements.Â \r\n  They also testified the easements did not qualify as subsequently-acquired\r\n  improvements that would be excluded under the valuation clause of the lease.Â  However,\r\n  Donato admitted that under Webster's Dictionary's definition of the word\r\n  &quot;improvement,&quot; the easements would be defined as improvements because\r\n  they added a benefit and value to the property.\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, Mike Robinson and Debra Haskell, both real estate appraisers hired by\r\n  Respondents, testified the property should be valued as two separate parcels.Â \r\n  They also testified the easements are subsequent improvements to the property;\r\n  therefore, they should not be considered in revaluing the two tracts of land because\r\n  &quot;improvements&quot; were to be excluded according to the valuation clause\r\n  of the lease.Â  The master stated he found Robinson and Haskell to be highly\r\n  credible and persuasive.\r\nIn\r\n  looking at the language of the lease, we note it referred to two separate and\r\n  distinct tracts, and it does not mention the easements.Â  As the master stated\r\n  in his order, &quot;the lease calls for just what it says â€“ revaluation under\r\n  paragraph [four] of the 'property' being 'leased,' and that is, quite clearly,\r\n  the two separate and distinct tracts of land referred to [in] the Lease\r\n  itself.&quot;Â  Therefore, we find the clear language of the lease supports the master's\r\n  conclusion that &quot;[i]t could not have been intended under the Lease itself,\r\n  or under Section [four] of that Agreement, to address a future easement, sold\r\n  to the parties a year after the lease was entered into, which was never\r\n  previously owned by either the landlord or the tenant but by a totally\r\n  independent third party.&quot;Â  We also find the evidence supports the master's\r\n  conclusion that this was the &quot;only reasonable construction&quot; of the\r\n  lease when considered as a whole and &quot;[t]o interpret a subsequent sale\r\n  [the easements] as new leased property is contrary to common sense and would\r\n  lead to an unjust and absurd result.&quot;\r\nBecause\r\n  we affirm the master's finding that the lease was unambiguous and the plain\r\n  language of the lease negated consideration of the easements in the revaluation\r\n  of the property, we need not address Appellants' remaining arguments.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining\r\n  issues when its determination of another issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the master's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On July 22, 1983, the parties signed an agreement\r\n  that detailed the provisions to be included in the lease.Â  Four months later,\r\n  the lease was amended by a supplemental agreement.Â  On January 18, 1984,\r\n  Eubank, Hugh Cannon, and Palmetto Ford assigned the property lease to 1625\r\n  Partnership.Â  Thereafter, on October 30, 1984, the lease was amended to add a\r\n  new section entitled &quot;Leasehold Mortgage.&quot;Â  The lease term began on\r\n  November 1, 1984.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Tax map numbers 349-01-00-014 and 349-01-00-026.\r\n[3] Hereinafter referred to as &quot;the valuation\r\n  clause.&quot;\r\n[4] Â This appraisal was completed prior to the\r\n  acquisition of the easements.\r\n[5]Â  The master did not rule on the motion, stating:\r\n  &quot;Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself? . . . You are asking me,\r\n  essentially, for the ultimate decision in the case.Â  And I've only heard from\r\n  one side, the other side hadn't moved for any kind of motion, yet.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4676","title":"King v.

Bruno Yacht Sales, 353\r\n  S.C. 31, 577 S.E.2d 202 (2003).[3]Â \r\n  Thereafter, pursuant to section 12-51-40(d), the County advertised the Property\r\n  and sold it at a tax sale to James in 1999.Â  \r\nAlthough the Property was\r\n  very close to James' home, she testified she had only a rough idea of the\r\n  Property's location until she had it surveyed in March 2005.Â  In fact, James\r\n  believed she had purchased the land adjacent to the Property.Â  After the survey\r\n  showed James was the owner of the Property, James visited the Property and\r\n  spoke with King and Salina.Â  James first offered to sell the Property back to\r\n  King for $50,000.Â  However, the sale never materialized.Â  Subsequently, James\r\n  offered to lease the Property to King and Salina for $500 per month, and they\r\n  entered into a lease agreement from September 2005 until September 2006.Â  \r\nIn April 2006, King brought\r\n  an action against James and the County to set aside the tax sale.Â  James and\r\n  the County answered, asserting as defenses the two-year statute of limitations\r\n  under section 12-51-160, laches, estoppel, waiver, abandonment, acquiescence,\r\n  and stale demand.Â  The case was tried in Beaufort County before\r\n  Master-in-Equity Marvin H. Dukes (the Master) in 2008.Â  \r\nKing and Salina testified at\r\n  the hearing before the Master they had never received any notice from the\r\n  County that the taxes on the Property were delinquent, nor had they seen any\r\n  posting by the County on the Property.Â  King testified when she attempted to\r\n  pay taxes on the Property in 2000 at the Beaufort County courthouse, an\r\n  employee told her the County would not accept her money, that there was an\r\n  unspecified &quot;problem&quot; with her property taxes, and she should contact\r\n  an attorney.Â  King hired an attorney, Doug MacNielle, in 2001.Â  According to\r\n  King, MacNielle informed her he had &quot;run a survey,&quot; and it showed her\r\n  name &quot;was still on the [Property].&quot;Â  When asked whether she thought\r\n  to ask anybody else at the treasurer's office why she was not receiving any tax\r\n  bills for the Property after 2000, she responded, &quot;Honestly, no.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Master held the statute\r\n  of limitations in section 12-51-160[4] was inapplicable to King's action because King remained in possession of the\r\n  Property at all times and, to the extent the execution of the lease in 2005\r\n  constituted an &quot;ouster,&quot; King brought her action to set aside the tax\r\n  sale within two years of the ouster.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the Master\r\n  relied on Dibble v. Bryant, in which our supreme court held the earlier\r\n  version of section 12-51-160[5] &quot;was intended to bar a defaulting and ousted taxpayer from maintaining an\r\n  action to defeat the title of the tax sale purchaser and recover the land if\r\n  brought more than two years from the date the purchaser came into possession.&quot;Â \r\n  274 S.C. 481, 487, 265 S.E.2d 673, 677 (1980).Â  \r\nAs to the actual tax sale,\r\n  the Master noted: &quot;[T]ax sales must be conducted in strict compliance with\r\n  statutory requirements.&quot;Â  Hawkins, 353 S.C. at 36, 577 S.E.2d at\r\n  205.Â  In light of the County's stipulation that notice was improper under Hawkins,\r\n  the Master found the County failed to meet the &quot;strict compliance&quot;\r\n  standard, and therefore, the tax deed was void and of no effect.Â  The Master\r\n  further held the County had failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that\r\n  King ever received any delinquent tax notices.Â  Finally, the Master found &quot;[n]o\r\n  competent evidence was presented that [the Property] was properly posted,&quot;\r\n  because Evans â€“ the County's only witness â€“ had no personal knowledge of the\r\n  posting other than what was in the County's records, and both King and Salina\r\n  testified they never saw a posting on the Property.[6]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to set aside a tax\r\n  sale lies in equity.Â  Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 160, 650 S.E.2d 486,\r\n  488 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Our scope of review for a case heard by a Master permits\r\n  us to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Id.Â  However, this scope of review does not require this\r\n  court to disregard the Master's factual findings because the Master saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses and was, therefore, in a better position to judge the\r\n  witnesses' credibility and demeanor.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Tax Sale\r\nKing argues the tax sale and\r\n  resulting tax deed are invalid because the County failed to strictly comply\r\n  with statutory notice requirements leading up to the tax sale.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Tax sales must be\r\n  conducted in strict compliance with statutory requirements.&quot; Â In Re Ryan,\r\n  335 S.C. 392, 395, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999) (citing Dibble, 274 S.C. at\r\n  483, 265 S.E.2d at 675). Â &quot;[A]ll requirements of the law leading up to tax\r\n  sales which are intended for the protection of the taxpayer against surprise or\r\n  the sacrifice of his property are to be regarded [as] mandatory and are to be\r\n  strictly enforced.&quot; Â Donohue v. Ward, 298 S.C. 75, 83, 378 S.E.2d\r\n  261, 265 (Ct. App. 1989) (citing Osborne v. Vallentine, 196 S.C. 90, 94,\r\n  12 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1941)).Â  &quot;Even actual notice is insufficient to uphold\r\n  a tax sale absent strict compliance with statutory requirements.&quot; Â Ryan\r\n    Inv. Co., 335 S.C. at 395, 517 S.E.2d at 693.Â  &quot;Failure to give the\r\n  required notice [of a tax sale] is a fundamental defect in the tax sale\r\n  proceedings which renders the proceedings absolutely void.&quot; Â Rives v.\r\n    Bulsa, 325 S.C. 287, 293, 478 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nAppellants have conceded the\r\n  tax sale was not proper under Hawkins due to the defective stamp in the\r\n  notices to King.Â  Moreover, neither of the Appellants has appealed the Master's\r\n  finding that the tax sale was not conducted in strict compliance with statutory\r\n  requirements.Â  Therefore, this ruling is the law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee\r\n    Acquisition Fund, LP v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489\r\n  S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, becomes\r\n  the law of the case).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the Master's finding as to the\r\n  invalidity of the tax sale and tax deed.\r\n2. Statute of Limitations\r\nAppellants argue even if the\r\n  tax sale was improper under Hawkins due to the defective notice, the\r\n  Master nevertheless erred in failing to apply the two-year statute of\r\n  limitations from section 12-51-160 to bar King's claim because (1) section\r\n  12-51-160 clearly states the statute begins to run &quot;from the date of the\r\n  [tax] sale,&quot; and (2) alternatively, even if King did not have actual\r\n  knowledge of the sale, the statute began to run against her in 2000 when an\r\n  employee of the treasurer's office told her there was a &quot;problem&quot;\r\n  with her taxes.Â  We disagree.\r\nOne purpose of a statute of\r\n  limitations is to relieve the courts of the burden of trying stale claims when\r\n  a plaintiff has slept on his or her rights. McKinney v. CSX Transp., Inc.,\r\n  298 S.C. 47, 49-50, 378 S.E.2d 69, 70 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  The statute of\r\n  limitations begins to run at the time the cause of action accrues. Â Harvey\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't. of Corr., 338 S.C. 500, 508, 527 S.E.2d 765, 769 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (citing Matthews v. City of Greenwood, 305 S.C. 267, 269, 407 S.E.2d\r\n  668, 669 (Ct. App. 1991)). In analyzing a limitations defense, &quot;[t]he\r\n  fundamental test for determining whether a cause of action has accrued is\r\n  whether the party asserting the claim can maintain an action to enforce it.&quot; Id. (quoting Matthews, 305 S.C. at 269, 407 S.E.2d at 669). Thus,\r\n  a particular cause of action accrues &quot;at the moment when the plaintiff has\r\n  a legal right to sue on it.&quot; Id.Â  \r\nThis court has held the\r\n  purpose of the statute of limitations as set forth in section 12-51-160 is &quot;to\r\n  create a time limit during which one who lost title to property through a tax\r\n  sale, after proper notice, may attempt to regain title.&quot; Corbin v.\r\n    Carlin, 366 S.C. 187, 194, 620 S.E.2d 745, 749 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  A review\r\n  of case law in this area reveals somewhat divergent decisions regarding if and\r\n  when the statute of limitations begins to run in situations such as this.Â  \r\nOn the one hand, we find case\r\n  law that says when notice to the homeowner is not in strict compliance with the\r\n  statute, such a defect is &quot;jurisdictional,&quot; and the statute of\r\n  limitations does not run at all.Â  See Donohue v. Ward, 298 S.C.\r\n  75, 82, 378 S.E.2d 261, 265 (1989) (holding where a defect in notice is\r\n  jurisdictional, such a defect &quot;invalidates the tax proceeding and prevents\r\n  the running of the limitations statute&quot;); Good v. Kennedy, 291 S.C.\r\n  204, 207, 352 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1987) (holding &quot;the general law is that\r\n  where a statute requires as a condition precedent to foreclosing a taxpayer's\r\n  rights in property sold for taxes that he be given notice of his right to\r\n  redeem, such a requirement is generally regarded as jurisdictional . . . .&quot;)\r\n  (internal quotations omitted). \r\nOn the other hand, we also\r\n  find case law in which our courts interpreted previous versions of section 12-51-160\r\n  as saying even if the notice is defective, the statute of limitations still\r\n  applies, but only begins to run when the purchaser comes into possession.Â  See Dibble v. Bryant, 274 S.C. 481, 487, 265 S.E.2d 673, 677 (1980) (holding\r\n  previous version of section 12-51-160 &quot;was intended to bar a defaulting and\r\n  ousted taxpayer from maintaining an action to defeat the title of the tax sale\r\n  purchaser and recover the land if brought more than two years from the date\r\n    the purchaser came into possession&quot;) (emphasis added); Glymph v.\r\n      Smith, 180 S.C. 382, 384, 185 S.E. 911, 914 (1936) (holding even though the\r\n  plaintiff brought the action six years after the tax sale, the two-year statute\r\n  of limitations never began to run because the sheriff never took possession of\r\n  the subject property, and the purchaser was never put into possession following\r\n  the execution of the tax deed); Gardner v. Reedy, 62 S.C. 503, 503, 40\r\n  S.E. 947, 947 (1902) (holding the two-year statute of limitations would only\r\n  begin to run if and when the purchaser took possession).\r\nRegardless of which of the\r\n  two above interpretations is correct, Appellant's argument as to the statute of\r\n  limitations necessarily fails because King brought her action within two years\r\n  of the buyer coming into possession.Â  In the present case, the Master held, and\r\n  we agree, the County failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence\r\n  that it took &quot;exclusive possession&quot; of the Property by posting, as is\r\n  required under section 12-51-40(c).Â  Moreover, James could not reasonably be\r\n  said to have withheld possession of the Property from King until 2005, when she\r\n  had the Property surveyed and informed King of her ownership. Â Then and only then\r\n  would the purchaser have come &quot;into possession&quot; under Dibble,\r\n  such that the statute would begin to run.Â  274 S.C. at 487, 265 S.E.2d at 677; see also Scott v. Boyle, 271 S.C. 252, 256, 246 S.E.2d 887, 889\r\n  (1978) (holding section 12-49-570 did not bar an action to set aside a tax deed\r\n  brought six years after the sale because there was insufficient evidence the\r\n  purchaser ever obtained possession, and therefore, the statute never began to\r\n  run); Leysath v. Leysath, 209 S.C. 342, 344, 40 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1946)\r\n  (holding the two-year statute of limitations in section 12-49-570 &quot;does\r\n  not begin to run until the purchaser is put into possession&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  Master's holding that the two-year statute of limitations of section 12-51-160\r\n  does not bar King's action to set aside the tax sale in this case.\r\n3. Other Defenses\r\nThe Master also held the\r\n  Appellants' additional defenses of laches, estoppel, waiver, abandonment,\r\n  acquiescence, and stale demand were likewise inapplicable.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\n  a. Laches and Stale Demand\r\n\r\nAppellants argue laches and\r\n  stale demand should apply to bar King's claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the doctrine of laches,\r\n  if a party, knowing his rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable\r\n  delay causes his adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or\r\n  otherwise detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse\r\n  to enforce those rights.Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for Lee\r\n    County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993).Â  The party seeking\r\n  to establish laches must show: (1) a delay, (2) that was unreasonable under the\r\n  circumstances, and (3) prejudice.Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195,\r\n  199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1988).Â  When a Master declines to make a finding of\r\n  laches, that decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Brown\r\n    v. Butler, 347 S.C. 259, 265, 554 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2001); Premium\r\n      Inv. Corp. v. Green, 283 S.C. 464, 473, 324 S.E.2d 72, 78 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nA stale demand, on the other\r\n  hand, is\r\n\r\n  [O]ne\r\n    that has for a long time remained unasserted; one that is first asserted after\r\n    an unexplained delay of such great length as to render it difficult or\r\n    impossible for the court to ascertain the truth of the matters in controversy\r\n    and to do justice between the parties, or as to create a presumption against\r\n    the existence or validity of the claim, or a presumption that it has been\r\n    abandoned or satisfied.Â  \r\n\r\nAll Saints Parish,\r\n  Waccamaw v. The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of S.C., 358 S.C. 209, 236, 595 S.E.2d 253, 268 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  \r\nStrictly speaking, there are\r\n  some points of distinction between laches and staleness of demand.Â  Bell v.\r\n    Mackey, 191 S.C. 105, 109, 3 S.E.2d 816, 824 (1939).Â  For instance, a stale\r\n  demand implies a greater lapse of time than is necessary to laches.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Moreover, laches generally involves such change in conditions as would render\r\n  inequitable the enforcement of a claim, while no such change is necessary in\r\n  order to create staleness of demand. Â Id.Â  However, they both fall\r\n  within the same general principles of equity, and the distinctions are of\r\n  little practical importance.Â  Id.[7]\r\nWe find laches and stale\r\n  demand to be inapplicable for two reasons.Â  First, the lapse of time between\r\n  James' assertion of ownership in 2005 and King's filing in 2006 was not of an\r\n  unreasonable length.Â  Although King was told there was an unspecified\r\n  &quot;problem&quot; with her taxes in 2000, her attorney advised her in early\r\n  2001 that her name was still on the property.Â  Under the circumstances, we find\r\n  it was not unreasonable for King to decline to investigate the matter further\r\n  in reliance on the advice of counsel.[8]\r\nSecond, neither James nor the\r\n  County has shown sufficient prejudice resulting from King's delay such that\r\n  affirming the Master would lead to an inequitable result.Â  James testified she\r\n  did not even know she owned the Property until 2005, and there is no evidence\r\n  showing she has entered into any obligation or changed any position based on\r\n  King's delay.Â  James' only expense on the Property has been the ongoing\r\n  property tax, which is not an expense caused by delay.Â  The only injury the\r\n  County has claimed is its inability to refund the purchase price to James\r\n  because the unclaimed overage from the tax sale has escheated to the County's\r\n  general fund pursuant to section 12-51-130 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2009).[9]Â \r\n  We find it would be inequitable to allow the County to claim the automatic\r\n  operation of the statute as its source of prejudice in a case where it was the\r\n  County's admitted failure to strictly comply with statutory requirements that\r\n  led to an invalid tax sale.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  Master's findings as to the Appellants' laches and stale demand claims.\r\n\r\n  b. Waiver/Abandonment/Acquiescence/Estoppel\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the defenses\r\n  of waiver, abandonment, acquiescence, and estoppel should apply because King\r\n  and Salina waived their rights and/or acquiesced in James' rights to the\r\n  Property by entering into a lease with James to rent the Property.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nA waiver is a voluntary and\r\n  intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right. Â Eason v. Eason,\r\n  384 S.C. 473, 480, 682 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009). Â In order for a party to waive a\r\n  right, the party must have known of the right and known that the right was\r\n  being abandoned. Id. The determination of whether one's actions\r\n  constitute waiver is a question of fact. Laser Supply &amp; Servs., Inc. v.\r\n    Orchard Park Assocs., 382 S.C. 326, 337, 676 S.E.2d 139, 145 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\nIn this case, we do not\r\n  believe King or Salina waived or abandoned any rights in the Property by\r\n  entering into the lease with James.Â  Salina testified they entered into the\r\n  lease on advice of counsel as a means of preventing James from selling the\r\n  property to a third party.Â  Immediately upon learning of James' ownership\r\n  interest in the Property, Salina and King took action to maintain the use of\r\n  the property and challenge James' ownership of it.Â  At all times after the\r\n  survey in 2005, Salina and King were pursuing legal counsel, and we believe the\r\n  execution of the lease was more in the nature of a strategic maneuver made in\r\n  anticipation of litigation than an abandonment of their rights in the Property.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  Master's finding that waiver is inapplicable.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm\r\n  the finding of the Master that:\r\n1. The tax sale was\r\n  invalid pursuant to Hawkins;\r\n2. Because the\r\n  statute of limitations did not begin to run until the purchaser came into\r\n  possession, King's action was timely; and\r\n3. Laches, stale\r\n  demand, waiver, estoppel, acquiescence, and abandonment do not apply to King's\r\n  action.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The tax sale\r\n  produced an overage of $1,458.68.Â  \r\n[2] Although Mack\r\n  was present at the trial, Mack was never called to testify.\r\n[3] In Hawkins,\r\n  the supreme court held delinquent tax notices stamped with payment deadlines\r\n  that were weeks before the actual date of sale were not in strict compliance\r\n  with statutory requirements, and therefore, the supreme court set aside the\r\n  resulting tax sale.Â  353 S.C. at 38, 577 S.E.2d at 206.Â  The County conceded it\r\n  did not correct its notices pursuant to Hawkins until 2003.Â  Therefore,\r\n  these defective stamps were in the notices sent to King.\r\n[4] Pursuant to South\r\n  Carolina Code section 12-51-160 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2008), &quot;An action for\r\n  the recovery of land sold pursuant to this chapter or for the recovery of the\r\n  possession must not be maintained unless brought within two years from the\r\n    date of the sale as provided in Section 12-51-90(C).&quot; (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n[5] The applicable\r\n  statutory procedure for the sale of a delinquent taxpayer's property at the\r\n  time Dibble was decided was set forth in sections 12-49-410 to -570, but\r\n  was effectively repealed on January 1, 1986.Â  See 1985 Act No. 166, Â§\r\n  17.Â  The applicable code sections governing tax sales, such as King's, are now\r\n  designated in sections 12-51-40 to -170.\r\n[6] Evans testified\r\n  in 2003 the County began keeping photographic records of postings as evidence\r\n  of postings.Â  \r\n[7] We also note\r\n  some courts have declined to recognize stale demand as anything more than a\r\n  laches defense.Â  See, e.g., U.S. v. Admin. Enters., 46 F.3d 670,\r\n  672 (7th Cir. 1995) (&quot;There is no defense of 'staleness,' despite a dictum\r\n  in United States v. Gimbel, 782 F.2d 89, 93 (7th Cir.1986), on which the\r\n  appellants rely. Laches is a legal doctrine; it has structure; 'staleness' is\r\n  an epithet.&quot;).Â  Nonetheless, any such distinction would not be dispositive\r\n  of this issue.\r\n[8] We do note that\r\n  although King's attorney advised her in 2001 the Property was still titled in\r\n  her name, King was arguably still on inquiry notice of the tax sale because despite\r\n  the reassurance from her attorney, King did not receive any subsequent tax\r\n  bills for the Property.Â  The fact that King paid taxes every year since 1974\r\n  implies that she knew property taxes must be paid annually.Â  Thus, the reasonableness\r\n  of her failure to further investigate the &quot;problem&quot; is questionable.Â \r\n  However, we believe laches is nevertheless inapplicable due to the Appellants'\r\n  failure to show sufficient prejudice.\r\n[9] Section\r\n  12-51-130 provides in relevant part that overages produced at tax sales\r\n  automatically escheat to the County's general fund if not claimed within five\r\n  years from the date of the sale.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4677 ","title":"Moseley v.

Hampton appeal the circuit court's finding that they committed fraud in the\r\n  inducement through the sale of a parcel of real estate.Â  We affirm in part and\r\n  reverse in part.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August\r\n  2002, Michael and Marsha Moseley (the Moseleys) purchased Lot 45 in the Secret\r\n  Cove subdivision in Lexington County. Â Lot 45 was an undeveloped lot owned by All\r\n  Things Possible, Inc. of which James Hampton is the president. Â Lot\r\n  45 was encumbered by an underground, surface-water drainage easement running\r\n  diagonally across the entire length of the property. Â Â Hampton was aware\r\n  of the drainage easement and intended to build a house on the corner of Lot 45\r\n  away from the easement. The easement is not recorded in a deed; however,\r\n  it is recorded in a drawing on the recorded plat of the subdivision\r\n  (subdivision drawing). Â According to the developer of Secret Cove, Lot\r\n  45 is unbuildable due to the location of the easement.Â  Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAll Things Possible listed Lot 45 for sale through its real estate\r\n  agent, Loretta Whitehead. Â The Moseleys contacted Whitehead, and she\r\n  arranged for them to purchase Lot 45.Â  During the course of their dealings, Whitehead\r\n  received a faxed copy of the plat of Lot 45 that indicated Lot 45 was\r\n  unencumbered (falsified plat). Â She was unsure who sent the fax to her\r\n  office.Â  Whitehead, who was unaware of the easement, provided the Moseleys with\r\n  the faxed copy of the falsified plat. Â Further, she advised the Moseleys\r\n  they would be able to build a home on the lot.Â  James Jones, the Moseley's\r\n  attorney, contracted with Professional Title Services to prepare a title\r\n  abstract. Â The Moseleys contend the title report did not contain the\r\n  subdivision drawing. The Moseleys purchased Lot 45 for $37,500, unaware that\r\n  the property was encumbered by the easement.Â  In January 2005, the\r\n  Moseleys learned of the easement through a real estate agent of a potential\r\n  buyer. Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn July 2005, the Moseleys filed suit against All Things Possible and\r\n  Hampton alleging causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and breach of\r\n  contract accompanied by a fraudulent act. Â This action was tried without a jury\r\n  on April 24, 2007, and the Moseleys proceeded solely on the fraud cause of\r\n  action. Â The circuit court found Hampton provided a falsified plat to\r\n  the Moseleys through his real estate agent and induced them to buy Lot 45.Â  The\r\n  circuit court determined Hampton had full knowledge of the falsity of his\r\n  representation and intended for the Moseleys to act upon his misrepresentation.\r\n  Furthermore, the circuit court concluded Hampton's misrepresentation was\r\n  material, as the Moseleys would not have purchased Lot 45 had they known of the\r\n  drainage easement.Â  The circuit court found the Moseleys were unaware at\r\n  the time of purchase that there was an easement and did everything reasonable\r\n  to inspect and obtain information concerning the property. Â Additionally, the\r\n  circuit court found the Moseleys had a right to rely on and were proximately\r\n  injured by Hampton's misrepresentation. Â Thus, the circuit court found Hampton\r\n  committed fraud in the inducement.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court also found Hampton was the agent of All Things\r\n  Possible and exercised complete control over the actions of the corporation. The\r\n  circuit court determined Hampton's fraudulent concealment of the drainage\r\n  easement and his sale of Lot 45 to the Moseleys was an action within the scope\r\n  of his employment as president of All Things Possible.Â Â  Consequently, the\r\n  circuit court found All Things Possible vicariously liable for Hampton's fraud\r\n  and determined that All Things Possible also engaged in fraud by concealment and\r\n  fraud by misrepresentation. The circuit court awarded the Moseleys\r\n  $44,275 in actual damages and $44,275 in punitive damages. Â All Things\r\n  Possible and Hampton appealed.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn action for fraud is an action at law.Â  Hendricks v. Hicks,\r\n  374 S.C. 616, 619, 649 S.E.2d 151, 152 (Ct. App. 2007). &quot;In an action at\r\n  law tried without a jury, an appellate court's scope of review extends merely\r\n  to the correction of errors of law.&quot;Â  Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc., 381\r\n  S.C. 597, 599-600, 675 S.E.2d 414, 415 (2009).Â  An appellate court will not\r\n  disturb a circuit court's findings unless they are found to be without evidence\r\n  that reasonably supports those findings.Â  Id. at 600, 675 S.E.2d at\r\n  415.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; All Things Possible\r\n  \r\nAll Things Possible and Hampton argue the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding All Things Possible committed fraud by clear and convincing evidence. Â We\r\n  disagree.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;Fraud is an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of\r\n  inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging\r\n  to her or to surrender a legal right.&quot;Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch,\r\n  354 S.C. 648, 672, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Black's Law\r\n  Dictionary 660 (6th ed.1990)). Â To prevail on a cause of action for fraud, a\r\n  Plaintiff must prove by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following\r\n  elements:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\t(1) a\r\n  representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of\r\n  its falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that\r\n  the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity;\r\n  (7) the hearer's reliance on its truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon;\r\n  and (9) the hearer's consequent and proximate injury.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Id. at 672, 582 S.E.2d at 444-45. Â To establish a claim\r\n  or defense of fraud in the inducement, a plaintiff must prove the nine elements\r\n  of fraud as well as the following three elements: &quot;(1) that the alleged\r\n  fraudfeasor made a false representation relating to a present or preexisting\r\n  fact; (2) that the alleged fraudfeasor intended to deceive him; and (3) that he\r\n  had a right to rely on the representation made to him.&quot;Â  Darby v.\r\n  Waterboggan of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 288 S.C. 579, 584, 344 S.E.2d 153, 155\r\n  (Ct. App. 1986).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court found the Moseleys had a right to rely on Hampton's\r\n  misrepresentations because he was the seller of real property, and his representations\r\n  concerned the absence of a latent defect in the property.Â  The circuit court determined\r\n  that sellers have a duty to disclose latent defects to buyers and thus the\r\n  Moseleys rightly relied to their detriment on Hampton's misrepresentation\r\n  concerning the property.Â  The circuit court noted that easements do\r\n  &quot;not generally come within the definition of a 'latent' defect because such\r\n  should be discovered upon a 'reasonable' examination of the property by way of\r\n  title search or survey.&quot; Â However, the circuit court found this\r\n  case was distinguishable because the Moseleys were deterred by Hampton's behavior\r\n  from requesting or demanding a survey prior to closing.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court noted that All Things Possible and Hampton rely on LoPresti\r\n  v. Burry, 364 S.C. 271, 612 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 2005), to support their\r\n  argument that the Moseleys had constructive notice of the easement. Â However,\r\n  the circuit court also noted that LoPresti held constructive notice is\r\n  &quot;inapplicable especially 'where the very representations relied on induced\r\n  the hearer to refrain [from] an examination of the records, where the\r\n  employment of an expert would have been required to deduce the truth from an\r\n  examination of the records, where confidential relations existed, or where the\r\n  defrauded party was inexperienced.'&quot; Â 364 S.C. at 277 n.12, 612 S.E.2d at\r\n  733 n.12 (quoting Reid v. Harbison Dev. Corp., 285 S.C. 557, 561, 330\r\n  S.E.2d 532, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1985)). Â The circuit court determined the Moseleys\r\n  were induced to buy Lot 45 without conducting an independent survey of the\r\n  property because &quot;Hampton told them that they did not need to get another\r\n  survey or plat as their lot was the last to be bought in the neighborhood,&quot;\r\n  and &quot;convinced them by drawing a home on the plat and offering to build it\r\n  for them.&quot; The circuit court found All Things Possible vicariously\r\n  liable for Hampton's fraud.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRelying on LoPresti, All Things Possible and Hampton argue the\r\n  Moseleys had constructive notice of the easement. Â In LoPresti, this\r\n  court held homeowners had constructive notice of a flood easement,\r\n  notwithstanding the removal of a dotted line on a recorded plat showing the\r\n  flood plain level, because the easement was properly recorded in the chain of\r\n  title. 364 S.C. at 275, 612 S.E.2d at 732. Â Here, All Things Possible and\r\n  Hampton contend the easement across Lot 45 was created by a plat which was\r\n  approved by the Lexington County Planning Commission and recorded in the public\r\n  record.Â  The Moseleys argue they were not defrauded by documents recorded in\r\n  the chain of title but were directly defrauded by All Things Possible and\r\n  Hampton when they were given an altered plat by Whitehead. Â The Moseleys\r\n  contend they justifiably relied on the plat when deciding to buy Lot 45. Â They\r\n  argue they were unaware of the easement and did everything reasonable to safeguard\r\n  their interests. Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Slack v. James, 364 S.C. 609, 615, 614 S.E.2d 636, 639&nbsp;(2005),\r\n  our supreme court determined a question of fact existed as to whether a buyer's\r\n  reliance on a seller's misrepresentation was reasonable although the falsity of\r\n  the misrepresentation could have been discovered through an examination of the\r\n  public record. Â Here, although the misrepresentation made to the Moseleys could\r\n  have been discovered through an examination of the public records, we find evidence\r\n  in the record supports the circuit court's determination that the Moseleys did\r\n  everything reasonable to inspect and obtain information concerning the\r\n  property.Â  The Moseleys hired an attorney, conducted a title search, and obtained\r\n  a plat from Whitehead. Â The Moseleys were also induced to purchase Lot 45\r\n  without obtaining an independent survey of the property after Whitehead, acting\r\n  as an agent of All Things Possible, provided them with the falsified plat. Â While\r\n  the circuit court determined Hampton was the seller of Lot 45 and that he personally\r\n  provided the falsified plat to the Moseleys, Lot 45 was actually owned by All\r\n  Things Possible. Additionally, the representations made concerning the property\r\n  were made by Whitehead, not Hampton. Â Thus, we find there was evidence in the\r\n  record to support the circuit court's determination that All Things Possible\r\n  committed fraud, and we affirm the circuit court.Â \r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp; James H. Hampton\r\n  \r\nThe Appellants also argue the circuit court erred in finding Hampton personally\r\n  committed fraud by clear and convincing evidence.Â  We agree.Â  &quot;An officer,\r\n  director, or controlling person in a corporation is not, merely as a result of\r\n  his or her status as such, personally liable for the torts of the corporation.&quot;Â  Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 369, 468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996). Â &quot;To\r\n  incur liability, the officer, director, or controlling person must ordinarily\r\n  be shown to have in some way participated in or directed the tortious act.&quot;Â  Id. Â Here, there was no evidence Hampton personally committed fraud. Â Lot\r\n  45 was owned by All Things Possible, not Hampton. Â Whitehead, acting as an\r\n  agent of All Things Possible, provided the Moseleys with the falsified plat. There\r\n  was no evidence Hampton faxed the falsified plat to Whitehead. Â All\r\n  representations made to the Moseleys concerning Lot 45 were made by Whitehead. Accordingly,\r\n  we reverse the circuit court's determination that Hampton committed fraud.Â Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  We\r\n  affirm the circuit court's determination that All Things Possible committed\r\n  fraud, and we reverse the circuit court's determination that James Hampton committed\r\n  fraud. Accordingly, the circuit court's order is\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  AFFIRMED IN PART AND\r\n  REVERSED IN PART.Â  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  WILLIAMS and PIEPER, J.J.,\r\n  concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4678","title":"Carroll v.

Porter, and Assistant General Counsel Linda A. Grice, all of\r\n  Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David Carroll appeals an Administrative\r\n  Law Court (ALC) order affirming his license suspension for registering an\r\n  alcohol concentration of 0.15% or greater.Â  Carroll argues the ALC erred in finding he was not\r\n  prejudiced by the arresting officer's failure to advise him of his implied\r\n  consent rights in writing as required by section 56-5-2950(B) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  We\r\n  affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  May 28, 2007, State Trooper Lance Corporal Stack received a &quot;BOLO&quot;\r\n  (be on the lookout) alert for a grey-colored vehicle reportedly &quot;all over\r\n  the road.&quot;Â  Trooper Stack was approaching a vehicle stopped on the\r\n  shoulder of the road matching the description in the BOLO when the vehicle\r\n  suddenly made a U-turn across two lanes of traffic to travel in the opposite\r\n  direction. Â Trooper Stack turned on his blue lights and pulled the vehicle\r\n  over.Â  After noticing a strong odor of alcohol in the vehicle, he asked the\r\n  driver, Carroll, to step out.Â  Carroll's speech was slurred, and he seemed\r\n  unsteady on his feet.Â  Trooper Stack searched the vehicle and located an open\r\n  container in the vehicle.Â  He advised Carroll of his Miranda rights,[1] and Carroll stated he understood everything.Â  \r\nAnother\r\n  State Trooper, Lance Corporal Chance, arrived on the scene and advised Carroll\r\n  that he was being videotaped and audio recorded.Â  Trooper Chance informed\r\n  Carroll he could refuse to take the field sobriety tests.Â  He administered\r\n  three standard field sobriety tests, all of which Carroll failed.Â  Trooper\r\n  Stack placed Carroll under arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) and transported\r\n  Carroll to the Orangeburg County Law Enforcement Complex for a DataMaster blood\r\n  alcohol concentration test (BAC test).Â  \r\nTrooper\r\n  Stack verbally advised Carroll of his implied consent rights by reading the\r\n  advisement form to him.Â  He checked Carroll's mouth for any foreign material\r\n  and then waited the requisite twenty minutes before performing the BAC test.Â \r\n  Carroll was undecided about whether to take the test or refuse it during the\r\n  twenty minute waiting period.Â  Trooper Stack asked Carroll to stand up and blow\r\n  into the DataMaster machine and Carroll complied, after which he proceeded to\r\n  perform three separate BAC tests.Â  The first and second tests showed\r\n  interference, but the third BAC test registered a blood alcohol level of\r\n  0.25%.Â  Trooper Stack did not give Carroll his implied consent warning in\r\n  writing until after all three tests were completed.Â  Carroll signed the\r\n  advisement of rights, along with his driver's license suspension, and copies of\r\n  the BAC test reports.Â  Â Â \r\nCarroll\r\n  requested an administrative hearing pursuant to section 56-5-2951(B)(2) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  During the hearing, Carroll stated he did\r\n  not understand anything about the BAC testing process, and he &quot;most likely\r\n  would have refused&quot; the BAC test if he had seen his implied consent rights\r\n  in writing.Â  However, on cross-examination, Carroll admitted he recalled\r\n  informing Trooper Stack that he understood the verbal advisement of his implied\r\n  consent rights.Â  Carroll later explained that while he remembered telling\r\n  Trooper Stack he understood, he did not truly understand the advisement of\r\n  rights, and he was only agreeing with Trooper Stack at the time out of respect\r\n  for Trooper Stack's rank.\r\nAfter\r\n  the hearing, the Department of Motor Vehicles (the Department) sustained\r\n  Carroll's driver's license suspension, finding the BAC tests were administered\r\n  in compliance with the implied consent statute.Â  Carroll appealed, and the ALC\r\n  affirmed the Department's decision.Â  The ALC's order noted Carroll testified he\r\n  understood his implied consent rights prior to testing, and Carroll subsequently\r\n  signed a copy of the implied consent advisement of rights form.Â  The ALC\r\n  concluded Carroll was not prejudiced by the lack of written notice prior to\r\n  testing.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellate\r\n  review of an ALC order must be confined to the record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009).Â  This court may not substitute its judgment for that\r\n  of the ALC as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Â Id.Â \r\n  This court may affirm the decision, remand the case for further proceedings, or\r\n  &quot;reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the\r\n  petitioner have been prejudiced . . . .&quot;Â  Id.Â  The petitioner\r\n  suffers prejudice when the ALC's finding, conclusion, or decision is:\r\n\r\n\t(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n  provisions; \r\n\t(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the\r\n  agency; \r\n\t(c) made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d) affected by other error of law; \r\n\t(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n\t(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse\r\n  of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\r\nId.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCarroll argues the ALC erred in affirming his license suspicion based\r\n  upon its determination that Carroll was not prejudiced by Trooper Stack's\r\n  failure to advise Carroll of his implied consent rights in writing as required\r\n  by section 56-5-2950(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina's Legislature has adopted an implied consent\r\n  statute that provides:\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n  tests may be administered or samples obtained unless . . . prior to the commencement of the testing\r\n  procedure, the person has been given a written copy of and verbally informed\r\n    that:\r\n\t(1) he does not have to take the test or give the\r\n  samples, but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at\r\n  least six months if he refuses to submit to the test and that his refusal may\r\n  be used against him in court; \r\n\t(2) his privilege to drive must be suspended for at\r\n  least one month if he takes the test or gives the samples and has an alcohol\r\n  concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more; \r\n\t(3) he has the right to have a qualified person of his\r\n  own choosing conduct additional independent tests at his expense; \r\n\t(4) he has the right to request an administrative\r\n  hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and \r\n\t\r\n\t(5) if he does not request an administrative hearing\r\n  or if his suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must enroll in\r\n  an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program. \r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(B) (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).Â  Additionally, section\r\n  56-5-2950(J) provides that the failure to follow policies or procedures set\r\n  forth in section 56-5-2950 will result in the exclusion from evidence of any\r\n  tests results, &quot;if the trial judge or hearing\r\n  officer finds that this failure materially affected the accuracy or reliability\r\n  of the test results or the fairness of the testing procedure . . . .&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(J) (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nOur\r\n  court examined a violation of the implied consent statute's &quot;in\r\n  writing&quot; requirement in Taylor v. South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles,\r\n  368 S.C. 33, 627 S.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 2006) (Taylor I).Â  Taylor heard\r\n  his implied consent rights but neither read nor signed the implied consent form.Â  Id. at 35, 627 S.E.2d at 752.Â  This court noted Taylor needed to\r\n  demonstrate both a violation of the implied consent statute and prejudice in\r\n  order to warrant relief.Â  Id. at 38, 627 S.E.2d at 754.Â  We held Taylor\r\n  was not prejudiced because &quot;Taylor does not argue that he did not receive\r\n  the implied consent rights, or that he would have provided a blood test if he\r\n  had received the implied consent rights in writing.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nTaylor\r\n  appealed this court's decision to the South Carolina Supreme Court, which\r\n  affirmed in Taylor v. South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, 382\r\n  S.C. 567, 677 S.E.2d 588 (2009) (Taylor II).[2]Â \r\n  Our Supreme Court found nothing in the implied consent statute mandated\r\n  re-issuance of a license for lack of procedural compliance with the statute.Â  Id. at 569-70, 677 S.E.2d at 590.Â  The Supreme Court noted the remedy provided in\r\n  the implied consent statute for any lack of procedural compliance is exclusion of\r\n  the test results from evidence, and not reissuance of an individual's driver's\r\n  license.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme Court then looked to section 56-5-2951 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009), the statute authorizing the Department to\r\n  suspend a driver's license, and similarly concluded nothing in that statute\r\n  mandates reissuance of a driver's license upon failure to procedurally comply\r\n  with section 56-5-2950.Â  Id. at 570-71, 677 S.E.2d at 590.Â  Section\r\n  56-5-2951(F) provides:\r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  administrative hearing must be held after the request for the hearing is\r\n  received by the Division of Motor Vehicle Hearings. The scope of the hearing is\r\n  limited to whether the person:\r\n\t(1) was lawfully arrested or detained;\r\n\t(2) was given a written copy of and verbally informed\r\n  of the rights enumerated in [s]ection 56-5-2950; \r\n\t(3) refused to submit to a test pursuant to [s]ection\r\n  56-5-2950; or \r\n\t(4) consented to taking a test pursuant to [s]ection\r\n  56-5-2950, and [several conditions relating to the administration of the test].\r\n\r\nThus,\r\n  our Supreme Court held the &quot;in writing&quot; requirement was merely one of\r\n  four factors to examine &quot;with an eye toward prejudice&quot; pursuant to section\r\n  56-5-2951(F). Â Taylor II, 382 S.C. at 571, 677 S.E.2d at 590.Â  They\r\n  further noted &quot;[i]f the Legislature had intended the lack of written\r\n  notice (or any other factor) to be a fatal defect, it could have said so in the\r\n  statute.&quot; Â Id. at 570, 677 S.E.2d at 590 (citation omitted).Â  The Supreme\r\n  Court found this court &quot;properly applied a prejudice analysis&quot; and correctly\r\n  found no prejudice resulted from the lack of written notice when Taylor was verbally\r\n  advised of the implied consent warning.Â  Id. at 571, 677 S.E.2d at 590. \r\nWe\r\n  believe the case sub judice is distinguishable from Taylor I.Â \r\n  Unlike Taylor, Carroll testified he likely would have refused the BAC test had\r\n  he received his implied consent rights in writing, as required by section 56-5-2950(B).Â \r\n  However, we defer to the ALC's factual findings regarding whether Carroll verbally\r\n  received and understood his implied consent rights prior to testing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009).Â  We believe substantial evidence\r\n  supported the ALC's conclusion that Carroll was not prejudiced by the lack of\r\n  written notice.Â  See id.Â  Furthermore, we are bound by our Supreme\r\n  Court's holding in Taylor II, suggesting no prejudice resulted from the\r\n  lack of written notice when an individual was verbally advised of his or her\r\n  implied consent rights. Â See Taylor II, 382 S.C. at 571, 677\r\n  S.E.2d at 590 (&quot;Given that it is undisputed Taylor was advised of the\r\n  implied consent warning, the Court of Appeals properly found he suffered no\r\n  prejudice from the officer's lack of written notice.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we affirm the ALC's decision affirming Carroll's license suspension.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Miranda v.

Bryan, of Surfside Beach, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Anderson Ocean Club Development, LLC\r\n  (Seller) appeals\r\n  the trial court's decision denying a motion to compel arbitration.Â  We affirm. \r\nÂ Â FACTS\r\nAdel Faltaous and Mona Faltaous (collectively, Buyers) signed a\r\n  preconstruction contract, in which they agreed to purchase a condominium\r\n  building from Seller for a price of $710,000.Â  Seller agreed to construct the building\r\n  in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  The contract required Buyers to pay $106,500\r\n  in earnest-money deposit, which they did.Â  \r\nAfter the building was substantially complete, Buyers visited the\r\n  property and first learned that parking for the condominium building was not\r\n  onsite but rather, was located two streets behind the condominium.Â  Upon\r\n  learning this, Buyers requested they be refunded their earnest-money deposit.Â \r\n  Seller refused this request, and Buyers filed a lawsuit.Â  In their complaint,\r\n  Buyers asserted causes of actions for breach of contract, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices.Â  The complaint was later amended\r\n  to add a cause of action based upon a violation of the Interstate Land Sales\r\n  Full Disclosure Act.Â  \r\nSeller counterclaimed and sought specific performance to require\r\n  Buyers to close the purchase, damages based on breach of contract, and a declaratory\r\n  judgment.Â  Additionally, Seller filed a motion to compel arbitration based on\r\n  the arbitration clause in the contract.Â  The trial court issued an order denying\r\n  the motion, finding the dispute between the parties did not come within the\r\n  scope of the arbitration clause.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeterminations\r\n  of arbitrability are subject to de novo review.Â  MBNA Am. Bank v.\r\n    Christianson, 377 S.C. 210, 213, 659 S.E.2d 209, 211 (Ct. App. 2008).Â Â  However,\r\n  a circuit court's factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any\r\n  evidence reasonably supports the findings.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSeller argues the trial court erred in concluding the dispute did\r\n  not come within the scope of the arbitration clause.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnless the parties provide otherwise, the question of the\r\n  arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination.Â  Zabinski\r\n    v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596-97, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118-19\r\n  (2001).Â  The policy of this State is to favor arbitration of disputes.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Arbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required to submit\r\n  to arbitration any dispute that he or she has not agreed to submit.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Because arbitration rests on the agreement of the parties, the\r\n  range of issues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of the\r\n  agreement.Â  Id.\r\nTo decide whether an arbitration agreement\r\n  encompasses a dispute, we must determine whether the factual allegations\r\n  underlying the claim are within the scope of the arbitration clause, regardless\r\n  of the label assigned to the claim.Â  Id.Â  However, any doubts concerning\r\n  the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Additionally, unless we can say with positive assurance the arbitration clause\r\n  is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration\r\n  should be ordered.Â  Id.\r\nThe first page of the contract includes the following: &quot;THIS\r\n  AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING AND IRREVOCABLE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL\r\n  DISPUTES AND CLAIMS PURSUANT TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA UNIFORM ARBITRATION ACT\r\n  FOUND AT CODE SECTION 15-48-10, ET. SEQ.&quot;Â  Additionally, paragraph\r\n  19 of the contract states: \r\n\r\n\tARBITRATION AGREEMENT:\r\n  Any and all claims, disputes, demands, actions and causes of action of every\r\n  nature and kind which arise out of or are in any manner whatsoever related to\r\n  the development, design, construction, condition, merchantability,\r\n  habitability, fitness for a particular purpose or any other implied or express\r\n  warranty for the common elements of or the individual units at the [condominium] that are asserted against\r\n  Seller, the architect or contractor for the Project, and their respective\r\n  agents, employees, owners, officers, subcontractors, consultants, successors or\r\n  assigns by any entity formed to serve as the Regime's Homeowners' Association\r\n  or by any person or entity which now has or hereafter acquires any interest in\r\n  a unit at the [condominium] shall be subject to and resolved by final and\r\n  binding arbitration conducted in Horry County, South Carolina pursuant to the\r\n  terms of the South Carolina Arbitration Act found at South Carolina Code\r\n  Section 15-48-10, et. Seq.Â  \r\n\r\nBuyers sued for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation,\r\n  unfair trade practices, and a violation of the Interstate Land Sales Full\r\n  Disclosure Act.Â  Seller counterclaimed for declaratory judgment, breach of\r\n  contract, and specific performance.Â  Even if we assume Buyers' claims fall\r\n  within the arbitration clause, Seller's counterclaims do not. \r\nSeller sought specific performance requiring Buyers to close the\r\n  purchase and argued it was entitled to Buyers' earnest-money deposit.Â  As\r\n  counsel for Seller acknowledged during oral arguments, neither of these claims\r\n  fall within the purview of the arbitration clause.Â  \r\nThe introductory words to the arbitration clause are broad, stating\r\n  &quot;[a]ny and all claims.&quot;Â  However, following these words, the clause\r\n  is drawn specifically and limits the matters that can be arbitrated to disputes\r\n  that result &quot;from the\r\n  development, design, construction, condition, merchantability, habitability,\r\n  fitness for a particular purpose or any other implied or express warranty for\r\n  the common elements of or the individual units at the [condominium]. . . .&quot;Â  Disputes that\r\n  arise out of the contract itself, as Seller's counterclaims do, are absent from\r\n  the arbitration clause's reach.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly\r\n  denied Seller's motion to\r\n  compel arbitration.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4680","title":"State v.

Brown, all of Columbia; Solicitor John\r\n  Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: In this criminal matter, Luther Garner\r\n  (Appellant) was convicted of murder, first-degree burglary, and attempted armed\r\n  robbery, stemming from an incident at the home of Amadro Flores Espinozat (Victim).Â \r\n  The State's key eyewitness was Lonya Sowdon.Â  Appellant now appeals three\r\n  evidentiary rulings of the trial court as to various parts of Sowdon's\r\n  testimony. Â We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 11, 2005, authorities found Victim\r\n  deceased in his home.Â  Investigators determined Victim was severely beaten in\r\n  the living room and subsequently dragged down the hallway, where he was left to\r\n  die.Â  The scene yielded one bloody shoe print, a bloody handprint, and a single\r\n  bullet hole and casing from a .22 caliber bullet. \r\nThe\r\n  same day, detective Oz Santiago interviewed Victim's housemates, Jonas and Rene\r\n  Trujillo (collectively the Trujillos).Â  Among other standard information, the\r\n  housemates told him Victim was alive when they left for work on the morning of\r\n  December 11.Â  At trial, Appellant attempted to introduce Santiago's testimony\r\n  that the housemates stated Victim was alive the morning of December 11.Â  However,\r\n  the State objected and the trial court ruled because the Trujillos were not\r\n  available for cross-examination, the testimony was inadmissible hearsay.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State offered the testimony of Sowdon to establish that on or around\r\n  December 10 or 11, 2005, Appellant, Sowdon, and Lee Pierce went to Victim's\r\n  home.Â  Sowdon testified she went in the home shortly after Appellant and Pierce\r\n  and found Appellant had already beaten Victim quite badly.Â  She testified that\r\n  Appellant was &quot;hollering at [Victim] wanting . . . money and cocaine . . .\r\n  but [Victim] could not understand English.&quot; Â Appellant allegedly\r\n  dragged Victim down the hallway, while continuing to beat him with the butt of\r\n  a pistol. Â Meanwhile, Pierce was in the back of the house looking for money and\r\n  cocaine. Â Unable to find money or drugs, Sowdon testified the trio left\r\n  and proceeded to Summer Wind Drive to dispose of one of the pistols and then\r\n  traveled to the home of Paul Graham so Appellant could change his bloody\r\n  clothes.Â  \r\nSowdon testified that she remained high\r\n  on crack cocaine for the remainder of the day of the murder and possibly up to\r\n  two days following.Â  When she &quot;came down&quot; on the afternoon of\r\n  December 12, 2005, she realized the magnitude of what had occurred and called\r\n  911.Â  The trial court admitted the recording of this call based on Sowdon's identification\r\n  of her own voice.Â  Appellant objected to the introduction of the tape through Sowdon\r\n  rather than the 911 representative.Â  \r\nA jury found Appellant guilty of murder,\r\n  first-degree burglary, and attempted armed robbery.Â  The trial court sentenced him\r\n  to forty years' imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in preventing Santiago from \r\n\t\t\ttestifying as to the Trujillos'\r\n  statement of seeing Victim alive on the morning of December 11, 2005?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in admitting the recording \r\n\t\t\tof Sowdon's 911 call?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in allowing certain \r\n\t\t\tportions of Sowdon's testimony when\r\n  Appellant alleged it was inadmissible hearsay?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  Evidentiary\r\n  rulings are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and such rulings\r\n  will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal\r\n  error that prejudices the defendant.Â  State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 314,\r\n  652 S.E.2d 409, 415 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The trial court abuses its discretion\r\n  when the ruling is based on an error of law or factual conclusion that is\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  Id. at 315, 652 S.E.2d at 415.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Suppression\r\n  of the Trujillos' Statement\r\nAppellant contends the Trujillos' statement\r\n  to Santiago that Victim was alive the morning of December 11, 2005, is\r\n  &quot;relevant and admissible, non-testimonial, non-hearsay.&quot;Â  We disagree.\r\nIn this case, Appellant attempted to\r\n  introduce the evidence through Santiago, arguing &quot;it's admissible . . .\r\n  [as] non-testimonial evidence under State v. L[a]dner.&quot;Â  The trial\r\n  court ruled the evidence inadmissible hearsay.Â  Because Appellant made no\r\n  argument the statement was either admissible as non-hearsay or admissible as hearsay\r\n  under the excited utterance exception, both of which he now argues on appeal,\r\n  the only issue before this court is whether the evidence is admissible as an\r\n  alleged non-testimonial statement.Â  See S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907\r\n  (2007) (stating in order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge); Knight v.\r\n    Waggoner,\r\n  359 S.C. 492, 496, 597 S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 2004) (indicating arguments raised\r\n  for the first time on appeal are not preserved for our review).Â  \r\nOn this issue, Appellant's argument is\r\n  premised on the notion that non-testimonial evidence is admissible as a matter\r\n  of course.Â  However, we find the distinction between testimonial and\r\n  non-testimonial hearsay is significant only in the context of determining\r\n  whether there has been a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause violation.Â  The\r\n  Supreme Court has held testimonial hearsay against a defendant violates the\r\n  Confrontation Clause if (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial\r\n  and (2) the accused has had no prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.Â  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 54 (2004).Â  Similarly, the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court has recognized the Sixth Amendment is not implicated by\r\n  non-testimonial hearsay.Â  See State v. Ladner, 373 S.C. 103, 113,\r\n  644 S.E.2d 684, 689 (2007) (noting &quot;the Sixth Amendment simply has no\r\n  application outside the scope of testimonial hearsay&quot;).Â  However, the fact\r\n  that the Sixth Amendment is not implicated by non-testimonial hearsay does not mandate\r\n  the evidence be admitted. Â See id. at 111, 644 S.E.2d at 688\r\n  (indicating the rule in this regard to be: the admission of admissible hearsay\r\n  violates the Sixth Amendment when such evidence is testimonial in nature).Â  \r\nThe Crawford court indicates &quot;that not all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment[].&quot;\r\n  Â Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51.Â  If a statement is admissible hearsay, the\r\n  Confrontation Clause may operate to render this otherwise admissible hearsay\r\n  inadmissible if testimonial in nature.Â  See id. at 68 (stating\r\n  that testimonial evidence implicates the Sixth Amendment and the admission of\r\n  non-testimonial evidence remains the province of each state's rules of evidence).Â \r\n  However, this does not imply the inverse; that otherwise inadmissible hearsay\r\n  becomes admissible if non-testimonial in nature.Â Â  See Rules 801 to 806,\r\n  SCRE (providing no support for excluding non-testimonial evidence from the\r\n  definition of hearsay or excluding non-testimonial evidence from the\r\n  prohibition against hearsay).Â  Rather, if evidence is deemed inadmissible\r\n  hearsay, the inquiry is concluded and a determination of whether such evidence\r\n  is testimonial or non-testimonial is irrelevant.Â  Thus, Appellant's argument is\r\n  without merit.[1]Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; The\r\n  911 Tape\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred\r\n  in allowing the 911 tape into evidence through Sowdon rather than a 911\r\n  representative.Â  We find this allegation of error to be abandoned.Â  \r\nTo this issue, Appellant's argument\r\n  states in total: &quot;Counsel for [A]ppellant argued that it was improper to\r\n  allow the 911 tape to be admitted through Lonya as opposed to an appropriate\r\n  911 representative.&quot;Â  Accordingly, this issue is abandoned on appeal.Â  See State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 58, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (stating an\r\n  argument is deemed abandoned on appeal when conclusory and without supporting\r\n  authority). \r\nIII.&nbsp; Sowdon's\r\n  testimonyÂ  \r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred\r\n  in admitting certain hearsay statements through Sowdon.Â Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;[I]mproper admission of hearsay\r\n  testimony constitutes reversible error only when the admission causes\r\n  prejudice.&quot;Â  State v. Vick, 384 S.C. 189, 199, 682 S.E.2d 275, 280\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009).Â  Such error is deemed harmless when it could not have\r\n  reasonably affected the result of the trial, and an appellate court will not\r\n  set aside a conviction for such insubstantial errors.Â  Id.Â  An insubstantial\r\n  error is harmless when guilt is proven by competent evidence such that no other\r\n  rational decision could be reached or when the evidence is merely cumulative of\r\n  other evidence.Â  Id. at 199-200, 682 S.E.2d at 280.Â  \r\nAt trial, Appellant objected to a\r\n  portion of Sowdon's testimony regarding the events that transpired at Graham's\r\n  house, specifically objecting in anticipation of Sowdon testifying to a hearsay\r\n  statement made by Graham.Â  On appeal, Appellant alleges that the trial court\r\n  erred in allowing Sowdon to bolster and corroborate her own testimony through\r\n  the repetition of these inadmissible hearsay statements.Â  Â Â \r\nNotwithstanding that the record does not\r\n  demonstrate any of Graham's hearsay statements were actually admitted, we fail\r\n  to find, and Appellant fails to bring to our attention, any prejudice caused by\r\n  the alleged bolstering and corroboration of Sowdon's testimony.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Furthermore,\r\n  we note the record indicates Dr. Proctor specifically testified that his\r\n  medical opinion was that Victim died on December 11, 2005.Â  Thus, the evidence\r\n  Appellant attempted to introduce through Santiago was introduced through Dr.\r\n  Proctor.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
