Â Knox subsequently underwent surgery and received pain management \r\n  treatment.\r\nThe Knoxes initiated the present action on May \r\n  8, 2002.Â  The Hospital answered and subsequently moved for summary judgment \r\n  on the ground that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred the \r\n  Knoxesâ€™ claims. The Knoxes responded by submitting a memorandum opposing the \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s summary judgment motion. [3] \r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment to the \r\n  Hospital, ruling that both â€œPlaintiffsâ€™ claims are barred by the applicable \r\n  statute of limitations.â€Â  The court noted that Knoxâ€”who had received â€œplenty \r\n  of I.V.s beforeâ€ without incident, and experienced admittedly abnormal pain, \r\n  coupled with the uncharacteristic hand movement, when the nurse inserted the \r\n  needle in his wrist on May 2, 2000â€”â€œwas on notice that a claim against another \r\n  party might exist.â€Â  The court consequently found that the applicable two-year \r\n  statute of limitations began running on that date, May 2, 2000, and had expired \r\n  prior to the filing of the complaint on May 8, 2002.Â  This appeal followed the \r\n  denial of a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion for summary judgment shall be granted \r\n  â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on \r\n  file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue \r\n  as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., \r\n  353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334 (2003).Â  On a summary judgment motion, \r\n  â€œa court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  \r\n  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nKnox argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding he should have reasonably discovered the existence of a potential \r\n  claim on May 2, 2000, because he did not know the extent of his injury until \r\n  the July 26, 2000, diagnosis by the orthopedic surgeon.Â  As a result, Knox contends \r\n  the circuit court erred in barring his medical malpractice claim under the applicable \r\n  two-year statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Hospital is a governmental \r\n  entity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Under the Act, an action is â€œforever barred unless . . . commenced \r\n  within two years after the date the loss was or should have been discovered \r\n  . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. 2003).\r\nActions brought under the Act \r\n  are subject to the discovery rule.Â  Joubert v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\n  Services, 341 S.C. 176, 190, 534 S.E.2d 1, 8 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œAccording \r\n  to the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a cause \r\n  of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.â€Â  Id.Â  The statute \r\n  does not necessarily run from the date of the negligent act, but from when the \r\n  injury resulting from the negligent act is discovered or may be discovered by \r\n  the exercise of â€œreasonable diligence.â€Â  Id., 341 S.C. at 8, 534 S.E.2d \r\n  at 190-91.Â  â€œThe exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an injured \r\n  party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an \r\n  injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that \r\n  some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party \r\n  might exist.â€Â  Snell v. Columbia Gun Exch., Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 303, \r\n  278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981).Â  â€œThe date on which discovery should have been made \r\n  is an objective, not subjective, question.â€Â  Joubert, 341 S.C. at 191, \r\n  534 S.E.2d at 9.Â  Additionally, the fact that the injured party does not comprehend \r\n  the full extent of his injuries is immaterial.Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., \r\n  321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).\r\nHere, Knox argues he did not \r\n  discover that he had a cause of action until his orthopedic surgeon informed \r\n  him of the true nature of his injury on July 26, 2000.Â  Thus, Knox maintains \r\n  the two-year statute of limitations did not start running until that date and \r\n  did not expire until July 26, 2002, well after he filed suit on May 8, 2002. \r\n  We find this argument unavailing under the facts of this case.Â  \r\nIn particular, we note that Knox \r\n  acknowledged that he â€œscreamed,â€ â€œsquealed,â€ and â€œholleredâ€ from pain when the \r\n  I.V. was injected in his wrist, and his fingers â€œthrewâ€ and his hand â€œjumped.â€Â  \r\n  He testified that the nurse who administered the I.V. apologized and told Knox \r\n  she â€œhad hit the wrong thing in there.â€Â  Knox testified she also said: â€œIt must \r\n  have been a nerve.â€Â  He stated he previously had many other I.V.s. and knew \r\n  something was different about this one because â€œthat hand felt like my whole \r\n  hand jumped straight up like that.Â  But she know [sic] she had hit something \r\n  wrong in there.â€Â  Before he was discharged, Knox told relatives he was experiencing \r\n  pain, and the â€œdoctorâ€ had hit a nerve. Â When he left the emergency room, Knox \r\n  knew he had experienced pain upon injection, that the pain was not a normal \r\n  consequence of an I.V. administration, that the nurse had hit a nerve, and that \r\n  the nerve was the â€œwrong thingâ€ to hit.\r\nWe, of course, recognize that \r\n  varying degrees of pain and discomfort are frequently associated with certain \r\n  medical procedures, especially invasive ones.Â  The mere presence of pain or \r\n  discomfort, to be sure, will ordinarily not serve to trigger the commencement \r\n  of the applicable statute of limitations.Â  The distinctive feature here is Knoxâ€™s \r\n  multiple, uneventful experiences with â€œplenty of I.V.s before.â€Â  The exercise \r\n  of reasonable diligence under these facts â€œwould put a person of common knowledge \r\n  and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some \r\n  claim against [the Hospital] might exist.â€Â  Snell, 276 S.C. at 303, 278 \r\n  S.E.2d at 334. \r\nViewing this evidence objectively \r\n  and in the light most favorable to Knox, we find the circuit court correctly \r\n  concluded that the â€œloss â€¦ should have been discoveredâ€ on May 2, 2000, and \r\n  consequently Knox was on notice at that time of a potential claim against the \r\n  Hospital.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110.Â  Additionally, we find it immaterial \r\n  that Knox did not know the extent of his injury on May 2, 2000.Â  See \r\n  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 720, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[T]he statute of limitations is not tolled during \r\n  the period of time in which a plaintiff is merely unaware of the extent of an \r\n  actionable injury.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that a reasonably diligent \r\n  person of common knowledge and experience, under the admitted facts, would have \r\n  been aware at the time of the incident on May 2, 2000, that a claim against \r\n  the Hospital might exist, even though the full extent of the injury was only \r\n  subsequently discovered.Â  Thus, we conclude that the two-year statute of limitations \r\n  period began to run on May 2, 2000.Â  Because the complaint was not filed until \r\n  May 8, 2002, we find no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether \r\n  the two-year statute of limitations bars this action.Â  The grant of summary \r\n  judgment to the Hospital is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] We refer only to Mr. Knoxâ€™s claim, recognizing as the parties \r\n    do that the viability of Mrs. Knoxâ€™s consortium claim is contingent upon the \r\n    timeliness of Mr. Knoxâ€™s claim.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] The record indicates a nurse administered \r\n    the I.V., but Knox refers to the person who administered the I.V. as a â€œdoctor.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3] In their memorandum, the Knoxes only challenged the \r\n    statute of limitations defense with respect to Mr. Knoxâ€™s claim.Â  They did \r\n    not dispute the Hospitalâ€™s assertion that if the statute barred Mr. Knoxâ€™s \r\n    claim, it would also necessarily bar Mrs. Knoxâ€™s claim for loss of consortium.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3915","title":"Parker v.

Parker brought suit \r\n  against David Michael Pace and his employer, the Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer \r\n  District (the Sewer District), alleging Paceâ€™s negligence proximately caused \r\n  an automobile accident in which she suffered injuries.Â  The trial judge dismissed \r\n  Pace from the suit pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Tort \r\n  Claims Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to â€“200 (Supp. 2003).Â  The jury returned \r\n  a $450,000 verdict against the Sewer District.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in \r\n  part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nParker and Pace were involved in an automobile \r\n  accident in which Parker suffered injuries.Â  At the time, Pace was driving a \r\n  van owned by the Sewer District.Â  Parker filed a complaint against Pace and \r\n  the Sewer District averring Paceâ€™s negligence was the direct and proximate cause \r\n  of her injuries.Â  Parker claimed that, because Pace was acting as an employee \r\n  of the Sewer District when the accident occurred, Paceâ€™s liability was imputed \r\n  to the Sewer District.Â  In her complaint, Parker stated: â€œThis action as to \r\n  Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District is brought under section 15-78-40 et seq., \r\n  S.C. Code of Laws, the â€˜S.C. Tort Claims Act.â€™â€Â  The Sewer District did not \r\n  plead the Tort Claims Act as an affirmative defense in its answer.\r\nOn the morning of the first day of trial, \r\n  the Sewer District filed an amended answer, which asserted:\r\n\r\nThe Defendants would show the Court that since Defendant Pace \r\n  was acting within the scope of his employment with the Spartanburg Sanitary \r\n  Sewer District at the time of the accident complained of and since this action \r\n  was brought (as to the Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District) under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act, . . . the Plaintiff is entitled to recover only actual \r\n  damages not to exceed the maximum amount permitted under the applicable provisions \r\n  of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial, the circuit judge declared:\r\n\r\nI didnâ€™t see the Amended Answer yesterday.Â  I donâ€™t think \r\n  amended pleadings can be filed without permission of the Court, and particularly \r\n  after the trial has started.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  Well, the Answer I have in the file for this trial, there \r\n  is no defense found.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  You cannot file it without leave of the Court under the Rules.Â  \r\n  I donâ€™t believe you can file an Amended Complaint that late or an Amended Answer, \r\n  without permission of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Sewer District then moved to amend its answer \r\n  to comport with the evidence.Â  The judge denied the motion. \r\nAt trial, the Sewer District made two requests \r\n  to introduce evidence of the amounts actually paid by Medicare for services \r\n  rendered to Parker as a result of the accident.Â  The trial judge denied these \r\n  requests.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Parker \r\n  in the amount of $450,000.Â  The Sewer District moved to reduce the amount of \r\n  damages by $150,000 to reflect the monetary statutory cap on recovery provided \r\n  in the Tort Claims Act.Â  Specifically, the Sewer District asked â€œfor a reduction \r\n  to the amount of the cap as pleaded by Mr. Holland in his Complaint, less the \r\n  property damage already paid to his client.â€Â  The trial judge denied the motion.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI.Â  REDUCTION OF VERDICT\r\nA.Â  Vivacity of Pleading/Accedence at Trial\r\nThe Sewer District argues \r\n  the trial judge erred in denying its request for a reduction in the jury award \r\n  to comply with the limitation on recovery as set forth in the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort \r\n  claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available \r\n  in an action against a governmental entity or its employees.Â  Flateau \r\n  v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 584 \r\n  S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 2003); Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, \r\n  501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998); see also S.C. Code Ann.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Educ., 339 \r\n  S.C. 208, 528 S.E.2d 682 (Ct.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing \r\n  &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999), the issue presented \r\n  on appeal was whether the trial judge erred in denying the defendantâ€™s motion \r\n  for a new trial nisi remittitur, in which it asked the judge to reduce the verdicts \r\n  for the plaintiffs to $250,000 each under the Tort Claims Act.Â  The Supreme \r\n  Court noted the case was filed â€œtwo days before the reinstatement of the limits \r\n  [of the Tort Claims Act].â€Â  Id. at 402, 520 S.E.2d at 157.Â  In addition, \r\n  Steinke examined the various statutory exceptions to the waiver of immunity \r\n  as they related to the defendant.Â  The question of whether the statutory cap \r\n  is an affirmative defense which is waived if not pled was not discussed.Â  Likewise, \r\n  Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 \r\n  (2000), does not analyze the issue presented in this appeal.Â  The defendant \r\n  maintained the verdict should have been reduced to $250,000 in accordance with \r\n  the reenactment of the statutory cap.Â  The Pike court explicated: â€œThe \r\n  instant action was filed on June 23, 1994[, eight days before the reinstatement \r\n  of the limits]. . . . Pursuant to Steinke, the statutory cap simply does \r\n  not apply.â€Â  Id. at 236, 540 S.E.2d at 93.Â  Furthermore, Pike \r\n  addressed applicability of the exception to the waiver of immunity for discretionary \r\n  acts under the Tort Claims Act.Â  This discussion is inapposite to the present \r\n  issue.\r\nAdditionally, the Sewer District did not need to \r\n  plead the Tort Claims Act statutory cap as an affirmative defense in its answer \r\n  because Parker already conceded the Tort Claims Act applied to her claim.Â  Parker \r\n  expressly set forth in her complaint that she brought her cause of action pursuant \r\n  to the Tort Claims Act.Â  Moreover, upon a motion by the Sewer District to dismiss \r\n  Pace as a defendant pursuant to section 15-78-80 of the South Carolina Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003), the trial court and Parkerâ€™s counsel agreed the Tort Claims Act \r\n  applied to this action:\r\n\r\n[Attorney for the Sewer District]: . . . I would submit that \r\n  should you direct a motion to dismiss Mr. Pace, then any charge related to punitive \r\n  damages we would object to as irrelevant, in view of the Tort Claim[s] Act. \r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n[Attorney for Parker]: . . . Of course, the Tort Claims \r\n  Act applies.Â  In this case, we have alleged at the outset of this case â€“ \r\n  have established that this gentlemanâ€™s independent gross negligence brought \r\n  this about.\r\n  That makes his employer responsible under the Tort Claims \r\n  Act, but I donâ€™t know of any structure in the law which shields him from personal \r\n  responsibility.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act is real clear that punitives are not \r\n  recoverable against a State agency or governmental agency under the Tort Claims \r\n  Act, but I donâ€™t know of an umbrella that David Michael Pace is carrying around \r\n  that keeps that rainful [sic] from coming down on him.\r\n  . . . .\r\nThe Court:Â  Iâ€™m not sure that the individual â€“ I know of nothing \r\n  that protects the individual from gross negligence, recklessness or willfulness.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Tort Claims Act would apply to the Sewer \r\n  District in regard to the actual damages.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nSubsequent to this discussion on the record, the \r\n  trial judge stated the Tort Claims Act must be raised as an affirmative defense \r\n  in the answer.Â  However, the judge then granted the Sewer Districtâ€™s motion \r\n  to dismiss Pace pursuant to the Tort Claims Act. [1] Â  The trial judgeâ€™s statement \r\n  that the Tort Claims Act applies to this action and his dismissal of Pace are \r\n  inconsistent with the judgeâ€™s failure to apply the monetary statutory cap set \r\n  out in the Tort Claims Act.Â  Further, Parker is factually and legally bound \r\n  by her pleading and trial concession: (1) she declared in her complaint that \r\n  her cause of action is brought under the Tort Claims Act; and (2) at trial, \r\n  she conceded the Tort Claims Act applies.Â  See Ex parte McMillan, \r\n  319 S.C. 331, 461 S.E.2d 43 (1995) (by conceding at trial that the complaint \r\n  was, in part, under the Tort Claims Act, the party could not argue on appeal \r\n  that the case was not under the Tort Claims Act).\r\nThe trial judge committed reversible error \r\n  in denying the Sewer Districtâ€™s request for a reduction in the juryâ€™s verdict \r\n  to conform to the monetary statutory cap set forth in the Tort Claims Act.\r\nB.Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\nNumerous jurisdictions which have addressed the \r\n  issue conclude the statutory cap on recovery need not be pled.\r\nIn Mitchell v. State of Louisiana, \r\n  596 So. 2d 353 (La. Ct. App. 1992), the plaintiffs, who were injured in an automobile \r\n  accident, sued the State of Louisiana, through the Department of Transportation \r\n  and Development.Â  On appeal, the plaintiffs complained â€œit was error not to \r\n  rule that the state waived the [statutory] cap . . . by its failure to plead \r\n  the cap as an affirmative defense.â€Â  Id. at 354.Â  The court enunciated:\r\n\r\nWhile we are on the subject of the statutory cap, La.R.S. \r\n  13:5106, we will respond to the contention made by the plaintiffs in their answer \r\n  to the appeal, that the state should not have been permitted to avail itself \r\n  of the benefit of this cap because of its failure to plead it as an affirmative \r\n  defense.Â  We find no merit to this argument.Â  The statute does not create an \r\n  affirmative defense; rather, it imposes a limitation on liability.Â  The plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  petition pleaded general damages.Â  The state in its answer denied the allegations.Â  \r\n  The subject of the amount of general damages was thus put at issue in the case.Â  \r\n  The State did not waive its right to invoke the cap by its failure to specifically \r\n  plead reliance on it as a limitation on its liability.\r\n\r\nId. at 357.\r\nThe case of Snyder v. City of Minneapolis, \r\n  441 N.W.2d 781 (Minn. 1989), is particularly instructive.Â  Snyder alleged â€œthe \r\n  limit on municipal liability created by Minn.Stat. Â§ 466.04, [the cap on municipal \r\n  tort liability,] is an affirmative defense and therefore should have been set \r\n  forth affirmatively in the Cityâ€™s responsive pleading.â€Â  Id. at 787 (footnote \r\n  omitted).Â  He averred the City waived the cap on damages because it failed to \r\n  plead or raise it prior to the completion of trial.Â  The Supreme Court of Minnesota \r\n  expounded: â€œWe . . . hold that the cap on municipal tort liability provided \r\n  by Minn.Stat. Â§ 466.04 is not an affirmative defense but a statutory rule of \r\n  law that trial courts are obliged to impose whenever damages exceed the statutory \r\n  limit.â€Â  Id. at 788.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Texas, in Whipple \r\n  v. Deltscheff, 731 S.W.2d 700 (Tex. App. 1987), elucidated: â€œA sovereign \r\n  does not waive the $100,000 limit of liability imposed by the Texas Tort Claims \r\n  Act by failure to plead and urge it; the damages are strictly limited to those \r\n  imposed by the statute.â€Â  Id. at 705; see also Tarrant County \r\n  Hosp. District v. Henry, 52 S.W.3d 434, 451 (Tex. App. 2001) (â€œFurther, \r\n  because a sovereign would have no liability absent legislative consent to suit \r\n  and liability, a sovereign cannot waive the damage limits imposed by the Legislature \r\n  by failing to plead them.â€).\r\nThere is absolutely no verbiage articulated within \r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, sections 15-78-10 to â€“200 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code, mandating that a governmental entity plead the monetary statutory cap \r\n  included within section 15-78-120.Â  The Tort Claims Act is imbued with public \r\n  policy considerations limiting and qualifying liability of governmental entities.Â  \r\n  We conclude that the monetary statutory cap is self-executing and the court \r\n  is required to apply the monetary statutory cap to any jury verdict exceeding \r\n  $300,000.\r\nII.Â  MOTION TO AMEND ANSWER\r\nBecause this court should address all \r\n  issues in the event of certiorari review, we analyze the motion to amend the \r\n  answer on an alternative basis for affirmance.\r\nThe Sewer District maintains the circuit \r\n  judge abused his discretion in refusing an amendment to assert the Tort Claims \r\n  Act limitation on recoverable damages as an affirmative defense.Â  We agree.\r\nAmendments of pleadings are controlled by Rule \r\n  15, SCRCP, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n15(a). Amendments.Â  A party may amend his pleading \r\n  once as a matter of course at any time before or within 30 days after a responsive \r\n  pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading \r\n  is required and the action has not been placed upon the trial roster, he may \r\n  so amend it at any time within 30 days after it is served.Â  Otherwise a party \r\n  may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse \r\n  party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires and does \r\n  not prejudice any other party.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nA motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial judge.Â  Stanley v. Kirkpatrick, 357 S.C. 169, 592 S.E.2d \r\n  296 (2004); City of North Myrtle Beach v. Lewis-Davis, 360 S.C. 225, \r\n  599 S.E.2d 462 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Leave to amend pleadings pursuant to Rule 15, \r\n  SCRCP, shall be liberally and freely given when justice so requires and does \r\n  not prejudice any other party.Â  Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, \r\n  328 S.C. 201, 493 S.E.2d 826 (1997); Pruitt v. Bowers, 330 S.C. 483, \r\n  499 S.E.2d 250 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of \r\n  notice that the new issue is going to be tried, and a lack of opportunity to \r\n  refute it.Â  Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 521 S.E.2d \r\n  153 (1999); Lewis-Davis, 360 S.C. at 232, 599 S.E.2d at 465.Â  The party \r\n  opposing the amendment has the burden of establishing prejudice.Â  Foggie \r\n  v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 431 S.E.2d 587 (1993); Pruitt, \r\n  330 S.C. at 489, 499 S.E.2d at 253.Â  This rule strongly favors amendments and \r\n  the court is encouraged to freely grant leave to amend.Â  Jarrell v. Seaboard \r\n  Sys. R.R., 294 S.C. 183, 363 S.E.2d 398 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nIn the instant case, the trial judge did \r\n  not articulate any finding of prejudice with regard to Parker in denying the \r\n  Sewer Districtâ€™s motion to amend.Â  In addition, statements by Parkerâ€™s counsel \r\n  on the record indicate Parker would not be prejudiced by the Sewer Districtâ€™s \r\n  request to amend.Â  Parkerâ€™s attorney stated: â€œOf course, the Tort Claims Act \r\n  applies.â€Â  When discussing whether Parker consented to the Sewer Districtâ€™s \r\n  request to amend, Parkerâ€™s counsel professed:\r\n\r\nHe sent me a copy over the weekend in the mail . . . . Your \r\n  Honor, I got it and looked at it.Â  I didnâ€™t see anything â€“ we did have a conversation, \r\n  and I didnâ€™t see anything new, so I told [counsel for the Sewer District], frankly, \r\n  in our conversation that I did not have any problem with it at that time.\r\n\r\nParker did not satisfy her burden of establishing \r\n  prejudice.Â  See Pruitt v. Bowers, 330 S.C. 483, 499 S.E.2d 250 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).Â  On the contrary, Parkerâ€™s complaint and her attorneyâ€™s comments \r\n  demonstrated just the opposite.\r\nFurther, the Sewer Districtâ€™s request was not a \r\n  surprise to Parker.Â  Parker specifically pled the application of the Tort Claims \r\n  Act in her complaint.Â  Concomitantly, she was not surprised by the Sewer Districtâ€™s \r\n  request to limit her amount of recovery pursuant to the Act.Â  The circumstances \r\n  surrounding the Sewer Districtâ€™s requests to amend were such that justice would \r\n  be furthered by allowing it to amend its answer and Parker would not be prejudiced \r\n  as a result of the amendment.Â  The trial judge abused his discretion in denying \r\n  the Sewer Districtâ€™s motion to amend its answer.\r\nIII.Â  MEDICARE PAYMENTS\r\nFinally, the Sewer District asserts the \r\n  trial judge erred in not allowing it to introduce evidence of amounts actually \r\n  paid by Medicare toward Parkerâ€™s total medical bills.Â  The Sewer District argues \r\n  this evidence was relevant to show Parkerâ€™s medical expenses were less than \r\n  the amount reflected in bills she submitted into evidence.Â  The Sewer District \r\n  complains it was so prejudiced by its inability to introduce this evidence it \r\n  should be granted a new trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe decision to admit or exclude evidence \r\n  is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  See Clark \r\n  v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000); Gamble v. International \r\n  Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996).Â  The courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  to admit or exclude evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse \r\n  of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry \r\n  Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 540 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  For \r\n  an appellate court to reverse based on an erroneous exclusion of evidence by \r\n  the trial court, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and resulting \r\n  prejudice.Â  Recco Tape &amp; Label Co. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, 439 S.E.2d 838 (1994); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 \r\n  S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn the case at bar, the trial judge did \r\n  not err in denying the Sewer Districtâ€™s request to admit evidence of Medicare \r\n  payments.Â  This case is analogous to Covington v. George, \r\n  359 S.C. 100, 597 S.E.2d 142 (2004), a recent South Carolina Supreme Court case.Â  \r\n  In Covington, the defendant, Gary George, appealed the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  decision to exclude evidence that the hospital, which treated the plaintiff, \r\n  accepted as full payment an amount less than what it billed. Â Id. at \r\n  101, 597 S.E.2d at 143.Â  Similar to the case sub judice, George did not \r\n  object to the plaintiffâ€™s introduction of the full amount of the hospitalâ€™s \r\n  bill, but thereafter sought to introduce the actual payment amount to challenge \r\n  the reasonableness of the plaintiffâ€™s medical expenses.Â  Id. at 102-03, \r\n  597 S.E.2d at 143-44.Â  The supreme court held the amount a hospital accepted \r\n  as payment was inadmissible under the collateral source rule.Â  The court inculcated:\r\n\r\nThe collateral source rule provides â€œthat compensation received \r\n  by an injured party from a source wholly independent of the wrongdoer will not \r\n  reduce the damages owed by the wrongdoer.â€Â  Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank \r\n  of South Carolina v. Gregory, 320 S.C. 90, 92, 463 S.E.2d 317, 318 (1995).Â  \r\n  A tortfeasor cannot â€œtake advantage of a contract between an injured party and \r\n  a third person, no matter whether the source of the funds received is â€˜an insurance \r\n  company, an employer, a family member, or other source.â€™â€Â  Pustaver v. Gooden, \r\n  350 S.C. 409, 413, 566 S.E.2d 199, 201 (Ct. App. 2002) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n  In this case, the actual payment amounts were made by a collateral source.\r\n\r\nId. at 104, 597 S.E.2d at 144.Â  The court \r\n  explained the collateral source rule applied becauseÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nany attempts on the part of the plaintiff to explain the compromised \r\n  payments would necessarily lead to the existence of a collateral source.Â  Inevitably, \r\n  the inquiry would lead to the introduction of matters such as contractual arrangements \r\n  between health insurers and health care providers, resulting in the very confusion \r\n  which the trial judge sought to avoid in his proper application of Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.\r\n\r\nId. at 104, 597 S.E.2d at 144.Â  \r\nIn its brief, the Sewer District cited Haselden \r\n  v. Davis, 353 S.C. 481, 579 S.E.2d 293 (2003), for the proposition that \r\n  amounts paid by Medicaid may be relevant to determining a reasonable value of \r\n  medical services and, therefore, this information should be provided to the \r\n  trier of fact for it to consider in determining damages.Â  Covington, \r\n  however, specifically limited the holding in Haselden: â€œThe admissibility \r\n  of the actual payment amount was not an appellate issue in Haselden, \r\n  but rather the issue was Plaintiff's entitlement to recover the difference \r\n  between the billed amount and the actual payment amount.â€Â  Covington, \r\n  359 S.C. at 103, 597 S.E.2d at 143-44 (emphasis in original).\r\nBased on the holding in Covington, the trial \r\n  judge did not err in excluding evidence of the Medicare payments.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial judge committed reversible \r\n  error in denying the Sewer Districtâ€™s request for a reduction in the jury award \r\n  to comply with the limitation on recoverable damages set forth under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  We hold that the liability cap articulated within \r\n  the Tort Claims Act is NOT an affirmative defense and the failure to \r\n  plead the specific limitation on the amount of recovery allowed under the Tort \r\n  Claims Act is NOT a waiver of the cap.Â  We conclude the trial judge abused \r\n  his discretion in refusing to allow the Sewer District to amend its answer to \r\n  assert the Tort Claims Act limitation on recoverable damages as an affirmative \r\n  defense.Â  Finally, we rule the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding \r\n  evidence of Medicare payments.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  isÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, \r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Parker did not appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding the \r\n    dismissal of Pace. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3916","title":"State v.

Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Thurman Oâ€™Neil Smith, Jr. was tried for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and convicted of voluntary manslaughter and the weapons charge.Â  He appeals, arguing the evidence did not support either the verdict of voluntary manslaughter or its submission as a verdict option.Â  We reverse.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 2002, Smithâ€™s 16-year-old daughter told her mother her paternal grandmotherâ€™s husband, Tommy Moss, molested her when she was approximately 8 years old.Â  She said the molestation happened at her grandmotherâ€™s home while her grandmother was sleeping. Â Although she did not tell her parents at the time, she never spent the night at her grandmotherâ€™s home again.Â  \r\nAround 7:00 a.m. the next day, Smithâ€™s wife relayed the allegation to Smith. Â Although shaken by the news, Smith went to work until about 3:15 p.m., when he left one work site and stopped by another to give a price estimate. Â Smith arrived at home between 4:00 and 4:20 p.m.Â  While there, he had a beer and talked for about 45 minutes to his wife and daughter about the alleged molestation.Â  They discussed seeking counseling for Smithâ€™s daughter, which spurred Smith to call his therapist to arrange an appointment. Â They also discussed whether law enforcement could be involved and about exposing what Moss had done.Â  Smith then showered, talked to the therapist, and retrieved a gun from his dresser.Â  He left the house, with his wife and daughter unaware he had the gun and under the impression he was going to a lake he frequented.Â  \r\nInstead, Smith drove to the home of a friend, and without mentioning the molestation allegation, discussed target practice.Â  During the discussion, he asked his friendâ€™s son or the sonâ€™s friend to go buy some shells for him, which he did.Â  Smith left and stopped at a local bar and grill around 5:30 p.m.Â  He talked with another friend, Tommy Edwards, and drank part of a beer.Â  The two walked outside and continued to talk.Â  Smith told Edwards about the alleged molestation of his daughter and the earlier abduction and death of another daughter many years before.Â  \r\nAfter Edwards left, Smith loaded the gun with six bullets and started driving to the home of his mother and stepfather. Â Along the way, Smith stopped and removed the bullets, but he put two back in the gun.Â  He arrived at the Mossesâ€™ home about twenty minutes later.Â  \r\nSmithâ€™s mother, Loretta, saw a truck she did not recognize[1] arrive in her driveway.Â  When Smith stepped out of his truck, Loretta then recognized her son.Â  Smith was yelling, asking Loretta something to the effect of â€œWhere is that son of a bitch youâ€™re married to?â€Â  He screamed out the accusations against Moss, and Loretta responded Smith was wrong and his daughter was a â€œlying slut.â€Â  Loretta testified Smith said, â€œIâ€™ve come down here to kill youâ€ to Moss.Â  At this point, Moss was outside at his doorway.Â  Smith was waving the gun, and Loretta was asking him to put the gun away.Â  Moss possibly raised his hand and made contact with Smithâ€™s arm, and the gun fired.Â  Moss was shot and he fell blocking the door, requiring Loretta to enter the house from the back to call for emergency assistance.Â  Moss died.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nSmith argues the trial court erred in charging the jury on the law of voluntary manslaughter and allowing the juryâ€™s voluntary manslaughter guilty verdict to stand.Â  We agree.\r\nThe trial court must determine the law to be charged based on the evidence at trial.Â  State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51, 584 S.E.2d. 110, 112 (2003).Â  When the record contains no evidence to support it, a voluntary manslaughter jury charge should not be given.Â  See State v. Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 67-68, 536 S.E.2d 666, 668-69 (2000).Â  \r\nIn considering a new trial motion based on insufficiency of the evidence, the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence rather than its weight.Â  See State v. Pauling, 264 S.C. 275, 278, 214 S.E.2d 326, 327 (1975).Â  The weight of the evidence is a question for the jury.Â  Id.Â  Where there is any evidence supporting the juryâ€™s verdict, the court commits no error in denying the motion.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n  Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.Â  Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing.Â  The provocation must be such as to render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection and produce an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.\r\n\r\nState v. Cooley, 342 S.C. at 67, 536 S.E.2d at 668 (internal citations omitted).Â  Even if sufficient legal provocation has aroused a defendantâ€™s passion, â€œif at the time of the killing those passions had cooled or a sufficiently reasonable time had elapsed so that the passions of the ordinary reasonable person would have cooled, the killing would be murder and not manslaughter.â€Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 303, 555 S.E.2d 391, 395 (2001).Â  \r\n Assuming without deciding sufficient legal provocation existed in this case, the evidence clearly does not establish Smith acted in the sudden heat of passion. Smith heard the allegation early in the morning, went to work, talked to his family and called to make his daughter an appointment with a therapist, went to a friend&rsquo;s house to talk, dropped by a bar where he talked with another friend, and finally arrived at Moss&rsquo;s home in the evening. This was certainly a long enough period to render Smith capable of cool reflection. Also, during this time he retrieved his gun, had someone buy him ammunition, loaded the gun, unloaded it, and reloaded it. Although there was testimony he was upset, this evidence suggests he in fact coolly reflected on the situation. Because demonstration of sudden heat of passion is required to establish voluntary manslaughter, the evidence supports neither the voluntary manslaughter verdict option nor the verdict itself.\r\n As a consequence of our reversal of Smithâ€™s conviction on the charge of voluntary manslaughter, we also reverse his conviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, because the former is a prerequisite for the latter.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490 (2003) (providing contemporaneous indictment and conviction of violent crime prerequisite to punishment under section 16-23-490).Â  Absent the voluntary manslaughter conviction, Smithâ€™s conviction for violation of section 16-23-490 cannot stand.Â  State v.

Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 536 S.E.2d 666 (2000), our supreme court edified:\r\n\r\n  Furthermore, based on the testimony presented at Defendantâ€™s trial, the result of our holding here is that without any evidence of legal provocation Defendant cannot be retried on the charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Thus, retrial will be limited to the charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 69, 536 S.E.2d at 669.Â  \r\nApplying Cooley, a reversal encapsulates a retrial on involuntary manslaughter.Â \r\n\r\n[1]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Smith and his mother had been estranged for nearly three years. \r\n[2]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The majority thoroughly agrees with the dissent that State v. Cooley would allow Smith to be tried on a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Even though this court does not specifically remand for that purpose, that option remains open should the solicitor in his discretion determine the facts of the case warrant it.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3917","title":"State v.

Â Â We reverse and remand1 for a new trial.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe victim in this case met John Hubner in the summer of 1996.Â  At that time, \r\n  victim was twelve years old, was between sixth and seventh grade, and was about \r\n  to start in her churchâ€™s junior high youth group.Â  Hubner was an active member \r\n  of the church, where he volunteered with the youth group and taught Sunday school.Â  \r\n  Victimâ€™s first impression of Hubner was that he was nice, and she specifically \r\n  appreciated the manner in which he would listen and talk to her.Â  Victim testified \r\n  she was able to talk to Hubner about problems in her relationship with her mother, \r\n  and Hubner would tell her that victim was right and her mother had problems.Â  \r\n\r\nVictim would often arrive at church early on Sunday mornings because her parents \r\n  served as greeters in the church.Â  When victim would get there, Hubner would \r\n  regularly be waiting for her at a downstairs door, where he would immediately \r\n  hug victim and engage her in conversation.Â  Victim testified to a progression \r\n  of a more sexual relationship from August 1996 through March 1997.Â  Victim first \r\n  recalled a major incident that occurred in a Sunday school room after she injured \r\n  her leg playing softball.Â  Hubner massaged her knee by reaching down into her \r\n  pants to her knee and massaging her leg all the way back up to the top.Â  \r\nVictim next testified to an incident that occurred during a discussion she \r\n  had with Hubner about the changes her body was undergoing as a result of puberty \r\n  and the effect it had on her softball playing abilities.Â  During this conversation \r\n  behind a closed door in victimâ€™s Sunday school room, victim testified Hubner \r\n  hugged her from behind, pulled his arms out and reached across her breasts.Â  \r\n  He then moved his arms toward her hips, turned her toward him, lifted her shirt \r\n  and stared at her in her bra.Â  He then squeezed her breasts before putting her \r\n  shirt back down and telling her everything was fine.Â  Hubner also hugged victim \r\n  tightly, pushing his crotch close to her.Â  At this time, victim felt their relationship \r\n  was changing.Â  \r\nVictim testified about another incident occurring prior to Christmas in 1996 \r\n  when they were alone in the game room in her churchâ€™s youth area on a Wednesday \r\n  night.Â  There, Hubner showed her how to dance by putting victimâ€™s feet on top \r\n  of his and holding her.Â  Hubner reached into her back pockets and squeezed her \r\n  â€œbutt.â€Â  He then took his hands out of the pockets, placed them into her pants, \r\n  and continued to squeeze her â€œbuttâ€ while they danced.Â  He proceeded to lift \r\n  her onto a foosball table and fondle her between her vagina and rectum.Â  At \r\n  this point, victim still liked Hubner because he listened to her, and he often \r\n  told her that he loved her.Â  \r\nVictim related another incident occurring November 15, 1996, when the youth \r\n  group had a lock-in and went to Frankieâ€™s Fun Park.Â  It was a cold evening and \r\n  victim had left her jacket on the bus.Â  Hubner asked her if she was cold and, \r\n  although she told him she was not, he unzipped his jacket, put her inside the \r\n  jacket with him, and zipped it back up.Â  Suddenly, victim realized Hubner had \r\n  an erection.Â  He looked at her, hushed her, and told her he loved her.Â  \r\nOn another occasion, victim related how, on a Sunday morning in the Sunday \r\n  school room, they were alone with the door shut and talking about her problems \r\n  with her mother.Â  Hubner again told victim that she was right, and that her \r\n  parents had problems.Â  He stated that her parents were â€œSunday morning Christiansâ€ \r\n  and they did not have the relationship with God like he had and that he wanted \r\n  victim to have.Â  He told victim if she trusted God, everything would be okay.Â  \r\n  Hubner asked her to unbutton his shirt and touch his chest, which she did.Â  \r\n  Then, he guided her hand to touch his penis through his clothes.Â  She repeatedly \r\n  pinched his penis and he had an erection.Â  Hubnerâ€™s eyes rolled back into his \r\n  head and then he suddenly stopped victim, telling her it was time for Sunday \r\n  school.Â  Thereafter, victim thought Hubner was mad at her because he did not \r\n  speak to her the next several times he saw her.Â  The next time they talked, \r\n  Hubner told victim he loved her, that God had given them â€œthis really special \r\n  relationshipâ€ and that he was happy God had put her in his life.Â  He told victim \r\n  she needed to remember their relationship was private and secret, and thatâ€™s \r\n  the way God wanted it to be.Â  On another occasion, Hubner sat victim down on \r\n  his knee while in the church sanctuary and read I Corinthians 13, a bible passage \r\n  on love, to her and told her that was how he loved victim.Â  \r\nNext, victim related a story occurring in the church annex as she played hide \r\n  and seek with friends.Â  She was standing alone in a room when Hubner walked \r\n  up behind her, picked her up around her breast area, and guided her behind a \r\n  door.Â  He began to massage her shoulders and neck and then proceeded to massage \r\n  down her leg and then the inside of her leg, getting close to her groin.Â  Victim \r\n  broke away and ran to her friends.Â  \r\nVictim testified their relationship changed again around March 7, 1997, when \r\n  she participated in a church event called Disciple Now.Â  There, discussions \r\n  about sexual relationships led victim to realize her relationship with Hubner \r\n  was not normal, and afterwards, she began to either avoid being alone with Hubner \r\n  or asked her friends to pull her away if they saw her with him.Â  Sometime after \r\n  Disciple Now, victim testified Hubner presented her with a bracelet as a birthday \r\n  gift, though she refused the gift.Â  After she rejected the gift and began to \r\n  avoid Hubner, he became more forceful with victim.Â  Victim complained to some \r\n  adults that Hubner made her feel uncomfortable and she did not want to be around \r\n  him, but she did not disclose to them the wrongful touchings.Â  \r\nAfter the Disciple Now weekend in March, the next incident occurred when victim \r\n  was thirteen years old, in July 1997.Â  She and Hubner both attended a church \r\n  camp.Â  Victim related a time where she thought Hubner had accidentally touched \r\n  her vagina when his fingers slipped in her bathing suit while Hubner was throwing \r\n  victim and her friends in a swimming pool.Â  However, at the same camp, victim \r\n  testified to an event that upset her greatly.Â  Victim testified she was talking \r\n  to a group of people when Hubner called her over.Â  Victim kept a row of chairs \r\n  between them, but Hubner reached out to hug her anyway.Â  Victim crossed her \r\n  arms over her chest and leaned back.Â  Hubner then grabbed victim around her \r\n  face, pulled her toward him, and kissed her.Â  Victim stated she felt that had \r\n  she not turned her face, he would have kissed her on her lips.Â  Victim was shocked \r\n  at this.Â  She stated she became very upset and was scared and shaking.Â  She \r\n  then told the two female leaders for her group about the kiss.Â  \r\nLater, around August of 1997, victim rode over to the Hubner home with her \r\n  sister, who was friends with Hubnerâ€™s youngest daughter.Â  He asked victim to \r\n  accompany him to show her his new motorcycle.Â  While in the garage, Hubner picked \r\n  victim up, placed her on the bike, and sat on it behind her.Â  He then put his \r\n  hands down her shorts, over her panties, and fondled her vagina.Â  \r\nVictim still did not tell anyone what had occurred with Hubner after the motorcycle \r\n  incident.Â  She testified she did not say anything because she thought Hubner \r\n  loved her.Â  She also stated she was afraid Hubner would kill her because he \r\n  told her their â€œrelationship was secret and it was Godâ€™s, and God punishes people \r\n  when they donâ€™t obey him.â€Â  \r\nVictim was able to avoid Hubner during the fall and winter of 1997 and 1998.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, victim began complaining to the church youth pastor about Hubnerâ€™s \r\n  unwanted attention.Â  Victim told the pastor Hubner needed to be removed from \r\n  the youth group, telling the pastor she was frightened of Hubner, that he hugged \r\n  her too much, told her he loved her unconditionally, told her that her body \r\n  was beautiful, and always wanted to be alone with her.Â  While she did not detail \r\n  any illegal behavior on Hubnerâ€™s part, victim did, at the pastorâ€™s request, \r\n  write a letter in the summer of 1998 explaining some of the aspects of their \r\n  relationship and the reasons she felt uncomfortable around Hubner.Â  As a result \r\n  of that letter, Hubner was asked to step down from his position in the youth \r\n  ministry department.Â  \r\nThereafter, when victim was fifteen and sitting alone outside the sanctuary \r\n  during a Christmas pageant practice, Hubner sat down beside her, placed his \r\n  arm around her shoulder and rested his hand on the side of her breast.Â  During \r\n  this incident, victim reported he told her he still loved her and they had a \r\n  special relationship that was very secret.Â  \r\nEventually, victim opened up to her youth pastor and \r\n  detailed some of the more explicit incidences that had occurred with Hubner.Â  \r\n  These allegations came to the attention of law enforcement, and Hubner was subsequently \r\n  charged with six counts of committing a lewd act upon a child.Â  After jury selection, \r\n  the State requested it be allowed to introduce evidence of prior criminal actions \r\n  by Hubner against another child which occurred in Maine in 1981 and 1982.Â  The \r\n  State argued there were numerous similarities between the two cases and the \r\n  evidence should be admitted in order to demonstrate the existence of a common \r\n  scheme or plan.Â  The defense countered the allegations in the two cases were \r\n  not that similar, but were merely general to this type of case.Â  Further, the \r\n  defense asserted, given the dissimilarities between the two cases and the fact \r\n  that the prior case was almost twenty years old, the evidence should be excluded.Â  \r\n  The trial court held an in camera hearing on the matter, which included taking \r\n  the testimony of Hubnerâ€™s prior victim, Rachel,2 regarding the incidents of abuse she suffered at \r\n  the hands of Hubner.Â  \r\nRachel, who was thirty-two at the time of the trial, \r\n  voluntarily traveled from her home in Arizona to South Carolina to testify against \r\n  Hubner.Â  She testified at the end of the summer of 1981, when she was eleven \r\n  but about to turn twelve, her family moved to a new house in Waterville, Maine.Â  \r\n  Hubner lived three to four houses away and became acquainted with Rachelâ€™s parents.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, Rachel began to watch television with Hubner and became his friend.Â  \r\n  She would help him shovel his driveway and baby-sat his children at his house.Â  \r\n\r\nRachel thought Hubner was nice to her. Â Hubner began \r\n  to give Rachel short hugs.Â  At some point, however, these hugs became a kind \r\n  where Hubner would touch her body in the wrong way.Â  He also began to kiss Rachel \r\n  on the neck, and cheek, and would French kiss her.Â  This contact occurred at \r\n  his house while Rachel was baby-sitting.Â  There came a time when Hubner began \r\n  to fondle Rachelâ€™s breasts and bottom through her clothing and would tell Rachel \r\n  she had a nice body.Â  On one occasion, Hubner came up from behind Rachel, grabbed \r\n  her chest, and â€œrub[bed] certain body parts.â€Â  In another incident, Hubner removed \r\n  Rachelâ€™s shirt, but not her bra, and just stared at her.Â  \r\nHubner also would put his hands in her front and back \r\n  pockets and would massage her vagina and her buttocks through her clothes.Â  \r\n  This progressed until he would also touch her vaginal area under her clothes.Â  \r\n  Hubner would also come up behind her while he had an erection and rub himself \r\n  against her.Â  On other occasions, she touched his crotch both with and without \r\n  his clothes on.Â  This behavior progressed to him masturbating in front of Rachel \r\n  and having sexual intercourse with her.Â  Hubner also gave her alcohol.Â  Rachel \r\n  testified Hubner would tell her she was pretty, she had a beautiful body, and \r\n  that he loved her.Â  He threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, Rachel admitted giving a statement \r\n  to police indicating the hugging started in December, 1981.Â  The statement showed \r\n  it was also during December that he was hugging her from behind and, by the \r\n  next Saturday, put his hands in her shirt and played with her breasts.Â  Rachel \r\n  therefore agreed that within a week of the hugging in December, Hubner was touching \r\n  her breasts.Â  The statement further showed that â€œby the next Saturday, [Hubner] \r\n  started making passes at [her] by pointing at [her] and then him and then upstairs,â€ \r\n  so that he was almost immediately propositioning her for sex.Â  Thus, Hubner \r\n  was propositioning her within two weeks of the first hug.Â  Rachel also admitted \r\n  these sexual encounters involved other people.Â  She testified one of her friendâ€™s, \r\n  Michelle, was with her on one occasion where Hubner exposed his penis and masturbated \r\n  in front of them.Â  She also testified to an occasion when another man came over \r\n  to Hubnerâ€™s house and this man had intercourse with Rachel.Â  Rachelâ€™s statement \r\n  also indicated that around Christmas, Hubner was at Rachelâ€™s home and he put \r\n  her on her bed and touched her near her breasts.Â  Another time at Rachelâ€™s home, \r\n  Hubner slapped her and tried to kiss her.Â  Sometime after the hugging started, \r\n  Hubner attempted to take Rachelâ€™s pants off while they were watching television.Â  \r\n  Rachel also indicated in her statement that Hubner offered to pay her for fellatio \r\n  and to masturbate him.Â  Rachel reported the matter in early February 1982.Â  \r\n  She agreed that all of these incidences took place over roughly a two-month \r\n  period.Â  \r\nDuring the hearing, Hubner took the stand and admitted \r\n  pleading guilty to one count of unlawful sexual contact against Rachel, but \r\n  denied he committed any of the acts Rachel claimed he committed.Â  After hearing \r\n  the testimony and arguments, the trial judge noted that the progression of the \r\n  seriousness of the acts over a period of time was different between the two \r\n  cases and there were â€œa number of acts that were very dissimilar.â€Â  Nonetheless, \r\n  the judge found the similar acts were probative, and their probative value outweighed \r\n  their prejudicial effect.Â  He thus determined it was proper to admit the portions \r\n  of Rachelâ€™s testimony regarding the similar acts, but the State was not allowed \r\n  to go into dissimilar acts.Â  The case proceeded to trial, and Rachelâ€™s testimony \r\n  regarding the hugging, kissing and inappropriate touching was allowed into evidence \r\n  over Hubnerâ€™s objection.Â  Thereafter, Hubner was found guilty on all charges \r\n  and was sentenced to three consecutive twelve-year terms, two concurrent twelve-year \r\n  terms, and one fifteen-year term, which was suspended with five years of probation.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOrdinarily, determinations concerning the admissibility of evidence are treated \r\n  as involving questions of fact.Â  State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 326, \r\n  580 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, the determination of whether \r\n  the facts surrounding an assault sufficiently evidence a common scheme or plan \r\n  is a question of law.Â  Id. at 326-27, 580 S.E.2d at 190.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGenerally, evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to prove the \r\n  specific crime charged; however, an exception exists for evidence tending to \r\n  establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence of mistake or accident, (4) \r\n  a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related \r\n  to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other, or (5) the identity \r\n  of the person charged with the present crime.Â  See State v. Lyle, \r\n  125 S.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923); Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  For the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception to apply, a close degree of similarity or connection \r\n  between the prior bad act and the crime charged is necessary.Â  State v. Timmons, \r\n  327 S.C. 48, 52, 488 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1997).Â  The connection between the prior \r\n  bad act and the charged crime must be more than just a similarity, as a common \r\n  scheme or plan concerns more than just the commission of similar crimes; some \r\n  connection between the crimes is necessary.Â  Id.Â  Under the common scheme \r\n  or plan exception, there must be a close degree of similarity or connection \r\n  between the prior bad act and the crime charged which enhances the probative \r\n  value of the evidence so as to outweigh its prejudicial effect.Â  State v. \r\n  Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 95, 480 S.E.2d 77, 80 (1997).Â  \r\nFurther, common scheme or plan evidence in criminal sexual conduct cases will \r\n  be admitted on a generalized basis only where there is a pattern of continuous \r\n  illicit conduct.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 328, 580 S.E.2d at 191.Â  The conduct \r\n  need not be continuous, however, to fall within the common scheme or plan exception.Â  \r\n  Id. at 330, 580 S.E.2d at 192.Â  Rather, the determination of the admissibility \r\n  of a prior bad act that does not include continuous conduct rests solely on \r\n  whether the requisite degree of similarity between the separate acts is present.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nIn arguing to the trial judge that Rachelâ€™s testimony should be admitted, the \r\n  solicitor asserted our appellate courts have been â€œextremely liberal in the \r\n  acceptance and the admissibility of Lyle-type testimony in child sexual \r\n  assault cases.â€Â  However, there is no case law to support that position.Â  Indeed, \r\n  this court noted in Tutton, that prior case law did not â€œlower the bar \r\n  for admissibility under Lyle simply because sexual crimes are involved.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 328, 580 S.E.2d at 191.Â  \r\nIn Tutton, we found Lyle evidence of a previous attack against \r\n  one of the same child victims to be inadmissible.Â  Tutton was accused of improperly \r\n  fondling two sisters who were visiting his live-in girlfriendâ€™s daughter.Â  It \r\n  was alleged that on the first night the children slept on the floor near Tuttonâ€™s \r\n  bed and he fondled one of them by touching her â€œbuttâ€, rubbing her private parts, \r\n  and using his fingers to penetrate her vagina.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 323, \r\n  580 S.E.2d at 188.Â  The second night, Tutton slept on a couch and the girls \r\n  again slept nearby on the floor.Â  Id.Â  Another sister testified Tutton \r\n  fondled her â€œbuttâ€ and touched her private parts before she could move over \r\n  and out of Tuttonâ€™s reach.Â  Id.Â  At trial, the State was allowed to introduce \r\n  evidence from one of these girls that Tutton had previously assaulted her some \r\n  four to five years prior to the trial.Â  Id. at 324, 580 S.E.2d at 189.Â  \r\n  The girl testified Tutton forced her to lie on her back, take off her panties, \r\n  and Tutton then performed oral sex on her and forced her to perform oral sex \r\n  on him.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, she testified he threatened to tell her parents \r\n  she was misbehaving if she told anyone of the incident.Â  Id.Â  \r\nRecognizing that there were some similarities between the prior alleged assault \r\n  and the charged offenses, this court, in Tutton, nonetheless found the \r\n  separate offenses were dissimilar in significant ways.Â  Id. at 331-32, \r\n  580 S.E.2d at 193.Â  There we stated:\r\n\r\nFor purposes of analyzing \r\n  evidence of prior misconduct under the common scheme or plan exception, we believe \r\n  it is crucial to distinguish similarities that merely link the two crimes from \r\n  those similarities that tend to paint the broader, more relevant picture.Â  Where, \r\n  for example, the similarities are used to prove only the defendantâ€™s intent, \r\n  very little is required because the charged act in such cases is assumed done.Â  \r\n  2 Wigmore, Â§ 304.Â  However, â€˜where the very act is the object of proof, and \r\n  is desired to be inferred from a plan or system, the combination of common features \r\n  that will suggest a common plan as their explanation involves so much higher \r\n  a grade of similarity as to constitute a substantially new and distinct test.â€™Â  \r\n  Id. â€˜The added element, then, must be, not merely a similarity in the \r\n  results, but such a concurrence of common features that the various acts \r\n  are normally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the \r\n  individual manifestations.â€™Â  Id. (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\nId. at 331, 580 S.E.2d at 192-93.Â  Noting that the balancing of similarities \r\n  is a difficult task in cases dealing with the admission of common scheme or \r\n  plan evidence, we found the similarities in the case were insufficient to support \r\n  the inference that Tutton employed a common scheme or plan to commit the assaults \r\n  alleged by the victims.Â  Id. at 333, 580 S.E.2d at 194.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the case at hand, the acts were against two different victims and occurred \r\n  some fourteen years apart.Â  Thus, the testimony cannot be admitted on a generalized \r\n  basis as a pattern of continuous illicit conduct under the common scheme or \r\n  plan exception.Â  Rather, the admissibility of Rachelâ€™s testimony rests solely \r\n  on whether the requisite degree of similarity between the separate acts is present.Â  \r\n  As noted, this similarity must not merely be a similarity in the results.Â  Rather, \r\n  there must be such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are \r\n  normally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual \r\n  manifestations.\r\nThe trial judge here recognized the numerous dissimilarities in the two cases.Â  \r\n  He nonetheless allowed into evidence prior bad acts against Rachel, attempting \r\n  to limit the impact of these dissimilarities by restricting the examination \r\n  of Rachel to testimony concerning only similar acts.Â  The evidence was thus \r\n  presented in a vacuum to the jury. However, this does not diminish the fact \r\n  that an overwhelming number of significant dissimilarities were present between \r\n  the prior bad act and the case at hand.Â  While the similarities may â€œlink the \r\n  two crimes,â€ the question is whether they â€œpaint the broader, more relevant \r\n  pictureâ€ of a common scheme or plan of which they are the individual manifestations.Â  \r\n  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 331, 580 S.E.2d at 192-93.Â  Thus, the trial judge \r\n  failed to balance the similarities and dissimilarities in making a determination \r\n  as to whether Rachelâ€™s testimony concerning the prior bad acts was admissible \r\n  at all.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, we find there are insufficient similarities between the \r\n  conduct with Rachel and the conduct with victim to support admission of the \r\n  evidence of Hubnerâ€™s prior abuse of Rachel.Â  First, while the prior acts with \r\n  Rachel did include a few general similarities to the case at hand that may â€œlink \r\n  the two crimes,â€ including the hugging and inappropriate touchings of twelve-year-old \r\n  girls, there were numerous dissimilarities between the acts.Â  The kissing with \r\n  Rachel included kissing her on her neck and cheek and French kissing her, while \r\n  with victim it was one kiss on her cheek, which victim believed was meant for \r\n  her lips.Â  The acts with Rachel further included intercourse, fellatio, masturbation, \r\n  and multiple partners.Â  The conduct with Rachel included an almost immediate \r\n  progression from innocuous hugs to inappropriate touching and beyond, such that \r\n  it is hard to segregate the less egregious acts from the more egregious.Â  Victim, \r\n  on the other hand, alleged a slow progression in the development of a sexual \r\n  based relationship where she was hugged, fondled, and ultimately persuaded to \r\n  touch Hubner.Â  The degree in and progression of behavior experienced by Rachel \r\n  and victim is markedly different.Â  Second, Hubner threatened to kill Rachel, \r\n  whereas he told victim that God had given them a special, secret relationship.Â  \r\n  Thus, Hubner used victimâ€™s religious habits and beliefs to take advantage of \r\n  the opportunities to commit these sexual acts and to keep her from telling anyone \r\n  of them, whereas he used money, employment and physical threats to do the same \r\n  to Rachel.Â  Third, Hubner also committed sexual acts with another girl in the \r\n  presence of Rachel, whereas there is no testimony he also committed such acts \r\n  with any of victimâ€™s friends or that anyone else was present with victim during \r\n  any of the abuse she experienced.Â  Likewise, Rachel indicated Hubner brought \r\n  in another man to join in the sexual acts with Rachel, while no such thing occurred \r\n  with victim.Â  Additionally, all abuse against Rachel took place at Hubnerâ€™s \r\n  house or Rachelâ€™s house, whereas the alleged abuse against victim, with the \r\n  exception of one incident at Hubnerâ€™s home, took place in public places such \r\n  as the church, an amusement park, and church camp and all of these incidences \r\n  were affiliated with church activities.Â  Further, while Hubner often talked \r\n  to Rachel about sex and gave her alcohol, victim alleges Hubner talked to her \r\n  about God, religion, and her family problems.Â  Victim did not indicate any instances \r\n  where Hubner gave her any alcohol.Â  Finally, the State focuses on the position \r\n  of authority Hubner had over victim as a church deacon and leader within the \r\n  youth group.Â  He held no such special position of authority over Rachel, however, \r\n  to whom he was simply a neighbor and person who employed her as a babysitter.Â  \r\n  Thus, the incidences with Rachel and victim occurred â€œunder different circumstances, \r\n  at different times, in different places, and in different ways.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Berry, 332 S.C. 214, 219, 503 S.E.2d 770, 773 (Ct. App. 1998).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nWe are especially mindful of the exhortation in Lyle that â€œif the court \r\n  does not clearly perceive the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction \r\n  and the crime charged, that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be \r\n  given the benefit of the doubt and the evidence should be rejected.â€Â  Lyle, \r\n  125 S.C. at 417, 118 S.E. at 807.Â  As previously noted, a close degree of similarity \r\n  or connection between the prior bad act and the crime charged, which enhances \r\n  the probative value of the evidence so as to outweigh its prejudicial effect, \r\n  is required for the evidence to be admissible under the common scheme or plan \r\n  exception.Â  In the context of sexual assault cases, â€œ[t]he rationale for this \r\n  rule is that the overwhelming result of admitting unconnected sexual relationships \r\n  is to establish an accusedâ€™s character or propensity to engage in the alleged \r\n  sexual conduct as a basis for inferring that he committed the charged crime.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Rivers, 273 S.C. 75, 78, 254 S.E.2d 299, 300&nbsp;(1979).Â  Here, \r\n  there simply is not such a close degree of similarity or connection between \r\n  the prior bad act and the crimes charged as would enhance the probative value \r\n  so as to outweigh its prejudicial effect.Â  Because we do not clearly perceive \r\n  the required connection between these two cases, we hold the trial judge erred \r\n  in admitting Rachelâ€™s testimony.\r\nIn addition to finding Rachelâ€™s testimony was admitted in error, we find the \r\n  admission was not harmless.Â  In determining whether the improper introduction \r\n  of evidence is harmless, the appellate court must review the other evidence \r\n  admitted at trial in order to determine whether the defendantâ€™s guilt was conclusively \r\n  established by competent evidence such that no other rational consideration \r\n  could be reached by the jury.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 334, 580 S.E.2d at \r\n  194.Â  While the State presented some evidence that corroborated Hubnerâ€™s opportunity \r\n  to commit the acts in question and victimâ€™s reaction to Hubner, there was no \r\n  testimony by anyone that witnessed a clear instance of Hubnerâ€™s commission of \r\n  a lewd act on victim.Â  Hubner vehemently denied victimâ€™s accusations, and the \r\n  case effectively came down to a challenge of credibility between Hubner and \r\n  victim.Â  Therefore, we cannot say that without Rachelâ€™s testimony the evidence \r\n  was so overwhelming that a guilty verdict was the only rational conclusion.3 \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, we reverse Hubnerâ€™s convictions and remand for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 The prior victimâ€™s name has been changed in this opinion to protect \r\n    her identity. \r\n\r\n \r\n  3  Because we find the trial judge erred in admitting the prior bad \r\n    act evidence, we need not address other issues raised by Hubner.Â  See \r\n    Futch v.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, numerous physicians testified for the State that Passionâ€™s injuries \r\n  were not only consistent with, but a result of shaken baby syndrome.Â  They further \r\n  opined that trauma of that type and severity could not have been inflicted accidentally.Â  \r\n\r\nPassion arrived \r\n  at the hospital alive, but in critical condition.Â  Dr. Hubbird was called to \r\n  assist the effort to resuscitate Passion.Â  At trial, he described her condition:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         . . . [Her] eyes were widely dilated . . . . I saw hemorrhages, areas \r\n  of bleeding into the retina on both eyes. . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . [T]he main thing that I was noticing, I came into the\r\n          E.R., the child \r\n  was in the emergency department in a bed intubated, not moving, and the pupils \r\n  were widely dilated so neurologically I already knew the child was quite devastated.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n. . . .\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n        Did the C.T. scan in fact confirm that the child hadâ€”when you say neurological, \r\n  do you mean brain damage?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n        Brain damage, yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n        And what did the C.T. scan show?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        . . . It showed what we call a subdural\r\n          hematoma, meaning thereâ€™s a \r\n  collection of blood. . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . It showed the subdural hematoma and it showed swelling of the brain itself.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . [T]here was so much swelling on the right side that the brain was pushed \r\n  over against the left, there was some midline shift.Â  Midline shift is very \r\n  dangerous.Â  Any swelling of the brain is dangerous, but midline shift in particular \r\n  means that thereâ€™s massive, massive swelling and that causes massive damage.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDr. Hubbird then asseverated as to the likely cause of Passionâ€™s \r\n  injuries: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         My examination, with the subdural hematoma, with the retinal hemorrhages, \r\n  and the abnormal neurological findings is the evidence of big time swelling \r\n  and neurological deficit, that indicated child abuse.Â  Thatâ€™s what causes it, \r\n  thatâ€™s what it is.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         This isâ€”those three things together virtually is diagnostic, meaning \r\n  it tells us what it is.Â  They used to call itâ€”and a lot of people still call \r\n  it shaken baby syndrome.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         And when you say shaken baby syndrome, what type of trauma is inflicted \r\n  on this child to cause these injuries?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Shaken baby syndrome is violent whiplash type shaking of an infant or \r\n  small toddler.Â  It has to be very violent.Â  The human brain is meant to take \r\n  a niceâ€”you know, if you fall you might be a little dazed.Â  We are meant to take \r\n  a quick trauma to the brain, if itâ€™s just a one time deal, I mean, you wake \r\n  up like that, and it doesnâ€™t usually cause a big problem.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\nBut back and forth, sustained shaking and violent shaking, the brain is not \r\n  meant to take that and it causes bleeding, retinal hemorrhages, and all that \r\n  then causes the swelling of the brain.Â  \r\n          &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        And Doctor, in your expert opinionâ€”and you mentioned could a fall, say \r\n  from even like a countertop or a bed or even from several feet, could that cause \r\n  these types of injuries?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No.Â  The only trauma that I know of, and Iâ€™ve never seen this, but from \r\n  whatâ€™s reported, that can cause anything even similar is a big time automobile \r\n  accident, either head-on or side impact where the child is ejected from the \r\n  car.Â  And I guess itâ€™s a potential from a several story fall, but then youâ€™d \r\n  see associated other injuries as well.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Could a child cause these types of injuries, say a three year old?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         No maâ€™am.Â  A three year old wouldnâ€™t have the strength.Â  Generally in \r\n  head injuries, itâ€™sâ€”a serious injury is caused by serious forces.Â  Violent forces \r\n  cause big injuries.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         What about justâ€”If I, as a grown person, were picking the child up in \r\n  the air and its head goes back, could that cause these types of injuries?Â  Could \r\n  this be accidental in any way?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         No this was not accidental.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         So taking a child and lifting it in the air or slightly shaking it wouldnâ€™t \r\n  cause this?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No, this would be violent, violent shaking. . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDr. Linda Christmann was qualified as an expert and explained the force necessary \r\n  to sustain the injuries to Passion:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         . . . Doctor, the hemorrhages that you saw, could they have even been \r\n  caused by falling down say a flight of stairs?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No they could not.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Doctor, in your opinion, could this have been an accidental shaking?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAnother expert, Dr. Close, corroborated the opinions of Drs. Hubbird and Christmann:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         And, Doctor, how would you characterize the type of shaking and/or trauma \r\n  that would be necessary to inflict this on a two year old, three month child?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         That would be brutal.Â  Iâ€™ve seen children fall.Â  Kids come to the hospital \r\n  after falling out of shopping carts and things like that.Â  You donâ€™t see bleeds \r\n  from that kind of trauma.Â  You see this bleed from bad car wrecks.Â  You see \r\n  itâ€”when I was a resident, when a child that had fallen out of a windowâ€”a third \r\n  floor window.Â  Itâ€™s significant trauma.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nOne physician testified for the defense that his examination of the child was \r\n  inconclusive.Â  He further stated the rebleeding of an existing head injury could \r\n  have caused the death.Â  \r\nAt trial, Mitchell averred that he discovered Passion and her brother, Hodari, \r\n  playing in the toilet.Â  He stopped them, spanked both with his belt, cleaned \r\n  them up, and let them leave to play while he cleaned up the bathroom.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  Hodari directed Mitchellâ€™s attention to Passion, who was facedown in the hallway.Â  \r\n  The jury did not credit Nathaniel Mitchellâ€™s testimony and found him guilty.Â  \r\n  He was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Involuntary Manslaughter \r\n  Is Not a Lesser Included Offense\r\nThe circuit court declined to charge the jury on involuntary \r\n  manslaughter.Â  The court found (1) involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser \r\n  included offense of the specific, statutorily defined crime of homicide by child \r\n  abuse, and (2) the facts did not support involuntary manslaughter.Â  The question \r\n  of whether involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of homicide \r\n  by child abuse is a novel issue of law in South Carolina. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Elements Test\r\nâ€œThe test for determining when an offense is a lesser included offense of another \r\n  is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the elements of the \r\n  lesser offense.â€Â  State v.

State, 308 S.C. 143, 144, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  543, 544 (1992).Â  â€œIf the lesser offense includes an element not included in \r\n  the greater offense, then the lesser offense is not included in the greater.â€Â  \r\n  Hope v. State, 328 S.C. 78, 81, 492 S.E.2d 76, 78&nbsp;(1997).Â  \r\nOne commentator on South Carolina courts has written that in recent years our \r\n  courts have â€œtended to parse the elements of offenses quite closely, often finding \r\n  two offenses contain separate elements and therefore that one offense is not \r\n  contained within the other.â€Â  William Shepard McAninch &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, \r\n  The Criminal Law of South Carolina 51 (4th ed. 2002).Â Â  An \r\n  example is Hope v. State, 328 S.C. 78, 492 S.E.2d 76 (1997).Â  In Hope, \r\n  the court determined entering without breaking is not a lesser included offense \r\n  of first degree burglary.Â  The supreme court explained that first degree burglary \r\n  is defined in part as entering a dwelling without consent, whereas the \r\n  alleged lesser included offense involves entering without breaking.Â  \r\n  Id. at 81-82, 492 S.E.2d at 78-79.Â Â  \r\nIn Stevenson v. State, 335 S.C. 193, 516 S.E.2d 434 (1999), the court \r\n  determined resisting arrest is not a lesser included offense of assault and \r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature: â€œABHAN requires proof of circumstances \r\n  of aggravation which is not required for resisting arrest.Â  Resisting arrest \r\n  requires proof that the person assaulted is a law enforcement officer which \r\n  is not an element of ABHAN.â€Â  Id. at 200, 516 S.E.2d at 438.Â  The Stevenson \r\n  court addressed lesser included offenses to ascertain whether the double jeopardy \r\n  clause was violated by convicting the defendant on charges of ABHAN and resisting \r\n  arrest.Â  Id. at 198-200, 516 S.E.2d at 436-439.Â  The court did this by \r\n  relying on the â€œsame elementsâ€ test created in Blockburger v. United States, \r\n  284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932).Â  In this way, the elements test used to determine \r\n  lesser included offenses apparently is an artifact of double jeopardy jurisprudence.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 (2003) provides:\r\n\r\n(A)Â  A person is guilty of homicide by child abuse \r\n  if the person:\r\n  \r\n(1)Â  causes the death of a child under the age of \r\n  eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death occurs under circumstances \r\n  manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is defined as: â€œ(1) the unintentional \r\n  killing of another without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity \r\n  not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the \r\n  unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity \r\n  with reckless disregard for the safety of others.â€Â  State v. Reese, 359 \r\n  S.C. 260, 597 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis added) (citing State v. \r\n  Tyler, 348 S.C. 526, 529, 560 S.E.2d 888, 889 (2002); State v. Chatman, \r\n  336 S.C. 149, 152, 519 S.E.2d 100, 101&nbsp;(1999)).\r\nHomicide by child abuse requires child abuse or neglect; \r\n  therefore, Mitchell is compelled to argue that he would fit within the first \r\n  prong of involuntary manslaughter, involving an unlawful activity, rather than \r\n  the second, involving a lawful activity.Â  Obligatorily, Mitchell is forced to \r\n  show that engaging in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death \r\n  or great bodily harm is a lesser element of homicide by child abuse.Â  Here, \r\n  Mitchell fails.Â  \r\nThe crime of homicide by child abuse only applies \r\n  in cases where the decedent is under the age of eleven whereas the application \r\n  of involuntary manslaughter is not affected by the age of the decedent.Â  Moreover, \r\n  homicide by child abuse involves child abuse or neglect; in contrariety, involuntary \r\n  manslaughter exists based on a larger number of factual predicates.Â  Indeed, \r\n  Mitchell concedes in his brief that â€œobviously involuntary manslaughter \r\n  could not be a lesser-included offense under the elements test[.]â€Â  \r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  Apodictically, homicide by child abuse does not include all \r\n  the elements of involuntary manslaughter.Â  The elements test is not met.Â  See \r\n  also State v. Elliot, 346 S.C. 603, 611, 552 S.E.2d 727, 731 (2001) \r\n  (Pleicones, J., dissenting) (observing that the legislature has created several \r\n  statutory forms of homicide, including homicide by child abuse, which â€œare not \r\n  lesser included offenses of common law murder charge because they cannot \r\n  meet the â€˜elements testâ€™ applied when the greater-lesser question involves a \r\n  common law/statutory combination.â€) (emphasis in original).\r\nOur arbitrament that involuntary manslaughter is not \r\n  a lesser included offense of homicide by child abuse is not exclusively an application \r\n  of the strict elements test.Â  The decision to create the crime of homicide by \r\n  child abuse displays the legislatureâ€™s intent to define and target a specific \r\n  societal problem.Â  See generally People v. Payne, 282 N.W.2d \r\n  456 (Mich. App. 1979) (refusing to find â€œassault with intent to do great bodily \r\n  harm less than murderâ€ a lesser included offense of criminal sexual conduct \r\n  because sexual assault is a particularly heinous form of assault and the prohibition \r\n  of these crimes serves different societal interests).Â  Legislatively, the entirely \r\n  new crime of homicide by child abuse was created instead of opting to enhance \r\n  the punishment for involuntary manslaughter.Â  In fact, a purpose given for enactment \r\n  of the statute was the â€œcreat[ion of] the felony criminal offenseâ€ of homicide \r\n  by child abuse.Â  1992 S.C. Acts 412.Â  \r\n\r\nB.Â  Historical Antecedent Test/Elliot\r\n\r\nThe utilitarian efficacy of the elements test has \r\n  been limited by our supreme court.Â  In State v. Elliott, 346 S.C. 603, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 727 (2001), the court deviated from the strict elements test and \r\n  determined that assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) \r\n  is a lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual \r\n  conduct (ACSC).Â  In this academic and erudite endeavor titled â€œan anomaly in \r\n  the law,â€ our supreme court retrocedes from the elements test:\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the elements of ABHAN and ACSC \r\n  do not meet the elements test, we recognize this situation presents an anomaly \r\n  in the law, akin to manslaughter and murder.Â  The common law does not always \r\n  fit into the neat categories we might prefer.Â  Nevertheless, we find compelling \r\n  reasons not to abandon our longstanding inclusion of ABHAN as a lesser included \r\n  offense of attempted sexual battery crimes. \r\n. . . . We recognize this holding deviates from \r\n  the strict elements test, yet decline to overrule our many cases leading to \r\n  this result.Â  Despite the existence of a few anomalies, we reiterate our commitment \r\n  to the elements test.Â  We will continue to consider offenses on a case-by-case \r\n  basis, beginning with the elements test.\r\n\r\nElliot, 346 S.C. at 607-08, 552 S.E.2d at 729-30 \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The court rooted its decision in the historical fact that \r\n  ABHAN was a lesser included charge of the precedent crime of assault with intent \r\n  to ravish.Â  Id. at 606-07, 552 S.E.2d at 729.Â  \r\nSubsequently, in State v. Watson, 349 S.C. \r\n  372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002), our supreme court declined an invitation to deviate \r\n  from the elements test on the question of whether reckless homicide was a lesser \r\n  included offense of murder.Â  Although the court had previously statedâ€”in dictumâ€”that \r\n  reckless homicide was a lesser included offense of murder, the Watson \r\n  court held:Â  â€œDespite the . . . dictum in State v. Reid, [324 \r\n  S.C. 74, 476 S.E.2d 695 (1996)], this Court has never held that reckless homicide \r\n  is a lesser included offense of murder.Â  We decline to do so.Â  We instead adhere \r\n  to the result dictated by the elements test for lesser included offenses . . \r\n  . .â€Â  Id. at 377, 563 S.E.2d at 338.\r\nIn the case sub judice, there is no \r\n  historical antecedent that suggests involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included \r\n  offense of homicide by child abuse.Â  Homicide by child abuse is a crime of relatively \r\n  recent legislatorial vintage, the statute having been promulgated in 1992.Â  \r\n  See 1992 S.C. Acts 412.Â  In departing from the elements test, the Elliot \r\n  court recounted that it had â€œconsistently incorporated ABHAN into the CSC framework \r\n  as a lesser included offense of ACSCâ€ and cited a number of cases in which it \r\n  had done so.Â  Elliot at 607, 552 S.E.2d at 729.Â  Contrastively, our courts \r\n  have never held or suggested that involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included \r\n  offense of homicide by child abuse.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Elliot involved the lesser crime \r\n  of ABHAN as it relates to ACSC.Â  The predecessor crime to ACSC was assault with \r\n  intent to ravish.Â  The Elliot court cited State v. Stewart, 283 \r\n  S.C. 104, 109, 320 S.E.2d 447, 450-51 (1984), which explicates: â€œThe statutes \r\n  dealing with rape and assault with intent to ravish were repealed by Act. No. \r\n  157 of the 1977 Acts and Joint Resolutions of the General Assembly.Â  In the \r\n  same act, the crime of criminal sexual conduct was established.â€Â  Elliot, \r\n  346 S.C. at 607, 552 S.E.2d at 729.Â  Here, there is no predecessor crime to \r\n  homicide by child abuse.Â  No statutes were repealed in its promulgation; it \r\n  takes its place amid the laws and jurisprudence of this State on a tabula \r\n  rasa.Â  Because there is no predecessor crime which homicide by child \r\n  abuse supersedes, there is no longstanding tradition from which to justify a \r\n  departure from the elements test.\r\nFinally, State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 98, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 362, 367&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) states that â€œin the context of homicide \r\n  by abuse statutes, extreme indifference is a mental state akin to intent characterized \r\n  by a deliberate act culminating in death.â€Â  Therefore, the homicide by child \r\n  abuse statute requires a type of activity similar to a deliberate act leading \r\n  to death whereas involuntary manslaughter treats situations where an unlawful \r\n  act leads to death when death would not normally have been expected.Â  \r\nThe quiddity of Mitchellâ€™s argument focuses on the fact that the standard for \r\n  homicide by child abuse is â€œextreme indifference to human lifeâ€ whereas the \r\n  standard for involuntary manslaughter is â€œreckless disregard for the safety \r\n  of others.â€Â  Mitchell contends the involuntary manslaughter standard has traditionally \r\n  been treated as a lesser included offense and an alternative where the jury \r\n  does not find â€œmaliceâ€ or â€œextreme indifference to human life.â€Â  However, this \r\n  argument withers when exposed to the light of Jarrellâ€™s definition of \r\n  extreme indifference.Â  Mitchell fails the Elliot historical antecedent \r\n  test.Â  \r\n\r\nC.Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\n\r\nThis case involves a novel issue of law.Â  Concomitantly, we look to other jurisdictions \r\n  for edification, enlightenment, and guidance.Â  Californiaâ€™s involuntary manslaughter \r\n  statute parallels South Carolinaâ€™s division between lawful and unlawful activity \r\n  except that our unlawful activity element requires the activity not naturally \r\n  tend to cause death or great bodily harm.Â  Additionally, Californiaâ€™s unlawful \r\n  activity element requires the activity not be a felony.Â  See Cal. Penal \r\n  Code Â§ 192(b) (West) (defining involuntary manslaughter as â€œthe unlawful killing \r\n  of a human being without malice . . . in the commission of an unlawful act, \r\n  not amounting to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might \r\n  produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection \r\n  . . .â€).\r\nCal. Penal Code Â§ 273ab reads:\r\n\r\nAny person who, having the care or custody of a child who is under eight years \r\n  of age, assaults the child by means of force that to a reasonable person would \r\n  be likely to produce great bodily injury, resulting in the childâ€™s death, shall \r\n  be punished by imprisonment in state prison for 25 years to life . . . .\r\n\r\nIn Orlina v. Superior Court, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 384, 386 (Cal. Ct. App. \r\n  1999), the court concluded involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included, \r\n  but a lesser related, offense of that stateâ€™s crime of â€œassault on a child under \r\n  eight years of age resulting in death.â€Â  The Orlina court held: â€œ[T]he \r\n  elements of involuntary manslaughter are not necessarily encompassed within \r\n  the elements of section 273ab.Â  Involuntary manslaughter is a lesser related \r\n  rather than a lesser included offense of the charged crime.â€Â  Orlina \r\n  at 386. While this decisionâ€™s persuasive authority is limited by some dissimilarity \r\n  in South Carolinaâ€™s and Californiaâ€™s definitions of the related crimes, we find \r\n  the decision supports our determination.Â  \r\nSimilarly, New York law buttresses our conclusion.Â  The pertinent New York \r\n  statute provides:\r\n\r\nA person is guilty of murder in the second degree when:\r\n. . . .\r\n4.Â  Under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human \r\n  life, and being eighteen years old or more the defendant recklessly engages \r\n  in conduct which creates a grave risk of serious physical injury or death to \r\n  another person less than eleven years old and thereby causes the death of such \r\n  person . . . . \r\n\r\nN.Y. Penal Â§ 125.25 (McKinney).Â  New York defines manslaughter in the second \r\n  degree as â€œrecklessly caus[ing] the death of another person.â€Â  N.Y. Penal Â§ \r\n  125.15 (McKinney).Â  In People v. Robinson, the New York Appellate Division \r\n  held:\r\n\r\n[M]anslaughter in the second degree is not a lesser included offense of murder \r\n  in the second degree under Penal Law Â§ 125.25(4).Â  Creating a grave risk of \r\n  serious physical injury is an element of Penal Law Â§ 125.25(4) but is not an \r\n  element of manslaughter in the second degree, and thus it is possible to commit \r\n  the greater crime without also committing the lesser (see, People \r\n  v. Glover, 57 N.Y.2d 61, 64, 453 N.Y.S.2d 660, 439 N.E.2d 376).Â  \r\n\r\nRobinson, 723 N.Y.S.2d 277, 277-78 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000).Â  \r\nWe find the trial judge correctly concluded, as a matter of law, \r\n  that Mitchell was not entitled to an instruction on involuntary manslaughter \r\n  as a lesser included offense of homicide by child abuse.Â  Mitchell fails both \r\n  the elements test and the Elliot historical antecedent test.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the circuit court did not commit error.Â  \r\nII.Â  Involuntary Manslaughter Is Unsupported Factually\r\nThe circuit court found the evidence did not support a charge of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter.Â  A charge on a lesser included offense is only required when the \r\n  evidence warrants such an instruction.Â  State v. Coleman, 342 S.C. 172, \r\n  175, 536 S.E.2d 387, 389&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (citing Hopper v. Evans, \r\n  456 U.S. 605, 611 (1982)).Â  The circuit court does not err in refusing to charge \r\n  a lesser included offense â€œunless there is testimony tending to show that the \r\n  defendant is only guilty of [the lesser included offense].â€Â  State v. Hollman, \r\n  245 S.C. 362, 364, 140 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1965).Â  â€œ[A]n instruction on a lesser \r\n  included offense is proper only when the charged greater offense requires that \r\n  the jury find a disputed factual element which is not a requisite for conviction \r\n  of the lesser included offense.â€Â  State v. Cude, 265 S.C. 313, 316, 218 \r\n  S.E.2d 240, 242 (1975) (citation omitted).\r\nIn this case, Mitchell \r\n  essentially argued he had no contact with Passion, except for a prior spanking, \r\n  and he simply found her unconscious on the floor.Â  These facts do not support \r\n  an application of the charge of involuntary manslaughter.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that involuntary manslaughter is NOT a lesser \r\n  included offense of homicide by child abuse based on the elements test.Â  We \r\n  rule that involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included offense of homicide \r\n  by child abuse under the Elliot antecedent test.Â  Additionally, we conclude \r\n  that this factual record does not support involuntary manslaughter as a lesser \r\n  included offense of homicide by child abuse.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3919","title":"Mulherin-Howell v.

Andrew Gowder, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam C. Cleveland, of Charleston, for Respondent\r\nMulherin-Howell.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â This appeal arises from Mulherin-Howellâ€™s (Mulherin) \r\n  suit to quiet title to property previously owned by Mulherin.Â  After competing \r\n  motions for summary judgment were filed, the trial court found Mulherin had \r\n  standing to bring the suit and Mulherinâ€™s action was not barred by any applicable \r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Additionally, the court granted summary judgment in \r\n  favor of Mulherin, Elvis and Jean Cobb, William and Patricia Rickborn, Charles \r\n  and Francis Gray, and Mulherinâ€™s individual partners (collectively, Mulherin) \r\n  on the counterclaims and third-party complaint filed by the Council of Timesharing \r\n  Interest Owners of Apartments of Sea Cabin on The Ocean III (the Council).Â  \r\n  The Council appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the mid-1980â€™s, \r\n  Mulherin developed timeshare units on the Isle of Palms in the horizontal property \r\n  regime known as Sea Cabin on the Ocean III.Â  Homeowners purchased a specific \r\n  week in a specific unit.Â  In 1987, Mulherin sold week 22 of unit 123 to the \r\n  Cobbs.Â  A deed was recorded in Charleston County.Â  The Cobbs subsequently exchanged \r\n  their first week for week 23 of unit 104.Â  No deed was given by the Cobbs back \r\n  to Mulherin for the first week.Â  A deed was prepared establishing the Cobbs \r\n  as owners of week 23 of unit 104, but it was never recorded.\r\nThe Rickborns purchased week 22 of unit 123 from Mulherin in 1989.Â  \r\n  The deed from Mulherin to the Rickborns was duly recorded.Â  The Rickborns have \r\n  continuously occupied and paid dues to the Council on their week.Â  The \r\n  Cobbs have continuously occupied and paid dues on week 23 of Unit 104.Â  The \r\n  Cobbs have never exercised ownership over week 22 of unit 123.Â  The Council \r\n  has continuously received dues from each party without questioning their right \r\n  to the property.\r\nIn 1994, the Council sued Mulherin, asserting it was not properly \r\n  paying dues on the timeshares it continued to own.Â  The parties settled the \r\n  suit in 1997.Â  As part of the settlement, Mulherin agreed to deed its unsold \r\n  units to the Council.Â  Mulherin gave the Council a quitclaim deed to \r\n  interests it held in any other units.Â  Each party signed a release, which stated: \r\n  â€œIT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that this is a full and final Release of all claims \r\n  of every nature and kind whatsoever, and releases claims that are known and \r\n  unknown, suspected and unsuspected.â€Â  In addition to the settlement, the Council, \r\n  through its attorney, agreed to â€œaccommodate dues paying contract purchasersâ€ \r\n  in regard to settling their title once the quitclaim deed was issued.Â  A letter \r\n  written by the Councilâ€™s attorney to Mulherinâ€™s attorney dated November 26, \r\n  1997, read:\r\n\r\nAs to your inquiry concerning the quitclaim deed, it was my understanding of \r\n  the settlement that this would cover unidentified weeks which might have title \r\n  problems or any retained or reversionary interests which [Mulherin] might have.Â  \r\n  Basically my client would prefer no lingering presence of [Mulherin] in the \r\n  timeshare apartments. . . . [I]t would be my expectation that the quitclaim \r\n  deed may in fact transfer nothing, but rather insure that [Mulherin has] no \r\n  further interest.Â  (Emphasis added)\r\n\r\nThereafter, according to William Rickborn, the Council advised him â€œthat the \r\n  Homeowners Association considered itself to be the owner of Unit 104, Week 23 \r\n  [by operation of the quitclaim deed from Mulherin] and that it would not cooperate \r\n  in having title to the units heretofore occupied by [Rickborn] and Mr. Cobb \r\n  clarified.â€\r\nIn 1998, Mulherin, as owner in trust of week 23 of unit 104 for the \r\n  Cobbs, brought suit against the Council to quiet title to the various units \r\n  and weeks in which deeds were not properly filed and recorded.Â  Mulherin alleged \r\n  fraud based on the representations of the Councilâ€™s attorney and contended the \r\n  Council improperly interfered with its contract with the Cobbs for them to exchange \r\n  weeks and then to deed back to Mulherin the unit, which was subsequently sold \r\n  to the Rickborns.Â  The Cobbs and Rickborns were made defendants because of their \r\n  interest in the outcome of the lawsuit. [1] Â  Mulherin did not seek any relief \r\n  from them.\r\nThe Council filed an answer denying Mulherinâ€™s claims.Â  The Council \r\n  pled affirmative defenses averring Mulherin: (1) lacked standing to bring the \r\n  suit; (2) released the Council â€œfrom the claims asserted in the Amended Complaintâ€; \r\n  and (3) could not bring the suit because it was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  The Council set forth counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and slander of title.Â  Finally, the Council \r\n  filed a third-party action against Mulherinâ€™s individual partners for conspiracy.Â  \r\n  Because Charles M. Mulherin had died, his estate was named as a party.\r\nEach party filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.Â  The \r\n  trial court considered all motions as motions for summary judgment.Â  The court \r\n  found Mulherin had standing to bring the suit.Â  The court concluded there \r\n  was no breach of the settlement agreement by Mulherin as it properly presented \r\n  a quitclaim deed to the Council and the nature of a quitclaim deed is that there \r\n  is no warranty made as to the quality of the title being transferred.\r\nAs to the Councilâ€™s other claims, the court ruled: (1) the counterclaim failed \r\n  to properly allege all nine elements of fraud; and (2) there is no evidence \r\n  the Council did not or could not know of the existence of title problems with \r\n  respect to the Cobbs and Rickborns.Â  On the claim for slander of title, the \r\n  court determined it was premature to bring the action as a counterclaim in the \r\n  same action which serves as the basis of the claim because it can only be based \r\n  upon a lawsuit in which a party prevails.Â  The court found no special damages \r\n  or malice were pled by the Council.Â  As to the Councilâ€™s third-party \r\n  complaint alleging the individual partners of Mulherin engaged in a conspiracy \r\n  with respect to how the timeshare units were originally sold, the court held \r\n  the events involved took place prior to the 1997 release signed by the parties \r\n  and, therefore, were barred.Â  The court granted summary judgment in favor of \r\n  Mulherin as to the Councilâ€™s counterclaims and third-party complaint.\r\nThe court denied the Councilâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to Mulherinâ€™s \r\n  claims.Â  The court declared Mulherin had standing to bring the action, the claims \r\n  were not barred by the release as the purported actions took place after the \r\n  signing of the release, and the claims were not barred by â€œany applicable statute \r\n  of limitations.â€\r\nThe Council filed a motion pursuant to Rules 52(b) and 59(e), SCRCP, averring: \r\n  (1) the court erred in determining Mulherin had standing; (2) there was an issue \r\n  of material fact related to the Release and what claims it barred; (3) the complaint \r\n  alleged special damages as to the conspiracy claim; and (4) the claim for slander \r\n  of title should not have been dismissed.Â  The court denied the motion.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant \r\n  of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard \r\n  which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper \r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement \r\n  Co., 360 S.C. 366, 601 S.E.2d 342 (2004); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. \r\n  Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004); Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship \r\n  v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 \r\n  S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 \r\n  S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to \r\n  the jury.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d \r\n  830 (Ct. App. 2002); Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 \r\n  S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Belton v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 360 S.C. 575, 602 \r\n  S.E.2d 389 (2004); McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. \r\n  372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004); Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Higgins \r\n  v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 592, 486 S.E.2d 269 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (noting that when ruling on motion for summary judgment, trial judge must \r\n  consider all of documents and evidence within record, including pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits).Â  â€œOn appeal \r\n  from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all \r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in \r\n  a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€Â  Ferguson v. Charleston \r\n  Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002); see \r\n  also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (noting that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from \r\n  the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not \r\n  appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to \r\n  clarify the application of the law.Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., \r\n  341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 \r\n  S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Summary judgment should not be granted \r\n  even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is disagreement \r\n  concerning the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.Â  Moriarty v. Garden \r\n  Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000); Ellis v. \r\n  Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, \r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, \r\n  summary judgment should be granted.Â  Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. \r\n  Co., 348 S.C. 340, 559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001); Pye v. Aycock, \r\n  325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe party seeking summary \r\n  judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact.Â  McCall, 359 S.C. at 376, 597 S.E.2d at 183.Â  Once \r\n  the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an \r\n  absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot \r\n  simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions \r\n  Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Rather, \r\n  the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a \r\n  genuine issue for trial.Â  Ellis, 358 S.C. at 518-19, 595 S.E.2d at 822; \r\n  Peterson v. West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\nThe purpose of summary \r\n  judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services \r\n  of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); \r\n  Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be \r\n  cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a \r\n  trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters \r\n  Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins, 358 S.C. \r\n  at 289, 594 S.E.2d at 561-62; Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 743 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the circuit court err in finding Mulherin had \r\n  standing to bring the underlying action?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the circuit court err in concluding Mulherinâ€™s action was not \r\n  barred by any applicable statute of limitations?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment in favor \r\n  of Mulherin where there are genuine issues of material fact?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  STANDING\r\nThe Council argues the court erred in finding Mulherin had standing \r\n  to bring the underlying action.Â  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff must have standing to institute an action.Â  Joytime \r\n  Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 528 S.E.2d 647 (1999); \r\n  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n  To have standing, one must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the \r\n  lawsuit.Â Â  Sea Pines Assâ€™n for the Prot. of Wildlife, Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 550 S.E.2d 287 (2001); Evins v. \r\n  Richland County Historic Pres. Commâ€™n, 341 S.C. 15, 532 S.E.2d 876 (2000); \r\n  Newman v. Richland County Historic Pres. Commâ€™n, 325 S.C. 79, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  72 (1997).Â  One must be a real party in interest.Â  Charleston County Sch. \r\n  Dist. v. Charleston County Election Commâ€™n, 336 S.C. 174, 519 S.E.2d 567 \r\n  (1999); see also Henry v. Horry County, 334 S.C. 461, 463 n.1, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 122, 123 n.1 (1999) (â€œTo have standing, one must be a real party \r\n  in interest.â€).Â  A real party in interest is one who has a real, material, or \r\n  substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to one \r\n  who has only a nominal or technical interest in the action.Â  Charleston County \r\n  Sch. Dist., 336 S.C. at 181, 519 S.E.2d at 571; see also Anchor \r\n  Point, Inc. v. Shoals Sewer Co., 308 S.C. 422, 428, 418 S.E.2d 546, 549 \r\n  (1992) (holding a party has standing to sue if the party has â€œa real, material, \r\n  or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to . \r\n  . . only a nominal or technical interest in the actionâ€); Huff v. Jennings, \r\n  319 S.C. 142, 148, 459 S.E.2d 886, 890 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA real party in interest \r\n  is one who has a real, actual, material or substantial interest in the subject \r\n  matter of the action, as distinguished from one who has only a nominal, formal, \r\n  or technical interest in, or connection with, the action.â€) (internal quotations \r\n  omitted).\r\nThe Council maintains McLeod v. Baptiste, 315 S.C. 246, 433 S.E.2d 834 \r\n  (1993), and Shaw v. Hardy, 270 S.C. 298, 241 S.E.2d 906 (1978), are determinative \r\n  in this case.Â  In McLeod, the court concluded a â€œgrantor lacks standing \r\n  to enforce a covenant against a remote grantee when the grantor no longer owns \r\n  real property which would benefit from the enforcement of that restrictive covenant.â€Â  \r\n  McLeod, 315 S.C. at 247, 433 S.E.2d at 835.Â  Thus, McLeod is distinguishable.\r\nIn Shaw, a claim of title to property was brought by Shaw against Hardy. [2] Â  The Shaw court noted: \r\n  â€œHardy does not claim, nor is there any indication that he could claim, any \r\n  interest in the property.Â  Indeed, Hardy expressly gave up any interest he may \r\n  have had in the property in question by conveying that interest to the Martinâ€™s \r\n  Lake Club prior to the institution of this suit.â€Â  Id. at 300, 241 S.E.2d \r\n  at 907.Â  The court concluded Hardy was not a proper party to the lawsuit.Â  The \r\n  court explicated:\r\n\r\nIt is true that Hardy may have an â€œinterestâ€ in the placement of the boundary \r\n  line in the sense that he may be concerned with its ultimate placement and his \r\n  potential liability, if any, to his grantee but this does not give him any adverse \r\n  claim to the property claimed by Shaw so as to bring him within the purview \r\n  of the statutes above quoted.Â  Having parted with any interest in, or claim \r\n  to, this property and there being no showing of his having reacquired any interest \r\n  in it, Hardy was neither a necessary nor proper party defendant and his motion \r\n  for summary judgment should have been granted. \r\n  [3] \r\n\r\nId. at 300-01, 241 S.E.2d at 907.Â  Shaw is inapposite because \r\n  Mulherin is claiming an interest in week 23 for unit 104, unlike Hardy who had \r\n  disclaimed all interests adverse to Shaw.\r\nIn the instant case, Mulherin claims to be in possession of one of the weeks, \r\n  specifically week 23 of unit 104.Â  In the amended complaint, Mulherin maintained \r\n  it holds the unit in constructive trust for the Cobbs pursuant to prior agreement, \r\n  which allowed the Cobbs to exchange weeks.Â  Additionally, Mulherin has an interest \r\n  in enforcing its contracts with both the Cobbs and Rickborns in which it alleges \r\n  the Council is interfering.Â  The circuit court found:\r\n\r\n[Mulherin] clearly has an interest in the dispute because of the potential exposure \r\n  it may have to the third parties if the [Council] succeed[s] in dispossessing \r\n  those to whom [Mulherin] sold the units.Â  [Mulherin] has an interest in the \r\n  effect of the quitclaim deed which it provided to the [Council].Â  Therefore, \r\n  [Mulherin] is a real party in interest and does have standing to enforce the \r\n  rights that arise out of its contract of settlement with and/or quitclaim deed \r\n  to the [Council].\r\n\r\nMulherin is â€œa real party in interest.â€Â  Apodictically, the trial court correctly \r\n  determined Mulherin had standing to bring the instant action.\r\nII.Â  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\r\nThe Council contends the trial court erred in failing to find Mulherinâ€™s \r\n  claims were barred by any applicable statute of limitations because the events \r\n  underlying the action occurred not in 1998, when the suit was filed, but in \r\n  1987-1989 when the titles to week 23 of unit 104 and week 22 of unit 123 were \r\n  originally conveyed with problems.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note \r\n  the Council failed to cite any supporting authority for this position.Â  Further, \r\n  all arguments made are merely conclusory statements.Â  Concomitantly, the Council \r\n  abandoned the issue on appeal and it need not be addressed by this court.Â  See \r\n  First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (stating \r\n  Appellant was deemed to have abandoned issue for which he failed to provide \r\n  any argument or supporting authority); R&amp;G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry \r\n  Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 540 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2000) (declaring \r\n  an issue is deemed abandoned if argument in appellate brief is only conclusory).\r\nEven if properly presented, the issue fails on the merits.Â  The events \r\n  giving rise to the underlying action occurred after Mulherin gave a quitclaim \r\n  deed to the Council for any interest it may own.Â  The bulk of Mulherinâ€™s claims \r\n  were to correct title after the Council alleged ownership of week 23 of unit \r\n  104.Â  William Rickborn filed an affidavit indicating the Council refused to \r\n  recognize his ownership over week 22 of unit 103 and had frustrated the process \r\n  of the Cobbs signing over that week and taking week 23 of unit 104 as agreed \r\n  upon with Mulherin.Â  These claims could not have been brought until after the \r\n  1997 agreement and the quitclaim deed were filed.\r\nOther claims are based upon representations made by the attorney \r\n  for the Council regarding the settlement agreement.Â  Indubitably, these claims \r\n  could not have been brought in 1989, as the Council claims, because the representations \r\n  were not made until 1997.Â  The trial court properly concluded Mulherinâ€™s claims \r\n  against the Council were based on events that occurred no earlier than 1997.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the action brought in 1998 is not barred by any applicable statute \r\n  of limitations.\r\nIII.Â  SUMMARY JUDGMENT\r\nThe Council avers the trial court erred in granting Mulherinâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment as to its counterclaims for breach of contract, breach \r\n  of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and slander of title.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the Council complains the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on \r\n  its claim for conspiracy.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the Council \r\n  failed to cite any supporting authority for its position.Â  All arguments made \r\n  are merely conclusory statements.Â  Consequently, the Council abandoned the issue \r\n  on appeal and we need not consider it.Â  See Medical Univ. of South \r\n  Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004) (noting that failure \r\n  to provide arguments or supporting authority for an issue renders it abandoned); \r\n  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999) \r\n  (declaring that conclusory arguments may be treated as abandoned).Â  Second, \r\n  even if this issue was properly raised, it would fail on the merits.\r\nA.Â  Breach of Contract\r\nOn the breach of contract claim, the Council argues the jury â€œmay \r\n  well have regarded the settlement agreement as a bar to [Mulherinâ€™s] initiation \r\n  of this lawsuit.â€Â  However, this in no way refutes the trial courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that the agreement required a quitclaim deed and did not require a warranty \r\n  as to the title being transferred between the parties.Â  A quitclaim deed does \r\n  not guarantee the quality of title, but only conveys that which the grantor \r\n  may lawfully convey.Â  See Martin v. Ragsdale, 71 S.C. 67, 50 S.E. \r\n  671 (1905).\r\nIf the Council is maintaining Mulherin breached the contract and \r\n  settlement by bringing the lawsuit after â€œreleasing all claims,â€ we find this \r\n  argument meritless.Â  The release did not explicitly bar claims brought subsequent \r\n  to the date of the release.Â  It does not operate as a bar to the claims brought \r\n  by Mulherin because those claims arose after the settlement agreement and subsequent \r\n  deeds were filed.\r\nB.Â  Fraud\r\nThe only claim \r\n  regarding fraud made by the Council in its brief is â€œ[t]he trial court is in \r\n  error when it states that the complaint does not set forth the nine elements \r\n  of fraud.Â  It does. . . . The other statements regarding this cause of action \r\n  are matters of fact which present questions of fact for the jury.â€Â  These statements \r\n  fail to edify this court as to any evidence in the record to dispute the findings \r\n  made by the circuit court.\r\nThe judge specifically found the Council failed to offer evidence \r\n  of a representation made by Mulherin upon which the Council either relied or \r\n  had a right to rely.Â  The Council alleged in its counterclaim: â€œThe representation \r\n  that [Mulherin] would convey without disclosure of secret deeds and encumbrances \r\n  was material and false and known by [Mulherin] to be false or recklessly made \r\n  since some of the property to be transferred had already been secretly transferred \r\n  or encumbered by [Mulherin].â€Â  Yet, as the trial court determined, the Council \r\n  knew or should have known of the confusion regarding title to week 22 of unit \r\n  123 and week 23 of unit 104.Â  Both owners had been paying dues for years on \r\n  the respective weeks.Â  The Council, through its attorney, agreed to â€œaccommodate \r\n  dues paying contract purchasersâ€ in regard to settling their title once the \r\n  quitclaim deed was issued.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly concluded no \r\n  representation was made upon which the Council had a right to rely, as it knew \r\n  there were problems with the title and agreed to accommodate some owners whose \r\n  titles had problems.\r\nC.Â  Slander of Title\r\nThe only claim the Council makes in its brief regarding slander of \r\n  title is â€œ[t]his also presents facts for the jury for no discovery has been \r\n  taken prior to hearing in this matter.â€Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the \r\n  application of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., \r\n  336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, the Council never moved \r\n  for a continuance to conduct discovery, nor was this issue ever raised to the \r\n  trial court.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  See \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt \r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but \r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for \r\n  appellate review.â€).\r\nOn the merits, the slander of title claim is based upon the filing \r\n  of the pleadings in the underlying matter.Â  The Council has not established \r\n  a proper basis for the claim.Â  See Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, \r\n  351 S.C. 1, 567 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding judicial proceedings are \r\n  privileged and cannot form the basis of a claim for slander of title).\r\nD.Â  Conspiracy\r\nThe allegations in the third-party claim of conspiracy all relate \r\n  to the sale of shares in Sea Cabins by Mulherin and its partners.Â  The Council \r\n  asserted the individual partners of Mulherin engaged in a conspiracy with respect \r\n  to how the timeshare units were originally sold.Â  As a result of the settlement \r\n  agreement, Mulherin transferred all of its properties to the Council.Â  The allegations \r\n  do not state it continued to sell any properties after the transfer.Â  Without \r\n  question, these sales all took place prior to the settlement agreement between \r\n  Mulherin and the Council.Â  Concomitantly, the release barred all claims which \r\n  either party had at the time of the settlement.Â  The trial court properly found \r\n  the conspiracy claim was barred by the release.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the trial court properly found Mulherin was a real party \r\n  in interest and had standing to bring the action.Â  We hold the action brought \r\n  by Mulherin was not barred by any applicable statute of limitations.Â  Finally, \r\n  we conclude the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Mulherin on \r\n  the Councilâ€™s counterclaims and third-party complaint.Â  Accordingly, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    By consent order, Charles A.

Potts, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nGary Hudson Smith, III, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â  Amy P. Lacke (Amy) initiated \r\n  this action against Michael R. Lacke (Michael) to enforce a Joint Parenting \r\n  Agreement (the agreement) entered into by the parties and made part of an Illinois \r\n  courtâ€™s order of divorce.Â  Amy appeals a South Carolina courtâ€™s construction \r\n  and enforcement of the agreement.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAmy and Michael were divorced by decree \r\n  of an Illinois court filed in February 1990.Â  The Illinois court incorporated \r\n  the Joint Parenting Agreement into its order. Â The following provision encompassed \r\n  the partiesâ€™ duties regarding college funding for their children:\r\n\r\nThe parties shall utilize their best efforts for the payment \r\n  of the childrenâ€™s college education, which obligation is predicated upon the \r\n  scholastic aptitude of the child and the parties current respective financial \r\n  abilities.Â  The decision affecting the education of the child, including the \r\n  choice of college or other institution, shall be made jointly by the parties \r\n  and shall consider the expressed preference of the child, but neither party \r\n  shall unreasonably withhold his or her consent to the expressed preference of \r\n  the child.Â  Said college tuition shall be subject to the childrenâ€™s application \r\n  for grants and scholarships and both parties shall timely cooperate in completing \r\n  any financial aid forms to secure any said funds for higher education.Â  \r\n\r\nAmy brought this action to enforce Michaelâ€™s \r\n  obligation to contribute to their daughter Lauraâ€™s college education.Â  At the \r\n  time of trial, Laura had completed approximately two years of college.Â  During \r\n  the hearing, it was determined Michael had only contributed approximately $1,550 \r\n  toward Lauraâ€™s education.Â  Amy testified she contributed roughly $8,300 toward \r\n  Lauraâ€™s education expenses, although some of these payments were for automobile \r\n  expenses incurred by Laura.Â  \r\nAccording to their financial declarations, \r\n  Michael and Amy had gross incomes of $88,392 and $46,440 per year, respectively.Â  \r\n  Michael previously made as much as $140,000 per year.Â  Additionally, he makes \r\n  child support payments for two other children from his second and third marriages.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court found the provision requiring \r\n  the parties to pay for college was ambiguous, and therefore, considered the \r\n  partiesâ€™ intent in making the agreement to determine the partiesâ€™ responsibilities \r\n  and obligations thereunder.Â  The court concluded: (1) transportation expenditures \r\n  were not part of the expenses contemplated by the agreement; (2) Laura was obligated \r\n  to apply for loans; (3) the parties were only required to pay toward Lauraâ€™s \r\n  expenses after she applied for loans and after her income had been considered; \r\n  (4) Michael and Amy were to bear equally any amount owed for Lauraâ€™s education; \r\n  and (5) Michael was to reimburse Amy his share of the expenses within thirty \r\n  days. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court may find \r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Emery v. Smith, ___S.C.___, 603 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Rutherford \r\n  v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992)).Â  However, this broad \r\n  scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  \r\n  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux \r\n  v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981); \r\n  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999); see \r\n  also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (ruling that because the appellate court lacks \r\n  the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great \r\n  deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in construing the Joint \r\n  Parenting Agreement?\r\n  \r\nA.Â  Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding the agreement \r\n  is ambiguous? \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding transportation \r\n  costs are not college expenses under the agreement?\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding the agreement \r\n  requires Laura to incur loans and allocate her income toward her college expenses?\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding the agreement \r\n  requires Amy and Michael to share Lauraâ€™s education expenses equally?Â  \r\n  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in allowing Michael thirty \r\n  days in which to reimburse Amy for any amount owed?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in failing to award Amy \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Construction of the Agreement\r\nA parent may contractually obligate himself \r\n  to pay educational expenses beyond the age of majority.Â  Ellis v. Taylor, \r\n  316 S.C. 245, 449 S.E.2d 487 (1994).Â  Construction of such an agreement is a \r\n  matter of contract law.Â  Id.Â  Generally, where an agreement is clear \r\n  and capable of legal interpretation, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret \r\n  its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the \r\n  agreement, and give effect to it.Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 \r\n  S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001); Bogan v. Bogan, 298 S.C. 139, 378 S.E.2d \r\n  606 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  When an agreement is unambiguous, effect should be given \r\n  according to the ordinary and popular sense of the words employed therein.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Warner v. Weader, 280 S.C. 81, 311 S.E.2d 78 (1983) \r\n  (providing that an unambiguous contract must be construed according to the terms \r\n  which the parties have used, to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, \r\n  and popular sense); see also Heins, 344 S.C. at 158, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  at 230 (â€œThe court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, \r\n  regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard \r\n  their rights carefully.â€). \r\nHowever, where an agreement is ambiguous, the court \r\n  should seek to determine the partiesâ€™ intent.Â  Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. \r\n  331, 465 S.E.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1995); Mattox v. Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, \r\n  344 S.E.2d 620 (Ct. App. 1986); see also Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 \r\n  S.C. 329, 491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997) (explaining unambiguous marital agreements \r\n  will be enforced in accordance with their terms, while ambiguous agreements \r\n  will be examined in same manner as other agreements in order to determine intention \r\n  of parties).Â  â€œA contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning \r\n  or when its meaning is unclear.â€Â  Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, \r\n  295, 543 S.E.2d 271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Construction of an ambiguous contract \r\n  is a question of fact.Â  Skull Creek Club Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Cook &amp; Book, \r\n  Inc., 313 S.C. 283, 437 S.E.2d 163 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Ambiguity\r\n\r\nIn McDuffie v. McDuffie, 313 S.C. \r\n  397, 438 S.E.2d 239 (1993), the South Carolina Supreme Court found â€œthe words \r\n  â€˜all college expenses,â€™ without more, [are] patently ambiguous.â€Â  McDuffie, \r\n  313 S.C. at 400, 438 S.E.2d at 241.Â  In the instant case, the first clause of \r\n  the original agreement is patently ambiguous.Â  It states:Â  â€œThe parties shall \r\n  utilize their best efforts for the payment of the childrenâ€™s college education, \r\n  which obligation is predicated upon the scholastic aptitude of the child and \r\n  the parties current respective financial abilities.â€Â  It fails to define college \r\n  education, or delineate which expenses should be paid for by the parties.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we agree with the trial court that the agreement is ambiguous as to the expenses \r\n  encompassed by the phrase â€œcollege education.â€Â  The court properly sought to \r\n  determine the intent of the parties.Â  See Mattox v. Cassady, 289 \r\n  S.C. 57, 344 S.E.2d 620 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Expenses Covered\r\n\r\nAmy contends the trial court erred in \r\n  finding transportation costs were not included as college education expenses.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe agreement is vague as to which expenses qualify \r\n  as â€œcollege educationâ€ costs.Â  McDuffie, 313 S.C. 397, 438 S.E.2d 239, \r\n  illustrates when transportation costs may be covered by an otherwise ambiguous \r\n  agreement to pay for a childâ€™s college education.Â  In McDuffie, the court \r\n  determined that transportation was not an expense intended to be covered by \r\n  the fatherâ€™s agreement â€œto pay all expenses associated with [the] college education \r\n  of any of said children . . . .â€ Id. at 398, 438 S.E.2d at 240.Â  The \r\n  court noted that â€œin her testimony, Mother defined college expenses as â€˜tuition, \r\n  room, and board . . . books or supplies,â€™ and advised that she was willing to \r\n  pay for transportation.â€Â  Id. at 400, 438 S.E.2d at 241.Â  Thus, the court \r\n  gave credence to the partiesâ€™ testimony of their intent in making the agreement.\r\nHere, there is no evidence establishing \r\n  the partiesâ€™ intent regarding the inclusion of transportation as a college expense.Â  \r\n  During cross-examination, Amy professed:\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  But you agree with Mr. Lackeâ€”he says nothing about \r\n  covering transportation expenses?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I disagree.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  So, where it says payment for the childrenâ€™s college \r\n  education your understanding of that is to mean transportation and everything \r\n  else?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  There are many other things that Iâ€™ve read about \r\n  the law in Illinois and it always includes transportation as part of that.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  But thatâ€™s not in this agreement, \r\n  is it?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  It is in that agreement.Â  I think it is implicit \r\n  in that agreement.Â  \r\n\r\nCritically, this discussion does not edify as to \r\n  the partiesâ€™ intent in signing the agreementâ€”it only demonstrates Amyâ€™s desire \r\n  that transportation now be covered and her misunderstanding of Illinois law.Â  \r\n\r\nIn her brief, Amy points to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/513 as \r\n  grounds for inclusion of transportation costs in education expenses.Â  The statute \r\n  provides, in relevant part:Â  \r\n\r\nThe educational expenses may include, but shall \r\n  not be limited to, room, board, dues, tuition, transportation, books, \r\n  fees, registration and application costs, medical expenses including medical \r\n  insurance, dental expenses, and living expenses during the school year and periods \r\n  of recess, which sums may be ordered payable to the child, to either parent, \r\n  or to the educational institution, directly or through a special account or \r\n  trust created for that purpose, as the court sees fit.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).Â  This statute, however, lends \r\n  no great benefit to Amy.Â  \r\nNothing in the agreement indicates it \r\n  is to include transportation costs.Â  The statute uses the word â€œmay,â€ which \r\n  merely indicates transportation expenditures are not prohibited from inclusion \r\n  as an education-related expense.Â  The agreement does not reference the statute, \r\n  and neither party expressed intent that a vehicle be a covered cost of Lauraâ€™s \r\n  education; therefore, the trial judge was within his discretion in ruling that \r\n  transportation expenses are not covered in the agreement.Â  See McPherson \r\n  v. J. E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183, 33 S.E.2d 501 (1945) (providing \r\n  that words cannot be read into a contract which import intent wholly unexpressed \r\n  when the contract was executed). \r\nPresented with a dearth of evidence from which \r\n  to glean the intent of parties, the trial judge ruled the following to be covered \r\n  expenses: â€œ1. tuition; 2. room; 3. board; 4. books; and 5. supplies.â€Â  We find \r\n  no error in the determination that the parties did not intend to include transportation \r\n  costs as an expense covered under the agreement.\r\n\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Loan and Work Requirements\r\n\r\nThe trial court concluded that Laura was \r\n  required to incur debt in the form of student loans and to work to support herself \r\n  prior to the parties being responsible for any payment of her college expenses.Â  \r\n  Amy contends this was error, and we agree.\r\nWhile the agreement is ambiguous as to \r\n  precisely which expenses are to be included under â€œcollege education,â€ the agreement \r\n  is unequivocal as to who is to pay the expenses.Â  Consequently, the courtâ€™s \r\n  only function was to enforce the agreement according to its terms.Â  See \r\n  Heins, 344 S.C. at 158, 543 S.E.2d at 230 (â€œUnambiguous marital agreements \r\n  will be enforced according to their terms.â€).Â  \r\nThe agreement makes clear that Laura should incur \r\n  no cost for her education.Â  Although the agreement requires her to apply for \r\n  scholarships and grants, neither type of financial aid requires reimbursement, \r\n  and certainly neither requires her to assume debt and make payments of principal \r\n  and interest.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has considered a similar clause \r\n  in an agreement to pay for college expenses:Â  â€œThe agreement states that Father \r\n  will pay all reasonable expenses â€˜to the extent that such expenses are not provided \r\n  by any scholarship, grant or other assistance available to the children.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994).Â Â  The \r\n  court announced:Â  \r\n\r\nWhen words of particular and specific meaning are followed \r\n  by general words, the general words are construed to embrace only persons or \r\n  things of the same general kind or class as those enumerated.Â  See Swanigan \r\n  v. American Natâ€™l Red Cross, 313 S.C. 416, 438 S.E.2d 251 (1993).Â  The forms \r\n  of â€œassistanceâ€ enumerated in the agreement are all within the same general \r\n  class of programs that do not require repayment.Â  We find â€œother assistanceâ€ \r\n  does not include loans that require repayment.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThe provision in question here does not \r\n  include loans or even â€œother assistanceâ€ as a category.Â  It simply and unquestionably \r\n  limits Lauraâ€™s contributions to scholarships and grants, and it was error to \r\n  oblige her to incur debt where no such requirement exists in the agreement.Â Â  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the agreement does not require that \r\n  Laura work to support herself through college before the parties are required \r\n  to contribute.Â  The agreement provides: â€œThe parties shall utilize their \r\n  best efforts for the payment of the childrenâ€™s college education, which obligation \r\n  is predicated upon the scholastic aptitude of the child and the parties current \r\n  respective financial abilities.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The agreement places \r\n  only the requirement of scholastic aptitude upon the child.Â  The partiesâ€™ financial \r\n  ability and best efforts are to be considered, but no reference is made to Lauraâ€™s \r\n  ability to pay or her financial condition.Â  In Ellis, the supreme court \r\n  â€œreverse[d] the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that . . . [the childâ€™s] ability to \r\n  contribute reduced Fatherâ€™s obligation to pay.â€Â  316 S.C. at 248, 449 S.E.2d \r\n  at 488.Â  Lucidly, when a party enters into an agreement to pay for his childâ€™s \r\n  education, the terms of that agreement control the rights and obligations of \r\n  the party. \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s comments during a colloquy with \r\n  the attorneys indicates an error in its determination.Â  The court explained:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nWell, over time I have found that that is the big dilemma \r\n  in all of these cases.Â  This one may be a little different because youâ€™ve got \r\n  an Illinois agreement, but thatâ€™s the big dilemma in all of these cases.Â  It \r\n  is getting more and more difficult to show need.Â  I have had two or three of \r\n  these lately, and Iâ€™ve noticed overall it is getting more and more difficult, \r\n  I suppose, as there are more grants, scholarships, and loans available.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe agreement included no provision for the establishment \r\n  of need, and neither party indicated intent that Laura demonstrate need prior \r\n  to the parties being required to pay for her education.Â  For the court to include \r\n  need as a requirement is a significant modification of the Illinois order and \r\n  is not allowed under section 20-7-1152 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003), \r\n  because Illinois has exclusive jurisdiction under the Uniform Interstate Family \r\n  Support Act (UIFSA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-960 and â€“1010 (Supp. 2003).Â  See \r\n  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 207-08, 522 S.E.2d 835, 841 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (providing a detailed and extensive summation of UIFSA statutes and requirements).\r\nFurthermore, this case is governed by the partiesâ€™ \r\n  agreement.Â  Consequently, Risinger v. Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 253 S.E.2d \r\n  652 (1979), is inapplicable.Â  Pursuant to Risinger, the family court \r\n  may order a parent to pay for a childâ€™s college education where no agreement \r\n  to pay exists.Â  The Risinger court held:\r\n\r\n[A] family court judge may require a parent to contribute \r\n  that amount of money necessary to enable a child over 18 to attend high school \r\n  and four years of college, where, as here, there is evidence that: (1) the characteristics \r\n  of the child indicate that he or she will benefit from college; (2) the child \r\n  demonstrates the ability to do well, or at least make satisfactory grades; (3) \r\n  the child cannot otherwise go to school; and (4) the parent has the financial \r\n  ability to help pay for such an education.\r\n\r\nId. at 39, 253 S.E.2d at 653-54.Â  \r\nSubsequently, in Hughes v. Hughes, \r\n  280 S.C. 388, 313 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 1984), this Court elaborated upon the \r\n  third prong of the Risinger test.Â  We adjudged that \r\n\r\n[a]mong the factors to be considered in determining whether \r\n  and to what extent financial assistance for college is necessary are the availability \r\n  of grants and loans and the ability of a child to earn income during the school \r\n  year or on vacation.Â  [Citation omitted].Â  We find these factors relevant because \r\n  an emancipated child has a duty to help minimize college expenses when a parentâ€™s \r\n  financial support for these expenses is sought through the family courts.\r\n\r\nId. at 391, 313 S.E.2d at 33-34.Â  See \r\n  generally Nicholson v. Lewis, 295 S.C. 434, 369 S.E.2d 649 (Ct. App. \r\n  1988) (finding trial court properly required father to pay a portion of daughterâ€™s \r\n  remaining educational expenses where daughter worked full time during summer \r\n  breaks, helped with the upkeep of her automobile, was searching for part time \r\n  work during the school year, and had obtained grants and student loans); Kelly \r\n  v. Kelly, 310 S.C. 299, 301, 423 S.E.2d 153, 154 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding \r\n  the family court erred by requiring mother to contribute to sonâ€™s college expenses \r\n  where son â€œmade no attempt whatever to apply for educational loans.â€).\r\nHowever, Risinger and Hughes \r\n  have no application to situations where a parent voluntarily binds himself in \r\n  an agreement to assume a childâ€™s college expenses.Â  When such an agreement exists, \r\n  the child is under no obligation to minimize expenses, incur student loans, \r\n  or apply her own income to pay for college unless the agreement so provides.Â  \r\n  See McDuffie v. McDuffie, 313 S.C. 397, 438 S.E.2d 239 (1993).Â  \r\n  Here, the agreement unambiguously places the burden to pay for Lauraâ€™s education \r\n  exclusively on Michael and Amy.Â  It was error to hold otherwise.Â Â  \r\n\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Partiesâ€™ Shares of Expenses\r\n\r\nThe trial court found each party should \r\n  be equally responsible for the remaining costs of Lauraâ€™s education after applicable \r\n  sources have been exhausted.Â  Amy argues the court erred by placing an equal \r\n  burden on the parties.Â  We agree.\r\nThe agreement, without ambiguity, mandates \r\n  that the parties bear the burden of Lauraâ€™s education costsâ€”not equally, but \r\n  according to their respective abilities.Â  The agreement provides:Â  â€œThe parties \r\n  shall utilize their best efforts for the payment of the childrenâ€™s college education, \r\n  which obligation is predicated upon . . . the parties current respective \r\n  financial abilities.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The trial court did not set forth \r\n  any findings regarding the partiesâ€™ current financial abilities.Â  Nor did the \r\n  court explain the evidence upon which it was relying in finding an equal division \r\n  appropriate.\r\nAfter our full review of the evidence, \r\n  we conclude an equal division of Lauraâ€™s education costs is unfair, inappropriate, \r\n  and fails to give effect to partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  The agreement predicates each \r\n  partyâ€™s obligation to bear the cost of Lauraâ€™s education upon that partyâ€™s respective \r\n  ability to pay.Â  Concomitantly, enforcement of the agreement requires analysis \r\n  of Amy and Michaelâ€™s economic conditions.Â  An equal sharing of the expenses \r\n  could only be supported by finding an equal ability to pay.Â  \r\nThe financial declarations reveal that Michaelâ€™s \r\n  annual gross income at the time of trial was approximately $88,392.Â  Amyâ€™s total \r\n  income, including sums received for child and spousal support, amounted to $46,440 \r\n  per year.Â  However, Michael confessed that when Laura began college, his annual \r\n  income was â€œprobably 130 to 140,000 a year.â€Â  \r\nThe Illinois Appellate Court has found all aspects \r\n  of a partyâ€™s financial condition should be considered in reaching a conclusion \r\n  regarding their ability to pay college expenses.Â  In re Marriage of Drysch, \r\n  732 N.E.2d 125 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000).Â  The order is from an Illinois court, and \r\n  Illinois continues to retain continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the order.Â  \r\n  See Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 207-08, 522 S.E.2d 835, 841 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999) (explaining where a foreign jurisdiction has entered an order \r\n  and this state does not have grounds for accepting exclusive jurisdiction, the \r\n  continuing exclusive jurisdiction will remain in the issuing state); S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1000 and â€“1010 (Supp. 2003).Â  Therefore, the trial court should \r\n  have looked to Illinois law for determination of the partiesâ€™ rights and responsibilities \r\n  under the order.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1138(A) (Supp. 2003) (establishing \r\n  law of the issuing state governs the nature, extent, amount, and duration of \r\n  current payments and other obligations of support).Â  \r\nIn Drysch, the Illinois court concluded \r\n  the income of a partyâ€™s new spouse should be included as part of his or her \r\n  ability to pay if that money is pooled and used to support each spouse.Â  732 \r\n  N.E.2d at 129.Â  At trial, Michael declared that his new wife earned â€œ[a]pproximately \r\n  $58,000 a year.â€Â  Additionally, in Greiman v. Friedman, 414 N.E.2d 77 \r\n  (Ill. App. Ct. 1980), the Illinois Appellate Court found fatherâ€™s expenses in \r\n  raising a second family should be considered.Â  Id. at 82-84.Â  \r\nThese numbers reveal substantial disparity between \r\n  the financial abilities of Michael and Amy.Â  Based on the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  gross incomes of $88,392 and $46,440, we require Michael to pay 66% of Lauraâ€™s \r\n  education expenses, with Amy bearing the burden of 34%.Â  We remand to the trial \r\n  court for a determination of the amount of expenses incurred by Laura, including \r\n  expenses related to her having to assume debt to pay for school, which remained \r\n  after her receipt of scholarships and grants.Â  The parties shall be responsible \r\n  for this amount pursuant to the division set forth in this opinion, and the \r\n  trial court shall enter an order setting forth the amount owed by each party.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  When Payment Required\r\nThe agreement does not provide a time frame for \r\n  paying education costs.Â  It simply requires payment of the expenses.Â  At the \r\n  time of the hearing, Laura had completed two years of schooling and incurred \r\n  two years worth of debt and expenses, which should have been paid by Amy and \r\n  Michael.Â  It was error for the court not to require immediate payment of any \r\n  amount owed by Michael for the years already completed by Laura.\r\nAccording to Amyâ€™s brief, Laura graduated \r\n  from college in the spring of 2004.Â  Therefore, we rule that the parties shall \r\n  make payment of the known expenses immediately.Â  Upon remand, the family court \r\n  is to determine with certitude the amount owed by each party in accordance with \r\n  this opinion, and that amount shall be due immediately.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nAmy contends the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We find the trial court failed to properly \r\n  consider the relevant factors and explain its reasoning in denying attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is at the \r\n  sound discretion of the family court.Â  See Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, the family court should consider: (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their \r\n  own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective \r\n  financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s \r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992); \r\n  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Our \r\n  supreme court has identified the following factors for determining a reasonable \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fee: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the \r\n  time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; \r\n  (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary \r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, \r\n  403 S.E.2d 313 (1991). \r\nThe courtâ€™s order simply stated:Â  â€œI further find \r\n  that both parties shall be responsible for their own attorney fees and costs \r\n  associated with this action.â€Â  This succinct and brief statement fails to provide \r\n  any evidence the trial court considered the appropriate factors in reaching \r\n  its decision. \r\nFurther, we conclude that South Carolina law controls \r\n  concerning the consideration of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, because this action \r\n  was instituted and initiated for the purpose of enforcing an Illinois court \r\n  order in the State of South Carolina.Â  All activities and proceeding in this \r\n  regard have occurred within the jurisdiction of South Carolina.Â  Regardless, \r\n  the factors to be considered in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees under Illinois law \r\n  are substantially the same as, if not identical to, the factors announced in \r\n  E.D.M. and Glasscock.Â  See In re Marriage of Landfield, \r\n  567 N.E.2d 1061 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (listing the factors considered in making \r\n  determination of attorneyâ€™s fees award as skill and standing of attorneys employed; \r\n  nature of controversy; novelty and difficulty of questions at issue; amount \r\n  and importance of subject matter, especially from family law standpoint; degree \r\n  of responsibility involved in management of case; time and labor required; usual \r\n  and customary charge in community; and benefits resulting to client); 750 Ill. \r\n  Comp. Stat. 5/508.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees is remanded \r\n  to the trial court for adequate and proper consideration of the appropriate \r\n  factors consistent with the results reached in this opinion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court correctly determined costs \r\n  associated with Lauraâ€™s ownership of a vehicle are not included in the amount \r\n  covered by the parties.Â  However, the court erred in its determination that \r\n  Laura must apply for loans to pay for her schooling prior to the rise of any \r\n  obligation to pay by Amy or Michael.Â  Further, we conclude the trial court erred \r\n  in deducting Lauraâ€™s income, either during school or during break, from the \r\n  amount owed by the parties.Â  We hold the parties shall divide the expenses of \r\n  Lauraâ€™s education 66% to Michael and 34% to Amy.Â  \r\nWe remand to the trial court for an order setting \r\n  forth the amount of college expenses, including any expenses related to Laura \r\n  incurring debt to pay for school, which are to be covered by the parties.Â  The \r\n  family court shall require immediate payment by the parties.Â  Finally, the court \r\n  shall reconsider the award of attorneyâ€™s fees in accordance with this opinion.Â  \r\n  This case is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the trial court \r\n  for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, \r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3921","title":"BPS v.

Cox and Walter M. \r\n  White, all of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  BPS, Inc. appeals from a \r\n  circuit court order granting summary judgment to William M. Worthy, II and from \r\n  an order denying its motion to alter or amend. Â We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBPS, Inc. (BPS) is a company \r\n  which processes insurance claims as a third party administrator for corporations.Â  \r\n  Carolina Benefit Administrators of SC, Inc. (Carolina Benefit) administers insurance \r\n  claims as a third party administrator for self-funded ERISA plans.Â  In the summer \r\n  of 2000, Robert J. Dickey, president of BPS, and William M. Worthy, II, president \r\n  of Carolina Benefit, entered into negotiations for the sale of BPSâ€™s assets \r\n  to Carolina Benefit.Â  Around September 22, 2000, Carolina Benefit and BPS executed \r\n  a letter of intent.Â  Attorneys for both companies then began drafting an Asset \r\n  Purchase Agreement.\r\nAlthough no written agreement \r\n  existed between the parties, Carolina Benefit provided an earnest money deposit \r\n  of $100,000 to BPS in November of 2000.Â  Thereafter, a transition team of BPS \r\n  employees began working out of Carolina Benefitâ€™s offices, though they remained \r\n  BPS employees.Â  Dickey declared that Carolina Benefit received â€œaccess to computer \r\n  and paper files containing information relating to the operations of BPS, Inc., \r\n  including pricing, renewals and other information concerning customers of BPS, \r\n  Inc.â€\r\nIn November of 2000, Carolina \r\n  Benefit learned that various accounts in BPSâ€™s portfolio were leaving BPS.Â  \r\n  On November 22, 2000, Dickey signed a version of the Asset Purchase Agreement, \r\n  making handwritten changes before signing it.Â  Worthy was on vacation at that \r\n  time.Â  Upon his return, Worthy was informed that BPSâ€™s largest account would \r\n  not be renewed for the coming year.Â  Worthy refused to sign the agreement.Â  \r\n  Dickey averred that at that time Carolina Benefit had already â€œtaken possession \r\n  of the BPS assets, employed its employees and begun servicing its clients.â€\r\nIn December of 2000, BPS filed \r\n  a lawsuit against Carolina Benefit and Worthy seeking injunctive relief and \r\n  damages.Â  The amended complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract, \r\n  breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act, promissory estoppel, quantum \r\n  meruit, violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, intentional interference \r\n  with a contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud in the inducement.Â  \r\n  Carolina Benefit and Worthy answered and filed a counterclaim against BPS and \r\n  a cross-claim against Dickey.\r\nBPS sought an injunction to prevent \r\n  Carolina Benefit\r\n\r\nfrom using the assets and name \r\n  of BPS, Inc., from employing persons now or formerly employed by BPS, Inc., \r\n  from contacting or otherwise doing business with any current or former client \r\n  or customer of BPS, Inc., from utilizing any proprietary information, trade \r\n  secret or other information obtained from BPS, Inc. in the course of its negotiations \r\n  and purchase of assets from BPS, Inc., from entering into any contracts of any \r\n  kind with clients, customers, employees or others now or formerly associated \r\n  with Plaintiff . . . .\r\n\r\nBPS filed various affidavits in \r\n  support of the request for the temporary restraining order along with the complaint.Â  \r\n  A temporary restraining order was issued.Â  Thereafter, a temporary injunction \r\n  was ordered.Â  The parties subsequently entered into a consent agreement in which \r\n  Carolina Benefit agreed not to use BPSâ€™s assets and name or to use proprietary \r\n  information or trade secrets obtained from BPS or its employees in the course \r\n  of its negotiations for the purchase of BPSâ€™s assets.Â  By order of the circuit \r\n  judge, the â€œPlaintiff shall maintain the disputed $100,000 earnest money deposit \r\n  in an interest-bearing escrow account until further order of this Court.â€\r\nWorthy moved to dismiss the action \r\n  against him individually.Â  He filed an affidavit in support of his motion, as \r\n  well as excerpts from the depositions of Worthy and Dickey.Â  The motion was \r\n  heard before Judge Gary E. Clary on August 14, 2002.Â  The trial court instructed \r\n  counsel for Worthy to prepare a proposed order granting the motion to have Worthy \r\n  dismissed as a defendant.Â  The proposed order, mailed on August 27, 2002, noted: \r\n  â€œWhere matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the \r\n  Court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed \r\n  of as provided in Rule 56.Â  See Rule 12(b), SCRCP.â€\r\nOn August 30, before Judge Clary \r\n  signed the order, BPSâ€™s attorney wrote to the court objecting to the conversion.Â  \r\n  Counsel for BPS argued that if the motion was to be treated as a motion for \r\n  summary judgment, the entire depositions should be placed into the record.Â  \r\n  A complete copy of Dickeyâ€™s deposition was attached to the letter.\r\nJudge Clary did not reply to \r\n  this letter, but directed that the letter from BPSâ€™s attorney and Dickeyâ€™s deposition \r\n  be â€œfiled in the Court file.â€Â  Counsel for Carolina Benefit and Worthy did not \r\n  object.Â  Nonetheless, Judge Clary signed the order as proposed on September \r\n  6, 2002.Â  The order referenced the depositions of both Worthy and Dickey in \r\n  setting forth the facts, but stated: â€œ[BPS] failed to submit any affidavits \r\n  so the facts before the Court are those as set forth by the Affidavits and Deposition \r\n  excerpts provided by Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff Worthy.â€Â  The order granted \r\n  Worthyâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to individual liability.\r\nBPS filed a motion to alter or \r\n  amend.Â  In the interim, Judge Clary left the bench.Â  The motion to alter or \r\n  amend was heard before Judge Larry Patterson.Â  Judge Patterson denied the motion.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a \r\n  summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which \r\n  governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper \r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement \r\n  Co., 360 S.C. 366, 601 S.E.2d 342 (2004); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. \r\n  Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004); Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship \r\n  v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 \r\n  S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 \r\n  S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to \r\n  the jury.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d \r\n  830 (Ct. App. 2002); Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 \r\n  S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Belton v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 360 S.C. 575, 602 \r\n  S.E.2d 389 (2004); McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. \r\n  372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004); Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Higgins \r\n  v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 592, 486 S.E.2d 269 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (noting that when ruling on motion for summary judgment, trial judge must \r\n  consider all of the documents and evidence within the record, including pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits).Â  \r\n  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must \r\n  be construed most strongly against the moving party.Â  Schmidt v. Courtney, \r\n  357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003); Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001); see also \r\n  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 \r\n  S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002) (â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the \r\n  appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising \r\n  in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the \r\n  application of the law.Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 688 (2000); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 \r\n  S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Summary judgment should not be granted even when \r\n  there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is disagreement concerning \r\n  the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary \r\n  Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000); Ellis v. Davidson, \r\n  358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, palpable, \r\n  and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary \r\n  judgment should be granted.Â  Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 340, 559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001); Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. \r\n  426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment \r\n  is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact \r\n  finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); Rumpf \r\n  v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. \r\n  2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously \r\n  invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed \r\n  factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 \r\n  S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins, 358 S.C. at 289, 594 S.E.2d \r\n  at 561-62; Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 S.E.2d 743 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBPS argues that: (1) Judge Clary \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment to Worthy; (2) summary judgment should not \r\n  have been granted until discovery was complete; and (3) Judge Patterson erred \r\n  â€œin his determination that he had no authority to alter and amend the summary \r\n  judgment order of Judge Clary.â€\r\nI.Â  SUMMARY JUDGMENT\r\nA.Â  Basis and Reasons \r\n  for the Summary Judgment\r\nOrder in Case Sub \r\n  Judice\r\nThe dispositive issue is whether \r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Worthy.Â  BPS contends \r\n  Judge Claryâ€™s order erroneously found that BPS had failed to submit any affidavits \r\n  in opposition to Worthyâ€™s motion to dismiss, and thus based its findings solely \r\n  on Worthyâ€™s affidavits.Â  We agree.\r\nHere, the affidavits in support of the temporary injunction \r\n  were filed with the complaint.Â  It is undisputed that the affidavits were in \r\n  the record at the time the motion was heard.Â  Furthermore, Judge Clary inserted \r\n  Dickeyâ€™s full deposition into the record before he signed the order.Â  Worthy \r\n  did not object to this action.Â  Judge Clary had the excerpts from the deposition \r\n  testimony in the submissions from Worthy.Â  Thus, the circuit court erred in \r\n  refusing to consider all of the evidence in the record, and in failing to view \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\r\nClearly, many issues in the case remained in dispute.Â  \r\n  BPS brought nine causes of action in addition to the request for an injunction.Â  \r\n  Worthy should not have been dismissed from the action unless it was clear that \r\n  BPS could not establish prima facie liability on any of them.\r\nWorthy claims that as an officer of Carolina Benefit, \r\n  he is immune from liability.Â  He cites Hunt v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 475, 272 \r\n  S.E.2d 643 (1980), for this proposition.Â  In Hunt, the Supreme Court \r\n  articulated:\r\n\r\nGenerally the reason for the creation of a corporation \r\n  is to limit liability.Â  While there are instances in which directors and/or \r\n  trustees and officers may be personally liable, an officer or a director of \r\n  a corporation is not, merely as a result of his standing as such, personally \r\n  liable for torts of corporate employees.Â  To incur liability he must ordinarily \r\n  be shown to have in some way participated in or directed the tortious act. . \r\n  . . .\r\n\r\nWe find the following relevant rule in 19 Am. Jur. \r\n  2d Corporations, 4, Liability for Torts:\r\n\r\nÂ§ 1382.Â  Generally.\r\nA director or officer of a corporation does not incur personal liability for \r\n  its torts merely by reason of his official character; he is not liable for torts \r\n  committed by or for the corporation unless he has participated in the wrong.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, directors not parties to a wrongful act on the part of other directors \r\n  are not liable therefor.Â  If, however, a director or officer commits or participates \r\n  in the commission of a tort, whether or not it is also by or for the corporation, \r\n  he is liable to third persons injured thereby, and it does not matter what liability \r\n  attaches to the corporation for the tort . . . .\r\nÂ§ 1383.Â  Liability for acts of subordinate officers, agents, or employees.Â  \r\n\r\nOrdinarily, a director is not liable for the tortious acts of officers, agents, \r\n  or employees of the corporation, unless he participated therein or authorized \r\n  the wrongful act.Â  It is held that directors cannot be held liable for the acts \r\n  of subordinateÂ  officers which they neither participated in nor sanctioned, \r\n  and where they could not, in the exercise of ordinary and reasonable supervision, \r\n  have detected the wrongdoing of such subordinate officers . . . .\r\n\r\nIn 19 C.J.S. Corporations Â§ 845-Torts, the \r\n  rule is stated in this way:\r\n\r\nâ€œA director, officer, or agent is not liable for torts of the corporation or \r\n  of other officers or agents merely because of his office.Â  He is liable for \r\n  torts in which he has participated or which he has authorized or directed.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 477-78, 272 S.E.2d at 644.\r\nNothing in the law shields Worthy from direct liability \r\n  in tort for his own actions.Â  See Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, \r\n  369, 468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996) (â€œAn officer, director, or controlling person \r\n  in a corporation is not, merely as a result of his or her status as such, personally \r\n  liable for the torts of the corporation. To incur liability, the officer, director, \r\n  or controlling person must ordinarily be shown to have in some way participated \r\n  in or directed the tortious act.â€).Â  Worthy is personally liable for any tortious \r\n  acts he participated in or directed.\r\nAdditionally, Worthy is liable for unfair trade practices \r\n  that he personally committed.Â  â€œ[I]n private actions under the UTPA, directors \r\n  and officers are not liable for the corporationâ€™s unfair trade practices unless \r\n  they personally commit, participate in, direct, or authorize the commission \r\n  of a violation of the UTPA.â€Â  Plowman v. Bagnal, 316 S.C. 283, 286, 450 \r\n  S.E.2d 36, 38 (1994) (emphasis added); see also Donsco, Inc. v. Casper \r\n  Corp., 587 F.2d 602 (3rd. Cir. 1978) (finding that corporate officer is \r\n  individually liable for unfair competition in which he participates); Moy \r\n  v. Schreiber Deed Sec. Co., 535 A.2d 1168 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) (stating \r\n  that corporate president could be held individually liable under the participation \r\n  theory for acts of unfair competition which he personally committed); Great \r\n  Am. Homebuilders, Inc. v. Gerhart, 708 S.W.2d 8 (Tex. App. 1986) (determining \r\n  that corporate officer who knowingly participates in deceptive trade practice \r\n  may be held individually liable).\r\nSimilarly, the corporate veil does not protect Worthy \r\n  from liability for his own actions.Â  Section 33-6-220(b) (1999) of the South \r\n  Carolina Code states: â€œUnless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, \r\n  a shareholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts or debts \r\n  of the corporation except that he may become personally liable by reason \r\n  of his own acts or conduct.â€ (Emphasis added).\r\nWorthy asserts that even if the claims apply to him, \r\n  BPS failed to establish liability based on the evidence presented.Â  Viewing \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to BPS, we conclude there is sufficient \r\n  evidence in the record to survive summary judgment.Â  First, two of the affidavits \r\n  of BPS employees alleged that â€œMr. Worthy got what he wanted without having \r\n  to pay.â€Â  Second, there was evidence that Worthy and Carolina Benefit took possession \r\n  of BPS assets, employed its employees, and began servicing its clients while \r\n  intending not to execute the agreement.Â  Third, some files and a computer were \r\n  taken after Dickey had been assured the parties had reached an agreement.Â  The \r\n  verbiage and language of the order of the circuit judge reveals indubitably \r\n  that the court did not consider any of this evidence or give efficacy to the \r\n  complete depositions of Worthy and Dickey.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to Worthy.\r\nB.Â  Discovery\r\nBPS maintains the granting of summary judgment was \r\n  improper because discovery was incomplete.Â  Summary judgment must not be granted \r\n  until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.Â  \r\n  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 548 S.E.2d 854 (2001); Baughman v. American \r\n  Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., Â  306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991); see also \r\n  Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 319, 592 S.E.2d 326, 331 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (â€œBecause summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it must not be granted \r\n  until the opposing party has had a â€˜full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€™â€).\r\nThere may exist a possible query as to whether \r\n  this issue was raised to the circuit court either during the hearing or during \r\n  the Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion.Â  That conundrum is answered directly and completely \r\n  in the actions and positions taken and argued before the circuit court issued \r\n  the order granting summary judgment.Â  Specifically, BPS was faced with a motion \r\n  to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, dated July 26, 2002.Â  On August \r\n  30, 2002, BPS objected to the conversion of the 12(b)(6) motion to a motion \r\n  for summary judgment.Â  Despite the objection posed by BPS, the circuit judge \r\n  treated the original 12(b)(6) motion as a motion for summary judgment under \r\n  Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Without utilizing completion of discovery as a ground for opposition \r\n  to the conversion activity of the circuit judge, BPS voiced a position in contra \r\n  to the ruling of the circuit judge that encapsulates the need for further discovery \r\n  activities.Â  BPS submitted Dickeyâ€™s complete deposition as an active response \r\n  to the conversion of the original 12(b)(6) motion.\r\nThe Rule 59(e) motion filed by BPS professed:\r\n\r\n1.Â  On Page 3 of Judge Claryâ€™s Order he states that \r\n  â€œthe motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as \r\n  provided in Rule 56.Â  See Rule 12(b), SCRCP.â€Â  However, no notice that the motion \r\n  would be converted from a Motion to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment \r\n  was given.\r\n2.Â  â€œ. . . Summary judgment is not appropriate where \r\n  further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application \r\n  of the law.â€\r\n&nbsp;. . . .\r\n6.Â  Mr. John Hawkins, co-counsel for the Plaintiff \r\n  and Third-Party Defendant, wrote to Judge Clary on August 30, 2002, asking that \r\n  if indeed the Court intended to convert this matter to a Motion for Summary \r\n  Judgment, the Plaintiff and Third-Party Defendant should be allowed a â€œreasonable \r\n  opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule \r\n  56.â€Â  Rule 12(b), SCRCP.Â  As stated in the accompanying affidavit of \r\n  Mr. Hawkins, a review of the Court file shows that Judge Clary granted his request \r\n  that the deposition of Mr. Dickey be placed in the record.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nLuculently, this issue is encompassed within \r\n  the virginal, continuing, and briefed factual and legal occurrences depicted \r\n  in the record on appeal in its entirety.\r\nThe circuit judge committed reversible error \r\n  in proceeding to consider and convert the initial Rule 12(b)(6) motion to a \r\n  motion for summary judgment without giving BPS adequate and reasonable opportunity \r\n  and time to present all materials pertinent to a Rule 56 motion.\r\nII.Â  MOTION \r\n  TO ALTER OR AMEND\r\nBPS avers that Judge Patterson erred in refusing to \r\n  reach the merits in denying BPSâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  Because we find \r\n  that summary judgment was improper, we do not reach this issue.Â  Regardless \r\n  of how the circuit court ruled on the motion to alter or amend, the fact that \r\n  the issues were raised and a ruling obtained was sufficient to preserve them \r\n  for appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the circuit courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  summary judgment to Worthy and REMAND this case for trial.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3922","title":"Donahue v.

(the former name of the \r\n  Defendant MEI).Â  This contract cancelled and superseded a 1978 contract between \r\n  the parties.\r\nUnder the terms of the 1982 contract, [Donahue] \r\n  agreed to serve as â€œMaster of Ceremonies on the television program presently \r\n  entitled â€˜Donahueâ€™ (the â€˜Programâ€™).â€Â  The parties further agreed in Section \r\n  10(q) of the contract that the laws of the State of New York govern its terms.Â  \r\n  The contract was subsequently amended four times.Â  The amendments primarily \r\n  adjusted the amount of remuneration due to [Donahue] and extended the contractâ€™s \r\n  â€œterm.â€Â  Each iteration of the contract was for a definite term.Â  The last amendment \r\n  was entered into on October 12, 1994.Â  Pursuant to that final amendment, the \r\n  contractâ€™s term expired on August 31, 1996:\r\n  \r\n Extended Term: The term of the Contract shall \r\n  be extended so that, as extended, it shall expire at midnight on August 31, \r\n  1996.Â  (1994 amendment to Contract, Section 2)\r\n  \r\nThe final amendment also provided that discussions between \r\n  the parties regarding the continuation of any programming beyond the expiration \r\n  date were to be commenced on or before May 31, 1995.\r\n. . . .\r\nSometime before May 31, 1995, [Donahue] decided \r\n  not to renew his contract with MEI beyond its August 31, 1996 expiration date.\r\nIn July 1995 . . . Gannet Co., Inc. (â€œGannettâ€) \r\n  submitted, and the Board of Directors of Multimedia approved, a proposal for \r\n  Gannettâ€™s purchase of the stock of Multimedia.Â  Multimedia shareholders approved \r\n  the proposal at a special meeting on November 15, 1995.Â  Pursuant to that transaction, \r\n  [Donahue] received a substantial payment for his Multimedia shares.\r\nFollowing Gannettâ€™s acquisition of Multimedia stock, \r\n  MEI continued to produce the â€œDonahueâ€ program, and [Donahue] continued to perform \r\n  his duties as its master of ceremonies.Â  The last program was taped on April \r\n  29, 1996.Â  The â€œextended termâ€ of the contract expired on August 31, 1996 pursuant \r\n  to its explicit terms.\r\nAlmost three months later, on November 21, 1996 \r\n  . . . Universal Television Enterprises, Inc. (â€œUniversalâ€) purchased the assets \r\n  of MEI.Â  Those assets included a group of videotapes of the â€œDonahueâ€ program, \r\n  characterized as the â€œDonahue Library.â€\r\n(Trial Court Order dated August 15, 2002).\r\n\r\nSection 6 of the contract, entitled â€œSale \r\n  and Assignment,â€ contains the following language:\r\n\r\nDonahue agrees that Multimedia shall have the right \r\n  to sell and assign this contract at any time during the term hereof . . . .\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Multimedia agrees \r\n  that it will not so enter into a binding commitment during the term hereof . \r\n  . . for any assignment of rights and interests of Multimedia in the Program \r\n  and in the distribution in syndication thereof which includes an assignment \r\n  of this Contract without first consulting with Donahue and specifying and giving \r\n  Donahue the option to meet the price and other related terms and conditions \r\n  contained in the offer . . . .\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Donahue brought a breach of contract \r\n  action against Respondents, arguing the Gannett and Universal transactions each \r\n  constitute a violation of the contractâ€™s assignment clause and Donahueâ€™s right \r\n  of first refusal.Â  Donahue petitioned the court to have the transactions voided \r\n  and sought exclusive ownership rights in the Donahue library.Â  After reviewing \r\n  voluminous materials submitted in support of both partiesâ€™ positions, the trial \r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents.Â  Following a Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion by Donahue to alter or amend the trial courtâ€™s initial order, the decision \r\n  to grant summary judgment was reiterated in a lengthy second order.Â  This appeal \r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE \r\n  LAW\r\nThe contract provides that its terms shall \r\n  be subject to and construed in accordance with New York law. Because New York \r\n  contract law does not violate South Carolina public policy, we find its application \r\n  appropriate.Â  See Standard Register Co. v. Kerrigan, 238 S.C. \r\n  54, 70, 119 S.E.2d 533, 541-542 (1961) (finding the laws of other jurisdictions, \r\n  when deemed applicable by agreement, are generally enforceable in South Carolina \r\n  unless repugnant to the public policy of this state).\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to \r\n  expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact \r\n  finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003); \r\n  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  Summary \r\n  judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \r\n  and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Laurens \r\n  Emergency Med. Specialists, PA v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. \r\n  104, 108, 584 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issue \r\n  of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be \r\n  viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Sauner v. Public \r\n  Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003); \r\n  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 455-56, 578 S.E.2d 711, 714 \r\n  (2003).Â Â  \r\nNew York law is consistent with South \r\n  Carolina law with respect to summary judgment evidentiary standards.Â  See \r\n  Dougherty v. Kinard, 626 N.Y.S.2d 554, 555 (N.Y. App. Div. 1995) (â€œWhere \r\n  there are no material and triable issues of fact, [a] motion for summary judgment \r\n  should be granted.â€).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. The Gannett Transaction\r\nDonahue argues that Gannettâ€™s 1.7 billion \r\n  dollar purchase of Multimediaâ€™s stock violated his contract with MEI because \r\n  the transaction constitutes an unauthorized â€œassignmentâ€ of the contract.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nIn regard to this issue, we adopt the \r\n  following sound analysis of the trial court:\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the 1995 stock purchase \r\n  transaction was between Gannett and Multimedia, the parent corporation of MEI.Â  \r\n  MEI was not a party to the transaction.Â  After Gannett purchased Multimediaâ€™s \r\n  stock, MEI continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of Multimedia, and MEIâ€™s contract \r\n  with [Donahue] continued as it had before the transaction.Â  [Donahue] acknowledges \r\n  that there were no changes in the daily operation of his program, in the persons \r\n  to whom he reported, in the production of the program, or in his contract with\r\nMEI.\r\nAn assignment consists of three elements: (1) an \r\n  assignor, (2) an assignee, and (3) transfer of control of the thing assigned \r\n  from the assignor to the assignee.Â  Leon v. Martinez, 84 N.Y.2d 83, 88 \r\n  (N.Y. 1994); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 317 \r\n  (1981) (â€œAn assignment of a right is a manifestation of the assignorâ€™s intention \r\n  to transfer it by virtue of which the assignorâ€™s right to performance by the \r\n  obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right \r\n  to such performance.â€).\r\nThe transfer of the stock of a corporation, however, \r\n  does not constitute an assignment of a contract of that corporation.Â  See \r\n  Dennisâ€™ Natural Mini-meals, Inc. v. 91 Fifth Ave. Corp., 568 N.Y.S.2d \r\n  740, 743 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991); Rubenstein Bros. v. Ole of 34th [St., Inc.], \r\n  421 N.Y.S.2d 534, 538 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1979); In re Pearl-Wick Corp., 15 \r\n  B.R. 143, 147 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1981), affâ€™d without opinion, 697 F.2d \r\n  295 (2d Cir. 1982).Â  Here, Gannett did not purchase the stock of MEI, the party \r\n  to the contract.Â  Rather, Gannett bought the stock of Multimedia, the corporate \r\n  parent of the contracting entity.Â  Since the transfer of the stock of a corporation \r\n  does not constitute an assignment of the corporationâ€™s contract, the transfer \r\n  of the stock of the parent of a contracting corporation can hardly constitute \r\n  an assignment of its subsidiaryâ€™s contract.\r\n(Trial Court Order dated August 15, 2002).\r\n\r\nWe find nothing in the language of Donahueâ€™s \r\n  contract or the particularities of this transaction that would warrant, as Donahue \r\n  argues on appeal, an interpretation of â€œassignmentâ€ which, in contravention \r\n  to New York common law, would bar the sale of Mutimediaâ€™s stock to Gannett.Â  \r\n  As such, Gannettâ€™s purchase of Multimediaâ€™s stock did not breach any terms or \r\n  conditions of the 1982 contract between MEI and Donahue.\r\nII. The Universal Transaction\r\n\r\nA. The Assignment Clause\r\n\r\nPursuant to Section 2 of Donahueâ€™s \r\n  contract, as amended in 1994, the agreementâ€™s general term expired on August \r\n  31, 1996.Â  In November 1996, MEI sold its assets, including the Donahue library, \r\n  to Universal.Â  Donahue argues this transaction violated the contract because \r\n  his right of first refusal under Section 6 survived the contractâ€™s termination \r\n  date and was not honored.Â  We disagree, and again adopt the trial courtâ€™s analysis:\r\n\r\nSection 6 of the contract governs the sale or assignment \r\n  â€œduring the term hereofâ€ of the â€œrights and interests of Multimedia [the designation \r\n  of MEI in this contract] in the Program and in the distribution in syndication \r\n  thereof which includes an assignment of this Contract.â€Â  As discussed [in the \r\n  fact section of this opinion], this section afforded [Donahue] the â€œoption to \r\n  meet the price and other related terms and conditions contained in the offer \r\n  of purchase of the Program and this Contract.â€Â  Notwithstanding that Section \r\n  6 specifically applies only â€œduring the termâ€ of the contract, [Donahue] argues \r\n  that since certain other provisions of the contract provided for â€œperpetualâ€ \r\n  rights, Section 6 should also be construed to bind MEI in perpetuity.Â  An examination \r\n  of the contract as a whole shows that such an interpretation is not tenable.\r\n. . . .\r\nWhile Sections 2(c) and 2(d) provide for royalty \r\n  payments for any reruns of the â€œDonahueâ€ program, those limited provisions do \r\n  not extend other terms of the contract.Â  [Donahue] had no continuing obligation \r\n  to perform as master of ceremonies for MEI, and MEI had no continuing obligation \r\n  to produce and distribute the â€œDonahueâ€ program without him.\r\nThe language of the Contract is unambiguous: it \r\n  provided that the â€œtermâ€ of the Contract ended on a date certain, and that Plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  â€œright of first refusalâ€ lasted only during the term of the Contract:\r\n  \r\nThe term of the Contract shall be extended so that, as extended, \r\n  it shall expire at midnight, August 31, 1996. (Contract, October 1994 amendment, \r\n  Â¶ 2).\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, [MEI] agrees that it will not \r\n  so enter into a binding commitment during the term hereof . . . without \r\n  first consulting with Donahue . . . (Contract Â§ 6, emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nSection 6 of the contract and the Plaintiffâ€™s rights thereunder \r\n  expired when the contractâ€™s â€œextended termâ€ expired on August 31, 1996.Â  After \r\n  that date, MEI was free to sell and assign its rights in the Donahue Library \r\n  as it saw fit.\r\n(Trial Court Order dated August 15, 2002).\r\n\r\nIt is this courtâ€™s duty to enforce the \r\n  plain language of Donahueâ€™s contract.Â  Wallace v. 600 Partners Co., 634 \r\n  N.Y.S.2d 669, 671 (N.Y. 1995) (â€œIt is axiomatic that a contract is to be interpreted \r\n  so as to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the unequivocal \r\n  language employed . . . clear, complete writings should generally be enforced \r\n  according to their terms.â€).Â  Donahueâ€™s right of refusal, as outlined in Section \r\n  6, is expressly limited to â€œthe termâ€ of the contract, which expired in August \r\n  1996.Â  The fact that the parties expressly agreed certain provisions of the \r\n  contract would last â€œin perpetuityâ€ creates no ambiguity in terms expressly \r\n  limited to the contractâ€™s general term.Â  We therefore agree with the trial court \r\n  that, as a matter of law, the transfer of MEI assets to Universal was in no \r\n  way precluded by Donahueâ€™s right of first refusal as agreed upon in Section \r\n  6 of the contract.\r\n\r\nB. Contract for Personal Services\r\n\r\nDonahue also argues the trial court erred \r\n  in determining the contract, at the time of the Universal transaction, lacked \r\n  the indicia of a personal services contract.Â  It is his contention that because \r\n  MEIâ€™s right of assignment was, like Donahueâ€™s right of first refusal, limited \r\n  to the contract term, New York common law applies by default to all transactions \r\n  occurring after the contractual termination date.Â  He asserts that because the \r\n  contract should be interpreted as one for personal services, New York law bars \r\n  its assignment; thus, the Universal transaction is void.Â  We disagree.\r\nNew York law, like that of many jurisdictions, \r\n  employs an exception to the general rule of assignability of contracts when \r\n  the contract is for â€œpersonal services.â€Â  Jennings v. Foremost Dairies, Inc., \r\n  235 N.Y.S.2d 566, 573 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1962); In re Compass Van &amp; Storage \r\n  Corp., 65 B.R. 1007, 1010 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1986) (â€œThe nonassignability \r\n  imprint of personal service contracts is firmly established New York law.â€). \r\n  Even a personal services contract, however, may be assigned if the contract \r\n  provides for assignment.Â  Preferred Oncology Networks of America, Inc. v. \r\n  Bottino, 1997 WL 305253, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (â€œDefendants represent to \r\n  this Court that New York law does not recognize assignment of an obligation \r\n  to provide personal services, yet neglect to inform the court that this prohibition \r\n  is inapplicable when the parties expressly provide for assignability.â€).Â  \r\nHere, it is clear the parties contemplated \r\n  possible assignment when entering into the agreement. During its entire fourteen-year \r\n  term, Donahueâ€™s contract expressly granted MEI the right to assign, subject \r\n  only to Donahueâ€™s option to meet any offered purchase price.Â  These minimal \r\n  restrictions on assignment lend little weight to the notion that the parties \r\n  intended MEIâ€™s obligations to be of a â€œpersonalâ€ unassignable nature once the \r\n  contract expired.Â  See In re Compass Van &amp; Storage Corp., \r\n  65 B.R. at 1011 (â€œPersonal service contracts synthesize into those consensual \r\n  agreements of ineluctable genre and distinctive characteristics that commit \r\n  to a special knowledge, unique skill or talent, singular judgment and taste.â€)Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nDonahue presents to this court the proposition \r\n  that exclusive distribution contracts are per se personal service contracts \r\n  under the law of New York.Â  In support of this position, he cites American \r\n  Can Co. v. AB Dick Co., 1983 WL 2198 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), a case dealing with \r\n  an exclusive distribution contract that expressly barred assignment and \r\n  never mentions the term â€œpersonal service contract.â€Â  Without addressing this \r\n  personal service contract â€œper seâ€ argument, we conclude, as did the \r\n  trial court, that Donahueâ€™s contract, following the expiration of its term, \r\n  lacked the qualities of an exclusive distribution contract.\r\nSection 10(f) of Donahueâ€™s contract grants \r\n  MEI a perpetual, vested, and exclusive right in all â€œmaterialâ€ arising from \r\n  the contractâ€™s performance.Â  As such, MEI owned all right, title and interest \r\n  in the Donahue library prior to the Universal transaction, provided they pay \r\n  Donahue his percentage of any proceeds from its sale.Â  According to Section \r\n  3 of the contract, MEI alone had the sole and exclusive right to distribute \r\n  reruns of the program.Â  As stated by the trial court:\r\n\r\nThe Contract is not one . . . whereby MEI or Universal serve \r\n  as distribution agents for [Donahue].Â  Unlike agency distribution arrangements, \r\n  where party B acts as a distributor of goods belonging to party A, in this case \r\n  one party â€“ MEI â€“ distributes its own goods, and has full discretion \r\n  to distribute the tapes or not, as it alone sees fit.Â  MEIâ€™s only duty, and \r\n  [Donahueâ€™s] only corresponding right, is to the transfer of a percentage of \r\n  any proceeds realized from MEIâ€™s marketing efforts.Â  That is all [Donahue] bargained \r\n  for, and it is all the Contract gives to him.Â  For this conceptual reason, in \r\n  addition to the clear terms of the Contract, the agency cases relied upon by \r\n  [Donahue] are simply irrelevant.\r\n(Trial Court Order dated September 30, 2002).\r\n\r\nDonahue downplays this proprietary distinction \r\n  and calls our attention to two New York cases he asserts reflect that ownership \r\n  of the product does not control the existence of an agency distribution contract.Â  \r\n  On the contrary, we find these cases take careful steps to establish the distributor \r\n  did not have a true property interest in the subject matter of the contracts.Â  \r\n  See Andrian v. Unterman, 118 N.Y.S.2d 121, 127-28 (N.Y. App. div. \r\n  1952), affâ€™d, 306 N.Y. 771 (N.Y. 1954) (holding a trademark, the subject \r\n  of the distribution contract at issue, is â€œnot the subject of property except \r\n  in connection with an existing businessâ€ and â€œno property existedâ€ in the use \r\n  of oneâ€™s name for the marketing of a product);Â  Bentley v. Textile Banking \r\n  Co., Inc., 271 N.Y.S.2d 417, 419 (N.Y. App. Div. 1966) (â€œ[D]espite the words \r\n  used describing the transactions as sales, no transfer of title [to the subject \r\n  of the contract] was intended or took place.â€).Â  Because Donahueâ€™s contract \r\n  granted MEI ownership of the tape library and all material arising from the \r\n  contract, the contract ceased to operate as an exclusive distributorship upon \r\n  the expiration of the contractâ€™s general term.Â  We therefore find his arguments \r\n  regarding its status as a contract for personal services to be without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we conclude the Gannett \r\n  and Universal transactions did not violate New York law or breach any terms \r\n  or conditions of the 1982 contract between MEI and Donahue, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3923","title":"Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony, Inc. v.

Weissenstein, Jr., and James David Weeks, both of Sumter, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.: In this appeal, we are asked to determine whether an \r\n  owner of subaqueous land is entitled to exclusive use of a non-navigable body \r\n  of water created by the ownerâ€™s predecessor in title as against other, abutting \r\n  property owners.Â  Addressing this and other questions below, the special referee \r\n  enjoined abutting landowners from making any use of the privately owned body \r\n  of water.Â  We affirm this ruling to the extent Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony, Inc. (the \r\n  â€œColonyâ€) owns the subaqueous land, but vacate that portion of the judgment \r\n  related to damages and remand the matter for determination of the precise property \r\n  boundaries and, concomitantly, reconsideration of the damage awards.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties are \r\n  neighboring property owners whose land surrounds a pond.Â  The core issue in \r\n  this case is the question of who among these landowners has the right to access \r\n  and use the pond.Â  On one side of the pond is the Colony, which claims its members \r\n  have the right to exclusive use of the pond.Â  On the other side of the pond \r\n  are several individual property owners whose land abuts the pond (the â€œabutting \r\n  landownersâ€).Â  They claim they too have a right to access and use the pond.Â  \r\n  Briefly outlined below are the relevant facts concerning the pond, how the parties \r\n  came into ownership of the land surrounding the pond and the pond bed, and the \r\n  order of the special referee from which the present appeal arises.\r\nThe Pond\r\nAt the center of this dispute is an eighty-eight acre body of water in Sumter \r\n  County known as â€œWhiteâ€™s Mill Pond.â€Â  The pond is man madeâ€”created sometime \r\n  in the late nineteenth century when a dam was constructed at the point where \r\n  two streams converged, forming a third, larger stream. Neither the pond nor \r\n  any of the incoming or outgoing streams are listed on maps of navigable waters \r\n  prepared by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.Â  \r\n  Â Testimony was presented from various witnesses describing the pond and \r\n  the character of the surrounding area.Â  From this evidence, it appears the pond \r\n  is an essentially isolated body of water. \r\nTitle to the Pond and the Present Dispute\r\nPrior to 1950, title to the pond, including the pond bed, had been vested in \r\n  the predecessors in title to the parties in this case.Â  In 1955, the Colony \r\n  obtained title to the land located to the north and east of the pond.Â  The Colony \r\n  also obtained title to the entirety of, or at least a substantial portion of, \r\n  the bed of the pond itself. Â Land along the south and west sides of the \r\n  pond subsequently came into the possession of the defendants in this case: Arthur \r\n  Williams, Leonard Boseman, Jr., Jerry Rouse, Leodel Mitchell, Jimmie Johnson, \r\n  Leon Kelly, Lillian Davis, and Richard Weeks.Â  Â None of the deeds to \r\n  these landowners granted any right of access to the pond. However, there is \r\n  testimony suggesting some of the abutting landowners also have title to parts \r\n  of the pond bed.Â  \r\nThe Colony filed suit against the abutting landowners alleging some of them \r\n  used Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond in a variety of ways, including fishing, boating, dredging \r\n  soil, removing trees from along the side of the pond, and building docks into \r\n  the pond.Â  The abutting landowners counterclaimed, alleging their use and enjoyment \r\n  of their property had been disturbed by the Colony.Â  The matter was referred \r\n  to a special referee for a determination of the partiesâ€™ respective rights.\r\nThe Special Refereeâ€™s Order\r\nIn his order, the special referee determined the case turned on two key issues: \r\n  first, whether Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond is a navigable watercourse under South Carolina \r\n  law giving rise to a public right of access to the pond; and, second, \r\n  whether the abutting landowners held any private right to access and \r\n  use the pond arising from their putative status as riparian or littoral owners.Â  \r\n  The special referee found neither right existed. [1] Â  The abutting landowners were therefore enjoined \r\n  from boating or fishing on Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond, dredging or interfering with the \r\n  pondâ€™s bed, cutting any timber from the bed of the pond, or building any structures \r\n  on the bed of the pond, unless the structures were over property owned by the \r\n  abutting landowners.Â  Additionally, the special referee awarded damages against \r\n  the various landowners in amounts ranging from $500 to $5,500.Â  \r\nIt is important \r\n  to note, however, that the referee did not make a determination as to the property \r\n  lines.Â  Despite contradictory evidence regarding the precise location of the \r\n  line between the pond bed and the abutting landownersâ€™ property, the referee \r\n  found that such determination was not necessary to address the questions presented. \r\n\r\nThe abutting landowners \r\n  now appeal the special refereeâ€™s findings that the pond is not a publicly accessible \r\n  navigable waterway and that they have no right to access the pond as riparian \r\n  or littoral owners. Â The Colony and several of the abutting property owners \r\n  also appeal the special refereeâ€™s award of damages.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains \r\n  its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard \r\n  of review on appeal.â€ Key Corporate Capital, Inc. v.

App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn the discussion \r\n  below, we address separately the three issues that determine this appeal: (I) \r\n  whether Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond is a navigable watercourse under South Carolina law; \r\n  (II) whether the abutting landowners possess any riparian or littoral rights \r\n  to access and use the pond; and (III) whether the special refereeâ€™s award of \r\n  damages was proper.\r\nI.Â  Navigable Waters\r\nThe right of \r\n  public access to navigable waters is guaranteed by our state constitution: â€œAll \r\n  navigable waters shall forever remain public highways free to the citizens of \r\n  the State. . . .â€Â  S.C. Const. art. XIV, Â§ 4. South Carolina Code section 49-1-10 \r\n  (1986) similarly provides that â€œ[a]ll streams which have been rendered or can \r\n  be rendered capable of being navigated by rafts of lumber or timber by the removal \r\n  of accidental obstructions and all navigable watercourses and cuts are hereby \r\n  declared navigable streams and such streams shall be common highways and forever \r\n  free. . . .â€Â  In upholding this constitutional and statutory mandate, our courts \r\n  look to whether the waterway in question has the capacity to support â€œvaluable \r\n  floatage.â€Â  If the waterway can support such use, it is deemed navigable and \r\n  thus open to the public.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œValuable floatageâ€ \r\n  is not determined by resort to generic guidelines as to what specific size or \r\n  class of vessel or object can achieve buoyancy in the waterway.Â  Rather, the \r\n  term is defined broadly to include any â€œlegitimate and beneficial public use.â€ \r\n  Medlock v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 289 S.C. 445, 450, 346 S.E.2d \r\n  716, 719 (1986).Â  Such public use includes all varieties of commercial traffic, \r\n  ranging from passage of the largest freighter to the floating of raw timber \r\n  downstream to mill. See id. at 449, 346 S.E.2d at 719.Â  Recreational \r\n  uses are no less importantâ€”boating, hunting, and fishing have been found to \r\n  fall within the ambit of valuable floatage.Â  See Hughes v. Nelson, \r\n  303 S.C. 102, 105, 399 S.E.2d 24, 25 (Ct. App. 1990). Â In this vein, considerations \r\n  such as whether the waterway is natural or man-made or whether it is impassable \r\n  by any vessel at certain times of year have been found to have no bearing on \r\n  the question of navigability. See State v. Head, 330 S.C. 79, \r\n  90-91, 498 S.E.2d 389, 394-95 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The focus remains strictly on \r\n  capacity, irrespective of actual use.\r\nOf course, not every body of water is â€œnavigable.â€Â  The concept of \r\n  navigability encompasses more than the capacity to support valuable floatage \r\n  in a single, secluded spot.Â  Rather, to be properly categorized as navigable, \r\n  the watercourse in question must also be connected to other navigable bodies \r\n  of water such that it forms a means of transportation or conveyance beyond an \r\n  isolated locality.Â  This requirement of a navigable connection to a broader \r\n  system of waterways has been at the heart of the navigability concept since \r\n  its earliest application in this jurisdiction and others.Â  \r\nBeginning with the early cases addressing the public right to navigable waters \r\n  in our stateâ€™s jurisprudence, the express policy underlying that right was to \r\n  protect, above all, the free flow of commerce. See, e.g., State \r\n  v. Columbia Water Power Co., 82 S.C. 181, 186, 63 S.E. 884, 887 (1909) (noting \r\n  that â€œwater is navigable when in its ordinary state it forms by itself or its \r\n  connection with other waters a continued highway over which commerce is or may \r\n  be carriedâ€).Â Â  Rivers and streams were essential means for conveying goods \r\n  and raw materials from place to place.Â  If private landowners had been able \r\n  to prevent passage over their stream and river beds, the flow of commerce would \r\n  have been seriously hindered, if not made impossible.Â  Implicit, therefore, \r\n  in this early concept of navigability is the requirement that the status of \r\n  a body of water as navigable hinged upon its utility as a mode of transport \r\n  for people and goods.\r\nThough the definition of navigability has expanded to include recreational \r\n  uses in addition to commercial ones, the need to demonstrate a connection beyond \r\n  an isolated locus to other navigable waters remains.Â  Otherwise, we confront \r\n  the untenable result that any backyard pond would necessarily be navigable.Â  \r\n  Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine any body of water of noticeable size \r\n  that would not be navigable and therefore subject to public use and enjoyment.\r\nThis common-sense approach to navigability is supported in our stateâ€™s \r\n  law.Â  First, we note the proclamation of section 49-1-10 thatÂ  all navigable \r\n  streams shall remain forever free as â€œcommon highwaysâ€ for all to use.Â  This \r\n  important language leaves little doubt that the nub of the purpose behind leaving \r\n  our navigable waterways open is to ensure citizens can move freely about the \r\n  state without interference and without fear of being unavoidably subject to \r\n  trespass actions by traveling on our waterways.Â  \r\nWe also find support for this view in our case law. Â In a seminal case setting \r\n  forth the modern test for navigability, Heyward v. Farmersâ€™ Mining Co., \r\n  our supreme court emphasized the primary policy objective that navigable waters \r\n  remain open to ensure ease of travel, whether for commerce or recreation:\r\n\r\nIt is not every small creek in which a fishing skiff or \r\n  gunning canoe can be made to float at high water which is deemed navigable; \r\n  but, in order to have this character, it must be navigable for some purpose \r\n  useful to trade or agriculture. But this language is applied to the capacity \r\n  of the stream, and is not intended to be a strict enumeration of the uses to \r\n  which it must be actually applied in order to give it that character. Navigable \r\n  streams are highways; and a traveler for pleasure is as fully entitled to protection \r\n  in using a public way, whether by land or water, as a traveler for business. \r\n\r\n\r\n42 S.C. 138, 155, 19 S.E. 963, 972 (1894).\r\nMore recently, in State v. Head, 330 S.C. 79, 498 S.E.2d 389 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997), the court examined whether a 246 acre lake was navigable.Â Â  In that criminal \r\n  trespass action, the court considered whether a fisherman was entitled to access \r\n  the lake.Â  The State argued the lake was not navigable because it was sealed \r\n  off from any other navigable waters.Â  Id. at 91, 498 S.E.2d at 395.Â  \r\n  We rejected that argument under the specific facts of the case because the lake \r\n  in question was separated from other navigable waters by a dam, an obstruction \r\n  our courts have held does not render a waterway non-navigable. Id. at \r\n  90-91, 498 S.E.2d at 394-95 (citing State ex rel. Guste v. Two Oâ€™Clock Bayou \r\n  Land Co., 365 So.2d 1174 (La. App. 1978); 65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters \r\n  Â§ 5(3) (1966)).Â  In our analysis, however, we recognized and distinguished from \r\n  the facts of Head the rule that a small inland lake having no navigable \r\n  outlet is not navigable.Â  Id. at 91 fn. 3, 498 S.E.2d at 395 fn. 3. \r\nIndeed, other jurisdictions have declined to extend the reach of navigability \r\n  to isolated inland lakes and ponds.Â  For example, in Lakeside Park Co. v. \r\n  Forsmark, 153 A.2d 486 (Pa. 1959), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court addressed \r\n  whether a nearly 150 acre lake with no outlet was navigable.Â  Applying a standard \r\n  for determining navigability similar to our own, the court found the lake was \r\n  not navigable, opining:\r\n\r\nWe think that the concept of navigability should not be \r\n  limited alone by lake or river, or by commercial use, or by the size of water \r\n  or its capacity to float a boat. Rather it should depend upon whether water \r\n  is used or usable as a broad highroad for commerce and the transport in quantity \r\n  of goods and people, which is the rule naturally applicable to rivers and to \r\n  large lakes, or whether with all of the mentioned factors counted in the water \r\n  remains a local focus of attraction, which is the rule sensibly applicable to \r\n  shallow streams and to small lakes and ponds. The basic difference is that between \r\n  a trade-route and a point of interest. The first is a public use and the second \r\n  private.\r\n\r\nId. at 489; see also, e.g., Adirondack League \r\n  Club, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 706 N.E.2d 1192, 1195 (N.Y. 1998) (holding that \r\n  â€œthe central premise of the common-law rule remains the sameâ€”in order to be \r\n  navigable-in-fact, a river must provide practical utility to the public as a \r\n  means for transportation. Thus, while the purpose or type of use remains important, \r\n  of paramount concern is the capacity of the river for transport, whether for \r\n  trade or travel.â€).\r\nAfter thoroughly canvassing the record before us, we find no evidence to suggest \r\n  Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond serves any useful purpose for transport or travelâ€”whether \r\n  for commerce or recreationâ€”beyond the immediate perimeter of its banks. The \r\n  testimony of Richard Wheeler, a South Carolina Department of Natural Resources \r\n  officer, indicates the streams flowing into and out ofÂ  the pond are not capable \r\n  of supporting valuable floatage.Â Â  Furthermore, this testimony is bolstered \r\n  by that of a member of the Colony who testified he had personally walked up \r\n  and down the incoming and outgoing streams and they were non-navigable.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we conclude the special referee correctly determined Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond is not \r\n  a navigable waterway under South Carolina law.Â  Accordingly, the pond is not \r\n  subject to a general right of the public to access its waters.\r\nII.Â  Riparian or Littoral RightsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nHaving found there is no right of the general public to access Whiteâ€™s Mill \r\n  Pond as a navigable watercourse, we must next decide whether the abutting landowners \r\n  have any independent riparian or littoral property rights to access the pond.Â  \r\n  These landowners claim they have such rights to access and make reasonable use \r\n  of the pond.Â  The Colony, on the other hand, claims its purported ownership \r\n  of the entire bed of the pond entitles it to exclusive control over the use \r\n  of the pondâ€™s surface waters.Â Â Â Â  \r\nUnder the common law, owners of land along rivers, streams, lakes and other \r\n  bodies of water possess a property right incident to their ownership of the \r\n  bank and bed of a watercourse that is distinct from those rights that may be \r\n  enjoyed by the public at large.Â  In general, these special rights allow abutting \r\n  landowners to make â€œreasonable useâ€ of the body of water for any lawful purpose, \r\n  whether for commerce or recreation.Â  Lowe v. Ottaray Mills, 93 S.C. 420, \r\n  428, 77 S.E. 135, 136 (1913).Â  These rights are subject to the limitation that \r\n  the use may not interfere with the like rights of those above, below, or on \r\n  the opposite shore. See Mason v. Apalache Mills, 81 S.C. 554, \r\n  559, 62 S.E. 399, 401 (1908).Â  With regard to these rights, there is a distinction \r\n  in classification that our courts have indicated a desire to strictly observe:Â  \r\n  owners of land along rivers and streams are said to hold â€œriparianâ€ rights, \r\n  while owners of land abutting oceans, seas, or lakes, are said to hold â€œlittoralâ€ \r\n  rights. [2] Â  Because Whiteâ€™s \r\n  Mill Pond falls into the latter category, our discussion will address whether \r\n  the abutting landowners possess any â€œlittoralâ€ rights.\r\nThough our state has recognized the general right of access enjoyed by littoral \r\n  property owners, the question presented in this case regarding who may control \r\n  the surface waters of a private, man-made, non-navigable pond, when the pond \r\n  bed is owned entirely by an adjoining landowner has not been addressed by our \r\n  courts.Â  See generally, Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State, \r\n  347 S.C. 96, 109, 552 S.E.2d 778, 785 (Ct. App. 2001) (opining that â€œ[t]he extent \r\n  of littoral rights in this jurisdiction is an unanswered questionâ€).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we first resort to the law of other states to understand whether littoral rights \r\n  obtain in these circumstances.\r\nCanvassing the case law in this area, it appears two views have emerged on \r\n  this issue: one is generally termed the â€œcommon law rule,â€ while the other is \r\n  known as the â€œcivil law rule.â€\r\nUnder the common law rule, â€œthe owners of the fee in land underlying the surface \r\n  waters of a man-made, nonnavigable lake are entitled to the exclusive control \r\n  of that portion of the lake lying over the land as to which they own the fee.â€ \r\n  Wehby v. Turpin, 710 So.2d 1243, 1247 (Ala. 1998).Â  Consequently, owners \r\n  of all or part of a pond or lake bed have the right to exclude others from accessing \r\n  or using the surface waters above their property. \r\nA seminal case, cited repeatedly across jurisdictions as a thoughtful application \r\n  of the common law rule, is Anderson v. Bell, 433 So. 2d 1202 (Fla. 1983).Â  \r\n  The facts of Anderson are similar to the circumstances surrounding the \r\n  present dispute over Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond.Â  In that case, the plaintiff, Anderson, \r\n  purchased a tract of land traversed by a small, non-navigable creek.Â  He later \r\n  excavated the low-lying areas of the property and constructed an earthen dam.Â  \r\n  This damming resulted in the creation of a â€œsubstantialâ€ lake that partially \r\n  flooded several adjoining parcels.Â  Two of the neighboring property owners whose \r\n  land had been flooded, Lewis and Watson, sued Anderson for the damage caused \r\n  to their property.Â  A settlement agreement was reached whereby Lewis and Watson \r\n  conveyed to Anderson a flowage easement that allowed Anderson the right and \r\n  privilege to flood their land.Â  The easement, however, expressly reserved to \r\n  Lewis and Watson the title and beneficial use of their land. Lewis and Watson \r\n  later sold their property to Bell.Â  Anderson brought action to enjoin Bell from \r\n  fishing and boating upon the surface waters above the bottom land owned by Anderson. \r\n  Id. at 1202-1203.Â  The Florida Supreme Court found Bell could be excluded \r\n  from the surface waters above Andersonâ€™s property, holding:\r\n\r\nthe owner of property that lies adjacent to or beneath a \r\n  man-made, non-navigable water body is not entitled to the beneficial \r\n  use of the surface waters of the entire water body by sole virtue of the fact \r\n  that he/she owns contiguous lands. . . . this is the established rule in other \r\n  jurisdictions as well as the common law.\r\n\r\nId. at 1204 (emphasis in original).Â  The Anderson court opined \r\n  that its decision to follow the common law rule was rooted in the recognition \r\n  that â€œa lake developerâ€™s expectations in his investmentâ€ must be preserved:\r\n\r\nBecause the construction of a man-made water body often \r\n  involves the expenditure of substantial sums of money and the expense is not, \r\n  as a rule, divided proportionately among the various abutting owners, the individual \r\n  making the expenditure is justified in expecting that superior privileges will \r\n  inure to him in return for his investment.\r\n\r\nId. at 1205.Â  The court therefore concluded that: \r\n\r\n[W]e believe a contrary rule may serve to dissuade Florida \r\n  homeowners and investors from making improvements that not only increase property \r\n  values but also aesthetically improve adjacent lands, since they would run the \r\n  risk of losing some of their property rights to other people merely because \r\n  the water body touches anotherâ€™s property. In the event that the water happens \r\n  to take a course that would result in the flowage over public lands, the entire \r\n  water body would become accessible to numerous piscators, bathers and boaters, \r\n  thereby destroying the property ownersâ€™ investment benefits.\r\n\r\nId. at 1205-1206.Â  The common law rule has been adopted by numerous \r\n  other state appellate courts, including courts in Alabama, Indiana, Georgia, \r\n  Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey, and which is acknowledged in at least \r\n  two states as the majority rule. See, e.g., Wehby v. Turpin, \r\n  710 So.2d 1243, 1249 (Ala. 1998) (deciding that â€œ[w]e are bound to follow the \r\n  majority common law rule . . . and hold that the owners of land extending \r\n  beneath artificial or man-made lakes, not navigable as a matter of law, have \r\n  surface-water rights only in the surface waters above their landâ€) (emphasis \r\n  added); Berger Farms, Inc. v. Estes, 662 N.E.2d 654, 656 (Ind. Ct. App. \r\n  1996) (holding that â€œ[i]t is well established that the owner of land, upon which \r\n  there is located a nonnavigable lake, owns and has the right to control the \r\n  surface of the lakeâ€); Lanier v. Ocean Pond Fishing Club, Inc., 322 S.E.2d \r\n  494, 496 (Ga. 1984) (holding that â€œGeorgia follows the common law rule . . . \r\n  that the owner of a bed of a nonnavigable lake has the exclusive right to the \r\n  use of the surface of the waters above and may exclude other bed owners and \r\n  fence off his portionâ€); Black v. Williams, 417 So. 2d 911, 912 (1982) \r\n  (following â€œthe majority rule . . . that owners of the fee in the land \r\n  beneath [an artificial or man-made] lake, in the absence of some statute or \r\n  covenant or agreement to the contrary, have exclusive control over the water \r\n  over their respective portionsâ€) (emphasis added); Wickouski v. Swift, \r\n  124 S.E.2d 892, 895 (Va. 1962) (holding that â€œcontrol of the water above the \r\n  land is an incident to the ownership of the land,â€ entitling property owners \r\n  to â€œexclusive control and use of the waters above their portion of the bed of \r\n  the pondâ€); Baker v. Normanoch Assn., Inc., 136 A.2d 645 (N.J. 1957) \r\n  (holding that â€œ[t]he rule in [New Jersey] is that the general public [has] no \r\n  rights to the recreational use of a private lake, such rights being exclusive \r\n  in the owner of the bed . . . .â€).Â  Some treatises have also referenced the \r\n  common law rule as the predominant view.Â  See, e.g, 78 Am. Jur. \r\n  2d Waters Â§ 37 (2002) (commenting that â€œthe general rule is that riparian \r\n  rights do not ordinarily attach to artificial water bodies or streams. . . . \r\n  The owner of property that lies adjacent to or beneath a manmade, nonnavigable \r\n  water body is not entitled to the beneficial use of the surface waters of the \r\n  entire water body by the sole virtue of the fact that he or she owns contiguous \r\n  lands.â€); C.C. Marvel, Annotation, Rights of Fishing, Boating, Bathing, or \r\n  the Like in Inland Lakes, 57 A.L.R.2d 569 (Supp. 2003) (noting that â€œ[i]t \r\n  has been held or recognized that there are no riparian rights of fishing, boating, \r\n  bathing, or the like, as the case may be, in a lake the bed of which is owned \r\n  by one other than the riparian ownerâ€).\r\nUnder the â€œcivil law ruleâ€ adopted by other jurisdictions, an owner \r\n  of land contiguous to a lake or pond is, purely by virtue of littoral rights, \r\n  entitled to the reasonable use and enjoyment of the entireÂ  body of waterâ€”whether \r\n  navigable or not. See Johnson v. Seifert, 100 N.W.2d 689, 696-97 \r\n  (Minn. 1960) (expressly rejecting the common law rule and holding that an â€œabutting \r\n  or riparian owner of a lake . . . has a right to make such use of the lake over \r\n  its entire surface, in common with all other abutting owners . . . regardless \r\n  of the navigable or public character of the lake and regardless of the ownership \r\n  of the bed thereofâ€).Â  States applying the civil law rule emphasize the importance \r\n  of promoting the beneficial use and enjoyment of lakes and ponds as a recreational \r\n  resource. See, e.g., id. at 695 (opining that â€œstates which \r\n  like Minnesota have extensive waters of recreational or commercial value hold \r\n  that an abutting or riparian owner has a right of reasonable use of the entire \r\n  overlying water, and no distinction is made between navigable and nonnavigable, \r\n  meandered or unmeandered, or public or private lakesâ€).\r\nA recent application of the civil law rule may be found in Ace \r\n  Equipment Sales, Inc. v. Buccino, 848 A.2d 474 (Conn. App. 2004).Â  The material \r\n  facts of Ace Equipment largely mirror those of the present case. At the \r\n  center of that case was a twenty acre non-navigable, man-made pond surrounded \r\n  by several parcels of property held by various owners.Â  The pond bed was owned \r\n  entirely by one of the abutting property owners, who sought to exclude the other \r\n  adjoining landowners from any access to the pond waters. Id. at 476-77. \r\n  The court concluded that â€œowners of subaqueous land under a pond or lake may \r\n  not prevent the use, by abutting owners, who control the existence of the pond \r\n  itself, for recreational purposes of the surface water above the bed of a pond \r\n  that they own.â€ Id. at 480. [3] Â  \r\nBased on our review of these cases, we follow the common law rule \r\n  as set out above.Â  First, we note that, as a general rule, South Carolina law \r\n  in the area of water rights generally hews closely to the common law. See, \r\n  e.g., Lowcountry Open Land Trust, 347 S.C. at 110, 552 S.E.2d \r\n  at 785-86 (adopting common law rule regarding the ability of riparian owners \r\n  to wharf over navigable waters); Horry County v. Woodward, 282 S.C. 366, \r\n  369-70, 318 S.E.2d 584, 586 (Ct. App. 1984) (recognizing â€œthe general common \r\n  law rule that accretions by a natural alluvial action to riparian or littoral \r\n  lands become the property of the riparian or littoral owner whose lands are \r\n  added toâ€); McCullough v. Wall, 38 S.C.L. (4 Rich.) 68, 86 (1850) (adopting \r\n  and applying the common law rule that the owner of the soil over which a non-navigable \r\n  stream or river flows has the exclusive right of fishing unless some other person \r\n  can show a grant or prescription in â€œderogation of the right naturally attached \r\n  to the ownership of the soilâ€); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-1-50 \r\n  (1976) (providing that â€œ[a]ll, and every part, of the common law of England, \r\n  where it is not altered by the Code or inconsistent with the Constitution or \r\n  laws of this State, is hereby continued in full force and effect in the same \r\n  manner as before the adoption of this sectionâ€).Â  Therefore, we think that, \r\n  when confronted with a decision whether to follow a common law approach or follow \r\n  a civil law rule, our courtsâ€”absent any other considerationsâ€”would generally \r\n  follow the common law rule.\r\nSecond, we think the underlying policy of protecting the financial \r\n  investments and expectations of individuals who make capital improvements to \r\n  their propertyâ€”a policy compellingly articulated in Anderson v. Bell \r\n  and other cases adopting the common law ruleâ€”is in accord with the general jurisprudence \r\n  of our state. [4] Â  Property owners should be able make improvements \r\n  to their real property without fear that their investment will be diminished \r\n  should they create a body of water that touches upon the property line of a \r\n  neighboring landowner.Â  Of course, neighboring property owners are not foreclosed \r\n  from gaining access to an abutting non-navigable, man-made body of water.Â  Any \r\n  such abutting property owner is free to bargain with the owner of the pond or \r\n  lake for the conveyance of an easement or some other right of access to its \r\n  waters.\r\nFor these reasons, we apply the common law rule to the present case.Â  Therefore, \r\n  to the extent the Colony is the fee simple owner of the pond bed, it has the \r\n  exclusive right to the use of the surface waters above its property and may \r\n  exclude all others from access to those waters.\r\nIII.Â  Land Boundaries and Damages\r\nThe special referee declined to adjudicate the unsettled boundaries between \r\n  the parties.Â  There is at least some contradiction in the boundaries advanced \r\n  between the Colony and the abutting landowners.Â  In light of our determination \r\n  that a mere abutting landowner does not have any right to use the pond, it is \r\n  necessary to determine if they are simply abutting landowners or if they hold \r\n  title to land that is covered by portions of the pond.Â  If they hold title to \r\n  portions of the bed of the pond, then those landowners have the right to use \r\n  those portions of the pond immediately above their titled property.Â  Similarly, \r\n  they have the right to exclude others from those portions of the lake.Â  See \r\n  generally South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas v. Hix, 306 S.C. 173, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 582 (1991).Â  They also have the right to cut down trees and brush \r\n  over the land to which they have title.Â  If, however, they do not have title \r\n  to the land, the Colony can maintain its suit for trespass.Â  See Spigener \r\n  v. Cooner, 42 S.C.L. (8 Rich.) 301, 304-305 (1855)\r\nSettlement of the boundaries between the various parties is not only necessary \r\n  to delineate the respective rights of the landowners to use of the pond, but \r\n  it is also essential for the establishment of damages.Â  In declining to set \r\n  the precise boundaries between the parties, the referee opted instead to utilize \r\n  the term â€œoverlap property.â€Â  Such a vague description leaves unanswered the \r\n  rights, if any, of the abutting property owners to use the pond and further \r\n  renders the damage awards effectively unreviewable.Â  We are compelled therefore \r\n  to vacate the damage awards.Â  \r\nWe remand to the trial court to determine the precise property lines of the \r\n  owners of property abutting the pond. The trial court shall reconsider the matter \r\n  of damages in light of the true boundary lines.Â  Damages, if any, should be \r\n  ascertained on the existing record. \r\n  [5]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find: (1) Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond is not a publicly accessible \r\n  navigable watercourse under South Carolina law; (2) the abutting landowners \r\n  do not possess any littoral right of access to the pond; and (3) the question \r\n  of damages cannot be determined absent a determination of the precise property \r\n  boundaries.Â  The order of the special referee is therefore affirmed in part, \r\n  vacated in part and the case is remanded for a determination of boundaries and \r\n  damages.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] Â The special referee also found as fact that â€œ[t]he water in Whiteâ€™s Mill \r\n    Pond belongs to the State of South Carolina as do the fish contained therein.â€Â  \r\n    This finding is wholly incongruous with the express holding that the pond \r\n    is not a navigable watercourse under South Carolina law to which the general \r\n    public would enjoy a right of access.Â  Though this finding is not explicitly \r\n    appealed by either party, we conclude it would be inappropriate to bind the \r\n    resolution of this matter based on this finding under the â€œlaw of the caseâ€ \r\n    doctrine.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Housing Corp., \r\n    338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an unappealed ruling \r\n    is the law of the case).\r\n  In construing a judgeâ€™s \r\n    order, we must do so in light of the judgeâ€™s intent as discerned from the \r\n    order as a whole.Â  See Weil v. Weil, 299 S.C. 84, 90, 382 S.E.2d \r\n    471, 474 (Ct. App. 1989) (holding that â€œ[t]he determinative factor is the \r\n    intent of the court, as gathered, not from an isolated part thereof, but from \r\n    all the parts of the judgment itself. Hence, in construing a judgment, it \r\n    should be examined and considered in its entiretyâ€).Â  Adhering to this principle, \r\n    this court has refused to hold parties bound by language in a lower court \r\n    order that we found was not necessary to the decision of the issues presented.Â  \r\n    Id. at 89, 382 S.E.2d at 473. (refusing to apply the â€œdoctrine of the \r\n    law of the caseâ€ toÂ  language found to be â€œmere dicta, an expression or statement \r\n    by the court on a matter not necessarily involved in the case nor necessary \r\n    to a decision thereofâ€).\r\n  Viewing the special refereeâ€™s order as a whole, therefore, \r\n    the finding that the water and fish of Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond belong to the state \r\n    stands as a non-sequitur in the otherwise coherent analysis.Â  At the outset \r\n    of his order, the special referee stated that the case turned on two issuesâ€”â€œwhether \r\n    Whiteâ€™s Mill Pond is a navigable watercourseâ€ and â€œwhether the [abutting landowners] \r\n    have riparian rights.â€Â  The special refereeâ€™s subsequent discussion of the \r\n    applicable law only addresses these issues.Â  No legal principle is cited or \r\n    discussed in the order which supports a finding that the water and fish in \r\n    the pond belong to the state.Â  Indeed, when questioned by this court at oral \r\n    argument, counsel for both parties were unable to explain how this \r\n    finding related to the special refereeâ€™s explicit determinations.Â  We are \r\n    left with no choice, therefore, but to view this isolated language as an anomaly \r\n    that is most probably the product of a labyrinthine factual and legal landscape \r\n    rather than view it as a finding necessary to the refereeâ€™s decision.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  [2] See Lowcountry Open Land Trust \r\n    v. State, 347 S.C. 96, 108, 552 S.E.2d 778, 785 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting \r\n    that â€œ[Riparian] is sometimes used as relating to the shore of the sea or \r\n    other tidal water, or of a lake or other considerable body of water not having \r\n    the character of a watercourse. But this is not accurate. The proper word \r\n    to be employed in such connections is â€˜littoral.â€™â€) (quoting Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n    1327 (6th ed. 1990)).\r\n\r\n \r\n  [3]  But see Ace Equip.

App. \r\n  2003) (â€œA party cannot raise issue for first time in Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion \r\n  which could have been raised at trial.â€).\r\nThe first time SCDOT argued the enactment of section 57-5-1050 \r\n  alleviates DOTâ€™s necessity to compensate Tallent for an actionable taking of \r\n  her property was in its motion for reconsideration under Rules 52 and 59, SCRCP.Â  \r\n  In the motion, SCDOT asserted section 57-5-1050 in the nature of a defense, \r\n  which would abrogate the requirement to pay compensation for any actionable \r\n  taking of Tallentâ€™s property.Â  However, section 57-5-1050 was never raised as \r\n  a defense at trial.Â  Therefore, because SCDOT failed to do so, the issue is \r\n  not preserved.Â  See, e.g., Kiawah Prop. Owners Group, 359 S.C. \r\n  at 113, 597 S.E.2d at 149.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNon-abutting property \r\n   \r\nSCDOT argues the master erred in finding an actionable taking occurred.Â  \r\n  Specifically, SCDOT alleges its actions do not constitute an actionable taking \r\n  of Tallentâ€™s property because her property does not abut any street to which \r\n  access was affected by SCDOT construction project.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to find an inverse condemnation, the landowner must demonstrate: \r\n  (1) an affirmative, positive, aggressive act on the part of a governmental agency, \r\n  (2) resulting in a taking, (3) for a public use, (4) with some degree of permanence.Â  \r\n  See Gray v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Public Transp., \r\n  311 S.C. 144, 149, 427 S.E.2d 899, 902 (Ct. App. 1992). The only element in \r\n  dispute here is that of a taking. \r\nAn actual physical taking is not necessary to entitle a property owner \r\n  to just compensation under the constitutional prohibition against taking private \r\n  property for public use without just compensation to the property owner.Â  Gasque \r\n  v. Town of Conway, 194 S.C. 15, 8 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1940), overruled on \r\n  other grounds by McCall by Andrews v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 247, \r\n  329 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1985) (overruling Gasque to the extent it held that \r\n  an action may not be maintained against the State without its consent).Â  In \r\n  Gasque, the supreme court held:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of this State (Art. 1, Sec. 17) provides that \r\n  â€˜private property shall not be taken . . .Â  for public use without just compensation \r\n  being first made therefor.â€™Â  In construing this provision of the Constitution, \r\n  we have held, along with many other courts, that an actual physical taking of \r\n  property is not necessary to entitle its owner to compensation. A manâ€™s property \r\n  may be taken, within the meaning of this provision, although his title and possession \r\n  remain undisturbed. To deprive him of the ordinary beneficial use and enjoyment \r\n  of his property is, in law, equivalent to the taking of it, and is as much a \r\n  â€˜takingâ€™ as though the property itself were actually appropriated.\r\nProperty in a thing consists not merely in its ownership and \r\n  possession, but in the unrestricted right of use, enjoyment, and disposal. Anything \r\n  which destroys one or more of these elements of property to that extent destroys \r\n  the property itself. It must be conceded that the substantial value of property \r\n  lies in its use.Â  If the right of use be denied, the value of the property is \r\n  annihilated, and ownership is rendered a barren right.Â  \r\nThe constitutional prohibition against taking private property \r\n  for public use without just compensation must have been intended to protect \r\n  all the essential elements of ownership which make property valuable, including, \r\n  of course, the right of user, andÂ Â  the right of enjoyment.\r\n\r\n194 S.C. at Â­Â­21, 8 S.E.2d at 873 (citations omitted). \r\nMoreover, \r\n  South Carolina courts have directly addressed the rights of a non-abutting landowner.Â  \r\n  In City of Rock Hill v. Cothran, 209 S.C. 357, 40 S.E.2d 239 (1946), \r\n  the supreme court established the rights of a landowner to recover damages for \r\n  impairment of access when the landownerâ€™s property does not immediately abut \r\n  the part of the street closed.Â  The Cothran court held:\r\n\r\nThe test is, not whether the property abuts, but whether there \r\n  is a special injury, and the first practical question which presents itself \r\n  is whether one whose property does not abut immediately on the part of the street \r\n  vacated . . . is so specially injured as to be entitled to recover compensation \r\n  on the ground that his access is cut off in one direction, but not in the opposite \r\n  direction.\r\n\r\n209 S.C. at 368, 40 S.E.2d \r\n  at 243-44.Â  See also Hardin v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., \r\n  359 S.C. 244, 251, 597 S.E.2d 814, 817 (Ct. App. 2004) (restating the Cothran \r\n  test for recovery is not whether the land abuts the affected road but rather \r\n  has the landowner suffered a special injury); Gray, 311 S.C. at 152, \r\n  427 S.E.2d at 903-04 (â€œUnder the Cothran decision, the lack of a physical \r\n  entry upon Gray's leasehold is not dispositive of the â€˜takingâ€™ issue. The critical \r\n  question was whether the closing of the intersection affected the value of Grayâ€™s \r\n  property in some special way not common to the other property in the area.â€).\r\nIn the present action, Tallentâ€™s property does not abut any part of \r\n  the affected Highway 123; however, her property abuts Old Easley Bridge Road, \r\n  a portion of which was closed as a result of SCDOT construction project.Â  Old \r\n  Easley Bridge Road provided Tallent immediate access to Highway 123, which was \r\n  terminated by the construction of SCDOT.Â  Therefore, under the Cothran \r\n  test, we reject SCDOTâ€™s contention there can be no actionable taking because \r\n  Tallentâ€™s property does not abut the affected Highway 123.Â  Rather, to determine \r\n  whether an actionable taking occurred, we must resolve whether Tallent suffered \r\n  a special injury, as a non-abutting landowner, due to the construction by SCDOT.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSpecial \r\n  Injury  \r\nSCDOT argues Tallent did not demonstrate a special injury entitling \r\n  her to compensation.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Cothran court defined what constitutes a special injury \r\n  in South Carolina:Â  \r\n\r\nIt is well settled that an owner is not entitled to recover damages \r\n  unless he has sustained an injury different in kind and not merely in degree \r\n  from that suffered by the public at large.Â  If it appears that there is a special \r\n  injury, the owner may recover damages notwithstanding his property does not \r\n  abut, as in this case, on the part of the street vacated, because this amounts \r\n  to a â€œtakingâ€.\r\n\r\nCothran, 209 S.C. \r\n  at 368, 40 S.E.2d at 243 (citations omitted).Â  â€œAn injury for which damages \r\n  must be paid is injury to the property itself.Â  The property itself must suffer \r\n  some diminution in substance, or be rendered intrinsically less valuable by \r\n  reason of public use.â€Â  Gray, 311 S.C. at 151, 427 S.E.2d at 903 (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  The fact that access to property is not cut off in either direction \r\n  by the actions of a governmental agency does not affect the issue of taking, \r\n  provided special injury is shown, but is to be considered in determining damages.Â  \r\n  See Cothran, 209 S.C. at 370, 40 S.E.2d at 244.\r\nTallent presented \r\n  two witnesses, a licensed real-estate broker and an expert in the appraisal \r\n  of commercial real estate to establish special injury.Â  The testimony established \r\n  the damages suffered by Tallent as a result of SCDOT construction and removal \r\n  of access to Highway 123 were different in kind from those suffered by the public \r\n  at large.Â  Both the expert appraiser and realtor testified the access closure \r\n  affected Tallentâ€™s property differently from other commercial properties because \r\n  she lost â€œwalk-inâ€ business.Â  The expert appraiser also testified that her business \r\n  losses differed from those in the area because the other entities were â€œdestinationâ€ \r\n  businesses, such that people will seek them out regardless of the lack of immediate \r\n  access from Highway 123.Â  Both witnesses also testified that while the surrounding \r\n  residential area benefited from the actions of SCDOT, the value of Tallentâ€™s \r\n  commercial property had been adversely affected.Â  The realtor further testified \r\n  that there had been no interest in the property due to the current lack of access \r\n  to Highway 123.Â  \r\nTallentâ€™s \r\n  witnesses demonstrated that she suffered special injury different in kind and \r\n  not merely degree sufficient to satisfy the Cothran test.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the public at large lost mere access to Highway 123 by means of Old Easley Bridge \r\n  Road, while Tallent was deprived of both access and property value.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find Tallent entitled to just compensation for the actionable taking of her \r\n  property and the decision of the master is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  But see Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV \r\n    Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v.

Hoisington of Charleston, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Pachak, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  The State appeals the trial courtâ€™s suppression of seized \r\n  drugs the State intended to admit in this drug prosecution.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nOn Friday, June 7, 2002, South Carolina Highway Patrol Troopers \r\n  Anthony Bokern and Marty Housand arrested Michael Governor for open container \r\n  and trafficking crack cocaine.Â  Governor was a passenger in a vehicle stopped \r\n  for a window tint violation.Â  While Housand dealt with the driver, who was driving \r\n  under suspension, Bokern attempted to secure the scene.Â  When Bokern began placing \r\n  Governor under arrest for an open container violation, Governor reached for \r\n  his back pocket to pull out a bag.Â  Bokern seized the brown paper bag from Governorâ€™s \r\n  pocket, glanced inside to make certain there was no weapon, and handed it to \r\n  Housand.Â  \r\nThe bag contained multiple clear plastic baggies.Â  Housand weighed and field-tested \r\n  the contents and obtained a positive result for crack cocaine.Â  Housand did \r\n  not have a BEST evidence bag with him at the time of the arrest so he placed \r\n  the drugs in an unsealed evidence bag in the trunk of his patrol car. \r\n  [1] Â  The drugs remained there over the weekend.Â  On the following Monday \r\n  morning when he returned to work, Housand placed the drugs in a BEST evidence \r\n  bag.Â  On Wednesday when he was visiting a fellow officer at a hospital in Columbia, \r\n  he gave the drugs to the evidence custodian.Â  The custodianâ€™s supervisor had \r\n  set up a separate room in the hospital for the custodian to accept evidence \r\n  while the officers were visiting their fellow patrolman in the hospital.Â  The \r\n  custodian transported the drugs to SLED that same day.Â  \r\nGovernor was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and \r\n  possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.Â  The trial court held \r\n  a suppression hearing regarding the drug evidence seized by the police.Â  The \r\n  trial court suppressed the evidence â€œbased on [the officersâ€™] failure to comply \r\n  with their own guidelines.â€Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State claims the trial court erred in suppressing evidence of seized drugs \r\n  because it established a sufficient chain of custody for the drugs.Â  We agree.\r\nA party offering fungible items, such as drugs, as evidence must establish \r\n  a chain of custody as far as practicable.Â  State v. Joseph, 328 S.C. \r\n  352, 364, 491 S.E.2d 275, 281 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Where the substance passed through \r\n  several hands, the evidence must not leave to conjecture who had it and what \r\n  was done with it between the seizure and the analysis.Â  â€œWhile the proof of \r\n  chain of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering, it must establish \r\n  a complete chain of evidence as far as practicable.â€Â  Id.Â  In \r\n  applying this rule, our courts have found evidence inadmissible â€œonly where \r\n  there is a missing link in the chain of possession because the identity of those \r\n  who handled the [evidence] was not established at least as far as practicable.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2001).Â  By contrast, \r\n  where the identity of those who handled the evidence is established, â€œevidence \r\n  regarding its care goes only to the weight of the specimen as credible evidenceâ€ \r\n  and not to its admissibility.Â  Id.; see also State v. Taylor, \r\n  360 S.C. 18, 25, 598 S.E.2d 735, 738 (Ct. App. 2004) (en banc) (holding where \r\n  the identity of each person in the chain handling evidence is established and \r\n  the manner of handling is reasonably demonstrated, suppression of the evidence \r\n  is abuse of discretion, absent proof of tampering, bad faith, or ill motive).Â  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Smith, 326 S.C. 39, 40, 482 S.E.2d 777, 778 (1997), a police \r\n  officer took a seized vial of blood home with him and placed it in his refrigerator.Â  \r\n  He did not submit the vial to SLED until two days later.Â  At trial, each person \r\n  who handled the blood samples testified.Â  Id. at 41, 482 S.E.2d at 779.Â  \r\n  Because there was no evidence the sample was tampered with in any manner and \r\n  the police officer testified the sample was in the same condition when he submitted \r\n  it to SLED as when he received it, our supreme court held the storage of the \r\n  blood sample in the police officerâ€™s home went to the weight of the evidence, \r\n  not its admissibility.Â  Id. at 41-42, 482 S.E.2d at 779.Â  \r\nIn this case, the \r\n  State produced evidence of each person in the chain of custody and the manner \r\n  in which the drugs were handled.Â  Bokern testified he handed the drugs to Housand \r\n  who then weighed and field-tested them.Â  Housand then placed them inside his \r\n  trunk, where they remained until Monday morning.Â  Housand testified no one else \r\n  had keys to his patrol car, and no one else drove the vehicle that weekend.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, he did not â€œalter or mess with the substance in anyway.â€Â  Additionally, \r\n  Housand testified that on the day of the hearing the drugs were in substantially \r\n  the same condition as they were the day of the arrest.Â  Lastly, Dayle Blackmon, \r\n  the evidence custodian, testified Housand gave her the drugs at the hospital \r\n  on Wednesday, June 12, 2002, and she delivered them to SLED.Â  \r\nThe trial court \r\n  did not find any missing link in the custodial chain or proof of tampering, \r\n  bad faith, or ill motive.Â  Instead, the court suppressed the evidence based \r\n  on the officersâ€™ failure to comply with the Department of Public Safetyâ€™s policy \r\n  directives on evidence.Â  The directives require â€œ[a]ll property/evidence [to] \r\n  be submitted to the evidence custodian by the end of the shift or as soon as \r\n  possible thereafter.â€Â  In Section IX, the directives also require â€œ[a]ll controlled \r\n  substances . . . [to] be transported for analysis within 72 hours of the seizure.â€Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the â€œ[e]vidence/property shall not be stored in the patrol vehicle \r\n  except when being transported from the scene to the place of storage . . . . \r\n  [and] shall not remain with the officer for a prolonged period of time.â€Â  \r\nObviously, Housand \r\n  did not comply with these department directives.Â  However, although this failure \r\n  was the proper subject of cross-examination of the witness for credibility, \r\n  it was not a proper basis for suppression.Â  Because the State presented a complete \r\n  chain of custody, the trial court abused its discretion in suppressing the drug \r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 620-21, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429 \r\n  (2003) (holding rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence are within the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion).Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n ANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  All controlled substances sent to SLED for analysis must be in a BEST \r\n    evidence bag.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3926","title":"Brenco v.

Carotti, all of \r\n  Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Brenco brought this action against the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Transportation (SCDOT), seeking deed rescission and claiming inverse \r\n  condemnation.Â  The trial court refused to rescind the deed and found Brenco \r\n  failed to prove damages related to the inverse condemnation.Â  We affirm in part, \r\n  reverse in part, and remand.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nBrenco owns property located along Highway 501 in Horry County.Â  \r\n  The property was formerly the site of a Brendleâ€™s store, which closed in 1997.Â  \r\n  In 1998, SCDOT purchased 6,689 square feet of Brencoâ€™s parking lot in order \r\n  to build a frontage road.Â  The negotiations and deed referenced aspects of SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  August 18, 1993 road plans for development of the frontage road including the \r\n  creation of â€œcontrolled access facilitiesâ€ as needed.Â  \r\nAfter initially alerting them of the project, SCDOTâ€™s appraiser, \r\n  Clyde Ratchford, met with Brenco representatives at the property and provided \r\n  them with a plan sheet.Â  Although Ratchford admitted the plans could be confusing, \r\n  the plan sheet showed the propertyâ€™s direct access to Highway 501 would be eliminated \r\n  and, after construction, access would be to the frontage road.Â  The plan sheet \r\n  provided to Brenco also was narrow in scope and did not show the plans related \r\n  to the nearby intersection of George Bishop Parkway and Highway 501, an original \r\n  alternate means of accessing Brencoâ€™s property from the highway.Â  According \r\n  to Ratchford, the plans indicated the grade of the road, and thus the propertyâ€™s \r\n  visibility from the highway, would remain unchanged.Â  \r\nThe appraisal valued the property taken at $34,700.Â  A diagram attached as \r\n  an exhibit to the appraisal showed only the property and the portion being taken \r\n  for the frontage road.Â  It did have an indication of the existing access point, \r\n  which originally led to Highway 501, but did not specifically show any proposed \r\n  change.Â  However, language in the appraisal information indicated access would \r\n  be to the frontage road.Â  Brenco accepted the appraisal and agreed to sell the \r\n  6,689 square feet for $34,700.Â  \r\nThe final project was completed pursuant to updated 2000 plans instead of the \r\n  1993 plans.Â  Rather than being left at grade, Highway 501 was elevated, rendering \r\n  Brencoâ€™s property less visible from the highway.Â  \r\nBrenco then brought this action to rescind the deed on the ground of negligent \r\n  misrepresentation or unilateral or mutual mistake.Â  Additionally, Brenco sought \r\n  damages for inverse condemnation.Â  \r\nAt trial, Brenco representatives maintained they knew nothing of their loss \r\n  of access directly onto Highway 501.Â  They asserted they were led to believe \r\n  they would retain access across the frontage road.Â  However, at least one representative \r\n  admitted no one asked about access to and from Highway 501 onto the property.Â  \r\n  Additionally, Brenco questioned whether SCDOT knew about the change in grade \r\n  or the possibility of such a change and failed to alert Brenco during the 1998 \r\n  negotiations.Â  \r\nRatchford indicated he never told Brenco representatives they would \r\n  retain access to Highway 501.Â  He maintained he showed them the portion of the \r\n  plan sheet covering their property, which showed the elimination of direct access \r\n  and provided access to their property only onto the frontage road.Â  In addition, \r\n  SCDOT offered testimony that although grade studies were being conducted, they \r\n  learned the project would require elevating the road only after concluding the \r\n  Brenco transaction.Â  \r\nBrenco offered testimony of two experts regarding the condition and \r\n  value of the property.Â  Engineer Steve Powell testified the highest and best \r\n  use for the property was dramatically and negatively impacted as a result of \r\n  the change in grade of the road and the elimination of direct access.Â  Appraiser \r\n  Jim Jayroe testified the property would no longer be usable for retail space, \r\n  but would instead be classified as light industrial.Â  He testified the negative \r\n  change in value of the property from before the original taking (the 1998 deed) \r\n  until after the completion of the project was approximately $1.5 million.Â  However, \r\n  when asked for a figure of the monetary damage between the 1993 plans and the \r\n  2000 plans, he responded:Â  â€œI donâ€™t know.â€Â  \r\nA second appraiser for SCDOT, Woodrow Willard, testified there was \r\n  no change in the propertyâ€™s value after Brenco deeded the frontage.Â  He testified \r\n  any change in grade of the roadâ€”the only change he found subsequent to the signing \r\n  of the deedâ€”was offset by improved access to the property through the use of \r\n  the frontage road.Â  \r\nIn its first order, the trial court refused to rescind the deed, \r\n  citing Brencoâ€™s failure to prove any of its alleged grounds.Â  As to mistake, \r\n  the court concluded although Brenco representatives may have had an incorrect \r\n  impression of what access the property would have to Highway 501 after the conveyance, \r\n  the documents they received from SCDOT established the property would no longer \r\n  enjoy direct access to the highway.Â  The court also found SCDOT was not then \r\n  aware the highwayâ€™s grade would change and thus there was no basis to rescind \r\n  the deed for negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nThe court did not dispose of the inverse condemnation action in its \r\n  first order.Â  Instead, the court sent a letter to counsel indicating it was \r\n  struggling with the issue of damages and requested a conference on the issue.Â  \r\n  At the conference, the court considered taking additional testimony regarding \r\n  damages, and counsel for both parties agreed the court could reopen the record \r\n  to receive additional testimony.Â  Brenco later moved to reopen the case to offer \r\n  additional evidence of damages. Â In a memorandum in support of the motion, \r\n  Brencoâ€™s counsel noted the trial court mentioned during the damages conference \r\n  that it wanted to hear specific testimony as to the changes between the August \r\n  18, 1993 plans and the 2000 implemented plans.Â  \r\nThe court later issued an order in which it concluded Brenco \r\n  failed to establish any damages necessary to prove an inverse condemnation as \r\n  a result of the deviation from the 1993 to the 2000 plans.Â  The court found \r\n  Brencoâ€™s evidence of monetary damages related solely to the inverse condemnation \r\n  deficient.Â  Consequently, the court found the only evidence on damages resulting \r\n  from the change in grade was from SCDOTâ€™s appraiser who opined that any damage \r\n  resulting therefrom was offset by improved access.Â  The court also declined \r\n  to reopen the case for additional testimony on the issue.Â  Brenco filed motions \r\n  for reconsideration of both of the courtâ€™s orders, which were denied after hearings.Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Deed Rescission\r\nBrenco argues the trial court erred in refusing to rescind the deed.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAn action to set aside a deed is a matter in equity.Â  See \r\n  Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 278, 363 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1987).Â  On \r\n  appeal in an equity action, we may find facts in accordance with our own view \r\n  of the evidence, but are not required to disregard the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  \r\n  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  Moreover, \r\n  our scope of review does not relieve the appellant of its burden to demonstrate \r\n  the courtâ€™s findings were in error.Â  Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d at 623.\r\nA.Â  Mistake\r\nWe find no basis for rescinding the deed on the ground of unilateral \r\n  or mutual mistake.\r\nTo rescind an instrument on the ground of mistake, the evidence must \r\n  be clear and convincing.Â  Truck South, Inc. v. Patel, 339 S.C. 40, 49, \r\n  528 S.E.2d 424, 429 (2000).Â  To rescind an instrument on the ground of unilateral \r\n  mistake, the mistake must be accompanied (1) by proof it was induced by fraud, \r\n  deceit, misrepresentation, concealment, or imposition of the opposing party \r\n  and without negligence on the part of the party seeking rescission, or (2) by \r\n  very strong and extraordinary circumstances which would make it a great wrong \r\n  to enforce the agreement.Â  Id.\r\nA contract may be rescinded on the ground of mutual mistake where \r\n  the parties have made a common mistake of fact causing each to do what neither \r\n  intended.Â  Young v. Cooler, 347 S.C. 362, 366, 555 S.E.2d 410, 412-13 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nAt trial, Brenco maintained two primary grounds for mistake:Â  (1) \r\n  the loss of direct access to Highway 501 from the property and (2) the change \r\n  in the grade of the road.Â  They asserted they were led to believe they would \r\n  retain access across the frontage road directly onto Highway 501.Â  However, \r\n  at least one representative admitted no one asked about access to and from Highway \r\n  501 onto the property.Â  The deed, which references the 1993 plans, specifies \r\n  the consideration paid to Brenco was for the â€œ6,689 square feet of land, and \r\n  all improvements thereon, if any, including rights of access as may be needed \r\n  for controlled access facilities.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  Although they argue \r\n  SCDOTâ€™s representative covertly put this language into the deed, they do not \r\n  deny they had an opportunity to review the deed.Â  Additionally, SCDOTâ€™s appraiser \r\n  testified he showed Brenco representatives the plan sheets, which detailed where \r\n  the property would access the frontage road and that its direct access to Highway \r\n  501 was being eliminated.Â  \r\nBrenco presented no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation by SCDOT \r\n  with regard to the access.Â  Their argument was that representatives were under \r\n  a different impression regarding the access.Â  â€œAn erroneous impression taken \r\n  up from the suggestion of the partyâ€™s own mind does not relieve him from the \r\n  contract.â€Â  Richardsonâ€™s Rests., Inc. v. Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, \r\n  304 S.C. 289, 297, 403 S.E.2d 669, 673 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Accordingly, there \r\n  is no ground for rescission based upon unilateral mistake.Â  \r\nBrenco also failed to establish any mutual mistake regarding the access the \r\n  property would have to Highway 501 under the 1993 plans.Â  As to direct access, \r\n  SCDOT offered significant proof it intended to allow access only to the frontage \r\n  road and not to Highway 501. [1] Â  \r\n  As to access by way of the intersection of Highway 501 and George Bishop Parkway, \r\n  Brenco asserts both its representatives and Ratchford, acting as a SCDOT representative, \r\n  mistakenly believed the intersection would be unchanged under the 1993 plans.Â  \r\n  They cite to a passage in Ratchfordâ€™s deposition in which Brencoâ€™s counsel asked \r\n  whether under the 1993 plans a westbound traveler on Highway 501 would have \r\n  been able to reach Brencoâ€™s property by turning right onto George Bishop Parkway \r\n  and then left onto the frontage road.Â  Although Ratchford answered in the affirmative, \r\n  no follow-up questions were asked to determine if the intersection would remain \r\n  unchanged.Â  At trial, Ratchford explained that under the 1993 plan the intersection \r\n  of Highway 501 with George Bishop Parkway was closed, but an exit ramp from \r\n  the highway terminated at George Bishop Parkway and the frontage road.Â  Thus, \r\n  his deposition testimony was correct as far as it went.Â  Two questions that \r\n  were neither asked nor answered were whether eastbound travelers would have \r\n  been able to exit directly from Highway 501 onto George Bishop Parkway, and \r\n  whether any traveler would have been able to exit Brencoâ€™s property directly \r\n  onto Highway 501 in either direction.Â  \r\nAs to the elevation, Brenco asserted SCDOT knew about the change in grade but \r\n  failed to alert them during the initial negotiations.Â  SCDOT offered testimony \r\n  that although grade studies were being conducted, it was not until after the \r\n  signing of the deed that they learned the project would require raising the \r\n  grade of the road.Â  All evidence in the record indicates that when the deed \r\n  was signed, both parties believed and intended the highway would remain at grade.Â  \r\n  Also, Brenco has failed to demonstrate how they were intentionally misled by \r\n  SCDOT.Â  That elevation studies were being conducted does not demonstrate SCDOT \r\n  knew the grade would be altered.Â  There is no evidence SCDOT intentionally withheld \r\n  knowledge the grade would be raised due to construction concerns.\r\nB.Â  Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nWe also find no basis for Brencoâ€™s allegation SCDOT negligently misrepresented \r\n  the propertyâ€™s loss of direct access to the highway or the highwayâ€™s grade change.Â  \r\n\r\nTo prove negligent misrepresentation, Brenco was required to show \r\n  SCDOT made a false representation to Brenco, had a pecuniary interest in making \r\n  the representation, owed Brenco a duty of care to communicate truthful information \r\n  to Brenco, and breached that duty of care.Â  Additionally, Brenco was required \r\n  to establish it justifiably relied on the representation and suffered a pecuniary \r\n  loss as a proximate result.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, \r\n  354 S.C. 397, 407, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).\r\nAs discussed above, all documentation provided to Brenco indicates \r\n  access would be restricted and would not be directly to Highway 501.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the record shows SCDOT did not intend to raise the grade of the road to its \r\n  resulting height when it purchased the property from Brenco.Â  Because Brenco \r\n  failed to prove SCDOT made any false representation regarding either the propertyâ€™s \r\n  access to Highway 501 or the grade of the highway, the trial court properly \r\n  refused to rescind the deed under a theory of negligent misrepresentation.\r\nII.Â  Inverse Condemnation\r\nBrenco argues \r\n  the trial court erred in bifurcating the case and refusing to reopen the record \r\n  to accept additional damages.Â  Alternatively, it argues the court erred in failing \r\n  to award damages for inverse condemnation.Â  Under the peculiar facts of this \r\n  case, we hold the court should have allowed additional evidence of damages to \r\n  the property caused by the changes made to the road project not reflected in \r\n  the deed from Brenco to SCDOT or the 1993 project plans. [2] \r\nThe decision whether to reopen a record for additional evidence is \r\n  within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Wright v. Strickland, 306 S.C. 187, \r\n  188, 410 S.E.2d 596, 597 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In Wright, this court affirmed \r\n  a trial courtâ€™s refusal to reopen a record where counsel for the party seeking \r\n  to reopen did not proffer any testimony or make any showing the evidence would \r\n  make any difference to the outcome of the case.Â  This court reasoned the trial \r\n  court properly declined the partyâ€™s attempt at a â€œfishing expedition.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, \r\n  Brenco submitted evidence the changes from the 1993 plans to the final completed \r\n  project caused substantial pecuniary damage to their property.Â  However, at \r\n  trial Brenco also alleged it was unaware that because of the conveyance of frontage \r\n  to SCDOT and the 1993 plans, the property would lose direct access to the highway \r\n  and that a nearby intersection providing alternate access to the highway would \r\n  be closed.Â  Because of these additional allegationsâ€”directed at setting aside \r\n  the deedâ€”Brencoâ€™s expert calculated damages based on the propertyâ€™s before and \r\n  after value.Â  \r\nThe trial court expressed concern about the issue of damages in the inverse \r\n  condemnation action in a letter announcing its ruling on the deed rescission \r\n  claim.Â  It was only after this letter and the resulting damages conference that \r\n  Brenco realized it needed to establish damages in a different fashion.Â  As a \r\n  result, counsel asked to reopen the case.Â  However, the court later announced \r\n  both its refusal to reopen the case and its ruling on inverse condemnation in \r\n  a single letter requesting SCDOT draft an appropriate order.Â  In the letter, \r\n  the court stated it was â€œtruly uncomfortableâ€ with its rulings and did not know \r\n  when a case had given the court â€œso much concern as this one.â€Â  Unlike the party \r\n  in Wright, Brenco attempted at the reconsideration hearing to proffer \r\n  evidence the trial court found it had failed to establish at trial.Â  Even at \r\n  this hearing, the trial court openly struggled with the issue of damages and \r\n  seriously considered allowing the testimony.Â  Under these peculiar circumstances, \r\n  where the evidence of what was contemplated at each stage of the road project \r\n  was so complex and the inverse condemnation calculations were contingent on \r\n  the outcome of another theory of the case, we believe the trial court abused \r\n  its discretion in not reopening the record for additional evidence of damages.Â  \r\n  Thus we remand the case to the trial court for additional testimony limited \r\n  to the damages, if any, caused by the changes in the project as envisioned by \r\n  the August 18 1993 plan and as referenced in the deed from Brenco to SCDOT, \r\n  and the final project as built.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, \r\n  REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Brenco contends the trial court erred in finding the parol evidence rule barred \r\n    its representativeâ€™s testimony regarding their belief surrounding the access \r\n    of the property to Highway 501.Â  We agree, but even considering the testimony, \r\n    we find Brenco failed to prove the deed should be rescinded due to unilateral \r\n    or mutual mistake.Â  See S. Realty &amp; Constr. Co. v. Bryan, \r\n    290 S.C. 302, 309, 350 S.E.2d 194, 198 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding parol evidence \r\n    is admissible to show mistake).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] In addition to increasing the grade of the highway, SCDOTâ€™s third exhibit \r\n    shows an exit ramp was moved from the 1993 plans to the 2000 plans.Â  Brenco \r\n    asserts this negatively affects the ability of westbound travelers to recognize \r\n    the property in time to take the appropriate exit.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3927","title":"Carolina Marine Handling v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3927\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2004 â€“ Filed January \r\n  24, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDavid J. Parrish and Stephen P. Groves, Sr., both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nM. Dawes Cooke, Jr. and John W. Fletcher, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  In this breach of contract action involving a non-sealed \r\n  instrument, the circuit court dismissed Appellantâ€™s counterclaim and third party \r\n  claim on the basis that the claims were barred by the general three-year statute \r\n  of limitations. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  Relying \r\n  solely on the generic contract provisionâ€”â€œIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have \r\n  hereunto set their hands and sealsâ€â€”Appellant seeks to invoke the twenty-year \r\n  statute of limitations applicable to â€œsealed instruments.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  15-3-520(b) (Supp. 2003).Â  We concur with the circuit court and find the parties \r\n  to the contract did not intend the contract to be under seal.Â  The circuit court, \r\n  therefore, properly applied the general three-year statute of limitations and \r\n  dismissed Appellantâ€™s claims.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nCarolina Shipbuilders, Inc. (CSI) leased property on the former Charleston \r\n  Naval Base Shipyard in December 1996 from the Charleston Naval Complex Redevelopment \r\n  Authority (RDA).Â  CSI later subleased the property to Carolina Marine Handling, \r\n  Inc. (CMH).Â  Among other things, the lease contract required CMH to make monthly \r\n  rent payments to CSI.Â  \r\nRDA terminated its lease with CSI in May 1999, alleging CMH failed to make \r\n  all required rent payments.Â  CMH brought the present action against CSI and \r\n  others in May 2002.Â  In November 2002, CSI answered and counterclaimed against \r\n  CMH, alleging CMH breached its contract by failing to pay rent to RDA, resulting \r\n  in RDAâ€™s termination of its lease with CSI.Â  CSI also filed a third party complaint \r\n  against Herbert R. Stedner, CMHâ€™s sole owner.Â  \r\nCMH and Stedner sought dismissal based on the general three-year \r\n  statute of limitations.Â  CSI countered with the argument that the lease contract \r\n  was made under seal and was subject to the twenty-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  The circuit court found the contract was subject to the three-year statute of \r\n  limitations and dismissed CSIâ€™s claims.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nThe lease provides \r\n  in part: â€œIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto set their hands and \r\n  seals this ____ day of December, 1996.â€Â  The date of the contractâ€™s execution \r\n  was written in the appropriate blank space, and the parties signed the contract. \r\n  Â In essence, CSI asserts this language, standing alone, evidences the partiesâ€™ \r\n  intent to seal the contract as provided by South Carolina Code section 15-3-520(b) \r\n  of the South Carolina Code. [1] Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, a \r\n  three-year statute of limitations applies to contract actions in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  Section 15-3-520 provides a twenty-year \r\n  statute of limitations for certain actions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-520 (Supp. \r\n  2003). It is the â€œsealed instrumentâ€ provision of section 15-3-520(b) on which \r\n  CSI rests its hopes to avoid application of the standard statute of limitations. \r\n  Section 19-1-160 provides:\r\n\r\nWhenever it shall appear from the attestation clause or from \r\n  any other part of any instrument in writing that it was the intention of the \r\n  party or parties thereto that such instrument should be a sealed instrument \r\n  then such instrument shall be construed to be, and shall have the effect of, \r\n  a sealed instrument although no seal be actually attached thereto.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-160 \r\n  (1976).\r\nThe clear language of \r\n  section 19-1-160 imposes a statutory rule of evidence and requires that the \r\n  determinationâ€”of whether a non-sealed instrument should be considered a sealed \r\n  instrumentâ€”be gleaned from the instrument.Â  If it appears from a non-sealed \r\n  instrument that the parties intended for the contract to be sealed, it will \r\n  be deemed sealed.Â  We recognize that a non-sealed instrument may include provisions \r\n  and indicia that evidence an intent that the contract â€œbe construed [as] a sealed \r\n  instrument.â€Â  Id.Â  Two decisions of this court have found the requisite \r\n  intent where no seal was placed on the contract.\r\nIn Treadway v. Smith, 325 S.C. 367, 479 S.E.2d 849 (Ct. App. 1996), \r\n  we considered whether a non-sealed separation agreement entered into by former \r\n  spouses was intended to be a sealed instrument, and thus subject to the twenty-year \r\n  statute of limitations. [2] Â  The agreement included future, contingent \r\n  obligations, especially as related to Smithâ€™s responsibility for a portion of \r\n  the partiesâ€™ childrenâ€™s educational expenses.Â  The agreement further contained \r\n  the standard attestation clauseâ€”â€œIn WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto \r\n  set their respective Hands and Sealsâ€â€”found in many contracts.Â  Id. at \r\n  378, 479 S.E.2d at 855.Â  Immediately following this standard language in conspicuous \r\n  type, was:Â  \r\n\r\nSIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED \r\n  IN THE PRESENCE OF\r\n[signatures of parties and witnesses]\r\n\r\nId.Â  We concluded that the language manifested the partiesâ€™ intent to \r\n  create a sealed instrument. \r\nWe similarly construed a non-sealed instrument in South \r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services v. Winyah Nursing Homes, Inc., 282 \r\n  S.C. 556, 320 S.E.2d 464 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Following the standard languageâ€”â€œthe \r\n  parties hereto have set their hands and sealsâ€â€”the contract noted â€œL.S.â€ adjacent \r\n  to the contracting partiesâ€™ signatures.Â  Id. at 561, 320 S.E.2d at 467.Â  \r\n  The inclusion of L.S. was a significant feature in Winyah Nursing Homes, \r\n  for L.S. is an abbreviation for Locus sigilli, which means â€œthe \r\n  place of the seal; the place occupied by the seal of written instruments.â€Â  \r\n  L.S. usually appears on documents in place of, and serves the same purpose as, \r\n  a seal.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, 948 (6th ed. 1990); see \r\n  68 Am. Jur. 2d Seals Â§ 6 (2004) (Use of the notation â€œL.S.â€ is generally \r\n  held as applicable to replace a physical seal on a document).Â Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we found the parties intended the contract in Winyah Nursing Homes to \r\n  be a sealed instrument. [3] \r\nIn the case before us, we find the parties did not intend to create \r\n  a sealed instrument.Â  The sophisticated parties to this lease arrangement could \r\n  have easily manifested an intent to create a sealed instrument if they were \r\n  so inclined.Â  We recognize that CSI, by necessity of the posture of the case, \r\n  must advance the argument that the standard attestationâ€”â€œIN WITNESS WHEREOF, \r\n  the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals,â€ \r\n  [4]  compels a finding that the parties intended to create a sealed instrument.Â  \r\n  We further recognize, however, that such generic language is common in non-sealed \r\n  contracts of all types.Â  Were we to construe this boilerplate attestation clause, \r\n  by itself, as requiring a finding of intent to create a sealed instrument \r\n  in an otherwise non-sealed instrument, we would likely transform the twenty-year \r\n  statute of limitations into the standard period of limitations for contract \r\n  actions in this state.Â  We adhere to our general three-year statute of limitations \r\n  for most contract actions and acknowledge the availability of the twenty-year \r\n  limitations period where the contract clearly evidences an intent to create \r\n  a sealed instrument. [5] \r\nâ€œStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \r\n  they stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote repose by giving security \r\n  and stability to human affairs.â€Â  Moates v. Bobb, 322 S.C. 172, 176, \r\n  470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The cornerstone policy consideration underlying \r\n  statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality \r\n  in litigation.Â  See Webb v. Greenwood County, 229 S.C. 267, 276, \r\n  92 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1956); City of Myrtle Beach v. Lewis-Davis, 360 S.C. \r\n  225, 231, 599 S.E.2d 462, 464 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â  Significantly, â€œ[s]tatutes \r\n  of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set \r\n  period of time, they will not be hailed [sic] into court to defend time-barred \r\n  claims.â€Â  In re Elkay Indus., Inc., 167 B.R. 404, 408 (D.S.C. 1994).Â  \r\n  â€œMoreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  at 408-09.Â  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to \r\n  our judicial system. \r\nThe result we reach today, we believe, harmonizes the intent of the Legislature \r\n  with respect to the general three-year statute of limitations in section 15-3-530 \r\n  with the ability of contracting parties to create sealed instruments pursuant \r\n  to section 19-1-160 and thereby invoke the twenty-year limitations period in \r\n  section 15-3-520(b). \r\nII.\r\nÂ CSI alternatively argues \r\n  that its claim against Stender remains viable notwithstanding the three-year \r\n  limitations period.Â  We affirm the dismissal of CSIâ€™s third party complaint \r\n  against Stender pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  \r\n  Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 376-77, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998) (â€œThe discovery rule determines the date of accrual for a breach \r\n  of contract action[,]â€ and â€œ[p]ursuant to the discovery rule, a breach of contract \r\n  action accrues not on the date of the breach, but rather on the date the aggrieved \r\n  party either discovered the breach, or could or should have discovered the breach \r\n  through the exercise of reasonable diligenceâ€);Â  Rumpf v. Mass. Mut. Life \r\n  Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 394-95, 593 S.E.2d 183, 187 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting \r\n  that the â€œexercise of reasonable diligenceâ€ means â€œthat the injured party must \r\n  act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury place \r\n  a reasonable person of common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim \r\n  against another party might existâ€); Republic Contracting Corp. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Trans., 332 S.C. 197, 208, 503 S.E.2d \r\n  761, 767 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œThe statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff \r\n  knows or should know of a potential claim against another party, not when the \r\n  plaintiff develops a full-blown theory of recovery.â€). [6] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the \r\n  presence of a standard attestation clauseâ€”such as, â€œIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the \r\n  parties have hereunto set their hands and sealsâ€â€”in an instrument which is neither \r\n  sealed nor required to be sealed is insufficient, standing alone, to create \r\n  a sealed instrument under section 19-1-160.Â  We, therefore, find the parties \r\n  to the December 1996, non-sealed contract did not intend to create a sealed \r\n  instrument.Â  Consequently, we find the claims of CSI barred by the general three-year \r\n  statute of limitations under section 15-3-530.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s dismissal \r\n  of CSIâ€™s claims against CMH and Stender is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, and BEATTY, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  CSI makes no argument that its counterclaim is timely under \r\n    the three-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The separation agreement in Treadway \r\n    retained its separate contractual character because it was executed prior \r\n    to our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Mosley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, \r\n    306 S.E.2d 624 (1983).Â  In Mosley, the court held that jurisdiction \r\n    for all subsequent domestic matters, whether by decree or agreement, vested \r\n    in the family court.Â  Id. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Mosley \r\n    further recognized that previously executed separation agreements which were \r\n    incorporated, but not merged, into a divorce decree retained their separate \r\n    contractual character.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Our supreme court addressed a similar issue \r\n    in Cook v. Cooper, 59 S.C. 560, 38 S.E. 218 (1901), although for purposes \r\n    unrelated to the applicable statute of limitations.Â  In Cook, the validity \r\n    of a deed was at stake, and appellants argued the â€œdeed is void for the reason \r\n    that it is not under seal.â€Â  Id.Â  at 560, 38 S.E.2d at 219.Â  While \r\n    the deed lacked a seal â€œupon its face,â€ the following three features were \r\n    present: (1) the deed provided an attestation, â€œIn witness whereof I hereunto \r\n    sed [sic] my hand and seal thisâ€¦;â€ (2) immediately adjacent to the grantorâ€™s \r\n    signature was the word â€œseal;â€ and (3) the deed concluded with â€œSigned, Sealed \r\n    and Delivered in the presents [sic] of [names of witnesses].â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n    The supreme court relied in part on the predecessor to section 19-1-160 and \r\n    found that a sealed instrument had been intended.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The parties did not â€œsetâ€ their â€œsealsâ€ \r\n    on the contract, and the contract does not otherwise evidence an intent to \r\n    create a sealed instrument.Â  Similarly, the parties executed a hold harmless \r\n    agreement which contained the following attestation clause:Â  â€œWITNESS the \r\n    following signatures and seals.â€Â  Only signatures followed, and again, the \r\n    related hold harmless agreement contains no evidence the parties intended \r\n    to create a sealed instrument.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  We have previously rejected other efforts \r\n    to escape the barring effect of the standard three-year statute of limitations \r\n    for contact actions.Â  For example, in Republic Contracting Corp. v.

Andrew Williams and Curtis L. Ott, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAlbert A. Lachour, III, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  In this civil action, Senergy, Inc., appeals a circuit \r\n  court order holding it liable to Cowden Enterprises, Inc., on a claim for contribution.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCowden Enterprises acted as general contractor on a home constructed for John \r\n  and Dawn Thomas in 1994.Â  In February 2000, the Thomases brought suit against \r\n  Cowden, alleging the home developed moisture intrusion problems as a result \r\n  of several flaws in the homeâ€™s exterior, including defective exterior cladding.Â  \r\n  The faulty cladding used on the home was manufactured by Senergy, Inc., and \r\n  marketed as â€œEIFSâ€ (Exterior Insulation and Finish System).Â  Cowden promptly \r\n  settled the Thomasesâ€™ entire claim relating to the residence for $81,328 and \r\n  brought subsequent contribution claims against all other manufacturers, suppliers \r\n  and subcontractors involved in the construction of the homeâ€™s exterior, including \r\n  Senergy.Â  Cowden resolved its claims against all joint tortfeasors except Senergy, \r\n  which asserted as its defense a class action settlement that allegedly resolved \r\n  all claims relating to EIFS defects.Â  \r\nIn 1998, Senergy entered into a national class action settlement entitled Ruff, \r\n  et al. v. Parex, et al., 96 CVS 0059 (N.C. Supp. Ct. Div. 1998).Â  The Ruff \r\n  Settlement Agreement, approved for fairness by the North Carolina Superior Court \r\n  after prolonged litigation and negotiation, set forth the following definition \r\n  of the settlement class:\r\n\r\nSettlement Class means \r\n  a class composed of all Persons who, as of the Notice Date, have owned or own \r\n  Property in the United States clad, in whole or in part with the Settling Defendantsâ€™ \r\n  EIFS.Â  \r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases \r\n  noted, in approving the national settlement class and notice plan, that he was \r\n  â€œparticularly attuned to the fact that this was a nationwide settlement and \r\n  made a special effort to see that the Notice Plan targeted homeowners in those \r\n  parts of the country in which [Synergy] sold [its] products.â€Â  Written notice \r\n  was mailed to all ascertainable settlement class members, and all were given \r\n  the option to â€œopt outâ€ of the class by August 1998. \r\nIt is undisputed that the Thomases were the owners of the residence \r\n  on the settlementâ€™s notice date, but they neither made a claim for compensation \r\n  prior to the agreementâ€™s four-year cut off date, nor opted out of the settlement \r\n  class.Â  Accordingly, Senergy made no payments under the Ruff agreement \r\n  for damage to the Thomas residence.Â  Senergy nevertheless asserted at trial \r\n  that the settlement agreement, and its accompanying release by the entire settlement \r\n  class, barred Cowdenâ€™s contribution claim.Â  The parties stipulated that if Senergy \r\n  is not protected by the Ruff settlement agreement, the sum due to Cowden \r\n  as Senergyâ€™s pro-rata share of the damages is $17,500.Â  Â \r\nThe circuit court held Senergy was not protected by the Ruff \r\n  settlement agreement and awarded Cowden $17,500 under its claim for contribution.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court \r\n  is free to review whether the trial court properly applied the law to those \r\n  facts.Â  WDW Prop. v. City of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, \r\n  632 (2000).Â  In such cases, the appellate court is not required to defer to \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s legal conclusions.Â  Scott v. Brunson, 351 S.C. 313, \r\n  316, 569 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSenergy argues the circuit court erred in finding it was not protected \r\n  from contribution claims arising from alleged EIFS defects by the Ruff \r\n  settlement agreement. Â We agree.\r\nSince no right to contribution among joint tortfeasors existed in South Carolina \r\n  common law, Cowdenâ€™s claim arises solely under the South Carolina Contribution \r\n  Among Tortfeasors Act (â€œthe Actâ€), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-38-10 to -70 (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  See M&amp;T Chemicals, Inc. v. Barker Indus., Inc., 296 \r\n  S.C. 103, 106, 370 S.E.2d 886, 888 (Ct. App. 1988) (reluctantly finding no common \r\n  law right to contribution in South Carolina prior to the Actâ€™s 1988 enactment).Â  \r\n  â€œBecause the Act is in derogation of the common law, it must be strictly construed.â€ \r\n  G &amp; P Trucking v. Parks Auto Sales Serv. &amp; Salvage, Inc., 357 \r\n  S.C. 82, 87, 591 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Cowdenâ€™s only claim against \r\n  Senergy is for contribution and, accordingly, may only succeed if it meets the \r\n  strictly construed requirements set forth in the Act.\r\nAccording to the Act, where two or more persons become jointly or \r\n  severally liable in tort for the same injury to property, a right of contribution \r\n  arises among them, even if judgment has not been recovered against all or any \r\n  of them.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(A) (Supp. 2003); Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 68, 518 S.E.2d 301, 309 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  In these situations, the right of contribution exists only in favor \r\n  of a tortfeasor who, like Cowden, has paid more than his pro rata share of the \r\n  common liability.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(B) (Supp. 2003); Vermeer, \r\n  336 S.C. at 68, 518 S.E.2d at 309.Â  This right to contribution, however, is \r\n  subject to certain limitations set forth in the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2003). \r\nOne such limitation is laid out in section 15-38-50, which reads, \r\n  â€œ[w]hen a release . . . is given in good faith to one of two or more persons \r\n  liable in tort for the same injury . . . (2) it discharges the tortfeasor to \r\n  whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-50 (Supp. 2003).Â  The plain language of this limitation \r\n  on contribution yields only one interpretation, namely that once a joint tortfeasor \r\n  obtains a release from a plaintiff, he is no longer liable for contribution \r\n  claims arising from injuries subject to that release. [1] Â  See South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank v. \r\n  Stone, 749 F. Supp. 1419, 1430 (D.S.C. 1990) (â€œ[A] Settling Defendant is \r\n  insulated from later contribution claims by co-tortfeasors if he obtains a good \r\n  faith release . . . from the Plaintiff.â€); see also Restatement \r\n  Third, Torts: Apportionment of Liability, Â§ 23(a) (2000) (â€œ[When one joint tortfeasor \r\n  discharges the liability of another], the person discharging the liability is \r\n  entitled to recover contribution from the other, unless the other previously \r\n  had a valid settlement and release from the plaintiff.â€ (emphasis added)).Â  \r\n\r\nAs previously noted, the Thomases were the owners of record on the \r\n  notice date for the national class action settlement and did not opt out of \r\n  the settlement class.Â  In its order approving the Ruff agreement, the \r\n  North Carolina Court stated the following:\r\n\r\nâ€œAll persons falling within the definition of the Settlement Class who did not \r\n  timely and validly request exclusion . . . are Settlement Class Members and \r\n  are bound by Settlement Agreement, the settlement and releases contained \r\n  therein, and the Final Order and Judgment, and do not have any further opportunity \r\n  to opt out of the settlement class.â€\r\n\r\nRuff, et al. v. Parex, et al., 96 CVS 0059 (N.C. Supp. Ct. Div. 1998).Â  \r\n  The Ruff agreement states, under the heading Releases and Assignments, \r\n  â€œeach settlement class member . . . does hereby release and forever discharge \r\n  [Senergy] . . . from any and all Settled Claims . . . [e]ach Releasing Party, \r\n  upon entry of the Final Order and Judgment . . . shall be deemed to and hereby \r\n  does release and discharge [Senergy] of and from any and all Settled Claims.â€Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the court specifically found â€œthe parties have reached accord with \r\n  respect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class \r\n  Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims . . . .â€ \r\n  Id. (emphasis added).Â  Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the \r\n  United States Constitution, we may not disregard the judicial proceedings of \r\n  the North Carolina Court, even as they relate to a national class action lawsuit.Â  \r\n  U.S. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 1; See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Epstein, \r\n  516 U.S. 367, 374 (1996) (â€œ[A] judgment entered in a class action, like any \r\n  other judgment entered in a state judicial proceeding, is presumptively entitled \r\n  to full faith and credit.â€); Hospitality Management Assoc., Inc. v. Shell \r\n  Oil Co., 356 S.C. 644, 591 S.E.2d 611 (2004) (granting full faith and credit \r\n  to two nationwide class action settlements from other state courts as they apply \r\n  to local members of the national settling classes).Â  We therefore conclude the \r\n  Thomases, as settlement class members, were bound by the terms of the national \r\n  class action settlement granting Senergy a release from liability.\r\nCowden puts much stake in the fact that builders and contractors \r\n  were expressly excluded as members of the settlement class by the terms of the \r\n  Ruff settlement agreement.Â  We are not swayed by its arguments based \r\n  on this exclusion.Â  The fact that Cowden and other contractors were excluded \r\n  from filing claims under the settlement in no way alters the unambiguous release \r\n  granted to Senergy by the terms of the Ruff settlement.Â  Cowdenâ€™s claim \r\n  arises under a statutory contribution scheme which this court is bound to strictly \r\n  follow.Â  While we recognize the unfortunate outcome the Act demands in this \r\n  case, we nevertheless conclude Senergy received a good faith release from the \r\n  Thomases under the Ruff settlement prior to Cowdenâ€™s payment of the entire \r\n  claim. Senergy, therefore, is insulated from Cowdenâ€™s contribution claim under \r\n  Section 15-38-50(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Cowden asserts on appeal that subsection (1) of \r\n    section 15-38-50 requires an actual monetary payment to the plaintiff by the \r\n    party asserting a release in order for that release to insulate them from \r\n    contribution claims.Â  As subsection (1) refers only to liability of other \r\n    joint tortfeasors following a valid release by one jointly liable party, we \r\n    do not adopt Cowdenâ€™s interpretation.Â Â  Although subsection (1) does outline \r\n    a setoff Cowden was possibly entitled to assert against the Thomases, it does \r\n    not speak to the contribution liability of Senergy, the party asserting the \r\n    defense of a good faith release. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-50(1) (Supp. \r\n    2003) (â€œ[When a release is given to a joint tortfeasor,] it does not discharge \r\n    any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury . . . but it reduces \r\n    the claim against the others to the extent of any amount stipulated by the \r\n    release . . . or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever \r\n    is the greater.â€). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3929","title":"Coakley v.

Tyner, both of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Respondent filed this declaratory judgment action to determine \r\n  the applicability of certain automobile liability policies issued by Horace \r\n  Mann Insurance Company (Horace Mann).Â  The circuit court found coverage under \r\n  all three policies.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 19, 1994, sixteen-year-old Christian Coakley was \r\n  a passenger in a car being driven by seventeen-year-old Scott Andrew Mitchell.Â  \r\n  As they were traveling towards a friendâ€™s house, Scott lost control and the \r\n  car slammed into a tree.Â  The force of the impact shattered a vertebra in Christianâ€™s \r\n  neck, partially severing his spinal cord.Â  As a result of these injuries, Christian \r\n  is a permanent quadriplegic.Â  \r\nThe automobile, a 1984 Mazda RX-7, belonged to Scottâ€™s older \r\n  brother Christopher Mitchell and was titled in Christopherâ€™s name.Â  Christopher, \r\n  a student at Clemson University, resided in an apartment in Clemson, normally \r\n  kept the car with him, and was its primary user.  [1] Â  Prior to the accident, Christopher went on \r\n  a trip to California and left the car at his motherâ€™s house.Â  Christopher was \r\n  on the way back from California when the accident occurred.Â  Scott was a high \r\n  school student and lived with his mother in Spartanburg, South Carolina. [2] Â  Claudia â€œDee Deeâ€ Mitchell, Scott and Christopherâ€™s \r\n  mother, testified in her deposition that Scott had permission to use the car.Â  \r\n\r\nThe car was insured through Horace Mann, with Dee Dee being \r\n  the named insured.Â  The policy provided liability limits of $50,000.00 for personal \r\n  injury.Â  Dee Dee also maintained policies on three other vehicles.Â  Two of these \r\n  policies carry liability limits of $50,000.00, and the third has a liability \r\n  limit of $250,000.00.Â  None of these other policies provided primary coverage \r\n  for the vehicle involved in the accident.Â Â Â  \r\nThe special needs trust (the Trust) created on behalf of \r\n  Christian commenced this action seeking compensation for Christianâ€™s injuries. [3] Â  The Trust sought recovery under \r\n  the policy covering the RX-7, as well as excess coverage under the policies \r\n  on the other three cars.Â  Horace Mann initially denied liability, but following \r\n  discovery, the parties entered into a covenant not to execute.Â  Pursuant to \r\n  the covenant, Horace Mann paid out the liability limits on the policy covering \r\n  the RX-7.Â  The covenant also allowed the Trust to bring a declaratory judgment \r\n  action to determine the applicability of the three additional policies.Â  In \r\n  exchange for permission to bring the action, the Trust agreed that recovery, \r\n  if any, would be limited to $350,000.00â€”the combined total of the three policies.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Trust then filed this declaratory judgment action alleging \r\n  that although the other policies do not provide primary coverage on the RX-7, \r\n  they provide excess coverage for â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicles.Â  The Trust argued the \r\n  RX-7 was a non-owned vehicle because Christopher owned the car and was not a \r\n  relative within the meaning of the policies.Â  \r\nThe parties agreed to transfer the litigation to a non-jury \r\n  docket and the case was submitted upon memoranda of authority, copies of the \r\n  policies in dispute, and the deposition testimony of the Mitchell defendants.Â  \r\n  On March 5, 2003, the trial court issued its order, in which it found excess \r\n  liability coverage was available to Christian under all three policies.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  judgment was entered in the amount of $350,000.00.Â  Horace Mann, Scott, Christopher, \r\n  and Dee Dee (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) have appealed from that Order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA declaratory judgment action to determine coverage under an automobile \r\n  liability policy is an action at law.Â  Travelers Indem.

City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, \r\n  86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  Since Appellants have admitted that no facts \r\n  are in dispute in this case, this court can review conclusions of law based \r\n  on those facts.Â  Midland Guardian Co. v. Thacker, 280 S.C. 563, 568, \r\n  314 S.E.2d 26, 29 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. The Insurance Policy\r\nâ€œInsurance policies are subject to general rules of contract construction.â€Â  \r\n  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 234, 530 S.E.2d \r\n  896, 897 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations omitted).Â  Accordingly, courts â€œshould give \r\n  policy language its plain, ordinary and popular meaning.â€Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  courts should not rewrite policy language or torture its meaning to extend coverage \r\n  never intended by the parties.Â  Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., \r\n  264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1975).Â  When an insurance contract is \r\n  unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms \r\n  the parties have used.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., \r\n  348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002).Â  However, â€œ[a]mbiguous or conflicting \r\n  terms in an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the insured \r\n  and strictly against the insurer.â€Â  Stewart v.

App. 2000).\r\nIn the instant case, all four Horace Mann policies issued to Dee Dee Mitchell \r\n  contain identical policy language.Â  The policies extend liability coverage to \r\n  payment of damages which an insured becomes legally liable to pay because of \r\n  bodily injury to others caused by or resulting from the ownership, maintenance \r\n  or use of the covered vehicle.Â  Scott is an â€œinsuredâ€ under the policy because \r\n  he is a relative of Dee Dee.Â  \r\nThe policies also extend \r\n  liability coverage to the use of other cars by an insured.Â  The pertinent language \r\n  provides as follows:Â  â€œBodily Injury and Property Damage Liability coverages \r\n  extend to the use, by an insured, of . . .Â  a non-owned car while being used \r\n  with the permission of the owner.â€Â  (emphasis omitted).Â  The policies further \r\n  provide that if there is other coverage, the applicable policy will be excess:Â  \r\n  â€œIf an insured is using a . . .Â  non-owned car, our liability insurance will \r\n  be excess over other collectible insurance.â€Â  (emphasis omitted). \r\nThe definition of â€œnon-owned carâ€ has been replaced by an amendatory endorsement.Â  \r\n  As amended, the definition provides as follows:\r\nNon-owned car means a private passenger car . . . not:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  owned by;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  registered in the name of; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;furnished or available for the regular use of you or your relatives.Â  The use \r\n  must be within the scope of consent of the owner or person in lawful possession \r\n  of it.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe policies define â€œrelativeâ€ as follows:Â  â€œRelative means a person related \r\n  to you by blood, marriage or adoption who lives with you.Â  It includes your \r\n  unmarried and dependent child who is away at school.â€Â  (emphasis omitted). \r\nHorace Mann has conceded liability on the liability policy covering the RX-7 \r\n  and tendered the limits on that policy.Â  The other three policies do not cover \r\n  the RX-7, but they do cover non-owned vehicles.Â  These policies specifically \r\n  provide that if there is other coverage on a non-owned vehicle, they provide \r\n  excess coverage.Â  The heart of the issue is whether the RX-7 was a non-owned \r\n  vehicle, and that question turns on whether Christopher owned the car or was \r\n  a relative within the meaning of the policy.\r\nII. Ownership of the Car\r\nAppellants first argue the RX-7 could not have been a non-owned car because \r\n  Dee Dee Mitchell, not Christopher, was the owner of the vehicle.Â  The trial \r\n  court found Christopher owned the car and this finding will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal unless no reasonable evidence supports the courtâ€™s conclusions.Â  Townes, \r\n  266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.Â  We note that Scott, Dee Dee, and Christopher \r\n  admitted in their Answer that Christopher owned the RX-7.Â  The Covenant Not \r\n  to Execute also states that Christopher is the owner.Â  Appellants assert in \r\n  their brief that the facts in this case are not in dispute and Dee Dee testified \r\n  that the car is titled in Christopherâ€™s name.Â  Therefore, we find sufficient \r\n  evidence in the record to sustain the trial courtâ€™s finding that Christopher \r\n  owned the car, not Dee Dee Mitchell.\r\nIII. Status of Christopher in Relation \r\n  to Dee Dee Mitchell\r\nSince the RX-7 was not â€œowned byâ€ or â€œregistered in the name ofâ€ Dee Dee Mitchell, \r\n  the named insured, the car could only be a non-owned vehicle if it was not â€œfurnished \r\n  or available for the regular use ofâ€ Dee Dee Mitchell or her â€œrelatives.â€Â  It \r\n  is undisputed that the RX-7 was not available for the regular use of Scott at \r\n  the time of the accident.Â  Additionally, the trial court found, and Appellants \r\n  have not disputed, that the car was not available for the regular use of Dee \r\n  Dee at the time of the accident.Â  Therefore, the car qualifies as a non-owned \r\n  vehicle unless Christopher was a relative of Dee Dee under the policies.\r\nThe determination of resident relative status is a question of fact.Â  Auto \r\n  Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 581, 500 S.E.2d 496, 497 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).Â  The trial court found that Christopher did not reside with Dee \r\n  Dee, nor was he dependent on her at the time of the accident.Â  This finding \r\n  must be affirmed unless no evidence reasonably supports it.Â  Townes, \r\n  266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nChristopher qualifies as a relative under the policy if he is (1) â€œrelated \r\n  toâ€ her and (2) â€œlives withâ€ her.Â  The first prong of the test is easily satisfied.Â  \r\n  Christopher is Dee Deeâ€™s son.Â  Therefore, he is related to her by blood.Â  The \r\n  second prong, whether Christopher â€œlives withâ€ Dee Dee, contains an additional \r\n  qualification.Â  He is deemed to live with her if he is her â€œunmarried and dependent \r\n  child who is away at school.â€Â  Christopher was not married and was â€œaway at \r\n  school.â€Â  At issue, then, is whether Christopher was a â€œdependent childâ€ of \r\n  Dee Dee at the time the accident occurred.Â  \r\nAlthough there is evidence in the record which would support an inference that \r\n  Christopher was dependent on his mother, there is also evidence to support the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding that â€œif [Christopher] were dependent on either of his \r\n  parents, it was the father to whom he was dependent.â€ [4] Â  For instance, although Dee Dee testified in her deposition \r\n  that she provided some financial support to Christopher, such as money for groceries, \r\n  gas, and insurance, she also admitted that Christopherâ€™s father paid the majority \r\n  of his tuition.Â  Christopher explained that his father provided him with a lump \r\n  sum payment of $3500.00 every semester for tuition and living expenses.Â  \r\nSome of the testimony in this regard was conflicting.Â  Dee Dee testified that \r\n  she and Christopherâ€™s father paid for Christopherâ€™s rent while he was living \r\n  in an apartment in Clemson.Â  Christopher, however, testified he did not receive \r\n  income, help with tuition, or rent money from Dee Dee.Â  Christopher stated that \r\n  his father paid for these expenses.Â  Similarly, although Dee Dee testified she \r\n  paid for gasoline and repairs on Christopherâ€™s car, Christopher testified that \r\n  he paid these expenses.Â  When conflicting testimony is presented, the trial \r\n  court is in a better position to determine credibility.Â  See Epperly \r\n  v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885-886 (1994).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find there is evidence which supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Christopher \r\n  was not a dependent of Dee Dee. [5] \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s ruling that Christopher did not â€œlive withâ€ Dee Dee is supported \r\n  by our case law.Â  The residency test in South Carolina is found in Buddin \r\n  v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633 (1967).Â  In \r\n  Buddin, the supreme court noted that a â€œresident of the same household \r\n  is one, other than a temporary or transient visitor, who lives together with \r\n  others in the same house for a period of some duration, although he may not \r\n  intend to remain there permanently.â€Â  Id. at 339, 157 S.E.2d at 636 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  Because Christopher did not live in the same household as Dee Dee, \r\n  he would not qualify as a resident relative under this test.Â  Several cases \r\n  have elaborated on the Buddin test, but none of them would have found \r\n  Christopher to reside with Dee Dee. \r\n  [6] Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding that he was not her \r\n  dependent, and he did not live with her for purposes of the policies.\r\nBecause there is evidence in the record to support its conclusion, we agree \r\n  with the trial court that the RX-7 was a â€œnon-owned carâ€ within the meaning \r\n  of the policies.Â  It is undisputed that upon such a finding, the other three \r\n  policies become applicable as excess coverage.Â  Thus, the only remaining issue \r\n  is the amount of coverage.Â  \r\nIV. Amount of Coverage\r\nThe trial court found that all three policies applied and could be stacked.Â  \r\n  The general rule is that stacking of liability coverage is permitted unless \r\n  limited by statute or by a valid policy provision.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Moorer, 330 S.C. 46, 60, 496 S.E.2d 875, 883 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n  A policy provision that purports to limit stacking of statutorily required coverage \r\n  is invalid.Â  Id.Â  Although liability coverage is required, non-owned \r\n  vehicle coverage is not and, therefore, may be limited by contract.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the question is whether the policy language effectively prohibited \r\n  stacking.\r\nThe trial court based its ruling on a plain reading of the policy provisions \r\n  located in the amendatory endorsements under the heading â€œIf There is Other \r\n  Coverageâ€ reproduced below:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Policies Issued by Us to You\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        If two or more vehicle liability policies issued by us \r\n  to you apply to the same accident, the total limits of liability \r\n  under all such policies shall not exceed that of the policy with the highest \r\n  limit of liability.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.\r\n         \r\n  Other Liability Coverage Available From Other Sources\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Subject to item 1, if other vehicle liability coverage applies, \r\n  we are liable only for our share of the damages.Â  \r\n  Our share is the percent that the limit of liability of this policy \r\n  bears to the total of all vehicle liability coverage applicable to the accident.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n        Temporary Substitute Car, Non-Owned Car, Trailer \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        If a temporary substitute car, a non-owned car or \r\n  a trailer designed for use with a private passenger car \r\n  or utility vehicle has other vehicle liability coverage on it, \r\n  then this coverage is excess.Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  \r\nSpecifically, the trial court found these provisions clearly and unambiguously \r\n  provided excess coverage for non-owned vehicles.Â  In so ruling, the trial court \r\n  read paragraph three as being independent of the limitation contained in paragraph \r\n  one.Â  The court reasoned that if the drafters of the policy intended the limitations \r\n  of paragraph one to apply to paragraph three, they would have expressly included \r\n  the limitation, or some reference to it, in paragraph three.Â  Alternatively, \r\n  the trial court held that if it was possible to read paragraph one as qualifying \r\n  paragraph three, then it was just as reasonable to read paragraph three as qualifying \r\n  paragraph one.Â  Thus, the court reasoned that when an insurance policy is ambiguous \r\n  it must be construed in a light most favorable to the insured.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial court held that the policies provided liability coverage for Scott \r\n  in the amount of $350,000.Â  \r\nAppellants, on the other hand, argue that the limitation of paragraph one qualifies \r\n  the non-owned coverage provided by paragraph three.Â  According to the Appellants, \r\n  even if the trial court found the policies provided excess coverage, because \r\n  Horace Mann issued all three policies to Dee Dee, coverage should have been \r\n  limited to the policy with the highest limit or $250,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this court considered similar policy language in Moorer \r\n  and found in that case it effectively prohibited stacking of non-owned coverage.Â  \r\n  However, while the policy language in Moorer is identical to that in \r\n  the current policies, there are a number of significant differences in the two \r\n  cases.Â  Id. at 59, 496 S.E.2d at 882.Â  For instance, in Moorer, \r\n  only the first and third paragraphs are excerpted.Â  In addition, the heading \r\n  of the third paragraph, while couched in the same language as the current policies, \r\n  is neither bolded nor italicized as it is in the policies under consideration.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nWe find these differences make the cases distinguishable.Â  As the trial court \r\n  noted, the second paragraph concerning â€œOther Liability Coverageâ€ specifically \r\n  references the limitation of paragraph one.Â  Thus reading the provisions together \r\n  one could easily come to the conclusion that because paragraph two references \r\n  the limitation and paragraph three does not, paragraph three is not subject \r\n  to the limitation.Â  In addition, because the heading of paragraph three in the \r\n  current case is in bold print and italicized, it supports the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  interpretation that it is intentionally set off from the other provisions and \r\n  meant to be read as existing independently.Â  Accordingly, we agree with the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s interpretation of the policies.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find sufficient evidence in the record \r\n  to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the additional policies provided excess \r\n  coverage for Christianâ€™s injuries.Â Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n HEARN, C.J., dissenting:Â  I respectfully dissent \r\n  and would hold that Christopher was a resident relative of his mother at the \r\n  time of the accident.\r\nThe majorityâ€™s decision to affirm is largely driven by our \r\n  standard of review in a law case, i.e. whether there is any evidence to support \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s decision.Â  While I agree there is evidence supporting the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s decision that Christopher was dependant on his father, I would \r\n  hold the trial judge erred in not finding him dependant on his mother as well.Â  \r\n\r\nThe uncontroverted evidence reflects that \r\n  at the time of the accident in 1994, Christopher was a student at Clemson who \r\n  relied on both his mother and father for financial support.Â  Specifically, the \r\n  record demonstrates that his mother contributed to his rent and was a guarantor \r\n  on his lease.Â  Although Christopher testified his father gave him a lump sum \r\n  of money each semester for his tuition, the record also clearly shows that his \r\n  mother contributed toward his tuition, groceries, and automobile expenses.Â  \r\n  In fact, Christopher testified that he had no idea about the insurance on his \r\n  vehicle because he simply didnâ€™t â€œhandle that.â€Â  His mother testified without \r\n  contradiction that she paid the premium on Christopherâ€™s car insurance.Â  She \r\n  also paid the property taxes on the vehicle, claimed Christopher as a dependent \r\n  on her tax returns, and maintained a room for him in her home.Â  Christopher \r\n  received his mail at her address and came home approximately every two weeks \r\n  while he was at Clemson to do his laundry.Â  Christopher testified that he had \r\n  not stayed in his fatherâ€™s home overnight since 1992.Â  \r\nAlthough I believe the record actually shows that Christopher \r\n  was more dependent on his mother than on his father, I recognized there is some \r\n  evidence, albeit slight, to support the trial judgeâ€™s decision that Christopher \r\n  may have been more financially dependent on his father than on his mother.Â  \r\n  Nevertheless, it is simply irrelevant that Christopher may have been more dependent \r\n  on one parent than the other.Â  In either case, he still qualifies as a resident \r\n  relative under the plain and ordinary language of the policy.Â  The policy at \r\n  issue defines relative thusly:Â  â€œRelative means a person related to you by blood, \r\n  marriage or adoption who lives with you.Â  It includes your unmarried and dependent \r\n  child who is away at school.â€Â  In my view, Christopher falls squarely within \r\n  this definition of resident relative.Â  \r\nTo the extent the trial judge interpreted the policy provision \r\n  to mean that Christopher could only be dependent upon one of his parents and \r\n  found he was not dependent upon his mother, he erred as a matter of law.Â  Thus, \r\n  I would reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision that Christopher was not his motherâ€™s \r\n  resident relative.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Horace Mann contested ownership of the RX-7, but \r\n    the Answer filed on behalf of Scott, Christopher, and Dee Dee in the underlying \r\n    litigation admits that Christopher owned the car.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Scott and Christopherâ€™s parents divorced in the \r\n    1980â€™s.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  By Order dated July 28, 1998, the court established \r\n    a Supplemental Needs Trust for Christian to receive funds to assist him with \r\n    his extraordinary care needs.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  The dissent bases its opinion largely on its \r\n    interpretation of the trial courtâ€™s order and this statement in particular.Â  \r\n    The dissent believes the trial court â€œinterpreted the policy provision to \r\n    mean that Christopher could only be dependent on one of his parentsâ€ and, \r\n    therefore, erred as a matter of law.Â  We do not believe the trial court made \r\n    such a finding.Â  When considering the trial courtâ€™s treatment of this issue \r\n    as a whole, we believe it found Christopher was not dependent on either of \r\n    his parents.Â  The trial courtâ€™s statement simply asserts that if he were dependent \r\n    on either of the parents, it would be the father.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Appellants also make much of the fact that Dee \r\n    Dee listed Christopher as a dependent on her income tax return the year of \r\n    the accident.Â  However, as the trial court noted, she has claimed both children \r\n    as dependents on her income taxes since she and their father divorced in the \r\n    1980s, as she was permitted to do by court order.Â  Such an order issued in \r\n    relation to a divorce proceeding does not amount to a determination of dependency.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  See Auto Owners Ins.

Walsh appeal from the masterâ€™s \r\n  ruling denying them recovery on their counterclaims against William A. Lenz, \r\n  an unlicensed residential builder who was hired to construct their home.Â  The \r\n  Walshes contend the master erred in finding they could not recover on their \r\n  counterclaims because they failed to prove damages in excess of the amount of \r\n  the final unpaid draw due Lenz under the contract.Â  They argue the masterâ€™s \r\n  finding effectively violates the South Carolina statute that prohibits an unlicensed \r\n  residential builder from enforcing a construction contract.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 30, 1996, the Walshes entered into a contract with Lenz \r\n  to construct their home in the Wyboo Plantation subdivision of Manning, South \r\n  Carolina.Â  Lenz signed the document listing himself as the â€œcontractor.â€Â  The \r\n  contract price was $120,960.00, with payments to be made in regular installments \r\n  or â€œdraws.â€Â  The house was to be constructed according to plans and specifications \r\n  attached to the contract.Â  Lenz granted the Walshes allowances for the purchase \r\n  of certain items used in construction of the home, such as cabinets, flooring, \r\n  countertops, and appliances.Â  The Walshes were responsible for paying any amount \r\n  over the stated allowance.Â  All other materials were included in the contract \r\n  price.Â Â Â  \r\nLenz obtained a building permit on April 10, 1996 and began construction \r\n  on the home.Â  During construction, the Walshes made changes in some of the materials \r\n  for the home and often purchased items themselves without going through Lenz.Â  \r\n  Some of the materials the Walshes purchased, such as plumbing fixtures, light \r\n  fixtures, and cabinets, were provided for either as part of the contract price \r\n  or as a stated allowance.Â  Lenz and the Walshes had some disagreements, and \r\n  Lenz eventually halted construction after the Walshes failed to pay the amount \r\n  he requested in a June 1997 letter for overages incurred for additional work \r\n  and materials.Â  The Walshes never paid the fifth and final draw of $18,000.00 \r\n  due on the contract.Â  The Walshes prohibited Lenz from coming on the property \r\n  when the house was approximately ninety-five percent complete.Â  The Walshes \r\n  thereafter spent $2,792.65 on labor and $1,267.91 on materials to complete the \r\n  house.Â  \r\nIn August 1997, Lenz filed a notice for a mechanicâ€™s lien and a complaint \r\n  for foreclosure of the lien and breach of contract.Â  Lenz sought $14,377.58 \r\n  for unpaid amounts due for construction of the home.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Walshes answered, denying any amount was due, and counterclaimed for damages \r\n  for breach of contract, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  \r\n  They sought to recover amounts they personally expended for the construction \r\n  of the house and also sought damages for alleged delays in construction.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe Walshes subsequently moved for summary judgment as to Lenzâ€™s complaint \r\n  on the ground he was not a licensed residential builder as required by the South \r\n  Carolina Code and was, therefore, statutorily prohibited from enforcing the \r\n  contract.Â  By order filed March 22, 1999, circuit court Judge Howard P. King \r\n  granted the Walshesâ€™ motion and held Lenz was prohibited by then-section 40-59-130 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code [1]  \r\n  from pursuing any claim against the Walshes on the contract because he was not \r\n  a licensed residential builder when he entered the contract.Â Â Â  \r\nThe case was thereafter referred to a master-in-equity, Ralph F. \r\n  Cothran, who held a hearing and thereafter concluded in an order dated January \r\n  22, 2002 that the Walshes were not entitled to recover on any of their counterclaims.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe master found Lenz had provided labor and materials in the amount of $13,695.58 \r\n  that remained unpaid.Â  He also noted there was no dispute concerning the Walshesâ€™ \r\n  failure to pay the $18,000.00 final draw due on the contract.Â  Because the Walshes \r\n  refused to allow Lenz to complete the house, the master prohibited the Walshes \r\n  from recovering the amounts they paid for labor and materials to complete construction.Â  \r\n  The master further found many of the items the Walshes purchased were provided \r\n  for as allowances in the contract or were items outside the contract that they \r\n  voluntarily purchased.Â  The master concluded â€œ[t]hat the damages alleged and \r\n  proven by the [Walshes] do not exceed the unpaid amount of the final draw in \r\n  the amount of $18,000.00 and the [Walshes] therefore are not entitled to any \r\n  recovery on their counterclaim.â€Â  The Walshes filed a motion to alter or amend \r\n  the judgment, which was denied.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the Walshes contend the master erred in finding they are \r\n  not entitled to recover on their counterclaims because any damages they sustained \r\n  did not exceed the final payment of $18,000.00.Â  They argue this finding effectively \r\n  allows Lenz to recover under the contract in violation of South Carolina statutory \r\n  law that prohibits an unlicensed residential builder from enforcing a construction \r\n  contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nFormer section 40-59-130 proscribed an unlicensed residential builder from \r\n  enforcing a construction contract.Â  The statute provided in relevant part as \r\n  follows:\r\n\r\nAny residential builder or residential specialty contractor who undertakes or \r\n  attempts to undertake the business of residential building or residential specialty \r\n  contracting without first having procured a valid license or registered with \r\n  the commission as required . . . is guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \r\nA residential builder who does not have a license or residential specialty contractor \r\n  who is not registered as required may not bring any action either at law \r\n  or in equity to enforce the provisions of any contract for residential building \r\n  or residential specialty contracting which he entered into in violation \r\n  of this chapter. [2] \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina courts have held that, pursuant to the statute, a \r\n  builder who is not licensed at the time he enters into a contract for residential \r\n  construction may not bring an action to enforce the provisions of the contract. \r\n  [3] Â  The purpose of the statute is to protect homeowners. \r\n  [4] Â  Our supreme court has stated that, because the statute is plain and \r\n  unambiguous, it should be applied literally; thus, where a builder has no license, \r\n  he may not enforce the contract. [5] \r\n  Â  \r\nAlthough our courts have decided the aforementioned cases involving \r\n  attempts by unlicensed contractors to enforce residential construction contracts, \r\n  this state has never addressed whether a homeowner may recover payments made \r\n  to an unlicensed builder under a residential construction contract.Â  North Carolina \r\n  has considered the question, however, and held in Hawkins v. Holland [6]  that such payments are not recoverable.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn a case of first impression involving the consolidation of several suits \r\n  presenting the same issue, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina observed in \r\n  Hawkins that the grounds for the holdings in other jurisdictions are \r\n  (1) the statutes requiring licenses do not specifically authorize the recovery \r\n  of money paid; (2) such laws are penal in nature and must be strictly construed; \r\n  (3) the specification of particular penalties precludes the addition of other \r\n  penalties by judicial interpretation; (4) allowing the recovery of such payments \r\n  is not necessary to effectuate the policy of licensing statutes; and (5) equity \r\n  and the principles of restitution do not require that unlicensed contractors \r\n  be completely uncompensated or that contracting homeowners receive the completed \r\n  construction without cost. [7] Â Â Â  \r\nSouth Carolina case law provides support for the same reasoning. \r\n  [8] Â Â Â  We, therefore, find Hawkins persuasive and agree with its \r\n  determination that, generally, a homeowner may not recover payments already \r\n  made to an unlicensed contractor merely because the contractor did not hold \r\n  a license when the contract was executed.\r\nIn the current appeal, it is undisputed that Lenz may not bring an action to \r\n  enforce the contract pursuant to former section 40-59-130 since he was not licensed \r\n  at the time the contract was entered into.Â  At issue now is the Walshesâ€™ counterclaims.Â  \r\n  The Walshes argue the masterâ€™s ruling that they could not recover on their counterclaims \r\n  because they failed to prove damages in excess of the final unpaid draw effectively \r\n  allows Lenz to bring an action to enforce the contract in contravention of the \r\n  statute.Â  \r\nWe hold this situation is analogous to Hawkins, wherein the homeowners \r\n  were seeking reimbursement for payments previously made.Â  The Walshes voluntarily \r\n  paid for many items that were either outside the contract or were to be purchased \r\n  by the builder under the contract.Â  Regardless of whether they paid for these \r\n  items out of pocket or paid the builder a draw under the contract, the sums \r\n  spent by the Walshes went towards materials provided for in the contract and \r\n  those used in construction of the house.Â  Allowing the Walshes to recover these \r\n  sums would be indistinguishable from allowing them to recover money paid directly \r\n  to the builder to purchase construction materials.Â  Consequently, the decision \r\n  of the master is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â All references in this opinion are to former \r\n    section 40-59-130, which at the time of the courtâ€™s order was codified at \r\n    S.C.

Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-440 does not allow a period of probation \r\n  to exceed five years, and probation may not be extended absent a partial revocation.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Hackett maintains his probation could not be extended beyond November \r\n  8, 1998, and the February 5, 1999 order tolling his probation was therefore \r\n  invalid.2Â  We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24&#8209;21&#8209;440 (Supp. 2003) provides as follows:Â  \r\n  â€œThe period of probation or suspension of sentence shall not exceed a period \r\n  of five years and shall be determined by the judge of the court and may be continued \r\n  or extended within the above limit.â€Â  A trial courtâ€™s order extending probation \r\n  beyond the five-year period authorized by statute is an illegal sentence requiring \r\n  reversal.Â  State v. Sumpter, 334 S.C. 369, 371, 513 S.E.2d 373, 374 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate \r\n  the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Elmore v. Ramos, 327 S.C. 507, \r\n  510, 489 S.E.2d 663, 665 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œIn construing a statute, its words \r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced \r\n  construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€ Adkins v. Comcar \r\n  Indus., Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 411, 475 S.E.2d 762, 763 (1996). \r\n  â€œIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite \r\n  meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  and the court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Smith, 330 S.C. 237, 240, 498 S.E.2d 648, 650 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n  â€œWhere a statute is complete, plain, and unambiguous, legislative intent must \r\n  be determined from the language of the statute itself.â€Â  Id.Â  On the \r\n  other hand, â€œ[c]ourts will reject the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory \r\n  language when to accept it would lead to a result so absurd that it could not \r\n  possibly have been intended by Legislature, or would defeat plain legislative \r\n  intention; if possible we will construe a statute so as to escape an absurd \r\n  result and carry the legislative intention into effect.â€Â  State v. Gordon, \r\n  356 S.C. 143, 152-53, 588 S.E.2d 105, 110 (2003).Â Â  Â  \r\nConstruing the plain and ordinary meaning of the \r\n  words of Â§24-21-440, we find no prohibition for the tolling of a probationary \r\n  sentence under these circumstances.Â  In the instant case, the trial court did \r\n  not attempt to continue or extend probation beyond the five-year \r\n  limit imposed by Â§24-21-440.Â  Rather, the court tolled the probationary period \r\n  from running during the time Hackett absconded from supervision.Â  Thus, Â§ 24-21-440 \r\n  does not explicitly prohibit the tolling of time during which a probationary \r\n  term runs.Â  \r\nFurther, even if the â€œplain and ordinary meaning of the \r\n  statuteâ€ does not specifically authorize tolling of probation, we find tolling \r\n  is proper to reflect the legislative intent.Â  â€œThe primary concern in interpreting \r\n  a statute is to determine the intent of the legislature if it reasonably can \r\n  be discovered in the language when construed in the light of its intended purpose.â€Â  \r\n  Clemson Univ. v. Speth, 344 S.C. 310, 312-13, 543 S.E.2d 572, 573 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  The courts will reject a meaning when to accept such would lead \r\n  to a result so plainly absurd that the Legislature could not possibly have intended \r\n  it.Â  Id.Â  at 313, 543 S.E.2d at 573-74.Â  In interpreting statutes, the \r\n  courtâ€™s â€œsole function is to determine and, within constitutional limits, give \r\n  effect to the intention of the legislature, with reference to the meaning of \r\n  the language used and the subject matter and purpose of the statute.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Cobb, 355 S.C. 98, 101 n.4, 584 S.E.2d 371, 373 n.4 (2003); State \r\n  v. Ramsey, 311 S.C. 555, 561, 430 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1993).\r\nThe trial court logically determined Hackett should not \r\n  receive credit against the five-year probationary period when he was not under \r\n  the supervision of a probation officer.Â  Hackett habitually violated the terms \r\n  of his probation, and while he may have been spared the courtâ€™s harsh decision \r\n  to revoke probation on two occasions, the court properly determined probation \r\n  should be tolled during the time between the issuance of the probation arrest \r\n  warrant on January 5, 1995 and the time Hackett actually appeared before the \r\n  court on that warrant on February 5, 1999.Â  Clearly, Hackett was not reporting \r\n  and was not under probationary supervision during this time period, and the \r\n  time during which he absconded from supervision should not be included within \r\n  the five-year probationary period to which he was sentenced.Â  To allow a probationer \r\n  who is initially spared from revocation of probation to then abscond from supervision \r\n  and to escape any further punishment, free and clear of all consequences, as \r\n  long as he manages to elude apprehension for a set amount of time would lead \r\n  to an absurd result.Â  \r\nWe find further support for our position in the federal case law \r\n  arena.Â  In United States v. Green, 429 F. Supp. 1036 (W.D. Tex. 1977), \r\n  Green asserted that a probationary period running past five years from the start \r\n  of her probation was in violation of the federal statute that provided, â€œThe \r\n  period of probation, together with any extension thereof, shall not exceed five \r\n  years.â€Â  Id.Â  at 1038.Â  The district court held her contention must fall \r\n  because the period of time during which Green was in violation of her probation \r\n  tolled the running of the probationary term.Â  Id.Â  There, the court found, \r\n  â€œIt would be unreasonable to conclude that a probationer could violate conditions \r\n  of probation and keep the clock running at the same time, thereby annulling \r\n  both the principle and purpose of probation.â€Â  Id.Â  Additionally, in \r\n  the fourth circuitâ€™s opinion in United States v. Workman, 617 F.2d 48 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1980) the court, in discussing prior decisions regarding \r\n  the computation of the federal five-year limitation period of probation, noted \r\n  as follows:Â  â€œThe unifying principle implicit in the resulting decisions is \r\n  that a probationer can not obtain credit against the five-year period for any \r\n  period of time during which he was not, in fact, under probationary supervision \r\n  by virtue of his own wrongful act.â€Â  Id. at 51.Â  It observed the focus \r\n  was not on a simple mathematical computation of a five-year period from the \r\n  beginning date of probation, but was on whether the probationerâ€™s wrongful acts \r\n  resulted in termination of probationary supervision.Â  Id.Â  \r\nFinally, we note that in the Florida case of Ware v. State, 474 So.2d \r\n  332 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985), the Florida District Court of Appeal was also \r\n  faced with the novel issue of whether probation may be tolled during the period \r\n  of time a probationer absconds from supervision.Â  There, the appellantâ€™s three \r\n  year probationary period began on May 7, 1979.Â  On July 23, 1980, an affidavit \r\n  of violation of probation was filed alleging appellant had absconded from jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  On April 6, 1984, appellant pled guilty to second-degree murder.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  an amended affidavit of violation of probation and an amended warrant were filed \r\n  on May 31, 1984.Â  Following a hearing on July 13, 1984, the trial court revoked \r\n  appellantâ€™s probation.Â  Id.Â  at 333.Â  On appeal, appellant asserted the \r\n  court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the amended affidavit filed in 1984 which \r\n  included a violation that occurred after his probation had expired.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Noting it found no Florida case law directly on point, the court, citing several \r\n  cases including Workman and Green, held â€œcase law of other jurisdictions, \r\n  as well as simple logic, indicates that where a probationer â€˜absconds from supervision,â€™ \r\n  the probationary period is tolled until he is once more placed under probationary \r\n  supervision.â€Â  Id.Â  at 333-34.Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court properly tolled Hackettâ€™s \r\n  period of probation from January 5, 1995 to February 5, 1999, and thereafter \r\n  had jurisdiction to revoke Hackettâ€™s probation during the five-year period of \r\n  Hackettâ€™s active supervision.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 The only issue on appeal is the propriety of the tolling \r\n    of Hackettâ€™s probation from January 5, 1995 to February 5, 1999 as per the \r\n    courtâ€™s order dated February 5, 1999.Â  A finding that this tolling was proper \r\n    would necessarily mean Hackett was still on probation on September 19, 2002, \r\n    when the probation citation was issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3878","title":"State v.

Lloyd\r\nSpartanburg County\r\nTrial Court Case No.Â Â  2002-GS-42-02919\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  The State has petitioned for a rehearing and \r\n  argues our prior opinion was incorrect in several particulars. While we deny \r\n  the petition for rehearing, we briefly address the Stateâ€™s contentions.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe State argues initially that the record establishes its compliance \r\n  with the statutory mandate requiring that â€œ[b]lood and urine samples must be \r\n  obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners, registered \r\n  nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, and other medical personnel trained \r\n  to obtain the samples in a licensed medical facility.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 \r\n  (a) (Supp. 2003).Â  We disagree, for we remain firmly convinced that this record \r\n  fails to establish that Scott Darragh is either a licensed physician, registered \r\n  nurse or is otherwise properly qualified under the statute.Â  \r\nThe State further argues that it would have been unduly burdensome \r\n  to â€œutilize the out-of-state subpoena process, and expend Spartanburg Countyâ€™s \r\n  limited financial resources, to secure the testimony ofâ€ Darragh.Â  Assuming \r\n  Darragh has moved to another state as alleged, the suggestion that Darraghâ€™s \r\n  qualifications could be established only by his presence and testimony \r\n  at trial is specious.Â  \r\nWe also view as meritless the Stateâ€™s newly asserted efforts to recast \r\n  the issue as one of â€œchain of custody.â€Â  \r\nThe State finally contends that a remand to the trial court is the appropriate \r\n  remedy.Â  While we agree that a remand is appropriate under the circumstances, \r\n  we do not adopt the Stateâ€™s expansive proposal for the taking of new evidence.Â  \r\n  We have reviewed the cases cited by the State for the proposition that it is \r\n  entitled to a second bite of the apple to establish Darraghâ€™s qualifications: \r\n  State v. Primus, 312 S.C. 256, 440 S.E.2d 128 (1994) (case remanded to \r\n  lower court to conduct an initial Jackson v. Denno hearing to determine \r\n  whether the defendant was â€œin custodyâ€ for Miranda purposes when he made \r\n  statements to a police officer); State v. Williams, 258 S.C. 482, 189 \r\n  S.E.2d 299 (1972) (case remanded to trial court to consider defendantâ€™s motion \r\n  to strike the in-court identification testimony where the trial court â€œoverruled \r\n  the motion without going fully into whether or not there had, in fact, been \r\n  improper prior confrontations, and whether, in fact, either or both of the in-court \r\n  identifications were perchance the tainted product of any such unlawful confrontationâ€); \r\n  State v. Sampson, 317 S.C. 423, 454 S.E.2d 721 (Ct. App. 1995) (court \r\n  declined on appeal to rule on motion to suppress, instead remanding to the trial \r\n  court to conduct an initial hearing on the sufficiency of a search warrant affidavit).Â  \r\n  These cases represent remands to trial courts to address issues that were not \r\n  fully addressed and developed during the original trial.Â  Remand in such circumstances \r\n  is far removed from the request hereâ€”allowing the State a second evidentiary \r\n  hearing.Â  We conclude the remand should be limited to the existing record for \r\n  the trial court to determine whether the Stateâ€™s failure to establish the qualifications \r\n  of Darragh per section 56-5-2950(a) â€œmaterially affected the accuracy or reliability \r\n  of the tests results or the fairness of the testing procedure.â€ S.C. Code Ann.Â  \r\n  Â§ 56-5-2950 (e) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nThe original opinion, therefore, is withdrawn and \r\n  the attached opinion is substituted therefore.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      Kaye G.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and SolicitorÂ  \r\n  Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Timothy Scott Frey appeals his conviction for driving \r\n  under the influence.Â  Frey seeks a new trial, contending the circuit court improperly \r\n  admitted evidence of the results of a blood-alcohol test.Â  We reverse in part \r\n  and remand.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn December \r\n  21, 2001, Frey, while driving a pick-up truck in Spartanburg County, collided \r\n  with two Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s Office vehicles.Â  Frey was injured in \r\n  the accident and transported to the Spartanburg Regional Medical Center.Â  The \r\n  police officer investigating the accident, Trooper L.D. Smith of the South Carolina \r\n  Highway Patrol, met Frey at the hospital emergency room.Â  After Trooper Smith \r\n  advised Frey of his rights under the Implied Consent Laws, Frey consented to \r\n  a blood sample being taken for blood-alcohol level analysis. \r\nTrooper Smith prepared a standard-form SLED Blood Collection Report in connection \r\n  with obtaining the blood sample from Frey. According to the report, the blood \r\n  was drawn from Frey by an individual named â€œScott Darragh.â€Â  Darragh signed \r\n  the form in the space labeled â€œlicensed or trained collector,â€ and the form \r\n  was admitted in evidence over Freyâ€™s hearsay objection.Â  The report, however, \r\n  does not indicate what position Darragh held at the hospital nor did the State \r\n  offer any evidence to show what, if any, medical training or licensure Darragh \r\n  had that would qualify him to obtain the blood sample. \r\nAt trial, Frey sought to suppress the admission of the blood-alcohol \r\n  test results on the grounds the State did not present any evidence that the \r\n  blood sample was drawn by a qualified individual as required under the implied \r\n  consent statute.Â  The circuit court denied Freyâ€™s request and admitted the test \r\n  results.Â Â  Frey was convicted and sentenced.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit or exclude evidence is within his discretion \r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Elledge \r\n  v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, 352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, \r\n  792 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFrey argues the \r\n  circuit court erred in the admission of the blood-alcohol analysis test results.Â  \r\n\r\nUnder the Implied Consent Statute, an arresting \r\n  officer may direct that a blood sample be collected from a person arrested for \r\n  DUI if that person is unable to submit to a breathalyzer test for medical reasons.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2003).Â  The statute requires, however, that \r\n  blood samples be collected by qualified medical personnel: â€œBlood and urine \r\n  samples must be obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board of Medical \r\n  Examiners, registered nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, and other \r\n  medical personnel trained to obtain the samples in a licensed medical facility.â€ \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â  The circuit court found there was enough â€œcircumstantial \r\n  evidenceâ€ to establish statutory compliance based upon the fact that, following \r\n  the trooperâ€™s request, Darragh appeared in the emergency room wearing â€œhospital \r\n  like scrubs.â€ \r\nWe disagree with the reasoning of the circuit court.Â  With any question regarding \r\n  statutory construction and application, the court must always look first to \r\n  the legislative intent as determined from the plain language of the statute.Â  \r\n  State v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2002); State \r\n  v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 365-66, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  \r\n  The plain language of section 56-5-2950 requires that, when an officer directs \r\n  a blood sample be collected from a person arrested for DUI, the sample â€œmustâ€ \r\n  be obtained by trained, qualified medical personnel.Â  Our courts have consistently \r\n  held that use of words such as â€œshallâ€ or â€œmustâ€ indicates the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent to enact a mandatory requirement. See, e.g., South Carolina \r\n  Police Officers Ret. Sys. v. City of Spartanburg, 301 S.C. 188, 191, 391 \r\n  S.E.2d 239, 241 (1990) (noting that statutory prescriptions couched in language \r\n  such as â€œshallâ€ and â€œmustâ€ are mandatory in application and effect); Starnes \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 342 S.C. 216, 221, 535 S.E.2d 665, \r\n  667 (Ct. App. 2000) (same).Â  The plain language of section 56-5-2950 demands \r\n  that the State offer some evidence to establish compliance with this statutory \r\n  requirement.\r\nThe plain language of section 56-5-2950 further requires that we reject the \r\n  Stateâ€™s suggestion that the mere appearance of Scott Darragh in the emergency \r\n  room is sufficient, for the statute mandates that the blood sample â€œmustâ€ be \r\n  obtained by a trained medical professional.Â  Oneâ€™sÂ  mere appearance in a hospital \r\n  wearing generic hospital attire is not evidence of oneâ€™s medical training.Â  \r\n  We likewise reject the Stateâ€™s assertion that Darraghâ€™s signature on the SLED \r\n  form in the space labeled â€œlicensed or trained collectorâ€ is sufficient to establish \r\n  compliance with the statute.Â  Simply signing a preprinted form does not provide \r\n  any indicia that the signatoryâ€™s qualifications meet the specific licensing \r\n  or training requirements of section 56-5-2950. \r\n  [1] Â  To hold otherwise would render the minimal foundational requirement \r\n  of section 56-5-2950 without any meaningful force or effect. In light of the \r\n  Stateâ€™s failure to satisfy this basic requirement, we are constrained to find \r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the foundational requirements of section \r\n  56-5-2950 had been satisfied. [2] \r\n  \r\nThe State alternatively \r\n  asserts that, assuming Darragh was not qualified under the statute to collect \r\n  the blood sample, suppression would not be warranted.Â  Specifically, the State \r\n  contends Frey was not prejudiced by the failure to comply with the statute.Â  \r\n  The State bases its argument on the principle that where a statute is silent \r\n  about the admissibility of evidence, the â€œexclusion of evidence should be limited \r\n  to violations of constitutional rights and not to statutory violations, at least \r\n  where the appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice at trial resulting from the \r\n  failure to follow statutory procedures.â€ State v. Sheldon, 344 S.C. 340, \r\n  343, 543 S.E.2d 585, 586 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting State v. Chandler, \r\n  267 S.C. 138, 226 S.E.2d 553 (1976)). \r\nRecent revisions \r\n  to section 56-5-2950 are in accord with the Stateâ€™s position.Â  The statute was \r\n  amended in 2003 to include the addition of subsection (e), [3]  which provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nThe failure to follow any of these policies, procedures, \r\n  and regulations, or the provisions of this section, shall result in the exclusion \r\n  from evidence any tests results, if the trial judge or hearing officer \r\n  finds that such failure materially affected the accuracy or reliability of \r\n  the tests results or the fairness of the testing procedure. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-5-2950 (e) (Act No. 61, 2003 S.C. Acts 689) (emphasis added).\r\nSince the statutory \r\n  mandate in question is inextricably connected to the accuracy and reliability \r\n  of the blood test results, we remand to the trial court.Â  We are persuaded that \r\n  in the first instance the issue of prejudice should be addressed by the trial \r\n  court.Â  We find instructive the case of State v. Sheldon, 344 S.C. 340, \r\n  543 S.E.2d 585 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Sheldon, a then on-duty state trooper, was \r\n  charged with reckless homicide.Â  The Highway Patrol participated in the accident \r\n  investigation, in violation of a statute.Â  As a result of the statutory violation, \r\n  the trial court granted Sheldonâ€™s motion to suppress evidence gathered or prepared \r\n  by the Highway Patrolâ€™s Multi-disciplinary Accident Investigation Team (MAIT).Â  \r\n  The State appealed, and this court noted that evidence obtained in violation \r\n  of a statute â€œis not necessarily inadmissible absent a demonstration of prejudice \r\n  resulting from the violation.â€ Id. at 344, 543 S.E.2d at 586.Â  We remanded \r\n  to the trial court since â€œ[i]t did not make any findings on whether Sheldon \r\n  would be prejudiced by MAITâ€™s investigation of the collision.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n  Here, the trial court on remand shall, on the existing record, determine whether \r\n  the Stateâ€™s failure to comply with section 56-5-2950 (a) â€œmaterially affected \r\n  the accuracy or reliability of the tests results or the fairness of the testing \r\n  procedure.â€Â  Cf. State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 6, 562 S.E.2d 472, \r\n  474 (2002) (noting that, in a DUI prosecution, breathalyzer operator error did \r\n  not impact the accuracy of the breath test results, concluding â€œ[t]here is no \r\n  question the breathalyzer machine was operating properly and its results were \r\n  reliableâ€);Â  State v. Chandler, 267 S.C. 138, 142, 226 S.E.2d 553, 555 \r\n  (1976) (holding that evidence seized at nighttime was properly admitted pursuant \r\n  to warrant authorizing a search â€œin the daytime onlyâ€ since the court determined \r\n  the violation had no impact on the reliability or probative value of the evidence).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the \r\n  State failed to establish Freyâ€™s blood sample was obtained by a licensed physician, \r\n  registered nurse, or â€œother medical personnel trained to obtain the samples \r\n  in a licensed medical facilityâ€ as mandated by section 56-5-2950, we remand \r\n  to the trial court to determine whether â€œsuch failure materially affected the \r\n  accuracy or reliability of the tests results or the fairness of the testing \r\n  procedure.â€Â Â Â  An answer in the affirmative shall entitle Frey to a new trial, \r\n  but otherwise, the admission of the blood test results and resulting conviction \r\n  shall stand affirmed. Â \r\n REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â We reject the Stateâ€™s argument to the extent it relies on \r\n    the signature of Darragh as substantive evidence of his qualifications to \r\n    collect the blood sample.Â  We find guidance on this point in the manner our \r\n    Rules of Criminal Procedure address the admission of a report of chemical \r\n    analysis to establish the physical evidence of a controlled substance.Â  Under \r\n    narrowly limited circumstances, such a report signed by the chemist or analyst \r\n    who performed the test may be admitted for chain of custody and substantive \r\n    purposes. Rule 6(a), SCRCrimP.Â  However, if the defendant timely objects to \r\n    the admission of the report, the signed report alone is insufficient to establish \r\n    that the tests were performed by a SLED-certified chemist and were conducted \r\n    pursuant to SLED-approved procedures.Â  The rule instead requires that, in \r\n    the face of a proper objection to the report,Â  â€œthe trial judge shall require \r\n    the chemist or analyst to be present at trial for the purpose of personally \r\n    testifying.â€Â Â  In the present case, the admission of the blood collection \r\n    report to establish the qualifications of Darragh was hotly contestedâ€”subject \r\n    to repeated defense objections.Â  While the SLED form here may maintain its \r\n    efficacy for chain of custody purposes, we decline to find that the medical \r\n    training and qualification requirements mandated under section 56-5-2950 may \r\n    be proven by the mere signature on the form.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â We are mindful of the legitimate concern of the trial court that law \r\n    enforcement officers who request blood samples should not be required to demand \r\n    detailed background information about the hospital employee who shows up to \r\n    take the sample.Â  This concern, however, is misplaced.Â  There is no basis \r\n    to find fault with the actions of Trooper Smith.Â  Law enforcement officers \r\n    may generally rely on the implicit and explicit assurances of medical providers \r\n    regarding the qualifications of personnel who are assigned to assist them \r\n    in their investigation.Â  The failure of proof in this case is directly attributable \r\n    to the Stateâ€™s failure to establish the qualifications of Scott Darragh.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The 2003 revisions to Â§ 56-5-2950 became effective \r\n    shortly after the trial of this case.Â  Because subsection (e) addresses procedural \r\n    rather than substantive rights, it is remedial in nature, and therefore retroactive \r\n    in its application. See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue v. Rosemary \r\n    Coin Machs., Inc., 339 S.C. 25, 28, 528 S.E.2d 416, 418 (2000) (noting \r\n    that â€œstatutes that are remedial or procedural in nature are generally held \r\n    to operate retrospectivelyâ€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3932","title":"Nasser-Moghaddassi v.

Sutherland, Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3932\r\nHeard January 11, 2005 â€“ Filed January \r\n  31, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n  &nbsp; \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJeffrey Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nKimberly Fisher Dunham, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this domestic relations action, Mrs. Farideh Gerami \r\n  Moghaddassi (Mother) appeals the family court order awarding custody of the \r\n  coupleâ€™s children to Mr. Majid Nasser-Moghaddassi (Father).Â  Additionally, Mother \r\n  appeals the distribution of the marital estate and the award of the marital \r\n  residence to Father.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Moghaddassis, who were married in February of 1983, have three \r\n  minor children: a daughter who was sixteen at the time of the final hearing, \r\n  a son who was thirteen, and another daughter who was seven.Â  Mother and Father \r\n  are both natives of Iran and were both educated in England.Â  They have been \r\n  in the United States since 1986, when Father, an engineer, found employment \r\n  here.Â  \r\nAccording to Fatherâ€™s trial testimony, the parties argued frequently.Â  When \r\n  their oldest daughter was nearing her teenage years, Father and Motherâ€™s arguments \r\n  progressed into physical altercations.Â  Father recounted one instance where \r\n  Mother became upset because their daughter and her friends were in a room without \r\n  adult supervision, while Father and Mother were in another part of the house:\r\n\r\nMy wife. . . . she started pushing me around that, Youâ€™re not doing anything \r\n  as a father.Â  Sheâ€™s up to no good in there and thereâ€™s a boy in the room. \r\nI said, Hey, they are all teenagers, they are friends.Â  But she pushed me around, \r\n  pushed me around and got physical with me and she hit me with aâ€”a childrenâ€™s \r\n  recorder on the floor she picked up and she hit me in the wrist.Â  And it was \r\n  very painful.Â  I went down on my knees and she hit me in the head. . . . \r\n\r\nAs a result of the incident, Mother was charged with criminal domestic violence \r\n  and spent several days in jail.Â  Father related another episode: â€œwe had a little \r\n  argument and that wasâ€”when that was over, I was sitting and working with the \r\n  computer and suddenly she approached me from the back and poured hot coffee \r\n  on my head.â€Â  He further averred that when angry, Mother would scratch his face, \r\n  and that she has broken his eyeglasses on five occasions.Â  Frequently, the children \r\n  were present during these encounters.Â  \r\nThe relationships between the children and their mother are strained.Â  \r\n  Father stated that his wife would call their sixteen-year-old daughter â€œbitch, \r\n  prostitute, . . . whoreâ€ in front of her friends.Â  Additionally, Father testified \r\n  to seeing his wife abusing their daughter, â€œ[p]hysically pulling her hair, pushing \r\n  her around.â€Â  During the year preceding trial the oldest daughter refused to \r\n  see her mother.Â  According to Father, Mother mistreated the younger children \r\n  as well, including â€œslapping around, pushingâ€ their son.Â  \r\nA Guardian ad Litem (GAL or guardian) was appointed to represent the interests \r\n  of the three minor children.Â  She prepared a report which discusses her interviews \r\n  with, among other persons, the partiesâ€™ children.Â  The report describes the \r\n  childrenâ€™s accounts of Motherâ€™s behavior:&nbsp; \r\n\r\nThe oldest child . . . . relayed to me that her parents have had lots of fights.Â  \r\n  Her mother always insults her father.Â  She also related that her mother always \r\n  instigates and starts the fights with her father. . . . She describes her mother \r\n  as yelling and cursing. . . .Â  She also related to me that her mother has continually \r\n  called her a whore, has hit her and her father on many occasions.\r\n. . . She does not want to see her mother at all.\r\n. . . [T]he thirteen year old son . . . . relayed to me that his mother always \r\n  starts the fights.Â  That he has had to call the Police two times.Â  He related \r\n  how recently his mother hit his father with the broom and was clawing at him. \r\n  . . . He described his mother to me as â€œmom is abusiveâ€.Â  He described an incident \r\n  where the mother hit him with a metal pole and pushed him onto some stairs. \r\n  . . . \r\nI then spoke with . . . the six year old. . . . She said her mother fus[s]ed \r\n  a lot at her dad and broke his glasses and hit him a lot with the broom, a flashlight \r\n  and rock. . . . She told me that she was scared of her mother, she hits everybody \r\n  in the family. . . .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFather initiated divorce proceedings.Â  The family court: (1) granted a divorce \r\n  on one yearâ€™s separation; (2) awarded custody of the three minor children to \r\n  Father; (3) ordered Father to pay $1,300 per month in permanent, periodic alimony; \r\n  (4) apportioned the marital estate 60% to Father, 40% to Mother; and (5) distributed \r\n  the marital residence to Father as part of his share of the marital estate.Â  \r\n  The issues before this Court relate to custody of the children and division \r\n  of the marital assets.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from \r\n  the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, \r\n  603 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 \r\n  S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does \r\n  not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, \r\n  349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. \r\n  195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial \r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry \r\n  v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981); Murdock v. Murdock, \r\n  338 S.C. 322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999); see also Dorchester \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (ruling that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for \r\n  direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family \r\n  courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  An appellate court \r\n  â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child \r\n  custody for that of the trial court.â€&nbsp; Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. \r\n  7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve \r\n  appellant of her burden to convince this Court the family court committed error.&nbsp; \r\n  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.\r\n         \r\n  Was the Guardian ad Litemâ€™s recommendation the product of an independent, balanced, \r\n  and impartial investigation, well documented and supported by the facts?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.\r\n         \r\n  Did the family court err in ordering Mother to pay a portion of the Guardian \r\n  ad Litem fees?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n        Was the distribution of the marital estate fair and equitable in light of the \r\n  facts of this case?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the \r\n  family court err in awarding Father title to the marital residence?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         V.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Does the evidence support the family courtâ€™s denial of an award of personal \r\n  property to Mother?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         VI.\r\n        &nbsp;Did the \r\n  family court err by not awarding Mother attorneyâ€™s fees and costs?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother asserts \r\n  six exceptions to the family court order.Â  We disagree with Motherâ€™s contentions \r\n  and affirm the family courtâ€™s decision.\r\nI.Â  The GALâ€™s Recommendation\r\nMother first \r\n  argues the GALâ€™s recommendation was not the product of an independent, balanced, \r\n  and impartial investigation.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe paramount and controlling \r\n  factor in every custody dispute is the best interests of the children.Â  Shirley \r\n  v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000); Paparella \r\n  v. Paparella, 340 S.C.186, 189, 531 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In \r\n  Shirley, we articulated the South Carolina rule governing custody cases:\r\n\r\nIn all custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the childâ€™s \r\n  welfare and best interests.Â  In reaching a determination as to custody, the \r\n  family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas \r\n  of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, \r\n  familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  Additionally, the court must \r\n  assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness, and attitude as they impact the child.\r\n\r\n342 S.C. at 330, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 430 (citations omitted).Â  When determining the best interests of a child, \r\n\r\n\r\nthe family court should consider several factors, including: \r\n  who has been the primary caretaker; the conduct, attributes, and fitness of \r\n  the parents; the opinions of third parties (including the guardian, \r\n  expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and sex of the children.Â  \r\n  Rather than merely adopting the recommendation of the guardian, the court, by \r\n  its own review of all the evidence, should consider the character, fitness, \r\n  attitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent as they impact the child \r\n  as well as all psychological, physical, environmental, spiritual, educational, \r\n  medical, family, emotional and recreational aspects of the childâ€™s life.Â  \r\n\r\nPirayesh v. Pirayesh, \r\n  359 S.C. 284, 296, 596 S.E.2d 505, 512 (Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis added) (citations \r\n  omitted). Â \r\nIn the landmark \r\n  opinion, Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 555 S.E.2d 386 (2001), our supreme \r\n  court reviewed the historical development of the role of the GAL in South Carolina:\r\n\r\nA guardian ad litem, as the later phrase suggests, is a guardian for \r\n  litigation.Â  Traditionally, GALs were lawyers appointed by the court to appear \r\n  in a lawsuit on behalf of a minor or incompetent.Â  Over time, the role of the \r\n  guardian was defined by statute as well as by common law.Â  Lay persons as well \r\n  as lawyers were appointed by the court in cases to protect those the court or \r\n  legislature deemed could not protect themselves. . . . \r\nThe GAL functions as a representative of the court, appointed \r\n  to assist the court in making its determination of custody by advocating for \r\n  the best interest of the children and providing the court with an objective \r\n  view.Â  Fleming v. Asbill, 326 S.C. 49, 483 S.E.2d 751 (1997); Townsend \r\n  v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 474 S.E.2d 424 (1996).Â  Standard setting for \r\n  GALs in this â€œnewâ€ role has been very ad hoc.Â  The legislature has set standards \r\n  for a GAL appointed in abuse and neglect cases.Â  However, there has been no \r\n  comprehensive or coherent approach for the setting of standards for the use \r\n  of GALs in private custody disputes. . . . \r\n\r\nPatel at 287-88, \r\n  555 S.E.2d at 389 (footnote omitted).Â  Due to the new role guardians play, and \r\n  â€œ[w]hile a more complete approach [was] being examined by the three branches \r\n  of government,â€ the Patel court â€œset forth some base line standardsâ€:\r\n\r\nIn connection with developing a recommendation to the family court, a GAL shall: \r\n  (1) conduct an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation to \r\n  determine the facts relevant to the situation of the child and the family, which \r\n  should include: reviewing relevant documents; meeting with and observing the \r\n  child in the home setting and considering the childâ€™s wishes, if appropriate; \r\n  and interviewing parents, caregivers, and others with knowledge relevant to \r\n  the case; (2) advocate for the childâ€™s best interest by making specific and \r\n  clear recommendations, when necessary, for evaluation, services, and treatment \r\n  for the child and the childâ€™s family; (3) attend all court hearings and provide \r\n  accurate, current information directly to the court; (4) maintain a complete \r\n  file with notes rather than relying upon court files; and (5) present to the \r\n  court and all other parties clear and comprehensive written reports, including \r\n  but not limited to a final report regarding the childâ€™s best interest, which \r\n  includes conclusions and recommendations and the facts upon which the reports \r\n  are based. . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 288-89, \r\n  555 S.E.2d 390.\r\nThe facts that \r\n  spawned the Patel prophylactic involved the conduct of a GAL who the \r\n  court found had failed to conduct â€œan objective, balanced investigation.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 286, 555 S.E.2d at 388.Â  The guardian â€œdid not keep notes of her observations \r\n  during her investigation and failed to produce a written report.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  More significantly, she spent more time speaking with the husband than the wife \r\n  and taped a conversation between the parties without the wifeâ€™s knowledge.Â  \r\n  Id. Therefore, the court concluded the guardian â€œdid not afford each \r\n  party a balanced opportunity to interact with her.Â  Her method of evaluation \r\n  created a high potential for bias towards Husband.â€Â  Id. at 286, 555 \r\n  S.E.2d at 389.Â  With the interim standards as a guide, the court remanded the \r\n  custody decision for a new hearing.Â  Id. at 289, 555 S.E.2d at 390.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, the legislature \r\n  responded to Patelâ€™s invitation for action by passing S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§Â§ 20-7-1545 through -1557.Â  As the Patel court observed, several statutes \r\n  dealing with GALs were already in existence.Â  See 347 S.C. at 287, 555 \r\n  S.E.2d at 389 (â€œThe legislature has enacted some statutes regarding GALs.Â  In \r\n  the context of children, the legislature has enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-121 \r\n  (Supp. 2000) (creating a GAL program for children in abuse and neglect proceedings); \r\n  Section 2[0]-7-1570 (mandating the appointment of a GAL for children involved \r\n  in a termination of parental rights proceeding); Section 20-7-952 (requiring \r\n  a GAL in a paternity action); and Section 20-7-1732 (requiring the appointment \r\n  of a GAL for children involved in an adoption proceeding).â€).Â  The 2002 act \r\n  provides comprehensive, coherent guidance for guardians in private custody disputes, \r\n  guidance that was lacking in pre-Patel days.Â  In essence, the statute \r\n  codifies the Patel standards.Â  See Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, \r\n  359 S.C. 284, 293, 596 S.E.2d 505, 510 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting Â§ 20-7-1549 codifies \r\n  the Patel guidelines â€œwith more specificityâ€).Â  However, Â§Â§ 20-7-1545 \r\n  through â€“1557 only apply to guardians appointed on or after January 15, 2003, \r\n  the date the act took effect.Â  The guardian in the instant case was appointed \r\n  on May 23, 2001.Â  Consequently, Patel and its progeny control.Â  \r\nSince Patel, the \r\n  appellate entities of this State have twice addressed the independence and objectivity \r\n  of an appointed guardian.Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 596 S.E.2d \r\n  505 (Ct. App. 2004), was â€œdifferent from Patel in that Wifeâ€™s argument \r\n  stem[med], not from the guardianâ€™s incomplete investigation of her, but rather \r\n  from the guardianâ€™s allegedly superficial investigation of Husbandâ€™s parenting \r\n  abilities.â€Â  Id. at 294, 596 S.E.2d at 511.Â  We opined that â€œthe requirements \r\n  set forth in Patel were meant not only to protect the parents who are \r\n  the subjects of the guardianâ€™s investigation but also to ensure that the fate \r\n  of a childâ€™s living arrangements does not rest in the hands of a guardian whose \r\n  investigation is biased or otherwise incomplete.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nFactually, the Pirayesh \r\n  court found the guardian had conducted a â€œsuperficial investigationâ€ of the \r\n  husband.Â  Id. at 295, 596 S.E.2d at 511.Â  While she â€œvisited Wifeâ€™s home \r\n  several times to interview her and the children,â€ there was â€œno indication that \r\n  she ever interviewed Husband and the children while they visited his home in \r\n  Charlotte.â€Â  Id.Â  Further, the GALâ€™s recommendation that the children \r\n  be placed with the husband â€œwas largely based upon the concerns of the childrenâ€™s \r\n  counselor regarding counseling appointments they had missed and a psychological \r\n  evaluation that had still not been scheduled for the partiesâ€™ daughter.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Yet, evidence suggested both parties were responsible for these acts of omission.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Additionally, the guardian incorrectly testified that one child \r\n  had nine unexcused absences while in Wifeâ€™s care, when actually she had only \r\n  five excused absences.Â  Id.Â  â€œWhile this mistake by the guardian appeared \r\n  to be inadvertent, the guardian was adamant during her testimony that the daughter \r\n  had four additional unexcused absences.â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  we agreed with the wife that â€œthe guardianâ€™s recommendation did not result from \r\n  a fair and impartial investigationâ€ under Patel, and we remanded for \r\n  a new custody hearing.Â  Id. at 296-97, 596 S.E.2d at 511-12.Â  \r\n Latimer v. \r\n  Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 602 S.E.2d 32 (2004), afforded the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court an opportunity to apply Patel.Â  The parties were divorced, \r\n  and the father had custody of their minor child.Â  Id. at 379, 602 S.E.2d \r\n  at 34.Â  When the father decided to relocate from South Carolina to Michigan, \r\n  the mother and her parents petitioned the family court for a permanent restraining \r\n  order.Â  Id.Â  The family court â€œconcluded it to be in Childâ€™s best interests \r\n  to allow Father to move to Michigan with Child.â€Â  Id.Â  Mother appealed, \r\n  contending the guardian failed to adhere to the Patel standards.Â  Motherâ€™s \r\n  argument was rebuffed by the courtâ€™s conclusion that â€œthe guardian meticulously \r\n  conducted an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 387, 602 S.E.2d at 38.Â  Unlike Patel, where the guardianâ€™s investigation \r\n  â€œoverwhelmingly favored the husband,â€ the guardian in Latimer â€œshowed \r\n  no bias or prejudice in the investigation.â€Â  Id. at 388, 602 S.E.2d at \r\n  38.Â  Rather, she submitted two reports and visited the mother on several occasions, \r\n  commenting that the motherâ€™s residence was â€œâ€˜very adequate,â€™â€ and that â€œMother \r\n  did a good job with Child, takes good care of her and her husband seemed â€˜very \r\n  genteel.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  Finally, although the father lived in Michigan, the \r\n  GAL observed him and the child on two occasions, and she requested that the \r\n  father send a portfolio of information regarding the town in which he lived, \r\n  his residence, and the local schools.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the family courtâ€™s \r\n  custody decision was upheld.Â  Id.\r\nHere, the family \r\n  court found the GAL â€œconducted an extremely thorough investigation of this matter.â€Â  \r\n  The GAL compiled two separate reports to assist the court in its custody decision.Â  \r\n  She interviewed sixteen individuals, including the parties, their children, \r\n  the maternal grandmother, counselors, neighbors, teachers, and fellow employees.Â  \r\n  Among other documents, the guardian reviewed counseling records, school files, \r\n  psychological evaluations, and police reports.Â  She visited both homes, and \r\n  she orchestrated counseling for the parties and the children.Â  \r\nThe GAL spent time with \r\n  both parents and all three children.Â  However, Mother claims the guardian did \r\n  not observe the children while in the care of both parents.Â  The fragmented \r\n  Record on Appeal does not provide a full picture as to the reasons behind this \r\n  alleged failure.Â  The only evidence that the GAL did not see the children in \r\n  Motherâ€™s care is a page of the trial transcript which is provided out of sequence, \r\n  and, therefore, out of context.Â  Mother states, â€œShe called me and she said \r\n  that sheâ€™s coming to the house.â€Â  â€œSheâ€ is never identified because the preceding \r\n  nine pages of trial testimony are omitted.Â  Even so, it appears from this testimony \r\n  that on one occasion the GAL scheduled an appointment to observe the children \r\n  with Mother, but, in Motherâ€™s words, the children â€œrefused to come.â€Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the cross-examination of the guardian conducted by Motherâ€™s counsel is not part \r\n  of the record.Â  Consequently, we are not persuaded that the guardianâ€™s \r\n  investigation fell short of the balanced and impartial standard of Patel.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find that, unlike \r\n  in Patel, the guardian in this case gave a balanced opportunity for both \r\n  sides to interact with her, and her method of evaluation did not create \r\n  a potential for bias in favor of Father.Â  She fairly and thoroughly served as \r\n  an advocate for the childrenâ€™s interest.Â  \r\nFurther, the evidence \r\n  in the record supports the findings of the GAL.Â  The relationships between Mother \r\n  and her three children are negativistic.Â  As stated by the family court, Mother \r\n  â€œattempts to rule by harangue rather than reason; by vituperation rather than \r\n  nurture.â€Â  Mother offered no testimony or other evidence supporting her proposition \r\n  the GALâ€™s recommendation unjustly favored the husband.Â  After reviewing the \r\n  record, we are convinced that the guardianâ€™s investigation was independent, \r\n  balanced, and impartial.Â  Therefore, we affirm the grant of custody to Father. \r\n\r\nII.Â  The GALâ€™s \r\n  Fee\r\nMother \r\n  argues the family court erred in ordering her to pay a percentage of the GAL \r\n  fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of \r\n  GAL fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court judge and will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Shirley v. \r\n  Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In the \r\n  present case, in which we have determined the GAL conducted an independent, \r\n  balanced, and impartial investigation, it is not an abuse of discretion to require \r\n  Mother to bear the cost for 22%, or a total of $1,543, of the GAL fees.Â  This \r\n  requirement is fair and should not create a hardship, considering that the court \r\n  awarded Mother alimony, did not require her to pay child support, and provided \r\n  that she could pay the GAL fee at a rate of $50 per month.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  affirm the ruling of the family court.\r\nIII.Â  Distribution \r\n  of the Marital Estate\r\nMother \r\n  challenges the family courtâ€™s overall distribution of the marital estate, alleging \r\n  the distribution was neither fair nor equitable.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe doctrine \r\n  of equitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is, among \r\n  other things, an economic partnership.â€Â  Mallet v. Mallet, 323 S.C. 141, \r\n  150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œUpon dissolution of the marriage, \r\n  marital property should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly \r\n  reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, regardless of who holds \r\n  legal title.â€Â  Morris v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525, 531, 517 S.E.2d 720, 723 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In making an equitable distribution of marital property, the \r\n  family court must, among other things: (1) identify the marital property, both \r\n  real and personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine the fair \r\n  market value of the identified property; (3) apportion the marital estate according \r\n  to the contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to the acquisition \r\n  of the property during the marriage, their respective assets and incomes, and \r\n  any special equities they may have in marital assets; and (4) provide for an \r\n  equitable division of the marital estate, including the manner in which the \r\n  distribution is to take place.Â  Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 375 S.E.2d \r\n  338 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nThe family court \r\n  valued the marital estate at $83,609.Â  The valuation included all marital assets: \r\n  equity in the marital home, $78,530; time-share in Hilton Head, $10,900; Mazda \r\n  automobile, $3,000; Toyota automobile, $3,000; household furnishings, $5,000; \r\n  jewelry, $3,550; 401K, $7,796; and marital debt, $28,167.Â  The family court \r\n  found that â€œHusbandâ€™s direct contributions to the acquisition of property is \r\n  far greater than the Wifeâ€™s.â€Â  Therefore, the estate was apportioned 60% to \r\n  Father, 40% to Mother.Â  Finally, the court distributed the assets as follows: \r\n  Father received the marital residence, the Mazda, half of the household furnishings, \r\n  and all of the coupleâ€™s outstanding debt, for a total distribution of $55,863; \r\n  Mother received the Hilton Head time-share, the Toyota, the jewelry, the 401K, \r\n  and half of the household furnishings, for a total distribution of $27,746.Â  \r\n  Father was then ordered to pay Mother $5,697 to accomplish the appropriate 60/40 \r\n  apportionment.Â  We find this division of the marital estate to be fair and equitable \r\n  given the facts of this case.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the equitable distribution \r\n  effectuated by the family court.\r\nIV.Â  Award of the \r\n  Marital Residence\r\nMother \r\n  argues the family court erroneously awarded the marital residence to Father \r\n  and that she should have been given the house as an incident of support.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen evaluating \r\n  the efficacy of a disposition of the marital residence, distinction must be \r\n  drawn between an award that is incident to supportâ€”either child or spousalâ€”and \r\n  an assignment that is part of the equitable distribution of the partiesâ€™ assets.Â  \r\n  A review of South Carolina case law demonstrates that awards incident to support \r\n  may be made only where compelling circumstances exist, while title to the residence \r\n  may be given to one of the parties in compliance with the ordinary rules of \r\n  equitable distribution.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina \r\n  recognizes that use of the marital home may be granted as an incident of support.Â  \r\n  See Whitfield v. Hanks, 278 S.C. 165, 293 S.E.2d 314 (1982); Tucker \r\n  v. Tucker, 282 S.C. 261, 264, 317 S.E.2d 764, 767 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œAn award \r\n  of possession of the marital home is an incident of support and not a division \r\n  of property.â€).Â  In Johnson v. Johnson, 285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d \r\n  443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985), we stated that â€œ[b]eginning with the pronouncement \r\n  in [Whitfield], . . . our appellate courts have struggled to develop \r\n  guidelines to aid the family court in determining the appropriate disposition \r\n  to be made of the marital home.â€Â  Id. (citing Tucker v. Tucker, \r\n  282 S.C. 261, 317 S.E.2d 764 (1984); Thompson v. Brunson, 283 S.C. 221, \r\n  321 S.E.2d 622 (Ct. App. 1984); Shafer v. Shafer, 283 S.C. 205, 320 S.E.2d \r\n  730 (Ct. App. 1984); Jones v. Jones, 281 S.C. 96, 314 S.E.2d 33 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984); Smith v. Smith, 280 S.C. 257, 312 S.E.2d 560 (Ct. App. 1984)).Â  \r\n  The Johnson court amalgamated these attempts and provided the following \r\n  instruction:Â  \r\n\r\nFirst, the family court must begin with the premise that division and distribution \r\n  of the marital home should be accomplished at the time of entry of the judgment \r\n  of divorce. . . . the family courtâ€™s objective should be to dissolve the marriage, \r\n  sever all entangling legal relations and place the parties in a position from \r\n  which they can begin anew. . . .\r\nSecond, the court must carefully consider the claim of a party that the interests \r\n  of that party or the children are so predominant, when balanced against the \r\n  interest of the other, that an award of exclusive possession of the marital \r\n  home is compelled.Â  In Thompson v. Brunson, supra, and Shafer \r\n  v. Shafer, supra, we noted some of the interests which may be considered \r\n  compelling: (1) adequate shelter for minors; (2) suitable housing for a handicapped \r\n  or infirm spouse; and (3) the inability of the occupying spouse to otherwise \r\n  obtain adequate housing.\r\nIn this same context, the court must consider the interests of the non-occupying \r\n  spouse.Â  An award of exclusive possession to one party requires that the other \r\n  defer the realization of the value of his share of the marital home.Â  Such a \r\n  requirement is usually a burden.Â  Therefore, before the family court imposes \r\n  such a burden, it should consider the size and expansiveness of the home in \r\n  relation to the expected use and the cost of maintaining the home in comparison \r\n  to the benefits received.Â  Further, the court must consider the potential duration \r\n  of the exclusive possession.Â  The family court may not award exclusive possession \r\n  of the marital home for an unlimited period of time.Â  In the exercise of sound \r\n  discretion, the court must make the award for a reasonable time based on the \r\n  circumstances warranting the award in the first instance.Â  See Thompson \r\n  v. Brunson, 321 S.E.2d at 625.\r\nFinally, the family court must make some provision in its order for eventual \r\n  distribution of the marital home and state the terms upon which such distribution \r\n  will be made. \r\n\r\nJohnson, 285 S.C. \r\n  at 311-312, 329 S.E.2d at 445-46.Â Â  \r\n Chastain \r\n  v. Chastain, 289 S.C. 281, 346 S.E.2d 33 (Ct. App. 1986), illustrates when \r\n  an award of exclusive use of the marital home is proper.Â  In Chastain, \r\n  the court granted the wife custody of the partiesâ€™ children, one of whom suffered \r\n  from Downâ€™s syndrome.Â  Wife additionally was given â€œexclusive use and possession \r\n  of the marital home . . . until either she marries or the partiesâ€™ mentally \r\n  retarded son dies[.]â€Â  Id. at 282, 346 S.E.2d at 34.Â  We concluded that, \r\n  under these facts, â€œspecial circumstances exist.â€Â  Id.Â  The boyâ€™s life \r\n  expectancy was between twenty and forty years, and the house was located in \r\n  a secluded neighborhood in which the boy was looked after by the neighbors.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we found no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s award.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  See also Harlan v. Harlan, 300 S.C. 537, 389 S.E.2d 165 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990) (upholding the family courtâ€™s award of the marital residence, as an incident \r\n  of support, to wife who was awarded custody of the partiesâ€™ four children on \r\n  the basis of need for adequate shelter, and providing that husband could petition \r\n  for modification after the two oldest children reached the age of majority).Â  \r\n\r\nGambrell v. Gambrell, \r\n  295 S.C. 457, 369 S.E.2d 662 (Ct. App. 1988), and Morris v. Morris, 335 \r\n  S.C. 525, 517 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 1999), are cases where awarding exclusive \r\n  use of the partiesâ€™ home was not appropriate because the requisite special circumstances \r\n  were not shown.Â  In Gambrell, the court of appeals, affirming the trial \r\n  court, declined to award wife exclusive possession of the partiesâ€™ residence \r\n  because she â€œestablished no compelling circumstances as to her needs when balanced \r\n  against the husbandâ€™s to warrant her receiving exclusive possession of the marital \r\n  home.â€Â  Id. at 462, 369 S.E.2d at 664 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nIn Morris, wife \r\n  appealed the family courtâ€™s decision not to award her exclusive use of the marital \r\n  home as an incident of support.Â  Affirming, we noted the only two assets of \r\n  significant value were the house and a retirement account.Â  Thus, awarding wife \r\n  with exclusive use of the residence would have left husband with â€œno liquid \r\n  assets with which to establish his new life, apart from the income he earns.â€Â  \r\n  Morris at 534, 517 S.E.2d at 725.Â  Moreover, we found that after considering \r\n  the alimony and child support wife would be receiving, along with an anticipated \r\n  increase in her earning potential, it would be possible for wife to purchase \r\n  husbandâ€™s equity and thereby keep the house.Â  Id. at 534-35, 517 S.E.2d \r\n  at 725.Â  Consequently, we affirmed the family courtâ€™s decision not to award \r\n  exclusive use of the home to wife.Â  Id.\r\nSeparate and \r\n  distinct from cases where possession of the marital home is awarded as incident \r\n  to support are cases where the residence is given to one party as part of his \r\n  or her equitable share of the entire marital estate.Â  \r\nIn Donahue v. Donahue, \r\n  299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989), â€œthe [trial] judge awarded the wife title \r\n  to the marital home, specifically allowing that this would serve as part of \r\n  her equitable distribution award.â€Â  Id. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745.Â  Husband \r\n  appealed, arguing the court could not award her title to the house as part of \r\n  the equitable distribution.Â  Our supreme court held, â€œAppellant incorrectly \r\n  contends that this was error and that title to a marital home can only be awarded \r\n  as an incident of support, and then only if compelling circumstances exits.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\nIn order to effect an equitable apportionment, the family court may require \r\n  the sale of marital property and a division of the proceeds.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-476 (Supp. 1987).Â  The court should first attempt an â€œin-kindâ€ distribution \r\n  of the assets.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d \r\n  901, 903 (1988).Â  A family court may grant a spouse title to the marital home \r\n  as part of the equitable distribution.Â  Brown v. Brown, 279 S.C. 116, \r\n  302 S.E.2d 860 (1983).Â  \r\nHere, the wife received the marital home as her share of the total marital estate, \r\n  not as an incident of support.Â  Part of the reason she was awarded the home \r\n  was to compensate her for the $23,000 she was entitled to as a result of contributions \r\n  to the husbandâ€™s dental practice.Â  Since we have ruled above that she was not \r\n  entitled to this $23,000, as it was based only on goodwill, we must also remand \r\n  the award of the marital home for reconsideration.Â  Accordingly, while the husband \r\n  is incorrect in arguing that the court could not award the wife title, we must \r\n  nonetheless remand because of our decision on the goodwill issue.\r\n\r\nId. at 360-61, \r\n  384 S.E.2d at 745.Â Â  \r\n Craig v. \r\n  Craig, 358 S.C. 548, 595 S.E.2d 837 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted \r\n  (Aug. 23, 2004) is our most recent proclamation on the award of a residence \r\n  as part of the equitable distribution of the marital estate.Â  In Craig, \r\n  the family court did not award wife the marital home; instead, it required her \r\n  to either buy out her Husbandâ€™s share of the equity, or sell the residence.Â  \r\n  Relying on Donahue, we disagreed and awarded the home to the wife as \r\n  part of her division of the marital estate.Â  We noted that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  20-7-472 (Supp. 2003) provides that the court, in making apportionment, â€œâ€˜must \r\n  give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following \r\n  factors . . . (10) the desirability of awarding the family home as part of equitable \r\n  distribution.â€™â€Â  358 S.C. at 558, 595 S.E.2d at 842.Â  Ultimately, we determined \r\n  it was â€œnot equitable for the home to be sold and Wife required to move from \r\n  the marital home.â€Â  Id.Â  The parties had a marital estate valued at approximately \r\n  $2,450,000.Â  We redistributed the assets of the estate to give the wife the \r\n  marital home while maintaining the apportionment of 50% of the estate to each \r\n  party as ordered by the family court.Â  Id. at 558-58, 595 S.E.2d at 843.\r\nAn award of \r\n  exclusive use of the marital home as incident of support must be supported by \r\n  compelling circumstances, which include the need for adequate shelter for minors, \r\n  the necessity of suitable housing for a handicapped spouse, and a spouseâ€™s inability \r\n  to otherwise obtain accommodations.Â  The policy behind this requirement that \r\n  specific, compelling circumstances be shown is sound.Â  By awarding possession \r\n  of the residence as an incident of support, the court leaves intact one of the \r\n  cords of marriage.Â  Often, the partiesâ€™ marital home will be their most valuable \r\n  asset.Â  The parties will be in a better position to begin new lives if the ligature \r\n  of joint ownership of the home is severed; both parties will have their share \r\n  of the equity, and they will not get entangled over such things as maintaining \r\n  and eventually selling the house.Â  However, these policy reasons are not so \r\n  compelling to preclude an award of exclusive possession in the narrow circumstances \r\n  outlined in Johnson.Â  Thus, the need for adequate housingâ€”especially \r\n  where children are involvedâ€”may outweigh the partiesâ€™ interests in settling \r\n  their affairs and obtaining their portion of equity in the home.Â  In these situations, \r\n  an award of exclusive use of the house may be appropriate.\r\nContrastively, \r\n  the disposition of the residence in the context of equitable distribution of \r\n  the marital estate is largely within the discretion of the family court.Â  Although \r\n  the court is generally required to attempt an in-kind distribution of assets, \r\n  an in-kind distribution of the marital home is not feasible.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  court may either award the home to one of the parties, or order the home sold \r\n  and the proceeds distributed.Â  Because the courtâ€™s apportionment determines \r\n  the ultimate share of the estate each party will receive, whether the house \r\n  is awarded to one party or is sold has no effect on the value of the property \r\n  allocated to each spouse.Â  Consequently, the policy reasons supporting the hurdles \r\n  set forth in Johnson are not present when the residence is awarded to \r\n  one party as part of his or her equitable share of the estate.Â  Equity is unaffectedâ€”the \r\n  party either gets the house or the value of his or her share of the equityâ€”and \r\n  the â€œdisputes and irritants do not linger,â€ because disposition of the home \r\n  is final.Â  See Johnson, 285 S.C. at 311, 329 S.E.2d at 445 (â€œIf \r\n  possible, all issues between the parties should be resolved . . . so that disputes \r\n  and irritants do not linger and present further incentives to litigation.â€).\r\nWe hold the \r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Father the home as part \r\n  of his equitable distribution of the estate.Â  First, we reject Motherâ€™s contention \r\n  that the award to Father delays her realization of equity in the house, thereby \r\n  imposing a burden upon her.Â  Motherâ€™s 40% interest in the equity was recognized \r\n  and accounted for in the family courtâ€™s distribution of the assets.Â  Of the \r\n  $83,609 estate, Mother was awarded cash and property valued at $33,443, or 40% \r\n  of the estate.Â  She has been awarded her share of the equity in the marital \r\n  residence.Â  \r\nFurthermore, \r\n  Motherâ€™s citations to Johnson and Morris are inapplicable as those \r\n  cases address awards of exclusive use of the marital home as incident of support.Â  \r\n  Father was not awarded use of the residence as incident of support; he was awarded \r\n  title to the house as part of his share of the marital estate.Â  Donahue \r\n  and Craig control, and those cases establish that a judge may award the \r\n  marital home as part of the distribution of the estate.Â  \r\nFinally, we \r\n  reject Motherâ€™s assertion that she should have been given use of the home as \r\n  an incident of support.Â  The compelling circumstances involving shelter for \r\n  children do not apply because Mother was not awarded custody of the children.Â  \r\n  Similarly, we do not find that Mother is handicapped, or is otherwise unable \r\n  to find suitable housing.Â  At the time of the hearing she resided in an apartment, \r\n  and her then-monthly income of $702 is now being supplemented by the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of $1,300 per month in alimony to her.Â  She has not made a sufficient \r\n  showing to justify an award of use of the house as an incident of support.Â  \r\n\r\nV.Â  Award of Personal \r\n  Property\r\nMother \r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to award her separate personal property.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  Mother did not offer a marital asset addendum or other evidence \r\n  concerning the identity or value of the personal household property she now \r\n  claims.Â  The family court evenly apportioned the household furnishings and granted \r\n  Mother the full amount of her jewelry.Â  We can find no abuse of discretion requiring \r\n  an alteration of this award.\r\nVI. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nLastly, Mother alleges the family court erred in failing to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is at the sound discretion of the family court.Â  \r\n  See Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988).Â  \r\n  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: \r\n  (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained \r\n  by counsel; (3) the respective financial conditions of the parties; and (4) \r\n  the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., \r\n  307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992); Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Our supreme court has identified the following \r\n  factors for determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee: (1) the nature, extent, \r\n  and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) \r\n  professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial \r\n  results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991). \r\nIn this matter, both \r\n  parties succeeded on some aspects of their respective claims.Â  Father received \r\n  custody and sole financial responsibility for the support of the three minor \r\n  children.Â  Further, the partiesâ€™ fiscal situations are comparable.Â  After factoring \r\n  in Fatherâ€™s alimony obligation, both partiesâ€™ monthly expenses outweigh their \r\n  monthly income.Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in deciding each party would bear his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\n  As a result, we affirm the courtâ€™s determination.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the \r\n  guardian in the instant case conducted a fair and unbiased investigation, and \r\n  we affirm the family courtâ€™s award of custody.Â  Further, we find no abuse of \r\n  discretion in the allocation of responsibility for the GALâ€™s fees.Â  We approve \r\n  the family courtâ€™s order in regard to equitable distribution of the marital \r\n  property and the award of the residence to Father as part of his share of the \r\n  estate.Â  The court adequately allocated the partiesâ€™ personal property and properly \r\n  denied attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3933","title":"State v.

Pope, of York, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Bernard Crawford (Appellant) was convicted of criminal \r\n  conspiracy and sentenced to five years in prison.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial \r\n  judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the night of August 20, 2002, John Crawford (John) awoke \r\n  his son, Jonathan Crawford (Jonathan), and demanded Jonathan take him to get \r\n  something to eat.Â  John is Appellantâ€™s brother, and Jonathan is Johnâ€™s son, \r\n  Appellantâ€™s nephew.Â  Jonathan testified at Appellantâ€™s trial that his father \r\n  was drunk and irate.Â  Jonathan acquiesced, and on their way to a fast-food restaurant, \r\n  John and Jonathan picked up Appellant, who had been walking along the side of \r\n  the road.Â  According to Jonathanâ€™s testimony, the three of them proceeded to \r\n  a fast-food restaurant.Â  John then directed Jonathan to drive to an apartment \r\n  complex, but suddenly demanded that Jonathan stop the vehicle so he could urinate \r\n  behind a building.Â  Jonathan stopped the car at Sunbelt Rentals.Â  Shortly after \r\n  John exited the vehicle, Jonathan heard glass break from the direction of Sunbelt \r\n  Rentals.Â  \r\nIn his statement to police, Jonathan averred Appellant exited the vehicle upon \r\n  hearing the glass break.Â  He saw John and Appellant carrying stolen saws from \r\n  the store to the car.Â  According to his sworn statement, John and Appellant \r\n  loaded the saws into the car and demanded Jonathan drive away.Â  \r\nOfficer Jenkins witnessed the vehicle, with its headlights off, pulling out \r\n  of the parking lot of Sunbelt Rentals.Â  The officer, who had been traveling \r\n  in the opposite direction of the Crawfords, turned around to follow Jonathanâ€™s \r\n  vehicle.Â  Jonathan sped up, and the officer activated his blue lights.Â  Officer \r\n  Jenkins testified that it appeared as though objects were being thrown out of \r\n  the sunroof.Â  In his statement, Jonathan claimed that upon seeing the police \r\n  car, Appellant handed John the saws from the backseat, and John threw the saws \r\n  out of the vehicleâ€™s passenger side window.Â  Appellant ran from police once \r\n  the vehicle was stopped.Â  Bolt cutters, gloves, and newly purchased flashlights \r\n  were found in the vehicle.Â  \r\nThe police charged Jonathan, John, and Appellant with conspiracy, \r\n  burglary, and grand larceny.Â  All charges against Jonathan subsequently were \r\n  dropped.Â  John pled guilty to all the charges and was sentenced to a total of \r\n  fifteen years in prison.Â  At Appellantâ€™s trial, John claimed full responsibility \r\n  for the crimes: â€œ[n]either one of them . . . had really anything to do with \r\n  it. . . . [I]f he would have helped me or somebody would have helped me, I wouldnâ€™t \r\n  have gotten caught.â€Â  According to John, neither Jonathan nor Appellant knew \r\n  his intention to break into Sunbelt Rentals.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nJonathanâ€™s trial testimony differs substantially from the statement \r\n  he gave to police.Â  In court, Jonathan proclaimed:Â  â€œ. . . I donâ€™tÂ  know if \r\n  Bernard Crawford got out of the car between the time that he ran in the building \r\n  and came back.â€ He stated further: â€œI had tunnel vision.Â  I didnâ€™t look around \r\n  and look back.Â  I didnâ€™t see anything â€˜til my father put the saws in the back \r\n  seat and jumped in the front seat and said, â€˜Letâ€™s go.â€™â€Â  Jonathan testified \r\n  that John slapped him and may have slapped at Appellant as well.Â  John yelled \r\n  at them both demanding they obey his orders.Â  Jonathan remembered Appellant \r\n  telling John: â€œyou basically just got us in trouble, you know, for your stupidity.â€Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the State rested its case, Appellant moved for a directed verdict as to \r\n  all charges.Â  The trial court denied the motion, concluding that substantial \r\n  evidence was extant in the record from which the jury could infer that the State \r\n  had proven the elements of each of the offenses, focusing particularly on Jonathanâ€™s \r\n  previous statement to police about Appellantâ€™s involvement.Â  The jury found \r\n  Appellant guilty of criminal conspiracy and acquitted him of the remaining charges.Â  \r\n  The trial court sentenced Appellant to five years in prison.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate \r\n  court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State \r\n  v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Al-Amin, \r\n  353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Morgan, \r\n  352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When ruling on a motion for a \r\n  directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence \r\n  of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Cherry, Op. No. 25902 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. filed Nov. 29, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 46 at 28); State v. Wilds, \r\n  355 S.C. 269, 584 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. McLauren, \r\n  349 S.C. 488, 563 S.E.2d 346 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If there is any direct evidence \r\n  or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt \r\n  of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly submitted to the \r\n  jury.Â  State v. Rosemond, 356 S.C. 426, 589 S.E.2d 757 (2003); \r\n  State v. Lindsey, 355 S.C. 15, 583 S.E.2d 740 (2003); see also \r\n  State v. Ballington, 346 S.C. 262, 551 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (stating judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any \r\n  direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove \r\n  accusedâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced). \r\n  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State \r\n  fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, \r\n  352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); State v. McCluney, 357 S.C. \r\n  560, 593 S.E.2d 509 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. \r\n  268, 580 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The appellate court may reverse the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence \r\n  to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, \r\n  555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  \r\n \r\n  LAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant claims the trial court erred in denying \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to introduce substantial \r\n  evidence he was guilty of conspiracy.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Prior Inconsistent Statement as Substantive Evidence\r\nState v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982), established that \r\n  testimony of prior inconsistent statements may be used as â€œsubstantive evidence \r\n  when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross examination.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 581, 300 S.E.2d at 69; accord State v. Smith, 309 \r\n  S.C. 442, 424 S.E.2d 496 (1992); State v. Ferguson, 300 S.C. 408, 388 \r\n  S.E.2d 642 (1990); State v. Caulder, 287 S.C. 507, 339 S.E.2d 876 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986).Â  In this case, Jonathan gave a statement to police following his \r\n  arrest asserting that Appellant participated in the grand larceny and burglary.Â  \r\n  However, at trial Jonathan testified that he was unsure whether Appellant exited \r\n  the vehicle, and that Appellant objected to Johnâ€™s actions once John was back \r\n  in the car.Â  The contradiction between Jonathanâ€™s sworn statement to police \r\n  and his later testimony in court is a matter of weight for the jury to decide.Â  \r\n  Copeland at 582, 300 S.E.2d at 69.Â  The later testimony does not obviate \r\n  the efficacy of the first statement made closer in time to the event in question.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nII.Â  Flight Evidence\r\nOnce Jonathan stopped the car, Officer Jenkins instructed John, Jonathan, and \r\n  Appellant to remain in the vehicle until backup arrived.Â  With another officer \r\n  present, Officer Jenkins had each individual step out of the car, one at a time.Â  \r\n  He provided the following description of the arrests:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         The last person I pulled out was Bernard, which was the subject seated \r\n  in the passenger side rear.Â  I had him exit and also patted him down for weapons.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         All right.Â  And at that point what happened?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         As soon as I began patting Bernard down for weapons, he jerked away \r\n  from me and took off running down Ebenezer.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a short chase, \r\n  Officer Jenkins returned to John and Jonathan to place them under arrest.Â  Additional \r\n  law enforcement personnel soon arrived and Officer Jenkins resumed the search \r\n  for Appellant.Â  He explained:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         . . . [W]e got a call of a subject around some apartments on Ebenezer \r\n  Avenue . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        At that time, I did proceed to that area and I did locate Bernard Crawford hiding \r\n  in the bushes in the front.Â  It was myself and an officer from Winthrop.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         All right.Â  And at that time were you able to apprehend him?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         No, I was not.Â  I ordered him out from the bushes.Â  At that time I was \r\n  at the rear of the bushes.Â  He exited out through the front of the bushes, ran \r\n  and jumped over another fence and continued on.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nEventually, Appellant was apprehended. \r\nâ€œFlight from prosecution is admissible as evidence of guilt.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 413, 578 S.E.2d 32, 36-37 (Ct. App. 2003); \r\n  see also State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 200, \r\n  470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (stating flight is â€œat least some evidenceâ€ of defendant's \r\n  guilt); State v. Freely, 105 S.C. 243, 89 S.E. 643 (1916) (declaring \r\n  the flight of one charged with crime has always been held to be some evidence \r\n  tending to prove guilt).Â  Evidence of flight has been held to constitute evidence \r\n  of defendant's guilty knowledge and intent.Â  See State v. Beckham, \r\n  334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); Town of Hartsville v. Munger, \r\n  93 S.C. 527, 77 S.E. 219 (1913); State v. Brownlee, 318 S.C. 34, \r\n  455 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 1995); see also State v. Thompson, \r\n  278 S.C. 1, 292 S.E.2d 581 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State \r\n  v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (finding evidence \r\n  of flight admissible to show guilty knowledge, intent, and that defendant sought \r\n  to avoid apprehension); State v. Grant, 275 S.C. 404, 407, 272 \r\n  S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (â€œ[A]ttempts to run away have always been regarded as \r\n  some evidence of guilty knowledge and intent.â€) (internal quotation marks omitted); \r\n  State v. Davis, 354 S.C. 348, 580 S.E.2d 778 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting \r\n  that circumstances of defendantâ€™s flight from police after they attempted traffic \r\n  stop allowed reasonable inference of guilty conduct). Flight, when unexplained, \r\n  is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not to be supposed \r\n  that one who is innocent and conscious of that fact would flee.Â  See \r\n  State v. Williams, 350 S.C. 172, 564 S.E.2d 688 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002) (citing 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 532 (1994)).\r\nThe critical factor to the admissibility of evidence of flight is \r\n  whether the totality of the evidence creates an inference that the defendant \r\n  had knowledge that he was being sought by the authorities.Â  Beckham, \r\n  334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d at 612. It is sufficient that circumstances justify \r\n  an inference that the accusedâ€™s actions were motivated as a result of his belief \r\n  that police officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking him for that \r\n  purpose. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, \r\n  319 A.2d 142 (1974)).Â  Flight or evasion of arrest is a circumstance to go to \r\n  the jury.Â  See Beckham, 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d \r\n  at 612; State v. Turnage, 107 S.C. 478, 93 S.E. 182 (1917); see \r\n  also State v. Byers, 277 S.C. 176, 284 S.E.2d 360 (1981) \r\n  (recognizing that evidence of flight is proper and that it is oftentimes appropriate \r\n  for counsel to argue to the jury the inferences growing out of flight); Grant, \r\n  275 S.C. at 408, 272 S.E.2d at 171 (stating that while a jury charge on flight \r\n  as evidence of guilt is improper, admission of evidence and argument by counsel \r\n  concerning it are allowed).\r\nTestimony established that Appellant fled the scene when police attempted \r\n  to arrest him.Â  In South Carolina, Appellantâ€™s flight constitutes evidence of \r\n  his guilt.\r\nIII.Â  Criminal Conspiracy\r\nCriminal conspiracy is statutorily defined as â€œa combination between two or \r\n  more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or a lawful \r\n  object by unlawful means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003); accord \r\n  State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 588 S.E.2d 105 (2003); State v. Follin, \r\n  352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002) cert. denied, State v. \r\n  Horne, 324 S.C. 372, 478 S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. 1996); cf. LaMotte \r\n  v. Punch Line of Columbia, 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711 (1988) (comparing \r\n  civil conspiracy, which is a combination of two or more persons joining for \r\n  the purpose of injuring plaintiff and causing special damage to plaintiff, with \r\n  criminal conspiracy). \r\nThis statutory pronouncement is declaratory of the common law definition of \r\n  conspiracy.Â  See State v. Fleming, 243 S.C. 265, 133 S.E.2d 800 \r\n  (1963) (observing the predecessor to Â§ 16-17-410 was declaratory of the common \r\n  law definition).Â  The crime of conspiracy has long been recognized in this state.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., State v. De Witt, 20 S.C.L. (2 Hill) 282 (1834) (affirming \r\n  conspiracy as a viable common law offense and discussing the breadth of its \r\n  applicability). \r\nHistorically, conspiracy was a misdemeanor.Â  See State v. Ferguson,Â  \r\n  221 S.C. 300, 306, 70 S.E.2d 355, 358 (1952) (â€œConspiracy is a common-law offense \r\n  and is a misdemeanor.â€).Â  Currently, conspiracy is a felony and carries a maximum \r\n  sentence of $5,000 or five years imprisonment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003).Â  \r\n  â€œA person who is convicted of the crime of conspiracy must not be given a greater \r\n  fine or sentence than he would receive if he carried out the unlawful act contemplated \r\n  by the conspiracy and had been convicted of the unlawful act contemplated by \r\n  the conspiracy . . . .â€Â  Id.&nbsp; \r\nThe gravamen of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement, or combination.Â  \r\n  State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 454, 298 S.E.2d 215 (1982); see also \r\n  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001) (â€œThe \r\n  essence of a conspiracy is the agreement.â€).Â  â€œIn criminal conspiracy it is \r\n  not necessary to prove an overt act.Â  The gist of the crime is the unlawful \r\n  combination.Â  The crime is then complete, even though nothing further is done.â€Â  \r\n  Ferguson at 303, 70 S.E.2d at 356 (citing State v. Ameker, 73 \r\n  S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906)).Â Â  \r\nA formal or express agreement need not be established.Â  Horne at 381, \r\n  478 S.E.2d at 293.Â  â€œA tacit, mutual understanding, resulting in the willful \r\n  and intentional adoption of a common design by two or more persons is sufficient, \r\n  provided the common purpose is to do an unlawful act either as a means or an \r\n  end.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  Professor McAninch explains: â€œThe mere \r\n  fact that two persons happened to be doing the same thing at the same time does \r\n  not compel the conclusion that there was a conspiracy.â€Â  William Shepard McAninch \r\n  &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina, 476 (4th \r\n  ed. 2002).Â  In State v. Ameker, 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906), our \r\n  supreme court placed its approbation on the following explanation of conspiracy \r\n  given by the trial judge:\r\n\r\nâ€œ[S]uppose, Mr. Foreman, \r\n  that you and the gentleman on your left would go out in the streets of Orangeburg \r\n  and commit an assault and battery on some other person, that would be an unlawful \r\n  act, but it would not be a conspiracy, unless there was an agreement between \r\n  you to do the act before doing it.Â  It is an agreement to do an unlawful \r\n  act that is the gist of the whole matter.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 339, 53 S.E. at 487.Â  \r\nIn State v. Mouzon, 321 S.C. 27, 467 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 1995), the \r\n  defendant appealed his conviction for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.Â  \r\n  One witness testified that on the night in question, several individuals, including \r\n  the defendant, were present where drug transactions were taking place.Â  Id. \r\n  at 32, 467 S.E.2d at 125.Â Â  We reversed the conviction, holding: \r\n\r\n[T]o prove conspiracy, it is not enough that a group of people separately intend \r\n  to distribute drugs in a single area, nor enough that their activities occasionally \r\n  or sporadically place them in contact with each other. What is needed is proof \r\n  they intended to act together for their shared mutual benefit \r\n  within the scope of the conspiracy charged.\r\n\r\nId. at 32-33, 467 S.E.2d at 125 (internal quotation marks and citation \r\n  omitted); see also State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 \r\n  (1993) (holding it is not enough for the offense of conspiracy that a group \r\n  of people separately intend to distribute drugs in a single area, nor that their \r\n  activities occasionally or sporadically place them in contact with each other). \r\n\r\nBecause it takes at least two persons to enter into an agreement, \r\n  there must be at least two members of a conspiracy.Â  See State v. \r\n  Jackson, 7 S.C. (7 Rich.) 283 (1876).Â  â€œYet they need not all be indicted \r\n  or named.Â  Indeed, an indictment charging that the named defendant and â€˜other \r\n  persons unknown . . . did . . . conspireâ€™ was approved in State v. Hightower, \r\n  221 S.C. 91, 94, 69, S.E.2d 363, 366 (1952)[.]â€Â  McAninch &amp; Fairey 481. \r\n  In Hightower, there was â€œample evidence that the conspirators, though \r\n  unknown, did exist.â€Â  McAninch &amp; Fairey 481.Â  \r\nA conspiracy to commit a crime does not merge with the completed \r\n  offense.Â  State v. Rutledge, 232 S.C. 223, 101 S.E.2d 289 (1957); see \r\n  also Ferguson at 303-04, 70 S.E.2d at 356-57 (observing that a conspiracy \r\n  does not merge with a completed crime, â€œbut is a distinct offense in itself \r\n  and punishable as such, notwithstanding that the object of the conspiracy has \r\n  been accomplished).Â  \r\n State v. Wells, 249 S.C. 249, 153 S.E.2d 904 (1967) recognized \r\n  the existence of Whartonâ€™s Rule in South Carolina, but denied its application \r\n  under the facts of Wells.Â  Whartonâ€™s Rule states that where \r\n\r\nco-operation or \r\n  concert between two or more persons is essential to the commission of a substantive \r\n  crime and there is no ingredient of an alleged conspiracy that is not present \r\n  in the substantive crime, it is held that the persons necessarily involved cannot \r\n  be charged with conspiracy to commit the substantive offense and also with the \r\n  substantive crime itself.\r\n\r\nId. at 256, 153 S.E.2d at 907-08; see also Ferguson at \r\n  303, 70 S.E.2d at 356 (â€œIt is true that in some cases where concerted action \r\n  is necessary, as for example in certain sexual offenses, it is not permitted \r\n  to charge one in the same indictment with a conspiracy and also with the substantive \r\n  crime.â€).Â  Thus, \r\n\r\nif the substantive offense requires by definition the concerted \r\n  action of two persons, as for example the crime of adultery, then those persons \r\n  cannot be convicted of conspiracy to commit the offense because this would merely \r\n  be a subterfuge to increase the legislatively authorized punishment for the \r\n  substantive offense.Â  \r\n\r\nMcAninch &amp; Fairey 482.\r\nOnce an agreement has been reached, the crime of \r\n  conspiracy has been committed; no further act need take place.Â  â€œConspiracy \r\n  is an inchoate offense, and is a crime in and of itself.â€ Â 15A C.J.S. Conspiracy \r\n  Â§ 98 (2002) (footnotes omitted); see Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1108 \r\n  (7th ed. 1999) (defining â€œinchoate offenseâ€ as â€œ[a] step toward the commission \r\n  of another crime, the step in itself being serious enough to merit punishment.â€).Â  \r\n  â€œProhibition of conspiracy serves two distinct purposes: the punishment of group \r\n  behavior and the control of inchoate activities.â€Â  15A C.J.S. Conspiracy \r\n  Â§ 98.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe basis of conspiratorial liability is not to punish the \r\n  agreement per se, but, rather, like other inchoate crimes, to punish the firm \r\n  purpose to commit a substantive crime, while hopefully preventing the actual \r\n  commission thereof.\r\n\r\nId.; see also McAninch &amp; Fairey 474 (â€œThe \r\n  basic rationale of conspiracy seems to be that the combination of two or more \r\n  persons makes it more likely that the criminal objective will be achieved, because \r\n  the co-conspirators may offer each other encouragement and support, thereby \r\n  rendering it less likely that the project will be abandoned.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nâ€œIt need not be shown that either the object or the means agreed upon is an \r\n  indictable offense in order to establish a criminal conspiracy.Â  It is sufficient \r\n  if the one or the other is unlawful.â€Â  Fleming at 274, 133 S.E.2d at \r\n  805.Â  Ameker demonstrates the breadth of activity that can give rise \r\n  to an indictment for conspiracy.Â  73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906).Â  In \r\n  Ameker, the defendant was convicted of â€œunlawfully, feloniously, and \r\n  willfully conspir[ing] . . . for the purpose of hindering, preventing, and obstructing \r\n  certain citizens . . . [who were] engaging in social intercourse and peaceable \r\n  pastimes, such as are commonly enjoyed at picnics. . .â€Â  Id. at 332-33, \r\n  53 S.C. at 484-85.Â  The action arose when a group of picnickers was disturbed \r\n  by the defendant and several co-conspirators. Â â€œAbe Ameker began playing his \r\n  banjo, while Cleveland Hooker danced and cursed. . . . One of the defendants \r\n  had a paddle in his hand, and the inevitable pistol was also in hand.â€ Id. \r\n  at 337, 53 S.E. at 486.Â  One man was struck with the boat paddle, and knives \r\n  and guns were drawn before the engagement subsided.Â  Id.Â  The court upheld \r\n  Amekerâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\nOur supreme court, in State v. Amerson, noted that â€œa single conspiracy \r\n  may be established by completely different aggregations of proof so that there \r\n  appears to be several conspiracies.â€Â  311 S.C. at 319, 428 S.E.2d at 873 (1993) \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  Consequently, â€œa multi-pronged flexible â€˜totality of the \r\n  circumstancesâ€™ test is applied to determine whether there were two conspiracies \r\n  or merely one.â€Â  Id.Â  The test considers:\r\n\r\n(1) the time periods covered by the alleged conspiracies; (2) the places where \r\n  the conspiracies are alleged to have occurred; (3) the persons charged as conspirators; \r\n  (4) the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the conspiracies, \r\n  or any other descriptions of offenses charged which indicate the nature and \r\n  scope of the activities being prosecuted; and (5) the substantive statutes alleged \r\n  to have been violated.\r\n\r\nId.Â Â  \r\nOnce a conspiracy has been established, evidence establishing beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt the connection of a defendant to the conspiracy, even though the connection \r\n  is slight, is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.Â  \r\n  Horne, 324 S.C. at 382, 478 S.E.2d at 294 (citing State v. Sullivan, \r\n  277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981)).Â  \r\nGenerally, the conspiracy is proven by overt acts committed in furtherance \r\n  of the conspiracy.Â  Amerson, 311 S.C. at 319-20, 428 S.E.2d at 873.Â  \r\n  However, overt acts are not necessary for a conspiracy conviction.Â  â€œIt is axiomatic \r\n  that a conspiracy may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence or by circumstantial \r\n  evidence alone.â€Â  Horne, 324 S.C. at 381, 478 S.E.2d at 294 (citing State \r\n  v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d 839 (1989)).Â  Indeed, State v. Miller, \r\n  223 S.C. 128, 74 S.E.2d 582 (1953), notes: â€œOften proof of conspiracy is necessarily \r\n  by circumstantial evidence alone.â€Â  Id. at 133, 74 S.E.2d at 585 (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  Because the actus reus of conspiracy is the agreement, the evidence \r\n  must prove the agreement, not the object thereof.Â  McAninch observes, â€œThe agreement \r\n  might be difficult to establish by direct evidence if none of the co-conspirators \r\n  will talk.Â  Consequently, the cases in this jurisdiction, as well as others, \r\n  which hold that the agreement can be established by circumstantial evidence \r\n  are legion.â€Â  McAninch &amp; Fairey 476 (citations omitted).Â  The State â€œis \r\n  permitted great latitude in the introduction of circumstantial evidence to establish \r\n  the existence of a conspiratorial agreement.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. \r\n  289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1993).Â  \r\nState v. Oliver, 275 S.C. 79, 267 S.E.2d 529 (1980), exemplifies the \r\n  sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to convict on conspiracy.Â  Oliver was \r\n  indicted along with two other individuals for conspiracy to commit housebreaking \r\n  and grand larceny.Â  Id. at 79, 267 S.E.2d at 530.Â  The defendants were \r\n  accused and convicted of breaking into two houses.Â  Upon conviction, Oliver \r\n  appealed, asserting the evidence was insufficient and his motion for a directed \r\n  verdict should have been granted.Â  Id. at 79-80, 267 S.E.2d at 530.Â  \r\n  Evidence showed Oliverâ€™s codefendant, Willie Williams, rented a U-Haul truck \r\n  a few weeks before the crimes.Â  On the day of the break-ins, Williams purchased \r\n  gasoline in the U-Haul truck approximately forty or fifty miles from the crime \r\n  scene, and a receipt for the gas purchase was found near one of the houses.Â  \r\n  A neighbor of one of the homes observed the U-Haul parked in the neighborhood.Â  \r\n  A filling station attendant and the neighbor both testified to seeing three \r\n  men wearing dark clothes in the truck.Â  Similar shoe tracks were found at both \r\n  houses, â€œindicating that the same individuals entered both places.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 81, 267 S.E.2d at 531.Â  Finally, a law enforcement officer arrested the defendants \r\n  approximately three miles from the scene of one of the homes.Â  The defendants \r\n  were in the U-Haul truck and matched the descriptions given by the station attendant \r\n  and neighbor.Â  The court found this evidence â€œreasonably tended to establish \r\n  the guilt of appellants, and the trial judge properly denied their motions for \r\n  a directed verdict.â€Â  Id. at 82, 267 S.E.2d at 531.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no direct evidence that appellants and their \r\n  codefendant had a mutual understanding to commit housebreaking and larceny, \r\n  the facts and circumstances are susceptible to the reasonable inference that \r\n  they did in fact conspire to commit the unlawful acts.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 80, 267 S.E.2d at 530.Â  \r\nState v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998), involved the sufficiency \r\n  of evidence for a criminal conspiracy conviction.Â  The appellant, Kelsey, and \r\n  several other individuals spent the day of July 11, 1994, building pipe bombs.Â  \r\n  That night, they picked up the victim and took her to a party.Â  Several hours \r\n  later the defendants offered to take the victim home.Â  The court described the \r\n  events leading to the victimâ€™s death:\r\n\r\nDefendants and [victim] then got into Leeâ€™s car, ostensibly to take [victim] \r\n  home.Â  Lee was driving, Kelsey was in the passenger seat, and Payne and [the \r\n  victim] were in the backseat.Â  Although [the victim] had given them directions \r\n  to her house, Lee detoured in the opposite direction. . . . Lee turned around \r\n  and saw that Payne had [victim] in a â€œstrangle hold type position.â€Â  Lee continued \r\n  to drive.Â  A few minutes later, Lee â€œheard two quick, empty thud type sounds.â€ \r\n  . . . Kelsey testified that he had also turned around and saw that [victimâ€™s] \r\n  body was limp, her face was pale, and her lips were blue.\r\nLee once again drove away from the bridge.Â  He got approximately 100 feet down \r\n  the road when Payne told him to stop the car.Â  Defendants pulled [victim] out \r\n  of the car and carried her into the woods and up an embankment where they placed \r\n  her on the ground.Â  Lee returned to the car.Â  Payne and Kelsey remained by [victim]â€™s \r\n  body.\r\n\r\nKelsey testified that while he was standing over [victim]â€™s body, \r\n  Payne instructed him to place a pipe bomb into [victim]â€™sÂ  mouth.Â  Kelsey complied.Â  \r\n  Payne then lit the fuse, and the two ran.Â  A few seconds later, the bomb exploded.Â  \r\n  Defendants returned to Kirchner's house where they fell asleep.\r\nId. at 59-61, 502 S.E.2d 67-68.Â  \r\nThe court \r\n  upheld the conspiracy conviction under the following analysis:\r\n\r\nIn State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d 839 (1989), the defendant \r\n  argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict \r\n  on a conspiracy charge. We disagreed, finding that the following facts tended \r\n  to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt: evidence that defendant knew codefendant; defendant \r\n  was seen running from the area where the victimâ€™s body was found; bloodhounds \r\n  had tracked the victimâ€™s scent to the codefendantâ€™s house; and defendant had \r\n  given a written statement stating that he agreed to be a lookout for codefendant.\r\nIn this case, evidence indicated that Kelsey was instrumental in constructing \r\n  the pipe bombs at Kirchnerâ€™s house; that Kelsey was with Lee and Payne on the \r\n  night of the murder; that Kelsey helped Payne carry [victim] into the woods; \r\n  that Kelsey and Payne were alone together in the woods with [victim]â€™s body; \r\n  and that Kelsey placed the pipe bomb into [victim]â€™s mouth. We therefore find \r\n  the evidence was sufficient to submit the conspiracy charge to the jury.\r\n\r\nId. at 63-64, 502 S.E.2d at 70.\r\nIn State v. Follin, 352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. \r\n  denied, Follin was convicted of aiding and abetting embezzlement, obtaining \r\n  goods and services by false pretenses, and conspiracy.Â  One of her issues on \r\n  appeal was that her motion for a directed verdict should have been granted on \r\n  the conspiracy charge.Â  The facts underlying Follin involved â€œthe diversion \r\n  of nearly $2.5 million from Sumter County School District 17 (District 17) by \r\n  Adolph Joseph Klein, the Assistant Superintendent in charge of Financial Affairs \r\n  for District 17.â€Â  Id. at 240, 573 S.E.2d at 814.Â  Follin was a travel \r\n  agent and owner of Follin Travel who handled the travel arrangements for District \r\n  17.Â  From 1987 to 1997, Klein diverted nearly $1.5 million in personal travel \r\n  expenses for himself and his friends and family by booking luxury vacations \r\n  through Follin, which were paid for by District 17.Â  The Follin court \r\n  explained, \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Klein learned that if travel plans made one week were cancelled before \r\n  the Friday of that same week, no payment would be required on the trip, the \r\n  invoice would be voided, and the invoice number would no longer appear in Follin's \r\n  computerized accounting system.Â  He began using invoices to get District 17 \r\n  to pay for his junket travel.Â  Klein would request an invoice from Follin for \r\n  what appeared to be legitimate travel for a school group or a District 17 employee.Â  \r\n  Klein would then request that Follin void the invoice prior to the Friday of \r\n  that week. Follin would cancel the trip in her computer and stamp â€œvoidâ€ on \r\n  her copy of the invoice.Â  However, Klein submitted his clean copy of the invoice \r\n  to District 17 for payment.Â  Klein called these invoices â€œspecial invoicesâ€ \r\n  for the junket travel.Â  After the check was issued to Follin on the special \r\n  invoice, Klein would attach a note to the check identifying for Follin the invoice \r\n  number to which she should apply the check. The invoice number did not match \r\n  the number on the special invoice submitted to District 17 for payment but matched \r\n  the invoice number of another of Klein's junket trips.\r\n\r\nId. at 240-41, 573 S.E.2d at 814-15.Â  When District officials began \r\n  investigating Kleinâ€™s travel expenses, Follin attempted to cover up the scheme \r\n  by asserting the District had a refund credit.Â  \r\nWe found sufficient evidence to support the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict on criminal conspiracy:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, Klein would not \r\n  have been able to proceed with his travel scheme without Follinâ€™s assistance.Â  \r\n  Despite the fact that there was not a spoken agreement between the two to defraud \r\n  District 17, the uncontradicted evidence showed that Follin knowingly assisted \r\n  Klein by creating false records indicating District 17 had a credit.Â  Klein \r\n  testified that he and Follin conspired through their actions.Â  Although the \r\n  agreement was not written or verbalized, evidence was presented that an arrangement \r\n  was reached between Klein and Follin to defraud District 17.Â  Because there \r\n  was evidence that reasonably tended to prove Follin conspired with Klein, the \r\n  trial judge properly denied Follinâ€™s motion for a directed verdict as to this \r\n  charge. \r\n\r\nId. at 267, 573 S.E.2d at 829-30.Â  See also State v. Clark, \r\n  286 S.C. 432, 334 S.E.2d 121 (1985) (finding â€œample evidence . . . to support \r\n  appellantâ€™s conviction of conspiracyâ€ to housebreak where appellant was found \r\n  near the crime scene; was apprehended as he drove away with his headlights off; \r\n  originally denied knowing his codefendant, who was later determined to be his \r\n  cousin; and admitted his codefendant told him of the larceny plans, but denied \r\n  any participation in them). \r\nIn the instant case, sufficient evidence exists to support the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  Appellant was \r\n  in the vehicle immediately after the burglary was perpetrated, and he fled when \r\n  Jonathan stopped the car.Â  Jonathanâ€™s statement contradicts his trial testimony, \r\n  and it was the responsibility of the jury to weigh both his statement and his \r\n  testimony.Â  According to his statement, Jonathan witnessed Appellant (1) carrying \r\n  stolen saws from the store to the car; (2) loading saws into the car; and (3) \r\n  handing John the saws from the backseat.Â  Furthermore, the police found bolt \r\n  cutters, gloves, and flashlights in the vehicleâ€”items that could give rise to \r\n  an inference that John, Jonathan, and Appellant planned the burglary.Â  Additionally, \r\n  though Jonathan testified that they proceeded through the drive-through at the \r\n  restaurant rather than eating inside, the police did not find any trash from \r\n  the fast-food restaurant in the vehicle.Â  As in Oliver, although this \r\n  evidence does not constitute direct evidence of an agreement, the facts and \r\n  circumstances are susceptible to the reasonable inference that Appellant conspired \r\n  to commit the unlawful acts.Â  Ample evidence exists from which a jury could \r\n  infer either an express plan, or a tacit, mutual understanding to commit the \r\n  burglary.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is affirmed.\r\nIV.Â  Coercion/Duress\r\nIn State v. Robinson, 294 S.C. 120, 363 S.E.2d 104 (1987), \r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court explained the defense of coercion:\r\n\r\nTo excuse a criminal act, the degree of coercion must be present, imminent, \r\n  and of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious \r\n  bodily harm if the act is not done.Â  Coercion is no defense if there is any \r\n  reasonable way, other than committing the crime, to escape the threat of harm.Â  \r\n  The fear of injury must be reasonable.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 121-22, 363 S.E.2d at 104 (citations omitted).Â  Similarly, in \r\n  State v. Benjamin, 345 S.C. 470, 549 S.E.2d 258 (2001), our supreme court \r\n  provided the following definition of duress:\r\n\r\nTo establish duress which will excuse a criminal act, the degree \r\n  of coercion must be present, imminent, and of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded \r\n  apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act is not done.Â  Coercion \r\n  is no defense if there is any reasonable way, other than committing the crime, \r\n  to escape the threat of harm.Â  The fear of injury must be reasonable.\r\n\r\nId. at 474 n.3, 549 S.E.2d at 260 n.3. Â â€œCoercion and duress envision \r\n  a third person compelling another by threat of immediate physical violence to \r\n  commit a crime against someone else or someone elseâ€™s property.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Holliday, 333 S.C. 585, 588, 510 S.E.2d 436, 438 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nOur review of this record convinces us that the evidence in regard \r\n  to coercion and duress is de minimis.Â  Additionally, the issues of coercion \r\n  and duress were factual issues to be decided by the trial jury.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3934","title":"Dixon v.

Buyer acknowledges \r\n  the Seller, except as provided in subparagraphs (B)-(G) of this section, gives \r\n  no guarantee or warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, as to the physical \r\n  condition of the property or to the conditions of or existence of improvements, \r\n  services, appliances or system thereto, or as to merchantability or fitness \r\n  for a particular purpose as to the property or improvements thereof, and any \r\n  implied warranty is hereby disclaimed by the Seller. . . .Â  (D) Seller shall, \r\n  at their expense, have the property inspected and shall obtain a Wood Infestation \r\n  Report (CL100) from a licensed and bonded pest control operator that the residential \r\n  dwelling and attached garage is free and clear from termites, fungus, excess \r\n  moisture in the crawl space, wet or dry rot, and other wood destroying organisms. \r\n  . . . If any infestation or structural damage is found, Seller agrees to have \r\n  it corrected, at Sellerâ€™s expense.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter purchase, the Dixons \r\n  discovered substantial uncorrected termite damage.Â  Robert Dixon testified that \r\n  he and his brother first came upon the dilapidation while preparing to install \r\n  a new heat pump:\r\n\r\nI started to remove some \r\n  of the lapboard that was right there by the electrical panel box and thatâ€™s \r\n  when the electrical panel box fell down and just was dangling there by the wires \r\n  and thatâ€™s when I called my brother over there and said, â€œDavid, I think weâ€™ve \r\n  got a real problem here.â€Â  And we pulled off more of the boards and sure enough \r\n  as I suspected the electrical panel box was supposed to been . . . of course \r\n  it was supposed to been put into the studs and secured that way.Â  The studs \r\n  were completely termite riddled.Â  As we tore off more we realized that more \r\n  of it was done.Â  We got to the corner of the house on the back porch and then \r\n  we realized that the whole corner of the two . . . the two by fours there was \r\n  holding up the corner had completely been eaten away with termites and my brother \r\n  and I looked at each other and said what are we going to do now because it looks \r\n  like the roof is going to fall in.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Dixons found similar \r\n  damage to the floors and other areas of the house and responded by filing a \r\n  suit against Ford and the pest control company that issued the CL-100.Â  Summary \r\n  judgment was granted to the pest control company, leaving Ford as the sole defendant, \r\n  and fraud as the only remaining cause of action.Â  The case went to trial, and \r\n  the jury found in favor of Ford.Â  The Dixons filed post-trial motions for judgment \r\n  non obstante veredicto and alternatively for a new trial.Â  These motions were \r\n  based on the grounds that the court (1) gave an erroneous jury charge, and (2) \r\n  allowed irrelevant and prejudicial testimony into evidence.Â  Both motions were \r\n  denied, and the Dixons appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The Contested Jury Charge\r\nThe Dixons argue the court improperly charged the \r\n  jury that they had no right to rely on the wood infestation report supplied \r\n  at closing.Â  We agree.\r\n A.Â Â Â Â Â  Efficacy of the Charge\r\nAfter explaining the elements of fraud, the court \r\n  charged the jury: \r\n\r\nA fraudulent act is characterized \r\n  by dishonesty in fact, unfair dealing or unlawful appropriation of anotherâ€™s \r\n  property by design.Â  One cannot rely upon a misstatement of facts if the truth \r\n  is easily within the reach of another.Â  I would also tell you that a purchaser \r\n  of a home . . . an infested home has no right to rely on favorable answers on \r\n  the wood infestation report given the purchaser at the closing where the purchaser \r\n  elected to close or failed to comply with a recommendation on the report that \r\n  he investigate for structural damages.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen instructing the jury, the trial judge is \r\n  required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€Â  Cohens \r\n  v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1999); see \r\n  also Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 554-555, 481 S.E.2d 444, 448&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 1997) (â€œOrdinarily, a trial judge has a duty to give a requested instruction \r\n  that correctly states the law applicable to the issues and evidence.â€).Â  However, \r\n  when reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the appellate court must consider \r\n  the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  \r\n  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427&nbsp;(Ct. App. \r\n  2003).Â  If the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions which \r\n  might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  â€œTo warrant \r\n  reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have \r\n  not only been erroneous, but prejudicial as well.â€Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. \r\n  at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289; see also Daves at 224, 584 S.E.2d at \r\n  427 (stating a circuit courtâ€™s refusal to give a properly requested charge is \r\n  reversible error only where the requesting party can demonstrate prejudice from \r\n  the refusal).\r\nThe language charged by the \r\n  court came from Nine v. Henderson, 313 S.C. 309, 312-13, 437 S.E.2d 182, \r\n  184 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Specifically, the verbiage emanates from a parenthetical \r\n  explanation of Bostick v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., 806 F.2d 504 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1986).Â  The trial court, in the case sub judice, defended the \r\n  controverted charge, explaining: \r\n\r\nThe quote is directly from the case of Nine v. Henderson, \r\n  . . . with the exception that that dealt with powder post beetles which I thought \r\n  was a comment on the facts and I took that comment about powder post beetles \r\n  out of it and I also took that part out of that particular language that said \r\n  a South Carolina regulation because thereâ€™s no testimony in the record regarding \r\n  the South Carolina regulation.Â  But other than that that is a direct quote from \r\n  that case . . . . \r\n\r\nThe Nine courtâ€™s citation to Bostick, \r\n  and the sentence it supports, reads in full:\r\nWe also agree, however, with the trial court that Nine, under \r\n  the circumstances here, had no reasonable right to rely on Hendersonâ€™s \r\n  representations regarding the extent of termite damage to the building in question.Â  \r\n  See Bostick v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., 806 F.2d 504, 508-09 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1986) (construing South Carolina law and holding a purchaser of a \r\n  home infested by powder post beetles had no right to rely on favorable answers \r\n  on a wood infestation report given the purchaser at the closing where the purchaser \r\n  elected to close and failed to comply with a recommendation in the report and \r\n  a South Carolina regulation that he investigate for structural damage).\r\nNine, 313 S.C. at 312-13, 437 S.E.2d at 184 \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nA close reading of both Nine and Bostick \r\n  reveals that the charge given in the instant case is a misstatement of the applicable \r\n  law and should not have been charged.Â  In Nine, the dispositive question \r\n  on appeal related to whether Nine, the buyer of a house, had a right to rely \r\n  on the sellerâ€™s representation regarding termite infestation on the property \r\n  he was purchasing.Â  313 S.C. at 310, 437 S.E.2d at 183.Â  Nine â€œknew from the \r\n  very start the property had termite problems.â€Â  Id. at 313, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  at 184.Â  For example, during negotiations, the seller â€œdisclosed to Nine that \r\n  a termite inspection done the previous May revealed the presence of termites \r\n  in the eaves of the house and in the window sills and doors of the garage.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 311, 437 S.E.2d at 183.Â  Prior to closing, Nine rented and occupied \r\n  the house, and he â€œpersonally repaired the termite-damaged eaves on the side \r\n  of the house and repaired some additional damage that he discovered along the \r\n  front of the house.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Nine court explicated:\r\n\r\nAt the closing, which Nine attended accompanied by his attorney, \r\n  Henderson furnished Nine with three wood infestation reports.Â  These reports \r\n  were made the day after the parties signed the contract of sale by the same \r\n  termite inspector who made the May inspection.Â  They separately detailed inspections \r\n  that the termite inspector made of the three improvements located on the subject \r\n  property.Â  They also set forth the inspectorâ€™s conclusions regarding the presence \r\n  of termites and other wood-destroying insects in each of the buildings.\r\nThe report relating to the house expressly noted there had \r\n  been a previous infestation of termites and there was evidence of prior termite \r\n  treatment. . . . The report cautioned â€œ[t]here is possible hidden old termite \r\n  damage to the inside walls.â€Â  A graph attached to the report concerning the \r\n  house advised of â€œsubterranean termites,â€ â€œprobable hidden damage,â€ and â€œpossible \r\n  hidden termite damage in walls.â€\r\nThe report relating to the cottage also cautioned â€œ[t]here \r\n  is possible hidden termite damage behind the kitchen cabinets from previous \r\n  infestation and along [the] baseboard by window.â€Â  A graph attached to this \r\n  report advised of â€œsubterranean termites,â€ â€œprobable hidden damage,â€ and â€œprobable \r\n  hidden old termite damage behind [the] kitchen cabinets and baseboard.â€\r\nAll three reports counseled Nine:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          f there is evidence of active or past infestation of termites \r\n  . . . , it must be assumed that there is some damage to the building caused \r\n  by this infestation.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n           . . . .\r\n        \r\n        \r\n           . . . [Y]ou may wish to call a qualified \r\n  . . . expert in the building trade to ascertain their [sic] opinion as to whether \r\n  there is structural damage to this property.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 309, 437 S.E.2d at 183-84 (alterations \r\n  in original).\r\nBased on these facts, the court concluded: â€œBy choosing not to postpone the \r\n  closing and electing instead to proceed with it, [buyer] ignored, if not outright \r\n  rejected, advice to have a qualified person ascertain whether the improvements \r\n  on the property had sustained structural damage. . . .â€Â  Nine at 313, \r\n  437 S.E.2d at 184.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nIn Bostick, an extermination company prepared \r\n  a wood infestation report stating there were â€œvisible damaged structural membersâ€ \r\n  caused by a beetle infestation, but that there was â€œno visible structural damage.â€Â  \r\n  Bostick, 806 F.2d at 505.Â  Subsequently, the home purchaser discovered \r\n  extensive structural damage and filed suit against the extermination company.Â  \r\n  Yet, disclaimers on the report stated structure that was not visible or accessible \r\n  was not inspected.Â  Id. at 506.Â  Additionally, the court observed South \r\n  Carolina regulations governing wood infestation reports provide that a report \r\n  â€œcannot be viewed as a structural damage report.â€Â  Id. at 507 (quoting \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Reg. Â§ 27-1085(k)).Â  The regulation reads, â€œIf visual evidence \r\n  of wood-destroying organisms or damage is noted in this report, further investigation \r\n  for structural damage by qualified building experts is recommended.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The court found that Bostickâ€™s case was built upon the cornerstone that he had \r\n  relied on the report as a record of structural damage.Â  Id. at 508-09.Â  \r\n  This was impermissible under the regulations, and, therefore, his fraud action \r\n  failed.Â  Id.  \r\nThe charge, â€œ[A purchaser of] an infested home \r\n  has no right to rely on favorable answers on the wood infestation report given \r\n  the purchaser at the closing where the purchaser elected to close,â€ is an inaccurate \r\n  statement of South Carolina law.Â  Nine held that under the circumstances \r\n  presented in that case the buyer had no right to rely and cited Bostickâ€”another \r\n  case in which the particular facts nullified the right to relyâ€”as support.Â  \r\n  However, our courts have not pronounced a per se rule holding, as a matter of \r\n  law, that the purchaser of an infested home may not rely on a CL-100 report \r\n  given at closing.Â  To the contrary, as the Nine opinion recites, â€œ[T]he \r\n  question of whether reliance is justified in a given situation requires an evaluation \r\n  of the circumstances involved, including the positions and relations of the \r\n  parties.â€Â  313 S.C. at 312, 437 S.E.2d at 184 (citing Elders v. Parker, \r\n  286 S.C. 228, 332 S.E.2d 563 (Ct. App. 1985)).Â  The charge given by the trial \r\n  court took from the jury its responsibility to evaluate the Dixonsâ€™ actions \r\n  and to determine whether they were justified in relying on the CL-100.Â  \r\nFurther, Nine and \r\n  Bostick are factually inapposite to the Dixonsâ€™ case.Â  Nine received \r\n  wood infestation reports showing damage and elected to go forward with the claims.Â  \r\n  Bostick sought to sue the exterminator for fraud, but he relied on the report \r\n  in a manner the court ruled was impermissible because of disclaimers and state \r\n  regulations.Â  The Dixons, in contrast, were given a clear CL-100, which may \r\n  have been tampered with.Â  Charging the Nine language instructed that \r\n  the Dixons could not have relied on the report if it suggested an investigation \r\n  for structural damage and the purchaser did not comply.Â  The issue in this case \r\n  was not that the Dixons knew of damage and did not diligently investigate its \r\n  extent; instead, the Dixons were informed that the damaged areas had been repaired.Â  \r\n  Ford and the Dixons contractually agreed that Ford would (1) be responsible \r\n  for procuring an independent third party to certify that the house is free from \r\n  termite infestation and damage, and (2) correct any infestation or damage at \r\n  his own expense.Â  Whether the Dixons were justified in their reliance under \r\n  the facts of this case is a question for the jury, and it was error for the \r\n  court to give the charge.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Impact of the â€œAs Isâ€ Clause\r\nMacFarlane v. Manly, 274 S.C. 392, 264 S.E.2d \r\n  838 (1980), establishes that an â€œas isâ€ clause does not preclude a suit for \r\n  fraud.Â  MacFarlane involved an action for fraud in the sale of a house \r\n  that suffered from termite and water damage.Â  The contract included an â€œas isâ€ \r\n  clause.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to sellers on the basis that \r\n  the sellers â€œas a matter of law had no duty to disclose any matter to the Plaintiffs.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 392, 264 S.E.2d at 839.Â  Reversing, our supreme court announced:\r\n\r\nThe â€œas isâ€ clause of the contract does not constitute an \r\n  absolute defense to an action for fraud and deceit.Â  The inclusion of â€œas isâ€ \r\n  clauses is usually an effort on the part of the seller to assure application \r\n  of the caveat emptor rule. . . . \r\nIn years gone by, the tendency of the law was to let the \r\n  buyer beware in real estate transactions.Â  The more recent trend at the law \r\n  is to hold the seller to a more strict accountability.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 395-96, 264 S.E.2d at 840. \r\nFurthermore, the â€œas isâ€ clause in this \r\n  case provided that no guarantee or warranty was given â€œexcept as provided \r\n  in subparagraphs (B)-(G)[.]â€Â  In subparagraph (D), Ford agreed to procure \r\n  a clean CL-100 and to correct any infestation or damage at his expense.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the â€œas isâ€ clause does not protect Ford from the Dixonsâ€™ claim of fraud.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Prejudice Resulting from the \r\n  Erroneous Charge\r\nNotwithstanding the impropriety of the charge, \r\n  to warrant reversal, the charge must have prejudiced the Dixons.Â  See \r\n  Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  We find that the charge given substantially prejudiced the Dixonsâ€™ case.Â  \r\nIn order to prevail on their claim for fraud, the \r\n  Dixons had to prove all nine of the elements of fraud in South Carolina.Â  See \r\n  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 473, 581 S.E.2d 496, 503-04 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003) cert. denied (â€œThe elements of an action for fraud based \r\n  on a representation include: (1) a representation; (2) falsity; (3) its materiality; \r\n  (4) knowledge of the falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; \r\n  (5) intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance \r\n  of its falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance upon the truth; (8) the hearer's right \r\n  to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's consequent and proximate injury.â€).Â  By \r\n  giving the erroneous charge, the court effectively determined that the Dixons \r\n  had no right to rely as a matter of law; therefore, they were precluded from \r\n  proving one of the essential elements of fraud.Â  The erroneous charge here is \r\n  the quintessential prejudicial charge because it established, as a legal conclusion, \r\n  that the Dixons could not prevail on an element of their cause of action.Â  Pellucidly, \r\n  the charge prejudiced the Dixons, and the case must be remanded for retrial.Â  \r\n\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Preservation of the Objection to the Charge\r\nFord seeks to circumvent the erroneous charge by \r\n  arguing the issue was not preserved because the objection was not on the grounds \r\n  that the charge did not match the facts.Â  However, after the charge, the Dixonsâ€™ \r\n  counsel did object to the offending language:\r\n\r\nThe Court:Â  Additions or exceptions to the charges, \r\n  Mr. Young?\r\nMr. Young:Â  Yes, sir. . . . . You gave a charge that \r\n  in effect commented on the termite letter and whether or not if a buyer proceeded \r\n  with an infected house or that they did so at their own peril just about and \r\n  thatâ€™s the essence of what youâ€™re saying and they had to follow the directions \r\n  on the letter to get a structural engineer to that effect, the letter that was \r\n  in this particular case was in fact a clear letter because the letter was presented \r\n  at closing showed that the work had been completed by another contractor therefore \r\n  any damage that was found would have been corrected as what Mr. Stoddard said \r\n  that it was a clear letter, my clients thought it was a clear letter, thatâ€™s \r\n  the reason they proceeded with closing. . . . \r\n\r\nWhen the court defended the language as originating \r\n  from Nine, counsel argued that in Nine, the purchaser â€œmade an \r\n  informed decision knowing that the wood infestation report showed [infestation].Â  \r\n  They still went through with the closing.Â  Thatâ€™s not what we have here.â€Â  The \r\n  court referred to language from the report in this case, noting the report did \r\n  not consider structural damage.Â  Counsel rejoined, â€œBut it was repaired.Â  Thatâ€™s \r\n  under repairs.â€Â  This colloquy reveals that the Dixonsâ€™ counsel did raise the \r\n  salient issue: the language from Nine does not fit the facts and issues \r\n  raised in this case.Â  Accordingly, the issue was raised to the trial court and \r\n  preserved for our review.\r\nFord contends that the subject matter of an objection \r\n  regarding a jury instruction is not preserved where an objection is made prior \r\n  to the charge and not renewed after the charge is given but prior to the juryâ€™s \r\n  retiring to deliberate.Â  To support this proposition, he refers the court to \r\n  Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd., 334 S.C. 96, 119, 512 S.E.2d 510, 522 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).Â  However, the Dixons did object after the jury was charged, \r\n  but prior to the jury beginning its deliberations.Â  Thus, this argument is inappropriate.Â  \r\n\r\nNonetheless, we take this opportunity to remind \r\n  the bar that Rule 51, SCRCP, does not require that the objection to a charge \r\n  be renewed after the charge is given and prior to the juryâ€™s retiring to deliberate.Â  \r\n  Instead, it only requires an objection on the record, opportunity for discussion, \r\n  and a specific ruling by the trial court on the jury charge issue.Â  Keaton \r\n  ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hospital System, 334 S.C. 488, 494-95, 514 \r\n  S.E.2d 570, 573-74 (1999), addresses whether an objection to a jury charge was \r\n  properly preserved.Â  In Keaton, the plaintiff did not object to the pertinent \r\n  jury charge prior to the initial jury charge reading.Â  The court charged the \r\n  jury, but accidentally left out the charge at issue.Â  The defendants then objected \r\n  to the courtâ€™s omission of the charge; the judge agreed that the charge should \r\n  have been given.Â  At this point, the plaintiff objected to the charge for the \r\n  first time.Â  The court overruled the objection, brought the jury back into the \r\n  courtroom, and read the charge.Â  The Keaton court explained:\r\n\r\n[Plaintiffâ€™s] on the record explanation of his objection \r\n  to the hindsight jury charge along with the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on that issue \r\n  is sufficient to preserve the objection for appeal.Â  The objection is preserved \r\n  despite [plaintiff] not objecting to the charge after it was read to the jury.Â  \r\n  Our recent decision of State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 64 n.1, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  29, 30 n.1 (1998), observed that the majority and dissenting opinions in State \r\n  v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996), were â€œbeing read to hold \r\n  that where a partyâ€™s jury charge objections or requests are denied on-the-record \r\n  after a pre-charge conference, the party must renew those objections or requests \r\n  subsequent to the courts instructions to the jury.Â  The majority opinion in \r\n  Whipple, however, did not establish such a rule.â€Â  Id.Â  Johnson \r\n  clarified the confusion in Whipple by stating, â€œwhere a party requests \r\n  a jury charge and, after opportunity for discussion, the trial judge declines \r\n  the charge, it is unnecessary, to preserve the point on appeal, to renew the \r\n  request at [the] conclusion of the courtâ€™s instructions.â€Â  Id. . . . \r\n  Like the petitioner in Johnson, [plaintiff] objected on the record and \r\n  the trial judge specifically ruled on the objection.Â  \r\n\r\n334 S.C. at 494-95, 514 S.E.2d at 573.\r\nII.Â  Testimony of William Brunson\r\nThe Dixons argue the testimony of William Brunson \r\n  should not have been admitted because it was irrelevant and overly prejudicial.Â  \r\n  We decline to address this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed \r\n  above, the decision of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED \r\n  FOR A NEW TRIAL.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3935","title":"Collins Entertainment v.

Brogdon, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3935\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2004 â€“ Filed January \r\n  31, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam Gary White, III, \r\n  of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nJames B. Van Osdell and Charles B. Jordan, Jr., both of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Collins Entertainment, Inc. brought this breach of contract \r\n  action against Gary White, Gary Couillard, both individually, and d/b/a Montego \r\n  Bay (collectively Appellants) seeking to collect license fees.Â  The trial court \r\n  granted Collins a directed verdict on Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims, and the jury \r\n  returned a verdict in favor of Collins on its breach of contract claim.Â  We \r\n  affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1997, Collins signed a contract with the proprietors of Montego \r\n  Bay to place its video gaming machines in the establishment.Â  Shortly before \r\n  beginning operations, White and Couillard became the main partners of Montego \r\n  Bay and assumed the rights and obligations under the contract.Â  The contract \r\n  provided:Â  â€œCollins shall provide for all machine licenses and/or taxes the \r\n  costs of which shall be divided equally (50%/50%) between Proprietor and Collins.Â  \r\n  Proprietor shall reimburse Collins for its share of such costs immediately upon \r\n  demand.â€Â  \r\nCollins placed machines in Montego Bay for various periods of time.Â  \r\n  Appellants were charged a pro rata share of the license fees, but Collins never \r\n  received payment.Â  According to a Collins employee, Appellants owed $18,687.32 \r\n  in licensing fees to Collins.Â  \r\nCollins brought the underlying breach of contract action against \r\n  Appellants, seeking to collect the unpaid fees.Â  Appellants answered and counterclaimed \r\n  for breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, \r\n  unfair trade practices, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \r\n  Organizations Act (RICO). [2] Â  \r\n  The answers did not specifically plead any affirmative defenses.Â  Collinsâ€™ complaint \r\n  was amended to seek pre-judgment interest.\r\nOn March 29, 2001, Appellants filed a motion to compel discovery \r\n  and served it on Collinsâ€™ former legal office along with Appellantsâ€™ First Request \r\n  to Admit.Â  Collins did not respond to the request to admit due to its service \r\n  on a location at which no attorneys worked.Â  On May 15, 2001, Appellants filed \r\n  a motion to dismiss as a result of Collinsâ€™ failure to respond.Â  \r\nOn May 25, 2001, Mr. Youmans, who along with Mr. Mongilo was Collinsâ€™ \r\n  in-house counsel until 2000, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel and set \r\n  forth an appropriate address at which he could be reached.Â  On May 31, 2001, \r\n  Appellants served a Second Request to Admit.Â  Again, they served the former \r\n  office of Collinsâ€™ in-house counsel.Â  \r\nOn June 29, 2001, Collinsâ€™ new counsel filed a motion to answer the First Request \r\n  to Admit.Â  On the same date, an affidavit from Mr. Mongilo was filed with the \r\n  court indicating no one practiced at the previous address.Â  After a hearing \r\n  before Judge Baxley, Collins was allowed to answer the First Request to Admit.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Judge Baxley found:Â  â€œAt the time [Appellants] served these requests, \r\n  neither Mr. Youmans nor Mr. Mongilo, nor any other attorney operated at that \r\n  office.â€Â  Additionally, the court concluded:Â  â€œThis Court recognizes the confusion \r\n  and difficulty within [Collinsâ€™] organization occasioned by the demise of video \r\n  poker in South Carolina, and the resulting layoffs of the attorneys working \r\n  within the company.â€Â  \r\nThe court went on to find that Collinsâ€™ failure to respond was unintentional \r\n  and allowed Collins to respond.Â  At no time during this hearing did Appellants \r\n  make Collins or Judge Baxley aware of the Second Request to Admit.Â  Collins \r\n  did not timely respond to the request by the hearing date, and Appellants knew \r\n  it was served at the same address as the first.Â  \r\nThe first time Appellants made Collins aware of the Second Request to Admit \r\n  was at the start of trial.Â  The trial court ruled the requests were not deemed \r\n  admitted for the same reason Judge Baxley ruled the First Request to Admit was \r\n  not deemed admitted.Â  He found Appellants should have made the court and Collins \r\n  aware of the second set of requests and, under the specific circumstances, found \r\n  the requests would not be used to admit damages.Â  \r\nAdditionally, before trial began, the court ruled White could not operate as \r\n  an attorney and serve as a witness in the case under Rule 3.7 of the Professional \r\n  Rules of Conduct.Â  The court found it would be prejudicial for him to serve \r\n  as a witness regarding the contested issue of damages while serving as an attorney \r\n  for Couillard.Â  \r\nAt trial, Bill LaHart, a Collins employee, testified regarding the arrangement \r\n  between Collins, Montego Bay, and Appellants.Â  He testified the machines were \r\n  placed in Montego Bay pursuant to the contract, and Appellants were charged \r\n  a pro rated share of the license fee for each machine while it was in the establishment.Â  \r\n  He testified the total owed by Appellants for the machinesâ€™ license fees amounted \r\n  to $18,687.32.Â  \r\nCouillard testified the license fees were not required to be paid because of \r\n  a separate agreement reached with another Collins employee named Marshall Armstrong.Â  \r\n  He testified Collins was attempting to extort money from Appellants.Â  Additionally, \r\n  he testified Appellants would have shut the machines down and given them back \r\n  to Collins had they been responsible for the license fees and taxes on the machines.Â  \r\n\r\nCouillard testified he maintained a spreadsheet of all of his out-of-pocket \r\n  expenses.Â  The spreadsheet, however, was not presented at trial.Â  Couillard \r\n  also asserted he and White would both contribute money whenever it was needed \r\n  to keep the business afloat, though he did not know the exact amount, nor did \r\n  he have the checks to support his claims.Â  At one point, however, Couillard \r\n  did assert that Whiteâ€™s contribution may have been â€œ22, 25,000, something like \r\n  thatâ€ and that his â€œwas actually a little bit more.â€Â  \r\nCollins moved for directed verdict as to Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims, alleging \r\n  they failed to offer any proof of damages.Â  The court agreed and directed a \r\n  verdict on all counterclaims.Â  \r\nAppellants moved to amend the answer to include the \r\n  affirmative defense of estoppel.Â  Appellants attempted to argue the language \r\n  used in their breach of contract with fraudulent intent claim could support \r\n  a defense of estoppel.Â  In the alternative, Appellants sought to amend to conform \r\n  to the issues raised at trial.Â  The motion was denied.Â  Appellants also moved \r\n  for directed verdict as to Collinsâ€™ breach of contract claim on the grounds \r\n  Collins failed to produce documents and witnesses, the contract was illegal, \r\n  and for failing to prove damages.Â  The motion was denied.Â  \r\nCollinsâ€™ claim for breach of contract went to the jury, \r\n  which returned a verdict in the amount of $18,687.32.Â  After post-trial motions \r\n  were filed, the court entered an award in favor of Collins in the amount of \r\n  $18,687.32 in actual damages, $6,758.58 in pre-judgment interest, and $14,227.65 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the \r\n  verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences \r\n  that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party \r\n  opposing the motions.Â  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence \r\n  yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Steinke v. \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 386, \r\n  520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).Â  \r\nâ€œAn action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.â€Â  \r\n  Sterling Dev.

App. 2000).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on \r\n  appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this Court extends merely \r\n  to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury will not \r\n  be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence \r\n  which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs.

City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in refusing to deem Appellantsâ€™ Second Request \r\n  to Admit admitted when Collins failed to respond?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in refusing to publish both Appellantsâ€™ first \r\n  and second requests to admit to the jury?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n        \r\n         Did the trial court err in granting Collinsâ€™ motion for directed verdict \r\n  as to Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to dismiss Collinsâ€™ claim for breach \r\n  of contract because the contract was an illegal gambling contract under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 32-1-40 (Supp. 2003)?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        V.Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to allow Appellants to amend their \r\n  answer to add the affirmative defense of estoppel?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        \r\n         Did the trial court err in failing to find Collinsâ€™ claim barred by \r\n  the doctrines of laches or estoppel?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        VII.Â Â Â &nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in prohibiting White from testifying as a witness \r\n  when he was also acting as an attorney?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI &amp; II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Request \r\n  to Admit\r\nAppellants contend \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to deem their second request to admit as admitted \r\n  when Collins failed to respond.Â  Additionally, they aver the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to publish the admittances to the jury.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 36(a), SCRCP, provides:Â  â€œA party may serve upon any other party \r\n  a written request for the admission . . . of the truth of any matters within \r\n  the scope of Rule 26(b) . . . .â€Â  However, an admission may be withdrawn upon \r\n  application to the court:Â  \r\n\r\nAny matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court \r\n  on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.Â  Subject to the \r\n  provisions of Rule 16 governing amendment of a pre-trial order, the court may \r\n  permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action \r\n  will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admissions fails to \r\n  satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining \r\n  his action or defense on the merits.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nRule 36(b), SCRCP.\r\nIn the instant case, Judge Baxley previously found Appellantsâ€™ First \r\n  Request to Admit was filed at an office no longer in use and this constituted \r\n  a sufficient reason for refusing to deem the requests admitted and to allow \r\n  Collins to file late answers.Â  At the time of the hearing, Appellantsâ€™ Second \r\n  Request to Admit was outstanding and the time for Collins to file an answer \r\n  had expired.Â  Instead of informing the court and Collins of the outstanding \r\n  request, Appellants waited until the beginning of trial to mention the outstanding \r\n  requests to Collins and the new judge.Â  We find Appellants cannot now complain \r\n  of being prejudiced by the refusal to deem the requests admitted because they \r\n  could have raised the issue before Judge Baxley.Â  State v. Brannon, 341 \r\n  S.C. 271, 275, 533 S.E.2d 345, 347 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œA party cannot complain \r\n  of an error induced by the partyâ€™s own conduct.â€) (citation omitted). \r\nCollinsâ€™ attorney denied any damages existed and also denied ever seeing the \r\n  request to admit.Â  Specifically, he stated:Â  â€œWe donâ€™t admit the amount of his \r\n  damages.Â  If he begins on damages, Your Honor, that is highly contested as far \r\n  as weâ€™re concerned.â€Â  The court did not prevent Appellants from offering proof \r\n  of their damages.Â  It simply required Appellants to offer the actual proof and \r\n  not rely upon the Second Request to Admit.Â  Therefore, Appellants were not prejudiced \r\n  by the refusal to deem the requests admitted.Â  Under the circumstances, we find \r\n  the trial court properly ruled on the issue.Â  \r\nAppellants then sought to introduce into evidence the fact that the First Request \r\n  to Admit was not answered by Collins and, therefore, was deemed admitted prior \r\n  to Collins being granted the right to respond late to the request.Â  They also \r\n  sought to introduce the Second Request to Admit, asserting it had been admitted \r\n  by Collinsâ€™ failure to respond.Â  We find the trial court properly refused to \r\n  allow Appellants to publish to the jury Collinsâ€™ failure to respond.\r\nAppellants rely on Tuomey Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. McIntosh, \r\n  315 S.C. 189, 432 S.E.2d 485 (1993), for the holding:\r\n\r\nOnce an answer to a Request for Admissions is amended under Rule 36, both the \r\n  initial answer and the amended answer may be published to the jury.Â  The jury \r\n  may consider the initial answers as evidence, while the party who made such \r\n  answers â€œis free to explain why it was made and [amended].â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 191, 432 S.E.2d at 487 (citing Wright &amp; Miller, Federal \r\n  Practice and Procedure:Â  Civil Â§ 2264 at 745 (1970) (footnotes omitted)).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Tuomey, the requests were admitted by the partyâ€™s initial \r\n  answer.Â  The admitting party, however, then sought to amend its answer asserting \r\n  it inadvertently provided incorrect information.Â  The trial court granted the \r\n  amendment, but allowed both sets of answers to be submitted to the jury.Â  Id. \r\n  at 190-191, 432 S.E.2d at 486.Â  Tuomey is not similar to the present \r\n  case where the admission, which was subsequently withdrawn, arose solely from \r\n  the failure to make a timely response.\r\nIn any event, the Tuomey case relied on Wright and Millerâ€™s \r\n  Federal Practice and Procedure for the rule cited.Â  The full explanation \r\n  of the rule as it appears in Federal Practice and Procedure states:\r\n\r\nThe general rule with regard to a pleading that has been withdrawn \r\n  is that it can no longer be used as a conclusive judicial admission but that \r\n  it is admissible in evidence at the instance of the adversary as an evidentiary \r\n  admission, with the party who made the admission free to explain why it was \r\n  made and withdrawn. The cases have not focused on this question as it applies \r\n  to a Rule 36 admission. There would be reason to hold that an express admission, \r\n  later withdrawn, should be treated in the same fashion as a pleading, but \r\n  that if the court has permitted an admission through failure to make timely \r\n  response to be withdrawn, the admission should pass out of the case entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\nWright &amp; Miller, Federal \r\n  Practice and Procedure:Â  Civil Â§ 2264 at 579 (1994) (footnotes omitted) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nWe find where \r\n  an admission is made solely by the failure to make a timely response, such admission \r\n  being later withdrawn, the party is not allowed to publish the admission to \r\n  the jury.Â  The party may publish the late-filed response, but may not assert \r\n  before the jury that the requests were previously admitted.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  conclude the trial court properly refused to allow Appellants to publish to \r\n  the jury the fact that Collins admitted the requests by failing to make a timely \r\n  response.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Collinsâ€™ Motion for Directed Verdict\r\nAppellants maintain the trial court erred in granting Collinsâ€™ motion \r\n  for directed verdict on the ground that they failed to prove damages.Â  We disagree \r\n  and find the record is devoid of evidence from which the jury could calculate \r\n  damages without resulting to speculation or conjecture.\r\nFirst, we note Appellants only address the breach of contract claim \r\n  in their discussion of evidence of damages.Â  Accordingly, we find they have \r\n  abandoned their other counterclaims against Collins.Â  See Bell v. \r\n  Bennett, 307 S.C. 286, 294, 414 S.E.2d 786, 791 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding \r\n  an issue which is not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned on appeal); Rule \r\n  208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set \r\n  forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€).\r\nâ€œIn a breach \r\n  of contract action, damages serve to place the nonbreaching party in the position \r\n  he would have enjoyed had the contract been performed. . . . In the normal case, \r\n  the damage will consist of two distinct elements:Â  (1) out-of-pocket costs actually \r\n  incurred as a result of the contract; and (2) the gain above costs that would \r\n  have been realized had the contract been performed.â€Â  South Carolina Fed. \r\n  Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., Inc., 303 S.C. 74, 77, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  8, 10-11 (Ct. App. 1990). Â â€œGenerally, in order for damages to be recoverable, \r\n  the evidence should be such as to enable the court or jury to determine the \r\n  amount thereof with reasonable certainty or accuracy.Â  While neither the existence, \r\n  causation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess or speculation, \r\n  proof with mathematical certainty of the amount of loss or damage is not required.â€Â  \r\n  Whisenant v. James Island Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796 \r\n  (1981).\r\nCouillard testified \r\n  he kept a spreadsheet detailing some of the expenses he and White shared as \r\n  a result of their business dealings with Collins.Â  What he did not testify to, \r\n  however, was the amounts listed on the spreadsheet, nor did he present the spreadsheet \r\n  into evidence.Â  He merely stated that he and White would contribute $125 for \r\n  one thing or $500 for another.Â  Similarly, Couillard asserted he would write \r\n  checks for $7,000 or $1,000 or $1,500, but never explained why he wrote the \r\n  checks or how they came about as a result of Collinsâ€™ breach of the contract. \r\n  Â \r\nFinally, Couillard testified \r\n  that Whiteâ€™s out of pocket business expenses were â€œabout 22, 25,000, something \r\n  like that,â€ although he admitted he did not know an exact amount.Â  According \r\n  to Couillard, his contribution would have been more, but again did not offer \r\n  a specific dollar amount. Â As before, he failed to relate any of the \r\n  expenses to damages resulting from a breach of contract by Collins.Â  He simply \r\n  stated they were out-of-pocket expenses for the business, not that they were \r\n  expenses related to a breach of contract. \r\nAny calculation of damages \r\n  by the jury would have been pure speculation.Â  The Second Request to Admit was \r\n  properly excluded from evidence and none of the testimony presented provided \r\n  any evidence of an amount of damages attributable to any breach of contract \r\n  by Collins.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted the directed \r\n  verdict motion.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Illegal Contract\r\nAppellants contend the contract was an illegal contract under section \r\n  32-1-40 of the South Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 32-1-40 is entitled â€œNotes or other securities or conveyances \r\n  given to secure wagers are void.â€Â  The section specifically provides:\r\n\r\nAll notes, bills, bonds, judgments, mortgages or other securities or conveyances \r\n  whatsoever given, granted, entered into or executed by any person whatsoever \r\n  when the whole or any part of the consideration of such conveyances or securities \r\n  shall be (a) for any money or valuable thing whatsoever won by cockfighting, \r\n  horse racing or by gaming or playing at cards, dice tables, tennis, bowls, or \r\n  other game whatsoever or by betting on the sides or hands of such as do game \r\n  at any of the games aforesaid or any other game or games or (b) for the reimbursing \r\n  or repaying any money knowingly lent or advanced at the time and place of such \r\n  cockfighting, horse racing or play to any person (i) so gaming or betting as \r\n  aforesaid or (ii) that shall, during such cockfighting, horse racing or play, \r\n  so bet shall be utterly void, frustrate and of none effect to all intents and \r\n  purposes whatsoever.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-1-40 (1991).\r\nThis section does not apply to the contract at \r\n  hand.Â  Collins did not lend money to Appellants for the purpose of gambling, \r\n  nor were securities or conveyances made using gambling proceeds.Â  The contract \r\n  provision required Appellants to pay one-half of the licensing fees due to the \r\n  State of South Carolina under section 12-21-2720 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nAdditionally, enforcement of the contract does not violate public \r\n  policy.Â  While the contract was in full effect, video poker was a legal enterprise \r\n  in South Carolina.Â  The obligations, which arose as a result of operating the \r\n  machines, were created when the games were legal.Â  Enforcement of a provision \r\n  requiring the payment of license fees, which were properly collected and remitted \r\n  to the State of South Carolina, is not in derogation of public policy. \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Amendment of Answer\r\nAppellants assert the trial court erred in refusing to allow them \r\n  to amend their answer to allege the affirmative defense of estoppel.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 15, SCRCP, allows for the amendment of pleadings:\r\n\r\n(a) Amendments.Â  A party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at \r\n  any time before or within 30 days after a responsive pleading is servedÂ Â  . \r\n  . . .Â  Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by \r\n  written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice \r\n  so requires and does not prejudice any other party. . . . \r\n(b) Amendments to Conform to the Evidence.Â  When issues not raised by the pleadings \r\n  are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated \r\n  in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.Â  Such amendment \r\n  of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence \r\n  and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, \r\n  even after judgment . . . the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and \r\n  shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be \r\n  subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the \r\n  admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or \r\n  defense upon the merits. \r\n\r\nIt is well established that a motion to amend is addressed to the \r\n  discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden \r\n  of establishing prejudice.Â  Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 \r\n  S.C. 552, 558-59, 521 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1999).Â  The prejudice that Rule 15 envisions \r\n  is a lack of notice that the new issue is to be tried and a lack of opportunity \r\n  to refute it.Â  Id.Â  Amendments to conform to the proof should be liberally \r\n  allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result.Â  Soil &amp; \r\n  Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly Assocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, \r\n  781 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nAppellants assert the issue of estoppel was raised in the pleadings \r\n  under the arguments for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  \r\n  We disagree and find that estoppel must be affirmatively pled as a defense and \r\n  cannot be bootstrapped onto another claim.Â  See Rule 8, SCRCP; Provident \r\n  Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 478, 451 S.E.2d 924, \r\n  929 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding estoppel is an affirmative defense).\r\nAdditionally, we find the issue was not tried by consent of the parties.Â  \r\n  While Appellants contend the comments and assurances made by Marshall Armstrong \r\n  form the basis of their estoppel claim and these were raised at trial, they \r\n  also were the grounds of the claim for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent \r\n  act.Â  Collins prepared to defend the breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent \r\n  act claim and not a claim of estoppel.Â  Accordingly, Collins sufficiently demonstrated \r\n  the prejudice envisioned by Rule 15, requiring the court to deny a motion to \r\n  amend.Â  See Tanner, 336 S.C. at 559, 521 S.E.2d at 156.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the trial court properly denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend the pleadings.\r\nVI.Â Â Â  Laches and Estoppel\r\nAppellants contend the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the \r\n  claim as being barred by the doctrines of laches and/or estoppel.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs we found above, Appellants failed to plead estoppel as an affirmative \r\n  defense and the court properly denied their motion to include it as a defense.Â  \r\n  Additionally, laches is an affirmative defense which must be specifically pled.Â  \r\n  Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  The failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver \r\n  of the right to assert it.Â  E.g., Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 \r\n  S.C. 416, 419, 377 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1989).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court \r\n  properly refused to dismiss Collinsâ€™ claims under either theory.\r\nVII.Â Â  White as Attorney \r\n  and Witness\r\nAppellants also contend the trial court erred in finding White could \r\n  not act as both an attorney for Couillard and as a fact witness in this case.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nRule 3.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, provides:\r\n\r\n(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely \r\n  to be a necessary witness except where:\r\n(1) The testimony relates to an uncontested issue;\r\n(2) The testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered \r\n  in the case; or\r\n(3) Disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.\r\n\r\nHere, White sought to act as attorney for Couillard as well as a \r\n  witness regarding damages allegedly incurred as a result of Collinsâ€™ breach \r\n  of contract.Â  Collins contested the issue and denied it owed any money to White \r\n  or Couillard because it denied any breach existed.Â  Therefore, the first exception \r\n  does not apply.Â  The second exception also does not apply, as the testimony \r\n  was not in regards to Whiteâ€™s service as attorney.Â  â€œThe roles of an advocate \r\n  and of a witness are inconsistent; the function of an advocate is to advance \r\n  or argue the cause of another, while that of a witness is to state facts objectively.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Capps, 276 S.C. 59, 65, 275 S.E.2d 872, 875 (1981) (Lewis, C.J., \r\n  dissenting) (quoting Ethical Consideration 5-9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in requiring White to choose \r\n  whether to act as counsel or to be called as a witness during trial.\r\nFinally, the court determined no substantial hardship would be caused by White \r\n  acting only as a witness and Mr. Robert Rushing, Whiteâ€™s law partner, acting \r\n  as counsel for all involved.Â  Specifically, the court found the case was continued \r\n  several times due to Mr. Rushingâ€™s absence.Â  Mr. Rushing took an active role \r\n  in at least one motion hearing in addition to being involved in the trial.Â  \r\n  Thus, we find no hardship would be created if Mr. Rushing were required to take \r\n  over Couillardâ€™s representation.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  18 U.S.C.A.

The issues posited on appeal:  (1) whether it was foreseeable that the failure of Hitachi to equip the excavator with a seat belt would lead to an ejection injury to someone OR whether the injuries sustained by appellant were the foreseeable consequence of any alleged negligence of Hitachi because the excavator was manufactured according to Japanese standards, sold in the Japanese market, and there was no proof as to its introduction into the American market; and (2) whether the omission of the optional safety equipment â€“ seat belt â€“ caused the excavator to be in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous to the user at the time it was sold by American Equipment Company.","date":"2005-01-31","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRichard Rife, Appellant,\r\nv.\r\nHitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Euclid-Hitachi Heavy Equipment, \r\n        Ltd., Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation, Hitachi Construction \r\n        Machinery (America) Corporation, American Equipment Company, and Does \r\n        1-5 Inclusive, Defendants, of whom Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., \r\n        Ltd. and American Equipment Company are Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Georgetown County\r\nBenjamin H.

Ward Lambert, of Greenville, for Respondent American \r\n  Equipment Company, Inc.\r\nJ. Calhoun Watson, of Columbia, for Respondent Hitachi \r\n  Construction Machinery Co., Ltd.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this products liability case, Richard Rife \r\n  appeals the trial courtâ€™s orders granting summary judgment to Hitachi Construction \r\n  Machinery Co., Ltd. (Hitachi) and American Equipment Company (American Equipment).Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn June 25, 1999, Rife sustained an injury while operating a 1992 Hitachi EX100 \r\n  Excavator (EX100).Â  When Rife pushed the controls of the excavator to drive \r\n  off an embankment, the EX100 suddenly lurched forward and then abruptly stopped.Â  \r\n  The sudden stop ejected Rife through the front window of the operatorâ€™s cab, \r\n  injuring him.\r\nWhen the accident occurred, Rife worked for Armand Berube d/b/a Dirty \r\n  Works, Inc., a grading contractor.Â  In March of 1998, Dirty Works purchased \r\n  the used EX100 from American Equipment as-is.Â  Berube knew the excavator was \r\n  a â€œgray marketâ€ machine.Â  Machinery sold on the â€œgray marketâ€ consists of equipment \r\n  designed, manufactured, and marketed for use in a foreign country, but which \r\n  is imported into the United States.Â  Hitachi designed and manufactured the EX100 \r\n  at issue solely for sale and use in Japan according to Japanese specifications \r\n  that differ significantly from American specifications.Â  Hitachi sold the EX100 \r\n  in Japan to a Japanese purchaser for use in Japan.Â  The EX100 was never intended \r\n  for use in the United States.\r\nAt the time of the accident, the EX100 had no seat belt.Â  When Hitachi \r\n  manufactured the EX100, a seat belt was an available option in accordance with \r\n  the Japanese safety standards.\r\nRife filed this action against Hitachi and American Equipment alleging (1) \r\n  negligence; (2) strict liability based on a manufacturing defect; and (3) strict \r\n  liability based on a failure to warn of the defect.Â  After answering, Hitachi \r\n  and American Equipment filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court \r\n  granted both motions.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the \r\n  appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue \r\n  as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n  of law.Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 360 S.C. 366, 601 S.E.2d \r\n  342 (2004); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d \r\n  629 (Ct. App. 2004); Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 \r\n  S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact \r\n  exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical \r\n  Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); \r\n  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If \r\n  triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l \r\n  Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002); Young v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Belton v. Cincinnati \r\n  Ins. Co., 360 S.C. 575, 602 S.E.2d 389 (2004); McCall v. State Farm Mut. \r\n  Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004); Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP; see also Higgins v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 326 \r\n  S.C. 592, 486 S.E.2d 269 (Ct. App. 1997) (noting that when ruling on a motion \r\n  for summary judgment, the trial judge must consider all of the documents and \r\n  evidence within the record, including pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \r\n  admissions on file, and affidavits).Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary \r\n  judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and \r\n  inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the \r\n  non-moving party below.â€Â  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., \r\n  349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, \r\n  357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that all ambiguities, \r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most \r\n  strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry \r\n  into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  \r\n  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000); \r\n  Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. \r\n  2004).Â  Summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute \r\n  as to evidentiary facts if there is disagreement concerning the conclusion to \r\n  be drawn from those facts.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, \r\n  341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, \r\n  595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable \r\n  facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should \r\n  be granted.Â  Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, \r\n  559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001); Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly \r\n  establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  McCall, \r\n  359 S.C. at 376, 597 S.E.2d at 183.Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment \r\n  meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the \r\n  opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials \r\n  contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, \r\n  582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward \r\n  with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Ellis, \r\n  358 S.C. at 518-19, 595 S.E.2d at 822; Peterson v. West American Ins. Co., \r\n  336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do \r\n  not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. \r\n  58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., \r\n  357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, \r\n  summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not \r\n  improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. \r\n  Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); \r\n  Hawkins, 358 S.C. at 289, 594 S.E.2d at 561-62; Murray v. Holnam, \r\n  Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 S.E.2d 743 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Doctrinal Analysis/Products Liability\r\nA products liability case may be brought under several theories, \r\n  including negligence, strict liability, and warranty.Â  Small v. Pioneer Mach., \r\n  Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 494 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1997); Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, \r\n  Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 462 S.E.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In a products \r\n  liability action, regardless of the theory on which the plaintiff seeks recovery, \r\n  he must establish three elements: (1) he was injured by the product; (2) the \r\n  injury occurred because the product was in a defective condition, unreasonably \r\n  dangerous to the user; and (3) the product, at the time of the accident, was \r\n  in essentially the same condition as when it left the hands of the defendant.Â  \r\n  Small, 329 S.C. at 462-63, 494 S.E.2d at 842; Bragg, 319 S.C. \r\n  at 539, 462 S.E.2d at 326; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10(1) (1977) \r\n  (â€œOne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous \r\n  to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical \r\n  harm caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property . . . .â€).Â  \r\n  Further, liability for negligence requires, in addition to the above, proof \r\n  that the manufacturer breached its duty to exercise reasonable care to adopt \r\n  a safe design.Â  Allen v. Long Mfg. NC, Inc., 332 S.C. 422, 505 S.E.2d \r\n  354 (Ct. App. 1998); Madden v. Cox, 284 S.C. 574, 328 S.E.2d 108 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985).\r\nUnder any products liability theory, a plaintiff must prove the product defect \r\n  was the proximate cause of the injury sustained.Â  Bray v. Marathon Corp., \r\n  356 S.C. 111, 588 S.E.2d 93 (2003); Small, 329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 842; see also Livingston v. Noland Corp., 293 S.C. 521, 362 \r\n  S.E.2d 16 (1987) (finding proximate cause is an element of strict liability \r\n  claim); Young v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 242 S.E.2d 671 (1978) \r\n  (holding proximate cause is an essential element common to the alternative theories \r\n  of negligence, breach of implied warranty, and strict liability in tort); S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-715(2)(b) (2003) (providing that consequential damages resulting \r\n  from sellerâ€™s breach include injury to person or property proximately resulting \r\n  from any breach of warranty).\r\nA plaintiff suing under a products liability cause of action can recover all \r\n  damages that were proximately caused by the defendantâ€™s placing an unreasonably \r\n  dangerous product into the stream of commerce.Â  Small, 329 S.C. at 464, \r\n  494 S.E.2d at 843; Parr v. Gaines, 309 S.C. 477, 424 S.E.2d 515 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992).Â  Proximate cause requires proof of causation in fact and legal cause.Â  \r\n  Bray, 356 S.C. at 116-17, 588 S.E.2d at 95; Trivelas v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred \r\n  â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Small, 329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 842.Â  Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  Bray, \r\n  356 S.C. at 117, 588 S.E.2d at 95; Small, 329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 842.\r\nThe touchstone of proximate cause in South Carolina is foreseeability.Â  Koester \r\n  v. Carolina Rental Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 443 S.E.2d 392 (1994); Small, \r\n  329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d at 842.Â  The test of foreseeability is whether some \r\n  injury to another is the natural and probable consequence of the complained-of \r\n  act.Â  Id.Â  For an act to be a proximate cause of the injury, the injury \r\n  must be a foreseeable consequence of the act.Â  Small, 329 S.C. at 463, \r\n  494 S.E.2d at 842-43.Â  Although foreseeability of some injury from an act or \r\n  omission is a prerequisite to establishing proximate cause, the plaintiff need \r\n  not prove that the actor should have contemplated the particular event which \r\n  occurred.Â  Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 \r\n  (1991); Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 592 S.E.2d 315 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nProximate cause is the efficient or direct cause of an injury.Â  Small, \r\n  329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d at 843.Â  Proximate cause does not mean the sole \r\n  cause.Â  Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. \r\n  79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998); Small, 329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d at 843.Â  \r\n  The defendantâ€™s conduct can be a proximate cause if it was at least one of the \r\n  direct, concurring causes of the injury.Â  Sims, 357 S.C. at 299, 592 \r\n  S.E.2d at 320; Small, 329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d at 843.\r\nAn intervening force may be a superseding cause that relieves an actor from \r\n  liability.Â  Small, 329 S.C. at 467, 494 S.E.2d at 844.Â  However, the \r\n  intervening cause must be a cause that could not have been reasonably foreseen \r\n  or anticipated.Â  Mickle v. Blackmon, 252 S.C. 202, 166 S.E.2d \r\n  173 (1969); Small, 329 S.C. at 467, 494 S.E.2d at 844.\r\nII.Â  Summary Judgment â€“ Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. \r\nRife argues the judge erred in granting summary judgment to Hitachi.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court \r\n  granted summary judgment to Hitachi on the ground that Rifeâ€™s injuries were \r\n  not the foreseeable consequences of Hitachiâ€™s failure to equip the EX100 with \r\n  a seat belt because it was designed and manufactured solely for distribution \r\n  and use in Japan.\r\nUncontroverted testimony indicated Hitachi intended the EX100 only \r\n  for the Japanese market, sold the EX100 to a Japanese customer, and manufactured \r\n  the EX100 in accordance with Japanese safety standards.Â  The EX100 was not constructed \r\n  according to United States standards and was never intended for sale in the \r\n  United States.Â  Some third party imported the EX100 into the United States and \r\n  sold it on the â€œgray market.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œgray marketâ€ \r\n  as a â€œmarket in which the seller uses legal but sometimes unethical methods \r\n  to avoid a manufacturerâ€™s distribution chain and thereby sell goods (esp. imported \r\n  goods) at prices lower than those envisioned by the manufacturer.â€Â  Blackâ€™s \r\n  Law Dictionary 989 (8th ed. 2004).Â  â€œGray marketâ€ products include â€œâ€˜goods \r\n  produced abroad with authorization and payment but which are imported into unauthorized \r\n  markets.â€™â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 989 (quoting Ralph H. Folsom &amp; \r\n  Michael W. Gordon, International Business Transactions Â§ 20.8 (1995)).\r\nThere is no evidence regarding how many people owned the EX100 prior \r\n  to its purchase by Dirty Works or whether anyone altered the EX100 in any way.Â  \r\n  Under these facts, Hitachi could not reasonably foresee the EX100, designed \r\n  for use in Japan, would injure a person in the United States.Â  Any foreseeability \r\n  link was severed when the EX100 was imported into the United States.Â  Therefore, \r\n  as a matter of law, Hitachi is not liable for Rifeâ€™s injuries.\r\nIII.Â  Summary Judgment â€“ American Equipment Company \r\nRife contends the judge erred in granting summary judgment to American \r\n  Equipment on Rifeâ€™s theories of liability: strict liability, negligent design \r\n  and manufacture, and failure to warn of a defect.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court based its decision to grant summary judgment to American \r\n  Equipment on the holding of the factually similar case, Marchant v. Mitchell \r\n  Distrib. Co., 270 S.C. 29, 240 S.E.2d 511 (1977).Â  In Marchant, the \r\n  plaintiff sustained an injury when a cable snapped, causing a bucket connected \r\n  to a hydraulic craneâ€™s telescoping boom to fall.Â  The plaintiff brought an action \r\n  against Mitchell Distributing, the equipment distributor who sold the crane \r\n  to the plaintiffâ€™s employer, alleging negligence, breach of express and/or implied \r\n  warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and strict \r\n  liability.Â  The actions averring breach of warranty and strict liability were \r\n  based on the theory that the absence of a safety attachment called an anti-blocking \r\n  device rendered the crane unfit for its intended purpose and in a defective \r\n  condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.Â  Id. at 32, 240 S.E.2d \r\n  at 511-12.Â  The safety device was an available option purchasable for an additional \r\n  price.Â  The plaintiffâ€™s employer did not purchase the device.Â  Id.\r\nIn concluding the trial court correctly granted the summary judgment \r\n  motion as to Mitchell Distributing, the Marchant court explained:\r\n\r\nMarchant argues that his showing supports the inference that the crane, \r\n  absent the optional safety device, was a defective product unreasonably dangerous.Â  \r\n  We think however, that the fact the crane was without the optional safety device, \r\n  does not tend to prove that it was defective.Â  Most any product can be made \r\n  more safe.Â  Automobiles would be more safe with disc brakes and steel-belted \r\n  radial tires than with ordinary brakes and ordinary tires, but this does not \r\n  mean that an automobile dealer would be held to have sold a defective product \r\n  merely because the most safe equipment is not installed.Â  By a like token, a \r\n  bicycle is more safe if equipped with lights and a bell, but the fact that one \r\n  is not so equipped does not create the inference that the bicycle is defective \r\n  and unreasonably dangerous.\r\n\r\nId. at 35-36, 240 S.E.2d at 513.Â  The court further articulated:\r\n\r\nBy bringing the action under section 15-73-10, Marchant has assumed \r\n  the burden of presenting evidence which tends to prove that the crane was in \r\n  a defective condition unreasonably dangerous, which proximately caused his injury.Â  \r\n  The fact that the injury occurred and the fact that the crane could have been \r\n  more safe is not sufficient to support a finding that the crane was unreasonably \r\n  dangerous.\r\n\r\nId. at 36, 240 S.E.2d at 514.\r\nRife asserts American Equipment marketed and sold the EX100 in an \r\n  unreasonably dangerous condition because it lacked an optional safety device, \r\n  a seat belt.Â  Applying Marchant, we find Rife failed to present any evidence \r\n  demonstrating the EX100 was unreasonably dangerous.Â  Evidence the EX100 could \r\n  have been made more safe with the installation of a seat belt is insufficient \r\n  to support a finding the EX100 was defective.Â  There is some danger incident \r\n  to the use of most any product.Â  A product can certainly cause injury if used \r\n  improperly.Â  No doubt there are products which require safety devices to eliminate \r\n  dangers.Â  This is not one of them.\r\nIn addition, we rule the trial court correctly held there was no \r\n  evidence upon which a jury could conclude American Equipment was negligent in \r\n  the design or manufacture of the EX100.Â  In Marchant, the plaintiff alleged \r\n  Mitchell Distributing was negligent in marketing, selling, and/or distributing \r\n  a defective crane.Â  In upholding summary judgment in favor of Mitchell Distributing, \r\n  the court declared: â€œIt is beyond question that Mitchell had nothing to do with \r\n  designing or assembling the crane.â€Â  Id. at 37, 240 S.E.2d at 514.Â  The \r\n  court in Marchant determined Mitchell could not be liable on the theory \r\n  of negligent design.Â  Id.Â  Similarly, American Equipment had no involvement \r\n  in the design or manufacture of the EX100.Â  Factually, American Equipment did \r\n  not have any input regarding whether a seat belt was installed.Â  Rife knew the \r\n  EX100 did not have a seat belt prior to the accident.Â  See Marchant, \r\n  270 S.C. at 37, 240 S.E.2d at 514 (stating that failure to give warnings was \r\n  inconsequential where plaintiff admitted he knew the dangers prior to the accident \r\n  at issue).Â  In his deposition, Rife answered counselâ€™s questions:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         And between that point in time, the time of the meeting, and the day your \r\n  accident occurred, between the two, did you have occasion to operate this EX-100 \r\n  track hoe?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         Yes\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.Â \r\n         Okay.Â  And did you notice then that it did not have a seat belt?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err in granting summary \r\n  judgment to American Equipment on all causes of action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRifeâ€™s injuries were not the foreseeable consequences \r\n  of Hitachiâ€™s failure to equip the EX100 with a seat belt because it was designed \r\n  and manufactured in compliance with Japanese standards solely for use in Japan.Â  \r\n  Hitachi could not reasonably foresee the EX100 would injure a user in a foreign \r\n  market.Â  Any foreseeability link or concatenation was severed when the EX100 \r\n  was imported into the United States.Â  Furthermore, the exclusion of the seat \r\n  belt on the EX100 was NOT the proximate cause of Rifeâ€™s injuries.\r\nThe absence of a seat belt does not factually or \r\n  legally prove the EX100 was unreasonably dangerous.Â  Concomitantly, the seller, \r\n  American Equipment, is not liable under any products liability theory.Â  Finally, \r\n  American Equipment, a seller with absolutely no involvement in the design or \r\n  manufacture of the EX100, cannot be held liable for a design or manufacturing \r\n  defect.\r\nAccordingly, the orders of the trial court granting \r\n  summary judgment to Hitachi and American Equipment are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:&nbsp;\r\nNepolean Thompson appeals \r\n  his convictions for drug related offenses, arguing evidence was seized under \r\n  an invalid search warrant.Â  The questions presented are (1) whether the warrant \r\n  sufficiently described the person or things to be seized; (2) whether the warrant \r\n  was issued based on stale information; and (3) whether the warrant authorized \r\n  an unreasonable bodily intrusion. We affirm.&nbsp; \r\nFACTS\r\nOfficer A.B. Phillips of the Blacksburg Police Department was assigned to the \r\n  Cherokee County Metro Narcotics Task Force.Â  InÂ  2002, Phillips was investigating \r\n  possible illegal drug activities involving Thompson.Â  After the investigation \r\n  had been ongoing for several months, Phillips received a tip from a confidential \r\n  informant that the informant had seen illegal narcotics in Thompsonâ€™s possession. \r\n  Based on this information, Phillips prepared an affidavit and obtained a search \r\n  warrant from a magistrate.Â  The affidavit read:\r\n\r\nAffiantâ€™s belief is based upon information received from \r\n  a confidential reliable informent [sic], who has provided information in the \r\n  past that has proven true and correct and led to the arrest and conviction of \r\n  those involved in illegal drug trade.Â  This C.R.I. states that he or she has \r\n  seen a quantity of crack cocaine on the above described person within the past \r\n  72 hours.Â  Affiantâ€™s [sic] knows this C.R.I. to know crack cocaine when seen \r\n  by past information received from C.R.I.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe warrant issued described the permitted search as follows:\r\nDescription of \r\n  Premises (Person, Place or Thing) To Be Searched\r\n\r\nOne, Napoleon [sic] Thompson III, aka Buster, is to be searched.Â  \r\n  A black male, DOB 5-29-79, DL number 0011405948, HGT 5-10, WGT 145lbs, address \r\n  207 E. Seven Springs St., Blacksburg SC. The search will include all \r\n  clothing, shoes, hats, socks, under garments, jackets, scarfs [sic], bandannas, \r\n  any vehicle and or any means of transportation that Mr. Napoleon [sic] Thompson \r\n  III may be traveling in or on, and Mr. Napoleon [sic] Thompsonâ€™s mouth.Â  The \r\n  search will also include any types of luggage, small or large in Mr. Thompsons \r\n  [sic] poss. Â \r\n\r\nOfficer Phillips promptly undertook efforts to execute the \r\n  warrant.Â  The day after the warrant was issued, Phillips received information \r\n  that Thompson â€œwould be traveling down South Charleston Street [in Blacksburg] \r\n  with crack cocaine and marijuana in his possession.â€Â  This information was disseminated \r\n  to officers in the area, and shortly thereafter, a police officer spotted Thompsonâ€™s \r\n  car traveling on South Charleston Street.Â  When Officer Phillips arrived on \r\n  South Charleston Street, Thompson had parked his car and entered a convenience \r\n  store.Â  When Thompson returned to his car, he was confronted by the officers.Â  \r\n  After being informed of the search warrant, Thompson stepped out of his car \r\n  as instructed by the officers.Â  Thompson then pulled two small plastic bags \r\n  out of his pocket, threw them in the air, and attempted to flee.Â  Phillips grabbed \r\n  Thompson before he could get away and detained him. \r\n  [1] Â  The plastic bags Thompson had tossed away were recovered by \r\n  police and held as evidence. Subsequent analysis revealed the bags contained \r\n  marijuana and crack cocaine.\r\nThompson was taken to the police department and searched.Â Â  \r\n  The only additional evidence the search produced was $2,654 cash found in Thompsonâ€™s \r\n  wallet.Â \r\nThompson was charged with possession with intent to distribute crack \r\n  cocaine and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine within a half \r\n  mile of a school.Â  Before trial, Thompson moved to suppress the crack cocaine \r\n  and the marijuana evidence.Â  Thompson claimed the drug evidence was inadmissible \r\n  because it was obtained under an invalid search warrant.Â  Specifically, Thompson \r\n  argued the warrant was void because: (1) the warrant impermissibly permitted \r\n  the search of Thompsonâ€™s person and was otherwise overbroad with regard to the \r\n  places and things it authorized law enforcement to search; (2) the affidavit \r\n  submitted to obtain the warrant recited stale information insufficient to support \r\n  a finding of probable cause; and (3) the warrant permitted an unreasonable bodily \r\n  intrusion or strip search of Thompson.Â  The trial court disagreed and denied \r\n  the motion.Â  Thompson was ultimately convicted of possession of crack cocaine.Â Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State \r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). This court is bound \r\n  by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State \r\n  v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  A deferential \r\n  standard of review likewise applies in the context of a Fourth Amendment challenge \r\n  to a trial courtâ€™s fact-driven affirmation of probable cause.Â  State v. Brockman, \r\n  339 S.C. 57, 65-66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 665-666 (2000) (holding that whether a search \r\n  violated the parameters of the Fourth Amendment depends upon â€œa number of antecedent \r\n  determinations, each of which is inherently fact-specificâ€ and â€œentails an inquiry \r\n  into the totality of the circumstancesâ€ and the appellate court must affirm \r\n  if there is â€œany evidenceâ€ to support the ruling).Â  This appeal presents both \r\n  factual and legal challenges to the rulings of the trial court concerning the \r\n  search warrant.Â  Following Brockman, we adhere to the â€œany evidenceâ€ \r\n  standard of review with respect to the factual findings of the trial court. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Permissible Scope of Search Authorized Under the Warrant\r\nWe first address Thompsonâ€™s claim the warrant failed to describe \r\n  with sufficient particularity the person, place, or thing to be searched.Â  Though \r\n  we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding \r\n  that some portions of the warrant are overbroad, we further concur with the \r\n  trial court and find this fact does not render the entire warrant void or require \r\n  suppression of the evidence seized in this case.\r\nUnder both the United States and South Carolina constitutions, \r\n  search warrants may not be issued except â€œupon probable cause, supported by \r\n  Oath or affirmation,â€ and particularly describing the place to be searched and \r\n  the persons or things to be seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. \r\n  I, Â§ 10.Â  Following these constitutional requirements, South Carolina Code section \r\n  17-13-140 (2003) requires a search warrant be issued â€œonly upon affidavit sworn \r\n  to before the magistrate [or other judicial officer]â€ and only if the magistrate \r\n  â€œis satisfied that the grounds for the application exist or that there is probable \r\n  cause to believe that they exist . . . .â€Â  The magistrate issuing the search \r\n  warrant must â€œmake a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the \r\n  circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a fair probability that \r\n  contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.â€ Illinois \r\n  v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983). In reviewing the validity of a warrant, \r\n  an appellate court may consider only information brought to the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  attention.Â  State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522, 527, 556 S.E.2d. 706, 709 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nThe specific requirement that a search warrant particularly describe \r\n  the person, place, or thing to be searched â€œis aimed at preventing general warrantsâ€”those \r\n  authorizing â€˜a general, exploratory rummaging in a personâ€™s belongings.â€™â€ State \r\n  v. Williams, 297 S.C. 404, 407, 377 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1989) (quoting Coolidge \r\n  v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 467 (1971)). â€œâ€˜By limiting the authorization \r\n  to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause \r\n  to search, the requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored \r\n  to its justifications, and will not take on the character of the wide-ranging \r\n  exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit.â€™â€ Id. (quoting \r\n  Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79 (1987)).Â \r\nThompson claims the warrant issued in the present case veers \r\n  from the particularity requirement in three respects.Â  First, Thompson argues \r\n  that, by permitting the search of his â€œperson,â€ the warrant granted law enforcement \r\n  unlimited discretion to search him wherever or whenever they desired.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Thompson suggests that warrants may only authorize the search of â€œplacesâ€ and \r\n  â€œthings,â€ not individuals.Â  This argument is without merit.\r\nThough not as common as warrants for the search of places, \r\n  the propriety of warrants authorizing the search of persons is well settled \r\n  in the law.Â  South Carolina Code section 17-13-140, our state statute governing \r\n  the issuance and execution of search warrants, clearly authorizes the search \r\n  of a person. This section provides that â€œ[t]he property described in this section, \r\n  or any part thereof, may be seized from any place where such property may be \r\n  located, or from the person, possession or control of any person who \r\n  shall be found to have such property in his possession or under his control.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003) (emphasis added).Â  Indeed, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court has held that warrants authorizing the search of a person are \r\n  constitutional provided that â€œa search or seizure of a person must be supported \r\n  by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.â€ Ybarra v. \r\n  Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979).Â  Thus, there is no basis to conclude the \r\n  search warrant was invalid because it authorized the search of Thompsonâ€™s â€œperson.â€\r\nThompsonâ€™s second and third exceptions to the particularity of the \r\n  warrant concern two specific items subject to possible search and seizure under \r\n  the warrant.Â  Thompson claims the language contained in the warrant authorizing \r\n  the search of any transportation that he was riding in or on and any type of \r\n  luggage in his possession was not supported by probable cause.Â  We agree.Â \r\nAs quoted above, Phillipsâ€™ affidavit stated that his belief Thompson \r\n  was in possession of contraband was based on information from a confidential \r\n  informant that Thompson had been seen in the past 72 hours with quantity of \r\n  crack cocaine on his â€œperson.â€Â  No further information was provided in the affidavit, \r\n  and Phillips testified that the only additional information he provided the \r\n  magistrate was the fact that Thompson was the subject of an ongoing narcotics \r\n  investigation.Â \r\nThere is a substantial basis to support the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that the warrant was overbroad in its authorization \r\n  to search Thompsonâ€™s vehicle or luggage.Â  The information provided to the magistrate \r\n  only related to seeing crack cocaine on Thompsonâ€™s person. There was \r\n  no basis upon which the magistrate could conclude that probable cause existed \r\n  to search any vehicle Thompson was traveling in or on or any luggage in Thompsonâ€™s \r\n  possession.\r\nWe now turn to the legal question posed as a result of the finding \r\n  that the warrant was overly broad with respect to these specific provisions \r\n  concerning transportation and luggage.Â  We do not believe this finding renders \r\n  the search warrant invalid on the whole.Â  A contrary conclusion would mean that \r\n  the seizure of certain items, even though proper if viewed separately, must \r\n  be condemned merely because the warrant was defective with respect to other \r\n  items. Though this question of law has not been directly addressed by South \r\n  Carolina courts in our modern jurisprudence, we believe one of our supreme courtâ€™s \r\n  older precedents supports the principle of â€œseverability.â€Â  Moreover, such an \r\n  approach is widely recognized in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, in both federal \r\n  and state courts.Â  In essence, overbroad portions of a search warrant may be \r\n  â€œseveredâ€ from the portions for which probable cause is found to exist, thus \r\n  permitting the admission of evidence properly obtained.\r\nLooking first to our stateâ€™s law, we do find support for the concept \r\n  of severability.Â  In Farmer v. Sellers, 89 S.C. 492, 72 S.E. 224 (1911), \r\n  our supreme court found a warrant, which permitted a search to be conducted \r\n  by day or night, was valid regardless of a statute prohibiting nighttime searches.Â  \r\n  In that case, no search was conducted at night, and the court determined â€œthere \r\n  is therefore no ground to allege that the statute was violated.Â  If courts gave \r\n  heed to such extremely technical objections, the law would indeed be weak in \r\n  its struggle with crime.â€Â  Id. at 500, 72 S.E. at 227.Â  The supreme court \r\n  in Farmer thus implicitly recognized the propriety of admitting items \r\n  seized under valid provisions of a warrant supported by probable cause, despite \r\n  the fact that the warrant at issue was improper in other respects.\r\nOther states have applied the concept of severability under circumstances \r\n  directly analogous to the present case.Â  For example, in People v. Mangliano, \r\n  348 N.Y.S.2d 327 (1973), a seminal state court case addressing severability, \r\n  a New York trial court reviewed the validity of a search warrant authorizing \r\n  the police to search a suspectâ€™s home for illegal narcotics and associated paraphernalia \r\n  as well as â€œrecords, mail, correspondence and communications used in conjunction \r\n  with the sale or possession of any dangerous drugs.â€Â  Id. at 330.Â  The \r\n  court found the affidavit submitted to obtain the warrant did not establish \r\n  sufficient probable cause to justify the seizure of the â€œrecords, mail, correspondence \r\n  and communicationsâ€ listed in the warrant.Â  Rather than suppress all of the \r\n  evidence obtained under the warrant, the court elected to redact the latter \r\n  phrase from the warrant, thereby preserving from suppression all evidence seized \r\n  pursuant to the valid portions of the warrant.Â  The court concluded:\r\n\r\n[T]here is strong and persuasive authority in other \r\n  jurisdictions to permit a severance in order to save a warrant or a search. \r\n  This would seem to be supported by logic as well. If there was probable cause \r\n  to issue a search warrant describing particular items to be seized, and such \r\n  items are found and those items alone constitute the basis of the criminal charge, \r\n  there is no reason why some additional unsupported language in the search warrant, \r\n  while to be avoided, should not be severable, particularly where no items seized \r\n  thereunder are included as a basis for the criminal charge.\r\n\r\nId. at 337; see also, e.g., \r\n  State v. Noll, 343 N.W.2d 391, 396 (Wis. 1984) (concluding that â€œin cases \r\n  involving search warrants which are partially but not wholly defective, those \r\n  two interests are best accommodated by admitting those items seized pursuant \r\n  to the valid parts of the warrant and suppressing those items seized under the \r\n  invalid portionâ€); Butler v. State, 203 S.E.2d 558, 563 (Ga. App. 1973) \r\n  (holding that â€œ[w]here a search as it was actually conducted is lawful, it is \r\n  not rendered invalid merely because the warrant pursuant to which it was made \r\n  was overbroad or founded upon erroneous beliefsâ€) (internal citation omitted); \r\n  Aday v. Super. Ct. of Alameda County, 362 P.2d 47 (Cal. 1961) (widely \r\n  acknowledged as the leading state case adopting the doctrine of severability).Â \r\nWe also note that many federal courts, including the Fourth Circuit \r\n  Court of Appeals, have recognized and applied the theory of severability.Â  In \r\n  United States v. Jacob, 657 F.2d 49 (4th Cir. 1981), the court examined \r\n  whether items to be seized under a search warrant met the constitutional particularity \r\n  requirement.Â  The court noted that the overly broad portions of the warrant \r\n  describing the items to be seized were severable from those portions that met \r\n  the particularity requirement. [2] Â  Id. at 52.Â  Other \r\n  federal circuits have also recognized and applied the severability concept. \r\n  See United States v. George, 975 F.2d 72, 79 (2d Cir. 1992) \r\n  (holding that evidence seized pursuant to valid portion of a search warrant \r\n  may be admissible, even if part of the warrant is severed or redacted for lack \r\n  of particularity or probable cause); LeBron v. Vitek, 751 F.2d \r\n  311, 312 (8th Cir. 1985) (holding that the valid portion of a warrant \r\n  was severable from the invalid, over broad portion); United States \r\n  v. Offices Known as 50 State Distrib. Co., 708 F.2d 1371, 1375-76 (9th Cir. \r\n  1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1021 (1984) (noting that \r\n  â€œ[i]f probable cause was lacking as to the search of individuals, that does \r\n  not operate to render the warrant itself invalid in its entirety as a general \r\n  warrant. The remedy is not a return of all items seized but selective suppression \r\n  or return of the items improperly seized); United States v. Christine, \r\n  687 F.2d 749, 758 (3rd Cir. 1982) (holding that â€œ[r]edaction of a warrant \r\n  containing valid severable phrases or clauses is consistent with all five purposes \r\n  of the warrant requirementâ€); United States v. Cook, 657 F.2d \r\n  730, 735 (5th Cir. 1981) (opining that â€œ[w]e agree with the reasoning \r\n  of the . . . majority of state courts that have considered this question and \r\n  hold that in the usual case the district judge should sever the infirm portion \r\n  of the search warrant from so much of the warrant as passes constitutional musterâ€).\r\nFurthermore, review of authoritative treatises addressing this subject \r\n  further indicates the concept of severability has gained broad acceptance:\r\n\r\nIf a search warrant is issued to search a place \r\n  for several items, but it is later determined that not all of those items are \r\n  described with sufficient particularity or that probable cause does not exist \r\n  as to all of the items described, it is often possible to sever the tainted \r\n  portion of the warrant from the valid portion so that evidence found in the \r\n  execution of the latter will be admissible.\r\n\r\n2 Wayne R.

Searches and \r\n  Seizures Â§ 185 (Supp. 2004) (commenting that â€œ[w]here the description \r\n  in a search warrant of the items to be seized is in part insufficiently particular \r\n  or unsupported by probable cause, the warrant may sometimes be severed so as \r\n  to preserve the valid portionsâ€); 68 Am. Jur. 2d Searches and \r\n  Seizures Â§ 168 (2000) (observing that â€œstriking from a warrant those \r\n  severable phrases and clauses that are invalid for lack of probable cause and \r\n  preserving those phrases and clauses that satisfy the Fourth Amendment, is consistent \r\n  with the Fourth Amendment and should be used in order to avoid unnecessary social \r\n  costsâ€).\r\nIn the case at bar, we find the invalid portions of the warrant relating \r\n  to the search of Thompsonâ€™s vehicle and luggage are severable from the authorization \r\n  relating to the search of Thompsonâ€™s person.Â  Because the portion of the warrant \r\n  allowing the search of Thompsonâ€™s person remains valid, and because none of \r\n  the evidence sought to be suppressed was derived from the overbroad portions \r\n  of the warrant, we find Thompsonâ€™s request for suppression of this evidence \r\n  was properly denied.Â Â \r\nIn so holding we do not mean to suggest that invalid portions of a \r\n  warrant will be treated as severable under all circumstances. We are mindful \r\n  of the danger that warrants might be obtained which are essentially general \r\n  in character but arguably meet the particularity requirement in certain respects.Â  \r\n  We in no manner sanction wholesale seizures pursuant to questionable police \r\n  practices.Â  Our decision today is narrowly confined to those circumstances where, \r\n  as here, there exists good faith [3] â€”measured objectivelyâ€”on the part of \r\n  law enforcement and the valid portion of the warrant is amply supported by probable \r\n  cause.\r\nII.Â  Â Â Â  Staleness\r\nWe next address, and reject, Thompsonâ€™s claim that the information \r\n  contained in the affidavit supporting the warrant was stale, and therefore could \r\n  not have been the basis of a finding of probable cause.\r\nIn order for an affidavit to support probable cause, â€œit \r\n  must state facts so closely related to the time of the issuance of the warrant \r\n  as to justify a finding of probable cause at that time.â€ State v. Winborne, \r\n  273 S.C. 62, 64, 254 S.E.2d 297, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\n  â€œAn affidavit which fails altogether to state the time of the occurrence of \r\n  the facts alleged is insufficient.â€ Id.Â \r\nThere is, however, no fixed standard or formula establishing a maximum \r\n  allowable interval between the date of events recited in an affidavit and the \r\n  date of a search warrant.Â  United States v. McCall, 740 F.2d 1331, 1336 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1984).Â  This court has explained that the acceptable length of time \r\n  between the establishment of probable cause and the execution of the warrant \r\n  depends on a variety of case-specific factors:\r\n\r\nWhile the lapse of time involved is an important \r\n  consideration and may in some cases be controlling, it is not necessarily so. \r\n  There are other factors to be considered, including the nature of the criminal \r\n  activity involved, and the kind of property for which authority to search is \r\n  sought.\r\n\r\nState v. Corns, 310 S.C. 546, 550-51, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  324, 326 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting United States v. Steeves, 525 F.2d \r\n  33 (8th Cir.1975)).\r\nThe record in this case contains ample support for the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s rejection of Thompsonâ€™s assertion that the circumstances providing probable \r\n  cause for the search had grown stale by the time the warrant was executed. The \r\n  affidavit provides that the informant had observed Thompson in possession of \r\n  crack cocaine within the past 72 hours.Â  The affidavit was sworn on \r\n  the same day the magistrate issued the warrant, and Officer Phillips executed \r\n  the warrant the day after it was issued.Â Â  Additionally, the record \r\n  reveals that the information received from the informant was not an isolated \r\n  incident. Phillips testified that he informed the magistrate that Thompson was \r\n  the subject of an ongoing narcotics investigation conducted during the several \r\n  months prior to obtaining the warrant.\r\nGiven the continuous nature of the alleged drug activity, we find the \r\n  record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that it was reasonable for the magistrate \r\n  to conclude that Thompson would be found in possession of illegal substances.Â  \r\n  Although isolated sales of narcotics unquestionably occur, it is generally recognized \r\n  that â€œnarcotics conspiracies are the very paradigm of the continuing enterprises \r\n  for which the courts have relaxed the temporal requirements of non-staleness.â€ \r\n  United States v. Rowell, 903 F.2d 899, 903 (2d Cir. 1990) (quotation \r\n  marks and citation omitted); see also Donaldson v. State, \r\n  420 A.2d 281, 286 (Md. Ct. App. 1980) (noting that the selling of drugs, by \r\n  its nature, is an ongoing activity).Â  Considering the informantâ€™s report of \r\n  Thompsonâ€™s drug possession together with Phillipsâ€™ testimony that Thompson was \r\n  the subject of an ongoing narcotics investigation did not suggest an isolated \r\n  incident, but rather described a probable continuing course of illegal drug \r\n  activity. We concur, therefore, with the trial court that the probable cause \r\n  predicate, which supported the issuance of the warrant, continued to exist at \r\n  the time of its execution.\r\nIII.Â  Â  Bodily Intrusion\r\nFinally, we address Thompsonâ€™s argument that the search \r\n  warrant was invalid because it improperly authorized a bodily intrusion or a \r\n  strip search.Â  Specifically, Thompson contends the warrantâ€™s authorization to \r\n  search his mouth and undergarments rendered the warrant invalid because the \r\n  warrant did not set forth specific findings required to justify a bodily intrusion \r\n  as required under In re Snyder, 308 S.C. 192, 417 S.E.2d 572 (1992).Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn In re Snyder, our supreme court held that \r\n  South Carolina Code section 17-13-140 (search warrant statute) provides for \r\n  the involuntary submission of nontestimonial identification evidence, and the \r\n  court set forth guidelines and procedures for obtaining samples of blood and \r\n  saliva, along with head and pubic hair, from unarrested suspects in criminal \r\n  investigations.Â  In the present case, the search did not authorize the collection \r\n  of any bodily fluids, tissue samples, or other such physical evidence for which \r\n  a bodily intrusion would be required. The warrant in this case merely authorized \r\n  the search of Thompsonâ€™s mouth and undergarments in connection with the search \r\n  of his person for illegal drugs.Â  Therefore, the search of these areas did not \r\n  rise to the level of the type of bodily intrusion contemplated under In re \r\n  Snyder.Â  \r\nMoreover, our supreme court has held that the search of a suspectâ€™s mouth is \r\n  appropriate in order to prevent a suspectâ€™s attempts to destroy evidence by \r\n  swallowing it, because â€œhe cannot consider the mouth a â€˜sacred orificeâ€™ in which \r\n  contraband may be irretrievably concealed from the police.â€ Â State v. Dupree, \r\n  319 S.C. 454, 458, 462 S.E.2d 279, 282 (1995) (quoting State v. Williams, \r\n  560 P.2d 1160, 1162 (Wash. App. 1977)).Â  Therefore, the magistrate could properly \r\n  conclude there was a reasonable probability that the crack cocaine may be found \r\n  in Thompsonâ€™s mouth as part of his person.Â  \r\nWe also note that when the police searched Thompsonâ€™s undergarments he had \r\n  already been placed under arrest and taken to the police department.Â  It is \r\n  well settled that, in the case of a lawful custodial arrest, the full search \r\n  of a person does not require a search warrant and is considered reasonable under \r\n  the Fourth Amendment.Â  State v. Ferrell, 274 S.C. 401, 409, 266 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1980).Â  Therefore, the validity \r\n  of the warrant with regard to the search of Thompsonâ€™s undergarments was of \r\n  no consequence because the search conducted was a valid search incident to arrest.Â Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that: (1) although portions of the search warrant issued were overbroad \r\n  in certain respects, this fact does not render the warrant wholly invalid; \r\n  (2) the search warrant was issued and executed in a timely manner; \r\n  and (3) the warrant did not authorize an unreasonable bodily intrusion.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s denial of Thompsonâ€™s motion to suppress the drug evidence \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â \r\nHUFF and BEATTY, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] Â Contrary to Phillipsâ€™ testimony, it is clear that Thompson \r\n    was under arrest when he was first detained in the convenience store parking \r\n    lot.Â  The determination of whether an individual is under arrest is measured \r\n    objectively, and the subjective view of the particular officer is not controlling. \r\n    See Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 323 (1994) (opining \r\n    that â€œ[o]ur decisions make clear that the initial determination of custody \r\n    depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective \r\n    views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questionedâ€). \r\n    When Thompson was detained in the parking lot, following seizure of the suspected \r\n    contraband, he was so substantially deprived of his freedom of movement as \r\n    to constitute a full custodial arrest. See Park v. Shiflett, \r\n    250 F.3d 843, 850 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding that â€œ[t]he test for determining \r\n    whether an individual is in custody or under arrest is whether, under the \r\n    totality of the circumstances, the suspectâ€™s freedom of action is curtailed \r\n    to a degree associated with formal arrestâ€ (internal quotation marks omitted)). \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  [2]  The court in that case, however, found \r\n    the entire warrant met the particularity requirement, defeating the need for \r\n    severance.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  [3] Â See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 \r\n    (1984) (adopting the â€œgood faith exceptionâ€ to the exclusionary rule under \r\n    which admission of evidence will not be barred where the evidence was obtained \r\n    by officers who â€œmanifest[ed] objective good faithâ€ in relying on a search \r\n    warrant issued by a detached, neutral magistrate even though the warrant was \r\n    ultimately found to be invalid).Â  This good faith exception, however, may \r\n    not be employed to validate a warrant that is based on an affidavit that â€œdoes \r\n    not provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence \r\n    of probable cause.â€ State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 248, 395 S.E.2d \r\n    167, 170 (1990) (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 915).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3938","title":"State v.

Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Ernest \r\n  Yarborough was convicted of obstruction of justice in 1997.Â  He appealed, and \r\n  our court remanded the issue of jury misconduct to the extent that premature \r\n  deliberations were alleged.Â  On remand, the trial court denied Yarboroughâ€™s \r\n  request for a new trial, finding Yarborough had not made a prima facie \r\n  showing that premature deliberations had occurred.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nErnest Yarborough, an attorney, was convicted \r\n  of obstruction of justice for offering an alleged victim $500 to drop charges \r\n  against his client.Â  Before being sentenced, Yarborough requested a new trial, \r\n  alleging juror misconduct in two respects.Â  First, he argued the jurors improperly \r\n  discussed a compromise verdict, and second, he argued the jurors deliberated \r\n  prematurely.Â  To support these allegations, Yarborough sought to offer the testimony \r\n  of juror Teresa Mobley and the affidavit of juror Keisha Foster, but the trial \r\n  court refused to consider evidence of the allegations.Â  However, the court sealed \r\n  the affidavit of juror Foster for the record.Â  Fosterâ€™s affidavit suggests the \r\n  jurors may have compromised on the verdict, whereby a group of jurors agreed \r\n  to vote guilty on one charge in exchange for a not guilty verdict on another \r\n  charge.Â  The affidavit does not allege that any premature deliberations took \r\n  place.Â  \r\nYarborough was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended on the service of six months, two years probation, and payment of \r\n  $1,000 in costs and assessments.Â  He appealed. \r\nThis court found the trial court committed no error \r\n  in refusing to hear evidence regarding the juryâ€™s alleged discussion of a compromise \r\n  verdict.Â  State v. Yarborough, Op. No. 2000-UP-059 (Ct. App. 2000) (hereinafter \r\n  â€œYarborough Iâ€). However, we found the trial court could have considered \r\n  evidence of premature deliberations.Â  Id. Specifically, our court stated:\r\n\r\nOur supreme court recently held that â€œpremature deliberations may affect fundamental \r\n  fairness.â€Â  State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 312, 509 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1999).Â  \r\n  . . . \r\nThe Aldret case sets forth procedures for trial courts to use in cases \r\n  where premature deliberations are alleged.Â  If, as here, the allegations of \r\n  premature deliberations are raised after the jury renders its verdict the trial \r\n  court may consider juror affidavits concerning the misconduct.Â  Aldret, \r\n  333 S.C. at 315, 509 S.E.2d at 815.Â  Furthermore:\r\n  \r\nIf the court finds the affidavits are credible and indicate premature deliberations \r\n  occurred, the court should hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether \r\n  such deliberations did in fact occur.Â  The court may, upon the complaining partyâ€™s \r\n  request, â€œreassemble the jurors and conduct voir dire to ascertain the \r\n  nature and extent of premature deliberations.â€Â  If the court concludes the misconduct \r\n  did not occur or did not prejudice the party alleging misconduct, the court \r\n  should make adequate findings to enable a review of the decision. If the court \r\n  is convinced misconduct occurred but cannot conduct an adequate inquiry because \r\n  of the passage of time, the court may order a new trial.\r\n  \r\nId. at 315-316, 509 S.E.2d at 815.\r\n\r\nYarborough I.\r\nBased on that analysis, our court remanded the issue of premature jury deliberations \r\n  to the trial court â€œfor consideration pursuant to Aldret.â€ [1] Â  Id.\r\nOn remand, Yarborough sought to compel the testimony \r\n  of two witnesses, Keisha Foster and Marcy Benson.Â  Although they had been subpoenaed, [2]  both failed to appear.Â  \r\n  Yarborough wanted Foster, the juror who previously alleged the jury had compromised \r\n  on the verdict, to testify regarding the alleged premature deliberations. As \r\n  to Benson, Yarborough claimed that her testimony would demonstrate that she \r\n  told Foster not to participate in the case.Â  The trial court denied the motion \r\n  to compel the attendance of Foster or Benson.Â  \r\nBecause his motion to compel was denied, Yarborough \r\n  moved for a continuance to obtain affidavits from other jurors.Â  This motion \r\n  was also denied because from the time of the original motion for a new trial \r\n  to the remand hearing in 2003, Yarborough did nothing to obtain jurorsâ€™ affidavits.Â  \r\n  Yarborough claimed he was prevented from obtaining additional affidavits because \r\n  of a letter that an Assistant Attorney General sent to the trial court judge \r\n  on April 2, 1997, three days before the hearing on Yarboroughâ€™s original motion \r\n  for a new trial.Â  The letter advised the trial court judge that Yarborough was \r\n  contacting jurors, and asked that the judge prohibit him from doing so until \r\n  the judge made a determination that that such contact was warranted.Â  However, \r\n  the trial court did not sympathize with Yarboroughâ€™s purported predicament, \r\n  finding that â€œ[n]o reasonable experienced lawyer would have ceased an investigation \r\n  that he believed to be appropriate based upon receipt of a copy of such a letter \r\n  to the court.â€ \r\nFinally, Yarborough moved for a new trial based on the allegations of premature jury deliberations, the passage of time (which resulted in a lack of witnessesâ€™ memory or availability), and fundamental fairness. The trial court denied the motion, finding that, pursuant to Aldret, Yarborough failed to present affidavits to establish a prima facie showing of premature deliberations. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court reviews errors \r\n  of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless clearly \r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); \r\n  State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d 61, 65 (1973); State \r\n  v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nYarborough \r\n  appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motions to compel, for a continuance, \r\n  and for a new trial.Â  He also asserts the trial court erred in refusing to grant \r\n  him an evidentiary hearing.Â  We disagree with each of his assertions.\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidentiary Hearing and Motion to Compel \r\nYarborough contends the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to compel the attendance and testimony of juror Foster pursuant to the remand.Â  \r\n  He further argues that, pursuant to Aldret, the trial court should have \r\n  conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether premature deliberations \r\n  occurred.\r\nâ€œA trial court . . . has inherent power to require the appearance of witnesses even as counsel for either side may require the presence and testimony of witnesses.â€ Â Greenwood Lumber Co. v. Cromer, 225 S.C. 375, 383, 82 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1954).Â  However, Aldret does not require the trial court to hear juror testimony whenever there is an allegation of premature deliberations.Â  333 S.C. at 312-16, 509 S.E.2d at 813-15.Â  According to Aldret, the trial court â€œmay consider affidavits when inquiring into allegations of premature jury deliberations.â€Â  333 S.C. at 312-313, 509 S.E.2d at 813.Â  Then, â€œ[i]f the trial court finds the affidavits credible, and indicative of premature deliberations, an evidentiary hearing should be held to assess whether such deliberations in fact occurred, and whether they affected the verdict.â€Â  Id. at 315, 509 S.E.2d at 815 (emphasis added).\r\nIn Yarborough I, we remanded the issue of premature jury deliberations and instructed the trial court to follow the procedure set forth in Aldret.Â  Based on the record, the trial court did just that.Â  It considered the affidavit of juror Foster, which makes no allegation of premature deliberations.Â Â  Because Yarborough failed to produce any other affidavit, he made no showing to the trial court that premature deliberations occurred; [3]  thus, the trial court did not err by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing.Â  Moreover, because an evidentiary hearing was not warranted, there was no reason to compel the appearance of juror Foster; thus the trial court did not err by refusing to grant Yarboroughâ€™s motion to compel.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion for Continuance\r\nYarborough also contends the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to grant his motion for a continuance â€œafter a crucial witness failed to appear.â€Â  \r\n  The granting of a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear showing of an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  State v. White, 311 S.C. 289, 293, 428 S.E.2d 740, 742 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Reversals of refusals of continuances â€œare about as rare as the proverbial hensâ€™ teeth.â€Â  State v. McMilian, 349 S.C. 17, 21, 561 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2002) (citation omitted) (stating this comparison, but ultimately reversing the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a continuance).Â  The party asking for the continuance must show due diligence was used in trying to procure the testimony of an absent witness as well as set forth what the party believes the absent witness will testify to and the grounds for that belief.Â  See White, 311 S.C. at 293, 428 S.E.2d at 742-43; see also Rule 7(b), SCCrimP (explaining that a motion for continuance to procure the testimony of a witness will not be granted unless the party seeking the testimony made use of due diligence to procure the testimony).\r\nYarborough submits the trial court should have granted the continuance â€œto counter the surprise that was fostered by Juror Fosterâ€™s sudden decision not to cooperate, or, to give the court time to force Juror Foster to appear and testify.â€Â  Yarboroughâ€™s argument fails because, as explained above, no evidentiary hearing was warranted, and therefore juror Foster was not needed to testify. [4] Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant Yarboroughâ€™s motion for continuance.\r\n  III.&nbsp;  Motion for a New Trial\r\nFinally, Yarborough argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a new trial based on the passage of time or based on other claims of fundamental fairness.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, the denial of a new trial motion will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, 163, 539 S.E.2d 67, 69 (citing State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993)).Â  \r\n\r\n  a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n  Passage of Time\r\n\r\nAgain relying on Aldret, Yarborough suggests the significant amount \r\n  of time that has passed since the alleged premature jury deliberations justifies \r\n  a new trial.Â  However, a new trial based on the passage of time is only warranted \r\n  if the trial court â€œis convinced premature deliberations did, in fact, occur, \r\n  but finds it impossible to conduct an adequate post-trial inquiry due to the \r\n  passage of time . . . .â€Â  Aldret, 333 S.C. at 316, 509 S.E.2d at 815.Â  \r\n  The affidavit of Foster was insufficient even to support further inquiry into \r\n  the matter.Â  If the trial court did not conclude an evidentiary hearing was \r\n  necessary, it clearly was not convinced any premature deliberations occurred.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant \r\n  Yarboroughâ€™s motion for a new trial based on the passage of time. \r\n\r\n  b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n  Fundamental Fairness\r\n\r\nYarborough also asserts he was denied fundamental fairness \r\n  based on discussions of his possible sentences during the deliberation.Â  Again, \r\n  he relies on the affidavit of Foster to support allegations of these discussions.Â  \r\n  He argues the trial court erred in refusing to consider this claim because this \r\n  court â€œinferentially remandedâ€ the issue in Yarborough I.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Yarborough I, we held that â€œ[a]lthough the \r\n  trial court . . . stated it could not consider the evidence concerning allegations \r\n  of premature deliberations presented by the defense, the Aldret case \r\n  finds such evidence may be admissible.Â  We remand this issue to the trial court \r\n  for consideration pursuant to Aldret.â€Â  In no way does our remand imply \r\n  that the trial court should consider any issue other than premature deliberations.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the trial court properly denied the motion for a new trial based \r\n  on fundamental fairness reasons.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did not err in denying Yarboroughâ€™s \r\n  motion to compel, his motion for a continuance, his request for an evidentiary \r\n  hearing, or his motion for a new trial.Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOSLBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n [1]  The trial court did not have the benefit of the Aldret opinion when ruling on Yarboroughâ€™s motion for a new trial.\r\n [2]  From the affidavit of the process server, Foster may never have received the subpoena, which appears to have been discarded by the adult upon whom he had served it.Â  \r\n [3]  Yarborough suggests State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, 539 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 2000), supports his contention that the trial court should have compelled testimony through an evidentiary hearing.Â  Yarborough misinterprets Covington, in which the trial court reassembled jurors and heard their testimony after the supreme court found the affidavits of two of the jurors were competent evidence and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing.Â Â  343 S.C. at 159-60, 539 S.E.2d at 68.Â  Here, no affidavits indicate juror misconduct in the form of premature deliberations.\r\n [4]  Yarborough does not argue on appeal that he needed more time to obtain more affidavits from jurors as he claimed at trial. However, that claim would also fail based on his inability to show due diligence in obtaining more affidavits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3939","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  After a jury convicted him of murder, Rorey \r\n  Jamar Johnson was granted a new trial based on an improper reference by a Stateâ€™s \r\n  witness to a polygraph exam.Â  The State appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRorey Jamar Johnson was charged with the murder of Gregory Whitaker \r\n  who was fatally shot in the upper left shoulder while sitting in a car.Â  \r\n  At trial, the State presented three witnesses who testified to having been \r\n  at the scene of the shooting.Â  The first witness to testify was Crystal Marion.Â  \r\n  She testified she was a prostitute and friend of the victim.Â  The night of the \r\n  incident she got into a car with Alton â€œBlackâ€ Henderson, Johnson, and a young \r\n  driver she did not know. Â The three of them drove to see the victim to \r\n  sell him some drugs. The victim was sitting alone in a car and very intoxicated.Â  \r\n  After they spoke to the victim, he got out of the car on the driverâ€™s side.Â  \r\n  The victim and Johnson discussed getting some â€œweed,â€ but then the victim admitted \r\n  he did not have any money and got back into his car.Â Â  Marion testified she \r\n  saw Johnson get into a â€œbrown carâ€ before she left the area.Â  \r\nThereafter, when Marion returned later, she stood next to the brown \r\n  car talking to Henderson and Michael Jones and heard a gunshot. Johnson then \r\n  ran up to her from behind the victimâ€™s car with a pistol in his hand.Â  She testified \r\n  that she and Johnson jumped into the brown car with Henderson and Jones and \r\n  left. Â They subsequently let her out of the car, and she stopped two \r\n  police officers who took her to police headquarters to make a statement. \r\nMarion testified she gave a statement to the police but it was not \r\n  the truth.Â  She said she lied in the first statement because she was afraid \r\n  for her disabled parents.Â  She stated she knew the victim but not Johnson. Â She \r\n  testified that she later gave the police two more statements.Â  While being questioned \r\n  about her statements the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\nThe State:Â  And you, in fact, later on gave another written statement \r\n  to the police; is that right?\r\nMarion:Â  Which was based on the truth. Thatâ€™s right.\r\nThe State:Â  In fact, ultimately, you gave the police three statements \r\n  about the incident; is that correct?\r\nMarion:Â  Uh-huh.\r\nThe State:Â  Okay.Â  And it was during this final interview, final \r\n  statement when you told the complete truth on this matter; is that correct?\r\nMarion:Â  Well, the second statement was the truth as well, but, therefore, they \r\n  kind of made me feel like I was lying because I didnâ€™t pass the polygraph test.Â  \r\n  And the second one --\r\n\r\nAt this point, Johnsonâ€™s counsel objected.Â  \r\nCounsel requested a mistrial due to Marionâ€™s statement that she did \r\n  not pass the polygraph.Â  He argued that the mere mention would imply to the \r\n  jury that her testimony was truthful because of the implication that she had \r\n  since passed a polygraph. Â Additionally, counsel argued that the \r\n  fact she had been polygraphed could lead the jury to believe not only that her \r\n  testimony she was truthful, but that the other witnesses may also have passed \r\n  a polygraph before testifying.Â  The State requested a curative charge and stated \r\n  that there would be no further mention or argument relating to the results of \r\n  the polygraph.Â Â  The trial judge denied the motion for a mistrial and gave the \r\n  following curative instruction:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, our United States Supreme Court \r\n  and State Supreme Court have both ruled that polygraph tests are not admissible \r\n  in court because they are not accepted scientifically as being accurate.Â  So \r\n  I would instruct you to disregard any â€“ they are not reliable.Â  So I would instruct \r\n  you to disregard any reference that anybody has made in regard to any polygraph \r\n  examinations or anything of that nature.Â  And completely dismiss that from your \r\n  mind and not let that influence you in anyway [sic].Â  Our United States Supreme \r\n  Court has ruled in the last year or two on a new case that they were not reliable.\r\n\r\nThere was no further mention of a polygraph test.\r\nThe State presented two additional witnesses that were present at \r\n  the shooting.Â  Alton â€œBlackâ€ Henderson testified he saw Johnson go up to the \r\n  car carrying the victim and fire a shot into the car.Â  When Henderson was brought \r\n  to the police station he made two statements.Â  On cross-examination, he stated \r\n  he told the truth in both statements but went into more detail in the second \r\n  statement.Â  He testified that when he first spoke to police he claimed he had \r\n  not seen the shooting. Â Additionally, he admitted he did not tell the \r\n  police he left with Johnson and Jones that night.Â  On the stand, Henderson testified \r\n  he saw Johnson use a large revolver to shoot the victim.Â  \r\nMichael Jones testified he was sitting in the brown car when he heard \r\n  the gunshot.Â  He saw Johnson coming to the car with a brown handle that looked \r\n  like a gun. Â Johnson and Marion got in the car and left.Â  Jones dropped \r\n  Marion and Henderson off and went back to his house with Johnson.Â  Jones testified \r\n  he saw Johnson the next day and Johnson told him he had shot a man. Â After \r\n  Jones met with the police he told them to go to his house and the gun would \r\n  be there.Â Â  The police did not find the gun.Â  On cross-examination, Johnson \r\n  testified he deliberately lied to the police about having the gun because he \r\n  knew Johnson was coming to the house and because he wanted the police to go \r\n  to his house and â€œcatch [Johnson].â€Â  Marion, Henderson, and Jones were all initially \r\n  charged with murder in connection with the shooting.Â  At the time of the trial, \r\n  Henderson and Jones had pled to lesser charges.\r\n Detective Mark White testified about the investigation.Â  He stated \r\n  they never found a gun.Â  When asked what the benefit of finding the gun would \r\n  be, he answered, â€œ[w]e would have been able to compare the bullet to the weapon.â€ \r\n  Â White was asked on cross-examination whether the projectiles or bullets \r\n  could be sent to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and examined \r\n  by firearms experts to determine caliber.Â  White testified the projectile found \r\n  in the console of the car was sent to SLED for analysis, but he did not recall \r\n  what the caliber was. \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, counsel for Johnson renewed \r\n  the motion for a mistrial â€œbased on the testimony of Ms. Marion, specifically, \r\n  when she made the reference to her having failed the polygraph.â€Â  The trial \r\n  court denied the motion.Â  After Johnson rested, counsel again renewed his motion \r\n  for a mistrial â€œon the basis of Ms. Marionâ€™s comments about failing the polygraph \r\n  . . . . â€ Â The trial court again denied the motion.\r\nIn the course of deliberations, the jury sent out a question indicating \r\n  it might be considering accomplice liability.Â  In discussing the question with \r\n  counsel, the trial court stated, â€œThe facts of this case are he either shot \r\n  him or he didnâ€™t.Â  There is no accomplice liability in this case. . . . Because \r\n  the facts do not support accomplice liability because theyâ€™ve already charged \r\n  the other two with accessory.Â  So it canâ€™t be accomplice liability.â€Â  The jury \r\n  returned to the courtroom for an additional instruction.Â  \r\nThe jury found Johnson guilty of murder.Â  Johnsonâ€™s \r\n  counsel moved for a new trial on grounds of the denial of his motions for directed \r\n  verdict and, specifically, the denial of the motion for a mistrial following \r\n  Marionâ€™s reference to the polygraph test.Â  The trial court took the motion under \r\n  advisement overnight.Â  After listening to arguments by counsel, the trial court \r\n  granted the motion for a new trial.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n The State \r\n  argues the trial court abused its discretion in granting a motion for a new \r\n  trial after a conviction for murder.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the criminal court, the only post verdict fact-based remedy available \r\n  is a motion for a new trial.Â  State v. Taylor, 348 S.C. 152, 158, 558 \r\n  S.E.2d 917, 919 (Ct. App. 2001) (citingÂ  State v. Miller, 287 S.C. 280, \r\n  285, 337 S.E.2d 883, 886 (1985) (Ness, J., concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part (citation omitted)).Â  The State may appeal the grant of a new trial \r\n  when it appears it is based â€œwholly upon an error of law.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Dasher,&nbsp;278 S.C. 395, 400, 297 S.E.2d 414, 417&nbsp;(1982) (emphasis \r\n  in original) (finding that â€œ[t]he trial judge did not exercise a power to grant \r\n  a new trial upon the facts, but rather set aside the verdict of the jury in \r\n  the face of conflicting facts and substituted his judgment for that of the jury. \r\n  In doing so, he committed an error of law, from which the State had a right \r\n  to appealâ€). Â â€œThe granting or refusal of a motion for a new trial is within \r\n  the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse \r\n  of discretion.â€Â  State v. Simmons, 279 S.C. 165, 166, 303 S.E.2d 857, \r\n  858 (1983) (citation omitted). \r\nIn this case, the primary evidence of Johnsonâ€™s guilt was the testimony \r\n  of three witnesses to the incident, and their credibility was critical to the \r\n  juryâ€™s decision.Â  Moreover, each witness gave some form of inconsistent statement \r\n  to the police.Â  The trial judge denied Johnsonâ€™s initial motion for a mistrial \r\n  on grounds of polygraph testimony but issued a thorough curative instruction.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, following testimony of the other witnesses, who also gave inconsistent \r\n  statements, Johnson renewed his motion for a mistrial on grounds of the polygraph \r\n  testimony, which was denied.Â  However, following the guilty verdict, the trial \r\n  judge granted Johnsonâ€™s motion for a mistrial on grounds of the polygraph testimony, \r\n  stating:\r\n\r\nAnd it was brought up that sheâ€™d given three statements, I believe it was.Â  \r\n  And the jury knew that she passed the polygraph test.Â  I mean they didnâ€™t know \r\n  whether sheâ€™d passed the test or not, but she said she didnâ€™t pass the polygraph \r\n  test.Â  Well, that was the first witness.Â  And I didnâ€™t know what effect that \r\n  was going to have on the trial anyway because I didnâ€™t know what the other witnesses \r\n  â€“ or what the evidence was.Â  But it appears that this whole case boils down \r\n  to the statements of these witnesses.\r\n. . . .\r\nAnd then as it turned out, unbeknownst to the court, the Defendant did not take \r\n  the witness stand.Â  And thatâ€™s his constitutional right.Â  And of course, no \r\n  comments can be made about him not taking the witness stand.Â  But that was the \r\n  problem about these polygraphs, and the inconsistent statements, and the fact \r\n  that the other defendants were allowed to plea in order to testify against this \r\n  Defendant to convict him.\r\n. . . .\r\nBut I think the polygraph just was magnified because the jury could have inferred, \r\n  and I believe thereâ€™s a strong likelihood that that was the case based on the \r\n  intelligence and the questions of the jury, that all these witnesses had taken \r\n  polygraph tests, that the State had decided to let the other people plead to \r\n  what they did and put their testimony in as truth.Â  The solicitor argued strongly \r\n  that they were telling the truth.Â  And that â€“ the conclusion was after they \r\n  stayed out and deliberated for some time that [Johnson] was the trigger-man.Â  \r\n  And I believe it all resulted from the polygraph tests and from all the evidence \r\n  as a whole. \r\n\r\nâ€œEvidence regarding the results of a polygraph test or the defendantâ€™s \r\n  willingness or refusal to submit to one is inadmissible.â€Â Â  See, e.g. \r\n  State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 90, 512 S.E.2d 795, 801&nbsp;(1999) (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  â€œMention of a polygraph test might arise in any one of many ways. \r\n  The safer course would normally be to avoid any mention of a polygraph examination.Â  \r\n  If such is brought out in the testimony, the trial judge should be meticulous \r\n  to see that no improper inference is created.â€Â  State v. McGuire,&nbsp; \r\n  272 S.C. 547, 551, 253 S.E.2d 103, 105&nbsp;(1979) (citation omitted).Â  However, \r\n  the mere mention of a polygraph test does not always automatically result in \r\n  error.Â  A curative instruction can cure any possible prejudice caused by the \r\n  polygraph testimony.Â  See Johnson, 334 S.C. at 90, 512 S.E.2d \r\n  at 801. \r\n A curative instruction given following a witnessâ€™s reference to a \r\n  polygraph test is not adequate where the reference is likely to impress a jury \r\n  to the extent that the curative instruction does not overcome the prejudicial \r\n  effect.Â  See United States v. Tedder, 801 F.2d 1437, 1444 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1986).Â  In ruling on a motion for a new trial based on the prejudicial \r\n  effect of incompetent testimony, even following a curative instruction, the \r\n  trial judge must consider other testimony in the case.Â  See State \r\n  v. Singleton, 167 S.C. 543, 548, 166 S.E.2d 725, 727 (1932) (finding the \r\n  trial judge did not err in refusing to grant a new trial on grounds of hearsay \r\n  testimony, when other testimony warranted a conviction).Â  The Fourth Circuit \r\n  has set forth two factors to consider in reviewing whether a curative instruction \r\n  or a mistrial is an appropriate response to a reference to a polygraph: â€œ(1) \r\n  whether an inference about the result of the test may be critical in assessing \r\n  the witnessâ€™s credibility, and (2) whether the witnessâ€™s credibility is vital \r\n  to the case.â€Â  United States v. Brevard, 739 F.2d 180, 182 (4th Cir. \r\n  1984) (citation omitted).Â  We find these factors helpful in reviewing the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s grant of a new trial in this case.Â  \r\nIn granting the new trial, the trial judge determined that the prejudicial \r\n  effect of the polygraph testimony was not overcome by his initial curative instruction.Â  \r\n  He stated that because Marion was the first witness and mentioned her polygraph \r\n  results, the jury could infer that the other witnesses also took polygraph tests \r\n  and the results of those tests affected their testimony.Â Â  We agree, and pursuant \r\n  to the factors set forth in Brevard, we find the polygraph testimony \r\n  was critical in assessing Marionâ€™s credibility, which affected the credibility \r\n  of the other witnesses who also gave inconsistent statements.Â  Further, we find \r\n  Marionâ€™s credibility and the credibility of the other witnesses were vital elements \r\n  in the Stateâ€™s case.Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, \r\n  the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in granting Johnson a new trial, \r\n  and the decision of the trial court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3940","title":"State v.

[1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAround 1:15 p.m. on September 21, 2000, nine-month-old Jaquan Perry presented \r\n  at the Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital emergency room in full cardiopulmonary \r\n  arrest.Â  After medical personnel placed the infant on a ventilator, medicated \r\n  him to maintain his blood pressure, and repeatedly attempted to resuscitate \r\n  him, they pronounced him dead at 4:20 p.m.Â  During treatment, CT scans were \r\n  performed and x-rays were obtained.Â  The tests revealed injuries throughout \r\n  Jaquanâ€™s abdomenâ€”including internal bleeding, bruises to the liver, bowels, \r\n  pancreas, and little blood flow to the kidneys, spleen, and liver.\r\nThe police investigated Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  Columbia police officer Joe Smith \r\n  interviewed hospital personnel about Jaquanâ€™s injuries.Â  When Officer \r\n  Smith talked with Jaquanâ€™s mother, Ikeisha Perry, she told Smith that Jaquan \r\n  fell from a bed.Â  In her written statement, Perry declared she picked Jaquan \r\n  up, comforted him, and brought him with her while she ran errands.Â  Perry said \r\n  she noticed something was wrong when they left the dentistâ€™s office.Â  She could \r\n  not hear Jaquanâ€™s heart beating.Â  Perry then drove Jaquan to the hospital.Â  \r\n  Her live-in friend, Henry Fletcher, attempted CPR as she drove to the hospital.\r\nWhen asked by Officer Smith whether she had ever beaten or spanked Jaquan, \r\n  Perry claimed she had â€œpoppedâ€ Jaquan but â€œ[a]s far as beating him to bruise \r\n  him, no I havenâ€™t.â€Â  Perry admitted Jaquan had been handcuffed to a bedpost.\r\nFletcher provided statements to the police.Â  In the first of two statements, \r\n  Fletcher said Jaquan fell out of the bed on the morning of September 21, 2000.Â  \r\n  He noted: Jaquan did not â€œlook rightâ€ when they left the dentistâ€™s office; they \r\n  did not hear Jaquanâ€™s heartbeat; and they drove to the hospital immediately, \r\n  with Fletcher attempting to resuscitate Jaquan on the way.Â  Fletcher maintained \r\n  that sometimes he would â€œplay fightâ€ with Jaquan.Â  In a later statement, Fletcher \r\n  denied ever hitting Jaquan, but admitted he put some of his weight on Jaquan \r\n  when they wrestled although he was not sure if doing so hurt Jaquan.Â  Fletcher \r\n  professed he hit Jaquan twice with his fists.Â  At trial, Fletcher testified \r\n  this statement was made in a sarcastic tone and was not meant to be taken as \r\n  truth.\r\nAs part of the investigation, the police executed a search warrant of the home \r\n  in which Perry and Fletcher lived.Â  They seized a pair of handcuffs, went into \r\n  the attic, and took photographs of the residence.\r\nFletcher and Perry were both arrested and charged with homicide by \r\n  child abuse.Â  They were indicted and tried. [2] Â  Before jury selection, the trial court heard several motions, \r\n  including motions to exclude evidence of prior bad acts and to suppress evidence \r\n  found in connection with an allegedly invalid search warrant.Â  The motions were \r\n  denied.\r\nJaquan suffered injuries to his internal organs, which caused an infection \r\n  that led to his death.Â  The testimony of two witnesses who observed Jaquan indicated \r\n  that Jaquanâ€™s eyes were half-closed and he was pale and non-responsive on the \r\n  morning of September 21.Â  One of the witnesses, Kimberly Hampton, related that \r\n  Jaquan was making a strange breathing sound, one she characterized as â€œa death \r\n  gurgle.â€Â  By noon, when Perry brought Jaquan with her and her other child to \r\n  the dentistâ€™s office, a witness noticed that Jaquan looked sick and pale but \r\n  the witness did not hear unusual breathing sounds.\r\nThe State and Fletcher disagreed as to which injuries should have been included \r\n  in the testimony.Â  The State introduced evidence of two instances of abuse, \r\n  which Fletcher describes as occurring â€œprior to that which caused Jaquanâ€™s death \r\n  on September 21st.â€Â  About three or four weeks prior to September 21, Carlos \r\n  Jenkins visited Fletcherâ€™s home and found Jaquan handcuffed to a bed.Â  Approximately \r\n  two weeks before September 21, Jenkins returned to Fletcherâ€™s house and discovered \r\n  Jaquan alone in the attic, crying and sweating profusely.Â  Jaquanâ€™s ribs had \r\n  been injured and were healing suggesting the injuries had been sustained about \r\n  two weeks before Jaquan died.Â  However, Jaquanâ€™s being handcuffed and left in \r\n  a hot attic did not cause his death.\r\nThe medical evidence provided more details about Jaquanâ€™s \r\n  injuries and offered information regarding the cause of his death.Â  Dr. Timothy \r\n  P. Close, a radiologist, testified the injuries revealed by the scans and x-rays \r\n  were inflicted at different times and Jaquanâ€™s rib fractures were â€œ[p]robably \r\n  notâ€ caused by Fletcherâ€™s alleged resuscitation attempts.Â  Dr. Close estimated \r\n  some of the rib fractures were as recent as a few hours to a few days old and \r\n  other, older fractures were ten days to more than two weeks old (with some of \r\n  the ribs having been broken twice).Â  He declared the liver injuries were likely \r\n  caused within forty-eight hours of Jaquanâ€™s death and the bowel injuries occurred \r\n  at least twelve hours or more before Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  He stated the injuries \r\n  were inconsistent with either a fall from a bed or with a single blow (â€œmost \r\n  likelyâ€ multiple blows to the front of Jaquan).Â  Rather, his injuries were caused \r\n  by a force equivalent to ejection from a car involved in an accident when the \r\n  car had been traveling sixty to seventy miles per hour or a fall from a three \r\n  or four story building.\r\nDr. Robert D. Hubbird noted when Jaquan arrived at the hospital his abdomen \r\n  was â€œvery, very distended and protuberant,â€ he had multiple rib fractures, a \r\n  ruptured bowel which caused an infection or sepsis, and such significant damage \r\n  to his liver that it â€œwas dying.â€Â  Dr. Hubbird explained the internal bleeding \r\n  had been going on for days; the injuries had been caused over a period of days; \r\n  and the ribs had been injured at different times.Â  He testified the abdominal \r\n  and back bruises occurred at different times, with some green bruises, which \r\n  indicated they were â€œfive to seven, [even] ten days old.â€Â  Dr. Hubbird expounded \r\n  that some of the bruises could have been caused by resuscitation attempts but \r\n  others were not.Â  He declared that the cause of the injury must have been â€œincredibly \r\n  concentrated striking, a very powerful blowâ€ to have caused the damageâ€”destroyed \r\n  bowel wall, ruptured bowel, disrupted liverâ€”and must have been more than one \r\n  blow.Â  He articulated blunt force might not leave a bruise each time because \r\n  the body sometimes absorbs the force.Â  Dr. Hubbird opined Jaquan died from â€œchild \r\n  abuse from massive intra-abdominal injuries; massive injuries to kill the bowel, \r\n  caused widespread infection, killed the liver.â€\r\nThe autopsy yielded additional information.Â  Dr. Jeffrey Allen Welsh performed \r\n  the autopsy.Â  The autopsy demonstrated several bruises on Jaquanâ€™s back and \r\n  a distended abdomen.Â  A â€œtenseâ€ abdomen is abnormal in a child.Â  Dr. Welsh confirmed \r\n  resuscitation attempts may have caused some of the chest bruises.Â  After reviewing \r\n  x-rays and CT scans and performing an external and internal examination, Dr. \r\n  Welsh determined the cause of death was from blunt abdominal trauma, which caused \r\n  infection that ultimately led to Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  He found, based on the scar \r\n  formation on the internal organs, the injuries occurred at least forty-eight \r\n  hours before death and likely earlier than that, with the injuries occurring \r\n  at different times.Â  Dr. Welsh opined the type of force necessary to inflict \r\n  the trauma evidenced on Jaquanâ€™s body â€œwould have been significant because the \r\n  injuries to the liver, for example, are those described mainly with motor vehicle \r\n  type accidents.â€Â  Dr. Welsh concluded the injuries Jaquan sustained were consistent \r\n  with battered child syndrome.Â  Dr. Welsh enunciated that Jaquanâ€™s injuries would \r\n  have caused great pain and lethargy, making it obvious Jaquan needed medical \r\n  attention.\r\nFletcher presented evidence that: (1) he was not aware Jaquan had been handcuffed \r\n  to the bed; (2) Perry sometimes left Jaquan in the attic while she dried her \r\n  laundry up there; and (3) the attic had an air conditioning vent near the door.Â  \r\n  Fletcher professed he had never â€œbeatâ€ Jaquan.Â  Perry introduced evidence that \r\n  Jaquan was not injured before early September; rib fractures in children are \r\n  not uncommon; and Perryâ€™s mother saw Jaquan the day before he died and did not \r\n  notice anything wrong.\r\nThe jury found both Fletcher and Perry guilty of homicide \r\n  by child abuse.Â  Fletcher was sentenced to life in prison.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law \r\n  only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. \r\n  Wood, Op. No. 3900 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 47 at 74).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, \r\n  527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, Op. No. 3904 (S.C. Ct. App. filed \r\n  December 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 48 at 73).Â  This same standard of \r\n  review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility \r\n  of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  at 829.Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused \r\n  his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State \r\n  v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 391 S.E.2d 244 (1990); see also State \r\n  v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000) (an abuse of discretion \r\n  is a conclusion with no reasonable factual support).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate \r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply \r\n  determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, \r\n  345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 \r\n  S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  PRIOR BAD ACTS\r\nOver Fletcherâ€™s objection, the trial court allowed \r\n  the State to introduce evidence indicating Jaquan had been abused.Â  Carlos Jenkins, \r\n  who worked with Fletcher and had known him for four or five years, testified \r\n  about two incidents that occurred before Jaquanâ€™s death.\r\nThe first incident Jenkins recalled happened at Fletcherâ€™s \r\n  residence approximately two weeks before Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  When Jenkins walked \r\n  in the house, he heard Jaquan crying.Â  Jenkins found Jaquan in a walker in the \r\n  attic, which was â€œreal hot.â€Â  Jenkins took Jaquan outside to cool him off.Â  \r\n  According to Jenkins, Jaquan was â€œpouring down sweat like he had just dipped \r\n  him in a bathtub.â€Â  He testified that, although the house was air-conditioned, \r\n  a person in the attic could not feel the air-conditioning in the house because \r\n  the door to the attic was closed.Â  Jenkins said Fletcher and Perry showed no \r\n  concern about Jaquan.Â  In fact, Fletcher told Jenkins the house was his and \r\n  that Jenkins should â€œmind [his own] business.â€Â  Jenkins did not see who put \r\n  Jaquan in the attic (which Fletcher describes as a laundry room) but Jenkins \r\n  stated that both Fletcher and Perry were home.\r\nThe second incident took place at Fletcherâ€™s home when \r\n  Jenkins went to visit Fletcher about three to four weeks prior to Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  \r\n  When Jenkins followed Fletcher to the bedroom, he observed Jaquan lying on his \r\n  back, crying and screaming, handcuffed by his feet to the foot of the bed.Â  \r\n  Jenkins unlocked the handcuffs and asked Fletcher and Perry if they were crazy.Â  \r\n  They â€œjust giggledâ€ at him.\r\nJenkins did not see who handcuffed Jaquan to the bed.Â  \r\n  He did not testify he noticed any injuries to Jaquan.\r\nA.Â  Issue \r\n  Preservation\r\nFletcher did not object to the sufficiency of the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of Jenkinsâ€™ testimony.Â  A trial courtâ€™s \r\n  general ruling that evidence was admissible does not constitute reversible error.Â  \r\n  State v. McLaughlin, 307 S.C. 19, 413 S.E.2d 819 (1992) (holding the \r\n  failure to request a more explicit ruling constitutes a waiver to any objection \r\n  to the trial courtâ€™s general ruling).Â  Although Fletcher cannot object to the \r\n  sufficiency of the trial courtâ€™s ruling for the first time on appeal, he contends \r\n  the trial court ruled on the issue during the trial and that erecting a procedural \r\n  barrier is unnecessary.\r\nFletcher did not independently object to the evidence \r\n  on the ground it was less than clear and convincing.Â  However, Perryâ€™s counsel \r\n  objected: â€œthe rib injuries should not come in because there was no clear and \r\n  convincing evidence as to who inflicted these rib injuries.â€Â  Fletcherâ€™s attorney \r\n  then joined Perryâ€™s objection: â€œFor the record, your Honor[,] . . . I would \r\n  join in his objection.â€\r\nB.Â  The Continued Juridical Journey of Rule 404(b) and State v. Lyle\r\nFletcher argues the trial court erred in allowing evidence of the prior bad \r\n  acts pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE, and State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, \r\n  118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  Fletcher contends the two incidents were unrelated to \r\n  the rib injuries and Jaquanâ€™s death and claims the incidents were not causally \r\n  or temporally related.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior crimes \r\n  or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime charged.Â  State \r\n  v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Weaverling, \r\n  337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  It is well established that evidence \r\n  of other crimes or prior bad acts is inadmissible to show criminal propensity \r\n  or to demonstrate the accused is a bad individual. State v. Johnson, \r\n  293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987); see also State v. Beck, 342 \r\n  S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000) (finding that evidence of prior crimes or bad \r\n  acts is inadmissible to prove bad character of defendant or that he acted in \r\n  conformity therewith).\r\nHowever, evidence of other crimes is generally admissible when it is necessary \r\n  to establish a material fact or element of the crime charged. See Johnson, \r\n  293 S.C. at 324, 360 S.E.2d at 319; State v. Byers, 277 S.C. 176, 284 \r\n  S.E.2d 360 (1981); State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 561 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002). Thus, such evidence is admissible when it tends to establish (1) \r\n  motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme \r\n  or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other \r\n  that proof of one tends to establish the proof of the other; or (5) the identity \r\n  of the person charged with the present crime.Â  See Rule 404(b), SCRE; \r\n  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923); see also Anderson \r\n  v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 581 S.E.2d 834 (2003) (explaining that Rule 404, \r\n  the modern expression of the Lyle rule, excludes evidence of other crimes, \r\n  wrongs, or acts offered to prove character of person in order to show action \r\n  in conformity therewith; the rule creates an exception when testimony is offered \r\n  to show motive, identity, existence of common scheme or plan, absence of mistake \r\n  or accident, or intent).\r\nIf not the subject of a conviction, a prior bad act must first be established \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Beck, 342 S.C. at 135, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 683; State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004); \r\n  see also State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (noting when the appellate court determines whether clear and convincing \r\n  evidence exists of the prior bad acts, it is bound by the trial courtâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact unless they are clearly erroneous).Â  The bad act must logically relate \r\n  to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.Â  Beck, 342 S.C. \r\n  at 135, 536 S.E.2d at 682-83; see also State v. King, 334 S.C. \r\n  504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999) (declaring that record must support logical relevance \r\n  between prior bad act and crime for which defendant is accused).Â  In making \r\n  the determination of whether evidence of prior bad acts is admissible, the trial \r\n  court must gauge its logical relevancy to the particular purpose for which it \r\n  is sought to be introduced. See State v. Nix, 288 S.C. 492, 343 \r\n  S.E.2d 627 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  If the prior bad act evidence is â€œlogically pertinent \r\n  in that it reasonably tends to prove a material fact in issue, it is not to \r\n  be rejected merely because it incidentally proves the defendant guilty of another \r\n  crime.â€Â  Id. at 497, 343 S.E.2d at 630-31 (internal quotations omitted).Â  \r\n  If there is any evidence to support the admission of prior bad act evidence, \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Pagan, 357 \r\n  S.C. at 143, 591 S.E.2d at 652.\r\nEven if evidence of other crimes is admissible under Rule 404(b), the trial \r\n  judge must exclude the evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed \r\n  by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Braxton, \r\n  343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); Beck, 342 S.C. at 135-36, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 683; see also Rule 403, SCRE (â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be \r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of \r\n  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations \r\n  of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€).Â  \r\n  Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper \r\n  basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.Â  State v. Sweat, \r\n  Op. No. 3898 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. \r\n  47 at 49).Â  The determination of prejudice must be based on the entire record \r\n  and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  Id.Â  A \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial \r\n  effect of relevant evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\n 1.Â  Common Scheme or Plan Exception\r\nIn the present case, the trial judge admitted the evidence of prior abuse under \r\n  the common scheme or plan exception to Rule 404(b), SCRE, and State v. Lyle.\r\nâ€œA close degree of similarity or connection between the prior bad act and the \r\n  crime for which the defendant is on trial is required to support admissibility \r\n  under the common scheme or plan exception.â€Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 \r\n  S.C. 526, 546, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001).Â  The connection between the prior \r\n  bad act and the crime must be more than just a general similarity.Â  State \r\n  v. Timmons, 327 S.C. 48, 488 S.E.2d 323 (1997); State v. Mathis, \r\n  359 S.C. 450, 597 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œA common scheme or plan concerns \r\n  more than the commission of two similar crimes; some connection between the \r\n  crimes is necessary.â€Â  Timmons, 327 S.C. at 52, 488 S.E.2d at 325; see \r\n  also State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 444, 513 S.E.2d 385 (Ct. App. 1999) \r\n  (stating that the common scheme or plan exception requires not just similarity \r\n  of the other acts to the crime charged, but also a close relationship between \r\n  the crimes); State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 554, 451 S.E.2d 34, 39 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œClear and convincing evidence of prior crimes or bad acts \r\n  that is logically relevant is . . . admissible to prove . . . a common scheme \r\n  or plan that embraces several previous crimes so closely related to each other \r\n  that proof of one tends to establish the other.â€).Â  The degree of similarity \r\n  or remoteness between the prior bad acts and the crime charged should be considered \r\n  in determining the connection between them.Â  See, e.g., State \r\n  v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995).\r\nIn deciding whether to admit evidence of prior bad acts, courts must weigh \r\n  the probative value of evidence of prior bad acts against its prejudicial effect.Â  \r\n  State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 323 S.E.2d 772 (1984).Â  Where the evidence \r\n  of the bad acts is so similar to the charged offense that the previous act enhances \r\n  the probative value of the evidence so as to outweigh its prejudicial effect, \r\n  it is admissible.Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, even if the evidence is clear and convincing and \r\n  falls within a Lyle exception, the trial judge must exclude it if its \r\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice \r\n  to the defendant.Â  Id.Â  Thus, â€œ[s]uch evidence is inadmissible â€˜unless \r\n  the close similarity of the charged offense and the previous act[s] enhances \r\n  the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule the prejudicial effect.â€™â€Â  \r\n  McClellan, 283 S.C. at 392, 323 S.E.2d at 774.\r\nIn State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 485 S.E2d 913 (1997), the supreme \r\n  court ruled testimony about the rough treatment of the child one year before \r\n  the childâ€™s death was not admissible under the common scheme or plan exception \r\n  because of the lack of a connection between the incident and the crime of homicide \r\n  by child abuse.Â  Id. at 178-79, 485 S.E.2d at 914.Â  This case is distinguishable \r\n  from Pierce.Â  Here, one of the alleged prior incidents of abuse occurred \r\n  only three to four weeks before Jaquanâ€™s death and the other incident of abuse \r\n  took place merely two weeks prior to his death.\r\nOur supreme court has held that evidence of a prior conviction for assault \r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature of a boy was not admissible in a \r\n  later prosecution for homicide by child abuse of the boyâ€™s sister because the \r\n  type of injury was dissimilar.Â  State v. Smith, 322 S.C. 107, 470 S.E.2d \r\n  364 (1996).Â  In the present case, although the type of abuse is dissimilar, \r\n  the victim of the prior incidents and the victim of the alleged homicide by \r\n  child abuse are the same.\r\nThis court, in State v. Henry, 313 S.C. 106, 432 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. \r\n  1993), determined evidence of abuse against one of the stepdaughters was admissible \r\n  because both she and the victim experienced similar acts of abuse by the defendant \r\n  which occurred in the same places and during the same time frame.Â  Id. \r\n  at 108, 432 S.E.2d at 491.Â  Evidence of abuse against another stepdaughter was \r\n  not admissible because she was not subjected to the alleged abusive conduct \r\n  to the extent of her sisters.Â  Id.\r\nIn the case sub judice, the prior bad acts evidence was relevant \r\n  to the existence of a common scheme or plan of child abuse and neglect.Â  The \r\n  evidence demonstrates by clear and convincing proof the occurrence of the prior \r\n  bad acts.Â  Additionally, the probative value of the evidence regarding the prior \r\n  abuse outweighs the prejudicial effect of admitting the evidence.Â  See \r\n  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 136, 536 S.E.2d 679, 683 (2000) (â€œAfter \r\n  conducting a Lyle analysis and finding evidence both relevant and admissible \r\n  as a prior bad act, the trial court must conduct a Rule 403, SCRE analysis to \r\n  determine whether or not the evidence is unduly prejudicial.â€).Â  Thus, the trial \r\n  judge did not err in admitting Jenkinsâ€™ testimony under the common scheme or \r\n  plan exception to Rule 404(b), SCRE and State v. Lyle.\r\n 2.Â  Intent/Absence of Mistake or Accident/Identity\r\nEvidence of prior bad acts may be admissible to prove intent or absence of \r\n  mistake or accident.Â  See, e.g., State v. Key, 277 S.C. \r\n  214, 284 S.E.2d 781 (1981); State v. Turbeville, 275 S.C. 534, 273 S.E.2d \r\n  764 (1981).Â  Further, prior bad acts evidence is admissible if necessary to \r\n  establish a material fact or element of the crime charged.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990); State v. Johnson, \r\n  293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987); State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, \r\n  602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nA person who causes the death of a child under the age of eleven while committing \r\n  child abuse or neglect, when the death occurs under circumstances manifesting \r\n  an extreme indifference to human life, is guilty of homicide by child abuse.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2003).Â  â€œExtreme indifference is in the nature \r\n  of a culpable mental state . . . and therefore is akin to intent.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 98, 564 S.E.2d 362, 367 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal \r\n  quotations omitted).\r\nIn addition, evidence identifying the perpetrator may be admissible.Â  State \r\n  v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996) (finding court properly admitted \r\n  evidence the defendant acted as gunman in stealing a car two hours before allegedly \r\n  committing murder); State v. Good, 315 S.C. 135, 432 S.E.2d 463 (1993) \r\n  (noting that evidence of prior conviction for burglary of similar items from \r\n  the same residence against the same victim as the robbery and murder for which \r\n  defendant was charged was admissible).Â  Fletcher asserts the present case is \r\n  distinguishable from Forney and Good because of the temporal closeness \r\n  of events in Forney and the unique similarities in the crimes and bad \r\n  acts in Good.Â  Given the nature of the crime in the present case, the \r\n  prior incidents are sufficiently related in time and in similarity.Â  Fletcher \r\n  claimed he was not at home when the fatal injuries were inflicted.Â  Perryâ€™s \r\n  witnesses testified they saw no injuries before Jaquanâ€™s death and described \r\n  Perry as a loving mother.Â  In support of identifying the perpetrator, the evidence \r\n  of prior bad acts was used to demonstrate that Fletcher was at home.Â  The evidence \r\n  was probative as to the fundamental element of identity pursuant to Rule 404(b) \r\n  and Lyle.\r\nThe prior bad acts evidence, the alleged incidents of abuse, was admissible \r\n  under the intent, absence of mistake or accident, and identity exceptions to \r\n  Rule 404(b) and Lyle.Â  The evidence was necessary to establish a material \r\n  fact or element of the crime charged.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in allowing Jenkinsâ€™ testimony.\r\nC.Â  Res Gestae\r\nFletcher contends the trial court erred in allowing evidence of the prior bad \r\n  acts under the res gestae doctrine.Â  We disagree.\r\nEvidence of bad acts or other crimes may be admitted under the res \r\n  gestae theory:\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes \r\n  arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ or is \r\n  necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately connected \r\n  with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and is so much \r\n  a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its proof is appropriate \r\n  in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate \r\n  context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense is â€˜so linked together \r\n  in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged that one cannot be \r\n  fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] part of the res gestae \r\n  of the crime charged.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (1996) (quoting \r\n  United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980)).Â  When evidence \r\n  is admissible to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, there is â€œno \r\n  reason to fragmentize the event under inquiry by suppressing parts of the res \r\n  gestae.â€Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 371 (internal quotations \r\n  omitted).Â  The res gestae theory recognizes that evidence of other bad \r\n  acts may be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged \r\n  or may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which \r\n  the crime occurred.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001); \r\n  State v. Wood, Op. No. 3900 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 6, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 47 at 74).Â  Under this theory, it is important that the temporal \r\n  proximity of the prior bad act be closely related to the charged crime.Â  Owens, \r\n  346 S.C. at 652, 552 S.E.2d at 753.Â  Even if the evidence is relevant under \r\n  this theory, prior to admission the trial judge should determine whether its \r\n  probative value clearly outweighs any unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State \r\n  v. Bolden, 303 S.C. 41, 398 S.E.2d 494 (1990).\r\nFletcher alleges the prior incidents of abuse were neither factually nor temporally \r\n  related to the charged crime.Â  In this case, the time period and similarity \r\n  of the incidents involved must be examined overall because of the nature of \r\n  the crime charged.Â  The overall view of the facts provides the context in which \r\n  the crime occurred and demonstrates the culminating impact on Jaquan.Â  The medical \r\n  testimony indicated the injuries occurred over a period of time.Â  The prior \r\n  incidents were temporally related, occurring close in time to Jaquanâ€™s death.Â  \r\n  The incidents were relevant to establishing Fletcherâ€™s state of mind and whether \r\n  he manifested an extreme indifference to human life.\r\nThe alleged child abuse occurred in the two weeks during which Jaquanâ€™s \r\n  ribs were fractured and within days of when the abdominal trauma was inflicted.Â  \r\n  Extreme indifference to a human life was an element of the crime charged.Â  The \r\n  evidence of incidents occurring during the same time period as the injuries \r\n  leading to Jaquanâ€™s death established Perry and Fletcherâ€™s extreme indifference \r\n  to Jaquanâ€™s life.\r\nThe evidence was necessary to establish the crime charged.Â  Admission of the \r\n  testimony was essential and relevant to a full presentation of the evidence \r\n  in this case.Â  The testimony regarding the prior bad acts was relevant to show \r\n  the complete, whole, unfragmented story relating to the charge of homicide by \r\n  child abuse.Â  Moreover, the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial \r\n  effect.Â  See Owens, 346 S.C. at 653, 552 S.E.2d at 753.Â  The trial \r\n  court did not err in admitting the evidence of alleged prior abuse under the \r\n  res gestae doctrine.\r\nD.Â  Harmless Error\r\nAssuming arguendo the trial judge erred in admitting Jenkinsâ€™ testimony, \r\n  we find such error was harmless.\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular \r\n  case.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. \r\n  Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998); State v. Thompson, 352 \r\n  S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  No definite rule of law governs this \r\n  finding.Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  Rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined \r\n  from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. \r\n  572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985).\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of \r\n  the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897; Mitchell, \r\n  286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Where a review of the entire record establishes \r\n  the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be \r\n  reversed.Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996); Thompson, \r\n  352 S.C. at 562, 575 S.E.2d at 83; State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d \r\n  640 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did \r\n  not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, \r\n  420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).\r\nGenerally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial \r\n  errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 \r\n  S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial \r\n  is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such \r\n  that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 \r\n  S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at \r\n  795; see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) \r\n  (noting that when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that \r\n  no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside \r\n  conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result).Â  The admission of \r\n  improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other \r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003); State \r\n  v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); State v. Blackburn, \r\n  271 S.C. 324, 247 S.E.2d 334 (1978); State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, \r\n  523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Williams, 321 \r\n  S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996) (instructing that error in admission of evidence \r\n  is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence which was properly admitted); \r\n  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (explicating \r\n  that any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence \r\n  is harmless).\r\nAny error in the admission of the prior bad acts \r\n  testimony is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the overwhelming evidence \r\n  of guilt in this case.Â  Extensive medical testimony was admitted describing \r\n  Jaquanâ€™s rib fractures (injuries which did not lead directly to Jaquanâ€™s death \r\n  but demonstrated a pattern of child abuse in the weeks before it).Â  Fletcher \r\n  does not argue this evidence was prejudicial.Â  Thus, Jenkinsâ€™ testimony, irrespective \r\n  of its detail, was merely cumulative to other evidence of child abuse and, therefore, \r\n  harmless.\r\nII.Â  SEARCH WARRANT\r\nDuring the investigation, the police obtained a warrant \r\n  to search the home of Perry and Fletcher, seeking â€œ[p]hotographs of the residence \r\n  . . .[and] any evidence of abusive behavior towards the children of the residence.â€Â  \r\n  The affidavit did not specify police suspected child abuse, but it specifically \r\n  described the situation: Perry brought nine-month-old Jaquan to the hospital; \r\n  the child arrived in respiratory arrest; the child died; Perry told investigators \r\n  Jaquan fell from a bed; Perry later noticed Jaquan was not breathing; examination \r\n  of the child revealed bruises on his back and abdomen; the cause of death was \r\n  unknown; and police believed examination of the residence might lead to the \r\n  discovery of information that would assist investigators in determining the \r\n  childâ€™s cause of death.\r\nThe police officers searched the home and seized a \r\n  bed frame, a mattress, and a set of handcuffs.Â  Before trial, Fletcher moved \r\n  to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant, alleging a \r\n  lack of probable cause that particular evidence would be found at the residence \r\n  and lack of particularity as to what items were sought.Â  At the motions hearing, \r\n  the officer who obtained the warrant testified he may have told the magistrate \r\n  that police suspected child abuse, but no other evidence suggested the officer \r\n  was under oath when he gave the magistrate this information.Â  The motion to \r\n  suppress was denied and the photographs and handcuffs were entered into evidence \r\n  at trial.\r\nFletcher failed to object at trial to the admission of the photographs.Â  Making \r\n  a motion in limine to exclude evidence at the beginning of trial does not preserve \r\n  an issue for review because a ruling in limine is not a final determination.Â  \r\n  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001); State v. \r\n  King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, the moving party \r\n  must make a contemporaneous objection when the evidence is introduced.Â  Id.; \r\n  see also State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 193 n. 3, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  642, 644 n. 3 (1998) (â€œWe have consistently held a ruling in limine is not final, \r\n  and unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final \r\n  ruling procured, the issue is not preserved for review.â€) (citation omitted); \r\n  State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 521, 369 S.E.2d 842, 843 (1988) (â€œWe caution \r\n  Bench and Bar that these pre-trial motions are granted to prevent prejudicial \r\n  matter from being revealed to the jury, but do not constitute final rulings \r\n  on the admissibility of evidence.â€).Â  Unless an objection is made at the time \r\n  the evidence is offered and a final ruling procured, the issue is not preserved \r\n  for review.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001).Â  Because \r\n  Fletcher failed to renew his objection, the issue was not properly preserved.\r\nIn addition, Fletcher did not join Perryâ€™s argument for suppression of the \r\n  evidence on the ground of insufficient probable cause.Â  A defendant cannot bootstrap \r\n  an issue for appeal via his co-defendantâ€™s objection.Â  State v. Carriker, \r\n  269 S.C. 553, 238 S.E.2d 678 (1977); State v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The probable cause issue Fletcher raises may not \r\n  have been properly preserved.\r\nA.Â  Probable Cause\r\nAdverting to the merits, Fletcher asserts the search warrant affidavit \r\n  did not contain sufficient facts to constitute probable cause to believe evidence \r\n  of a crime would be found at the residence.Â  We disagree.\r\nA magistrate may issue a search warrant only upon \r\n  a finding of probable cause.Â  State v. Tench, 353 S.C. 531, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  314 (2003); State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 600 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  A probable cause determination requires the magistrate to analyze the totality \r\n  of the circumstances, meaning he should make a practical, common-sense decision \r\n  whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, \r\n  there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found \r\n  in a particular place.Â  See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983); \r\n  Bowie, 360 S.C. at 219, 600 S.E.2d at 116-17.Â  Probable cause is a flexible, \r\n  common-sense standard.Â  Bowie, 360 S.C. at 220, 600 S.E.2d at 117.Â  The \r\n  term â€œprobable causeâ€ does not import absolute certainty.Â  Id.Â  In determining \r\n  whether a search warrant should be issued, magistrates are concerned with probabilities \r\n  and not certainties.Â  Id.\r\nâ€œThe South Carolina General Assembly has enacted a \r\n  requirement that search warrants may be issued â€˜only upon affidavit sworn to \r\n  before the magistrate . . . establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€™â€Â  State \r\n  v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999) (quoting S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985)).Â  The affidavit must contain sufficient underlying \r\n  facts and information upon which the magistrate may make a determination of \r\n  probable cause.Â  State v. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 583 S.E.2d 437 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003); State v. Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 454 S.E.2d 905 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n  Affidavits are not meticulously drawn by lawyers, but are normally drafted by \r\n  non-lawyers in the haste of a criminal investigation, and should therefore be \r\n  viewed in a common sense and realistic fashion.Â  State v. Sullivan, 267 \r\n  S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976); Dupree, 354 S.C. at 683, 583 S.E.2d \r\n  at 441.Â  Affidavits must be judged on the facts presented and not on the precise \r\n  wording used.Â  Bowie, 360 S.C. at 220, 600 S.E.2d at 117.\r\nThe magistrate should determine probable cause based \r\n  on all of the information available to the magistrate at the time the warrant \r\n  is issued.Â  State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 372 S.E.2d 587 (1988); State \r\n  v. Driggers, 322 S.C. 506, 473 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In determining \r\n  the validity of the warrant, a reviewing court may consider only information \r\n  brought to the magistrateâ€™s attention.Â  Bowie, 360 S.C. at 219, 600 S.E.2d \r\n  at 116.\r\nAn appellate court reviewing the decision to issue \r\n  a search warrant must decide whether the magistrate had a substantial basis \r\n  for concluding probable cause existed.Â  Bowie, 360 S.C. at 216, 600 S.E.2d \r\n  at 115; Dupree, 354 S.C. at 683, 583 S.E.2d at 441; State v. King, \r\n  349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. 192 \r\n  Coin-Operated Video Game Machs., 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000) (finding \r\n  that as long as the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding a search \r\n  would uncover evidence of wrongdoing, the Fourth Amendment requires no more).Â  \r\n  This review, like the determination by the magistrate, is governed by the â€œtotality \r\n  of the circumstancesâ€ test.Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  675 (2000); King, 349 S.C. at 148, 561 S.E.2d at 643.Â  The appellate \r\n  court should give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable \r\n  cause.Â  State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997); Driggers, \r\n  322 S.C. at 510, 473 S.E.2d at 59; see also Sullivan, 267 S.C. \r\n  at 617, 230 S.E.2d at 624 (elucidating that magistrateâ€™s determination of probable \r\n  cause should be paid great deference by reviewing court).Â  Searches based on \r\n  warrants will be given judicial deference to the extent an otherwise marginal \r\n  search may be justified if it meets a realistic standard of probable cause.Â  \r\n  State v. Bennett, 256 S.C. 234, 182 S.E.2d 291 (1971).\r\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit \r\n  provided the magistrate with a substantial basis for finding probable cause \r\n  to search the home of Fletcher and Perry.Â  See Weston, 329 S.C. \r\n  at 291, 494 S.E.2d at 803 (finding duty of reviewing court is simply to ensure \r\n  that magistrate had substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed).Â  \r\n  The affidavit edifies: (1) that Perry claimed Jaquan fell out of bed in the \r\n  morning and was brought to the hospital because he stopped breathing; and (2) \r\n  that there were bruises on the child.Â  Concomitantly, the suspicion of child \r\n  abuse is not only implicit but is verifiable.Â  This suspicion supported the \r\n  magistrateâ€™s finding of probable cause.Â  Thus, the warrant is valid.Â  Because \r\n  investigators searched the residence pursuant to a valid warrant, the trial \r\n  court properly refused to suppress the evidence, including the handcuffs and \r\n  photographs, found in the search.\r\nB.Â  Scope of the Search Warrant\r\nFletcher claims the affidavit did not describe with sufficient particularity \r\n  the property to be seized, and the trial court erred in refusing to suppress \r\n  evidence resulting from an invalid search warrant.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo pass constitutional muster, a search warrant shall not be issued unless \r\n  it particularly describes â€œthe place to be searched, and the persons or things \r\n  to be seized.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV; see also S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ \r\n  10 (â€œThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \r\n  and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures and unreasonable invasions \r\n  of privacy shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable \r\n  cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place \r\n  to be searched, the person or thing to be seized, and the information to be \r\n  obtained.â€).Â  An objective of this â€œparticular descriptionâ€ requirement is to \r\n  prevent general warrantsâ€”those authorizing â€œa general, exploratory rummaging \r\n  in a personâ€™s belongings.â€Â  Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, \r\n  467 (1971).Â  The South Carolina Code requires a warrant â€œidentifying the propertyâ€ \r\n  to be seized.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003).Â  The statute requires no more \r\n  than the state and federal constitutions, both of which require warrants to \r\n  particularly describe the things to be seized.Â  State v. Williams, 297 \r\n  S.C. 404, 377 S.E.2d 308 (1989).Â  â€œ[T]he particularity requirement must be applied \r\n  with a practical margin of flexibility, depending on the type of property to \r\n  be seized, and . . . a description of property will be acceptable if it is as \r\n  specific as the circumstances and nature of activity under investigation permit.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Sullivan, 281 S.C. 522, 524, 316 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1984) (internal \r\n  quotations omitted); see also United States v. Osborne, 630 F.2d \r\n  374, 377 (5th Cir. 1980) (upholding a warrant authorizing the seizure of several \r\n  described items and â€œany other evidence relating to the armed robberyâ€); State \r\n  v. Malloy, 409 N.W.2d 707, 708 (Iowa Ct. App. 1987) (approving a warrant \r\n  authorizing the seizure of specified items as well as â€œevidence of instrumentalities \r\n  which would substantiate abuse or neglectâ€).\r\nThe warrant in the instant case was limited to evidence of abusive behavior \r\n  toward the children.Â  The exact characteristics of the evidence were unknown \r\n  to investigators.Â  However, requiring a more detailed description would unreasonably \r\n  thwart an investigation.Â  The warrant did not authorize a search for evidence \r\n  of other crimes and its scope was properly limited.Â  Therefore, it was not fatally \r\n  general.Â  The trial court did not err in allowing evidence found pursuant to \r\n  the valid search.\r\nEven if the evidence was erroneously admitted, the error is harmless beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt because it could not have impacted the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  See \r\n  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); see also \r\n  State v. Tench, 353 S.C. 531, 579 S.E.2d 314 (2003) (noting the erroneous \r\n  admission of evidence may be harmless if it did not affect the outcome of the \r\n  trial); Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992) (stating \r\n  error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the \r\n  verdict obtained).Â  The State established homicide by child abuse by overwhelming \r\n  evidence, including the medical testimony which proved the injuries could not \r\n  have been accidental and the childâ€™s obvious pain would have indicated he needed \r\n  medical attention long before Fletcher and Perry took him to the hospital.Â  \r\n  In addition, Fletcher admitted the handcuffs belonged to him.Â  Even the erroneous \r\n  admission of the handcuffs could not have affected the juryâ€™s verdict.\r\nIII.Â  CONFRONTATION CLAUSE\r\nBoth Perry and Fletcher provided statements to investigators.Â  At \r\n  a pre-trial hearing pursuant to Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 \r\n  (1968), Fletcher requested the trial court redact the following from Perryâ€™s \r\n  September 22, 2000 statement:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       What was Jaquan handcuffed to?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n        \r\n       He was handcuffed to the bottom rail of the bed.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Which bed was Jaquan handcuffed to?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       The bed in my room, the one in there now.Â  He [sic] friend \r\n  Carlos came in the house and took the handcuffs off and \r\n  told Henry he shouldnâ€™t do that.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe trial court redacted the reference to Carlos as â€œhe friendâ€ and the reference \r\n  to Fletcher in the second answer.Â  The second response then stated: â€œThe bed \r\n  in my room, the one in there now.Â  Carlos came in the house and took the handcuffs \r\n  off.â€Â  The trial court redacted references to other handcuffing incidents and \r\n  Perryâ€™s statement that Fletcher beat Jaquan with a belt. Â The trial judge provided \r\n  the jury with a limiting instruction when the statements were introduced and \r\n  with a similar instruction when he charged the jury on the law.\r\nA.Â  Redacted Statement of Perry\r\nFletcher submits \r\n  the trial court erred by failing to adequately redact Perryâ€™s statement, which \r\n  violated the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution \r\n  and article one, section fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe constitutional right to confront and cross examine witnesses is essential \r\n  to a fair trial in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and insures \r\n  that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be \r\n  challenged at trial.â€Â  State v. Martin, 292 S.C. 437, 439, 357 S.E.2d \r\n  21, 22 (1987).Â  The introduction of a non-testifying co-defendantâ€™s statement \r\n  which implicates a defendant violates a defendantâ€™s right to confrontation because \r\n  no opportunity to cross-examine the co-defendant is presented.Â  Bruton, \r\n  391 U.S. at 137.Â  Because the right to confrontation is so fundamental, limiting \r\n  instructions are not an adequate substitute.Â  Id.; see also State \r\n  v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999) (recognizing that in Bruton, \r\n  the Supreme Court held that a defendantâ€™s rights under the Confrontation Clause \r\n  of the Sixth Amendment are violated by the admission of a non-testifying co-defendantâ€™s \r\n  confession that inculpates a defendant, even if a cautionary instruction is \r\n  given).\r\nRedaction has come into play as a tool to allow admission of a co-defendantâ€™s \r\n  confession against the confessor in a joint trial.Â  State v. Holmes, \r\n  342 S.C. 113, 536 S.E.2d 671 (2000).Â  The point of redaction is to permit the \r\n  confession to be used against the non-testifying confessor, while avoiding implicating \r\n  his co-defendant.Â  Id.Â  The Confrontation Clause is not violated when \r\n  a defendantâ€™s name is redacted but other evidence links the statementâ€™s application \r\n  to the defendant, if a proper limiting instruction is given. Richardson v. \r\n  Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987) (holding â€œthe Confrontation Clause is not \r\n  violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendantâ€™s confession with a \r\n  proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate \r\n  not only the defendantâ€™s name, but any reference to his or her existence.â€).\r\nThe redacted version of Perryâ€™s statement neither mentions nor implicates Fletcher.Â  \r\n  Unlike the defendant in Bruton, Fletcher was not named as a participant \r\n  in the crime.Â  See Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208 (distinguishing \r\n  Bruton in a case in which the confession was not incriminating on its \r\n  face).\r\nBased on Richardson, Fletcherâ€™s right to confrontation was not violated.Â  \r\n  The statement that Jaquan was handcuffed indicates someone other than Perry \r\n  may have handcuffed the child but does not necessarily implicate Fletcher.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Perry was not a witness against Fletcher and no violation of his \r\n  right to confront a witness against him occurred.Â  See State v. Evans, \r\n  316 S.C. 303, 450 S.E.2d 47 (1994) (finding a co-defendantâ€™s statement admissible \r\n  where, although the statementâ€™s incriminating import was inferable from other \r\n  evidence properly admitted against the defendant, the statement did not on its \r\n  face incriminate the defendant).Â  Because the trial court adequately redacted \r\n  Perryâ€™s statement and gave a proper limiting instruction to the jury, Fletcherâ€™s \r\n  right to confrontation was not violated.\r\nB.Â  Cross-Examination by Perry\r\nThe State introduced a statement Perry gave to police officers.Â  Perry did \r\n  not testify, but Perryâ€™s counsel used her statement in cross-examining Fletcher.Â  \r\n  After Fletcher said Perry was home during the alleged handcuffing incident and \r\n  denied Perry cussed him out or told him not to handcuff Jaquan to the bed, counsel \r\n  for Perry referred to Perryâ€™s statement.Â  Fletcherâ€™s attorney objected.Â  The \r\n  trial court overruled the objection.Â  Fletcher, as instructed by Perryâ€™s counsel, \r\n  read from Perryâ€™s statement:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n       A.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  â€œWhat was Jaquan doing that was so bad?â€\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       Q.&nbsp;\r\n      All right.Â  Here.Â  And the answer is?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       A.\r\n       \r\n  I donâ€™t know what the last word is.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       Q.\r\n       \r\n  But what does it say?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       A.\r\n       \r\n  I came home; Jaquan was in theâ€”\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       Q.\r\n       \r\n  All right.Â  And whatâ€™s the next question; the next question?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       A.\r\n       \r\n  â€œWhat was Jaquan handcuffed to?â€\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       Q.\r\n       \r\n  And what does it say here?Â  What is the answer?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       A.\r\n       \r\n  â€œHe was handcuffed to the bottom rail of the bed.â€\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       Q.\r\n       \r\n  So your story is that Ms. Perry was there?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       A.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       Q.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  And you deny that she came home and witnessed this and cussed you out about \r\n  this?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n Fletcher complains the use of Perryâ€™s statement in cross-examining \r\n  him improperly â€œpitted him against [Perryâ€™s] previous statementâ€ and the trial \r\n  court erred in overruling his objection.\r\nThe record shows Fletcher raised a general objection to the publication of \r\n  Perryâ€™s statement by Fletcher.Â  When Perryâ€™s counsel asked Fletcher to read \r\n  from Perryâ€™s statement, Fletcherâ€™s attorney declared: â€œIâ€™ll object to having \r\n  [Fletcher] publish another personâ€™s statement.â€Â  The judge overruled the objection.Â  \r\n  It is well settled that an objection must be on a specific ground.Â  State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  To be preserved \r\n  for appellate review, an objection should be sufficiently specific to bring \r\n  into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.Â  Id.Â  The objection \r\n  here lacks specificity.Â  Fletcher did not present the trial judge with the issue \r\n  of â€œpittingâ€ witnesses based on this colloquy.Â  This issue is not preserved \r\n  for our review.\r\nIV.Â  PHOTOGRAPHS\r\nDuring the trial, the State, over Fletcherâ€™s objection, was allowed to introduce \r\n  post-mortem photographs of Jaquan when the trial court found them â€œadmissible \r\n  under 403.â€Â  The photographs depicted Jaquanâ€™s external injuries.Â  The photograph \r\n  labeled Stateâ€™s Exhibit 1 shows Jaquan on a hospital gurney, unclothed, with \r\n  a tube in his mouth, as well as gauze and an unidentified incision near the \r\n  genital area (related to medical intervention).Â  The other photographs depict \r\n  bruises on Jaquanâ€™s body.\r\nFletcher asseverates the photographs were calculated to arouse the sympathy \r\n  or prejudice of the jury and were irrelevant.Â  He argues there was little probative \r\n  value to Stateâ€™s Exhibit 1 and several of the photographs showing bruises were \r\n  irrelevant, unnecessary to substantiate material facts, and inflammatory in \r\n  nature.\r\nPerryâ€™s attorney noted his objection but did not state a ground.Â  He declared: \r\n  â€œWe would object to those.â€Â  A general objection which does not specify the \r\n  particular ground on which the objection is based is insufficient to preserve \r\n  the issue for review.Â  State v. New, 338 S.C. 313, 526 S.E.2d 237 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  During the bench conference, neither Perry nor Fletcher asked to \r\n  place a ground for the objection on the record.Â  An objection made during an \r\n  off-the-record conference which is not made part of the record does not preserve \r\n  the question for review.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  586 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In addition, an issue is not preserved for appeal merely \r\n  because the trial judge mentions it.Â  See, e.g., Mize v. Blue \r\n  Ridge Ry. Co., 219 S.C. 119, 64 S.E.2d 253 (1951).Â  Fletcher contends the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling on the matter indicates a specific objection was made off \r\n  the record, and because the trial court ruled on the record, the error was preserved.Â  \r\n  Fletcher made no independent objection on the record.Â  He concurred in the objection \r\n  of Perryâ€™s counsel.Â  Furthermore, the trial courtâ€™s mentioning the issue does \r\n  not preserve it for appeal.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  In addition, we disagree with Fletcherâ€™s substantive argument.\r\nThe relevance, materiality, and admissibility of photographic evidence are \r\n  matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be \r\n  disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Haselden, \r\n  353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003); State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, \r\n  518 S.E.2d 588 (1999); see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, \r\n  460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (stating that trial judge has considerable latitude in \r\n  ruling on admissibility of evidence and his rulings will not be disturbed absent \r\n  showing of probable prejudice).Â  The trial judge must balance the prejudicial \r\n  effect of graphic photographs against their probative value.Â  State v. Vang, \r\n  353 S.C. 78, 577 S.E.2d 225 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding \r\n  the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of relevant evidence \r\n  should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.Â  State v. Hamilton, \r\n  344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Admitting photographs which serve \r\n  to corroborate testimony is not an abuse of discretion.Â  See State \r\n  v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); State v. Jarrell, \r\n  350 S.C. 90, 564 S.E.2d 362 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, photographs calculated \r\n  to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are \r\n  irrelevant or not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.Â  State \r\n  v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 480 S.E.2d 64 (1997).Â  â€œTo constitute unfair prejudice, \r\n  the photographs must create a â€˜tendency to suggest a decision on an improper \r\n  basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.â€™â€Â  Kelley, \r\n  319 S.C. at 178, 460 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting State v. Alexander, 303 \r\n  S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991)).\r\nThe photographs were introduced to corroborate the \r\n  testimony of witnesses who saw Jaquanâ€™s injuries at or near the time of his \r\n  death.Â  The pictures demonstrated the trauma occurred over a period of time \r\n  because they showed the discoloration of the bruises.Â  The photographs were \r\n  necessary to depict the severity of the bruises and the resultant trauma, which \r\n  were inconsistent with those resulting from an accident or play. Â They indicated \r\n  the presence of internal injuries (e.g., the distended abdomen indicated rib \r\n  fractures).Â  The photographs corroborated testimony that the cause of death \r\n  was child abuse and the abuse manifested an extreme indifference to human life.Â  \r\n  The photographs were relevant and necessary and were not inflammatory or calculated \r\n  to illicit sympathy or prejudice of the jury.Â  Therefore, the trial court did \r\n  not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the conviction of Fletcher is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n [2]  Over defense counselâ€™s objection, the trials of Fletcher and Perry were not severed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3941","title":"State v.

Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Alvin J. Green was convicted of criminal sexual conduct \r\n  (CSC) with a minor in the first degree and CSC with a minor in the second degree.Â  \r\n  He contends the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over both offenses.Â  \r\n  We vacate the convictions and sentences of Green.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGreen was charged with two counts of CSC with \r\n  a minor, both stemming from alleged sexual assaults on the same victim.Â  The \r\n  allegation of CSC with a minor in the first degree concerned events before the \r\n  victimâ€™s eleventh birthday and the second-degree allegation related to a period \r\n  of time after the victimâ€™s eleventh birthday.Â  However, three of the four dates \r\n  listed in the two-count indictment were off by ten years.Â  At trial, the State \r\n  moved to amend the indictment to correct the three dates that were ten years \r\n  earlier than the offenses allegedly occurred.Â  Defense counsel objected to the \r\n  amendment, but conceded the language in the indictments followed the statute \r\n  creating the offenses.Â  After a discussion, the trial court allowed the amendment, \r\n  concluding the dates originally included were scrivenerâ€™s errors.Â  Green then \r\n  waived presentment to the amended indictment while purporting to preserve his \r\n  objection to the amendment itself.Â  After the State rested, the defense noted \r\n  the first count of the amended indictment (for CSC with a minor in the first \r\n  degree) contained a time span for the alleged offenses which included dates \r\n  in which Green was too young to be prosecuted in circuit court as well as dates \r\n  in which such prosecution was proper.Â  In response, the trial court again amended \r\n  the first count of the indictment to include only dates in which Green was old \r\n  enough to be tried as an adult.Â  The jury found Green guilty as charged and \r\n  the trial court sentenced him to concurrent fifteen-year prison terms.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Circuit Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict a defendant of an offense unless: (1) there has been an indictment \r\n  which sufficiently states the offense; (2) the defendant has waived presentment \r\n  of the indictment; or (3) the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime \r\n  charged in the indictment.Â  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d \r\n  103 (2002); State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 572 S.E.2d 309 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  An indictment is sufficient to convey jurisdiction if it apprises the \r\n  defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and informs \r\n  the defendant of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend.Â  Koon v. \r\n  State, 358 S.C. 359, 595 S.E.2d 456 (2004).Â  The acts of a court with respect \r\n  to a matter as to which it has no jurisdiction are void.Â  Guthrie, 352 \r\n  S.C. at 107, 572 S.E.2d at 312.\r\nUnder section 17-19-100 of the South Carolina Code, if an indictment contains \r\n  any defect or, â€œon the trial of any case there shall appear to be any variance \r\n  between the allegations of the indictment and the evidence offered in proof \r\n  thereof,â€ the trial court â€œmay amend the indictment . . . if such amendment \r\n  does not change the nature of the offense charged.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 \r\n  (2003).Â  â€œAfter such amendment the trial shall proceed in all respects and with \r\n  the same consequences as if the indictment had originally been returned as so \r\n  amended, unless such amendment shall operate as a surprise to the defendant, \r\n  in which case the defendant shall be entitled, upon demand, to a continuance \r\n  of the cause.â€Â  Id.Â  The appropriate analysis for determining whether \r\n  an amendment to an indictment deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  is whether the amendment changed the nature of the offense charged, not whether \r\n  the amendment in any way surprised or prejudiced the defendant.Â  State v. \r\n  Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001).\r\nGenerally, amendments are permitted for the purpose of correcting an error \r\n  of form, such as a scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  Cutner v. State, 354 S.C. 151, \r\n  580 S.E.2d 120 (2003). Otherwise, if the defendant objects to an amendment on \r\n  grounds that the amended indictment would change the nature of the offense, \r\n  the trial judge is obligated to inform the parties of the necessity of reindictment \r\n  or obtain a waiver of presentment from the defendant.Â  Hopkins v. State, \r\n  317 S.C. 7, 451 S.E.2d 389 (1994).\r\nâ€œCritical determinations to be made by a court when confronted with the issue \r\n  of amending the date alleged in an indictment is always whether the amendment \r\n  alters the nature of the offense charged and surprises the accused, preventing \r\n  a fair trial.â€Â  State v. Quarles, 261 S.C. 413, 417, 200 S.E.2d 384, \r\n  385 (1973).Â  â€œA motion to amend the date alleged in an indictment is addressed \r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the burden of showing an abuse \r\n  of discretion and resulting prejudice is upon the party adversely affected by \r\n  his ruling thereon.â€Â  Id. at 417, 200 S.E.2d at 386.\r\nThe indictment as crafted by the drafter reveals a \r\n  date deficiency.Â  The dates contained in the indictment presented to the grand \r\n  jury apply to a two-year-old defendant and an unborn victim.Â  At a minimum, \r\n  the indictment is fatally flawed in regard to an identification and articulation \r\n  of criminal sexual conduct charges.\r\nInitially, the State moved to amend the indictment to change the dates of the \r\n  alleged offenses to a current era.Â  After granting the amendment, the court \r\n  was confronted with charges against the defendant which could not be tried in \r\n  the circuit court because of the age of the defendant, i.e., under the age of \r\n  sixteen.Â  The court redacted the indictment by extirpating certain dates contained \r\n  in the indictment relating to the defendantâ€™s being under the age of sixteen.\r\nWe decline to place our approbation and imprimatur upon the subject matter \r\n  juxtaposition between the family court and the circuit court.Â  The prosecutorial \r\n  endeavors are not efficacious.Â  Approval of the amendment activities and rulings \r\n  in the case under the rubric and guise of salutary and salubrious amendments \r\n  flies in the face of the grand jury and indictment procedure enunciated in the \r\n  South Carolina Constitution and applicable statutes.\r\nNo precedent is cited in approving the amendatory \r\n  activities involving the indictment in this case.Â  The indictment moves through \r\n  a peripatetic journey from the circuit court to the family court and back to \r\n  the circuit court as finally amended.\r\nThe gravamen of our conclusion rests upon the efficacy of sections 20-7-400 \r\n  and 20-7-7605 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Section 20-7-400, titled â€œExclusive \r\n  original jurisdiction of family court,â€ states:\r\n\r\n(A) Except as otherwise provided herein, the court shall have exclusive \r\n  original jurisdiction and shall be the sole court for initiating action:\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n(3) Concerning any child seventeen years of age or over, living or found within \r\n  the geographical limits of the courtâ€™s jurisdiction, alleged to have violated \r\n  or attempted to violate any State or local law or municipal ordinance prior \r\n  to having become seventeen years of age and such person shall be dealt \r\n  with under the provisions of this chapter relating to children.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-400 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  Under \r\n  the Childrenâ€™s Code, the general sessions court ordinarily lacks jurisdiction \r\n  over individuals under the age of seventeen, with certain exceptions.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605 (Supp. 2003).Â  Section 20-7-7605 reads in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the jurisdiction granted to the family \r\n  court pursuant to Sections 20-7-400, 20-7-410, and 20-7-420, jurisdiction over \r\n  a case involving a child must be transferred or retained as follows:\r\n  \r\n(1) If, during the pendency of a criminal or quasi-criminal charge against a \r\n  child in a circuit court of this State, it is ascertained that the child \r\n  was under the age of seventeen years at the time of committing the alleged offense, \r\n  it is the duty of the circuit court immediately to transfer the case, together \r\n  with all the papers, documents, and testimony connected with it, to the family \r\n  court of competent jurisdiction, except in those cases where the Constitution \r\n  gives to the circuit court exclusive jurisdiction or in those cases where jurisdiction \r\n  has properly been transferred to the circuit court by the family court under \r\n  the provisions of this section. The court making the transfer shall order the \r\n  child to be taken immediately to the place of detention designated by the court \r\n  or to that court itself, or shall release the child to the custody of some suitable \r\n  person to be brought before the court at a time designated.Â  The court then \r\n  shall proceed as provided in this article.Â  The provisions of this section are \r\n  applicable to all existing offenses and to offenses created in the future unless \r\n  the General Assembly specifically directs otherwise.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n(4) If a child sixteen years of age or older is charged with an offense which, \r\n  if committed by an adult, would be a misdemeanor, a Class E or F felony as defined \r\n  in Section 16-1-20, or a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment \r\n  of ten years or less, and if the court, after full investigation, considers \r\n  it contrary to the best interest of the child or of the public to retain jurisdiction, \r\n  the court, in its discretion, acting as committing magistrate, may bind over \r\n  the child for proper criminal proceedings to a court which would have trial \r\n  jurisdiction of the offense if committed by an adult.\r\n(5) If a child fourteen or fifteen years of age is charged with an offense which, \r\n  if committed by an adult, would be a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined in \r\n  Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment \r\n  of fifteen years or more, the court, after full investigation and hearing, may \r\n  determine it contrary to the best interest of the child or of the public to \r\n  retain jurisdiction. The court, acting as committing magistrate, may bind over \r\n  the child for proper criminal proceedings to a court which would have trial \r\n  jurisdiction of the offenses if committed by an adult.\r\n(6) Within thirty days after the filing of a petition in the family court alleging \r\n  the child has committed the offense of murder or criminal sexual conduct, the \r\n  person executing the petition may request in writing that the case be transferred \r\n  to the court of general sessions with a view to proceeding against the child \r\n  as a criminal rather than as a child coming within the purview of this article. \r\n  The judge of the family court is authorized to determine this request. If the \r\n  request is denied, the petitioner may appeal within five days to the circuit \r\n  court. Upon the hearing of the appeal, the judge of the circuit court is vested \r\n  with the discretion of exercising and asserting the jurisdiction of the court \r\n  of general sessions or of relinquishing jurisdiction to the family court. If \r\n  the circuit judge elects to exercise the jurisdiction of the general sessions \r\n  court for trial of the case, he shall issue an order to that effect, and then \r\n  the family court has no further jurisdiction in the matter.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605 (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  Pursuant to the \r\n  Childrenâ€™s Code, â€œ[c]hildâ€ is defined in section 20-7-6605(1):\r\n\r\nâ€œChildâ€ means a person less than seventeen years of age.Â  \r\n  â€œChildâ€ does not mean a person sixteen years of age or older who is charged \r\n  with a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a felony \r\n  which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more.Â  \r\n  However, a person sixteen years of age who is charged with a Class A, B, C, \r\n  or D felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum \r\n  term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more may be remanded to the family \r\n  court for disposition of the charge at the discretion of the solicitor.Â  An \r\n  additional or accompanying charge associated with the charges contained in this \r\n  item must be heard by the court with jurisdiction over the offenses contained \r\n  in this item.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6605(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  In Kent v. United States, \r\n  383 U.S. 541 (1966), the United States Supreme Court noted the following criteria \r\n  for determining whether jurisdiction should be waived under the District of \r\n  Columbia Juvenile Court Act:\r\n\r\n1. The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the \r\n  protection of the community requires waiver.\r\n2. Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated \r\n  or willful manner.\r\n3. Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against property, greater \r\n  weight being given to offenses against persons especially if personal injury \r\n  resulted.\r\n4. The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i.e., whether there is evidence \r\n  upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an indictment (to be determined \r\n  by consultation with the United States Attorney).\r\n5. The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one court \r\n  when the juvenileâ€™s associates in the alleged offense are adults who will be \r\n  charged with a crime in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\r\n6. The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined by consideration \r\n  of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and pattern of living.\r\n7. The record and previous history of the juvenile, including previous contacts \r\n  with the Youth Aid Division, other law enforcement agencies, juvenile courts \r\n  and other jurisdictions, prior periods of probation to this Court, or prior \r\n  commitments to juvenile institutions.\r\n8. The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of \r\n  reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found to have committed \r\n  the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services and facilities currently \r\n  available to the Juvenile Court.\r\n\r\nId. at 566-67.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court, in State v. Corey \r\n  D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000), concluded that the family court \r\n  may properly consider the Kent factors when determining whether jurisdiction \r\n  over a juvenile should be transferred.Â  Id. at 117-18, 529 S.E.2d at \r\n  25-26 (â€œMoreover, the family court specifically considered the Kent factors, \r\n  which in previous cases this Court has implicitly approved as appropriate criteria.â€).\r\nFacially and legally, jurisdiction of the offenses contained in the amended \r\n  and re-amended indictment is erroneously placed with the circuit court.Â  The \r\n  referenced statutes plainly and luculently demonstrate that the exclusive original \r\n  jurisdiction of the family court controls all charges pending \r\n  against a juvenile under the age of sixteen.Â  The amalgamation and commingling \r\n  of pending charges with exclusive original jurisdiction in the family court \r\n  and exclusive original jurisdiction in the circuit court result in an indictment \r\n  that can NOT be placed in a legally sufficient position by an \r\n  amendment procedure that simplistically eliminates original family court jurisdiction \r\n  offenses, leaving original jurisdiction circuit court offenses.Â  This procedure \r\n  violates the constitutional and statutory function of the grand jury in South \r\n  Carolina.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the convictions and sentences of Green are\r\n VACATED.\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nSTILWELL, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  The two amendments \r\n  to the indictment, in my opinion, neither changed the nature of the offense \r\n  with which Green was charged nor did they otherwise divest the circuit court \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nThe circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to convict a \r\n  criminal defendant unless the defendant is charged by an indictment sufficiently \r\n  stating the offense, the offense is a lesser-included offense of the indicted \r\n  offense, or the defendant waives presentment of his indictment to the grand \r\n  jury.Â  State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C. 462, 464-65, 578 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2003).Â  \r\n  An indictment is sufficient where it charges the elements of the offense and \r\n  sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.Â  Browning \r\n  v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).Â  \r\nIf an indictment contains any defect or there is a â€œvariance between the allegations \r\n  of the indictment and the evidence offered in proof thereof,â€ the trial court \r\n  may amend the indictment if the amendment â€œdoes not change the nature of the \r\n  offense charged.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (2003).Â  Unless the amendment \r\n  operates as a surprise entitling the defendant to a continuance on demand, the \r\n  trial shall proceed as though the indictment had originally been returned in \r\n  its amended form.Â  Id.Â  Generally, amendments are permitted to correct \r\n  an error such as a scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  Cutner v. State, 354 S.C. 151, \r\n  155, 580 S.E.2d 120, 122 (2003).Â  â€œOtherwise, if the defendant objects to an \r\n  amendment on grounds that the amended indictment would change the nature of \r\n  the offense, the trial judge is obligated to inform the parties of the necessity \r\n  of reindictment or obtain a waiver of presentment from the defendant.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 155, 580 S.E.2d at 122-23.Â  \r\nGreen contends the second count of the indictment was changed by \r\n  the amendment at the beginning of trial from an allegation of CSC with a minor \r\n  in the first degree to CSC with a minor in the second degree.Â  His argument \r\n  is based solely on the fact the victim was under the age of eleven on the dates \r\n  originally listed in the indictment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(1), \r\n  (2) (2003).Â  However, both before and after the amendment, the allegation was \r\n  that Green committed a sexual battery on the victim who was between the age \r\n  of eleven and fourteen years old.Â  The fact the victim was not yet eleven on \r\n  the dates originally included in the indictment was a mere scrivenerâ€™s error \r\n  the amendment, by design, corrected.Â  The amendment did not change the nature \r\n  of the offense.Â  See State v. McRae, 222 S.C. 194, 199, 72 S.E.2d \r\n  451, 453 (1952) (holding amendment changing the date of the alleged offense \r\n  was proper because the amendment did not change the nature of the offense); \r\n  cf. State v. Pierce, 263 S.C. 23, 27-28, 207 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1974) \r\n  (noting when the State produces evidence the crime occurred on a date different \r\n  than the one in the indictment in a case where the accused relies on an alibi \r\n  defense, it is proper for the court to amend the indictment and then declare \r\n  a mistrial to allow the defendant to establish an alibi defense for the new \r\n  date).Â  \r\nAs to the first count of the indictment, charging Green with CSC \r\n  with a minor in the first degree, Green argues the trial court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction because the indictment alleged he committed the offense \r\n  at a time he was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the family court.Â  As \r\n  drafted, this count of the indictment originally alleged the offenses occurred \r\n  beginning when Green was just two years old.Â  However, as evidence the dates \r\n  were scrivenerâ€™s errors, the State noted the victim was not even born during \r\n  part of the time originally alleged in the indictment.Â  Again, these errors \r\n  necessitated, and were corrected by, the amendment at the beginning of trial.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter the amendment, however, this count of the indictment still \r\n  alleged conduct occurring before Greenâ€™s sixteenth birthday.Â  The court of general \r\n  sessions has subject matter jurisdiction over charges alleging CSC with a minor \r\n  in the first degree.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 16-3-655(1).Â  However, under the childrenâ€™s \r\n  code it typically lacks jurisdiction over individuals under the age of seventeen, \r\n  with certain exceptions.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605 (Supp. 2003) \r\n  (requiring the circuit court, with certain exceptions, to transfer to the family \r\n  court the case of any child under the age of seventeen who is being criminally \r\n  prosecuted).Â  Notwithstanding this general rule, a person sixteen years of age \r\n  or older who is charged with a Class A, B, C, or D felony is not a child within \r\n  the meaning of the juvenile justice article of the childrenâ€™s code, which includes \r\n  section 20-7-7605.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6605(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  Criminal sexual \r\n  conduct with a minor in the first degree is a Class A felony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-1-90 (Supp. 2003).Â  In accordance with these provisions, the trial court \r\n  amended the first-degree charge after the State rested to include only those \r\n  dates in which Green was sixteen years of age or older.Â  The court also advised \r\n  it would instruct the jury to only consider allegations on or after that date \r\n  in rendering its verdict on this charge. Â This amendment, like the one \r\n  at the beginning of the trial, changed dates only, not the nature of the offense \r\n  charged.Â  Also, because of the amendment and instruction, Greenâ€™s conviction \r\n  and sentence on this charge only concerned conduct on or after his sixteenth \r\n  birthday.Â  Thus, in my opinion the trial court had both subject matter and personal \r\n  jurisdiction to try Green and I would affirm the conviction.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
