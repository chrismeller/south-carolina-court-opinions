Upon Roberts's motion, the trial court suppressed the \r\n  drugs pursuant to South Carolina Code Section 16-25-70 (Supp. 1999) and State \r\n  v. Cannon, 329 S.C. 163, 495 S.E.2d 218 (Ct. App. 1997), rev'd, \r\n  336 S.C. 335, 520 S.E.2d 317 (1999). The State appeals. We reverse and remand.(1) \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n   \r\nOfficer Andrew Faucett of the Beaufort \r\n  City Police Department responded to a reported disturbance at an apartment on \r\n  Congress Street. The officer found two people standing outside and Roberts lying \r\n  on his back two to three feet from the sidewalk. Officer Faucett noticed Roberts \r\n  was intoxicated and helped him to his feet. Meanwhile, the other people present \r\n  informed Officer Faucett that Roberts was not supposed to be there, refused \r\n  to leave, and was causing a disturbance. Officer Faucett placed Roberts in his \r\n  patrol car, intending to charge him with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. \r\n  He then began talking with the two other people, who reported they were Roberts's \r\n  relatives and that he had assaulted one of them. After arriving at the detention \r\n  center, the officer issued Roberts tickets for public drunkenness, disorderly \r\n  conduct, and criminal domestic violence (CDV). A corrections officer conducted \r\n  an inventory search of Roberts and found crack cocaine in his pocket. \r\n   \r\nRoberts pled guilty to the charges \r\n  of public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. His CDV charge was dismissed. \r\n  He was subsequently indicted on charges of distribution of crack cocaine within \r\n  the proximity of a school and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. \r\n  At a pretrial hearing on his drug charges, Roberts moved to suppress the drugs \r\n  because they were obtained during a warrantless search incident to a CDV arrest. \r\n  He argued that statutory and case law barred the admissibility of evidence of \r\n  crimes other than criminal domestic offenses where the evidence was obtained \r\n  during a CDV arrest. The trial court agreed and ordered the crack cocaine found \r\n  on Roberts suppressed. The State then filed this appeal. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA law enforcement officer may arrest \r\n  a person for CDV, violation of an order of protection, or CDV of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature without a warrant where the officer has probable cause to \r\n  believe the person is committing or has freshly committed one of these offenses. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-70(A) (Supp. 1999). Section 16-25-70 also permits an \r\n  officer to enter the suspect's residence \"in order to effect the arrest where \r\n  the officer has probable cause to believe that the action is reasonably necessary \r\n  to prevent physical harm or danger to a family or household member.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-25-70(C) (Supp. 1999). However, the statute also provides that \"[n]o \r\n  evidence other than evidence of violations of this article found as a result \r\n  of a warrantless search is admissible in a court of law.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-70(H) \r\n  (Supp. 1999). The trial court relied on subsection (H) of the statute and this \r\n  court's decision in State v. Cannon in its decision to suppress the crack \r\n  cocaine found in Roberts's pocket. \r\n   \r\nIn State v. Cannon, this court \r\n  addressed the admissibility of crack cocaine found in the pocket of a defendant \r\n  arrested without a warrant for CDV. Cannon, 329 S.C. at 164, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  at 219. The court noted that the \"basis of the warrantless search was the officer's \r\n  right to conduct a search incident to an arrest.\" Id. at 165, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  at 219. The State argued the officer entered the Cannon home at the victim's \r\n  invitation rather than pursuant to section 16-25-70(C), and thus the prohibition \r\n  of evidence of other crimes did not apply. This court disagreed, reasoning \"[t]he \r\n  focus here should be upon the appellant's arrest, not the manner in which the \r\n  arresting officer entered his home. . . . Because the officer's authority to \r\n  arrest arose out of section 16-25-70(A), subsection (G) barred introduction \r\n  of the crack cocaine found by the arresting officer when he searched the appellant.\" \r\n  Id. at 165, 495 S.E.2d at 219-20. In reversing this court's decision \r\n  in Cannon, the South Carolina Supreme Court determined the arresting \r\n  officer entered the home not \"under the authority of Â§ 16-25-70(C), but rather \r\n  upon the invitation of [the victim],\" who also lived at the home. State v. \r\n  Cannon, 336 S.C. 335, 339, 520 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1999).  \r\n   \r\nWe do not believe the suppression \r\n  of crack cocaine found in Roberts's pocket was warranted under either this court's \r\n  or the supreme court's decision in Cannon. Initially, we note that the \r\n  police officers who arrested Roberts were not responding to a report of CDV, \r\n  but to a reported \"disturbance.\" Roberts was not only arrested for CDV but was \r\n  also charged with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. The facts of this \r\n  case are thus distinct from those presented in Cannon. \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the ostensible purpose \r\n  behind section 16-25-70(H) is to promote victims' access to protection from \r\n  domestic violence unimpeded by the fear that unrelated criminal charges may \r\n  result from summoning police assistance. That goal would not be furthered by \r\n  suppression in this case where the police were not even advised a CDV had occurred \r\n  until they had already decided to charge Roberts with public drunkenness and \r\n  disorderly conduct, and where he was in fact charged with those crimes. Thus, \r\n  the police did not rely upon the authority of section 16-25-70(A) to arrest \r\n  Roberts or conduct the search. The discovery of the crack cocaine was the result \r\n  of a lawful search incident to an arrest for disorderly conduct and public drunkenness, \r\n  in addition to a charge for CDV. See Chimel v. California, 395 \r\n  U.S. 752, 762-763 (1969). Accordingly, because the officer did not rely upon \r\n  section 16-25-70(A) in making his initial arrest of Roberts, section 16-25-70(H) \r\n  does not apply. See Cannon, 336 S.C. at 339 &amp; n.4, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  at 319 &amp; n.4 (1999). In our view, suppression of the crack cocaine under \r\nthese circumstances is not warranted.    \r\nAccordingly, the order of the trial \r\n  court suppressing the crack cocaine is  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n    \r\nSTILWELL J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n1.

At issue is whether State Farm, Mayo Rudy \r\n  Calcutt's underinsurance carrier, may offset workers' compensation benefits \r\n  Calcutt may receive. The trial judge held the policy clause providing for a \r\n  setoff of workers' compensation benefits conflicted with applicable underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage statutes and violated public policy. We reverse. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n   \r\nOn March 31, 1994, Calcutt was injured \r\n  in a motor vehicle accident while operating his employer's vehicle within the \r\n  course and scope of his employment. Calcutt sued the alleged at-fault driver \r\n  and eventually settled for the policy limits of $15,000, in exchange for a covenant \r\n  not to execute.   \r\n\r\nCalcutt's employer, Dillard Paper, did \r\nnot have underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage on its vehicle. However, at the \r\ntime of the accident, Calcutt had a personal UIM policy with State Farm with limits \r\nof $25,000/$50,000 for bodily injury. The policy provided the UIM benefits would \r\nbe reduced by amounts received under workers' compensation.(1)\r\n\r\nCalcutt demanded payment of the UIM \r\n  benefits from State Farm while he had a pending claim for workers' compensation \r\n  benefits. State Farm brought this declaratory judgment action to determine whether \r\n  State Farm could apply the setoff provision. Calcutt counterclaimed seeking \r\n  a declaration that State Farm's policy provision violated public policy, conflicted \r\n  with South Carolina insurance statutes, and violated Calcutt's right to equal \r\n  protection under the United States and South Carolina Constitutions. Both parties \r\n  moved for summary judgment. \r\n   \r\nFollowing the summary judgment hearing, \r\n  the court found State Farm's setoff provision conflicted with applicable UIM \r\n  statutes and violated public policy because the employee, rather than the employer, \r\n  purchased the coverage. The court granted Calcutt's motion for summary judgment, \r\n  finding the setoff provision invalid and unenforceable. This appeal followed. \r\n   \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n   \r\nState Farm argues the trial court \r\n  erred by finding a policy clause providing for a setoff of workers' compensation \r\n  benefits conflicted with insurance statutes of this State and violated public \r\n  policy.  \r\nINSURANCE \r\n  STATUTES  \r\nThe trial court found the provision \r\n  of Calcutt's UIM policy allowing a setoff of workers' compensation benefits \r\n  violated sections 38-77-30(15)and -160 of the South Carolina Code.  \r\n   \r\n\"Insurance policies are subject to \r\n  general rules of contract construction.\" Gambrell v. Travelers Ins. Cos., \r\n  280 S.C. 69, 71 , 310 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1983). Parties to an insurance policy \r\n  have a right to make their own contract, and courts should not \"rewrite it or \r\n  torture the meaning of a policy to extend coverage never intended by the parties.\" \r\n  Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d \r\n  547, 550 (1975). Courts should \"give policy language its plain, ordinary and \r\n  popular meaning.\" Gambrell, 280 S.C. at 71, 310 S.E.2d at 816.  \r\n   \r\nStatutory provisions relating to \r\n  an insurance contract are part of the contract as a matter of law. Jordan \r\n  v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 294, 214 S.E.2d 818 (1975). To the \r\n  extent a policy provision conflicts with an applicable statutory provision, \r\n  the statute prevails. Id.  \r\n   \r\nSection 38-77-30(15)(2) \r\n  merely defines \"underinsured motor vehicle.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(15) (Supp. \r\n  1999). An at-fault motorist's vehicle is underinsured if it has at least the \r\n  minimum liability coverage required by law and the insured's damages exceed \r\n  those limits. Id.; see id. Â§ 38-77-140 (providing minimum \r\n  liability coverage requirements). Nothing in State Farm's offset provision changes \r\n  or contradicts the definition of an \"underinsured motor vehicle.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, nothing in section 38-77-160, \r\n  which provides for UIM policies, conflicts with the setoff provision in Calcutt's \r\n  policy. The South Carolina Supreme Court has addressed a similar setoff provision \r\n  in an employer's UIM policy. Williamson v. United States Fire Ins. Co., \r\n  314 S.C. 215, 442 S.E.2d 587 (1994). In Williamson, the Supreme Court \r\n  allowed UIM benefits to be offset by the workers' compensation benefits received \r\n  by the injured employee. It did so because the coverage was voluntarily provided \r\n  by the employer and \"South Carolina law provides that automobile insurance policies \r\n  need not cover liability under the workers' compensation law nor liability for \r\n  bodily injury to an insured's employee.\" Id. at 219, 442 S.E.2d at 589. \r\n  The Court reasoned that employers should not be subject to duplicative recoveries \r\n  by their employees when voluntarily providing their employees with excess coverage. \r\n  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the employee \r\n  purchased and paid the premiums on the UIM policy, not the employer. However, \r\n  section 38-77-160 does not prohibit a setoff provision, regardless of whether \r\n  the employer or the employee purchased the UIM policy. Therefore, State Farm's \r\n  setoff provision does not conflict with our insurance laws. \r\n   \r\nPUBLIC POLICY \r\n   \r\nThe trial court also found State \r\n  Farm's setoff provision violated public policy.  \r\n   \r\nAs support for its finding, the judge \r\n  cites Ferguson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 198 S.E.2d \r\n  522 (1973). Ferguson held \"any limiting language in an insurance contract \r\n  which ha[s] the effect of providing less protection than that made obligatory \r\n  by the statutes is contrary to public policy and is of no force and effect.\" \r\n  Id. at 100, 198 S.E.2d at 524 (emphasis added). Specifically, the Court \r\n  held an insurer's liability under an uninsured motorist (UM) policy is not subject \r\n  to a reduction under a setoff provision included in the UM policy. Id. \r\n  at 102-03, 198 S.E.2d at 525. The Court explained: \r\n   \r\nThe general rule supported by the \r\n  majority of the decided cases is that an uninsured motorist \r\n  endorsement provision for the reduction of payments by amounts received by the \r\n  insured under any workmen's compensation law has been held void or invalid and \r\n  unenforceable, on the ground that such a provision reduced the effective coverage \r\n  below that required by the statute and was contrary to public \r\n  policy.  \r\nId. at 101, 198 S.E.2d at \r\n  525 (emphasis added).   \r\nThe linchpin of Ferguson is \r\n  the mandatory nature of UM coverage. That case held that a setoff provision \r\n  should not reduce the minimum coverage required by law. In contrast, UIM coverage \r\n  is optional coverage, i.e., coverage not required by law. Garris \r\n  v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 311 S.E.2d 723 (1984). The public \r\n  policy in Ferguson that prohibits mandatory UM coverage from being subject \r\n  to a setoff provision does not apply to optional UIM coverage.  \r\n   \r\nAs discussed above, in Williamson, \r\n  the Supreme Court ruled an employer's UIM carrier could, based on a similar \r\n  setoff provision, offset workers' compensation benefits received by the injured \r\n  employee. The Supreme Court differentiated Williamson from Ferguson \r\n  by explaining:  \r\nFerguson is distinguishable \r\n  in that it involved a claim for uninsured benefits by an individual \r\n  who had purchased the insurance policy. In this case, however, the policy was \r\n  purchased by Williamson's employer, not by Williamson. The same statute and \r\n  public policy does not operate in cases where voluntary coverage \r\n  has been provided by an employer. \r\n   \r\n\r\nWilliamson, 314 S.C. at 219, \r\n442 S.E.2d at 589 (emphasis added). The Court noted the policy in Williamson \r\nwas voluntary rather than mandatory. Id. Because the public policy rationale \r\nof the Ferguson decision was based on the mandatory nature of UM coverage, \r\nthe Williamson court's distinction between mandatory UM coverage and voluntary \r\nUIM coverage is significant.(3) \r\n\r\nWhile Williamson only addresses \r\n  setoff provisions in terms of employers' policies, we find no reason voluntary \r\n  UIM coverage held by an employee should be treated differently. Accordingly, \r\n  a setoff provision in a voluntary UIM policy would be equally enforceable whether \r\n  purchased by an employer or an employee.  \r\n   \r\nThe State Farm policy neither conflicts \r\n  with the insurance statutes nor violates the public policy of this State. Therefore, \r\n  the setoff should be applied as provided in Calcutt's UIM policy.  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n   \r\nState Farm contends the trial court \r\n  erred by improperly addressing State Farm's offer of UIM coverage when the issue \r\n  was not raised in the pleadings and no evidence was presented on the issue. \r\n  Similarly, State Farm argues the trial court erred in making a finding regarding \r\n  fault in the accident giving rise to this claim. \r\n   \r\nA declaratory judgment action to \r\n  determine coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law. Travelers \r\n  Indem. Co. v. Auto World of Orangeburg, Inc., 334 S.C. 137, 511 S.E.2d 692 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999). In an action at law, the trial judge's factual findings will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless a review of the record reveals there is no \r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings. Townes Assocs., \r\n  Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). \r\n   \r\nThe trial court stated: \r\n   \r\nWhen Mr. Calcutt purchased UIM coverage \r\n  from State Farm it was mandatory that Mr. Calcutt be provided an offer of UIM \r\n  coverage in accordance with State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. v. Wannamaker, \r\n  219 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (S.C. 1987). The mandatory offer required by Wannamaker \r\n  does not intelligibly [apprise] the insured of the insurer's claim to an offset \r\n  of UIM benefits based upon available workers['] compensation benefits.  \r\n   \r\nThis statement was unsupported by \r\n  the record before the trial court. Neither party presented evidence concerning \r\n  the form of the offer State Farm made to Calcutt. The evidence in this matter \r\n  consisted solely of the pleadings and the relevant insurance policy provisions. \r\n  Further, Calcutt never asserted a claim about the lack of an adequate offer \r\n  of UIM coverage.   \r\nSimilarly, the trial court found, \r\n  \"The driver of the other vehicle was at fault.\" This finding is also unsupported \r\n  by the record. No evidentiary basis exists in the record to support the trial \r\n  court's finding of fault.  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order \r\n  of the circuit court is   \r\nREVERSED.  \r\n   \r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  In relevant \r\n  part, Calcutt's policy for UIM coverage with State Farm provides:\r\n   \r\nAny amount payable under this coverage \r\n  shall be reduced by any amount paid or payable under any:\r\na. workers' compensation;\r\n. . . .\r\nThis does not reduce the limits of \r\n  liability of this coverage. \r\n2. \r\n Both parties refer to subsection (14); \r\nhowever, section 38-77-30 has been renumbered with no substantive change to the \r\ndefinition of an \"underinsured motor vehicle.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30 \r\n(Supp. 1997). \r\n3.  In its order \r\n  the trial court cites National Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co. v. Bang, \r\n  516 N.W.2d 313 (S.D. 1994), and Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Thompson, \r\n  552 A.2d 1382 (Pa. 1989), for the proposition that the majority of jurisdictions \r\n  considering setoff provisions have declared them invalid. However, those cases \r\n  dealt with mandatory uninsured motorist coverage, rather than voluntary underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3160","title":"West v.

Powell, of Bruner, \r\n      Powell &amp; Robbins, of Columbia, for respondent/appellant.        \r\n        ________      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n        PER CURIAM: Douglas \r\n  A. West brought this action against Joe Louis Gladney alleging Gladney defaulted \r\n  on a promissory note and seeking full payment of the note and attorneys' fees. \r\n  The trial court granted West summary judgment, awarding him $563,816.47 on the \r\n  debt, but limiting the award of attorneys' fees to $50,000. Both parties appeal. \r\n  We affirm as modified.   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nIn August 1996, West sold all of \r\n  his shares in Am-Pro Protective Agency, Inc. to Gladney. In payment thereof, \r\n  Gladney gave West $150,000 and executed a promissory note for $525,000. Because \r\n  the stock was subject to a possible first lien by NationsBank, the sales agreement \r\n  provided that Gladney, within ninety days of closing, would obtain NationsBank's \r\n  release for any liability West might incur as a result of Am-Pro's obligations \r\n  to the financial institution. When Gladney failed to make the payments required \r\n  by the note, West declared Gladney in default and accelerated all future payments. \r\n   \r\nWest filed suit on June 3, 1997. \r\n  Gladney answered and counterclaimed,(1) complaining \r\n  that a few months after the sale, Am-Pro filed for bankruptcy. He explained \r\n  that as part of the proceedings, the bankruptcy court granted NationsBank leave \r\n  to execute against all collateral held by the bank, including the stock that \r\n  is the subject of this action. Gladney contended NationsBank's actions made \r\n  it impossible for West to deliver the stock and also claimed the value of the \r\n  stock was rendered essentially worthless as a result of the bankruptcy and liquidation \r\n  proceedings. He alleged West knew or should have known at the time of the sale \r\n  about Am-Pro's financial condition and that the stock was essentially worthless. \r\n  Gladney asserted that West's failure to fully inform him of Am-Pro's true financial \r\n  status and West's failure to deliver the stock constituted failure of consideration, \r\n  misrepresentation, or concealment of material facts or all three. Not only did \r\n  Gladney contend these facts barred West from receiving any additional payments \r\n  on the note, he also asserted they justified his recouping all funds already \r\n  paid.   \r\nIn September 1997, West moved for \r\n  summary judgment on both his complaint and Gladney's counterclaim. West filed \r\n  an affidavit in support of this motion on December 31, 1997. The hearing was \r\n  originally scheduled for January 7, 1998, but was continued because of the trial \r\n  schedule of Gladney's counsel. On the day of the rescheduled hearing, some two \r\n  months later, Gladney provided West with his affidavit opposing summary judgment. \r\n   \r\n The trial court ruled that Gladney's \r\n  affidavit was not timely and should not be considered. It found West fully performed \r\n  his obligations under the sales agreement and note and that Gladney failed to \r\n  make the payments when due or satisfy West's obligation to NationsBank. The \r\n  court further held West \"neither misrepresented the value of the shares of stock \r\n  . . . nor did he know or have reason to know at or prior to the time of the \r\n  sale\" that their value was \"anything other than the sales price.\" Accordingly, \r\n  it awarded West summary judgment. The court, however, declined to award West \r\n  the full fifteen percent of the sum due as provided by the note for attorneys' \r\n  fees. Instead, it found $50,000 to be a reasonable fee.  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW  \r\n The grant of summary judgment is \r\n  proper when it is clear no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the \r\n  moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Cafe Assocs., \r\n  Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 406 S.E.2d 162 (1991). In ruling on a motion \r\n  for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and the inferences which \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \r\n  Id. at 9, 406 S.E.2d at 164. \r\n   \r\n[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) \r\n  mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and \r\n  upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish \r\n  the existence of an element essential to [that] party's case, and on which that \r\n  party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can \r\n  be 'no genuine issue as to any material fact,' since a complete failure of proof \r\n  concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders \r\n  all other facts immaterial. The moving party is 'entitled to a judgment as a \r\n  matter of law' because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing \r\n  on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden \r\n  of proof.   \r\nBaughman v. American Tel. &amp; \r\n  Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 116, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545-46 (1991) (quoting Celotex \r\n  Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)). \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n   \r\nI. Gladney's Appeal \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Timeliness of Affidavit\r\n    \r\n\r\nGladney argues the trial court erred \r\n  in holding that his affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment \r\n  filed on the date of the hearing should not be considered. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nRule 56(c) of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure specifies that when filing papers in response to motions \r\n  for summary judgment, \"[t]he adverse party may serve opposing affidavits not \r\n  later than two days before the hearing.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Our supreme court \r\n  has ruled that the trial court may, in its discretion, \"refuse to consider materials \r\n  that were not timely served such that the opposing party had no time to prepare \r\n  a response.\" Black v. Lexington Sch. Dist. No. 2, 327 S.C. 55, 60, 488 \r\n  S.E.2d 327, 329 (1997). The Black court held the trial court did not \r\n  abuse its discretion in refusing to consider an affidavit filed on the date \r\n  of the hearing when the appellant's lawyer admitted he failed to serve the affidavit \r\n  within the time required by Rule 56 and failed to assert any good excuse for \r\n  that failure. Id.   \r\nIn the present case, more than two \r\n  months passed from the time West served his affidavit until the hearing. In \r\n  spite of this generous amount of time, Gladney did not file his affidavit opposing \r\n  summary judgment until the day of the hearing. Moreover, Gladney failed to present \r\n  any good cause for his failure to timely file the affidavit. Thus, under these \r\n  circumstances, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling \r\n  the affidavit should not be considered. Accordingly, we will not consider the \r\n  affidavit in our review.  \r\n\r\n  Summary Judgment  \r\n     \r\n\r\nGladney argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting West's motion for summary judgment because the record reveals that \r\n  genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether West was guilty of making \r\n  misrepresentations. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nGladney contends his assertion of \r\n  misrepresentation encompasses negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation. \r\n  The elements of an action for fraud based on a representation include: \"(1) \r\n  a representation; (2) falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) knowledge of the falsity \r\n  or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation \r\n  be acted upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance \r\n  upon the truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's \r\n  consequent and proximate injury.\" Moorhead v. First Piedmont Bank &amp; Trust \r\n  Co., 273 S.C. 356, 359, 256 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1979). These elements must \r\n  be established by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Lundy v. Palmetto \r\n  State Life Ins. Co., 256 S.C. 506, 183 S.E.2d 335 (1971). \r\n   \r\nIn a claim for the common law tort \r\n  of negligent misrepresentation where the damage alleged is a pecuniary loss, \r\n  the plaintiff must allege and prove the following essential elements: \r\n   \r\n(1) the defendant made a false representation \r\n  to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the statement; \r\n  (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information \r\n  to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise \r\n  due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) \r\n  the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance \r\n  upon the representation.  \r\nAMA Management Corp. v. Strasburger, \r\n  309 S.C. 213, 222, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct.&nbsp;App. 1992); see also \r\n  Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468 S.E.2d 292 (1996). \r\n  As part of his case, the plaintiff must establish that his reliance on the misrepresentation \r\n  was reasonable. AMA Management Corp., 309 S.C. at 223, 420 S.E.2d at \r\n  874. \"There is no liability for casual statements, representations as to matters \r\n  of law, or matters which plaintiff could ascertain on his own in the exercise \r\n  of due diligence.\" Id. Moreover, \"there can be no reasonable reliance \r\n  on a misstatement if the plaintiff knows the truth of the matter.\" Harrington&nbsp;v. \r\n  Mikell, 321 S.C. 518, 522, 469 S.E.2d 627, 629 (Ct. App. 1996). A determination \r\n  of justifiable reliance involves the evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  \"including the positions and relations of the parties.\" Elders v. Parker, \r\n  286 S.C. 228, 233, 332 S.E.2d 563, 567 (Ct. App. 1985). \r\n   \r\nFraud based on a misrepresentation \r\n  and negligent misrepresentation both include a requirement that the plaintiff \r\n  justifiably relied on the representation made by the defendant. In the case \r\n  before us, John E. Brown, the chief executive officer of Am-Pro, negotiated \r\n  the sale of West's stock as part of an agreement Gladney entered into with Am-Pro.(2) \r\n  According to West, Gladney and his representatives had been present at Am-Pro \r\n  headquarters for a number of weeks prior to any meaningful negotiations with \r\n  him. Gladney had extensive conferences with Brown, and West contends Gladney \r\n  had more access to the financial records than did West. West also asserts Gladney \r\n  was in a better position than he to know the financial status of Am-Pro as a \r\n  result of Gladney's access to Brown and the corporation's books. West claims \r\n  he never knew on or before the date of the sale that the value of his shares \r\n  was anything other than the sales price negotiated with Gladney.  \r\n  \r\nGladney produced no evidence to refute \r\n  West's statements. Not only will we not consider Gladney's untimely affidavit, \r\n  this court ordinarily will not consider statements of fact presented only in \r\n  an attorney's argument in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  exists sufficient to preclude summary judgment. See Gilmore v. Ivey, \r\n  290 S.C. 53, 348 S.E.2d 180 (Ct. App. 1986) (ruling the trial court properly \r\n  disregarded the statements of counsel which reflected testimony appearing in \r\n  depositions not otherwise entered into evidence). We find Gladney failed to \r\n  establish a genuine issue of material fact that his reliance on any alleged \r\n  representation by West was justified. Accordingly, the trial court did not err \r\n  in granting West's motion for summary judgment. \r\n   \r\nII. West's Appeal \r\n   \r\nWest argues the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to award him attorneys' fees of fifteen percent of the amount due \r\n  when the note specifically provided for such an award. We agree. \r\n   \r\nWhen a note provides for attorneys' \r\n  fees at a specific rate in the event collection becomes necessary, the amount \r\n  of attorneys' fees is governed by the contract. Dedes&nbsp;v. Strickland, \r\n  307 S.C. 155, 414 S.E.2d 134 (1992); NationsBank v. Scott Farm, 320 S.C. \r\n  299, 305, 465 S.E.2d 98, 101 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"In South Carolina, where a contractual \r\n  obligation provides only that a party is to pay 'reasonable attorney's fees,' \r\n  the amount is unliquidated and, therefore, requires a finding on the reasonableness \r\n  of the award. On the other hand, where a contractual provision in a note provides \r\n  for attorney's fees at a specific rate, the amount of attorney fees is governed \r\n  by the contract.\"). In the note Gladney signed and presented to West, he agreed: \r\n   \r\nthat if this note be placed in the \r\n  hands of an attorney for collection, or if this debt, or any part thereof, be \r\n  collected by an attorney, or by legal proceedings, of any kind, a reasonable \r\n  attorney's fee of not less than fifteen (15%) percent, besides all costs and \r\n  expenses incident upon such collection shall be added to the amount due upon \r\n  this note, and be collectible as a part thereof. \r\n  \r\nThe note unequivocally provides for \r\n  attorneys' fees at a specified rate. It is not for us to determine whether the \r\n  parties' agreement was reasonable or wise, or whether they carefully guarded \r\n  their rights. See Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v. Litchfield, 313 S.C. \r\n  471, 438 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App.1993). Accordingly, we find West is entitled to \r\n  an award of attorneys' fees of fifteen percent of the amount due on the note. \r\n  The judgment is therefore modified to award attorneys' fees of $84,572.47. \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\n    \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., \r\n  and MOREHEAD, A.J., concur. \r\n1.  Gladney also \r\n  asserted a third party complaint against John E. Brown, the president and principal \r\n  stockholder of Am-Pro Protective Agency. This claim is not involved in the current \r\n  appeal. \r\n2.  Pursuant to \r\n  the agreement, Gladney paid $600,000 to the Internal Revenue Service on Am-Pro's \r\n  behalf and in exchange, Am-Pro agreed to reorganize the corporation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3161","title":"Gordon v.

We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n   \r\nOn September 2, 1990, James Hanley, \r\n  a Virginia resident, rear-ended Keith Gordon in Charleston, South Carolina. \r\n  Hanley was driving a Hertz rental car and was intoxicated at the time of the \r\n  accident. Gordon obtained a $150,000 judgment against Hanley. Hertz paid $25,000 \r\n  toward the judgment through its insurance carrier.\r\nGordon sought the balance of the \r\n  judgment from Hanley's personal automobile insurance policy with Colonial. Colonial \r\n  refused to pay because Hanley's coverage expired due to nonpayment of premiums \r\n  on August 23, 1990. Gordon sued Colonial.  \r\n   \r\nThe special referee heard the declaratory \r\n  judgment action and determined Virginia law applied because the Colonial policy \r\n  was a Virginia policy covering a Virginia resident. He also determined that \r\n  Hanley's Colonial policy, originally issued for a three-month term, became a \r\n  month-to-month policy that lapsed for nonpayment of premium. The special referee \r\n  found that Colonial reinstated Hanley's policy due to a clerical error but corrected \r\n  the error before it received notice of Hanley's accident. Then Colonial rewrote \r\n  Hanley's policy with an effective coverage date of September 21, 1990. Thus, \r\n  the special referee concluded Hanley did not have coverage on September&nbsp;2, \r\n  1990, the date of the accident. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n   \r\nA suit for declaratory judgment is \r\n  neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying \r\n  issue. An issue, essentially one at law, will not be transformed into one in \r\n  equity simply because declaratory relief is sought. Felts v. Richland County, \r\n  303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991). An insurance policy is a contract between \r\n  the insured and the insurance company and the terms of the policy are to be \r\n  construed according to contract law. Estate of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. \r\n  470, 484 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1997). Contract actions are actions at law. Hofer \r\n  v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 381 S.E.2d 736 (1989). In an action at law, \r\n  on appeal of a case tried without a jury, we may not disturb the trial judge's \r\n  findings of fact unless those findings are \"wholly unsupported by the evidence \r\n  or controlled by an erroneous conception or application of the law.\" Maddux \r\n  Supply Co. v. Safhi, Inc., 316 S.C. 404, 406, 450 S.E.2d 101, 102 (Ct. App. \r\n  1994).  \r\nI. \r\n   \r\nGordon first contends the special \r\n  referee was in error in applying Virginia law. We find the special referee's \r\n  conclusion that Virginia law applies is amply supported by both the law and \r\n  the evidence.   \r\nThis court has applied New York law \r\n  in a case involving a contractual dispute regarding an accident that occurred \r\n  in South Carolina because the insurance policy was executed in New York by a \r\n  New York resident, the corporation did business in New York, the car was registered \r\n  in New York, and the car was rented in New York. Unisun Ins. Co. v. Hertz \r\n  Rental Corp., 312 S.C. 549, 436 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\n   \r\nThe applicable Virginia statute provides \r\n  that \"[a]ll insurance contracts on or with respect to the ownership, maintenance \r\n  or use of property in this Commonwealth shall be deemed to have been made in \r\n  and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of this Commonwealth.\" Va. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38.2-313 (1950 &amp; Supp. 1999). This is similar to the applicable \r\n  South Carolina statute. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-61-10 (Supp. 1999) (\"All \r\n  contracts of insurance on property, lives, or interests in this State are considered \r\n  to be made in the State and all contracts of insurance the applications for \r\n  which are taken within the State are considered to have been made within this \r\n  State and are subject to the laws of this State.\").  \r\n   \r\nAs previously noted, Hanley was a \r\n  resident of Virginia. Jacqueline Davis, an underwriting manager with Colonial, \r\n  testified Colonial is a subsidiary of Nationwide Insurance Company and writes \r\n  automobile policies in Virginia. Hanley's policy was issued in Virginia to cover \r\n  lives and property in that state.  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n   \r\nGordon's additional arguments all \r\n  challenge the special referee's finding that Hanley's insurance coverage lapsed. \r\n    \r\nA. \r\n   \r\nGordon argues Colonial failed to \r\n  properly cancel Hanley's policy in accordance with Virginia statutory requirements \r\n  and Colonial retroactively canceled the coverage. Hanley's policy was not canceled, \r\n  however, it expired. Virginia case law clearly differentiates between the two: \r\n   \r\nThe cancellation and termination \r\n  by refusal to renew provisions of Virginia Code 38.2-2114 do not apply when \r\n  the policy period expires and the premium for renewal coverage has not been \r\n  paid. The cancellation provisions only apply if the insurer wishes to cancel \r\n  the policy during its stated term. Cancellation implies an ending of coverage \r\n  that would be in effect but for the cancellation. . . . The insurer cannot cancel \r\n  coverage that is not in effect. \r\n   \r\nButts v. Montgomery Mut. Ins. \r\n  Co., No. 19779, 1998 WL 972302, at *2 (Vir. Cir. Ct. Aug. 20, 1998).  \r\n   \r\nColonial complied with Virginia law \r\n  in notifying Hanley of the expiration of his policy. See Va. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38.2-2212(K) (Supp. 1999) (\"[A] motor vehicle insurance policy with a policy \r\n  period or term of five months or less may expire at its expiration date when \r\n  the insurer has manifested in writing its willingness to renew the policy for \r\n  at least thirty days and has mailed the written manifestation to the insured \r\n  at least fifteen days before the expiration date of the policy.\"). \r\n   \r\nHanley's three-month policy was converted \r\n  to a month-to-month policy. On August 1, 1990, Colonial mailed an offer to renew \r\n  Hanley's policy for an additional month. The offer indicated if the policy was \r\n  not renewed, it would expire on August 23, 1990. Hanley did not pay the premium \r\n  and the policy expired. Thus, Colonial complied with the applicable Virginia \r\n  law in notifying Hanley.   \r\nB. \r\n   \r\nNext, Gordon argues the erroneous \r\n  credit of the delinquent premium to the expired policy reinstated the coverage. \r\n  We disagree.   \r\nThe record establishes it was Colonial's \r\n  practice under the facts present in this case to rewrite a policy rather than \r\n  to renew it. A Colonial policy expires if payment is not received within ten \r\n  days of the expiration date. If payment is received more than ten days but less \r\n  than forty-five days from the date of expiration, the policy will be rewritten. \r\n  There is a lapse in coverage on a rewritten policy from the old expiration date \r\n  and the date the premium is received. A signed application is not required for \r\n  a rewrite done within this specific time period.  \r\n   \r\nHanley made a payment on September \r\n  21, 1990. Although the agent who received Hanley's payment remitted it to Colonial \r\n  with a note indicating it was for a policy rewrite, Colonial erroneously applied \r\n  the payment to the expired policy. Therefore, Colonial reinstated Hanley's policy \r\n  in error. In October 1990, the agent advised Colonial of the mistake. Colonial \r\n  corrected the error on October 29, 1990 and rewrote a policy with a new policy \r\n  number. Colonial did not receive notification of Hanley's accident until September \r\n  1994.   \r\nIn Harris v. Criterion Ins. Co., \r\n  281 S.E.2d 878 (Va. 1981), the Supreme Court of Virginia found the computer \r\n  posting of a late premium to a terminated account did not affect the previous \r\n  cancellation of the policy. It determined that the obligation to return the \r\n  unearned premium created a debtor-creditor relationship rather than affecting \r\n  the cancellation of the policy. Id. at 882. Accordingly, we find the \r\n  erroneous posting of Hanley's late premium payment to the expired policy did \r\n  not reinstate the policy. Colonial corrected this error within a reasonable \r\n  time.   \r\nC. \r\n   \r\nGordon also contends the new policy \r\n  was a pretext to avoid coverage for the accident. An examination of the record \r\n  demonstrates the evidence is uncontradicted that Colonial was not aware of Hanley's \r\n  accident at the time it corrected the clerical error. Colonial did not receive \r\n  information about the accident until almost four years later.  \r\n   \r\nD. \r\n   \r\nGordon asserts Colonial failed to \r\n  request or receive a new application for coverage from Hanley and therefore, \r\n  could not issue a new policy. This assertion is also not borne out by the record. \r\n  The evidence is clear that Colonial does not require a signed application from \r\n  the insured for a policy rewrite under these circumstances. \r\n   \r\nE. \r\n   \r\nLastly, Gordon argues Colonial waived \r\n  the right to demand prompt payment from Hanley. The record does not reveal a \r\n  course of conduct of late payment such that Colonial is estopped from rewriting \r\n  Hanley's policy. Rather the record shows Hanley's premium payment bounced once \r\n  in 1988 and once in 1990. This does not demonstrate a course of conduct. Therefore \r\n  this argument is without merit.  \r\n   \r\nBecause we find no error of law and \r\n  ample support in the record for the special referee's findings of fact, the \r\n  judgment of the court below is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J. and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3163","title":"State v.

Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Angelo \r\n  Muldrow appeals his conviction for armed robbery. He argues the court erred \r\n  in denying his directed verdict motion because the evidence failed to show that \r\n  he was \"armed\" while allegedly committing a robbery. We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n   \r\nOn January 4, 1997, a man walked \r\n  into the Carolina Shell Station in Kingstree and asked the store clerk for a \r\n  pack of cigarettes. When the clerk retrieved the cigarettes, the man \"flashed \r\n  a note\" at her that read \"give me all your cash or I'll shoot you.\" The clerk \r\n  asked the man if he was serious, and he said \"yes,\" that he was not \"B.S.ing,\" \r\n  and to \"hurry up and give [him] the money before he shot [her].\" The clerk opened \r\n  the cash register and gave him the money. As the man was leaving the store, \r\n  he told her that if she called the police, he \"was coming back for [her].\" At \r\n  no time during the robbery did the man display a weapon. Muldrow was subsequently \r\n  arrested and indicted for armed robbery. \r\n   \r\nFollowing the prosecution's case \r\n  at trial, Muldrow moved for a directed verdict. The trial judge denied the motion. \r\n  A jury convicted Muldrow of armed robbery, and the judge sentenced him to thirty \r\n  years imprisonment.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS  \r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict motion in a criminal case, we must view the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to the State.(1) In doing so, we are \r\n  concerned with the existence of the evidence and not its weight.(2) \r\n   \r\nMuldrow argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying his directed verdict motion because the State's evidence failed to \r\n  show either that he was armed with a deadly weapon or that he used a representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon or any object that a person during the commission of the \r\n  robbery reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Section 16-11-330(A) \r\n  states a person is guilty of armed robbery if he or she commits robbery \"while \r\n  alleging, either by action or words, he was armed while using a representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon or any object which a person present during the commission \r\n  of the robbery reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon . . . .\"(3) \r\n    \r\nMuldrow argues the State only proved \r\n  that he alleged he was armed, not that he did so while using a representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon.(4) We disagree. \r\n   \r\nMuldrow's interpretation of the statute \r\n  is unduly narrow. He would require the phrase \"representation of a deadly weapon\" \r\n  to be an object that one present during the commission of the robbery reasonably \r\n  believed to be a deadly weapon. The statute does not so read; instead, it requires \r\n  either that the robber allege he or she was armed while using a representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon or that the robber allege he or she was armed while \r\n  using any object that a person present during the robbery reasonably believed \r\n  to be a deadly weapon. The statute does not require that the \"representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon\" also be an object that a person present during the commission \r\n  of a robbery would reasonably believe to be a deadly weapon. Such a requirement \r\n  would render the phrase \"representation of a deadly weapon\" surplusage.(5) \r\n   \r\nWe hold the phrase \"representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon\" includes words that convey to a victim the thought that \r\n  a robber possesses a deadly weapon.(6) Here, \r\n  Muldrow's note and his words conveyed the thought that he was in fact armed \r\n  and capable of fulfilling his promise to shoot the clerk if she did not comply \r\n  with his demand for money. Indeed, the store clerk obviously believed Muldrow's \r\n  representation because she gave him the money that he demanded.  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   \r\nHOWARD, J., concurs. \r\n   \r\nMOREHEAD, A.J., dissents \r\nin a separate opinion.   \r\nMOREHEAD, A.J., dissenting: \r\n  I respectfully dissent. As the majority opinion correctly states, a person is \r\n  guilty of armed robbery if he commits robbery \"while alleging, either by action \r\n  or words, he was armed while using a representation of a deadly weapon or any \r\n  object which a person present during the commission of the robbery reasonably \r\n  believed to be a deadly weapon.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  The statute requires the robber to allege he is armed by action or words and, \r\n  separately, to use either a representation of a deadly weapon or an object one \r\n  could reasonably believe to be a deadly weapon. \r\n   \r\nThe majority asserts that, by orally \r\n  threatening to shoot the clerk, Muldrow alleged he was armed and, by presenting \r\n  the written note, Muldrow used a representation of a deadly weapon. I disagree. \r\n  I believe the note was a mere allegation that Muldrow was armed rather than \r\n  a representation of a deadly weapon. What if an unarmed robber enters a store \r\n  and twice orally threatens to shoot the clerk without doing anything more? In \r\n  that situation, clearly he is not guilty of armed robbery. I find it difficult \r\n  to distinguish between that hypothetical situation and Muldrow's situation.\r\n  \r\nThe statute is stretched too far \r\n  by allowing a written note to be a representation of a deadly weapon. I do not \r\n  believe a mere statement, written or oral, can be a representation of a deadly \r\n  weapon. See Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999) \r\n  (penal statutes should be strictly construed against the State and in favor \r\n  of the defendant).\r\n\r\nI also do not believe a representation \r\n  of a deadly weapon requires the presentation of an object, as asserted by Muldrow. \r\n  There are circumstances under which a robber could represent that he had a deadly \r\n  weapon without using an object. If Muldrow had patted his hip pocket while threatening \r\n  to shoot the clerk, there would be evidence he was guilty of armed robbery. \r\n  Under those circumstances, patting the hip pocket would be a representation \r\n  but not an object.\r\n   \r\nWhile I believe Muldrow was guilty \r\n  of robbery, I cannot agree Muldrow was guilty of armed robbery in this case. \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority's interpretation \r\n  of the armed robbery statute.\r\n1.

Gossett, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J.: Jason \r\n  T. appeals, asserting the family court was without jurisdiction to accept his \r\nguilty plea to receiving stolen goods. We agree and vacate.(1)   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY  \r\nWhile outside his school's gym, Jason \r\n  observed another juvenile stealing a coat and jewelry from a car. The other \r\n  juvenile gave Jason the coat, presumably to ensure his silence. Jason was later \r\n  seen wearing the coat.  \r\nAn assistant solicitor filed a juvenile \r\n  petition charging Jason with petit larceny. When Jason appeared before the family \r\n  court, however, he pled guilty to receiving stolen goods. \r\n   \r\nPursuant to Anders v. California, \r\n  386 U.S. 738 (1967), Jason's appellate counsel filed an appeal and a petition \r\n  to be relieved as counsel. This court denied counsel's petition to be relieved \r\n  and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the family court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to accept Jason's guilty plea. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\nJason contends the family court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea and adjudicate him delinquent \r\n  on the charge of receiving stolen goods when the juvenile petition charged him \r\n  with petit larceny. We agree.(2) \r\n   \r\nIn a court of general sessions,(3) \r\n  with the exception of certain minor offenses, the circuit court lacks subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea unless there is an indictment sufficiently \r\n  stating the offense, there is a waiver of indictment, or the charge pled to \r\n  is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment. Carter \r\n  v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998). Any waiver of presentment \r\n  must be in writing. See Summerall v. State, 278 S.C. 255, 294 \r\n  S.E.2d 344 (1982); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-23-130 to -140 (1985). \r\n    \r\nFor an indictment to be valid, it \r\n  must state the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable \r\n  the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer. Carter, 329 S.C. \r\n  at 362-3, 495 S.E.2d at 777. This requirement that a defendant receive notice \r\n  of the charges against him is rooted in due process. See State v. \r\n  Butler, 277 S.C. 452, 456, 290 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1982), overruled in part \r\n  on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 69 n.13, 406 \r\n  S.E.2d 315, 329 n.5 (1991).  \r\n   \r\nThese same due process concerns extend \r\n  to juvenile proceedings. Our supreme court has held that the fairness and due \r\n  process requirements that ensure an adult criminal defendant will receive sufficient \r\n  notice of the charges against him also apply to juvenile matters. In re Corey \r\n  B., 291 S.C. 108, 109-10, 352 S.E.2d 470 (1987) (holding a juvenile cannot \r\n  be found guilty of a greater offense than alleged in the petition); see \r\n  also In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 30-33 (1967) (holding the due process \r\n  protections requiring notice of the alleged charges extends to juveniles); In \r\n  re Arisha K.S., 331 S.C. 288, 293, 501 S.E.2d 128, 131 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"[A] \r\n  child in a juvenile proceeding has a right to fundamental due process and thus, \r\n  our courts must ensure that due process and fair treatment surround a juvenile's \r\n  plea of guilty.\").  \r\nBased on the due process protections \r\n  governing juvenile proceedings and the exemplary procedure employed in courts \r\n  of general sessions to preserve adults' due process rights, we now hold that \r\n  a family court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a juvenile delinquent \r\n  for a charge not alleged in the juvenile petition unless the adjudication is \r\n  for a lesser included offense or there has been a written waiver of notice.(4) \r\n  Consequently, the notice requirement is not satisfied by merely serving notice \r\n  of a delinquency proceeding without notifying the juvenile and his parents of \r\n  the charges to be considered at the family court hearing. See In \r\n  re Gault, 387 U.S. at 33. To hold otherwise would violate a juvenile's due \r\n  process right to notice. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. at 33 (holding \r\n  due process protections extend to juveniles and require a child and his parents \r\n  or guardian to be notified in writing, and sufficiently in advance of the hearing, \r\n  of the specific charge or factual allegations to be considered at the hearing); \r\n  In re Corey B., 291 S.C. at 109-10, 352 S.E.2d at 470. \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, Jason appeared \r\n  before the family court on a petition charging him with petit larceny. However, \r\n  Jason pled guilty to receiving stolen goods. There is no indication in the record \r\n  that Jason or his parents waived his right to notice. Furthermore, receiving \r\n  stolen goods is not a lesser included offense of petit larceny. See \r\n  State v. Martin, 278 S.C. 256 n.1, 294 S.E.2d 345 n.1 (1982) (noting \r\n  that receiving stolen goods is not a lesser-included offense of larceny). Therefore, \r\n  the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept Jason's guilty \r\n  plea and adjudicate him delinquent for receiving stolen goods. \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family \r\n  court's adjudication is  \r\nVACATED. \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n1. \r\n We decide this case without \r\noral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  Issues \r\n  related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time and may be \r\n  raised sua sponte by the court. \r\n  \r\nCarter v. State, 329 \r\nS.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998); see also In re Terrence \r\nM., 317 S.C. 212, 215, 452 S.E.2d 626, 627 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n3.  \r\nWe recognize that juvenile \r\ndelinquency proceedings in family court do not require presenting an indictment \r\nto a grand jury, unlike criminal cases in circuit court. Nevertheless, we find \r\nthe practice followed in a court of general sessions provides useful instruction \r\nin resolving the case at bar. \r\n4.  \r\n  Several other jurisdictions, although not specifically addressing this issue \r\n  in the context of a guilty plea, are in accord with our holding. See, e.g., \r\n  In re Davis, 441 S.E.2d 696 (N.C. Ct. App. 1994) (holding the trial court \r\n  cannot adjudicate a juvenile delinquent on a charge different than the charge \r\n  listed in the juvenile petition, unless it is a lesser included offense or there \r\n  has been a waiver, because it violates the juvenile's due process right to advance \r\n  written notice of the charge to be considered by the trial court); D.P. v. \r\n  State, 200 S.E.2d 499 (Ga. Ct. App. 1973) (holding a juvenile may not be \r\n  adjudicated delinquent for an offense which is neither the crime charged in \r\n  the juvenile petition nor a lesser included offense of the charge); D.M.M. \r\n  v. State, 275 So.2d 308, 310 (Fla. Dist. Ct.

On appeal, \r\n  Robert raises several issues regarding the family court's exclusion of his polygraph \r\n  examination results. He also argues the State failed to prove the alleged offenses \r\n  occurred during the time period referenced in the juvenile petition. We affirm \r\n  in part and remand for a hearing pursuant to State v. Council, 335 S.C. \r\n  1, 515 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 588, 145 L.Ed.2d \r\n  489 (1999).  \r\nTwo minor females alleged Robert \r\n  committed a variety of sexual assaults upon them, forced them to perform sex \r\n  acts on him, and performed sex acts in their presence. The alleged victims, \r\n  who were seven and nine years old at trial, testified the assaults occurred \r\n  while Robert babysat them at their great-grandmother's home and their grandmother's \r\n  home. Their great-grandmother testified Robert babysat the alleged victims at \r\n  her home and at their grandmother's home while they lived with her during 1997 \r\n  and part of 1996.  \r\nI. Subject \r\n  Matter Jurisdiction \r\n   \r\nThe State argues Robert served his \r\n  notice of appeal late, depriving this court of subject matter jurisdiction over \r\n  his appeal. We disagree.  \r\nIn order to obtain appellate review \r\n  of a conviction in general sessions, the convicted person must serve a notice \r\n  of appeal within ten days after the sentence is imposed. Rule 203(b)(2), SCACR. \r\n  A juvenile adjudicated delinquent in family court must also serve a notice of \r\n  appeal within ten days after the sentence is imposed. Rule 203(b)(3), SCACR. \r\n  In computing time limits under our appellate court rules, the date of the triggering \r\n  event is not counted. Rule 234(a), SCACR. The last day of the period is counted, \r\n  however, \"unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or a state or federal holiday, in \r\n  which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a \r\n  Saturday, Sunday nor such holiday.\" Rule 234(a), SCACR. \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the family court imposed \r\n  its sentence at a dispositional hearing on May 14, 1998. Robert served his notice \r\n  of appeal twelve days later on May 26. The tenth day after Robert's dispositional \r\n  hearing, May 24, was a Sunday and the following day was Memorial Day, which \r\n  is both a state and a federal holiday. See 5 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6103(a) (West \r\n  1996) (Memorial Day is a federal holiday); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 53-5-10 (Supp. 1999) \r\n  (Memorial Day is a state holiday). Robert timely served his notice of appeal \r\n  on May 26 because the prior two days were not used in computing his time to \r\n  serve. We, therefore, conclude we have subject matter jurisdiction to review \r\n  his appeal.  \r\nII. Polygraph \r\n  Evidence  \r\nRobert first argues the family court \r\n  abused its discretion in refusing to admit evidence that he passed a polygraph \r\n  test concerning the allegations against him. He specifically asserts three arguments: \r\n  (1) this court should adopt the Daubert(1) \r\n  standard for assessing the admissibility of scientific evidence, (2) the per \r\n  se rule against the admission of polygraph evidence has been overruled by the \r\n  South Carolina Rules of Evidence, and (3) the exclusion of the polygraph results \r\n  in this case constituted prejudicial error. \r\n   \r\nWe initially address the issue of \r\n  whether there was a sufficient proffer in this case to review this argument \r\n  on appeal. The pertinent rule of evidence states, \"[e]rror may not be predicated \r\n  upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of \r\n  the party is affected, and . . . the substance of the evidence and the specific \r\n  evidentiary basis supporting admission were made known to the court by offer \r\n  or were apparent from the context.\" Rule 103(a), SCRE. In this case, Robert \r\n  argued the polygraph results should have been admitted, citing the Daubert \r\n  case. Robert stated on the record that Joseph Gallimore, who has been conducting \r\n  polygraph examinations for twenty years, intended to testify that he found Robert \r\n  to be honest and truthful. Gallimore specifically would have testified that \r\n  he asked Robert, \"did you ever engage in any sex act with [victim] and his answer \r\n  was no; did you ever engage in any sex act with [other victim] and his answer \r\n  was no.\" We conclude Robert sufficiently stated the basis for the admission \r\n  of the evidence and sufficiently proffered evidence of the substance of Gallimore's \r\n  testimony regarding Robert's polygraph examination. This issue, therefore, is \r\n  preserved for our review.  \r\nIn Daubert, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court adopted a new federal standard for determining the admissibility \r\n  of scientific evidence. 509 U.S. at 589 n.6. The decision indicated the adoption \r\n  of the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 702, necessitated the new \r\n  approach. See Daubert 509 U.S. at 587-89. That rule states: \r\n   \r\nIf scientific, technical, or other \r\n  specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence \r\n  or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, \r\n  skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of \r\n  an opinion or otherwise.  \r\nFed. R. Evid. 702. Although Rule \r\n  702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is identical to Rule 702 of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Evidence, our state supreme court recently declined to adopt the Daubert \r\n  standard. See Council, 335 S.C. at 20, 515 S.E.2d at 518. The \r\n  court concluded \"the proper analysis for determining admissibility of scientific \r\n  evidence is now under the SCRE.\" Id. at 20, 515 S.E.2d at 518. The court \r\n  explained, \"[w]hen admitting scientific evidence under Rule 702, SCRE, the trial \r\n  judge must find the evidence will assist the trier of fact, the expert witness \r\n  is qualified, and the underlying science is reliable.\" Id. In determining \r\n  reliability, the trial court should consider several factors, including: \r\n   \r\n(1) the publications and peer review \r\n  of the technique; (2) prior application of the method to the type of evidence \r\n  involved in the case; (3) the quality control procedures used to ensure reliability; \r\n  and (4) the consistency of the method with recognized scientific laws and procedures. \r\n   \r\nId. at 19, 515 S.E.2d at 517 \r\n  (citing State v. Ford, 301 S.C. 485, 392 S.E.2d 781 (1990)).(2) \r\n  Additionally, evidence admissible under Rule 702 should be evaluated under Rule \r\n  403, SCRE, to \"determine if its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial \r\n  effect.\" Id. at 20, 515 S.E.2d at 518. \"Once the evidence is admitted \r\n  under these standards, the jury may give it such weight as it deems appropriate.\" \r\n  Id. at 20-21, 515 S.E.2d at 518.(3) \r\n   \r\nIn addition to announcing the current \r\n  standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence, the court in Council \r\n  also considered whether the trial court's refusal to admit polygraph evidence \r\n  constituted an abuse of discretion. 335 S.C. at 21, 515 S.E.2d at 518. During \r\n  the penalty phase of his trial for numerous charges, including murder, Council \r\n  attempted to admit evidence that another person's polygraph examination concerning \r\n  the victim's death indicated deception. The trial court, relying on case law \r\n  holding polygraph evidence inadmissible as unreliable and finding that the science \r\n  of polygraph had not improved, refused to admit the evidence. On review, the \r\n  supreme court stated, \"[t]his Court has consistently held the results of polygraph \r\n  examinations are generally not admissible because the reliability of the tests \r\n  is questionable.\" Id. at 23, 515 S.E.2d at 519. The court also acknowledged \r\n  the United States Supreme Court's recent holding, citing the absence of a consensus \r\n  on the reliability of polygraph evidence, \"that a per se rule against the admission \r\n  of polygraph evidence does not violate a defendant's right to present relevant \r\n  evidence in his defense as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\" Id. \r\n  at 24, 515 S.E.2d at 520 (citing United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. \r\n  303 (1998)). Despite the general prohibition on the admission of polygraph results, \r\n  the court stated, \"in light of the adoption of the SCRE, admissibility of this \r\n  type of scientific evidence should be analyzed under Rules 702 and 403, SCRE \r\n  and the Jones factors.\" Id. \r\n   \r\nBefore the decision in Council, \r\n  our supreme court repeatedly held polygraph examination results are generally \r\n  inadmissible. See State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d 795 \r\n  (1999); State v. Wright, 322 S.C. 253, 471 S.E.2d 700 (1996); State \r\n  v. Pressley, 290 S.C. 251, 349 S.E.2d 403 (1986). This rule grew from questions \r\n  concerning the reliability of polygraph tests. See Wright, 322 \r\n  S.C. at 255, 471 S.E.2d at 701 (\"Generally, the results of polygraph examinations \r\n  are inadmissible because the reliability of the polygraph is questionable.\"). \r\n  Even though the SCRE became effective September 3, 1995, the per se rule against \r\n  the admission of polygraph results appeared to remain intact until the decision \r\n  in Council. See Rule 1103(b), SCRE (SCRE became effective September \r\n  3, 1995); Johnson, 334 S.C. at 90, 512 S.E.2d at 801 (citing the general \r\n  inadmissibility rule).  \r\nRelying on case law which expresses \r\n  the per se rule excluding polygraph results, it is understandable why the family \r\n  court refused to admit the evidence. However, because the family court applied \r\n  the per se rule rather than having analyzed the admissibility under the SCRE \r\n  and the Jones factors, we do not have enough information to determine \r\n  whether the evidence was properly excluded. We, therefore, remand to the family \r\n  court for a hearing under Council to determine whether Robert's polygraph \r\n  results should have been admitted. If the family court, in its discretion, decides \r\n  the evidence is admissible under the standard explained in Council, it \r\n  should order a new trial.  \r\nIII. Dates \r\n  of the Alleged Offenses \r\n   \r\nRobert next argues the State failed \r\n  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged offenses occurred between \r\n  August 1996 and September 1997, as alleged in the juvenile petition. He points \r\n  to the alleged victims' difficulty in pinpointing the dates of the charged offenses \r\n  and to testimony of other witnesses that he had no contact with the alleged \r\n  victims during the relevant time. We find no error. \r\n   \r\nRobert cites the following passage \r\n  from State v. Pierce, 263 S.C. 23, 207 S.E.2d 414 (1974), for the proposition \r\n  that the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged \r\n  offense occurred within the time span referenced in the juvenile petition: \r\n   \r\nWhile it is true that the State need \r\n  not prove the exact date set forth in the indictment unless time is an essential \r\n  element of the offense or is made a party [sic] of the description of it, the \r\n  State should not be allowed to prove a different date than that set forth in \r\n  the indictment where defendant relies upon the defense of alibi, unless the \r\n  defendant is held to have had knowledge that the State would attempt to prove \r\n  a different date upon trial. \r\n   \r\n263 S.C. at 27, 207 S.E.2d at 416 \r\n  (citation omitted). The language from Pierce suggests that, in cases \r\n  where the defendant asserts an alibi, as in this case, the State is not permitted \r\n  to prove the crime occurred on a date other than the date in the indictment \r\n  without advance warning. Pierce, however, does not require the State \r\n  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense occurred on the date referenced \r\n  in the indictment.  \r\nAlthough the alleged victims were \r\n  unable to pinpoint consistently the dates of the alleged offenses, it appears \r\n  this was caused by their young ages rather than an attempt by the State to prove \r\n  the sexual assaults occurred at times other than those referenced in the juvenile \r\n  petition. Moreover, while Robert attempted to establish an alibi for the dates \r\n  in question through witnesses who testified he had no contact with the girls \r\n  during the time set forth in the juvenile petition, the alleged victims' great-grandmother \r\n  testified that while the girls were living with her, Robert did babysit them \r\n  during the alleged time frame at her home and her daughter's home. \r\n   \r\nFor the reasons discussed above, \r\n  Robert's delinquency adjudication is affirmed in part and the case is remanded \r\n  for a hearing consistent with this opinion. \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED. \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  Daubert \r\n  v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). \r\n2.  The court \r\n  in Council refers to these considerations as the Jones factors \r\n  after State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979), which established \r\n  this state's former standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence. \r\n3.  Although our \r\n  supreme court in Council declined to adopt the Daubert standard, \r\n  instead selecting an approach based on both the South Carolina Rules of Evidence \r\n  and prior South Carolina case law, at least one observer has noted that the \r\n  two standards are \"very similar.\" See G.

Both parties \r\n  moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied Padgett's motion and granted \r\n  the IRF's motion for summary judgement. Padgett appeals. We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFacts \r\n   \r\nOn September 18, 1992, Wilson approached \r\n  one of his students to engage in a conversation. Padgett was standing beside \r\n  Wilson's student. Padgett alleged that Wilson \"approached her [during the conversation] \r\n  and without her consent laid hands on her in a sexually coercive manner.\" \r\n   \r\nPadgett brought suit against Wilson \r\n  in the United States District Court in January of 1993. She claimed battery, \r\n  outrage, and violation of her constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 for \r\n  the sexual harassment. The claim for outrage was dismissed, but the other claims \r\n  were submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Padgett \r\n  and awarded her $2,500 actual damages for assault and battery; $2,500 actual \r\n  damages for the sexual harassment claim; and $20,000 in punitive damages for \r\n  the Â§1983 claim, which would increase to $100,000 in the event that Wilson was \r\n  insured. A judgment for $25,000 was entered on August 16, 1994. \r\n   \r\nThe IRF issued a general tort liability \r\n  policy to the named insured, South Carolina State University. Prior to the trial, \r\n  attorneys for the IRF participated fully in the discovery process. However, \r\n  the IRF determined Wilson was not an insured as defined by the policy and denied \r\n  coverage. The IRF's attorneys did not participate any further in the trial. \r\n  Wilson did not challenge this finding during the first trial, nor did he make \r\n  any appearance in this declaratory judgment action. \r\n   \r\nPadgett filed this declaratory judgment \r\n  action to determine if coverage existed under the policy. Both parties filed \r\n  summary judgment motions. Padgett's motion was denied by order filed May 21, \r\n  1996. The IRF's motion was granted by order dated September 3, 1997. \r\n   \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In determining whether any triable \r\n  issues of fact exist to preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences \r\n  which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, \r\n  332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998). If any triable factual issues exist, those \r\n  issues must go to the jury. Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  366 (1991). Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously \r\n  invoked so no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed \r\n  factual issues. Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 537 (1991).  \r\nScope of Official Duties Under \r\n  Policy  \r\nPadgett argues Wilson meets the definition \r\n  of an \"insured\" under the general tort liability policy. She argues Wilson was \r\n  acting in the scope of his official duties when he committed the battery and \r\n  sexual assault. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nThe policy contains the following \r\n  definition of \"Persons Insured\"  \r\n   \r\nAny employee of the entity designated \r\n  in the declaration as \"named insured\" is an insured, but only while the employee \r\n  is acting in the scope of his or her official duties. (Emphasis \r\n  in original.)  \r\nUnder this definition, Wilson only \r\n  qualifies for coverage when his actions are in the \"scope of his official duties.\" \r\n  Under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, a government employee acts \"within \r\n  the scope of his official duty\" when the employee is (1) \"acting in and about \r\n  the official business of the government entity,\" and (2) \"performing official \r\n  duties.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(i) (1977 &amp; Supp.1999).(1) \r\n   \r\nWhat is within the scope \r\n  of employment may be determined by implication from the circumstances of the \r\n  case. One factor is whether the employee was acting in furtherance of the employer's \r\n  business when the accident happened. . . . An act falls within the scope of \r\n  the servant's employment if it was reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose \r\n  of the servant's employment, and it was done in furtherance of the master's \r\n  business.  \r\nWade v. Berkeley County, \r\n  330 S.C. 311, 319, 498 S.E.2d 684, 688 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\nWilson's actions in this \r\n  case were not within the scope of his official duties. Cf. Loadholt v. South \r\n  Carolina Budget &amp; Control Bd., Op. No. 3116 (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. \r\n  6 at 1) (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 14, 2000) (sexual misconduct of sheriff with \r\n  department employees, after summoning employees into his office under pretext \r\n  of discussing jail or departmental business, outside scope of official duties \r\n  and not covered by IRF policy); Doe v. South Carolina Budget &amp; Control \r\n  Bd., 329 S.C. 214, 494 S.E.2d 469 (Ct. App. 1997), aff'd 337 S.C. \r\n  294, 523 S.E.2d 457 (1999) (police officer who stopped female motorists on suspicion \r\n  of DUI and gave them the option of being arrested or providing sexual favors \r\n  acted outside scope of official duties). Wilson was not providing instruction, \r\n  acting in his capacity as a faculty member, or furthering Padgett's education. \r\n  In fact, Padgett was not even a student of Wilson's, nor did she know who he \r\n  was until after the incident. \r\n   \r\nPadgett argues Wilson's \r\n  scope of official duties should be construed broadly due to the relationship \r\n  between students and professors. She maintains professors are intimately involved \r\n  in the lives of the students, acting as counselors, advisors, and consolers. \r\n  She further opines that Wilson's mingling with students in the lobby was within \r\n  the scope of his duties, since professors must maintain working relationships \r\n  with students. Even under this broad scope of duties, Wilson's actions against \r\n  Padgett were outside the scope of his official duties. See Doe, \r\n  329 S.C. at 220, 494 S.E.2d at 472 (citing South Carolina Med. Malpractice \r\n  Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting Ass'n v. Ferry, 291 S.C. 460, 463, 354 S.E.2d \r\n  378, 381 (1987)) (stating the scope of an employee's duties does not include \r\n  all forms of conduct engaged in by members of the employee's profession). \r\n   \r\nAmbiguity in Insurance \r\n  Contract  \r\nPadgett next argues the \r\n  contract contains ambiguities which should be construed in favor of providing \r\n  coverage for Wilson's acts. \"A contract is ambiguous only when it may fairly \r\n  and reasonably be understood in more ways than one. Where the language of a \r\n  contract is plain and capable of legal construction, that language alone determines \r\n  the instrument's force and effect.\" Jordan v. Security Group, Inc., 311 \r\n  S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993) (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\nThe alleged ambiguity arises \r\n  when the policy's definition of personal injury is compared with the definition \r\n  of persons insured. The policy defines personal injury to include injury arising \r\n  out of \"discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, religion or handicap.\" \r\n  Wilson argues the policy's coverage of discrimination is inconsistent with the \r\n  definition of \"persons insured\" because under a restrictive definition of persons \r\n  insured, discrimination would always be outside the scope of the employee's \r\n  official duties. She maintains this creates a discrepancy that mandates a broader \r\n  definition of \"persons insured\" so as to provide coverage for Wilson's actions. \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nThe policy's coverage of \r\n  discrimination is not inconsistent with its definition of an insured because \r\n  discrimination may be alleged where an employee has acted within the scope of \r\n  his or her official duties. For example, if a person charged with making personnel \r\n  decisions is accused of discriminating in hiring or firing someone, the alleged \r\n  discrimination falls within the scope of that person's official duties. Additionally, \r\n  the IRF policy covers the University as a separate entity. The University would \r\n  be insured against the discrimination committed by its employees. The policy \r\n  is not ambiguous.  \r\nBecause Wilson's actions \r\n  were outside the scope of his official duties and the policy is unambiguous, \r\n  the decision of the trial court is  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n    \r\nCURETON, STILWELL \r\n  and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  \r\n  The IRF changed the policy definition of \"insured\" in response to South Carolina \r\n  Budget and Control Board v. Prince, 304 S.C. 241, 403 S.E.2d 643 (1991). \r\n  When Prince was decided, the IRF policy covered employees acting \"in \r\n  the course of employment.\" Our supreme court held the policy's coverage of employees \r\n  \"in the course of employment\" was broader than the Tort Claims Act's coverage \r\n  of employees acting \"in the scope of official duty.\" Id. The IRF amended \r\n  its insurance policy, effective January 1, 1991, to mirror the Tort Claims Act \r\n  by covering a State employee \"only while . . . acting in the scope of his or \r\n  her official duties.\" Therefore, the definition of \"scope of official duty\" \r\n  in the Tort Claims Act is useful in determining the phrase's meaning under the \r\n  IRF policy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3167","title":"Parker v.

Shecut (Win) and Marion A. Shecut, \r\n  III (Bo), to partition their mother's estate in accordance with her will rather \r\n  than a private agreement (Agreement) executed by the siblings after her death. \r\n  Anne also sought an accounting of estate income. Bo and Win counterclaimed for \r\n  breach of the Agreement and sought its specific performance along with damages \r\n  associated with the breach. In bifurcated proceedings, the Master-In-Equity \r\n  found the Agreement valid and ordered its specific performance as well as awarding \r\n  damages to Bo and Win. The master also partitioned most of the property which \r\n  the Agreement conveyed to Anne and Bo jointly. Anne appeals. We affirm in part, \r\n  reverse in part and remand in part. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n   \r\nMary Shecut (Mrs. Shecut) died testate \r\n  on October 30, 1992, leaving a taxable estate of $1,272,280 in equal shares \r\n  to Win, Bo, and Anne. The bulk of the estate consisted of agricultural and commercial \r\n  property in Orangeburg County and a beach house on Edisto Island. Mrs. Shecut's \r\n  will nominated Win and Bo to serve as co-executors of her estate. \r\n   \r\nSeveral days after their mother's \r\n  death, Win and Bo collected her personal property from several lock-boxes which \r\n  she maintained at different banks. The three siblings divided the contents of \r\n  the lock-boxes and other personal property among themselves. Anne maintains \r\n  the siblings planned to have their respective portions appraised to ensure equal \r\n  distribution. Any difference in value would be evened out with the contents \r\n  of additional lock-boxes. Win and Bo claim the division was final and denied \r\n  the existence of additional lock-boxes. Anne's portion included a coin collection \r\n  which she sold for $11,677, as well as jewelry and sterling silver flatware \r\n  which she sold for an estimated $7,000 to $9,000. Win did not have his portion \r\n  appraised, but estimated it was worth between $2,000 and $4,000. The record \r\n  does not contain a valuation of Bo's portion. \r\n   \r\nAnne also received other personal \r\n  property from the estate including a Cadillac which she sold for $1,400 and \r\n  furniture from her mother's house which Win stored for safekeeping until Anne \r\n  could take the furniture to her home in Atlanta. The furniture remained in storage \r\n  for more than three years until Win transferred the furniture to a barn on his \r\n  farm.  \r\nSeveral months after their mother's \r\n  death, the parties began arguing over the distribution of the estate. The first \r\n  point of contention concerned a house and two acres of land known as Bo's residence. \r\n  In 1978, Mrs. Shecut transferred the two acre lot to Bo and he built the house \r\n  on it. Bo later reconveyed the house and lot to his mother because he was having \r\n  drug and marital problems. Bo continued living in the house and treating it \r\n  as his own after the reconveyance. Win thought the house should be included \r\n  in the estate, but Anne and Bo thought it should be excluded. \r\n   \r\nThe other major point of contention \r\n  between the parties involved the distribution of specific estate assets. Win, \r\n  a farmer, sought certain farmland and agricultural equipment from the estate \r\n  which he had used in his farming operations prior to his mother's death. He \r\n  also wanted his share of the estate severed from that of Anne's and Bo's to \r\n  distance himself from the various disputes raging between the parties. Anne \r\n  and Bo were both interested in the estate's commercial property and the beach \r\n  house. The three siblings agreed that Win would receive the property he sought \r\n  while Anne and Bo would jointly receive the remainder of the estate. To manage \r\n  their joint properties and the income they produced, Anne and Bo formed a parol \r\n  partnership called Shecut Investments.(1) The \r\n  parties instructed the estate's attorney, Carole H. Gunter, to prepare an Agreement \r\n  which effectuated their desires. The parties executed the Agreement on April \r\n  6, 1993. Win received a house in Orangeburg, several tracts of farmland, and \r\n  a portion of a tract of farmland known as the Cope property. Win's portion of \r\n  the Cope property was delineated by an orange line drawn on an aerial photograph. \r\n  The photograph was attached to the Agreement. Anne and Bo jointly received the \r\n  remaining farmland, commercial property, a lot in Live Oak subdivision, a mortgage \r\n  on 11.87 acres owned by Calhoun Construction Company, and the beach house. Bo \r\n  also received sole ownership of his residence and its appurtenant two acres, \r\n  but he was required to reimburse his siblings for any estate taxes generated \r\n  by his residence. Any estate assets not covered by the Agreement were to be \r\n  distributed equally among the parties after the estate's expenses and taxes \r\n  were paid. Additionally, Win and Bo were to receive $7,500 each for serving \r\n  as personal representatives. \r\n   \r\nAfter the Agreement was executed, \r\n  each party treated his or her allotted property and any associated income as \r\n  their own and continued to do so until Anne filed this action in August, 1995. \r\n  Win farmed and operated property he received to the exclusion of Anne and Bo. \r\n  Likewise, Anne and Bo managed their properties through Shecut Investments to \r\n  Win's exclusion. Trouble arose shortly after the Agreement was executed when \r\n  Win realized three pieces of farming equipment, which he believed the parties \r\n  had agreed to allot to him, were omitted from the Agreement. Win raised the \r\n  omission with his siblings and became angry at their failure to quickly remedy \r\n  it. Anne claimed Win threatened to repudiate the Agreement unless he was given \r\n  the equipment and an additional $20,000. Win denied the allegation. \r\n   \r\nIn a letter to Win dated June 20, \r\n  1993, Anne acknowledged she and Bo had agreed to allot the omitted farm equipment \r\n  to him and indicated they would both sign an addendum to the Agreement correcting \r\n  this omission. The estate's attorney prepared an Addendum which was signed by \r\n  all parties.(2) The Addendum allotted the farm \r\n  equipment to Win, gave Bo a share of stock in the Orangeburg Country Club and \r\n  stated that \"[t]he parties hereto reaffirm the Private Agreement which they \r\n  signed on April 6, 1993. They agree to carry out all provisions of that agreement.\" \r\n   \r\nTo effectuate the Agreement and the \r\n  Addendum, the parties asked their cousin, attorney Charles Williams, to prepare \r\n  the necessary deeds. Attorney Edgar W. Dickson, who practices law with Williams, \r\n  attempted to transfer the estate's property pursuant to the Agreement by preparing \r\n  two sets of deeds. The first set contained Deeds of Distribution which transferred \r\n  the estate's property to the parties in equal shares pursuant to Mrs. Shecut's \r\n  will. The second set partitioned the parties' interests in the property according \r\n  to the Agreement. Dickson testified he believed such a two-step process was \r\n  necessary to establish a chain-of-title from the estate to the parties. On December \r\n  29, 1994, Win and Bo executed the Deeds of Distribution in their capacity as \r\n  personal representatives of their mother's estate and recorded them in the RMC \r\n  office for Orangeburg County. At the same time, Bo and Win signed the appropriate \r\n  partitioning deeds in their individual capacities to fulfill their obligations \r\n  under the Agreement. Dickson mailed Anne the partitioning deeds and scheduled \r\n  a closing for March 16, 1995, to complete the second step of the process. At \r\n  the closing, Bo planned to reimburse his siblings for the estate tax related \r\n  to his residence by obtaining a loan from Edisto Farm Credit. The partitioning \r\n  deeds would be finalized at the closing. In a series of letters dated between \r\n  December 31, 1994 and March 27, 1995, Anne refused to sign the partitioning \r\n  deeds unless she received an accounting for income produced by estate assets. \r\n  She particularly objected to Bo's management of their joint properties and his \r\n  failure to account for the activities of Shecut Investments. \r\n   \r\nAnne brought this action on August \r\n  4, 1995. On the same day, she filed a lis pendens on all of the estate properties, \r\n  including Bo's house and the property Win received under the Agreement. Anne \r\n  also filed an accounting action in the Orangeburg probate court. Win counterclaimed \r\n  for breach of contract.  \r\nThe Master-in-Equity determined the \r\n  success or failure of Anne's partition action turned upon the validity of the \r\n  Agreement. After a four day hearing in May of 1997, the master found the Agreement \r\n  valid and ordered its specific performance. The master also granted Win's counterclaim \r\n  for breach of contract, finding Anne breached the Agreement by filing the lis \r\n  pendens which prevented Win from receiving the full benefit of properties allotted \r\n  him by the Agreement. Specifically, the master found Win had suffered \"consequential \r\n  actual damages\" in the amount of $30,377 because the lis pendens prevented him \r\n  from receiving a crop subsidy on his farm and also prevented him from selling \r\n  timber from that land at an above-market price. Additionally, Win incurred the \r\n  expense of storing Anne's furniture. The master also ordered Anne to pay Win's \r\n  attorney fees but declined to sanction her under the South Carolina Frivolous \r\n  Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. Anne immediately appealed this order, but this \r\n  Court held the appeal in abeyance until the master could rule on the remaining \r\n  issues.   \r\nThe master conducted a second hearing \r\n  on November 12, 1997 to partition the joint properties of Anne and Bo and to \r\n  consider an accounting for income generated from the joint properties. By order \r\n  dated February 17, 1998, the master allotted the commercial property in Orangeburg \r\n  and the property in Branchville to Anne. He allotted the Norway property, the \r\n  remaining portion of the Cope property, a lot in Country Oaks Subdivision and \r\n  the Calhoun Construction mortgage to Bo. He also allotted Bo $58,000 from the \r\n  sale of the beach house to make up for the difference in the in-kind distribution.\r\nThe master conducted an accounting \r\n  of the activities of Shecut Investments. He found Bo had settled with Anne for \r\n  all of Shecut Investment's cash receipts through December, 1994, with a cashier's \r\n  check for $4,750. He ordered Bo to pay Anne $3,837.13 for rents owed to her. \r\n  He also ordered rents collected by Ms. Gunter on behalf of Anne and Bo be divided \r\n  equally after Anne was reimbursed for her half of the rent she collected and \r\n  deposited with Ms. Gunter. The master found that prior to May 17, 1997, both \r\n  parties had access to the beach house as tenants-in-common. He found that Anne \r\n  had vandalized the beach house after the first hearing, thereby justifying Bo's \r\n  decision to change the locks to protect the property from Anne. In addition, \r\n  the master found the beach house produced little or no income so Anne and Bo \r\n  did not owe each other rent.  \r\n   \r\nThe master held Bo had missed a favorable \r\n  business opportunity due to the lis pendens being filed against his house. He \r\n  also concluded that a resulting or constructive trust was created between Mrs. \r\n  Shecut and Bo in regards to the house. He held Bo sustained \"consequential actual \r\n  damages\" in the sum of $30,000. He declined to award Bo damages for slander \r\n  of title, finding such an award would result in double recovery. The master \r\n  ordered a judicial sale of the beach house with a minimum bid of $400,000. He \r\n  awarded Win $23,699.37 in attorney fees to be paid from Anne's net proceeds \r\n  of the sale. The master awarded Bo $25,423.11 in attorney fees from the proceeds \r\n  of the sale. The master reduced the amount of fees requested by Anne and awarded \r\n  her attorney $45,786.79 to be paid from the net proceeds of the sale. Bo and \r\n  Anne were to equally divide the remaining proceeds. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n   \r\nStandard \r\n  of Review  \r\nAn action for specific performance \r\n  lies in equity. Collier v. Green, 244 S.C. 367, 137 S.E.2d 277 (1964). \r\n  Additionally, partition actions and accountings are also equitable in nature. \r\n  Wilson v. McGuire, 320 S.C. 137, 463 S.E.2d 614 (Ct. App. 1995). When \r\n  reviewing an equitable action, this Court may find facts in accordance with \r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Townes Assocs. v. City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). This broad scope of review \r\n  does not mandate that we disregard the findings of the master who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility. Tiger, \r\n  Inc. v. Fisher Argo, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d 538 (1989). Actions \r\n  for breach of contract are legal. Shaw v. Atlantic Coast Life Ins. Co., \r\n  322 S.C. 139, 470 S.E.2d 382 (Ct. App. 1996). When legal and equitable causes \r\n  of action are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal \r\n  or equitable. Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d \r\n  45 (1996).  \r\nAlthough Anne couches the majority \r\n  of her arguments as errors of the master in ordering specific performance of \r\n  the private Agreement, the gravamen of this appeal concerns the validity of \r\n  the Agreement. We therefore separate Anne's arguments into those which challenge \r\n  the Agreement's validity and those which challenge the propriety of ordering \r\n  its specific performance.  \r\n\r\n  Validity of the April \r\n    6th Agreement\r\n  \r\n\r\nA. Abandonment of Agreement \r\n   \r\nAnne argues Bo and Win either breached \r\n  or abandoned the Agreement by executing the Deeds of Distribution because the \r\n  deeds made no mention of the Agreement. Alternatively, Anne argues the deeds \r\n  are conclusive evidence that the siblings hold the entire estate as tenants-in-common \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§62-3-908 (Supp. 1997) which states, in pertinent \r\n  part, that \"a deed of distribution from a personal representative is conclusive \r\n  evidence that the distributee has succeeded to the interest of the Estate in \r\n  the distributed assets . . . .\" The master held the execution of the deeds was \r\n  a \"ministerial act\" to effectuate the Agreement. We agree with the master's \r\n  interpretation.  \r\nA party to a contract breaches it \r\n  by \"fail[ing] to carry out [a] term, promise, or condition of the contract.\" \r\n  Blacks Law Dictionary 130 (6th ed. abr. 1995); see also Freeman \r\n  Dodge, Inc. v. MCC Fin. Servs, Inc. 272 S.C. 164, 249 S.E.2d 897 (1978). \r\n  Here, Bo and Win, acting in their capacity as personal representatives, executed \r\n  the Deeds of Distribution upon the advice of Dickson as the first step in a \r\n  two-step process to implement the Agreement. Dickson testified he believed such \r\n  a process was necessary to ensure a clear chain-of-title from the estate to \r\n  the siblings. In the first step, the personal representatives would pass title \r\n  to the heirs through the Deeds of Distribution. Next, the heirs would divide \r\n  their interests among each other with the partitioning deeds. Although we express \r\n  no opinion as to whether such a process is necessary for a proper chain-of-title \r\n  under similar circumstances, the actions of Bo and Win were not intended to \r\n  and do not constitute a breach of the Agreement.  \r\n   \r\n A party to a contract abandons it \r\n  by undertaking a positive and unequivocal act which is inconsistent with the \r\n  existence of the contract. Ro-Lo Enters. v. Hicks Enters., 294 S.C. 111, \r\n  362 S.E.2d 888 (Ct. App. 1987). \"The abandonment of a contract is a matter of \r\n  intention to be ascertained from the facts and circumstances surrounding the \r\n  transaction from which the abandonment is claimed to have resulted.\" Quality \r\n  Concrete Prods., Inc. v. Thomason, 253 S.C. 579, 589, 172 S.E.2d 297, 302 \r\n  (1970). Bo and Win both testified they executed the deeds to effectuate, not \r\n  abandon, the Agreement. Similarly, Dickson testified he was retained to transfer \r\n  the real estate to the siblings in accordance with the Agreement. Such actions \r\n  do not constitute an abandonment of the Agreement. \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Merger By Deed \r\n     \r\n\r\nAnne argues the Agreement merged \r\n  into the Deeds of Distribution thereby extinguishing the Agreement pursuant \r\n  to the doctrine of merger by deed. This argument is not preserved for appeal \r\n  as the master refused to allow Anne to raise the issue of merger at trial and \r\n  Anne failed to challenge his ruling by an appropriate post-trial motion. It \r\n  is axiomatic that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court \r\n  before the issue is preserved for appellate review. Medical Soc'y of South \r\n  Carolina v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 334 S.C. 270, 513 S.E.2d 352 \r\n  (1999); McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 511 S.E.2d 365 (1999).  \r\n   \r\nAnne concedes the master rejected \r\n  her attempt to amend her complaint to add a merger claim, but argues the issue \r\n  is preserved because the master allowed the issue to be argued at a summary \r\n  judgment hearing and ruled on the issue in his July 10, 1997 order by declaring \r\n  it was \"not [a] meritorious defense. . . .\" Read in context, the master's comment \r\n  is merely a justification of his denial of Anne's summary judgment motion rather \r\n  than a specific ruling on the merger issue. However, even if we viewed the comment \r\n  as a ruling, it would directly conflict with the master's clear ruling in the \r\n  same order that the issue was not properly raised. When an order is internally \r\n  inconsistent, that inconsistency must be raised to the trial court by way of \r\n  a post-trial motion before it is preserved for appellate review. Grant v. \r\n  South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995); Revis \r\n  v. Barrett, 321 S.C. 206, 467 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 1996). Accordingly, the \r\n  issue of merger by deed is not before this Court.  \r\n   \r\nIn any event, Anne's merger claim \r\n  is without merit. The \"conclusive evidence\" provision of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-908 \r\n  (Supp. 1999) is only applicable to parties who are claiming an interest in an \r\n  estate asset from the personal representative, not to competent successors who \r\n  enter into a contract pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-912 (Supp. 1999) to \r\n  alter that which they are entitled to from an estate. Moreover, it is clear \r\n  that the parties did not intend a merger. See Hughes v. Greenville \r\n  Country Club, 283 S.C. 448, 322 S.E.2d 827 (Ct. App. 1984) (recognizing \r\n  the contrary intent exception to the merger doctrine). \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Repudiation of the Agreement\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnne argues Win repudiated \r\n  the Agreement and failed to withdraw the repudiation by executing the Addendum \r\n  in a timely manner.(3) We disagree. \r\n  \r\n\r\nA nonbreaching party may repudiate \r\n  a contract in response to a breach which is \"so fundamental and substantial \r\n  as to defeat the purpose of the contract.\" Ackerman v. McMillan, 314 \r\n  S.C. 268, 271, 442 S.E.2d 618, 620 (Ct. App. 1994). However, the party who repudiated \r\n  the contract may withdraw the repudiation at anytime before his performance \r\n  is due provided the other party has neither acknowledged the repudiation nor \r\n  acted in reliance upon it. 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§704 (1991).  \r\n   \r\nWin became dissatisfied with the \r\n  Agreement after it was executed because it excluded three pieces of farming \r\n  equipment he believed the parties agreed he would own. He informed the estate's \r\n  attorney of his \"misgivings\" and that he \"almost immediately regretted signing \r\n  the document\" because of the excluded equipment. Anne responded to Win's misgivings \r\n  in a letter dated June 20, 1993, by acknowledging the siblings had agreed the \r\n  equipment would go to Win and offering to sign an addendum to rectify the omission. \r\n  Eventually, each party signed the addendum which reaffirmed the Agreement. Although \r\n  Win was dissatisfied with the omission, he continued to honor the Agreement's \r\n  property division as did the other parties. Accordingly, Win's repudiation of \r\n  the Agreement, if any, was withdrawn before any prejudice resulted. \r\n   \r\nII. Specific Performance \r\n  of the Agreement  \r\n   \r\nA. Fraudulent Inducement \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master erred in granting \r\n  specific performance of the Agreement because Bo and Win fraudulently induced \r\n  her to sign the Agreement. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nThe proponent of a claim of fraud \r\n  in the inducement to enter into a contract must demonstrate: (1) a representation, \r\n  (2) its falsity, (3) its materiality, (4) knowledge of its falsity or reckless \r\n  disregard of its truth or falsity, (5) intent that the representation be acted \r\n  upon, (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity, (7) the hearer's reliance on \r\n  its truth, (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon, and (9) the hearer's consequent \r\n  and proximate injury. M.B. Kahn Const. Co. v. South Carolina Nat. Bank of \r\n  Charleston, 275 S.C. 381, 271 S.E.2d 414 (1980); Sorin Equip. Co. v. \r\n  The Firm, Inc., 323 S.C. 359, 474 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1996). The failure \r\n  to prove any one of these elements is fatal to the claim. Sorin, 323 \r\n  S.C. 359, 474 S.E.2d 819. Generally, the representation must relate to a present \r\n  or pre-existing fact rather than a statement of future events or an unfulfilled \r\n  promise. Woodward v. Todd, 270 S.C. 82, 240 S.E.2d 641 (1978). An exception \r\n  to the general rule is recognized for unfulfilled promises which were made by \r\n  a party who never intended to fulfill the promise and only made it to induce \r\n  the performance of another party. Davis v. Upton, 250 S.C. 288, 157 S.E.2d \r\n  567 (1967); Winburn v. Insurance Co. of North America, 287 S.C. 435, \r\n  339 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App. 1985). \r\n   \r\nWhile acting as personal representatives \r\n  of Mrs. Shecut's estate, Bo and Win made two loans from the estate funds. The \r\n  first loan, for $20,000, was made sometime in February of 1993 to Win for agricultural \r\n  expenses. Win shortly repaid the loan with interest. Around the same time, the \r\n  brothers made a second loan of $5,000 to a family friend, Fletcher Riley. Mr. \r\n  Riley did not fully repay the loan, but Bo and Win reimbursed the estate for \r\n  the shortfall by relinquishing their personal representative fee. However, no \r\n  interest was ever collected on the Riley loan.(4) \r\n  Upon discovering the loans, the estate's attorney recommended against future \r\n  loans although she did not believe such loans were prohibited by Mrs. Shecut's \r\n  will. Bo and Win complied with the attorney's advice. Anne entered into the \r\n  Agreement after learning of the loans.  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Anne fails to enumerate \r\n  or argue the elements of fraudulent inducement, but merely raises it as an issue. \r\n  By failing to argue the merits of fraudulent inducement, Anne has lost her right \r\n  to raise the issue on appeal. See Rule 209(D), SCACR (requiring an appellant \r\n  to set forth an issue in its brief then discuss it with citations to authority); \r\n  State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d 324 (1998) (holding a conclusory \r\n  argument is insufficient to present an issue on appeal). In any event, there \r\n  is no merit to Anne's claim that she would not have entered into the Agreement \r\n  had she known of the loans because the record reveals she did know of them when \r\n  she entered into the agreement. \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, Anne attempts to prove \r\n  her fraudulent inducement claim by arguing Bo and Win violated their fiduciary \r\n  duties as personal representatives by making loans and failing to collect rents \r\n  due the estate before execution of the Agreement.(5) \r\n  Anne contends these breaches of fiduciary duty fraudulently induced her to join \r\n  the Agreement. A personal representative is a fiduciary and as such must act \r\n  in accordance with the standard of care of a trustee set forth in S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 62-7-302 and 62-3-703 (Supp. 1998). Where there is a duty to speak, \r\n  a fiduciary's non-disclosure may be fraudulent. Cf. Manning v. Dial, \r\n  271 S.C. 79, 245 S.E.2d 120 (1978). However, as discussed above, the loans were \r\n  disclosed to Anne and therefore could not amount to fraud. Accordingly, we find \r\n  no fraud in the inducement.  \r\n   \r\nB. Satisfaction of Conditions \r\n  Precedent  \r\nAnne argues the master erred in granting \r\n  specific performance of the Agreement without also requiring Bo and Win to fulfill \r\n  certain conditions precedent. Specifically, Anne maintains that the collection \r\n  of all loans and rents due the estate as well as the distribution of all remaining \r\n  personal property to the siblings are conditions precedent to her obligation \r\n  to perform under the Agreement. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nA condition precedent is \"any fact \r\n  . . . which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate \r\n  performance arises.\" Worley v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, \r\n  452 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App. 1994). The existence of a condition precedent \r\n  in a contract is a \"question of construction dependent on the intent of the \r\n  parties to be gathered from the language they employ.\" Id. (quoting \r\n  Ballenger Corp. v. City of Columbia, 286 S.C. 1, 5, 331 S.E.2d 365, 368 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1985)). Under certain circumstances, a court may imply a condition \r\n  precedent to an agreement, but one \"may not be implied when it might have been \r\n  provided for by the express agreement.\" Id. at 210, 452 S.E.2d at 625 \r\n  (quoting 17A C.J.S. Contracts Â§338 (1963)).  \r\n   \r\nThe Agreement did not establish any \r\n  conditions precedent, but provided that \"[a]ny other property remaining in the \r\n  estate after the payment of creditors, administrative expenses, and debts shall \r\n  be distributed\" in equal shares to the siblings. The payment of an estate's \r\n  debts, creditors and expenses necessarily comes at the end of probate so it \r\n  is clear the parties did not intend for the division of the remaining estate \r\n  assets to be a condition precedent of the Agreement. Furthermore, Anne knew \r\n  the estate contained rent-generating property. In fact, she and Bo craved that \r\n  property and negotiated for it in the Agreement so they could manage it as a \r\n  business. To that end, they formed and operated Shecut Investments. Had Anne \r\n  intended a full accounting to precede the execution of the Agreement, she could \r\n  have insisted on such a provision being included in the Agreement. Anne cannot \r\n  now ask this Court to impose a condition on appeal which was not included in \r\n  the original agreement. Worley, 317 S.C. 206, 452 S.E.2d 622. \r\n   \r\nWith the exception of the loans made \r\n  by the personal representatives, the conditions precedent advocated by Anne \r\n  were easily within the contemplation of the parties when they executed the Agreement \r\n  and could have been included in it. Therefore, we will not imply them now. Id. \r\n  As for the loans made by the personal representatives, they were both repaid \r\n  before the master ordered specific performance so Anne's contention that their \r\n  repayment was a condition precedent is moot.  \r\n   \r\nEven if we were to imply the conditions \r\n  advocated by Anne, these conditions were either satisfied before Bo and Win \r\n  attempted to execute the Agreement or are invalid. First, Anne speculates her \r\n  mother loaned her brothers money which must be repaid to the estate before the \r\n  Agreement may be performed. However, Anne testified Mrs. Shecut did not require \r\n  \"loans\" to her children be repaid. In fact, Anne admitted she was the beneficiary \r\n  of her mother's largess with a $14,000 loan which Anne did not have to repay. \r\n  Next, Anne argues that all of the estate's personal property must be distributed \r\n  before the Agreement can be performed, but the record suggests a full distribution \r\n  occurred long before the master's order. The record does not support Anne's \r\n  allegations of undistributed personal property including a \"large and valuable \r\n  coin collection\", an \"enormous gun\" collection, a \"room full of silver,\" and \r\n  \"fishing tackle in the beach house.\"  \r\n   \r\nThe last condition precedent advocated \r\n  by Anne, an accounting of rents generated by the estate prior to the execution \r\n  of the Agreement, was rejected by the master because an \"accounting for pre-[Agreement] \r\n  rents [should] be heard by the Orangeburg County Probate Court.\" The master \r\n  correctly refrained from conducting such an accounting because it falls within \r\n  the jurisdiction of the probate court. The probate court has exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  over the administration of an estate. S.C. Code Ann. Â§62-1-302 (Supp. 1999). \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error. \r\n   \r\nC. Unclean Hands and \r\n  Laches  \r\nAnne argues the master erred in granting \r\n  specific performance of the Agreement due to the doctrines of unclean hands \r\n  and laches. Neither argument is properly before this Court.  \r\n   \r\nThe doctrine of unclean hands was \r\n  enumerated in the caption of her argument, but not specifically argued in her \r\n  brief. An issue which is raised, but not argued in the appellant's brief is \r\n  deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal. Taylor v. Medenica, \r\n  331 S.C. 575, 503 S.E.2d 458 (1998). Accordingly, the issue is abandoned. \r\n   \r\nIn any event, Anne's assertion of \r\n  the doctrine of unclean hands is without merit. A defendant seeking the protection \r\n  of the doctrine of unclean hands must demonstrate that the plaintiff \"acted \r\n  unfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation to the prejudice \r\n  of the defendant.\" Wilson v. Landstrom, 281 S.C. 260, 266, 315 S.E.2d \r\n  130, 134 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Arnold v. City of Spartanburg, 201 S.C. \r\n  523, 23 S.E.2d 735 (1943)). Here, Anne has failed to demonstrate she was prejudiced \r\n  by the actions of her brothers. The loans she complains of have been repaid; \r\n  an accounting of all post-Agreement rents from estate assets has occurred; and \r\n  a pre-Agreement accounting will be conducted by the probate court. Moreover, \r\n  any problem associated with the delay in closing Mrs. Shecut's estate is of \r\n  Anne's own making since she filed the litigation which has needlessly delayed \r\n  that closing. A defendant may not raise delay of performance as a defense where \r\n  the defendant is responsible for the delay. Shannon v. Freeman, 117 S.C. \r\n  480, 109 S.E. 406 (1921).  \r\n   \r\nAnne moved to amend her reply to \r\n  Win's counterclaim to raise the doctrine of laches. The master denied the motion \r\n  as untimely. Anne never renewed the motion. Therefore, this argument is not \r\n  preserved for appeal. It is axiomatic that an issue must be raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court before the issue is preserved for appellate review. \r\n  Medical Soc'y of South Carolina, 334 S.C. 270, 543 S.E.2d 352; McDavid \r\n  v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 511 S.E.2d 365 (1999). The aforementioned rule \r\n  applies with equal force to actions before masters-in-equity. Life of Georgia \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Bolton, 333 S.C. 406, 509 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998); Global \r\n  Protection Corp. v. Halbersberg, 332 S.C. 149, 503 S.E.2d 483 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998). Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for appeal.  \r\n   \r\nIn any event, Anne's claim of laches \r\n  is without merit. A party seeking the protection of the doctrine of laches must \r\n  prove the proponent of an action unreasonably delayed instituting the action \r\n  and that such a delay is unexplainable and negligent in light of what should \r\n  have been done. Lindler v. Adcock, 250 S.C. 383, 158 S.E.2d 192 (1967). \r\n  Here, Anne has failed to prove her brothers unreasonably delayed seeking the \r\n  performance of the Agreement. After the dispute over the omitted farm equipment \r\n  was resolved, the parties arranged for the preparation of the necessary documents \r\n  to effectuate the Agreement. Those documents were ready in December of 1994 \r\n  and a closing was scheduled for March of 1995. This time frame is reasonable \r\n  given the complexity of the estate as well as the relationship and geographic \r\n  dispersion of the parties. Accordingly, the issue is without merit.  \r\n   \r\nD. Jurisdiction Over \r\n  Bo's Residence \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to determine whether the estate held Bo's residence in an implied trust.(6) \r\n  We agree.   \r\nThe probate court has exclusive original \r\n  jurisdiction over all matters related to estates, including trusts, under most \r\n  circumstances. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302 (Supp. 1999). However, a party to a \r\n  probate action may remove an action concerning a trust to the circuit court \r\n  by filing a motion with the probate court \"not later than ten days following \r\n  the date on which all responsive pleading must be filed . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§62-1-302(c)(4) (Supp. 1999). Here, there is no indication in the record that \r\n  such a motion was made, so the master's conclusion \"that a resulting trust or \r\n  constructive trust was created between\" Mrs. Shecut and Bo was an error. \r\n   \r\n Although the master erred in deciding \r\n  whether the estate held Bo's residence in an implied trust, the error does not \r\n  impact the validity of the Agreement. Bo transferred title to the contested \r\n  property to his mother for safekeeping because he was having drug and marital \r\n  problems. Mrs. Shecut gave no consideration for the title and Bo continued to \r\n  live on the property and pay its mortgage, taxes and insurance premiums. The \r\n  Agreement gave the property to Bo, but required him to repay Anne and Win for \r\n  any estate taxes they incurred due to the property being in the estate. The \r\n  master effectuated the Agreement by giving the property to Bo and holding him \r\n  accountable for the taxes. His ruling concerning an implied trust merely reflected \r\n  the conclusion reached by the parties in the Agreement.(7) \r\n  Accordingly, the master's decision is affirmed. \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Description of Cope \r\n    Property\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne argues the master erred \r\nin ordering the specific performance of the Agreement because it lacked an adequate \r\nlegal description of the division of the Cope property as required by the statute \r\nof frauds and other equitable principles. We disagree. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Agreement divided the Cope property \r\n  into two segments: one for Win (Win's Portion) and the other for Anne and Bo \r\n  jointly (Joint Portion). Additionally, the Agreement specified that a pond located \r\n  on the Cope Property would be maintained for the \"mutual use and enjoyment of \r\n  all parties of this [A]greement.\" The division was memorialized with a hand-drawn \r\n  line on an aerial photograph of the property which was attached to the Agreement. \r\n  The parties decided to have the property surveyed to officially delineate each \r\n  portion. Bo and Win arranged for Donald J. Smith, Jr. to prepare the survey. \r\n  Smith testified he surveyed the Cope property based on the oral statements of \r\n  Win and an aerial photograph of the property provided by Win. However, the photograph \r\n  provided by Win was not the same photograph that was attached to the Agreement. \r\n  Because Smith did not prepare his survey from the photograph attached to the \r\n  Agreement, the master excluded Smith's survey. When partitioning the joint property \r\n  of Anne and Bo, the master awarded the Joint Portion to Bo. The master indicated \r\n  that if Bo and Win could not mutually agree to a division of the Cope property, \r\n  Bo would have to pay for another survey of the property using the photograph \r\n  attached to the Agreement.(8) \r\n   \r\nAnne contends the division of the \r\n  Cope property by the aerial photograph violates the statute of frauds; however, \r\n  she did not properly raise this contention to the master. Affirmative defenses, \r\n  such as the statute of frauds, must be set forth in a responsive pleading. Rule \r\n  8(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 \r\n  (1997); American Wholesale Corp. v. Mauldin, 128 S.C. 241, 122 S.E. 576 \r\n  (1924); cf. Resolution Trust Corp. v. Eagle Lake and Golf Condominiums, \r\n  310 S.C. 473, 427 S.E.2d 646 (1993) (expressing the court's distaste for raising \r\n  unpled issues orally at a summary judgment hearing). Here, Anne failed to raise \r\n  the statute of frauds as a defense in any of her pleadings. Even if she had \r\n  properly raised the defense, it is without merit because Anne waived the protection \r\n  of the statute of frauds by using the aerial photograph to divide the Cope property \r\n  when she entered into the Agreement and acted in reliance upon that division \r\n  after the Agreement was in place. \"[T]he protection afforded by the statute \r\n  [of frauds] is a personal privilege of the parties to the agreement, and may \r\n  be waived by them . . . .\" Walker v. Preacher, 188 S.C. 431, 436, 199 \r\n  S.E. 675, 677 (1938); see also Cooper v. A.A.A. Highway Exp., Inc., \r\n206 S.C. 372, 34 S.E.2d 589 (1945).    \r\nNevertheless, we are concerned that \r\n  the division ordered by the master deprives Anne of her agreed interest in the \r\n  pond which is located on this property and whose value does not appear to have \r\n  been considered by the master. We therefore remand to the trial court for a \r\n  determination of this issue. \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Bo's Financial Status\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnne argues the master erred in ordering \r\n  the specific performance of the Agreement because Bo was financially unable \r\n  to perform his obligations under the Agreement. This argument is not preserved \r\n  for appellate review as it was not ruled on by the trial court. SSI Medical \r\n  Services, Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990). In any event, \r\n  the issue is without merit because Bo's only financial obligation under the \r\n  Agreement was to reimburse Anne and Win \"for any estate tax which was caused \r\n  by the inclusion of [Bo's Residence] in the estate . . . .\" Bo arranged to fulfill \r\n  that obligation with a loan from Edisto Farm Credit and stood ready to tender \r\n  the necessary funds at the closing which never occurred due to Anne's refusal \r\n  to fulfill her obligations. \r\n   \r\nIII. Contract Damages \r\n   \r\nA breach of contract action seeking \r\n  money damages is an action at law. Moore v. Crowley &amp; Assoc., Inc., \r\n  254 S.C. 170, 174 S.E.2d 340 (1970). \"In an action at law, on appeal of a case \r\n  tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the [trial] judge will not be \r\n  disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the judge's findings.\" Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 \r\n  S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\n   \r\nA. Lost Profits from \r\n  Timber Sales \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master erred in ordering \r\n  her to pay $30,377 in damages to Win for her breach of the Agreement. We agree \r\n  the master erred in awarding damages for the profits lost in timber sales. \r\n   \r\n\"Damages recoverable for breach of \r\n  contract either must flow as a natural consequence of the breach or must have \r\n  been reasonably within the parties' contemplation at the time of the contract.\" \r\n  Manning v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 455, 377 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1989) \r\n  (citing Kline Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Superior Trucking Co., 261 S.C. \r\n  542, 201 S.E.2d 388 (1973)). Damages arising from unusual circumstances are \r\n  considered within the reasonable contemplation of the parties where \"the defendant \r\n  was clearly warned of the probable existence of unusual circumstances or . . \r\n  . had 'reason to foresee the probable existence of such circumstances.'\" Stern \r\n  &amp; Stern Assocs. v. Timmons, 310 S.C. 250, 251, 423 S.E.2d 124, 125 (1992) \r\n  (quoting 5 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Â§1011 (1964)).  \r\n   \r\nHere, the record contains evidence \r\n  to support the master's damage awards except as to the timber sales. The parties \r\n  entered into the Agreement to divide the estate's income producing assets. Win, \r\n  a farmer, received most of the estate's farmland and equipment. Anne and Bo \r\n  received most of the estate's commercial property and the beach house. After \r\n  executing the Agreement, each party treated their allotted properties and their \r\n  associated income as their own. Anne and Bo soon began to bicker over the income \r\n  from their joint properties. Anne breached the Agreement shortly before a closing \r\n  which would have finalized it. Then, she deliberately deprived Win of the income \r\n  generated by crop subsidies from the property allotted him by the Agreement. \r\n  Although her primary motivation for breaching the Agreement was her dissatisfaction \r\n  with Bo, Anne involved Win in the action also. \r\n   \r\nAs for Win's inability to sell timber \r\n  from the land allocated to him under the Agreement, it is clear that the lis \r\n  pendens would have prevented Win from selling or mortgaging his equitable interest \r\n  in the properties. However, it is not clear that under South Carolina law the \r\n  lis pendens prevented Win from harvesting the timber and selling it provided \r\n  he properly accounted for the proceeds.(9) See \r\n  Tedder v. Tedder, 123 S.C. 346, 116 S.E. 436 (1923) (In a partition proceeding, \r\n  the filing of a lis pendens does not create a lien against rents on the profits \r\n  of a cotenant's share.). Moreover, there is no indication that Win made any \r\n  effort to seek an agreement with his siblings to cut the timber and place some \r\n  portion of the income therefrom in escrow. Under these facts, Win's damages \r\n  are too speculative to support the master's award. South Carolina Fin. Corp. \r\n  v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. 109, 113 S.E.2d 329 (1960) (Profits that \r\n  have been prevented or lost as a natural consequence of breach of contract are \r\n  recoverable as an item of damages, but to warrant recovery, lost profits must \r\n  be established with reasonable certainty and recovery cannot be had for profits \r\n  that are speculative.). We therefore reverse the master's award of $25,000 for \r\n  the loss of timber sales.  \r\nB. Win's Failure to Mitigate \r\n  Damages \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master erred in ordering \r\n  her to pay Win damages because Win failed to mitigate his damages by collecting \r\n  crop subsidies of properties allotted to him in the Agreement. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn injured party is required to do \r\n  that which an ordinary prudent person would do under similar circumstances to \r\n  mitigate his damages. Du Bose v. Bultman, 215 S.C. 468, 56 S.E.2d 95 \r\n  (1949); Genovese v. Bergeron, 327 S.C. 567, 490 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997); Chastain v. Owens Carolina, Inc., 310 S.C. 417, 426 S.E.2d 834 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1993). However, the injured party is not required to unreasonably \r\n  exert himself or incur substantial expense in an effort to mitigate damages. \r\n  Id. \r\n   \r\nAfter filing the lis pendens, Anne \r\n  contacted the Farm Service Bureau and had herself listed as a co-owner of certain \r\n  property allotted to Win by the Agreement. The owner of that property was eligible \r\n  for crop subsidies from the Bureau. Anne demanded Win pay her one/third of the \r\n  subsidy or else she would refuse to sign the necessary documents and the subsidy \r\n  would be lost. Win complied, but when he forwarded the documents to Anne, she \r\n  increased her demand to two/thirds of the subsidy. Ultimately, Win did not complete \r\n  the transaction because only farmers could receive the subsidy and Anne was \r\n  not a farmer. Anne contends Win should have somehow collected the subsidies \r\n  and placed them in escrow until her litigation was resolved. Her contention \r\n  exceeds that which is necessary to mitigate damages. Accordingly, the master \r\n  did not err in finding Win had not failed to mitigate his damages. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. Master's Jurisdiction \r\n  Over the Second Hearing \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to conduct the second hearing to determine Bo's contract \r\n  damages because the order from the first hearing had been appealed. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter the first hearing of the bifurcated \r\n  proceeding, the master entered an order which found the Agreement to be valid \r\n  and ordered its specific performance. The order also disposed of all issues \r\n  concerning Win and dismissed him from the litigation. Anne appealed this first \r\n  order. This Court, by order dated December 12, 1997, determined that \"the appealed \r\n  [first] order ends the dispute over some of the property . . . [and] affects \r\n  a substantial right involving the merits . . . therefore, [it is] immediately \r\n  appealable.\" However, \"[i]n light of the pending [second hearing] and likelihood \r\n  of a future appeal . . . the parties' interests will best be served by holding \r\n  the current appeal in abeyance until the master enters his [second] order . \r\n  . . .\" Accordingly, the second hearing was held and this appeal of both orders \r\n  followed. We find no error in this procedure as a consolidated appeal of both \r\n  orders served the interests of judicial economy without prejudicing any of the \r\n  parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nD. Bo's Lost Business \r\n  Opportunity \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master erred in awarding \r\n  Bo $30,000 for a lost business opportunity. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn injured party may recover lost \r\n  profits for a failed new business or enterprise if the lost profits are: (1) \r\n  the natural consequence of the breach, (2) foreseeable by the breaching party, \r\n  and (3) determinable with reasonable certainty. Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe \r\n  Assocs., 296 S.C. 207, 371 S.E.2d 532 (1988); Beck v. Clarkson, 300 \r\n  S.C. 293, 387 S.E.2d 681 (Ct. App. 1989). The evidence in the record fails to \r\n  satisfy the necessary elements for this cause of action. First, there is little \r\n  evidence that Bo lost a business opportunity as the natural consequence of the \r\n  breach. Secondly, there is no evidence that Anne knew Bo was pursuing a business \r\n  opportunity or that her breach of the Agreement would cause him to lose that \r\n  opportunity. Finally, the value of the lost opportunity cannot be ascertained \r\n  with reasonable certainty from the evidence presented to the master.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBo testified he sought an equity \r\n  line of credit of \"at least\" $30,000 on his residence so that he could become \r\n  an investor in an existing appliance business in Denmark, South Carolina. The \r\n  lis pendens Anne filed against Bo's residence prevented him from receiving the \r\n  credit line so he missed this opportunity to invest. However, the record is \r\n  silent as to the exact cost of Bo's investment or its projected return other \r\n  than Bo's tentative $30,000 estimate. Bo did testify his investment would entitle \r\n  him to a job at the store, but admitted no salary had been agreed upon. Additionally, \r\n  Bo testified he consulted an accounting firm about the investment, but there \r\n  is no evidence in the record as to the result of that consultation other than \r\n  Bo's own inconclusive testimony. Such evidence does not rise to the level of \r\n  \"reasonable certainty\" as required by Drews. Accordingly, the master's \r\n  award of $30,000 is reversed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. Attorneys' Fees \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a partition action, the trial \r\n  court may assess attorney fees against any or all the parties-in-interest as \r\n  equity demands. S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-61-110 (1976). The amount of the award is \r\n  within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. Briggs v. Jackson, 275 S.C. \r\n  523, 273 S.E.2d 532 (1981); S &amp; W Corp. v. Wells, 283 S.C. 218, 321 \r\n  S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 1984).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master abused his \r\n  discretion by ordering her to pay Win's and Bo's attorney fees because she had \r\n  a legitimate reason for bringing the partition action. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe master held that Anne abused \r\n  the partition process and failed to effect the partition she sought. The record \r\n  adequately supports the master's conclusion. Shortly after the formation of \r\n  Shecut Investments, Anne and Bo began to quarrel over its operation. Anne then \r\n  attempted to involve Win in these disputes and when he refused, she breached \r\n  the Agreement and placed a lis pendens on property allotted solely to her brothers \r\n  by the Agreement. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the master's \r\n  award of attorney fees to Bo and Win.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne also argues the master erred \r\n  in not granting all of her attorney fees from the sale of the beach property. \r\n  This contention is not preserved for review. The appellant has the obligation \r\n  to provide this Court with a sufficient record to reach a decision. Medlock \r\n  v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee, 322 S.C. 127, 470 S.E.2d 373 (1996); State \r\n  v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 518 S.E.2d 278 (Ct. App. 1999). Anne has not produced \r\n  an itemization of her attorney fees and expenditures to enable us to determine \r\n  if the master's award is reasonable. Accordingly, the award of attorney fees \r\n  is affirmed.  \r\n   \r\nV. Accounting \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn accounting action lies in equity. \r\n  Wolf v. Hayes, 161 S.C. 293, 159 S.E. 620 (1931); Ackerman v. Heard, \r\n  287 S.C. 626, 340 S.E.2d 560 (Ct. App. 1986). Accordingly, we may find facts \r\n  in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Townes \r\n  Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). \r\n  However, we will not disregard the findings of the master who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility. Tiger, \r\n  Inc. v. Fisher Argo, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d 538 (1989). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Estate Income Accounting \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne argues the master erred in his \r\n  accounting because she did not receive a third of all income produced by the \r\n  estate. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nAnne's claim to a portion of the \r\n  income generated by the estate before the Agreement was executed is not properly \r\n  before this Court. The gravamen of this action involved the Agreement, so the \r\n  master properly limited the accounting to income generated after the Agreement \r\n  was executed. This limitation correctly acknowledged the jurisdiction of the \r\n  probate court over the administration of Mrs. Shecut's estate before the Agreement \r\n  was executed. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302 (Supp. 1999). Accordingly, \r\n  claims concerning pre-Agreement income must be raised to the probate court. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne's claim to income generated \r\n  by property allotted to Win by the Agreement is without merit. She relinquished \r\n  her claim to that property and its income in exchange for Win relinquishing \r\n  his rights to the joint properties of Anne and Bo. Accordingly, the master correctly \r\n  held Anne \"had no interest in the property\" allotted to Win by the Agreement \r\n  or the income it generated after the execution of the Agreement. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne's claim to half the income generated \r\n  by the joint property was adjudicated by the master. After an exhaustive accounting, \r\n  the master ordered Bo to pay Anne $3,787.13 to equalize her share of the income \r\n  generated by the joint property. Anne claims the master's award is inaccurate \r\n  as Bo has received $112,670 from the joint property, but she has received nothing. \r\n  This assertion is not supported by the record. Her calculation of the income \r\n  Bo allegedly received does not account for the expenses generated by that property \r\n  or the withdrawals made by both parties. The record also contains ample evidence \r\n  contradicting Anne's assertion that she has not received any income from the \r\n  joint properties. She and Bo both took draws from their partnership account \r\n  and split certain cash rental income. Additionally, Anne is entitled to a portion \r\n  of rental income which she and Bo decided should be deposited into the estate \r\n  attorney's escrow account after the operation of Shecut Investments ceased. \r\n  We affirm the master's accounting and award of $3,787.13 to Anne. See \r\n  Duckett v. Payne, 279 S.C. 94, 96, 302 S.E.2d 342, 343 (1983) (\"[T]he \r\n  appellant carries the burden of convincing this Court that the trial court erred.\"). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nB. Bo's Use and Enjoyment \r\n  of Joint Property \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnne claims Bo must pay her rent \r\n  for the use of their beach house and hog parlor. We disagree. As a joint-tenant, \r\n  Bo is entitled to the use and enjoyment of jointly owned properties.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the absence of a statute requiring \r\n  a different result, a cotenant who has enjoyed occupancy of the common premises \r\n  . . . is not liable to the others for rent, and is not accountable to them for \r\n  the reasonable value of his or her occupancy, where they have not been ousted \r\n  or excluded, nor their equal rights denied, and where no agreement to pay for \r\n  occupancy, or limiting or assigning rights of occupancy, have been made. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n20 Am. Jur.2d Cotenancy and Joint \r\n  Ownership Â§ 49 (1995). Anne offers no evidence of either ouster or exclusion. \r\n  Accordingly, Bo does not owe Anne anything for his use of the beach house and \r\n  hog parlor. See Duckett, 279 S.C. 94, 96, 302 S.E.2d 342, 343. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVI. Master's Bias and \r\n  Abuse of Discretion \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Anne argues the master's \r\n  orders were the result of deliberate bias and an abuse of discretion. Because \r\n  Anne never requested the master recuse himself, this issue is not preserved. \r\n  McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996) (issue \r\n  must have been raised to the trial court to be preserved for appellate review). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nEven if this issue was preserved, \r\n  it is without merit. The Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to \"disqualify \r\n  himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" \r\n  Canon 3(C)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR. A judge must \r\n  exercise sound judicial discretion in determining whether his impartiality might \r\n  reasonably be questioned. Christy v. Christy, 317 S.C. 145, 452 S.E.2d \r\n  1 (Ct. App. 1994). Absent evidence of judicial prejudice, a judge's failure \r\n  to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal. Ellis v. Procter &amp; \r\n  Gamble Dist. Co., 315 S.C. 283, 433 S.E.2d 856 (1993). It is not enough \r\n  for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege bias. The party must show \r\n  some evidence of bias. Christensen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 476 S.E.2d \r\n  692 (1996); Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 473 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996). Furthermore, the alleged bias must be personal, as distinguished from \r\n  judicial, in nature. Christiansen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 476 S.E.2d \r\n  692 (1996). Here, Anne argues the master's alleged legal errors in this case \r\n  resulted from his bias and animus against her. However, the record does not \r\n  contain any evidence of judicial prejudice or personal bias to support Anne's \r\n  contention.  \r\n   \r\nConclusion \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe master was correct in upholding \r\n  the private Agreement of the parties and ordering its specific performance. \r\n  As to Anne's claim for an accounting, the master's order properly disposes of \r\n  it. The master's award of lost timber profits to Win is not supported by the \r\n  record. Likewise, the master's award for a lost business opportunity to Bo is \r\n  unsupported by the evidence. We find support and affirm the award of attorney \r\n  fees by the master. Anne failed to raise the issue of bias of the master at \r\n  the trial level and we find no error in the master not recusing himself. However, \r\n  we hold that Anne's interest in the pond has not been protected by the master \r\n  and remand that issue for reconsideration. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, the orders of the master \r\n  are \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON and \r\n  HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  At the beginning \r\n  of the partnership, Bo collected all the rents generated by the joint property \r\n  and arranged for its upkeep and maintenance. He testified that he would not \r\n  deposit cash-rents into the partnership's bank account, as he did with noncash-rents, \r\n  but that he kept half of the cash for himself and paid the other half to Anne \r\n  when he next saw her. Anne claims she never received any money from Bo. At trial, \r\n  Bo admitted he still possessed some undistributed cash-rents for Anne. \r\n2.  Anne executed \r\n  the Addendum on August 4, 1993. Bo's signature on the Addendum is not dated. \r\n  Win's signature on the Addendum is dated \"the 27 day of _____, 1995.\" Ms. Gunter, \r\n  who witnessed Win's signature on the Addendum, could not positively state what \r\n  month Win signed the Addendum, but her records indicated he had visited her \r\n  office on January 27, 1995. \r\n3.  Anne also \r\n  attempts to characterize the Addendum as a novation, but a novation substitutes \r\n  a new obligation for an old one which is extinguished. Wayne Dalton Corp. \r\n  v. Acme Doors, Inc., 302 S.C. 93, 394 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App. 1990). Here, the \r\n  Addendum modified the Agreement; it did not extinguish it. \r\n4.  Whether or \r\n  not Bo and Win should pay the estate interest on this loan is a matter for the \r\n  Probate Court. In fact, the master precluded Anne's counsel from raising the \r\n  issue because the attempt was untimely. \r\n5.  The record \r\n  does not support the allegation that uncollected rents existed before the Agreement \r\n  was executed. \r\n6.  In the caption \r\n  to this argument, Anne raised the doctrine of secret trusts, but did not argue \r\n  it in the body of her brief. An issue raised on appeal, but not argued in the \r\n  brief is abandoned and will not be considered on appeal. Taylor, 331 \r\n  S.C. 575, 503 S.E.2d 458. Accordingly, the issue is abandoned. \r\n7.  Regardless \r\n  of the claim of a trust relationship, the parties were free to contract for \r\n  title to be awarded to Bo. \r\n8.  Smith testified \r\n  that an accurate survey could be prepared from the Agreement's aerial photograph. \r\n  \r\n9.  Additionally, \r\n  the master's findings are not supported by the evidence. Win testified that \r\n  Union Camp ran \"slap out\" of wood during the winter of 1994-95 and it was willing \r\n  to pay $80 per cord for pulpwood. At the time of the hearing, pulpwood brought \r\n  $55 per cord; therefore the master found Win lost a $25 per cord premium. Win \r\n  further testified that Anne's lis pendens, filed in August of 1995, prevented \r\n  him from taking advantage of the premium. However, there is nothing in the record \r\n  to suggest that the premium offered in the winter of 1994-95 was still available \r\n  the following summer; therefore, the master's conclusion concerning the premium \r\n  is not supported by the evidence. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3168","title":"Grillo v.

The circuit court granted summary judgment to \r\n  Columbia Marking Products, Inc., concluding the three year statute of limitations \r\n  barred Mark Grillo's causes of action for negligence per se, strict \r\n  liability, and negligent failure to warn.  Grillo appeals. \r\n  We reverse and remand.   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nMark Grillo was employed by the Kroger \r\n  Sav-On food store. As part of his duties, Grillo painted banners and signs for \r\n  the store one day a week. Kroger purchased Speedrite Instant Dry Ink from Columbia \r\n  Marking Products, Inc. (CMP), and beginning in February of 1992, Grillo used \r\n  the Speedrite Ink to paint the store banners. The ink bottle's label did not \r\n  list its contents. However, the label stated the ink should not be used near \r\n  open flames and should be used in \"well ventilated areas to avoid breathing \r\n  a heavy concentration of fumes.\" \r\n   \r\nIn his deposition, Grillo testified \r\n  he experienced symptoms of dizziness, headache, and euphoria when using the \r\n  Speedrite Ink.  The symptoms were temporary, usually lasting \r\n  the day he used the product, and often into the next day. He started to affirmatively \r\n  associate the symptoms with the product in May of 1992. Shortly thereafter, \r\n  Grillo asked store managers if the Speedrite Ink was safe and whether the store \r\n  had been given a Material Safety Data Sheet on it. The store did not have the \r\n  product safety information. \r\n   \r\nGrillo continued to periodically \r\n  use the Speedrite Ink until December 14, 1992. On that day, while using the \r\n  ink, he experienced more pronounced symptoms. Grillo described the symptoms \r\n  as \"stinging and cloudy eyes, ringing in my ears, flushed face, dizziness, feeling \r\n  faint, bodily tremors, not being able to stand up straight, [and] severe pounding \r\n  headache.\" Grillo advised the assistant store manager he would not use the ink \r\n  again. His symptoms did not subside after this occurrence, but persisted beyond \r\n  the next day.  \r\nOn December 19, 1992, Grillo visited \r\n  a doctor. He previously suffered from and was treated for an anxiety disorder \r\n  to which he partly attributed his extreme nervousness and headaches. However, \r\n  Grillo notified the doctor about the ink. He was advised to avoid the product \r\n  and excused from work for approximately two weeks. \r\n   \r\nWhile being examined on January 3, \r\n  1993, Grillo showed a bottle of the Speedrite Ink to a different doctor. According \r\n  to Grillo, this doctor telephoned a poison control office and requested that \r\n  the office contact Speedrite Products Inc., the manufacturer of the ink. Through \r\n  this method, Grillo first learned that the toxic substance toluene was an ingredient \r\n  in the Speedrite Ink. On April 1, 1993, Grillo was diagnosed \r\n  with acute transient narcosis secondary to toxic solvent exposure. \r\n   \r\n On December 6, 1995, Grillo served \r\n  a complaint alleging causes of action for negligence and strict liability against \r\n  CMP.(1) Specifically, Grillo alleged the label \r\n  on the Speedrite Ink bottle failed to comply with the Federal Hazardous Substance \r\n  Labeling Act and failed to adequately warn a user of the dangers associated \r\n  with the product. As a result, Grillo alleged that he sustained permanent injuries \r\n  to his immune and nervous systems as a result of exposure to toluene. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court granted CMP's summary \r\n  judgment motion. The court held Grillo's causes of action were barred under \r\n  the statute of limitations because Grillo either knew or should have known no \r\n  later than May of 1992 that he had a potential cause of action against the company. \r\n  In reaching this conclusion, the court noted Grillo's deposition testimony established \r\n  he knew by May of 1992 that the Speedrite Ink was causing him problems. \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The evidence and inferences which \r\n  can be reasonably drawn are to be viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n  non-moving party. Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  69 (1999). All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence \r\n  must be construed most strongly against the movant. Even when there is no dispute \r\n  as to the evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to \r\n  be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. However, when plain, \r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, \r\n  summary judgment should be granted. \"If triable issues exist, those \r\n  issues must go to the jury.\" Young v. S.C. Dep't of Corrections, 333 \r\n  S.C. 714, 718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n\r\nI. \r\n   \r\nGrillo argues, considering the facts \r\n  in a light most favorable to him, that CMP was not entitled to summary judgment \r\n  as a matter of law where reasonable minds could differ on when he knew or should \r\nhave known he had a cause of action against CMP. We agree.\r\nThe elements of a cause of action \r\n  in tort for personal injury are (1) duty, (2) breach of that duty, (3) proximate \r\n  causation, and (4) injury. Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly, 269 S.C. 479, 238 \r\n  S.E.2d 167 (1977). By statute, an action for personal injury must be commenced \r\n  within three years after the cause of action shall have accrued. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§15-3-20 and 15-3-530(5) (1976 and Supp. 1999). \"The fundamental test . . . \r\n  in determining whether a cause of action has accrued[] is whether the party \r\n  asserting the claim can maintain an action to enforce it.\" Brown v. Finger, \r\n  240 S.C. 102, 111, 124 S.E.2d 781, 785 (1962). Stated differently, \"[a] cause \r\n  of action accrues at the moment when the plaintiff has a legal right to sue \r\n  on it.\" Id.   \r\nOur legislature modified the application \r\n  of the general rule of accrual to personal injury actions by statutorily imposing \r\n  the \"discovery rule.\" As enacted, all actions initiated under section 15-3-530(5) \r\n  \"must be commenced within three years after the person knew or by the exercise \r\n  of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of action.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann.Â§15-3-535 (Supp. 1999). In construing the \"reasonable diligence\" requirement, \r\n  our supreme court stated:  \r\nThe exercise of reasonable diligence \r\n  means simply that an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts \r\n  and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience \r\n  on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against \r\n  another party might exist. The statute of limitations begins to run from this \r\n  point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory developed. \r\n   \r\nSnell v. Columbia Gun Exchange \r\n  Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981)(An accidental and unexplained \r\n  discharge of a pistol places the injured party on notice that a defect in the \r\n  weapon is possible.).   \r\nA key element in the reasonable diligence \r\n  test is \"notice.\" The fact that an injured party may not comprehend the full \r\n  extent of the damage is immaterial. Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 645 (1996) (Trial court correctly granted directed verdict for defendant \r\n  where plaintiff testified she saw crack in her building and, at that time, believed \r\n  it resulted from pile driving activities of defendant.). More recently, the \r\n  supreme court has explained that \"[i]n a negligence action, the statute of limitations \r\n  accrues at the time of the negligence or when the facts and circumstances would \r\n  put a person of common knowledge on notice that there might be a claim against \r\n  another party.\" True v. Monteith, 327 S.C. 116, 119, 489 S.E.2d 615, \r\n  616 (1997) (citing Kreutner v. David, 320 S.C. 283, 465 S.E.2d 88 (1995)). \r\n  Under section 15-3-535, the statute of limitations is triggered not merely by \r\n  knowledge of an injury, but by knowledge of facts, diligently acquired, sufficient \r\n  to put a person on notice of the existence of a cause of action against another. \r\n  Id. This is an objective, not a subjective, determination. Wiggins \r\n  v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994).  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n   \r\nOur courts have not addressed the \r\n  application of the discovery rule in an analogous context. However, in the context \r\n  of a latent occupational disease, the District Court for the District of South \r\n  Carolina considered the application of the statute of limitations in Hinson \r\n  v. Owens-Illinois Inc., 677 F. Supp. 406 (D.S.C. 1987). In Hinson, \r\n  the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Recognizing \r\n  that the development of asbestosis takes place over a period of time, the court \r\n  looked at the information available to the plaintiff over a number of years \r\n  concerning his exposure to asbestos material and his medical condition. Finally, \r\n  the court concluded that, at the latest, as of the time the plaintiff underwent \r\n  a CAT scan which positively revealed asbestosis, a person of common knowledge \r\n  and experience would have been on notice that some right of his had been invaded. \r\n    \r\nThe court rejected the plaintiff's \r\n  argument that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the date \r\n  he received a definitive diagnosis of asbestosis, some two years after the CAT \r\n  scan. Notably, however, the court rebuffed the defendants' contention that the \r\n  plaintiff knew he suffered an actionable injury attributable to asbestos several \r\n  years earlier when he was initially diagnosed by a physician with pulmonary \r\n  emphysema and fibrosis. The physician expressed his opinion at that time that \r\n  the pulmonary findings were due to asbestos exposure. The court concluded the \r\n  physician had no proof that the pulmonary emphysema and fibrosis were caused \r\n  by the plaintiff's exposure to asbestos. The court further concluded, viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, that the evidence indicated the \r\n  plaintiff had no medical proof that his lung condition was due to his exposure \r\n  to the defendants' products at that time, making initiation of a lawsuit premature. \r\n  See generally Joel E. Smith, Annotation, When statute of limitations \r\n  begins to run as to cause of action for development of latent industrial or \r\n  occupational disease 1 A.L.R. 4th 117 (1980 and Supp. 1999). \r\n   \r\nIn comparison to a latent disease \r\n  case, where the cumulative effects of exposure may not manifest for a period \r\n  of years, this case is distinguishable. Grillo experienced temporary symptoms \r\n  or discomfort almost immediately upon exposure. He also associated his symptoms, \r\n  at least to some extent, with the use of the Speedrite Ink shortly thereafter. \r\n  However, it was a result of the additional prolonged exposure on December 14, \r\n  1992, that Grillo allegedly suffered permanent injuries for which he now seeks \r\n  damages. Applying the discovery rule in this context, the determination to be \r\n  made is when temporary symptoms become an \"injury\" from which the surrounding \r\n  facts and circumstances should put a person on notice that a cause of action \r\n  exists. See Snell v. Columbia Gun Exchange Inc., 276 S.C. 301, \r\n  333, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981) (\"[A]n injured party must act with some promptness \r\n  where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of \r\n  common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has \r\n  been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.\") (emphasis \r\n  added).   \r\nIn considering the relationship between \r\n  temporary symptoms and the application of the discovery rule, we find some guidance \r\n  in the decisions of other jurisdictions in toxic exposure and latent disease \r\n  cases. New York's Court of Appeals interpreted its discovery rule to trigger \r\n  the statute of limitations when the injured party discovers the primary condition \r\n  on which the claim is based. In re: New York county DES Litigation (Wetherill \r\n  v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.), 678 N.E.2d 474 (N.Y. 1997). In Wetherill, \r\n  the court recognized that \"there may be situations in which the claimant may \r\n  experience early symptoms that are too isolated or inconsequential to trigger \r\n  the running of the Statute of Limitations. . . .\" Id. at 478, n.4.  \r\n   \r\nIn Johnson v. Exxon Corp., \r\n  685 N.Y.S.2d 530 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999), a New York appellate court addressed \r\n  the application of the discovery rule, as construed in Wetherill, in \r\n  the context of an action for work-related injuries allegedly sustained from \r\n  toxic exposure. In Johnson, the claimant in that case had experienced \r\n  occasional ailments over a two-year period as a result of exposure to chemicals. \r\n  In a memorandum opinion, the court determined the claimant did not \"discover\" \r\n  the condition on which the claim was based until an occurrence when she was \r\n  \"overcome by fumes while working and suffered body tremors, a feeling of intoxication, \r\n  a shooting pain in her head, rashes on her face and neck, and nausea.\" Id. \r\n  The court determined it was at this point, when claimant could not return to \r\n  work, that the statute was triggered, as opposed to previous occurrences where \r\n  plaintiff suffered isolated and inconsequential symptoms. See also O'Halloran \r\n  v. 345 Park Co., 675 N.Y.S.2d 55 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998), leave to appeal \r\n  dismissed, 707 N.E.2d 445 (1998) (The court concluded symptoms were too \r\n  isolated or inconsequential to trigger statute, where claimant only missed two \r\n  and a half days of work and did not seek medical attention or file a workers' \r\n  compensation claim at that time.). Cf. Scheidel v. A.C. and S. Inc., \r\n  685 N.Y.S.2d 829 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999) (Applying the discovery rule in the context \r\n  of a toxic tort, the court concluded that awareness of severe and persistent \r\n  manifestations of the illness of asbestosis, including increasing shortness \r\n  of breath, difficulty in walking any distance, and changing the nature of employment \r\n  due to onset of physical limitations, constituted discovery.)  \r\n   \r\nIn Hildebrandt v. Allied Corp., \r\n  839 F.2d 396 (8th Cir. 1987), the federal appeals court considered \r\n  the application of the Minnesota statute of limitations to a case of occupational \r\n  exposure to toluene diisocyanate. The plaintiffs alleged they were exposed to \r\n  the product for a number of years at their workplace and, as a result, developed \r\n  permanent lung damage. The federal district court granted summary judgment to \r\n  the defendants based upon the statute of limitations. In this ruling, the district \r\n  court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that although they were aware of the \r\n  injury in the form of sensitization to the toluene product, they did not know \r\n  their respiratory injuries were or could be permanent. Id. at 398.  \r\n   \r\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  reversed. The court noted the evidence demonstrated the plaintiffs manifested \r\n  symptoms after their initial exposure to the product but \"the evidence is questionable \r\n  whether they knew or should have known those symptoms were the manifestation \r\n  of harm or impairment for which they now claim damages . . . or whether those \r\n  symptoms were the manifestation of temporary sickness or discomfort.\" Id. \r\n  The court stated:  \r\nThere is a substantial difference \r\n  between knowledge of injury and the cause of that injury and mere suspicion. \r\n  . . . The evidence shows that [the plaintiffs'] suspicions regarding their symptoms \r\n  about TDI were either unconfirmed or denied at the time of their early employment \r\n  with Whirlpool. If they had filed an action when they were employed at Whirlpool \r\n  and complained of their symptoms, their claim may well have been dismissed as \r\n  frivolous. A jury, like the plaintiffs' physicians, may have concluded that \r\n  the plaintiffs' manifestations were unrelated to TDI exposure. Thus, if the \r\n  plaintiffs had filed, a later cause of action could have been barred. We \r\n  do not believe Minnesota's applicable statutes of limitation were intended to \r\n  provoke the premature commencement of claims for temporary sickness or discomfort. \r\n  Rather, the plaintiffs are entitled to wait until the cause has been rationally \r\n  identified.  \r\nId. at 399. (emphasis \r\n  added).   \r\nThe Hildebrandt opinion cited \r\n  the case of Schiele v. Hobart Corp., 587 P.2d 1010 (Or. 1978). Schiele \r\n  is also an occupational disease case. A meat wrapper sued for permanent injuries \r\n  from alleged exposure to polyvinyl chloride fumes caused by the use of a meat \r\n  wrapping machine. The trial court granted summary judgment to the defendants \r\n  based upon the statute of limitations. The Oregon Supreme Court reversed and \r\n  remanded for trial. Factually, the Oregon court noted the plaintiff began to \r\n  experience a variety of health problems, including nausea, dizziness, choking, \r\n  coughing, and difficulty catching her breath soon after she began using the \r\n  meat wrapping machine. The court noted \"[a]lmost from the outset, the plaintiff \r\n  associated these problems with the fumes which the machine generated as its \r\n  hot wire cut the polyvinyl chloride meat wrapping film.\" Id. at 1011. \r\n  The plaintiff''s health problems worsened until she was hospitalized approximately \r\n  two years later with pneumonia. At that time, doctors informed her that her \r\n  illness was possibly due to her exposure to polyvinyl chloride fumes on the \r\n  job. Id. at 1012.  \r\nIn reversing the trial court's grant \r\n  of summary judgment on the statute of limitations, the Oregon Supreme Court \r\n  noted \"the statute of limitations on claims involving negligent infliction of \r\n  an occupational disease does not begin to run until the plaintiff knows, or \r\n  as a reasonably prudent person should know, that he has the condition for which \r\n  his action is brought and that the defendant caused it.\" Id. at 1013. \r\n  The court stated:  \r\n[W]e reject defendants' claim that \r\n  knowledge of symptoms and their causal relationship to defendants' actions in \r\n  and of itself initiates the running of the statute. We do not believe the \r\n  legislature intended that the statute be applied in a manner which would require \r\n  one to file an action for temporary sickness or discomfort or risk the loss \r\n  of a right of action for permanent injury. The statute of limitations begins \r\n  to run when a reasonably prudent person associates his symptoms with a serious \r\n  or permanent condition and at the same time perceives the role which the defendant \r\n  has played in inducing that condition. \r\n   \r\nId. at 1014. (emphasis added). \r\n  See also Childs v. Haussecker, 974 S.W.2d 31, 40 (Tex. 1998)(In \r\n  a latent occupational disease case, a cause of action accrues whenever a \"plaintiff's \r\n  symptoms manifest themselves to a degree or for a duration that would put a \r\n  reasonable person on notice that he or she suffers from some injury and he or \r\n  she knows, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that \r\n  the injury is likely work-related.\"); Martinez v. Humble Sand &amp; Gravel, \r\n  Inc., 940 S.W.2d 139, 144 (Tex. Ct. App. 1996) aff'd, 974 S.W.2d \r\n  31(Tex. 1998) ( \"[D]iscovery of the 'nature' of an injury resulting from a progressive \r\n  occupational disease must include knowledge sufficient to determine whether \r\n  the injury is a temporary sickness or a permanent condition.\" The court noted \r\n  that the discovery rule should not be applied in a manner which would require \r\n  one to file an action for temporary sickness or discomfort or risk the loss \r\n  of a right of action for permanent injury. The court further noted, as an example, \r\n  the absurdity of requiring a sandblaster, who might know that silicosis can \r\n  be related to sandblasting, to file a lawsuit at the first sign of a cough in \r\n  order to protect his rights in the case that he might suffer from the disease.) \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n   \r\nViewing the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to Grillo, we conclude CMP was not entitled to summary judgment \r\n  as a matter of law on the basis that Grillo should have known he had a cause \r\n  of action when he associated his temporary symptoms with the use of the ink \r\n  as of May 1992. We find more than one inference can be drawn as to when a reasonable \r\n  person would have been on notice that he might have a cause of action against \r\n  CMP. Institution of an action based upon those temporary symptoms would likely \r\n  have been premature and possibly frivolous. Moreover, the permanent injuries \r\n  for which Grillo now seeks recovery would not have been compensable at that \r\n  time. Accordingly, a jury issue is presented as to the application of the statute \r\n  of limitations in this case. See Johnston v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 45 (1993).  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.

Burns commenced \r\n  this action against UHS as well as two of her coworkers, Celia Yu (Yu) and Melanie \r\n  Powers (Powers). She alleged wrongful termination, breach of implied covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing, civil conspiracy, defamation, and intentional \r\n  infliction of emotional distress (outrage). \r\n   \r\n The defendants, UHS, Yu, and Powers, \r\n  filed a motion to dismiss, motion to strike, and a motion for a more definite \r\n  statement in addition to an answer in response to Burns' amended complaint. \r\n  These motions were originally set for argument on February 27, 1998, but were \r\n  twice continued on Burns' counsel's assertion that the underlying issues could \r\n  be settled without a hearing. Subsequently, the motions were rescheduled for \r\n  argument on July 9, 1998 at 11:30 A.M.  \r\n   \r\nBurns' counsel alleges that he first \r\n  became aware on July 8, 1998, that the motions hearing was scheduled for the \r\n  next day. Counsel contacted the court at 8:45 A.M. the day of the hearing, advised \r\n  the court of a scheduling conflict, and requested a continuance. The trial court \r\n  apprised counsel that the motion would not be carried over and that he needed \r\n  to be present at 4:00 P.M. the same afternoon for argument on the motions. The \r\n  trial court was unable to contact the defendants' counsel regarding the time \r\n  change until the originally scheduled hearing time. Due to the scheduling conflict, \r\n  Burns' counsel sent an associate to argue the motions. \r\n   \r\nNo motion for sanctions was filed \r\n  prior to the hearing. Defense counsel made an oral motion for sanctions at the \r\n  conclusion of the hearing. After the hearing, the trial court issued an order \r\n  in which it criticized the merits of the complaint and Burns' counsel's role \r\n  in causing the hearing delay. The court imposed a $360.00 sanction. This appeal \r\n  follows.  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n   \r\n\"The imposition of sanctions is generally \r\n  entrusted to the sound discretion of the Circuit Court.\" Downey v. Dixon, \r\n  294 S.C. 42, 45, 362 S.E.2d 317, 318 (Ct. App. 1987). Burns argues the trial \r\n  court abused its discretion by awarding three-hundred sixty dollars ($360.00) \r\n  in sanctions to opposing counsel. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court's order stated that \r\n  the complaint was poorly drafted and too general. The trial court further noted \r\n  that counsel was given three different opportunities to amend the complaint \r\n  and failed to do so.(2) The order further stated \r\n  that \"the circumstances under which this Motion came before this court on July \r\n  9, support Defendants' request and motion for sanctions. Accordingly, I ORDER \r\n  that Plaintiff's counsel pay to the McNair Law Firm, P.A. Three hundred sixty \r\n  and no/100 dollars ($360.00) for the reasons set forth above.\" The order finally \r\n  stated that \"based on all of the circumstances concerning this motion,\" \r\n  sanctions were proper. (Emphasis added.) \r\n   \r\nBased on the language in the trial \r\n  court's order, and the record before us, it is not clear whether the court intended \r\n  to penalize behavior which delayed the July 9 hearing, or whether the court \r\n  intended to impose a sanction under Rule 11, SCRCP. In either case, we find \r\n  the trial court abused its discretion.  \r\n   \r\nRule 11, SCRCP, provides in pertinent \r\n  part:  \r\nThe signature of an attorney or party \r\n  constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other \r\n  paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief there is good \r\n  ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay. . . . If a pleading, \r\n  motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this Rule, the court, upon \r\n  motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, \r\n  a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an \r\n  order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses \r\n  incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including \r\n  a reasonable attorney's fee.\r\nRule 11(a), SCRCP. \r\n   \r\nUnder this Rule, an attorney may \r\n  be sanctioned for filing a frivolous pleading, motion, or other paper, or for \r\n  making frivolous arguments. See Link v. School Dist. of Pickens County, \r\n  302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990). The attorney may also be sanctioned for filing \r\n  a pleading, motion, or other paper in bad faith (i.e., to cause unnecessary \r\n  delay) whether or not there is good ground to support it. See Johnson \r\n  v. Dailey, 318 S.C. 318, 457 S.E.2d 613 (1995).  \r\n   \r\nThe issue in this context is whether \r\n  the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a sanction without affording \r\n  Burns' counsel notice or an opportunity to respond. We find the failure to afford \r\n  these procedural protections resulted in an abuse of discretion. \r\n   \r\nRule 11, SCRCP, provides little guidance \r\n  as to the procedural guidelines to be followed prior to the imposition of sanctions \r\n  under the rule. The rule merely provides that where a violation occurs, the \r\n  court, upon motion or its own initiative, may impose appropriate sanctions. \r\n  Further, our courts have never addressed the procedural protections afforded \r\n  in this context. However, we find guidance in the decisions of federal and state \r\n  courts construing similar versions of the rule.  \r\n   \r\nThe state rule is based upon the \r\n  language of the pre-1983 version of Federal Rule 11. The federal rule was amended \r\n  in 1983 and again in 1993 to alter the requirements imposed on the signing party/attorney. \r\n  The 1993 amendment also specifically calls for \"notice and a reasonable opportunity \r\n  to respond\" prior to the imposition of sanctions under the rule. Nevertheless, \r\n  prior to the 1993 amendment, federal courts read due process protections into \r\n  the rule to provide the signing party/attorney with notice and an opportunity \r\n  to respond prior to imposition of sanctions under the rule. See Hudson \r\n  v. Moore Business Forms, Inc., 898 F.2d 684 (9th Cir. 1990); \r\n  Media Duplication Servs, Ltd. v. HDG Software, Inc., 928 F.2d 1228 (1st \r\n  Cir. 1991); Tom Growney Equip., Inc. v. Shelley Irrigation Dev., Inc., \r\n  834 F.2d 833 (9th Cir. 1987).  \r\n   \r\n Additionally, the North Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court, interpreting its version of Rule 11 which is similar to the post-1983 \r\n  version of Federal Rule 11, recognized that \"[n]otice and an opportunity to \r\n  be heard prior to depriving a person of his property are essential elements \r\n  of due process of law which is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the \r\n  United States Constitution.\" Griffin v. Griffin, 500 S.E.2d 437, 438 \r\n  (N.C. 1998) (quoting McDonald's Corp. v. Dwyer, 450 S.E.2d 888, 891 (N.C. \r\n  1994)). In Griffin, the Supreme Court found prior notice inadequate where \r\n  the trial court sua sponte imposed Rule 11 sanctions on other grounds. The court \r\n  stated: \"In order to pass constitutional muster, the person against whom sanctions \r\n  are to be imposed must be advised in advance of the charges against him.\" Id. \r\n  at 439. See also Polygenex Int'l, Inc., v. Polyzen, Inc., 515 \r\n  S.E.2d 457 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999) (The trial court imposed individual sanctions \r\n  against a person that verified a complaint in his capacity as a corporate officer. \r\n  The North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated the sanction order as to the corporate \r\n  officer, determining that he was not made a party to the underlying action and \r\n  was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard.)  \r\n   \r\nWe hold that a signing party or attorney \r\n  is entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond prior to imposition of sanctions \r\n  under Rule 11, SCRCP. We find no evidence that Burns' counsel was provided either \r\n  notice or an opportunity to respond on the issue of sanctions under Rule 11. \r\n  Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by issuing sanctions against \r\n  Burns' counsel without affording these procedural protections.  \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, while the court had \r\n  the authority to hold Burns' counsel in contempt for his behavior before the \r\n  court, we can find no such specific finding of contempt. A decision regarding \r\n  contempt should be reversed only if without evidentiary support or the trial \r\n  judge abused his discretion. \"Contempt results from the willful disobedience \r\n  of a court order.\" Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d \r\n  125, 129 (1989). Also, conduct which tends to bring authority and the administration \r\n  of the law into disrespect constitutes \"contemptuous behavior.\" Stone v. \r\n  Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840 (1988). However, this contemptuous \r\n  conduct must be clearly and specifically reflected in the record. Brasington \r\n  v. Shannon, 288 S.C. 183, 341 S.E.2d 130 (1986).  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court's order on this issue \r\n  is vague, and the trial court did not properly explain the basis for the sanctions \r\n  imposed. Burns' counsel requested a continuance which was denied. The trial \r\n  court ordered counsel to be ready to proceed with argument later that afternoon, \r\n  and counsel arranged for an associate to be present and proceed with argument. \r\n  We can find no specific behavior in violation of a court order or which the \r\n  trial court identified as disrespectful of the court's authority.  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial \r\n  court's order for sanctions whether grounded on a Rule 11 violation or a direct \r\n  finding of contempt.   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Burns additionally \r\n  appealed the dismissal of a portion of her complaint for failing to state a \r\n  cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage. \r\n  Counsel for both parties conceded at oral argument that the dismissal order \r\n  is to be construed so as to allow Burns the opportunity, on a limited basis, \r\n  to replead this cause of action. Burns is allowed to replead with the specificity \r\n  required in the trial court's order the allegation that the defendants \"accused \r\n  [Burns] of killing a patient.\" Burns is further allowed to replead this allegation \r\n  with regard to all the defendants, so long as Burns includes the officers of \r\n  UHS in the allegation. \r\n2.  We note that \r\n  Burns' counsel of record on appeal did not draft the original complaint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3170","title":"Richardson v.

The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor \r\n  of Respondents, finding they were immune from liability under the South Carolina \r\n  Recreational Use Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-3-10 to -70 (1991 &amp; Supp. \r\n  1999), and the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to \r\n  -200 (Supp. 1999). Richardson appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Richland County Recreation Commission \r\n  owns Greenview Park. The park consists of more than twenty-one acres and contains \r\n  two baseball fields. The smaller baseball field has been enclosed with cyclone \r\n  fencing since about 1969. The park contains a natural creek or drainage ditch \r\n  that runs parallel to the first base side of the smaller baseball field. In \r\n  June 1987, the County reconstructed a segment of the drainage ditch by installing \r\n  large underground drainage pipes and covering the pipes with soil. The County \r\n  placed fencing around the intake areas for the pipes. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe County later leased the property \r\n  to the City of Columbia for use as a park under a ninety-nine-year lease. The \r\n  City took possession of the park on January 1, 1993. Under the lease, the City \r\n  is solely responsible for the maintenance of the property and the facilities. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 14, 1995, Dannie Richardson, \r\n  then eleven years old, went to Greenview Park to participate in a baseball game \r\n  organized by the Greenview Dixie Youth Baseball League. The Greenview coaches \r\n  were volunteers, not employees of the Respondents. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDannie's coach, Ricky Ricardo Dykes, \r\n  instructed the players to arrive at the park at 6:00 p.m. for a 7:15 p.m. game. \r\n  While waiting for the game to begin, Dannie and some other players stood outside \r\n  the fence of the smaller baseball field on the first base side to catch foul \r\n  balls from a game in progress. According to Dannie, a pop-up foul ball came \r\n  over the fence, and he ran to get it. The ball stopped about one foot from the \r\n  edge of the ditch. Dannie leaned over and picked it up but then dropped it. \r\n  When he leaned over to pick it up again, the edge of the ditch collapsed and \r\n  he fell \"[s]traight down,\" breaking his leg. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRichardson filed this action against \r\n  Respondents on May 8, 1997, for her son's injuries. Respondents claimed immunity \r\n  from liability under the Recreational Use Statute and the Tort Claims Act. The \r\n  court granted summary judgment to the Respondents. The court found the action \r\n  was barred by the Recreational Use Statute because there was no evidence Respondents \r\n  acted with gross negligence and, alternatively, the action was barred by the \r\n  Tort Claims Act because there was no evidence Respondents had actual notice \r\n  of the condition. Richardson appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is proper only when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Koester v. Carolina Rental \r\n  Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 443 S.E.2d 392 (1994) (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP). \r\n  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all \r\n  reasonable inferences drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the party opposing summary judgment. Hamiter v. Retirement Div. of the \r\n  S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 326 S.C. 93, 484 S.E.2d 586 (1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRichardson first asserts the court \r\n  erred in applying the Recreational Use Statute, enacted in 1962, to her claims. \r\n  She argues that only the Tort Claims Act, enacted in 1986, is applicable to \r\n  her claims because \"specific laws prevail over general laws, and later legislation \r\n  takes precedence over earlier legislation.\"(1) \r\n  The court rejected Richardson's argument below, finding the two statutes were \r\n  \"easily reconciled.\" The court concluded the Recreational Use Statute, therefore, \r\n  applied to Respondents in this case. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen two statutes can be reconciled, \r\n  the court must construe the statutes in such a way that both remain functional. \r\n  Porter v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 327 S.C. 220, 224 n.3, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 467, 469 n.3 (1997). The more recent statute takes precedence over the \r\n  earlier statute only if there is a conflict between the two statutes. Id.; \r\n  see also Heffner v. Destiny, Inc., 321 S.C. 536, 471 S.E.2d 135 \r\n  (1995) (where general statute conflicts with specific statute, the specific \r\n  statute is controlling); Williams v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 311 \r\n  S.C. 417, 429 S.E.2d 802 (1993) (where it is not possible to harmonize two statutes, \r\n  the later enactment supersedes the earlier legislation). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Tort Claims Act is \"the exclusive \r\n  civil remedy available for any tort committed by a governmental entity, its \r\n  employees, or its agents except as provided in Â§ 15-78-70(b).\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-20(b) (Supp. 1999). Under the Tort Claims Act, the governmental entity \r\n  is liable for torts \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private \r\n  individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability \r\n  and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages, contained herein.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 1999). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOne exemption from liability contained \r\n  in the Tort Claims Act provides the governmental entity is not liable for a \r\n  loss caused by: \r\n   \r\n(16) maintenance, security, or supervision \r\n  of any public property, intended or permitted to be used as a park, playground, \r\n  or open area for recreational purposes, unless the defect or condition causing \r\n  a loss is not corrected by the particular governmental entity responsible for \r\n  maintenance, security, or supervision within a reasonable time after actual \r\n  notice of the defect or condition. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(16) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n   \r\nIf Dannie's injuries resulted from \r\n  an action involving the maintenance, security, or supervision of the park, then \r\n  we would resolve Richardson's claims under the Tort Claims Act. If the injuries \r\n  resulted from anything other than the maintenance, security, or supervision \r\n  of the park, we would look at any other exemptions from liability found in the \r\n  Tort Claims Act, including Â§ 15-78-60(10). If no other exemptions apply, then \r\n  we will hold the Respondents liable in the same manner as a private individual \r\n  under the same circumstances, still subject to the limitations upon liability \r\n  and damages contained in the Tort Claims Act. Because a private individual would \r\n  be entitled to claim immunity under the Recreational Use Statute, the Respondents \r\n  would be entitled to claim immunity under the Recreational Use Statute as well. \r\n  See Chrisley v. United States, 620 F. Supp. 285 (D.S.C. 1985), \r\n  aff'd, 791 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1986). Based on this analysis, \r\n  we hold the Tort Claims Act and the Recreational Use Statute can be reconciled. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe now must analyze the facts of \r\n  this case to determine whether the injury resulted from the maintenance, security, \r\n  or supervision of the park. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRichardson alleged in her complaint \r\n  that the Respondents were negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, willful, wanton \r\n  and careless in several ways: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  by failing to mark the embankment \r\n    in a clear fashion so as to make participants aware of its presence;\r\n\r\n\r\n  in allowing a dangerous condition \r\n    such as the embankment to exist in a concealed fashion, despite having actual \r\n    and constructive notice of the condition;\r\n\r\n\r\n  by placing baseball fields where \r\n    children would be known to be playing unreasonably close to the embankment;\r\n\r\n\r\n  in creating a dangerous condition \r\n    at its park; and \r\n\r\n\r\n  in failing to take appropriate \r\n    measures to make the Greenview Park reasonably safe for its users.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\nEach of Richardson's claims relates \r\n  to the maintenance, security, or supervision of the park. We, therefore, begin \r\n  our analysis of this case under Â§ 15-78-60(16) of the Tort Claims Act. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRichardson argues on appeal the court \r\n  erred in finding the Respondents were immune under the Tort Claims Act. Richardson \r\n  specifically asserts a question of fact existed regarding whether the ditch \r\n  was a defect, whether the Respondents had actual notice of the defect, and whether \r\n  the Respondents failed to correct the defect within a reasonable period of time.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause Richardson's claims relate \r\n  to the maintenance, supervision, or security of the park, the Respondents cannot \r\n  be held liable for Dannie's injuries unless the defect or condition that caused \r\n  his injuries was \"not corrected by the particular governmental entity responsible \r\n  for maintenance, security, or supervision within a reasonable time after actual \r\n  notice of the defect or condition.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(16) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  If the Respondents failed to correct the defect or condition within a reasonable \r\n  time after actual notice of the defect or condition and no other exemptions \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act applied, then the Respondents could be held liable \r\n  for Dannie's injuries as if the Respondents were private individuals. See \r\n  Jackson v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 301 S.C. 125, 390 S.E.2d \r\n  467 (Ct. App. 1989), aff'd, 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d 377 (1990). In that \r\n  case, the Respondents could claim immunity under the Recreational Use Statute. \r\n  See Brooks v. Northwood Little League, Inc., 327 S.C. 400, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 647 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Defect \r\n  or Condition \r\n   \r\nRichardson argues the court erred \r\n  in finding the condition was not a defect as a matter of law. Richardson argues \r\n  that the existence of the ditch was a hazardous condition, i.e., a defect. Richardson \r\n  apparently asserts that Dannie's injuries were caused by the existence of the \r\n  ditch and the Respondents' failure to warn of the ditch. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the order granting summary judgment \r\n  to the County, the court stated \"[i]t is unnecessary . . . to determine whether \r\n  the ground adjacent to the ditch which Plaintiff complains collapsed was a 'defect' \r\n  or an 'unsafe condition.'\" In the order granting summary judgment to the City, \r\n  however, the court found \"as a matter of law that the giving away of the earth \r\n  adjacent to the drainage ditch was a naturally occurring condition rather than \r\n  a defect.\" \r\n   \r\nThe statute does not require the \r\n  finding of a defect. The court merely needs to determine whether a defect or \r\n  a condition caused the injuries. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(16) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n   \r\nAccording to Dannie, he did not slide \r\n  into the ditch; rather, he fell \"straight down.\" He stated the edge of the ditch \r\n  felt like quicksand. The court held: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDannie's injury did not result from \r\n  a lack of a fence, lack of a warning about the existence of the drainage ditch, \r\n  or even the presence of the drainage ditch. Instead, his injury occurred because \r\n  the soil on which he was standing completely gave way vertically, causing him \r\n  to fall - a natural but unfortunate occurrence and one the County had no duty \r\n  to warn or guard against since it never had actual notice of any defect with \r\n  the bank of the ditch. \r\n   \r\nThe court also held \"there is no \r\n  evidence of a causative link between the City's actions or inactions and the \r\n  event of the earth adjacent to the drainage ditch giving way.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe agree with the court's analysis. \r\n  We conclude Dannie's injuries were caused by the collapse of the edge of the \r\n  ditch rather than the existence of the ditch. The case would be different if \r\n  Dannie had run straight into the brush without realizing a ditch was there and \r\n  had fallen into the ditch. In that case, the fact that the ditch existed would \r\n  create a question of fact regarding whether the existence of the ditch was a \r\n  defect. Under the facts as presented in the record, however, we must conclude \r\n  that the condition that caused Dannie's injuries was the collapse of the edge \r\n  of the ditch. \r\n   \r\nB. Actual \r\n  Notice \r\n   \r\nRichardson also argues the Respondents \r\n  cannot claim they had no actual notice of the existence of the ditch because \r\n  all evidence indicates they knew the ditch was there. The court found there \r\n  was no evidence the Respondents had actual notice of a condition which would \r\n  cause the collapse of earth adjacent to the ditch. Because we conclude Dannie's \r\n  injuries were caused by the collapse of the wall of the ditch rather than the \r\n  existence of the ditch, the issue here is whether the Respondents had actual \r\n  notice that the edge of the ditch would collapse. We agree the Respondents had \r\n  no actual notice of this condition. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nActual notice as stated in Â§ 15-78-60(16) \r\n  \"means all the facts are disclosed and there is nothing left to investigate.\" \r\n  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 65, 504 \r\n  S.E.2d 117, 123 (1998). \"Actual notice may be shown by direct evidence or inferred \r\n  from factual circumstances.\" Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe depositions and affidavits submitted \r\n  prove the Respondents had no actual notice of the particular condition that \r\n  caused Dannie's injuries. The County submitted an affidavit from Rodney Kinnett, \r\n  who has been responsible for maintenance of the Richland County parks since \r\n  1979, in which he stated: \r\n   \r\nPrior to Dannie Richardson's accident, \r\n  I was never aware of any instability of the surface of the bank along the edge \r\n  of the drainage ditch adjacent to the first base/right field line of the smaller \r\n  baseball field at Greenview Park. . . . I have reviewed correspondence in the \r\n  Commission's files regarding Greenview Park and have found no letter regarding \r\n  any perceived problems with the surface of the bank of this drainage ditch. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring deposition, Clifford Brevard, \r\n  a Greenview little league coach, stated that in his coaching career, he was \r\n  not aware of any players besides Dannie being hurt in the ditch. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe City's Parks Maintenance Supervisor, \r\n  Melvin Murphy, stated in his affidavit that the City was not aware of any complaints \r\n  by maintenance workers or the public \"that the grassed areas along the edge \r\n  of the ditch were hazardous or giving way nor [had he] encountered any areas \r\n  along the ditch in that condition.\" He further stated that (1) the City crews \r\n  mow the grass in Greenview Park about every two weeks; (2) the grass is maintained \r\n  at an acceptable height for sports such as baseball, football, and soccer; (3) \r\n  the City has several public parks with open ditch lines, and tractors with six \r\n  foot flail mowers have been used to mow all the way to the edge of the ditch, \r\n  and in some parks the ditch lines are also mowed; (4) adults with gas-powered \r\n  commercial trimmers cut, edge, and trim the grass on the edge of the ditch; \r\n  and (5) vegetation was allowed to grow on the embankment for erosion control \r\n  and to form a natural barrier to keep people out of the ditch, but the vegetation \r\n  did not hide the ditch, as it was open and obvious and clearly visible to persons \r\n  in the park. \r\n   \r\nRichardson failed to demonstrate \r\n  in the record that Respondents had actual notice of any condition or defect. \r\n  The only evidence is that the condition which caused Dannie's unfortunate fall \r\n  was the collapse of the ground adjacent to the ditch, a condition which was \r\n  unanticipated and unknown to all parties. There were no prior complaints that \r\n  the area was dangerous and no prior injuries. City workers had recently worked \r\n  in the area using heavy equipment to the edge of the ditch and had walked along \r\n  the edges without incident. As the court observed, \"[t]he danger lay hidden \r\n  under the green grass and was, therefore, concealed from everyone's view.\" Because \r\n  the land supported the adults, no one could anticipate that the edge of the \r\n  ditch would not support the weight of a child. Respondents, thus, had no actual \r\n  notice of the condition. \r\n   \r\nC. Failure \r\n  to Correct \r\n   \r\nBecause we find the Respondents did \r\n  not have actual notice of the condition that caused Dannie's injuries, we cannot \r\n  hold the Respondents liable for failing to correct the condition prior to Dannie's \r\n  fall. \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe court did not err in determining \r\n  as a matter of law that Respondents were immune from liability under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(16) of the Tort Claims Act.(3) \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the court granting summary judgment \r\n  to Respondents is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  While this \r\n  court has addressed the issue of whether the Recreational Use Statute applies \r\n  to a governmental entity, see Brooks v. Northwood Little League, Inc., \r\n  327 S.C. 400, 489 S.E.2d 647 (Ct. App. 1997), the issue presented in this case \r\n  is novel to South Carolina law. In Brooks, we noted that the school and \r\n  the county had raised the Tort Claims Act as a defense in their answer, but \r\n  their motion for summary judgment was based on the applicability of the Recreational \r\n  Use Statute rather than the Tort Claims Act. The trial court did not consider \r\n  the additional ground of the immunity afforded by the Tort Claims Act, and the \r\n  parties did not raise the issue on appeal. Id. at 407 n.8, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  at 651 n.8. \r\n2.  Richardson \r\n  also argues the court erred in finding the ditch was open and obvious. The crucial \r\n  issue in this case, however, is not whether the ditch was open and obvious, \r\n  but whether the Respondents had actual notice of a defect or condition and failed \r\n  to remedy such defect or condition within a reasonable period. We, therefore, \r\n  will not address the issue of whether the ditch was open and obvious. \r\n3.  Because we \r\n  find the Respondents were immune from liability under Â§ 15-78-60(16), we need \r\n  not address Richardson's arguments that the court erred in finding that the \r\n  Respondents were not grossly negligent under the Recreational Use Statute and \r\n  the Respondents were immune under Â§ 15-78-60(10). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3171","title":"State Farm v.

State Farm paid $15,000 from each of the \r\n  two policies, denying any further payment even though each policy carried underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage of $100,000 per person, not to exceed $300,000 per accident. \r\n  The trial court granted State Farm's motion for summary judgment, holding State \r\n  Farm owed no further coverage on the non-involved vehicle policies. We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nThe following facts were stipulated \r\n  by the parties for purposes of this action. Gunning's motorcycle was struck \r\n  by a vehicle driven by Paul Tiano. Tiano was at fault in the collision. Tiano \r\n  was insured under a policy which provided liability coverage with limits of \r\n  $15,000 per person, not to exceed $30,000 per accident. State Farm insured Gunning's \r\n  motorcycle under a policy which provided liability coverage with limits of $15,000 \r\n  per person, not to exceed $30,000 per accident. The policy contained no UIM \r\n  coverage. In addition, Gunning and his wife owned two vehicles, both of which \r\n  were separately insured with State Farm. Each had identical coverage, including \r\n  UIM, of $100,000 per person, not to exceed $300,000 per accident.  \r\n   \r\nMrs. Gunning settled with Tiano's \r\n  liability insurance carrier for the policy limit of $15,000. She then filed \r\n  claims with State Farm on the policies providing UIM coverage on the two non-involved \r\n  vehicles. State Farm paid $30,000, representing $15,000 from each of the two \r\n  policies. State Farm denied further payment because each policy contained a \r\n  provision limiting available UIM coverage to basic limits where the insured \r\n  was driving an owned vehicle which did not provide UIM coverage.  \r\n   \r\nState Farm then brought this action \r\n  to declare that no further UIM coverage was available under the policies. The \r\n  parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted State \r\n  Farm's motion, holding that State Farm owed no further UIM coverage. This appeal \r\n  follows.  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated Section \r\n  38-77-160 governs the application of UIM coverage and provides in pertinent \r\n  part as follows:\r\nAutomobile insurance carriers shall \r\n  offer . . . at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up \r\n  to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event \r\n  that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault \r\n  insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation \r\n  imposed by statute. If, however, an insured or named insured is protected \r\n  by uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the basic limits, \r\n  the policy shall provide that the insured or named insured is protected only \r\n  to the extent of the coverage he has on the vehicle involved in the accident. \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added). This statutory provision applies to every policy as \r\n  if embodied therein, and inconsistent insurance policy provisions are void. \r\n  See Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 311 S.E.2d 723 \r\n  (1984). Accordingly, the insurance policy provisions for non-involved vehicles \r\n  which restrict available UIM coverage to basic limits if the insured is driving \r\n  an owned vehicle having no UIM coverage are enforceable if not inconsistent \r\n  with section 38-77-160 and the public policy supporting the Financial Responsibility \r\n  Act.\r\nGunning first argues that this case \r\n  is controlled by McAlister v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \r\n  301 S.C. 113, 390 S.E.2d 383 (Ct. App. 1990). In McAlister, this Court \r\n  held the insurer's attempt to contractually restrict UIM coverage contravened \r\n  public policy supporting the Financial Responsibility Act under facts similar \r\n  to those here. However, the applicability of the statutory predecessor to section \r\n  38-77-160 was not considered by the court in McAlister because the issue \r\n  was not preserved for appeal. Consequently, McAlister is not controlling.\r\nIn this case, the circuit court interpreted \r\n  section 38-77-160 to \"clearly limit the amount of coverage which can be stacked \r\n  from policies on vehicles not involved in an accident to an amount no greater \r\n  than the coverage on the vehicle involved in that accident,\" citing Nationwide \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co. v. Howard, 288 S.C. 5, 11, 339 S.E.2d 501, 504 (1985) and \r\n  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mooneyham, 304 S.C. 442, \r\n  446, 405 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1991). The circuit court also relied on Ohio Cas. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Hill, 323 S.C. 208, 473 S.E.2d 843 (Ct. App. 1996), a factually \r\n  similar case in which this Court addressed the effect of section 38-77-160 on \r\n  stacking UIM coverage from an \"at home\" vehicle.  \r\n   \r\nIn Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., Hill \r\n  was injured when operating a motorcycle with no UIM coverage. Hill owned two \r\n  \"at home\" vehicles covered under a policy which provided UIM coverage for each \r\n  vehicle with limits of $25,000 per person, not to exceed $50,000 per accident. \r\n  In exchange for a partial release, Hill recovered $25,000 pursuant to the UIM \r\n  provisions of the policy covering the non-involved vehicles. A declaratory judgment \r\n  action was brought to determine whether an additional $25,000 in UIM coverage \r\n  could be stacked.   \r\nThis Court held that Hill could not \r\n  stack the UIM coverage from the second \"at home\" vehicle because section 38-77-160 \r\n  limits the amount of coverage an insured may stack from a policy on a non-involved \r\n  vehicle to an amount no greater than the UIM coverage on the vehicle involved \r\n  in the accident. As Hill had no UIM coverage on the motorcycle involved in the \r\n  accident, he was not entitled to stack any UIM coverage from the \"at home\" vehicle. \r\n    \r\nIn Continental Ins. Co. v. Shives, \r\n  328 S.C. 470, 492 S.E.2d 808 (Ct. App. 1997), this Court again addressed \r\n  a factually similar situation. Shives was injured while riding a bicycle. At \r\n  the time of the accident, Shives was a named insured on a policy issued by Continental \r\n  which provided up to $500,000 in UIM coverage on two non-involved vehicles. \r\n  Continental paid Shives $500,000 in UIM benefits. Shives asserted that he was \r\n  entitled to stack an additional $500,000 in UIM benefits. This Court first addressed \r\n  Shives' insured status, noting that a Class I insured, defined as an insured \r\n  or named insured that has a vehicle involved in the accident, could stack \r\n  coverage. To resolve the issue of Shives' status, the court reasoned that it \r\n  was necessary to determine whether a bicycle was a vehicle. However, the trial \r\n  judge had already ruled that a bicycle was not a vehicle, and that ruling was \r\n  not appealed. Consequently, that ruling was the law of the case. As such, Shives \r\n  was not a Class I insured, because he was not operating a vehicle. This precluded \r\n  Shives from stacking additional UIM coverage. Notably, however, the court additionally \r\n  stated:   \r\n[e]ven if the bicycle is a vehicle \r\n  under section 38-77-160, Shives cannot stack additional UIM coverage because \r\n  an insured can stack UIM coverage only in an amount equal to the UIM coverage \r\n  on the vehicle involved in the accident. Because there was no UIM coverage on \r\n  the bicycle, Shives cannot stack.  \r\n   \r\nContinental Ins. Co., 328 \r\n  S.C. at 474, 492 S.E.2d at 811. \r\n   \r\nMrs. Gunning attempts to distinguish \r\n  these cases by pointing out that in each the limit of UIM coverage was available \r\n  to the insured on either the vehicle involved in the accident or the first \"at \r\n  home\" vehicle. She contends those cases involved an actual issue of stacking, \r\n  whereas she has yet to recover the limit of UIM coverage from any of the applicable \r\n  policies.   \r\nHowever, as the circuit court determined, \r\n  the clear language of section 38-77-160 applies to limit the extent of excess \r\n  UIM coverage available in each circumstance where an insured seeks recovery \r\n  of UIM benefits from a policy covering a non-involved vehicle. It clearly states \r\n  that where an insured has UIM coverage in excess of the basic limits, the insured \r\n  is limited to the amount of coverage on the vehicle involved in the accident. \r\n  Mr. Gunning's motorcycle involved in the accident had no UIM coverage. Therefore, \r\n  excess UIM coverage from the non-involved vehicles is unavailable to Gunning. \r\n  The policy language relied upon by State Farm to deny additional UIM coverage \r\n  is consistent with the terms of section 38-77-160, and is valid. \r\n   \r\nAs to Mrs. Gunning's two remaining \r\n  arguments, we find them to be manifestly without merit.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3172","title":"Wilson v.

Father also appeals \r\n  a third family court order denying his motion for a continuance on the underlying \r\n  action and awarding Mother additional attorney fees. We reverse and remand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nFather and Mother divorced in July \r\n  1991. The divorce order granted Mother custody of the parties' minor child, \r\n  granted Father visitation rights, and required Father to pay child support. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn May 1997, Father brought an action \r\n  to modify his visitation schedule based on changed circumstances. Specifically, \r\n  Father relocated to North Carolina and alleged Mother prevented him from exercising \r\n  all his visitation rights as set forth in the divorce order. Mother answered, \r\n  admitting Father's visitation schedule should be modified. Mother also counterclaimed, \r\n  seeking an increase in child support. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn July 1997, Mother served Father \r\n  with two sets of interrogatories and a request for document production. Mother \r\n  subsequently filed a motion to compel, not based on her discovery requests, \r\n  which were not yet due, but seeking an order requiring Father to produce the \r\n  standard financial declaration. See Rule 20(a), SCRFC. Prior to Mother's \r\n  motion to compel, Father's attorney moved to be relieved as counsel. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court held a hearing on \r\n  the motion to compel and the motion to be relieved. Father did not attend the \r\n  hearing, allegedly due to medical reasons. On August 4, 1997, the family court \r\n  granted Father's attorney's motion to be relieved and Mother's motion to compel, \r\n  ordering Father to submit a sworn financial declaration on or before September \r\n  1, 1997. Even though not requested in any written motion, the court further \r\n  ordered Father to respond to Mother's discovery requests or be sanctioned fifty \r\n  dollars for every day after September 1, 1997 that he failed to submit the financial \r\n  declaration or respond to the interrogatories and the document request previously \r\n  filed by Mother. Father did not appeal this order. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFather alleges the August 1997 order \r\n  was not served on him until August 26, 1997, only six days before compliance \r\n  with the order was due. Nevertheless, acting pro se, Father submitted \r\n  answers to interrogatories, the document request, and his financial declaration \r\n  by mail on September 2, 1997. Mother's attorney received the information on \r\n  September 5, 1997. \r\n   \r\nAlmost two months later, without \r\n  any further correspondence with Father, Mother petitioned the court for a rule \r\n  to show cause why Father should not be held in contempt for failure to comply \r\n  with the August 1997 order by furnishing incomplete responses to the interrogatories \r\n  and document request. After a hearing the family court found Father's responses \r\n  inadequate, held him in willful contempt for failing to comply with the terms \r\n  of the August 1997 order, and ordered Father incarcerated for nine months, suspended \r\n  upon payment to Mother of $5,100.00 in fines and $1,175.00 in attorney fees \r\n  within thirty days of the order. Further, the family court ordered Father not \r\n  to leave the state without first posting an appearance bond. Father timely appealed \r\n  this order. \r\n   \r\nApproximately two months later, Mother \r\n  petitioned the family court for a second rule to show cause for Father's alleged \r\n  continued failure to comply with the August 1997 order and his failure to comply \r\n  with the mandates of the December 1997 order. After a hearing, the family court \r\n  issued an order on April 16, 1998, holding Father in contempt for violating \r\n  both prior orders, ordering Father to pay Mother an additional $5,500 in fines \r\n  and an additional $850 in attorney fees, withdrawing suspension of Father's \r\n  nine month sentence of incarceration as set forth in the December 1997 order, \r\n  sentencing Father to a consecutive three month term of incarceration, and ordering \r\n  Father's arrest. As a result of the two contempt orders, Father was fined a \r\n  total of $10,600(1) and ordered to pay $2,025 \r\n  in attorney fees. Father timely appealed this order. \r\n   \r\nWhile Father's appeals from the contempt \r\n  orders were pending, the family court held a hearing on Father's underlying \r\n  action to modify his visitation schedule and Mother's counterclaim for increased \r\n  child support. When the hearing began, Father's attorney moved for a continuance \r\n  until after resolution of Father's appeals from the contempt orders. The family \r\n  court denied the motion. \r\n   \r\nFather's attorney called no witnesses \r\n  during the trial, but did submit an amended financial declaration which attested \r\n  Father was no longer employed and had no income. Mother's testimony \r\n  proposed changes to Father's visitation schedule and requested that the family \r\n  court increase Father's child support obligation based on his September 1997 \r\n  financial declaration, which reflected a $4,583 per month income, rather than \r\n  the declaration submitted at the hearing. Mother also suggested prohibiting \r\n  Father from exercising visitation until Father resolved the outstanding bench \r\n  warrant against him. \r\n   \r\nThe family court issued an order \r\n  modifying Father's visitation schedule but ordered Father's visitation rights \r\n  suspended pending resolution of the outstanding bench warrant for his arrest. \r\n  The court also increased Father's child support obligation based on \r\n  Father's earning capacity as set forth in his September 1997 financial declaration \r\n  and gave no weight to Father's August 1998 financial declaration. Finally, \r\n  the court awarded Mother $6,844.65 in attorney fees. The family court denied \r\n  Father's subsequent motion for reconsideration and this appeal followed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\n When reviewing an appeal from family \r\n  court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence. Taylor v. Taylor, 333 S.C. \r\n  209, 215, 508 S.E.2d 50, 54 (Ct. App. 1998). However, we are not required to \r\n  disregard the trial judge's findings who saw and heard the witnesses and was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Contempt \r\n  Proceedings \r\n   \r\nA. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFather's initial contention on appeal \r\n  centers on whether the evidence in the record supports the December 1997 order \r\n  holding him in contempt for violating the August 1997 order. Assuming without \r\n  deciding that the family court possessed the authority to issue the August 1997 \r\n  order, we find the evidence fails to support holding Father in contempt.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nContempt results from the willful \r\n  disobedience of a court order. Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 345, \r\n  491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997). An act is willful if \"done voluntarily \r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, \r\n  or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; \r\n  that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.\" Spartanburg \r\n  County Dep't of Soc. Serv. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-3, 370 S.E.2d 872, \r\n  874 (1988) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)). \r\n  Before a party may be found in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically \r\n  show the contemptuous conduct. Id. at 83, 370 S.E.2d at 874. A determination \r\n  of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge but will be reversed \r\n  when the finding is without evidentiary support or there is an abuse of discretion. \r\n  Id. at 83, 370 S.E.2d at 874-75. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe August 1997 order stated that \r\n  Father would be sanctioned fifty dollars per day \"for every day after September \r\n  1, 1997 that he does not respond to discovery and submit a sworn financial \r\n  declaration to the court and [Mother's] attorney.\" Father did not receive the \r\n  August 1997 order until August 26, a mere six days before discovery was due \r\n  and sanctions were to be imposed. Nevertheless, Father attempted to comply with \r\n  Mother's discovery requests and mailed partial discovery responses only one \r\n  day late. Father's responses included an explanation that the remaining documents \r\n  were in storage and he wished to consult an attorney before setting forth a \r\n  proposed visitation schedule. Mother's attorney received Father's responses \r\n  and explanation on September 5 yet never contacted Father until filing a rule \r\n  to show case almost two months later.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder our view of the evidence, Father \r\n  sufficiently \"responded\" to the discovery requests to disprove the element of \r\n  willfulness necessary for a contempt finding. Furthermore, we question the efficacy \r\n  of proceeding in contempt when Rule 37, SCRCP,(3) \r\n  provides a constellation of sanctions for a party's refusal to comply with discovery \r\n  requests. Therefore, under these facts and circumstances, we hold the family \r\n  court erred in finding Father in contempt for violating the August 1997 order \r\n  and reverse the December 1997 order holding Father in contempt. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFather next challenges the April \r\n  1999 order holding him in contempt. We vacate this order for lack of jurisdiction. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGenerally, serving notice of appeal \r\n  divests the lower court of jurisdiction over the order appealed, except for \r\n  matters not affected by the appeal. Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 311, \r\n  486 S.E.2d 750, 761 (1997); Rule 205, SCACR (\"Upon the service of the notice \r\n  of appeal, the appellate court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal \r\n  . . . . Nothing in these Rules shall prohibit the lower court . . . from proceeding \r\n  with matters not affected by the appeal.\"). However, an order ruling a person \r\n  in civil contempt is not automatically stayed by filing an appeal. Decker \r\n  v. Smith, 322 S.C. 212, 214, 471 S.E.2d 459, 461 (1995). The December 1997 \r\n  contempt order at issue here, however, clearly involved criminal contempt. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEven though Father could avoid imprisonment \r\n  by paying the fifty dollar per day sanction, Father could not expunge the sanction \r\n  itself. Therefore, the clear purpose for the fine was \"to punish for disobedience \r\n  of [the court's] orders,\" thereby amounting to a criminal contempt sanction. \r\n  See Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 111, 502 S.E.2d 86, 88 (1998); \r\n  see also Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 633 (1988) (\"An unconditional \r\n  penalty is criminal in nature because it is 'solely and exclusively punitive \r\n  in nature.' \"(internal citation omitted)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMoreover, the December 1997 order \r\n  was based on the August 1997 order and, therefore, it strains credulity to argue \r\n  the August 1997 order was not \"affected\" by appealing the December 1997 order. \r\n  Accordingly, any argument that the April 1999 order could still enforce the \r\n  August 1997 order despite Father's appeal is without merit. Because Father timely \r\n  appealed the December 1997 order the family court lacked jurisdiction to issue \r\n  the April 1999 order holding Father in contempt. See Hooper v. Rockwell, \r\n  334 S.C. 281, 291, 513 S.E.2d 358, 364 (1999) (noting a contempt order is immediately \r\n  appealable). \r\n   \r\nII. Visitation \r\n  and Child Support Proceedings \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFather asserts the family court erred \r\n  in failing to grant his motion for a continuance on the action to modify his \r\n  visitation schedule and Mother's counterclaim for increased child support. Specifically, \r\n  Father asserts he was prejudiced by the court's denial of his motion for continuance \r\n  because the court based its award of attorney fees, in part, on the unresolved \r\n  contempt actions. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDeciding whether to grant or deny \r\n  a motion for continuance rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. \r\n  Jackson, 326 S.C. at 309, 486 S.E.2d at 760. We will not reverse the \r\n  trial court without a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough the family court's order \r\n  specifically stated that the amount of the award \"does not include the attorneys \r\n  fees incurred in connection with [Father's] appeals, or any amounts previously \r\n  awarded to [Mother],\" the order also stated that the award of attorney fees \r\n  was based, in part, on Father's \"misconduct and behavior through the course \r\n  of this case.\" The order also suspended Father's visitation rights until Father \r\n  resolved the bench warrant stemming from the contempt proceedings. Furthermore, \r\n  in denying Father's motion for reconsideration, the court stated the attorney \r\n  fees award was justified because \"[Father] unreasonably refused to follow the \r\n  previous Orders of this Court.\" Despite the family court's attempt to distinguish \r\n  the contempt proceedings from the underlying action, we find the prior contempt \r\n  proceedings infected the action for modified visitation and increased child \r\n  support to the extent that the family court's failure to grant a continuance \r\n  amounted to an abuse of discretion. In light of our holding in Part I, that \r\n  Father did not unreasonably refuse to follow prior court orders or thwart court \r\n  authority, the trial judge's refusal to grant a continuance severely prejudiced \r\n  Father and warrants reversal. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause we find the family court \r\n  abused its discretion in denying Father's motion for a continuance, we reverse \r\n  and remand the family court's order altering visitation, increasing Father's \r\n  child support obligations, and awarding Mother attorney fees. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court is \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n1.  \r\nBased on our resolution of \r\nthe contempt issue, we express no opinion regarding the family court's jurisdiction \r\nto assess fines in this amount. See generally S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 \r\n(Supp. 1999) (prohibiting a family court from imposing a fine for contempt in \r\nexcess of $1500). \r\n2.  While \r\n  we express no opinion on the validity of the August 1997 order, because Father \r\n  failed to appeal it, we note several reasons to question the court's authority \r\n  to issue such an order. First, a \r\n  party may not ordinarily receive relief not contemplated in the pleadings. Gainey \r\n  v. Gainey, 279 S.C. 68, 70, 301 S.E.2d 763, 764 (1983). Here, Mother's initial \r\n  motion to compel sought an order requiring Father to file a financial declaration, \r\n  but failed to request an order compelling Father to answer interrogatories or \r\n  produce documents. In fact, the discovery responses were not even due at the \r\n  time of the motion to compel hearing. Consequently, the discovery issues were \r\n  not properly before the family court. Second, due process requires that a litigant \r\n  be placed on notice of the issues which the court will consider to afford the \r\n  litigant an opportunity to be heard. Abbott v. Gore, 304 S.C. 116, 119, \r\n  403 S.E.2d 154, 156 (Ct. App. 1991). Because Father never received notice that \r\n  at the hearing he would be required to address discovery issues relating to \r\n  the interrogatories and document request, and the family court is limited by \r\n  the scope of due process, the court's order treads perilously close to violating \r\n  fundamental notions of due process. See Abbott, 304 S.C. at \r\n  119, 403 S.E.2d at 156\r\n. Third, a family court is \r\nstatutorily prohibited from imposing a contempt sanction exceeding $1500. S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 1999). Fourth, there is no basis for concluding the \r\nminor deficiencies in Father's discovery responses authorized imposing a fifty \r\ndollar per day penalty as a discovery sanction. See Rule 37, SCRCP (providing \r\nfor a court to award a party reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, caused \r\nby the failure to answer discovery requests). \r\n3.  \r\n  Rule 37, SCRCP, applies to family courts. Rule 2, SCRFC. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3173","title":"Antley v.

Antley filed this public policy tort and wrongful discharge action against \r\n  William M. Shepherd and Aiken County. All parties moved for summary judgment \r\n  which the trial court granted in favor of Shepherd and Aiken County. Antley \r\n  appeals. We affirm.  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nIn December 1993, Shepherd, the Aiken \r\n  County Administrator, appointed Antley as Aiken County's tax assessor. As tax \r\n  assessor, Antley had the sole responsibility of valuing property and had the \r\n  authority to appeal disapprovals or modifications of any appraisals made by \r\n  her. On September 13, 1996, in accordance with her statutory authority, Antley \r\n  filed an appeal to the Administrative Law Judges Division (ALJD) from a decision \r\n  of the Aiken County Board of Assessment Appeals (the board) regarding property \r\n  owned by William and Eleanor Manfredi. The appeal involved what portion of the \r\n  Manfredis' property should be considered residential property versus commercial \r\n  property for taxation purposes. According to Antley, Mr. Manfredi had refused \r\n  to provide documentation identifying what portion of the property was used for \r\n  residential purposes. \r\n   \r\nOn September 27, 1996, Shepherd issued \r\n  a memorandum to Antley which stated, in part: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPrior to any result of the board \r\n  hearing being appealed by the County to the State, such cases will be presented \r\n  to me for review and discussion. Unless there is a cognizant reason to proceed \r\n  to the State, we will accept the decision of our board. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a memorandum dated October 4, \r\n  1996, Shepherd inquired about the Manfredi appeal and reiterated his position \r\n  that the County would not pursue an appeal unless cognizant reasons existed. \r\n  Additionally, he stated:  \r\n   \r\nI do not intend that we will pursue \r\n  any appeal just to argue for a valuation. I expect that the action of the Board \r\n  will constitute a final judgment as far as the County is concerned.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the same letter to Antley, Shepherd \r\n  indicated that he told Mr. Manfredi that if an appeal had been initiated, the \r\n  County would rescind it. \r\n   \r\nOn October 10, 1996, Shepherd wrote \r\n  Mr. Manfredi and assured him that the County would not appeal the board's decision \r\n  in his case. He explained: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn consideration of the problems \r\n  associated with the most recent reassessment and the vesting of the appel[l]ate \r\n  authority in the Board of Adjustment Appeals, it is deemed to be in the best \r\n  interests of Aiken County to accept the decisions of that Board. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nConcerned about who had the authority \r\n  to appeal the board's decisions, Antley sought advice from the County Attorney. \r\n  On October 10, 1996, the County Attorney wrote Antley and informed her that \r\n  as tax assessor, she was the only county official with authority to appeal the \r\n  board's decisions. He cautioned Antley, however, that under the Aiken County \r\n  Code, the assessor served at the administrator's pleasure and that Antley risked \r\n  disciplinary action by refusing to follow Shepherd's policies. On October 16, \r\n  1996, Antley informed the administrative law judge assigned to the Manfredi \r\n  case that Shepherd had directed her to withdraw the Manfredi appeal and not \r\n  to appeal future decisions of the board. She advised the judge that she did \r\n  not wish to withdraw the case and instead sought a continuance to resolve the \r\n  question of Shepherd's authority to direct her appeals. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 18, 1996, Antley wrote \r\n  a memorandum to Shepherd concerning his newly-adopted policy on appeals. She \r\n  explained to Shepherd that Mr. Manfredi's refusal to provide her with information \r\n  about his property necessitated her appeal. Antley assured Shepherd she did \r\n  not intend to file frivolous appeals and alerted him that \"because of the confusion \r\n  involved,\" she requested a continuance in the Manfredi case. Antley ended her \r\n  memo with the following statement: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs a public servant for almost 18 \r\n  years, I have always taken my legal duties and responsibilities very seriously. \r\n  I have never relinquished them and I can do no less now. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a letter dated October 21, 1996, \r\n  Shepherd attempted to \"clarify\" his directive by advising Antley: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nYou are NOT to initiate any appeal \r\n  of a decision of the Aiken County Board of Appeals. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nShepherd explained that after conferring \r\n  with the County Council he decided the County would accept the board's decisions. \r\n  He stated that both he and the Council trusted the board's wisdom and had \"no \r\n  desire or intention to question their decisions by continuing cases that might \r\n  not have been adjudicated in the County's favor.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 28, 1996, Shepherd asked \r\n  Antley whether she had dismissed the Manfredi appeal. Antley answered that she \r\n  had not and informed him of her belief that his directive violated state law \r\n  by usurping her statutory authority. Shepherd disagreed and again directed her \r\n  to dismiss the Manfredi appeal. Upon her refusal to do so, Shepherd advised \r\n  Antley he deemed her refusal a serious act of insubordination and orally terminated \r\n  her employment. Shepherd then wrote Antley a letter confirming his termination \r\n  of her employment for insubordination. Shepherd based his decision on Antley's \r\n  refusal to follow the directive in his October 21 letter. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAntley filed this suit against the \r\n  County and Shepherd individually. In her second amended complaint, Antley asserted \r\n  she was mandated by state law to file meritorious appeals from board decisions \r\n  and thus Shepherd's directive that she not file any appeals from board decisions \r\n  placed her \"in a position of being required to disobey the law\" as a condition \r\n  of her employment. She asserted this requirement constituted a public policy \r\n  tort and her termination for refusing to follow the directive was wrongful. \r\n  The County and Shepherd answered, claiming Antley was an at-will employee fired \r\n  for cause. \r\n   \r\nThe parties stipulated to certain \r\n  facts and filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In a memorandum supporting \r\n  her motion for summary judgment, Antley asserted new grounds for her causes \r\n  of action. Specifically, she argued that the County attempted to usurp her statutory \r\n  authority, that the County Council's policy was developed in violation of the \r\n  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and that the evidence created at least an \r\n  inference that Shepherd acted outside the scope of his authority, with actual \r\n  malice, or with the intent to harm her. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe circuit court granted Shepherd's \r\n  and the County's motion for summary judgment finding that Antley was an insubordinate \r\n  at-will employee and Shepherd was within his authority to terminate her. As \r\n  to her public policy claim, the court reasoned that because state statute permitted, \r\n  rather than required, her to file appeals, Shepherd's directive did not require \r\n  Antley to violate the law. Regarding her FOIA argument, the court questioned \r\n  whether she properly raised that issue. In any event, the court concluded there \r\n  was no evidence of a FOIA violation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAntley filed a motion to alter or \r\n  amend the court's judgment, maintaining it misconstrued her public policy argument. \r\n  She asserted that her public policy claim was that the County and Shepherd had \r\n  usurped her statutory authority by requiring her to abdicate to Shepherd her \r\n  authority to file appeals. Antley also reasserted her FOIA argument and noted \r\n  the court failed to address the issue of Shepherd's individual liability. Finally, \r\n  Antley argued even if the County and Shepherd did not violate state law by usurping \r\n  her authority, the evidence demonstrated she refused to abdicate her authority \r\n  because of her good faith belief she was being asked to violate the law, and \r\n  thus summary judgment was inappropriate. The court denied Antley's motion, stating \r\n  \"[h]aving gone over this case numerous times, the court still finds that the \r\n  defendants were permitted to take the actions taken and that there is no genuine \r\n  issue of material fact as to any issue that would allow the recovery [Antley] \r\n  seeks.\" \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is proper only where \r\n  \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining whether summary judgment \r\n  is proper, the court must construe all ambiguities, inferences, and conclusions \r\n  arising from the evidence against the moving party. Byers v. Westinghouse \r\n  Elec. Corp., 310 S.C. 5, 425 S.E.2d 23 (1992). When the evidentiary facts \r\n  are not in dispute but there is a dispute about the inferences or conclusions \r\n  to be drawn from those facts, summary judgment is not proper. Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n  County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Public \r\n  Policy \r\n   \r\nAntley first argues the trial court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment to the County on her public policy tort claim. \r\n  She maintains she was required to abdicate her statutory authority to appeal \r\n  valuations in violation of public policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"Generally, an at-will employee may \r\n  be terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason, with or without cause.\" \r\n  Stiles v. American Gen. Life Ins. Co., 335 S.C. 222, 224, 516 S.E.2d \r\n  449, 450 (1999). Our supreme court, however, has recognized two important exceptions \r\n  to that rule. First, an employee may have a cause of action where his or her \r\n  at-will status has been altered by the promulgation of an employee handbook. \r\n  Small v. Springs Industries, Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987). \r\n  Second, an employee may have a cause of action where the termination of employment \r\n  violates a clear mandate of public policy. Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, \r\n  Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe public policy exception adopted \r\n  in Ludwick provides a tort cause of action for wrongful discharge where \r\n  an at-will employee's discharge \"constitutes [a] violation of a clear mandate \r\n  of public policy.\" Id. at 225, 337 S.E.2d at 216. The exception has been \r\n  applied to situations where an employer requires an employee to violate a criminal \r\n  law, and situations where the reason for the employee's termination was itself \r\n  a violation of the criminal law, but it has never been limited to such situations. \r\n  Garner v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., 318 S.C. 223, 456 S.E.2d 907 (1995). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn evaluating whether Antley states \r\n  a valid claim under the public policy exception, it is necessary to understand \r\n  the nature of the relationship between her, Shepherd, and the County and to \r\n  understand what duties she was authorized to carry out as tax assessor.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAiken County functions under the \r\n  Council-Administrator form of government. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-10(b) (1986). \r\n  Under this form of government, the county administrator is responsible for the \r\n  employment and discharge of employees within the council's control and is responsible \r\n  for the administration of all departments the council is authorized to control. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-620 (1986); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-630(8) (1986). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAll counties are required to have \r\n  a full-time tax assessor who is responsible for listing and appraising real \r\n  property. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-90 (Supp. 1999). The assessor is responsible \r\n  for the operations of her office and is the sole person responsible for valuation \r\n  of property. Id. Values set by the assessor may only be altered by the \r\n  assessor \"or by legally constituted appellate boards, the [state tax] commission, \r\n  or the courts.\" Id. Should the values set by the assessor be altered, \r\n  he or she has the right to appeal any modification or disapproval of any appraisal \r\n  made. Id. In fact, the assessor is the only county official with standing \r\n  to appeal a board decision to the ALJD. See generally S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2540(a) (Supp. 1999) (within 30 days of the board's decision, property \r\n  taxpayer or county assessor may appeal an assessment made by the board). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, Shepherd first \r\n  directed Antley to consult with him concerning any appeal she wished to make \r\n  from a board decision. He indicated such appeals would not be made unless there \r\n  was a \"cognizant reason to proceed . . . .\" Eventually, Shepherd ordered Antley \r\n  not to appeal any board decision and to withdraw the Manfredi appeal. When Antley \r\n  refused to comply, Shepherd terminated her employment. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAntley argues the County and Shepherd \r\n  attempted to circumvent the law and usurp her statutory authority to file appeals \r\n  by ordering her to refrain from exercising that authority. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code sections 12-37-90 \r\n  and 12-60-2540 gave Antley, as county tax assessor, the right to file \r\n  appeals to the ALJD and established her status as a real party in interest in \r\n  such appeals. These sections thus permitted, but did not require, Antley to \r\n  appeal adverse board decisions. Moreover, nothing in sections 12-37-90 or 12-60-2540 \r\n  gave her the sole discretion in determining which cases to appeal. If \r\n  the General Assembly had intended the assessor's right of appeal to be unfettered \r\n  by the county administrator or county council, it certainly could have provided \r\n  that the decision of whether or not to appeal a board's determination is solely \r\n  that of the assessor.(1) Accordingly, we find \r\n  nothing in the record before us that prevented Shepard or the County Council \r\n  from adopting a policy that defined which cases the county would appeal upon \r\n  receiving an adverse decision from the board. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAntley was appointed, rather than \r\n  elected, to her position. She was thus subject to discharge by Shepherd or the \r\n  County Council. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-30(7) (1986 &amp; Supp. 1999) \r\n  (vesting in the county council the authority to discharge unelected employees); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-630(8) (Supp. 1999) (vesting in county administrator the \r\n  authority to discharge unelected employees); Aiken County Code Â§ 22-31 (stating \r\n  that county tax assessor serves \"at the pleasure of the county administrator\"). \r\n  When Antley refused to withdraw the Manfredi appeal in conformity with Shepherd's \r\n  policy decisions, Shepherd was within his authority to terminate her for insubordination. \r\n  \r\nAntley argues her duty under South \r\n  Carolina Code section 12-37-90(d) to assess and reassess property in a uniform \r\n  manner required her to pursue certain appeals \"to maintain the uniformity of \r\n  countywide assessments.\" The assessor, however, is required to establish uniformity \r\n  in the initial assessment and reassessment decisions; nothing required Antley \r\n  to pursue appeals to maintain uniformity. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Antley argues that even \r\n  if Shepherd's directive did not require her to violate the law, she possessed \r\n  a good faith belief that it did. She maintains her discharge violated public \r\n  policy because of this good faith belief. Because her argument presents a novel \r\n  issue under the public policy exception to at-will employment, Antley argues \r\n  summary judgment was inappropriate. We decline to extend the public policy exception \r\n  to situations where an employee is terminated for refusing to comply with a \r\n  directive which she simply believes would require her to violate the \r\n  law. \r\n   \r\nII. Executive \r\n  Session/Freedom of Information Act \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNext, Antley argues the County's \r\n  policy regarding appeals of board decisions, which she alleges was made during \r\n  an executive county council session, is null and void because it was made in \r\n  violation of the FOIA. Thus, she asserts, any decisions arising from the policy, \r\n  including her termination, are likewise null and void. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, we note that contrary \r\n  to the respondents' argument, this issue is preserved for our review. Although \r\n  Antley did not raise this issue in her complaint, she did raise it in her motion \r\n  for summary judgment without objection. The issue was therefore tried by consent. \r\n  See Marietta Garage, Inc. v. South Carolina Dep't of Pub. Safety, \r\n  337 S.C. 133, 522 S.E.2d 605 (Ct. App. 1999) (issue preserved despite its omission \r\n  from the amended complaint where it was argued on summary judgment without objection). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe cannot discern from the record \r\n  whether the Aiken County's policy regarding appeals was made by the County Council \r\n  in executive session, by the Council and Shepherd in informal discussions, or \r\n  by Shepherd alone. The answer is unimportant, however, because the FOIA is designed \r\n  to protect the public in general, not any individual in particular. See \r\n  Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 408 S.E.2d 219 (1991) (purpose of FOIA \r\n  is to protect the public from secret government activity). Whether the initial \r\n  policy was developed in violation of the FOIA is irrelevant to the question \r\n  of whether Antley's termination violated public policy.(2) \r\n  If the Council took action in violation of the FOIA, Antley could have filed \r\n  an action under that act seeking disclosure. She cannot, however, rely on the \r\n  alleged FOIA violations to seek damages for her termination. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Shepherd's \r\n  Individual Liability \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn her final issue, Antley argues \r\n  the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Shepherd in his individual \r\n  capacity because the record contained evidence which permitted the inference \r\n  that Shepherd acted outside the scope of his employment with actual malice and \r\n  intent to harm Antley. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, we note because Antley's \r\n  termination did not violate public policy or give rise to a wrongful discharge \r\n  claim, her suit against Shepherd, like her suit against the County, cannot prevail. \r\n  In any event, construing the evidence and its inferences against Shepherd, there \r\n  is no triable issue regarding his conduct. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides \"the \r\n  exclusive remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity. \r\n  An employee . . . who commits a tort while acting within the scope of his official \r\n  duty is not liable therefor . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(a) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  A governmental employee may be only sued individually if \"it is proved that \r\n  the employee's conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that \r\n  it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving \r\n  moral turpitude.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. 1999).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nShepherd was acting within the scope \r\n  of his administrative duties in informing Antley of the policy she now challenges. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-620 (1986). Furthermore, he was acting within the scope \r\n  of his office when he terminated Antley for insubordination. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 4-9-630(8) (1986). Contrary to Antley's assertions, the record reflects Shepherd \r\n  exercised patience with Antley, giving her numerous opportunities to comply \r\n  with his directive. Nothing in this record creates any genuine issue of material \r\n  fact that Shepherd acted with actual malice or intent to harm Antley. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  For example, \r\n  Section 12-37-90(h) establishes that the assessor is the \"sole person responsible \r\n  for the valuation of real property,\" thereby protecting the assessor's valuation \r\n  decisions from county interference. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-90(h) (Supp. 1999) \r\n  (emphasis added). \r\n2.  Antley does \r\n  not argue she was terminated for exposing FOIA violations committed by the County \r\n  Council or Shepherd. Moreover, the record does not support such an argument \r\n  in this case. Accordingly, we do not address whether such a termination would \r\n  give rise to a cause of action under the public policy exception. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3174","title":"Hatchell-Freeman v.

The \r\n  final hearing granting the divorce was held September 27, 1996. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decedent died intestate on October \r\n  7, 1996. Three days later, on October 10, 1996, the family court signed the \r\n  order granting the divorce, and the order was filed the next day.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn December 18, 1996, the decedent's \r\n  father, Gilbert Freeman, filed a petition seeking appointment as personal representative \r\n  of the decedent's estate. He did not list Hatchell-Freeman as an intestate heir \r\n  of the estate or as a person having a prior or equal right of appointment. The \r\n  probate court granted his petition for appointment on December 27, 1996.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn January 22, 1997, Hatchell-Freeman \r\n  filed her notice of election by a surviving spouse to take her intestate share(1) \r\n  as well as a petition for appointment as personal representative of the estate. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAfter a hearing on Hatchell-Freeman's \r\n  petitions, the probate court held that because the decedent died three days \r\n  before the signing of the divorce decree, Hatchell-Freeman and the decedent \r\n  were still married at his death and she was therefore entitled to her share \r\n  of decedent's estate. It found her petition for appointment was effectively \r\n  seeking removal of Freeman as personal representative. Because the court found \r\n  that Hatchell-Freeman had adequate time to file her petition before it appointed \r\n  Freeman personal representative, it denied Hatchell-Freeman's petition for appointment. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nBoth parties appealed to the circuit \r\n  court. The circuit court held Hatchell-Freeman was the wife of the decedent \r\n  at the time of his death and that she should not be estopped from claiming the \r\n  relationship of husband and wife. The circuit court affirmed the probate court's \r\n  decision regarding Hatchell-Freeman's entitlement to her elective share. Finally, \r\n  it found that as the decedent's wife, Hatchell-Freeman had a superior right \r\n  to serve as personal representative of the estate. Accordingly, it removed Freeman \r\n  as personal representative and appointed Hatchell-Freeman. Freeman appeals. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFreeman asserts Hatchell-Freeman \r\n  is estopped from denying the validity of the divorce decree. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe probate code provides that in \r\n  determining whether a person is a surviving spouse, a divorce or annulment is \r\n  not final until signed by the court and filed in the office of the clerk of \r\n  court. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-802(c) (1987). In addition, the supreme court has \r\n  held \"that an action for divorce, being purely personal, terminates on the death \r\n  of either spouse, and where the action for divorce is commenced, and one of \r\n  the parties dies thereafter but before the entry of a final decree, the action \r\n  abates and the jurisdiction of the court to proceed with the action is terminated.\" \r\n  Louthian and Merritt, P.A. v. Davis, 272 S.C. 330, 332, 251 S.E.2d 757, \r\n  758 (1979). \r\n   \r\nFreeman relies on the rule that a \r\n  spouse who procures a divorce decree by a court lacking jurisdiction is estopped \r\n  from collaterally attacking the decree where only property rights arising out \r\n  of the marriage are involved. See 24 Am. Jur.2d Divorce and Separation \r\n  Â§ 467 (1998). The supreme court recognized this rule in Ex parte Nimmer, \r\n  212 S.C. 311, 320, 47 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1948). Generally, the cases following \r\n  this rule involve estoppel of the party who obtained a foreign divorce decree \r\n  from challenging the validity based on personal jurisdiction. See Annotation, \r\n  Estoppel to Assert Invalidity of Decree of Divorce for Lack of Domicile at \r\n  the Divorce Forum or Failure to Obtain Jurisdiction of Person, 153 A.L.R. \r\n  941 (1944). However, we do not find that principle analogous to the facts here. \r\n  Hatchell-Freeman did not choose a court that lacked jurisdiction when she sought \r\n  a divorce from the decedent; rather the intervening death of the decedent deprived \r\n  the family court of jurisdiction. Therefore, we decline to find Hatchell-Freeman \r\n  estopped from challenging the validity of the divorce decree, signed after the \r\n  death of her husband, simply because she initiated the divorce action and her \r\n  attorney filed the final order.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFreeman also argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in removing him from serving as the personal representative of the estate. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n   \r\nFreeman correctly asserts Hatchell-Freeman \r\n  did not file a petition seeking his removal or establish grounds for removal \r\n  to the circuit court. Instead, she filed her own petition for appointment. The \r\n  probate code provides for objection to an appointment in formal proceedings. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-203(b) (Supp. 1999) (providing objection \r\n  to appointment can be made only in formal proceedings). Although the probate \r\n  court termed the proceeding an action for removal, it was in fact a contest \r\n  of the parties' petitions for appointment. Therefore, the circuit court could \r\n  review both \r\npetitions to determine which party \r\n  had priority for appointment according to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-203 (a) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n   \r\nAccording to the probate code, the \r\n  surviving spouse has priority for appointment as personal representative for \r\n  intestacy proceedings. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-203(a)(4) (Supp. 1999).(2) \r\n  As the surviving spouse, Hatchell-Freeman had priority for appointment over \r\n  Freeman, who is not entitled to priority on any basis provided in the code.(3) \r\n  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in appointing Hatchell-Freeman \r\n  personal representative of the estate. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concurring.\r\n1.  \r\nHatchell-Freeman originally \r\nfiled a petition for election by a surviving spouse to take an elective share, \r\nand the probate and circuit court orders refer to Hatchell-Freeman's share in \r\nthe decedent's estate as a \"spousal elective share;\" however, the decedent actually \r\ndied intestate and thus Hatchell-Freeman inherits from the decedent's estate under \r\nthe order of intestate descent and devise. \r\n2.  The \r\n  probate code provides for priority for appointment in the following order: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) the person with priority \r\n  as determined by a probated will including a person nominated by a power conferred \r\n  in a will;\r\n(2) the surviving spouse \r\n  of the decedent who is a devisee of the decedent;\r\n(3) other devisees of the \r\n  decedent;\r\n(4) the surviving spouse \r\n  of the decedent;\r\n(5) other heirs of the \r\n  decedent regardless of whether the decedent died intestate and determined as \r\n  if the decedent died intestate (for the purposes of determining priority under \r\n  this item, any heirs who could have qualified under items (1), (2), (3), and \r\n  (4) of subsection (a) are treated as having predeceased the decedent);\r\n(6) forty-five days after \r\n  the death of the decedent, any creditor;\r\n(7) four months after the \r\n  death of the decedent, upon application by the South Carolina Department of \r\n  Revenue, a person suitable to the court.\r\n(8) Unless a contrary intent \r\n  is expressed in the decedent's will, a person with priority under subsection \r\n  (a) may nominate another, who shall have the same priority as the person making \r\n  the nomination, except that a person nominated by the testator to serve as personal \r\n  representative or successor personal representative shall have a higher priority \r\n  than a person nominated pursuant to this item. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-203(a) \r\n(Supp. 1999).  \r\n3.  Freeman \r\n  was never a duly appointed personal representative because he failed to give \r\n  notice to Hatchell-Freeman as an intestate heir of the estate or as a person \r\n  having a prior or equal right of appointment under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-301(a)(1)(ii) \r\n  (Supp. 1999); nor does Freeman claim to be a creditor of the estate, and is, \r\n  therefore, not entitled to priority under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-203(a)(6) (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3175","title":"Williams, et al. v.

Mullins, Bob Williamson, and Richard Powell appeal the Horry \r\n  County Master-in-Equity's findings that (1) the Christian Church of North Myrtle \r\n  Beach is an independent and autonomous congregational church and (2) the special \r\n  congregational meeting held in June 1998 was legal and effected the removal \r\n  of the former trustees and the retention of Darrell Hall as minister. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1994, several members of the Grand \r\n  Strand Christian Church decided to build another congregation in the Horry County/Georgetown \r\n  area. These members, Dale Henry, Joel Wilson, Danny Banks, J.W. Mullins, E. \r\n  Richard Powell, and James Phillip Spruill, formed a committee. They purchased \r\n  land, erected a building, obtained financing, and staffed the congregation. \r\n  The church was named the Christian Church of North Myrtle Beach. The men referred \r\n  to themselves as trustees.\r\n\r\nIn June 1996, the trustees hired Darrell \r\nHall to serve as the minister/evangelist of the church. Approximately two years \r\nlater, in May 1998, the trustees met with Hall and voted to dismiss him. At the \r\ntime only two of the five trustees were members of the church.(1) \r\n\r\n The trustees made the decision to \r\n  terminate Hall without consulting the congregation. \r\n   \r\nThe next Sunday, Hall informed the \r\n  congregation of his dismissal. In response, the congregation decided to hold \r\n  a congregational meeting following the June 14th Sunday worship service. \r\n  Dick Powell and Bob Williamson, the two trustees who were also church members, \r\n  were present at the meeting. The other trustees were not notified and were not \r\n  present. Neither of the trustees present at the meeting made any objection. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\nIn all, thirty-six members of the \r\n  congregation were present at the meeting. The members voted twenty-eight to \r\n  zero to retain Hall as minister. Two ballots were unmarked and six ballots were \r\n  not used. The congregation also voted to replace the trustees. In their place, \r\n  Greg Williams, Bill Wines, and Charles Abercrombie were elected as new trustees.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 18th, the former \r\n  trustees sent Hall a letter dismissing him and requesting he return his keys \r\n  to the church. On June 20th, Hall discovered the church's locks had \r\n  been changed and notices posted on the church doors. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHall subsequently filed this action \r\n  seeking a declaratory judgment that he was the duly-selected minister of the \r\n  church and Williams, Wines, and Abercrombie were the duly-elected trustees. \r\n  Hall also sought to enjoin the former trustees from controlling the church building \r\n  and bank accounts or in any way interfering with the operation of the church. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn July 1998, a circuit judge granted \r\n  Hall a temporary injunction, maintaining his position as minister and enjoining \r\n  the former trustees from interfering with his ministerial duties. In October \r\n  1998, the master issued a final order declaring Hall the duly-selected minister/evangelist \r\n  of the church and Williams, Wines, and Abercrombie the duly-elected trustees. \r\n  The order further enjoined Appellants from interfering in any way with the use \r\n  of church property. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy initiating this action, Respondents \r\n  primarily sought a declaratory judgment supported by accompanying injunctive \r\n  relief.(3) Actions for injunctive relief are \r\n  equitable in nature. Gambrell v. Schriver, 312 S.C. 354, 356, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  393, 394 (Ct. App. 1994). In an action in equity tried by a master with direct \r\n  appeal to the court of appeals, this court may take its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. See Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976); see also Tiger, Inc. \r\n  v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989). However, \r\n  we will not disregard the master's findings, who was in a better position to \r\n  evaluate the witnesses's credibility. Tiger, Inc., 301 S.C. at 237, 391 \r\n  S.E.2d at 543. \r\n   \r\nOur review is tempered by the general \r\n  principles that guide civil courts called upon to resolve church disputes. Specifically, \r\n  the supreme court has noted that: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) courts may not engage in resolving \r\n  disputes as to religious law, principle, doctrine, discipline, custom, or administration; \r\n  (2) courts cannot avoid adjudicating rights growing out of civil law; [and] \r\n  (3) in resolving such civil law disputes, courts must accept as final and binding \r\n  the decisions of the highest religious judicatories as to religious law, principle, \r\n  doctrine, discipline, custom, and administration.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPearson v. Church of God, \r\n  325 S.C. 45, 52-53, 478 S.E.2d 849, 853 (1996) (internal footnotes omitted). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nA. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAppellants first argue the master \r\n  erred in finding the church was an independent, autonomous, congregational church. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes at least \r\n  two forms of governance for churches: (1) hierarchical; and (2) congregational. \r\n  See Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas v. Greater \r\n  Fuller Tabernacle Fire Baptized Holiness Church, 323 S.C. 418, 421-22, 475 \r\n  S.E.2d 767, 769 (Ct. App. 1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA congregational church is an independent \r\n  organization, self-governing in its religious functions. A hierarchical church, \r\n  on the other hand, may be defined as one organized as a body with other churches \r\n  having similar faith and doctrine with a common ruling convocation or ecclesiastical \r\n  head.  \r\n   \r\nId. (internal citation omitted). \r\n  Thus, in a congregational church, the congregation is the highest religious \r\n  judicatory. See Pearson, 325 S.C. at 53 n.4, 478 S.E.2d at 853 \r\n  n.4. \r\n   \r\nDespite the two generally recognized \r\n  forms of church governance, Appellants contend they created a \"nonindependent, \r\n  nonautonomous Christian church,\" which, unlike other Christian churches, would \r\n  be solely governed by trustees. They argue their intent as founders was that \r\n  the church be held in trust, governed by the trustees, with the trustees as \r\n  the sole owners of church property. Assuming without deciding that a church \r\n  may be properly held in trust and governed by trustees, we do not believe Appellants \r\n  established that a trust existed in this case. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor a trust to exist certain elements \r\n  must be present, including a declaration creating the trust, a trust res, \r\n  and designated beneficiaries. Whetstone v. Whetstone, 309 S.C. 227, 231-32, \r\n  420 S.E.2d 877, 879 (Ct. App. 1992). The declaration of trust must be in writing \r\n  where trust property includes realty. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe agree with the master that the \r\n  record does not establish the existence of a trust. First, the \"trustees\" have \r\n  not produced an executed trust agreement. Second, the church's property is deeded \r\n  to the church, not to the trustees. Therefore there is no trust res. \r\n  Third, there are no designated beneficiaries. Fourth, Philip Spruill, one of \r\n  the church's founders, testified the founders originally intended to create \r\n  a trust but \"this trust was never qualified and it never became a reality.\" \r\n  Therefore, we conclude the master correctly found Appellants failed to establish \r\n  the existence of a trust.(4) Under these circumstances, \r\n  without the formation of a governing trust and in view of South Carolina case \r\n  law which indicates there are basically two forms of governance for churches, \r\n  we find the record supports the master's decision that the church is congregational. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAppellants argue the June 14, 1998 \r\n  congregational meeting was illegal because it was not announced in accordance \r\n  with the by-laws. Specifically, Appellants contend they were not properly notified \r\n  or invited to the meeting. We find no reversible error. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe by-laws require only members \r\n  to be notified of congregational meetings. Therefore, any lack of notice claimed \r\n  by the former trustees who were not members is without merit. Moreover, the \r\n  two former trustees who were members of the church attended the June 14th meeting \r\n  and failed to object to the holding of the meeting or the vote. Therefore, those \r\n  two appellants cannot be heard to complain on this issue because they were present \r\n  and raised no objection to the proceedings. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs a congregational church, the congregation \r\n  was entitled to make all decisions relative to retention of a minister and election \r\n  of trustees. See Pearson, 325 S.C. at 49, 478 S.E.2d at 851 \r\n  (\"[T]he Supreme Court made it clear that courts must accept in litigation the \r\n  religious determinations of the highest judicatories of a religious organization \r\n  . . . .\" (citing Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, 426 \r\n  U.S. 696, 96 S.Ct. 2372 (1976))). Accordingly, it is not the function of this \r\n  court to disturb the wishes of the congregation and we affirm the master's ruling \r\n  with respect to the validity of the congregation's actions taken at the June \r\n  14th meeting. \r\n   \r\nFor the above reasons, the master's \r\n  judgment is hereby \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  Although \r\n  not raised by Respondents in this case, the nonmember \"trustees\" may lack standing. \r\n  See Brock v. Bennett, 313 S.C. 513, 443 S.E.2d 409 (Ct.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  Benjamin appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the early morning of May 7, 1997, \r\n  at approximately 4:30 a.m., two men armed with a revolver robbed Dodge's convenience \r\n  store in Orangeburg County. Police later identified one of the men as Franklin \r\n  Benjamin and arrested him on May 8. On July 28 an Orangeburg County grand jury \r\n  indicted Benjamin for the armed robbery.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBenjamin was convicted on January \r\n  27, 1998. Because Benjamin had been convicted the previous month of two triggering \r\n  offenses, murder and armed robbery, the trial court sentenced him to life without \r\n  parole as required by section 17-25-45(A), a \"two strikes\" or \"recidivist\" statute. \r\n  See State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999). This \r\n  statute provides in relevant part:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNotwithstanding any other provision \r\n  of law, except in cases in which the death penalty is imposed, upon a conviction \r\n  for a most serious offense as defined by this section, a person must be sentenced \r\n  to a term of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole if that \r\n  person has one or more prior convictions for: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) a most serious offense . . . \r\n  . \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A) (Supp. \r\n  1999). The statute further defines a \"most serious\" offense to include both \r\n  murder and armed robbery. Id. at Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBenjamin's prior murder and armed \r\n  robbery convictions resulted from a similar Calhoun County incident in which \r\n  the victim was shot and killed. Those crimes occurred at approximately 12:30 \r\n  a.m. on May 7, 1997, just four hours earlier than the armed robbery in Orangeburg \r\n  County.  \r\n   \r\nBenjamin argues section 17-25-45(A) \r\n  should not apply in the case at bar because the instant armed robbery was merely \r\n  part of a single continuous crime spree. Benjamin contends the legislative intent \r\n  underlying the statute is to preclude parole \"for offenders who show a propensity \r\n  to commit violent crimes, not within the course of one series of events, but \r\n  over time and in spite of opportunities for reform.\" Thus, Benjamin argues the \r\n  two prior convictions for the Calhoun County incident and the present conviction \r\n  for the Orangeburg County incident should be treated as one conviction for sentencing \r\n  purposes, rather than as separate convictions under section 17-25-45. We disagree. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nSubsection (F) of section 17-25-45 \r\n  states:  \r\n   \r\nFor the purpose of determining a \r\n  prior conviction under this section only, a prior conviction shall mean the \r\n  defendant has been convicted of a most serious or serious offense, as may be \r\n  applicable, on a separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added). \r\n   \r\nWhen the language of a statute is \r\n  plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the application \r\n  of standard rules of statutory interpretation is unwarranted. Paschal v. \r\n  State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); Miller v. \r\n  Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 441 S.E.2d 319 (1994). The statutory terms, therefore, \r\n  must be applied according to their literal meaning. Paschal, 317 S.C. \r\n  at 436, 454 S.E.2d at 892; Holley v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. \r\n  320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994). In such circumstances, this Court simply lacks the \r\n  authority to look for or impose another meaning and may not resort to subtle \r\n  or forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a statute's scope. Paschal, \r\n  317 S.C. at 437, 454 S.E.2d at 892; Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, \r\n  426 S.E.2d 760 (1993).  \r\n   \r\nThe language of section 17-25-45(F) \r\n  is clear. Where a defendant has been convicted for a most serious offense on \r\n  an earlier, separate occasion, it is a \"prior conviction\" as defined by the \r\n  statute's terms. Here, Benjamin does not dispute that he was convicted of murder \r\n  and armed robbery prior to the conviction at issue in this case. The trial court, \r\n  therefore, correctly sentenced him to a term of life without possibility of \r\n  parole. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(G) (Supp. 1999) (\"The provisions \r\n  of Section 17-25-45(A) shall be mandatory.\").  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, a comparison of the \r\n  current version of section 17-25-45 with the statute as it appeared before substantial \r\n  legislative revision in 1995 is instructive. Prior to January 1, 1996, the statute \r\n  stated: \"For the purpose of this section only, a conviction is considered a \r\n  second conviction only if the date of the commission of the second crime occurred \r\n  subsequent to the imposition of the sentence for the first offense.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(1)(B) (Supp. 1995). The General Assembly's amendment supplanting \r\n  this provision with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (Supp. 1999) evidences a purposeful \r\n  intent to apply the statute based on the dates of the relevant convictions, \r\n  rather than the dates on which the underlying offenses were committed. \r\n Benjamin cites State v. Stewart, \r\n  275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 (1980), and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 (1985) for \r\n  the proposition that the court should treat multiple offenses closely connected \r\n  in time as one offense for the purpose of sentencing. Benjamin also asks this \r\n  court to look to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 1999), a statute governing \r\n  the granting of parole to those already convicted and sentenced for a violent \r\n  crime, to determine the legislative intent underlying recidivist statutes. However, \r\n  section 17-25-45(F) is a specific statutory section which governs sentencing \r\n  for defendants with prior convictions for certain crimes, and it clearly states \r\n  \"[f]or the purpose of determining a prior conviction under this section only, \r\n  a prior conviction shall mean the defendant has been convicted of a most serious \r\n  . . . offense . . . on a separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (Supp. 1999) (emphasis added). The language of \r\n  section 17-25-45(F) is plain and unambiguous, and we must give it effect without \r\n  resorting to forced construction.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Benjamin argues his sentence \r\n  under section 17-25-45 violates equal protection because section 24-21-640, \r\n  cited above, \"serves basically the same legislative purpose\" to preclude recidivism \r\n  yet treats repeat offenders \"sentenced under\" it differently for the purpose \r\n  of determining what constitutes a prior offense. Benjamin's argument is not \r\n  preserved for our review. At trial Benjamin argued section 17-25-45 was unconstitutional \r\n  in that it violated state and federal due process provisions, raising neither \r\n  equal protection nor section 24-21-640 to the court. A constitutional argument \r\n  is not preserved for appellate review where an appellant fails to argue the \r\n  constitutional basis for his objection at trial. See State v. Byram, \r\n  326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997); State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 \r\n  S.E.2d 235 (1996); see also State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 \r\n  S.E.2d 845 (1997) (a general objection at trial which does not include the grounds \r\n  for the objection is too vague to preserve an issue for appellate review); State \r\n  v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995) (a party cannot argue one \r\n  ground to the trial court and then argue another ground on appeal).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3177","title":"Jenkins, et al. v.

Jenkins, Joan W. Jenkins and Glenny E. Roberts (collectively \r\n  referred to as Appellants) sued William J. Brown seeking a judgment entitling \r\n  them to possession of a tobacco allotment and damages for trespass due to Brown's \r\n  exercise of dominion and control over the allotment. The trial court granted \r\n  Brown summary judgment holding the Appellants' claims were barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations. The trial court ruled the sale of the allotment to Brown by \r\n  the life estate tenant was a full and unrestricted sale of the allotment and \r\n  was not subject to any rights of the remaindermen. We affirm as modified. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\nJuanita Winburn owned 180.4 acres \r\n  of farmland in Horry County. On March 7, 1986, Winburn sold the property to \r\n  her daughter and son, Joan Jenkins and James H. Winburn, reserving a life estate \r\n  for herself. Cecil D. Jenkins later acquired James Winburn's interest in the \r\n  property. Cecil and Joan Jenkins sold off various parcels of the property. In \r\n  June, 1994, they sold the remaining 137 acres to Roberts. \r\nIn February of 1987, Juanita Winburn \r\n  sold the tobacco allotment assigned to the property to Minnie L. B. Brown, with \r\n  William Brown as the active producer. The transfer was properly documented by \r\n  the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Stabilization and \r\n  Conservation Service (ASCS). Juanita Winburn did not place any restrictions \r\n  or limitations on the conveyance. Moreover, the sales document contained no \r\n  reservations of any type. Brown produced the tobacco crop on other properties. \r\nJuanita Winburn died on October 18, \r\n  1990. The Appellants filed this action in November, 1997. Brown moved for summary \r\n  judgment. In granting Brown's motion, the trial court held the Appellants' claims \r\n  were contractual and applied the three year statute of limitations, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 1999). In addition, the court ruled Juanita Winburn's \r\n  sale of the allotment to Brown was a full and unrestricted transfer. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\nI. Did the trial court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment to Brown based on the statute of limitations? \r\nII. Did the trial court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment to Brown, ruling the Agricultural Adjustment Act and applicable \r\n  federal regulations specifically empower a life tenant to convey full unrestricted \r\n  ownership to a tobacco allotment? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law. Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, Op. No. 25103 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  April 3, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 7); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Summary judgment \r\n  is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable \r\n  to clarify the application of the law. Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, et al., 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999). Even \r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions \r\n  or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Fleming v. Rose, Op. No. 3101 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 17, 2000)(Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 6). \r\nIn determining whether any triable \r\n  issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all \r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party. Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  301 (Ct. App. 1999). Nonetheless, a court cannot ignore facts unfavorable to that party and must determine whether a verdict for the party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts. Bloom v. Ravoira, \r\n  Op. No. 25092 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 20, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 11 \r\n  at 26). \r\nSummary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked. Carolina Alliance, supra. Nevertheless, in the rare case where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper. Bloom, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI. Tobacco Allotment Program \r\nThe federal government, through the \r\n  United States Department of Agriculture, administers a complex regulation of \r\n  the farming industry in our country, which includes the sale of tobacco. As \r\n  part of this regulation, there has existed for many years a tobacco quota system, \r\n  established pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 7 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1281, et seq. \r\n  (1999). This national marketing quota system involves the assignment of tobacco \r\n  allotments to individual farms in the tobacco-growing areas of the United States. \r\n  See 7 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1311-1316 \r\n  (1999). The quota system once involved allotment by acres of tobacco grown, \r\n  but currently individual farms are assigned a certain quota of pounds of tobacco \r\n  which may be sold. \r\nThe tobacco allotment has become \r\n  a basic feature of our nation's farm policy and, due to legislation authorizing \r\n  transfer of allotments separate from the land, a valuable type of intangible \r\n  property. After several decades of federal regulation of farming, tobacco allotments \r\n  and the related marketing quotas are a kind of intangible property, increasingly \r\n  separable from land. David Westfall, Agricultural Allotments as Property, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1180 (1966). \r\nGenerally, flue-cured tobacco quotas \r\n  are issued to a farm based on its past history of growing tobacco. 7 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1313(b) (1999). Section 1314b(g)(1) provides in pertinent part: \r\nThe Secretary [of Agriculture] shall \r\n  permit the owner of any farm \r\n  to which a Flue-cured tobacco allotment or quota is assigned to sell, for use \r\n  on another farm in the same county, all or any part of such allotment or quota \r\n  to any person who is or intends to become an active Flue-cured tobacco producer. \r\n  . . . \r\n7 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1314b(g)(1) (1999) (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\nII. Statute of Limitations \r\nThe Appellants argue the trial court \r\n  erred in holding the statute of limitations had run on their claim. They assert \r\n  the allotment is an interest in land, and as such, the ten year statute of limitations \r\n  applies to their claims. We agree. \r\nThe acreage allotment is made to \r\n  the farm and not the person who owns or operates the farm and therefore runs \r\n  with the land. Lee v. Berry, \r\n  291 S.C. 346, 65 S.E.2d 257 (1951). See also McClung v. Thompson, \r\n  401 F.2d 253, 256 (8th Cir. 1968)(\"Federal and state courts are in \r\n  accord in holding that acreage allotments under the Agricultural Adjustment \r\n  Act and the applicable regulations run with the land.\"); Combustion Eng'g, Inc. v. Norris, 271 S.E.2d 813 (Ga. 1980)(quoting McClung, \r\n  supra); Cothran v. Evans, 289 S.E.2d 398, 400 (N.C. Ct. App. 1982)(\"Tobacco allotments \r\n  do not belong to individuals, but run with the land.\"); Jeffress v. Stith, 402 S.E.2d 14 (Va. 1991)(tobacco allotments run with the land). \r\n  Although the allotments are not vested rights, they are interests in land that \r\n  continue unless abolished by federal statute or regulation. We find the ten \r\n  year statute of limitations applies to the Appellants' claims. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-350 (1977). \r\nThe statute of limitations does not \r\n  begin to run against a remainderman until the death of the life tenant. Stamper v. Avant, 233 S.C. 359, 104 S.E.2d 565 (1958). Thus, the trial court \r\n  erred in holding the Appellants' claims were time-barred. \r\nBrown claims Balkcom v. Cross, 118 S.E.2d 185 (Ga. 1961), governs in the present case. This \r\n  assertion is meritless. We reject the holding in Balkcom \r\n  in view of the historical precept that farm allotments run with the land. \r\nIII. Transfer of Allotment by Life Tenant \r\nThe Appellants profess the trial \r\n  court erred in finding a life tenant could transfer the tobacco allotment to \r\n  a third person. We disagree. \r\nThe Appellants rely on Jeffress v. Stith, 402 S.E.2d 14 (Va. 1991), in support of their contention that \r\n  life tenants may not convey an interest in the allotment greater than their \r\n  interest in the underlying property. In Jeffress, \r\n  the Supreme Court of Virginia addressed whether a life tenant was authorized \r\n  to sell a farm's tobacco allotment and quota entitlement. The Virginia court \r\n  noted the statute and regulations which permit an owner to transfer the tobacco \r\n  quotas did not mention remainder interests in farm properties subject to tobacco \r\n  quotas or define the word \"owner.\" The Jeffress \r\n  court concluded: \r\nIn the absence of further explanation, \r\n  we assume that Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture intended to adopt for \r\n  the word \"owner\" \"its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used. \r\n  'Owner' is a word of general purport, but its primary meaning, as applied to \r\n  land, is 'one who owns the fee and who has the right to dispose of the property.'\" \r\n  Loyola Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Herndon Lumber &amp; Millwork, Inc., 218 Va. 803, 805, 241 S.E.2d \r\n  752, 753 (1978)(citations omitted). This construction is consistent with the \r\n  well-established law in Virginia that a life tenant can transfer no more than \r\n  his life interest. \r\nJeffress, \r\n  402 S.E.2d at 16. \r\nThe Jeffress \r\n  decision is not controlling. Subsequent to the Jeffress \r\n  opinion, the Secretary of Agriculture amended the regulations to define the \r\n  word \"owner.\" See 7 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1314b(f) (1999)(Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe such regulations \r\n  as he considers necessary for carrying out the provisions of this section). \r\n  The regulation as amended provides, \"Owner means one who has legal ownership \r\n  of farmland, including one: . . . (2) Who has a life-estate in the property.\" \r\n  7 CFR Â§ 718.2 (1999). \r\nBrown presented the affidavit of \r\n  Riley Odum, an Agricultural Program Specialist with the ASCS. As part of his \r\n  job duties, Odum interprets and implements statutes and regulations controlling \r\n  the sale of tobacco allotments. Odum summarized the position of the ASCS as \r\n  follows: \r\nTobacco acreage allotments are not \r\n  real property but are Federal statutory entitlements. The sale of such an allotment \r\n  is not governed by real property principles or by State law. Under current regulations \r\n  which are used to implement these statutory provisions, we have concluded that \r\n  only the approval of just the life tenant is necessary to effectuate the sale \r\n  of a tobacco acreage allotment. The proposed rule issued on March 14, 1991 was \r\n  meant to merely reflect in the regulations our current position on this matter; \r\n  it was not the intent of the proposed rule that our existing interpretation \r\n  be changed. \r\nThe Secretary's amendment defining \r\n  the word owner clarified the law. The amendment did not alter substantive rights \r\n  under the tobacco program. According to federal law, Juanita Winburn had the \r\n  right as a life tenant to transfer the full and unrestricted interest to the \r\n  tobacco allotment to Brown, forever severing the allotment from the underlying \r\n  real property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe efficacy of 7 C.F.R. Â§ 718.2 \r\n  imprecates a denegation of real estate doctrines involving fee simple ownership \r\n  as juxtaposed to a life estate interest. Facially, Â§ 718.2 ignores basic precepts \r\n  of common law property principles. The regulation is anathema to property law \r\n  extant in this country. Further, the regulation flies in the face of long-standing \r\n  property law rules in South Carolina. See \r\n  Belue v. Fetner, 251 S.C. 600, \r\n  164 S.E.2d 753 (1968)(holding life tenant could convey no more than his life \r\n  estate). \r\nThe Appellants maintain the regulation \r\n  that should govern in the instant case is 7 CFR Â§ 719.2(q) (1986), the regulation \r\n  in effect at the time of the transfer of the remainder interest to them. The \r\n  1986 regulation provided an owner is \"[a] person who has legal ownership of \r\n  farmland, including a person who is buying farmland under a purchase agreement.\" \r\n  Appellants contend the word \"owner\" should be given its plain and ordinary meaning-one \r\n  who owns the fee and has the right to dispose of the property. According to \r\n  the Appellants, at the time of the transfer, Juanita Winburn, the life tenant, \r\n  did not have the authority to transfer their remainder interest in the tobacco \r\n  allotment; thus, to allow a subsequently modified regulation to retroactively \r\n  divest the Appellants of their interest in the allotment would not meet the \r\n  minimum dictates of due process.\r\n  \r\nAlthough appealing, the argument \r\n  posited by the Appellants is not persuasive. Pursuant to 7 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1313(d), \r\n  \"[f]arm marketing quotas may be transferred only in such manner and subject \r\n  to such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.\" See \r\n  Hart v. Hassell, 250 F. Supp. \r\n  893 (E.D.N.C. 1966)(provision of Â§ 1313 that farm marketing quotas may be transferred \r\n  only in accordance with regulations as may be prescribed by Secretary of Agriculture \r\n  is valid and in furtherance of congressional intent to regulate interstate commerce \r\n  and, accordingly, state law is not determinative as to transferability of tobacco \r\n  allotments). Congress, through Â§ 1313(d), empowered the Secretary of Agriculture, \r\n  through 7 CFR Â§ 718.2 (1999), to control and direct the transfer of \"[f]arm \r\n  marketing quotas\" in every aspect. \r\nThe tobacco allotment program is \r\n  a creation of the federal government, which has absolute authority in prescribing \r\n  the methodology in which the allotments may be transferred. Concomitantly, we \r\n  are mandated to accept the federal government's decision that a life tenant \r\n  has the right to sell the tobacco allotment. The trial court did not err in \r\n  granting Brown summary judgment on this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find the trial court erred in \r\n  applying the three year statute of limitations and determining the Appellants' \r\n  claims were time-barred. The ten year statute of limitations is applicable in \r\n  this case. Furthermore, we hold 7 C.F.R. Â§ 718.2 issued by the Secretary of \r\n  Agriculture is controlling in regard to the \"Flue cured tobacco allotment or \r\n  quota\" involved in the case sub \r\n  judice. We rule Â§ 718.2 permits \r\n  the transfer of the \"Flue cured tobacco allotment or quota\" to a third person \r\n  without the acquiescence or consent of the fee simple remainder interest in \r\n  the farm property. We are cognizant our ruling contravenes long-established \r\n  precedent in the property law arena in this state, but nonetheless come to the \r\n  ineluctable conclusion that we must accede to this federal governmental regulation. \r\n  The trial court properly granted summary judgment to Brown. Accordingly, the \r\n  judgment of the Circuit Court is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3178","title":"Stewart v.

The court found Wife's alleged injuries were not compensable under a separate \"per person\" liability limit of the State Farm policy which provided coverage for Husband's injuries caused by State Farm's insured. We affirm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material facts of this case are \r\n  not in dispute. Husband was involved in an automobile accident with Steven Middleton. \r\n  Wife was not a witness to the accident and was not at the scene. At the time \r\n  of the accident, Middleton had liability coverage with State Farm with limits \r\n  for bodily injury of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife brought \r\n  this declaratory judgment action averring (1) Husband's injuries from the accident \r\n  resulted in damages in excess of $25,000 and (2) Wife \"suffered the loss of \r\n  the society, companionship, services of her husband along with personal injuries \r\n  such as emotional distress, physical injury and illness, financial loss, among \r\n  other losses and has separate and distinct losses apart from those of her husband \r\n  also believed to be in excess of $25,000.00.\" The Stewarts declared the policy \r\n  should be \"interpreted and construed to provide coverage and benefits to both \r\n  Plaintiffs and that both Plaintiffs are separate, injured persons with separate \r\n  claims and are entitled to payment of Defendant's entire 'per incident' coverage \r\n  for the 'bodily injury to two or more persons in any one accident.'\" In her \r\n  affidavit, Wife stated she suffered emotional and physical illness as a result \r\n  of stress from her husband's accident and from caring for his injuries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Farm filed a motion for summary \r\n  judgment as to the Stewarts' claim that Wife is entitled to separate \"per person\" \r\n  coverage under the liability policy in an amount up to $25,000 for her injuries. \r\n  State Farm contended the claim for damages allegedly suffered by Wife was covered \r\n  by the single \"per person\" limit of coverage applicable to the claim of Husband, \r\n  the full amount of which had been previously tendered to the Stewarts by State \r\n  Farm. The Circuit Court granted State Farm's motion finding Wife's \"injuries \r\n  are simply consortium damages arising as a consequence of bodily injury to [Husband],\" \r\n  and are covered under the same single \"per person\" limit of coverage as the \r\n  direct bodily injury damages of Husband. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Did the Circuit Court err in finding Wife's damages are covered only under the same \"per person\" limit as the bodily injuries of Husband? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Did the trial court err in finding there was no coverage for Wife under the State Farm policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Does South Carolina law require that an automobile liability policy provide separate coverage for loss of consortium? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, Op. No. 25103 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  April 3, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 7); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, \r\n  the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Quality Towing, supra. If triable \r\n  issues exist, those issues must go to the jury. Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is not \r\n  appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to \r\n  clarify the application of the law. Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, et al., 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999). All \r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed \r\n  most strongly against the moving party. Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  301 (Ct. App. 1999). Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, \r\n  but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary \r\n  judgment should be denied. Fleming v. Rose, Op. No. 3101 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 17, 2000)(Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the court is required \r\n  to view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a court \r\n  cannot ignore facts unfavorable to that party and must determine whether a verdict \r\n  for the party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts. \r\n  Bloom v. Ravoira, Op. No. 25092 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 20, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 11 at 26). Summary \r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues. Carolina Alliance, supra. Nevertheless, \r\n  in the rare case where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts \r\n  presented, summary judgment is proper. Bloom, \r\n  supra. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. \"PER PERSON\" LIMIT IN POLICY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stewarts argue the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in finding Wife's damages are covered under the same \"per person\" limit \r\n  as the bodily injuries of Husband. We disagree.  \r\nThe Stewarts contend two separate \r\n  policy provisions, when read together, create an ambiguity in the policy regarding \r\n  the availability of separate \"per person\" coverage for Wife. The first provision \r\n  provides that State Farm will: \r\n1. pay damages which an insured becomes \r\n  legally liable to pay because of:\r\na. bodily injury to others.  \r\nThe second provision relied on by \r\n  the Stewarts defines \"bodily injury\" to mean \"bodily injury to a person and \r\n  sickness, disease or death which results from it.\" Reading the language from \r\n  these two provisions together, the Stewarts argue the State Farm policy promises \r\n  to: \r\n1. Pay damages which an insured becomes \r\n  legally liable to pay because of:\r\na. bodily injury to a person and \r\n  sickness, disease or death which results from it to others.  \r\nThe Stewarts assert this reading \r\n  creates an ambiguity in the policy which must be resolved in favor of coverage \r\n  in accordance with Forner v. Butler, \r\n  319 S.C. 275, 460 S.E.2d 425 (Ct. App. 1995), which holds where the words of \r\n  an insurance policy are capable of two reasonable interpretations, that construction \r\n  will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured. They propose that under \r\n  this reading the policy provides separate \"per person\" coverage for those individuals \r\n  who suffer consequential damages as a result of direct bodily injury to someone \r\n  else. According to the Stewarts, \"if a \r\n  person suffers bodily injury as the result of an automobile accident and \r\n  sickness, disease or death results from that bodily injury to others, State Farm will pay for the sickness or disease caused 'to others' \r\n  as well.\" They claim Wife is a \"to others\" who suffered \"sickness and/or disease \r\n  as a result\" of Husband's bodily injury. \r\nInsurance policies are subject to \r\n  general rules of contract construction. B.L.G. Enterprises, Inc. v. First Financial Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  327 (1999). This Court must enforce, not write, contracts of insurance and we \r\n  must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v. Goforth, 312 S.C. 315, 440 S.E.2d 367 (1994). All of the policy provisions \r\n  should be considered, \"and one may not, by pointing out a single sentence or \r\n  clause, create an ambiguity.\" Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 348 \r\n  (1976). The meaning of a particular word or phrase is not determined by considering \r\n  the word or phrase by itself, but by reading the policy as a whole and considering \r\n  the context and subject matter of the insurance contract. Id. \r\nAn insurer's obligation under a policy \r\n  of insurance is defined by the terms of the policy itself, and cannot be enlarged \r\n  by judicial construction. MGC Management of Charleston, Inc. v. Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  820 (Ct. App.1999). Ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must \r\n  be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. \r\n  Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 456 S.E.2d 912 (1995). However, if the intention \r\n  of the parties is clear, courts have no authority to torture the meaning of \r\n  policy language to extend or defeat coverage that was never intended by the \r\n  parties. Id. See also S.S. Newell &amp; Co. v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., 199 S.C. 325, 19 S.E.2d 463 (1942)(rule \r\n  of strict construction against insurer does not apply where language used in \r\n  policy is so plain and unambiguous as to leave no room for construction). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule of strict construction does not authorize a perversion of language or the exercise of inventive powers for the purpose of creating an ambiguity where none exists. S.S. Newell &amp; Co., supra. \r\n  When a contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used. \r\n  B.L.G. Enterprises, supra. \r\n  The judicial function of a court of law is to enforce an insurance contract \r\n  as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of \r\n  judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and unambiguous. \r\n  S.S. Newell &amp; Co., supra. \r\n  It is not the province of the courts to construe contracts broader than the \r\n  parties have elected to make them or to award benefits where none was intended. \r\n  Id. \r\nBy inserting in toto the \r\n  definition of bodily injury into the policy phrase \"bodily injury to others,\" \r\n  the Stewarts are attempting an artificial construction of the policy. Yet, the \r\n  policy must be read as a whole, and the court will not read the clause in isolation. \r\n  See Hall v. Allstate Ins. Co., 284 S.C. 62, 324 S.E.2d 341 (Ct. App. 1984)(in \r\n  determining rights and obligations of parties to insurance contract, policy \r\n  must be read and interpreted as a whole). When read as a whole, State Farm's \r\n  policy unambiguously provides Wife's claim for consequential damages is covered \r\n  under the single \"per person\" limit that covers Husband's bodily injury claim. \r\nThis construction of the policy is \r\n  in keeping with the holdings of Sheffield v. American Indem. Co., 245 S.C. 389, 140 S.E.2d 787 (1965), and Russo v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 455, 513 S.E.2d 127 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  The Court in Sheffield addressed \r\n  the question whether, under an uninsured motorist endorsement which limits the \r\n  liability of the insurer for bodily injury to $10,000 for each person and $20,000 \r\n  for each accident, a husband, whose wife has already recovered $10,000 for her \r\n  bodily injury claim, is entitled to recover further damages under such endorsement \r\n  for loss of consortium and the expenses he has incurred in behalf of his wife. \r\n  Initially, the Court noted the general rule that \"[t]he consequential damages \r\n  sustained by the [spouse] because of the injuries to [the other spouse] are \r\n  'personal injuries' and not 'bodily injuries.'\" Sheffield, \r\n  245 S.C. at 394, 140 S.E.2d at 790. The Court explained: \r\n\"Consequential damages, such as loss \r\n  of consortium, medical and hospital expenses, etc., are generally held not to \r\n  constitute 'bodily injuries' within the meaning of automobile liability policies \r\n  limiting liability to a stated amount for 'bodily injuries' to one person. . \r\n  . . Thus, it is generally held that where a wife has sustained injury by reason \r\n  of the negligent operation of an insured's automobile and has been paid the \r\n  full amount limited by an automobile liability policy in case of 'bodily injury' \r\n  to one person, her husband, who has sustained no physical injury, cannot recover \r\n  from the insurer for consequential damages for loss of consortium, etc., since \r\n  he has sustained no 'bodily injury' within the meaning of the policy.\"\r\n . . .  \r\n\". . . [I]t often happens that there \r\n  are consequential damages, as well as the damages suffered by the injured person \r\n  himself. Thus, where a wife or child is injured, the husband or parent may also \r\n  suffer consequential injuries by reason of liability for hospital and doctor \r\n  bills or for loss of services or consortium. But it has been held that these \r\n  different types of injuries cannot be split up, in order to bring the claim \r\n  within the higher policy limits; they are regarded as essentially injuries to \r\n  one person, so that the lower policy limits applicable to injuries sustained \r\n  by any one person would govern.\" \r\nSheffield, \r\n  245 S.C. at 395, 140 S.E.2d at 790-91. \r\nSimilarly, in Russo, \r\n  this Court recognized \"[l]oss of consortium is a claim for consequential damages \r\n  and is generally excluded from automobile insurance policy definitions of 'bodily \r\n  injuries.'\" Russo, 334 S.C. \r\n  at 457, 513 S.E.2d at 128. Joseph Russo, the insured's husband, sought a declaratory \r\n  judgment that he was entitled to underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits for loss \r\n  of consortium in addition to the insured's recovery. This Court reversed the \r\n  trial court's judgment in Russo's favor and ruled Russo could not recover UIM \r\n  benefits for loss of consortium under a \"per person\" limit separate from the \r\n  insured's recovery for bodily injuries. \r\nIn Sheffield \r\n  and Russo, the spouse of the \r\n  individual who was injured in the accident could not recover insurance benefits \r\n  for consequential damages under a separate \"per person\" limit. Although Russo \r\n  dealt with underinsured motorist coverage and Sheffield \r\n  with uninsured coverage, this Court enunciated \"loss of consortium damages do \r\n  not constitute a bodily injury regardless of the coverage invoked.\" Russo, \r\n  334 S.C. at 458 n.1, 513 S.E.2d at 128 n.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stewarts attempt to distinguish \r\n  Sheffield by arguing the spouse \r\n  in Sheffield sustained no \"physical \r\n  injury\" as Wife has alleged in this action. The phrase \"physical injury\" in \r\n  Sheffield is used only to distinguish \r\n  consequential damages from the direct physical injury to an individual involved \r\n  in the automobile accident. \r\nFurther, our interpretation of the \r\n  policy provisions is consistent with South Carolina statutory law. The statute \r\n  governing basic liability insurance limits coverage to protection against damages \"because of bodily injury.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. 1999). \r\nThe trial court did not err in finding \r\n  Wife cannot recover from State Farm for loss of consortium under a \"per person\" limit separate from Husband's recovery for bodily injuries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her allegation as \r\n  to loss of consortium, Wife averred she suffered emotional distress. Where negligent \r\n  infliction of emotional distress is proven, the damages arising from such tort \r\n  constitute a bodily injury to which a separate \"per person\" limit of insurance \r\n  applies. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Ramsey, 295 S.C. 349, 368 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1988), aff'd, \r\n  297 S.C. 71, 374 S.E.2d 896 (1988). However, coverage is not automatic. Id. \r\n  In order to receive separate liability limits, a claimant bears the burden of \r\n  proving derivative damages under the elements of Kinard v. Augusta Sash &amp; Door Co., 286 S.C. 579, 336 S.E.2d 465 (1985). \r\n  In Kinard, the Supreme Court \r\n  adopted the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress with \r\n  the following elements: \r\n(a) the negligence of the defendant \r\n  must cause death or serious physical injury to another;\r\n(b) the plaintiff bystander must \r\n  be in close proximity to the accident;\r\n(c) the plaintiff and the victim \r\n  must be closely related;\r\n(d) the plaintiff must contemporaneously \r\n  perceive the accident; and\r\n(e) the emotional distress must both \r\n  manifest itself by physical symptoms capable of objective diagnosis and be established \r\n  by expert testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKinard, \r\n  286 S.C. at 582-83, 336 S.E.2d at 467. \r\nRecovery for this type of direct, \r\n  as opposed to consequential, claim for emotional and physical upset is limited \r\n  to bystander recovery. Id. The \r\n  Kinard Court distinguished recovery \r\n  under this type of direct claim from recovery of consequential damages resulting \r\n  from bodily injuries to others by emphasizing the plaintiff in Kinard \"may not recover for the emotional upset arising from her voluntary vigil at \r\n  her daughter's bedside following the accident\" as part of her direct claim of \r\n  injury. Id. at 583 n.3, 336 \r\n  S.E.2d at 467 n.3. \r\nThe elements set forth in Ramsey \r\n  and Kinard for a direct claim \r\n  of emotional and physical upset are not met in the instant case. Wife was not \r\n  a bystander in close proximity to the accident in which Husband was involved \r\n  and did not contemporaneously perceive the accident. Rather, as admitted by \r\n  the Stewarts in their brief, Wife \"became sick as a result of her husband's \r\n  bodily injuries.\" The damages sustained by Wife in this case are consequential \r\n  damages. They do not constitute direct \r\n  bodily injury from the accident. Thus, Wife's damages are covered under the \r\n  same \"per person\" limit as the bodily injuries of her husband, from which Wife's \r\n  injuries resulted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NO AVAILABLE RECOVERY UNDER POLICY FOR WIFE'S CLAIM \r\nThe Stewarts argue the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in determining there was no coverage for Wife under the State Farm policy. \r\n  This issue on appeal incorrectly states the Circuit Court found there was no \r\n  coverage for Wife's claim. On the contrary, the court held Wife's claim was \r\n  covered, but only under the single \"per person\" limit also applicable to Husband's \r\n  claim. The court found coverage, but no available recovery under the policy. \r\n\"No recovery can be had for such \r\n  damages . . . if the insurer has paid the full amount of the limitation fixed \r\n  by the policy to the person injured, recovery in any event being limited to \r\n  the balance between the amount which the insurer has paid, either to the injured \r\n  person or to the one claiming consequential damages, and the amount of the limitation \r\n  fixed by the policy in case of 'bodily injury' to one person.\" Sheffield v. American Indem. Co., 245 S.C. 389, 395, 140 S.E.2d 787, 790 (1965). \r\n  Therefore, the finding of the Circuit Court was not in error. Sheffield \r\n  enunciates a strict policy parameter concerning recovery for damages in this \r\n  scenario. Recovery may be obtained by the individual against the tortfeasor \r\n  without regard to a liability policy analysis. We hasten to add that our ruling \r\n  relates to coverage under the policy at issue and has no \r\n  efficacy in an action by Wife against Steven Middleton individually.\r\n\r\nIII. LOSS OF CONSORTIUM\r\nEffective June 25, 1969, loss of \r\n  consortium received the statutory approbation of the South Carolina General \r\n  Assembly. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (1977), \"[a]ny person may maintain \r\n  an action for damages arising from an intentional or tortious violation of the \r\n  right to the companionship, aid, society and services of his or her spouse. \r\n  Provided, that such action shall not include any damages recovered prior thereto \r\n  by the injured spouse.\"  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, unlike \r\n  that of some other states, loss of consortium is an independent action, not \r\n  derivative. Preer v. Mims, 323 \r\n  S.C. 516, 476 S.E.2d 472 (1996). Although loss of consortium is an independent \r\n  action, case law has held the right of action does not accrue until the loss \r\n  of the services, society and companionship of the spouse has actually occurred, \r\n  which has been defined as the point when the spouse sustained the injuries. \r\n  Id. Loss of consortium arises \r\n  out of the special relationship between a husband and wife. Our Supreme Court, \r\n  in Cook v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., \r\n  196 S.C. 230, 13 S.E.2d 1 (1941), articulated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The companionship and society of \r\n  a wife are not articles of commerce. They cannot be weighed or measured. They \r\n  are not bought and sold, and no expert is competent to testify to their value. \r\n  The consideration upon which they are bestowed is not pecuniary. . . . .\" \r\nCook, \r\n  196 S.C. at 243, 13 S.E.2d at 6-7. \r\nOne spouse's cause of action for \r\n  medical expenses and loss of consortium resulting from negligent injuries to \r\n  the other spouse is a different and distinct cause of action from one maintained \r\n  by the injured spouse. Graham v. Whitaker, \r\n  282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984). Judgment in favor of the defendant in one \r\n  action is not a bar to the other action. Id. \r\n  See also Priester v. Southern Ry. Co., 151 S.C. 433, 149 S.E. 226 (1929)(directed verdict \r\n  against wife, because of her contributory negligence in federal action, did \r\n  not bar husband's cause of action for loss of consortium in state court; the \r\n  causes of action in the two cases are entirely different and distinct, and judgment \r\n  in favor of defendants in an action on one is not a bar to an action on the \r\n  other). In Preer, supra, \r\n  the Court held a loss of consortium claim could have a separate accrual date \r\n  from the claim for direct injury by the other spouse. However, the non-derivative \r\n  nature of the claim, the fact that it extends to both spouses, and the fact \r\n  that different accrual dates possibly exist in no way affects the underlying \r\n  rationale of Sheffield v. American Indem. Co., 245 S.C. 389, 140 S.E.2d 787 (1965), Russo v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 455, 513 S.E.2d 127 (Ct. App. 1999), \r\n  or State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Ramsey, 295 S.C. 349, 368 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1988). The separate nature \r\n  of a loss of consortium claim was known and recognized at the time the three \r\n  controlling cases were decided. \r\nIn support of their contention that \r\n  State Farm is required to provide separate \"per person\" coverage for Wife's \r\n  loss of consortium action, the Stewarts rely on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. \r\n  1999), which provides in pertinent part: \r\nNo automobile insurance policy may \r\n  be issued or delivered in this State to the owner of a motor vehicle or may \r\n  be issued or delivered by an insurer licensed in this State upon any motor vehicle \r\n  then principally garaged or principally used in this State, unless it contains \r\n  a provision insuring the persons defined as insured against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of these motor vehicles . . . (emphasis added). \r\nThe Stewarts posit the Wife's loss \r\n  of consortium and bodily injury damage as a \"liability imposed by law\" on the \r\n  tortfeasor which creates an obligation to pay damages. They further reason Â§ \r\n  38-77-140 requires separate \"per person\" coverage for this loss because Wife's \r\n  consortium claim is a separate and distinct cause of action. \r\nOur analysis is trifurcated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Because South Carolina treats \r\n  loss of consortium as a distinct and separate, not derivative, cause of action, \r\n  must a separate \"per person\" limit apply to such a claim? \r\n(2) Is the failure to require application \r\n  of separate coverage limits a violation of public policy by making a tortfeasor \r\n  uninsured for a loss of consortium claim?\r\nDoes S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 mandate \r\n  separate \"per person\" coverage for Wife's loss of consortium action? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe crux of coverage is not the separateness \r\n  of a loss of consortium claim. Instead, the key is the consequential or direct \r\n  nature of the damages sought. Where the claim is for consequential damages resulting \r\n  from the bodily injuries suffered by the other spouse, rather than direct emotional \r\n  or physical injury inflicted by the tortfeasor, the damage claim is covered \r\n  by the single \"per person\" limit applicable to the claim for bodily injury giving \r\n  rise to the consequential damages. Wife's damages were consequential and are \r\n  covered under the same \"per person\" limit as the bodily injuries of Husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-140 dictates coverage \r\n  for \"loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, \r\n  maintenance, or use of these motor vehicles.\" The Stewarts seize upon this statutory \r\n  phrase as a premise for their position that Wife's loss of consortium and bodily \r\n  injury damage claim must be covered under the policy. Their reliance is misplaced. \r\n  A spouse's loss of consortium and bodily injury damage is not \r\n  imposed by law. Concomitantly, Â§ 38-77-140 does not \r\n  require separate \"per person\" coverage for this loss. \r\nThe Stewarts cite Bilodeau v. Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., 467 N.E.2d 137 (Mass. 1984), as authority \r\n  for the proposition that under an automobile liability policy providing \"per \r\n  person\" coverage for bodily injury as well as a higher \"per accident\" liability \r\n  limit, an insurer that has exhausted its \"per person\" liability to a person \r\n  sustaining bodily injury in an automobile accident is obligated to make additional \r\n  payments within the \"per accident\" limit for loss of consortium claims by the \r\n  victim's spouse. In the later case of Pinheiro, et al. v. The Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assoc., 547 N.E.2d \r\n  49 (Mass. 1989), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Bilodeau, \r\n  we were called on to determine whether a loss of consortium claimant was entitled \r\n  to a separate \"per person\" limit of recovery under the provision of the standard \r\n  Massachusetts automobile liability insurance policy, [which provided \"The most \r\n  we will pay for injuries to any one person as a result of any one accident is \r\n  [$10,000].\" Pinheiro, 547 N.E.2d \r\n  at 53 n.10.] We reasoned in Bilodeau \r\n  that, \"for purposes of applying the limitation of liability 'for injuries to \r\n  any one person as a result of any one accident,' the loss of consortium claimant \r\n  must be considered a separate 'person' from the bodily-injured 'person.'\" Thus, \r\n  we concluded that the consortium plaintiff was entitled to a separate \"per person\" \r\n  limit of recovery under the policy at issue in Bilodeau. \r\nIn 1985, the year following the Bilodeau \r\n  decision, the Commissioner of Insurance modified the language of the standard \r\n  automobile insurance policy to remove the separate \"per person\" limit for loss \r\n  of consortium plaintiffs. [The new version of the limitation read as follows: \r\n  \"The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily \r\n  injury to any one person in any one accident is [$10,000].\" Pinheiro, \r\n  547 N.E.2d at 53 n.11.] The Commissioner effectively changed the Bilodeau \r\n  result by modifying the \"per person\" liability language. \r\nPinheiro, \r\n  547 N.E.2d at 53 (footnotes omitted). We reject the analysis and holding of \r\n  Bilodeau in the context of South \r\n  Carolina law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Stewarts' argument \r\n  fails because it is based on the false premise that there is no coverage for \r\n  Wife's loss of consortium claim in violation of South Carolina law or public \r\n  policy. Wife's consequential damage claim is covered under the same \"per person\" limit as Husband's direct physical injury. Simplistically put, Wife is not entitled \r\n  to a separate coverage limit over and above that limit also covering \r\n  Husband's bodily injury claim. In contrariety to the Stewarts' contention, State \r\n  Farm's insured had coverage as required by law for both the directly \r\n  inflicted injury to Husband and the injury to Wife which occurred as a result \r\n  of Husband's bodily injuries. The fact the amount of liability insurance selected \r\n  by State Farm's insured may not be adequate to pay the full amount of both types \r\n  of injuries is a repercussion of the choice made by the insured, not any contravention \r\n  of South Carolina law or public policy. South Carolina law does not require \r\n  an automobile liability policy to provide separate coverage under the \"per person\" policy limits for loss of consortium.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe hold Wife's damages are covered \r\n  under the same \"per person\" limit as the bodily injuries of Husband. Further, \r\n  we rule Wife's claim for loss of consortium is a claim for consequential damages \r\n  not covered under a separate \"per person\" limit from the Husband. We reject \r\n  the public policy argument emanating from the Stewarts that the liability insurer \r\n  must provide separate \"per person\" coverage for a spouse claiming loss of consortium. \r\n  Additionally, we refuse to mandate separate policy coverage for loss of consortium \r\n  even in the face of our law holding that loss of consortium is an independent \r\n  action. South Carolina Code Ann Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. 1999) does not \r\n  mandate an additional \"per person\" limit in regard to a loss of consortium claim. \r\n  Finally, Wife, who was not a bystander, did not satisfy the Kinard \r\n  requirements for a direct claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the Circuit Court granting summary judgment to State \r\n  Farm is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
