Nettles, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4835Â  \r\n  Submitted March 1, 2011 â€“ Filed June 1,\r\n2011\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lisa Poe Davis, of Surfside Beach, for\r\n          Appellants.\r\n        Douglas Charles Baxter, of Myrtle Beach, and\r\n          Jerome Scott Kozacki, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  After their expert witness traveled from Ohio to South Carolina for his deposition,\r\n  Appellants moved to compel the South Carolina Department of Transportation (the\r\n  Department) to pay the expert's bill for $6,021.10.Â  The circuit court ordered\r\n  the Department to pay only $2,125.Â  On appeal, Appellants argue the circuit\r\n  court's decision ignores the mandates of Rules 26(b)(4)(C) and 30(b)(7) of the\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and constitutes an impermissible\r\n  judicial correction of the Department's mistake.Â  We reverse[1] and remand for a determination of a reasonable fee\r\n  for the expert's travel time and travel expenses.\r\nFACTS\r\nFollowing an automobile\r\n  accident involving a pothole, Marcus James and Leon James (collectively\r\n  &quot;Appellants&quot;) filed an action against the Department and the City of\r\n  Marion (City) for negligence.Â  Appellants retained James Scherocman of Cincinnati,\r\n  Ohio, as an expert witness.Â  During discovery, the Department contacted\r\n  Appellants to schedule Scherocman's telephonic deposition.Â  Scherocman refused\r\n  to appear telephonically.[2]Â \r\n  Subsequently, the Department served a notice of deposition for Scherocman\r\n  indicating his deposition would proceed at the office of Appellants' counsel.Â \r\n  In view of Scherocman's refusal to appear by telephone, Appellants advised the\r\n  Department that it and the City would be responsible for all fees and costs\r\n  associated with producing Scherocman in South Carolina.Â  Scherocman appeared\r\n  and testified for six hours.Â  \r\nA week later, Scherocman\r\n  provided Appellants with an invoice totaling $6,021.10 for his deposition.Â  The\r\n  invoice included itemized travel expenses of $631.10 and hourly charges totaling\r\n  $5,390.[3]Â \r\n  When Appellants received Scherocman's bill for his deposition, they transmitted\r\n  it to the Department and to the City with a request that each pay one-half the\r\n  amount of the invoice.Â  The Department declined to pay.[4]Â  \r\nAppellants filed a motion to\r\n  compel the Department to pay Scherocman's bill.Â  Following a hearing, the\r\n  circuit court ordered the Department to pay $2,125 toward the bill.Â  This\r\n  figure included $2,100 for the six hours of Scherocman's time that were spent in\r\n  the deposition at a rate of $350 per hour, plus the $25 witness fee provided in\r\n  Rule 30(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  The circuit court specifically found Scherocman's\r\n  refusal to be deposed by telephone caused him to incur the additional fees and\r\n  costs and Appellants failed to demonstrate good cause why they should recover\r\n  any additional fees or costs.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court concluded that\r\n  $2,125 was a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount and that requiring the Department to\r\n  pay any additional fees or costs &quot;would not be fair, just, reasonable, or\r\n  equitable.&quot;Â  After additional arguments, the circuit court denied\r\n  Appellants' motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn issue regarding statutory\r\n  interpretation is a question of law.Â  S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 390 S.C. 418, 425, 702 S.E.2d 246,\r\n  250 (2010).Â  &quot;When reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case tried\r\n  without a jury, the appellate court's jurisdiction is limited to correction of\r\n  errors of law.&quot;Â  Epworth Children's Home v. Beasley,&nbsp;365 S.C.\r\n  157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714&nbsp;(2005).Â  The\r\n  award of costs and fees relating to testimony by an expert witness is a matter\r\n  within the discretion of the circuit court.Â  Black v. Roche Biomed. Labs.,\r\n  315 S.C. 223, 230, 433 S.E.2d 21, 25 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in (1) finding\r\n  Scherocman's travel expenses were not reasonable when Rule 26(b)(4)(C), SCRCP,\r\n  requires an expert witness to be produced for deposition within South Carolina;\r\n  (2) ignoring the provision of Rule 30(b)(7), SCRCP, that a deposition may\r\n  proceed by telephone only if the parties so stipulate or if the court orders\r\n  it; and (3) impermissibly correcting the Department's contention that\r\n  Scherocman was entitled to only the $25 per diem witness fee provided in Rule\r\n  30, SCRCP.Â  We address these issues together and reverse.Â Â Â  \r\nI. Law Concerning Interpretation\r\n  of Procedural Rules\r\nCourts interpreting the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply the same rules of construction used to\r\n  interpret statutes.Â  Maxwell v. Genez, 356 S.C. 617, 620, 591 S.E.2d 26,\r\n  27 (2003).Â  &quot;[C]ivil procedure and appellate rules should not be written\r\n  or interpreted to create a trap for the unwary lawyer or party . . . .&quot;Â  Elam\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 25, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004).Â \r\n  However, &quot;[t]he language [of a statute] must also be read in a sense which\r\n  harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.&quot; Hitachi\r\n    Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992).Â  \r\n&quot;Statutes in apparent\r\n  conflict should be construed, if possible, to allow both to stand and give\r\n  effect to each.&quot;Â  Adoptive Parents v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C.\r\n  535, 543, 446 S.E.2d 404, 409 (1994).Â  Generally, when a general statute and a\r\n  specific statute conflict, the specific statute prevails.Â  Atlas Food Sys.\r\n    &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Nat'l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319\r\n  S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995).Â  \r\nII. Law Concerning Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure\r\nRule 26(b)(4) governs the\r\n  discovery of the opinions of expert witnesses:\r\nUpon\r\n  the request of the party seeking discovery, unless the court determines\r\n  otherwise for good cause shown, or the parties agree otherwise, a party\r\n  retaining an expert who is subject to deposition shall produce such expert in\r\n  this state for the purpose of taking his deposition, and the party seeking\r\n  discovery shall pay the expert a reasonable fee for time and expenses spent in\r\n  travel and in responding to discovery and upon motion the court may require the\r\n  party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and\r\n  expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and\r\n  opinions from the expert.\r\nRule 26(b)(4)(C), SCRCP.Â  \r\nRule 30 governs depositions\r\n  generally and provides depositions conducted by telephone are permitted in\r\n  South Carolina:Â  \r\nThe\r\n  parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that a\r\n  deposition be taken by telephone. Â For the purposes of this rule and Rules\r\n  28(a), 37(a)(1), 37(b)(1) and 45(d), a deposition taken by telephone is taken\r\n  at the same place where the deponent is to answer questions propounded to him. Â The\r\n  notary before whom the deposition is taken shall be at the same place as the\r\n  deponent during the taking of the deposition.\r\nRule 30(b)(7), SCRCP.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Analysis\r\nWe find the circuit court's\r\n  award fails to give effect to both Rules 26(b)(4)(C) and 30(b)(7) and unduly\r\n  burdens Appellants with costs the Department, under the facts of this case,\r\n  should pay.[5]Â \r\n  Initially, we note Rule 26(b)(4)(C) provides two different scenarios, each with\r\n  a unique payee, in which a deposing party may be required to pay an expert\r\n  witness's fees.Â  The first provision obligates the party initiating the\r\n  deposition to pay the expert a reasonable fee for time and expenses spent in\r\n  traveling and the taking of the deposition.[6]Â \r\n  The second vests the circuit court with discretion to find the initiating party\r\n  liable to the producing party for &quot;a fair portion of the fees and expenses\r\n  reasonably incurred&quot; by the producing party during its own communications\r\n  with the expert witness.[7]Â  Id.Â  Only the former provision, requiring payment to the expert of\r\n  &quot;reasonable fees and expenses,&quot; is at issue here.Â  \r\nThe circuit court based its\r\n  decision to limit the Department's liability for Scherocman's fees and expenses\r\n  solely upon the expert's refusal to give his deposition by telephone.Â  What is\r\n  &quot;reasonable,&quot; then, depends largely upon the expert's and the parties'\r\n  obligations to one another.Â  Rule 26(b)(4)(C) specifically governs the\r\n  depositions of expert witnesses and mandates that an expert witness\r\n  &quot;shall&quot; be produced in South Carolina.[8]Â \r\n  Therefore, under Rule 26(b)(4)(C), Appellants were required to produce Scherocman\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  However, the occurrence of either of two events could\r\n  override this mandate.Â  Id.Â  If the parties agree to an alternate\r\n  arrangement, the expert witness need not be deposed in South Carolina.Â  In this\r\n  case, the parties were unable to reach such an agreement.Â  Similarly, the\r\n  circuit court may issue an order overriding the location requirement if either\r\n  party moves for a deviation and demonstrates good cause for not deposing the\r\n  witness in South Carolina.Â  Id.Â  Neither party so moved, and the circuit\r\n  court issued no such order in this case. Because neither of these events\r\n  occurred in the case at bar, the requirement that Scherocman appear in person\r\n  in South Carolina remained intact.Â  \r\nThe two rules at issue here\r\n  do not conflict with regard to the fact that a telephonic deposition is an\r\n  exception rather than the rule.Â  Consequently, with respect to an in-person\r\n  deposition versus a telephonic one, we may give effect to both rules without diminishing\r\n  the coverage of either.Â  See Adoptive\r\n    Parents, 315 S.C. at 543, 446 S.E.2d\r\n  at 409 (&quot;Statutes in apparent conflict should be construed, if possible,\r\n  to allow both to stand and give effect to each.&quot;).Â  Rule 30(b)(7) offered\r\n  the parties the option of conducting Scherocman's deposition by telephone as an\r\n  alternative to conducting it in person, but in no manner did it obligate\r\n  Appellants to produce Scherocman by telephone without their agreement.Â  Rule\r\n  26(b)(4)(C) required Appellants to produce Scherocman in South Carolina and\r\n  further required that the Department &quot;shall pay [Scherocman] a reasonable\r\n  fee for time and expenses spent in travel and in responding to discovery.&quot;Â \r\n  If the Department did not wish to pay the expert witness for his travel time and\r\n  expenses, it bore the burden of securing another arrangement, either with\r\n  Appellants or by order of the circuit court.[9]Â \r\n  Because the Department's offer to conduct the deposition by telephone failed to\r\n  result in either an agreement or a court order, the location requirement\r\n  remained intact.Â  Accordingly, the parties' arguments concerning the motivation\r\n  for Scherocman's refusal to be deposed by telephone is not dispositive of\r\n  whether or not the expert is entitled to recover for travel time and expenses.[10]Â  \r\nRules 26 and 30 do conflict\r\n  with regard to the payment a witness receives for his time.Â  Rule 30(a)(2)\r\n  fixes the rate for witnesses in general at $25 per day.Â  Rule 26(b)(4)(C)\r\n  entitles an expert witness to &quot;a reasonable fee&quot; for his time and\r\n  travel.Â  However, when a general statute and a specific statute conflict, the\r\n  specific statute prevails.Â  Atlas Food, 319 S.C. at 558, 462 S.E.2d at\r\n  859.Â  Rule 26 specifically governs only expert witnesses, while Rule 30\r\n  concerns all witnesses.Â  In the case at bar, neither party denies Scherocman\r\n  was an expert witness.Â  Consequently, the reasonable time and expense provision\r\n  of Rule 26(b)(4)(C) controls here, and the circuit court's award of the $25\r\n  daily witness fee provided in Rule 30 was improper and an abuse of discretion.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nWith the Department's\r\n  obligation to pay Scherocman &quot;a reasonable fee for time and expenses spent\r\n  in travel and in responding to discovery&quot; in mind, we arrive at the\r\n  question of whether the circuit court erred in its determination of the\r\n  reasonableness of the bill.Â  The language of the rule is unclear as to whether\r\n  both travel time and travel expenses are compensable, or whether only deposition\r\n  time and travel expenses are compensable.Â  The construction of the sentence\r\n  suggests the expert witness should be paid for both time and expenses he\r\n  &quot;spent in travel and in responding to discovery.&quot;Â  If &quot;spent in\r\n  travel and in responding to discovery&quot; modified &quot;expenses&quot;\r\n  alone, the expert witness would not be entitled to payment for the time he\r\n  spent testifying at his deposition.Â  Compensating the witness for the time he\r\n  spends rendering his expert opinion, then, also requires compensating him in\r\n  some manner for the time he spends traveling.[11]Â  \r\nThe circuit court found\r\n  Scherocman's hourly rate for the six hours he spent in deposition was\r\n  reasonable but specifically excluded his travel time and travel expenses from\r\n  consideration because Scherocman refused to give his deposition by telephone.Â \r\n  As discussed above, it was incumbent upon the Department to secure either an\r\n  agreement or a court order requiring Scherocman's deposition by telephone.Â  In\r\n  failing to do so, the Department accepted its responsibility under Rule\r\n  26(b)(4)(C) to pay Scherocman's reasonable travel time and travel expenses.Â \r\n  Consequently, the circuit court erred in not considering that portion of the\r\n  expert witness's bill because he refused to testify by telephone.Â  We reverse the\r\n  circuit court's exclusion of Scherocman's travel time and travel expenses, as\r\n  well as the circuit court's imposition of the $25 witness fee, and remand for\r\n  the circuit court to review Scherocman's bill and determine reasonable amounts\r\n  for Scherocman's travel time and travel expenses.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Rule 30\r\n  does not require a party to present its expert witness for deposition by\r\n  telephone, absent either an agreement by the parties or a court order.Â  We\r\n  further find the party seeking a deviation from this general rule bears the\r\n  burden of securing it, either by agreement or by court order.Â  Because the\r\n  Department failed to seek a court order for a telephonic deposition when Scherocman\r\n  did not agree, the circuit court erred in considering Scherocman's refusal as\r\n  the sole basis for denying a reasonable sum for his travel time and travel\r\n  expenses. \r\nIn addition, we\r\n  find Rule 26 establishes the general rule that the producing party must present\r\n  its expert witness for deposition in South Carolina unless the parties agree or\r\n  the court orders otherwise.Â  We further find the same rule commands the deposing\r\n  party to &quot;pay the expert a\r\n  reasonable fee for time and expenses spent in travel and in responding to\r\n  discovery&quot; and that this provision supersedes the general rule providing for\r\n  a $25 per diem payment for a witness's deposition testimony.[12]Â  Accordingly, this matter is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nTHOMAS, J., concurs.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  dissenting:Â Â Â  I believe\r\n  the circuit judge's decision should be affirmed in accordance with the\r\n  well-established rule that &quot;[a] trial judge's rulings on discovery matters\r\n  will not be disturbed by an appellate court absent a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  Hollman v. Woolfson, 384 S.C. 571, 577, 683 S.E.2d\r\n  495, 498 (2009); see also Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic, 368\r\n  S.C. 326, 333, 628 S.E.2d 894, 898 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In my opinion, the circuit\r\n  judge committed no error of law, and his ruling is supported by the facts.Â  He\r\n  therefore ruled within his discretion.Â  Arthur, 368 S.C. at 333, 628\r\n  S.E.2d at 898 (&quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's\r\n  ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is\r\n  without evidentiary support.&quot;).Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nRule 26(b)(4)(C),\r\n  SCRCP, provides that &quot;unless the court determines otherwise for good cause\r\n  shown, . . . the party seeking discovery shall pay the expert a reasonable fee\r\n  for time and expenses spent in travel . . . .&quot;Â  The rule requires the\r\n  circuit court to consider: (1) whether the party opposing payment has shown\r\n  &quot;good cause,&quot; and (2) what is &quot;reasonable,&quot; and grants the\r\n  court discretion to fairly allocate the costs of expert discovery based on the\r\n  circuit judge's determination of good cause and reasonableness.[13]Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit judge\r\n  did that in this case.Â  Two key facts support his ruling.Â  First, the\r\n  Department asserted and Appellants conceded that the only reason the deposition\r\n  took place in South Carolina was the expert unilaterally and without\r\n  explanation refused to do the deposition over the telephone, insisting instead\r\n  that he be paid to travel here.Â  At the initial hearing before the circuit\r\n  court, the judge asked Appellants' lawyer: &quot;What benefit would you have\r\n  making him come to South Carolina?&quot;Â  The lawyer's answer was simply that\r\n  &quot;I didnâ€™t really have a dog in that fight&quot; and &quot;I had no way to\r\n  force my expert to do it by phone.&quot;Â  Neither statement is true.Â  The\r\n  lawyer, not the expert, is in charge of the case.Â  Appellants' lawyer was\r\n  unable to give any reason related to her client's case that the expert needed\r\n  to travel to South Carolina for the deposition.Â  The only reason given was the\r\n  expert's unsubstantiated personal preference.Â Â Â  \r\nSecond, the\r\n  Department's lawyer stated to the circuit judge at the initial hearing that the\r\n  expert &quot;indicated to me that he was here not only on this case but also in\r\n  connection with another case that he had been retained for.&quot;Â  Appellants'\r\n  lawyer did not respond to refute that assertion.[14]Â  At the\r\n  hearing on Appellants' motion for reconsideration, the Department's lawyer\r\n  stated: &quot;Mr. Scherocman told me that he had discussed [the other case] in\r\n  South Carolina with [Appellants' lawyer's] partner.&quot;Â  Appellants' lawyer\r\n  then conceded the accusation was true, stating: &quot;He just happened to do\r\n  that while he was there.Â  It wasn't like he came specifically for that.Â  He\r\n  just happened to talk to him while he was there, Your Honor.&quot;Â  The circuit\r\n  judge immediately denied the motion for reconsideration.\r\nAt the initial\r\n  hearing on Appellants' motion, the judge stated &quot;I'm not inclined to grant\r\n  the travel given the facts and circumstances of this case.&quot;Â  The written\r\n  order indicates the expert's refusal to participate by telephone is the primary\r\n  circumstance the judge considered.Â  However, the judge went beyond the simple\r\n  refusal by the expert and considered the reasons for the refusal.Â  He\r\n  considered that Appellants' lawyer could offer no valid reason for the expert's\r\n  refusal, and that the Department's lawyer demonstrated an invalid reason.Â  This\r\n  second point is critical.Â  When the circuit judge denied the motion for\r\n  reconsideration, he had before him information that the expert had insisted on\r\n  travelling to South Carolina, at least in part, so that he could work on\r\n  another, unrelated case while he was here.Â  This obviously resulted in a\r\n  financial benefit to both the expert and to Appellants' lawyer's firm; both\r\n  received the benefit of the expert's consult on the other case without having\r\n  to bear the cost of the expert's travel.Â  Under these circumstances, there are\r\n  facts to support the circuit judge's consideration of good cause and what is\r\n  reasonable, and thus his determination of how to fairly allocate the expert's\r\n  expenses.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit judge\r\n  also committed no error of law.Â  In the beginning of its analysis, the majority\r\n  states &quot;the circuit court's award fails to give effect to both Rules\r\n  26(b)(4)(C) and 30(b)(7) and unduly burdens Appellants with costs the\r\n  Department should pay.&quot;Â  This statement does not describe an error of\r\n  law.Â  Moreover, the analysis of Rule 30(b)(7) is misplaced.Â  Rule 30(b)(7) does\r\n  nothing more than permit a deposition to be taken by telephone upon agreement\r\n  or court order.Â  Rule 30(b)(7), SCRCP notes (&quot;This section permits a deposition\r\n  by telephone.Â  Although such a deposition is permissible under present rules,\r\n  this section makes the procedure explicit.&quot;).Â  The text of the rule\r\n  specifically acknowledges its relationship with four other rules of civil\r\n  procedure, but does not mention Rule 26(b)(4)(C).[15]Â  Rule\r\n  30(b)(7) has nothing to do with a circuit court's determination of good cause\r\n  and what is reasonable and fair under Rule 26(b)(4)(C).\r\nI am concerned\r\n  that the majority's holding that the two rules must be read together conflicts\r\n  with the practical reality of litigation, and places a tool for abuse into the\r\n  hands of obstructive lawyers.Â  Plans to depose out-of-state experts are\r\n  frequently made or revised at the last minuteâ€”even days before trial.Â \r\n  Requiring lawyers who wish to conduct the deposition by phone to get a court\r\n  order beforehand or face the payment of an unreasonable expense is likely to\r\n  encourage abuse and delay trials.Â  It is a common and acceptable occurrence in\r\n  modern litigation, for example, that an expert's opinion will change slightly\r\n  or even substantially in the weeks before trial.Â  Lawyers often conduct\r\n  follow-up depositions by telephone in order to explore these revised opinions\r\n  and the new or refined evidence upon which they are based.Â  A party seeking to\r\n  gain a tactical advantage might insist the expert travel to South Carolina for\r\n  this follow-up despite no legitimate reason for the travel.Â  The approach taken\r\n  by the majority would require the opposing party to get a court order for a\r\n  telephone deposition or pay the travel expenses of the expert, regardless of\r\n  whether the travel is justified.Â  In the weeks before trial it may be difficult\r\n  or even impossible to schedule a hearing before a circuit judge on such short\r\n  notice.Â  Knowing this, an obstructionist party may raise the telephone issue in\r\n  such a manner as to force an opposing party to make a difficult choice on how,\r\n  or whether, to proceed with a deposition.Â  \r\nIn most cases,\r\n  the circuit court will find at least some of an expert's &quot;expenses spent\r\n  in travel&quot; to be reasonable.Â  In all cases that decision should be made by\r\n  a circuit judge, not by this court.Â  In those relatively rare situations in\r\n  which a circuit judge gives sound reasons for finding that none of the expert's\r\n  travel expenses are reasonable, as the circuit judge did here, the decision\r\n  should be upheld.Â  \r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] See footnote 10.Â  \r\n[3] Scherocman's fee request included 15.4 hours of his time at a rate of $350 per\r\n  hour.Â  His expenses included approximately $363 for air fare, $120 for ground\r\n  transportation, $50 for meals, and $96 for one night's lodging.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Although the record is unclear on this point, it appears the City also did not\r\n  pay but was no longer a party to this case by the time Appellants filed their\r\n  motion to compel.Â  The motion to compel sought to recover the full amount of\r\n  Scherocman's bill from the Department and did not mention the City.Â  The City\r\n  did not appear at either hearing.Â  \r\n[5] This ruling addresses the merits of Appellants' issues concerning Rules 26 and\r\n  30.Â  Reversal on those issues makes it unnecessary to reach Appellant's\r\n  contention concerning judicial correction of the Department's mistake.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\n[6] See Peirson v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 255, 417 S.E.2d 604, 609\r\n  (Ct. App. 1992) (wherein this court held the trial court had authority under\r\n  Rule 26(b)(4)(C) to order the deposing party to pay a reasonable expert witness\r\n  fee).\r\n[7] We note our version of Rule 26(b)(4)(C) is similar to the pre-1993 version of\r\n  the federal rule.Â  According to Wright &amp; Miller:Â  \r\n[U]ntil\r\n  1993 Rule 26(b)(4)(C) provided the court discretion to order the discovering\r\n  party to pay the other party a fair share of the fees and expenses that party\r\n  incurred in obtaining facts and opinions from a testifying expert. . . . In\r\n  1993 this power was eliminated with respect to testifying witnesses.Â  \r\n* *\r\n  *\r\nThe\r\n  provisions about payment . . . are subject to the condition &quot;unless\r\n  manifest injustice would result.&quot;\r\n8A Charles Alan\r\n  Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice &amp;\r\n    Procedure: Civil Â§ 2034 (3d ed. 2010).Â  South Carolina's rule retains the\r\n  pre-1993 federal rule language regarding the authority of the court to require\r\n  the &quot;party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the\r\n  fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the [other] party in obtaining facts\r\n  and opinions from the expert.&quot;Â  However, we conclude that portion of the\r\n  rule does not apply to this case because Appellants are not attempting to\r\n  recover fees and expenses they incurred in obtaining facts or opinions from Scherocman.\r\n[8] But see Rule 30(a)(2), SCRCP (&quot;A witness may be compelled to\r\n  attend [his deposition] in the county in which he resides or is employed or\r\n  transacts his business in person, or at such other convenient place as is fixed\r\n  by an order of the court. Â A party may be compelled to attend in the\r\n  county in which the subject civil action is pending, or in the county in which\r\n  he resides or is employed or transacts business, or at such other convenient\r\n  place as is fixed by an order of the court.&quot; (emphasis supplied)).Â  \r\n[9] We note the record does not indicate the Department pursued either of these\r\n  options after Appellants' counsel informed it of Scherocman's refusal to appear\r\n  telephonically.Â  Instead, at the hearing on Appellants' motion to compel, the\r\n  Department adopted the position that it owed Scherocman no payment at all\r\n  beyond the $25 per diem witness fee provided in Rule 30(a)(2).Â  Moreover, the\r\n  Department dismisses the fact that it might have deposed Scherocman in Ohio and\r\n  incurred expenses in doing so. Â \r\n[10] Appellants contend in their brief that the reason Scherocman refused the\r\n  telephonic deposition was because &quot;the subject matter was complex and\r\n  involved numerous exhibits.&quot;Â  The Department argued at both hearings that\r\n  Scherocman refused because he wanted a paid vacation to South Carolina or\r\n  wanted to discuss another case with Appellants' counsel.Â  However, at the\r\n  reconsideration hearing the court asked Appellants' counsel specifically\r\n  whether the expert had &quot;other matters to tend to in South Carolina.&quot;Â \r\n  Counsel's response was, &quot;No, your honor, just this deposition.&quot;Â  He\r\n  responded further that while he and the expert discussed another case while the\r\n  expert was in South Carolina, there was no reason for the expert to come to\r\n  South Carolina to discuss that case.\r\n[11] However, no provision commands that the hourly rate an expert receives for the\r\n  time he spends in travel must match the hourly rate he receives for\r\n  testifying.Â  The determination of a reasonable hourly rate for each activity\r\n  lies within the circuit court's discretion.Â  \r\n[12] This opinion in no way suggests that parties should not fully cooperate in the\r\n  area of discovery to ensure that it is obtained in the most efficient, most\r\n  convenient, and least expensive manner.\r\n[13] See 8A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, Federal\r\n  Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil Â§ 2034 (3d ed. 2010) (stating the comparable\r\n  federal rule &quot;seeks a fair allocation of expert expenses between the\r\n  retaining party and the one seeking discovery.&quot;).Â  Rule 26(b)(4), SCRCP,\r\n  is &quot;based on the comparable Federal Rule.&quot;Â  Rule 26(b)(4), SCRCP\r\n  notes.Â  The federal rule provides: &quot;Unless manifest injustice would\r\n  result, the court must require that the party seeking discovery: (1) pay the\r\n  expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under Rule\r\n  26(b)(4)(A) . . . .&quot;Â  Rule 26(b)(4)(E), Fed. R. Civ. P.Â  The South\r\n  Carolina rule originally incorporated the &quot;manifest injustice&quot;\r\n  standard, but was amended in 1986, replacing manifest injustice with &quot;good\r\n  cause.&quot;Â  Rule 26(b)(4), SCRCP notes to 1986 Amendment.Â  Thus, the federal\r\n  rule allows even less discretion to the trial judge than the South Carolina\r\n  rule.Â  \r\n[14] The bill submitted by the expert supports this assertion, as it includes plane\r\n  fare after the deposition from Myrtle Beach to Atlanta, not back to\r\n  Cincinnati.Â  \r\n[15] Rule 30(b)(7), SCRCP (&quot;For the purposes of this rule and Rules 28(a),\r\n  37(a)(1), 37(b)(1) and 45(d), . . . .&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4836","title":"Wilson v.

Â The guardian did not\r\n  articulate any reason why the proposed name change would promote the child's\r\n  best interest.\r\nAfter hearing from both\r\n  parents, the guardian, and other witnesses, the family court issued an order\r\n  denying the name change.Â  McDonald appeals, arguing the proposed hyphenation of\r\n  the child's last name promotes her best interest. Â We review the family court's\r\n  decision de novo.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed\r\n  May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 41, 44).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSection 15-49-10(B) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2005) permits a parent to petition the family court to\r\n  change the name of a minor child.Â  &quot;The court shall grant the petition if it\r\n  finds that it is in the best interest of the child.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-49-10(B).Â  The parent seeking a name change bears the burden of proving the\r\n  change furthers the child's best interests.Â  Stradford v. Wilson, 378\r\n  S.C. 300, 303-04, 662 S.E.2d 491, 493&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (citing Mazzone\r\n    v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 210, 532 S.E.2d 890, 893&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000)).\r\n\r\n  In Mazzone, this court identified nine factors to consider when\r\n  determining whether a child's name should be changed.Â  341 S.C. at 210-11, 532\r\n  S.E.2d at 893-94.Â  These factors, which are not exclusive, are as follows: \r\n(1) the\r\n  length of time that the child has used the present\r\n  surname; (2) the effect of the change on the preservation and development of\r\n  the child's relationship with each parent; (3) the identification of the child\r\n  as part of a family unit; (4) the wishes of the parents; (5) the stated reason\r\n  for the proposed change; (6) the motive of the parents and the possibility that\r\n  the use of a different name will cause insecurity or a lack of identity; (7) the\r\n  difficulty, harassment, or embarrassment that the child may experience when the\r\n  child bears a surname different from the custodial parent; (8) the preference of the child if\r\n  the child is of an age and maturity to express a meaningful preference; and (9)\r\n  the degree of community respect associated with the present and proposed\r\n  surname.\r\nId.; see also Stradford, 378 S.C. at 303-04,\r\n  662 S.E.2d at 493&nbsp;(applying the Mazzone factors in determining it\r\n  was not in a child's best interest to change child's surname from that of her\r\n  mother's to her father's).\r\nWith regard to the first\r\n  factor, the child was three years old at the time of the hearing and is now almost\r\n  six years old. Â &quot;Wilson&quot; has been her last name since birth.Â  The\r\n  child knew her name even at the time of the hearing, and according to the\r\n  guardian, announced it with pride.Â  We recognize that McDonald requested the\r\n  name change when the child was an infant.Â  However, his failure to support Wilson\r\n  during her pregnancy, his choice not to attend his daughter's birth, and his\r\n  failure to take any action on his daughter's behalf until after he was served\r\n  with a lawsuit from Wilson,[3] all invited the difficulty he now faces in proving she would be better off with\r\n  a different last name.Â  \r\nWith regard to the second and\r\n  third factors (relationship with each parent and identification as a family\r\n  unit), the hyphenation arguably better preserves her relationship with each\r\n  parent and identity with each family unit.Â  However, according to the guardian,\r\n  the daughter recognizes both family units already, despite bearing only her\r\n  mother's last name.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe fifth and sixth factors\r\n  (reason for the change and motives of the parties), warrant discussion.Â  McDonald's\r\n  stated reason for wanting the change was that he believed the daughter would\r\n  better identify with his family and that she would benefit in the community\r\n  from sharing a name similar to his. Â As noted in the analysis of the first\r\n  factor, McDonald could have championed these reasons when the birth certificate\r\n  was filled out, but he chose not to participate.Â  Wilson's initial motive for\r\n  excluding &quot;McDonald&quot; from the birth certificateâ€”her fear that McDonald\r\n  would not be present in her daughter's lifeâ€”was legitimate considering McDonald's\r\n  history with his twin sons and his absence during the pregnancy and birth here.Â  \r\nRegarding the seventh factor\r\n  (the difficulty, harassment, or embarrassment the child may experience if the\r\n  child bears a surname different from the custodial parent), Wilson expressed\r\n  concern that a hyphenated name was unusual in Anderson County and the\r\n  combination of names would result in a long, cumbersome surname for her daughter.[4] Â We find there was little evidence that bearing the mother's last name alone\r\n  would be any less embarrassing than having a hyphenated last name.Â  In either\r\n  event, the child has a name that is different from at least one of her\r\n  parents.Â  Indeed, when parents create a situation like this, it is beyond the\r\n  power of the court system in a name-change case to eradicate all of the stigma that\r\n  might be associated with it.\r\nMcDonald argues that the\r\n  ninth factorâ€”the degree of community respect associated with the present and\r\n  proposed surnameâ€”weighs heavily in favor of hyphenation because he and his\r\n  family are well known real estate agents in the community and have made\r\n  significant contributions to charitable causes. Â Wilson disagreed that McDonald's\r\n  last name is well-respected.Â  Based on our review of the record, we find that\r\n  both parties have good reputations in the community, and while a combination of\r\n  their last names might better allow their daughter to benefit from the goodwill\r\n  attached to each last name, this marginal benefit, when weighed against the\r\n  length of time the child has had her present last name, is not significant\r\n  enough to satisfy McDonald's burden of proving that a name change would promote\r\n  the child's best interest.Â  \r\nHaving considered the Mazzone factors, we agree with the family court's conclusion that changing the child's\r\n  last name to Wilson-McDonald would not be in her best interest.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We changed the names of the parents to protect the\r\n  privacy of the child.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] See Mazzone, 341 S.C. at 211, 532\r\n  S.E.2d at 894 (discussing the importance of the fact the father did not request\r\n  the name change until after the mother filed an action).Â  \r\n[4] Wilson also claimed the hyphenated name would prevent\r\n  monogramming.Â  However, we are not impressed with the monogramming argument.Â \r\n  We can envision no scenario in which a child's monogram would be important\r\n  enough to influence a court's decision about which last name best promotes her\r\n  interests.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4837","title":"Reed v.

Lanier, of Orangeburg,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Jennifer\r\n  Pieper (Mother) appeals from the family court's order awarding custody of the parties'\r\n  minor child to James Reed (Father).Â  Further, Mother claims the family court\r\n  erred in failing to grant her attorney's fees and costs. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDUAL HISTORY\r\nFather and Mother were never married, but they are the parents of one\r\n  child, L.R., who was born on July 28, 2005.Â  The relationship between Father\r\n  and Mother began in December 2003 while Father was married to Renae Reed.Â  In\r\n  March 2004, while Father was separated from Ms. Reed, Mother began working at\r\n  one of Father's companies, and she moved into an apartment owned by one of his\r\n  companies. Â Mother and Father began living together soon thereafter, and in\r\n  November 2004, Mother discovered she was pregnant. Â In February 2005, Father\r\n  proposed to Mother, and the parties were engaged for a short period of time\r\n  until Mother returned the ring and moved in with her parents. Â The couple\r\n  experienced many separations and attempts at reconciliation.[1]\r\nShortly after L.R. was born, Father commenced this action seeking\r\n  custody of the child. Â The family court issued a pendente lite order,\r\n  granting joint custody of the child to the parties and requiring Father to pay\r\n  Mother child support. Â Mother and Father continued dating one another.Â  During\r\n  the pendency of this action, maternal grandmother, Linda Pearson, signed an\r\n  affidavit recommending Father be awarded custody of her grandchild, L.R., while\r\n  Mother obtained treatment for her emotional condition.[2] Â Father once again proposed marriage to Mother, and she moved back in with\r\n  Father in October 2006 when L.R. was a one-year old. Â After another dispute in\r\n  December 2006, Mother permanently moved out of Father's home and returned to\r\n  her parents' home. \r\nAt the final hearing on May 12-13, 2008, the family court received\r\n  testimony from the parties, their witnesses, and the guardian ad litem. Â After\r\n  carefully weighing the evidence, the family court found that &quot;both parents\r\n  have an obvious love for their son&quot; and &quot;have experience in caring\r\n  for this child.&quot;Â  Finding both parents to be fit, the family court\r\n  considered the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; and concluded it was\r\n  in the best interest of L.R. to grant Father sole custody with visitation to Mother\r\n  consistent with the standard visitation schedule. Â In addition, the family\r\n  court stated both parties were to pay their own attorney's fees and costs. \r\nOn September 25, 2008, Mother timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion\r\n  seeking to alter or amend the final order. Â By order dated October 20, 2008,\r\n  the family court denied Mother's motion to reconsider. Â This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal\r\n  issues de novo.Â  Simmons v. Simmons, Op. No. 26970 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed\r\n  May 9, 2011) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 29); see Lewis v. Lewis,\r\n  Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at\r\n  44).Â  Although this court reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are\r\n  not required to ignore the fact that the trial court, who saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign\r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Lewis, Op. 26973 at 46-48.Â  The\r\n  burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the family court erred\r\n  in its findings.Â  Id. at 49-51.Â  \r\nWith respect to custody determinations, the appellate courts have\r\n  consistently shown deference to the family court in electing between fit\r\n  parents. Â Altman v. Griffith, 372 S.C. 388, 393, 642 S.E.2d 619, 621\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007). Â &quot;In gauging between fit parents as to who would better\r\n  serve the best interests and welfare of the child in a custodial setting, the\r\n  family court judge is in a superior position to appellate judges who are left\r\n  only to review the cold record.&quot; Â Altman, 372 S.C. at 393, 642\r\n  S.E.2d at 622.Â  &quot;For obvious and compelling reasons, as an appellate\r\n  court, we are reticent to substitute our judgment on the custody determination\r\n  between fit parents for that of the family court judge.&quot; Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Interests of L.R.\r\nMother's only challenge to the family court's decision to award Father\r\n  sole custody of L.R. is\r\n  that it was against the child's best interests.[3] Â We disagree.\r\nIn all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are\r\n  the child's welfare and best interests.Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136,\r\n  140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978). Â In determining custody, the family court &quot;must\r\n  consider the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the part of each\r\n  parent as they impact the child.&quot; Â Woodall, 322 S.C. at 11, 471\r\n  S.E.2d at 157.Â  In other words, &quot;the totality of the circumstances peculiar\r\n    to each case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision\r\n  can be weighed.&quot; Â Parris v. Parris, 319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d\r\n  571, 572 (1995) (emphasis added).\r\nThe family court properly considered evidence on the strengths and\r\n  weaknesses of each parent and weighed the totality of circumstances in\r\n  determining the child's best interests would be served by awarding custody to\r\n  Father.Â  After extensive testimony on the custody issue from the parties,\r\n  mental health professionals, and the guardian ad litem, the family court made\r\n  numerous in-depth findings to support its decision to award custody of the\r\n  child to Father. Â We find ample support in the record for these findings. \r\nFather has three children from a previous marriage that he has successfully\r\n  raised with his ex-wife, Renae Reed. Â Father has had sole custody of his eldest\r\n  child while sharing joint custody with his ex-wife of his other two children\r\n  since their divorce in 2004. Â Ms. Reed testified on Father's behalf at the\r\n  hearing, detailing Father's exemplary history as a parent and his continued\r\n  role as a father to their three children. Â During the hearing, Ms. Reed stated\r\n  that Father spends a significant amount of time with the children, coaching his\r\n  sons' sports teams, staying involved in his daughter's life, and generally\r\n  having a very close relationship with each of the children. Â Father has also\r\n  taken an active role in the children's educational pursuits, spending extra\r\n  time studying with his eldest son and seeking a tutor for his son's algebra\r\n  class.Â  In addition, Ms. Reed described Father's role in the care of their\r\n  daughter, who was born three months premature, as exceptional.Â  In order to\r\n  care for his daughter who suffered from heart and respiratory complications,\r\n  Father promptly learned the necessary training including CPR, the proper use of\r\n  a nebulizer machine, and how to administer her medications. Â Father took all of\r\n  these precautions despite Ms. Reed's occupation as a nurse.Â  Ms. Reed's\r\n  testimony credited Father for his child rearing abilities and stated that his &quot;parenting\r\n  is perfect.&quot;Â  In short, Ms. Reed believed Father exceeded all expectations\r\n  as a parent. \r\nIn addition, Father's history demonstrates the importance he places on\r\n  education for himself and his children. Â While Ms. Reed was pregnant with\r\n  Father's first child, Father went back to college to support his family.Â  Taking\r\n  out a student loan and working a forty-hour work week while attending school,\r\n  Father obtained a four-year degree in three years. Â This educational\r\n  advancement allowed Father to become a successful businessman, operating\r\n  several different corporations. Â See Davenport v. Davenport, 265\r\n  S.C. 524, 528, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975) (stating that education and parenting\r\n  skills of a parent are legitimate factors to consider in custody\r\n  determinations).Â  By contrast, the family court found Mother has generally\r\n  stated goals, but she does not have a demonstrable record of taking concrete\r\n  steps to achieve those goals. Â Moreover, Mother appears to be more focused on\r\n  what &quot;having her child taken from her&quot; will mean to her personally,\r\n  rather than what is in L.R.'s overall best interests. Â See Routh v.\r\n    Routh, 328 S.C. 512, 516, 492 S.E.2d 415, 418 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding that\r\n  a change in custody was warranted due to guardian ad litem's and psychologist's\r\n  concern that mother was immature and impulsive and at times did not act in the\r\n  best interests of her daughter). \r\nFinally, the family court emphasized the stability of Father's home\r\n  environment in awarding custody to Father. Â As a result of Father's business success\r\n  and the sale of the majority of his corporations, Father works from home and\r\n  maintains a flexible work schedule, which allows him to spend more time with L.R.\r\n  and adjust his schedule to accommodate L.R.'s needs.Â  See Shainwald\r\n    v. Shainwald, 302 S.C. 453, 460, 395 S.E.2d 441, 446 (Ct. App. 1990)\r\n  (upholding an award of custody based largely on the father's ability to spend\r\n  time with the children).Â  Although Mother is critical of Father's personal\r\n  success, it is Father's financial well-being that actually allows him to have\r\n  the everyday flexibility to provide a more stable environment than Mother. Â See Chastain v. Chastain, 381 S.C. 295, 305, 672 S.E.2d 108, 113 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) (affirming custody award to a husband who had a flexible work schedule\r\n  and worked from home, whereas the mother's work schedule was very inflexible).Â \r\n  In addition to being able to spend more time with L.R. than Mother, Father's\r\n  home provides many opportunities for recreation and interaction with L.R.'s\r\n  three half-siblings, Jimmy, age 17, Elizabeth, age 13, and Matthew, age 11, at\r\n  baseball games, family outings, and meals.[4]Â \r\n  By contrast, Mother has had several employment changes, has shown no real\r\n  direction as to her future employment, and L.R. would spend as much as forty\r\n  hours per week in daycare were Mother to have custody. Â See Gandy v.\r\n    Gandy, 297 S.C. 411, 413, 377 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1989) (remanding matter to\r\n  family court to consider court-appointed expert testimony that the children\r\n  should be placed with the parent who was willing to stay with them and not rely\r\n  on babysitters, even relatives).Â  Moreover, although noting Mother functions\r\n  well and poses no threat of harm to the child, the family court order found\r\n  Mother continues to be under a doctor's care for her mental health issues and\r\n  emotional problems. Â Mother's continued treatment for depression was a significant\r\n  factor in the family court finding Father would provide a more stable, healthy\r\n  environment for L.R.Â  \r\nThe family court's in-depth findings show it properly considered the\r\n  fitness of each parent and the relevant factors that would affect L.R.'s best\r\n  interests in making its custody determination. Â See Pirayesh\r\n    v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 296, 596 S.E.2d 505, 512 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;When\r\n  determining to whom custody shall be awarded, the court should consider all the\r\n  circumstances of the particular case and all relevant factors must be taken\r\n  into consideration.&quot;).\r\nWe note a majority of Mother's argument on appeal centers around the\r\n  lengthy and dramatic history of the parties' relationship with little focus on\r\n  why Mother is better suited to be L.R.'s primary caretaker.Â  While much of both\r\n  parties' testimony at the final hearing focused on the parties' relationship,\r\n  Mother has failed to sufficiently present evidence proving that the family\r\n  court's award of custody to Father was contrary to the child's best interests. Â See Jones v. Ard, 265 S.C. 423, 426, 219 S.E.2d 358, 359-60 (1975)\r\n  (finding that when both parties are fit and proper to have custody, the family\r\n  court must make the election, and [the appellate court] must defer to its\r\n  decision when the family court's findings and conclusions are supported by the\r\n  record).\r\nOn appeal, Mother asserts that as the primary caretaker of L.R., the\r\n  child's best interests would be served by awarding her custody.Â  Mother's\r\n  argument is without merit.Â  L.R. was born on July 28, 2005 and, shortly\r\n  thereafter, Father filed this action seeking custody of the child.Â  Not even\r\n  six months later, on December 12, 2005, the family court issued a pendente\r\n    lite order granting Father and Mother joint custody of L.R.Â  Moreover, after\r\n  the family court's final order on August 28, 2008, Father has had sole custody\r\n  of L.R.Â  Since L.R. was six months old, Father has either had joint or sole\r\n  custody of his son.Â  There is no evidence in the record establishing that the\r\n  Mother has been the primary caretaker of L.R. and the family court did not make\r\n  any finding to that effect.Â  As a result, Mother's argument that her role as\r\n  primary caretaker weighs in her favor in determining L.R.'s best interests is\r\n  misplaced.\r\nMother argues and the dissent notes the underlying reason Mother should\r\n  have custody is evidence in the record of Father's manipulative and controlling\r\n  nature.Â  In particular, the dissent argues L.R.'s maternal grandmother, Linda\r\n  Pearson, was manipulated into signing an affidavit recommending Father be\r\n  awarded custody of her grandchild, L.R., while Mother obtained treatment.Â  It\r\n  was only at trial that Mrs. Pearson recanted her affidavit, testifying she\r\n  signed the affidavit because Father was going to use it to &quot;force [Mother]\r\n  to come back&quot; to him and not to obtain custody of L.R.Â  But the family\r\n  court did not find the grandmother's extraordinary act of submitting an\r\n  affidavit unfavorable to her daughter to have been obtained through manipulation\r\n  by Father. Â Â Â Â \r\nFinally, Mother argues Father's &quot;promiscuity actually has had and\r\n  will have an adverse effect on [L.R.].&quot; Â Mother asserts Father's\r\n  promiscuity in having five children with three different women and his general\r\n  lack of morals would not provide the best environment for L.R.Â  This issue is\r\n  not preserved for our review. Â Father's alleged promiscuity was not raised to\r\n  or ruled upon by the family court.Â  In addition, the issue was not addressed in\r\n  the final order or raised in the motion for reconsideration. Â Therefore, this\r\n  issue is not properly before this court for review. Â See S.C. Dep't.\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 252, 551 S.E.2d 274, 280 (2001) (holding\r\n  an issue not raised to or ruled on by the family court should not be considered\r\n  by the appellate court); see also Richland Cnty. v. Carolina\r\n    Chloride, Inc., 382 S.C. 634, 656, 677 S.E.2d 892, 903 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding\r\n  appellant waived issue by not arguing it in the initial appellate brief).Â  We\r\n  address this issue, however, because &quot;procedural rules are subservient to\r\n  the court's duty to zealously guard the rights of minors.&quot; Â Joiner ex\r\n    rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000). \r\nIn South Carolina, a parent's\r\n  morality, while a proper consideration in custody disputes, is &quot;limited in\r\n  its force to what relevancy it has, either directly or\r\n  indirectly, to the welfare of the child.&quot;\r\n  Â Davenport, 265 S.C. at 527, 220 S.E.2d at 230; see also Shainwald,\r\n  302 S.C. at 460, 395 S.E.2d at 445-46; Stroman v. Williams, 291 S.C. 376,\r\n  378, 353 S.E.2d 704, 705 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Thus, conduct that is immoral must\r\n  also be shown to be detrimental to the welfare of a child before it is of legal\r\n  significance in a custody dispute. Â Stroman, 291 S.C. at 379, 353 S.E.2d\r\n  at 705. Â However, flagrant promiscuity inevitably affects the welfare of the\r\n  child and establishes &quot;a watershed in the court's quest to protect the best\r\n  interests of a minor child.&quot; Â Boykin v. Boykin, 296 S.C. 100, 102,\r\n  370 S.E.2d 884, 886 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\nHere, Mother asserts Father allowed his ex-girlfriend and the mother of\r\n  his fifth child to stay overnight at his house while his other children were\r\n  present.Â  Mother did not present any evidence that L.R. observed the\r\n  ex-girlfriend unclothed or that any sexual activity occurred in his presence. Â In\r\n  essence, there is no evidence that L.R. was exposed to an adulterous\r\n  relationship or any other immoral conduct detrimental to his welfare. Â See Kisling v. Allison, 343 S.C. 674, 683, 541 S.E.2d 273, 277 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001) (finding a father's decision to not expose the minor child to his new\r\n  relationship until it was six months old was a significant factor in\r\n  determining custody of a child in South Carolina).Â  Moreover, there is no\r\n  evidence that Father's conduct rose to the level of flagrant promiscuity.Â  See Chastain, 381 S.C. at 303, 672 S.E.2d at 112 (reversing the family court's\r\n  finding of flagrant promiscuity when wife engaged in two extra-marital affairs,\r\n  while husband engaged in one extra-marital affair).Â  Finally, we note Mother's\r\n  challenge to Father's lifestyle and the alleged detrimental effect it has on\r\n  L.R. is in essence the same relationship and position Mother once occupied with\r\n  regards to Father's children from his previous marriage. \r\nAdmittedly, neither parent is perfect.Â  The record certainly does not\r\n  reflect that the evidence is so clearly in Mother's favor to warrant a finding\r\n  of an abuse of discretion by the family court, and Mother has failed to sustain her burden of convincing this court\r\n  that the family court did not consider L.R.'s welfare and best interests in its\r\n  custody decision. Â See Shorb\r\n      v. Shorb, 372 S.C. 623, 628, 643 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot;The\r\n  burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the family court erred\r\n  in its findings of fact.&quot;\r\n  \r\n).\r\n  Â Father appears to be more focused on the overall welfare and care of L.R.Â  The\r\n  record shows the family court's decision was buttressed by the fact Father has\r\n  demonstrated very good parenting skills in raising three children.Â  In our\r\n  judgment, the record supports the view that L.R.'s best interest is served by\r\n  an award of custody to Father.Â  \r\nB. Attorney's Fees and Costs\r\nMother maintains the family court abused its discretion in refusing to\r\n  award her attorney's fees and costs.[5]Â \r\n  Specifically, Mother argues the family court did not properly weigh the requisite\r\n  factors to award attorney's fees because its decision was based entirely on the\r\n  lack of a beneficial result.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-3-130(H) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) authorizes\r\n  the family court to order payment of litigation expenses, including attorney's\r\n  fees, to either party in a divorce action.Â  An award of attorney's fees rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court and should not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 157, 459\r\n  S.E.2d 892, 896 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The family court is given broad discretion in\r\n  this area. Â Id.Â  &quot;The same considerations that apply to awarding\r\n  attorney's fees also apply to awarding litigation expenses.&quot; Â Patel v.\r\n    Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (citing Nienow v.\r\n      Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 173, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977)). Â Â \r\nIn determining whether attorney's fees should be awarded, the following\r\n  factors should be considered:Â  (1) the party's ability to pay his or her own\r\n  attorney's fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the\r\n  parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the attorney's\r\n  fees on each party's standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C.\r\n  471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). Â \r\nThe family court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award\r\n  either party attorney's fees in this matter.Â  Although the family court did not\r\n  delineate its consideration of the E.D.M. factors, this court may,\r\n  through its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, find that the family\r\n  court's decision regarding attorney's fees was proper. Â See Henggeler\r\n    v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 601, 510 S.E.2d 722, 724 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;On\r\n  appeal from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.&quot;).Â  Our review of the evidence is in accord with the family\r\n  court's finding. \r\nBecause Father succeeded in obtaining custody of the child, the\r\n  &quot;beneficial results&quot; factor from E.D.M. weighs in Father's\r\n  favor.Â  Moreover, we find the family court implicitly considered the financial\r\n  disparity between the parties and the effect its decision would have on\r\n  Mother's standard of living by requiring Father to be solely responsible for\r\n  paying the guardian ad litem's outstanding fees, and in only requiring Mother\r\n  to pay $100 per month in child support, despite being the noncustodial parent.Â \r\n  Therefore, considering the E.D.M. factors under this court's view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence, we find the family court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in declining to award either party attorney's fees in this\r\n  matter. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., concurs.Â  SHORT, J., dissents in a separate\r\n  opinion. \r\nSHORT, J. (dissenting):\r\nI respectfully dissent.Â  In my\r\n  view, the best interests of L.R. would be served by awarding custody to\r\n  Mother.Â Â  See Simmons v. Simmons, Op. No. 26970 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No.\r\n  16 at 29) (finding on appeal from the family court, the appellate court reviews\r\n  factual and legal issues de novo).Â  \r\nMother raises numerous meritorious issues in her appeal.Â  First,\r\n  throughout the tumultuous time these parties were together, Mother was a\r\n  stay-at-home mom and the primary caretaker of L.R.[6]Â  The guardian ad litem found L.R. to be an active,\r\n  healthy, and happy child.Â  The guardian found both parents to be fit.Â  I find\r\n  Mother's role as primary caretaker weighs in her favor in determining custody.\r\nThe family court considered Father's additional time to devote to L.R.,\r\n  and that L.R. would be in daycare if living with Mother.Â  However, Father\r\n  admitted he intended to enroll L.R. in a pre-kindergarten program.Â  I find this\r\n  is not a factor weighing in Father's favor as L.R. will be in school now\r\n  regardless of which parent is awarded custody.\r\nThe family court also considered that L.R. would have more opportunity\r\n  for interaction with his half-siblings in the custody of Father.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the family court found Father had demonstrated very good parenting skills in\r\n  the care, education, and upbringing of his older children. Â The only\r\n  half-sibling living full-time with Father at the time of the hearing was\r\n  Father's seventeen-year-old son.Â  Father's other two children, aged thirteen\r\n  and eleven at the time, lived either with their mother, or with Father\r\n  part-time.Â  The majority of Father's parenting skills at the time of the\r\n  hearing were exercised as a part-time parent. Â At this time, all of these\r\n  children have either completed high school, or are very close to completion,\r\n  rendering this consideration relatively insignificant.Â  \r\nFinally, the family court relied on Father's financial means and\r\n  education.Â  As noted by Mother, Father's wealth will be equally available to\r\n  support L.R. regardless of which parent is awarded custody.Â  As to Father's\r\n  education compared to Mother's education, the family court failed to consider\r\n  that Mother was a stay-at-home mom while living with Father, and his influence\r\n  in L.R.'s future education should, like his financial means, be available to\r\n  L.R. regardless of whether or not Father has primary custody.\r\nBased on the above factors, I find the parties in relative parity as to\r\n  the best interests of L.R. in determining custody.Â  Mother also raises the\r\n  issue of the impact of Father's promiscuity on L.R.[7]Â  Although certainly a concern, the primary issue\r\n  underlying my view that Mother should have custody is the evidence in the\r\n  record of Father's manipulative and controlling nature.Â  \r\nFor instance, the psychologist[8] concluded the relationship between the parties was\r\n  not balanced.Â  Father required Mother submit to his control.Â  Father informed\r\n  the psychologist that he would prefer the child be in Mother's care as long as\r\n  Mother was not irresponsible, abusive, or neglectful.Â  According to the\r\n  psychologist, Mother did not present a significant threat of harm of negligent\r\n  or abusive parenting. \r\nThere are other instances of Father's controlling and manipulative\r\n  nature in the record.Â  For example, L.R.'s maternal grandmother (Grandmother)\r\n  testified Father manipulated her into signing an affidavit that Father had\r\n  drafted, in which Grandmother recommends Father receive custody, with Mother\r\n  granted visitation supervised by Grandmother.Â Â  At trial, Grandmother testified\r\n  she signed the affidavit because Father manipulated her into believing he was\r\n  going to use it to &quot;force [Mother] to come back&quot; to marry him, and\r\n  that he would never use it to take L.R. from Mother.Â  Another example of\r\n  Father's need to control was reported at trial by a parent educator who worked\r\n  with L.R. and Mother for two years to assess L.R.'s developmental progress.Â \r\n  The educator testified Father threatened to report her to the State Department\r\n  of Education because she worked with L.R. and Mother without his\r\n  participation.Â  In another manipulative act, Father reported Mother for\r\n  criminal domestic violence based on an argument during which Mother slapped\r\n  Father.[9]Â  According to the Sheriff's Department Incident\r\n  Report, Father wanted to file the report &quot;for when [they] go to family\r\n  court for custody of the baby.&quot;Â  Father constantly threatened Mother with\r\n  her loss of custody if she did not follow his directives, be they reconciling\r\n  with him or other matters.Â  During one reconciliation period, Father presented\r\n  Mother with an agreement that would grant him custody in exchange for agreeing\r\n  to marry Mother and have another child with her.Â  This reconciliation did not\r\n  last long and ended with Father moving all of Mother and L.R.'s belongings to\r\n  Grandmother's house and posting a &quot;no trespassing&quot; notice at their\r\n  house. \r\nBased on my view of the preponderance of the record, I find no evidence\r\n  to support the removal of L.R. from Mother, his primary caretaker.[10]Â  See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 527,\r\n  599 S.E.2d 114, 120 (2004) (&quot;Although\r\n  there is no rule of law requiring custody be awarded to the primary caretaker,\r\n  there is an assumption that custody will be awarded to the primary caretaker.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Father and Mother were engaged a total of four\r\n  times.\r\n[2] Notably, Linda Pearson subsequently repudiated\r\n  her affidavit as to her daughter's condition at the hearing.\r\n[3]Â  Mother never challenges Father's fitness as a\r\n  parent.\r\n[4] The dissent comments that these circumstances\r\n  are now insignificant because of the passage of time.Â  Our review is limited to\r\n  the record from the family court hearing and cannot include facts not presented\r\n  to the family court, nor can we speculate about any changed circumstances that\r\n  may exist today.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Mother incurred $14,225 in attorney's fees and\r\n  $506.50 in costs.Â  \r\n[6] Â L.R., born July 28, 2005, was almost three at the\r\n  time of the hearing.\r\n[7] Â Father has children with three women, and in\r\n  September 2008, he married a pregnant 27-year-old woman. \r\n[8] Per order of\r\n  the family court, Father and Mother were referred for psychological\r\n  evaluation.Â  \r\n[9] Mother reported Father goaded her into the slap,\r\n  which she acknowledged was inappropriate.\r\n[10] Although the family court made no specific finding as\r\n  to which parent was L.R.'s primary caretaker, there is evidence that Mother was\r\n  in actuality the primary caretaker: 1) Mother was sole caretaker for first two\r\n  months of L.R.'s life; 2) for a period of time, L.R. visited Father only if\r\n  Mother was also visiting Father; 3) the parties exercised the joint custody\r\n  arrangement for only ten months before Mother moved back in with Father in\r\n  October 2006; 4) Mother testified she kept L.R. numerous times at Father's\r\n  house during his week; and 5) the parties did not separate for the last time\r\n  until approximately nine months before the final hearing.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4838","title":"Major v.

Lord, of Irmo, for Appellant.\r\nLouis O. Dore, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: On appeal, Johnnie Major, as personal\r\n  representative for the estate of Edward Major (the Estate), contests the\r\n  master-in-equity's finding that Penn Community Services, Inc. (Penn) is the fee\r\n  simple owner of 6.2 acres of real estate in Beaufort County (the Property).Â \r\n  The Estate first claims the master lacked subject matter jurisdiction because\r\n  the master's decision to quiet title to the Property required a determination\r\n  of intestate heirs, which is exclusively within the probate court's\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  The Estate also argues the master erred in concluding a certain\r\n  deed conveyed the Property to Penn because the master's decision was based upon\r\n  an erroneous determination of intestate succession.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSub Lot 8,[1] bordered in part by Johnson River, is located on Saint Helena's Island in Beaufort\r\n  County, South Carolina.Â  Sub Lot 8 comprises 14.13 acres of real estate, and of\r\n  the 14.13 acres, the Estate undisputedly owns 7.93 acres.Â  At issue in this\r\n  appeal is whether the Estate or Penn possesses title to an additional 6.2 acres\r\n  located in the southern portion of Sub Lot 8 (the Property).\r\nIn 1866, Edward Philbrick deeded &quot;[] Lot No. (8)\r\n  . . . containing eighteen acres more or less&quot; to Scipio Josiah.Â  Scipio\r\n  Josiah later died intestate, leaving his only child, William Josiah, as his sole\r\n  heir.Â  On January 5, 1932, William Josiah conveyed Lot 8 to F.R. Ford for\r\n  payment of delinquent taxes.Â  The 1932 deed described Lot 8 as &quot;eighteen\r\n  acres, more or less, being bounded . . . on the North by the marshes of Johnson\r\n  River, East by lands of Penn School, South by lands of Penn School, [and on\r\n  the] West by [m]arshes of Johnson River.&quot; Â On June 17, 1936, F.R. Ford\r\n  conveyed the same parcel to brothers Edward and James Major.Â  The 1936 deed\r\n  described Lot 8 with the identical language stated in the 1932 deed.Â  \r\nOn September 23, 1950, the brothers partitioned the\r\n  eighteen acres in Lot 8, with the northern ten acres deeded to James Major and\r\n  the southern eight[2] acres deeded to Edward Major.Â  After Edward Major passed away in 1997, the\r\n  Estate brought an action to quiet and confirm title to Sub Lot 8 as well\r\n  as to confirm the southern boundary line of Sub Lot 8.Â  In its complaint, the\r\n  Estate asserted it was the rightful owner of &quot;the southern portion of Sub\r\n  Lot 8,&quot; which, in addition to its ownership of 7.93 acres, totaled 14.13\r\n  acres.Â  The Estate averred it never conveyed away any portion of Sub Lot 8, and\r\n  Penn's only rightful claim of ownership was to 3.11 acres undisputedly owned by\r\n  Penn.Â  In response, Penn asserted it had obtained lawful title of the Property\r\n  from R.R. Legare in 1916,[3] which was duly recorded at the Beaufort County Register of Deeds office.Â  Penn\r\n  claimed it immediately entered into possession of the Property after this\r\n  conveyance.Â  \r\nThe parties introduced various plats at trial in an\r\n  attempt to accurately document the master chain of title.Â  Penn first submitted\r\n  the Simons-Myrant Plat, which was prepared and recorded in 1905 before Penn\r\n  purportedly purchased the Property.Â  The Simons-Myrant plat illustrated Penn's\r\n  northernmost boundary including land only up to the disputed 6.2 acres.Â  Penn\r\n  also submitted the Palmer and Malone Plat, which was prepared and recorded in\r\n  1967.Â  This plat included the disputed 6.2 acres, which was consistent with\r\n  Penn's claim that it acquired the Property in 1916.Â  Last, the Estate submitted\r\n  the Gasque plat, which was prepared by a local surveyor, David Gasque, for\r\n  trial and was not recorded.Â  The Gasque plat depicted Sub Lot 8 as consisting\r\n  of 14.13 acres, which included the disputed 6.2 acres and the 7.93 acres\r\n  originally deeded to Edward Major in 1950.Â  Besides the Gasque plat, the Estate\r\n  presented no other evidence to show it ever surveyed, platted, or recorded Sub Lot\r\n  8.\r\nIn support of its claim that the Estate was the\r\n  rightful owner of the Property, several family members testified they used the\r\n  Property to graze animals for a number of years and had, at some point in time,\r\n  planted a small garden on the Property.Â  The Major family also stated they,\r\n  along with other citizens in the community, frequently used the &quot;Penn\r\n  dock&quot; on the eastern end of the Property for swimming, boating, and\r\n  crabbing.Â  \r\nIn support of its claim of ownership, Penn's acting\r\n  executive director and two past executive directors testified Penn had been in\r\n  possession of the Property for thirty-five years without any claims of adverse\r\n  ownership by the Major family.Â  The directors noted various Major family\r\n  members lived adjacent to the Property; however, they claimed none of the Major\r\n  heirs ever questioned Penn's ownership, despite Penn's establishment of a\r\n  nature trail and construction of a dock on the eastern end of the Property.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Penn presented, without objection,\r\n  the 1916 deed from R.R. Legare to Penn, which was duly recorded.Â  The 1916 deed\r\n  stated R.R. Legare was conveying &quot;the same land inherited by Florence\r\n  Major from her grandfather, Scipio Josiah, containing 6 acres, and portion\r\n  described as being bounded by Penn School lands, by the 'Corner' by land of\r\n  Rachel Simmons and by land of William Josiah.&quot;Â  Penn also presented, without\r\n  objection, a property record card prepared by Arthur Christensen, a surveyor in\r\n  Beaufort County during the relevant time period.Â  The property record card for\r\n  William Josiah stated, &quot;left daughter, Florence, who married Tom Major . .\r\n  . Lot 8 Corner from [William's] father, Scipio Josiah.&quot; The card subsequently\r\n  noted a conveyance from William Josiah to F.R. Ford on January 5, 1932.Â  \r\nBecause the R.R. Legare deed to Penn did not contain a\r\n  metes and bounds description but was only defined by adjacent landowners'\r\n  property lines, the master resorted to the various plats and deeds as well as\r\n  witnesses' testimony to determine whether the Property was located in Sub Lot\r\n  8.Â  In his final order, the master found Penn was the fee simple owner of the\r\n  Property, free and clear of any claims of ownership by the Estate.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, an action to quiet title is one in equity.Â  Fox v. Moultrie, 379 S.C. 609, 613, 666 S.E.2d 915, 917 (2008).Â  However,\r\n  when the defendant's answer raises an issue of paramount title to land, such as\r\n  would, if established, defeat plaintiff's action, the issue of title is legal. Â Dargan\r\n    v. Tankersley, 380 S.C. 480, 483, 671 S.E.2d 73, 74 (2008).Â  Therefore, in\r\n  a case tried without a jury, the factual findings of a judge regarding title\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence which\r\n  reasonably supports the judge's findings. Â Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of\r\n    Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). Â This scope of\r\n  review is equally applicable to the factual determinations of a master when, as\r\n  in the present case, he enters final judgment. Â May v. Hopkinson, 289\r\n  S.C. 549, 554-55, 347 S.E.2d 508, 511 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Estate first claims the master did not have\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to quiet title to the Property because his ruling\r\n  necessarily involved a determination of intestate heirs, which can only be\r\n  decided by the probate court.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe Estate filed an action in circuit court &quot;for\r\n  the purposes of quieting and confirming title to the [P]roperty . . . and\r\n  confirming the southern boundary line thereto . . . .&quot;[4]Â  An action to quiet title is\r\n  governed by section 15-67-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  Pursuant to\r\n  section 15-67-10, \r\n\r\nAny person in possession of real property . . . or any\r\n  person having or claiming title to vacant or unoccupied real property may bring\r\n  an action against any person who claims or who may or could claim an estate or\r\n  interest therein or a lien thereon adverse to him for the purpose of\r\n  determining such adverse claim and the rights of the parties, respectively.Â  \r\n\r\nOnce\r\n  the Estate filed this action, the circuit court was required to refer the\r\n  action to a master-in-equity to first determine rightful ownership of the Property\r\n  and then to enter final judgment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-60 (2005)\r\n  (&quot;In all actions brought\r\n  under this article the court, or a judge thereof, shall refer the action to a\r\n  master or special referee to take the testimony as to the plaintiff's claim or\r\n  title and as to all the facts and circumstances unless the testimony shall be\r\n  taken in open court and carefully inquire as to the existence of claim by and\r\n  residence of all nonresidents.&quot;); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-85\r\n  (Supp. 2010) (&quot;When some or all of the causes of action in a case are\r\n  referred to a master-in-equity or special referee, the master or referee shall\r\n  enter final judgment as to those causes of action and an appeal from an order\r\n  or judgment of the master or referee must be to the Supreme Court or the court\r\n  of appeals . . . .&quot;).Â  \r\nWhile the Estate claims the master improperly asserted\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction in contravention of section 62-1-302(a)(1) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2009)[5] when the master found &quot;Florence Major acquired an intestate share in the\r\n  Scipio Josiah estate,&quot; we find this argument unpersuasive. Â \r\nThe master was not required to make a determination of\r\n  heirs to establish rightful ownership of the Property.Â  In order to identify\r\n  the subject matter of the grant, and as such, whether Penn had paramount title\r\n  to the disputed land, the master had to determine whether the R.R. Legare deed\r\n  was in the chain of title and constituted a conveyance out of Sub Lot 8.Â  See Powers v. Rawles, 119 S.C. 134, 156, 112 S.E. 78,\r\n  86 (1922) (&quot;The sole purpose of a\r\n  description of land as contained in a deed is to identify the subject-matter of\r\n  the grant.&quot;). Â Accordingly, the master recited certain lineage that was\r\n  already documented in the R.R. Legare deed and the property record card in an\r\n  effort to identify the exact location of the Property.Â  See Richardson\r\n    v. Register, 227 S.C. 81, 88, 87 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1955) (parol evidence is admissible to\r\n  elucidate latent ambiguities in written instruments).\r\nSpecifically, the R.R. Legare deed conveyed roughly\r\n  six acres to Penn, described as &quot;the same land inherited by Florence Major\r\n  from her grandfather, Scipio Josiah . . . and . . . bounded by Penn School\r\n  lands, by the 'Corner' by land of Rachel Simmons and by land of William\r\n  Josiah.&quot;Â  The property record card for William Josiah stated, &quot;left\r\n  daughter, Florence, who married Tom Major . . . Lot 8 Corner from [William's]\r\n  father, Scipio Josiah&quot; and later noted a conveyance &quot;to F.R. Ford on\r\n  January 5, 1932.&quot;Â  While the deed and property record card appear to\r\n  conflict on whether Florence acquired her share of the estate directly from her\r\n  grandfather, Scipio, or directly from her father, William, this discrepancy is\r\n  immaterial for purposes of determining whether Penn or the Estate possessed\r\n  paramount title. Â Moreover, we note the Estate never contested the validity,\r\n  accuracy, or recordation of the 1916 deed at trial.Â  The Estate's attempt to\r\n  bootstrap its subject matter jurisdiction claim to evidence that it never contested\r\n  prior to this appeal is unpersuasive, particularly when the deed and the\r\n  property record card establish Florence Major had ownership rights to\r\n  approximately six acres that were described in both documents as the\r\n  &quot;Corner&quot; of Lot 8.Â  Because the R.R. Legare deed expressly conveyed\r\n  six acres in Lot 8 owned by Florence Major to Penn, it was reasonable for the\r\n  master to conclude the disputed 6.2 acres is the same six acres conveyed to\r\n  Penn in 1916.Â  \r\nOther evidence supports this conclusion as well.Â Â  Each\r\n  deed in the Estate's chain of title conveyed a total of eighteen acres.Â  The\r\n  partition deed between Edward and James Major divided eighteen acres, which\r\n  indicates the 6.2 acres of disputed land was not a part of the Estate's chain\r\n  of title.Â  If F.R. Ford had received title to the Property, which he\r\n  then conveyed to Edward and James Major, we conclude it would be reasonable for\r\n  the specified acreage in the deed to be greater than eighteen acres.Â  See Von Elbrecht v. Jacobs, 286 S.C. 240, 243, 332 S.E.2d 568, 570 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985). (&quot;[A] grantor of real property generally can transfer no greater\r\n  interest than he himself has in the property.&quot;).Â  Moreover, both the 1932\r\n  and 1936 deeds expressly described the eighteen acres as being bound on both\r\n  the east and the south by &quot;the lands of Penn School.&quot;Â  This\r\n  description is consistent with the master's finding that R.R. Legare conveyed\r\n  these southern six acres in Sub Lot 8 to Penn in 1916, prior to the 1932 and\r\n  1936 deeds to the Majors.Â  In addition, Penn's recorded plats all support the\r\n  master's conclusions. The 1905 plat illustrated Penn's northernmost boundary as\r\n  land bordering, but not including, the disputed 6.2 acres.Â  The 1967 plat, on\r\n  the other hand, included the disputed 6.2 acres, which is consistent with Penn's\r\n  claim that it acquired the Property in 1916.Â  See King v. Hawkins,\r\n  282 S.C. 508, 510, 319 S.E.2d 361, 362 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding party was\r\n  record owner of property when deed matched recorded plats indicating disputed\r\n  property was owned by the party and party's predecessors in interest).Â  Last,\r\n  Penn had been in possession of this land for over thirty-five years without any\r\n  adverse claims of ownership by the Estate, which lends support for the master's\r\n  conclusion that Penn was the rightful owner of the Property. Â Because the\r\n  foregoing evidence reasonably supports the master's finding that Penn possessed\r\n  fee simple title to the Property, we affirm the master's decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the master-in-equity's order\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For ease of reference, this court refers to &quot;Lot\r\n  8&quot; as the original eighteen acres, &quot;Sub Lot 8&quot; as the 14.13\r\n  acres, and &quot;the Property&quot; as the disputed 6.2 acres that is in the\r\n  southern portion of Sub Lot 8. Â \r\n[2] The record reflects the Estate owns exactly 7.93\r\n  acres.Â  \r\n[3] Penn initially asserted in its Answer and\r\n  Counterclaim that it obtained title from Jane Chisolm in 1959. Penn orally\r\n  amended its Answer and Counterclaim, without objection, at trial to allege a\r\n  conveyance from R.R. Legare to Penn by deed dated October 12, 1916.Â  Â Â \r\n[4] A review of the Estate's complaint and the parties'\r\n  briefs establish the main purpose of this suit was to determine title to the\r\n  disputed 6.2 acres.Â  We find the boundary line question is incident to the\r\n  action to quiet title.Â  See Knox v. Bogan, 322 S.C. 64, 67, 472\r\n  S.E.2d 43, 45 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding disputed boundary lines may either be\r\n  directly or indirectly judicially settled in actions to quiet title).Â  \r\n[5] Section 62-1-302(a)(1) grants &quot;the probate court\r\n  . . . exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related to . . .[the] determination of heirs and successors of decedents . . . .&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4839","title":"Martinez v.

[But] [w]e were friends, and we were associates, and it's\r\n  a police officer.&quot;Â  After conducting the investigation, Martinez stated\r\n  she cried about the child on the same night of the accident investigation and\r\n  experienced nightmares. \r\nCaptain\r\n  Stephen Denton, a twenty-year law enforcement veteran, testified the April 4,\r\n  2005 accident investigation ranked emotionally as the worst investigation in\r\n  his career.Â  In addition, he stated this accident was not ordinary because of\r\n  Anthony Johnson's prior affiliation with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's\r\n  Office.Â  Moreover, Captain Denton indicated he noticed a change in Martinez'\r\n  demeanor on the date of the accident.Â  Specifically, Captain Denton stated,\r\n\r\n  I can't imagine\r\n    anybody that was present at the scene felt too good, you know, for days to\r\n    follow.Â  You don't understand that unless you've seen it, and so it's very hard\r\n    for someone else to judge that, that had not seen it.Â  However, given a\r\n    reasonable amount of time to recuperate from something like that â€“ and I don't\r\n    know what reasonable is, but within a week, week and a half, I could see that,\r\n    you know, obviously, she was depressed, and within [a couple] three weeks, it\r\n    showed in her work, in her habits.Â  \r\n\r\nNonetheless,\r\n  Captain Denton stated Martinez was fulfilling her ordinary job duties when she\r\n  took photographs and measurements of the scene and moved the child's body.Â  He\r\n  also stated the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office does not have a procedure\r\n  that prohibits employees from working scenes involving victims they know.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Single Commissioner concluded the April 4, 2005 investigation was not an\r\n  &quot;unusual or extraordinary&quot; condition of Martinez' employment.Â  The\r\n  Single Commissioner also found Martinez failed to prove the April 4, 2005\r\n  investigation was the proximate cause of her mental breakdown.Â  The Workers' Compensation Commission Appellate Panel\r\n  (Appellate Panel) adopted the Single Commissioner's findings of fact and\r\n  affirmed the Single Commissioner's order in its entirety.Â  On appeal, the circuit\r\n  court reversed and remanded the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â  The circuit\r\n  court concluded the Single Commissioner's order was not sufficiently detailed\r\n  to enable appellate review, and was left to speculate whether the proper\r\n  analysis was applied by the Single Commissioner.Â  The circuit court also\r\n  concluded even if the Single Commissioner's findings were appropriate, the\r\n  findings focused on the ordinary aspects of Martinez' job and not whether\r\n  Martinez' work was unusual compared to her particular employment.Â  The circuit\r\n  court further concluded the Single Commissioner's order was deficient as a\r\n  matter of law on the issue of proximate cause, and the only conclusion that\r\n  could be drawn from the evidence was that the April 4, 2005 investigation proximately\r\n  caused her mental breakdown.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). The Commission is the ultimate\r\n  fact finder in workers' compensation cases and is not bound by the Single\r\n  Commissioner's findings of fact.Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C.\r\n  451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The findings of the commission\r\n  are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Sufficiency of\r\n  the Order\r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, Spartanburg County contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  concluding the Single Commissioner's order was not sufficiently detailed to\r\n  enable appellate review.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  findings of fact made by the Appellate Panel must be sufficiently detailed to\r\n  enable the reviewing court to determine whether the evidence supports the\r\n  findings.Â  Frame v. Resort Serv. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 531, 593 S.E.2d\r\n  491, 497 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  &quot;Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory\r\n  language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the\r\n  underlying facts supporting the findings.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2005).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court's order stated, \r\n\r\n  In his Order,\r\n    the Single Commissioner made three Findings of Fact which were relevant to the\r\n    decision.Â  Finding of Fact 14 was &quot;investigating the death of a child,\r\n    even the child of a former Sheriff's deputy, was not an unusual or\r\n    extraordinary condition of Claimant's employment&quot;; [Finding of Fact] 15\r\n    was Claimant failed to prove she encountered an unusual or extraordinary\r\n    condition in her employment on April 4, 2005; and [Finding of Fact] 16 was\r\n    Claimant failed to prove the accident investigation of April 4, 2005 was the\r\n    proximate cause of her mental breakdown.Â  The Single Commissioner gave no basis\r\n    for his factual conclusion in Finding of Fact 14, and as to Findings of Fact 15\r\n    and 16, he simply stated to each of these two Findings of Fact that\r\n    &quot;[T]his finding is based on all the evident [sic] in the record.&quot;Â  \r\n  .Â  .Â  . \r\n  Here, even\r\n    though the orders from the Commission give a summary of some of the testimony\r\n    presented during the hearing, no basis for the Finding[s] of Fact 14, 15, and\r\n    16 is provided and, thus, this Court is left to speculate if the proper\r\n    analysis was applied by the Commission and whether the factual conclusions upon\r\n    which the law was applied has a substantial basis in the record.Â  [footnote\r\n    omitted]Â  When an administrative agency acts without first making proper\r\n    factual findings as required by law, the proper procedure is to remand the case\r\n    and allow the agency the opportunity to make these findings.Â  [citation\r\n    omitted]\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court's order only emphasizes Findings of Fact 14, 15, and 16 as\r\n  relevant to the Single Commissioner's decision.Â  However, the Single\r\n  Commissioner's order provides seventeen pages of evidence, sixteen findings of\r\n  fact, and conclusions of law to support its decision.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  circuit court ignored other findings of fact the Single Commissioner discussed\r\n  on the issue of whether Martinez experienced an &quot;unusual or\r\n  extraordinary&quot; condition in her particular employment.Â  These findings of\r\n  fact provide a sufficient basis to allow appellate review.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  Single Commissioner's order provides,\r\n\r\n  Finding of Fact\r\n    5\r\n  Claimant had\r\n    been to an investigation previously while working for the Greenville County\r\n    Sheriff's Department in which a child's head had been run over by a dump\r\n    truck.Â  Claimant testified that the accident did not bother her.Â  She stated\r\n    that if that type of situation bothered her, she would have never chosen to be\r\n    a forensic investigator.\r\n  Finding of Fact\r\n    6\r\n  Claimant had\r\n    investigated and worked up approximately 100-150 death cases in her 3-4 years\r\n    as a forensic investigator.Â  She had also investigated approximately 24\r\n    suspicious death/homicide cases and participated in approximately 24-26\r\n    autopsies.Â  These investigations were a usual and ordinary part of her job.Â  Claimant\r\n    also testified about an investigation of an automobile accident in which an\r\n    injured teenager had died in her arms.\r\n  Finding of Fact\r\n    7\r\n  When Claimant\r\n    went to a crime scene, she would take up to 100 photographs and move the body\r\n    to investigate anything underneath the body.Â  She also took measurements and\r\n    put up barriers to prevent people from seeing the accident scene.Â  This was a\r\n    part of her usual and ordinary job.\r\n  Finding of Fact\r\n    10 \r\n  CPT Steve Denton\r\n    testified that the accident scene of the child's death on April 4, 2005 was a\r\n    terrible sight but that Claimant was doing her ordinary job that day in\r\n    investigating the death of the child.Â  CPT Denton required the Claimant to stay\r\n    and perform the accident investigation because that was her job.Â  The fact that\r\n    the death scene involved the death of a child of a former Spartanburg County\r\n    Deputy Sheriff did not remove the situation from being a part of her regular\r\n    job.Â  \r\n  Finding of Fact\r\n    11 \r\n  Spartanburg\r\n    County Sheriff's Office had no rule prohibiting its employees from going to\r\n    accident scenes where they knew the victim.Â  CPT Denton testified that he had\r\n    always maintained and still maintained that no matter who the victim was, the\r\n    Sheriff's Department investigators were required to work the accident scene.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  foregoing findings of fact from the Single Commissioner's order were sufficient\r\n  to enable appellate review, such that the underlying reasons supporting the\r\n  Single Commissioner's conclusion were not left to speculation.Â  Consequently,\r\n  we find the circuit court erred in concluding the Single Commissioner's order\r\n  was deficient in this regard.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â &quot;Unusual\r\n  or Extraordinary&quot; Condition of Employment\r\nSpartanburg\r\n  County contends the circuit court erred in concluding Martinez experienced an\r\n  &quot;unusual or extraordinary&quot; condition in her particular employment.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nMental\r\n  or nervous disorders are compensable provided the emotional stimuli or\r\n  stressors are incident to or arise from &quot;unusual or extraordinary&quot;\r\n  conditions of employment.Â  Doe v. S.C. Dep't of Disabilities &amp; Special\r\n    Needs, 377 S.C. 346, 349, 660 S.E.2d 260, 262 (2008).Â  The requirement of\r\n  &quot;unusual or extraordinary&quot; conditions in employment, for a claimant\r\n  to recover for a &quot;mental-mental&quot; injury refers to conditions of the\r\n  particular job in which the injury occurs, not to conditions of employment in\r\n  general.Â  Frame, 357 S.C at 529, 593 S.E.2d at 496.Â  To recover for mental injuries caused solely by\r\n  emotional stress, or &quot;mental-mental&quot; injuries,\r\n  the claimant must show she was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in her employment and these unusual and extraordinary conditions were the proximate cause of her mental disorder.Â  Tennant v.\r\n    Beaufort Cnty. Sch. Dist., 381 S.C. 617, 621, 674 S.E.2d 488,\r\n  490&nbsp;(2009).\r\nThe\r\n  Single Commissioner found Martinez did not experience an &quot;unusual or\r\n  extraordinary&quot; condition in her employment on April 4, 2005 because\r\n  Martinez took photographs and measurements of the investigation scene and moved\r\n  the child's body.Â  Additionally, the Single Commissioner noted Martinez witnessed\r\n  autopsies, previously investigated twenty-four suspicious death/homicide cases,\r\n  and worked approximately one-hundred to one-hundred and fifty death cases.Â  The\r\n  Single Commissioner also noted the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office did not\r\n  have a rule prohibiting its employees from investigating scenes in which they\r\n  knew the victim.Â  Martinez does not dispute her job duties during the April 4,\r\n  2005 investigation were within her ordinary employment.Â  However, Martinez\r\n  contends the April 4, 2005 investigation was an &quot;unusual or\r\n  extraordinary&quot; condition of her employment because the child's father,\r\n  Anthony Johnson, was a former co-worker at the Spartanburg County Sheriff's\r\n  Office.\r\nWhile\r\n  we empathize with the undoubtedly difficult nature of Martinez' job, we find\r\n  Martinez' argument unpersuasive.Â  Despite the tragic nature of the accident,\r\n  the Single Commissioner found that based on Martinez' testimony, Martinez and\r\n  Anthony Johnson's friendship was not such a close degree as to render the\r\n  investigation an unusual and extraordinary condition of employment.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the Single Commissioner stated in Finding of Fact 4:\r\n\r\n  Claimant\r\n    contended that working the death case of a child who was run over by a fellow\r\n    police officer was unusual and extraordinary.Â  She stated that police officers\r\n    have a &quot;special bond.&quot;Â  However, Claimant was not a close friend of\r\n    the fellow officer, Anthony Johnson, although she worked on the same shift, and\r\n    they would occasionally see each other at shift changes.Â  She did not\r\n    personally know the officer's wife or child, had never visited their home, and\r\n    had never socialized with Anthony Johnson or his family.Â  \r\n\r\nMoreover,\r\n  Captain Denton testified about the Spartanburg County Sheriff Office's\r\n  procedure regarding investigations of victims that are acquainted with\r\n  employees.Â  Specifically, Captain Denton stated that, while in hindsight it may\r\n  not have been the best protocol, he always required detectives to investigate\r\n  incidents regardless of their relationship with the victims.[3]Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the evidence in the record, we conclude there is substantial evidence to\r\n  support the Single Commissioner's finding that Martinez did not suffer an\r\n  &quot;unusual or extraordinary&quot; condition of her particular employment.Â  Taylor\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 36, 627 S.E.2d 751, 752 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (stating substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence,\r\n  nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence\r\n  that, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach\r\n  the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its\r\n  action).Â  \r\nBecause we reverse the circuit court and conclude\r\n  there is substantial evidence that Martinez did not suffer an &quot;unusual or\r\n  extraordinary&quot; condition in her particular employment, we need not address\r\n  the issue of proximate cause.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\n    of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating\r\n  an appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\n  a decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's decision is\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  REVERSED.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SHORT,\r\n  J., concurs.Â  FEW, C.J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., concurring:Â \r\n  I concur in the portion of the majority opinion addressing the sufficiency of\r\n  the commission's order.Â  I also agree with the majority that the circuit court\r\n  erred in reversing the commission.Â  I write separately to address what I\r\n  believe is the basis of the circuit court's ruling that Investigator Martinez'\r\n  employment conditions were extraordinary and unusual.Â  The circuit court did\r\n  not rule on the basis of a lack of substantial evidence supporting the\r\n  commission's factual finding.Â  Rather, the circuit court reversed the\r\n  commission on a question of law, finding the commission &quot;failed to conduct\r\n  the proper analysis.&quot;Â  I also write to explain that the circuit court\r\n  erred in reversing the commission's finding of a lack of proximate cause.Â  \r\n\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Unusual or\r\n  Extraordinary&quot; Conditions of Employment\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court reversed the commission's determination that Investigator\r\n  Martinez' stressful employment conditions were not extraordinary and unusual\r\n  based on a point of law, not based on the sufficiency of the evidence.Â  In the\r\n  introductory section of the order, before even describing the facts, the\r\n  circuit court stated &quot;the decision of this Court is that the Order from\r\n  the Full Commission should be reversed because the analysis . . . is flawed by\r\n  misapplying, as a matter of law, the 'unusual or extraordinary\r\n  conditions of employment' test for determining compensability of mental\r\n  injuries.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  The circuit court made several other\r\n  statements that it was ruling on a point of law and ultimately concluded:\r\n  &quot;The Commission's Order in the present case is void of [the analysis\r\n  required by Doe v. SCDDSN[4]]\r\n  and, therefore, as a matter of law, is reversed.&quot;Â  The circuit court never\r\n  mentioned the substantial evidence standard nor even attempted to explain that\r\n  the evidence was not sufficient to support the commission's decision.Â  As\r\n  Appellant stated in its brief, &quot;the Circuit Court never addressed the\r\n  Commission's findings of fact and never determined whether the findings were\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.&quot;Â  Rather, the circuit court ruled that\r\n  the commission committed a legal error in its analysis of whether Investigator\r\n  Martinez' conditions of employment were extraordinary and unusual.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court erred in reversing the commission on this point of law.Â  Its\r\n  ruling is based on a misapplication of the reasoning of Doe to the facts\r\n  of this case.Â  The only aspect of Investigator Martinez' employment conditions\r\n  alleged to be extraordinary and unusual is the nature and character of the\r\n  April 4, 2005 investigation.Â  Otherwise, there is no suggestion that she\r\n  encountered anything extraordinary or unusual in her work.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Investigator Martinez does not allege any change in her employment conditions\r\n  over the long term.Â  \r\nDoe, on the other\r\n    hand, was based on a change in the claimant's long-term employment conditions.Â \r\n  The claimant in Doe was employed by the South Carolina Department of\r\n    Disabilities and Special Needs as a licensed practical nurse.Â  377 S.C. at 348,\r\n    660 S.E.2d at 261. Â After\r\n    she worked there for approximately eighteen years, the Department began to make\r\n    changes in the operation of her facility, resulting in a dramatic increase in\r\n    the level of noise and violence in her unit.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n  As a\r\n    result [of the changes], the patient population in Claimant's unit changed from\r\n    being a passive group to a mixed group of passive and aggressive patients.Â  The\r\n    record indicates Claimant's unit went from being &quot;a fairly pleasant unit\r\n    to work in&quot; to being &quot;kind of a dumping ground&quot; where none of\r\n    the other nurses wanted to work.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The supreme court found that the conditions of the claimant's\r\n  employment were extraordinary and unusual as a result of the changes at her\r\n  facility.Â  The supreme court discounted the fact that many of the individual\r\n  incidents in the claimant's new environment were the same as before and focused\r\n  on what was different about the new environment.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    record indicates that in the spring of 1997, with the new mix of passive and\r\n    aggressive patients in Claimant's unit, behavior problems escalated because of\r\n    the &quot;domino effect&quot; created when an aggressive patient acted out.Â \r\n    Claimant had never before worked with a mix of passive and aggressive\r\n    patients.Â  No other unit had a mix of passive and aggressive patients.Â  In fact,\r\n    Department made changes after a DHEC survey criticized Department for housing\r\n    diverse patients together.\r\n\r\n377\r\n  S.C. at 350, 660 S.E.2d at 262. Â \r\nThe\r\n  supreme court faulted the commission and the court of appeals for focusing on\r\n  the fact that nurses had always dealt with aggressive patients and had even\r\n  been injured by them before.Â  Id.Â  Thus, the supreme court rejected an\r\n  analysis of similarities in individual incidents and focused instead on the\r\n  differences caused by changes in long-term conditions.Â  Id. (&quot;A review\r\n  of the record, however, indicates that the testimony [of similarities in\r\n  individual incidents] relied upon is taken completely out of context and does not support the Court\r\n  of Appeals' conclusion.&quot;).Â  Focusing on the changes in overall,\r\n  long-term employment conditions, the supreme court noted that neither of the\r\n  two witnesses relied on by the court of appeals testified &quot;that it was\r\n  usual for a nurse to deal with a mix of passive and aggressive\r\n  patients.&quot;Â  377\r\n  S.C. at 350-51, 660 S.E.2d at 262 (emphasis added). Â The supreme\r\n  court found the overall, long-term changes in employment conditions resulting\r\n  in a &quot;mix of passive and aggressive patients&quot; was an extraordinary\r\n  and unusual condition of employment which caused the claimant's mental-mental\r\n  injury and instructed the commission to award benefits.Â  377 S.C. at\r\n  351-52, 660 S.E.2d at 262-63.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the commission applied the proper test for determining whether Investigator\r\n  Martinez' conditions of employment were extraordinary and unusual.Â  See Shealy\r\n    v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 459, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444 (2000) (holding the\r\n  standard to be applied is whether the conditions of employment were\r\n  extraordinary or unusual compared to the normal conditions of claimant's\r\n  employment); see also Doe, 377 S.C. at 349-50, 660 S.E.2d at 262\r\n  (discussing Shealy).Â  The commission described some of the\r\n  investigations which &quot;were a usual and ordinary part of [Investigator\r\n  Martinez'] job.&quot;Â  Those investigations included one &quot;in which a\r\n  child's head had been run over by a dump truck&quot; and &quot;an automobile\r\n  accident in which an injured teenager had died in her arms.&quot;Â  The majority\r\n  described other similar investigations conducted by Investigator Martinez.Â \r\n  Describing how she conducted investigations such as those, the commission made\r\n  this factual finding:\r\n\r\n  7. When claimant\r\n    went to a crime scene, she would take up to 100 photographs and move the body\r\n    to investigate anything underneath the body.Â  She also took measurements and\r\n    put up barriers to prevent people from seeing the accident scene.Â  This was a\r\n    part of her usual and ordinary job.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  commission then focused on whether what she did on April 4, 2005, was\r\n  extraordinary and unusual compared to her usual and ordinary job and made this\r\n  factual finding:\r\n\r\n  10. [Captain]\r\n    Steve Denton testified that the accident scene of the child's death on April 4,\r\n    2005 was a terrible sight but that Claimant was doing her ordinary job that day\r\n    in investigating the death of the child.Â  [Captain] Denton required the\r\n    Claimant to stay and perform the accident investigation because that was her\r\n    job.Â  The fact that the death scene involved the death of a child of a former\r\n    Spartanburg County Deputy Sheriff did not remove the situation from being a\r\n    part of her regular job.Â  \r\n\r\nIn Doe, the supreme court ruled that despite the similarities in individual\r\n  incidents, there were changes in the overall, long-term conditions of the\r\n  claimant's employment, making the conditions which caused the injury\r\n  extraordinary and unusual.Â  377 S.C. at 349-50, 660 S.E.2d at 262.Â  Here,\r\n  Investigator Martinez does not argue that there were any long-term changes.Â \r\n  Rather, she argues that her mental-mental injury arose out of a single\r\n  investigation.Â  When she finished this particular investigation, she continued\r\n  working on the same type of cases in the same manner as before.Â  Had she been\r\n  switched to an overall pattern of investigating only particularly traumatic\r\n  cases, then perhaps the reasoning of Doe would apply.Â  Under these\r\n  facts, however, it does not.\r\nFinally,\r\n  I emphasize that one particular event in a claimant's work environment can\r\n  constitute extraordinary and unusual conditions such that any resulting\r\n  mental-mental injury would be compensable.Â  See, e.g., Powell v.\r\n    Vulcan Materials Co., 299 S.C. 325, 326, 384 S.E.2d 725, 725 (1989)\r\n  (affirming commission's award of benefits where claimant suffered &quot;mental,\r\n  emotional, and psychological injury&quot; following a single-incident verbal\r\n  altercation with a supervisor).Â  In such a case, however, whether the\r\n  individual event meets the test for extraordinary and unusual set forth by the\r\n  supreme court in Shealy is a question of fact for the commission to\r\n  decide.Â  On appeal from the commission's decision, if substantial evidence\r\n  supports it, an appellate court must affirm.Â  Forrest\r\n    v. A.S. Price Mech., 373 S.C. 303,\r\n  306, 644 S.E.2d 784, 785-86 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In this case, the circuit court\r\n  never ruled as to whether substantial evidence supports the commission's\r\n  decision that Investigator Martinez' conditions of employment were not\r\n  extraordinary and unusual.Â  As the majority has explained, the commission's\r\n  decision is supported by substantial evidence.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proximate Cause\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court also reversed the commission's finding of a lack of proximate cause.Â \r\n  The circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    Commission's finding [as to proximate cause] is clearly erroneous, applying the\r\n    substantial evidence standard of review, because the only conclusion that can\r\n    be drawn from the medical information is that there exists the necessary\r\n    showing of proximate cause to link the accident investigation of her friend's\r\n    child's death and her mental breakdown. \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  making this statement, the circuit court ignored the following findings of fact\r\n  made by the commission:Â  \r\n\r\n  8. Claimant had\r\n    other stressors in April 2005 that were not work related, including the death\r\n    from AIDS of her ex-husband's cousin with whom she was very close.Â  Claimant\r\n    was treated for anxiety, insomnia, and depression from these non-work related\r\n    situational stressors including medications and hospitalization.\r\n  9. Claimant did\r\n    not mention the investigation involving the death of a child on April 4, 2005\r\n    until approximately four months later after being hospitalized for an emotional\r\n    breakdown.\r\n  16.Â Claimant\r\n    failed to prove that the accident investigation on April 4, 2005 was the\r\n    proximate cause of her mental breakdown, said finding being based on all the\r\n    evidence in the record.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  record contains ample evidence to support these findings.Â  For example, on\r\n  April 19, 2005, two weeks after Investigator Martinez' investigation into the\r\n  death of her fellow officer's child, she went to her family doctor for stress.Â \r\n  In the medical note for that visit, the doctor wrote:\r\n\r\n  She is very\r\n    upset and crying.Â  A very close friend and relative, a cousin with whom she was\r\n    very close over the years, passed away yesterday.Â  She is very upset about it.Â \r\n    They were very close ever since they were little kids.Â  She is very upset that\r\n    she did not get to the hospital in time to say goodbye before he passed away.Â  \r\n\r\nInvestigator\r\n  Martinez returned to her family doctor on eight occasions between April 25 and\r\n  June 24, 2005, and did not mention stress from the April 4 investigation even\r\n  once.Â  On August 7, 2005, Investigator Martinez was admitted to Spartanburg\r\n  Regional Medical Center for &quot;behavior suggesting psychiatric\r\n  problems.&quot;Â  Her treating psychiatrist diagnosed her with Benzodiazepine\r\n  withdrawal delirium, depression, and anxiety disorder.Â  In the discharge\r\n  summary on August 9, 2005, the psychiatrist stated: &quot;The patient\r\n  apparently had recent problems with uncontrollable hypertension and also had\r\n  problems with anxiety, insomnia and depression related to the death of her best\r\n  friend who apparently was a male cousin.&quot;Â  Martinez was admitted to the\r\n  Carolina Center for Behavioral Health for a psychiatric evaluation on August\r\n  10, 2005.Â  One of the forms filled out for this admission contains a section\r\n  entitled &quot;Precipitating Events,&quot; in which it is noted that Martinez\r\n  stated: &quot;My cousin died mid April 2005 and I took Xanax for my nerves.Â  I\r\n  stopped taking Xanax 1-2 weeks ago and became psychotic.&quot;Â  \r\nThese\r\n  medical records contain no mention of the April 4, 2005 investigation or any\r\n  other job-related stress.Â  In light of these facts, the commission's\r\n  determination that the claimant failed to prove proximate cause is supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.Â  The circuit court erred in reversing the finding. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although the accident occurred in Greer, South\r\n  Carolina, the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office conducted the forensic\r\n  investigation because the Greer Police Department did not have a forensic\r\n  unit.Â  \r\n[3] Martinez did\r\n  not know Anthony Johnson's daughter.Â  Therefore, the lack of a personal\r\n  relationship is additional evidence that Martinez did not experience an\r\n  &quot;unusual or extraordinary condition&quot; on April 4, 2005 because the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office policy specifically contemplates employees\r\n  investigating scenes in which they are acquainted with the victim.\r\n[4] Doe v.

Kitts Construction (Employer) and the South\r\n  Carolina Home Builders Self-Insured Fund (Carrier) (collectively Appellants) seek\r\n  review of the circuit court's order affirming a decision of the South Carolina\r\n  Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission).Â  The Commission's decision\r\n  required Appellants to pay medical expenses incurred by Phillip Tims (Claimant)\r\n  related to heatstroke he suffered while in the care of a home health worker provided\r\n  by Appellants. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nAppellants\r\n  began paying medical benefits and lifetime indemnity benefits to Claimant in\r\n  2006 after he fell from a twelve-foot scaffold at work and sustained a spinal\r\n  cord injury resulting in quadriplegia.Â  Claimant stayed at Greenville Memorial\r\n  Hospital for approximately five weeks and at a rehabilitation facility for the\r\n  next three months.Â  He then began living in the home of his former wife,\r\n  Patricia Holcombe (Mrs. Holcombe), and Appellants began providing home healthcare\r\n  services as prescribed by Claimant's treating physician.Â  After using other\r\n  home healthcare providers for Claimant, Appellants insisted on using HomeWatch\r\n  Caregivers of Greenville (HomeWatch).Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 9, 2007, when the outside temperature approached a hundred degrees, a HomeWatch caregiver, Dana Earle, took Claimant on an outing to\r\n  Wal-Mart at his request.Â  While there, Earle realized she had lost her car keys\r\n  and left Claimant in the back seat of her unair-conditioned car while she went\r\n  to look for them.Â  By the time Earle returned with Claimant to Mrs. Holcombe's\r\n  home, Claimant was unconscious.Â  \r\nClaimant\r\n  was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital, where he was diagnosed as being in a\r\n  coma due to heatstroke.[1]Â \r\n  He came out of the coma approximately one week later, but then lapsed back into\r\n  a coma.Â  At the time of the hearing before the single commissioner, Claimant\r\n  had come out of his coma but was still at the hospital, on a ventilator and unable\r\n  to speak, and had incurred some brain damage.Â  \r\nClaimant sought\r\n  medical benefits related to his heatstroke, and Appellants denied this claim.Â \r\n  The single commissioner ordered Appellants to pay these benefits, and the\r\n  Appellate Panel affirmed the order.Â  The Appellate Panel found that Claimant's heatstroke\r\n  was a natural consequence of his original work-related injuryâ€”his quadriplegiaâ€”because\r\n  it prevented him from extricating himself from his caregiver's overheated car.Â \r\n  The circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel's order to pay the benefits.[2]Â  This\r\n  appeal followed. Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp; Did\r\n    the Appellate Panel commit an error of law in concluding that Claimant's heatstroke\r\n    was within the compensable range of foreseeable consequences of his original\r\n    work-related injury?\r\n  II.&nbsp; Was\r\n    the Appellate Panel's finding of fact that Claimant's heatstroke was a natural\r\n    consequence of his original work-related injury supported by substantial\r\n    evidence in the record?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard for judicial review of\r\n  decisions by the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission.&nbsp; See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n  (1981).&nbsp; Specifically, section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2010) provides that this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\n  Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\n  reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.[3]&nbsp; See Hamilton v.\r\n    Bob Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 76,\r\n  518 S.E.2d 599, 600-01&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1999), modified on other grounds,\r\n  339 S.C. 68, 528 S.E.2d 667&nbsp;(2000), (interpreting Â§\r\n  1-23-380).Â  Section 1-23-380 allows reversal of a factual finding of the\r\n  Appellate Panel only if it is &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.&quot;\r\nIn workers' compensation substantial evidence. Â Substantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering\r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n  agency reached.\r\nPierre v. Seaside Farms,\r\n  Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618&nbsp;(2010) (citations\r\n  and internal quotations marks omitted).\r\nIn reviewing\r\n  workers' compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains &quot;whether\r\n  the circuit court properly determined whether the [A]ppellate [P]anel's\r\n  findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and\r\n  whether the [P]anel's decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;&nbsp; Baxter\r\n    v. Martin Bros., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (citations omitted).[4]&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\n  appellate court is prohibited from overturning findings of fact by the\r\n  Appellate Panel unless there is no\r\n  reasonable probability the facts could be as related by the witness upon whose\r\n  testimony the finding was based. Â Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second\r\n    Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612,\r\n  621, 611 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The\r\n  Appellate Panel's factual findings will normally be upheld; however, such a\r\n  finding may not be based upon surmise, conjecture, or speculation, but must be\r\n  founded on evidence of sufficient substance to afford a reasonable basis for it.Â  Sharpe\r\n    v. Case Produce Co., 329 S.C. 534,\r\n  543, 495 S.E.2d 790, 794 (Ct. App. 1997), rev'd on\r\n    other grounds, 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102&nbsp;(1999).\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Error of Law\r\nAppellants\r\n  assert that the Appellate Panel committed an error of law in concluding that\r\n  Claimant's heatstroke was within the range of compensable consequences of his\r\n  original work-related injury. Â Appellants argue two independent, intervening\r\n  causes of Claimant's heatstroke broke the chain of legal causation:[5] (1) Claimant's &quot;unreasonable&quot;\r\n  decision to ride in his caregiver's car without air-conditioning on an\r\n  extremely hot day, and (2) the caregiver's negligent or criminal behavior in\r\n  allowing Claimant to become overheated.Â  We will address each of these\r\n  arguments in turn.\r\nA.Â  Claimant's\r\n  Decision\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend that Claimant's decision to ride in his caretaker's unair-conditioned\r\n  car on a very hot day was unreasonable, and, thus the decision constituted an\r\n  independent, intervening act that was unforeseeable.Â  We disagree.\r\nEvery\r\n  natural consequence that flows from a work-related compensable injury is also\r\n  compensable unless the consequence is the result of an independent, intervening\r\n  cause sufficient to break the chain of causation.Â  Whitfield\r\n    v. Daniel Constr. Co., 226 S.C. 37, 40-41, 83 S.E.2d 460, 462&nbsp;(1954); see also 1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation Law\r\n  Â§ 10.01, 10-1 (2010) (stating that when the primary injury is shown to have\r\n  arisen out of and in the course of employment, every natural consequence that\r\n  flows from the injury likewise arises out of the employment, unless it is the\r\n  result of an independent, intervening cause attributable to the claimant's own\r\n  intentional conduct).\r\n\r\n  Our courts have clearly held the natural consequences flowing from\r\n    a compensable injury, absent an independent intervening cause, are compensable.\r\n    . . . [N]ew injuries resulting indirectly from treatment for the original\r\n    injury are also compensable. . . . [C]ircumstantial\r\n    evidence may be used to prove causation. Â The causal sequence . . . may be more\r\n    indirect or complex, but as long as the causal connection is in fact present\r\n    the compensability of the subsequent condition is beyond question.\r\n\r\nMullinax,\r\n  318 S.C. at 436-37, 458 S.E.2d at 79-80&nbsp;(citations and internal quotation\r\n  marks omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the court must determine whether the &quot;accident&quot;â€“\r\n  becoming trapped in an overheated carâ€“was caused by Claimant's original\r\n  compensable injuryâ€”his quadriplegia.Â  Appellants cite Sanders v. Wal-Mart\r\n    Stores, Inc., in support of their argument that Claimant's decision to ride\r\n  in his caretaker's unair-conditioned car on a very hot day was an independent,\r\n  intervening act that broke the chain of causation.Â  379\r\n  S.C. 554, 666 S.E.2d 297&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2008).Â  We\r\n  believe Sanders is distinguishable.Â  \r\nIn Sanders,\r\n  the claimant had suffered a compensable injury to her knee while descending a\r\n  ladder at work. Â Id. at 557, 666 S.E.2d at 299.Â  After\r\n  the knee injury resolved, the claimant fell down a stairway in her home and again\r\n  injured her knee.Â  Id.Â  The court determined that the claimant's fall\r\n  down the stairway was not caused by her prior knee condition and the fall was\r\n  an intervening act.Â  Id. at 560-61, 666 S.E.2d at 300-01.Â \r\n  Unlike the claimant's fall in Sanders, Claimant's compensable injury,\r\n  quadriplegia, caused his heatstroke because it prevented him from extricating\r\n  himself from an overheated car.Â  Further, Claimant's quadriplegic condition\r\n  continued up to, during, and after the accident for which he claimed\r\n  compensation (becoming trapped in an overheated car and suffering heatstroke).Â \r\n  In contrast, the claimant's original knee injury in Sanders had resolved\r\n  over a year before her fall down the stairway.Â  Id. at 557, 666 S.E.2d\r\n  at 299. \r\nAppellants\r\n  also cite case law from other jurisdictions in support of their argument that\r\n  Claimant's decision to ride in his caretaker's car was unreasonable.[6]Â  However, the present case is\r\n  distinguishable from the facts in the cited cases, most of which illustrate claimants'\r\n  decisions to engage in certain conduct that would likely result in further\r\n  injury.Â  In those cases, the claimant was characterized as having full knowledge\r\n  of the probable consequences of his actions.Â  In the present case, Claimant's\r\n  decision to ride in his caretaker's car cannot be characterized in this manner.Â \r\n  He could not have predicted that his caretaker would leave him in the car while\r\n  she went to look for a set of lost keys.Â  Therefore, Claimant's decision was\r\n  not unreasonable.\r\nB.Â  Caregiver's\r\n  Negligence\r\nAppellants\r\n  also contend the caretaker's negligence was an independent, intervening act\r\n  that was unforeseeable and thus broke the chain of causation.Â  We disagree.\r\nNo\r\n  statute or case in South Carolina specifically addresses injuries caused by the\r\n  negligence of persons other than physicians who are connected with the process\r\n  of treatment or convalescence.[7]Â \r\n  However, other jurisdictions recognize that these injuries are &quot;within the\r\n  compensable range of consequences.&quot;Â  Larson's Â§ 10.09(3),\r\n  10-24 to -25.Â  This includes orderlies, first aid personnel, physical\r\n  therapists, and even hospital maintenance staff.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  Claimant's physician had ordered the services of a home healthcare personal\r\n  staffing company.Â  Carrier engaged the services of Medical Services Company\r\n  (MSC), a business whose job was to locate and employ home healthcare\r\n  companies.Â  In June 2007, MSC hired HomeWatch to provide services to Claimant.Â \r\n  Shortly before June 9, HomeWatch sent Earle to provide these services.Â \r\n  Appellants maintain Earle was nothing more than a &quot;babysitter&quot; and she\r\n  cannot be considered to have been providing &quot;medical treatment&quot; such\r\n  that her negligence was a foreseeable consequence of Claimant's original\r\n  work-related injury.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  services provided by Earle were medically necessary for a quadriplegic who lived\r\n  in a private home rather than in a fully-staffed residential treatment\r\n  facility.Â  Although the services by themselves may not have required any\r\n  heightened degree of skill, they were connected with the process of treatment\r\n  of a quadriplegic, and thus the negligent delivery of these services by\r\n  Appellants' chosen caregiver was a foreseeable consequence of Claimant's\r\n  condition. Â Several weeks before the day of the incident, one of Claimant's\r\n  treating physicians made note of Claimant's psychological problems due to his\r\n  &quot;inability to get out of the house . . . enough,&quot; and various\r\n  physicians had recommended excursions for his emotional well-being.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the June 9 excursion was within the scope of Earle's care of Claimant.Â  Â \r\nAppellants\r\n  also argue that Claimant's written care plan with HomeWatch did not include transportation\r\n  services, and, therefore, it could not be considered part of his treatment.Â \r\n  However, the restrictions of the written care plan did not render Earle's\r\n  provision of transportation unforeseeable.Â  It is foreseeable that a home\r\n  health client may initially indicate no need for transportation but later\r\n  request his caregiver to take him on an errand.\r\nAppellants\r\n  compare this case to a Florida case in which a pedestrian who previously\r\n  suffered a work-related injury requiring him to use crutches was struck by a\r\n  vehicle as he was crossing the street.Â  See D'Angelo\r\n    Plastering Co. v. Isaac, 393 So. 2d 1066, 1068&nbsp;(Fla.&nbsp;1980)\r\n  (holding that the unknown driver's negligence was an independent, intervening\r\n  cause of the claimant's injuries).Â  However, Claimant was not\r\n  injured by the negligence of an independent third party.Â  Rather, he was\r\n  injured by an act of his own caregiver, who was employed by the home health\r\n  company chosen by Appellants.Â  Injuries due to the negligence of non-physicians\r\n  connected with the process of treatment or convalescence are within the\r\n  compensable range of consequences of the original work-related injury. Â Larson's Â§\r\n  10.09(3). \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the Appellate Panel properly concluded that neither Claimant's\r\n  decision to ride in his caregiver's car nor his caregiver's negligence was an\r\n  independent, intervening cause sufficient to break the chain of causation.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantial Evidence\r\nIn\r\n  addition to asserting an error of law on the part of the Appellate Panel, Appellants\r\n  contend that substantial evidence did not support the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  of fact on causation, i.e., whether Claimant's heatstroke was caused by his quadriplegia.Â \r\n  Appellants maintain that the only evidence supporting the Appellate Panel's\r\n  version of the events was Mrs. Holcombe's account of what Earle had told her\r\n  and that Mrs. Holcombe herself doubted the truth of Earle's account.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  workers' compensation cases, the [Appellate Panel] is the ultimate fact finder.&quot;Â  Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp;(2000). Â &quot;The final determination of\r\n  witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the [Appellate\r\n  Panel].&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;It is not the task of this Court to weigh the\r\n  evidence as found by the [Appellate Panel].&quot;Â  Id.Â  Further, the\r\n  trier of fact has the prerogative to believe one part of a witness's testimony\r\n  while simultaneously disbelieving other parts of the same witness's testimony.Â  See Holcombe v. Dan River Mills, 286 S.C. 223, 225, 333\r\n  S.E.2d 338, 340&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1985) (&quot;The\r\n  Commission in workers' compensation cases sits as a jury does. It is elementary\r\n  that a jury may believe part or all of a witness's testimony[.]&quot;).\r\nIn\r\n  fact, the appellate court is prohibited from overturning findings of fact\r\n  of the Appellate Panel unless there is no reasonable probability the facts\r\n  could be as related by the witness upon whose testimony the finding was based. Â Liberty, 363 S.C. at 621,\r\n  611 S.E.2d at 301. Â If the Appellate Panel's factual\r\n  findings are founded on evidence of sufficient substance to afford a reasonable\r\n  basis for them, they must be upheld. Â Sharpe, 329 S.C. at\r\n  543, 495 S.E.2d at 794.\r\n  Â \r\nWe\r\n  believe there was a reasonable probability the key facts could be as related by\r\n  Mrs. Holcombe's testimony concerning Earle's account of events, to which\r\n  Appellants never objected.[8]Â \r\n  Earle's version of the key events is consistent with the attending physician's\r\n  assessment of Claimant's condition upon admission to the hospital. Â It is also\r\n  consistent with Mrs. Holcombe's testimony that on the day before the incident,\r\n  Claimant had asked Earle to take him to Wal-Mart.Â  Notably, Mrs. Holcombe\r\n  testified that she believed the part of Earle's account regarding losing her\r\n  keys and leaving Claimant in an overheated car because it was consistent with\r\n  the attending physician's diagnosis of heatstroke.Â  Although Mrs. Holcombe\r\n  wavered on this point during cross-examination, Earle's version of events had\r\n  similarities to Mrs. Holcombe's deposition testimony regarding Claimant's\r\n  version of the day's events. Â Claimant had indicated that Earle took him to\r\n  Wal-Mart and left him in the car and he started feeling bad at that point.Â  Appellants\r\n  did not object to the introduction of any of this testimony.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the evidence in the record would allow reasonable minds to\r\n  reach the conclusion the Appellate Panel reachedâ€”that Claimant became trapped\r\n  in his caregiver's overheated car and suffered from heatstroke because his\r\n  quadriplegia prevented him from extricating himself from the car.Â  Hence,\r\n  the Appellate Panel's finding to this effect was supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  See Pierre, 386 S.C. at 540, 689 S.E.2d at 618 (&quot;Substantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which,\r\n    considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n    conclusion the agency reached.&quot;) (citations and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSHORT and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Two\r\n  days after being admitted to the hospital, a blood test indicated that Claimant\r\n  had been exposed to cocaine sometime within ten days prior to the test.Â \r\n  However, the attending physician at the hospital determined that the most\r\n  likely cause of Claimant's condition on the day in question was heatstroke,\r\n  &quot;plus or minus infection.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] The\r\n  circuit court disagreed with the Appellate Panel's conclusion that section\r\n  42-15-70 of the South Carolina Code (1985) provides additional support for the\r\n  claim.Â  Although Claimant has not included this issue in his Statement of\r\n  Issues on Appeal, he appears to raise it as an additional sustaining ground in\r\n  a footnote.Â  We decline to reach this issue as it is unnecessary for our\r\n  disposition of this appeal.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723&nbsp;(2000)&nbsp;(holding that it is within the appellate\r\n  court's discretion whether to address any additional sustaining grounds); Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613,\r\n  518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that the\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\n[3] The\r\n  pertinent language of section 1-23-380 is as follows: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n    weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision\r\n    of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse\r\n    or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n    prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n    decisions are:Â  (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b)\r\n    in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c)\r\n    made upon unlawful procedure; (d)\r\n    affected by other error of law; (e)\r\n    clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n    on the whole record; or (f)\r\n    arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n    unwarranted exercise of discretion. Â \r\n\r\n[4] The South Carolina General Assembly has since changed the\r\n  review procedure for workers' compensation matters to eliminate review by the circuit court, but the\r\n  change does not affect the procedure applicable to this case. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2010) (regarding\r\n  judicial review of administrative decisions); id. Â§ 42-17-60 (concerning\r\n  appeals of Commission awards).\r\n[5] To establish\r\n  that an injury is a natural consequence of a work-related compensable injury,\r\n  the Claimant must show that the work-related injury proximately caused the\r\n  second injury.Â  See Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie\r\n    Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 437, 458\r\n  S.E.2d 76, 80&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1995) (holding that as long as a causal\r\n  connection is present, the compensability of the subsequent condition is beyond\r\n  question).\r\n\r\n  Proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact and legal\r\n    cause. Â Causation in fact is proved by establishing the plaintiff's injury\r\n    would not have occurred &quot;but for&quot; the defendant's action. Â Legal\r\n    cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  Legal cause is ordinarily a\r\n    question of fact . . . . Only when the evidence is susceptible to only one\r\n    inference does it become a matter of law for the court. \r\n\r\nMellen v. Lane, 377 S.C. 261, 278-79, 659\r\n  S.E.2d 236, 245-46&nbsp;(Ct.

Bob Bennett Ford, 339 S.C. 68, 70, 528 S.E.2d 667, 668&nbsp;(2000).Â \r\n  At the hearing before the single commissioner, Appellants made no hearsay\r\n  objections to Mrs. Holcombe's testimony regarding Earle's version of the\r\n  events.Â  In any event, as discussed above, Mrs. Holcombe's testimony about what\r\n  Mrs. Earle told her was consistent with the medical testimony and with\r\n  Claimant's statements to Mrs. Holcombe before and after the incident.Â \r\n  Therefore, the challenged testimony is sufficiently reliable to constitute\r\n  substantial evidence supporting the Appellate Panel's findings.

(&quot;Fountain Electric&quot;) for all of the electrical\r\nwork on the Project, with an original principal amount of $4,574,500 (the &quot;Subcontract&quot;).[1] &nbsp;Winter\r\nrequired Fountain Electric to provide payments and performance bonds for its work from a surety acceptable to Winter. &nbsp;With Winter's approval, Erie\r\nprovided payment and performance bonds for the full Subcontract amount.\r\nApproximately fourteen months later, Fountain Electric defaulted on its Subcontract with Winter by failing to complete its work on the Project or pay all of\r\nits suppliers. &nbsp;The default occurred two months prior to the Phase 1 completion deadline. &nbsp;After the default, Winter sought bids from three potential\r\nreplacements for Fountain Electric. &nbsp;Two days after the default, Winter retained the services of Metro Power, Inc. d/b/a Carolina Power (&quot;Carolina\r\nPower&quot;) to complete the remaining electrical work. &nbsp;Carolina Power completed its work and the overall project was completed on time. &nbsp;Erie paid\r\n$2,799,654.80 to satisfy Fountain Electric's obligations under its Subcontract with Winter. &nbsp;\r\nFountain Electric's Subcontract included a damages provision that was triggered if Fountain Electric defaulted as set forth in Article 18.2 of the\r\nSubcontract. &nbsp;The provision set forth a formula to compensate Winter for its administrative burden of overseeing the completion of Fountain Electric's\r\nSubcontract (the &quot;administrative burden&quot;) in the event Fountain Electric defaulted. &nbsp;The administrative burden provision states, in pertinent\r\npart:\r\n\r\n  If SUBCONTRACTOR fails to cure an event of default within seventy-two (72) hours after receipt of written notice of default by WINTER to SUBCONTRACTOR,\r\n  WINTER may, without prejudice to any of [its] other rights or remedies, terminate the employment of SUBCONTRACTOR and [. . .] WINTER shall be entitled to\r\n  charge all reasonable costs incurred in this regard (including attorney['s] fees) plus an allowance for administrative burden equal to fifteen percent (15%)\r\n  to the account of SUBCONTRACTOR.\r\n\r\nFountain Electric's President, Terry Fountain, Jr., agreed to every provision in the Subcontract, as evidenced by his initials on every page of the\r\nSubcontract, including directly below the administrative burden.\r\nAfter Fountain Electric defaulted, a total of $3,110,150.17 worth of electrical work was ultimately completed on the Project that Winter was forced to\r\noversee and administratively manage. &nbsp;After its default, Fountain Electric, as required by the terms of its bond agreement with Erie, assigned all of its\r\nrights under the Subcontract to Erie, including the right of payment for all contract balances owed to Fountain Electric. &nbsp;Erie, as subrogee of Fountain\r\nElectric, then made a demand upon Winter for payment of all remaining contract balances that Winter owed to Fountain Electric. &nbsp;On November 5, 2007, Winter\r\nmade payment of $236,727.98 to Erie, representing &quot;undisputed&quot; amounts that it owed to Erie, as subrogee of Fountain Electric. &nbsp;Winter withheld\r\nan additional $466,522, claiming it was entitled to withhold these remaining funds based upon the provision in the Subcontract that is at issue. &nbsp;After a\r\nrecalculation and retainage released from the owner of the Project, Winter made a second payment to Erie, as subrogee of Fountain Electric. &nbsp;To date,\r\nWinter continues to withhold $350,000 from Erie based on the provision in the contract.\r\nAfter Winter's failure to make payment, Erie initiated this action by filing a breach of contract claim against Winter. &nbsp;Erie's complaint asserted two\r\ncauses of action. &nbsp;First, Erie contended the liquidated damages provision included in the Subcontract constituted an unenforceable penalty under South\r\nCarolina law. &nbsp;Second, Erie alleged that it is entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to section 27-1-15 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) based on\r\nWinter's alleged refusal to pay Erie &quot;all amounts due.&quot; &nbsp;Winter timely filed its answer, denying any liability on Erie's claims. &nbsp;\r\nErie filed a motion for summary judgment on April 14, 2008, on the ground that the contractual clause at issue was an unenforceable penalty. &nbsp;Winter\r\nfiled a cross-motion for summary judgment on both causes of action. &nbsp;A hearing on the parties' summary judgment motions was held on October 14, 2008.\r\n&nbsp;On May 26, 2009, the trial court issued an order granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denying defendant's motion for summary judgment\r\n(&quot;Order&quot;). &nbsp;In granting summary judgment in favor of Erie, the trial court ruled the contractual clause Winter had relied on in withholding\r\npayment was an unenforceable penalty. &nbsp;The Order further held that a question of material fact existed regarding Erie's claim to attorney's fees under\r\nsection 27-1-15. &nbsp;This appeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is proper when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.&nbsp; See Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester Cnty., 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).&nbsp; When plain, palpable, and\r\nindisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.&nbsp; Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595\r\nS.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this Court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP. &nbsp;Pittman v.\r\nGrand Strand Entm't Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005) (citing S.C. Elec. Gas Co. v. Town of Awendaw, 359 S.C. 29, 34, 596 S.E.2d\r\n482, 485 (2004) and Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001)).&nbsp; On appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising\r\nin and from the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Pittman, 363 S.C. at 536, 611 S.E.2d at 925.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWinter contends the trial court erred in holding the administrative burden provision in the Subcontract is an unenforceable penalty provision. &nbsp;We\r\nagree.\r\nBasic contract law provides that when a contract is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contract's force and effect. &nbsp;C.A.N.\r\nEnter., Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988).&nbsp; It is not the function of the court to\r\nrewrite contracts for parties. &nbsp;Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 171, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2002).&nbsp; South Carolina law allows parties\r\nto prospectively set an amount of damages for breach through the inclusion of a liquidated damages provision. &nbsp;Id. at 172, 568 S.E.2d at 363\r\n(finding that parties to a contract may stipulate as to amount of liquidated damages owed in event of nonperformance).&nbsp; Such provisions are widely used in\r\nconstruction contracts and have been generally enforced as an appropriate remedy for breach.&nbsp; See 11 S.C. Jur. Damages Â§ 65 (2010); Restatement\r\n(Second) of Contracts Â§ 356 (1981).&nbsp;\r\nThe dispositive test on whether a provision in a contract is for liquidated damages or is an unenforceable penalty was set forth by our supreme court in Tate\r\nv. LeMaster:\r\n\r\n  Implicit in the meaning of 'liquidated damages' is the idea of compensation; in that of 'penalty,' the idea of punishment.&nbsp; Thus, where the sum\r\n  stipulated is reasonably intended by the parties as the predetermined measure of compensation for actual damages that might be sustained by reason of\r\n  nonperformance, the stipulation is for liquidated damages; and where the stipulation is not based upon actual damages in the contemplation of the parties, but\r\n  is intended to provide punishment for breach of the contract, the sum stipulated is a penalty.\r\n\r\n231 S.C. 429, 441, 99 S.E.2d 39, 45-46&nbsp;(1957); see also Kirkland Distrib. Co. of Columbia, S.C. v. U.S., 276 F.2d 138, 145 (4th Cir.\r\n1960).&nbsp; Moreover, &quot;[w]hether such a stipulation is one for liquidated damages or for a penalty is . . . primarily a matter of the intention of the\r\nparties.&quot; &nbsp;Tate, 231 S.C. at 441, 99 S.E.2d at 45; see also Benya v. Gamble, 282 S.C. 624, 630, 321 S.E.2d 57, 61 (Ct. App.\r\n1984), cert. granted, 284 S.C. 366, 326 S.E.2d 654, and cert. dismissed, 285 S.C. 345, 329 S.E.2d 768 (1985).&nbsp; Accordingly, we look to the\r\nlanguage of the Subcontract and the reasonable intention of the parties to determine if the liquidated damages provision was the predetermined measure of\r\ncompensation.\r\nA.&nbsp; Language of the Subcontract\r\nThe law in this state regarding the construction and interpretation of contracts is well settled. &nbsp;See Conner v. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97,\r\n101, 328 S.E.2d 334, 336 (1985).&nbsp; When the language of a contract is clear, explicit, and unambiguous, the language of the contract alone determines the\r\ncontract's force and effect and the court must construe it according to its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. &nbsp;Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C.\r\n78, 93, 594 S.E.2d 485, 493 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp; In addition, &quot;[w]here an agreement is clear and capable of legal interpretation, the court's only\r\nfunction is to interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it.&quot; Id.\r\n(citing Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. App. 2001)). &nbsp;\r\nAt issue in the litigation is Article 18.2 of the Subcontract.&nbsp; The article states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  WINTER shall be entitled to charge all reasonable costs incurred in this regard (including attorney['s] fees) plus an allowance for administrative burden\r\n  equal to fifteen percent (15%) to the account of SUBCONTRACTOR.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Subcontract is clear. &nbsp;In the event of a breach, Winter would be entitled to an administrative burden to oversee the timely\r\ncompletion of the project.&nbsp; The administrative burden included in the Subcontract provision was reasonably intended by the parties as the predetermined\r\nmeasure of compensation for nonperformance. &nbsp;It is undisputed that Fountain Electric's President, Terry Fountain, Jr., agreed to every provision in the\r\nSubcontract, as evidenced by his initials on every page of the Subcontract, including his initials directly below the administrative burden provision.\r\n&nbsp;There is no suggestion that this figure was arrived at by unfair means, or that it does not represent part of the bargained-for contract.&nbsp; Moreover,\r\nno evidence was presented that Mr. Fountain was an unsophisticated party or was incapable of understanding the Subcontract he signed on behalf of Fountain\r\nElectric.&nbsp; In fact, when the senior manager of the Project met with Mr. Fountain, he discussed the long history of Fountain Electric and noted several\r\nother projects his company was handling.&nbsp; The record also contains statements from Winter's Chief Financial Officer and the senior manager of the Project\r\nindicating the liquidated damages provision was meant to compensate Winter for the administrative burden if a default occurred. &nbsp;Accordingly, we conclude\r\nthe parties agreed the stipulated sum was one for liquidated damages.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Predetermined Measure of Compensation\r\nThe touchstone question in determining whether the sum stipulated in the Subcontract is a liquidated damage or an unenforceable penalty is whether the amount\r\nis &quot;reasonably intended by the parties as the predetermined measure of compensation for actual damages that might be sustained by reason of\r\nnonperformance . . . .&quot; &nbsp;Tate, 231 S.C. at 441, 99 S.E.2d at 46 (emphasis added); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 356\r\n(1981).&nbsp; In Foster v. Roach, our supreme court identified criteria to utilize in making this determination:\r\n\r\n  In order to determine whether the sum named in a contract as a forfeiture for noncompliance is intended as a penalty or liquidated damages, it is necessary\r\n  to look at the whole contract, its subject-matter, the ease or difficulty in measuring the breach in damages and the magnitude of the stipulated sum, not only\r\n  as compared with the value of the subject of the contract, but in proportion to the probable consequences of the breach.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n119 S.C. 102, 107, 111 S.E. 897, 899 (1922).&nbsp;\r\nThe damages that Winter and Fountain Electric might reasonably anticipate were difficult to ascertain because of the very nature of the work Fountain\r\nElectric was performing.&nbsp; The Subcontract between Winter and Fountain Electric, signed on April 29, 2005, provided that Fountain Electric would complete\r\nall of the electrical work on two separate phases of the Project by June 2007 for an original principal amount of $4,574,500.&nbsp; At the time the parties\r\nentered into the contract, it was impossible to estimate administrative costs in the event of a default because the future costs were unknown. &nbsp;The very\r\nnature of a large and complex construction project such as this is what makes damages difficult to ascertain in the first place. &nbsp;\r\nDue to the impossibility of determining the actual and consequential damages resulting from the subcontractor's failure to complete the work on time, the\r\nparties included a liquidated damages provision in the Subcontract to serve as a fair-measure formula that varies the recoverable damages based on the\r\noutstanding work remaining in the Subcontract.&nbsp; The fifteen percent administrative burden is not a pre-set amount, but instead operates as a &quot;sliding\r\nscale,&quot; accounting for the outstanding and remaining work to be completed at the time a party defaults.&nbsp; The earlier a default occurs, the greater the\r\nadministrative burden Winter incurs in completing the subcontractor's work.&nbsp; The fifteen percent administrative burden is a reasonable and fair liquidated\r\ndamages provision.&nbsp; Winter presented uncontroverted evidence that the construction industry standard for subcontract agreements is to include a liquidated\r\ndamages provision requiring the defaulting subcontractor to compensate the general contractor at least fifteen percent of the remaining subcontract value to\r\ncover any and all costs, expenses, and administrative burdens that result from the default. &nbsp;The senior project manager for Winter stated the\r\nadministrative burden agreed to by the parties was fair, reasonable, and standard in the construction industry. &nbsp;Winter's chief financial officer even\r\ntestified outside counsel reviewed Winter's subcontract in 2004, a year before the parties agreed to the Subcontract, with the intent of making the subcontract\r\n&quot;more friendly to [Winter's] subcontractors.&quot; &nbsp;Moreover, since 1996, Winter has utilized the industry standard fifteen percent liquidated damages\r\nprovision in all of its subcontract agreements. &nbsp;Erie has presented no evidence that the fifteen percent administrative burden assessment is not the\r\nindustry standard.\r\nFountain Electric defaulted two months prior to the completion of Phase 1 and a total of $3,110,150.17 worth of electrical work was ultimately completed on\r\nthe Project after their default. &nbsp;Winter's senior project manager stated that although Fountain Electric had completed seventy-four percent of the\r\nelectrical work of Phase 1 on paper, the Project was not as far along as originally represented. &nbsp;As a result of the default, Winter was forced to inspect\r\nthe work completed, determine the amount of remaining work, locate and retain supplemental forces, and administratively manage the completion of the Project.\r\n&nbsp;These administrative duties included, but were not limited to:\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Determining the exact amount of electrical work completed by Fountain Electric.\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Requesting, collecting, and analyzing bids from several other electrical vendors.\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Overseeing Carolina Power's work utilizing four senior management officials from Winter.\r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilizing additional employees to determine what materials Fountain Electric abandoned on the Project site, what materials were still in\r\n  storage, and what work had been correctly or incorrectly completed.\r\n  5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Transitioning and overseeing Winter employees from other projects to complete the remaining electrical work.\r\n\r\nThe liquidated damages provision exists to cover these and other intangible expenses incurred in having to manage the scope of work for the balance of\r\nFountain Electric's Subcontract.\r\nPursuant to the Subcontract, Winter withheld $350,000 as its administrative burden for overseeing the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Project.\r\n&nbsp;The withheld amount is actually less than the originally agreed upon fifteen percent administrative burden, and the &quot;sliding scale&quot; approach of\r\nthe provision in question acts as a fair measure of the harm done by the subcontractor's breach. &nbsp;See Kirkland, 276 F.2d at 145 (holding a\r\nliquidated damages provision that is designed as a fair measure of the harm done by its breach is not to be treated as a penalty and is enforceable).&nbsp;\r\nErie contends the total direct expenses Winter incurred were $84,066, that the actual amount of damages is disproportionate to the $350,000 withheld, and\r\nthat the administrative burden is a penalty.&nbsp; Erie's argument fails for several reasons.&nbsp; First, due to the uncertainty as to when a default may\r\noccur, South Carolina courts have repeatedly held that only when the &quot;sum stipulated is so large that it is plainly disproportionate to any probable\r\ndamage resulting from breach of the contract, the stipulation will be held one for penalty, and not for liquidated damages.&quot; &nbsp;Tate, 231\r\nS.C. at 442, 99 S.E.2d at 46 (emphasis added).&nbsp; The sliding scale approach of the administrative burden provision ensures the sum stipulated is not\r\ndisproportionate to any probable damage.&nbsp; Second, many of Winter's administrative expenses could not be retraced because Winter's executives assigned to\r\nthe Project as a result of Fountain Electric's default were salaried employees.[2]&nbsp; Finally, because Winter's\r\nadministrative burden generates a different damages figure in each situation depending on the remaining value of the subcontract and the exact time of default,\r\nwe find the provision is in proportion to the actual damages that might be sustained by reason of nonperformance. &nbsp;Id. at 441, 99 S.E.2d at\r\n46 (emphasis added). &nbsp;The intent of the damages provision is clear and its application is proper. &nbsp;Thus, as a matter both of contract interpretation\r\nand of public policy, the administrative burden provision of the Subcontract is a valid, enforceable measure of liquidated damages.\r\nBecause Erie failed to show that the liquidated damages provision is an unenforceable penalty, and the facts establish that the provision is enforceable as a\r\nmatter of law, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Erie and in denying summary judgment to Winter.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] After accounting for approved change orders and all other approved costs, the Subcontract's value rose to\r\n$5,487,727.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Several of Winter's executives and other salaried employees were brought in to help administer the\r\nProject, but Winter did not track the additional costs, expenses, and hours of these salaried employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Rider (Wife) appeals a probate court order that held $304,082.46 of mutual fund shares were part of the\r\nestate of her husband, Charles G. Rider (Decedent).&nbsp; Wife argues the probate court erred in reasoning the shares were not transferred to her as a gift\r\nprior to Decedent's death because (1) Decedent entered an agency agreement with his agent, Wachovia Bank (Wachovia), that provided &quot;prior actions&quot; of\r\nDecedent and Wachovia were not affected by Decedent's death; (2) Decedent issued an entitlement order regarding the shares before his death that made the\r\ntransfer of the shares deemed completed upon the date the entitlement order was made; and (3) Decedent's transfer of the shares need only be effectuated by him\r\nso far as he could make it so.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1993, Decedent entered into an &quot;Investment Agency Agreement&quot; (the Agreement) with a predecessor bank of Wachovia.&nbsp; The Agreement authorized\r\nWachovia to open an account for Decedent in which to hold cash, securities, and other property, subject to Decedent's instructions. &nbsp;The Agreement\r\nfurther gave Wachovia discretionary power to buy, sell, and exercise certain rights regarding those securities, and it specified when and how the Agreement\r\nwould terminate:\r\n\r\n  13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement may be terminated by either party by giving thirty (30) days' notice in writing to the other party or by\r\n  [Decedent's] death, provided that termination by reason of [Decedent's] death shall be effective only upon receipt of actual knowledge thereof by one of your\r\n  responsible officials and shall not affect the validity of any prior actions.&nbsp; Your authority hereunder shall not terminate in the event of [Decedent's]\r\n  disability.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2005, Decedent called his wealth manager at Wachovia, Lynn DiLella (the Wealth Manager), and told her he wanted to transfer $2,000,000 worth of\r\nsecurities to Wife to ensure she could maintain her standard of living between his death and the end of probate.[1]&nbsp;\r\nPursuant to the call, the Wealth Manager created a list of assets to transfer and emailed the list to Wachovia's trust department.&nbsp; The trust department\r\nprepared a letter with an approval page to be signed by Decedent, and it mailed the list and letter to Decedent.&nbsp; The letter directed the trust department\r\nto transfer the securities &quot;to a new agency account to be opened for&quot; Wife.&nbsp; On June 17, 2005, Decedent executed and returned the letter to the\r\ntrust department. &nbsp;\r\nBetween June and October 2005, four transfers were made pursuant to the letter.&nbsp; On June 22, a transfer of stock valued at $733,228 was settled and\r\nreflected on Wife's new account at Wachovia.&nbsp; On Friday, July 8, a transfer of stock valued at $39,672 was settled and reflected on Wife's account, and on\r\nthe same day, Decedent died.&nbsp; Wachovia received actual knowledge of Decedent's death sometime late on either Friday, July 8 or Sunday, July 10.&nbsp;\r\nOn July 11, a transfer of mutual fund shares valued at $935,032.64 was settled and reflected on Wife's account, and on October 20, a transfer of mutual fund\r\nshares valued at $304,082.46 was settled and reflected on Wife's account.[2]&nbsp;\r\nThe personal representative of Decedent's estate filed this petition for declaratory judgment in probate court, naming Wife and ten others as respondents to\r\nthe petition. &nbsp;Excluding Wife, four of the respondents named in the petition are respondents in this appeal (Respondents).&nbsp;\r\nIn the petition, the personal representative sought a determination of whether Decedent's execution of the letter completed the transfer of all the\r\nsecurities such that they are not part of Decedent's estate. Wife filed a Notice of Appearance and an Answer, alleging all of the securities transferred\r\npursuant to Decedent's letter are not part of Decedent's estate under the Agreement and Article 8 of the South Carolina Uniform Commercial Code (Article 8).\r\n&nbsp;Respondents appeared and answered as well, arguing agency rules rather than Article 8 govern whether the securities are part of the estate.&nbsp;\r\nAt the probate hearing, Wachovia's trust officer (the Trust Officer), testified he began working for the trust department in August 2005, after Decedent's\r\ndeath.&nbsp; He stated he replaced the trust officer who handled the first three transfers, and he explained the procedure for executing transfers of the type\r\nDecedent requested: The trust department receives an instruction to make the transfer and then completes a form, which is sent to Wachovia's &quot;back\r\noffice.&quot;&nbsp; The back office next gives instructions to various departments depending upon the type of securities being transferred.&nbsp; For mutual\r\nfunds, the Trust Officer testified transfers can take &quot;from ten days to a few weeks.&nbsp; Maybe longer.&quot; &nbsp;He conceded it was unusual for\r\nsettlement of the final transfer to Wife to take as long as it did. &nbsp;\r\nEven though the third and fourth transfers were not settled and reflected on Wife's account until after Decedent's death, the Wealth Manager testified she\r\nbelieved the trust department instructed the appropriate departments to complete all of the transfers before the death occurred.&nbsp;\r\nThe probate court held the transfers initiated by Decedent were intended to be inter vivos gifts and Article 8 applied to those\r\ntransfers.&nbsp; Specifically, the probate court reasoned that Wachovia was an Article 8 &quot;securities intermediary&quot; and Decedent held &quot;security\r\nentitlements&quot; in the securities as an &quot;entitlement holder&quot; such that his letter constituted an &quot;entitlement order.&quot;&nbsp; However, the\r\nprobate court held that, pursuant to the Agreement and law of agency, Wachovia's authority to execute the entitlement order terminated when Wachovia received\r\nknowledge of Decedent's death.&nbsp; The court reasoned that although Decedent's entitlement order was &quot;effective&quot; under Article 8 when made by\r\nDecedent, the transfer was not complete until Wachovia &quot;carried out&quot; the entitlement order.&nbsp; The probate court explained that Wachovia's\r\nauthority to carry out the transfers terminated before the transfer occurred because Article 8 did not supplant the law of agency.&nbsp; Consequently, the\r\nprobate court found the first three transfers were completed before Wachovia learned of Decedent's death and, therefore, the related securities are not part of\r\nhis estate. &nbsp;However, the probate court found the final transfer was not completed until after Wachovia learned of Decedent's death; therefore, the probate\r\ncourt found those securities are part of the estate.&nbsp;\r\nWife appealed to the circuit court.&nbsp; She argued the probate court erred in holding the final transfer was part of Decedent's estate because the\r\nentitlement order completed the transfer of the mutual funds on the day it was made.&nbsp; In response, Respondents argued to affirm the probate court's\r\ndecision because it was supported by the evidence.&nbsp; Respondents did not cross-appeal the probate court's holding as to the third transfer, and they\r\nconceded to the circuit court that the only issue remaining was whether the fourth transfer was part of the estate.&nbsp; The circuit court affirmed, and this\r\nappeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL[3]\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the fourth transfer complete pursuant to the Agreement?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does Article 8 displace agency law such that all of the transfers are deemed completed before Decedent's death?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were the transfers completed &quot;so far as Decedent could do so&quot;?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe standard of review for actions in the probate court depends upon whether the underlying cause of action is at law or in equity.&nbsp; Univ. of S. Cal.\r\nv. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274, 617 S.E.2d 135, 137 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted). &nbsp;&quot;[Q]uestions of law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may be decided with no\r\nparticular deference to the lower court.&quot;&nbsp; Neely v. Thomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 350, 618 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2005) (citation omitted).&nbsp; However,\r\nin actions at law, &quot;the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb the probate court's findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses\r\nthere is no evidence to support them.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 349-50, 618 S.E.2d at 886 (citation omitted).&nbsp; Therefore, this court reviews the\r\ninterpretation of the Agreement and Article 8 without deference, but the probate court's findings as to whether the transfers were completed before the agency\r\nrelationship was terminated must be upheld if supported by evidence.&nbsp; See&nbsp; Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 606-07, 663\r\nS.E.2d 484, 487 (2008) (providing that an action involving the interpretation of a contract and statutes is an action at law); Holmes v. McKay, 334 S.C.\r\n433, 439, 513 S.E.2d 851, 854 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating that whether an agency relationship exists is a question of fact).\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agreement\r\nWife argues the mutual funds of the fourth transfer are not part of Decedent's estate because the plain language of the Agreement states that both Wachovia\r\nand Decedent's actions prior to Wachovia's actual knowledge of Decedent's death would remain enforceable.&nbsp; Moreover, Wife contends Wachovia retained\r\nauthority to transfer the mutual funds even after it learned of Decedent's death, and Wachovia complied with those instructions before that time.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nIn interpreting a contract, a court must &quot;ascertain and give legal effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the language of the\r\n[contract].&nbsp; If a contract's language is clear and capable of legal construction, this [c]ourt's function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent\r\nof the parties as found in the agreement.&quot;&nbsp; Cullen v. McNeal, 390 S.C. 470, 481-82, 702 S.E.2d 378, 384 (Ct. App. 2010) (alterations in\r\noriginal) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\r\nThe &quot;prior actions&quot; clause refers to both Decedent's and Wachovia's conduct.&nbsp; However, that clause did not render Decedent's instruction\r\neternally enforceable after Wachovia learned of Decedent's death.&nbsp; The plain language of the Agreement shows Wachovia's authority to act for Decedent\r\nterminated upon Wachovia's &quot;actual knowledge&quot; of death, and the actions of either party would remain valid if those actions occurred before that\r\ntime.&nbsp; Consequently, whether the mutual funds in question are part of Decedent's estate depends upon whether Decedent's and Wachovia's conduct was\r\nsufficient to complete the transfers before Wachovia learned of Decedent's death.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 8\r\nWife argues the probate court erred in holding the mutual funds of the fourth transfer are part of Decedent's estate.&nbsp; She maintains the agency rule\r\nthat an agent lacks authority to act for a principal after the principal's death does not apply to this action because the letter was an &quot;effective&quot;\r\nentitlement order under Article 8.&nbsp; Specifically, she contends &quot;effective&quot; entitlement orders transfer rights to financial assets the date they\r\nare made, and even if they do not, entitlement orders remain &quot;effective&quot; such that they may be completed after later changes in circumstance.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nAs an initial matter, Respondents have not cross-appealed the probate court's holding that the mutual funds at issue are &quot;financial assets&quot; falling\r\nwithin Part 5 of Article 8.&nbsp; Nor have Respondents cross-appealed the probate court's holding Wachovia was a securities intermediary and that Decedent was\r\nan entitlement holder with a securities entitlement in the instruments at issue.[4]&nbsp; Thus, those issues are not\r\nbefore this court.&nbsp; See Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle, 334 S.C. 176, 187, 512 S.E.2d 123, 129 (Ct. App. 1999) (providing\r\nthat a holding contested by a respondent is the law of the case where the respondent failed to cross-appeal that holding).\r\nAs an entitlement holder, Decedent could begin the process of transferring a security entitlement by issuing an &quot;entitlement order.&quot;&nbsp; An\r\nentitlement order is &quot;a notification communicated to a securities intermediary directing transfer or redemption of a financial asset to which the\r\nentitlement holder has a security entitlement.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(8) (2003).&nbsp; An entitlement order is &quot;effective&quot; if it is\r\n&quot;made by the appropriate person&quot;â€”in this case, the entitlement holder.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-107(a)(3), (b)(1) (2003).&nbsp; The\r\n&quot;effectiveness&quot; of an entitlement order &quot;is determined as of the date&quot; it is made, and it &quot;does not become ineffective by reason of any\r\nlater change of circumstances.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-107(e) (2003).&nbsp;\r\nLike the issues addressed earlier in this section, Respondents have not cross-appealed the probate court's holding that Decedent's letter to Wachovia was an\r\nentitlement order and that Decedent was an appropriate person.&nbsp; Consequently, those issues are not before this court.&nbsp; See Commercial\r\nCredit Loans, Inc., 334 S.C. at 187, 512 S.E.2d at 129 (providing that a holding contested by a respondent is the law of the case where the respondent\r\nfailed to cross-appeal that holding).\r\nThe parties' arguments present only two questions: (1) does Article 8's use of the term &quot;effective&quot; indicate an entitlement order completes a\r\ntransfer of securities at the time the entitlement order is made, and (2) if the entitlement order does not complete the transfer in itself, does Article 8's\r\nprovision that an entitlement order &quot;remains effective&quot; displace agency rules such that a securities intermediary has authority to complete the\r\ntransfer after the entitlement holder's death?&nbsp; We answer both questions in the negative, and we hold the probate court properly found the mutual funds of\r\nthe fourth transfer are part of Decedent's estate.\r\nAs a general rule, an &quot;agency terminates upon the death of the principal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; [T]he authorized acts of the agent are in their\r\nnature the acts of the principal, and by legal fiction the agent's exercise of authority is regarded as an execution of the principal's continuing\r\nwill.&quot;&nbsp; Carver v. Morrow, 213 S.C. 199, 204, 48 S.E.2d 814, 817 (1948) (citations omitted).&nbsp; Accordingly, actions by the principal or the\r\nagent in contemplation of a transaction before the principal's death generally do not preserve the agency for the completion of that transaction.&nbsp; See\r\nC.J.S. Agency Â§ 122 (2003) (&quot;The fact that the agent has performed, as authorized, one or several acts of that which was contemplated as a single\r\ntransaction does not operate to preserve or keep alive the power until the completion of the transaction.&quot;).\r\nPrinciples of agency supplement the Uniform Commercial Code (the U.C.C.) &quot;[u]nless displaced by the particular provisions of the&quot; U.C.C.&nbsp; S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 36-1-103 (2003).&nbsp; &quot;Only where the U.C.C. is incomplete does the common law provide applicable rules,&quot; and &quot;[d]isplacement\r\noccurs when one or more particular provisions of the U.C.C. comprehensively address a particular subject.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hitachi Elec. Devices (USA), Inc.\r\nv. Platinum Techs., Inc., 366 S.C. 163, 170, 621 S.E.2d 38, 41 (2005) (citation omitted).\r\nAn entitlement order does not complete a transfer of financial assets at the time it is made.&nbsp; Like other orders made to agents, an entitlement order is\r\nan instruction to act in the manner the principal desires.&nbsp; See Â§ 36-8-102(a)(8) (providing that an entitlement order is &quot;a notification\r\ncommunicated to a securities intermediary directing transfer or redemption of a financial asset to which the entitlement holder has a security\r\nentitlement&quot;).&nbsp; The transfer of a financial asset is complete when a securities intermediary credits the financial asset to a person's securities\r\naccount.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-104(b) (2003) (&quot;A person acquires a financial asset, other than a security, or an interest therein, under\r\nthis chapter, if the person acquires a security entitlement to the financial asset.&quot;); id. Â§ 36-8-501(b) (&quot;[A] person acquires a security\r\nentitlement if a securities intermediary: (1) indicates by book entry that a financial asset has been credited to the person's securities account\r\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, the fact an entitlement order &quot;remains effective&quot; despite later changes in circumstance does not displace the agency rule relevant to\r\nthis action.&nbsp; An entitlement order's &quot;effectiveness&quot; does not refer to the securities intermediary's power to complete the transfer.&nbsp;\r\nRather, &quot;effectiveness&quot; is a term used by Article 8 to frame whether a securities intermediary is liable for a transfer of financial assets made\r\npursuant to an entitlement order.[5] &nbsp;See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-507(b) (2003) (&quot;If a securities\r\nintermediary transfers a financial asset pursuant to an ineffective entitlement order, the securities intermediary shall reestablish a security entitlement in\r\nfavor of the person entitled to it, and pay or credit any payments or distributions that the person did not receive as a result of the wrongful transfer.\r\n&nbsp;If the securities intermediary does not reestablish a security entitlement, the securities intermediary is liable to the entitlement holder for\r\ndamages.&quot;).\r\nOnce one understands the import of finding an entitlement order &quot;effective,&quot; it becomes clear that Revised Article 8 does not comprehensively\r\naddress the agency rules relevant to this appeal.&nbsp; The fact that an entitlement order is effective does not establish that the transfer is in fact complete\r\nor deemed complete, nor does it establish that the securities intermediary retains the authority to complete the entitlement order.&nbsp; Therefore, whether the\r\nmutual funds of the fourth transfer are part of Decedent's estate depends upon whether Wife's accounts were credited before Wachovia learned of Decedent's\r\ndeath.&nbsp;\r\nHere, the probate court erred in finding the mutual funds of the third transfer were not part of Decedent's estate.[6]&nbsp;\r\nHowever, that issue is not properly before this court.&nbsp; Respondents never cross-appealed to the circuit court that those mutual funds were part of the\r\nestate, and in fact, Respondents conceded the issue during the circuit court hearing. &nbsp;Therefore, the probate court's holding that the mutual funds\r\nfrom the third transfer were not part of the estate is the law of the case.&nbsp; See Commercial Credit Loans, Inc, 334 S.C. at 187, 512\r\nS.E.2d at 129 (providing that a holding contested by a respondent is the law of the case where the respondent failed to cross-appeal that holding).\r\nAs to the mutual funds of the fourth transfer, the probate court properly found their transfer was not completed before Wachovia learned of Decedent's\r\ndeath.&nbsp; The Wealth Manager testified she believed the trust department instructed the appropriate persons to transfer the mutual funds before Decedent\r\ndied.&nbsp; However, the record did not include evidence of when the trust department in fact issued instructions to transfer the mutual funds, and more\r\nimportantly, nor did the record include evidence Wife's account was credited with the mutual funds before Wachovia learned of Decedent's death.&nbsp; The only\r\nevidence the trust department actually made the instructions and credited the account was when settlement of the transfer was reflected on the account, and that\r\ndate occurred three months after Wachovia gained actual knowledge of the death.&nbsp; Accordingly, even if the time of credit and settlement were different, we\r\nhave no way of knowing when the credit occurred.&nbsp; Therefore, the probate court's holding that the mutual funds of the fourth transfer are part of the\r\nestate is supported by the evidence and not affected by an error of law.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completed &quot;So Far as Decedent Could Do So&quot;\r\nEven if Article 8 did not deem the fourth transfer complete, Wife argues the transfer was sufficiently complete under the law of gifts.&nbsp; Specifically,\r\nshe maintains an inter vivos gift requires intent and delivery only &quot;so far as the donor can make it so,&quot; and once she provided Wachovia\r\nwith the instruction letter, she could do no more to ensure the transfer occurred.&nbsp;\r\nWife makes a different argument on appeal to this court than she did on appeal to the circuit court.&nbsp; On appeal to the circuit court, she argued the\r\ntransfers constituted completed inter vivos gifts because Wachovia lacked notice of Decedent's death when the transfers were made.&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, her argument is not preserved for review.&nbsp; See Kiawah Prop. Owners Grp., 359 S.C. at 113, 597 S.E.2d at 149 (providing that an\r\nargument not made to an intermediate appellate court and ruled on by that court is not preserved for review in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals); cf.\r\nTaylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 216, 479 S.E.2d 35, 43 (1996) (holding that an issue was not preserved because the appealing party argued a different\r\nground at trial than the party argued on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the ruling of the probate court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Decedent learned he had terminal cancer some time prior to the call.\r\n[2]&nbsp;The aggregate value of securities transferred, $2,012,115, includes appreciation between the instruction\r\nand the transfers.&nbsp;\r\n[3] This appeal raised an unpreserved issue of whether North Carolina or South Carolina law applies to this\r\ncase.&nbsp; See Kiawah Prop. Owners Grp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 359 S.C. 105, 113, 597 S.E.2d 145, 149 (2004) (providing that an argument not made\r\nto an intermediate appellate court and ruled on by that court is not preserved for review in the supreme court or court of appeals).&nbsp; However, Respondents\r\nconceded this issue during oral argument.&nbsp;\r\n[4] In simple terms, a person becomes an entitlement holder by acquiring a security entitlement, which generally\r\noccurs when a security is credited to the person's account with a securities intermediary.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(7) (2003) (providing\r\nthat an &quot;entitlement holder&quot; is &quot;a person identified in the records of a securities intermediary as the person having a security entitlement\r\nagainst the securities intermediary&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(17) &amp; official cmt.17 (2003) (providing that a &quot;security entitlement&quot;\r\nrefers to a person's batch of rights against the securities intermediary and property interest in securities credited to his account by the securities\r\nintermediary); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-501(b)(1) (2003) (providing that a person acquires a security entitlement if a securities intermediary does any of the\r\nfollowing three things: &quot;(1) indicates by book entry that a financial asset has been credited to the person's securities account; (2) receives a financial\r\nasset from the person or acquires a financial asset for the person and, in either case, accepts it for credit to the person's securities account; or (3) becomes\r\nobligated under other law, regulation, or rule to credit a financial asset to the person's securities account&quot;).\r\n[5] A comparison of Revised Article 8 with Original Article 8 is instructive on this issue.&nbsp; Section 107 of\r\nRevised Article 8 replaced section 308 of Original Article 8, and Revised Article 8 was specifically created to address the development of the financial assets'\r\nindirect holding system by implementing new terms such as &quot;security entitlement,&quot; &quot;entitlement holder,&quot; and &quot;entitlement\r\norder.&quot;&nbsp; See generally S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-101 Prefatory Note (2003) (tracing the history and development of the securities markets).&nbsp;\r\nSection 107 of Revised Article 8 retains most of the substance of section 308 and applies that substance to security entitlements.&nbsp; Compare S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 36-8-308(4)-(5), (7), (10) (Supp. 2000) (providing that (1) an &quot;instruction&quot; was an order by an &quot;appropriate person&quot; requesting\r\nthe transfer of a security be registered, and an &quot;appropriate person&quot; included the registered owner of the security; and (2) whether someone signing\r\nthe purported instruction was an &quot;appropriate person&quot; was determined from the date of signing, and an instruction made by the appropriate person did\r\nnot &quot;become unauthorized .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by virtue of any subsequent change of circumstances&quot;), with S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 36-8-102(a)(8) &amp;\r\n107(a)(3), (8), (b)(1), (e) (2003) (providing that (1) an entitlement order directs transfer of a financial asset; (2) an entitlement order is\r\n&quot;effective&quot; if it is made by the entitlement holder; and (3) the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of an entitlement order &quot;is determined as of the\r\ndate&quot; it is made, and it &quot;does not become ineffective by reason of any later change of circumstances&quot;).&nbsp; However, section 107's use of\r\n&quot;effective&quot; replaced section 308's use of &quot;authorized.&quot;&nbsp; The Amended Official Comments of section 308 explained that its use of\r\n&quot;authorized&quot; did not refer to agency authority but rather determined whether an issuer who registered the transfer of a security could be held liable\r\nfor a transfer under section 311 of Original Article 8.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-308 amended official cmt.6 (Supp. 2000) (providing that although\r\nan &quot;instruction speak[s] as of the date of signing&quot; and &quot;do[es] not become 'unauthorized' (section 311) because [the appropriate person]\r\ndies,&quot; the &quot;[a]uthority to deliver a certificated security and thus to complete the transfer is not covered by&quot; section 308).&nbsp; This is a\r\nsimilar function to the Revised Article 8's use of the term &quot;effective.&quot;\r\n[6] The Wealth Manager testified the third transfer was not settled until after Wachovia learned Decedent passed\r\naway.&nbsp; And although the Wealth Manager testified she believed the trust department executed the transfer instruction before that time, the Trust Officer\r\ntestified the trust department's role in executing those instructions merely constituted sending instructions to Wachovia's back office.&nbsp; No party\r\nintroduced testimony indicating the trust department, the back office, or some other entity in fact credited those mutual funds to Wife's account before\r\nWachovia learned of Decedent's death.&nbsp; Accordingly, the probate court's finding &quot;Wachovia took the actions necessary to effectuate&quot; the third\r\ntransfer before it knew of Decedent's death was not supported by evidence.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4843 ","title":"State v.

Spears argues the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motion to sever his case from his codefendant's case prior to trial; (2) denying his motion\r\nto suppress trial testimony and evidence of a gun found in the room where Spears was taken into custody; (3) denying his motion to suppress the in-court\r\nidentifications of both defendants on the ground that the out-of-court identification process was unduly suggestive; (4) denying his motion to suppress evidence\r\nthat Spears submits was obtained without a valid search warrant and without valid consent; and (5) denying his motion for a mistrial, which was based on\r\nmultiple grounds.&nbsp; We affirm.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 6, 2006, two men entered Bell's Bait and Tackle Shop in Elloree, South Carolina (also known as, and hereinafter, the Wagon Wheel).&nbsp; The men\r\nheld the store owner and several of his employees[1] on the floor at gunpoint while they proceeded to rob\r\nthe store.&nbsp; The robbers absconded with over $200 in cash, approximately $580 in rolled coins, and several packs of Newport cigarettes.&nbsp;\r\nJames Bourgeois (the owner of the Wagon Wheel) called 911, and the police arrived within ten minutes. &nbsp;Natasha Rivers, a store employee, was able to\r\nprovide the police with a detailed description of both suspects.&nbsp; As a result of her description, police developed Phillip Spears as a suspect.&nbsp; Later\r\nthat same day, approximately four hours after the robbery, police showed Rivers a photo line-up and she immediately identified Spears.&nbsp; Rivers testified\r\nshe was one hundred percent certain that Spears was the same gunman who first entered the Wagon Wheel that morning.&nbsp; Around six-thirty or seven o'clock on\r\nthe evening of the robbery, Rivers was shown a second photo line-up.&nbsp; Rivers said she saw the second line-up on a computer screen at the sheriff's\r\noffice.&nbsp; Rivers immediately pointed to Spears's codefendant, Titus Bantan, although she noted Bantan's hair was different in the photo line-up than it had\r\nbeen when she saw him that morning.&nbsp;\r\nThe police investigation led them to the home of Spears's ex-girlfriend, Tanesha Adams.&nbsp; Through Adams, police learned that prior to the robbery Spears\r\nhad called Adams at 5:00 a.m. and again at 7:00 a.m. to ask her whether she knew if the Wagon Wheel had video cameras.&nbsp; Adams testified she told Spears she\r\ndid not know.&nbsp; While the police were still present, Spears called Adams again.&nbsp; Adams testified Spears admitted to her over the telephone that he\r\nrobbed the Wagon Wheel that morning.&nbsp;\r\nDuring the same police visit, Adams's brother told police about a mobile home in Orangeburg, South Carolina, where he said Spears sometimes stayed.&nbsp;\r\nAdams's brother volunteered to show police the mobile home.&nbsp; Police arrived at 140 Charlotte Circle in Orangeburg armed with an arrest warrant for\r\nSpears.&nbsp; The police entered with their guns drawn and ordered an unknown suspect to back down the hallway with his hands up.&nbsp; After the suspect was\r\ndetained, the police identified him as Bantan, not Spears.&nbsp; Officer Williams stated, &quot;Initially [Bantan] was handcuffed.&nbsp; Once we believed that\r\nhe was going to sign the permission to search, of course he was unhandcuffed . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Although Bantan initially consented to a search of the mobile\r\nhome, Bantan later withdrew his consent after the police located items consistent with the robbery.&nbsp;\r\nThe officers then left and obtained a search warrant, which they executed at 9:00 p.m. on the evening of the robbery.&nbsp; They recovered Timberland boots\r\nand army fatigue style pants that matched the description of the clothing worn by one of the robbers, several packs of Newport cigarettes, $260 in twenty dollar\r\nbills, and a &quot;Coinstar&quot; receipt showing $300 in coins that had been exchanged for cash at a nearby Bi-Lo a few hours after the robbery.&nbsp; Even\r\nthough the trial court noted Bantan's initial consent was invalid, the trial court ruled all the evidence obtained through the search was admissible via the\r\ndoctrine of inevitable discovery.&nbsp;\r\nBantan and Spears were tried together for the Wagon Wheel robbery.&nbsp; A jury convicted both defendants on all counts.&nbsp; The trial court sentenced\r\nSpears to thirty years' imprisonment for kidnapping, thirty years' imprisonment for armed robbery, and five years' imprisonment for possession of a firearm\r\nduring the commission of a violent crime, to run concurrently.&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216,\r\n220&nbsp;(2006).\r\nI.&nbsp; Motion to Sever\r\nSpears filed a motion in limine to sever his case from that of his codefendant, Titus Bantan, and the trial court denied Spears's motion.&nbsp;\r\nSpecifically, the trial court noted that mutually antagonistic defenses do not mandate separate trials.&nbsp; On appeal, Spears argues severance was required\r\nbecause he was forced to defend himself against the prosecution and against Bantan, and this denied him the specific right to a fair trial.\r\n&quot;A motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 350, 573 S.E.2d 856,\r\n860 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; &quot;The trial court's ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Rice,\r\n368 S.C. 610, 613, 629 S.E.2d 393, 394&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).&nbsp; &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's decision is unsupported by the\r\nevidence or controlled by an error of law.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 613, 629 S.E.2d at 395.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhere the offenses charged in separate indictments are of the same general nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and\r\ncharacter, the trial judge has the power, in his discretion, to order the indictments tried together if the defendant's substantive rights would not be\r\nprejudiced.&quot;&nbsp; Simmons, 352 S.C. at 350, 573 S.E.2d at 860.&nbsp; &quot;Offenses are considered to be of the same general nature where they are\r\ninterconnected.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 315, 479 S.E.2d 517, 519&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp; &quot;Conversely, offenses which are of\r\nthe same nature, but which do not arise out of a single chain of circumstances and are not provable by the same evidence may not properly be tried\r\ntogether.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\n&quot;A severance should be granted only when there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of a codefendant or\r\nprevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about a codefendant's guilt.&quot; &nbsp;State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 657, 623 S.E.2d 122,\r\n129&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (emphasis added).&nbsp; An example of a specific trial right that may be prejudiced from a joint trial is the constitutional right to\r\ncross-examination when one codefendant's confession expressly implicates another codefendant but the confessor does not take the witness stand.&nbsp; Bruton\r\nv. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 135-37 (1968).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;A defendant who alleges he was improperly tried jointly must show prejudice before an appellate court will reverse his conviction.&quot;&nbsp; State\r\nv. Halcomb, 382 S.C. 432, 440, 676 S.E.2d 149, 153&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; &quot;The rule allowing joint trials is not impugned simply because the\r\ncodefendants may present evidence accusing each other of the crime.&quot;&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;&quot;A proper cautionary instruction may help protect the\r\nindividual rights of each defendant and ensure that no prejudice results from a joint trial.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Stuckey, 347 S.C. 484, 497, 556 S.E.2d\r\n403, 409&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\r\nWe affirm the trial court's denial of a severance because there was no abuse of discretion; the ruling was supported by the evidence and not affected by an\r\nerror of law.&nbsp; Rice, 368 S.C. at 613, 629 S.E.2d at 395.&nbsp; The evidence against Spears and Bantan was interconnected.&nbsp; Both defendants were\r\ncharged with an armed robbery that occurred at the Wagon Wheel on the morning of November 6, 2006.&nbsp; Both defendants were charged with kidnapping the same\r\nvictims during the robbery.&nbsp; Both defendants were charged with possession of a firearm during the commission of these crimes.&nbsp; Finally, Spears's\r\nex-girlfriend, Tanesha Adams, and Adams's brother led police to Bantan's mobile home, which contained evidence corresponding to the items victims testified were\r\nstolen from the Wagon Wheel.&nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, no specific trial right was prejudiced by the joinder of these codefendants' trials.&nbsp; See Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135-37 (finding\r\na specific trial right was prejudiced and that prejudice could not be remedied with a curative instruction when one codefendant expressly implicated the other\r\ncodefendant in his oral confession but refused to take the witness stand).&nbsp; Although the State presented evidence that Spears confessed to committing the\r\ncrime to Adams over the telephone, there was no evidence Spears implicated Bantan during the call.&nbsp; In addition, Bantan did not implicate Spears at any\r\npoint during the police investigation.&nbsp; Therefore, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Spears's motion for a severance.&nbsp;\r\nSpears also argues severance was warranted because he suffered prejudice during Bantan's closing argument, which emphasized the plethora of evidence against\r\nSpears in contrast to the scant evidence against Bantan.&nbsp; We disagree. &nbsp;South Carolina law provides that mutually antagonistic defenses, or the\r\npossibility that codefendants may accuse each other of the crime, does not necessarily warrant a severance.&nbsp; See State v. Dennis,&nbsp;337\r\nS.C. 275, 281, 523 S.E.2d 173, 176&nbsp;(1999); Halcomb, 382 S.C. at 440, 676 S.E.2d at 153.&nbsp; In addition, the trial court gave a cautionary\r\ninstruction to the jury during its opening remarks that it should consider the evidence against each defendant separately.&nbsp; See Stuckey, 347\r\nS.C. at 497, 556 S.E.2d at 409 (noting a proper cautionary instruction may help to protect the individual rights of each defendant and ensure that no prejudice\r\nresults from a joint trial).\r\nFinally, Spears argues severance was required in order to protect his specific trial right to argue last during closing arguments if he presented no evidence\r\nor witnesses.&nbsp; We decline to address this argument as it was not argued below, and therefore it is not properly preserved for this court's review.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (&quot;In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to\r\nand ruled upon by the trial judge. &nbsp;Issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on\r\nappeal.&quot;).\r\nII.&nbsp; Motion to Suppress Evidence of Gun\r\nSpears was arrested three days after the Wagon Wheel robbery at a residence in North Carolina.&nbsp; A gun was found under the mattress in the bedroom where\r\nSpears was staying.&nbsp; Spears filed a motion in limine to suppress evidence of the gun, arguing there was no evidence he ever possessed the\r\ngun, such as fingerprints or testimony that the gun belonged to him.&nbsp; Spears further contended Bourgeois's statement to police described a silver automatic\r\ngun with black trim, whereas the gun found near Spears at the time of his arrest was a black gun with silver trim. &nbsp;The trial court denied the motion to\r\nsuppress, noting any discrepancies between the victims' description of the gun they saw during the robbery and the gun found near Spears at the time of his\r\narrest would go to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility.&nbsp; However, the trial court noted that the State would need to lay a proper\r\nfoundation for the admission of the gun during the course of the trial.&nbsp;\r\nOn appeal, Spears argues the trial court erred in its in limine ruling that the gun was admissible despite acknowledging the State would need\r\nto establish a proper foundation during trial.&nbsp; Spears submits the gun was irrelevant because the State was unable to establish he owned it and was also\r\nunable to establish any connection between the gun and the crimes for which he was indicted.&nbsp; Finally, Spears contends the prejudicial effect of admitting\r\nthe gun substantially outweighed the probative value.\r\nDuring trial, Rivers testified she saw Spears with a black gun trimmed with silver on the top.&nbsp; Bourgeois testified he saw Spears with a dark colored\r\ngun with chrome parts on it.[2]&nbsp; The State displayed the gun found near Spears to Bourgeois, and he\r\nstated it looked similar to the gun he saw on the day of the robbery.&nbsp; Finally, Cleveland Williams (another store employee) testified during trial that the\r\ngun found near Spears at the time of his arrest in North Carolina looked &quot;almost exact[ly]&quot; the same as the gun he saw on the day of the robbery.\r\nSpears did not object to any of the victims' trial testimony regarding the appearance of the gun or its similarity to the gun found near Spears at the time\r\nof his arrest.&nbsp; See State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001) (&quot;[M]aking a motion in limine to\r\nexclude evidence at the beginning of trial does not preserve an issue for review because a motion in limine is not a final determination.&nbsp;\r\nThe moving party, therefore, must make a contemporaneous objection when the evidence is introduced.&quot;) (citations and quotation marks omitted).&nbsp; In\r\naddition, the motion in limine did not occur immediately prior to the victims' testimony regarding the gun.&nbsp; See id.\r\n(&quot;However, where a judge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, the\r\naggrieved party does not need to renew the objection.&quot;).&nbsp; Therefore, Spears's argument regarding the admissibility of the testimony concerning the gun\r\nis not preserved for our review.&nbsp;\r\nSpears did object, however, when the State moved the actual gun into evidence.&nbsp; Therefore, we proceed to evaluate that ruling on the merits.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;&nbsp; State v.\r\nMoore, 377 S.C. 299, 305-06, 659 S.E.2d 256, 259&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).&nbsp; &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs\r\nwhen the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 306, 659 S.E.2d at 259 (citations and quotation marks omitted).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\r\naction more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.&quot;&nbsp; See Rule 401, SCRE.&nbsp; However, relevant evidence may be\r\nexcluded when its probative value is &quot;substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . .\r\n.&quot;&nbsp; Rule 403, SCRE.&nbsp; &quot;Evidence is unfairly prejudicial in the context of Rule 403, if the evidence has an undue tendency to suggest a\r\ndecision on an improper basis, such as an emotional one.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Lisa C., 380 S.C. 406, 417, 669 S.E.2d 647,\r\n653&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp;\r\nWe believe the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the gun.&nbsp; The State laid a proper foundation for admission of the gun.&nbsp;\r\nSpecifically, several victims testified the gun found near Spears was very similar to the gun they saw him with on the day of the robbery.&nbsp; Because this\r\nevidence was relevant and highly probative, we believe the trial court properly admitted it.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Motion to Suppress In-Court Identifications\r\nSpears suggests the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress both the out-of-court and the in-court identifications of Spears and Bantan when the\r\nout-of-court identification procedures were unduly suggestive.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;The United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong[ed] inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.&quot; &nbsp;State\r\nv. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198-99 (1972)). &nbsp;First, a court must ascertain\r\nwhether the identification process was unduly suggestive. &nbsp;Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447. &nbsp;Next, the court must decide whether the\r\nout-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed. &nbsp;Id.\r\n&quot;The inquiry must focus upon whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood of irreparable\r\nmisidentification.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 127, 644 S.E.2d 693, 696&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp; The following factors are to be considered in\r\nevaluating the totality of the circumstances when determining the likelihood of misidentification:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; the witness's opportunity to view the perpetrator at the time of the crime, (2) the witness's degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the\r\n  witness's prior description of the perpetrator, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and (5) the length of time\r\n  between the crime and the confrontation.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nId. at 127, 644 S.E.2d at 696-97.&nbsp;\r\nSpears failed to contemporaneously object when Rivers or Bourgeois made in-court identifications of the defendants during their direct testimony, despite the\r\nfact that both witnesses identified Spears and Bantan as the gunmen who robbed the Wagon Wheel on several occasions during the course of their testimony.&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, any issue with respect to the witnesses' in-court identifications is not properly before this court.&nbsp; See State v. Forrester,\r\n343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001) (&quot;[M]aking a motion in limine to exclude evidence at the beginning of trial does not preserve\r\nan issue for review because a motion in limine is not a final determination.&nbsp; The moving party, therefore, must make a contemporaneous\r\nobjection when the evidence is introduced.&quot;) (citations and quotation marks omitted).&nbsp; In addition, Spears's motion in limine to\r\nsuppress this evidence did not occur immediately prior to the victims' in-court-identifications of Spears and Bantan.&nbsp; See id.\r\n(&quot;However, where a judge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, the\r\naggrieved party does not need to renew the objection.&quot;).&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nSpears did contemporaneously object to the introduction of the photo line-ups for both Bantan and Spears.&nbsp; However, we do not believe the photo line-ups\r\nwere unduly suggestive.&nbsp; In addition, the identification process was so reliable that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.&nbsp; See\r\nMoore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447.&nbsp; Shortly after the robbery, Rivers was able to provide a detailed description of both of the suspects to\r\npolice.&nbsp; Rivers testified she &quot;directly&quot; pointed to the photo of Spears when she saw the photo line-up, and she was &quot;a hundred percent\r\nsure&quot; Spears was the man who entered the Wagon Wheel first that morning.&nbsp; In addition, Rivers saw the first photo line-up only four hours after the\r\nrobbery.&nbsp; Finally, Rivers testified she recognized Spears during the course of the robbery as someone she knew &quot;from the neighborhood.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nRivers saw the photo line-up of Bantan the evening of the robbery, and she &quot;directly&quot; pointed to Bantan as well.&nbsp; Viewing the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.&nbsp; See Turner, 373 S.C. at 127, 644 S.E.2d at 696-97.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIV.&nbsp; Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained in Search\r\nIn a motion in limine to exclude all evidence obtained via the search, the trial court ruled Bantan's initial consent to search was invalid\r\nbased on the fact that his will was overcome.&nbsp; However, after redacting the sentence in the search warrant affidavit referencing Bantan's consent, the\r\ntrial court found that the affidavit attached to the search warrant still gave rise to probable cause.&nbsp; Therefore, the trial court ruled that all the\r\nevidence obtained through the search was admissible via the doctrine of inevitable discovery.&nbsp; On appeal, Spears argues that because Bantan's initial\r\nconsent was invalid, the subsequent search warrant was also invalid because it was obtained on the basis of illegally discovered evidence.&nbsp; In the absence\r\nof this illegally discovered evidence, Spears contends the search warrant affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search the mobile home.&nbsp; Spears\r\nfurther argues the search warrant for evidence seized from 140 Charlotte Circle in Orangeburg, SC, was invalid as it was issued to a Calhoun County officer who\r\nwas without jurisdiction to execute the warrant.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;The trial judge's factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed for clear\r\nerror.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48-49, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp; The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the\r\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures . . . .&quot; &nbsp;U.S. Const. amend. IV; see\r\nalso S.C. Const. art. I Â§&nbsp;10.&nbsp; The United States Supreme Court adopted the federal exclusionary rule to prevent the admission\r\nof evidence at trial that was unlawfully seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment and subsequently expanded that rule to apply to the individual states via\r\nthe Due Process clause.&nbsp; Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 398 (1914), overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961).&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the United States Supreme Court has narrowly interpreted the scope of the exclusionary rule in recent years.&nbsp; See Hudson v. Michigan,\r\n547 U.S. 586, 591-94 (2006) (holding violation of the &quot;knock and announce&quot; rule did not warrant the exclusion of all evidence obtained in a search,\r\nand noting that the exclusionary rule generates &quot;substantial societal costs&quot;) (citations and quotation marks omitted).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe inevitable discovery doctrine, one exception to the exclusionary rule, states that if the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of the evidence\r\nthat the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, the information is admissible despite the fact it was illegally\r\nobtained.&nbsp; Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 444 (1984).&nbsp; As explained by the Nix Court, &quot;if the government can prove that the\r\nevidence would have been obtained inevitably and, therefore, would have been admitted regardless of any overreaching by the police, there is no rational basis\r\nto keep that evidence from the jury in order to ensure the fairness of the trial proceedings.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 447.&nbsp; Therefore, in Nix, the\r\nCourt allowed the introduction of physical evidence of the victim's body despite the fact that the defendant's statements regarding the location of the body had\r\nbeen obtained in violation of his right to counsel.&nbsp; Id. at 437, 449-50.&nbsp; The Court noted that search parties were approaching the location of\r\nthe body, and there was testimony that it would only have taken an additional three to five hours to discover the victim's body if the search had\r\ncontinued.&nbsp; Id. at 449.\r\n&quot;A search warrant may issue only upon a finding of probable cause.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347,\r\n348&nbsp;(1999).&nbsp; The duty of the appellate court is simply to determine whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause\r\nexisted.&nbsp; Id. at 144, 519 S.E.2d at 349 (citing Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983)).&nbsp; &quot;The task of the issuing\r\nmagistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him . . . there is a fair\r\nprobability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Dunbar, 361 S.C. 240, 253, 603 S.E.2d 615,\r\n622&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (citing Gates, 462 U.S. at 238).&nbsp; &quot;The appellate court should give great deference to a magistrate's determination of\r\nprobable cause.&quot;&nbsp; Dunbar, 361 S.C. at 253, 603 S.E.2d at 622.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court found that all the evidence recovered from 140 Charlotte Circle was admissible under the inevitable discovery\r\nexception.&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp; Relying on State v. Davis, 371 S.C. 412, 639 S.E.2d 457 (2007), the trial court first redacted any reference to Bantan's\r\ninitial consent due to the fact that his will was overcome by the officers' show of force and then found the remaining search warrant still gave rise to\r\nprobable cause to search the residence.&nbsp; See Davis, 371 S.C. at 415-17, 639 S.E.2d at 459-60 (noting that a court may redact alleged\r\nmisstatements in an affidavit and consider the remaining content of the affidavit to determine whether it is sufficient to establish probable cause).&nbsp; The\r\nremaining portion of the search warrant, as read into the record by the trial court, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  An armed robbery occurred at Bell's Bait and Tackle Shop in Elloree, South Carolina, and a suspect, Phillip Spears, was positively identified by a store\r\n  clerk from a six photo line-up compiled by SLED.&nbsp; Information was received by officers from the Calhoun County Sheriff's Office that suspect sometimes\r\n  stayed at 140 Charlotte Circle in the City of Orangeburg, so officers responded to that location.&nbsp; Upon arriving at 140 Charlotte Circle, a second\r\n  suspect, Titus Bantan, was located and had also been positively identified from a six photo line-up compiled by SLED as one of the armed robbery\r\n  suspects.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs previously discussed, we believe the out-of-court photo identifications of Spears and Bantan were valid and not the product of unduly suggestive\r\nprocedures.&nbsp; In addition, we disagree with Spears's contention that the affidavit mentions any of the evidence initially located by police during the\r\nperiod of Bantan's initial consent.&nbsp; Viewing the totality of the circumstances, the magistrate had a substantial basis for determining evidence relevant to\r\nthe Wagon Wheel robbery would be found at 140 Charlotte Circle.&nbsp; See Bellamy, 336 S.C. at 144, 519 S.E.2d at 349.&nbsp; We hold the trial\r\ncourt properly found that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.&nbsp; Accordingly, the evidence recovered from 140\r\nCharlotte Circle was admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine as the evidence would have been found subject to the valid search warrant, regardless of\r\nwhether Bantan was coerced to give consent during the initial search.&nbsp; See Nix, 467 U.S. at 443-44, 447.&nbsp;\r\nWe need not address Spears's remaining argument with respect to whether the search warrant was improperly issued to an officer without jurisdiction to\r\nexecute the warrant because the entire argument on appeal consists of a single sentence.&nbsp; See State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 108 n.1, 504\r\nS.E.2d 324, 328 n.1 (1998) (noting a one sentence argument is too conclusory to present any issue on appeal).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nV.&nbsp; Motion for a Mistrial\r\nSpears argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after Officer Christopher Golden improperly introduced testimony concerning\r\n.40-caliber bullets, drugs, and a shotgun recovered during the search of 140 Charlotte Circle.&nbsp; Spears further argues the trial court erred in denying his\r\nsecond motion for a mistrial on the ground that the jury was improperly influenced by extraneous information regarding another robbery that Spears and Bantan\r\nallegedly committed.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;The granting or refusing of a motion for a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal\r\nabsent an abuse of discretion.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Kelly, 372 S.C. 167, 170, 641 S.E.2d 468, 470 (Ct. App. 2007) (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted).&nbsp; &quot;A mistrial should only be granted when absolutely necessary, and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be\r\nentitled to a mistrial.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 34, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;The granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect can\r\nbe removed in no other way.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Goodwin, 384 S.C. 588, 605, 683 S.E.2d 500, 509&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted).&nbsp; &quot;An instruction to disregard incompetent evidence usually is deemed to have cured the error in its admission unless . . . it is probable\r\nthat notwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Simpson,&nbsp;325 S.C. 37, 43, 479 S.E.2d 57,\r\n60&nbsp;(1996). &nbsp;&quot;Error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Reeves, 301 S.C.\r\n191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).&nbsp;\r\nWe affirm the trial court's denial of both of Spears's mistrial motions.&nbsp; During pre-trial motions, the trial court ruled that the State was not to\r\nrefer to drugs, a shotgun, or .40-caliber bullets, all of which were found in Bantan's mobile home at the time of the search.&nbsp; During trial, Officer Golden\r\nwas listing the items recovered from 140 Charlotte Circle and he mentioned recovering &quot;some bullets, .40-caliber, a shotgun. &nbsp;Plus, there [were] some\r\ndrugs found.&quot;&nbsp; Bantan's counsel immediately objected and moved for a mistrial after Officer Golden improperly testified about these items.&nbsp;\r\nSpears's counsel joined in the motion for a mistrial.&nbsp; The State conceded Officer Golden's testimony regarding a shotgun and drugs was\r\ninadmissible.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court agreed the items should not have been mentioned, but denied Bantan's motion for a mistrial.&nbsp; The trial court\r\noffered to give a curative instruction for the jury to disregard &quot;the testimony that was given by [Officer Golden] for ten seconds before we took our\r\nbreak.&quot;&nbsp; Both Bantan and Spears declined any curative instruction by the trial court, arguing the instruction would only bring more attention to the\r\nprejudicial testimony and that a mistrial was the only remedy.&nbsp;\r\nWe affirm the trial court's denial of Spears's first mistrial motion as the testimony was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt presented\r\nat trial.&nbsp; See Reeves, 301 S.C. at 194, 391 S.E.2d at 243 (&quot;Error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of\r\nthe trial.&quot;).&nbsp; Specifically, Rivers and Bourgeois testified at trial that they were both one hundred percent certain that Spears was the first gunman\r\nwho entered the Wagon Wheel.&nbsp; In addition, the State presented evidence that Spears confessed to committing the robbery over the phone to\r\nAdams.&nbsp;\r\nSpears argues the trial court erred in denying his second mistrial motion based on extraneous information published to the jury concerning an unrelated bank\r\nrobbery.&nbsp; However, Spears's appellate brief fails to cite any legal authority in support of this argument. &nbsp;Therefore, this argument has been\r\nabandoned on appeal.&nbsp; State v. Garner, 389 S.C. 61, 67, 697 S.E.2d 615, 618 (Ct. App. 2010) (recognizing an argument is deemed abandoned on appeal\r\nwhen it is merely conclusory and made without supporting authority).&nbsp;\r\nFinally, during oral argument, Spears's appellate counsel suggested the trial court erred in denying his mistrial motions because the trial court did not\r\nevaluate all of the mistrial factors on the record before ruling on the motion.&nbsp; See State v. Thompson, 276 S.C. 616, 621, 281 S.E.2d 216,\r\n219 (1981) (listing several factors to be considered by the trial court in evaluating the merits of a mistrial motion).&nbsp; We decline to address this\r\nargument as it was raised for the first time during oral argument and was not addressed in Spears's appellate brief.&nbsp; Bochette v. Bochette, 300 S.C.\r\n109, 112, 386 S.E.2d 475, 477 (Ct. App. 1989) (holding an appellant may not use oral argument as a vehicle to argue issues not argued in the appellant's\r\nbrief).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The victims were Natasha Rivers, James Bourgeois, Cleveland Williams, and Iskier Prezzie.&nbsp; Rivers's\r\ntwo minor children were also in the store on the morning of the robbery.&nbsp;\r\n[2]&nbsp; Spears's trial counsel cross-examined Bourgeois extensively regarding the discrepancy between his\r\ndescription of the gun in his written statement to police (silver with black trim) and his description of the gun at trial (dark colored with chrome parts).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4844","title":"ITC Commercial Funding v.

This agreement provided the\r\nAppellant would pay ITC $87,388.13, which included amounts owed for taxes, legal fees, and interest payments, by September 30, 2008. &nbsp;The agreement further\r\nprovided that ITC would delay the payment date on the note until December 31, 2008, provided the Appellant acknowledge service of the action against her.\r\n&nbsp;West mailed a copy of the letter agreement to the Appellant and stated, &quot;I will not be able to represent you in the South Carolina lawsuit since I am\r\nnot admitted to practice before the courts of that State.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the Appellant, she does not remember receiving the letter. &nbsp;The\r\nAppellant paid ITC $87,388.13 pursuant to the parties' agreement; however, she failed to acknowledge service. &nbsp;On October 13, 2008, the Aiken County\r\nSherriff's Department served the Appellant with ITC's complaint at her home. &nbsp;The Appellant filed no responsive pleading. &nbsp;\r\nWhen the note was not paid in full on December 31, 2008, ITC notified the Appellant through West that it intended to proceed with its case against her, and\r\nmade an additional loan extension proposal as an alternative.&nbsp; West sent a certified copy of the letter to the Appellant, and she acknowledged\r\nreceipt.&nbsp; &nbsp;West informed the Appellant in the letter for the second time that he could not represent her in South Carolina. After no further\r\nfunds were received, ITC filed a request for entry of default and motion for default judgment against the Appellant on March 12, 2009. The Appellant was served\r\nby mail at her home, and she did not respond. &nbsp;On April 7, 2009, the trial court granted ITC's motion for default judgment against the Appellant in the\r\namount of $2,172,955.38.&nbsp;\r\nIn May 2009, the Appellant filed a motion for relief from judgment, citing Rules 54, 55, and 60, SCRCP. &nbsp;&nbsp;ITC consented to a reduction in\r\ncertain attorney's fees and charges included in the default judgment, which resolved the Appellant's complaints based on Rules 54 and 55, SCRCP. &nbsp;At the\r\nhearing, the Appellant's counsel admitted the Appellant was negligent in failing to answer the suit. However, the Appellant's counsel argued the default\r\njudgment should be set aside because of the negligence of West and ITC. The trial court denied the Appellant's motion, finding she was &quot;not entitled to\r\nrelief from the judgment on account of negligence of her own counsel, that there was no misconduct by [ITC] or its counsel, and that under the standard of Rule\r\n60(b), [the Appellant] was not entitled to relief.&quot;&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The decision whether to set aside an entry of default or a default judgment lies solely within the sound discretion of the trial [court].&quot; &nbsp;Roberson\r\nv. S. Fin. of S.C., Inc., 365 S.C. 6, 9, 615 S.E.2d 112, 114 (2005). &nbsp;&quot;The trial court's decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear\r\nshowing of an abuse of that discretion.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Id.&nbsp;&nbsp; An abuse of discretion occurs when the judgment is controlled by some error of\r\nlaw or when the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, conclusions, is without evidentiary support.&nbsp; Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; West's September 24, 2008 Letter\r\nThe Appellant argues the trial court erred in finding West's September 24, 2008 letter sufficiently advised her that West could not represent her in the\r\npresent action.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nIn its order and modification of default judgment, the trial court determined West clearly notified the Appellant that he could not represent her because he\r\nwas not licensed to practice law in South Carolina.&nbsp; &nbsp;The trial court found that although the Appellant maintained she did not remember\r\nreceiving West's letter, the evidence established the letter was properly addressed and sent by U.S. Mail to the Appellant and she failed to show it was not\r\nreceived.&nbsp;\r\nThe Appellant argues West represented her in default negotiations for one year, and she had the right to assume he would continue to represent her. &nbsp;The\r\nAppellant contends that considering her age and inexperience in legal matters, West's letter should have contained an explanation of the risks regarding his\r\nlimited representation. &nbsp;She also maintains West should have discussed his representation with her personally and in the presence of a family member or\r\nfamily attorney, and obtained a response from her to ensure she understood his inability to represent her.&nbsp; The Appellant contends the trial court erred in\r\nfailing to consider Rule 1.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\nPursuant to Rule 1.2(c), RPC, &quot;[a] lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the\r\nclient gives informed consent.&quot;&nbsp; Informed consent &quot;denotes the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has\r\ncommunicated reasonably adequate information and explanation about the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of\r\nconduct.&quot; Rule 1.0(g), RPC. &nbsp;Comment 6 to Rule 1.0, RPC, provides:\r\n\r\n  A lawyer need not inform a client or other person of facts or implications already known to the client or other person; nevertheless, a lawyer who does not\r\n  personally inform the client or other person assumes the risk that the client or other person is inadequately informed and the consent is invalid.&nbsp; In\r\n  determining whether the information and explanation provided are reasonably adequate, relevant factors include whether the client or other person is\r\n  experienced in legal matters generally and in making decisions of the type involved, and whether the client or other person is independently represented by\r\n  other counsel in giving the consent.\r\n\r\nComment 7 to Rule 1.0, RPC, states:\r\n\r\n  Obtaining informed consent will usually require an affirmative response by the client or other person. In general, a lawyer may not assume consent from a\r\n  client's or other person's silence.&nbsp; Consent may be inferred, however, from the conduct of a client or other person who has reasonably adequate\r\n  information about the matter.\r\n\r\nITC takes no position regarding the RPC, and maintains it is a matter between the Appellant and West. &nbsp;ITC argues West's September 24, 2008 letter\r\nregarding his representation of the Appellant does not amount to a willful abandonment of the Appellant.&nbsp; ITC maintains that even assuming West did\r\nwillfully abandon the Appellant, she is not excused from failing to take action in response to West's letters or ITC's complaint and default judgment\r\nmotion.&nbsp;\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding West's letter to the Appellant sufficiently advised her that West could not represent her.\r\n&nbsp;While the Appellant maintains she is entitled to relief from judgment because she did not give West her informed consent pursuant to Rule 1.2(c), RPC, we\r\nnote our supreme court determined &quot;the failure to comply with the RPC should not . . . be considered as evidence of negligence per se.&quot;&nbsp; Smith\r\nv. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 437 n.6, 472 S.E.2d 612, 614 n.6 (1996); &nbsp;see also Preamble to RPC, Rule 407, SCACR\r\n(stating a &quot;[v]iolation of a Rule should not itself give rise to a cause of action against a lawyer nor should it create any presumption in such a case\r\nthat a legal duty has been breached&quot;).&nbsp; In Smith, the supreme court concurred with the majority of jurisdictions and held that\r\n\r\n  in appropriate cases, the RPC may be relevant and admissible in assessing the legal duty of an attorney in a malpractice action. &nbsp;However, we adopt\r\n  the view taken by the Supreme Court of Georgia in Allen v. Lefkoff, Duncan, Grimes &amp; Dermer, 265 Ga. 374, 453 S.E.2d 719, 721-22 (1995), as\r\n  follows:\r\n  [t]his is not to say, however, that all of the Bar Rules would necessarily be relevant in every legal malpractice action. In order to relate to the\r\n  standard of care in a particular case, we hold that a Bar Rule must be intended to protect a person in the plaintiff's position or be addressed to the\r\n  particular harm.\r\n\r\nId. at 437, 472 S.E.2d at 614.&nbsp; The Smith court noted an attorney's failure to comply with the RPC was &quot;merely a circumstance that,\r\nalong with other facts and circumstances, may be considered in determining whether the attorney acted with reasonable care in fulfilling his legal duties to a\r\nclient.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 437 n.6, 472 S.E.2d at 614 n.6.\r\nHere, the record contains evidence West acted with reasonable care in informing the Appellant he could not represent her.&nbsp; In two letters to the\r\nAppellant, West clearly explained he was not authorized to practice law in South Carolina, and the Appellant needed to find new counsel. &nbsp;Because the trial\r\ncourt was not required to consider the RPC in determining whether West acted with reasonable care, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\ndetermining West's letter sufficiently limited his representation of the Appellant.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Imputation of Negligence\r\nThe Appellant argues the trial court erred in finding West's negligence was imputed to the Appellant. &nbsp;In its order, the trial court cited Mitchell\r\nSupply Co. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 163-64, 375 S.E.2d 321, 323 (Ct. App. 1988), wherein this court held the negligence of an attorney is ordinarily\r\nimputed to the client.&nbsp; The trial court further stated, &quot;[t]he court finds no reason that any negligence of [the Appellant's] counsel in this matter\r\nshould not be imputed to [the Appellant].&quot;&nbsp; Although the trial court cited cases regarding the imputation of negligence, it failed to make any\r\nspecific findings of negligence by West and impute those findings to the Appellant.&nbsp; Accordingly, because the trial court did not impute any negligence to\r\nthe Appellant, we do not consider the Appellant's argument that the trial court erred in imputing negligence to her.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Relief under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP\r\nThe Appellant argues the trial court's errors of law resulted in its finding she failed to prove mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect under\r\nRule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nIn Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Industries, Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 608, 681 S.E.2d 885, 888 (2009), our supreme court held &quot;[t]he standard for\r\ngranting relief from a default judgment under Rule 60(b) is more rigorous than the 'good cause' standard established in Rule 55(c).&quot;&nbsp; The supreme\r\ncourt further noted relief from default judgment under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, &quot;requires a more particularized showing of mistake, inadvertence, excusable\r\nneglect, surprise, newly discovered evidence, fraud, misrepresentation, or 'other misconduct of an adverse party.'&quot;&nbsp; Id. (quoting Rule 60(b),\r\nSCRCP).\r\nHere, the trial court noted in its order that the Appellant's counsel conceded at the hearing that the Appellant was negligent, and the trial court found her\r\nnegligence was not excusable within the meaning of Rule 60(b), SCRCP. &nbsp;The trial court held that although the Appellant may have had good cause to set\r\naside the entry of default under Rule 55, SCRCP, she did not meet the standards established by Rule 60(b), SCRCP, to set aside the judgment. &nbsp;\r\nThe Appellant argues she demonstrated a particularized showing of mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect to the trial court, and thus, she was entitled\r\nto relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP. The Appellant maintains her failure to file an answer after being served was excusable under the following\r\ncircumstances: (1) her age and mental state prevented her from understanding the situation, (2) she thought the loan was current, (3) she was not aware of the\r\nlawsuit, (4) she believed she was still represented by West, and (5) she had no experience working with attorneys.\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the Appellant's negligence in failing to answer ITC's complaint was not excusable under Rule\r\n60(b), SCRCP. &nbsp;We also find the Appellant failed to identify any errors of law made by the trial court.&nbsp; The record reflects the Appellant was\r\nproperly served with ITC's summons and complaint at her home by the sheriff's department.&nbsp; Moreover, West notified the Appellant in a certified letter, to\r\nwhich she acknowledged receipt, that ITC intended to proceed with its suit against her and that he could not represent her.&nbsp; The Appellant also failed to\r\nshow through medical testimony that she had a diminished capacity or that ITC and its counsel engaged in any misleading conduct. ITC properly served the\r\nAppellant with its complaint and subsequently with its motion for default judgment and amended motion for default judgment.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Meritorious Defenses\r\nThe Appellant argues she has meritorious defenses to justify relief from the default judgment.&nbsp; We need not address this issue.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;[A] meritorious defense is more than merely a factor to consider under certain 60(b) grounds for setting aside default judgments.&quot; &nbsp;McClurg\r\nv. Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 574, 671 S.E.2d 87, 93 (Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  [O]ur courts have held that in order to obtain relief from a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1) or 60(b) (3), not only must the movant make a proper\r\n  showing he is entitled to relief based upon one of the specified grounds, he must also make a prima facie showing of a meritorious defense. . . .&nbsp; [A]\r\n  meritorious defense need not be perfect nor one which can be guaranteed to prevail at a trial.&nbsp; It need be only one which is worthy of a hearing or\r\n  judicial inquiry because it raises a question of law deserving of some investigation and discussion or a real controversy as to real facts arising from\r\n  conflicting or doubtful evidence.\r\n\r\nId. at 574-75, 671 S.E.2d at 93-94 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). &nbsp;The party seeking to set aside the judgment &quot;has the\r\nburden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle him to relief.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 575, 671 S.E.2d at 94.&nbsp;\r\nThe Appellant contends she has the following meritorious defenses to justify relief under Rule 60(b), SCRCP:&nbsp; (1) she was in a state of shock and\r\nextreme grief at the time she signed the guaranty, (2) she did not understand what she was signing, (3) she was given no consideration for signing the guaranty,\r\nand (4) the note may not be in default. &nbsp;Having concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the Appellant was not entitled to\r\nrelief on any of the grounds specified in Rule 60(b), SCRCP, we need not address whether the Appellant has a meritorious defense.&nbsp; See id. at\r\n574-75, 671 S.E.2d at 93-94; see also Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\nappellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court's denial of the Appellant's motion to set aside default judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] The note was modified in August 2007, and the loan amount was increased to $2,064,625.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4845 ","title":"Southeastern Site Prep v.

Richardson, Jr. (collectively, Appellants) appeal the special\r\nreferee's denial of their motion for sanctions.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nSoutheastern Site Prep, LLC (Southeastern), Southeastern Property Development, LLC (SPD), Steve Desimone, and Thomas Viljac (collectively, Respondents) filed\r\nthis action alleging nine causes of action against Atlantic: (1) breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act; (2) breach of contract; (3) quantum meruit/unjust\r\nenrichment; (4) conversion; (5) fraud and deceit/intentional misrepresentation; (6) breach of fiduciary duty; (7) Unfair Trade Practices Act violation; (8)\r\nmisappropriation of a trade secret; and (9) tortious interference with contracts.\r\nRespondents alleged that during 2001 and 2002, the parties entered into negotiations for a merger and for Richardson[2]\r\nto lease or purchase real property owned by SPD, which was owned by Desimone.&nbsp; Southeastern and Atlantic were both suffering from an economic downturn in\r\nthe construction industry and were in poor financial condition.&nbsp; Southeastern owned dirt pits, which according to Desimone, are &quot;very critical in a\r\nsite business, which Atlantic didn't have.&quot;&nbsp; Southeastern also owned its own extensive facility and was &quot;fully manned and ready to go for a heavy\r\nconstruction company,&quot; whereas Atlantic rented a facility on a month-to-month basis, and its lease was ending. &nbsp;Southeastern had engineering staff,\r\ncomputer technology, and survey skills, but lacked financial savvy.&nbsp; Also, Southeastern had bond capability of $2 million to $3 million and had been bonded\r\nfor $1.8 million in the past, whereas Atlantic had bond capability of only $750,000.&nbsp; Desimone testified: &quot;We kind of did the same things, although\r\nthey were much smaller and they wanted to move into the market.&nbsp; They had something that we needed; we had something that they needed and it just only made\r\nsense.&quot;\r\nFor five to six months beginning mid-2001, the companies' principals discussed the merger.&nbsp; During the negotiations, Southeastern disclosed\r\n&quot;confidential and proprietary business information, including but not limited to, customer lists, notes payable, pending and future contracts, and\r\nfinancial statements.&quot;&nbsp; Southeastern also provided information on its equipment, existing contracts, and possible future contracts.\r\nGeorge J. Akmon, the chief operating officer of the Richardson Group, was responsible for budgets, business plans, personnel, and cash planning for\r\nAtlantic.&nbsp; There were between thirty and fifty meetings between Southeastern and Atlantic, and the parties produced numerous memoranda memorializing the\r\nagreement.&nbsp; Most of the meetings were between Desimone and Akmon, with Richardson being involved in about ten of the meetings.&nbsp; In January or early\r\nFebruary 2002, Akmon, with the knowledge and consent of Richardson, prepared a document embodying the terms of the agreement and an extensive business plan\r\nincorporating the merger.&nbsp; According to Southeastern, the parties reached an agreement by January 30, 2002.&nbsp;\r\nPursuant to the alleged agreement, Richardson, individually, was to lease the property for $15,290.43 per month with an option to purchase for $1.6\r\nmillion.&nbsp; Southeastern was to contribute approximately $600,000 in equipment equity to Atlantic.&nbsp; Atlantic was to assume the notes payable on the\r\nequipment, hire Thomas Viljac of Southeastern as the chief of engineering, and hire Desimone as CEO for $6,000 per month, and eventually, a twenty percent\r\nequity interest in the merged company.&nbsp; Respondents maintain the closing documents were scheduled to be completed on February 14, 2002.&nbsp; No documents\r\nwere ever signed.\r\nOn February 6, 2002, Richardson called a meeting of the employees of both companies, announced the merger, and directed the employees of Southeastern to fill\r\nout payroll paperwork for Atlantic.&nbsp; Atlantic began paying the employees and met with a bonding company to get a performance bond.&nbsp; Atlantic sent a\r\nfacsimile to BB&amp;T Bank and requested a draw using two pieces of Southeastern's equipment as collateral.&nbsp; In the days following the February 6 meeting,\r\nAtlantic cut locks on the fences located at the property, replaced the Southeastern signs on the property and equipment with Atlantic signs, and moved in.\r\n&nbsp;The companies performed business as one during the following two weeks.&nbsp;\r\nOn February 13, 2002, Desimone went to the office and Atlantic's employee, Paul Fullmore, attacked him, hitting him twice in the head with a radio and\r\ngrabbing a gun from a truck.&nbsp; Thereafter, Akmon informed Desimone the &quot;deal was on hold.&quot;&nbsp; Richardson, per Akmon, then set a &quot;new\r\ndeal&quot; requiring Desimone to forego his job and his twenty percent equity interest.&nbsp; Desimone initially refused, but Akmon presented a second revision,\r\nand Desimone agreed because he had &quot;held off&quot; creditors based on the merger.&nbsp;\r\nOn February 18 and 19, 2002, Atlantic moved out.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Southeastern's past-due obligations, allegedly renegotiated based on the merger,\r\nbecame due.&nbsp; Creditors seized Southeastern's computers, and equipment with equity valued at between $400,000 and $856,000.&nbsp; These assets were\r\nallegedly resold at low auction prices.&nbsp; Atlantic's actions allegedly prevented Southeastern from servicing existing customers, attracting new customers,\r\nand continuing as a viable concern.&nbsp; Respondents alleged other damages including: (1) loss of future jobs; (2) missing equipment; (3) increased interest\r\nand attorney's fees on debts; (4) damaged reputation in the community; (5) loss of employees; (6) foregone opportunities to pay off its debt by open market\r\nsales, debt consolidation, or other partnerships; (7) personal judgments against Desimone and Viljac; (8) loss of profits on current and future contracts\r\nSoutheastern had been negotiating, some of which Atlantic performed; and (9) loss of goodwill.&nbsp; Southeastern ceased doing business by August 2002, and\r\nViljac and Desimone faced hundreds of thousands of dollars in judgments.&nbsp; Respondents filed this action in October 2003.&nbsp;\r\nThe parties engaged in lengthy and extensive discovery.&nbsp; Appellants filed a motion for summary judgment on May 31, 2005.&nbsp; At the March 7, 2006\r\nhearing on the motion before the Honorable Jackson V. Gregory, Respondents withdrew several causes of action.&nbsp; Respondents' counsel stated:&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Your Honor, there are a number of causes of action which I would be willing to withdraw at this point . . . . [W]e have now gone through a number of\r\ndepositions and I am willing to . . .&nbsp; withdraw . . . a number of the causes of action.&quot;&nbsp; Respondents withdrew the actions for quantum meruit/unjust\r\nenrichment, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, Unfair Trade Practices Act violation, and misappropriation of a trade secret.&nbsp; Judge Gregory granted\r\nsummary judgment to Appellants on the cause of action for tortious interference with contracts and on all causes of action as to the plaintiff Viljac.&nbsp;\r\nRespondents moved to amend their complaint.&nbsp; Judge Gregory ruled they could file a subsequent motion with an attached amended complaint.&nbsp;\r\nRespondents also conceded the original individual defendants, James N. Richardson, Jr. and George J. Akmon, were entitled to summary judgment on the breach\r\nof contract cause of action.&nbsp; Judge Gregory denied summary judgment as to the remaining causes of action by order dated September 26, 2006.&nbsp; In\r\ndenying summary judgment, Judge Gregory found &quot;a pretty good question of fact [as to] partial performance . . . to take it out of the statute of frauds . .\r\n. .&quot;&nbsp; The order also denied Respondents' motion to amend their complaint.&nbsp; However, the order granted leave to proceed in the future on a motion\r\nto amend to include the issue of piercing the corporate veil, &quot;at a later time when it would be more appropriate . . . .&quot;\r\nOn March 19, 2007, Judge Mullen presided over the hearing on Respondents' motion to amend the complaint, demand a jury trial, and compel Richardson to\r\nrespond to discovery requests for financial disclosures.&nbsp; Atlantic agreed to the amendment, but objected to the request for a jury trial.&nbsp; Judge\r\nMullen denied the request for a jury trial and granted the motion to amend the complaint.\r\nThe Honorable Thomas Kemmerlin, Jr. presided over the bench trial.&nbsp; At the start of the trial, Judge Kemmerlin refused to grant Appellants' renewed\r\nmotion for summary judgment.&nbsp; After Respondents presented their case, Appellants moved for summary disposition.&nbsp; Judge Kemmerlin took the voluminous\r\nrecord of depositions under advisement.&nbsp; By order dated April 8, 2009, Judge Kemmerlin dismissed the three remaining causes of action, finding the breach\r\nof contract causes of action were barred by the statute of frauds, and Respondents failed to prove fraud.&nbsp;\r\nAppellants moved for sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP, or the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act (the Act).&nbsp; In his order denying\r\nthe motion, Judge Kemmerlin found:\r\n\r\n  Obviously the mere loss of a case does not subject a party . . . to a suit by the winner for Sanctions; if it did, the Court System could not\r\n  function.&nbsp; And no lawyer should be held to a standard of brilliance in the prediction of the outcome of a lawsuit.&nbsp; Fortunately, the law does not\r\n  require an attorney to be brilliant; it merely requires him to be competent.&nbsp; Did the Plaintiffs' Attorneys fail to meet this standard?&nbsp; I say\r\n  &quot;No.&quot;\r\n  The case was complicated . . . [and the parties] at the early stages of the litigations referred to the result they sought as a &quot;merger.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n  What was sought was not a merger but some form of sale of real and personal properties â€“ which brought into play the statute of frauds and under that\r\n  statute [Plaintiffs were] required to have a writing sufficient to satisfy the statute, and what would be sufficient part performance if there was no\r\n  writing.&nbsp; I find that while the Plaintiffs' Attorneys could not get &quot;around&quot; the statute of frauds, I do not regard them as incompetent because\r\n  they were not successful.\r\n\r\nJudge Kemmerlin denied the motion for sanctions, concluding: &quot;Both sides fought the good fight.&quot;&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe determination of whether attorney's fees should be awarded under Rule 11 or under the Act is treated as one in equity.&nbsp; In re Beard, 359 S.C.\r\n351, 357, 597 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 2004) (applying an equitable standard of review of factual findings in action for sanctions under Rule 11 and the\r\nAct).&nbsp; In an action in equity tried by the judge alone, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;&quot;However, the abuse of discretion standard plays a role in the appellate review of a sanctions\r\naward.&quot;&nbsp; Ex parte Gregory, 378 S.C. 430, 437, 663 S.E.2d 46, 50 (2008).&nbsp; Where the appellate court agrees with the trial court's findings\r\nof fact, it reviews the decision to award sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Under the abuse of discretion standard, the\r\nimposition of sanctions will not be disturbed on appeal unless the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on unsupported factual\r\nconclusions.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in denying their motion for sanctions because (1) there were no good and reasonable grounds for the claims the\r\nRespondents withdrew; (2) the remaining claims had no reasonable legal or factual basis; (3) Respondents failed to provide competent evidence of damages; (4)\r\nRespondents failed to provide any evidence of fraud; and (5) Respondents pursued the claim as one for breach of a merger for six years before abandoning that\r\nposition at trial.[3]&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAppellants sought sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP, and under the Act. The parties dispute the version of the Act that applies to this case.&nbsp; The Act was\r\nsubstantially revised by 2005 S.C. Laws Act 27, effective July 1, 2005.&nbsp; Under the former version of the Act, the party seeking sanctions had to prove the\r\nparty sought to be sanctioned acted frivolously.&nbsp; See&nbsp; Father v. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 259, 578 S.E.2d 11, 13 (2003)\r\n(interpreting the Act as requiring frivolity to impose sanctions).&nbsp; The revisions to the Act created a &quot;reasonable attorney&quot; standard to\r\ndetermine whether sanctions are warranted.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; The revised Act states the revisions apply to causes of action\r\narising on or after July 1, 2005.&nbsp; 2005 S.C. Laws Act No. 27, Â§ 5.\r\nThis action was filed in 2003, and Appellants moved for summary judgment on May 31, 2005.&nbsp; These activities pre-date the revisions to the Act.&nbsp;\r\nRespondents withdrew several causes of action on March 7, 2006; Judge Kemmerlin issued his order dismissing the remaining causes of action on April 8, 2009; and\r\nAppellants filed their motion for sanctions on April 17, 2009.&nbsp; These activities occurred after the revisions to the Act.\r\nAppellants argue the revised Act applies in this case because their motion was filed after the revisions, and it is a violation of the Act to participate in\r\nthe continuation of frivolous proceedings.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(A)(4)(a)(iii) (Supp. 2010) (providing an attorney may be sanctioned for\r\nfiling a frivolous pleading, motion, or document if &quot;a reasonable attorney presented with the same circumstances would believe that the procurement,\r\ninitiation, continuation, or defense of a civil cause was intended merely to harass or injure the other party&quot;). &nbsp;Appellants rely on a footnote in Rutland\r\nv. Holler, Dennis, Corbett, Ormond &amp; Garner (Law Firm), 371 S.C. 91, 637 S.E.2d 316 (Ct. App. 2006), to support their argument.&nbsp;\r\nIn Rutland, the trial court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in a legal malpractice, breach of contract, and fraud action on August 9,\r\n2004.&nbsp; Id. at 95, 637 S.E.2d at 318.&nbsp; On September 1, 2004, the defendants moved for attorney's fees and costs under the Act.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court granted fees and costs by order dated September 20, 2005.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; On appeal, this court noted the revisions to the Act became\r\neffective July 1, 2005, and stated:&nbsp; &quot;Because [defendants] filed their motion on September 1, 2004, we believe the original Act still governed . . .\r\n.&nbsp; Moreover, [the plaintiff] does not challenge the applicability of the former Act.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 95 n.2, 637 S.E.2d at 318 n.2.&nbsp;\r\nOur supreme court has also recognized the revisions to the Act and applied &quot;the law as it existed at the time judgment was entered&quot; in utilizing\r\nthe former version of the Act.&nbsp; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 370 S.C. 5, 17 n.8, 633 S.E.2d 722, 728 n.8 (2006); but see Ex parte\r\nGregory, 378 S.C. 430, 432 n.1, 663 S.E.2d 46, 48 n.1 (2008) (finding the cause of action arose under the previous version of the Act without identifying\r\nthe triggering event). &nbsp;However, the issue of the retroactive or prospective application of the Act was not litigated in either Russell or Rutland.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWe, therefore, look to the general rules regarding the retroactive or prospective application of a statute.&nbsp; Absent a specific provision or clear\r\nlegislative intent  to the contrary, the general rule is that statutes are to be construed prospectively rather than retroactively, unless the statute is\r\nremedial or procedural in nature.&nbsp; Bartley v. Bartley Logging Co., 293 S.C. 88, 90, 359 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1987). &nbsp;A statute is remedial where it\r\ncreates new remedies for existing rights unless it violates a contractual obligation, creates a new right, or divests a vested right.&nbsp; Smith v. Eagle\r\nConstr. Co., 282 S.C. 140, 143, 318 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1984).&nbsp; &quot;[W]here a statute . . . creates new obligations [or] imposes a new duty . . . it will be\r\nconstrued as prospective only.&quot; 82 C.J.S. Statutes Â§ 585 (2009).\r\nWe find guidance from the analysis employed by the District Court of Appeals of Florida in Mullins v. Kennelly, 847 So.2d 1151 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\r\n2003).&nbsp; In determining whether a newly enacted portion of Florida's sanctions act applied retrospectively or prospectively, the court followed the federal\r\ncourts' view &quot;that whether conduct should be sanctioned should be measured by the standard in effect at the time of the conduct to be\r\nsanctioned.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 1154.&nbsp; The court opined:&nbsp; &quot;We endorse that view because such an interpretation helps achieve the\r\nprophylactic goal of the statute, while not retroactively penalizing a party for actions that occurred, or papers that were filed, when the earlier version of\r\n[the statute] controlled.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 1154-55.\r\nWe conclude the Act creates substantive rights and imposes new obligations by effectively changing the standard for imposing sanctions to a &quot;reasonable\r\nattorney&quot; standard.&nbsp; Therefore, the Act will apply prospectively absent clear indication to the contrary by the Legislature. &nbsp;In this case, the\r\nLegislature provided the revisions in the Act were to apply to causes of action arising on or after the effective date of the statute, July 1, 2005, and we find\r\nthis indicates the Legislature did not intend retrospective application.&nbsp; Accordingly, we apply the Act as it existed prior to the revisions.&nbsp; See\r\ngenerally Toth v. Square D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 8, 377 S.E.2d 584, 585 (1989) (stating judicial decisions which create liability where none previously\r\nexisted must be given prospective application).\r\nThe Act provided for liability for attorney's fees and costs of frivolous suits.&nbsp; Section 15-36-10 of the Act provided:\r\n\r\n  Any person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding is subject to being assessed for payment of all\r\n  or a portion of the attorney's fees and court costs of the other party if: (1) he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper . . .\r\n  &nbsp;adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are based; and (2) the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an assessment of\r\n  the fees and costs.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (2005) (current version at Supp. 2010).&nbsp; Section Â§ 15-36-20[4] &nbsp;provided:\r\n\r\n  Any person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of civil proceedings must be considered to have acted to secure a proper\r\n  purpose as stated in item (1) of Section 15-36-10 if he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which his claim is based and\r\n  (1) reasonably believes that under those facts his claim may be valid under the existing or developing law; or\r\n  . . .\r\n  (3) believes, as an attorney of record, in good faith that his procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of a civil cause is not intended to merely\r\n  harass or injure the other party.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-20 (2005) (repealed 2005).&nbsp;\r\nRule 11 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure also provides for sanctions and states in part:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp; Every pleading, motion or other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed in his individual name . . . . The signature of an\r\n  attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information and\r\n  belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay. . . . If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this\r\n  Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction,\r\n  which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion\r\n  or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\r\n\r\nRule 11(a), SCRCP.\r\nPrior to the revisions to the Act, the standard for sanctions under Rule 11 was essentially the same as that under the Act.&nbsp; Father v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nSoc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 262, 578 S.E.2d 11, 15 (2003) (comparing the standard for a Rule 11 sanction - a frivolous filing or argument, or bad faith\r\nfiling - with the Act's standard of frivolity).&nbsp; To be entitled to sanctions, the aggrieved party had to show that the party sought to be sanctioned acted\r\nfrivolously.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nWith the standard of frivolity in mind, we consider Respondents' argument that this court must affirm under Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485\r\nS.E.2d 903 (1997).&nbsp; In Hanahan, our supreme court reversed an award of sanctions under the previous version of the Act.&nbsp; Id. at 158, 485\r\nS.E.2d at 913.&nbsp; The court stated: &quot;[W]here a party survives a summary judgment motion, it is not subject to sanctions after a trial on the merits of\r\nthe surviving claims.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The court considered that there is a split of authority as to whether sanctions may be awarded\r\nnotwithstanding the denial of summary judgment.&nbsp; Id. at 157, 485 S.E.2d at 912.&nbsp; The court concurred with the view that &quot;a party who\r\nsurvives pre-trial motions to dismiss and for summary judgment [is] not subject to sanctions after a trial on the surviving claims.&nbsp; The theory behind\r\nthese cases is that if a case is submitted to the jury, it cannot be deemed frivolous.&quot;&nbsp; Id. (internal citations omitted).\r\nAppellants argue Hanahan does not apply in this instance, despite the denial of summary judgment by two trial court judges, because the action was\r\ndismissed after the Respondents presented their case rather than going to the jury or trial judge after a full trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find Hanahan applies\r\nin this case.&nbsp; In denying summary judgment as to breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act, and fraud, Judge Gregory found\r\n&quot;a pretty good question of fact [as to] partial performance . . . to take it out of the statute of frauds . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Judge Kemmerlin likewise\r\nrefused to grant Appellants summary judgment before the start of trial.&nbsp; Judge Kemmerlin conducted the bench trial.&nbsp; After Respondents presented their\r\ncase, Appellants requested the court allow them to get the transcript printed, and consider their motion to dismiss before presenting their case.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt granted the request.&nbsp; The court took the case under advisement and subsequently ruled.&nbsp; We find the rule in Hanahan applies in this\r\ncase.&nbsp; Because Respondents survived summary judgment motions, they are not subject to sanctions.&nbsp; Furthermore, we find even if Hanahan did not\r\napply in this case, because the trial court in essence granted a directed verdict after Respondents presented their case, Appellants have failed to show\r\nRespondents acted frivolously.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Richardson owned the Richardson Group, which owned Atlantic.\r\n[3] We combine Appellants' arguments, finding that all relate to the issue on appeal argued as Appellants' sixth\r\nissue:&nbsp; Whether Judge Kemmerlin erred in denying sanctions.\r\n[4] Sections 15-36-20 through -50 of the Act were repealed by 2005 S.C.

Usry, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:&nbsp; This appeal arises out of a nonjury trial resulting in an order awarding Respondent Ray Covington a first priority equitable lien\r\nsuperior to the mortgage of Appellant Regions Bank.&nbsp; On appeal, Regions Bank argues it should have priority because Covington's deposit check on his\r\ncontract with Wingard Properties, Inc. (Wingard) was not cashed prior to the recording of Regions Bank's mortgage.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nRegions Bank filed a complaint in the circuit court, seeking foreclosure of three different mortgages with Wingard.[2]&nbsp;\r\nAs collateral for a $7,000,000 revolving construction loan, Wingard mortgaged Lot 38 at the Village at Grande Dunes in Myrtle Beach to Regions Bank on November\r\n9, 2006.&nbsp; Regions Bank recorded its mortgage on Lot 38 in the Horry County Register of Deeds on November 13, 2006.&nbsp;\r\nPrior to Wingard's mortgage with Regions Bank, Covington entered into a residential home purchase agreement with Wingard for the sale of Lot 38 on September\r\n12, 2006.&nbsp; Covington wrote a check to Wingard for $276,700 on October 20, 2006, as a down payment according to the terms of the purchase agreement.&nbsp;\r\nWingard did not deposit this check in its bank account until November 14, 2006, the day after Regions Bank recorded its mortgage.&nbsp; Covington also wrote a\r\n$10,000 check to Grande Dunes Properties on September 3, 2006, which cleared the drawee bank on September 15, 2006.&nbsp; Regions Bank conceded at trial that\r\nCovington has an equitable lien with priority over its mortgage as to this $10,000.\r\nRegions Bank required Wingard to sell the unit for each lot as a precondition for the construction loan.&nbsp; According to testimony from Regions Bank\r\nemployee Stephanie Gates, the bank was aware of the sales contract with Covington before it advanced any funds to Wingard under the construction loan.&nbsp;\r\nFurther, Regions Bank required Wingard to produce evidence that Covington was qualified to purchase the home.&nbsp; In an undisputed ruling, the trial court\r\nfound Regions Bank admitted it would not have made the loan without Covington's purchase agreement and $286,700 deposit.\r\nRegions Bank disputes the findings of fact by the trial court concerning the lag between Wingard's receipt of Covington's deposit check on October 20th and\r\ndeposit of the check on November 14th.&nbsp; Tom Wingard testified he did not recall that Covington's check was not deposited until November 14, 2006, until he\r\nreviewed documentation later.&nbsp; Covington testified that he met with Bobby Roberson at BB&amp;T, who represented to him that BB&amp;T would cover the down\r\npayment on Lot 38.&nbsp; Covington believed at the time he presented the check to Wingard that the check would be good.&nbsp; Regions Bank presented Covington's\r\nbank records from Bank of America, which showed that the account was not adequately funded until November 14, 2006.&nbsp; Covington wrote the check from his\r\nBank of America account, although BB&amp;T was the bank Covington chose to finance his loan.\r\nRegions Bank also disputes that it had full knowledge of the terms of the purchase agreement between Wingard and Covington.&nbsp; Finally, Regions Bank\r\ndisputes the trial court's finding that the failure to grant Covington a first priority equitable lien would result in a forfeiture.&nbsp; Ultimately, the court\r\nfound that Covington was entitled to a $286,700 first priority equitable lien superior to Regions Bank's mortgage on Lot 38.&nbsp; Regions Bank filed a motion\r\nto alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.&nbsp; The court denied the motion in a written order following a hearing.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity.&nbsp; Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997).&nbsp; We review\r\nfactual findings and legal conclusions in an equitable action de novo.&nbsp; Lewis v. Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse\r\nAdv. Sh. No. 16 at 41, 47).&nbsp; However, this de novo review does not require an appellate court to disregard the findings of the trial court or to ignore the\r\nfact that the trial court is in the better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.&nbsp; Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d\r\n620, 623 (2001).&nbsp; Moreover, the appellant is not relieved of the burden of convincing the appellate court that the trial court committed error in its\r\nfindings.&nbsp; Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d at 623. &nbsp;Consequently, we will affirm the findings of the trial court in an equity case unless the\r\nappellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of the evidence is against the findings of the trial court.&nbsp; Lewis at 47.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nEquitable maxims are not binding legal precedent but represent notions and concepts of equity in various situations.&nbsp; See Russell L. Weaver, et\r\nal., Principles of Remedies Law 8 (2007) (&quot;[Equity courts] . . . began to develop 'rules' or 'maxims' governing equitable relief.&nbsp; Although\r\nthese 'maxims' were generalizations of experience based on the results of prior cases, they eventually developed into a loose set of 'rules' designed to bring\r\nsome coherency to the body of decided cases and some consistency to future decisions.&quot;).&nbsp; Maxims developed, at least in part, to reflect the attempt\r\nby the courts of equity to create guiding principles, in the same way that the legal courts developed binding precedent.&nbsp; See, e.g., Swetland v.\r\nCurtiss Airports Corp., 41 F.2d 929, 936 (D. Ohio 1930) (&quot;Maxims are but attempted general statements of rules of law.&nbsp; The judicial process is\r\nthe continuous effort on the part of the courts to state accurately these general rules, with their proper and necessary limitations and\r\nexceptions.&quot;).&nbsp; &quot;Even today, it is not unusual to find judges citing and applying these ancient maxims (much like modern courts use cases as\r\nprecedent) in deciding whether or not to grant equitable relief.&quot;&nbsp; Russell L. Weaver, et al., Remedies:&nbsp; Cases, Practical Problems, &amp;\r\nExercises 10 (2004).&nbsp; Thus, we view maxims only as offers of guidance in equitable cases.&nbsp; See, e.g., Brown v. Plata, No. 09-1233,\r\n2011 WL 1936074, at *28 (U.S. May 23, 2011) (discussing courts' substantial flexibility when deciding cases in equity, stating &quot;[o]nce invoked, the scope\r\nof a district court's equitable powers is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.&quot;) (internal citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted).&nbsp;\r\nIn deciding whether a party is entitled to a first priority equitable lien, courts are confronted with the interplay between equitable maxims and\r\nprinciples.&nbsp; This case involves the consideration and balancing of several equitable maxims: &nbsp;equity regards as done that which ought to have been\r\ndone; equity applies substance over form; equity abhors a forfeiture; equity follows the law; and one who seeks equity must do equity.&nbsp; The trial court\r\nreviewed substance over form in determining what ought to be done in this case by awarding Covington priority over Regions Bank's mortgage because the bank had\r\nknowledge of Covington's interest in Lot 38 before it recorded its mortgage.\r\nOn the other hand, Regions Bank argues Covington should not be allowed to claim an equitable lien superior to its own mortgage, even though Covington\r\ntendered a check prior to the date Regions Bank recorded its mortgage, because Covington knew that his account did not contain sufficient funds.&nbsp; Regions\r\nBank asks the court to distinguish Covington's claim from the facts in South Carolina Federal Savings Bank v. San-A-Bel Corporation, 307 S.C. 76, 413\r\nS.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 1992), because Covington is an experienced real estate broker who should have known his account did not contain sufficient funds to cover\r\nhis down payment check.&nbsp; Covington claims Regions Bank's mortgage is subject to Covington's known equity in the property.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;For an equitable lien to arise, there must be a debt, specific property to which the debt attaches, and an expressed or implied intent that the\r\nproperty serve as security for payment of the debt.&quot;&nbsp; First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n of S.C. v. Finn, 300 S.C. 228, 231, 387 S.E.2d 253, 254\r\n(1989).&nbsp; An equitable lien is a &quot;mere floating equity until a judgment or decree subjecting the property to the payment of the debt or claim is\r\nrendered.&quot;&nbsp; Horry Cnty. v. Ray, 382 S.C. 76, 83-84, 674 S.E.2d 519, 524 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).&nbsp;\r\nEven though an equitable lien is not judicially recognized until a judgment is entered declaring its existence, the lien relates back to the time it was created\r\nby the conduct of the parties.&nbsp; Id. at 84, 674 S.E.2d at 524.&nbsp; Whether an equitable lien exists that would take priority over a mortgage must\r\nbe considered in conjunction with other well-recognized equitable principles.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Equitable liens must rest on an express or implied\r\ncontract; moral obligations do not sustain equitable liens.&nbsp; Carolina Attractions, Inc. v. Courtney, 287 S.C. 140, 145, 337 S.E.2d 244, 247 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1985).&nbsp;\r\nOne of the cases relied upon by the trial court in awarding an equitable lien, San-A-Bel, is factually similar to the matter at hand.&nbsp; In San-A-Bel,\r\nthis court found that purchasers of existing contracts for as yet unconstructed condominium units in a residential development project defeated the mortgage\r\nlien priority of the bank because the contracts of sale between the developer and the purchasers existed before the bank made a construction loan.&nbsp; 307\r\nS.C. 76, 79, 413 S.E.2d 852, 854.&nbsp; The court reasoned that the bank had notice of the equitable interest that the purchasers had in the property.&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 79-80, 413 S.E.2d at 854-55.&nbsp; There are many factual similarities between San-A-Bel and this case:&nbsp; the purchasers executed preconstruction\r\nsales contracts with the developer; the bank knew about the preconstruction sales contracts at the time it made the construction loan; and neither the sales\r\ncontracts nor the bank's note and mortgage contained a provision subordinating the purchasers' rights to the rights of the bank.&nbsp; See id. at\r\n77-78, 413 S.E.2d at 853-54.&nbsp; The bank in both San-A-Bel and in the case at hand required the developer to sell the property before it would make a\r\nconstruction loan.&nbsp; See id. at 79, 413 S.E.2d at 854.&nbsp;\r\nThere is, however, one very important factual difference between San-A-Bel and this case.&nbsp; The purchasers in San-A-Bel deposited a cash\r\ndown payment at the same time as the execution of the contracts for sale.&nbsp; Id. at 77, 413 S.E.2d at 853.&nbsp; Covington, on the other hand,\r\nexecuted the contract on September 14, 2006, and then modified the agreement with Wingard on October 20, 2006.&nbsp; Covington delivered a check for his 10%\r\ndown payment pursuant to the terms of the contract on October 20, 2006.&nbsp; However, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Wingard did not present the\r\ncheck for deposit until November 14, 2006, the day after Regions Bank recorded its mortgage.&nbsp;\r\nRegions Bank claims there is evidence to support a finding that Covington and Wingard colluded to hold the deposit check until there were enough funds in\r\nCovington's Bank of America account to cover the check.&nbsp; Regions Bank points to an email from Tom Wingard to Covington dated Wednesday, November 1, 2006,\r\nindicating that Bobby Roberson with BB&amp;T (the bank covering Covington's financing for Lot 38) told Wingard the check &quot;should be good by\r\nFriday.&quot;&nbsp; Regions Bank interprets these actions, along with Tom Wingard's testimony that he often held checks by request, as evidence that Covington\r\nintentionally waited until after Regions Bank recorded its mortgage to fund the account and make his down payment.&nbsp; Given the respective knowledge and\r\npositions of the parties at the time Regions Bank acquired its interest, Regions Bank contends the equities tip in its favor because any other result would\r\nreward Covington's efforts to &quot;game the system&quot; by tendering his check prior to the closing to help Wingard secure financing, but not putting any\r\nfunds at risk until after the deal had closed.\r\nIn considering whether to award a first priority equitable lien to Covington, we also consider the equities involved.&nbsp; Courts have the inherent power to\r\ndo all things reasonably necessary to ensure that just results are reached to the fullest extent possible.&nbsp; Buckley v. Shealey, 370 S.C. 317,\r\n323-24, 635 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2006) (citing Ex Parte Dibble, 279 S.C. 592, 310 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 1983)).&nbsp; &quot;For one to have notice of an\r\noutstanding equitable interest, [one need not] know the identity of the third party or the extent of his interest.&nbsp; It is sufficient that one either knows\r\nor ought to know that some third party interest exists.&quot;&nbsp; San-A-Bel at 79, 413 S.E.2d at 854.&nbsp; Even though Regions Bank may not have had\r\nknowledge that Wingard had not deposited Covington's down payment at the time it gave Wingard a mortgage, Regions Bank was fully aware of Covington's interest\r\nin Lot 38.&nbsp; Further, as noted by the trial court, Regions Bank had full knowledge of the amount of Covington's down payment and was not prejudiced by the\r\ntiming of the deposit of Covington's check.&nbsp; Covington complied with the terms of his purchase agreement and played no role in Wingard's default.&nbsp; Our\r\nanalysis is not controlled by whether Covington withheld his deposit until after Regions Bank recorded its mortgage because the most important factor in\r\nbalancing the equities in this matter is Regions Bank's knowledge of Covington's interest.&nbsp; As to this knowledge factor, Regions Bank does not dispute that\r\nit:&nbsp; (1) knew Covington entered into a contract for the home and (2) knew the amount of Covington's down payment.&nbsp; If Regions Bank intended for\r\nreceipt of the down payment by Wingard to be a prerequisite for giving the loan, Regions Bank could have included a contractual provision in its agreement with\r\nWingard and it did not do so.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial court rejected any finding of collusion.&nbsp; While there is conflicting evidence on this issue, we are\r\nnot prepared to find that the preponderance of the evidence is contrary to the finding of the trial court.&nbsp;\r\nCourts should also balance other equitable concerns when deciding whether a party is entitled to an equitable lien.&nbsp; Regions Bank claims the trial court\r\nerroneously relied on the equitable maxims &quot;equity treats as done that which ought to be done&quot; and &quot;equity looks to substance rather than\r\nform.&quot;&nbsp; Rather, Regions Bank claims equity should follow the law and reward the party who filed first according to section 30-7-10 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2007).&nbsp; Covington argues the trial court did not rely solely on these maxims and correctly balanced these equitable considerations with the\r\nrule set forth in San-A-Bel.&nbsp;\r\nAs previously indicated, equitable maxims are not binding legal doctrines.&nbsp; Instead, these maxims have evolved over a long period of time from prior\r\ncases to assist a court in applying and balancing equitable considerations.&nbsp; The principle &quot;equity regards as done that which ought to be done&quot;\r\napplies in cases where the party seeking equitable relief establishes &quot;a clear obligation based upon a valuable consideration that another do some act\r\nwhich he has failed to perform.&quot;&nbsp; Wilkie v. Phila. Life Ins. Co., 187 S.C. 382, 393-94, 197 S.E. 375, 380 (1938).&nbsp; The notion &quot;equity\r\nlooks to substance rather than form&quot; evolved out of judicial regard for that which ought to be done.&nbsp; Id. at 393, 197 S.E. at 380.&nbsp; This\r\nmaxim applies by &quot;dispensing with pure formalities which would otherwise defeat the equity.&quot;&nbsp; Id.; see also Kerr v. City of\r\nColumbia, 232 S.C. 405, 410, 102 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1958) (finding the court must consider the controversy as though town council had issued a business\r\npermit, even though the town claimed the area was a residential zone, because town officials told the owner his property was in a commercial zone).&nbsp; When\r\napplying this principle, courts look to the substance and intent of the parties, and give a construction consistent with such intent. &nbsp;Harpending v.\r\nReformed Protestant Dutch Church of City of N.Y., 41 U.S. 455, 480 (1842).&nbsp; After a party establishes an equitable right, the court may dispense with\r\npure formalities which would otherwise defeat the equity. &nbsp;Wilkie, 187 S.C. at 393, 197 S.E. at 380.&nbsp; A court of equity should scrutinize the\r\nconduct of the plaintiff with the utmost care, to ascertain he has done everything which ought to have been done to secure the action requested.&nbsp; Corbus\r\nv. Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining Co., 187 U.S. 455, 465 (1903).&nbsp; This maxim has at times guided a court to relieve a party from the consequences of\r\naccident, mistake, and fraud. &nbsp;Camp v. Boyd, 229 U.S. 530, 559 (1913). &nbsp;&quot;The rule that equity considers as done that which should be done\r\ncannot be invoked to create a right contrary to the agreement of the parties.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Good v. Jarrard, 93 S.C. 229, 239, 76 S.E. 698,\r\n702 (1912).&nbsp;\r\nUtilizing the above equitable principles for guidance, the trial court noted Regions Bank made its loan to Wingard in reliance on the purchase contract and\r\ndown payment made by Covington.&nbsp; Regions Bank did not know Covington's check had not been deposited by Wingard before it recorded its mortgage. &nbsp;The\r\ncourt also noted that Wingard used Covington's funds in the construction of other homes financed by Regions Bank, such that Regions Bank benefitted from\r\nCovington's down payment.&nbsp; We agree with the trial court that Regions Bank was not prejudiced by the timing of the deposit of Covington's check.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the trial court appropriately looked at substance over form in awarding Covington a first priority equitable lien based on Regions Bank's knowledge\r\nof his interest in Lot 38.&nbsp;\r\nRegions Bank argues that equity should follow the law and reward the party who filed first.&nbsp; &quot;It is well known that equity follows the law.&quot;\r\n&nbsp;Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 164, 650 S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ct. App. 2007).&nbsp; Utilizing this maxim, courts have denied equitable relief. &nbsp;See\r\nMorgan v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 377 S.C. 313, 319-20, 659 S.E.2d 263, 267 (Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp; However, where a substantive right exists, an\r\nequitable remedy may be fashioned to give effect to that right.&nbsp; E. Tenn. Natural Gas Co. v. Sage, 361 F.3d 808, 823 (4th Cir. 2004). &nbsp;When\r\nproviding an equitable remedy, the court may not ignore statutes, rules, and other precedent. &nbsp;Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 323 (1996).\r\n&nbsp;&quot;[T]he court's equitable powers must yield in the face of an unambiguously worded statute.&quot;&nbsp; Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub.\r\nServ. Comm'n, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989); see also Key Corporate Capital, Inc. v. Cnty. of Beaufort, 373 S.C. 55, 61, 644\r\nS.E.2d 675, 678 (2007) (finding error in fashioning an equitable remedy).\r\nThe recording statute found in section 30-7-10 of the South Carolina Code provides that all mortgages are valid, without notice, from the day they are\r\nrecorded in the register of deeds for the county where the real property is located.&nbsp; Deeds are valid as to subsequent purchasers without notice when they\r\nare recorded.&nbsp; Murrells Inlet Corp. v. Ward, 378 S.C. 225, 232-33, 662 S.E.2d 452, 455 (Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp; The purpose of the recording statute\r\nis to protect a subsequent buyer without notice.&nbsp; Frierson v. Watson, 371 S.C. 60, 67, 636 S.E.2d 872, 875 (Ct. App. 2006).&nbsp; In the common law\r\nand in equity, a purchase money mortgage will ordinarily be given priority over other security instruments in realty.&nbsp; Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank of\r\nS.C. v. Smith, 277 S.C. 162, 164, 284 S.E.2d 770, 771 (1981).&nbsp; However, if the mortgage holder has notice of a prior purchase money mortgage, then it\r\ncannot prevail under the recording statute by virtue of filing first.&nbsp; Crystal Ice Co. of Columbia, Inc. v. First Colonial Corp., 273 S.C. 306, 308,\r\n257 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1979).&nbsp;\r\nHere, Covington's equitable interest is not defeated by Regions Bank's mortgage because Covington entered into his purchase contract before Regions Bank\r\nfiled its mortgage with the register of deeds and Regions Bank was aware of this interest.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (&quot;[A]ll mortgages . .\r\n. are valid so as to affect the rights of subsequent creditors (whether lien creditors or simple contract creditors), or purchasers for valuable consideration\r\nwithout notice . . . .&quot;).&nbsp; The intervention of equity does not impugn the integrity of the recording statute in this case. &nbsp;See Crystal\r\nIce Co., 273 S.C. at 308, 257 S.E.2d at 497 (finding a first-to-file mortgage holder not entitled to the protection of the recording statute where that\r\nmortgage holder had knowledge of the existence of a prior purchase money mortgage).&nbsp; The trial court was presented with the question of whether equity\r\nshould intervene only as between Regions Bank and Covington, not any other person or creditor potentially impacted by the recording statute.&nbsp; The trial\r\ncourt appropriately looked at the substance of the issue, namely Regions Bank's knowledge of Covington's prior interest, over Covington's failure to ensure that\r\nhis down payment was received by Wingard prior to closing.&nbsp; In fact, Regions Bank would not have given Wingard a construction loan if Wingard had not\r\nalready sold the lot to a purchaser.&nbsp; Therefore, just as equity was allowed to intervene in San-A-Bel and Crystal Ice, we conclude the record\r\nherein supports the trial court's award to Covington of priority on his equitable lien over Regions Bank's mortgage.&nbsp;\r\nWe next turn to the trial court's consideration of the possibility of forfeiture by Covington. &nbsp;Regions Bank argues the trial court erred in finding\r\nCovington would forfeit his deposit if not given a first priority equitable lien because Covington would still be able to assert a claim against Wingard to\r\nrecover his $276,700 deposit.&nbsp; Covington asserts the trial court properly applied the equitable principle that equity disfavors a forfeiture.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;A court of equity abhors forfeitures, and will not lend its aid to enforce them.&quot; &nbsp;Jones v. N.Y. Guar. &amp; Indem. Co., 101 U.S. 622,\r\n628 (1879). &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Equity does not favor forfeitures or penalties and will relieve against them when practicable in the interest of justice.&quot;\r\n&nbsp;Lane v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 147 S.C. 333, 374, 145 S.E. 196, 209 (1928).&nbsp; The court has the power in equity to deny or delay forfeiture when\r\nfairness demands.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 172, 568 S.E.2d 361, 364 (2002).&nbsp; &nbsp;In Lewis, the court found it\r\nwould be inequitable to enforce the forfeiture provision without first allowing the purchaser an opportunity to redeem the contract by paying the entire\r\npurchase price. &nbsp;Id.&nbsp; The court looked at case-specific factors in making this determination, specifically the amount of equity the purchaser\r\nhad accumulated, the length and number of defaults, the amount of forfeiture, the speed in which equity was sought, and the amount of money the purchaser would\r\nforfeit in relation to the purchase price of the property. &nbsp;Id.\r\nCovington also claims Regions Bank will be unjustly enriched if the bank's mortgage is given priority over Covington's $276,700 equitable lien.&nbsp; Unjust\r\nenrichment is an equitable doctrine, which permits recovery of the amount that the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.&nbsp; Dema\r\nv. Tenet Physician Servs. Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 115, 123, 678 S.E.2d 430, 434 (2009); Ellis v. Smith Grading &amp; Paving, Inc., 294 S.C. 470,\r\n474, 366 S.E.2d 12, 15 (Ct. App. 1988). &nbsp;The elements to recover for unjust enrichment based on quantum meruit, quasi-contract, or implied by law contract,\r\nwhich are equivalent terms for equitable relief, are: &quot;(1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the\r\ndefendant; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its\r\nvalue.&quot;&nbsp; Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court did not expressly find that Regions Bank would be unjustly enriched or that Covington had suffered a forfeiture as a certainty; rather, the\r\ntrial court found a substantial likelihood of forfeiture and noted the equitable considerations in Elliott v. Snyder, 246 S.C. 186, 143 S.E.2d 374\r\n(1965), were identical to those presented in the present matter.[3]&nbsp; In Elliott, the seller sought\r\nrescission and cancellation of a contract for the sale of land.&nbsp; Id. at 189, 143 S.E.2d at 375.&nbsp; Pursuant to the contract, the purchaser was\r\nrequired to make annual installment payments.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The purchaser's check dated December 31st was returned to the seller marked &quot;drawn\r\nagainst uncollected funds.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 190, 143 S.E.2d at 375.&nbsp; The check was presented for deposit on January 4th, one day after the\r\npurchaser had deposited sufficient funds to cover the check on January 3rd; however, the purchaser's bank did not release the funds until January 9th.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough the contract provided that the property would revert to the seller without recourse in the event of default, the court found the purchaser\r\nsubstantially complied with the contract.&nbsp; Id. at 191, 143 S.E.2d at 376.&nbsp; In doing so, the court declined to rescind the contract and noted\r\n&quot;[f]orfeitures are not favored in law and [c]ourts will seize upon even slight evidence to prevent one . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 191, 143 S.E.2d at\r\n375-76.\r\nIn its order denying Regions Bank's motion to alter or amend, the trial court clarified:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Although the Court's Order notes that there is a substantial likelihood that Covington will forfeit $276,700.00 of his investment if the Court does not\r\n  rule in his favor, the Court's decision does not rest on a finding that Covington will in fact forfeit $276,700 of his investment.&nbsp; There is no need for\r\n  the Court to make a finding that forfeiture is certain to result in order to rule in favor of Covington, as the Court's Order does not rest entirely upon the\r\n  holding in Elliott.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is inescapable that in the current economic climate, with a partially constructed home, there is a\r\n  substantial likelihood that Covington will forfeit some or all of his $276,700.00 investment, and there is ample evidence that a risk of forfeiture exists.\r\n\r\nRegions Bank advanced over $1 million to Wingard towards the purchase of and construction on Lot 38.[4]&nbsp; As\r\nthe trial court noted, there was a substantial likelihood that the lot, which Wingard purchased for $965,000, would sell for an amount less than Covington's\r\nfirst priority $10,000 lien and Regions Bank's mortgage lien.&nbsp; The trial court concluded it need not decide this case based solely on whether or not\r\nCovington was &quot;certain&quot; to suffer a forfeiture.&nbsp; Instead, the trial court properly considered the substantial likelihood of forfeiture in\r\nbalancing the equities to find Covington was entitled to a first priority equitable lien.&nbsp; We also note Regions Bank has already obtained a judgment,\r\nincluding interest, against Wingard, Tom Wingard, and Deborah Wingard; however, Regions Bank voluntarily waived its right to a deficiency judgment against Tom\r\nand Deborah Wingard but maintained its right to obtain a deficiency against Wingard, the corporate entity.&nbsp; In reviewing the record de novo, we find\r\nRegions Bank has not carried its burden of convincing us that the trial court committed error in its findings regarding this forfeiture issue.&nbsp; See Lewis\r\nv. Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 41, 47) (applying de novo review).&nbsp;\r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, Covington claims Regions Bank, as a plaintiff coming to court seeking relief in equity, must also do equity in order that\r\njustice might be done between the parties.&nbsp; Regions Bank knew Covington had made a down payment under his purchase contract at the time it filed its\r\nforeclosure action and does not dispute Covington's $10,000 first priority equitable lien.&nbsp; Despite this knowledge, Regions Bank failed to name Covington\r\nas a defendant in the foreclosure action, forcing Covington to intervene.&nbsp; Covington claims Regions Bank sought a windfall by failing to name Covington in\r\nthe lawsuit, even though it was aware of Covington's interest.&nbsp;\r\nThis equitable maxim is commonly phrased as &quot;[h]e who seeks equity must do equity.&quot; &nbsp;Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver,\r\n317 S.C. 471, 479, 451 S.E.2d 924, 929 (1994).&nbsp; This principle applies to one who affirmatively seeks equitable relief.&nbsp; City of Columbus v.\r\nMercantile Trust &amp; Deposit Co., 218 U.S. 645, 662 (1910).&nbsp; In order for justice to be done between parties, a party is required to do equity when\r\nasking the court to invoke the aid of equity. &nbsp;See Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 107, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000) (declining to\r\ngrant a plaintiff's request for specific performance where the plaintiff misled the defendants); Anderson v. Marion, 274 S.C. 40, 43, 260 S.E.2d 715, 716\r\n(1979) (finding defendants who sought equity against the plaintiffs for specific performance were required to do equity and pay plaintiffs money they asserted\r\nthey were willing and able to pay); Shumaker v. Shumaker, 234 S.C. 421, 427, 108 S.E.2d 682, 686 (1959) (&quot;Plaintiffs who come into Court invoking\r\nthe aid of equity should be required to do equity in order that justice might be done between the parties.&quot;); Anderson v. Purvis, 211 S.C. 255, 266,\r\n44 S.E.2d 611, 616 (1947) (discussing the maxim that he who seeks equity should do equity).&nbsp;\r\nAlthough Covington makes a compelling argument that Regions Bank's failure to name him in the foreclosure action suggests Regions Bank attempted to\r\ncircumvent Covington's interest, Covington cannot show he was prejudiced because he was able to intervene and has participated fully in the lawsuit.&nbsp;\r\nBecause the decision of whether to prevent Regions Bank from seeking equitable relief is discretionary, and Covington was allowed to join the lawsuit without\r\nprejudice to his claim, we decline to affirm based on this additional sustaining ground.&nbsp;\r\nRegions Bank also argues the trial court erred in ruling that the payment of a check relates back to the date it was delivered.&nbsp; Regions Bank asks the\r\ncourt to undertake a factually intensive analysis, as did the court in San-A-Bel, to determine that it would be inequitable to credit Covington with\r\nhaving paid the check on the date of delivery.&nbsp; Covington argues that it is well-settled in other jurisdictions that payment of a check, when honored upon\r\npresentment, relates back to the date the check is delivered to the payee.&nbsp; After considering the equities at play in this matter, we find the trial court\r\nproperly concluded Covington is entitled to a first priority equitable lien based on Regions Bank's knowledge of Covington's interest in Lot 38.&nbsp; Thus, we\r\nneed not decide whether Covington's check relates back to the date of delivery or should be considered paid upon delivery.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, Regions Bank also argues it should have priority over Covington's equitable lien because the future advances made to Wingard relate back to the date\r\nof the mortgage pursuant to section 29-3-50(A) of the South Carolina Code (2007).&nbsp; Initially, we note this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the\r\ntrial court.&nbsp; See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. Horry Cnty., 391 S.C. 76, 82-83, 705 S.E.2d 21, 25 (2011) (finding an issue must be raised to and\r\nruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review).&nbsp; Nonetheless, even if the advances made by Regions Bank after Covington's\r\ncheck was deposited relate back to the date of the mortgage, Covington's equitable lien is still entitled to priority because of Regions Bank's knowledge of\r\nCovington's interest.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Wingard is not a party to the appeal.\r\n[3] In light of our disposition herein, we decline to address whether unjust enrichment may serve as an additional\r\nsustaining ground.&nbsp; See Futch v.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.&nbsp; 4847\r\nHeard March 9, 2011 â€“ Filed June 22, 2011\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Charles L. Henshaw, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Richard B. Ness, of Bamberg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:&nbsp; The parents of Samuel G. Smith, Jr., brought a negligence claim on behalf of themselves and their minor child (collectively the\r\nSmiths) for the treatment Smith received from The Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg and Calhoun Counties (TRMC), a governmental entity under the Tort Claims\r\nAct (TCA).[1]&nbsp; The Smiths appeal the trial court's granting of partial summary judgment to TRMC based on its\r\nfinding that a governmental hospital cannot be held liable for the negligent acts or omissions of an independent contractor, as prescribed by the TCA.&nbsp; The\r\nSmiths argue TRMC should be held liable under a nondelegable duty of care owed by a hospital.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 1, 2000, Smith was taken to TRMC for emergency services. Smith had a previous medical history of seizures related to his genetic disorder,\r\ntuberous sclerosis. &nbsp;Upon his arrival to the emergency room, Smith was observed to be cyanotic and not breathing. &nbsp;After several attempts to\r\nrevive him, it was decided that an endotracheal tube for oxygenation was needed and Dr. Elizabeth Lewis was called to the emergency room to administer the\r\nplacement of the tube.\r\nDr. Lewis placed the tube into Smith's airway; however, his condition did not improve. &nbsp;It was determined that the tube was not functioning properly\r\nbecause it was misplaced. &nbsp;The Smiths offered testimony from an expert that the tube was five centimeters longer than it needed to be and the length\r\n&quot;unnecessarily endangered&quot; Smith because it obstructed his airway.&nbsp; The Smiths further asserted that because of the misplacement, he was deprived\r\nof oxygen and suffered hypoxic brain injury.\r\nAt the time of this event, Dr. Lewis was providing anesthesia coverage at TRMC on a temporary basis through Staff Care, which had an agreement to place\r\nphysicians in the hospital.&nbsp; Dr. Lewis had an employment contract with Staff Care.\r\nThe Smiths commenced this lawsuit on November 1, 2002. The trial court ordered that Dr. Lewis be added as a defendant on the allegations that she was an\r\nindependent contractor. &nbsp;The Smiths allege Dr. Lewis and TRMC jointly undertook to render emergency services and anesthesiology care. Through that care,\r\nthe Smiths argue Smith suffered deprivation of oxygen resulting in a brain injury that could have been prevented or mitigated had Dr. Lewis exercised due care.\r\nSpecifically, they contend Dr. Lewis was negligent in failing to (1) manage Smith's airway, (2) timely realize the misplacement of the endotracheal tube, and\r\n(3) timely reposition the tube.\r\nThe trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of TRMC.&nbsp; The trial court indicated under a plain reading of the TCA, TRMC could not be held\r\nvicariously liable for any negligence on the part of Dr. Lewis, because she was an independent contractor.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not requiring the services of a fact finder.&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C.\r\n440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial\r\ncourt under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as\r\na matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002) (citations omitted).&nbsp; &quot;Determining the proper\r\ninterpretation of a statute is a question of law, and this Court reviews questions of law de novo.&quot;&nbsp; Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston,\r\n378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Smiths contend the trial court erred in concluding a governmental hospital cannot be held liable for the negligent acts or omissions of an independent\r\ncontractor.&nbsp; They argue governmental hospitals cannot maintain immunity by hiring independent contractors to perform medical services, citing a\r\nnondelegable duty of care owed by a hospital to emergency room patients. &nbsp;We disagree.\r\n&quot;The doctrine of nondelegable duty has traditionally been used to describe a form of vicarious liability.&quot;&nbsp; Martin C. McWilliams, Jr. &amp;\r\nHamilton E. Russell, III, Hospital Liability for Torts of Independent Contractor Physicians, 47 S.C. L. Rev. 431, 452 (1996). &quot;The real effect of\r\nfinding a duty to be nondelegable is to render not the duty, but the liability, not delegable . . . .&quot; Id.\r\n\r\n  A person may delegate a duty to an independent contractor, but if the independent contractor breaches that duty by acting negligently or improperly,\r\n  the delegating person remains liable for that breach. It actually is the liability, not the duty that is not delegable. The party which owes the\r\n  nondelegable duty is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of the independent contractor.\r\n\r\nSimmons v. Tuomey Reg'l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 42, 533 S.E.2d 312, 317 (2000) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).&nbsp; Thus, &quot;the doctrine of\r\nnondelegable duty is an exception to the general rule of nonliability for the torts of independent contractors.&quot; &nbsp;McWilliams &amp; Russell, 47 S.C. L.\r\nRev. at 453.\r\nOn appeal, the Smiths do not contend that the trial court erred in its determination that Dr. Lewis was an independent contractor.&nbsp; Rather, they cite Simmons\r\nfor the proposition that TRMC is liable for the negligence of Dr. Lewis despite the fact that she does not meet the definition of &quot;employee&quot; under the\r\nTCA.&nbsp; The Smiths argue the nondelegable duty of a hospital to render emergency services, recognized in Simmons, permits a governmental hospital to\r\nbe liable for the negligence of an independent contractor.&nbsp; However, the duty discussed in Simmons does not necessarily apply to an independent\r\ncontractor of a government hospital.&nbsp; Simmons merely found a nongovernmental hospital could not delegate its duty to render competent emergency room\r\nservices to its patients and, therefore, may be vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor.&nbsp; 341 S.C. at 50-51, 533 S.E.2d at\r\n322.&nbsp; In this case, we are presented with whether a governmental hospital subject to the TCA may be liable for alleged negligent acts or omissions\r\ncommitted by an independent contractor.&nbsp; We find it cannot.\r\nUnlike the private hospital analyzed in Simmons, TRMC is a governmentally funded hospital that is statutorily governed by the TCA.&nbsp; The TCA\r\n&quot;governs all tort claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available in an action against a governmental entity . . .\r\n.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 203, 584 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp; The Legislature has stated its intent to\r\n&quot;grant the State, its political subdivisions, and employees, while acting within the scope of official duty, immunity from liability and suit for any tort\r\nexcept as waived.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(b) (2005).&nbsp; &quot;The State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a governmental entity are\r\nliable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability and\r\ndamages, and exemptions from liability and damages&quot; contained in the TCA.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005).&nbsp; Furthermore, the code provides the\r\nprovisions of the TCA &quot;must be liberally construed in favor of limiting the liability of the State.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(f) (2005).&nbsp;\r\nSpecifically excluded from the definition of &quot;employee,&quot; however, are independent contractors:\r\n\r\n  &quot;Employee&quot; means any officer, employee, agent, or court appointed representative of the State or appointed officials, law enforcement officers,\r\n  and persons acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity in the scope of official duty including, but not limited to, technical experts whether\r\n  with or without compensation, but the term does not include an independent contractor doing business with the State or a political subdivision of the State.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(c) (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).&nbsp; Therefore, the entity is not liable for a loss resulting from &quot;an act or omission of\r\na person other than an employee including but not limited to the criminal actions of third persons.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(20) (2005).\r\nBecause TRMC is a governmental entity, the TCA governs the civil claims and remedies to which TRMC is subject.&nbsp; The TCA codifies qualified and limited\r\nliability and shields the state and its political subdivisions, like TRMC, from liability for certain acts and omissions.&nbsp; The Legislature, through the TCA,\r\nhas (1) stated its intention for independent contractors to be excluded from the definition of employee, (2) mandated strict construction of statutory language,\r\n(3) developed a policy of liberally construing the TCA in favor of immunity and limiting liability, and (4) declared that the TCA is the public policy of South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, Smith argues Madison v. Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 638 S.E.2d 650 (2006), requires a finding that TRMC may be liable as a\r\ngovernment entity for the acts of its independent contractor.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; Madison specifically held that a governmental entity to which the\r\nimmunity exemptions of the TCA applied is not liable for the acts or omissions of its independent contractor.&nbsp; Id. at 142-43, 638 S.E.2d at\r\n660.&nbsp; However, the court found a governmental entity could be liable for a duty directly owed, independent of any acts or omission of the independent\r\ncontractor.&nbsp; Id. (stating this duty &quot;may include (1) adequately supervising the provision of services by another entity or (2) its own conduct\r\nin relation to prior notice of inappropriate care of its clients by such entity&quot;).&nbsp; Essentially, if the duty breached is one owed directly by the\r\ngovernmental entity to the client, the TCA's immunity may not insulate the entity from liability.\r\nHere, the trial court order and briefs on appeal discuss only the alleged negligent breach of Dr. Lewis's duty and TRMC's vicarious liability for that\r\nbreach.&nbsp; The TCA and Madison foreclose a finding of liability against TRMC on that basis.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe TCA provides immunity to governmental entities, such as TRMC, from the negligence of its independent contractors.&nbsp; Accordingly, the judgment of the\r\ntrial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] TRMC qualifies as a governmental entity because it is a governmental health care facility within the\r\ndefinition of section 15-78-30(j) of the South Carolina Code (2005), which states a '&quot;governmental health care facility' means one which is operated by the\r\nState or a political subdivision through a governing board appointed or elected pursuant to statute or ordinance and which is tax-exempt under state and federal\r\nlaws as a governmental entity and from which no part of its net income from its operation accrues to the benefit of any individual or nongovernmental\r\nentity.&quot;&nbsp; Specifically, TRMC is funded by Orangeburg and Calhoun counties.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
