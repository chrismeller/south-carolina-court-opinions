Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  4440\r\n  Heard September 16, 2008 â€“ Filed October 7,\r\n2008\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        E. Leroy Nettles, Sr. and Marian D.\r\n          Nettles, both of Lake City, for Appellant.\r\n        Robert Brown, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â \r\n  Ted Corbett (Corbett) brought a negligence action against Jordan William Weaver\r\n  (Jordan) and Michael Joel Weaver (Michael) following a motor vehicle accident.Â \r\n  Corbett asserted Jordan was negligent and sought to assert liability against\r\n  Michael under the family purpose doctrine.Â  The trial court denied Corbettâ€™s\r\n  motion for a directed verdict as to the applicability of the family purpose\r\n  doctrine and his motion for a new trial.Â  Corbett appeals the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  rulings.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 27, 2004, sixteen-year-old Jordan was driving a 1994 Jeep\r\n  Wrangler to NAPA Auto Parts to purchase an auto part for his father, Michael. Â As\r\n  Jordan was returning to the family home in Timmonsville, South Carolina, he\r\n  approached a T-intersection with a stop sign.Â  Jordan testified he stopped at\r\n  the stop sign and looked twice in both directions before turning left onto the\r\n  main road.Â  At the same time, Corbett was traveling in a northeasterly\r\n  direction on the main road.Â  As Jordan attempted to turn left onto the main\r\n  road, the front passenger side of his Jeep collided with Corbettâ€™s vehicle.Â  Corbettâ€™s vehicle rolled several times rendering him a paraplegic.Â  Â Â \r\nThereafter, Corbett commenced an action against Jordan and Michael (collectively â€œthe Weaversâ€) based on the family purpose doctrine.Â  While\r\n  Jordan admitted liability based on his negligence, Michael contested\r\n  liability arguing the family purpose doctrine did not apply. Â Â \r\nAt trial, it was stipulated that the case would be tried on two\r\n  issues: (1) the amount of damages Corbett was entitled to and (2) whether\r\n  Michael was liable pursuant to the family purpose doctrine.Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nDuring trial, Jordan testified[1] he normally drove the Jeep and used the Jeep to transport his brother to their\r\n  school.Â  In addition, Jordan stated his father gave the Jeep to him as a gift\r\n  several months before he received his driverâ€™s license. \r\nMichael also testified regarding the ownership and use of the Jeep,\r\n  which was titled in his name.Â  He stated Jordan lived at home on the date of\r\n  the accident and was going to NAPA Auto Parts to purchase a part for Michael\r\n  before the accident occurred.Â  Michael also stated he owned three personal\r\n  vehicles, including the Jeep, and these vehicles were for his use, his wifeâ€™s\r\n  use, and his childrenâ€™s use.Â  However, Michael also testified the Jeep was a\r\n  present to Jordan, as Jordan drove the Jeep more than any of the other family\r\n  vehicles.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter the Weavers rested, Corbett moved for a directed verdict based\r\n  on the family purpose doctrine.Â  Corbett argued Michael purchased the Jeep, the\r\n  Jeep was titled in Michaelâ€™s name, Jordan was running an errand for Michael at\r\n  the time of the accident, and the overall use of the vehicle was for family\r\n  purposes, so Michael, as Jordanâ€™s father, should be vicariously liable for Jordanâ€™s actions.Â  The trial court denied Corbettâ€™s motion finding conflicting\r\n  testimony was introduced regarding the ownership of the Jeep such that a jury\r\n  question existed as to whether the family purpose doctrine applied. Â The trial\r\n  court charged the jury and specifically discussed the family purpose doctrine.Â \r\n  Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict awarding $2,000,000 in actual damages\r\n  against Jordan but found in favor of Michael and thus awarded no damages\r\n  against him.Â  Corbett made a post-trial motion for a new trial, which the trial\r\n  court denied.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. DIRECTED VERDICT MOTION\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is\r\n  concerned only with the existence or non-existence of evidence.â€Â  Sims v.\r\n    Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The trial\r\n  court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.Â  Id. at 714, 541 S.E.2d at 860.Â  If the evidence as a whole is\r\n  susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted\r\n  to the jury.Â  Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this Court must apply\r\n  the same standard and view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the\r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.Â  â€œWhen considering\r\n  directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has\r\n  authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony\r\n  or evidence.â€Â  Estate of Carr ex rel. Bolton v. Circle S Enters., Inc.,\r\n  379 S.C. 31, 39, 664 S.E.2d 83, 86 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  The trial court can only\r\n  be reversed by this Court when no evidence supports the ruling below or when\r\n  the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr.,\r\n  368 S.C. 424, 434-35, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Corbett moved for a directed verdict regarding Michaelâ€™s liability\r\n  pursuant to the family purpose doctrine.Â  For the family purpose doctrine to\r\n  apply, the following elements must be proven: (1) the defendant is the head of\r\n  the family; (2) the defendant owns, furnishes, and maintains a vehicle; (3) the\r\n  vehicle is for the general use and convenience of the family; (4) the family\r\n  member has general authority to operate the vehicle for those purposes; and (5)\r\n  the family member was negligent in the use of the vehicle.Â  Evans v. Stewart,\r\n  370 S.C. 522, 527, 636 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The applicability of\r\n  the family purpose doctrine is generally a question of fact for the jury to\r\n  decide, unless no factual issue exists, therefore, making its applicability an\r\n  issue of law for the trial judge to determine.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of his directed verdict motion, Corbett argued the testimony at trial\r\n  supported Michaelâ€™s liability under the family purpose doctrine.Â  Corbett\r\n  argued that Michael was the owner of the vehicle because he purchased and had\r\n  title to the Jeep.Â  He also argued in the alternative that although Michael had\r\n  given Jordan the Jeep, it was still used for family purposes.Â  Corbett also\r\n  made the argument that â€œ[a] young person canâ€™t own a vehicle.â€Â  In response to\r\n  Corbettâ€™s arguments, the Weavers argued there was evidence that Jordan owned the Jeep.Â  Michael and Jordan both testified the Jeep was a gift from Michael\r\n  to Jordan.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nViewing\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Michael, a jury issue existed\r\n  regarding the ownership of the Jeep.Â  The trial court was presented with\r\n  conflicting evidence concerning ownership of the Jeep, allowing for two\r\n  reasonable inferences about which party was the owner of the Jeep.Â  The Jeep\r\n  being titled in Michaelâ€™s name was not conclusive evidence Michael was the\r\n  owner of the Jeep, because title alone is not dispositive of ownership.Â  See id., at 528, 636 S.E.2d at 636 (explaining a vehicle titled in oneâ€™s\r\n  name is not always indicative of ownership of that vehicle).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  because there was evidence the Jeep was not provided by Michael for the general\r\n  use and convenience of the family but rather was a gift to Jordan, a question of fact existed as to whether Michael should be held liable under the\r\n  family purpose doctrine.Â  See Thompson v. Michael, 315 S.C. 268,\r\n  273, 433 S.E.2d 853, 856 (1993) (â€œSince there is evidence the car was not\r\n  provided by [the father who is the title-owner] for the general use and\r\n  convenience of the family but rather was a gift to [the driverâ€™s sister], a\r\n  question of fact exists whether [the father] is liable under the family purpose\r\n  doctrine.â€). \r\nOne\r\n  of the elements that must be proven for the family purpose doctrine to apply is\r\n  that the head of the household owns the vehicle.Â  Evans, 370 S.C. at 527, 636 S.E.2d at 635.Â  With the conflicting evidence, ownership was a proper\r\n  issue for the jury to determine, making the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny the\r\n  directed verdict motion proper.Â  Pond Place Partners, Inc.,Â  351 S.C. at 15, 567 S.E.2d at 888 (â€œIf the evidence as\r\n  a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the case should\r\n  be submitted to the jury.â€).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nII. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL \r\nA\r\n  trial courtâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will not be\r\n  disturbed unless its decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusion\r\n  was controlled by an error of law. Â Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251,\r\n  254-55, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990). Â When an order pertaining to a new trial is\r\n  before this Court, our review is limited to the consideration of whether\r\n  evidence exists to support the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  Id. at 255, 387\r\n  S.E.2d at 267.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  explained above, the record contains conflicting evidence as to who owned the\r\n  Jeep, which was the basis for the trial court sending that issue to the jury. Â There\r\n  was evidence Michael owned the Jeep, but there was also evidence Jordan owned the Jeep because it was a gift.Â  The jury was required to make the decision as\r\n  to who was the owner and decided Jordan was the owner of the Jeep.Â  Sufficient\r\n  evidence in the record supports this finding, which makes the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  denial of Corbettâ€™s motion for a new trial proper.Â  See Proctor v.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 293, 628 S.E.2d 496,\r\n  504 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating if there is any evidence that could support the\r\n  juryâ€™s findings, a motion for a new trial is properly denied).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny the motion for a directed verdict\r\n  and the motion for a new trial isÂ  Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and KONDUROS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Because both parties stipulated the issue of\r\n  liability and were only litigating the issues of damages and the applicability\r\n  of the family purpose doctrine, the testimony references for Jordan and Michael\r\n  are excerpts from Jordan and Michaelâ€™s depositions, which were submitted into\r\nevidence during trial.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4441","title":"Ardis v.

Â On Friday evening, they\r\n  checked into the Holiday Inn where the sales meeting was to take place the\r\n  following day from 10:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m.Â  \r\nKevin Ristau (Ristau), a regional manager for\r\n  Combined, testified his assistant booked Ardisâ€™ room at the Holiday Inn. Â Ristau also stated employees had the option\r\n  of staying one or two nights at the hotel.Â  Combined was responsible for paying\r\n  for Ardisâ€™ room on both Friday and Saturday nights.[1]Â \r\n  Ristau stated he was aware that Ardis and one other employee of Combined were\r\n  spending Saturday night at the hotel.Â  While Ristau did not stay at the Holiday\r\n  Inn, he testified that he stayed at another hotel in Atlanta on Saturday night\r\n  in preparation for a trip on Sunday to Nashville, Tennessee.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of the sales meeting was to train employees for a new company incentive\r\n  program.Â  Several employees, including Ardis, also received sales awards.Â \r\n  Combined did not dispute that Ardisâ€™\r\n  presence in Marietta was directly related\r\n  to and caused by Ardisâ€™ employment with\r\n  Combined. Â Â \r\nBecause\r\n  the drive back to Wedgefield was approximately five hours, Ardis and Connor\r\n  chose to spend Saturday night at the hotel and drive back the next morning.Â \r\n  After the meeting concluded on Saturday, Connor testified she and Ardis\r\n  shopped, bowled, and ate supper before returning to the hotel between 11:30\r\n  p.m. and 12:00 a.m.Â  They watched a movie in their room and fell asleep around\r\n  1:00 a.m.Â  The couple was awakened by a fire alarm early Sunday morning and\r\n  attempted to leave the hotel.Â  However, due to the thick smoke, Ardis was\r\n  unable to escape and died as a result of smoke inhalation.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  personal representative of Ardisâ€™ estate,\r\n  Ardisâ€™ mother initiated a workersâ€™ compensation claim, requesting a lump sum\r\n  settlement and burial expenses in accordance with South Carolina Code Sections\r\n  42-9-140 and 42-9-290 (1976).Â  After a hearing, the Single Commissioner found\r\n  that Ardisâ€™ decision to remain in Marietta was reasonable as Ardis â€œwould have\r\n  been required to travel approximately five hours after a complete day of\r\n  training.â€Â  As a result, the Single Commissioner concluded Ardis sustained a\r\n  compensable fatal injury by accident and relied on the dual purpose doctrine to\r\n  buttress his conclusion.Â  Consequently, he awarded Ardisâ€™ beneficiaries $2,500\r\n  in burial expenses and a lump sum payment for the commuted value of 500 weeks\r\n  of compensation at the rate of $396.58 per week.Â  The Commission\r\n  unanimously affirmed the Single Commissioner.Â  On appeal, the circuit court\r\n  affirmed the Commission.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review\r\n  for decisions by the Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130,\r\n  135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Although we may not substitute our judgment\r\n  for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of\r\n  fact, we may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Grant\r\n    v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 200-01, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007).Â  Our\r\n  review is limited to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Id. at 201, 641 S.E.2d at 871.Â  When the facts are not in dispute, as in the\r\n  instant case, the question of whether or not the accident is compensable\r\n  becomes purely a question of law.Â  Douglas v. Spartan Mills, Startex\r\n    Div., 245 S.C. 265, 266, 140 S.E.2d 173, 173 (1965).\r\nLAW/ANAYSIS\r\nI. Injury by Accident\r\n  Arising Out of and in the Course of Employment\r\nCombined contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming the decision of the Commission because\r\n  Ardisâ€™ death did not occur within the\r\n  scope and course of his employment.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  be compensable, an injury by accident must be one â€œarising out of and in the\r\n  course of employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2007).Â  The two parts\r\n  of the phrase â€œarising out of and in the course of employmentâ€ are not\r\n  synonymous.Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 49,\r\n  508 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1998).Â  Also, both parts must exist simultaneously before a\r\n  court will allow recovery.Â  Id.Â  â€œArising out ofâ€ refers to the injuryâ€™s origin and\r\n  cause, whereas â€œin the course ofâ€ refers to the injuryâ€™s time, place,\r\n  and circumstances.Â  Id. at 50, 508 S.E.2d at 24. Â Â \r\nFor\r\n  an injury to â€œarise out ofâ€ employment, the injury must be proximately caused\r\n  by the employment.Â  Douglas, 245 S.C. at 269, 140 S.E.2d at 175.Â  An\r\n  injury arises out of employment when there is a causal connection between the\r\n  conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting\r\n  injury.Â  Id.Â  Further, the injury does not have to be foreseen or\r\n  expected, but after the event, it must appear to have originated in a risk\r\n  connected with the employment and to have come from that source as a rational\r\n  consequence.Â  Id.Â  An injury occurs â€œin the course ofâ€ employment when\r\n  it happens within the period of employment at a place where the employee\r\n  reasonably may be in the performance of the employeeâ€™s duties and\r\n  while fulfilling those duties or engaging in something incidental to those\r\n  duties.Â  Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 498, 520 S.E.2d\r\n  634, 639 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nArdisâ€™ death arose out of his employment because he was\r\n  expected to be in Marietta the weekend of January 13-15, 2006 for a\r\n  company-sponsored sales meeting.Â  The causal connection between Ardisâ€™ death\r\n  and his employment is clear.Â  Combined concedes Ardis would not have been in Marietta that weekend but for the conference.Â  Ardisâ€™ presence in Marietta and ultimately\r\n  his death at the hotel were direct consequences of attending the meeting that\r\n  weekend.Â  \r\nCiting\r\n  to Brownlee v. Wetterau Food Serv., 288 S.C. 82, 339 S.E.2d 694 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1986), Combined argues Ardisâ€™ death occurred outside the course of\r\n  employment because Ardis died after the meeting ended, away from Combinedâ€™s\r\n  premises, and at a time when Combined exercised no control over his activities.Â \r\n  In Brownlee, Wetterau sent its employee, Kenneth Brownlee, to a training\r\n  seminar in St. Louis, Missouri.Â  Id. at 84, 339 S.E.2d at 695.Â  The\r\n  seminar took place from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. each day at the hotel where\r\n  Brownlee was staying.Â  Id.Â  Around 9:00 p.m. on the Thursday evening of\r\n  the seminar, Brownlee and three other people attending the seminar decided to\r\n  attend a movie.Â  Id.Â  Brownlee rode as a passenger in a company-owned\r\n  vehicle to the movies.Â  Id.Â  At approximately 2:00 a.m. on the return\r\n  trip to the hotel, all four people were killed in a three-car collision.Â  Id.Â  This Court found that Brownleeâ€™s death was not compensable because his\r\n  activities were not job related or employer sponsored.Â  Id. at 85, 339\r\n  S.E.2d at 695.Â  Further, his death occurred some distance from the hotel and\r\n  several hours after the last scheduled seminar event had concluded.Â  Id. at 84, 339 S.E.2d at 695.Â  \r\nBrownlee bears factual similarities to the instant case,\r\n  namely that Ardis died while attending an out-of-town seminar.Â  However, Ardisâ€™\r\n  death occurred in a distinctly different place and manner than that of the\r\n  employee in Brownlee.Â  At the time of Ardisâ€™ death, he was in the hotel\r\n  where the seminar took place, sleeping in a room paid for and reserved by\r\n  Combined.Â  See 2 Arthur Larson\r\n  &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 25.02, 25-2 (2008) (stating â€œ[a] traveling employee\r\n  who dies as a result of a fire or asphyxiation in a hotel or motel during the\r\n  business trip is within the coverage of the compensation acts . . . [as] there\r\n  is no difference in principle between the employee who is housed upon the\r\n  employerâ€™s own premises and the employee who is housed in a hotel room paid for\r\n  by the employerâ€).Â  Moreover, Brownleeâ€™s\r\n  decision to venture away from the hotel inevitably precipitated his death,\r\n  whereas Ardisâ€™ death was the result of circumstances wholly outside his\r\n  immediate control.[2]Â  While his death in the\r\n  hotel fire may not have been expected or even foreseeable, the possibility that\r\n  he could be injured or perish while on an out-of-town business trip is a risk\r\n  directly connected with the nature of Ardisâ€™ employment.Â  See Stone\r\n    v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 275, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552-53 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (stating the injury need not be expected or even foreseeable but must\r\n  appear to have originated in a risk connected to the employment and to have\r\n  flowed from that source as a rational consequence). Â Â \r\nCombined\r\n  maintains the business purpose of the trip ended at the conclusion of the\r\n  seminar; therefore, Ardisâ€™ presence at the hotel on Saturday night was outside\r\n  the scope of his employment since he was no longer in the performance of his\r\n  duties.Â  The seminar and Ardisâ€™ official business duties may have ended earlier\r\n  that day, but it is reasonably foreseeable and incidental to the fulfillment of\r\n  his duties for Ardis and Connor to have spent the night in Marietta before\r\n  making the five-hour drive back to Wedgefield.Â  See Beam v. State\r\n    Workmensâ€™ Comp. Fund, 261 S.C. 327, 332, 200 S.E.2d 83, 86 (1973) (stating â€œan employee, to\r\n  be entitled to compensation, need not be in the actual performance of the\r\n  duties for which he was expressly employed in order for his injury or death to\r\n  be in the â€˜course of employmentâ€™ [as long as] the employee is engaged in a\r\n  pursuit or undertaking . . . which in some logical manner pertains to . . . his\r\n  employmentâ€); see also Broughton,\r\n  336 S.C. at 498, 520 S.E.2d at 639 (stating an employee is within the course of\r\n  employment for purposes of coverage under the Act if injured while fulfilling\r\n  work-related duties or engaging in something incidental to those duties). \r\nArdis\r\n  had driven five hours the preceding day, had spent almost the entire afternoon\r\n  in a meeting solely related to his employerâ€™s business, and arguably wanted to\r\n  return to Wedgefield on Sunday morning following a good nightâ€™s rest. Â Because\r\n  the sun sets earlier in January, even if they left immediately after the\r\n  conference ended, they would not arrive in Wedgefield until after dark.Â \r\n  Although Ardis was not engaged in the actual performance of his business\r\n  duties, Ardisâ€™ act of sleeping in the hotel room before returning home the next\r\n  morning is a logical action given the circumstances and is therefore incidental\r\n  to the business trip.Â  see also Martin v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 167 S.E.2d\r\n  790, 793 (N.C. Ct. App. 1969) (internal citation omitted) (stating â€œtraveling\r\n  employees, whether or not on call, usually do receive protection when the\r\n  injury has its origin in a risk created by the necessity of sleeping and eating\r\n  away from home. . . . [t]he hotel fire cases are the best illustration of\r\n  thisâ€); cf. Larson &amp; Larson, supra, Â§ 25.03[1] (stating that\r\n  similar to injuries sustained by a traveling employee while sleeping away from\r\n  home, injuries sustained by a traveling employee while dining have â€œbeen held\r\n  compensable, even though the accident occurred on a Sunday evening, a day off,\r\n  or involved an extended trip occasioned by the employeeâ€™s wish to eat at\r\n  a particular restaurant or barâ€) (emphasis added). \r\nII. Substantial Deviation \r\nCombined\r\n  additionally argues Ardis participated in a series of personal activities that\r\n  constituted a substantial deviation from the course of his employment.Â \r\n  Combined argues Ardisâ€™ acts of going to dinner, shopping, and bowling were substantial\r\n  deviations that rendered Ardis outside the scope of his employment at the time\r\n  of his death.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  identifiable deviation from a business trip for personal reasons takes the\r\n  employee out of the course of employment until the employee returns to the\r\n  route of the business trip, unless the deviation is so small as to be\r\n    disregarded as insubstantial.â€Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist., 338\r\n  S.C. 510, 522, 526 S.E.2d 725, 731 (Ct. App. 2000) (internal citation omitted)\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nEven\r\n  assuming the above-mentioned activities were identifiable deviations, Ardisâ€™ death occurred while he was sleeping at the hotel\r\n  such that any deviation was cured or abandoned by the time of the accident.Â \r\n  Further, the act of sleeping, although a\r\n  personal activity, was incidental to his employment such that his death arose\r\n  out of his employment.Â  Sleeping is expressly included within the scope of the personal comfort doctrine.Â  The personal comfort\r\n  doctrine states, â€œSuch acts as are necessary to the life, comfort, and\r\n  convenience of the [employee] while at work, though strictly personal . . . and\r\n  not acts of service, are incidental to the service, and injury sustained in the\r\n  performance thereof is deemed to have arisen out of the employment.â€Â  Id. at 519, 526 S.E.2d at 730 (citing Osteen,\r\n  333 S.C. at 46, 508 S.E.2d at 23).Â  This includes â€œimperative acts\r\n  such as eating, drinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort, preparing to\r\n  begin or quit work, and resting or sleeping.â€Â  Id. at 519-20, 526\r\n  S.E.2d at 730 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  circumstances, Ardisâ€™ decision to sleep at the hotel in Marietta on Saturday\r\n  night was an act that was necessary to Ardisâ€™ â€œlife, comfort, and\r\n  convenience.â€Â  See Larson &amp; Larson, supra, Â§ 25.01 (2008)\r\n  (stating â€œ[e]mployees whose work entails travel away from the employerâ€™s\r\n  premises are held in the majority of jurisdictions to be within the course of\r\n  their employment continuously during the trip . . . [t]hus, injuries arising\r\n  out of the necessity of sleeping in hotels or eating in restaurants away from\r\n  home are usually held compensableâ€).Â  Combined implicitly recognized the\r\n  reasonableness of Ardisâ€™ decision to stay in Marietta by reserving and paying\r\n  for Ardisâ€™ room.Â  Furthermore, we believe a fundamental premise underlying the\r\n  personal comfort doctrine is that while certain activities undertaken by an\r\n  employee may immediately benefit the employee in a personal sense, a benefit\r\n  ultimately inures to the employer as well.Â  See Osteen, 333 S.C.\r\n  at 46-47, 508 S.E.2d at 23 (stating that while an employee who engages in\r\n  entirely personal activities may be â€œminister[ing] unto himself . . . in a\r\n  remote sense these acts contribute to the furtherance of his workâ€).Â  Consequently, Ardisâ€™ death occurred during an activity\r\n  that was incidental to his employment and thus was compensable under the Act.Â  \r\nIII. Dual Purpose Doctrine\r\nLast, Combined argues the dual purpose doctrine, as\r\n  relied upon by the Commission, does not bring Ardisâ€™ death within the course of his employment because he\r\n  substantially deviated from the business purpose of the trip at the time of his\r\n  death.Â  \r\nThe dual purpose\r\n  doctrine states the following:\r\n\r\n  [W]hen a trip serves both business and personal purposes, it is a\r\n    personal trip if the trip would have been made in spite of the failure or\r\n    absence of the business purpose and would have been dropped in the event of\r\n    failure of the private purpose, though the business errand remained undone; it\r\n    is a business trip if a trip of this kind would have been made in spite of the\r\n    failure or absence of the private purpose, because the service to be performed\r\n    for the employer would have caused the journey to be made by someone even if it\r\n    had not coincided with the employeeâ€™s personal journey. \r\n\r\nGibson, 338 S.C. at 520, 526 S.E.2d at 730.\r\nCombined\r\n  concedes Ardisâ€™ trip to Marietta was for\r\n  a business purpose.Â  While Ardis may have engaged in some personal activities\r\n  during the business trip, he traveled to Marietta solely for the benefit of his\r\n  employer.Â  In the absence of the business purpose, Ardis would not have made\r\n  the trip at all.Â  See Gibson, 338 S.C. at 521, 526 S.E.2d at 731\r\n  (finding teacherâ€™s injury at Wal-Mart while buying school supplies as well as a\r\n  lunch box for her child was compensable when trip served both a business and\r\n  personal purpose but trip was made solely for benefit of school district and in\r\n  absence of business purpose, the trip would not have occurred at all).Â  Having\r\n  already found Ardis did not substantially deviate from this business purpose at\r\n  the time of his death, we conclude the circuit court properly affirmed the\r\n  Commission in finding Ardisâ€™ death occurred in the course and scope of his\r\n  employment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\nHUFF, J., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Combined attempted to argue to the circuit court and\r\n  to this Court that it was unclear as to whether Combined ever paid for Ardisâ€™\r\n  room at the hotel due to Combinedâ€™s direct billing system.Â  In its brief,\r\n  Combined stated under this billing system, it would pay the cost of the room up\r\n  front and then charge the expense to the employeeâ€™s account.Â  However, because\r\n  Combined offered sales incentives to its employees to offset the chargeback, an\r\n  employeeâ€™s room could be paid for if the employee reached certain sales\r\n  achievements.Â  Because the Commission found substantial evidence existed in the\r\n  record to establish Combined paid for Ardisâ€™ room and because Combined concedes\r\n  on appeal the facts are undisputed such that our review is limited only to\r\n  legal errors, the Commissionâ€™s factual determination on this issue is\r\nconclusive.\r\n[2] In acknowledging that Brownlee was engaged in an\r\n  activity planned by himself and other seminar participants at the time of his\r\n  death, this Court noted that the record was devoid of evidence that Brownlee\r\n  died while returning to the hotel from a restaurant, as eating and going to eat\r\n  are viewed as being within the scope of employment on out-of-town business\r\ntrips.Â  Brownlee, 288 S.C. at 84-85, 339 S.E.2d at 695-96.Â  Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4442","title":"Buice v.

Dantin, all of Spartanburg,\r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J.: Â Steeley Humphrey, and WMA\r\n  Securities, Inc. (collectively Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s denial of\r\n  their Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, to Stay and Compel Arbitration\r\n  in an action filed by Respondents Jerry and Anna Buice, Brenda Sprinkle, and\r\n  Haley Nicole Smith Williams (collectively Investors).[1] Â We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\n In early 1999,\r\n  Investor Sprinkle met Howell, an agent/employee of WMAS, in the course of\r\n  procuring supplemental health insurance for her elderly parents.Â  During\r\n  several resulting conversations between the two, Howell inquired about\r\n  assisting Sprinkle with other aspects of her financial planning.Â  Also during\r\n  this same period, Sprinkle introduced Howell to several of her co-workers,\r\n  including the Buices and Williams.Â  Investors allege Howell recommended\r\n  purchasing variable universal life insurances policies (Policies) as safe and\r\n  prudent investments through which each could earn enough profit to cover all\r\n  future insurance premiums.Â  As a result of these conversations, and in reliance\r\n  on Howellâ€™s advice, Investors separately purchased Policies between January of\r\n  1999, and June of 2000.[2]Â \r\n  The Investorsâ€™ applications were identical,[3] and each included an Arbitration Agreement.Â  \r\nThe Arbitration\r\n  Agreement appears under the heading â€œCLIENT PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATIONâ€ and in\r\n  relevant part provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I (we)\r\n      agree that unless unenforceable due to federal or state law, any controversy\r\n      arising out of or related to my (our) accounts, the transactions with WMAS, its\r\n      officers, directors, agents, registered representatives and/or employees for me\r\n      (us), or related to this agreement or breach thereof, shall be settled by\r\n      arbitration in accordance with the rules then in effect of the National\r\n      Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).Â  Such arbitration shall follow\r\n      the procedures as set forth by a national arbitration committee of the NASD.Â  .\r\n      . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  Arbitration Agreement concludes, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I (we)\r\n      understand that:\r\n      (1)\r\n      ARBITRATION IS FINAL AND BINDING ON THE PARTIES (I.E., YOU AND WMAS).\r\n      (2) YOU\r\n      AND WMAS ARE WAIVING RIGHTS TO SEEK REMEDIES IN COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO\r\n      JURY TRIAL.\r\n      . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nFollowing each of\r\n  their investments, Investors contend they discovered Appellants had materially\r\n  misrepresented and omitted vital information regarding the Policies, upon which\r\n  they had relied in their purchase.Â  Investors allege Appellants failed to\r\n  disclose that the Policies were actually â€œmutual fund type account[s] â€˜wrappedâ€™\r\n  inside [] insurance polic[ies]â€ requiring the separate purchase of life\r\n  insurance regardless of an individualâ€™s need for ancillary life insurance.Â \r\n  Investors further maintain Howell failed to disclose the higher sales\r\n  commission he stood to earn from the Policies as compared to other investment\r\n  alternatives, or that the Policies are generally considered high-risk\r\n  securities.Â  \r\nOriginally, Investors filed the necessary paperwork with the NASD to bring their action in\r\n  arbitration.Â  (emphasis added).Â  However, shortly after filing, Investors\r\n  received a return letter from the NASD stating WMASâ€™s NASD membership had been\r\n  terminated, and Investors â€œ[could], but [are] not required to, arbitrate\r\n  [their] claimâ€ based on NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure Rule 10301.Â  Rule\r\n  10301[4] provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    10301. Required Submission\r\n      (a) Any\r\n      dispute, claim or controversy eligible for submission under the Rule 10100 Series between a customer and a member and/or associated person arising in\r\n      connection with the business of such member or in connection with the\r\n      activities of such associated persons shall be arbitrated under this Code, as\r\n      provided by any duly executed and enforceable written agreement or upon the\r\n      demand of the customer.Â  A claim involving a member in the following categories shall be ineligible for submission to arbitration under the Code unless\r\n        the customer agrees in writing to arbitrate the claim after it has arisen:\r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n        A member whose membership is terminated,suspended, canceled,\r\n        or revoked;\r\n        2.\r\n        A member that has been expelled from theNASD; or\r\n        3.\r\n        A member that is otherwise defunct.\r\n      \r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nInvestors then filed\r\n  suit in circuit court against Carl Kennedy,[5] Howell, Humphrey, and WMAS, asserting eight causes of action: (1) violation of\r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s securities laws; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) negligence;\r\n  (4) breach of contract; (5) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing;\r\n  (6) fraud; (7) breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act; and (8)\r\n  control person liability. Â Kennedy, WMAS and Humphrey filed a Motion to Dismiss\r\n  or in the Alternative, to Stay and Compel Arbitration. Â A hearing was held, and\r\n  relying on Rule 10301 and a perceived ambiguity, the circuit court denied all\r\n  the motions by written order. Â Ensuing Motions to Reconsider were also denied. Â This\r\n  appeal followed. Â Before oral arguments to this court, Investors and Kennedy\r\n  agreed by stipulation that Investorsâ€™ claims against him are subject to\r\n  arbitration before the NASD, and, therefore, Kennedyâ€™s appeal was dismissed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe determination\r\n  of whether a claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.â€Â  Wellman,\r\n    Inc. v. Square D Co., 366 S.C. 61, 67, 620 S.E.2d 86, 89 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  However, a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if\r\n  any evidence reasonably supports the findings.Â  Thornton v. Trident\r\n    Med. Ctr., L.L.C., 357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. WMAS\r\nWMAS first contends\r\n  the agreement entered into by the parties stipulates that NASD rules â€œthen in\r\n  effectâ€ would govern any dispute arising from the agreement, and that because\r\n  Rule 10301 did not exist at the time the parties signed their agreement, it\r\n  should have no applicability.Â  WMAS also contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  refusing, assuming Rule 10301â€™s applicability, to compel arbitration, where the\r\n  rule does not preclude arbitration, and the parties entered into an otherwise\r\n  contractually binding arbitration agreement with respect to claims arising out\r\n  of the contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe crux of the\r\n  analysis of the arbitration agreement hinges on a determination of how the\r\n  phrase â€œthen in effectâ€ modifies the set of NASD rules to be applied in the\r\n  arbitration.Â  We find the phrase â€œthen in effectâ€ clearly and unambiguously\r\n  refers to the NASD rules existing at the time the matter is sent to\r\n  arbitration.Â  Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493\r\n  S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œThe construction of a clear and unambiguous contract is a question\r\n  of law for the court.â€).Â  Our analysis is bolstered by\r\n  four previous decisions of courts around the country that have had the occasion\r\n  to interpret NASD Rule 10301â€™s effect on a terminated memberâ€™s right to still\r\n  compel arbitration after the ruleâ€™s enaction.Â  See In re Sands Bros.\r\n    &amp; Co., Ltd., 206 S.W.3d 127 (Tex. App. 2006); Gailey v. World\r\n      Marketing Alliance, 2006 WL 1716871 (N.D.Miss. 2006); Provencio v. WMA Sec., Inc., 125 Cal. App. 4th 1028 (Cal. App. 2d 2005); Elston v.\r\n        Toma, 2004 WL 1048132 (D.Or. 2004).Â  Moreover, similar to the Elston courtâ€™s deconstruction of a comparable contractual clause, we find WMASâ€™\r\n  inclusion of the NASD as the specified arbitration forum and applicable rules,\r\n  limits its ability to make a colorable argument that arbitration should be enforced\r\n  despite the clear exclusion under NASD Rule 10301 for those whose memberships\r\n  have been terminated.Â  This is also represented in the legislative history of\r\n  Rule 10301, where the NASD explained:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    NASD Dispute Resolution believes that the proposed rule change is\r\n      consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the [Securities and\r\n      Exchange Act of 1934] which requires, among other things, that the Associationâ€™s\r\n      rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and\r\n      practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general,\r\n      to protect investors and the public interest. Because terminated, suspended,\r\n      barred or otherwise defunct firms have a significantly higher incidence of\r\n      non-payment of arbitration awards than do active firms, NASD Dispute Resolution\r\n      believes that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the general\r\n      public by giving customers greater flexibility to seek remedies against such\r\n      firms.\r\n  \r\n\r\n66 Fed.Reg.\r\n  13362, 13364 (proposed Mar. 5, 2001).Â  As a result, we affirm the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s finding that Investorsâ€™ claims against WMAS should be sent to\r\n  arbitration only at their discretion, by subsequent written request as outlined\r\n  by Rule 10301.\r\nII. HumphreyÂ  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, all parties to this appeal agree that WMAS and Humphreyâ€™s interests\r\n  are identical.Â  Nevertheless, the circuit courtâ€™s order on appeal specifically\r\n  delineates the two parties separately, and applies differing logic and legal\r\n  analysis to uphold its finding that neither party should be able to compel arbitration.Â \r\n  The basis upon which the circuit court denied Humphreyâ€™s Motion to Compel\r\n  Arbitration was that the contract was ambiguous.Â  We find this was error.\r\nâ€œIt is\r\n  a question of law for the court whether the language of a\r\n  contract is ambiguous.â€ Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001). Â Because an arbitration clause is a contractual term,\r\n  general rules of contract interpretation apply where the court must determine\r\n  the clauseâ€™s applicability. Â Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C.\r\n  29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In\r\n  determining as a matter of law whether a\r\n  contract is ambiguous, the court must consider the contract as a whole, rather than deciding whether phrases in isolation could be\r\n  interpreted in various ways: Â â€œ[O]ne may not, by pointing out a single sentence\r\n  or clause, create an ambiguity.â€ Â Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 348 (1976). Â â€œWhether a contract is ambiguous is to be\r\n  determined from the entire contract and not from isolated\r\n  portions of the contract.â€Â  Farr v. Duke Power Co.,\r\n  265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431, 433 (1975).Â  Further, in determining\r\n  the intent of the contracting parties, the court should construe the contract\r\n  as a whole, and read together different provisions dealing with the same\r\n  subject matter. Skull Creek Club Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Cook &amp; Book, Inc.,\r\n  313 S.C. 283, 286, 437 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nIn finding the\r\n  arbitration agreement ambiguous, the circuit court held:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    The\r\n      first paragraph of the agreement references â€œWMAS, its officers, directors,\r\n      agents, registered representatives and/or employee.â€ . . . The [] paragraph\r\n      [immediately following] states, in pertinent part:Â  I (we) understand that:Â \r\n      (1) ARBITRATION IS FINAL AND BINDING ON THE PARTIES (i.e., YOU AND WMAS). . . .\r\n      This Court finds that this second paragraph is set forth with greater emphasis\r\n      than the first and is inconsistent with the preceding paragraph as to who is to\r\n      be controlled by the arbitration agreement.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe find there is no\r\n  inconsistency or ambiguity between the clauses.Â  Even acknowledging a\r\n  difference, the most logical explanation is that the language of the first\r\n  paragraph actually creates the agreement to arbitrate, and the second paragraph\r\n  merely summarizes that agreement.\r\nMoreover, assuming\r\n  without deciding that the two clauses are incompatible, the first clause should\r\n  be given greater weight.Â  Our Supreme Court has held that where â€œthere are two\r\n  incompatible . . . clauses [in a contract] the first will prevail over the\r\n  latter.â€ Phipps v. Hardwick, 273 S.C. 17, 24, 253 S.E.2d 506, 510\r\n  (1979).Â  Further, where two clauses are incompatible, â€œthe [clause] which\r\n  essentially requires something to be done to effect the general purpose of the\r\n  contract is entitled to greater consideration than the other.â€ 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 384 (2008).Â  Here, the first paragraph of the Arbitration Agreement defines\r\n  how an account holder would handle a dispute, which is an operative, rather\r\n  than descriptive, clause.Â  The second paragraph merely describes or summarizes\r\n  the first.Â  Under this view, the first paragraph, with its reference to WMASâ€™s\r\n  officers, directors, agents, registered representatives, and employees, would\r\n  control.\r\nEven\r\n  though we disagree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the provision is\r\n  ambiguous, we nevertheless affirm its decision to deny Humphreyâ€™s Motion to\r\n  Compel Arbitration.Â  At this stage of litigation, we are willing to accept the\r\n  partiesâ€™ determination of their own rights, and both Humphrey and WMAS have\r\n  taken the position before the circuit court and this court that their interests\r\n  are indistinguishable. Â Accordingly, our finding above on Rule 10301 mandates\r\n  affirmance of the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Humphreyâ€™s Motion to Compel.Â  The\r\n  order of the circuit court is Â \r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and CURETON,\r\n  A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Williams is not represented by counsel; however, she\r\nhas agreed to be bound by the courtâ€™s disposition of the case.Â  \r\n[2] Investorsâ€™ complaints indicate the Buices invested\r\n$106,764.24, Sprinkle invested $95,828.00, and Williams invested $15,000.\r\n[3] There are discrepancies between when Investors claim\r\n  to have invested, and when documents submitted to the court indicate investments\r\n  were made.Â  The New Account Applications included in the record indicate Williams\r\n  signed on April 14, 1999; the Buices signed agreements on December 6 and 16,\r\n1999; and Sprinkle signed an agreement on January 6, 2000.Â  \r\n[4] NASD Rule 10301 was adopted on June, 11 2001.Â  \r\n[5] Kennedy was also an agent/employee of WMAS and was\r\nHowellâ€™s immediate supervisor.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4443","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

(Mother) and Scott K. (Father) to comply with a Treatment\r\n  Plan.Â  We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 20, 2006, the Aiken County Department of Social Services\r\n  (DSS) received a call about Mother and\r\n  Fatherâ€™s home, reporting, â€œthere are bags of trash with maggots in them\r\n  throughout the house . . . there is dog feces and dog urine on floors . . .\r\n  there was the smell of marijuana in the home and marijuana smoke was seen.â€Â  Ten days later, sheriffâ€™s deputy Ken\r\n  Blackwell accompanied DSS caseworkers Kendra Upton-Williams and Evelyn Perry on\r\n  an unannounced visit to the home.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  Blackwell entered the home, he observed â€œseveral bags of trash in the kitchen\r\n  and dirty dishes in the sink.Â  The living room . . . was really cluttered with\r\n  a lot of books and stuff stacked around.â€Â  Upton-Williams recorded her impression\r\n  of the familyâ€™s home in a report:\r\n\r\n  [The\r\n    home was] cluttered with bags of trash and toys, trash thrown about the home,\r\n    stains on the carpet, the staircase is lined with debris, the front door is\r\n    barricaded with debris and a small shelf, the utility/storage room is filled\r\n    with boxes of unknown items that ha[ve] been there since the couple moved into\r\n    the home Â . . . .Â  The bottom of the floors in [the childrenâ€™s] room[s] cannot\r\n    be seen in full.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Upton-Williams\r\n  testified she discussed the condition of their home with Mother and Father; Mother\r\n  said she â€œbecomes overwhelmed and depressed when it is time to clean her home,â€\r\n  and Father said he tried to develop a reward system to encourage the children\r\n  to clean their rooms.Â  On cross-examination, Upton-Williams admitted she found nothing\r\n  in the familyâ€™s home consistent with the allegations reported to DSS â€” no dog\r\n  feces, no urine, no maggots, and no marijuana. Â \r\nMotherâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding the condition of her home that day provides a different perspective:\r\n\r\n  We were\r\n    trying to get our house situated and the basement stuff done.Â  . . .Â  Our\r\n    living room at the time had a bookcase in it to where we could get the stuff from\r\n    [childâ€™s] room picked up and books put on shelves.Â  . . .Â  [T]he stuff outside[,]\r\n    we were getting ready to take to Goodwill to make room in our house because we\r\n    had no storage.Â  \r\n\r\nFather testified and\r\n  explained the children were spending the week at their grandparentsâ€™ home,\r\n  while he and Mother were â€œcleaning the house and going through . . . boxes,\r\n  rearranging things, painting . . . rooms, [and] doing a whole bunch of things\r\n  with the house.â€Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of their visit, Upton-Williams and Perry determined\r\n  the physical condition of the home placed Mother and Fatherâ€™s children at\r\n  â€œserious risk of harm.â€ Â DSS asked Mother\r\n  and Father to voluntarily\r\n  comply with a â€œSafety Planâ€ it developed.Â  The Plan required the children to\r\n  remain with their grandparents, who would serve â€œas protectorsâ€ of their grandchildren\r\n  and stated DSS would give Mother and Father three days to discard all trash,\r\n  clean the home, make the beds with clean linens, and obtain drug screens.Â  Mother testified she and Father initially had refused\r\n  to sign the Plan, but they capitulated after DSS told them if they refused:\r\n  â€œ[O]ur kids would be taken away, and the officer would escort us out of the\r\n  room, and we would be arrested.â€ Â \r\nUpton-Williams returned to the familyâ€™s home two days later.Â  She\r\n  testified it now was clean and acceptable, and DSS allowed the children to\r\n  return home.Â  The following day, she\r\n  reviewed the results of Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s drug tests, which were negative.Â  Upton-Williams testified she told\r\n  Mother and Father the Plan would remain in effect, and DSS would â€œbe coming\r\n  back to the home to make unannounced visits,â€ until DSS made a â€œcase decision.â€\r\n  Â \r\nUpton-Williams prepared a Determination Fact Sheet to â€œlet the\r\n  family know [the] case [was] indicatedâ€ for physical neglect of the children based\r\n  on the condition of the home.Â  Upton-Williams noted on the Fact Sheet: \r\n\r\n  [Father]\r\n    does not see anything wrong with the condition of his home and feels that his\r\n    case should be unfounded as none of the allegations were true.Â  Although the\r\n    home had been cleaned by 11/01/06, [Father] would no longer allow DSS back into\r\n    his home.Â  [Father] feels that his rights have been violated by DSS and the\r\n    Aiken County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMother\r\n  testified regarding the disruptive impact of the DSS investigation on her\r\n  childrenâ€™s lives.Â  She stated the children had been making Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s before DSS\r\n  started its investigation; however, their grades began to drop because, â€œDSS\r\n  was visiting [the children] at school and it was embarrassing to them.Â  They\r\n  were waking up at various times of the night[,] afraid DSS was going to take\r\n  them away.â€Â  \r\nDSS concluded its investigation on November 20, 2006, and it classified\r\n  the reported allegations as â€œindicated for physical neglect due to the\r\n  condition of the home of the parents.â€Â  Thereafter, DSS developed an â€œIn-Home\r\n  Treatment Plan,â€ and required Mother and Father to comply with it for six months.Â \r\n  The Plan instructed Mother and Father to: (1) keep the home clutter-free and\r\n  pest-free; (2) wipe down the walls; (3) remove clothing from floors; (4) clean\r\n  and maintain all rooms in the house; (5) dispose of plastic bottles, old shoes,\r\n  and other items in the front yard; and (6) put clean linens on the beds.Â  DSS stated\r\n  it would monitor compliance through unannounced visits, photographs, and review\r\n  of the childrenâ€™s school records.Â  Mother and Father refused to sign the Plan\r\n  and notified DSS they wanted to appeal its case determination.Â  In March 2007,\r\n  DSS brought an action alleging Mother and Fatherâ€™s children were physically\r\n  neglected, they had failed to follow the treatment plan, and the â€œchildren cannot\r\n  be protected adequately at this time from further harm without the intervention\r\n  of [DSS] and court-ordered services.â€[1] Â \r\nOn\r\n  May 24, 2007, the family court conducted an intervention hearing. Â Guardian ad\r\n  litem (GAL) Nona Mauzy testified she had visited the familyâ€™s home on April 7\r\n  and May 20, 2007.Â  Mauzy stated the home was indeed cluttered; however, she\r\n  observed no signs the children were neglected:\r\n\r\n  I\r\n    thought that they had a good family working, just the way they got along\r\n    together as a group. . . .Â  I didnâ€™t see any dissension or uneasiness or fear\r\n    of any kind. . . .Â  [T]he house is cluttered, very cluttered, there is no doubt\r\n    about that. . . .Â  I didnâ€™t feel that it was contaminated or unsanitary. . . .Â \r\n    It would be unsafe for me to walk through a lot of clutter on the floor because\r\n    I am elderly and not as steady on my feet. . . .Â  I donâ€™t think there is a\r\n    potential risk of harm right now.Â  I really donâ€™t.Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Mauzy\r\n  interviewed Mother and Father, the children, and their grandparents and teachers\r\n  before writing her report, which stated: \r\n\r\n  [Mother\r\n    and Father] were cordial, polite and showed me through their home.Â  It was\r\n    cluttered but not dirty.Â  The computer in the living room sits on a table and\r\n    papers were piled all around it.Â  There are makeshift shelves in the dining\r\n    room across one wall containing groceries and some cleaning supplies.Â  The\r\n    kitchen is small and this looks like overflow from too few cabinets.Â  I did not\r\n    feel that the home was unsanitary. . . .Â  The girls were clean and looked\r\n    healthy.Â  They seemed very bright and active.\r\n\r\nThe childrenâ€™s grandfather\r\n  told Mauzy, â€œDSS is overstepping [its] authority and that he would gladly\r\n  testify that they are good parents but clutter did not bother either of them.â€Â \r\n  Mauzy testified she returned to the home a month later and found, â€œ[t]he parents\r\n  were busy replacing the makeshift shelves in the dining room with a nice, big\r\n  stainless steel shelving unit.â€Â  She concluded:\r\n\r\n  Based\r\n    on my observations I feel [the children] are normal and well-adjusted for their\r\n    ages.Â  Both are friendly and outgoing and appear to have a normal, loving\r\n    relationship with their Mother and Father.Â  Their teachers state that they are\r\n    doing well and have seen no signs of neglect.Â  I feel that a referral for some\r\n    Homemaker services could help [Mother and Father] become more organized.Â \r\n    [Father] should obtain employment so as to support his family.\r\n\r\nDuring\r\n  the intervention hearing, Motherâ€™s counsel asked Mauzy why her written report\r\n  recommended affirming the DSS finding that the children were at â€œa substantial\r\n  risk of physical neglect.â€ Â Mauzy replied, â€œ[w]ell, that confuses me even.â€Â \r\n  She added the GALâ€™s office â€œhelp[s] me with phrases and terms, since I donâ€™t\r\n  have the jargon. Â I am strictly a volunteer.â€Â  Finally, when asked if the\r\n  children were at substantial risk of physical neglect, Mauzy responded: â€œChange\r\n  that word to â€˜possible.â€™â€Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the hearing, the family court determined: (1) the allegations of DSS against\r\n  Mother and Father were supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the\r\n  children are neglected due to the poor condition of their home; (3) the\r\n  children cannot be protected from further harm without the intervention of DSS;\r\n  and (4) the DSS Treatment Plan will alleviate the â€œdanger to these children and\r\n  aid [Mother and Father].â€Â  Thereafter, the family court ordered Mother and\r\n  Father to comply with the Treatment Plan.Â  Mother and Fatherâ€™s appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  appeals from family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Meek, 352 S.C. 523, 528, 575 S.E.2d 846, 848 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFirst,\r\n  Mother and Father argue DSS improperly classified the allegations concerning\r\n  the condition of their home as, â€œindicated for physical neglect due to the\r\n  condition of the home.â€Â  Furthermore, Mother and Father contend the family\r\n  court erred in finding a preponderance of the evidence supported the DSS\r\n  indication and in finding the children could not be protected from future harm\r\n  without intervention. Â As a consequence of these erroneous findings, Mother and\r\n  Father assert the family court erred in ordering them to comply with the Treatment\r\n  Plan.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nA. Investigating\r\n  Reports of Alleged Abuse and Neglect\r\nâ€œAny\r\n  intervention by the State into family life on behalf of children must be guided\r\n  by law, by strong philosophical underpinnings, and by sound professional\r\n  standards for practice.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-480 (Supp. 2007).[2]Â \r\n  Furthermore, the statutory scheme for child protection is guided by the\r\n  principle that, â€œ[p]arents have the primary responsibility for and are the\r\n  primary resource for their children.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-480(A)(1).\r\nSouth Carolina law states child abuse, neglect, or\r\n  harm occurs when a person responsible for the childâ€™s welfare â€œfails to supply\r\n  the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or education . . . and the\r\n  failure to do so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical\r\n  or mental injury.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(2)(c) (Supp. 2007).Â  The statute provides\r\n  clear guidelines to DSS for investigating reports of suspected child abuse or\r\n  neglect.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-650 (Supp. 2007).Â  Within twenty-four hours of\r\n  receiving a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, DSS must begin a\r\n  thorough investigation. Â Â§ 20-7-650(C).Â  Furthermore, within sixty days, DSS\r\n  must classify the report as either â€œunfoundedâ€ or â€œindicated.â€[3] Â Â§ 20-7-650(F).Â  â€œ[I]t is presumed that all reports are unfounded unless [DSS]\r\n  determines otherwise.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-490(10).Â  â€œJust as\r\n  SCDSS has the responsibility under the statutory scheme to bring meritorious\r\n  allegations of child abuse and neglect before the family court, it also has the\r\n  responsibility and duty to seek dismissal of those petitions subsequently\r\n  determined by their investigation to be without merit.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Pritcher, 329 S.C. 242, 247, 495 S.E.2d 242, 244 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997).Â  The goal of this statutory scheme â€œis to protect children while\r\n  avoiding intervention into the familyâ€™s life if at all possible.â€Â  Id. at 248, 495 S.E.2d at 245.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  DSS classifies a report as indicated, it may petition the family court for\r\n  authority to intervene and provide protective services if it makes the\r\n  two-pronged determination: (1) by a preponderance of evidence, the child is an abused\r\n  or neglected child, and (2) the child cannot be protected from harm without\r\n  intervention.Â  Â§ 20-7-738(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  In this case, DSS found a cluttered\r\n  home, but its investigation failed to substantiate any of the reported allegations.\r\n  Â Moreover, there was no evidence that Mother and Fatherâ€™s children had been\r\n  harmed or were at risk of future harm.Â  To the contrary, all the evidence\r\n  showed the children to be healthy and well nurtured; in the words of the GAL,\r\n  â€œthey had a good family.â€Â  Accordingly, we find DSS erred in classifying the reported\r\n  allegations.Â  Moreover, DSS compounded its error by equating Mother and\r\n  Fatherâ€™s marginal housekeeping skills with the neglect of their children and in\r\n  finding the children cannot be protected from further harm without\r\n  intervention.\r\nB. Family Court Intervention\r\nThe family\r\n  court can order intervention and protective services only after it finds the\r\n  allegations of the DSS petition requesting intervention are supported by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, the child is abused or neglected as defined in\r\n  section 20-7-490, and the child cannot be protected from further harm without\r\n  intervention.Â  Â§ 20-7-738(D). Â Because a preponderance of the evidence did not\r\n  support the allegations in the DSS petition, the family court erred in ordering\r\n  intervention. Â Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s intervention order is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nHUFF, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The\r\n  following month, DSS amended its Treatment Plan to additionally require: (1)\r\n  parenting classes; (2) Father to obtain a mental health evaluation; and (3)\r\n  Mother to obtain depression screening. Â Noting their appeal was pending, Mother\r\n  and Father refused to sign the amended Plan.Â  \r\n[2] The General Assembly amended the Code of Laws of\r\n  South Carolina, effective June 16, 2008, to add Title 63, the South Carolina\r\n  Childrenâ€™s Code, and to transfer all provisions of Title 20, Chapter 7 to Title\r\n  63. Â See Act No. 361, 2008 S.C. Acts 3623 (stating â€œthe transfer and\r\n  reorganization of the code provisions in this act are technical . . . and are\r\n  not intended to be substantiveâ€). Â Because Title 63 has not yet been bound, all\r\ncitations to the statute refer to Title 20.\r\n[3] An unfounded report is one â€œfor which there is not a\r\n  preponderance of evidence to believe that the child is abused or neglected.â€Â Â§ 20-7-490(10).Â  On the other\r\n  hand, an indicated report is â€œsupported by facts which warrant a finding by a\r\n  preponderance of evidence that abuse or neglect is more likely than not to have\r\n  occurred.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-490(11).Â  A preponderance of evidence means â€œevidence which,\r\n  when fairly considered, is more convincing as to its truth than the evidence in\r\n  opposition.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-490(13).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4444","title":"Enos v.

Enos appeals the trial court\r\n  granting a directed verdict in favor of defendant John Doe in an action arising\r\n  out of a motor vehicle accident where the driver is unknown.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nApril Enos (Enos) and her boyfriend left her home between 3:00 and\r\n  4:00 p.m. on Friday, September 13, 2002, â€œto go out drinking.â€Â  They rode in\r\n  her 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but she does not recall who drove.Â  The couple\r\n  went to the Crow Bar in Rock Hill.Â  Enos does not remember how long they were\r\n  there, but later in the afternoon they drove to the Handle Bar about ten or\r\n  fifteen minutes away.Â  Enos verified she and her boyfriend got into an\r\n  argument, and her boyfriend left.Â  Enos returned to the bar and continued to\r\n  drink to the point of â€œgetting intoxicated.â€\r\nEnos maintains she eventually went to her vehicle to go to sleep.Â \r\n  She remembers getting into the Jeepâ€™s passenger seat, reclining the seat, and\r\n  dropping her keys in the cup holder.Â  The next thing she recollects is waking\r\n  up in the hospital.Â  Enos does not know who was driving her Jeep at the time of\r\n  the collision nor anything about how the wreck occurred.Â  She is not aware of\r\n  any witness who observed the accident or who was driving.Â  She testified that\r\n  she was familiar with the location of the accident.Â  She described the curve as\r\n  â€œa very sharp curveâ€ and â€œa fifteen mile an hour curve.â€\r\nDaniel Leeman, a volunteer firefighter who responded to the\r\n  accident, asserted that the Jeep appeared to have hit a bridge abutment located\r\n  between two curves in the roadway.Â  He declared there is a sharp left curve\r\n  before the bridge when traveling south from Rock Hill, which was seemingly the\r\n  vehicleâ€™s direction of travel.Â  Leeman found Enos on the passenger side.Â  He\r\n  saw a hole in the passenger side of the windshield consistent with her hitting\r\n  the windshield.Â  \r\nJeffrey Scott Burch, a paramedic with Chester County EMS, arrived at the scene and discovered Enos sitting on the passenger side of the\r\n  vehicle complaining of right shoulder pain.Â  He verified most of the damage was\r\n  to the right front side of the vehicle and â€œthe windshield was bulged out where\r\n  her head hit.â€Â  She had noticeable wounds to the right side of her neck, right\r\n  ear, and a busted mouth and nose.Â  \r\nEnos brought an action against John Doe pursuant to her uninsured\r\n  motorist coverage and sections 38-77-150 and 38-77-170 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code, alleging that an unknown driver had driven her car into a bridge abutment\r\n  while she was a passenger.Â  Enosâ€™s insurance carrier, Travelers Indemnity\r\n  Company (Travelers), answered in the name of John Doe denying the allegations\r\n  and alleging comparative negligence.Â  Travelers amended its answer to include\r\n  several defenses, one of which was that Enos was without standing to prosecute\r\n  the action because she failed to produce an affidavit from a witness, other\r\n  than the owner or operator of the vehicle, attesting to the truth of the facts\r\n  of the accident as required by section 38-77-170(2).\r\nTravelers moved for summary judgment on the bases that (1) strict\r\n  compliance with the statutes allowing an insured to recover UM benefits where\r\n  damages are caused by an unknown driver is mandated; (2) S.C. Code section\r\n  38-77-150 requires the insured be â€œlegally entitled to recoverâ€ from the owner\r\n  or operator of an insured vehicle, but Enos admitted she had no information or\r\n  evidence as to what actions, if any, of the alleged driver contributed to the\r\n  collision and that she had not alleged any other vehicle was involved; (3) S.C.\r\n  Code section 38-77-170 dictates, under the circumstances presented, the insured\r\n  may not recover UM benefits unless a witness, other than the owner or operator\r\n  of the insured vehicle, signs an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts\r\n  of the accident; (4) Enos confirmed she had no information or evidence that the\r\n  collision in question was witnessed by anyone other than the vehicleâ€™s driver;\r\n  and (5) Enos conceded she had no affidavit from any witnesses.\r\nAt the close of Enosâ€™s case, the court granted Travelersâ€™ motion\r\n  for directed verdict on the grounds: (1) Enos had not complied with section\r\n  38-77-170(2) and (2) Enos failed to present evidence that the defendant\r\n  proximately caused her injuries.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Did the trial court\r\n    err in ruling that Enos was required to comply with the affidavit requirement\r\n    of section 38-77-170(2) by submitting an affidavit from a witness, other than\r\n    the vehicleâ€™s owner or operator, attesting to the facts of the accident?\r\n  2. Did the trial court\r\n    err in directing a verdict on the additional ground that Enos failed to prove\r\n    that her injuries were proximately caused by any negligence or recklessness on\r\n    the part of the unknown driver of her vehicle?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a\r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict, this Court will reverse if no\r\n  evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s decision or the ruling is controlled by an\r\n  error of law.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434-35, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006); McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C.\r\n  559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006).Â  The appellate court must determine\r\n  whether a verdict for the party opposing the motion would be reasonably\r\n  possible under the facts as liberally construed in his or her favor.Â  Pye v.\r\n    Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006); Erickson\r\n      v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663\r\n  (2006).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable\r\n  inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.Â  Proctor\r\n    v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 292, 628 S.E.2d 496,\r\n  503 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  A motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and\r\n  may be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to\r\n  liability.Â  Huffines Co. v. Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 187, 617 S.E.2d 125,\r\n  129 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  When considering directed verdict motions, neither the\r\n  trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues\r\n  or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Wright v. Craft,\r\n  372 S.C. 1, 19, 640 S.E.2d 486, 496 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing Erickson,\r\n  368 S.C. at 463, 629 S.E.2d at 663). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSection\r\n  38-77-170 of the South Carolina Code, entitled â€œConditions to sue or recover\r\n  under uninsured motorist provision when owner or operator of motor vehicle\r\n  causing injury or damage is unknownâ€ and known as the John Doe statute, states:\r\n\r\n  If the\r\n    owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property\r\n    damage to the insured is unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under\r\n    the uninsured motorist provision, unless:\r\n  (1) the\r\n    insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate\r\n    police authority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after\r\n    its occurrence;\r\n  (2) the\r\n    injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, or\r\n    the accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or\r\n    operator of the insured vehicle; provided however, the witness must sign an\r\n    affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained in the\r\n    affidavit;\r\n  (3) the\r\n    insured was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the other\r\n    vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n  The\r\n    following statement must be prominently displayed on the face of the affidavit\r\n    provided in subitem (2) above: A FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED\r\n    IN THIS AFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL\r\n    PENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2002).\r\nI. Statutory Interpretation\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for\r\n  the court.Â  Univ. of S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 275, 617 S.E.2d 135, 137&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2005); see also Catawba Indian Tribe v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524,\r\n  642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007), cert. denied, Oct. 1, 2007; Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory\r\n  interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature. Â Bass v.\r\n    Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 459, 617 S.E.2d 369, 377 (Ct. App. 2005); Georgia-Carolina\r\n      Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 22, 579 S.E.2d 334, 336\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003); Smith v. S.C. Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 87, 564 S.E.2d 358,\r\n  361 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Gordon v. Phillips Utils., Inc.,\r\n  362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005) (â€œThe primary purpose in\r\n  construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€).Â  All rules of\r\n  statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must\r\n  prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that\r\n  language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.\r\n  Â McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d\r\n  240, 242 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County,\r\n  331 S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C.\r\n  359, 365-66, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Hudson, 336\r\n  S.C. 237, 246, 519 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œOnce the legislature has\r\n  made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment\r\n  based upon their own notions of public policy.â€ Â S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins.\r\n    Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nThe\r\n  legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of\r\n  the statute. Â State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 102, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Stephen\r\n    v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 339, 478 S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  The language must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter\r\n  and accords with its general purpose.Â  Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT &amp; T\r\n    Commcâ€™ns of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004); Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420\r\n  S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582. Â \r\nWhen a\r\n  statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for\r\n  statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its\r\n  literal meaning. Â Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 307, 613 S.E.2d 364,\r\n  366 (2005); Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314\r\n  S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994).Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is\r\n  unambiguous and clear, there is no need to employ the rules of statutory\r\n  construction and this Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.\r\n  Â Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 373, 585 S.E.2d 292, 298\r\n  (2003); Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d\r\n  890, 892 (1995); see also City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C.\r\n  556, 561, 486 S.E.2d 492, 495 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œWhere the language of the\r\n  statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters\r\n  into it which are not in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€). Â What a legislature\r\n  says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the\r\n  legislative intent or will. Â Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C.\r\n  115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001). Â The words of a statute must be\r\n  given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced\r\n  construction. Â Durham v. United Cos. Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600,\r\n  604, 503 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1998); Adkins v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 323 S.C.\r\n  409, 411, 475 S.E.2d 762, 763 (1996); Worsley Cos. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health\r\n    &amp; Envtl. Control, 351 S.C. 97, 102, 567 S.E.2d 907, 910 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 402,\r\n  175 S.E.2d 805, 817 (1970) (observing that where the language of the statute is\r\n  clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters\r\n  into it that are not in the legislatureâ€™s language). Â Under the plain meaning\r\n  rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and\r\n  unambiguous statute. Â Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578,\r\n  581 (2000); Bayle, 344 S.C. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739.Â  \r\nIf the\r\n  language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent,\r\n  the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act\r\n  itself. Â Morgan, 352 S.C. at 367, 574 S.E.2d at 207; see also Wade\r\n    v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (â€œ[W]here\r\n  a statute is ambiguous, the Court must construe the terms of the statute.â€). Â An\r\n  ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial, and\r\n  equitable operation of the law. Â Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at\r\n  582; Brassell, 326 S.C. at 561, 486 S.E.2d at 495; City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 376, 498 S.E.2d 894,\r\n  896 (Ct. App. 1998). Â In construing a statute, the court looks to the language\r\n  as a whole in light of its manifest purpose. Â State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C.\r\n  162, 166, 573 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2002); Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320\r\n  S.C. 213, 217, 464 S.E.2d 109, 112 (1995); Brassell, 326 S.C. at 560,\r\n  486 S.E.2d at 494.\r\nA\r\n  statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair\r\n  interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.\r\n  Â Wieters v. Bon-Secours-St. Francis Xavier Hosp., Inc., 378 S.C. 160,\r\n  170, 662 S.E.2d 430, 436 (Ct. App. 2008); see also Georgia-Carolina\r\n    Bail Bonds, 354 S.C. at 22, 579 S.E.2d at 336 (â€œA statute should be given a\r\n  reasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy\r\n  expressed in the statute.â€). Â The real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will\r\n  prevail over the literal import of the words.Â  Browning v. Hartvigsen,\r\n  307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992).\r\nCourts\r\n  will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly\r\n  absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat\r\n  the plain legislative intention. Â N.Y. Times Co. v. Spartanburg County Sch.\r\n    Dist. No. 7, 374 S.C. 307, 312, 649 S.E.2d 28, 30 (2007); Kiriakides v.\r\n      United Artists Commcâ€™ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366\r\n  (1994); Grinnell Corp. v. Wood, 378 S.C. 458, 469, 663 S.E.2d 61, 67\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008). Â A court should not consider a particular clause in a statute\r\n  as being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the\r\n  purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  Houston v. Deloach\r\n    &amp; Deloach, 378 S.C. 543, 551, 663 S.E.2d 85, 89 (Ct. App. 2008); see\r\n      also Mid-State Auto Auction v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d\r\n  690, 692 (1996) (stating that in ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a\r\n  court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider\r\n  the language of the statute as a whole).\r\nII. A Retrospection of the John\r\n  Doe Statute\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court undertook a historical review of the John Doe\r\n  statute in Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002).Â  The\r\n  court annunciated:\r\n\r\n  Our\r\n    General Assembly first enacted a John Doe statute in 1963. Â The statute as\r\n    first enacted required â€œphysical contact with the unknown vehicleâ€ before the\r\n    plaintiff could recover.Â  See Act No. 312, 1963 S.C. Acts 535.\r\n  In 1987,\r\n    the General Assembly relaxed the physical contact requirement, and amended the\r\n    John Doe statute to provide that a plaintiff has no right of action or recovery\r\n    unless â€œthe injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown\r\n    vehicle, or the accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the\r\n    owner or operator of the insured vehicle.â€Â  Act No. 166, 1987 S.C. Acts 1122.Â  Under\r\n    the 1987 amendment, a witness-sworn affidavit was not required.\r\n  The\r\n    legislature again amended the statute in 1989, and added the sworn affidavit\r\n    requirement.Â  The statute at large effecting this most recent amendment\r\n    provides that the act is â€œto amend section 38-77-170 relating to the\r\n    requirements to recover under the uninsured motorist provisions when the\r\n    at-fault party is unknown, so as to require a witness to the accident to sign\r\n    an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts about the accident and to\r\n    provide a warning statement to be displayed on the affidavit.â€Â  Act No. 148,\r\n    1989 S.C. Acts 439 (emphasis supplied).\r\n  As\r\n    written, section 38-77-170 contains requirements necessary to support a\r\n    plaintiffâ€™s â€œright of action.â€ Blackâ€™s defines â€œright of actionâ€ as:\r\n  1. The\r\n    right to bring a specific case to court. 2. A right that can be enforced by\r\n    legal action; a chose in action. Cf. cause of action.\r\n  Blackâ€™s\r\n    Law Dictionary 1324 (Bryan A. Garner\r\n    ed., 7th ed, West 1999).Â  Without a sworn affidavit, a plaintiff has no right\r\n    of action.Â  In other words, without the affidavit, she has no right to bring\r\n    her case to court.\r\n\r\nCollins, 352 S.C. at 466-67, 574 S.E.2d at 741.\r\nIn Unisun\r\n  Insurance Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529 S.E.2d 280 (2000), the court addressed\r\n  what qualifies as an uninsured motor vehicle.Â  January Oâ€™Nealeâ€™s father gave\r\n  her a BMW with strict instructions not to let anyone else drive the car.Â  Miss\r\n  Oâ€™Neale and her friend Jennifer Hurst attended a party at Christopher Schmidtâ€™s\r\n  house.Â  During the party, Schmidt and Hurst got into the BMW.Â  Schmidt later\r\n  drove off in the car with Hurst asleep in the backseat.Â  Schmidt lost control\r\n  of the car and hit a tree, injuring Hurst.Â  Hurst had the consent of the owner\r\n  of the BMW and of the permissive user daughter to occupy the vehicle to, from,\r\n  and while attending the party.Â  Schmidtâ€™s driving of the automobile was not\r\n  consensual, but Hurstâ€™s use of the vehicle was at all times consensual.\r\nState\r\n  Farm, the carrier for the BMW, successfully denied liability coverage due to\r\n  the non-permissive use by Schmidt.Â  Hurst then claimed the denial of liability\r\n  coverage by State Farm rendered the BMW an uninsured motor vehicle.Â  Hurst argued because she was a permissive occupant and/or guest and/or user of the car at\r\n  the time of the accident, she was covered under State Farmâ€™s uninsured motorist\r\n  policy and the uninsured motor vehicle insurance statutes.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (2002).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court agreed and found Hurst was an insured under the uninsured motorist\r\n  coverage of the State Farm policy in effect at the time on the Oâ€™Neale BMW, and\r\n  the car was an uninsured motor vehicle.Â  Jennifer Hurst could therefore make an\r\n  uninsured motorist claim against the State Farm policy insuring the Oâ€™Neale\r\n  BMW.Â  We reversed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.Â  The court edified:Â  \r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    the Court of Appeals erred in concluding the Oâ€™Neale vehicle was not a vehicle\r\n    â€œto which the policy applied.â€Â  The Court of Appeals followed the factually\r\n    analogous case of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Harleysville, 203\r\n    Va. 600, 125 S.E.2d 840 (1962), in interpreting the clause â€œto which the policy\r\n    appliesâ€ to deny coverage.Â  However, this Court has not interpreted the clause\r\n    in such a restrictive manner.Â  The â€œmotor vehicle to which the policy appliesâ€\r\n    is â€œthe motor vehicle designated in the policy.â€Â  The words â€œto which the\r\n    policy appliesâ€ are words of identification, and not words of exclusion as used\r\n    by the Court of Appeals.\r\n  Second,\r\n    we disagree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion the Oâ€™Neale vehicle was not\r\n    being â€œused with the consent of the insured.â€Â  The Court of Appeals incorrectly\r\n    focused on Schmidtâ€™s operation of the vehicle, rather than the â€œuseâ€ of the\r\n    vehicle by Hurst, which Respondent stipulated â€œwas at all times consensual.â€\r\n\r\nSchmidt, 339 S.C. at 366-67, 529 S.E.2d at 282 (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nOn\r\n  the second issue, as to whether the Oâ€™Neale vehicle was an uninsured motor vehicle,\r\n  the court expounded:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    purpose of the uninsured motorist law is â€œto provide benefits and protection\r\n    against the peril of injury or death by an uninsured motorist to an insured\r\n    motorist, his family, and the permissive users of his vehicle.â€Â  In the instant\r\n    case, a permissive user (Hurst) was injured by an uninsured motorist (Schmidt).Â \r\n    When State Farm successfully denied liability, the Oâ€™Neale vehicle became an\r\n    uninsured motor vehicle.\r\n  The\r\n    uninsured motorist statute does not appear to contemplate single-car accidents.Â \r\n    We do not believe, however, the legislature intended an otherwise insured\r\n    passenger to lose coverage when an unauthorized driver takes the wheel.Â  The\r\n    construction of the statute urged by respondent would relieve the carrier of\r\n    responsibility when a named insured is the victim of a carjacking.Â  We will\r\n    reject a statutory interpretation when to accept it would lead to a result so\r\n    plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would\r\n    defeat the plain legislative intention.Â  Our interpretation of Â§ 38-77-30(13)\r\n    comports with the plain language of the statute and advances its policies.\r\n\r\nId. at 368, 529 S.E.2d at 283 (citations omitted).\r\nIn Collins\r\n  v. Doe, Collins took evasive action to avoid colliding with an unknown\r\n  driver who failed to yield the right of way at an intersection.Â  352 S.C. at\r\n  464-465, 574 S.E.2d at 740.Â  In doing so, she hit another vehicle.Â  Collins\r\n  failed to present a signed affidavit, but she did produce a witness who\r\n  testified at trial that a vehicle driven by Doe caused the accident.Â  Id.Â  The trial court found that Collinsâ€™s failure to supply an affidavit was fatal\r\n  to her cause of action.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme Court articulated:\r\n\r\n  In this\r\n    case, the Court of Appeals held that the purpose of the sworn affidavit\r\n    requirement is served where a witness testifies at trial.Â  We disagree.Â  We\r\n    discern three purposes for the sworn affidavit requirement.Â  The obvious\r\n    purpose, fraud prevention, is seemingly served by the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n    conclusion.Â  By offering sworn trial testimony, the witness subjects herself to\r\n    the criminal penalties for perjury.Â  However, the statute reflects that the\r\n    legislatureâ€™s chosen vehicle for fraud prevention under these circumstances is\r\n    a sworn affidavit prominently displaying the prescribed disclaimer.Â  The\r\n    disclaimer alerts the affiant that she may be subject to criminal penalties for\r\n    providing untrue information.Â  The affidavit also allows the defendant, at\r\n    trial, to cross examine the witness regarding the statement.Â  The Court of\r\n    Appealsâ€™ holding forecloses the defendant's ability to conduct cross\r\n    examination regarding the witnessâ€™s statement in the affidavit.\r\n  In\r\n    addition, the affidavit constitutes tangible evidence that the insured has a\r\n    good faith basis for making the claim.\r\n  Finally,\r\n    the sworn affidavit requirement fulfills a notice function: Providing, upon\r\n    request, the defendant-insurer with information relating to the validity of the\r\n    plaintiffâ€™s case.Â  Without the affidavit, and without the opportunity to\r\n    interview the witness, the insurer is deprived of valuable factual information\r\n    with which to assess and evaluate the claim.\r\n\r\nId. at 469-70, 574 S.E.2d at 743 (footnote omitted).Â  \r\nThe Supreme\r\n  Court examined the statutory requirement of section 38-77-170(2) in Gilliland\r\n    v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 592 S.E.2d 626 (2004).Â  Gilliland advanced that two\r\n  young men waved at her from a pick-up truck as she was leaving a grocery store\r\n  at night.Â  The men began to follow her and â€œâ€˜rode her bumperâ€™ for a two-mile\r\n  stretch.â€Â  Id. at 198, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Gilliland sped up in an attempt\r\n  to get away from the truck, but she lost control of her car, ran off the road,\r\n  and hit a tree.Â  She testified that the truck never made contact with her car\r\n  and that the boys backed off when she began to lose control.Â  Id.Â  Gayle\r\n  Norris was stopped at a nearby intersection when she saw the lights of two\r\n  vehicles come around the curve.Â  After Gillilandâ€™s accident, Norris observed the\r\n  lights of an automobile behind Gilliland â€œâ€˜arc through a fieldâ€™ as if it were\r\n  making a U-turn.â€Â  Id. at 199, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury returned a verdict for Gilliland, and the trial court denied Doeâ€™s motion\r\n  for JNOV.Â  This Court reversed and granted the JNOV.Â  The Supreme Court\r\n  considered whether Norrisâ€™s testimony met the â€œindependent witnessâ€ requirement\r\n  of section 38-77-170:\r\n\r\n  We find\r\n    the record includes sufficient evidence that an unknown vehicle was involved in\r\n    Petitionerâ€™s accident.\r\n  In Marks\r\n    v. Indus. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 212 S.C. 502, 505, 48 S.E.2d 445,\r\n    446, this Court held that â€œ[t]he attending circumstances along with direct\r\n    testimony may be taken into account by the jury in arriving at its decision as\r\n    any fact in issue may be established by circumstantial evidence, if the\r\n    circumstances, which must themselves be proven lead to the conclusion with\r\n    reasonable certainty.â€\r\n  We now\r\n    hold that the testimony of Gayle Norris contained circumstantial evidence that\r\n    supports Petitionerâ€™s testimony that an unknown driver contributed to her\r\n    accident.Â  Norrisâ€™s testimony that she saw the lights of an unknown car that\r\n    was turning around and fleeing the scene of the accident sufficiently\r\n    corroborates Petitionerâ€™s testimony creating a question of fact as to causation\r\n    for the jury.\r\n\r\nId. at 202, 592 S.E.2d at 628-29.\r\nIn Shealy\r\n  v. Doe, 370 S.C. 194, 634 S.E.2d 45 (Ct. App. 2006), cert denied,\r\n  Aug. 9, 2007, we discussed the witness affidavit requirement.Â  Eddie Bolin was\r\n  driving a pickup truck owned by Dale Leaphart.Â  Jason Shealy and Ronald Cromer\r\n  sat in the bed of the truck.Â  Bolin swerved abruptly, throwing Shealy and\r\n  Cromer from the truck.Â  Bolin later explained to Shealy and the police that he\r\n  swerved to avoid hitting an unknown vehicle.Â  Shealy filed a complaint against\r\n  the unknown driver to recover against Leaphartâ€™s UM carrier for his injuries.\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    affidavit he attached to his complaint stated:\r\n  Personally\r\n    appeared before me, Jason Shealy, who being duly sworn deposes and says as\r\n    follows:\r\n  That he\r\n    is Jason Shealy and that on or about June 7, 2003, he was a passenger in a\r\n    pickup truck being driven by Eddie Bolin and, upon information and belief,\r\n    owned by Dale Leaphart.Â  That the pickup truck was being driven on Highway 391\r\n    near Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina.Â  That Eddie Bolin sharply,\r\n    unexpectedly and suddenly swerved the truck near the entrance to Leaphart\r\n    Acres, throwing the affiant and another passenger from the bed of the truck\r\n    onto the roadway.Â  That the day following the incident the affiant was told by\r\n    Eddie Bolin that an unknown vehicle and driver had come onto the roadway in the\r\n    path of the truck causing Eddie Bolin to sharply and unexpectedly maneuver the\r\n    truck he was driving to avoid a collision.\r\n  A FALSE\r\n    STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THIS AFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE\r\n    PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.\r\n\r\nId. at 197, 634 S.E.2d at 46-47.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Shealy submitted the affidavit of Ronald Cromer, which contained identical\r\n  language to Shealyâ€™s affidavit.Â  The trial court granted Doeâ€™s motion to\r\n  dismiss, recognizing that evidence presented during the hearing converted the\r\n  motion into one for summary judgment.Â  The court held Shealy failed to comply\r\n  with the witness affidavit requirement of section 38-77-170(2).Â  We explained:\r\n\r\n  Section\r\n    38-77-170(2) is clear on its face.Â  It expressly requires that someone other\r\n    than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle witness the accident.Â  As\r\n    stated in Wausau Underwriters Insurance Company v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269,\r\n    275, 422 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1992), â€œno physical contact with the unknown vehicle\r\n    is necessary when a witness other than the owner or driver of the insured\r\n    vehicle is able to attest to the facts of the accident.â€Â  (Emphasis\r\n    added.)Â  See also Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 470, 574 S.E.2d\r\n    739, 744 (2002) (â€œThe plain language of Â§ 38-77-170 requires that where the\r\n    accident involves no physical contact between the insuredâ€™s vehicle and the\r\n    unidentified vehicle, the accident â€˜must have been witnessed by someone other\r\n    than the owner or operator of the insured vehicleâ€™ and the â€˜witness must sign\r\n    an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained\r\n    therein.â€™â€).Â  Shealy asserts section 38-77-170(2) does not require the witness\r\n    affidavit to be based on personal knowledge.Â  This argument directly\r\n    contravenes the language of the statute.Â  Shealy submitted affidavits of two\r\n    people who apparently did not witness the accident; their affidavits do not\r\n    attest to facts they perceived, but merely restate the perceptions of the\r\n    vehicleâ€™s operator.Â  Thus, Shealy produced no evidence that someone other than\r\n    Bolin, the operator of the insured vehicle, witnessed the accident.Â  Shealyâ€™s\r\n    and Cromerâ€™s affidavits do not comply with this express directive.\r\n  . . .\r\n  According\r\n    to Shealy, requiring the affiant to have witnessed the accident creates an\r\n    unreasonably harsh result because a sleeping passenger or blind passenger\r\n    injured by a John Doe driver might be precluded from recovery.Â  Yet the statute\r\n    indubitably bars an operator and lone occupant of a vehicle from recovery where\r\n    no contact is made with the unknown driver and where no one else witnesses the\r\n    accident.Â  In both instances, the result is lamentable to the injured party,\r\n    but mandated by the statute.Â  Section 38-77-170 demonstrates a policy decision\r\n    by the legislature which balances the interest of parties injured in accidents\r\n    with unknown drivers, with the interest of insurance companies in preventing\r\n    fraudulent claims.Â  Where the legislature determines policy and promulgates a\r\n    clear rule of law, there is no room for the courts to alter that decision.\r\n\r\nId. at 200-01, 634 S.E.2d at 48-49.\r\nIII. Application to the Case Sub\r\n  Judice\r\nEnos\r\n  admits she cannot comply with the affidavit requirement of section 38-77-170(2).Â \r\n  The only witnesses to the accident were Enos, the vehicleâ€™s owner, and\r\n  presumably, the unknown operator of the vehicle.Â  We discussed the hypothetical\r\n  consequence to a sleeping or blind passenger in Shealy v. Doe.Â  370 S.C.\r\n  at 201, 634 S.E.2d at 49.Â  We described the resulting bar to recovery as\r\n  â€œlamentable to the injured party, but mandated by the statute.â€Â  Id.Â  The same outcome applies to an intoxicated passenger with no recollection,\r\n  which embraces Enos on the morning of and night prior to the accident.\r\nEven\r\n  if Enos were not intoxicated and could remember who was driving at the time of\r\n  the accident, the legislature has clearly dictated that recovery from an\r\n  uninsured motorist carrier is only allowed when certain conditions are met.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2002) (â€œIf the owner or operator of any motor\r\n  vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is\r\n  unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under the uninsured\r\n    motorist provision, unless: . . .â€) (emphasis added).Â  Because there was no\r\n  physical contact with another vehicle, Enos must present an affidavit from â€œsomeone\r\n  other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicleâ€ in order to bring an\r\n  action or recover.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170(2) (2002).Â  The General Assembly\r\n  has unequivocally spoken on the prerequisites to bringing an action against an\r\n  uninsured motorist carrier, and Enos has failed to meet the sine qua non prescribed by the legislature.\r\nEnosâ€™s\r\n  argument that the legislature did not intend to require affidavits in\r\n  single-vehicle accidents is unavailing.Â  Enos is correct in her assertion that\r\n  â€œ[t]he uninsured motorist statute â€˜is remedial in nature, enacted for the\r\n  benefit of injured persons, and is to be liberally construed so that the\r\n  purpose intended may be accomplished.â€™â€Â  Schmidt, 339 S.C. at 366, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 282 (quoting Gunnels v. Am. Liberty Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242,\r\n  247, 161 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1968)).Â  Section 38-77-170(2) requires an affidavit\r\n  when there is no physical contact with an unknown vehicle, but it is not\r\n  restricted to a collision caused by an unknown vehicle.Â  The affidavit\r\n  requirement applies equally to a single-car accident as an accident caused by\r\n  an unknown vehicle.Â  â€œWhen a\r\n  statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for\r\n  statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its\r\n  literal meaning.â€ Â Thompson ex rel. Harvey v. Cisson Constr. Co., 377 S.C. 137, 157, 659\r\n  S.E.2d 171, 181 (Ct. App. 2008). \r\nWe\r\n  do not reach Enosâ€™s second issue regarding evidence of Doeâ€™s negligence because\r\n  her action is barred for her failure to comply with section 38-77-170(2).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOur\r\n  courts have historically required strict compliance with section 38-77-170.Â  Collins,\r\n  352 S.C. at 470, 574 S.E.2d at 743.Â  The statute is clear and unambiguous.Â \r\n  Enos may not maintain an action against an unknown driver where there is no\r\n  witness to the accident other than the vehicleâ€™s owner or operator.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the judgment of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4445","title":"Baumann v.

Enforcement In addition to the\r\n    foregoing, the Association or a Property Owner shall have the right to proceed\r\n    at law or in equity to compel compliance to the terms hereof or to prevent the\r\n    violation or breach in any event.Â  \r\n  In the event of any litigation, the\r\n    prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n    and costs of such litigation.Â  If the violation is not expeditiously terminated, the\r\n    Association may engage legal counsel to bring an appropriate injunctive action,\r\n    including any appeals, to enforce these covenants.Â  Violators shall be\r\n      obligated to reimburse the Association in full for all its direct and indirect\r\n      costs, including but not limited to legal fees incurred by the Association in\r\n      maintaining compliance with theses covenants.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  January 2006, the Board approved a nine-year agreement with Club Car Corporation\r\n  for $450,000, under which Club Car was to provide Long Cove with golf carts.Â \r\n  Additionally, in June 2006, the Board approved a proposal for $525,000 from\r\n  Plantation Interiors, Inc. to refurbish and redecorate the club house.Â  Long\r\n  Cove did not submit either of these expenditures for member approval at the\r\n  annual meeting or in a separate referendum. \r\nNinety-two\r\n  members of Long Cove submitted a request for a referendum on the two\r\n  expenditures, which the Board determined to meet the fifteen percent required\r\n  for referendum.Â  The Board mailed the members information about a â€œSpecial\r\n  Meeting of the Associationâ€ regarding the request for the referendum.Â  The\r\n  mailing included a â€œNotice of Special Meeting,â€ which stated the purpose of the\r\n  meeting was â€œ[t]o receive the report from the Inspector of Elections on the\r\n  results of an election to decide whether action by Referendum shall be required\r\n  in connection with approval of the â€˜long-term plan to purchase golf carts and\r\n  the $525,000.00 Redecorating and Refurbishing Plan.â€™â€Â  The mailing also\r\n  included a statement from the members who had called for the meeting.Â  In that\r\n  statement, the members explained they had called for the meeting to approve or\r\n  disapprove the following two actions undertaken by the Board: \r\n\r\n  At a Meeting of the Board of Directors on January 23, 2006\r\n    approved the execution of a long-term agreement, for approximately $450,000,\r\n    with ClubCar Corp for the purchase and replacement of our golf cart fleet for\r\n    the period 2006-2014 and; \r\n  At an Executive Session of the Board on June 28, 2006 approved the\r\n    redecoration and refurnishing of the clubhouse at a cost of approximately\r\n    $525,000.\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 2006, the Board conducted a referendum.Â  The\r\n  choices for voters were â€œDo Not Require a Referendumâ€ and â€œRequire a\r\n  Referendum.â€Â  251 votes were cast for â€œDo Not Require a Referendumâ€ and 102\r\n  votes were cast for â€œRequire a Referendum.â€\r\nIn\r\n  September 2006, the Baumanns filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to\r\n  compel Long Cove to comply with the Covenants.Â  Following a bench trial, the\r\n  trial court found for Long Cove.[1]Â  The Baumanns\r\n  filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration and Long Cove applied for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The trial court denied both the motion for reconsideration\r\n  and Long Coveâ€™s application for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œRestrictive covenants are construed like contracts\r\n  and may give rise to actions for breach of contract.â€Â  Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal Prop.

Â Additionally, the Baumanns contend\r\n  the trial court erred in finding Long Cove had the right to frame the question\r\n  for the referendum.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nA corporation can only exercise the powers granted to\r\n  it by law, its charter or articles of incorporation, and any by-laws made\r\n  pursuant thereto.Â Â  Lovering v.

Nealco, Inc.,&nbsp;310 S.C. 492, 493,\r\n  427 S.E.2d 659, 660&nbsp;(1993). Â Because\r\n  the Baumanns did not prevail in proving Long Cove had violated the Covenants,\r\n  the trial court did not err in failing to award them attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nII.Â  Long\r\n  Coveâ€™s Appeal\r\nLong\r\n  Cove argues the trial court erred in failing to award it attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  because the Covenants provided a prevailing party shall be entitled to recover\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Queenâ€™s\r\n  Grant II, 368 S.C. at 373-75, 628 S.E.2d at 919-20, this court reviewed\r\n  covenants containing an attorneyâ€™s fees clause similar to that in this case.Â  The\r\n  section of the covenants Greenwood Development relied upon to support its claim for attorney fees and costs provided:\r\n\r\n  Enforcement. Greenwood shall have the right, but shall not be\r\n    obligated, to proceed at law or in equity to complete compliance to the terms\r\n    of this Agreement or to prevent violation or breach in any event. Â Violators\r\n    shall be personally obligated to reimburse Greenwood in full for all its direct\r\n    and indirect costs, including, but not limited to, legal fees incurred by\r\n    Greenwood in maintaining compliance with this declaration, and such obligation\r\n    shall constitute a lien upon the violatorâ€™s property in accordance with Section\r\n    8-8.\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  374, 628 S.E.2d at 920.&nbsp; This court\r\n  found, â€œThe question presented is whether Queenâ€™s Grant may be considered a\r\n  â€˜violatorâ€™ in filing and pursuing its Complaint, primarily seeking prospective\r\n  declaratory relief.â€Â  Id.Â  The court determined, â€œThe\r\n  provision allows for the recovery of attorney fees only against â€˜violatorsâ€™ of the covenants.Â  Because Queenâ€™s Grant may\r\n  not be fairly characterized as a â€˜violatorâ€™ of the covenants, we affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s denial of\r\n  Greenwood Developmentâ€™s motion for attorney fees.â€Â  Id. at 375, 628 S.E.2d at\r\n  920.\r\nThe record contains\r\n  evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision that the Covenants only provided\r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees for parties who demonstrate the opposing party violated the\r\n  Covenants.Â  Long Cove did not prove or even allege the Baumanns had violated any\r\n  Covenants.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Long Coveâ€™s\r\n  request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause\r\n  the evidence in the record supports the finding that the expenditures were\r\n  approved by referendum, the trial court did not err in finding Long Cove did\r\n  not violate the Covenants.Â  Additionally, the trial court did not err in\r\n  failing to award the Baumanns because the Baumanns were not a prevailing\r\n  party.Â  Moreover, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Long Coveâ€™s request for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees because it did not allege the Baumanns had violated the\r\n  Covenants.Â  Accordingly, the trial court\r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In the order, the trial court actually stated it was\r\n  dismissing the Baumannâ€™s amended complaint with prejudice.Â  However, in its\r\n  order denying Long Coveâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and the Baumannsâ€™ motion for\r\nreconsideration, it stated it had entered judgment in favor of Long Cove.\r\n[2] The Baumanns further maintain the trial court erred\r\n  in finding under the Governance Principles the power to interpret the Covenants\r\n  is vested in the Board.Â  Because the Baumanns abandoned this argument in their\r\n  brief, we will not address it.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v.

Anglin, Jr.,\r\n  Patrick F. Anglin, and Gary A. Anglin, Sr. (collectively Noaha) breached the\r\n  terms of a settlement agreement as read into open court by failing to make an\r\n  unconditional tender of settlement.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND/FACTS\r\n\r\nVista\r\n  Antiques and Persian Rugs, Inc. (Vista) filed suit against Noaha alleging inter alia breach of contract.Â  After the selection of a jury, but before\r\n  opening arguments in the trial, the parties reached a settlement.Â  The record\r\n  of this agreement as read by Vistaâ€™s attorney in open court is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Your Honor, the\r\n    settlement thatâ€™s been reached is that this case will be dismissed with\r\n    prejudice by an order of dismissal with prejudice to be consented to by the\r\n    parties and signed by your honor.\r\n  Furthermore, the defendants, each and every one of\r\n    them, will consent to and sign and deliver to me a confession of judgment which\r\n    will provide for the payment of $165,000 within 18 months.Â  And there will be\r\n    additional payment terms in there, $25,000 of the 165 within 30 days.\r\n  Further, in kind consideration, in addition to the\r\n    165,000 the return of 15 rugs, three of which shall be room size Herizes, the\r\n    confession of judgment will have an attorneyâ€™s fee provision that in the event\r\n    of default, that the cost of enforcing the judgment or collecting the judgment\r\n    will be recoverable.\r\n  And, finally, the confession of judgment will have a\r\n    no contest stipulation.Â  If itâ€™s required to be domesticated in some state\r\n    other than South Carolina, the defendants agree not to contest the\r\n    domestication.\r\n\r\nVista prepared a\r\n  consent order and confession of judgment, which it forwarded to Noaha for\r\n  execution.Â  The order stated:Â  â€œThe Defendants agree to pay the Plaintiff\r\n  $165,000 within 18 months, $25,000 of which shall be paid by February 3, 2006,\r\n  and the balance of $140,000 in 4 equal installment payments of $35,000 plus interest\r\n  beginning June 10, 2006.â€Â  The confession indicated Noaha agreed to pay Vista â€œan attorneyâ€™s fee of 25% of the amount then due in the event of any default in payment\r\n  or performance under the Order.â€Â  \r\nNoaha tendered the\r\n  $25,000 payment[1] to Vista accompanied by a letter stating it â€œhad every intention of fulfilling\r\n  the terms of the Settlement Agreement as expressed in Court . . . .â€Â  However,\r\n  the letter further stated â€œDefendants do not agree with your attempt to add\r\n  interest payments or to require any payment schedule beyond the initial payment\r\n  and the remaining amount due within 18 months.â€Â  \r\nVista filed a\r\n  motion asking the court to award it the full settlement amount.Â  Vista argued Noaha tendered the $25,000 but the tender was conditional thereby violating\r\n  the settlement agreement.Â  The circuit court judge[2] determined Noaha did not timely tender unconditional payment of the $25,000 as\r\n  they had â€œagreed to â€˜additional termsâ€™ in open court and upon the record that\r\n  were to be agreed upon, but have failed to agree to any such terms.â€Â  The court\r\n  ordered Noaha to pay the full $165,000 plus interest pursuant to section\r\n  34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) from February 2, 2006, the\r\n  day the initial payment of $25,000 was tendered, to the date of the entry of\r\n  judgment.[3]Â \r\n  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Breach\r\n  of Settlement Agreement\r\nNoaha\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in finding it failed to make an unconditional\r\n  tender to Vista.Â  We agree.\r\nRule\r\n  43(k) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides no agreement\r\n  between counsel shall be binding unless reduced in writing and entered into the\r\n  record or â€œunless made in open court and noted upon the record.â€Â  The purpose\r\n  of Rule 43(k) is:Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]o\r\n    prevent fraudulent claims of oral stipulations, and to prevent disputes as to\r\n    the existence and terms of agreements and to relieve the court of the necessity\r\n    of determining such disputes, which it has been said are often more perplexing\r\n    than the case itself. The time of the court should not be taken up in\r\n    controversial matters of this character.\r\n\r\nAshfort Corp. v. Palmetto\r\n  Constr. Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 495,\r\n  458 S.E.2d 533, 535 (1995) (quoting 83 C.J.S. Stipulation Â§ 4 (1953)); see\r\n    also Motley v. Williams, 374 S.C. 107, 111, 647 S.E.2d 244, 246 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (stating the application of Rule 43(k) will help avoid disputes\r\n  regarding the terms of settlement). \r\nSettlement\r\n  agreements are reviewed by the circuit court in much the same way as\r\n  contracts.Â  Patricia Grand Hotel, LLC v. MacGuire Enters., 372 S.C. 634,\r\n  640, 643 S.E.2d 692, 695 (Ct. App. 2007).Â Â  When â€œan agreement is clear and\r\n  capable of legal construction, the courts [sic] only function is to interpret\r\n  its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the agreement.â€\r\n  Â Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 628, 598 S.E.2d 310, 317 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n  When an agreement is plain and unambiguous, the court does not have the\r\n  authority to modify its terms.Â  Patricia Grand Hotel, 372 S.C. at 640,\r\n  643 S.E.2d at 695. Â â€œHowever, where â€˜the language of a settlement agreement is\r\n  susceptible of more than one interpretation, it is the duty of the court to\r\n  ascertain the intentions of the parties.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Mattox v.\r\n    Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, 60, 344 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1986)).\r\nVista relies on the phrase â€œadditional payment termsâ€ to\r\n  support its contention that the parties agreed to negotiate certain additional\r\n  terms including a payment schedule, interest, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Noaha\r\n  claims it never agreed to additional terms and such terms were not part of the\r\n  agreement as they were not read into the record.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court held a very brief hearing regarding Vistaâ€™s motion to enforce the\r\n  settlement agreement on the record.Â  In this hearing, Noaha contended it never\r\n  agreed to any terms other than what was specifically read into the record in\r\n  open court.Â  The circuit court judge then heard the parties in chambers so that\r\n  any other evidence regarding intentions is not before us for review.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we are left primarily with the transcript of the settlement agreement to\r\n  consider.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, to read additional specific terms into the agreement, without\r\n  evidence such terms were contemplated by the parties, seems to reach beyond our\r\n  judicial purview.Â  It is possible no actual meeting of the minds occurred in\r\n  this case.Â  See Patricia Grand Hotel, 372 S.C. at 638-39, 643\r\n  S.E.2d at 694-95 (discussing Ozyagcilar v. Davis, 701 F.3d 306 (4th Cir.\r\n  1989) wherein the appellate court reversed the district courtâ€™s enforcement of\r\n  a settlement agreement upon a partyâ€™s request when there was no meeting of the\r\n  minds as to the specifics of the settlement agreement).Â  However, neither party\r\n  argues there was no meeting of the minds or seeks to have the agreement set\r\n  aside in this case.Â  \r\nIn Harris-Jenkins\r\n  v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 557 S.E.2d 708 (2001), the court\r\n  considered whether attorneyâ€™s fees were contemplated under a settlement agreement.Â \r\n  The defendants offered $20,000 to the plaintiffs to settle all claims.Â  Id. at 178, 557 S.E.2d at 711.Â  The plaintiffs accepted the offer.Â  Id.Â  The court concluded no other terms were added, and the court was without the\r\n  power to add them.Â  Id.Â  â€œWe are without authority to alter a contract\r\n  by construction or to make new contracts for the parties.Â  Our duty is limited\r\n  to the contract made by the parties themselves â€˜regardless of its wisdom or\r\n  folly, apparent unreasonableness, or failure to guard their rights carefully.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting C.A.N. Enters. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin.\r\n    Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1988)).\r\nLooking\r\n  at the settlement agreement, we believe Noaha made an unconditional tender of\r\n  $25,000 to Vista and thereby did not breach the settlement agreement as read\r\n  into the record.\r\nII. InterestÂ Â Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Noaha maintains the circuit court erred in awarding interest to Noaha from the\r\n  date of the judgment.Â  We agree.\r\nA major point of contention in this case is if and\r\n  when interest was due to Vista on the $165,000 settlement.Â  Full payment of the\r\n  $165,000 was due by July 6, 2007, eighteen months from the date of settlement,\r\n  under either interpretation of the agreement.[4]Â \r\n  Neither party disputes that this total sum was due under the settlement.Â  Noaha\r\n  contends that interest was not a part of the agreement, because it was not a\r\n  term read into the record.Â  However, interest is provided for by statute.Â  Section 34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) provides â€œ[i]n all cases of accounts stated and in\r\n  all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due,\r\n  shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate\r\n  of eight and three-fourths percent per annum.â€ \r\nHad Noaha\r\n  breached the settlement agreement by placing conditions on the $25,000 tender,\r\n  then payment of interest would accrue from the time of that breach, February 3,\r\n  2006.Â  However, because we find Noaha made an unconditional tender that Vista refused, the running of interest stopped.Â  See Ruscon Constr. Co. of Fla.\r\n    v. Beaufort-Jasper Water Auth., 259 S.C. 314, 320, 191 S.E.2d 715, 717\r\n  (1972) (â€œIt is a long recognized principle in our courts that a valid tender\r\n  stops the running of interest.â€).Â  Therefore, statutory interest applies, and it\r\n  would not commence until the date the full payment was due to Vista, July 6,\r\n  2007.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Noaha did\r\n  not breach the settlement agreement and made a valid tender of $25,000 to Vista in accordance with the terms of the agreement as read in open court.Â  We agree with\r\n  the circuit court that Vista is entitled to statutory interest pursuant to\r\n  section 34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code.Â  However, we find the statutory\r\n  prejudgment interest began to run from July 6, 2007, when the full amount of the settlement was\r\n  due.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON\r\nand WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Noaha also gave Vista the rugs contemplated by their\r\nagreement, and there is no dispute on that point.\r\n[2] The trial was before Judge Reginald Lloyd who had\r\n  been appointed as U.S. Attorney for South Carolina at the time of Vistaâ€™s motion to enforce the settlement agreement.Â  The motion was heard by Judge Casey L.\r\nManning.\r\n[3] The payment of $25,000 was tendered on February 2,\r\n2006.Â  The parties agree that payment was due on or before February 3, 2006.\r\n[4] Noaha did not pay the settlement amount to Vista on or before July 6, 2007, nor did Noaha pay the money into the court pending the\r\nresolution of this litigation.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4447","title":"State v.

Peper, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n          Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor\r\n          Scarlett Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J.:Â  Onrae Williams was convicted of distribution of crack\r\n  cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a school.Â  Based\r\n  upon two prior â€œseriousâ€ convictions, the trial court sentenced Williams to\r\n  life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on both charges.Â  On\r\n  appeal, Williams asserts error in (1) the trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow him to\r\n  impeach the testimony of the confidential informant with evidence of several\r\n  former convictions that were older than ten years and (2) the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  sentencing of him to life without parole (LWOP) in violation of his\r\n  constitutional protection from cruel and unusual punishment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case involves a controlled buy set up by the City of\r\n  Charleston Police Department using a confidential informant (CI).Â  On August\r\n  10, 2004, officers met with the CI, searched him to insure he had no contraband\r\n  on his person, provided him with money, and equipped him with a button camera\r\n  capable of capturing video.Â  Because there had been numerous complaints about\r\n  drug activity near Harmon Park, the CI was taken close to that area with a\r\n  bicycle, which the CI then used to ride into the area.Â  Following along with\r\n  the videotape of the incident admitted into evidence, Officer Womack indicated\r\n  where the CI came in contact with someone, and ultimately completed a drug\r\n  transaction approximately one hundred yards away from Burke High School.Â  Officer Womack testified he maintained a constant visual on the CI during the\r\n  entire process, as well as a constant audio transmission.Â  When the informant\r\n  was searched before being let out to make the buy, he had no drugs on him.Â \r\n  When he returned, the CI had crack cocaine in his hand.\r\nOfficer Hurteau, who was present with Officer Womack at the\r\n  controlled buy, also testified as the video of the incident was played to the\r\n  jury.Â  He testified the CI was not working off charges, but was a paid\r\n  informant.Â  Officer Hurteau pointed out on the video an individual on a fence\r\n  who was talking on a cell phone and yelled out â€œOnrae,â€ and that one could then\r\n  observe Williams walking up from the fence area.Â  He then noted where the CI\r\n  hands Williams money.Â  Williams is off the camera for a moment and then\r\n  reappears, approaching the CI, at which point Williams is referred to as â€œOn.â€Â \r\n  Williams is seen holding something in his hand, which he places in the CIâ€™s\r\n  hand, and then walks away.Â  When the CI returned to Officer Hurteauâ€™s location,\r\n  he handed him two, off-white rock-like substances.Â  Officer Jenkins, who was\r\n  also present in the area, testified he was on perimeter duty during the\r\n  controlled buy and he observed Williams with another man near the fence as the\r\n  CI approached the area.Â  After reviewing the video of the incident, Officers\r\n  Hurteau and Womack, as well as Officer Jenkins, â€œall immediately without\r\n  hesitation recognized him and said that was Onrae Williams.â€\r\nThe CI also testified to the events of that day.Â  As with Officers\r\n  Womack and Hurteau, he followed along with the videotape of the event,\r\n  identifying Onrae Williams on the tape and noting the completion of the\r\n  transaction where Williams handed him drugs in exchange for money. Â He\r\n  testified that after Williams handed him the drugs, he got back on the bicycle\r\n  and rode back to the police officers and gave them the drugs.Â  The CI confirmed\r\n  that the officers searched him before the transaction, as well as upon his\r\n  return.Â  Subsequent analysis of the item showed it to be .3 grams of crack\r\n  cocaine.\r\nAt the start of the case, Williams made an in limine motion\r\n  seeking to admit evidence of several prior convictions of the CI that were\r\n  greater than ten years old.Â  Specifically, Williams sought to introduce\r\n  evidence of the CIâ€™s 1988 conviction for armed robbery, for which he was\r\n  released from prison on August 1, 1996, as well as several forgeries and a\r\n  larceny that occurred around 1981 and 1982.Â  Williams argued the CIâ€™s\r\n  credibility was key to the trial as the video was not completely clear, and\r\n  that under Rule 609(b), SCRE, the jury should have this information in the\r\n  interest of justice.Â  Williams also noted the CI had a 2002 conviction for\r\n  receiving stolen goods, showing the CI has continued to break the law.Â \r\n  Finally, Williams maintained that the matter had been pending for about a year,\r\n  and had the State tried the case within the first six months, the armed robbery\r\n  conviction would have fallen within the ten year limit under the rule.Â  He\r\n  argued it was the Stateâ€™s delay in bringing the case that caused the ten-year\r\n  period to expire between the time of his arrest and the trial, as his arrest\r\n  occurred in January 2005, a time within the ten-year period.Â  Williams\r\n  acknowledged, however, that he had not made a motion for a speedy trial.\r\nThe trial court noted Williams would be able to challenge the CIâ€™s\r\n  credibility with the prior conviction for receiving stolen goods.Â  It found no\r\n  reason under the facts of this case to extend the time limit for the other\r\n  convictions beyond the cut-off date under the rule, but stated it would rule on\r\n  the matter after Williams proffered the evidence.\r\nDuring the CIâ€™s direct examination, he admitted to having a 2002\r\n  conviction for receiving stolen goods.Â  During the CIâ€™s cross-examination,\r\n  counsel questioned why the CI would become a confidential informant.Â  The CI\r\n  stated it was â€œ[t]o try to keep â€˜em from hurting people,â€ and that it was not\r\n  always about the money he received.Â  Counsel then asked the CI about his\r\n  conviction for receiving stolen goods and asked whether that did not hurt\r\n  people as well.Â  Counsel continued with this line of questioning, asking how\r\n  long the CI had been working as a confidential informant at which point the\r\n  following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n  [Counsel]:Â  But it had nothing to do with the money?\r\n  [CI]:Â  No, it ainâ€™t about the money.Â  I had money, you know.Â  It\r\n    was about the drug deals.Â  I figure itâ€™s about time to make a change now.Â  Iâ€™ve\r\n    done spent half of my life in the penitentiary.\r\n  [Counsel]:Â  Youâ€™ve spent half your life in prison?\r\n  [CI]:Â  Yeah.\r\n  [Counsel]:Â  And now youâ€™ve turned your life around?\r\n  [CI]:Â  Trying to.\r\n  [Counsel]:Â  It was time to make a change?\r\n  [CI]:Â  It was time to make a change, for sure.\r\n  [Counsel]:Â  Youâ€™re an honest man now?\r\n  [CI]:Â  I ainâ€™t going to say honest because I trip up sometimes.\r\n\r\nThereafter, defense counsel asserted the CI opened the door to\r\n  testimony concerning his older prior convictions when he stated he had spent\r\n  half of his life in the penitentiary.Â  The court noted Williams had already\r\n  received a benefit by that answer to the question, and still found no\r\n  exceptional circumstances in light of the CIâ€™s testimony that would warrant\r\n  allowing convictions outside the time limit, but allowed counsel to proffer the\r\n  evidence.Â  Outside the juryâ€™s hearing, the CI admitted he had a 1988 conviction\r\n  for armed robbery for which he served time and was released in August 1996.Â  He\r\n  further acknowledged a 1982 larceny conviction resulting in a two-year\r\n  sentence, suspended to six months, as well as some forgeries and a\r\n  housebreaking conviction in 1982 for which he received a ten-year sentence.Â \r\n  The solicitor objected to introduction of the prior convictions, arguing it was\r\n  not probative, it was unduly prejudicial, and defense counsel had already\r\n  accomplished his goals through the testimony he elicited from the CI.Â  The\r\n  trial court ruled the circumstances did not warrant allowing the older prior\r\n  convictions, and the issue was resolved by the CIâ€™s answers on\r\n  cross-examination.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Williams guilty of the distribution and proximity charges.Â  The\r\n  solicitor stated Williams had several previous convictions, including a 2000\r\n  possession with intent to distribute cocaine and a proximity charge, as well as\r\n  a possession of crack charge, and in 2003 had distribution of marijuana,\r\n  distribution of cocaine, proximity, and possession of cocaine charges.Â  The\r\n  court noted Williams had at least two previous serious offenses such that this\r\n  offense would qualify as a third.Â  Defense counsel agreed and further stated he\r\n  did not believe the court had â€œmuch discretionâ€ as far as sentencing, but\r\n  placed an objection on the record to a life without parole sentence.Â  Counsel\r\n  maintained such a sentence would constitute cruel and unusual punishment as\r\n  this was a drug crime and not a violent crime.Â  He argued, in this case, life\r\n  without parole would be excessive, unduly severe, and would violate the due\r\n  process clause.Â  The court sentenced Williams to life without parole on both\r\n  offenses.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Prior remote convictions\r\nWilliams\r\n  first contends the trial court erred by refusing to allow evidence of the CIâ€™s\r\n  former convictions for armed robbery, larceny, forgery and housebreaking.Â  He\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to admit this evidence because (1) the\r\n  CI opened the door to the evidence by stating he spent half his life in prison\r\n  and (2) the court failed to apply the proper balancing test in ruling Williams\r\n  could not challenge the CIâ€™s credibility pursuant to Rule 609, SCRE.Â  We find\r\n  no reversible error.\r\nThe admission\r\n  or exclusion of evidence falls within the sound discretion of the trial court\r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. Morris, 376 S.C. 189, 205, 656 S.E.2d 359, 368 (2008).Â  As well, the\r\n  scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial court, and the\r\n  courtâ€™s decision will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of prejudice.Â  State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 625, 525 S.E.2d 246, 247-48 (2000).Â \r\n  Further, any error in the trial courtâ€™s failure to conduct the proper balancing\r\n  test in determining whether remote convictions are admissible may be harmless.Â  State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609 S.E.2d 520, 524 (2005). Â To\r\n  constitute error, the trial courtâ€™s ruling to admit or exclude evidence must\r\n  affect a substantial right.Â  Id.; Rule 103(a), SCRE.Â Â  Error is considered\r\n  harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the outcome of the trial.Â  State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 518, 633 S.E.2d 152, 156 (2006).Â  â€œGenerally,\r\n  appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not\r\n  affecting the result.Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of\r\n  the trial is harmless where a defendantâ€™s guilt has been conclusively proven by\r\n  competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€Â  Id. Â (citations omitted). Â In determining whether error is harmless, the\r\n  circumstances of each individual case are to be considered.Â  Id.; Johnson,\r\n  363 S.C. at 60, 609 S.E.2d at 524.\r\nEven\r\n  assuming arguendo that the trial court failed to apply the proper balancing\r\n  test or that the court erred in refusing to admit the evidence based on the\r\n  CIâ€™s opening door, we find any such error would be harmless.Â  Here, contrary to\r\n  Williamsâ€™ assertion, the CI was not the only witness for the State who could\r\n  identify him and place him at the scene.Â  Officer Hurteau testified, while following the videotape, that you\r\n  could hear an individual at the scene yelling out the name â€œOnrae,â€ and at a\r\n  later point on the tape noted Williams is referred to as â€œOn.â€Â Â  He further\r\n  indicated you could observe Williams on the videotape and also could see\r\n  Williams holding a small substance in his hand, which he places in the CIâ€™s\r\n  hand.Â  Officer Jenkins, who was on perimeter duty during the controlled buy,\r\n  testified he observed Williams with another man near the fence as the CI\r\n  approached the area.Â  Officer Womack testified he maintained a constant visual\r\n  on the CI during the entire process, and that the CI was searched before being\r\n  let out to make the buy and had no drugs on him, but had crack cocaine in his\r\n  hand when he returned.Â  Finally, after reviewing the video of the incident,\r\n  Officer Hurteau testified he and Officer Womack, as well as Officer Jenkins,\r\n  all immediately and without hesitation recognized Onrae Williams as the\r\n  individual who sold the drugs to the CI.[1]Â  \r\nFurther, the CI was already impeached with admission of his\r\n  conviction of receiving stolen goods, a crime the CI acknowledged before the\r\n  jury was a crime of dishonesty.Â  The CIâ€™s credibility was clearly called into\r\n  question by this, along with his admission he had spent half of his life in the\r\n  penitentiary and his refusal to characterize himself as honest.Â  See State\r\n    v. Cooper, 312 S.C. 90, 92, 439 S.E.2d 276, 277 (1994) (holding any error in\r\n  excluding evidence of witnessâ€™ prior bad acts harmless, where witness was\r\n  thoroughly impeached by admission of numerous previous convictions and\r\n  acknowledgment his testimony was given for favorable treatment on pending\r\n  charges), overruled in part on other grounds by Franklin v. Catoe,\r\n  346 S.C. 563, 575, 552 S.E.2d 718, 725 (2001); State v. Tillman, 304\r\n  S.C. 512, 520, 405 S.E.2d 607, 612 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding, where witness was\r\n  thoroughly impeached by admission of numerous prior convictions and his\r\n  acknowledgment that he was testifying under an agreement to receive favorable\r\n  treatment on some outstanding charges, any error in excluding evidence of a\r\n  particular crime he might have committed was harmless).Â  \r\nAside from the CIâ€™s testimony, there is evidence of record placing\r\n  Williams at the scene and identifying him as the individual engaged in the drug\r\n  transaction with the CI.Â  There is also evidence showing the CI, while under\r\n  constant visual, returned with drugs that he did not have when he left the\r\n  officers.Â  Given all this evidence, along with the fact that the CI was\r\n  thoroughly impeached by evidence of his crime of dishonesty and his admissions\r\n  he had spent half of his life in jail and that he would not characterize\r\n  himself as honest, we find exclusion of\r\n  the CIâ€™s remote convictions could not reasonably have affected the result of\r\n  the trial.Â  Considering the circumstances of this case, we therefore conclude\r\n  any possible error in the exclusion of the evidence is harmless.\r\nB.Â  LWOP sentence\r\nWilliams\r\n  next contends the trial court erred in sentencing him to life in prison without\r\n  parole in violation of his constitutional protection from cruel and unusual\r\n  punishment.Â  He asserts, under State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 144 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S.Ct. 1872 (2008), the two\r\n  principles to consider in determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual\r\n  are (1) the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing\r\n  society and (2) the proportionality between the punishment and the offense.Â  He\r\n  argues an LWOP sentence for distribution of less than half a gram of a\r\n  controlled substance is inconsistent with evolving standards of contemporary\r\n  values.Â  Williams further asserts an LWOP sentence under the recidivist statute\r\n  is grossly disproportionate to the punishment deserved for distribution of less\r\n  than half a gram of cocaine, especially where the first conviction used to\r\n  qualify him for LWOP was committed as a juvenile.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  17-25-45(B) of the South Carolina Code requires that â€œupon a conviction for a\r\n  serious offense . . . a person must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for\r\n  life without the possibility of parole if that person has two or more prior\r\n  convictions for: Â (1) a serious offense.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(B) (2003).\r\nThe\r\n  Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, â€œExcessive bail\r\n  shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\r\n  punishments inflicted.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIII.Â  The cruel and unusual\r\n  punishment clause requires that the duration of a sentence not be grossly disproportionate\r\n  with the severity of the crime.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 652,\r\n  576 S.E.2d 168, 177 (2003).Â  \r\nMost\r\n  recently, our courts have recognized that â€œwhat constitutes cruel and unusual\r\n  punishment, and thus, what violates the Eighth Amendment, is determined by â€˜evolving\r\n  standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.â€™â€ Â State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 562, 647 S.E.2d 144, 162 (2007), cert. denied,\r\n  128 S.Ct. 1872 (2008) (quoting State v. Standard, 351 S.C. 199, 204, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 325, 328 (2002)). Â In implementing this test, the court looks to\r\n  objective evidence of how our society views a particular punishment today. Â State\r\n    v. Wilson, 306 S.C. 498, 509-10, 413 S.E.2d 19, 26 (1992).Â  Legislation\r\n  enacted by the countryâ€™s legislatures is the â€œclearest and most reliable\r\n  objective evidence of contemporary values.â€Â  Pittman, 373 S.C. at 563,\r\n  647 S.E.2d at 162.Â  â€œ[T]he Constitution requires the courtâ€™s own judgment to be\r\n  brought to bear on the issue by â€˜asking whether there is reason to disagree\r\n  with the judgment reached by the citizenry and its legislators.â€™â€Â  Id. at 563, 647 S.E.2d at 163 (quoting Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 313 (2002)).Â  It is not the burden of the state to establish a national consensus\r\n  approving what their citizens have voted to do; rather, it is the heavy burden\r\n  of the defendant to establish a national consensus against it. Â Wilson, 306 S.C. at 510, 413 S.E.2d at 26.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the â€œâ€˜proportionalityâ€™ bedrock of Eighth Amendment jurisprudenceâ€ is equally important\r\n  a principle as the â€œevolving standards of decency,â€ and â€œâ€˜it is a precept of\r\n  justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the]\r\n  offense.â€™â€Â  Pittman, 373 S.C. at 564-65, 647 S.E.2d at 163 (quoting Atkins,\r\n  536 U.S. at 311).Â  In order to establish that evolving standards of decency\r\n  preclude his punishment, appellant bears the â€œâ€˜heavy burdenâ€™ of showing that our\r\n  culture and laws emphatically and well nigh universally reject it.â€Â  Id. at 565, 647 S.E.2d at 164 (quoting Harris v. Wright, 93 F.3d 581, 583\r\n  (1996)).\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Standard, 351 S.C. 199, 569 S.E.2d 325 (2002), our supreme court found,\r\n  based upon sentences imposed in other cases, that lengthy sentences or\r\n  sentences of life without parole imposed upon juveniles do not violate\r\n  contemporary standards of decency so as to constitute cruel and unusual\r\n  punishment, and that an enhanced sentence based upon a prior â€œmost seriousâ€\r\n  conviction for a crime which was committed as a juvenile does not offend\r\n  evolving standards of decency so as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Id. Â at 205-06, 569 S.E.2d at 329.Â  Accordingly, Standardâ€™s sentence\r\n  of LWOP based on a previous â€œmost seriousâ€ armed robbery conviction when he was\r\n  seventeen and his subsequent â€œmost seriousâ€ conviction of burglary in the first\r\n  degree did not violate the Eighth Amendment.\r\nOur\r\n  courts have also determined stiff penalties for drug crimes do not violate the\r\n  constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.Â Â  SeeÂ  State\r\n    v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 172, 399 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1991) (holding sentence\r\n  of 25 years without parole upon conviction of trafficking in cocaine was not\r\n  cruel and unusual punishment); State v. Kiser, 288 S.C. 441, 443-44, 343\r\n  S.E.2d 292, 293 (1986) (holding mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in\r\n  prison for trafficking in marijuana was not grossly out of proportion with\r\n  severity of crime and, therefore, complied with cruel and unusual punishment\r\n  clause).Â  Additionally, in considering the implications of drugs on our society\r\n  today, the United States Supreme Court has noted as follows:\r\n\r\n  Possession, use, and distribution of illegal drugs represent â€œone\r\n    of the greatest problems affecting the health and welfare of our population.â€ Petitionerâ€™s suggestion that his\r\n    crime was nonviolent and victimless, echoed by the dissent, is false to the\r\n    point of absurdity. To the contrary, petitionerâ€™s crime threatened to cause\r\n    grave harm to society.\r\n  Quite apart from the pernicious effects on\r\n    the individual who consumes illegal drugs, such drugs relate to crime in at\r\n    least three ways: (1) A drug user may commit crime because of drug-induced\r\n    changes in physiological functions, cognitive ability, and mood; (2) A drug\r\n    user may commit crime in order to obtain money to buy drugs; and (3) A violent\r\n    crime may occur as part of the drug business or culture. Â Studies bear out\r\n    these possibilities and demonstrate a direct nexus between illegal drugs and\r\n    crimes of violence.\r\n\r\nHarmelin v.\r\n  Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 1002-03 (1991) (citations omitted).Â  Finally, the United States Supreme Court has\r\n  also held a state is justified in punishing a recidivist more severely than it\r\n  does a first offender.Â  Riggs v. California, 119 S.Ct. 890, 891 (1999).Â  Under\r\n  recidivist sentencing schemes, the enhanced punishment imposed for a present\r\n  offense is not to be viewed as an additional penalty for the earlier crimes,\r\n  but instead as a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to\r\n  be an aggravated offense because it is a repetitive one.Â  Id. \r\nIn\r\n  light of our courtâ€™s decisions in finding sentences of LWOP imposed upon\r\n  juveniles do not violate contemporary standards of decency so as to constitute\r\n  cruel and unusual punishment and that an enhanced sentence based upon a prior â€œmost\r\n  seriousâ€ conviction for a crime which was committed as a juvenile does not\r\n  offend evolving standards of decency so as to constitute cruel and unusual\r\n  punishment, that stiff penalties for drug crimes do not violate the\r\n  constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and in\r\n  consideration of the implications of drugs on our society today as noted by the\r\n  United States Supreme Court in Harmelin,\r\n  combined with the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s determination that a State is\r\n  justified in punishing a recidivist more severely than it does a first\r\n  offender, we find Williams has failed to\r\n  meet his burden of establishing evolving standards of decency preclude his\r\n  punishment, or that his sentence is disproportionate to the crime. Â \r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, Williamsâ€™ convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We note our review of the video exhibit supports\r\n  the officersâ€™ testimony.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4448","title":"State v.

Â The trial court sentenced Mattison to life\r\n  imprisonment without parole on the murder charge, one year consecutive on the\r\n  weapon charge, and twenty years concurrent on the ABIK charge.Â  Mattison\r\n  appeals, asserting the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that\r\n  prior knowledge a crime was to be committed is insufficient to establish guilt\r\n  and that mere association with a person who commits a crime is insufficient to\r\n  establish guilt.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case involves the shooting injury of\r\n  Jose Garcia and shooting deaths of his brother, Roberto Garcia, and their\r\n  cousin, Jorge Lemus.Â  The State set forth the theory that in August 2003,\r\n  Mattison schemed with Britney Ervin to lure Jose, Roberto, and Jorge to a\r\n  remote location to murder them and steal an automobile.Â  Evidence presented at\r\n  trial through direct testimony and statements given to the police included\r\n  differing versions of what occurred that day.\r\nJose testified that on the morning of August 23, 2003, his cousin\r\n  Jorge awoke him and told him someone wanted to buy Joseâ€™s Chevy Impala car.Â \r\n  Thereafter, a black, skinny man, whom Jose later identified as Ervin, came to\r\n  his home and Jose told him the amount of money he wanted for the car.Â  Ervin\r\n  left, and came back five to ten minutes later requesting to test drive the car. Â Jose and Ervin left in the car, and as they approached a corner, Jose\r\n  saw Mattison wave at them, but they did not pick up Mattison at that time.Â \r\n  Jose and Ervin then returned to Joseâ€™s home, and then Ervin left.Â  About five\r\n  minutes later, Ervin returned, wanting to make a deal.Â  He indicated he had to\r\n  go to his grandfatherâ€™s house to get money.Â  Jose and Ervin drove off to get\r\n  the money, and Roberto and Jorge followed them in a Honda Passport automobile\r\n  in order to bring Jose back home after he sold the car.Â  As they drove they saw\r\n  Mattison at the same location as before, and Jose and Ervin stopped and picked up\r\n  Mattison.Â  Mattison and Ervin talked and appeared to know each other.Â  They\r\n  directed Jose down a dirt road, and although he hesitated to drive down it, he\r\n  did so at the forceful insistence of Ervin.Â Â Â Â  \r\nMattison\r\n  and Ervin exited the car and walked around the house.Â  They were gone about ten\r\n  minutes.Â  Mattison returned to the car and began talking to Jose.Â  Mattison\r\n  told Jose he did not want to go back around the house because Ervinâ€™s\r\n  grandfather did not like him.Â  After waiting approximately fifteen minutes,\r\n  Jose was about to leave, but Ervin came back from around the house and told\r\n  Jose his grandfather was going to give him the money.Â  Ervin said he needed\r\n  help with a tire, and Roberto went around the house with Ervin to assist him.Â \r\n  Jorge exited the Honda and approached Jose to ask what was happening.Â  Jose\r\n  then heard a gunshot.Â  Jose and Mattison exited the Impala.Â  Mattison told Jose\r\n  that Ervinâ€™s grandfather was crazy and he was shooting.Â  Jose, Jorge and\r\n  Mattison then went around the house, where Jose observed Ervin with a gun in\r\n  his hand, coming toward the three men.Â  When Jorge saw Ervin with the gun, he\r\n  ran.Â  As Ervin chased Jorge, Mattison told Jose not to worry because he had a\r\n  gun too, and he was going to help them.Â  Mattison then pulled out a handgun.Â \r\n  Ervin caught Jorge and brought him back.Â  The four then continued toward the\r\n  back of the house, with Jose and Jorge in front followed by Ervin and then\r\n  Mattison.Â  As they approached a building behind the house, Jose asked where his\r\n  brother was.Â  Ervin put a gun to Joseâ€™s head and told him to keep walking.Â  \r\nAs they reached the corner, Jose heard his brother moaning and\r\n  then saw him face down on the ground.Â  Jose told Mattison and Ervin to just\r\n  take the cars and let him get his brother to a hospital.Â  Ervin then pointed\r\n  the gun at Jose.Â  As Ervin raised the gun to shoot Jose, Jorge jumped on top of\r\n  Ervin and Jose then jumped in, and a struggle ensued over Ervinâ€™s gun.Â  Jose\r\n  looked up and saw Mattison standing in the same corner as before with his gun\r\n  in his hands.Â  During the struggle over the gun with Ervin it fired, but did\r\n  not hit Jose.Â  Ervin was trying to shoot Jose, and Ervin told Mattison, more\r\n  than once, to shoot Jose.Â  Jose then heard a gunshot from Mattisonâ€™s direction\r\n  and felt his shirt fly.Â  He turned and looked at Mattison, and saw him run.Â \r\n  Jose noticed Jorge was getting weaker and saw him fall to the ground.Â  After\r\n  Ervin saw Mattison run away, he asked Jose to let go of the gun and stated he\r\n  would do the same.Â  Jose did not, but eventually obtained control over the gun\r\n  and Ervin then ran.Â  As Jose left to seek help, he noticed both the Chevy and\r\n  the Honda were gone.\r\nJose suffered a bullet graze injury to his shoulder during the\r\n  struggle.Â  Roberto and Jorge were transported to the hospital where both were\r\n  eventually pronounced dead.Â  Roberto died from a gunshot wound to the abdomen\r\n  and another to the pelvis.Â  Jorge died from a gunshot wound to the head.Â  The\r\n  two bullets recovered from Roberto were fired from the caliber nine millimeter\r\n  Luger gun that Jose had taken from Ervin in the struggle.Â  The bullet recovered\r\n  from Jorge was a thirty-two caliber, fired from a different gun which was never\r\n  found by the authorities.\r\nJose\r\n  gave a statement to police describing his assailants as a fat guy and a skinny\r\n  guy.Â  He identified Ervin, the one he described as skinny, from a photographic\r\n  line-up after Ervin was arrested driving Joseâ€™s Chevy Impala.Â  Jose made an\r\n  in-court identification of Mattison as the other man who rode in the back of\r\n  his car and ultimately shot in his direction.Â  When asked if, seeing Mattison\r\n  in the court room he would describe him as â€œthe fat guy,â€ Jose stated he would,\r\n  noting that he had been wearing a loose shirt and that is why he described him\r\n  as fat.\r\nAfter his arrest, Ervin gave two statements to the authorities.Â \r\n  In his first, Ervin claimed Mattison asked him to help set up some Mexicans so\r\n  he could rob them for their drugs.Â  He claimed Mattison told him to act like he\r\n  wanted to purchase their car, and threatened Ervin to get his cooperation.Â \r\n  Ervin claimed after he directed them to his grandfatherâ€™s shop, Mattison told\r\n  him to go to the back with him.Â  There, Mattison pointed a twenty-two caliber\r\n  pistol at Ervin and told him to get the Mexicans.Â  Mattison gave Ervin a nine\r\n  millimeter gun to use.Â  Mattison told Ervin to shoot the Mexicans, but he\r\n  refused.Â  Mattison took the nine millimeter gun from Ervin and shot the\r\n  Mexicans.Â  When Mattison started firing, Ervin ran.Â  Ervinâ€™s second statement\r\n  indicated it was given to correct his first statement as to â€œhow the shooting\r\n  went down.â€Â  There, Ervin stated that Mattison stayed with two of the Mexicans\r\n  at the car while he walked to the shop with a short Mexican.Â  Ervin pulled out\r\n  the nine millimeter gun, the Mexican tried to run, and he then shot him in the\r\n  chest.Â  Ervin then walked up to him and shot him in the neck.Â  He did this\r\n  because Mattison had told him the Mexicans had drugs in the house, and Mattison\r\n  planned to kill them to steal the drugs.Â  As Ervin walked back to the others,\r\n  Mattison had the twenty-two caliber gun pulled on the Mexicans.Â  Ervin pointed\r\n  the nine millimeter at them and directed them to the back of the shop where he\r\n  planned to kill them.Â  One of them saw the man Ervin had shot and began\r\n  fighting Ervin.Â  The other one struggled with Ervin over the gun and the gun\r\n  discharged.Â  When that happened, Mattison fired his gun.Â  One of the Mexicans\r\n  got control over Ervinâ€™s pistol and Ervin ran.\r\nAt trial, Ervin denied telling the authorities much of what was in\r\n  his two statements.Â  He also gave a different version of events, claiming that\r\n  Mattison brought some Mexicans to his home that day to see if Ervin wanted to\r\n  buy a car.Â  Ervin agreed to buy it, but it had a dent in the trunk and Mattison\r\n  told him he knew where he could find another trunk.Â  Ervin, Mattison, and one\r\n  of the Mexicans then followed behind two other Mexicans in the Honda to Ervinâ€™s\r\n  grandfatherâ€™s property.Â  According to Ervinâ€™s trial testimony, Mattison asked\r\n  Ervin to help him rob the Mexicans.Â  Mattison then took one of the Mexicans\r\n  with him to the back of the shop.Â  Ervin heard some gun shots, and the other\r\n  Mexicans ran up to him and asked what was happening.Â  Ervin told them he did\r\n  not know.Â  Mattison ran back to the front, and Ervin then jumped in the Chevy\r\n  and left.\r\nMattison did not testify at his trial.Â  A statement Mattison made\r\n  was, however, read into the record.Â  Mattison claimed in his statement that\r\n  Ervin brought a Mexican to his house trying to buy Mattisonâ€™s car in exchange\r\n  for drugs.Â  Mattison stated he wanted money, not drugs.Â  Ervin indicated they\r\n  would have to get the money from Ervinâ€™s grandfather.Â  Mattison rode with Ervin\r\n  and the Mexican in a black car while a short, black man named Chuck or Bud\r\n  followed in a gray car with two other Mexicans.Â  Ervin and the Mexican exited\r\n  the car and went around the house, while the Mexicans from the gray car were\r\n  with Mattison and Chuck remained in the gray car.Â  Mattison heard a â€œpop, pop,â€\r\n  and said â€œletâ€™s go,â€ but the Mexican refused because of his brother.Â  They then\r\n  ran to the back of the house.Â  Mattison heard â€œpop, popâ€ again, and he then\r\n  took off running the other way.Â  As he ran up the driveway, he saw Ervin drive\r\n  off in the black car.\r\nAfter\r\n  the State rested, the trial court granted Mattisonâ€™s directed verdict motions\r\n  on the charge of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent\r\n  crime as related to the murder of Roberto, as well as on the charge of grand\r\n  larceny of the Honda Passport.Â  At the close of the evidence, Mattison handed\r\n  the court his requests to charge.Â  The trial court indicated it would cover the\r\n  requests, but not exactly the way Mattison had asked.Â  When asked whether the\r\n  charge would include â€œprior knowledge is not sufficient, mere association,â€ the\r\n  court indicated it would not charge that. Â Counsel took exception to the\r\n  courtâ€™s refusal to so charge.Â  The jury found Mattison guilty of the murder of\r\n  Jorge and possession of a weapon during the commission of violent crime as\r\n  related to Jorge, as well as the assault and battery with intent to kill Jose.Â \r\n  On the charge of the murder of Roberto, the jury was unable to reach a verdict,\r\n  and the trial court declared a mistrial.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMattison contends\r\n  the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on prior knowledge and\r\n  mere association.Â  He asserts he was entitled to a charge that prior knowledge\r\n  a crime is going to be committed, without more, is insufficient to establish\r\n  guilt.Â  He maintains there is evidence of record from Jose that Mattison was\r\n  with him at the car when the shooting began and that Mattison wanted to leave\r\n  immediately, but Jose was concerned about his brother.Â  Further, according to\r\n  Mattisonâ€™s statement, upon hearing the shots, he â€œtook off running the other\r\n  way.â€Â  Mattison contends it was important for the jury to understand that if it\r\n  found Mattison was present at the scene, that his knowledge Ervin was going to\r\n  commit a crime, without more, was insufficient to make him guilty of those\r\n  crimes.Â  He further asserts it was important for the jury to understand that\r\n  mere association with the perpetrator of the crime is also insufficient to\r\n  prove guilt.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State\r\n    v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  Generally, a\r\n  trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. Â Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472 (2004).Â \r\n  A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when\r\n  read as a whole. Â Id.Â  A trial court has a duty to give a requested\r\n  instruction that is supported by the evidence and correctly states the law\r\n  applicable to the issues. Â State v. Peer, 320 S.C. 546, 553, 466 S.E.2d\r\n  375, 380 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A trial court commits reversible error if it fails\r\n  to give a requested charge on an issue raised by the evidence.Â  State v.\r\n    Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993). Â A trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision regarding jury charges will not be reversed where the charges, as a\r\n  whole, properly charged the law to be applied.Â  State v. Rye, 375 S.C.\r\n  119, 123, 651 S.E.2d 321, 323 (2007).\r\nMere\r\n  association with admitted members of a conspiracy is insufficient to tie other\r\n  persons to the conspiracy. Â State v. Barroso, 328 S.C. 268, 272, 493\r\n  S.E.2d 854, 856 (1997). Â Additionally, â€œ[m]ere presence and prior knowledge\r\n  that a crime was going to be committed, without more, is insufficient to\r\n  constitute guilt.â€Â  State v. Thompson, 374 S.C. 257, 262, 647 S.E.2d\r\n  702, 705 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  â€œHowever, â€˜presence at the scene of a crime by\r\n  pre-arrangement to aid, encourage, or abet in the perpetration of the crime\r\n  constitutes guilt as a [principal].â€™â€Â  Id. Â Â \r\nMattison\r\n  points to the Thompson case for the proposition that prior knowledge\r\n  that a crime is going to be committed, without more, is insufficient to\r\n  constitute guilt.Â  However, the issue in Thompson was not whether the\r\n  court failed to properly charge the jury, but whether Thompson was entitled to\r\n  a directed verdict because the State failed to present any direct or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence to show that Thompson was guilty of first\r\n  degree burglary or attempted armed robbery, either as a principal or as an\r\n  accomplice.Â  Further, this court noted in Thompson that while mere\r\n  presence and prior knowledge, without more, are insufficient to establish\r\n  guilt, presence at the scene of a crime by pre-arrangement to aid, encourage,\r\n  or abet in the perpetration of the crime will constitute guilt as a principal.Â  Thompson, 374 S.C. at 262, 647 S.E.2d at 705.Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998), our supreme court held a\r\n  charge to be sufficient, though the trial court failed to charge mere association.Â \r\n  The court ruled that the trial courtâ€™s charge was not misleading, it clearly\r\n  explained the prosecution had to prove every element of the crime such that\r\n  mere presence was not enough to sustain a conviction, and the trial judge\r\n  extensively instructed the jury on the requisite criminal intent for each of\r\n  the charged crimes.Â  Id. at 77, 502 S.E.2d at 76-77.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the record shows the trial court charged the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n  Ladies\r\n    and Gentlemen, a principal in a crime is one who either in person perpetrates\r\n    the crime or who being present aides and abets and assists the commission of that\r\n    crime.Â  I charge you, Ladies and Gentlemen, that mere presence at the scene of\r\n    a crime is not sufficient to convict.\r\n  However,\r\n    when one does an act in the presence of or with the assistance of another, the\r\n    act is done by both.Â  Where two or more acted with a common design or intent is\r\n    present at the commission of a crime, it does not matter by who (sic) the crime\r\n    is committed, for all are guilty.\r\n  Intent,\r\n    however, Ladies and Gentlemen, is a necessary element of the offense.Â  There\r\n    must have been a common design or attempt to commit the crime.Â  The crime must\r\n    have been committed pursuant to the person aiding and abetting by some overt\r\n    act.Â  Now, presence at the commission of a crime means to be sufficiently near\r\n    so as to be able to aid and abet in its commission.\r\n  Stated\r\n    somewhat differently, Ladies and Gentlemen, is several, two or more persons\r\n    pursuit (sic) to a common design to commit an unlawful act, set out together\r\n    and each takes a part agreed upon or assigned to him to commit the act or which\r\n    to watch at a proper distance at stations to prevent an appearance or surprise\r\n    or to encourage the commission of unlawful act or to assist, if necessary,\r\n    escape of those immediately engaged in the commission of the unlawful act,\r\n    under any or all of these circumstances, if the unlawful act is committed, the\r\n    act is one, the act of one is the act of all and all would be guilty.\r\n  In other\r\n    words, if several persons agree or conspire to commit a crime, each of those\r\n    persons are criminally responsible for the acts of his confederates of which\r\n    are done in the presence of the common purpose for which they combined.Â  The\r\n    common purpose may have not included or involved killing anyone.\r\n  But if\r\n    in executing the common design and purpose, a common homicide is committed by\r\n    one of the confederates and you, the jury, determine from all the evidence\r\n    beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide was a probable and natural\r\n    consequence of the acts which was done in pursuit to the common design, then\r\n    Ladies and Gentlemen, all who are present either actually or constructively and\r\n    participated in the unlawful common design would be guilty.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  charge to the jury included a detailed instruction on aiding, abetting, and\r\n  assisting in the commission of a crime through some overt act, and clearly indicated that mere presence alone was\r\n  insufficient to sustain a conviction.Â  The charge noted that there must be a\r\n  common design to commit an unlawful act, and that one present must aid, abet or\r\n  assist in the commission of that crime in order to be found guilty. Â It\r\n  explained the prosecution had to prove every element of the crime such that\r\n  mere presence was not enough to sustain a conviction.Â  Implicit in the charge\r\n  given to the jury was that mere knowledge a crime was going to occur, or mere\r\n  association with one who commits a crime is insufficient to constitute guilt,\r\n  but that Mattison must have, while present at the commission of the crime,\r\n  aided, abetted, or assisted in the commission of the crime pursuant to a common\r\n  design or purpose before a conviction could be had.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s jury charge on the whole was proper.\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s charge to the\r\n  jury.Â  Mattisonâ€™s convictions are therefore\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4449","title":"Sloan v.

Carpenter,\r\n          of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:Â \r\n  Greenville County appeals the trial courtâ€™s order striking down a portion of\r\n  the previous county procurement code for being inconsistent with Section\r\n  11-35-50 of the South Carolina Code (2007).Â  We vacate the trial courtâ€™s order\r\nand dismiss this case as moot.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe relevant facts of this case are largely undisputed.Â  The\r\n  trial court consolidated four cases by Edward A. Sloan (Sloan) challenging\r\n  procurements made by Greenville County (County) between August 2002 and March\r\n  2004, which utilized the competitive sealed proposal (Proposal) procurement\r\n  method rather than the competitive sealed bidding (Bidding) method.Â  The\r\n  gravamen of Sloanâ€™s action was to declare sections of the former Greenville County\r\n  Procurement Code (GCPC) unlawful for allowing the determination to use\r\n  Proposals as an alternative to the preferred procurement method of Bidding\r\n  without memorializing or justifying the decision in writing, regardless of\r\nwhether the GCPC includes such a writing requirement.Â  \r\nThe previous GCPC provided in part as follows:\r\nÂ§ 7-304 Methods of\r\nSource Selection.\r\nUnless\r\n  otherwise required by law, all County contracts shall be awarded by competitive\r\n  sealed bidding, pursuant to Â§ 7-305 (Competitive Sealed Bidding), except as\r\nprovided herein:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (2)\r\nSection 7-307 (Competitive Sealed Proposals).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nÂ§ 7-305 Competitive\r\nSealed Bidding.\r\n\r\n  (1) Conditions\r\n    for Use.Â  Contracts amounting to $25,000 or more shall be awarded by\r\n    competitive bidding except as otherwise provided in Â§ 7-304 (Methods of Source\r\n    Selection).\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nÂ§ 7-307 Competitive\r\nSealed Proposals.\r\n\r\n  (1) Conditions\r\n    for use. When the Purchasing Manager determines that the use of competitive\r\n    sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the County, a\r\n    contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposals method.\r\n\r\nUnlike the South Carolina Procurement Code or the South Carolina Local\r\n  Model Procurement Code, the GCPC did not require the procurement officerâ€™s\r\ndetermination to use Proposals rather than Bidding to be in writing.\r\n\r\n  Section 11-35-50 of the South Carolina Code (2007) states in\r\n    part as follows:\r\n  Political\r\n    subdivisions required to develop and adopt procurement laws. \r\n  All\r\n    political subdivisions of the State shall adopt ordinances or procedures\r\n    embodying sound principles of appropriately competitive procurement no later\r\n    than July 1, 1983.Â  The Budget and Control Board, in cooperation with the\r\n    Procurement Policy Committee and subdivisions concerned, shall create a task\r\n    force to draft model ordinances, regulations, and manuals for consideration by\r\n    the political subdivisions . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-50 (2007).\r\nOn November 18, 2004, the parties stipulated to\r\nconsolidation of all four claims to be decided on the following two issues:\r\n\r\n  (1)Â Â Â Â  Whether the Countyâ€™s Procurement Code requires a written determination\r\n    in order for the County to use the [Proposal] procurement method, and\r\n    by extension, whether the lack of a written determination for these\r\n    projects in which the County used the [Proposal] method violated the\r\n    Countyâ€™s procurement Code; and \r\n  (2)Â Â Â Â  If the Countyâ€™s Procurement Code does not require a written determination\r\n    in order to use the [Proposal] procurement method, does it violate State\r\n    law, and in particular, South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 11- 35-50?\r\n\r\nAfter the trial court hearing on December 3, 2004, but before\r\n  the order was issued on January 8, 2007, the County amended the GCPC on October\r\n  17, 2006.Â  The new GCPC section titled â€œMethods of Source Selectionâ€ now reads\r\nin part as follows:\r\n\r\n  Unless\r\n    otherwise required by law, all County contracts amounting to $25,000 or more\r\n    shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding, pursuant to&nbsp;Â§ 3-202\r\n    (Competitive Sealed Bidding), or by competitive sealed proposals, pursuant\r\n    to&nbsp;Â§ 3-204 (Competitive Sealed Proposals), whichever is determined to be\r\n    more advantageous to the County . . . .\r\n\r\nAs such, the amended GCPC differs from the previous version because,\r\n  among other things, it now has two equally preferred methods of procurement for\r\nsource selection, Bidding and Proposals.\r\nOn January 8, 2007, the trial court found that the claims\r\n  were moot on the basis that all of the contracts involved were either completed\r\n  or cancelled; however, citing the public interest exception to the mootness\r\n  doctrine, the trial court proceeded to rule on whether the former GCPC embodied\r\n  sound principles of appropriately competitive procurement by not requiring a\r\n  determination to be in writing before using the Proposal method rather than the\r\n  preferred method of Bidding.Â  The court concluded that the former version of\r\n  the GCPC did not â€œembody sound principles of appropriately competitiveâ€\r\n  procurement because it failed to require a determination in writing before the\r\n  use of Proposals rather than the preferred method of Bidding.Â  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the Greenville County Procurement Code violate Â§ 11-35-50\r\n    when the GCPCâ€™s sealed proposal method of procurement set forth a procedure\r\n    that even the plaintiff acknowledged was appropriately competitive, but\r\n    did not require a written determination to document why this method was\r\n    chosen?\r\n  II.Â Â Â Â Â  Whether the trial court was correct to decide the issue above\r\n    â€œfor future  guidanceâ€ under the public importance exception to mootness, when Â  the\r\n    preference for sealed bids that necessarily forms the basis of the Â  written\r\n    determination requirement no longer exists?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor\r\n  equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€ Doe v.\r\n    South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 347 S.C.\r\n  642, 645, 557 S.E.2d 670, 672 (2001) (internal citation omitted).Â  To make this\r\n  determination, an appellate court must look to the essential character of the\r\n  cause of action.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C.\r\n  140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000). The character of the action is\r\n  generally ascertained from the body of the complaint, but when necessary, resort\r\n  may also be had to the prayer for relief and any other facts and circumstances\r\n  which throw light upon the main purpose of the action.Â  Low Country Open Land\r\n    Trust v. Charleston S. Univ., 376 S.C. 399, 406, 656 S.E.2d 775, 779 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  The issue of statutory interpretation is a question of law for the\r\n  court. Â Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372 S.C. 519,\r\n  524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).Â  We are free to decide questions of law with\r\nno deference to the trial court.Â  Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWe first address the issue of mootness\r\nsince this issue necessarily affects our disposition of this case.\r\nThe court does not concern itself with moot or\r\n  speculative questions. Sloan v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No.\r\n  26534 (S.C. Filed Aug. 25, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 33 at 43). Â An\r\n  appellate court will not pass judgment on moot and academic questions; it will\r\n  not adjudicate a matter when no actual controversy capable of specific relief\r\n  exists. Â Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596\r\n  (2001).Â  A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical\r\n  legal effect upon the existing controversy.Â  Id.Â  Mootness also arises\r\n  when some event occurs making it impossible for the reviewing court to grant\r\neffectual relief.Â  Id.\r\nHowever, there are three exceptions to the mootness\r\n  doctrine.&nbsp; Id. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596.&nbsp; First, if the issue\r\n  raised is capable of repetition but generally will evade review, the appellate\r\n  court can take jurisdiction. &nbsp;Id.; see also Sloan v.\r\n    South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 365 S.C. 299, 303, 618 S.E.2d 876,\r\n  878&nbsp;(2005); Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d\r\n  861, 864 (1996).Â  â€œSecond, an appellate court may decide questions of\r\n  imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in\r\n  matters of important public interest.â€&nbsp; Curtis, 345 S.C. at 568,\r\n  549 S.E.2d at 596 (emphasis added).&nbsp; Application of the public interest\r\n  exception requires the question at issue to be (1) of â€œpublic importance,â€ and (2) of â€œimperative and manifest urgency.â€ Â See Sloan v. Greenville County,\r\n  361 S.C. 568, 570-71, 606 S.E.2d 464, 465-66 (2004).Â  Third, â€œif a decision by\r\n  the trial court may affect future events, or have collateral consequences for\r\n  the parties, an appeal from that decision is not moot, even though the\r\n  appellate court cannot give effective relief in the present case.â€&nbsp; Curtis,\r\n  345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596; accord Sloan, 365 S.C. at\r\n  303, 618 S.E.2d at 878.Â  The utilization of an exception under the mootness\r\n  doctrine is flexible and discretionary pursuant to South Carolina\r\n  jurisprudence, not a mechanical rule that is automatically invoked.[1]Â  Compare,\r\n    e.g., Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 553-55, 590 S.E.2d 338,\r\n350-51, with Sloan, 361 S.C. at 571-72, 606 S.E.2d at 468; cf. 1A C.J.S. Actions Â§78 (2008).\r\nNeither party has challenged the courtâ€™s\r\n  preliminary conclusion that these cases are moot since the contracts were\r\n  already completed or cancelled.[2]Â \r\n  Therefore that conclusion, right or wrong, is the law of the case. Â See Sloan,\r\n  365 S.C. at 307, 618 S.E.2d at 880 (â€œ[A]n unappealed ruling becomes the law of\r\n  the case, and the appellate court must assume the ruling was correct.â€)\r\n  (quoting Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Jones, 335 S.C. 295, 298-99, 516 S.E.2d\r\n  468, 470 (Ct. App. 1999)). Â Thus, the next question before us is whether this\r\n  case is suitable for discretionary review of the issue presented under the\r\npublic interest exception to the mootness doctrine.[3]\r\nCounty contends that since the GCPC no longer contains\r\n  the preference for sealed bids that necessarily formed the basis of the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s order, the trial court erred in determining that the case should be\r\ndecided under the public interest exception to mootness.Â  We agree.\r\nThe trial court found the case moot for the initial\r\n  reason that the contracts at issue had already been performed or cancelled; it\r\n  then found the public interest exception applied to that point of mootness.Â  However,\r\n  the court did not fully address the public interest exception of the mootness\r\n  doctrine to the suit after the change in the GCPC was brought to its attention;\r\n  specifically, the trial court failed to address whether the suit remained one\r\n  of â€œimperative and manifest urgencyâ€ after passage of the amended ordinance. Â See Sloan v. Friends of the Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 27, 630 S.E.2d 474,\r\n  478 (2006) (â€œ[T]he issue must present a question of imperative and manifest\r\n  urgency requiring the establishment of a rule for future guidance in â€˜matters\r\n  of important public interest.â€™Â  This evaluation must be made based on the facts\r\n  of each individual situation.â€) (internal citation omitted). Â Here, after\r\n  opining in a footnote that its analysis of the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception would\r\n  not change due to passage of the amended ordinance, the trial court â€œ[found] it\r\n  necessary to go ahead and rule on the issue of whether such a determination\r\n  must be in writing under the former version of the code.â€ (emphasis\r\n  added). Â Therefore, the second prong of the public interest exception was never\r\n  satisfied; the trial court failed to consider the impact of the amended\r\n  ordinance on the suit through the lens of â€œimperative and manifest urgency,â€\r\n  and erred in utilizing that exception to review the issue presented under the\r\nprevious ordinance.[4]\r\nSloan also argues there is an imperative and manifest\r\n  urgency compelling this court to find Â§ 11-35-50 requires a written\r\n  determination whenever a political subdivision selects the Proposal method over\r\n  Bidding, regardless of whether the political subdivision designates the two\r\n  methods as equally preferable, in order for the procurement to be\r\n  â€œappropriately competitive.â€Â  As previously indicated, although the trial court\r\n  briefly acknowledged this supplementary argument in a footnote of its opinion,\r\n  it specifically refused to rule upon the issue in regard to the amended version\r\n  of the GCPC. Â We find the record before us insufficiently developed to exercise\r\n  our discretion under a mootness exception to address Sloanâ€™s ancillary argument\r\n  regarding co-preferred methods of procurement. Â Moreover, we take judicial\r\n  notice of our own docket and note that this very issue is currently on appeal\r\n  in Sloan v. Greenville Hospital System, et al., Case Nos. 03-CP-23-3785,\r\n  04-CP-23-5223, and 05-CP-23-0586 (appeal filed June 12, 2008).Â  Sloan\r\n  acknowledges this fact in his appellate brief.Â  In that case, one of the main issues\r\n  litigated and ruled upon was whether a written determination is required\r\n  to select Proposals over Bidding when both are co-preferred procurement\r\n  methods; as such, that case, as opposed to this case, is arguably more suitable\r\nfor review and adjudication of the issue. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nDue to the significant change in the ordinance, we\r\n  find it unnecessary to decide the issue presented to the trial court of whether\r\n  the Countyâ€™s former procurement code was valid; passing judgment upon this\r\n  matter would only result in an advisory opinion on the application of an\r\n  obsolete procurement ordinance to completed or cancelled contracts. Â We also\r\n  decline to address Sloanâ€™s alternate argument under the amended ordinance since\r\nthe trial court never addressed the effect of the amended ordinance.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is vacated and\r\nthe case is dismissed as moot. \r\nVACATED AND DISMISSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Sloan conceded at oral argument that application of\r\n  an exception to the mootness doctrine is discretionary rather than mandatory by\r\nan appellate court.\r\n[2] Both parties agree in their briefs that the four\r\ncases at issue were moot at the time of the final hearing. \r\n[3] The public interest exception was the only exception\r\nasserted to the trial court.\r\n[4] Additionally, we note this court has provided some\r\n  judicial guidance as to the meaning of Â§ 11-35-50 in Glasscock Co. v. Sumter\r\n    County, 361 S.C. 483, 604 S.E.2d 718 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Id. at 490,\r\n  604 S.E.2d at 721 (stating Â§ 11-35-50 does not mandate or require local\r\n  governments to adopt specific methods of procurement or the process by which to\r\n  apply them, and that it â€œclearly was intended to afford local governments\r\n  needed flexibility to determine what is â€˜appropriately competitiveâ€™ in light of\r\n  the public business they must transact.â€); see also Sloan, 361\r\n  S.C. at 571-72, 606 S.E.2d at 466 (holding there is no imperative or manifest\r\n  urgency in obtaining an advisory opinion on the application of an obsolete\r\n  procurement ordinance to completed projects when the ordinance was subsequently\r\n  altered addressing the existing controversy, and when judicial guidance on the\r\n  matter already exists).Â  Because this finding is not dispositive of our\r\ndecision herein, we need not reach this issue.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4450","title":"S.C.

Â§ 44-1-60(E) clearly provides the exclusive mechanism for review\r\n    under the facts and circumstances presented in this case.Â  The fifteen-day time\r\n    period within which to file a request for final review begins upon mailing the\r\n    notice of the staff decision to the applicant.Â  It is undisputed that the\r\n    League failed to file a request for final review with the Board within the\r\n    statutory time frame.Â  The arguments offered by the League to excuse this\r\n    failure to timely file are unavailing.Â  Therefore, this Court lacks\r\n    jurisdiction over this matter, and this case must be dismissed.Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing the\r\n  issuance of the order, Coastal filed a motion for reconsideration with the ALC\r\n  on September 18, 2007.Â  The motion was denied as untimely.Â  Coastal filed a\r\n  second motion for reconsideration requesting a review of the original ALC order\r\n  and the first order for reconsideration.Â  On October 1, 2007, Coastal filed a\r\n  notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals.Â  Based on the pending appeal, the\r\n  ALC issued an order declining to rule on the second motion for reconsideration\r\n  and to make any additional rulings on the controversy.Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â  Did Coastalâ€™s\r\n  dual requests for final review before the DHEC Board, which were not filed\r\n  within fifteen days from the date notice was mailed to the permit applicants,\r\n  prevent the Administrative Law Court from conducting a contested case hearing\r\n  on the matter?\r\n2.Â  Did principles\r\n  of waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling entitle Coastal to a contested case\r\n  hearing before the Administrative Law Court regardless of the timeliness of the\r\n  request for final review?\r\n3.Â  Did the Administrative Law Court deny Coastal due process rights through its application of Section\r\n  44-1-60?\r\n4.Â  Did the Administrative Law Court abuse its discretion by striking Coastalâ€™s Motion for\r\n  Reconsideration as untimely?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA) articulates the standard for judicial\r\n  review of cases decided by the ALC.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B)-(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2007); Olson v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 379\r\n  S.C. 57, Â Â Â Â Â , 663 S.E.2d 497, 500-501 (Ct. App. 2008) (â€œJudicial\r\n  review of the ALC judgeâ€™s order is governed by section 1-23-610(C) . . . .â€).Â \r\n  Section 1-23-610(C) of the South Carolina Code illuminates:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s order must be confined to the record.Â \r\n    The reviewing tribunal may affirm the decision or remand the case for further\r\n    proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights\r\n    of the petitioner has been prejudiced because of the finding, conclusion, or\r\n    decision is:Â  \r\n  (a) in\r\n    violation of constitutional or statutory provision; \r\n  (b) in\r\n    excess of the statutory authority of the agency; \r\n  (c)\r\n    made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n  (d)\r\n    affected by other error of law; \r\n  (e)\r\n    clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n    on the whole record; or \r\n  (f)\r\n    arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n    unwarranted exercise of discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.

App. 2007).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe essence of the controversy in the case at bar\r\n  revolves around the appellate process for administrative disputes.Â  Coastal\r\n  primarily alleges the ALC judge erred in finding Coastalâ€™s request for final\r\n  review before the DHEC Board to be untimely, precluding the ALC from hearing\r\n  the matter.Â  Before addressing the immediate imbroglio, we must examine the\r\n  administrative review process as prescribed by the Stateâ€™s legislature.Â  \r\nI.Â  Mandatory Review\r\n  Process Enacted by Act No. 387\r\nTo bestow panoramic\r\n  application of the law extant in regard to the mandated review process and to\r\n  edify and inculcate the cognoscenti of administrative law jurisprudence in South Carolina, we review with specificity the law enacted by the General Assembly of the State\r\n  in Act Number 387, effective July 1, 2006.Â  \r\nIn Section 53 of\r\n  the Act, the state legislature succinctly expressed the overriding purpose of\r\n  the law:Â  \r\n\r\n  This\r\n    act is intended to provide a uniform procedure for contested cases and appeals\r\n    from administrative agencies and to the extent that a provision of this act\r\n    conflicts with an existing statute or regulation, the provisions of this act\r\n    are controlling.Â  \r\n\r\nAct No. 387, Â§ 53, 2006 S.C.\r\n  Acts &amp; Joint Resolutions.Â  By enacting this legislation, the General\r\n  Assembly remodeled the appellate process for administrative agencies in the\r\n  state and amended several statutes addressing the direction and flow of\r\n  appeals.Â  \r\nUnder the new\r\n  appellate procedure, if a party wishes to challenge the issuance of a permit by\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, the\r\n  aggrieved party first must comply with the relief process established by the\r\n  Act and codified in Section 44-1-60 of the South Carolina Code.Â  When an\r\n  applicant applies for a permit with DHEC, the initial determination of whether\r\n  to issue or deny is a staff decision.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(C) (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  After the staff members involved reach a consensus, DHEC releases a department\r\n  decision either issuing or denying the permit.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(D) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  \r\nA party wishing to\r\n  challenge the department decision must file a written request for final review\r\n  before the Board of Health and Environmental Control within â€œfifteen days after\r\n  notice of the department decision has been mailed to the applicant[.]â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E) (Supp. 2007).Â  If a request for final review is not\r\n  made, the department decision becomes the final agency decision.Â  Id.Â  If a request is timely filed, the DHEC Board will either conduct a final review\r\n  conference within sixty days or allow the time period to elapse.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(F) (Supp. 2007).Â  If the time period expires without a hearing,\r\n  the department decision becomes the final agency decision.Â  Id.Â  If a\r\n  review conference is held, the conclusion reached by the DHEC Board becomes\r\n  final.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWithin thirty days\r\n  of the deadline for the final review conference if no hearing is conducted or\r\n  within thirty days after the receipt of the final agency decision, a party\r\n  wishing to further challenge the permit must file a request for a contested\r\n  case hearing with the ALC.Â  Id.Â  An ALC judge will hear the contested\r\n  case and issue a written order on the matter.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(A) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  \r\nâ€œA party who has\r\n  exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is\r\n  aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial\r\n  review.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A).Â  To initiate judicial review, the\r\n  appellant must file a notice of appeal within thirty days of the final decision\r\n  of the administrative agency.Â  Id.Â  A party appealing the final decision\r\n  of the ALC judge in cases involving DHEC is entitled to an appeal to the Court\r\n  of Appeals as a matter of right.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B).Â  If either\r\n  party wishes further review following a decision by the Court of Appeals,\r\n  contested administrative cases are subject to a petition for certiorari to the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-390 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nII.Â  Timeliness of\r\n  Coastalâ€™s Request for Final Review before the DHEC Board\r\nThe dispute between\r\n  Coastal, DHEC, the SPA, and the DOT centers on the proper interpretation of\r\n  Section 44-1-60.Â  Coastal avers the ALC judge committed reversible error by\r\n  finding the time period to file a review request with the DHEC Board runs from\r\n  the time the staff decision is mailed to the permit applicant.Â  Coastal argues the\r\n  fifteen-day limit does not begin to run until receipt of actual notice.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  In reaching our conclusion, we address three primary areas relating\r\n  to the controversy: (1) statutory interpretation of Section 44-1-60(E); (2)\r\n  notice and compliance with filing deadlines in regard to the SPA permit and the\r\n  DOT permit; and (3) the jurisdiction of both the DHEC Board and the ALC.Â  \r\nA.Â  Interpretation\r\n  of Section 44-1-60(E)\r\n\r\n  i.Â \r\n    Rules of Statutory Construction\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule\r\n  of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislatureâ€™s\r\n  intent.Â  Chem-Nuclear Sys., LLC v.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  language in Section 44-1-60(E) is clear and unambiguous, yielding only one\r\n  possible interpretation.Â  Under the phrasing of the statute, the following\r\n  parties are entitled to notice of the DHEC decision: (1) the applicant for the\r\n  permit; (2) the permittee; (3) the licensee; and (4) affected parties who\r\n  request notification of the decision.Â  After issuance of the staff\r\n  determination, appealing parties must file within â€œfifteen days after notice of\r\n  the department decision has been mailed to the applicant.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n44-1-60(E).\r\nThe\r\n  General Assemblyâ€™s intent in implementing this legislation is clear from the wording\r\n  of the Act itself: â€œto provide a uniform procedure for contested cases and appeals\r\n  from administrative agencies.â€Â  Act No. 387, Â§ 53, 2006 S.C. Acts &amp; Joint\r\n  Resolutions.Â  Luculently, the legislature intended to establish a homogenous\r\n  appeals process for administrative actions.Â  Furthermore, the terminology of\r\nthe statute is definite, incontrovertible, and irrefragable.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  legislature chose for the fifteen-day filing period to begin running from the\r\n  date the department decision was mailed to the applicant.Â  Additionally, in a\r\n  subsequent section of the same statute, the General Assembly instructs: â€œWithin\r\n  thirty days after the receipt of the decision an applicant, permittee,\r\n  licensee, or affected person desiring to contest the final agency decision may\r\n  request a contested case hearing . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(F)(2)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Incontrovertibly, the legislature was able to differentiate\r\n  the differences between a time period running from mailing of notice and from receipt\r\n  of notice.Â  The General Assembly elected for the pertinent time period in this\r\n  case to run from the date notice was mailed, and this Court cannot impose a\r\njudgment that would result in a discrepant result.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALC agreed with this interpretation.Â  The ALC judge, in the Order of Dismissal\r\nfor each of the permits, explicated:\r\n\r\n  S.C.\r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E) clearly provides the exclusive mechanism for review\r\n    under the facts and circumstances presented in this case.Â  The fifteen-day time\r\n    period within which to file a request for final review begins upon mailing the\r\n    notice of the staff decision to the applicant.\r\n\r\nCoastal\r\n  professes the time period for filing a review request properly runs from the\r\n  time notice is actually received.Â  Coastal primarily relies on the decision of\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court in Hamm v. South Carolina Public Service\r\nCommission, 287 S.C. 180, 336 S.E.2d 470 (1985), to support this conclusion.Â  \r\nIn Hamm, the key issue was whether a party timely filed for judicial\r\n  review under the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  The Public Service Commission\r\n  granted the South Carolina Electric and Gas Companyâ€™s application for increased\r\n  utility rates after conducting an agency hearing.Â  Hamm, 287 S.C. at\r\n  181, 336 S.E.2d at 471.Â  Steven Hamm, the State Consumer Advocate, filed a\r\n  petition for rehearing but was denied by the commission.Â  Id.Â  Notice of\r\n  the denial order was mailed to an individual no longer employed at Hammâ€™s office and the letter was misplaced.Â  Id.Â  Hamm did not receive actual\r\n  notice until several days later when he discovered the decision and obtained\r\n  written notice directly from the Public Service Commissionâ€™s office.Â  Id.Â    Hamm filed his appeal within thirty days of receiving written notice but not\r\n  within thirty days of the date of the agency decision as required by the\r\n  statute.Â  Id.Â  The Public Service Commission sought dismissal of the\r\n  appeal on the grounds it was not timely filed under the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act.Â  Id.Â  Under the relevant language of Section 1-23-380(b)\r\n  (Supp. 1984) (later amended by Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts &amp; Joint\r\n  Resolutions), an appeal must be commenced within thirty days after the agency decision\r\n  was reached.Â  Id.Â  In affirming the grant of appeal by the trial court,\r\nthe Supreme Court held:Â  \r\n\r\n  While\r\n    a literal reading of Section 1-23-380(b) suggests the thirty days to appeal\r\n    runs from the time the decision is made, we believe the statute must be read to\r\n    allow a party thirty days after notice of a decision to bring an\r\n    appeal.Â  \r\n  However\r\n    clear the language of a statute may be, the court will reject that meaning when\r\n    it leads to an absurd result not possibly intended by the legislature.Â  State,\r\n      ex rel. McLeod v. Montgomery, 244 S.C. 308, 136 S.E.2d 778 (1964).Â  If time\r\n    to appeal ran from the date a decision was actually made, an agency could\r\n    preclude judicial review in all cases simply by concealing its decision until\r\n    the thirty days had run.Â  Such a result could not have been intended by the\r\n    legislature.Â  We hold that under Section 1-23-380(b), a party has thirty days\r\n    after receiving written notice to appeal an agency decision.Â  \r\n\r\nHamm, 287 S.C. at 181, 336 S.E.2d at 471; see also Cox\r\n  v. County of Florence, 337 S.C. 340, 344, 523 S.E.2d 776, 778 (1999) (â€œIn Hamm [. . .], we construed this provision to allow a party thirty days after written\r\n    notice of a decision to bring an appeal, rather than [thirty] days after a\r\ndecision is made in which to file an appeal.â€ (emphasis in original)).Â  \r\n While Hamm protects against an ambiguity in a statute that could potentially allow an\r\n  agency to knowingly withhold notice of a decision in order to allow an\r\n  inequitable expiration of the filing period, the case at bar is\r\n  distinguishable.Â  The relevant statutes for each case are inherently different\r\n  in their construction.Â  Section 44-1-60(E) specifically creates a vehicle for\r\n  all interested parties to receive notice.Â  Affected parties can guard against\r\n  the dangers addressed in Hamm by requesting notification of the decision\r\n  from the agency itself.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E).Â  The statutory language\r\n  in Section 44-1-60(E) does not suffer from the same uncertainty affecting the statute\r\n  in Hamm and is therefore discernible.Â  Presumably, the General Assembly\r\n  was aware of the decision in Hamm and the effects of prior legislation\r\nwhen it drafted Section 44-1-60.Â  Hamm is not controlling in the case sub judice.Â  \r\nCoastalâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of the statute, along with the conclusion of the DHEC Board to hold\r\n  the final review hearing, is inconsonant with the common-sense reading of the\r\n  statute.Â  The ALC judgeâ€™s interpretation of Section 44-1-60(E) was correct and\r\n  consistent with the intent of the legislature.Â  This Court must harmonize the\r\n  expressed purpose of legislation and the clear and unambiguous terms employed\r\n  in the statute.Â  Applying Section 44-1-60(E), the time period for filing a\r\n  request for final review begins to run from the date the DHEC staff decision is\r\nmailed to the applicant, not from the date actual notice is received.Â  \r\n\r\n  iii.\r\n    Coastalâ€™s Compliance with Statutory Filing Deadlines\r\n\r\nApplying the apropos interpretation of Section\r\n  44-1-60(E), we examine whether Coastal met the filing requirements for review\r\n  before the DHEC Board.Â  After analyzing the facts as they relate to each of the\r\n  permit applications, we find Coastal did not meet the statutory filing\r\ndeadlines.Â  \r\nThe SPA permit\r\n  was issued and mailed to the applicant, the SPA, on October 31 and was revised\r\n  and re-mailed on November 2.Â  Coastal failed to request notification of the\r\n    staff decision as delineated in Section 44-1-60(E).Â  On November 20,\r\n  Coastal filed a request for review before the DHEC Board.Â  Coastal failed to\r\n  properly file an appeal within the fifteen-day filing period.Â  Concomitantly,\r\n  Coastal did not comply with statutory requirements and was not entitled to a\r\nhearing before the DHEC Board.Â  \r\nDHEC issued and\r\n  sent via certified mail the DOT permit on November 13.Â  No requests for\r\n  notification of the agency decision were filed with the agency.Â  On November\r\n  30, Coastal entered an appeal of the issuance of the permit.Â  However, this\r\n  appeal was not filed within the allotted time frame.Â  Coastal was not entitled\r\nto a hearing addressing the DOT permit.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\nAdditional Notice Arguments\r\nCoastal maintains\r\n  notice of the issuance of the permits was required by South Carolina Regulation\r\n  61-101.G.1 irrespective of the notification request necessary under the\r\n  statutory scheme.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101.G.1 (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  The ALC found Coastal was only entitled to notification under the guidelines of\r\n  Section 44-1-60 because the language of the regulation specifically limits its\r\n  applicability.Â  Additionally, the ALC judge concluded the statute superseded\r\n  the regulation, making the additional notice provision inapposite.Â  We agree\r\nwith the adjudication of the ALC judge.Â  \r\nIn addition to a\r\n  critical area permit and a coastal zone consistency certification, the SPA\r\n  permit and DOT permit both contain a Section 401 water quality certification.Â  Typically,\r\n  when a water quality certification is involved, Regulation 61-101 applies.Â  This\r\n  regulation instructs: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Department shall issue a notice of proposed decisions on application for\r\n    certification, including any proposed conditions.Â  Such notice shall advise of\r\n    availability of the staff assessment and related file information.Â  Such notice\r\n    shall be mailed to:\r\n  (a)\r\n    the applicant; \r\n  (b)\r\n    agencies having jurisdiction or interest over the disposal site or activity\r\n    site; \r\n  (c)\r\n    owners or residents of property adjoining the area of the proposed activity;\r\n    and\r\n  (d)\r\n    those persons providing comment in response to the initial notice of\r\n    application.Â  \r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  61-101.G.1 (emphasis added).Â  Coastal posits this regulation entitled it to\r\n  notice because Coastal sent comment letters to DHEC during the initial\r\npermitting process.Â  This assertion is erroneous.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find Regulation 61-101.G.1 to be inapplicable in the case at bar because it is\r\n  expressly preempted by Act Number 387.Â  The operative language of the\r\n  legislation elucidates: â€œ. . . to the extent that a provision of this act\r\n    conflicts with an existing statute or regulation, the provisions of this act\r\n    are controlling.â€Â  Act No. 387, Â§ 53, 2006 S.C. Acts &amp; Joint\r\n  Resolutions (emphasis added).Â  The General Assembly indubitably and\r\n  unequivocally enunciated when a conflict between Section 44-1-60 and any prior\r\n  statute or regulation arises, Section 44-1-60 is controlling.Â  Under the\r\n  manifest guidance of the legislature, we cannot adopt an interpretation\r\n  allowing a regulation to override the apprehensible notice provision contained\r\nin the statute.Â  \r\nIrrespective\r\n  of Coastalâ€™s submission of comment letters on each the permits, which would\r\n  arguably entitle it to notice under the regulation, Coastal still had a duty to\r\n  request notification of the department decision from DHEC.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60.Â  Coastal cannot fail to comply with the statutory\r\n  requirements enacted by the General Assembly while arguing for the application\r\nof conflicting regulations.Â  This position is untenable.Â  \r\nPellucidly,\r\n  administrative agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations, but these\r\n  regulations cannot conflict with or alter the statute conferring authority.Â  See Fisher v. J.H. Sheridan Co., Inc., 182 S.C. 316, 326, 189 S.E. 356, 369\r\n  (1936).Â  â€œThe Legislature has the right to vest in the administrative officers\r\n  and bodies of the state a large measure of discretionary authority, especially\r\n  to make rules and regulations as to the enforcement of law; and such rules when\r\n  promulgated are valid, if they are not in conflict with, or do not change in\r\n  any way the statute conferring authority.â€Â  Fisher, 182 S.C. at 326, 189\r\n  S.E. at 369; accord State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 592, 595, 266 S.E.2d\r\n  415, 416-417 (1980); Heyward v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 240 S.C. 347, 355, 126\r\n  S.E.2d 15, 19-20 (1962); S.C. State Highway Depâ€™t v.

Depâ€™t of\r\n    Revenue, 331 S.C. 629, 634, 503 S.E.2d 723, 725 (1998), the South Carolina\r\nSupreme Court annunciated:Â  \r\n\r\n  While\r\n    the Legislature may not delegate its power to make laws, in enacting a law\r\n    complete in itself, it may authorize an administrative agency or board â€œto fill\r\n    up the detailsâ€ by prescribing rules and regulations for the complete operation\r\n    and enforcement of the law within its expressed general purpose.Â  Heyward v.\r\n      South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 240 S.C. 347, 126 S.E.2d 15 (1962).Â  An\r\n    administrative regulation is valid as long as it is reasonably related to the\r\n    purpose of the enabling legislation.Â  Hunter &amp; Walden Co. v. South Carolina State Licensing Bd. for Contractors, 272 S.C. 211, 251 S.E.2d 186\r\n    (1978).Â  Although a regulation has the force of law, it must fall when it\r\n    alters or adds to a statute.Â  Society of Professional Journalists v. Sexton,\r\n    283 S.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d 313 (1984).Â  A rule may only implement the law.Â  Banks\r\n      v. Batesburg Hauling Co., 202 S.C. 273, 24 S.E.2d 496 (1943).Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Section 44-1-60 provides a distinct notice provision\r\n  authorizing four different parties to receive notification of a DHEC department\r\n  decision:Â  (1) the applicant; (2) the permittee; (3) the licensee; and (4)\r\n  affected parties requesting notification.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E).Â \r\n  Regulation 60-101.G.1 expands notification requirements to include the\r\n  following groups: (1) agencies having jurisdiction or interest in the site; (2)\r\n  adjoining property owners and residents; and (3) parties providing comments.Â  The\r\n  regulation alters and adds to the notice requirements mandated by Section\r\n  44-1-60.Â  When there is a conflict between a statute and a regulation\r\n  implementing the statute, the statute is controlling.Â  See McNickelâ€™s,\r\n  331 S.C. at 634, 503 S.E.2d at 725; Act No. 387, Â§ 53, 2006 S.C. Acts &amp;\r\n  Joint Resolutions.Â  In the case sub judice, because the notice\r\n  provision of Section 44-1-60(E) is irreconcilable with the requirement of\r\n  Regulation 60-101.G.1, the statutory language prevails.Â  Coastalâ€™s theory of\r\nentitlement to notification under the regulation is unsound and unavailing.Â  \r\nC.Â \r\nJurisdiction\r\nCoastal\r\n  claims the DHEC Board and the ALC both had proper jurisdiction to hear the\r\ncontroversy.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nOn\r\nthe issue of jurisdiction, the ALC judge expounded:Â  \r\n\r\n  Counsel\r\n    for the SPA, DOT, DHEC, and [Coastal] all affirmatively acknowledged that the\r\n    timely filing of a request for final review with the Board is a jurisdictional\r\n    prerequisite to challenging a DHEC decision.Â  Thus, because [Coastal] failed to\r\n    file its request for final review within fifteen days of the Permit[s] being\r\n    mailed to [the applicants, the SPA and the DOT,] the Board did not have\r\n    jurisdiction over [Coastalâ€™s] challenge to the Permit[s], and neither does this\r\n    Court.Â  \r\n\r\nCompliance with\r\n  statutory time periods for filing appeals is a prerequisite for an appellate\r\n  entity to have jurisdiction to hear an appeal.Â  See Botany Bay\r\n    Marina, Inc. v. Townsend, 296 S.C. 330, 334, 372 S.E.2d 584, 586-587\r\n  (1988), overruled on other grounds by Woodard v. Westvaco Corp.,\r\n  319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995); see also Sadisco of Greenville,\r\n    Inc. v. Greenville County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 340 S.C. 57, 59, 530\r\n  S.E.2d 383, 384 (2000) (â€œThis Court has consistently stated that service of\r\n  Notice of Appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and this Court has no\r\n  authority to extend or expand the time in which the Notice of Appeal must be\r\n  served.â€).Â  In Botany Bay Marina, Inc. v. Townsend, 296 S.C. at 334, 372\r\nS.E.2d at 586-587, the South Carolina Supreme Court observed:Â  \r\n\r\n  In Town\r\n    &amp; County Civic Organization v. Winston-Salem Zoning Board of Adjustment,\r\n    83 N.C. App. 516, 350 S.E.2d 893 (1986), the North Carolina Court of Appeals\r\n    held that the Boardâ€™s thirty day appeal period rule was binding and the\r\n    plaintiffâ€™s failure to effect a timely appeal extinguished subject matter\r\n    jurisdiction.Â  350 S.E.2d at 895.Â  Likewise, respondentâ€™s failure to appeal the\r\n    Charleston County Board of Adjustmentâ€™s decision to grant the zoning permits\r\n    within fifteen days divested the Board of Adjustment of jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nWhile the\r\n  applicable statutes and rules implicated in Botany Bay are\r\n  distinguishable from the mandated time period enacted by Section 44-1-60(E)\r\n  relevant to this case, the Supreme Court instructed compliance with appeals\r\n  filing deadlines grants jurisdiction to an appellate court while noncompliance\r\n  divests jurisdiction.Â  â€œService of the notice of intent to appeal is a\r\n  jurisdictional requirement, and [an appeals court] has no authority to extend\r\n  or expand the time in which the notice of intent to appeal must be served.â€Â  Mears\r\n    v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 169, 337 S.E.2d 206, 207 (1985) (citing Stroup\r\n      v. Duke Power Co., 216 S.C. 79, 56 S.E.2d 745 (1949); Wade v. Gore,\r\n  154 S.C. 262, 151 S.E.2d 470 (1930); Rennecker v. Warren, 20 S.C. 581\r\n(1884)).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Coastal failed to comply with the filing deadlines for\r\n  requesting a review before the DHEC Board.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-1-60(E).Â  The DHEC Board had no authority to extend or expand the period in\r\n  which appeals requests could be timely filed and was limited to the fifteen-day\r\n  filing window enacted by the General Assembly.Â  Based on Coastalâ€™s failure to\r\n  comply with the mandatory appeals term, the DHEC Board lacked jurisdiction and\r\n  could not validly exercise dominion over the matter without erroneously\r\n  extending the span in which appeals could be filed.Â  Because the appeal was\r\n  untimely and the DHEC Board lacked jurisdiction, the ALC could not invoke\r\n  jurisdiction to hear the matter.Â  At the motion hearing in front of the ALC\r\n  judge, Coastalâ€™s counsel corroborated a timely-filed request for final review\r\nbefore the DHEC Board is necessary for the ALC to exercise jurisdiction:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Court:Â  Do you agree that complying with [Section 44-1-60(E)] is a prerequisite\r\n    to being able to later file a contested case before this Court?\r\n  Counsel:Â \r\n    Under the statute yes, sir.Â  \r\n  The\r\n    Court:Â  Okay.Â  So, in essence, the Courtâ€™s jurisdiction is not an exhaustion\r\n    problem.Â  Of course, jurisdiction is tied to [Section 44-1-60(E)].Â  In essence,\r\n    you canâ€™t make the argument that well, thatâ€™s internal workings of [DHEC].Â \r\n    Weâ€™re just going to see what happens, and wait until the process works itself\r\n    out.Â  \r\n  Counsel:Â \r\n    Absolutely.\r\n  The\r\n    Court:Â  And then when it does, I donâ€™t like the results, so now Iâ€™m going to go\r\n    and attempt to challenge it before the ALC.Â  \r\n  Counsel:Â \r\n    Right.Â  Thereâ€™s not going to be sandbagging.\r\n\r\nThis exchange confirms the\r\n  understanding of the parties that proper invocation of the DHEC Boardâ€™s\r\n  authority to conduct the hearing was necessary before a party could challenge a\r\n  decision of that entity.Â  Because jurisdiction was not properly invoked in this\r\ncase, no challenge could be made.Â  \r\nIn Piana v.\r\n  Piana, 239 S.C. 367, 372, 123 S.E.2d 297, 299 (1961), the South Carolina\r\nSupreme Court analyzed jurisdiction:Â  \r\n\r\n  Further\r\n    to be kept in mind is the distinction between jurisdiction and the exercise of\r\n    jurisdiction.Â  â€œThe authority to decide a cause at all, and not the decision\r\n    rendered therein, is what makes up jurisdiction; and when there is jurisdiction\r\n    of the person and the subject matter, the decision of all other questions\r\n    arising in the case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction.â€Â  21 C.J.S.,\r\n    Courts, Â§ 26.Â  As pointed out in Jackson City Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.\r\n      Frederick, 271 Mich. 538, 260 N.W. 908, 909: â€œThere is a side difference\r\n    between a want of jurisdiction in which case the court has no power to\r\n    adjudicate at all, and a mistake in the exercise of undoubted jurisdiction in\r\n    which case the action of the trial court is not void although it may be subject\r\n    to direct attack on appeal.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThe definition of\r\n  jurisdiction in Piana is applicable here.Â  The present case is\r\n  illustrative of a situation where there is a want of jurisdiction to the extent\r\n  that the courts involved had no authority to render a decision in the matter.Â  Neither\r\n  the DHEC Board nor the ALC had jurisdiction due to Coastalâ€™s failure to timely\r\n  file an appeal under the requirements of Section 44-1-60(E).Â  Based on this\r\n  conclusion, the ALC judge was correct in granting the SPAâ€™s motion for dismissal\r\nof the contested case.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Effect of Waiver,\r\n  Estoppel, and Equitable Tolling on Coastalâ€™s Failure to File a Timely Request\r\nfor Final Review\r\nCoastal opines issues of waiver, estoppel, and\r\n  equitable tolling require reversal of the ruling of the ALC.Â  We find that\r\nthese issues are not preserved for review before this Court.Â  \r\nâ€œIssue\r\n  preservation rules are designed to give the trial court a fair opportunity to\r\n  rule on the issues, and thus provide [the Court] with a platform for meaningful\r\n  appellate review.â€Â  Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal Prop.

Boot was indignant, hurling obscenities and\r\n  insults at Dickey and making physical threats to him as he slammed the door to\r\n  the apartment. According to West and McGariggle, Dickey looked angry during the\r\n  encounter but remained calm and did not try to threaten or grab Boot.Â  As he\r\n  stood outside the door, Dickey proceeded to call the police to report the\r\n  disturbance. \r\nMeanwhile,\r\n  back in the apartment, Stroud calmed Boot down and convinced Boot they should\r\n  leave. As the two exited the apartment, they passed Dickey in the hallway.Â \r\n  According to Stroud, Dickey and Boot â€œstared each other down,â€ but no words\r\n  were exchanged.Â  Boot and Stroud took the elevator down to the lobby while\r\n  Dickey took the stairs down to meet them. As Boot and Stroud walked to the\r\n  front door to exit, Dickey followed behind them.Â  Again, no words were\r\n  exchanged. Â Boot and Stroud exited the building.Â  Dickey followed the two out\r\n  the building, stood on the Cornell Arms front doormat, and watched them walk\r\n  away. Â Boot then turned around and walked back in the direction of Dickey.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  this point, the testimony of the witnesses varies substantially.Â  Stroud\r\n  testified he was â€œright besideâ€ Boot as Boot advanced towards Dickey and asked\r\n  Dickey, â€œ[W]hy the f__ was he following [them]?â€ Stroud then stated when Boot\r\n  turned around to say something towards Dickey, Dickey shot Boot three times.Â \r\n  Dickey, on the other hand, testified the two turned towards him and made\r\n  threats they were going to â€œkick his a__,â€ and called him a â€œfat f__â€ among\r\n  other things.Â  Dickey testified he told them, again, he just wanted them to\r\n  leave. Dickey stated he was afraid and felt â€œ[he] was outnumbered and [he]\r\n  realized they were covering ground too fast for [him] to get back in the\r\n  building.â€ Â Dickey went on to say he reached into his pocket and exposed his\r\n  pistol, causing both men to stop advancing temporarily. Dickey then claimed\r\n  Boot said, â€œf__ it, letâ€™s do it,â€ and reached under his shirt and stepped\r\n  toward Dickey. Â Believing Boot to have a concealed weapon under his shirt,\r\n  Dickey fired three shots, killing Boot. \r\nImmediately,\r\n  Dickey called 911. When the police arrived, Dickey told the officer about his\r\n  pistol and that he had a concealed weapon permit. Dickey told the officer he\r\n  shot Boot after Boot had come at him with a bottle he had hidden under his\r\n  shirt. Â Crime scene investigators found a broken liquor bottle near the scene\r\n  of the shooting with a smear of Bootâ€™s blood on it.Â  \r\nDickey\r\n  was indicted for murder and tried before a jury in September 2006.Â  At the\r\n  close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of\r\n  acquittal on the ground of self-defense. The motion was denied.Â  Defense\r\n  counsel renewed the motion for directed verdict at the close of all evidence.\r\n  Thereafter, the trial court instructed the jury on murder, voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, and self-defense. After the trial court charged the jury, defense\r\n  counsel argued the trial court did not adequately charge the jury on either the\r\n  right to act on appearances or the duty to retreat and objected to the refusal\r\n  to charge the requested instructions on curtilage.Â  During the instruction on\r\n  voluntary manslaughter, the trial judge stated to the jury:\r\n\r\n  By way\r\n    of illustration, and I would point out this is by illustration alone, that if\r\n    an unjustifiable assault is made with violence with the circumstances of\r\n    indignity upon a manâ€™s person and the party so assaulted kills the aggressor\r\n    the crime will be reduced to manslaughter.Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict\r\n  of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Dickey was sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial court erred in\r\n    refusing to grant a directed verdict that Dickey acted in self defense as a\r\n    matter of law?\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial court, in its\r\n    instructions on self-defense, properly charged the jury on curtilage, the duty\r\n    to retreat, and the right to act on appearances?\r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial court erred in\r\n    charging the jury on voluntary manslaughter in light of the evidence presented\r\n    at trial?\r\n  D.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial courtâ€™s\r\n    â€œillustrationâ€ to the jury of voluntary manslaughter was an improper comment on\r\n    the facts?\r\n  E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial court erred in\r\n    refusing to retroactively apply the â€œStand Your Groundâ€ law to this case?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, this Court reviews errors of law only.Â  State v. Miller,\r\n  375 S.C. 370, 378, 652 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Thus, we are bound by\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed Verdict of\r\n  Self-Defense as a Matter of Law\r\nDickey\r\n  argues under State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 244 S.E.2d 503 (1978), the\r\n  trial court should have directed a verdict of acquittal because the State\r\n  failed to provide evidence to negate his claim of self-defense as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  basic definition of when a person is justified in using deadly force in\r\n  self-defense is comprised of four elements: \r\n\r\n  (1) That he was without fault in\r\n    bringing on the difficulty, (2) That he actually believed he was in imminent\r\n    danger of losing his life or of sustaining serious bodily injury [], or he\r\n    actually was in imminent danger of losing his life or of sustaining serious\r\n    bodily injury, (3) If his defense is based on his actual belief of imminent\r\n    danger, that a reasonable prudent man of ordinary firmness and courage would have\r\n    entertained the same belief [], or if his defense is based on his being in\r\n    actual and imminent danger, that â€œthe circumstances were such as would warrant\r\n    a man of ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in\r\n    order to save himself from serious bodily harm, or losing his own life, (4)\r\n    That he had no other probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his own\r\n    life or sustaining serious bodily injury than to act as he did in the particular\r\n    instance.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 657-58, 244 S.E.2d at 505-06 (internal citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nAt\r\n  one time, self-defense was an affirmative defense in this State, and a\r\n  defendant bore the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  State v. McDowell, 272 S.C. 203, 207, 249 S.E.2d 916, 918\r\n  (1978).Â  However, current law requires the State to disprove self-defense, once\r\n  raised by the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Wiggins,\r\n  330 S.C. 538, 544, 500 S.E.2d 489, 492-493 (1998).\r\nWhen\r\n  this Court reviews the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, it views the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Â State v. Long,\r\n  325 S.C. 59, 62, 480 S.E.2d 62, 63 (1997).Â  When ruling on a motion for\r\n  directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of evidence,\r\n  not its weight.Â  Id.Â  If there is any direct or substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which\r\n  guilt may be fairly and logically deduced, it is the trial courtâ€™s duty to\r\n  submit the case to the jury.Â  Id.Â  In other words, if the State provided\r\n  evidence sufficient to negate Dickeyâ€™s claim of self-defense, Dickeyâ€™s motion\r\n  for directed verdict was properly denied.Â  \r\nThe State provided\r\n  such evidence.Â  First, the State provided evidence which, if believed, tended\r\n  to show Dickey was not without fault in bringing on the difficulty.Â  Any act of\r\n  an accused that is reasonably calculated to produce the occasion amounts to\r\n  bringing on the difficulty and bars the right to assert self-defense.Â  State\r\n    v. Slater, 373 S.C. 66, 70, 644 S.E.2d 50, 52 (2007).Â  Additionally, the\r\n  plea of self-defense is not available to one who kills another in mutual\r\n  combat.Â  State v. Graham, 260 S.C. 449, 450, 196 S.E.2d 495, 495\r\n  (1973).Â  In this case, a jury could have found that Dickeyâ€™s decision to exit\r\n  the building and brandish his loaded gun, after the confrontation between him\r\n  and Boot inside the apartment had all but ended, was an act that was reasonably\r\n  calculated to provoke a new altercation with Boot, and that Dickey intended to\r\n  engage in mutual combat.\r\nSecond,\r\n  the State provided evidence that, if believed, tended to show Dickey had other\r\n  probable means of avoiding the danger than to act as he did (i.e., that Dickey\r\n  had a duty to retreat).Â  Under the Castle Doctrine, â€œone attacked, without\r\n  fault on his own part, on his own premises, has the right in establishing his\r\n  plea of self-defense, to claim immunity from the law of retreat, which\r\n  ordinarily is an essential element of that defense.â€ State v. Hewitt,\r\n  205 S.C. 207, 212, 31 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1944).Â  In this case, Dickey was not\r\n  immune from the duty to retreat under the Castle Doctrine.Â  It is undisputed\r\n  that Dickey was not inside the apartment building at the time he shot Boot, nor\r\n  was he within the curtilage of the building.[2]Â \r\n  Rather, he was standing on a public sidewalk outside the apartment building.Â \r\n  He was, therefore, not immune as a matter of law under the Castle Doctrine.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sufficiency of Jury\r\n  Instructions on Self-Defense\r\nA\r\n  trial court has a duty to give a requested instruction that correctly states\r\n  the law applicable to the issues and is supported by the evidence.Â  State v.\r\n    Peer, 320 S.C. 546, 553, 466 S.E.2d 375, 380 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  To warrant\r\n  reversal, a trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\n  erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C.\r\n  439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000).Â  If the instructions given to the jury\r\n  afford the proper test for determining the issues, the failure to give one\r\n  sideâ€™s requested instructions is not prejudicial.Â  Id. at 452, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 728.Â  \r\n\r\n  i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curtilage\r\n\r\nDickey\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on curtilage.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA\r\n  defendant has no duty to retreat when attacked in his home or at his place of\r\n  business.Â  Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 548 n.15, 500 S.E.2d at 494 n.15.Â  This\r\n  rule of immunity extends to the curtilage of the building as well.Â  Id.Â  Curtilage includes outbuildings, the yard around the dwelling, a garden of a\r\n  dwelling, or the parking lot of a business. Id.Â  The common denominator\r\n  between these places that are considered curtilage is they are places where the\r\n  property owner alone has the right to be, to the exclusion of the general\r\n  public.Â  See State v. McGee, 185 S.C. 184, 191, 193 S.E. 303, 306\r\n  (1937) (holding duty to retreat applies on a public highway, â€œwhere all men have\r\n  equal rightsâ€); State v. Rochester, 72 S.C. 194, 197, 51 S.E. 685, 686\r\n  (1905) (â€œA man on his own premises has a greater right there than anybody\r\n  else.â€).Â  They are not considered curtilage simply because they are close to\r\n  the building or maintained by the owner.Â  State v. Boyd, 126 S.C. 300, 302,\r\n  119 S.E. 839, 840 (1923) (holding one charged with assault and battery with\r\n  intent to kill cannot defend on the ground that the Castle Doctrine extends to\r\n  the middle of the street in front of the defendantâ€™s house).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, it is undisputed Dickey was on the doormat outside the front door to\r\n  the Cornell Arms apartments at the time he shot Boot. The doormat was placed\r\n  away from the threshold of the entrance to the building, on the public\r\n  sidewalk.[3]Â \r\n  Although Dickey makes a colorable argument this portion of the sidewalk should\r\n  be treated as curtilage of the apartment building,[4] the current law in this state does not include adjacent public sidewalks or\r\n  public streets as curtilage such that the duty to retreat would be excused.Â  See McGee, 185 S.C. at 184, 193 S.E. at 306 (rejecting defendantâ€™s argument\r\n  he had no duty to retreat in his car on a public street).Â  Other jurisdictions\r\n  have similarly refused to hold there is no duty to retreat from a sidewalk in front\r\n  of a business or residence.Â  See, e.g., Â State v. Menser, 382\r\n  N.W.2d 18, 20 (Neb. 1986) (holding a sidewalk outside defendantâ€™s apartment\r\n  house was not part of defendantâ€™s â€œdwellingâ€ within the meaning of law of\r\n  self-defense); State v. Provoid, 110 N.J. Super. 547, 554, 266 A.2d 307,\r\n  311 (1970) (noting the curtilage of oneâ€™s residence does not extend to a public\r\n  thoroughfare running along the boundary of oneâ€™s property).Â  Unlike an\r\n  outbuilding, yard or parking lot next to a building, the sidewalk is public\r\n  land from which Dickey would not have had â€œthe right to eject his adversary.â€Â Â  Rochester, 72 S.C. at 203, 51 S.E. at 688.Â  Because the sidewalk was\r\n  not within the curtilage of the apartment building, Dickey was not immune from\r\n  the duty to retreat.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s refusal to instruct the jury\r\n  on the law of curtilage was not error. \r\n\r\n  ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendantâ€™s Right to Act on\r\n    Appearances\r\n\r\nDickey\r\n  next argues the trial courtâ€™s instruction to the jury on the right to act on\r\n  appearances was inadequate.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it is\r\n  substantially correct and adequately covers the law.Â  State v. Foust, 325\r\n  S.C. 12, 16, 479 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1996).Â  Regarding the right to act on\r\n  appearances, the Supreme Court has held:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    test is not whether there was testimony of an intended attack but whether or\r\n    not the appellant believed he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily\r\n    harm, and he is not required to show that such danger actually existed because\r\n    he had a right to act upon such appearances as would cause a reasonable and\r\n    prudent man of ordinary firmness and courage to entertain the same belief.\r\n\r\nState v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271, 279, 87 S.E.2d 681, 684 (1955).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the trial court instructed the jury on the second and third elements\r\n  of self-defense as follows:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    deciding whether the defendant was or believed that he was in imminent danger\r\n    of death or serious bodily injury you should consider all of the facts and\r\n    circumstances surrounding the offense including the physical condition and the\r\n    characteristics of the defendant and the victim. . . [I]t does not have to\r\n    appear that the defendant believed that he was actually in danger.Â  It is\r\n    enough that the defendant believed that he was in imminent danger and a\r\n    reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have had the\r\n    same belief.Â  A defendant has the right to act on appearances even though the\r\n    defendantâ€™s belief may have been mistaken.\r\n\r\nGiven the\r\n  similarity between these two statements of the law, the trial court\r\n  sufficiently instructed the jury on the right to act on appearances.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duty to Retreat\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlthough\r\n  the trial court did instruct the jury on the duty to retreat, Dickey argues the\r\n  charge was inadequate.Â  We disagree.\r\nDespite\r\n  the fact that Dickey was not within the curtilage at the time of the shooting,\r\n  one may still satisfy the fourth prong of self-defense if he had no other\r\n  probable means of avoiding the danger than to act as he did in the situation.Â  Hendrix,\r\n  270 S.C. at 658, 244 S.E.2d at 506.Â  Here, Dickey presented evidence that, if\r\n  believed, could have supported a finding that retreat would have increased the\r\n  danger to him.Â  Had he retreated back into the apartmentâ€™s first set of heavy\r\n  front doors, he would have encountered the locked interior doors to the lobby.\r\n  If his assailants had then followed him in, he could have been trapped in an\r\n  enclosed space, thereby increasing his risk of peril from what it would have\r\n  been had he stood his ground outside.Â  Because this evidence, if believed,\r\n  could have supported a finding of no duty to retreat, Dickey was entitled to a\r\n  charge on the duty to retreat.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court instructed the jury on the duty to retreat as follows:\r\n\r\n  Regardless\r\n    of whether a defendant is on personal premises or business premises, . . . a\r\n    defendant has no duty to retreat if by doing so the danger of being killed or\r\n    suffering serious bodily injury would increase . . . [I]f both parties are\r\n    where they have a right to be there is a duty to retreat unless retreating, in\r\n    doing so the danger of being killed or suffering serious bodily injury would\r\n    increase. \r\n\r\nBecause\r\n  this charge, when read as a whole, was substantially correct and adequately\r\n  covers the law, it was a proper instruction on the duty to retreat.Â  Foust,\r\n  325 S.C. at 16, 479 S.E.2d at 52.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntary Manslaughter\r\n  Charge\r\n\r\n  i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preservation of Error\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the charge of voluntary manslaughter was not properly objected to\r\n  by defense counsel and, therefore, the issue is not available for appellate\r\n  review.Â  We disagree.\r\nIf a\r\n  party fails to properly object, the party is procedurally barred from raising\r\n  the issue on appeal.Â  State v. Pauling, 322 S.C. 95, 100, 470 S.E.2d\r\n  106, 109 (1996).Â  A proper objection should be sufficiently specific to bring\r\n  into focus the precise nature of the alleged error so that it can be reasonably\r\n  understood by the trial court.Â  State v. Wigington, 375 S.C. 25, 35-36,\r\n  649 S.E.2d 185, 190 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the instructions to the jury, defense counsel stated his\r\n  objection to the charge on voluntary manslaughter as, â€œWe do not think [the\r\n  instruction on voluntary manslaughter] was appropriate with the facts and\r\n  circumstances in the case.â€Â  The State argues this objection was not\r\n  sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  While\r\n  defense counsel could have made a more specific objection, the objection made\r\n  it sufficiently clear to the trial court that defense counsel did not believe\r\n  the evidence supported a charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Because the\r\n  objection brought to the trial courtâ€™s attention the precise nature of the\r\n  alleged error, the issue is properly preserved for our review.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Propriety of the Charge\r\n  \r\n\r\nDickey\r\n  argues the trial court erred in instructing the jury on voluntary manslaughter\r\n  because no evidence was presented from which the jury could have reasonably\r\n  concluded he acted â€œin the heat of passion.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial. Â State\r\n    v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380 S.E.2d 834, 835 (1989). Â In determining\r\n  whether the evidence requires a charge on voluntary manslaughter, this Court\r\n  must view the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant. Â State v.\r\n    Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474 S.E.2d 430, 431 (1996). Â For a court to refuse\r\n  to charge a jury on manslaughter, there must be no evidence in the record\r\n  tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. Â State v. Lowry,\r\n  315 S.C. 396, 399, 434 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1993).\r\nVoluntary\r\n  manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion\r\n  upon sufficient legal provocation. Â State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 285-86,\r\n  350 S.E.2d 180, 184 (1986). Â Evidence of acting in the heat of passion alone\r\n  will not suffice to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. Â State v.\r\n    Walker, 324 S.C. 257, 260, 478 S.E.2d 280, 281 (1996).Â  Rather, both heat\r\n  of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at the time of the\r\n  killing. Â State v. Tyson, 283 S.C. 375, 379, 323 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1984).\r\n  Â To mitigate a felonious killing to manslaughter, the sudden heat of passion â€œmust\r\n  be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of\r\n  an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to\r\n  human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 322, 474 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1996) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted).\r\nEven\r\n  assuming[5] adequate legal provocation by Boot, Dickey argues there was no evidence\r\n  presented at trial from which the jury could have found he acted in the heat of\r\n  passion at the time he shot Boot that would support the voluntary manslaughter\r\n  charge.Â  Dickey points to witness testimony indicating he â€œremained calm,â€ â€œdid\r\n  not ever touch Boot,â€ â€œdid not mouth off in return,â€ and â€œhad no prior bad\r\n  feelings or ill will [towards Boot].â€ In contrast, the heat of passion is an uncontrollable\r\n  impulse to do violence, which renders the mind incapable of cool reflection.Â  Byrd,\r\n  323 S.C. at 322, 474 S.E.2d at 432.Â  Thus, Dickey argues he did in fact remain\r\n  calm and in control, which necessarily means he was not acting in the heat of\r\n  passion at the time of the shooting.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  essence, Dickeyâ€™s position is that, in view of the evidence presented, the only\r\n  emotion he was experiencing at the time he shot Boot was fear.Â \r\n  Dickey correctly points out that fear for oneâ€™s safety is a necessary prong of\r\n  self-defense.Â  Hendrix, 270 S.C. at 657-58, 244 S.E.2d at 505-506.Â \r\n  Therefore, Dickey argues, if simply being afraid amounts to being in the heat\r\n  of passion for purposes of voluntary manslaughter, the line separating it from\r\n  self-defense would be blurred under such an interpretation.Â  To reconcile this,\r\n  Dickey argues there must exist some legal difference between the type of\r\n  reasonable fear that would support a self-defense claim on the one hand, and\r\n  the type of fear that would support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter on the\r\n  other.Â  Dickey argues the latter type is â€œfear that causes a person to lose\r\n  control of himself temporarily,â€ and because the evidence did not support a\r\n  finding of this latter type of fear, he was not acting in the heat of passion.Â \r\n  Thus, the charge was improper.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  it is well settled that self-defense and voluntary manslaughter are not\r\n  mutually exclusive, and both issues should be submitted to the jury if\r\n  supported by the evidence.Â  Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 549 n.18, 500 S.E.2d at\r\n  495 n.18; State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 118, 481 S.E.2d 118, 122\r\n  (1997); State v. Gilliam, 296 S.C. 395, 396, 373 S.E.2d 596, 597\r\n  (1988).Â  The rationale for this rule is that the jury may fail to find all the\r\n  elements for self-defense but could find sufficient legal provocation and heat\r\n  of passion to conclude the defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Gilliam,\r\n  296 S.C. at 396-97, 373 S.E.2d at 597.Â  Furthermore, contrary to Dickeyâ€™s\r\n  argument, fear can constitute a basis for heat of passion to support voluntary\r\n  manslaughter. See Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 549, 500 S.E.2d at 495 (holding\r\n  when evidence showed appellant was in a heated argument with the victim and was\r\n  afraid for his life because victim physically threatened him, such evidence, if\r\n  believed, would tend to show appellant acted in sudden heat of passion).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, ample evidence was introduced that would support a finding of heat\r\n  of passion.Â  Dickey and Boot engaged in a heated argument before the shooting\r\n  and Boot verbally threatened Dickey. Evidence of arguments and physical threats\r\n  prior to a homicide can support a charge of manslaughter.Â  See Lowry,\r\n  315 S.C. at 399, 434 S.E.2d at 274 (holding it was an error for trial court to\r\n  refuse to charge on manslaughter when there was testimony which, if believed,\r\n  tended to show that the decedent and the defendant were in a heated argument\r\n  and that the decedent was about to initiate a physical encounter when the shooting\r\n  occurred).Â  Dickey also testified Boot came at him in a threatening manner,\r\n  reaching under his shirt for what could have been a weapon, and said to Dickey,\r\n  â€œF___ it, letâ€™s do it.â€Â  Taken together, these could support a finding that\r\n  Dickey was in the heat of passion.Â  See Gilliam, 296 S.C. at 397,\r\n  373 S.E.2d at 597 (â€œAppellantâ€™s testimony that the victim threatened him and\r\n  then fired at him would support a finding of sufficient legal provocation and\r\n  heat of passion.â€).Â  \r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trial Judgeâ€™s\r\n  â€œIllustrationâ€ of Voluntary Manslaughter\r\nDickey\r\n  argues the trial courtâ€™s illustration during his instructions to the jury on\r\n  voluntary manslaughter was an improper comment on the facts of the case.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nArticle\r\n  V, Â§ 21 of the South Carolina Constitution states: â€œJudges shall not charge\r\n  juries in respect to matters of fact, but shall declare the law.â€Â  South Carolina law dictates a trial judge should refrain from any comment that tends to\r\n  indicate to the jury his opinion on the credibility of witnesses, the weight of\r\n  the evidence, or the guilt of the accused.Â  State v. Jackson, 297 S.C.\r\n  523, 526, 377 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1989).Â  However, jury instructions must be\r\n  considered in their entirety and, if in their entirety are free from error, any\r\n  potentially misleading portions do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œOftentimes\r\n  juries can be made to understand the law of the case easier if they are given\r\n  helpful illustrations.â€ Â State v. Quick, 141 S.C. 442, 447, 140 S.E. 97,\r\n  99 (1927). Â A charge that states the legal conclusions that would result from\r\n  the establishment of certain facts is not necessarily an improper charge on the\r\n  facts, nor a mandate to the jury to assume the truth of the facts as stated.Â  Williams\r\n    v. Se. Life Ins. Co.Â  197 S.C. 171, 177, 14 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1941).Â  The\r\n  test is how a reasonable juror would have understood the charge. Â Sheppard\r\n    v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 664, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472 (2004).\r\nHere,\r\n  it is unlikely that a reasonable juror would have singled out the illustration\r\n  portion of the charge and interpreted it as the courtâ€™s opinion on the facts of\r\n  this case or as an instruction on the weight to be given to the evidence.Â \r\n  First, the jury was reminded numerous times of its role as arbiter of the facts.\r\n  Second, the trial court prefaced its illustration by making clear it was just\r\n  an illustration. Third, the trial courtâ€™s illustration took on the form: â€œIf X,\r\n  Y and Z occur, that constitutes manslaughter.â€Â  He did not say, â€œX, Y and Z\r\n  occurred.â€Â  See, e.g., State v. Smith, 288 S.C. 329, 330-31, 342\r\n  S.E.2d. 600, 601 (1986) (holding judgeâ€™s instruction, â€œIf the State proves [elements\r\n  one through four], then the results of the test can be admitted into evidence\r\n  and the jury to consider. You have heard such evidenceâ€ was error\r\n  because a reasonable juror could have construed that the trial judge felt the\r\n  State had met its burden of proof on the required elements) (emphasis added).Â \r\n  In this case, the trial courtâ€™s illustration was an explanation, not commentary.Â \r\n  Taken as a whole, the instructions were not erroneous.\r\nE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Retroactive Application of\r\n  â€œStand Your Groundâ€ Law\r\nDickey\r\n  argues that the trial court should have applied the recently enacted Protection\r\n  of Persons and Property Act (the Act) to his case.Â  The Act has an effective\r\n  date of June 9, 2006, and Dickey was charged with murder on April 29, 2004, and\r\n  convicted of manslaughter on September 15, 2006.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preservation of Error\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  State argues Dickey did not properly assert this argument to the trial court,\r\n  and so it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  issue not presented to the trial court is not preserved for appellate review.Â  State\r\n    v. Johnson,Â  324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996).Â  See also State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 427-28, 462 S.E.2d 264, 264-65 (1995)\r\n  (holding when defendant failed to object to a jury charge, issue is not\r\n  preserved for consideration on appeal); State v. Stone, 285 S.C. 386,\r\n  387, 330 S.E.2d 286, 287 (1985) (holding defendantâ€™s failure to object to\r\n  charge as given, or to request an additional charge when the opportunity to do\r\n  so has been afforded, waived the right to complain on appeal); State v. Rogers,\r\n  361 S.C. 178, 183, 603 S.E.2d 910, 912-13 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that to\r\n  preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court, raised by the appellant, raised in a timely\r\n  manner, and raised to the trial court with sufficient specificity).Â  \r\nDefense\r\n  counsel in this case argued before the trial court, on the record, that the\r\n  trial court should apply the Act to this case.Â  Thereafter, the trial court\r\n  heard opposing argument from the State on this same issue.Â  After hearing from\r\n  both parties on the issue, the trial court ruled on the issue, stating: â€œI think\r\n  it was clearly the intent of the legislature, that . . . this [A]ct does not\r\n  apply to pending criminal prosecution.Â  For that reason that is the courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling.â€ Â The issue was timely raised on the record and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court and is, therefore, preserved for review.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retroactive Application\r\n  \r\n\r\nDickey\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to apply the Act to this case.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  retrospective operation of a statute is not favored by the courts, and statutes\r\n  are presumed to be prospective in effect.Â  State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326,\r\n  334, 422 S.E.2d 133, 139 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Brightman\r\n    v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 352 n.2, 520 S.E.2d 614, 616 n.2 (1999).Â  The\r\n  Supreme Court has recognized that â€œ[a] statute is not to be applied\r\n  retroactively unless that result is so clearly compelled as to leave no room\r\n  for doubt.â€Â  Am. Nat. Fire Ins. Co. v. Smith Grading &amp; Paving, 317\r\n  S.C. 445, 449, 454 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).Â  The exception to this rule of\r\n  prospective operation is where the statute is remedial or procedural in nature.Â  Hercules, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 137, 143, 262 S.E.2d 45, 48\r\n  (1980).\r\nDickey\r\n  argues the Act should be applied retroactively because it is procedural in\r\n  nature. We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Act, by codifying the common law Castle Doctrine, creates substantive rights\r\n  for citizens.Â  The Act â€œextends the [Castle] doctrine to include an occupied\r\n  vehicle and the personâ€™s place of business.â€[6]Â \r\n  The Act also gives citizens the right â€œto protect themselves, their families\r\n  and others from intruders and attackers without fear of prosecution or civil\r\n  action.â€[7]Â \r\n  Therefore, because the rights are substantive, the Act will only operate\r\n  retroactively if there is a clear indication from the legislature that this was\r\n  intended.Â  Am. Nat. Fire, 317 S.C. at 449, 454 S.E.2d at 899.Â  There is\r\n  no such indication in the Act.Â  The Act specifically states it was not\r\n  effective until approved by the Governor, which occurred on June 9, 2006.Â  2006\r\n  S.C. Act No. 379 Â§ 6.Â  This effective date was over two years after the\r\n  shooting at the Cornell Arms Apartments.Â  Additionally, section 4 of the Act\r\n  provides the following savings clause:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    repeal or amendment by this act of any law, whether temporary or permanent,\r\n    civil or criminal, does not affect pending actions, rights, duties, or\r\n    liabilities founded thereon, or alter, discharge, release or extinguish any\r\n    penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under the repealed or amended law,\r\n    unless the repealed or amended provision shall so expressly provide.Â  After the\r\n    effective date of this act, all laws repealed or amended by this act must be\r\n    taken and treated as remaining in full force and effect for the purpose of\r\n    sustaining any pending or vested right, civil action, special proceeding,\r\n    criminal prosecution, or appeal existing as of the effective date of this act,\r\n    and for the enforcement of rights, duties, penalties and forfeitures, and\r\n    liabilities as they stood under the repealed or amended laws. \r\n\r\nHere,\r\n  the Legislature clearly manifested its intent that the Act be applied\r\n  prospectively.Â  As such, the fact that Dickeyâ€™s prosecution was pending before\r\n  the effective date of the Act precludes the application of the Act to this\r\n  case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The record\r\n  indicates that the ladies and their neighbors were in the practice of tossing\r\n  water balloons at each otherâ€™s apartments as part of an ongoing â€œjoke.â€ \r\n[2] A discussion of\r\n  curtilage follows.\r\n[3] At oral argument,\r\n  counsel for Dickey argued the front mat was located in an â€œindentation,â€ away\r\n  from the sidewalk, such that the front edge of the doormat was flush with the\r\n  front of the building and therefore not on the sidewalk.Â  However, photos taken\r\n  at the crime scene do not corroborate this.\r\n[4] Dickey argues\r\n  the shooting occurred on the curtilage of the apartment building because the\r\n  sidewalk was covered by the buildingâ€™s awning; Dickey was on the front door mat\r\n  when the shooting occurred; Cornell Arms owned both the doormat and the awning;\r\n  and Cornell Arms maintained the flower beds and benches on the sidewalk.\r\n[5] In his brief,\r\n  Appellant has phrased his argument as: â€œ[M]anslaughter is not a valid verdict\r\n  where Dickey was not acting in the heat of passion.â€Â  He does not dispute the\r\n  finding of adequate legal provocation.Â  His argument on appeal is therefore\r\n  limited to whether Dickey was in the heat of passion.Â  An issue that is not\r\n  argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal.Â \r\n  Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR; Jinks v.

Mark Taylor, of West Columbia and Peggy McMillan Infinger, of Charleston, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\n        Beth Ann Gilleland, of Bluffton, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS J.:Â  In\r\n  this family law action, Donald Feldman (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s\r\n  decision not to terminate his obligation to pay Francine Feldmanâ€™s (Wife)\r\n  alimony.Â  Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s decision not to award her attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were divorced in June 2000.Â  Husband was required\r\n  to pay Wife permanent periodic alimony in the amount of $4,500 per month.Â  In\r\n  May 2004, Husbandâ€™s obligation was reduced to $4,000 per month.Â  In September\r\n  2005, Husband brought an action to have his alimony obligation terminated\r\n  pursuant to the continued cohabitation provision of section 20-3-130(B)(1) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007), claiming Wife and Frank Watson\r\n  (Boyfriend) had engaged in a romantic relationship and resided together for a\r\n  period of ninety or more consecutive days.Â  Wife and Boyfriend did not deny the\r\n  romantic relationship, but both disputed the claim of cohabitation.Â  Â \r\nWife and Boyfriend became acquainted in the latter part of 2002.Â \r\n  Wife characterized the nature of their relationship at that time as\r\n  acquaintances.Â  However, the two became romantically involved in August 2003.Â \r\n  In October 2003, Wife invested approximately $50,000 in Boyfriendâ€™s business.[1]Â  As security for her investment Wife\r\n  received fifty percent of the stocks in this business.Â  Subsequently, Wife\r\n  became the sole owner of Decorative Concrete and Design as a result of\r\n  additional investments.Â  \r\nHusband became suspicious of the relationship between Boyfriend\r\n  and Wife and hired Randy Caulder (Caulder), a private investigator, in April\r\n  2005 to investigate the matter.Â  Consequently, Caulder began surveillance of\r\n  Wifeâ€™s condominium.Â  The surveillance entailed Caulder periodically checking to\r\n  see what vehicles were at Wifeâ€™s residence in the evenings and mornings.Â  Wifeâ€™s\r\n  condominium complex had numbered parking slots corresponding to each\r\n  condominium.Â  Wife, who resided in condominium number 302, was assigned two\r\n  parking slots enumerated as 302 and 302 visitor.Â  \r\nCaulder testified that on multiple occasions he observed a BMW and\r\n  a silver Chevrolet pickup in parking spaces 302 and 302 visitor, respectively.Â \r\n  According to Caulder, the BMW belonged to Wife and the pickup belonged to\r\n  Boyfriend.Â  Caulder explained that in the evening Wife would park the BMW in\r\n  spot 302 and enter her condominium.Â  Shortly thereafter, Boyfriend would park\r\n  his pickup in spot 302 visitor and go into Wifeâ€™s condominium.Â  \r\nOn a few occasions, Caulder arrived early in the morning at the\r\n  condominium complex and observed Boyfriend exiting Wifeâ€™s condominium, get in\r\n  his pickup and leave.Â  Thus, Caulder could at least place Boyfriendâ€™s vehicle\r\n  at Wifeâ€™s residence late at night and early in the morning.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Caulder interacted with Boyfriend at Wifeâ€™s condominium on two occasions.Â  \r\nIn the first instance, Caulder was commissioned by a law firm to\r\n  serve papers on Boyfriend.Â  As a result, Caulder went to Wifeâ€™s condominium and\r\n  found Boyfriend there.Â  The second time, Caulder was instructed to serve papers\r\n  on Wife.Â  Once again, Caulder arrived at Wifeâ€™s condominium and found Boyfriend\r\n  there.Â  Caulder left the papers with Boyfriend along with instructions that the\r\n  papers were to be given to Wife when she arrived home.Â  \r\nUpon hearing all the evidence, the family court found Husband had\r\n  failed to carry his burden of proof to show Wife and Boyfriend engaged in\r\n  continued cohabitation for ninety or more consecutive days pursuant to section 20-3-130(B)(1).Â \r\n  Based on this, the family court did not terminate Husbandâ€™s obligation to pay\r\n  Wife alimony.Â  The family court further denied Wifeâ€™s request for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189-90, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Id.Â  Nor must we ignore the fact\r\n  that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Id.Â  However, our broad scope of review does not relieve the\r\n  appellant of the burden of convincing this Court that the family court\r\n  committed error.Â  Id. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Husbandâ€™s appeal \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to find\r\n  Wife engaged in continued cohabitation with Boyfriend and, therefore, erred in\r\n  not terminating alimony.Â  Husband also contends the family courtâ€™s final ruling\r\n  is contradicted by its ruling at the directed verdict stage.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  20-3-130(B)(1) allows for the termination of alimony upon â€œthe remarriage or\r\n  continued cohabitation of the supported spouse . . . .â€Â  The statute states:\r\n\r\n  For\r\n    purposes of this subsection and unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the\r\n    parties, â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ means the supported spouse resides with\r\n    another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more\r\n    consecutive days.Â  The court may determine that a continued cohabitation exists\r\n    if there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with another person in a\r\n    romantic relationship for periods of less than ninety days and the two\r\n    periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ§\r\n  20-3-130(B).Â  \r\nThe continued\r\n  cohabitation requirement necessitates the supported spouse reside with another\r\n  person for ninety or more consecutive days.Â  Id.Â  The term â€œreside,â€ as\r\n  used in this context, has recently been explained to mean that â€œthe supported\r\n  spouse live under the same roof as the person with whom they are romantically\r\n  involved for at least ninety consecutive days.â€Â  Semken v. Semken, 379\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 664 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2008) (citing Strickland v. Strickland,\r\n  375 S.C. 76, 89, 650 S.E.2d 465, 472 (2007)).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, Husband relies heavily on the testimony of Caulder in arguing\r\n  the family courtâ€™s finding that Wife and Boyfriend did not engage in continued\r\n  cohabitation should be reversed.Â  Caulder was hired to perform surveillance on\r\n  Wifeâ€™s residence on April 2005.Â  As noted above, Caulder testified that\r\n  Boyfriend drove a Chevrolet pickup truck.Â  Caulder performed surveillance on\r\n  Wifeâ€™s residence only twenty-one times.Â  \r\nOf\r\n  these days, ten were before June 13, 2005.Â  However, a bill of sale produced at\r\n  trial showed Boyfriend purchased the pickup on June 13, 2005.Â  This negated any\r\n  possibility of Caulder observing Boyfriend driving, entering, or exiting the\r\n  pickup prior to June 13, 2005.Â  Such evidence falls well short of the ninety\r\n  day requirement mandated by section 20-3-130(B)(1).Â  \r\nCaulder admitted he did not know whether Wife and Boyfriend lived\r\n  together.Â  Caulder also admitted he could not state if Boyfriend ever stayed\r\n  the night at Wifeâ€™s condominium.Â  Additionally, Caulder conceded he did not\r\n  know whether Boyfriend and Wife had stayed together for ninety or more days.Â  Moreover, testimony produced at trial supported the\r\n  conclusion that Husband failed to carry his burden of proof.\r\nBoth\r\n  Boyfriend and Wife freely admitted the romantic nature of their relationship,\r\n  but both denied that Boyfriend had stayed with Wife for ninety or more days.Â  Such assertions may appear to be self-serving, but they were\r\n  corroborated by testimony from individuals who visited or stayed with Wife in\r\n  her residence.Â Â  \r\nFor example, Wifeâ€™s friend Marian Nalven, who characterized her\r\n  relationship with Wife as that of mother and daughter, testified that Wife\r\n  lived alone.Â  Wifeâ€™s friend Kathy Nalven, who characterized her relationship with\r\n  Wife as that of sisters, also stated that Wife lived alone.Â  Karin Gutierrez,\r\n  who has known Wife all her life, testified that Wife did not live with anyone.\r\n  Wifeâ€™s former employee Lana Brantley stated that Wife lived alone.Â  Wifeâ€™s next\r\n  door neighbor of two years testified Wife lived alone.Â  Another of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  friends, Janice Malafronte, stated Wife was the sole occupant of her\r\n  condominium.Â  Wife and Husbandâ€™s son, Paul Feldman, who characterized his\r\n  relationship with his mother as excellent, testified Wife stayed alone. \r\nBased on the foregoing, the family court did not err in\r\n  determining Husband failed to carry his burden of proof to show Wife and\r\n  Boyfriend engaged in continued cohabitation for ninety or more consecutive days\r\n  pursuant to section 20-3-130(B)(1).Â  See Nasser-Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. at\r\n  190-91, 612 S.E.2d at 711 (noting the\r\n  family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony\r\n  and the appellant bears the burden of convincing this Court that the family\r\n  court committed error).\r\nHusband\r\n  also maintains the family courtâ€™s decision not to terminate alimony should be\r\n  reversed because Wifeâ€™s and Boyfriendâ€™s relationship was tantamount to\r\n  marriage.Â  Husbandâ€™s complaint listed two grounds for termination of alimony.Â \r\n  First, pursuant to section 20-3-170 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) a\r\n  family court may terminate an award of alimony when the circumstances of the\r\n  parties have changed.Â  Husband argued the change in circumstances is that Wife\r\n  and Boyfriendâ€™s relationship is tantamount to marriage.Â  Second, Husband relied\r\n  on the continued cohabitation for ninety or more\r\n  consecutive days pursuant to section 20-3-130(B)(1) to terminate alimony.Â  In\r\n  its order, the family court stated, â€œThe [Husband] did not prove . . . [Wife]\r\n  is co-habitating with [Boyfriend] as defined in [section 20-3-130] nor did . .\r\n  . [Husband] provide any proof . . . [Wife] and [Boyfriend] were attempting to\r\n  circumvent the ninety (90) day rule as contemplated by [section 20-3-130] . . .\r\n  .â€ The family court never ruled on whether Wifeâ€™s and Boyfriendâ€™s relationship\r\n  was tantamount to marriage.Â  In South Carolina for an issue to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review it must be raised to and ruled upon by the lower court. Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding for an issue to be preserved for appeal it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the lower court).Â  Thus, this issue is not preserved\r\n  for our review.Â  \r\nAdditionally, South Carolina case law clearly states â€œ[a] party must file [a rule 59(e)] motion\r\n  when an issue or argument has been raised, but not ruled on, in order to\r\n  preserve it for appellate review.â€Â  Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (emphasis in original).Â  In the\r\n  present case Husband failed to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion when the family\r\n  court did not rule on whether Boyfriendâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s relationship\r\n  was tantamount to marriage.Â  Consequently, this issue is not preserved for\r\n  review.Â  Id.\r\nHusband\r\n  also argues the family courtâ€™s final ruling is contradicted by its ruling at\r\n  the directed verdict stage.Â  At the conclusion of Husbandâ€™s case-in-chief, Wife\r\n  made a motion for a directed verdict.Â  The family court denied this motion.Â  In\r\n  so doing, the family court held there was some evidence of cohabitation,\r\n  presumably based on the testimony of Caulder.Â  In its final ruling, the family\r\n  court held Husband failed to provide â€œany proofâ€ that Wife and Boyfriend were\r\n  attempting to circumvent the ninety day requirement of section 20-3-130.Â \r\n  Husband maintains these two rulings are contradictory.Â Â  Because Husband fails\r\n  to cite authority in support of his argument, we consider the argument\r\n  abandoned.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (holding statements made without supporting authority are\r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal and are not presented for review).\r\nII. Wifeâ€™s Appeal \r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  As a\r\n  result of this litigation, Wife has incurred attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of\r\n  $22,038.05.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  family court has discretion in deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, and\r\n  its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. Â Donahue\r\n    v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on\r\n  factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96,\r\n  97 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider the\r\n  following: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective\r\n  financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of\r\n  living. Â E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  If an\r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees is appropriate, the reasonableness of the fees should\r\n  be determined according to: (1)\r\n    the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily\r\n    devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the\r\n    contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6)\r\n  the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nIn adjudicating Wifeâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees, the\r\n  family court stated, â€œUnder the fact enunciated in Glasscock v. Glasscock . . . each party should be responsible for their own attorney fees and costs as\r\n  a result of this litigation.â€Â  The family court failed to make any findings\r\n  regarding whether Wife was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees under the factors set\r\n  out in E.D.M. v. T.A.M.Â  Rather, the family\r\n    court considered the Glasscock factors which deal with determining the reasonableness\r\n    of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Therefore, the issue of whether Wife is entitled to\r\n    attorneyâ€™s fees is remanded back to the family court so that it may consider\r\n    the factors set out in E.D.M. v. T.A.M.Â  If the family court determines\r\n    Wife is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees, it should then consider the reasonableness\r\n    of such fees based on the Glasscock factors. \r\nThe family court should comply with Rule\r\n  26(a), SCRFC, which states, â€œAn order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic\r\n  relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522,\r\n  524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991) (reversing and remanding a case back to the\r\n  family court because the family courtâ€™s order failed to comply with Rule 26(a),\r\n  SCRFC, in that the family court listed the factors to be considered for child\r\n  support and stated it had considered them but failed to make findings of facts\r\n  concerning those factors).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Boyfriendâ€™s business is entitled Decorative Concrete\r\n  and Design Incorporated, which specializes in concrete dÃ©cor.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4453","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father\r\n  are parents of twin girls born in 1999.Â  DSS filed an intervention action in\r\n  2006 pursuant to section 20-7-738 of the South Carolina Code contending Father\r\n  posed a threat of abuse or neglect to Children.Â  However, the trial focused\r\n  primarily on allegations of sexual abuse by Father as to one Child. Â Mother and\r\n  Father had been living separate and apart for approximately three years at the\r\n  time of trial.Â  \r\nChild testified at\r\n  trial, but did not reveal any sexual abuse by Father at that time.Â  Father\r\n  elected not to cross-examine Child.Â  Dr. Deborah Reyes testified on behalf of DSS.Â \r\n  Dr. Reyes testified she was the Director of Clinical Services for the Dickerson Center for Children, a non-profit child advocacy center.Â  Her qualifications\r\n  included a Masterâ€™s degree and Ph.D. in clinical psychology as well as numerous\r\n  courses in forensic interviewing.Â  She became licensed by the state of South Carolina the Friday prior to the trial of this case.Â  Dr. Reyes testified she\r\n  conducted a forensic interview with Child after another Dickerson Center staff person reported a â€œproblematic non-disclosure.â€[2]Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Reyes testified Child made the following disclosures in response to\r\n  questioning:\r\n\r\n  At this\r\n    point, I asked her if anyone had touched her private.Â  She said yes.Â  When I\r\n    asked her to tell me about that, she said, â€œMy daddy.â€Â  I asked her what did\r\n    her daddy do and then she said . . . â€œthat he put a card on there from the cow\r\n    place[3] and that daddy use to bite us on the butt.â€Â  \r\n\r\nDr.\r\n  Reyes further testified Child told her Father had touched her with the card â€œon\r\n  the inside and that it felt bad on her private part.â€Â  Finally, Dr. Reyes\r\n  indicated Child said Father had touched her â€œhinnyâ€ many times, and â€œDaddy put\r\n  a car inside.â€Â  \r\nFather objected to Dr.\r\n  Reyesâ€™ testifying about Childâ€™s hearsay statements during the interview.Â  However,\r\n  the family court allowed the statements relying on section 19-1-180 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, which makes hearsay statements by children in abuse and neglect\r\n  cases admissible under certain circumstances.\r\nMother also\r\n  testified concerning a prior hearsay statement by Child regarding alleged\r\n  sexual abuse.Â  Mother stated Child told her Father â€œhad put his mouth on her\r\n  private.â€Â  Father objected to the admission of this testimony, but the family\r\n  court determined section 19-1-180(G) did not prohibit the admission of such\r\n  testimony as long as the hearsay statement was made prior to Mother and Fatherâ€™s\r\n  separation.\r\nDetective Cathryn Bell of the Chester County Sheriffâ€™s Office testified Child told her â€œDaddy rolled up a\r\n  cow place card, and he put it in my hoochie.â€Â  Detective Bell understood Childâ€™s\r\n  reference to â€œhoochieâ€ to mean Childâ€™s vaginal area.Â  Detective Bell further testified, over Fatherâ€™s objection, there was probable cause to leave the\r\n  criminal case against Father open.Â  \r\nDr. Patricia Tonkawitz,\r\n  Childâ€™s pediatrician, conducted a physical exam of Child, which yielded normal\r\n  findings.Â  Over Fatherâ€™s objection, Dr. Tonkawitz also testified about a\r\n  portion of her report in which she indicated Motherâ€™s history regarding Child was\r\n  â€œconvincing.â€\r\nThe\r\n  family court determined Children faced a threat of harm of sexual abuse from\r\n  Father and ordered visitation between Father and Children be supervised by\r\n  Fatherâ€™s parents.Â  Furthermore, the court ordered Father to attend parenting\r\n  classes and undergo mental health and sexual predator evaluations.Â  The case\r\n  was set for further review in three months.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the\r\n  authority to correct errors of law and to find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â However, this broad scope\r\n  of review does not require this court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.â€Â  Mr. T v. Ms. T, 378\r\n  S.C. 127, 131-32, 662 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct.

Morris, 376 S.C. 189, 205, 656 S.E.2d 359, 368 (2008).Â  The\r\n  trial court abuses its discretion when that decision is based upon an error of\r\n  law or upon factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id. at 206, 656 S.E.2d at 368.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS[4]\r\nThis appeal concerns the admission of testimonial evidence\r\n  involving both matters of law and matters that were within the discretion of the\r\n  family court judge.Â  The controlling statute at issue is section 19-1-180 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007).Â  The statute considers how the court will\r\n  address otherwise inadmissible out-of-court statements by children under twelve\r\n  in a family court proceeding regarding allegations of abuse and neglect.\r\n\r\n  An out-of-court\r\n    statement may be admitted . . . if:  \r\n  \r\n    (1) the child testifies at the proceeding\r\n      or testifies by means of videotaped deposition or closed-circuit television,\r\n      and at the time of the testimony the child is subject to cross-examination about\r\n      the statement or:\r\n    (2)(a) the child\r\n      is found by the court to be unavailable to testify on any of these grounds:\r\n    \r\n      (i) the childâ€™s death;\r\n      (ii) the childâ€™s physical or mental\r\n        disability;\r\n      (iii) the existence of a privilege\r\n        involving the child;\r\n      (iv) the childâ€™s incompetency, including\r\n        the childâ€™s inability to communicate about the offense because of fear;\r\n      (v) substantial likelihood that the child\r\n        would suffer severe emotional trauma from testifying at the proceeding or by\r\n        means of videotaped deposition or closed-circuit television; and\r\n    \r\n    (b) the childâ€™s out-of-court statement is\r\n      shown to possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 19-1-180(B). The statute also attempts to protect against the\r\n  admission of a childâ€™s accusations that could be motivated by the malice of one\r\n  parent for the other.\r\n\r\n  If\r\n    the parents of the child are separated or divorced, the hearsay statement shall\r\n    be inadmissible if (1) one of the parents is the alleged perpetrator of the alleged\r\n    abuse or neglect and (2) the allegation was made after the parties separated or\r\n    divorced. Notwithstanding this subsection, a statement alleging abuse or\r\n    neglect made by a child to a law enforcement official, an officer of the court,\r\n    a licensed family counselor or therapist, a physician or other health care\r\n    provider, a teacher, a school counselor, a Department of Social Services staff\r\n    member, or to a child care worker in a regulated child care facility is\r\n    admissible under this section.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 19-1-180(G).\r\nI. Objections to\r\n  TestimonyÂ  \r\nA. Dr.\r\n  Reyesâ€™ Testimony\r\nFather\r\n  contends Dr. Reyesâ€™ testimony regarding Childâ€™s statements was not admissible\r\n  under this statute, because Childâ€™s testimony was not found to be trustworthy\r\n  by the family court.Â  We disagree. Â The admission of Dr. Reyesâ€™ testimony\r\n  appears to be proper under section\r\n  19-1-180(B)(1).Â  Child testified at trial\r\n  and was subject to cross-examination.Â  Therefore, pursuant to section 19-1-180(B)(1), there was no requirement Child be found\r\n  unavailable or the family court conduct an analysis of the trustworthiness of\r\n  those statements.Â  See Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Father, Stepmother &amp; Mother, 317 S.C. 283, 289, 454 S.E.2d\r\n  307, 310 (1995) (approving admission of childâ€™s hearsay statements in absence\r\n  of trustworthiness analysis when child testified at trial).\r\nFather\r\n  further argues if Dr. Reyesâ€™ testimony regarding Childâ€™s statements was\r\n  admissible under part (B) of the statute, it was excluded under part (G) of the\r\n  statute because she was not a licensed family counselor or therapist at the\r\n  time she interviewed Child.Â  We agree.Â  The family court considered this\r\n  argument and determined Dr. Reyes fell with the ambit of persons covered by the\r\n  statute as either a health care provider or a therapist.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  family court relied upon Dr. Reyesâ€™ experience and qualifications and her\r\n  subsequent licensure to establish the credibility and reliability of her\r\n  testimony.Â  \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and\r\n  effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C.\r\n  79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  Here, the\r\n  family court concluded the term therapist was not necessarily modified by\r\n  licensed in the statute.Â  We disagree with this finding. Â The intent of the overall statute is to aid in the\r\n  protection of children from abuse and neglect by permitting the introduction of\r\n  their hearsay statements.Â  However, the purpose of part (G) is to protect a\r\n  parent from potentially false accusations instigated by the other parent as\r\n  part of a contentious divorce or custody battle. Â To conclude the\r\n  legislature intended the testimony of unlicensed therapists to be admitted is\r\n  inconsistent with the intent to limit the admission of hearsay statements.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  finding Dr. Reyes fell within the category of healthcare providers is again\r\n  inconsistent with the statute.Â  The legislature placed a licensure requirement\r\n  on mental health professionals that cannot be disregarded by categorizing Dr.\r\n  Reyes as both a therapist and a healthcare provider.Â  While mental health is\r\n  undoubtedly part of a childâ€™s overall well-being, the legislature separated the\r\n  groups in the statute thereby making a distinction between the groups that we\r\n  cannot ignore.\r\nEven\r\n  though we disagree with the family courtâ€™s analysis of this issue, we may still\r\n  affirm the admission of Childâ€™s statements through Dr. Reyes if there is\r\n  another basis in the record for doing so.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR.Â  At\r\n  trial, DSS also contended Dr. Reyesâ€™ testimony was admissible because she was\r\n  licensed at the time of trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIf a\r\n  statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite\r\n  meaning, rules of statutory interpretation are not necessary, and the court has\r\n  no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581.Â  In this\r\n  case, part (G) makes admissible hearsay statements â€œmade by a child to . . . a licensed family counselor or therapist.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The plain language of the statute indicates\r\n  licensure is required at the time the statement by the child is made.Â  The\r\n  record is clear Dr. Reyes was not licensed at the time she interviewed Child,\r\n  although she was undergoing the licensing process.Â  Consequently, Childâ€™s\r\n  hearsay statements to Dr. Reyes were inadmissible.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Father contends Dr. Reyes improperly commented on Childâ€™s credibility by saying\r\n  Child â€œhad no apparent motivation . . . to have a false allegation,â€ and Child\r\n  gave a â€œconsistent disclosure.â€Â  For a psychologist\r\n  to comment on the veracity of a childâ€™s accusations of sexual abuse is improper.Â  State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 393-94, 377 S.E.2d 298, 302 (1989) (finding\r\n  therapist indicating he believed victimâ€™s allegations were genuine was improper); see also State v. Dempsey, 340 S.C. 565, 571, 532 S.E.2d 306, 309\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (finding therapistâ€™s testimony children were being truthful in\r\n  ninety-five percent of instances in which sexual abuse was alleged was improper\r\n  vouching for child).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Father made no contemporaneous objection when Dr. Reyes\r\n  testified Child had no reason to make a false allegation and Child did not\r\n  appear to have been coached.Â  Consequently, any error regarding those specific\r\n  comments as to truthfulness is not preserved.Â  See State v. Hoffman,\r\n  312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (holding a contemporaneous\r\n  objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review).Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  Father did object to Dr. Reyesâ€™ testifying Child gave a â€œconsistent disclosure\r\n  about her putting a card in her vaginal area bitting [sic] her butt and putting\r\n  a car in her rectum.â€Â  In the recent case of State v. Douglas, 367 S.C.\r\n  498, 505, 626 S.E.2d 59, 63 (2006) cert. granted, June 7, 2007, a\r\n  witness, Herod, qualified as an expert in forensic interviewing of sexual\r\n  assault victims, testified that after interviewing a child she recommended a\r\n  medical exam.Â  Douglas argued this testimony improperly bolstered the Stateâ€™s\r\n  case as it would lead a jury to believe the expert considered childâ€™s accusations\r\n  truthful.Â  This court concluded: â€œAlthough the jury could infer Herod thought\r\n  the victim told her the truth about being molested, . . . Herod did not express\r\n  her opinion as to whether or not the victim told her the truth during the\r\n  interview.â€Â  Id. at 522, 626 S.E.2d at 72.Â  Consequently, Herodâ€™s\r\n  testimony did not improperly comment on the childâ€™s credibility.\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, in this case, Dr. Reyes indicated Child gave a consistent disclosure\r\n  and that as a result of that conclusion she recommended therapy.Â  Dr. Reyesâ€™\r\n  testimony seems fill the inferential gap that made Herodâ€™s testimony in Douglas admissible.Â  There is little doubt Dr. Reyes found Childâ€™s testimony to be\r\n  credible, and testimony to that effect is inadmissible.[5] Â \r\nB. Motherâ€™s Testimony\r\nFather\r\n  contends the family court erred in allowing Mother to testify regarding Childâ€™s\r\n  accusations against Father.Â  The family court concluded part (G) of the statute\r\n  did not prohibit the introduction of such statements because Child made them to\r\n  Mother prior to Mother and Fatherâ€™s separation.Â  Part (G) states the â€œhearsay statement shall be inadmissible if (1) one of the parents\r\n  is the alleged perpetrator of the alleged abuse or neglect and (2) the allegation was made after the parties separated or divorced.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Because\r\n  the statute is considering the\r\n  hearsay statement by the child, allegation could refer to the statement by\r\n  Child to Mother.Â  However, allegation could also refer to the repetition of\r\n  Childâ€™s hearsay statement by Mother at the hearing.\r\nIf a\r\n  statute is susceptible to two reasonable interpretations, it is ambiguous.Â  See Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 489, 636\r\n  S.E.2d 598, 617 (2006) (Toal, C.J., dissenting).Â  When â€œa statute is ambiguous,\r\n  the Court must construe the terms of the statute.â€Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586,588 (2002).Â  As previously stated, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to discern\r\n  and give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d at 581.Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to\r\n  the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably\r\n  discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in light\r\n  of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Commâ€™n, 342 S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000). \r\nAs discussed above, the purpose of part (G) of the statute is to\r\n  protect a parent from potentially false accusations instigated by the other parent.Â  In this case, to allow Mother to testify\r\n  after the separation regarding statements made before the separation undermines\r\n  the purpose of this part.Â  In promoting false allegations, a parent could simply\r\n  claim allegations were made by the child prior to separation simply to evade\r\n  the purview of the statute.Â  Part (G) protects against accusations potentially\r\n  arising from the acrimony of separation; therefore, if the witness is\r\n  testifying after the separation the danger for false allegations still exists.Â \r\n  Consequently, we conclude the admission of Childâ€™s hearsay statement to Mother\r\n  was error.\r\nC. Detective\r\n  Bellâ€™s Testimony\r\nFather\r\n  contends the family court erred in allowing Detective Bell to testify regarding\r\n  Childâ€™s hearsay statements.Â  We disagree. Â As discussed with regard to Dr.\r\n  Reyesâ€™ testimony, Child was available to testify so that Childâ€™s hearsay\r\n  statements were admissible under (B)(1).Â  There is no argument that Detective\r\n  Bellâ€™s testimony should have been excluded under part (G) as she clearly falls\r\n  with the category of law enforcement official.\r\nFather\r\n  also appeals the admission of Detective Bellâ€™s testimony that the Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department had â€œprobable causeâ€ to keep open its criminal investigation of\r\n  Father.Â  Fatherâ€™s objection at trial and on appeal is based on relevance.Â  Rule\r\n  401 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence defines relevant evidence as â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of\r\n  any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\r\n  probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€ Â In the instant case, Detective Bellâ€™s opinion the criminal\r\n  case should remain open does not make any specific fact of consequence more or\r\n  less probable.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  even if Detective Bellâ€™s opinion was relevant, all relevant evidence is not\r\n  admissible.Â  â€œ[T]he dictates\r\n  of Rule 401 are subject to the balancing requirement of Rule 403, SCRE, which\r\n  requires a court to exclude relevant evidence upon a showing that its admission\r\n  would be more prejudicial than probative.â€ Â Jamison v. Ford Motor Co.,\r\n  373 S.C. 248, 269, 644 S.E.2d 755, 766 (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Watson ex rel. Watson v. Chapman, 343 S.C. 471, 478, 540 S.E.2d 484, 487\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000)); see also Rule 403,\r\n  SCRE (â€œAlthough relevant, evidence\r\n  may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or\r\n  by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\n  cumulative evidence.â€).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, nothing indicates the family court conducted a prejudicial\r\n  versus probative analysis.Â  Evidence is unfairly prejudicial in the context of\r\n  Rule 403, if the evidence has an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an\r\n  improper basis, such as an emotional one.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114,\r\n  127, 551 S.E.2d 240, 247 (2001).Â  In this case, Detective Bellâ€™s testimony\r\n  suggests Father is guilty of sexual misconduct against Child and is highly\r\n  prejudicial.Â  For the fact-finder to make a determination based on the\r\n  Detectiveâ€™s opinion of guilt would be improper.Â  Therefore, we conclude the\r\n  admission of this evidence was error.Â Â Â Â  \r\nD. Dr. Tonkawitzâ€™s Testimony\r\nFather\r\n  also claims the family court erred in admitting pediatrician Dr. Tonkawitzâ€™s\r\n  testimony the history provided by Mother when Child was brought for examination\r\n  was â€œconvincing.â€Â  We agree.Â  As previously discussed, an expert is not to\r\n  comment on the veracity of another witnessâ€™s statements.Â  Dawkins, 297\r\n  S.C. at 393-94, 377 S.E.2d at 302; Dempsey, 340 S.C. at 571, 532 S.E.2d at\r\n  309.Â  Tonkawitz should not have been\r\n  allowed to give her opinion as to Motherâ€™s truthfulness regarding Childâ€™s\r\n  medical history.Â  Such observation is reserved for the trier of fact, in this\r\n  case, the family court. See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Forrester,\r\n  282 S.C. 512, 516, 320 S.E.2d 39, 42 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œThe credibility of\r\n  testimony is a matter for the finder of fact to judge.â€).Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Shifting of\r\n  Burden of Proof\r\nFather contends the family court shifted the burden of\r\n  proof, requiring him to prove his innocence.Â  In a DSS intervention case, DSS has\r\n  the burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  142, 143 (1991).Â  The family courtâ€™s order addresses the defense put forth by\r\n  Father including the negative psychological testing for pedophilic tendencies\r\n  and Childâ€™s negative physical examination.Â  The family court concluded this\r\n  evidence could not rule out the possibility of sexual abuse.Â  This language is\r\n  somewhat problematic, but viewing the order as a whole, the family court relied\r\n  upon the evidence presented by DSS in reaching its conclusion.Â  The order\r\n  enumerates the testimony of the witnesses indicating Child made disclosures of\r\n  abuse as well as considering Childâ€™s demeanor on the witness stand.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the order cites to evidence showing Child was acting out sexually and was\r\n  experiencing nightmares.Â  Overall, it does not appear the family court\r\n  impermissibly shifted the burden to Father.Â  The order simply addresses all of\r\n  the evidence put forth before it including Fatherâ€™s and Childâ€™s negative test\r\n  results.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the\r\n  admission of Childâ€™s hearsay statements through Dr. Reyes was erroneous in\r\n  light of section 19-1-180(G).Â  We find\r\n  comments by Dr. Reyes regarding Childâ€™s credibility were likewise inadmissible.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Motherâ€™s testimony regarding Childâ€™s hearsay statements was also inadmissible\r\n  under section 19-1-180(G).Â  Additionally, comments by Dr. Tonkawitz regarding\r\n  Motherâ€™s credibility were inadmissible.Â  Finally, the admission of Detective\r\n  Bellâ€™s opinion as to probable cause in Fatherâ€™s criminal case was error.Â  The\r\n  sum of these errors warrants reversal of the family courtâ€™s order.Â  This case\r\n  is therefore\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON\r\nAND WILLIAMS, J.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Before we begin our analysis, we emphasize this case\r\n  involves the interpretation of a very specific statute dealing with the\r\n  introduction of a childâ€™s hearsay statements in the context of a DSS\r\n  intervention action.Â  Any conclusions should be strictly ascribed to the\r\n  application of this statute and should not be extrapolated with respect to the\r\nadmission or exclusion of hearsay statements in the criminal context.\r\n[2] Dr. Reyes described a problematic non-disclosure as\r\n  an interview in which a child may deny improper touching, but there are\r\nproblems with the way the child answers the questions.Â  \r\n[3] Testimony revealed Child referred to the restaurant\r\nChick-Fil-A as the cow place.\r\n[4] Father raises issues that apply to the testimony of\r\n  several different witnesses.Â  For the sake of organization we will address each\r\nwitnessâ€™ testimony in turn and each argument related thereto.\r\n[5] We note Dr. Reyes was never actually qualified as an\r\n  expert in either clinical psychology or forensic interviewing although such a\r\n  motion was made and her experience and education were presented to the family\r\ncourt.Â  Her status as an expert is not raised on appeal.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
