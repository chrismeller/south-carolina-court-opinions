Some time after the accident occurred, Albert Chatfield, III, was driving on the exit ramp and had to swerve into the right lane in order to avoid Shulerâ€™s car, the trunk of which was protruding into the road. Chatfield testified that he was â€œnot very sureâ€ of what time it was when he discovered Shulerâ€™s car, but guessed it was somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.Â  Because Shulerâ€™s windows were very tinted and her doors were locked, Chatfield did not realize anyone was in the vehicle, but he called 911 because Shulerâ€™s vehicle posed a hazard for other motorists. \r\nTrooper Brian E. Kyzer from the South Carolina Highway Patrol responded to Chatfieldâ€™s call and arrived at the scene at 8:27 p.m.Â  Â When Trooper Kyzer arrived, he shined a flashlight into Shulerâ€™s car and saw that she was inside, slumped toward the passengerâ€™s seat.Â  He called an ambulance, but Shulerâ€™s injuries were fatal.Â  \r\nThe parties dispute Shulerâ€™s activities between the time she left the doctorâ€™s office and the time Shulerâ€™s car was found.Â  Trooper Kyzer testified that he found bags from a grocery store and a dollar store in Shulerâ€™s backseat and that Shulerâ€™s daughter had told him Shuler planned to go shopping after her visit to the doctor.[1]Â  Based on his investigation, Trooper Kyzer surmised that the accident occurred at 8:15 p.m., give or take a few minutes. \r\nThe single commissioner awarded benefits to Shulerâ€™s husband and her dependent children, finding the accident arose out of and in the course of her employment.Â  In making this finding, the commissioner noted that Shuler was bound by the terms of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act at the time of the accident and that she could have lost her right to weekly benefits if she failed to receive the authorized medical treatment as directed. The single commissioner further found that Shulerâ€™s car could have been on the side of the road for some time before it was discovered, that Trooper Kyzerâ€™s estimated time of the accident was not based on any personal knowledge, and that the exact time of Shulerâ€™s accident could never be definitively established.Â  The commissioner took judicial notice ofÂ  â€œthe fact that 6:30 â€“ 7:30 p.m. is considered by many to be the â€˜supper hour,â€™â€ and found that even if Shuler stopped at a grocery store after her visit to the doctorâ€™s office, â€œsuch a stop would be insubstantial and would be covered under the allowed â€˜personal comfortâ€™ deviation.â€Â  Finally, the commissioner found that Shuler was being paid mileage by Employer for this trip to her physical therapist and doctor.Â  \r\nEmployer appealed to the full commission, which adopted the single commissionerâ€™s order verbatim.Â  Employer then appealed to the circuit court, which also affirmed the award of benefits.Â  The circuit court found that because Employer reimbursed Shuler for mileage while traveling to the doctorâ€™s office, her accident fell within an exception to the general rule that an employee is not covered by workersâ€™ compensation while traveling to and from work.Â  The circuit court also found Shuler was performing a special errand by visiting her physical therapist and doctor, which qualified her trip for another recognized exception to the going and coming rule.Â  While the circuit court disagreed that Shulerâ€™s trip to the store fell within the personal comfort doctrine, it found she was entitled to benefits because at the time of the accident she had resumed her business route.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, it is a question of fact whether an injury arose out of and was in the scope of employment.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 159, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  Because causation is a question of fact, the full commissionâ€™s decision on the issue must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Id. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  However, we may reverse or modify the commissionâ€™s decision if it is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288-89, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Substantial evidence is that which, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the full commission reached.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Arising Out of and in the Scope of EmploymentÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nEmployer first argues Shulerâ€™s accident, which occurred on her way home from an unscheduled, unannounced doctorâ€™s appointment, neither arose out of nor was in the scope of her employment as an electricianâ€™s helper.Â  In support of its argument, Employer cites to Douglas v. Spartan Mills, Startex Div., 245 S.C. 265, 140 S.E.2d 173 (1965). \r\nIn Douglas, the claimant sustained a compensable injury while working as a doffer at a mill and received temporary disability benefits.Â  He returned to work, but filed a claim seeking additional benefits for permanent partial disability and disfigurement.Â  Id. at 266-267, 140 S.E.2d at 173-174.Â  A hearing was set for the morning of September 20, 1965, but claimant misread the notice and reported for work that morning.Â  Id. at 267, 140 S.E.2d at 174.Â  Claimantâ€™s attorney called the mill, and claimantâ€™s supervisor notified him of his hearing and allowed him to leave.Â  Claimant went home, changed clothes, and was on his way to the hearing when his steering gear failed, and he ran into a bridge abutment.Â  Claimant sought workersâ€™ compensation benefits for the injuries he sustained in the accident, and the single commissioner, full commission, and circuit court all agreed that he was entitled to benefits.Â  Id.Â  However, the supreme court reversed, finding the accident did not arise in the course of employment.Â  Specifically, the court stated: â€œThe causative danger here was the defective steering apparatus on the claimantâ€™s automobile, which we think was clearly independent of the relation of master and servant and not incidental to the character of the business or the employment.â€Â  Id. at 269, 140 S.E.2d at 175.Â  The court further noted that â€œ[t]he only connection which the employer had with the particular accident was that the employer cooperated with and accommodated the claimant and his attorney in notifying the claimant and letting him off from work for the purpose of attending a hearing which claimant had sought for his own benefit.â€Â  Id. at 270, 140 S.E.2d at 175.\r\nLike the claimant in Douglas, Employer points out that Shuler was operating her personal vehicle at the time of the accident and was exposed only to the dangers of driving an automobile on a public road.Â  However, unlike the claimant in Douglas, Shuler was traveling from a medical visit, albeit unplanned, that was necessitated by her previous compensable injury.Â  Because she was bound by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, she was required to visit this particular doctorâ€™s office in Columbia or she risked losing her benefits.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985) (â€œThe refusal of an employee to accept any medical, hospital, surgical or other treatment when provided by the employer or ordered by the Commission shall bar such employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases . . . unless in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances justified the refusal . . . .â€).\r\nNot only is Douglas distinguishable from the case at hand, but so too are all reported South Carolina cases.Â  Thus, we consider jurisprudence from other jurisdictions to determine the compensability of additional injuries a claimant sustains while journeying to or from a doctorâ€™s office for a previous work-related injury.Â  Although there is authority to the contrary,[2] most states that have addressed this issue find an injury suffered during such a journey is compensable.Â  1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, Â§ 10.07 (Compensable Consequences) (2004).Â  \r\nIn Taylor v. Centex Constr. Co., 379 P.2d 217 (Kan. 1963), the Kansas Supreme Court held that an injury sustained by an employee while traveling to medical treatment for a prior compensable injury arose out of and in the course of employment.Â  In Taylor, claimant suffered an eye injury while working for Centex Construction as a cement mason foreman.Â  Centex allowed him to visit a doctor for his injury, which claimant did.Â  On his way back from the doctor, claimant had his truck greased at his sonâ€™s service station and ate lunch.Â  He then stopped by a convenience store, purchased a drink, and when he was within two miles of his job site, he collided with a road sweeper, sustaining serious injuries to his knee.Â  Id. at 218.Â  In finding that claimantâ€™s knee injuries were compensable, the Kansas Supreme Court noted that pursuant to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, an employer is under a duty to furnish medical care.Â  Likewise, an employee is under a duty to submit to reasonable medical treatment.Â  These statutory duties become part of the employment contract by implication, and therefore, an accidental injury sustained while en route to or from treatment for a compensable injury is work related because it is made pursuant to contractual obligations.Â  Id. at 221.Â  \r\nWe agree with the reasoning set forth in Taylor.Â  Under the law of workersâ€™ compensation, employers must furnish, and employees must submit to, medical treatment for work-related injuries.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-15-60 and 42-15-80 (Supp. 2004).Â  Thus, when an employer authorizes an employee to seek medical attention for a prior injury and the employee sustains additional injuries while fulfilling her obligation to submit to medical treatment, such additional injuries are sufficiently causally related to employment to be compensable.Â  See also Font v. New York City Bd. of Educ, 566 N.Y.S.2d 754, 755 (1991) (holding that injuries claimant suffered while traveling to a doctorâ€™s office for treatment of another compensable injury were work-related and compensable); Moreau v. Zayre Corp., 408 A.2d 1289, 1293-94 (Me. 1979) (awarding benefits to claimant who was injured in an automobile accident while driving home after receiving medical treatment for a previously compensable hand injury because the employee had a correlative duty to accept medical treatment for the initial compensable injury and therefore was fulfilling an implied duty of the employment contract when she got into the accident); Bero v. Workmenâ€™s Comp. Appeal Bd., 645 A.2d 342, 345 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1994) (finding that â€œbut-forâ€ driving to his physical therapist for treatment of his work-related injury, claimant would not have been in the car accident that caused additional injuries, and therefore the additional injuries were compensable).[3]\r\nHere, Shulerâ€™s fatal accident occurred while she was fulfilling her duty to submit to treatment for a previous compensable injury.Â  Thus, her subsequent injuries arose out of and were in the scope of her employment.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  â€œGoing and Comingâ€ Rule\r\nEmployer next argues the circuit court erred by finding Shulerâ€™s accident fell within an exception to the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule.Â  Under this rule, an employee who is going to or coming from work is generally not considered to be engaged in performing any service growing out of or incidental to employment, and therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such a time does not arise out of and in the course of employment.Â  McDaniel v. Bus Terminal Rest. Mgmt. Corp., 271 S.C. 299, 247 S.E.2d 321 (1978)).Â  As discussed above, we believe Shuler was, at the time of her accident, performing a service that was incidental to her employment in that she was fulfilling her obligation under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act to submit to treatment.Â  Thus, her injuries were sufficiently related to her employment so as to place the accident outside the parameters of the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Intervening Personal Deviations\r\nFinally, Employer argues the award of death benefits should be reversed because of the intervening personal deviations between the time Shuler left the doctorâ€™s office and the time of her accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe full commission found that even if Shuler stopped by the grocery store after her treatment in order to purchase supper for her family, such a deviation was â€œinsubstantial and would be covered under the allowed â€˜personal comfortâ€™ [doctrine].â€Â  The circuit court found this ruling was erroneous because the application of the personal comfort doctrine â€œhas consistently been limited to imperative acts such as eating, drinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort, preparing to begin or quit work, and resting or sleeping.â€Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Schoool District, 333 S.C. 43, 47-48, 508 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).Â  However, the circuit court found Shulerâ€™s injuries were compensable even in light of her deviation to the store because at the time of her accident, she had returned to the route of the business trip.Â Â  \r\nUpon reviewing the record, we note the commission never actually found Shuler had deviated from her route to go shopping.Â  Rather, the commission first found that the time of the accident could never be clearly established and that Shuler may have stopped to eat dinner between 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.Â  Only after making those findings did the commission go on to find that even if Shuler did stop by the grocery store to buy dinner for her family, such a trip would be encompassed by the personal comfort doctrine. \r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record supporting the commissionâ€™s findings.Â  See Gibson v. Spartanburg School Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 516, 526 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œIn an appeal from the Commission, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.â€).Â  No one witnessed Shulerâ€™s accident, and as the Good Samaritan who called in the accident testified, numerous cars drove around Shulerâ€™s wrecked vehicle without calling authorities.Â  Thus, her car may have been on the road for a substantial period of time before Trooper Kyzer investigated the scene.Â  Furthermore, although Trooper Kyzer testified that Shulerâ€™s daughter told him her mother planned to stop at the grocery store after her doctorâ€™s visit, when Shulerâ€™s daughter testified, she denied ever saying such a thing.Â  There was no evidence presented regarding how long the shopping bags had been in Shulerâ€™s backseat or whether the bags contained perishable items.Â  Thus, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Shuler did not deviate from her business trip. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find Shulerâ€™s death resulted from an accident arising from and in the course of her employment.Â  The going and coming rule does not preclude her from receiving benefits, and there is substantial evidence Shuler did not deviate from her route home.Â  Accordingly, the award of benefits is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs, and KITTREDGE, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent, for I believe that Linda Shulerâ€™s November 18, 2001, motor vehicle accidentâ€”following the unscheduled doctorâ€™s appointmentâ€”did not arise out of and in the course of her employment with Gregory Electric.Â  I would reverse.\r\nSince the essential facts are undisputed, the question before us is one of law.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).\r\nÂ The disposition of this appeal requires a proper understanding and application of the statutory requirement that an injury, to be compensable, must â€œaris[e] out of and in the course of the employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2004).Â  I find our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Douglas v. Spartan Mills, Startex Division, 245 S.C. 265, 140 S.E.2d 173 (1965), persuasive, both factually and legally.\r\nThere, David Douglas filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against his employer, Spartan Mills.Â  The Industrial Commission, predecessor to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, scheduled a hearing at the Spartanburg Courthouse on the morning of September 20, 1961.Â  Douglas misread the hearing notice and reported for work that morning at the Startex plant.Â  A supervisor notified Douglas of the hearing about one hour before the hearing was to begin.Â  Douglas left work, drove home to change clothes and then headed to the courthouse, about a three-mile drive.Â  Douglas was injured in a motor vehicle accident en route to the courthouse.Â  The accident was caused by a defective steering mechanism.Â  Douglas filed a claim for compensation as a result of the September 20 accident.Â  Id. at 267, 140 S.E.2d at 174.Â  \r\nThe Commission found Douglas had sustained a compensable injury by accident, arising out of and in the course of employment.Â  Id. at 266, 140 S.E.2d at 173.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  Our supreme court reversed and held, as a matter of law, that Douglasâ€™s injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment:\r\n\r\nWhile the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act has to be construed liberally in favor of coverage, and doubtful cases should be resolved in favor of the injured employee, we think the accident here clearly did not arise out of and in the course of the employment of the claimant, within the intent of the legislature in enacting the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act. \r\n\r\nId. at 270, 140 S.E.2d at 175-176\r\nThe courtâ€™s discussion of the separate elementsâ€”â€œarising out ofâ€ and â€œin course of employmentâ€â€”is helpful in determining the compensability of Shulerâ€™s accident following her visit to the doctor on November 18, 2001.Â  Both elements must be present for an accident to be compensable, and they must be concurrent and simultaneous.Â  Id. at 268, 140 S.E.2d at 174.Â  â€œâ€˜[T]he words â€˜arising out ofâ€™ refer to the origin of the cause of the accident, while the words â€˜in the course of employment,â€™ have reference to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident occurs.â€™â€Â  Id. at 268-69, 140 S.E.2d at 175 (quoting Eargle v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 205 S.C. 423, 32 S.E.2d 240 (1944).Â  \r\nAn injury â€œarises out ofâ€ the employment when a causal connection exists between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.Â  Douglas, 245 S.C. at 269, 140 S.E.2d at 175 (quoting In re Employersâ€™ Liab. Assurance Corp., 102 N.E. 697 (Mass. 1913)).Â  The court described this causal link as follows: \r\n\r\nUnder this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises â€˜out ofâ€™ the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n    Â Id.\r\nWith respect to the requirement that the accident arise â€œin the course of employment,â€ the court explained: \r\n\r\n  An injury arises in the course of employment within the meaning of the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act when it occurs within the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties, and while he is fulfilling those duties, or engaged in doing something incidental\r\n      thereto.\r\n\r\n  Douglas, 245 S.C. at 269, 140 S.E.2d at 175 (quoting Fowler v. Abbott Motor Co., 236 S.C. 226, 113 S.E.2d 737 (1960)).\r\nApplying these rules of reason to Douglasâ€™s accident while en route from work to his workersâ€™ compensation hearing, the supreme court found the accident â€œwas clearly not a compensable one.Â  The causative danger here was the defective steering apparatus on the claimantâ€™s automobile, which we think was clearly independent of the relation of master and servant and not incidental to the character of the business or the employment.â€Â  Douglas,&nbsp;245 S.C. at 270, 140 S.E.2d at 175.Â  \r\nI think it is at least equally clear that Shulerâ€™s November 18 accident, following her doctorâ€™s visit for a prior work-related injury, lacked the requisite causal connection to her employment and was in no manner incidental to the character of her employment with Gregory Electric.Â  Under Douglas, the accident must result from some exposure peculiar to the employment, and not a hazard to which all workers are equally exposed.Â  Id. at 269, 140 S.E.2d at 175.Â  Additionally, the injury arises in the course of employment only when it occurs at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of her duties or â€œsomething incidental thereto.â€Â  Id.Â  The accident occurred while Shuler was driving her own vehicle on a public road.Â  Her duties as an employee did not require anything of her at the time and place of the accident.Â  See id. at 270, 140 S.E.2d at 175.Â  Instead, the doctorâ€™s visit was required only for compensation under the statute.Â  \r\nThe majority assigns significance to an injured employeeâ€™s statutory obligation to pursue required medical treatment as a condition of continued entitlement to workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  I do not view this â€œduty to submit to treatmentâ€ as a sufficient nexus to employment to satisfy the â€œarising out ofâ€ and â€œin course of employmentâ€ elements.Â  \r\nAn employee does not need a statute to know there is a duty to report to work, for an employee must show up at work to keep her job.Â  Yet we readily acknowledge that under normal circumstances the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule would preclude recovery to an employee injured while traveling to or from work.Â  See McDaniel v. Bus Terminal Rest. Mgmt. Corp., 271 S.C. 299, 302, 247 S.E.2d 321, 322 (1978) (holding that pursuant to the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule, injuries sustained while an employee is going to or coming from work generally are not compensable because the injuries do not arise out of and in the course of employment.)Â  The rationale for the rule is straightforwardâ€”traveling risks are those shared by public.Â  \r\nWere Shuler going to or from her job at Gregory Electric, I do not believe we would entertain the notion that an accident was work-related.Â  Application of the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule would foreclose such a claim.Â  Since the court today professes continued adherence to the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule, it seems to me that todayâ€™s policy decisionâ€”the finding of a compensable, work related injuryâ€”would serve to favor those going to or from a doctorâ€™s visit over those employees actually working who must travel to and from work.Â  I do not understand the policy reasons for elevating the rights of those going to and from the doctorâ€™s office over workers traveling to and from work.\r\nI believe that the Douglas holding and analysis controls here, and I would not resort to canvassing the law in other states, where the decisions predictably go both ways.Â  I would follow the lead of our supreme court in Douglas: \r\n\r\nIf it is the intent of the legislature to include within the terms of the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Act employees injured while engaged in activities not in the course of their employment, though arising indirectly by reason of their employment, then the Act will have to be accordingly amended.Â  \r\n\r\nDouglas,&nbsp;245 S.C. at 270-271, 140 S.E.2d at 176 (quoting Fountain v. Hartsville Oil Mill, 207 S.C. 119, 32 S.E.2d 11 (1945)).Â  See also Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc.,&nbsp;354 S.C. 100, 110, 580 S.E.2d 100, 105&nbsp;(2003) (holding that because workersâ€™ compensation statutes provide an exclusive compensatory system in derogation of common law rights, they must be strictly construed, leaving ambiguities to be resolved by the legislature).Â  \r\nThe General Assembly has yet to accept this now 40-year-old invitation to amend the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act to provide for coverage in such circumstances.Â  Nor has our supreme court sought to retreat from its holding in Douglas.Â  Based on my view of prevailing South Carolina law, I would reverse the award of workerâ€™s compensation benefits to the estate of Linda Shuler.\r\n\r\n[1] Shulerâ€™s daughter testified that she never told Trooper Kyzer her mother planned to go shopping before returning to Orangeburg. \r\n[2] See, e.g., Wyoming ex rel. Wyo. Workersâ€™ Safety &amp; Comp. Div. v. Bruhn, 951 P.2d 373, 377-78 (Wyo. 1997) (denying benefits to claimant who died while returning from treatment for a compensable injury because â€œ[t]he accident was not a hazard of her employment that she would not have been subjected to apart from her job nor did it result from a risk reasonably incident to the character of the businessâ€); Lee v. Industrial Commâ€™n, 656 N.E.2d 1084, 1088 (Ill. 1995) (refusing to award benefits for injuries claimant sustained while crossing the street after receiving treatment from an employer-approved medical clinic because the claimant was under no duty or obligation to receive treatment at the time he did); Gayler v. North Am. Van Lines, 566 N.E.2d 84 (Ind. Ct. App. 4 Dist. 1991) (denying compensation for injuries claimant suffered while on her way to pick up a piece of medical equipment that was part of her prescribed treatment for a previous work-related accident; the court found that even though the employer agreed to pay for the medical equipment and had authorized treatment, the intervening negligence of a third party broke the causal link between the claimant and her employment). \r\n[3] We acknowledge that some states, such as Florida, have a statute addressing this very issue.Â  See Fla. Stat. Â§ 440.092(5) (â€œInjuries caused by a subsequent intervening accident arising from an outside agency which are the direct and natural consequence of the original injury are not compensable unless suffered while traveling to or from a health care provider for the purpose of receiving remedial treatment for the compensable injury.â€).Â  Notably, Floridaâ€™s statute was enacted in 1990, and prior to its enactment, Florida courts had already awarded benefits to claimants who suffered injuries en route to medical treatment for a previous compensable injury.Â  See, e.g., All American Wheel World, Inc. v.

Atkinson, both of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this declaratory judgment action, Commander Health Care Facilities, Inc. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and Heritage Home of Florence.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nCommander Health Care Facilities and Heritage Home of Florence both operate nursing home facilities in Florence County.Â  In 1997, Heritage Home applied for and was granted a certificate of need by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) for the replacement of 44 Medicaid beds with 44 residential care beds.Â  In May 1998, Heritage Home applied for another certificate of need for the addition of 60 new nursing home beds to be dedicated to serving Medicaid patients. \r\nIn June 1998, the South Carolina legislature passed the 1998 Appropriation Bill, including Proviso 9.35 which appropriated funds for Medicaid patient days for the 1998-1999 fiscal year.Â  This bill, which became effective on July 1, 1998, authorized a substantial number of additional Medicaid patient days and set forth provisions for granting permits for the additional Medicaid days â€œnotwithstanding any other provision of law.â€Â  At the time this bill passed, Heritage Home had already requested approval of additional Medicaid beds through the May certificate of need. \r\nIn September 1998, DHEC Commissioner Douglas E. Bryant wrote Senator Hugh Leatherman of Florence, requesting an interpretation of Proviso 9.35.Â  As a result of that letter, Bryant and Senator Leatherman researched the legislative intent of the proviso and determined the proviso applied to currently licensed beds plus those nursing home beds issued under a 1998 certificate of need.Â  Senator Leatherman also opined in the letter that Proviso 9.35 would allow for the expansion of Medicaid beds without requiring a certificate of need.Â  Commissioner Bryant stated the â€œlegislative intent was to maximize the number of beds available.â€Â  Moreover, Albert Whiteside, Director of the Division of Planning and Certification of Need with DHEC, testified because the number of new Medicaid beds approved by the legislature in 1998 exceeded the number of requests for additional Medicaid beds from nursing homes, no application for new Medicaid beds was denied in 1998. \r\nOn October 5, 1998, DHEC authorized Heritage Home to license 44 additional Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35 and withdrew Heritage Homeâ€™s pending May 1998 certificate of need.Â  DHEC never issued a certificate of need for the new Medicaid beds; the only approval was pursuant to Proviso 9.35. Â Commander never applied for any of the additional Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35.Â  Nor did DHEC deny Commander approval for additional beds under the proviso. Â Â \r\nIn June 2000, Commander filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to overturn DHECâ€™s approval of additional new Medicaid beds for Heritage Home.Â  Commander also sought a declaration that DHECâ€™s grant of permission to Heritage Home to build new Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35 without obtaining a formal certificate of need was in violation of the provisions of the South Carolina Code prohibiting special legislation.Â  In addition, Commander sought a permanent injunction prohibiting DHEC from authorizing the construction of new Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35 without requiring facilities to obtain a formal certificate of need. Â Â Commander and Heritage, together with DHEC, filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  Heritage Home and DHEC argued Commander lacked the standing necessary to maintain the declaratory judgment action.Â  The circuit court agreed, and granted the motion.Â Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCommander argues the circuit court erred in (1) finding Commander lacked standing, and (2) granting summary judgment in favor of Heritage Home and DHEC.Â  We agree.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing\r\nCommander contends the circuit court erred in finding that it suffered no injury in fact, and therefore, lacked standing to maintain the declaratory judgment action.Â  We agree.\r\nAs a general rule, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the litigation.[1]Â  Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 478 S.E.2d 841 (1996).Â  Moreover, a private individual may not invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of an executive or legislative act unless the private individual can show that, as a result of that action, a direct injury has been sustained, or that there is immediate danger a direct injury will be sustained.Â  Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d 647, 649-50 (1999). Â Â The injury must be of a personal nature to the party bringing the action, not merely of a general nature that is common to all members of the public. Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 34, 530 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2000).\r\nHowever, â€œthe rule of standing is not an inflexible one.â€Â  Thompson v. South Carolina Commâ€™n on Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463, 467, 229 S.E.2d 718, 719 (1976).Â  Standing may be conferred upon a party â€œwhen an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.â€Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).Â  Recently, South Carolina courts have held standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.Â  See Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005); see also Sloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 593 S.E.2d 470 (2004) (finding standing existed to challenge governorâ€™s commission as an officer in the Air Force reserve); Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 548, 590 S.E.2d 338, 347 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding standing to bring declaratory judgment action alleging county failed to comply with ordinances governing procurement of construction services on design-build public works projects).\r\nIn Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005), a taxpayer sought to challenge a legislative enactment as violative of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Sloan challenged the legislative enactment as violative of the South Carolina Constitutionâ€™s â€œone subject provisionâ€ as found in Art. 3, section 17.Â  Wilkins argued Sloan lacked the standing necessary to maintain an action challenging the legislative enactment.Â  The supreme court, in its original jurisdiction, found Sloan had the standing to challenge the legislative enactment â€œin light of the great public importance of this matter.â€Â  Wilkins, 362 S.C. at 437, 608 S.E.2d at 583.Â  The supreme court held that â€œstanding may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.â€Â  Id.\r\nSimilar to the action taken in Wilkins, Commander seeks to challenge a legislative enactment, Proviso 9.35 of the 1998 Appropriations Bill, as violating the established certificate of need program as required by the State Certificate of Need and Health Facility Licensure Act contained in section 44-7-110, et seq. of the South Carolina Code (2002).Â  We deem the legislatureâ€™s funding and regulation of the stateâ€™s nursing home facilities, especially the regulation of Medicaid and Medicaid spending, an issue of great public importance.Â  Moreover, the legislature has the opportunity in each yearâ€™s Appropriations Bill to regulate the nursing home industry and corresponding Medicaid requirements.Â  Therefore, in light of the great public importance and need for future guidance for the legislature in this area, we find Commander has standing to maintain this action.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\nCommander argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Heritage and DHEC.Â  Specifically, Commander contends a material issue of fact exists as to whether the term â€œMedicaid patient daysâ€ as used in Proviso 9.35 is synonymous with the use of â€œMedicaid patient bedsâ€ as used in the certificate of need program.Â  We agree.\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court must apply the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Town of Awendaw, 359 S.C. 29, 34, 596 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2004).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine disputes of material facts and a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56, SCRCP; Etheridge v. Richland School Dist. One, 341 S.C. 307, 311, 534 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2000).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€Â  Id.\r\nHere, Heritage applied for the additional Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35, and its original certificate of need for the beds was withdrawn.Â  Based on Heritageâ€™s application for the beds under the Proviso, DHEC issued 44 additional Medicaid beds.Â  Proviso 9.35 addresses provisions for granting permits for the â€œadditional Medicaid daysâ€ while the Certificate of Need program focuses on â€œadditional Medicaid beds.â€Â  DHEC maintains the terms are used interchangeably, and that one Medicaid bed equals 365 Medicaid patient days, therefore enabling DHEC to grant the 44 beds under the Proviso.Â  However, DHEC cannot point to any case, statute, regulation, or provision that has established this â€œformulaâ€ to be the universally accepted definition in the nursing home community.Â  Therefore, we find a material issue of fact exists as to whether the term â€œMedicaid patient daysâ€ as used in Proviso 9.35 is synonymous with the use of â€œMedicaid patient bedsâ€ as used in the certificate of need program.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Heritage Home and DHEC.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the circuit court erred in finding Commander lacked standing, and in granting summary judgment in favor of Heritage and DHEC, the decision of the circuit court is hereby\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n BEATTY and SHORT, J.J. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œA party seeking to establish standing must prove the â€˜irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,â€™ which consists of three elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact; (2) the injury and the conduct complained of must be causally connected; and (3) it must be likely, rather than merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.â€Â  Sea Pines Assâ€™n for the Prot. of Wildlife v.

(collectively â€œPlaintiffsâ€) appeal the dismissal of their claims against various retail grocers and store managers (collectively â€œDefendantsâ€) filed under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe facts in this appeal are restricted to the allegations of Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint and are assumed to be true for the purpose of our review of the appealed order.[1]Â  \r\nMaurice Bessinger is a native South Carolina businessman and an officer and principal shareholder in Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.Â  After opening his first restaurant in 1953 in Charleston, South Carolina, Bessinger expanded his business enterprise to include eleven restaurants in the Midlands Area of South Carolina as well as a large bottling and packaging plant for mass production of barbecue sauce and meat for sales in retail stores.Â  Until September 2000, numerous supermarket chains continuously stocked and sold Plaintiffsâ€™ products for between fifteen and thirty years.Â  \r\nIn July 2000, after the Confederate battle flag was removed from the Statehouse dome, Plaintiffs began flying a Confederate flag at each of their restaurants.Â  In August 2000, The State newspaper published an article that criticized Plaintiffs for this action and for distributing religious literature at their restaurants.Â  Subsequently, other stories appeared in both print and broadcast media about Bessingerâ€™s political and religious views, with special emphasis on the controversy surrounding the Confederate battle flag.Â  \r\nDuring the next two months, several retail grocers discontinued selling Plaintiffsâ€™ products and removed the remaining items in stock from their shelves.Â  The only reason these various retailers gave for dropping Plaintiffsâ€™ products was Bessingerâ€™s political and religious views.Â  There was never any allegation that Plaintiffsâ€™ products were unpopular with consumers or of less than the highest quality.Â  The only symbol with any political significance at all on the packaging of Plaintiffsâ€™ products was a small American flag on the labels of Bessingerâ€™s barbecue sauce.Â  \r\nOn August 16, 2001, Plaintiffs sued nine corporate entities and several individual store managers in the Lexington County Court of Common Pleas alleging Defendantsâ€™ discontinuation of and refusal to display Plaintiffsâ€™ products constituted violations of the SCUTPA.Â  After filing the original complaint as a joint action, Plaintiffs decided to proceed against the various defendants separately.Â  \r\nOn June 21, 2002, the amended complaint was further amended to name BI-LO as a separate defendant.Â  On July 25, 2002, BI-LO moved to dismiss the case under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state a cause of action.Â  After oral argument on the motion, Circuit Judge Kenneth G. Goode issued an order on December 27, 2002, denying the motion.Â  His order stated:Â  â€œ[I]t appears to this Court that the Amended Complaint does state a valid claim for relief.Â  Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the SCUTPA.â€Â  On June 17, 2003, Circuit Judge James Williams filed a consent order permitting Plaintiffs â€œto file and serve a Second Amended Complaint repleading allegations as to damages, after [BI-LO] will be able to respond and plead additional constitutional defenses to the amended complaint.â€Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ amended complaint pursuant to this order was filed July 18, 2003.\r\nThe remaining corporate and individual defendants were served with amended complaints as separate actions during July and August of 2003.Â  From August through October 2003, five of the nine corporate defendants[2] and their individual store managers removed their cases to federal court based on diversity of citizenship and moved to dismiss the actions against them under Rule 12(b)(6), FRCP.Â  After a consolidated hearing on October 20, 2003, United States District Court Judge Joseph F. Anderson, Jr., issued an order dated November 20, 2003, upholding the removals to federal court and dismissing the actions.[3]Â  \r\nAfter Judge Anderson dismissed Plaintiffsâ€™ lawsuit in the federal court, BI-LO moved again to dismiss the state court action under Rule 12(b)(6) in the Lexington County Court of Common Pleas.[4]Â  The remaining state court defendants joined in the motion.[5]Â  On January 6, 2004, Chief Justice Jean Hoefer Toal signed an order vesting Circuit Judge William P. Keesley with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and dispose of Plaintiffsâ€™ state court actions.\r\nJudge Keesley heard the motions to dismiss on March 1, 2004.Â  On March 12, 2004, he issued an order specifically adopting the reasoning in Judge Andersonâ€™s order and ruling that (1) he was not bound by Judge Goodeâ€™s earlier ruling denying BI-LOâ€™s first motion to dismiss because the complaint against BI-LO had been amended in a substantial way; and (2) under the facts as alleged in their complaints, Plaintiffs could not recover under the SCUTPA.Â  \r\nPlaintiffs appeal.[6]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We reject Plaintiffsâ€™ contention that Judge Keesley erred in determining he was not bound by Judge Goodeâ€™s order denying a previous Rule 12(b)(6) motion by BI-LO to dismiss the case for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted.Â  It is clear from South Carolina case law that â€œ[t]he denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not establish the law of the case nor does it preclude a party from raising the issue at a later point or points in the case.â€[7]Â  BI-LO, therefore, was free to file a second motion to dismiss Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint at a later time.[8]Â  \r\n2.Â  We disagree with Plaintiffsâ€™ argument that they sufficiently pled the elements of an â€œunfairâ€ act to state an actionable grievance under the SCUTPA.\r\nThe SCUTPA declares unlawful â€œunfair . . . acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.â€[9]Â  â€œAn act is â€˜unfairâ€™ when it is offensive to public policy or when it is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.â€[10]Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial court that the allegations in the complaint do not suggest Defendants committed acts that would be unfair under the SCUTPA.Â  Assuming without deciding that Defendants terminated their business relationships with Plaintiffs solely because of Bessingerâ€™s statements, there is no First Amendment violation.[11]Â  Moreover, as free market participants, the defendant grocery store chains and their respective managers have the right to choose with whom they conduct their business.[12]Â  Although Plaintiffs are correct that this right â€œis not an absolute, unfettered privilege,â€ recent case law indicates that in South Carolina the enactment of the SCUTPA has not affected this right.[13]Â  Moreover, we agree with Judge Andersonâ€™s statement that, despite Plaintiffsâ€™ assertion that their products were never unprofitable, the business decision to discontinue the sale of these items is best left to â€œthe one who bears the risk of the decision.â€[14]Â  It follows, then, that the courts should not mandate that a private enterprise maintain an association that it believes is not conducive to any facet of its business, including its marketing, public image, and organizational structure.[15]\r\n3.Â  In their brief, Plaintiffs suggest that opinions from the Fourth Circuit supporting an analogous tort claim for the wrongful termination of a distributorship could potentially sustain a claim for an unfair act under the SCUTPA.Â  To the extent this argument was preserved for appeal, we disagree.Â  None of the pleadings before the trial court had any allegations akin to those for wrongful termination of a distributorship, and, notwithstanding authority from the Fourth Circuit to the contrary, this court has observed that no South Carolina decision recognizes a cause of action in tort for termination of a contractual relation in a manner contrary to equity and good conscience.[16]\r\n4.Â  Plaintiffs argue that the trial court further erred when overlooking their allegation that Defendants physically removed from the shelves in their stores those bottles of sauce that had been previously stocked.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  It was incumbent on Plaintiffs to raise this alleged omission to the trial court by way of a post-trial motion.Â  The record does not indicate that Plaintiffs moved to alter or amend the appealed order; therefore, the argument has not been preserved for appeal.[17]\r\n5.Â  Plaintiffs argue the grant of the motion to dismiss was improper because â€œthe case presents a set of novel circumstances that are inappropriate for resolution by Rule 12(b)(6) in an area of unsettled law.â€Â  We disagree.Â  When â€œthe dispute is not as to the underlying facts but as to the interpretation of the law, and development of the record will not aid in the resolution of the issues, it is proper to decide even novel issues on a motion to dismiss.â€[18]Â  Regardless of the assertion that this case is a matter of first impression, the heart of the controversy is the applicability of the SCUTPA to the facts alleged in Plaintiffsâ€™ complaints.Â  As we have explained above, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support a cause of action under the SCUTPA; therefore, we hold further development of the record would not aid in resolution of the issues.\r\n6.Â  Because we have determined that the acts alleged in Plaintiffsâ€™ complaints were not â€œunfairâ€ under the SCUTPA, we do not address the rulings in the appealed order addressing the question of whether the allegations in their complaint support a finding that Defendantsâ€™ conduct had an adverse public impact.[19]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See Overcash v.

Brogdon, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4042\r\nHeard September 12, 2005 â€“ Filed November 14, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCharles Craig Young, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nJeffrey L. Payne, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Honorage Nursing Home of Florence, South Carolina, Inc. appeals (1) the circuit court order vacating the default judgment against Florence Convalescent Center, Inc. (FCC), and (2) the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of FCC.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHonorage Nursing Home instituted this action against FCC for allegedly breaching the lease between the parties for a nursing home building in Florence, South Carolina.Â  In 1975, FCC began leasing the building from Honorage.Â  FCC operated the nursing home from that time until December 31, 2000.Â  \r\nIn September of 2000, Genevieve Powell, the President of FCC, informed Howard Clarke, the President of Honorage, that she wanted to terminate the lease and sell the furniture and fixtures in the nursing home to Honorage.Â  Over the course of the next few months, a series of negotiations took place between Clarkeâ€™s attorney, Porter Stewart, and Powellâ€™s attorney, John Chase.Â  The attorneys for the parties ultimately entered into a sales agreement on December 29, 2000, which provided for the purchase of the furniture and fixtures and the termination of the lease.Â  The significant terms of the sales agreement were: (1) Honorage agreed to terminate the lease; (2) Honorage forgave the November and December 2000 rent payments that were due under the lease; (3) Honorage agreed to pay the remaining property taxes for 2000; (4) FCC sold Honorage all of the furniture and fixtures in the nursing home, and (5) Honorage agreed to pay FCC $5,000 for FCCâ€™s computers, printers, and modems, together with all software and information therein.Â Â Â  \r\nOn December 31, 2000, in reliance on the agreement, FCC vacated the nursing home and left behind all furniture and fixtures.Â  Honorage took possession and began operating the nursing home on January 1, 2001.Â  \r\nHonorage filed this action on January 25, 2002, claiming FCC had breached the lease agreement.Â  Honorage sought to recover outstanding rent, taxes, and other items due under the lease.Â  Also on that date, Honorage filed a petition to serve FCC pursuant to section 15-9-210(c) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), claiming it could not locate FCCâ€™s registered agent.Â  The circuit court entered an order allowing Honorage to serve FCC pursuant to this statute.Â  However, the circuit court order incorrectly stated Honorage could serve FCC by mail at â€œthe corporationâ€™s last known place of business on record with the Secretary of Stateâ€™s office.â€Â  Section 15-9-210(c) provides the summons and complaint must be sent to â€œthe address of the companyâ€™s principal office which is listed on the last filed annual report of the corporation.â€Â  The last filed annual report for FCC listed its address as 2512 Newcastle Road, Florence, South Carolina, and stated Powell was the sole director and officer of the corporation.Â  \r\nThereafter, Honorage mailed the summons and complaint to Route 1, Clarke Road, Florence, South Carolina 29501, which was the address listed with the Secretary of Stateâ€™s office.Â  This address was the same address used by Honorageâ€™s own registered agent, Howard Clarke, and it was also the physical address for the nursing home that FCC had previously leased for 25 years.Â  Honorage never forwarded the summons and complaint to Powell or FCC.Â  \r\nAfter mailing the summons and complaint to its own address, Honorage conducted a default judgment hearing on June 4, 2002.Â Â Â  Honorage also mailed notice of the hearing to the nursing home only and not to Powell or FCC.Â  Neither FCC nor Powell made an appearance at the damages hearing.Â  On March 19, 2002, the circuit court entered a default judgment against FCC in the amount of $1,281,779.Â  The default order prepared by Honorage also contained a finding that FCCâ€™s â€œcorporate veil is pierced and that its sole shareholder is to be held personally liable for the judgment entered herein.â€Â  Powell, however, was not a party to the initial action.\r\nPowell learned of the original judgment when Honorage filed a declaratory judgment action against her to collect the damages.Â  Powell filed a motion to set aside the entry of default against FCC.Â  \r\nThe circuit court set aside the entry of default against FCC and also granted FCC summary judgment on the issue of the damages.Â  The circuit court held Honorage had voluntarily terminated the lease as of December 29, 2000, and, therefore, FCC did not breach the agreement.Â  Honorageâ€™s appeal follows. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Default Judgment\r\nHonorage argues the circuit court improperly set aside the entry of default against FCC.Â  We disagree.\r\nUpon motion, the circuit court may relieve a party from a final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, where the moving party demonstrates the judgment or order was induced by, among other things, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  Hillman v. Pinion ex. rel Estate of Hillman, 347 S.C. 253, 256, 554 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Relief from judgment under Rule 60, SCRCP, rests within the sound discretion of the circuit court, and the circuit courtâ€™s findings will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1989); McCall v. Ikon, 363 S.C. 646, 651, 611 S.E.2d 315, 317 (Ct. App. 2005) (rehearing denied).\r\nIn this action, Honorage clearly failed to comply with section 15-9-210(c) in attempting to serve FCC.Â  Section 15-9-210(c) clearly provides the summons and complaint must be sent to â€œthe address of the companyâ€™s principal office which is listed on the last filed annual report of the corporation.â€Â  Honorage did not do so.Â  FCCâ€™s last annual report was filed with the Department of Revenue in March 2001.Â  This annual report indicated FCCâ€™s address for service of process was 2512 Newcastle Road in Florence.Â  FCC was never served at that address and, accordingly, never received notification of the action against it.Â  Because Honorage failed to comply with the service requirements of section 15-9-210(c), the circuit court correctly set aside the entry of default against FCC.\r\nAdditionally, any attempt to serve FCC under section 15-9-210(c) was improper.Â  Honorageâ€™s attorney argued to this court that he was under no obligation to locate FCCâ€™s registered agent prior to service under section 15-9-210(c).Â  We strongly disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œA suit at law is not a childrenâ€™s game, but a serious effort on the part of adult human beings to administer justice; and the purpose of process is to bring parties into court.â€Â  McCall, 363 S.C. at 651, 611 S.E.2d at 317 (citing Griffin v. Capital Cash, 310 S.C. 288, 292, 423 S.E.2d 143, 146 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  Section 15-9-210 (c) is designed to assist a party when a corporation has no registered agent or an agent that could not be served with â€œreasonable diligence.â€ (emphasis added).Â  In this case, Honorageâ€™s attorney informed the circuit court he had complied with the requirements in section 15-9-210, and that he attempted to locate the registered agent for FCC.Â  Yet, Honorage knew the registered agent for FCC had been deceased for almost twenty years because Honorageâ€™s president and controlling shareholder, Howard Clarke, had served as a pallbearer in the registered agentâ€™s funeral.Â  Moreover, Clarke knew Powell was the sole shareholder of FCC as he had known her for over forty years.\r\nTherefore, the circuit court did not abuse its considerable discretion in setting aside the judgment against FCC under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\nII.Â  Summary Judgment\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nHonorage alleges the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to FCC on the breach of the lease issue.Â  Honorage asserts the lease did not terminate because any agreement to do so did not satisfy the Statute of Frauds.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe statute of frauds merely requires some memorandum or note of the agreement relating to real estate to be in writing and signed by the party charged therewith or his agent, and does not require a formally executed contract.â€Â  Blocker v. Hundertmark, et al., 204 S.C. 269, 274, 28 S.E.2d 855, 856 (1944).Â  The writing must reasonably identify the subject matter of the contract, sufficiently indicate a contract has been made between the parties, and state with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the agreement.Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 106, 382 S.E.2d 891, 896 (1989). Â \r\nPorter Stewart, Honorageâ€™s attorney at the time, testified that a letter he wrote in 2001 set forth the sales agreement on behalf of Honorage and Howard Clarke.Â  In this letter, Stewart outlined the terms of the agreement between Honorage and FCC.Â  Moreover, Stewart also testified Clarke had full knowledge of the letter, and authorized the terms of the sales agreement that expressly provided for the â€œtermination of the lease between the parties.â€Â  This letter sufficiently satisfies the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\r\nMoreover, even if the letter was insufficient, the part performance exception to the Statute of Frauds would apply.Â  â€œSufficient part performance of a parole contract to convey or devise real estate will, in equity, remove agreement from operation of statute of frauds.â€Â  Parr v. Parr, 268 S.C. 58, 65, 231 S.C. 695, 698 (1977).Â  \r\nHere, the parties entered into a sales agreement with one of the conditions being the termination of the lease.Â  Pursuant to the agreement, FCC vacated the premises, and relinquished control over the furniture and fixtures in the nursing home to Honorage.Â  Honorage took possession of the premises immediately after FCC vacated, and remained in possession thereafter.Â  It is clear that both parties have partially performed in reliance of this sales agreement.\r\nTherefore, the circuit court correctly concluded no genuine issue as to any material fact existed regarding the termination of the lease, and FCC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s decision to set aside the default judgment against FCC and grant of summary judgment in favor of FCC on the breach of the lease is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4044","title":"Gordon v.

Gibbons, Jr. and Deborah Harrison Sheffield, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Charles Gordon appeals the dismissal of his civil action against Jacqueline Busbee, individually and as personal representative of the estate of George Burch, and Dennis and Laura Burch, as devisees of the estate of George Burch.Â  The circuit court dismissed the action because Gordon did not file his claim on a specific probate court form.[1]Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 30, 1984, Clara Gordon Burch married George Burch.Â  At the time, Clara Burch was seventy-five years old, and George Burch was almost seventy.Â  The couple remained married for nearly sixteen years, until the death of Clara Burch on April 19, 2000.Â  In her will, Clara appointed George personal representative of her estate.Â  She also named Charles Gordon alternate personal representative.Â  \r\nGeorge served as personal representative until his death on January 18, 2003.Â  A month after Georgeâ€™s death, Gordon assumed the duties of the personal representative of Claraâ€™s estate.Â  Gordon claims that after his appointment he discovered various improprieties related to distributions from Claraâ€™s estate.Â  Gordon asserts these distributions were made not only from her estate while George acted as its personal representative, but also from her financial holdings during the time George acted as Claraâ€™s attorney in fact from 1994 until her death in 2000.Â  \r\nGordon then brought this lawsuit against Jacqueline Busbee, an Aiken County attorney, individually and in her capacity as personal representative of the estate of George Burch, and Dennis and Laura Burch, as devisees under George Burchâ€™s will (collectively Busbee).Â  The summons and verified complaint were filed with the probate court on April 15, 2003.Â  The complaint stated amounts claimed from the estate of George Burch as well as the basis for claiming them.Â  Soon after Gordon filed the complaint, the case was removed from probate court to circuit court, and Busbee answered.Â  \r\nLater that year, Busbee moved the circuit court to dismiss Gordonâ€™s action against the estate of George Burch for failure to present his claim within the proper time and on the proper form.Â  Busbee contended that pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-804(2) Gordon had until the end of the claim period on October 4, 2003 to submit his claim to the personal representative of the estate of George Burch.Â  Busbee argued that because Gordon did not file South Carolina Probate Court Form 371 before the claim period expired, Gordon did not properly present his claim against the estate, and his claim was barred.Â  The circuit court agreed and granted Busbeeâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n Gordon raises the following four issues on appeal:Â  (1) whether the trial court erred when it concluded Gordonâ€™s claim against the estate of George Burch was barred because Gordon did not use a particular probate court form to submit his claim; (2) whether the trial court erred when it considered the affidavit of attorney James Verenes; (3) whether Busbee is estopped from asserting Gordonâ€™s claim is barred; and (4) whether Busbee has waived the right to claim Gordonâ€™s claim is barred.Â \r\n    Probate Court Form 371 is tailored to assist creditors of a probate estate, often unrepresented by legal counsel, when they submit their claims to the personal representative of the estate.Â  The form asks for the name and address of the claimant, the amount claimed, and the basis for each claim.Â  Gordon asserts that the use of Form 371 is not mandatory.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n    The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature.Â  Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 307, 613 S.E.2d. 364, 366 (2005).Â  The intent of the legislature should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 102, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThe language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.â€Â  Mun. Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. AT&amp;T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004).Â  A statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.Â  Liberty\r\n    Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 622, 611 S.E.2d 297, 302 (Ct. App. 2005). Â The court will reject a statutory interpretation that would â€œlead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.â€Â  Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000). \r\n    Section 62-3-804 outlines two ways in which a claimant may present a claim against a decedentâ€™s estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-804 (1987 &amp; Supp. 2004).Â  Section 62-3-804(1) provides that a claim may be presented by delivering to the personal representative a â€œwritten statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed,â€ and the claimant â€œmust file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the probate court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-804(1) (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  Another method of presentation, the one elected by Gordon in this case, is for the claimant to â€œcommence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-804(2) (1987).Â  This action â€œmust occur within the time limited for presenting the claim, and the claimant must file a written statement of the claim as in (1) above, with the clerk of the probate court.â€Â  Â§&nbsp;62-3-804(2).Â  \r\n    The standard form frequently filed with the probate court in relation to section 62-3-804 is Form 371.Â  The trial court determined that the language of section 62-3-804 required Gordon to use Form 371â€”and only Form 371â€”because section one, and by reference section two, states that the written statement must be â€œin the form prescribed by rule.â€Â  This interpretation of the statute is too narrow.Â  Section 62-3-804 does not mention Form 371, let alone require the use of Form 371 as the only way to satisfy the requirements of the statute.Â  The phrase â€œ[i]n the form prescribed by ruleâ€ refers to the manner or â€œprocedure as determined or governed by regulation,â€ not to a specific â€œdocument with blanks for the insertion of . . . information.â€Â  The American Heritage Dictionary of The English Language 690 (4th ed. 2000).Â  If the legislature intended to require claimants to use Form 371, it could have easily provided that the claim be brought on the form prescribed by rule, not â€œin the form prescribed by rule.â€Â  Â§ 62-3-804(1) (emphasis added); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-603(B)(2) (Supp. 2004) (â€œWhere a bond is required of the personal representative . . . by law or by the will, it may be waived . . . [if] all known beneficiaries and other persons having an interest in the estate execute a written statement on a form prescribed by the court . . . .â€) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n    Consequently, â€œin the form prescribed by ruleâ€ means in the basic manner set forth in section 62-3-804(1).Â  The purpose of requiring the information set forth in section 62-3-804(1) is to provide notice of claims to the probate court as well as to any party who may have an interest in the estate.Â  While Form 371 certainly provides this information, nothing in section 62-3-804 mandates that Form 371 is the only way this information can be provided.Â  \r\n    Here, the verified complaint satisfies the requirements of section 62-3-804.Â  First, the complaint contains all the information mandated.Â  The complaint identifies the plaintiff/claimant and provides the address of his attorney as his representative in the matter.Â  It further identifies the amounts claimed and the basis for each claim.Â  Furthermore, although the case was removed to the circuit court, the complaint remains on file in the probate court.Â  Because the filed complaint provides notice of claims against the estate to the probate court and any interested parties, making Form 371 mandatory would be duplicative and serve to elevate form over substance.Â  \r\n    Form 371 may be necessary when the claimant intends to submit a claim to the personal representative but does not intend to commence an action against the personal representativeâ€”for example, when the claimant expects the personal representative to allow the claim.Â  Form 371 may also be necessary when the claimant intends to commence a proceeding against the personal representative in a court other than probate court.Â  In that case, Form 371 would put the probate court on notice of the proceeding, which would insure that the estate is not distributed before the claim is handled.Â  In this case, however, the complaint accomplishes precisely what Form 371 is intended to accomplish.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred when it held the requirements of section 62-3-804(2) can be satisfied only by filing Form 371 with the probate court.Â  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    Accordingly, under these circumstances, and in light of the obligation that the probate code be â€œliberally construed,â€ we hold that Form 371 was not mandatory.[2] Â See In re Estate of Tollison, 320 S.C. 132, 136, 463 S.E.2d 611, 614 (Ct. App. 1995) (construing section 62-3-804 liberally to promote the probate codeâ€™s underlying purposes).Â  It is not necessary for us to address Gordonâ€™s remaining issues in light of our disposition of the case.Â  See Futch&nbsp;v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (citing Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (stating the court need not address remaining issues when determination of prior issue is dispositive)). \r\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n    HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We are unable to determine if the order under appeal purports to dismiss the claim against Jacqueline Busbee in her individual capacity.Â  However, because the order is grounded on the failure to comply with a provision relating solely to a claim against an estate, this action appears to have survived the dismissal.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Because we determine Form 371 was not mandatory, we do not reach the issue of whether the failure to file it has jurisdictional implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4045","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â Earnetta Marie King and her boyfriend, Patrick Walker, were jointly tried for the murder of her son, Rodrekus King.Â  King appeals her conviction for murder.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEarly March 22, 2002, paramedics responded to a call from Patrick Walker.Â  The call concerned the condition of Rodrekus King, Earnetta Marie Kingâ€™s thirteen-year-old son.Â  When the paramedics arrived, King met them outside and told them her son was not breathing.Â  She escorted them into the house.Â  Once inside, the paramedics found Rodrekus lying on the kitchen floor.Â  He was naked, unresponsive, and pulseless.Â  The paramedics saw Walker attempting to administer artificial respiration to Rodrekus.Â  Rodrekus was transported to Greenville Memorial Hospital, where he later died.\r\nAt the time of death, Rodrekus was covered with bruises, small cuts, and â€œavulsed skin.â€Â  An extensive hematoma covered half of Rodrekusâ€™s head.Â  Dr. Michael Ward, a forensic pathologist and the medical examiner for Greenville County, performed the autopsy.Â  Dr. Ward determined Rodrekus died â€œas the result of multiple blunt force injuries.â€\r\nAt trial, King blamed Walker for the murder of Rodrekus, and Walker blamed King.Â  King testified Walker was solely responsible for the physical abuse that led to Rodrekusâ€™s death.Â  She claimed she did not hit or in any way assault Rodrekus.Â  King professed Walker repeatedly punched, kicked, and struck Rodrekus with a mop handle and broom.\r\nIn support of her assertion that Walker acted alone, King attempted to admit a handwritten letter from Walker to Mesha Thomason, Walkerâ€™s former girlfriend.Â  Kingâ€™s counsel, Walkerâ€™s counsel, and the Solicitor believed the letter to be a confession of the crime by Walker.Â  Because the letter was not divulged to Walkerâ€™s attorney until the day the Solicitor sought to put Thomason on the stand, the trial judge held the State violated Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and excluded the letter.Â  The judge nevertheless allowed Thomason to testify, so long as she did not discuss the statements Walker made in the letter.\r\nKingâ€™s attorney inquired about his ability to put Thomason on the stand as a defense witness.Â  The following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n[Kingâ€™s Attorney]:Â  Well, your Honor, I would just â€“ in regard to Mesha Thomason, obviously, we didnâ€™t know [your position] in regard to the Stateâ€™s case.Â  But when the time comes that we have to make a decision whether to put up any evidence, at that point I think what Ms. Thomason has to say is relevant to our case.Â  And while she did not appear on my witness list, because frankly I assumed she was being called by the Solicitorâ€™s office, I would like to have her available to call as a witness in my case.\r\nThe Court:Â  Any objection from the State? \r\n[The State]:Â  No objection from the State.\r\nThe Court:Â  [Walkerâ€™s counsel]?\r\n[Walkerâ€™s Counsel]:Â  Certainly I would object to any testimony about the substance of the alleged letter of confession.\r\nThe Court:Â  All right.Â  If that happens, the Court will issue its ruling.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the State rested without Thomasonâ€™s testimony.Â  Because Thomason was unavailable, King attempted to admit the handwritten letter in her absence.Â  The judge excluded the letter based on the Stateâ€™s violation of Rule 5, SCRCrimP, as well as the unavailability of Thomason.\r\nThe following day, however, Thomason was available to testify.Â  Before Kingâ€™s counsel rested, he requested Thomason be allowed to testify to the statements made by Walker in his letter to her.Â  King argued:\r\n\r\nYour Honor, as we discussed off the record, the witness I intended to call that I indicated to the Court yesterday was not available has now become available.Â  That is . . . Mesha Thomason.Â  She is the witness who earlier in the trial the solicitor had sought to offer because she received a letter from Patrick Walker which was essentially a confession and under ordinary circumstances would be admissible as a confession by him.Â  The solicitorâ€™s office was not able to offer it because the court ruled they didnâ€™t comply with the discovery rules.Â  We donâ€™t believe those rules would apply to us since weâ€™re not the State, and it was certainly not in our control.Â  At this time I would, before closing my case, . . . call Mesha Thomason as a witness and introduce that confession through her.\r\n\r\nThe judge refused to allow Thomason to testify based on his previous ruling that the State failed to turn the letter over to Walker in contravention of Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  The judge concluded Thomason had not â€œshown up in a timely fashion,â€ and, even if she had, her testimony would not be allowed under State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999).Â  King countered that because the letter was a confession by Walker, it was by its very nature exculpatory to King, who would be severely prejudiced if the letter was not allowed to be presented.Â  The trial court refused to admit the letter into evidence.\r\nKing was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  She appeals the decision by the trial court to exclude Thomasonâ€™s testimony.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 610 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 613 S.E.2d 381 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 606 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Error without prejudice does not warrant reversal.Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000).\r\nThe decision by the trial judge to exclude evidence for failure to comply with disclosure rules will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See State v. Kerr, 330 S.C. 132, 498 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1998); see also State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 56, 63, 419 S.E.2d 820, 825 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œSanctions for noncompliance with disclosure rules are within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision by the trial judge is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKing argues the trial judge abused his discretion when he refused to allow Thomason, an available witness, to testify.\r\nInitially, we note King did not proffer Thomasonâ€™s testimony.Â  Generally, a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether that testimony was properly excluded by the trial court.Â  It is well settled that a reviewing court may not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the rejected testimony would have been.Â  State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 260 S.E.2d 705 (1979); see also State v. Cabbagestalk, 281 S.C. 35, 314 S.E.2d 10 (1984) (stating that failure to make offer of proof prevents appellate court from determining whether exclusion of testimony is prejudicial and thus precludes appellant from raising the issue on appeal).Â  However, when it is clear from the record that prejudice exists, the issue will be preserved on appeal despite the absence of a proffer.Â  See State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551 (1990).Â  The reason for the rule requiring a proffer of excluded evidence is to enable the reviewing court to discern prejudice.Â  Id.Â  That rule has been relaxed where the record clearly demonstrates prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nThe record reflects Thomason was going to testify to the statements Walker made in his letter to her.Â  The record clearly indicates King would be prejudiced by the exclusion of Thomasonâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, the issue of whether Thomasonâ€™s testimony was properly excluded is preserved for review despite the lack of a proffer.\r\nRule 601(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provides: â€œEvery person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided by statute or these rules.â€Â  Rule 601(a), SCRE.Â  Generally, â€œ[a]ll witnesses are presumed competent to testify.â€Â  Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 190, 607 S.E.2d 82, 86 (2005).Â  Courts presume a witness to be competent because bias or other defects in a witnessâ€™s testimonyâ€”revealed primarily through cross-examinationâ€”affect a witnessâ€™s credibility and may be weighed by the finder of fact.Â  State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 508 S.E.2d 857 (1998).\r\nIn the instant case, Thomason was available and â€œpresumed competent to testify.â€Â \r\nSee Sellers, 362 S.C. at 190, 607 S.E.2d at 86.Â  Concomitantly, unless a statute or other rule of evidence prevented her from testifying, Thomason should have been allowed to take the stand.\r\nThe trial judge determined Thomason could not testify because (1) the State violated Rule 5, SCRCrimP; and (2) her testimony was inadmissible under State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999).\r\nI.Â  Rule 5, SCRCrimP\r\nâ€œThe requirements of Rule 5 . . . are judicially created discovery mechanisms for use in criminal proceedings.â€Â  State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999).Â  Under Rule 5, the State should disclose to the defendant â€œany relevant written or recorded statements made by the defendant . . . within the possession, custody or control of the prosecution . . . .â€Â  Rule 5(a)(1)(A), SCRCrimP.Â  If the trial judge determines the State has violated Rule 5, the judge has the discretion to fashion a proper remedy.Â  See State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 498 S.E.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d as modified, 343 S.C. 520, 541 S.E.2d 247 (2001).Â  The judge may â€œprohibit the party from introducing evidence not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.â€Â  Rule 5(d)(2),\r\nSCRCrimP.\r\nThe trial judge determined that pursuant to Rule 5 the State should have disclosed to Walkerâ€™s attorney the letter from Walker to Thomason.Â  The judge excluded the letter as well as any â€œalleged or purported statementsâ€ made by Walker because the State violated Rule 5.Â  While this exclusion was beneficial to Walker, it was detrimental to King.Â  The Stateâ€™s violation of Rule 5, and the judgeâ€™s remedy, deprived King of the opportunity to admit into evidence an alleged statement from Walker that he alone physically assaulted Rodrekus.Â  The judge, in effect, sanctioned King for the inappropriate conduct of the State.Â  Consequently, King was denied the chance to present exculpatory evidence from an available witness.\r\nA trial judge presiding over a joint trial is charged with the difficult task of maintaining the delicate balance between the interests of the State and the interests of each co-defendant.Â  However, each defendant is entitled to call witnesses whose testimony may exculpate or exonerate them.Â  Therefore, the decision to exclude Kingâ€™s witness because the State violated Rule 5 was an improper and unjust remedy under the circumstances.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the State contends the trial court properly sanctioned it for violating Rule 5.Â  The State noted: â€œ[I]t would have been unjust to allow the State to benefit from the violation, regardless of who introduced the letter into evidence.â€Â  The Stateâ€™s argument that Thomason should not be allowed to take the stand because the State would benefit from its own Rule 5 violation is unpersuasive.Â  King claims Thomasonâ€™s testimony would benefit her defense.\r\nThomason should have been allowed to testify for King even though the State failed to disclose the letter to Walkerâ€™s attorney.Â  The trial judge abused his discretion when he refused to allow Thomason to testify based on the fact he had previously sanctioned the State for a Rule 5 violation.\r\nII.Â \r\nState v. Fuller\r\nThe trial judge refused to allow Thomason to testify because of the South Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999).Â  Fuller was convicted of murder and conspiracy, and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for murder and five years, consecutive, for conspiracy.Â  The State presented a statement from a co-conspirator, Holmes, to a third-party, McKinney.Â  The statement was an admission by Holmes that he and Fuller committed the murder.Â  Because the State could not put Holmes on the stand, as he was killed while committing another crime, it put McKinney on the stand and elicited the statement from him.Â  The trial court held the statement was admissible under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, which governs hearsay exceptions when the declarant is unavailable.Â  The Supreme Court reversed, holding:\r\n\r\nThe hearsay statements recounted by McKinney essentially amounted to statements by a deceased third-party that inculpated [Fuller] and subjected the declarant to criminal liability.Â  Thus, the issue before this Court is whether a non-self-inculpatory statement, which is collateral to a self-inculpatory statement, may nonetheless come in under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, as a statement made by an unavailable declarant against his penal interest.Â  We conclude that such statements are inadmissible.\r\n\r\nId. at 243-44, 523 S.E.2d at 172.\r\n Fuller is distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  First, unlike the declarant in Fuller, the declarant in this case, Walker, is available to testifyâ€”Walker is not unavailable under Rule 804, SCRE, simply because he invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.Â  See State v. Terry, 339 S.C. 352, 529 S.E.2d 274 (2000).Â  Second, Walker, the declarant in this case, does not make incriminating statements about himself and a co-defendant.Â  Rather, the declarant makes incriminating statements about himself only.Â  Walker states in the letter to Thomason that he was solely responsible for the murder of Rodrekus.Â  Thomason can testify to the statements made in Walkerâ€™s letter without violating Fuller because Walkerâ€™s statements are â€œself-inculpatoryâ€ only.Â  This is not a Fuller case because Walker does not inculpate King.\r\n Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), is not implicated.Â  A Bruton violation occurs when two defendants, A and B, are tried jointly, and defendant A makes a confession that inculpates defendant B.Â  If defendant A does not testify, then Aâ€™s statement against B is inadmissible because B will be unable to exercise his right under the Confrontation Clause to cross-examine A.Â  Here, Walker made a confession to Thomason, but did not inculpate King.Â  Thus, Bruton has not been violated.\r\nThe trial judge committed an error of law by refusing to allow Thomason to testify based on Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, and State v. Fuller.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the trial judge abused his discretion when he refused to allow Thomason to testify.Â  Neither Rule 5, SCRCrimP, nor State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999), prevented Thomason from testifying for King.Â  Pellucidly, the error committed by the circuit judge is coupled with prejudice as a matter of law.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n GOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4046","title":"Bass v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4046\r\nHeard November 8, 2005 â€“ Filed November 21, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDarryl D. Smalls, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nHyman S. Rubin, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this Workersâ€™ Compensation case, Kenco appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming an award of benefits to John Bass.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn July of 2000, Bass began driving a truck, delivering and installing appliances for Kenco.Â  Bass injured his left shoulder on January 24, 2001 while he and a co-worker attempted to move an 800-pound refrigerator down the ramp of a tractor-trailer.Â  After returning to work, Bass re-injured his left shoulder on March 2, 2001 while unloading a double oven.Â  \r\nDr. Fulton began treating Bass after the March 2 injury.Â  He placed Bass on light-duty restrictions of no overhead lifting with the left arm, and no lifting of greater than ten pounds.Â  Bass underwent a six-week pain management program.Â  He was eventually released by Dr. Midcap to return to work on a permanent light-duty status.Â  Bass was able to perform office work, but could no longer drive a truck.Â  Due to the sedentary work restrictions, Bass earned only one-third to one-half the salary he made as a truck driver.Â  \r\nIn addition to his physical indisposition, Bass experienced anxiety and depression.Â  Dr. Drummond performed a psychological evaluation and declared Bass â€œdysfunctional.â€Â  Dr. Drummond concluded:\r\n\r\nthe Claimantâ€™s chronic pain was interfering with his life more than normal, that he was suffering from affective distress and feeling of diminished control over his life, and . . . he was evidencing lower overall general activity including social activity, activities away from home, outdoor work, household chores, and a lower repertoire of distracting responses to help him cope with the pain.\r\n\r\nBass was referred to a psychologist, who determined he would be unable to return to work until his symptoms subsided.Â  Bass saw Dr. Estefano, a psychiatrist, who opined Bass had developed severe depression and panic attacks as a consequence of his work-related injury.Â  According to Dr. Estefano, Bass would â€œnot be able to return to work for an indefinite amount of time due to his mental and physical condition.â€Â  \r\nBass filed a Form 50 seeking an award for (1) permanent partial general disability as a result of injuries to his left shoulder and mental and emotional injuries; (2) past and future medical examination and treatment for psychological and psychiatric conditions induced by the accident; (3) a determination of average weekly wage and compensation rate; and (4) other appropriate benefits under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner concluded: \r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 John Bass, Jr. has sustained permanent partial disability which has permanently altered his earning capacity from a pre-accident average weekly wage of $1,211.52 to a current weekly expectation of $280, which results in a weekly wage loss of $931.52.Â  Multiplying this figure by .667 equals $621.77 for an accident occurring in 2001.Â  I conclude that the Claimant has suffered this wage loss for the maximum period of 340 weeks for permanent partial disability pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20.Â  I further find that the Claimantâ€™s partial disability began after a period of total disability and therefore pursuant to said section the amounts paid for temporary total disability shall not be deducted from the maximum of 340 weeks allowed for permanent partial disability. Â \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commissioner ordered Kenco to pay for past psychiatric and psychological treatment and medications, and â€œany continuing causally related treatment and medications for those conditions . . . which tend to lessen the Claimantâ€™s period of disability resulting from his accident-related psychiatric or psychological conditions.Â  Dodge v.

App. 1999).â€Â  \r\nThe appellate panel and the circuit court affirmed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the workersâ€™ compensation commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 617 S.E.2d 369 (Ct. App. 2005); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â \r\nBursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp;\r\nEnvtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Liberty\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr.

Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in a workersâ€™ compensation decision.Â  Frame, 357 S.C. at 527, 593 S.E.2d at 494; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Lockridge v. Santens of America, Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€).Â  Pursuant to the APA, this Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the appellate panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  See Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 610 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. # 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); see also Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct.

Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting that in reviewing decision of workersâ€™ compensation commission, court of appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported by substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004); Jones v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 586 S.E.2d 111 (2003); Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe appellate panel is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729; Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â \r\nShealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Parsons v.

Â The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); DuRant v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp;\r\nEnvtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 604 S.E.2d 704 (Ct.

Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of the appellate panel which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Pratt, 357 S.C. at 622, 594 S.E.2d at 274-75; Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Efficacy of Kencoâ€™s Assignments of Error\r\nAs a threshold issue, Bass argues Kencoâ€™s appeal should be dismissed because (1) its assignments of error â€œfail to meet the standard of specificity required for judicial review,â€ and (2) Kenco asserts an erroneous standard of review.Â  \r\nThe circuit court noted that Kencoâ€™s assignments of error all contend the commissionâ€™s findings were â€œâ€˜not supported by the greater weight of credible evidence nor . . . by existing South Carolina statutory or case law.â€™â€Â Â Â  The assignments, according to the circuit court, â€œfail to meet the standard of specificity required for judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act.â€Â  Furthermore, Kenco erroneously substitutes a preponderance or greater weight of the evidence standard for the appropriate substantial evidence standard.Â  \r\n Smith v. South Carolina Department of Social Services, 284 S.C. 469, 327 S.E.2d 348 (1985), sets forth the specificity requirement for appeals under the APA:\r\n\r\n[A] petition which will suffice legally must be one which will direct the courtâ€™s attention to the abuse or abuses allegedly committed below through a distinct and specific statement of the rulings complained of.Â  In short, the petition must include all that is necessary to enable the appellate court to decide whether the ruling complained of was erroneous. \r\n\r\nId. at 470-71, 327 S.E.2d at 349.Â  In Smith, the petition for review was â€œbroad and unspecific,â€ and contained â€œno allegation which would explain why [the appellant] believe[d] the agency decision was wrong.â€Â  Id.Â  The Smith court stated, â€œIn essence, the petition merely represents a statement by her that she is dissatisfied with the decision that she received from the agency below.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nUnlike the court in Smith, Kencoâ€™s assignments of error are not so opaque or laconic as to hinder our review.Â  Moreover, Kencoâ€™s framing of the alleged errors in terms of â€œthe greater weight of evidenceâ€ is likely an inadvertent scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  This Court is fully cognizant of the proper standard of review to be employed in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases.Â  South Carolina jurisprudence exuberates with precedent extant on the proper standard of review.Â  Accordingly, we decline to dismiss this appeal based on Kencoâ€™s assignments of error.\r\nII.Â  Award of Benefits\r\nA.Â  The Award Under Section 42-9-20\r\nKenco maintains the court erred in affirming the commissionâ€™s award of benefits under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985) because â€œthe facts of this case do not support a loss of earning capacity, since the claimant never was physically fit to drive a truck.â€Â  \r\nSection 42-9-20 provides:\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise provided in Â§ 42-9-30, when the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as provided in this chapter, to the injured employee during such disability a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than the average weekly wage in this State for the preceding fiscal year. In no case shall the period covered by such compensation be greater than three hundred forty weeks from the date of injury. In case the partial disability begins after a period of total disability, the latter period shall not be deducted from a maximum period allowed in this section for partial disability.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985).Â  \r\nâ€œUnder our Workerâ€™s Compensation Act, a claimant may proceed under Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-20 to prove a general disability; alternatively, he or she may proceed under Â§ 42-9-30 to prove a loss, or loss of use of, a member, organ, or part of the body for which specific awards are listed in the statute.â€Â  Fields v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 555, 393 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1990) (footnote omitted).Â  â€œ[A]n award under the general disability statutes must be predicated upon a showing of a loss of earning capacity, whereas an award under the scheduled loss statute does not require such a showing.â€Â  Id. (citing Roper v. Kimbrellâ€™s of Greenville, Inc., 231 S.C. 453, 99 S.E.2d 52 (1957)).Â  â€œA claimant may obtain partial permanent disability under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1976).Â  To do so a claimant must show an injury and a loss of earning capacity.â€Â \r\nWigfall v. Tideland Utilities, Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 105 n.3, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 n.3 (2003) (citing Roper, 231 S.C. 453, 99 S.E.2d 52).Â  \r\nKenco asserts that Bass was insulin dependent while employed as a truck driver, and therefore, he was driving a truck in violation of federal law.Â  Under its theory, if Bass could not legally drive a truck while working for Kenco, he should not be given credit for the salary he enjoyed while doing so.Â  \r\nThere is no evidence in the record suggesting Bass drove a truck while insulin dependent.Â  Approximately one month before starting his job with Kenco, a doctor gave Bass insulin shots.Â  Bass testified â€œthe blood sugars kept dropping with the insulin, so I discontinued the insulin and went back to diet and exercise.â€Â  On a Kenco medical history questionnaire filled out prior to being hired, Bass indicated that he did not have diabetes.Â  At the hearing, Bass explained he checked â€œNoâ€ â€œ[b]ecause it wasnâ€™t a major problem, it wasnâ€™t a problem at that time.â€Â  Further, Bass discussed his diabetic incident with Kenco manager Steve McIntire and with the Kenco doctor who performed a physical on him:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\nI told [McIntire] that I had problems with sugar diabetes before.Â  That recently I had had it back in June, a flare up, my wife got sick.Â  When I took the physical I spoke with that doctor and told them the same thing.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n        So what did Mr. McIntire\r\n          tell you about that?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         As long as I passed the physical he did not have a problem with that.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         What was the problem that they had with diabetes in general, according to Mr. McIntire, what was the problem with them?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Only if I had to go back on insulin would I not be able or be allowed to drive tractor-trailers.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTests conducted as a part of Bassâ€™s physical came back negative for diabetes.Â  \r\nBass averred he was not insulin dependent at any time while driving a truck for\r\nKenco:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nQ:Â \r\n      \r\n      Did you go on insulin at any time when you were driving their trucks?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Not when I was driving their trucks.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n      No time?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       No time.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       So at no time were you insulin dependant when you were doing the job for which you were hired?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Thatâ€™s right. . . .\r\n    \r\n  \r\nThe federal regulation pled by Kenco provides:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (a)&nbsp;\r\n         A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/she is physically qualified to do so . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (b)\r\n        A person is physically\r\n          qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that personâ€”\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         . . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          (3)&nbsp;\r\n           Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus currently requiring insulin for control[.]\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n49 C.F.R. Â§ 391.41 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn essence, Kenco attempts to apply the phrase â€œable to earnâ€ in section 42-9-20 to the average weekly wages Bass was earning prior to the injury, and then argue that he should be deemed unable to earn $1,211.52 because of the diabetes.Â  Yet, according to Bassâ€™s uncontroverted testimony, he was NOT insulin dependant at any time while driving a truck for Kenco.Â  Thus, even if Kencoâ€™s legal theory were sound, it would fail because it is unsupported by the evidence.Â  We reject Kencoâ€™s position that the facts of this case do not support Bassâ€™s loss of earning capacity because he was not actually able to legally earn the income.\r\nB.Â  Award Under 42-9-30 Not Mandated\r\nIndubitably, the record supports an award under section 42-9-20.Â  Consequently, we disagree with Kencoâ€™s argument on appeal that the commission should have entered an award pursuant to section 42-9-30.Â  \r\nIn Lee v. Harborside Cafe, 350 S.C. 74, 564 S.E.2d 354 (Ct. App. 2002), this Court explained:\r\n\r\nGenerally, an injured employee may proceed under either the general disability sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20 or under the scheduled member section 42-9-30 in order to maximize recovery under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  See Brown v. Owen Steel Co., 316 S.C. 278, 280, 450 S.E.2d 57, 58 (Ct. App. 1994) (proceeding under the general disability sections for an injury to a scheduled member gives the claimant â€œthe opportunity to establish a disability greater than the presumptive disability provided for under the scheduled member section.â€). Only where a scheduled loss is not accompanied by additional complications affecting another part of the body is the scheduled recovery exclusive.Â  Id. (citing Singleton v. Young Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 471, 114 S.E.2d 837, 845 (1960)).\r\n\r\nLee at 78, 564 S.E.2d at 356.\r\nIn Stokes v. First National Bank, 298 S.C. 13, 21, 377 S.E.2d 922, 926 (Ct. App. 1988), affâ€™d by 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991), we held that â€œmental injuries are compensable if, as in heart attack cases, the mental injury is induced either by physical injury as in Kennedy or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.â€Â  Here, the commission found Bass incurred a mental injury as a result of the physical injury he sustained to his shoulder.Â  As found by the circuit court, the commissionâ€™s rulings concerning Bassâ€™s psychological and psychiatric problems\r\n\r\nare supported by the unrefuted opinions of the Employeeâ€™s regular physician, his psychiatrist, his psychologist, his vocational expert, and the Palmetto Health Alliance psychologist that the Employee suffered post-traumatic syndrome disorder, that he had an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, that his pain profile classification was â€œDysfunctional,â€ and that these problems were directly induced by the injuries sustained in the accident.Â  The Single Commissionerâ€™s order, adopted in full by the Hearing Panel, quoted liberally and convincingly from the records of those individuals and cited overwhelming support for the ultimate findings of the Commission in regard thereto.Â  Conversely, the Defendants proffered no contradictory evidence whatsoever either by way of APA submissions, cross-questioning of those experts, or deposition evidence.Â  Thus, not only was there substantial evidence to support the commissionâ€™s conclusions but in fact all of the evidence proffered on these points clearly and convincingly supported the Employeeâ€™s contentions.\r\n\r\nDr. Estefano stated: â€œIt is from this [shoulder] injury that Mr. Bass has developed severe depression and panic attack.â€Â  He observed that Bass had â€œdeveloped severe anxiety, severe depression, and excessive amount of pain on his shoulder due to his injury at work.â€Â  Psychologist Patricia Feigley opined Bassâ€™s â€œemotional problems have developed as a result of being injured and unable to work at his previous level.â€Â  In addition, Dr. Stuck declared: â€œI do sincerely believe that the anxiety and stress of his permanent disability and treatment through Workersâ€™ Comp has contributed to his emotional problems that heâ€™s now having.â€Â  These uncontroverted opinions adequately support the commissionâ€™s conclusion that Bassâ€™s post-traumatic syndrome disorder, panic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood were directly induced by the shoulder injury.\r\nThe record fully supports the commissionâ€™s finding that Bass suffered mental problems as a result of a physical injury.Â  Bass incurred two injuries; therefore, the award under section 42-9-20 was appropriate.Â  \r\nC.Â  Origin of Bassâ€™s Psychological and Emotional Problems\r\nIn light of the overwhelming evidence in the record, we reject Kencoâ€™s contention that the commission improperly awarded benefits to Bass for psychological and emotional problems.Â  \r\nâ€œA mental-mental injury is a purely mental injury resulting from emotional stimuli.â€Â  Doe v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Disabilities &amp; Special Needs, 364 S.C. 411, 418, 613 S.E.2d 785, 788 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).Â  In order to receive benefits for a mental-mental injury unaccompanied by a physical injury, a claimant must demonstrate the â€œstressful employment conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the normal conditions of the employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2004); Doe at 418, 613 S.E.2d at 788.Â  \r\nHowever, where â€œthe mental injury is induced by physical injury, it is not necessary that it result from unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.â€Â \r\nGetsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 335 S.C. 77, 80, 515 S.E.2d 104, 105-06 (Ct. App. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original) (quoting Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 482 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  Thus, a mental injury induced by a physical injury is compensable.Â  Doe at 420, 613 S.E.2d at 790; see also Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 298 S.C. 13, 377 S.E.2d 922 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œA condition, which is induced by a physical injury, is thereby causally related to that injury.â€Â  Doe at 420, 613 S.E.2d at 790.Â  \r\nKenco asserts that Bassâ€™s emotional injuries were not a result of his shoulder injury.Â  However, Kencoâ€™s contention is not a legal argument, but a factual one.Â  The evidence of record overwhelmingly supports the commissionâ€™s conclusion that Bassâ€™s mental problems were born out of his shoulder injury.Â  The opinions of Dr. Stuck, Psychologist Feigley, and Dr. Estefano all unequivocally link Bassâ€™s psychological issues directly to his physical injury.Â  The commission is the finder of fact.Â  Substantial evidence supports the commissionâ€™s finding.\r\n\r\n    III.Â  Credit for Temporary Benefits\r\nThe commissionerâ€™s order stated: \r\n\r\nI conclude that the Claimant has suffered this wage loss for the maximum period of 340 weeks for permanent partial disability pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20.Â  I further find that the Claimantâ€™s partial disability began after a period of total disability and therefore pursuant to said section the amounts paid for temporary total disability shall not be deducted from the maximum of 340 weeks allowed for permanent partial disability.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  Kenco argues the commission should have given it credit for the temporary total benefits paid after maximum medical improvement.Â  \r\nThe pertinent sentence in section 42-9-20 provides: â€œIn case the partial disability begins after a period of total disability, the latter period shall not be deducted from a maximum period allowed in this section for partial disability.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985).Â  \r\nDr. Midcap released Bass on June 19, 2001 with a 10% permanent impairment to the left upper extremity and placed him on permanent work restrictions.Â  Bassâ€™s depression began as a result of and after this period of temporary total disability.Â  The period of total disability of the shoulder is separate and distinct from the subsequent period of permanent partial general disability stemming from psychological issues.Â  Thus, Bass was paid total temporary benefits only for the uncontested period of his physical disability.Â  Accordingly, the commissioner correctly applied section 42-9-20 and declined to give Kenco a credit for temporary benefits paid.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Maximum Medical Improvement\r\nThe commissioner found â€œClaimant has a) reached maximum medical improvement as to his physical injuries; b) has not reached maximum medical improvement with respect to his psychiatric and psychological complications; and c) is in need of ongoing psychiatric and psychological treatment including prescription medications under the direction of Dr. Estefano.â€Â  \r\nKenco argues that â€œ[p]rior to reaching MMI, the claimant is not entitled to permanent benefits.â€Â  At the hearing before the circuit judge, counsel for Kenco surmised: â€œYou cannot have an order saying that he is partially at MMI and partially not at MMI.â€Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nKenco has proffered no precedent or rationale demonstrating error in the commissionerâ€™s finding that Bass had reached maximum medical improvement for his shoulder injury but not for his psychological problems.Â  Furthermore, we disagree with Kencoâ€™s statement that Bass should not have been awarded permanent benefits if he was not at maximum medical improvement.Â  A declaration of maximum medical improvement is irrelevant to the award of permanent partial disability in this case.Â  â€œâ€˜Maximum medical improvementâ€™ is a distinctly different concept from â€˜disability.â€™â€Â \r\nDodge v. Bruccoli, 334 S.C. 574, 581, 514 S.E.2d 593, 596 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nâ€œMaximum medical improvement is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.â€Â \r\nOâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  It is true that when a claimant receiving temporary benefits reaches maximum medical improvement and is still disabled, temporary benefits are terminated and the claimant is awarded permanent benefits.Â  Smith v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 335 S.C. 396, 399, 517 S.E.2d 694, 696 (1999) (â€œThe rationale for ceasing temporary benefits upon a finding of MMI is to permit entry of a permanent award.Â  Clearly, if an employee has reached MMI and remains disabled, then his injury is permanent.Â  This is precisely the reason to terminate temporary benefits in favor of permanent benefits upon a finding of MMI.â€).Â  It does not follow, however, that a claimant who has not reached maximum medical improvement is precluded from an award of permanent benefits.Â  \r\nThe commissionerâ€™s order documents Dr. Estefanoâ€™s prognosis that â€œâ€˜as long as Mr. Bass suffers from his work-related injury, he will continue to suffer mentally, emotionally, and financially.â€™â€Â  There is no evidence in the record rebutting or contradicting Dr. Estefanoâ€™s conclusion.Â  Therefore, the only evidence in the record indicates Bassâ€™s condition is permanent.Â  The award of permanent partial disability was proper.Â  The evidence supports the finding that Bass had reached maximum medical improvement with respect to his shoulder, but not his mental injuries.Â  Therefore, we find the circuit court properly refused to remand the case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the circuit court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4047","title":"Carolina Water Service v.

Bryan, Jr., both of Columbia and Nikki G. Setzler, of West Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case arises out of a condemnation action initiated by Lexington County Joint Municipal Water and Sewer Commission (Joint Commission) to acquire certain facilities owned by Carolina Water Service (Carolina Water) and Utilities, Inc. (Utilities).Â  In response, Carolina Water, Utilities and the Town of Lexington (Town) filed actions challenging the Joint Commissionâ€™s right to condemn these systems (Challenge Actions).Â  Carolina Water then sought to stay the condemnation proceeding pursuant to section 28-2-470 of the South Carolina Code (1991).Â  The circuit court issued an order staying both the condemnation proceeding and the Challenge Actions until the resolution of a related case then pending before the South Carolina Administrative Law Court.[1]Â  At issue in this appeal is the authority of the circuit court to lift that portion of the stay relating to the Challenge Actions.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nThis case relates to an ongoing dispute concerning water service in Lexington County.Â  Carolina Water is a private wastewater utility company that owns and operates several wastewater treatment facilities, including the I-20 facility and the Watergate facility, which are the subjects of this litigation.Â  Carolina Water is a voting member on the Central Midlands Council of Governments (Council), which is a regional council of county and municipal governments with various planning responsibilities for the Central Midlands region.Â  The Town is also a voting member on the Council.Â  \r\nSection 208 of the federal Clean Water Act provides a framework for states, through local and regional governmental authorities, to create and implement area-wide waste treatment management plans to control water pollution.Â  Pursuant to federal law, the Governor has designated the Council as the area-wide waste treatment-planning agency for the Central Midlands region.Â  Under state law, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) has been designated the state agency authorized to implement South Carolinaâ€™s Continuing Planning Process, which must be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)Â  under the Clean Water Act.Â  The Council is responsible for creating and updating a Section 208 Plan for the Central Midlands region.Â  DHEC is responsible for certifying the Section 208 Plan with the EPA.Â Â  \r\nIn 1993, the Section 208 Plan for the Central Midlands region was amended to require the closure of Carolina Waterâ€™s I-20 and Watergate facilities.Â  A 1997 amendment called for the removal of all domestic wastewater discharges into the lower Saluda River and also provided that the I-20 and Watergate facilities be replaced by connection to the Townâ€™s regional sewer system.Â Â  \r\nA dispute erupted between Carolina Water and the Town concerning the financial terms under which Carolina Water would connect the I-20 and Watergate facilities to the Townâ€™s regional sewer line.Â  In 2000, Carolina Water and the Town entered into a compromise agreement which would allow the I-20 plant to continue discharging wastewater into the Saluda River on a permanent basis after expanding the plant to handle 990,000 gallons per day.Â  This agreement was submitted to the Council, which adopted the proposed amendment to the Section 208 Plan and transmitted it to DHEC for certification.Â Â  \r\nDHEC rejected the proposed amendment.Â  Among the reasons for the rejection was the amendmentâ€™s inconsistency with the existing 208 Planâ€™s focus on providing more cost-effective water service by consolidating small, public or private domestic wastewater facilities into larger public, regional facilities.Â  Additionally, the proposed amendment authorized continued discharges into the lower Saluda River, which has been designated as a unique natural resource qualifying for special protections under the South Carolina Scenic Rivers Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-29-230(3) (Supp. 2004).Â  Finally, the proposed amendment did not consider alternative proposals that would allow for implementation of the aims of the existing 208 Plan.Â  One such proposal cited was an effort by the Joint Commission to acquire the I-20 facility through its eminent domain power and then to connect it to the Townâ€™s regional sewer line.Â Â  \r\nAn appeal was filed with the Administrative Law Court challenging DHECâ€™s authority to nonconcur in the amendment to the Section 208 Plan.Â  On March 6, 2001, however, before the Council adopted the amendment to the Section 208 Plan, the Joint Commission initiated the instant condemnation action to acquire the I-20 and Watergate facilities.Â  Carolina Water, Utilities, and the Town filed the Challenge Actions and moved for enforcement of the automatic stay pursuant to section 28-2-470 of the South Carolina Code.Â Â Â  \r\nOn October 3, 2002, after the DHEC case had been heard before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), but before the ALJ issued an opinion, the circuit court issued an order staying all proceedings relating to the condemnation action pending resolution of the matter before the ALJ.Â  The circuit court found that the matter before the ALJ, involving the validity of the Section 208 Plan, would control the future use of the wastewater treatment facility at issue in the instant case, and would therefore have a direct impact on the issue of the Joint Commissionâ€™s right to condemn Carolina Waterâ€™s facility.Â Â  \r\nThe ALJ subsequently issued an opinion reversing DHECâ€™s decision.Â  The ALJ found that DHEC had no authority to refuse certification of the plan once it was adopted by the Council.Â Â  DHEC was therefore ordered to certify the Section 208 amendment allowing Carolina Waterâ€™s facility to remain in operation.Â Â  The ALJâ€™s decision was appealed to the Full Board of DHEC.Â  \r\nIn the interim, the Joint Commission filed a Rule 59(e) motion requesting that the circuit court reconsider its order imposing the stay in the instant matter.Â  In this motion, the Joint Commission argued that the stay order exceeded the bounds of the automatic stay under section 28-2-470 in that it stayed not only the condemnation action, but the Challenge Actions as well.Â  The Joint Commission maintained that the courtâ€™s action was improper because it violated the statutory priority given to eminent domain actions under section 28-2-310(C) of the South Carolina Code (1991), in that final resolution of the Section 208 Plan matter before the ALJ would have no bearing on the Joint Commissionâ€™s condemnation action.Â Â  \r\nIn June of 2003, a status conference was held, and during this conference, the propriety of lifting the stay was discussed.Â  Following the status conference, the circuit court decided to dissolve the stay.Â  On February 4, 2004, the circuit court issued an order lifting the stay and allowing the Challenge Actions to go forward.Â  The automatic stay of the condemnation action pursuant to section 28-2-470 remained intact, however.Â  The circuit court also issued a scheduling order on the same date.Â Â Â  \r\nCarolina Water filed a motion to alter or amend requesting the circuit court reconsider its ruling.Â  A motion for restoration of the stay or, in the alternative, for supersedeas was also filed.Â  While these motions were pending, the DHEC Board issued an order reversing the decision of the ALJ. Â Â The circuit court then denied Carolina Waterâ€™s motions.Â  Carolina Water, Utilities, and the Town (Appellants) have appealed from the order lifting the stay.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit court has discretion whether to grant a stay of a matter pending before the court.Â  Talley v. John-Mansville Sales Corp.,&nbsp;285 S.C. 117, 119, 328 S.E.2d 621, 623&nbsp;(1985); City of Spartanburg v. Belkâ€™s Depâ€™t Store of Clinton,&nbsp;199 S.C. 458, 480, 20 S.E.2d 157, 167 (1942).Â  Accordingly, the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion arises where the [circuit] court was controlled by an error of law or where its order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation,&nbsp;336 S.C. 373, 398, 520 S.E.2d 142, 155&nbsp;(1999).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe primary issue in this case is whether the circuit court erred in lifting the stay as to the Challenge Actions.Â  However, the Joint Commission raises several preliminary issues relating to the appealability of the stay order.Â  We address each in turn.Â  \r\nI. Appealability of the Stay Order\r\n\r\nA. Failure to Provide a Complete Record\r\n\r\nThe Joint Commission first argues that Appellantsâ€™ arguments have not been preserved for appeal because they failed to provide an adequate record.Â  However, the Joint Commission fails to explain how the record is deficient.Â  Conclusory arguments constitute an abandonment of the issue on appeal.Â  See Solomon v. City Realty Co., 262 S.C. 198, 201, 203 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1974).Â  A reference to supporting authority without any discussion of its applicability is conclusory and constitutes an abandonment of the partyâ€™s reliance on those cases.Â  State v. Tyndall,&nbsp;336 S.C. 8, 16, 518 S.E.2d 278, 282&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  Therefore, this argument is deemed abandoned.Â  \r\n\r\nB. Appellants Lack Standing Because They Are Not Aggrieved Parties\r\n\r\nThe Joint Commission next argues that Appellants lack standing to bring the appeal because they are not aggrieved parties.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 201, SCACR, provides that only parties aggrieved by an order may appeal.Â  â€œA party is aggrieved by a judgment or decree when it operates on his or her rights of property or bears directly on his or her interest.â€Â  Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort County,&nbsp;346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe Joint Commission maintains that Appellants have not been aggrieved by the lifting of the stay because the circuit court lifted only that portion of the stay relating to the Challenge Actions, but left the statutory automatic stay of the condemnation action intact.Â  This argument is without merit because it is the actions instituted by each of the Appellants that the lifting of the stay allows to go forward.Â  In the original stay order, the circuit court found that the matter pending before the ALJ would have a direct impact on the issue of the Joint Commissionâ€™s right to condemn the facility, a matter central to their cases.Â  The resolution of this case in favor of the Joint Commission and the resulting condemnation of the property would preclude Carolina Water from being able to repurchase the property should the DHEC case be decided in its favor.Â  See Indigo Realty Co., Ltd. v. City of Charleston,&nbsp;281 S.C. 234, 237, 314 S.E.2d 601, 603&nbsp;(1984) (holding that there is no equitable right of repurchase once property has been taken through the exercise of the eminent domain power).Â  Accordingly, we find each of the Appellants had standing to appeal as aggrieved parties under Rule 201.Â  \r\n\r\nC. Standing of the Town and Utilities to Appeal the Order\r\n\r\nThe Joint Commission further argues that Appellants lack standing to appeal the order lifting the stay because Appellants do not have a property interest in the subject property of the condemnation action.Â  This argument is not appropriate for review because it has not been raised as an issue in the order which was appealed.Â  The condemnation notice named Carolina Water and Utilities as landowners and the Town as an â€œOther Condemnee.â€Â  The circuit court determined in a separate order that the Town had standing to challenge the condemnation action. No appeal of this order was filed.Â  Therefore, this ruling is the law of the case and may not be challenged in this appeal.Â  \r\n\r\nD. Interlocutory Nature of the Order\r\n\r\nThe Joint Commission also argues the order is not appealable because it is an interlocutory order and does not involve the merits.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004).Â  In Hiott v. Contracting Services, 276 S.C. 632, 633, 281 S.E.2d 224, 225 (1981), the supreme court found that an order granting a stay was immediately appealable, stating â€œ[i]n this State, a stay is appealable.â€Â  By inference, an order lifting a stay is also appealable.Â Â  We therefore proceed to the merits.Â  \r\nII. Merits of the Appeal\r\nAppellants argue that the order lifting the stay was an abuse of discretion because it was not supported by adequate facts and was controlled by an error of law.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 28-2-470 of the South Carolina Code (1991) authorizes a landowner to bring a separate action challenging a condemnorâ€™s right to condemn the subject property.Â  That section also provides that â€œ[a]ll proceedings under the Condemnation Notice are automatically stayed until the disposition of the action . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  Consequently, when the Challenge Actions were filed, the Joint Commissionâ€™s condemnation proceeding was automatically stayed by operation of law.Â  However, the circuit court went further in its stay order and also stayed the Challenge Actions pending resolution of the related DHEC case then before the ALJ.Â  \r\nThe order lifting the stay in this case did not purport to disturb the statutory stay on the condemnation proceeding, but dissolved the stay only as to the Challenge Actions.Â Â  Therefore, section 28-2-470 is not implicated, and the only question is whether the order lifting the stay prejudiced Appellants in some manner so as to constitute an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nAppellants first argue the circuit court abused its discretion in lifting the stay because the only thing that happened subsequent to the order granting the stay was the reversal of the ALJâ€™s decision by the DHEC Board.Â  The circuit court cited two pertinent factors in reaching its decision to lift the stay: (1) the long delay in waiting for resolution of the appeals in the DHEC case; and (2) provisions in the South Carolina Eminent Domain Act which assign priority to condemnation cases.Â Â  \r\nA long delay in waiting for resolution of a related case is not a sufficient reason for refusing to grant a stay when conclusion of the proceeding before the court could act as a bar to relief in the related case.Â  Talley v. John-Mansville Sales Corp., 285 S.C. 117, 118-19 n.2, 328 S.E.2d 621, 622-23 n.2 (1985).Â  The Talley court stressed, however, that such a stay is proper only under the most exceptional circumstances.Â  Id.Â  A stay was also found appropriate before the merger of law and equity when the same parties and the same subject matter were involved in both an action at law and a suit in equity.Â  Rush v. Thompson, 203 S.C. 106, 112, 26 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1943).Â  The court held that the equitable suit should be stayed to prevent deprivation of the right to a jury trial on the legal issues.Â  Id. at 112, 26 S.E.2d at 414.Â  It is therefore appropriate to consider whether resolution of the DHEC case will finally determine some aspect of Appellantsâ€™ case.Â  \r\nAppellants argue that resolution of the DHEC case will have a direct bearing on this case, and therefore, the circuit court abused its discretion by lifting its stay. However, as the Joint Commission argued at the hearing, and continues to argue, it plans to condemn the property regardless of the resolution in the DHEC case.Â  The only issue in the DHEC case is whether DHEC has authority to withhold consent to a proposed amendment to section 208 of the Clean Water Act.Â  In the case at bar, the Joint Commission asserts numerous reasons for exercising its eminent domain power, some of which have nothing to do with section 208 of the Clean Water Act.Â  Thus, even if the DHEC case were resolved in Appellantsâ€™ favor, the Joint Commissionâ€™s condemnation action would not be resolved.Â  \r\nFurthermore, section 28-2-310(C) of the South Carolina Code (1991) provides that an eminent domain proceeding must be given precedence over other civil cases for trial if either the condemnor or the landowner so demands.Â  Because the Joint Commission is seeking to expedite the process, the circuit court was within its discretion to consider the need to dissolve the stay to avoid unnecessarily delaying the condemnation action.Â  \r\nAppellants further contend that the stay is justifiable because of the rule announced in Indigo Realty Co., Ltd. v. City of Charleston, 281 S.C. 234, 314 S.E.2d 601 (1984).Â  In Indigo Realty the property owner sold a building to the city after being threatened with condemnation.Â  Id. at 235, 314 S.E.2d at 602.Â  Six months later the city decided not to widen the street, thus negating the public purpose for which the property was sold.Â  Id.Â  The property owner sought an injunction ordering the City to reconvey the property.Â  Id. at 235, 314 S.E.2d at 602.Â  The court refused to do so, holding that creating an equitable right of repurchase would place an unnecessary cloud on the title of property taken through eminent domain.Â  Id. at 237, 314 S.E.2d at 603.Â  \r\nAppellants maintain that under the Indigo Realty rule, if the condemnation action proceeds to a conclusion and the property is taken, they will be deprived of the benefit of a decision in their favor in the DHEC case because they would be unable to repurchase the property.Â  However, because we have found that the Joint Commissionâ€™s condemnation action would proceed even if the DHEC case is resolved in Appellantsâ€™ favor, the Indigo Realty rule is inapplicable.Â  \r\nWe therefore find that this case does not involve the type of â€œmost exceptional circumstancesâ€ which would justify a stay that could delay resolution of this case for years.Â  See Talley, 285 S.C. at 119 n.2, 328 S.E.2d 621, 623 n.2.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s reasons for its decision were sufficient to preclude a finding of abuse of discretion.[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the order lifting the stay is immediately appealable.Â  On the merits, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in lifting the stay and allowing the Challenge Actions to go forward.Â  Accordingly, the order is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] By Act No. 202, effective April 26, 2004, the name of the South Carolina Administrative Law Judge Division was changed to the South Carolina Administrative Law Court. \r\n[2] We further note that the lifting of the stay can be sustained as an act of discretion within the circuit courtâ€™s authority to control its docket.Â  Courts have inherent power to stay proceedings in actions pending before them as part of their power to control their own docket.Â  1A C.J.S. Actions Â§ 244 (2004).Â  The granting or refusing of a stay is discretionary and should be exercised with caution after balancing competing interests.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4048","title":"Lizee v.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985).\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMary Lizee alleged she was injured on July 15, 2000, while working as a nurse for the Departmentâ€™s Crisis Stabilization Unit.Â  Lizee testified that a patient suffering from a severe diabetic reaction was running toward her and began to fall.Â  According to Lizee, she â€œcaught [the patient] and gently put her down on the floor,â€ which caused Lizee pain in her neck and back.Â  \r\nLizee spoke with two Department employees about the incident on the day it occurred.Â  The first of these was Matt Dorman, a health counselor for the Department.Â  Dorman was part of the Departmentâ€™s â€œMobile Crisis Unit,â€ another mental health facility separate from where Lizee worked.Â  On the day of the incident, however, Dorman was working with Lizee at the Crisis Stabilization Unit on a temporary, â€œfill-inâ€ basis.Â  Lizee described Dorman as â€œanother mental health counselor,â€ and she testified that Dorman had no supervisory authority over her and normally worked at a separate facility.Â  \r\nDorman was present immediately following the incident.Â  After the patientâ€™s needs had been addressed, Lizee told Dorman â€œwhat happened.â€Â  Dorman suggested she complete a report of the incident.Â  A report was completed, but Lizee was not sure whether she or Dorman filled it out.Â  When asked if she reviewed the report, Lizee stated, â€œI kind of remember and donâ€™t remember.â€Â  Although Dorman delivered a report of the incident â€œdowntown,â€ the record is devoid of evidence that the report contained any reference to Lizeeâ€™s injury.Â Â Â  \r\nLizee also reported the incident of the patientâ€™s fall to Julie Taylor, the program director for the Crisis Stabilization Unit and Lizeeâ€™s immediate supervisor.Â  Taylor was not working on the day of the incident.Â  However, Lizee telephoned Taylor at her home shortly after the incident occurred and described what had happened.Â  It is undisputed that Lizee did not inform Taylor of the injuries she suffered as a result of the incident, either on July 15 or the following Monday when Taylor returned to work or any other time.Â  \r\nFourteen months later, Lizee filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim form (Form 50).Â  The Department disputed the claim, contending that Lizee did not sustain a compensable injury and alternatively that she failed to provide timely notice of her alleged injury to the Department.Â  The single commissioner found that Lizee was permanently and totally disabled as a result of the July 15, 2000 incident, and further found that Lizee gave timely and proper notice of the injury to the Department.Â  The Department sought review to an appellate panel of the Commission, which affirmed the order of the single commissioner.Â  Appeal was taken to the circuit court, which affirmed the Commission.Â  The Department now appeals to this court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Any review of the full commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Accordingly, when confronted with a challenge to a factual determination by the Commission, this courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2005).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but is evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.â€ Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).Â  Conversely, where the Commissionâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law, this courtâ€™s review is plenary.Â  Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting that â€œ[a] reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of lawâ€).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Department argues the Commissionâ€™s finding that Lizee is permanently and totally disabled as a result of the July 15, 2000 injury is not supported by substantial evidence and that the Commissionâ€™s findings are not â€œsufficiently detailed.â€Â  We disagree on both counts.Â  The Commission, as the fact finder, found Lizeeâ€™s testimony credible and assigned weight to the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Donald Johnson, II.Â  As to Lizeeâ€™s claim of injury and disability, the record provides a sufficient basis under the substantial evidence standard of review to affirm the Commission.Â  Moreover, the claim of a deficient orderâ€”in connection with the injury and resulting disabilityâ€”is manifestly without merit.Â  Accordingly, the Commissionâ€™s determination that the July 15 work-related injury rendered Lizee permanently and totally disabled is affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR.[1]\r\nThe Department also argues the Commissionâ€™s finding that Lizee provided timely and proper notice of her injury to her employer is erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  We agree. \r\nSection 42-15-20 of the South Carolina Code (1985) initially provides that â€œnotice of the accidentâ€ shall be given to the employer â€œwithin ninety days after occurrence of the accident.â€Â  The claimant bears the burden of proving compliance with these notice requirements.Â  Lowe v. Am-Can Transport Services, Inc., 283 S.C. 534, 537-38, 324 S.E.2d 87, 89 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nAt issue here is the status of Matt Dorman.Â  During oral argument, Lizee conceded that her ability to establish compliance with the notice provision of section 42-15-20 turns on whether Dorman may be fairly characterized as a â€œsupervisor.â€Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 459, 562 S.E.2d 679, 683 (Ct. App. 2002) (construing section 42-15-20 and concluding â€œthat notice is adequate, when there is some knowledge of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and signifying to a reasonably conscientious supervisor that the case might involve a potential compensation claimâ€) (emphasis added); see also Bass v. Isochem, __ S.C. __,Â  617 S.E.2d 369, 379 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that â€œ[w]hile the notice requirement must be construed liberally in favor of claimants, it is â€˜not to be treated as a mere formality or technicality and dispensed with as a matter of course.â€™â€ (quoting Mintz v. Fiske-Carter Constr. Co., 218 S.C. 409, 414, 63 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1951)); 7 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 126.03[2][a] (2005) (noting that â€œ[g]enerally, in order that the knowledge be imputed to the employer, the person receiving it must be in some supervisory or representative capacity, such as foreman, supervisor . . . .â€ (footnotes omitted)).\r\nIn the instant case, Lizee admitted she did not inform her supervisor, Julie Taylor, of the injury she suffered as a result of the July 15, 2000, incident.Â  Indeed, Lizee testified she telephoned Taylor on July 15 to report that an incident had occurred involving a patient, but she did not inform Taylor of any injury she had sustained:\r\n\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Now, on Saturday, July 15, 2000, you did call Ms. Taylor at home, correct?\r\nLIZEE: Yes.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: And you told Ms. Taylor that you had caught a patient from falling; is that correct?\r\nLIZEE: Yes.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: You didnâ€™t tell Ms. Taylor that you had injured yourself; is that correct?\r\nLIZEE: Right.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL:Â  And Ms. Taylor then came back to work on that following Monday; isnâ€™t that correct?\r\nLIZEE: Yeah.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: And after you called Ms. Taylor on Saturday, July 15, and told her that you had caught a patient falling, you never told her that you had in fact had an accident on the job and that you had injured your back or your neck or any part of your body?Â  You never told her that you injured yourself on Saturday, July 15th, isnâ€™t that correct?\r\nLIZEE: Yes.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: And you never reported that you had injured yourself to anybody else at the Department of Mental Health; isnâ€™t that correct?\r\nLIZEE: Yes.\r\n\r\nThe only person Lizee purportedly informed of her injury was Dorman, an individual Lizee described as â€œanother counselor at the centerâ€ who Lizee admits did not serve in any supervisory capacity over her.Â  As noted above, Dorman usually worked at another mental health facility and was working with Lizee on a temporary or â€œfill-inâ€ basis on the day of the incident.Â  Indeed, when asked at the hearing who was â€œin chargeâ€ at the Crisis Stabilization Center on the July 15, 2000, Lizee testified she was.Â Â  \r\nAfter carefully reviewing this testimony and the record as a whole, we find Lizeeâ€™s claimed attempt to notify the Department of her injury does not meet the standard contemplated under section 42-15-20.Â  Under the facts and circumstances of this case, Lizeeâ€™s decision to inform only Dorman deprived the Department of the notice it was entitled to receive under the statute.Â  Generally, a mere co-worker has no duty to report or follow-up on an injury sustained by a fellow employeeâ€”especially in a large, complex organization such as the Department of Mental Health.Â  There is certainly no evidence in the present case that Dorman, as simply â€œanother counselorâ€ from a separate facility, was under any such obligation.Â  The requirement that notice be sufficient to put a â€œreasonably conscientious supervisorâ€ on notice recognizes the fact that those charged with managing and supervising employees bear the responsibility of taking action and informing others in the organizationâ€™s leadership structure of the need to take action to protect the interests of the employee and the organization.Â  The record before us is devoid of any evidence that notice was provided to any supervisor or other person of comparable standing at the Department.\r\nWe now turn to the final provision in section 42-15-20 which provides that the failure to timely notify the employer does not automatically defeat a claim.Â  The statute specifically states that the failure to provide notice precludes compensation â€œunless reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the Commission for not giving such notice and the Commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced thereby.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985).Â  In the present case, the Commission did not address this â€œreasonable excuseâ€ and â€œprejudiceâ€ provision of the statute.Â  Lizeeâ€™s entitlement to compensation hinges on this very determination.Â  We decline to make findings in this regard.Â  Gray v. Laurens Mills, 231 S.C. 488, 491-93, 99 S.E.2d 36, 38 (1957) (noting that the Commission is required to make findings on the â€œreasonable excuseâ€ and â€œprejudice,â€ and a remand is appropriate when the Commission fails to make such findings); Harpe v. Kline Iron &amp; Metal Works, 219 S.C. 527, 532-33, 66 S.E.2d 30, 32 (1951) (holding that it is the Commissionâ€™s function to make findings concerning the defense of reasonable excuse for failure to give notice and prejudice to the employer).Â  Accordingly, we remand to the Commission to make findings as to the â€œreasonable excuseâ€ and â€œprejudiceâ€ provision of section 42-15-20.[2]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reasons, the judgment of the circuit courtâ€”and hence the Commissionâ€”is affirmed in part, reversed in part and the case is remanded to the circuit court, which shall send the case back to the Commission.Â  The Commission shall make specific findings as to the â€œreasonable excuseâ€ and â€œprejudiceâ€ provision of section 42-15-20. The Commission may, in its discretion, take additional evidence to accomplish the remand objective. \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We address the merits of Lizeeâ€™s disability claim in the interest of judicial economy and to increase the opportunity for finality on remand.Â  See&nbsp; Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 26, 602 S.E.2d 772, 781 (2004); Floyd v. Horry County School Dist., 351 S.C. 233, 234, 569 S.E.2d 343, 344 (2002).\r\n[2]&nbsp; The Department opposes a remand since the claimant relied on having provided timely notice at the hearing.Â  We believe remand is appropriate for four reasons.Â  First, the informal nature of administrative proceedings before the Commission is inconsistent with the exacting procedural hurdles the Department seeks to impose on Lizee and claimants like her.Â  See 82 Am. Jur. 2d Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§ 516 (2005) (â€œInformal proceedings are encouraged in workersâ€™ compensation cases and are so designed that the commission can best ascertain the rights of the parties and prevent unnecessary delays, costly appeals, and rehearings.â€).Â  Second, we adhere to the principle that workersâ€™ compensation laws in general, and notice requirements in particular, are to be liberally construed in favor of claimants and coverage.Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 458, 562 S.E.2d 679, 683 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Third, the Commissionâ€™s adoption of Lizeeâ€™s position on notice removed the need for her to pursue the alternative â€œreasonable excuseâ€ and â€œprejudiceâ€ prong of section 42-15-20.Â  See Harpe, 219 S.C. at 533, 66 S.E.2d at 32 (noting that in cases where timely notice was found there was no discussion of â€œreasonable excuseâ€ or â€œprejudiceâ€).Â  Finally, we recognize that it is not the claimantâ€™s burden to show the absence of prejudice, but it is the employerâ€™s burden to prove the presence of prejudice.Â  Dawkins v. Capitol Const. Co., 252 S.C. 536, 539, 167 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1969) (the burden of proving prejudice lies with the employer).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4050","title":"The Roof Doctor v.

Weatherholtz, of Charleston, for Respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  The Roof Doctor, Inc. filed this action in magistrateâ€™s court alleging Birchwood Holdings, Ltd. breached a contract.Â  Birchwoodâ€™s answer contained a general denial and a counterclaim.Â  The magistrate entered judgment for Roof Doctor, but reduced the award based on Birchwoodâ€™s counterclaim.Â  The magistrate denied Roof Doctorâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Roof Doctor appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court ruled that an alleged unauthorized practice of law by Birchwood was not a ground for reversal or voidance of the magistrateâ€™s judgment.Â  Roof Doctor appeals.Â  We affirm in result.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRoof Doctor sued Birchwood alleging it failed to pay for roofing work done pursuant to contract.Â  Birchwood answered, counterclaiming for damages allegedly caused by Roof Doctor.Â  Birchwoodâ€™s answer was accompanied by a letter to Chief Magistrate Richard B. Wood.Â  The letter, written by counsel for Birchwood, stated in part:\r\n\r\nI have assisted with the drafting of this Answer, but Defendant Birchwood Holdings, LTD has decided to appear for this hearing without representation.Â  As I understand the law, a corporation is permitted to appear and defend itself in Magistrateâ€™s Court without an attorney.Â  In the present case, Mr. Ray Jacobs would like to appear on behalf of Birchwood Holdings, LTD.Â  Please let me know if this will pose a problem.Â  In addition, should you require further proof of Mr. Jacobsâ€™ status as a company employee or specific authorization from Birchwood Holdings, LTD, please notify me at your convenience.Â  \r\n\r\nMichael J. McEachern, who signed the complaint as the president of Roof Doctor, was sent a copy of the letter.Â  \r\nMagistrate Kenneth A. Campbell, Jr. presided over the bench trial.Â  In his return, the magistrate found:\r\n\r\nPresent at the hearing was [Roof Doctor] represented by Mr. Michael J. McEachern and [Birchwood] being represented by Mr. Ray Jacobs.Â  Prior to the start of the hearing [Roof Doctor] raised the issue of the representation by Mr. Jacobs.Â  [Roof Doctor] was given the opportunity to continue the matter to allow [Birchwood] to [r]etain an attorney or authorization.Â  [Roof Doctor] indicated [it] did not wish to have the case continued.Â  \r\n\r\nThe magistrate found for Roof Doctor, but reduced the award because he found for Birchwood on its counterclaim.Â  Following the magistrateâ€™s ruling, Roof Doctor moved for reconsideration, arguing, inter alia: \r\n\r\nNeither the lower courts nor the parties appearing before them can waive certain rulings of the Supreme Court.Â  Finally, a technical point:Â  Mr. Jacobs was not authorized by Birchwood . . . to represent their interests in the case here.Â  While we went ahead despite this deficiency, it was neither my right nor yours [the magistrateâ€™s] to waive the requirement.Â  This is so simply because the proceeding could never be binding on Birchwood . . . i.e. if the judgment did not suit them, they were entirely free under our Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in In re the Unauthorized Practice of Law, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (1992), to disavow it.\r\n\r\nRoof Doctor asked for additional damages or a rehearing before a jury. Â The magistrate denied the motion for reconsideration.[2]Â  \r\nOn appeal to the circuit court, Roof Doctor raised issues of merit regarding the breach of contract action and again raised the issue of Mr. Jacobsâ€™ authorization to represent Birchwood.Â  At the hearing, Roof Doctor abandoned all issues except the issue of Mr. Jacobsâ€™ alleged unauthorized practice of law.Â  Roof Doctor argued that any actions by Birchwood at the trial in magistrateâ€™s court, as allegedly unauthorized, were invalid and therefore Birchwood did not appear at the hearing and the circuit court should enter judgment in favor of Roof Doctor.Â  The circuit court stated on the record:\r\n\r\nI think that it is within the Magistrateâ€™s discretion as to decide whether or not the authorization has been properly made, and that . . . on the circumstances of this case, the judgment cannot be collaterally attacked based on the Magistrateâ€™s . . . alleged failure to properly decide this question. \r\nOnce the Magistrate decides that the authorization is proper, that ends it.Â  And . . . secondly, . . . I think thereâ€™s a reasonable basis on which the Magistrate could have found that . . . Jacobs was properly authorized to represent Birchwood. \r\n\r\nIn the written order, however, the circuit court merely stated:Â  â€œThe decision to allow Jacobs to represent Birchwood is supported by the evidence.Â  Appeal affirmed.â€Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRoof Doctor argues the order on appeal is invalid because Birchwood participated in the unauthorized practice of law.[3]Â  In support of its argument, Roof Doctor asserts the letter from Birchwoodâ€™s counsel does not satisfy In re Unauthorized Practice of Law, which lists specific representatives that may provide written authorization on behalf of the business entity for non-lawyer representation.Â  Roof Doctor also argues the magistrate did not have the authority to allow the matter to proceed absent such written authorization.Â  \r\nOur supreme court has the constitutional duty to regulate the practice of law in South Carolina and accordingly has the power to define what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Â  See S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 4; Renaissance Enters. v. Summit Teleservices, Inc., 334 S.C. 649, 651-52, 515 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1999).Â  Modifying the long-standing rule that prohibited non-lawyers from representing businesses, the South Carolina Supreme Court now permits business entities to be represented by non-lawyers in civil magistrate court proceedings.Â  In re Unauthorized Practice of Law, 309 S.C. 304, 306, 422 S.E.2d 123, 124 (modifying State v. Wells, 191 S.C. 468, 5 S.E.2d 181 (1939)).Â  \r\nIn allowing the non-lawyer representation, the court mandated:Â  â€œThe magistrate shall require a written authorization from the entityâ€™s president, chairperson, general partner, owner or chief executive officer . . . before permitting such representation.â€Â  Id.Â  The court did not address the issue of a remedy if the written authorization was not obtained.Â  Id.Â  The court has, however, visited the issue of remedies where, unlike here, the unauthorized practice of law constituted part of the underlying contract in dispute.Â  See Linder v. Ins. Claims Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 560 S.E.2d 612 (2002).\r\nIn Linder, Mr. and Mrs. Linder suffered property loss from a fire at their home.Â  While their claim was being adjusted by their insurance carrier, the Linders consulted a public insurance adjusting firm, Insurance Claims Consultants (ICC), regarding its interpretation of what items should be covered under their policy.Â  The Linders entered into a contract with ICC and requested their insurer deal directly with ICC.Â  After executing the contract with ICC, the Linders released the lawyer they had retained.Â  Id. at 483-84, 560 S.E.2d at 616.Â  When the Linders failed to pay the fee to ICC, ICC sued them.Â  The Linders answered, asserting, inter alia, that ICC engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and the contract between them was void.Â  In addition, the Linders sought damages in tort from ICC.Â  The Linders also filed a declaratory judgment action in the South Carolina Supreme Court.Â  Id. at 485-86, 560 S.E.2d at 617.\r\nThe supreme court found that public insurance adjusting did not, per se, constitute the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Id. at 491, 560 S.E.2d at 620.Â  The court found, however, that ICC did more than public adjusting and that some of its activities constituted the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Id. at 494-95, 560 S.E.2d at 621-22.Â  The court found the contract between the Linders and ICC was not void as a matter of law.Â  The court concluded that ICC was not entitled to the compensation for ICCâ€™s services to the Linders that constituted the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Id. at 495-96, 560 S.E.2d at 622.Â  The court stated:Â  \r\n\r\nThe most appropriate manner in which to sanction [ICC] for [its] transgressions is for the trial court, in the underlying action, to determine the value of [ICCâ€™s] work which did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.Â  [ICC is] entitled to that amount, but [is] not to be compensated for any amount attributable to [its] unauthorized activities.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 496, 560 S.E.2d at 622.Â  In considering the Lindersâ€™ claim for damages in tort, the court found no private right of action for the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Id. at 496-97, 560 S.E.2d at 622. \r\nWe need not determine if Birchwood participated in the unauthorized practice of law because we agree with the trial court that the issue of unauthorized practice of law in this case is a collateral matter.Â  Unlike in Linder, the services performed pursuant to the contract in this case are not alleged to involve the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Rather, the alleged unauthorized practice of law occurred during Birchwoodâ€™s defense of the action on the contract.Â  Furthermore, the supreme court dismissed Roof Doctorâ€™s petition of this matter under the courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.Â  We conclude our supreme court has not yet addressed the issue of a remedy in the circumstances present in this case.Â  We accordingly look to foreign jurisdictions for guidance.\r\nIn Sawyer Co. v. Boyajian, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts discussed this issue.Â  5 N.E.2d 348 (Mass. 1936).Â  As we have here, the Sawyer court found it unnecessary to determine whether the alleged improper actions constituted the unauthorized practice of law and stated: \r\n\r\nIt may be assumed without decision that the alleged conduct . . . was an unauthorized practice of the law.Â  It is the contention of the defendant, in substance and effect, that the entire proceedings . . . were rendered void . . . even though there was no objection until after a finding had been made.Â  But few authorities support this position. . . . The authorities indicate that proceedings in an action, before any objection is made . . . are not vitiated by . . . [the unauthorized practice of law].Â Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 350.Â  The court also stated:Â  â€œThe case at bar is distinguishable from those wherein objection is made to further proceedings conducted by an unauthorized attorney.â€Â  Id.Â  In this case, although Roof Doctor raised the issue before the magistrate, Roof Doctor agreed to proceed on the merits.\r\nIn a similar case, the North Carolina Court of Appeals likewise assumed, without finding, that there was unauthorized practice of law.Â  In re Stroh Brewery Co., 447 S.E.2d 803, 806 (N.C. Ct. App. 1994).Â  The court concluded that dismissal of the appeal on the ground of unauthorized practice of law was not â€œan appropriate remedy.â€Â  Id.Â  The court found the issue was a collateral matter, unrelated to the merits of the appeal.Â  Id.Â  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also found a judgment rendered in a case where an unauthorized attorney practiced law is neither void nor subject to reversal.Â  Alexander v. Robertson, 882 F.2d 421, 425 (9th Cir. 1989). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that any unauthorized practice of law before the magistrate was a collateral matter not entitling Roof Doctor to reversal on appeal.Â  We decline to address whether the circuit court erred in finding Jacobs was authorized to represent Birchwood in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n AFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Roof Doctor initially appealed directly to the South Carolina Supreme Court.Â  The supreme court issued an order dismissing the appeal, stating â€œBecause these issues can be raised to the lower courts in the course of this action, we deny McEachernâ€™s request to address them in this Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.â€Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Although Roof Doctor argues the order is invalid, it does not request the order be declared void.Â  Rather, it requests this court reverse and remand for either a new trial or for entry of default.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4049","title":"State v.

Walker appeals his conviction for the murder of Rodrekus King.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn Thursday, March 21, 2002, Earnetta King served dinner to her boyfriend, Patrick Walker, and to her three children: Rodrekus, Brittany and Javario.Â  As the family gathered to eat, King tasted the food and accused someone of â€œadding something.â€Â  After denying that he had added anything, Walker blamed Rodrekus.Â  Rodrekus refuted the accusation.Â  Walker responded by slapping Rodrekus in the head.Â  At that point, King sent Brittany and Javario to their rooms.Â  At 2:15 a.m. on Friday, March 22, 2002, Rodrekus was pronounced dead as a result of multiple blunt-force injuries.\r\nBrittany King was nine years old at the time of her brotherâ€™s death.Â  She testified that after getting sent to her room, she proceeded into Rodrekusâ€™s room to watch cable television.Â  Before long, Brittany observed Walker pushing Rodrekus into the bedroom where she was.Â  According to Brittany, Walker was kicking and punching Rodrekus in the head, back and stomach.Â  Shocked, Brittany watched as Walker hit her brother with a metal broom stick on the left side of his body.Â  Rodrekus, who was naked, begged Brittany to help him, but Walker laughed, told her to â€œshut up,â€ and pushed her away.Â  Finally, Walker ordered Brittany out of Rodrekusâ€™s room, but she could hear the fighting continue as she went to sleep that night.Â  Later, Brittany was awakened by a loud â€œboomingâ€ sound.Â  She went back to sleep but woke up again when she heard ambulance sirens.Â  Shortly thereafter, Kingâ€™s father came to pick up Brittany and Javario.Â  Before they left, Walker kissed Brittany on the cheek and threatened her saying, â€œ[d]onâ€™t tell the police anything.Â  If you do, then Iâ€™ll kill you and your momma.â€\r\nAt 12:47 a.m. on March 22, paramedics were alerted that a thirteen-year-old boy had fallen, hit his head in the kitchen, and was having a seizure.Â  By 12:54 a.m., the EMS workers had arrived at Earnetta Kingâ€™s residence.Â  They found Rodrekus unclothed, pulseless, and unresponsive, laying face-up on the floor.Â  A shirtless Walker was attempting CPR.Â  Immediately, the EMS workers prepped Rodrekus for transport to the Greenville Memorial Hospital.Â  At 2:15 a.m., Dr. Allison Jones, an emergency room pediatric physician, declared Rodrekus dead.Â  \r\nAs Rodrekus was rushed to the hospital, Deputy Tangie Saylors escorted King to the Law Enforcement Center where she gave her statement to Investigator Paul Silvaggio.Â  King admitted whipping her son with a belt, thick switch, and metal-handled broom because she was upset with him for getting suspended from school.Â  Additionally, King confessed that she was â€œout of controlâ€ and could not stop hitting Rodrekus on his side and shoulder.Â  Because Rodrekus kept moving around as she was hitting him, King accidentally struck his head with the metal handle.Â  King stated Rodrekus fell in the kitchen and hit his head on the counter.Â  At that point, she ran him a bath.Â  As he was getting out of the bathtub, Rodrekus slipped, fell, and hit his head again.Â  According to King, Rodrekus went into convulsions.Â  She asked Walker for help, while she called 911.\r\nAt trial, King changed her testimony.Â  King professed that Walker was the sole assailant.Â  When she attempted to intervene, Walker hit her.\r\nPatrick Walker drove himself to the police station after Rodrekus was transported to the hospital.Â  Around 5 a.m. on March 22, Walker issued a statement to Investigator Silvaggio denying any culpability.Â  After Investigator Silvaggio received statements from both King and Walker, he allowed them to leave.Â  Investigator Silvaggio explained that they were not under arrest, but requested that they go home and stay there in case the police needed more information.\r\nOn the afternoon of March 22, Investigator Silvaggio attempted to serve Walker with an arrest warrant at his residence.Â  Neither he nor King was home.Â  Over the following weekend, Investigator Silvaggio visited Walkerâ€™s cousin while looking for Walker.Â  Investigator Silvaggio found Walkerâ€™s clothing at the cousinâ€™s house.Â  At that point, Investigator Silvaggio notified the fugitive squad because he feared that Walker could be on the run.Â  Walker turned himself in on Monday morning, March 25, 2002.\r\nDr. Allison Jones and Dr. Michael Ward were called as expert witnesses for the State.Â  Dr. Jones stated that she and the emergency room staff at Greenville Memorial were â€œhorrifiedâ€ by the number of bruises and cuts on Rodrekusâ€™ body.Â  According to the coloration of the bruises and the absence of any healing, most of the bruises â€œlooked fairly fresh.â€Â  In addition, half of Rodrekusâ€™ back was one big bruise.\r\nDr. Jones testified in detail regarding the injuries sustained by\r\nRodrekus:\r\n\r\nLarge freshly bleeding abrasion . . . with [extensive] scalp hematoma . . . .Â  He also had aÂ  . . . scabbed over abrasion to the top of the left ear . . . . Had . . . multiple scabbed cuts and abrasions over the tops of both of his shoulders, a very linear bruise in the middle of his chest, and an area with some superficial cuts and abrasions with a surrounding bruise.Â  The center area, he had a circular shaped bruise with these two linear pieces off of the edge of that circular bruise.Â  Another one-by-one centimeter abrasion or scrape to the inner surface of his arm, and a bruise with a circular or a crescent-shaped end and two linear streaks extending from that crescent-shaped area. . . . And another extensive massive bruise that had a lot of linear marks that overlapped and were through this area in different directions, indicating that there was some contact with something to make these lines in a variety of directions.\r\nHe also had some torn skin with bruised edges, some reddish subcuticular tissue . . . . Another linear bruise [on] . . . the inner surface of his knee, and multiple scabbed cuts and abrasions across the front parts of both of his legs.\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nThis also was another large bruised area that again coversâ€”this is the bottom of his scapula or his shoulder blade, and this . . . is the top of the hip or the top of his buttocks, and the bruise was about half of his back and obviously covered to the midline again. . . .\r\n.\r\nHe had another avulsed or torn piece of skin, J-shaped or circular in shape to the top of it with a linear or small cut that . . . appeared to . . . have the same pattern as the bruising on the front, but the skin was torn with a cut from that.\r\nAnother small cut to the soft tissue or the fleshy tissue of his buttocks, a three centimeter bruise up here on the back of his right arm.Â  Also interesting was that he had a lot of avulsed, torn skin into his fingers and his hand . . . where the skin looked like it had been torn not cut.Â  He had two side-by-side linear bruises . . . looking much like the pattern on the front that we saw with the lines. . . . [A] bruise . . . took up a good portion of his right side with a lot of that bruising over soft, fatty tissue over the buttocks.\r\n\r\nDr. Jones documented an extensive hematoma that covered half of Rodrekusâ€™s head.Â  The skin on his entire body was torn with bruised edges.Â  When asked if the bruises on Rodrekusâ€™s body would correspond with a fall in the kitchen or bathtub, Dr. Jones answered: â€œAbsolutely not.â€\r\nDr. Ward, a forensic pathologist and the medical examiner for Greenville County, examined Rodrekus post-mortem.Â  Dr. Ward explained:\r\n\r\n[I]n the chest and abdomen region there are multiple contusions and abrasions, or bruises and scratches. . . .Â  This is a patterned bruise of the skin which is often made by a cylindrical object that when it strikes the skin pushes the blood out to either side, causing a parallel type of bruise. . . . So this is here on the left anterior chest or the left front portion of the chest.\r\nThere are . . . deep scratches or abrasions on the chest and upper arm here at the shoulder, just to the left of nipple, and overlying the ribs . . . . [T]here was blood within the underlying subcutaneous tissues and musculature of the chest. . . . .\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Down on the abdomen there is a similar, again, parallel contusion of the skin. . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\n. . . [T]here was hemorrhage in basically three layers as we went down deeper . . . into the body.Â  First, the fat of the large intestine, then the small intestine, and then the deep tissues surrounding the pancreas and actually hemorrhage into the pancreas itself.\r\n. . . [On the thighs], there are . . . patterned contusions or bruises of the skin. . . . All of these . . . injuries [except one] showed no indication . . . that they were old, . . . they all appeared fresh with no healing.\r\nThe skin of the buttocks was diffusely bruised, much like the hands and the wrists.Â  And multiple incisions were made into the skin and underlying musculature of the buttocks, and there was a great deal of hemorrhage within the skin and musculature of both sides of the buttocks. . . .\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\n. . . [T]he injuries to the head of Rodrekus were limited to the left side and left back of his scalp.Â  There were three separate distinct injuries . . . . [There was] an area of abrasion or a scratch right in front of the left ear, right at the top portion of the left ear.Â  This is a linear abrasion right here, and this larger wound is a laceration or a tear in the skin, . . . caused by a blunt object with enough force to actually split the skin open or cause a laceration. . . . Rodrekusâ€™ scalp . . . was detached from the underlying bone.\r\n. . . [T]here was a collection of blood [in the scalp] called subgaleal hemorrhage . . . . [O]n top of the brain there was a collection of blood called subdural blood.Â  And then overlying the surface of the brain on the right and left . . . sides and overlying the cerebellum, . . . there was subarachnoid hemorrhage. . . . The brain was swollen . . . .\r\n\r\nDr. Ward found: (1) bruising and hemorrhaging on Rodrekusâ€™s arms, which were characteristic of defense-type injuries; and (2) bruising and abrasions on Rodrekusâ€™ back.Â  When Dr. Ward was asked if Rodrekusâ€™ injuries were consistent with him â€œhaving fallen down in the bathroom . . . and struck his head on the bathtub,â€ Dr. Ward responded: â€œI think it would be inconsistent with that. . . . This is not simply from a fall.Â  This is from multiple impacts to the side of the head. . . . [T]o receive this total constellation of injuries to the head region is not consistent with the fall but from several blows.â€Â  During the autopsy, Dr. Ward was provided with â€œpossible weaponsâ€ to compare to Rodrekusâ€™ injuries.Â  He stated several of the injury patterns were consistent with the â€œpossible weaponsâ€ provided to him: a broom and a belt buckle.Â  When questioned as to how Rodrekus received the injuries to his intestines and pancreas, Dr. Ward opined:\r\n\r\nA particular pattern of injury that we see in forensics is a blow with a fairly blunt object, often described as either a fist or a foot, from a punch or a stomp will leave an injury pattern like this. . . . [I]f the abdomen is soft enough or if the musculature of the abdomen is flaccid, then this fist or foot can completely compress the skin in the abdomen and basically squash or compress the organs between the skin and the backbone.Â  And I think thatâ€™s what happened in this case, that the large intestine and its fat were trapped; the small intestine and its fat were trapped; and the pancreas were all basically compressed by this striking object, causing the hemorrhage within that region. . . . It would have to be a very hard blow to cause hemorrhage around the pancreas, which is very deep.\r\n\r\nWalker and King were convicted of murder.Â  Both were sentenced to life imprisonment.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 199 S.E.2d 61 (1973); State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 577 S.E.2d 498 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThis Court does not reassess the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Furthermore, this Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Evidence of Defendantâ€™s Flight\r\nWalker claims the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his flight.Â  We disagree.\r\nFlight from prosecution is admissible as evidence of guilt.Â  State v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 608 S.E.2d 886 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Oct. 5, 2005); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 200, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (stating flight is â€œat least some evidenceâ€ of defendantâ€™s guilt); State v. Freely, 105 S.C. 243, 89 S.E. 643 (1916) (declaring the flight of one charged with crime has always been held to be some evidence tending to prove fault).Â  Likewise, evidence of flight has been held to comprise proof and signify evidence of defendantâ€™s guilty knowledge and intent. Â See State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); Town of Hartsville v. Munger, 93 S.C. 527, 77 S.E. 219 (1913); Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 405; State v. Brownlee, 318 S.C. 34, 455 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 1995); see also State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 292 S.E.2d 581 (1982) (finding evidence of flight admissible to show guilty knowledge, intent, and that defendant sought to avoid apprehension), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991); State v. Grant, 275 S.C. 404, 407, 272 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (â€œ[A]ttempts to run away have always been regarded as some evidence of guilty knowledge and intent.â€) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Davis, 354 S.C. 348, 580 S.E.2d 778 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that circumstances of defendantâ€™s flight from police after the attempted traffic stop allowed reasonable inference of guilty conduct).Â  Unexplained flight is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not as likely that one who is blameless and conscious of that fact would flee.Â  See Crawford, 362 S.C. at 635, 608 S.E.2d at 890; State v. Williams, 350 S.C. 172, 564 S.E.2d 688 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nFlight or evasion of arrest is an issue for the jury to consider.Â  See Beckham, 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d at 612; State v. Turnage, 107 S.C. 478, 93 S.E. 182 (1917).Â  â€œIn South Carolina, we recognize that evidence of flight [is] proper.Â  We also recognize that it is oftentimes appropriate for counsel to argue to the jury the inferences growing out of flight.â€Â  State v. Byers, 277 S.C. 176, 177-78, 284 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1981) (internal quotations omitted); see also Grant, 275 S.C. at 408, 272 S.E.2d at 171 (stating that while a jury charge on flight as evidence of guilt is improper, admission of evidence and argument by counsel concerning it are allowed).Â  The critical factor to the admissibility of evidence of flight is whether the totality of the evidence creates an inference that the defendant had knowledge that he was being sought by the authorities.Â  Beckham, 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d at 612; Crawford, 362 S.C. at 636, 608 S.E.2d at 891.Â  It is sufficient that circumstances justify an inference that the accusedâ€™s actions were motivated as a result of his belief that police officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking him for that purpose.Â  Crawford, 362 S.C. at 636, 608 S.E.2d at 891.\r\nThere is ample evidence that Walker fled his residence after Investigator Silvaggio asked him to stay at or nearby his home.Â  First, Investigator Silvaggio tried to serve the arrest warrant at his domicile, but neither Walker nor King was there.Â  At that time, Investigator Silvaggio searched for Walker at his relativesâ€™ homes, but instead of finding Walker, he found the clothes Walker had been wearing the night Rodrekus was killed.Â  Because of Walkerâ€™s unexplained absence, Investigator Silvaggio was forced to notify the fugitive squad.Â  Although Walker argues he was not aware that he had been charged with a crime and therefore could not have been avoiding arrest, he turned himself into the police on Monday.Â  Moreover, it can be inferred from his sudden disappearance that Walker was either expecting the police to arrest him or he was planning his escape.\r\nIn South Carolina, a defendantâ€™s flight is admissible evidence.Â  Thus, the trial judge in the instant case did not abuse his discretion by allowing evidence of Walkerâ€™s flight.\r\nII.Â  Severance\r\nA.Â  Abuse of Discretion\r\nWalker argues the trial court abused its discretion in failing to sever his trial from that of Earnetta King.Â  We find no error.\r\n Criminal defendants who are jointly tried for murder are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997); see also State v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 567 S.E.2d 523 (Ct. App. 2002) (clarifying that codefendants are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right).Â  A motion forseverance is addressed to the sound discretion of the\r\ntrial court.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 2002). Â The trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Tucker, 324 S.C. at 164, 478 S.E.2d at 26; State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 447 S.E.2d 177 (1993); Simmons, 352 S.C. at 350, 573 S.E.2d at 860.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Lopez, 352 S.C. 373, 574 S.E.2d 210 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThere can be no clearly defined rule for determining when a defendant is entitled to a separate trial, because the exercise of discretion means that the decision must be based upon a just and proper consideration of the particular circumstances which are presented to the court in each case.Â  State v. McIntire, 221 S.C. 504, 71 S.E.2d 410 (1952); State v. Castineira, 341 S.C. 619, 535 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d, 351 S.C. 635, 572 S.E.2d 263 (2002).Â  A severance should be granted only when there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of a codefendant or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about a codefendantâ€™s guilt.Â  Harris, 351 S.C. at 652-53, 572 S.E.2d at 273; State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999). Â An appellate court should not reverse a conviction achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a reasonable probability that the defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate trial.Â  Hughes v. State, 346 S.C. 554, 552 S.E.2d 315 (2001).\r\nA defendant who alleges he was improperly tried jointly must show prejudice before this court will reverse his conviction.Â  Dennis, 337 S.C. at 281, 523 S.E.2d at 176; State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 188 S.E.2d 379 (1972); see also State v. Thompson, 279 S.C. 405, 308 S.E.2d 364 (1983) (noting that for reversal, a defendant who was tried jointly must show prejudice).Â  The general rule allowing joint\r\ntrials applies with equal force when a defendantâ€™s severance motion is based upon the likelihood he and a codefendant will present mutually antagonistic defenses, i.e., accuse one another of committing the crime.Â  Hughes, 346 S.C. at 559, 552 S.E.2d at 317; Dennis, 337 S.C. at 281, 523 S.E.2d at 176.Â  The rule allowing joint trials is not impugned simply because the codefendants may present evidence accusing each other of the crime.Â  Dennis, 337 S.C. at 281, 523 S.E.2d at 176; State v. Smith, 359 S.C. 481, 597 S.E.2d 888 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe trial judge must act cautiously in allowing a joint trial.Â  Dennis, 337 S.C. at 281, 523 S.E.2d at 176.Â  The judge must carefully consider problems that may arise from a joint trial, such as redacted statements, and must assure protection of each defendantâ€™s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him.Â  Id. at 281-82, 523 S.E.2d at 176; State v. Singleton, 303 S.C. 313, 400 S.E.2d 487 (1991).Â  A proper cautionary instruction may help protect the individual rights of each defendant and ensure that no prejudice results from a joint trial.Â  Hughes, 346 S.C. at 559, 552 S.E.2d at 317; State v. Stuckey, 347 S.C. 484, 556 S.E.2d 403 (Ct. App. 2001); see also State v. Holland, 261 S.C. 488, 494, 201 S.E.2d 118, 121 (1973) (finding trial courtâ€™s cautionary instructions to the jury in a joint trial â€œprotected the rights of each individual appellantâ€).\r\nWalker asserts he should have been granted a separate trial because of antagonistic defenses between himself and King.Â  Each blames the other for the murder of Rodrekus.Â  These antagonistic defenses do not constitute the requisite prejudice.Â  More importantly, the trial judge had discretion to determine whether Walker should have been granted a separate trial.Â  Based on the evidence, the judge determined that separate trials were not needed.Â  Walker is not entitled to a separate trial as a matter of right.Â  We find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s determination.\r\nB.Â  Curative Instruction\r\nWalker alleges he was denied a fair trial based on the cross-examination testimony elicited from Investigator Silvaggio; the self-serving testimony of the co-defendant, Earnetta King; and testimony from the EMS worker.Â  Therefore, he maintains his motion for severance should have been granted.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, a curative instruction is deemed to have cured any alleged error.Â  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999); State v. Greene, 330 S.C. 551, 499 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œIf the trial judge sustains a timely objection to testimony and gives the jury a curative instruction to disregard the testimony, the error is deemed to be cured.â€Â  State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996); State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d 306 (1976); State v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477, 562 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A curative instruction to disregard incompetent evidence and not to consider it during deliberation is deemed to have cured any alleged error in its admission.Â  See State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nBecause a trial courtâ€™s curative instruction is considered to cure any error regarding improper testimony, a party must contemporaneously object to a curative instruction as insufficient or move for a mistrial to preserve an issue for review.Â  George, 323 S.C. at 510, 476 S.E.2d at 912; Patterson, 337 S.C. at 226, 522 S.E.2d at 850.Â  Therefore, this issue may not be preserved for review because the trial court sustained defense counselâ€™s objections and gave a thorough curative instruction without objection or request for a mistrial.\r\nAssuming arguendo the issue is preserved, adverting to the merits in the case sub judice, on four separate occasions the judge gave a curative instruction to the members of the jury.Â  Each time, the curative instruction was timely and complete.\r\nAs Investigator Silvaggio was being questioned, the judge determined that a question and an answer were both inappropriate and should be stricken from the record.Â  The judge elucidated:\r\n\r\n[T]here was a question that was asked of this witness and the response was given by the witness.Â  The question was: â€œdo you remember what she said?â€Â  And the response was: â€œShe indicated that Patrick Walker was the one that was beating Rodrekus and that she was trying to intervene in the assault between Patrick Walker and Rodrekus.Â  As a result of that, she too sustained injuries to her head, and that Patrick Walker was the sole assailant in the case.â€ . . . I have made a ruling that that question as well as the response was inappropriate at that stage and, therefore, you will disregard that question and also the witnessâ€™s response.\r\n\r\nDuring Kingâ€™s testimony, the judge properly gave a curative instruction: â€œPrior to the break in the testimony, the defendant made an unsolicited statement about some prior bad acts of Mr. Walker, and I will instruct you and you are ordered that you will disregard that statement by this defendant, and you are not to consider that statement in any form during your deliberations.â€\r\nThe EMS worker testified regarding Walkerâ€™s intimidating demeanor.Â  Immediately, the judge charged: â€œI ask the jury be instructed to disregard. You may disregard the last statement by the witness.â€Â  Prior to deliberations, the judge instructed:\r\n\r\nAs the trial judge it is my responsibility to preside over the trial of this case.Â  And I have also the duty to rule on the admissibility of evidence offered during this trial.Â  You are to consider only the competent evidence before you.Â  If there was any testimony offered stricken from the record in this case during this trial, you must disregard that testimony.Â  You are to consider only the testimony which has been presented from this witness stand, any evidence which has been made part of the record in this case and any stipulations of counsel.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the law extant on curative instructions, the trial judge responded with alacrity and exactitude when the inadmissible evidence was offered.Â  The potency of the judgeâ€™s curative instructions expunged and extirpated any alleged error.Â  Concomitantly, the motion for severance was properly denied.\r\nC.Â  Closing Argument\r\nWalker contends improper statements made by the co-defendantâ€™s attorney during closing argument deprived him of a fair trial.Â  Thus, he claims his motion for severance was erroneously denied.\r\nInitially, we note this issue may not be preserved for appellate review.Â  An issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 587 S.E.2d 683 (2002); State v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 611 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 2005); see also State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 611 S.E.2d 273 (Ct. App. 2005) (instructing that general rule of issue preservation states that if issue was not raised and ruled upon below, it will not be considered for first time on appeal).Â  Failure to object to comments made during argument precludes appellate review of the issue.Â  Carlson, 363 S.C. at 606, 611 S.E.2d at 293; State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 526 S.E.2d 248\r\n(Ct. App. 2000).Â  Walker did not contemporaneously object to the comments made by co-defendantâ€™s counsel during closing argument.Â  Consequently, this issue is not preserved.\r\nIII.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nWalker claims the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to a faulty indictment.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), our Supreme Court edified:\r\n\r\n[I]f an indictment is challenged as insufficient or defective, the defendant must raise that issue before the jury is sworn and not afterwards.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003) (â€œEvery objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer or on motion to quash such indictment before the jury shall be sworn and not afterwards.â€).Â  However, a defendant may for the first time on appeal raise the issue of the trial courtâ€™s jurisdiction to try the class of case of which the defendant was convicted.\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nThe indictment is a notice document.Â  A challenge to the indictment on the ground of insufficiency must be made before the jury is sworn as provided by Â§ 17-19-90.Â  If the objection is timely made, the circuit court should judge the sufficiency of the indictment by determining whether (1) the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense that is intended to be charged.Â  In determining whether an indictment meets the sufficiency standard, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the surrounding circumstances.Â  Further, whether the indictment could be more definite or certain is irrelevant. \r\n\r\nId. at 101-03, 610 S.E.2d at 499-500 (internal citations and footnote omitted).Â Â  \r\nThere was no challenge to the indictment prior to the jury being sworn. Based on Gentry, because Walker did not raise the sufficiency of the indictment before the jury was sworn, he cannot now raise this issue on appeal.Â  The issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Walkerâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4051","title":"Brunson v.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4051\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2005 â€“ Filed November 28, 2005\r\n\r\n APPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nVernon F. Dunbar, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nAndrea Pope, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This is an appeal from an interlocutory order of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  American Koyo Bearings and its insurance carrier, Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company, (collectively â€œEmployerâ€) appealed from an adverse ruling of the single commissioner to an appellate panel of the Commission.Â  The Commission vacated the single commissionerâ€™s order and remanded for a de novo hearing.Â  The claimant, Sharon Brunson, appealed from the Commissionâ€™s remand order to the circuit court, which dismissed the appeal as interlocutory.Â  We find this interlocutory order is not immediately appealable and join the circuit court in dismissing the appeal. \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBrunson worked for American Koyo Bearings for approximately three years on an assembly lineâ€”where she was exposed to chemicalsâ€”sorting and cleaning parts.Â  Brunson filed a Form 50 claiming that she developed contact dermatitis to her hands, arms, and other body parts as a consequence of her employment duties.Â  She further contended that she sustained injuries to her lungs, throat, voice box, vocal cords, nasal passages, and head arising from the scope of her employment.Â  \r\nIn response, Employer filed a Form 51 admitting that Brunson suffered from contact dermatitis, and further acknowledging the injury was compensable.Â  However, Employer denied any permanent impairment and further denied injury to the other body parts.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner determined that Brunson sustained multiple injuries by accident in the course of her employment, including the finding that Brunson suffered or contracted an occupational disease with respect to her dermatitis and respiratory problems.Â  As a result, Employer was ordered to pay temporary total disability benefits plus all causally related medical treatment and treatment recommended by Brunsonâ€™s physicians.Â  \r\nEmployer sought review by the Commission.Â  In its application for review and supporting memorandum, Employer did not challenge the compensability of the contact dermatitis. Â Â Â The Commission vacated the single commissionerâ€™s order and remanded for a de novo hearing.Â  \r\nBrunson appealed to the circuit court, arguing that certain findings made by the single commissioner were not cited as grounds for appeal and consequently should not be revisited on remand.Â  The circuit court ruled the Commissionâ€™s order interlocutory and not immediately appealable on the basis that the remand order neither affected the merits nor deprived Brunson of a substantial right.Â  The appeal was therefore dismissed.Â  We are now presented with the appealability of the Commissionâ€™s interlocutory order and Brunsonâ€™s claim that the Commissionâ€™s order affected her substantial rights.Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolina adheres to the final judgment rule.Â  Accordingly, with certain exceptions, an appeal lies only from a final judgment.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville,&nbsp;362 S.C. 191, 194-195, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708&nbsp;(2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(1) (1976 and Supp. 2004); Rule 72, SCRCP; Rule 201(a), SCACR.Â  By statute, an appeal from an interlocutory order is permitted in certain circumstances, including when the order is one â€œinvolving the merits . . . [or] affecting a substantial right.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(1) and (2).Â  Appeals from administrative bodies, such as the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, follow the same rules, such that an appeal will not lie from an interlocutory order of the Commission unless the order affects the merits or deprives the appellant of a substantial right.[1]Â  Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 79-80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Orders from the Commission remanding a case to the single commissioner for further proceedings generally do not affect the merits and are not considered final.Â  Chastain v. Spartan Mills, 228 S.C. 61, 65-67, 88 S.E.2d 836, 837-38 (1955).Â  \r\nBrunsonâ€™s claim of â€œsubstantial rightâ€ springs from the fact that Employer admitted the compensability of the contact dermatitis injury and took no exception to this ruling in the appeal to the Commission.Â  Brunson apparently believes the de novo hearing before the single commissioner includes all issues, including those not challenged in Employerâ€™s appeal to the Commission.Â  Brunson, however, is not required to relitigate unchallenged findingsâ€”which are the law of the caseâ€”including Employerâ€™s admission in connection with the contact dermatitis injury.Â  â€œThe findings of fact and law by the hearing commissioner become and are the law of the case, unless within the scope of the appellantâ€™s exception to the full commission . . . .â€Â  Green, 311 S.C. at 80, 427 S.E.2d at 687.Â  â€œOnly issues within the application for review under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-50 (1976) are preserved for appeal to the commission.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nEmployer candidly acknowledges in the final brief that remand to the single commissioner is limited to the â€œcontested issues.â€Â  See Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr.,&nbsp;350 S.C. 183, 189 n.1, 564 S.E.2d 694, 697 n.1&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (stating that any issues not argued in the brief are deemed abandoned).Â  As concerns the admitted injury, Employer concedes as follows:\r\n\r\nThe contact dermatitis was admitted by the employer.Â  Nothing in the full commissionâ€™s order or the circuit courtâ€™s order alters or eliminates that admission. Because the employer admits the contact dermatitis is compensable, the claimant may request medical treatment at any time from the employer.Â  Therefore, any unappealed finding regarding medical treatment or the compensability of the contact dermatitis does not affect the remand because it is already admitted.\r\n\r\nRespondentsâ€™ final brief at 10. \r\nIn light of the Commissionâ€™s regrettably conclusory remand order, Brunsonâ€™s reliance on Green v. City of Columbia is understandable, but nevertheless misplaced.Â  There, the single commissioner required the employee to make an election of remedies under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, and the employee did not object.Â  Green, 311 S.C. at 79, 427 S.E.2d at 686.Â  The employee made the election, and the single commissioner denied benefits.Â  Id.Â  An appeal was made to the Commission, but no challenge was lodged with respect to election of remedies.Â  The Commission, sua sponte, held the election requirement to be erroneous.Â  Id.Â  The Commission affirmed the denial of benefits but remanded the case for a hearing to determine if benefits were due under the other, previously abandoned claim.Â  Id.Â  The circuit court dismissed the appeal, finding the order interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  Green, 311 S.C. at 79, 427 S.E.2d at 687.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe reversed and held the Commissionâ€™s error in reaching an issue not raised in the application for review affected the merits.Â  Green, 311 S.C. at 80, 427 S.E.2d at 687.Â  We therefore found the remand order immediately appealable.Â  \r\nHere, unlike Green, the Commission did not rule on any issue, but merely entered a remand order for a de novo hearing.Â  Since the Commissionâ€™s authority, by operation of law, extends only to those issues within the application for review, the hearing on remand is similarly restricted.Â  In short, the compensability of Brunsonâ€™s contact dermatitis is the law of the case, and thus the remand order neither involves the merits nor affects a substantial right. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSince the remand to the single commissioner is limited to those matters included in Employerâ€™s appeal to the Commission, the compensability of Brunsonâ€™s contact dermatitis claim will not be relitigated.Â  Accordingly, the Commissionâ€™s remand order neither involves the merits nor affects a substantial right.Â  The circuit court correctly dismissed the appeal from this interlocutory order.Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED. \r\n HEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.  \r\n\r\n[1] Brunson attempts to raise numerous grounds on appeal beyond the appealability issue.Â  However, the only ruling obtained from the circuit court relates to the appealability of the Commissionâ€™s order.Â  Thus, the remainder of the issues are not properly preserved for appeal.Â  See, e.g., Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,&nbsp;361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-780&nbsp;(2004) (holding that issues and arguments are preserved for appellate review only when they are raised to and ruled on by the lower court).Â  Our dismissal of this appeal as interlocutory, in any event, precludes us from addressing the remaining issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4052","title":"Smith v.

Drayton Hastie, Jr., in her action for breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, civil conspiracy, fraud, and fraud in the inducement, all arising from Hastieâ€™s creation of a family limited partnership for Smith and her family.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 1991, Smith and her husband, Everett L. Smith (Everett), began marriage counseling because of unspecified marital difficulties.Â  During August and September 1991, Everett and Hastie, with whom Everett had developed a close professional relationship, formulated plans for the creation of a family limited partnership.Â  Neither Everett nor Hastie informed Smith of these plans.Â  Although the Smithsâ€™ marital problems remained unresolved, Everett ended the marital counseling in the spring of 1992.Â  \r\nIn November 1992, Smith met briefly with Everett and Hastie on two separate occasions.Â  During these meetings, each of which lasted approximately thirty to forty minutes, Smith was given a brief overview of the partnership.Â  Hastie informed Smith the partnership was a tool by which she and Everett could reduce their estate taxes and protect their assets from creditors.Â  Smith was also led to believe that both she and Everett would have access to the assets in the partnership during their lifetimes.Â  \r\nAt no time during the meetings did Hastie advise Smith about the potential loss of her right to claim the assets in the partnership or the income from these assets in the event of a divorce.Â  In fact, Smith specifically asked Hastie on two occasions how she would be affected in case of a divorce and Hastie told her both times she would be just fine.Â  \r\nAs a result of these assurances from Hastie and representations made by Everett, Smith executed the documents necessary to form the family limited partnership.Â  The partnership was funded with the Smithsâ€™ property. Hastie advised both Smith and Everett to place significant portions of their jointly owned assets into the partnership.Â  At Hastieâ€™s direction, Smith also conveyed to the partnership numerous assets in her name alone as well as assets that she held jointly with Everett.Â  \r\nDuring the spring of 1994, Everett moved out of the marital bedroom and took residence in a guest bedroom in the marital home.Â  On July 30, 1997, Everett initiated an action in the Charleston County Family Court in which he requested to live separate and apart from Smith.Â  Smith initially did not obtain counsel in this action because of assertions and representations from Everett that he would be fair and equitable with her.Â  Also, notwithstanding the family court litigation, on August 12, 1997, Smith, following Hastieâ€™s advice, executed documents prepared by Hastie that amended the partnership.Â  \r\nIn early 1998, during a meeting with Everett and Hastie, Hastie informed Smith that he intended to file a petition to force her to relinquish her shares in the partnership because she and Everett were divorcing.Â  During that meeting, Hastie verbally threatened Smith to the point of tears and then attempted to negotiate a settlement between Smith and Everett.Â  It was only after this meeting that Smith began to suspect that Hastieâ€™s advice to enter into and contribute property to the family limited partnership had not been in her best economic interest.Â  \r\nSmith later retained counsel to represent her in the family court action and filed an amended answer, counterclaim, and third-party complaint dated February 5, 1999.Â  Her third-party complaint named as defendants the family limited partnership; Everett, individually and as officer of the family limited partnership; the Broughton Corporation, which was the managing general partner of the family limited partnership; and the Smithsâ€™ two children and Everettâ€™s daughter by a prior marriage, each of whom had an interest in the family limited partnership.Â  Smith alleged among other things:Â  (1) the family limited partnership and the Broughton Corporation and their respective holdings and assets were subject to equitable apportionment; and (2) the family limited partnership and its managing general partner â€œwere formed and structured in a deliberate effort by Everett . . . with the aid and assistance of his business and personal attorney . . . to fraudulently and wrongfully deprive [her] of her rightful claim to marital assets . . . and to give Everett . . . an unfair advantageâ€; and (3) she was misled about the consequences of her agreement to convey assets to the family limited partnership, particularly in the event of a divorce.Â  \r\nOn March 10, 1999, however, Smith and Everett, both of whom were represented by counsel, executed a marital settlement agreement in conjunction with the pending family court litigation.Â  In the agreement, Smith agreed to relinquish her interest in the family limited partnership and in the Broughton Corporation based on certain specific representations from Everett, including an assurance that her shares would be gifted to their three children.Â  The family court approved the settlement in a â€œFinal Decree of Separate Maintenance and Final Order Approving Agreement,â€ which was filed the same day.\r\nOn August 11, 2000, Smith filed and served the complaint in the present action, naming both Everett and Hastie as defendants.[1]Â  In her complaint, Smith asserted claims against Hastie for breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, civil conspiracy, and fraud.Â  \r\nOn July 13, 2001, Smithâ€™s affidavit was filed with the trial court and served on Hastieâ€™s attorney.Â  In August 2001, Hastie moved for summary judgment.Â  \r\nThe trial court heard the motion on May 3, 2002.Â  By order dated May 27, 2002, and filed May 28, 2002, the trial court granted summary judgment to Hastie and dismissed all Smithâ€™s claims with prejudice.Â  In dismissing the action, the trial court held as a matter of law:Â  (1) Smith failed to commence her lawsuit within the applicable limitations period; (2) Smithâ€™s malpractice claims failed for lack of evidence; and (3) Smithâ€™s claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Â  After the denial of her post-trial motions, Smith filed this appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Civil Conspiracy, Fraud, and Fraud in the Inducement\r\nAs to Smithâ€™s causes of action for civil conspiracy, fraud and fraud in the inducement, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s holding that these claims fail as a matter of law.\r\nâ€œA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons joining for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and causing special damage to the plaintiff.â€[2]Â  To recover on a claim for fraud in the inducement, the plaintiff must show the defendant made a false representation relating to a present or preexisting fact, the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff, and the plaintiff had a right to rely on the false representation.[3]Â  Similarly, the intent to deceive is an essential element of an action for fraud.[4]\r\nWe agree with the trial court that Smith failed to present evidence showing that Hastie was aware that she and Everett were experiencing marital problems when he set up the family limited partnership.Â  Absent such evidence, there would be no reason for Hastie to mislead her or otherwise knowingly fail to act in her best interest.\r\nIn her brief, Smith argues that her affidavit contradicts Hastieâ€™s claims that until at least 1997 he was unaware of any marital problems between her and Everett.Â  She also contends that the longstanding close relationship between Everett and Hastie is evidence of this assertion.Â  To support her position, Smith stated the following in her affidavit:Â  (1) she believed Hastie knew that she and Everett were having marital problems earlier than Hastie acknowledged; and (2) after the divorce settlement, Everett told her he and Hastie had planned to intimidate her.Â  We agree with Hastie that these statements do not create an issue of fact for the purpose of defeating summary judgment.Â  The first assertion was not based on Smithâ€™s personal knowledge, and the second contained hearsay.[5]Â  \r\nBecause we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to Smithâ€™s fraud and conspiracy claims on the ground that these causes of action failed for lack of sufficient evidence, we need not address whether they are also barred by the statute of limitations or collateral estoppel.[6]\r\nB. Negligence and Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nWe disagree, however, with the grant of summary judgment on Smithâ€™s claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.\r\nâ€œOne standing in a fiduciary relationship with another is subject to liability to the other for harm resulting from a breach of duty imposed by the relation.â€[7]Â  â€œIn South Carolina, attorneys are required to render services with the degree of skill, care, knowledge, and judgment usually possessed and exercised by members of the profession.â€[8]Â  â€œTo prevail in a legal malpractice claim, the plaintiff must satisfy the following four elements:Â  (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) breach of duty by the attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) proximate causation of [the] clientâ€™s damage by the breach.â€[9]\r\nSmith alleged Hastie was liable for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty in the following particulars:Â  (1) improperly undertaking joint representation of her and Everett; (2) failing to inform her of any potential conflict; (3) failing to recommend that she seek independent counsel; (4) failing to advise her about the consequences of the transfer of assets to the partnership in the event of a divorce between her and Everett; (5) improperly attempting to force her to relinquish her shares in the partnership; (6) improperly attempting to negotiate a settlement of the domestic dispute between her and Everett; and (7) acting solely on Everettâ€™s behalf.Â  \r\nAt the hearing on the summary judgment motion, Smith presented an affidavit from attorney H. Dewain Herring, a certified specialist in estate planning, probate, and trust law.[10]Â  In the affidavit, Herring stated that, even if Hastie had no initial knowledge of marital problems between Smith and her husband, he should have advised her of the ramifications of the family limited partnership in the event of a divorce and should have advised her to seek at least a second opinion because he had represented her husband substantially in the past.Â  In conjunction with this opinion, Herring also stated that Hastie â€œshould have probed further into existing conflicts between the spousesâ€ and suggested that this could have been done by an engagement letter asking the clients to identify any conflicts that exist at the outset of joint representation.Â  Herring was emphatic that the present case called for such a letter, noting this precaution was advisable in cases in which one spouse has most of the financial wealth, tends to be the dominant person in the planning process, or is the client of longer standing with the lawyer. \r\nHerring further stated the following:Â  (1) devices such as family limited partnerships could be used to â€œfreeze outâ€ unit holders and devalue assets because of the lack of marketability and closely held nature of the unit; and (2) there was no written documentation showing that Smith was informed of this possibility.Â  In addition, Herring opined that, based on his review of the case, Smithâ€™s participation in the family limited partnership caused her to lose control over the assets placed in the partnership while her estranged husband, because of his control of the Broughton Corporation, seized control over these assets.\r\nHerringâ€™s affidavit squarely calls into dispute the trial courtâ€™s reasoning that, because Hastie was unaware of any marital dispute between the Smiths, there was no problem with his undertaking to represent both of them in the family limited partnership.Â  To the contrary, Herringâ€™s opinion was that, even if the Smithsâ€™ marriage appeared harmonious, Hastie should have at least made inquiries to ascertain that they had no existing conflicts and kept both clients adequately informed.Â  Moreover, it appears from Herringâ€™s affidavit that the possibility of a freeze out in the event of a divorce was a recognized risk of a family limited partnership that Hastie should have, in response to Smithâ€™s inquiries, disclosed to her.Â  We therefore hold Smith presented adequate evidence on the merits of her claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.\r\nWe further disagree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that Smith had knowledge of an injury when she relinquished her assets to the partnership in 1992.Â  The injury to which Herring refers in his affidavit, namely, the â€œfreezing outâ€ of a unit holder, did not occur until 1998, when Hastie advised Smith of his intent to file a petition to force her to relinquish her shares in the partnership.Â  Until then, based on assurances from Hastie and Everett, Smith had understood that she would have access to the partnership assets during her lifetime regardless of how they were titled.[11]Â  Because Smith filed her action against Hastie in 2000, we hold her action was timely filed.\r\nFinally, we hold the trial court incorrectly determined that Smithâ€™s claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty were barred by collateral\r\nestoppel.&nbsp; \r\n Irby v. Richardson,[12] an attorney malpractice case cited by the trial court in support of the grant of summary judgment, is distinguishable from the present case.Â  In Irby, the issues that the plaintiff was deemed collaterally estopped to relitigate were the validity of his consent to his former wifeâ€™s having custody of their children and his former wifeâ€™s fitness as a custodial parent.[13]Â  After approval of the custody agreement but before he sued his attorney for malpractice, Irby had brought several proceedings in the family court during which he actually litigated the issues that he attempted to raise in the malpractice action.[14]Â  In contrast, the precise issues of whether Hastie was negligent or breached a fiduciary duty in advising Smith regarding the family limited partnership have never been actually litigated in any judicial forum until the present lawsuit.[15]\r\nFurthermore, contrary to the statement in the appealed order that â€œthe malpractice claims rest on alleged facts which would be indicia of fraud supporting Plaintiffâ€™s case to reclaim her gifts to her children,â€ Herringâ€™s affidavit supports a finding that, even in the absence of any unethical conduct, Hastie failed to fulfill his fiduciary responsibilities to Smith.Â  Agency principles would ordinarily have prevented Smith from raising during the family court proceedings the issues of Hastieâ€™s exercise of due care, leaving her the sole recourse of a lawsuit for legal malpractice.[16]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the grant of summary judgment on Smithâ€™s causes of action for civil conspiracy and fraud.Â  We reverse the dismissal of Smithâ€™s causes of action for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty and remand these claims for a trial on the merits.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Everett was dismissed from the lawsuit before the issuance of the order now on appeal.Â  Smith does not appeal this adjudication.Â  \r\n[2]Â  LaMotte v.

King, 312 S.C. 331, 334 n.1, 440 S.E.2d 379, 381 n.1 (Ct. App. 1993), nevertheless considered Herringâ€™s statements.Â  Given the recognition that the trial court has the discretion to reject an untimely affidavit in a summary judgment motion, it follows that acceptance of a late affidavit would also be within its discretion.Â  Although Hastie argues in his brief that parties should not be permitted to â€œblindside the court and opposing counsel with late affidavits,â€ he does not argue that the affidavit at issue prejudiced him.Â  We further note that Hastie submitted affidavits from two lawyers attesting to the propriety of his services to the Smith family.

Bartell, 504 N.Y.S. 918, 920 (N.Y.A.D. 1986) (finding no abuse of discretion in the consideration of untimely affidavits and exhibits in a summary judgment motion when there was no showing of prejudice to the opposing party), cited in Black v.

(â€œCarrierâ€), carrier for Employer, approached Spivey about settling his workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  On June 3, 1999, the parties held a conference before a single commissioner that resulted in the approval of a clincher settlement agreement (â€œclincherâ€) for $32,201.Â  Counsel did not represent Spivey when he consented to the clincher agreement.Â  The full commission approved the clincher on June 9, 1999.Â Â  \r\nSpivey continued to have medical problems.Â  Upon learning of the clincher, Spiveyâ€™s family sought legal representation.Â  On May 8, 2000, Spiveyâ€™s mother petitioned to be appointed as Spiveyâ€™s Guardian ad Litem, and initiated this action by filing a Form 50 seeking relief from and/or seeking to set aside the clincher.Â  The full commission dismissed the Form 50 in a consent order signed by the parties stating the commission lacked jurisdiction to review the claim.Â  \r\nOn January 19, 2001, Spivey filed an action in the circuit court arguing the clincher should be set aside.Â  The circuit court dismissed the action on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to review a clincher.Â  Spivey filed a motion to reconsider.Â  At the hearing on Spiveyâ€™s motion, the circuit court stated itÂ  â€œsimply had no jurisdiction to review the agreement,â€ but â€œthereâ€™s nothing that divests the [full commission] from reviewing the clincher based on any allegations of fraud or incapacity.â€Â  The judge added, â€œI do not believe that I have the ability or the jurisdiction to remand this.Â  I donâ€™t think that it is necessary.Â  I think that you just need to rebring your action.â€Â  \r\nIn response to the circuit courtâ€™s recommendation, Spivey once again filed a Form 50 with the full commission.Â  In addition, Spivey appealed the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of his action to this court. Â Spivey next filed a motion to stay the appeal pending the full commissionâ€™s decision concerning its jurisdiction to review the clincher.Â  This court granted the stay. \r\nOn November 12, 2003, the full commission granted Spivey a hearing to review the clincher solely on the issue of fraud and remanded the matter to the single commissioner for the hearing.Â  Employer and Carrier filed a motion to reconsider, and the full commission denied the motion.Â  Employer and Carrier then filed a notice of appeal to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court dismissed the appeal stating â€œany issue about jurisdiction under the full commission has to be taken up with the full commission and/or the Court of Appeals.â€Â  \r\nThereafter, Employer and Carrier filed a notice of appeal to this court, a motion to consolidate their appeal with Spiveyâ€™s previously filed appeal, and a motion to lift the stay on Spiveyâ€™s appeal.Â  Spivey filed a motion to dismiss Employer and Carrierâ€™s appeal and a return to both the motion to consolidate and the motion to lift the stay.Â  This court denied the motion to dismiss, granted the motion to lift the stay, and consolidated the appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Spiveyâ€™s Appeal\r\nSpivey argues the circuit court erred in granting Employer and Carrierâ€™s motion to dismiss his original cause of action for lack of jurisdiction.Â  He contends the circuit court has jurisdiction to grant relief from unfair clinchers.Â  We disagree.\r\nA clincher is a final release agreement that â€œrelieves the employer and its representative from any further responsibility for payment of compensation or medical expenses.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-801(E) (1990).Â  When the claimant signs the clincher and it is approved, the claimant can no longer ask for additional payments.Â  Id.Â  If an attorney does not represent the claimant, the full commission must approve the agreement.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-390 (Supp. 2004); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-803(B)(1)(d) (1990).Â  The full commission will not approve a clincher that is not fairly made.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-803(C).Â  Our supreme court has held the full commission has the power to approve a clincher and make it final and binding and not subject to review by the courts under any conditions.Â  Atkins v. Charleston Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock, 206 S.C. 63, 68, 33 S.E.2d 46, 48 (1945); see also Singleton v. Young Lumber Company, 236 S.C. 454, 114 S.E.2d 837 (1960) (holding settlement agreements, when approved by the full commission, are binding on the parties as an unappealed order, decision, or award of the full commission, or an award of the full commission affirmed on appeal).\r\nHere, Spivey entered into a clincher with Employer and Carrier.Â  Both a single commissioner and the full commission approved the clincher.Â  Through the full commissionâ€™s approval of the agreement, the statutory clincher scheme precluded appellate review.Â  The agreement specifically provides â€œupon such approval this Agreement and Release shall not be subject to review or amendment by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission or the Courts of this State.â€Â  The full commission, therefore, validly approved the clincher and intended the clincher to be final and binding.Â  Thus, the circuit court correctly held that it was without jurisdiction to review the clincher.Â  \r\nSpivey alleges Rule 60 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides the circuit court with the jurisdiction to reopen the clincher agreement.Â  Rule 60 permits a party to collaterally attack a final judgment by moving to set aside the judgment on various grounds, including fraud and mistake.Â  Section 42-17-70 of the South Carolina Code (2004) does use the term â€œjudgmentâ€ to refer to approved settlement agreements (clinchers).Â  The statute, however, refers to the settlement agreement as a â€œjudgmentâ€ solely for enforcement purposes.Â  The statute does not provide a settlement agreement constitutes a judgment for purposes of review.Â  See Wall v. C.Y. Thomason Co., 232 S.C. 153, 156, 101 S.E.2d 286, 288 (1957) (holding â€œthe language [Section 72-357 (now Â§42-17-70)] is mandatory; and the rendition of judgment in such case is ministerial rather than judicial for the award is subject to review only by the appeal process to which we have referredâ€)(emphasis added).\r\nNor does the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) provide authority for judicial review of clinchers.Â  Under the APA, circuit courts may review final decisions of the full commission to determine if the decision was affected by an error of law in view of the evidence on the whole record.Â  See Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, however, does not require the full commission to create a formal record of its approval of a clincher agreement.Â  Therefore, the full commissionâ€™s approval of a clincher does not constitute a final decision that the circuit court can meaningfully review under the APA.Â  \r\nSpivey next contends the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-53-10 et seq, authorizes judicial review of clinchers.Â  We agree with the circuit court judge that because the court was without jurisdiction to reopen Spiveyâ€™s claim before the commission, he had no cognizable claim under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court correctly dismissed Spiveyâ€™s action for lack of jurisdiction.\r\nII.Â  Employer and Carrierâ€™s Appeal\r\nEmployer and Carrier raise several issues concerning the full commissionâ€™s jurisdiction to review the clincher.Â  They argue the clincher is not subject to review and, in addition, res judicata bars review.Â  They also note the parties agreed by a consent order that the full commission lacked jurisdiction.\r\nâ€œThe function of appellate courts is not to give opinions on merely abstract or theoretical matters, but only to decide actual controversies injuriously affecting the rights of some party to the litigation.â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 552, 590 S.E.2d 338, 349 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In general, this court may only consider cases when a justiciable controversy exists.Â  See Lennon v. S.C. Coastal Council, 330 S.C. 414, 415, 498 S.E.2d 906, 906 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding â€œa threshold inquiry for any court is a determination of justiciabilityâ€).Â  â€œA justiciable controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.â€Â  Pee Dee Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983); see also \r\nKiawah Property Owners Group v. The Public Service Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 357 S.C. 232, 593 S.E.2d 148 (2004); Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996). Â Accordingly, issues that are not ripe are not proper subjects of review.Â  \r\nHere, although the full commission has granted a hearing to review the clincher on the issue of fraud, it has not yet held the hearing.Â  The full commission has neither articulated the basis by which it asserts its jurisdictional authority, nor has it decided whether the clincher was procured by fraud. Â The rights of the parties have not been finally adjudicated, and any decision by this court would be premature.Â  Therefore, pending the outcome of the hearing before the full commission, we find this issue not ripe for our review.[1]Â  \r\nLikewise, we do not consider Employer and Carrierâ€™s argument that Spivey failed to prove his grounds for relief because the full commission has not held the hearing to review the clincher.Â  This issue, therefore, is not ripe for appeal.Â  See Pee Dee Elec. Coop., Inc., 279 S.C. at 66, 301 S.E.2d at 762. \r\nIn their reply brief, Employer and Carrier argue the full commission erred in appointing Spiveyâ€™s mother as his Guardian ad Litem without first holding a hearing on the issue.Â  Employer and Carrier also argue the full commission erred in granting Spivey a hearing to review the clincher without first holding a hearing.Â  We do not consider these issues because Employer and Carrier did not raise these issues in their initial brief.Â  See Lister v. NationsBank of Delaware, N.A.,&nbsp; 329 S.C. 133, 153, 494 S.E.2d 449, 460&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (holding an appellant may not use the reply brief to argue issues not argued in the appellantâ€™s initial brief).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of Spiveyâ€™s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.Â  We dismiss all issues concerning the full commissionâ€™s jurisdiction, as these issues are not ripe for appeal.Â  Accordingly, this case isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART. \r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We express no opinion on whether the full commission has jurisdiction to reopen a clincher agreement based on fraud.Â  However, we would note other South Carolina tribunals have the inherent power to reopen agreements and judgments procured by fraud.Â  See Raby Const., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 18, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004) (citing Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, 66 S.E.2d 609 (1951); see also Greenfield v. Greenfield, 245 S.C. 604, 141 S.E.2d 920 (1965) (holding â€œthe inherent powers of a court, which are essential to its existence and protection and to the due administration of justice within the scope of the jurisdiction expressly conferred, do not depend upon express constitutional or legislative grantâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
