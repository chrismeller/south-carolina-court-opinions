Lowther,\r\nSr. against a personal representative of the estate, E. LeGrand Lowther.1 They\r\nallege LeGrand breached a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries when he did not\r\ndisclose to them that he was negotiating with third parties to sell properties\r\nbelonging to the estate while he was simultaneously negotiating with the\r\nbeneficiaries to purchase from them those same properties. The probate court\r\nfound LeGrand breached his fiduciary duty and awarded the beneficiaries $69,051\r\nin damages. On appeal, the circuit court agreed but modified the judgment to\r\n$289,924. We affirm the circuit court.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nMr. Lowther died in 2004 and was survived by his eight children. At the time of\r\nhis death, Mr. Lowther owned (1) a 40.81 acre parcel of real property and (2) an\r\nundivided one-fourth interest in a 226.35 acre parcel of real property located in the\r\nWellington Plantation area of Jasper County.2 LeGrand owned an undivided one-\r\nhalf interest in the Wellington tract, and his brother Mitchell owned an undivided\r\none-fourth interest in the property. The probate court appointed LeGrand and\r\nMark personal representatives of the estate.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowther's will, which excluded LeGrand at LeGrand's own request, devised\r\nthe 40-acre parcel and his undivided one-fourth interest in the Wellington tract to\r\nhis other seven children in equal shares. Additionally, the will devised a one-half\r\ninterest in a vacant subdivision located in Beaufort County known as Echo Tango\r\nthat consisted of six lots, two of which had previously sold for $110,000 and\r\n$700,000, respectively. Although the Echo Tango property was titled solely in\r\nLeGrand's name, LeGrand agreed to share profits generated from Echo Tango with\r\nMr. Lowther while he was still living. Even though LeGrand and Mr. Lowther had\r\npreviously discussed jointly owning the Echo Tango property, LeGrand testified no\r\nagreement was finalized before Mr. Lowther's death.\r\n\r\n\r\n1There are seven beneficiaries of the estate. Three beneficiaries—Effie Sandra\r\nTurpin, C.E. Lowther, Jr., and Mitchell Saxon Lowther—brought suit against the\r\npersonal representatives, LeGrand and Mark Allen Lowther, who are also children\r\nof Mr. Lowther. The probate court dismissed Mark as a defendant in its final\r\norder.\r\n2 We refer to these properties as the \"40-acre parcel\" and the \"Wellington tract,\"\r\nrespectively.\r\n\nThe beneficiaries of the estate wanted to sell the land they inherited because some\r\nwere in financial need. In early 2005, International Society of Investors, LLC\r\n(\"ISI\") contacted LeGrand about purchasing the Wellington tract. LeGrand\r\nshowed the property to two of ISI's principals, Michael Jones and Monte Perry.\r\nDuring negotiations with ISI, LeGrand told Jones that if ISI wanted to purchase the\r\nWellington tract, the company would also have to buy the 40-acre parcel as a\r\n\"package deal.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 2005, LeGrand discussed with the beneficiaries his plan to\r\npurchase their interests in the 40-acre parcel and the Wellington tract. LeGrand\r\nseparately discussed with Mitchell the possibility of purchasing his one-fourth\r\ninterest in the Wellington tract. LeGrand told the beneficiaries he would not buy\r\ntheir interests unless each decided to sell. Following these discussions, LeGrand\r\nmade an initial offer of $275,000 to each beneficiary, but not all accepted.\r\nLeGrand testified that by August, all the beneficiaries had agreed on a price, so he\r\nasked his attorney to begin preparing individual contracts for the purchase of their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nIn October 2005, LeGrand prepared and delivered to each beneficiary a proposed\r\ncontract for the purchase of their interests in the 40-acre parcel and the Wellington\r\ntract. All the contracts, excluding Mitchell's contract, contained a proposed\r\npurchase price of $325,000. The contracts also provided that each beneficiary\r\nmust quitclaim to LeGrand any right they may have in the Echo Tango lots. Each\r\nbeneficiary signed his or her respective contract and returned it to LeGrand in\r\nOctober. LeGrand delivered to Mitchell a similar contract to purchase his one-\r\nseventh interest in the 40-acre parcel and one-fourth interest in the Wellington\r\ntract. Mitchell's contract, however, did not provide a purchase price. Mitchell\r\nfilled in a purchase of $1,025,000, signed the contract, and returned it to LeGrand\r\nin October.\r\n\r\nAlso in October, ISI sent LeGrand two proposed contracts for the purchase of the\r\n40-acre parcel and the Wellington tract. The contracts were dated October 12,\r\n2005, but LeGrand claims he did not receive them until October 18 or 19, 2005.\r\nISI offered to buy the 40-acre parcel for $810,000. The contract for the Wellington\r\ntract, however, did not provide a purchase price. LeGrand filled in a purchase\r\nprice of $5,450,000 for the Wellington tract. The contracts also identified the\r\nseller as \"LeGrand Lowther, Mitchell Lowther, et al.,\" but LeGrand crossed out\r\n\"Mitchell Lowther, et al.,\" making LeGrand the only named seller on the contracts.\r\nHe signed both contracts on October 24, 2005 and returned them to ISI.\r\n\nThree beneficiaries testified that when they signed their contracts in mid-October,\r\nthey were unaware of LeGrand's efforts to sell the 40-acre parcel and the\r\nWellington tract to ISI. Two of the beneficiaries claimed they asked LeGrand\r\nseveral times if he had \"a sale\" or \"a contract\" for the property, to which LeGrand\r\nresponded, \"I don't but I think I can sell it, people [are] interested in it, I believe I\r\ncan sell it.\" LeGrand testified he did not disclose the negotiations and contracts\r\nwith ISI to the beneficiaries because he \"didn't have a sale; [he] had an agreement.\"\r\nMoreover, he \"already had an agreement with [the beneficiaries] to buy everything\r\nfrom them, individually\" so he contended it was none of their business.\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2005, LeGrand and Mark, as personal representatives, executed a\r\ndeed of distribution releasing the 40-acre parcel and the Wellington tract to the\r\nbeneficiaries. The same day, each beneficiary executed a deed conveying the 40-\r\nacre parcel to LeGrand. Subsequently, LeGrand closed on a loan—borrowing\r\n$585,000 and securing the loan with a mortgage on the 40-acre parcel—and paid\r\neach beneficiary $73,000 from the loan proceeds, for a total purchase price of\r\n$511,000.3 The beneficiaries were aware LeGrand needed to borrow money to pay\r\nthe purchase price. At the closing, LeGrand denied the existence of a potential\r\nbuyer for the property and did not disclose that he had signed and sent ISI a\r\nproposed contract for the 40-acre parcel.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 2005, the beneficiaries executed deeds conveying their interests\r\nin the Wellington tract to LeGrand. At the closing, LeGrand denied the existence\r\nof a potential buyer for the property and did not disclose that he had received both\r\ncontracts back from ISI in mid-December, both having been executed by ISI on\r\nNovember 21. Three beneficiaries testified they relied on LeGrand's denials at the\r\nclosings when they sold their interests.\r\n\r\nTo finance the purchase of the Wellington tract, LeGrand executed seven\r\npromissory notes to the beneficiaries—six notes for $252,000 and one to Mitchell\r\nfor $952,000—for a total purchase price of $2,464,000. All notes were payable in\r\nfull, without interest, on December 31, 2006. The sum of the notes was secured by\r\na mortgage on the Wellington tract and, in the event of default, the beneficiaries\r\nwere entitled to a reconveyance of their interests in the Wellington tract and a\r\nshare of the net proceeds from the sale of any Echo Tango lots.\r\n\r\n3Contrary to the written contracts, the parties agreed to a purchase price of\r\n$511,000 for the 40-acre parcel, with each beneficiary receiving $73,000 in cash at\r\nclosing.\r\n\nOn February 17, 2006, LeGrand sold the 40-acre parcel to Amberwinds, LLC for\r\n$810,000. The probate court found Amberwinds was the assignee of the purchase\r\ncontract from ISI, and the circuit court found Amberwinds was \"virtually the same\r\nentity\" as ISI and was owned by the same two men with whom LeGrand\r\nnegotiated—Jones and Perry. In March 2006, the beneficiaries learned of the sale\r\nto Amberwinds. Two of the beneficiaries testified they would not have sold their\r\ninterests had they known about the contracts between LeGrand and ISI.\r\n\r\nISI never closed under its contract for the purchase of the Wellington tract.\r\nLeGrand could not find another buyer before the promissory notes to the\r\nbeneficiaries became due on December 31, 2006. As a result, LeGrand defaulted\r\non the notes and was forced to reconvey the beneficiaries' interests in the\r\nWellington tract and distribute to them $138,000 in profits from the sale of two\r\nEcho Tango lots—one in 2006 and one in 2008.\r\n\r\nThree beneficiaries of the estate brought suit, both individually and \"as a class of\r\nbeneficiaries,\" against LeGrand for breach of fiduciary duty. The probate court\r\nfound LeGrand breached his fiduciary duty and awarded $69,051 in damages to all\r\nthe beneficiaries of the estate. In arriving at this award, the court stated it would\r\nnot measure damages by the difference between what LeGrand paid the\r\nbeneficiaries for the 40-acre parcel—$511,000—and the amount Amberwinds paid\r\nfor it—$810,000. Instead, the court began with the amount LeGrand cleared from\r\nthe sale to Amberwinds after he made closing and title clearance payments—\r\n$207,051.4 The court then subtracted from this amount the distributions LeGrand\r\nsubsequently paid to the beneficiaries from the sale of the two Echo Tango lots—\r\n$138,000. These reductions left a final award of $69,051.\r\n\r\nBoth LeGrand and the beneficiaries appealed to the circuit court. The beneficiaries\r\nargued the probate court erred because it measured damages by what LeGrand\r\ncleared from the sale to Amberwinds, and it deducted $138,000 in Echo Tango\r\nproceeds from the award. The circuit court agreed and increased the award to\r\n$289,924 because (1) the measure of damages should have been what the\r\n\r\n4At the Amberwinds closing, LeGrand received $810,000 but paid $602,955,\r\nwhich included: (1) $593,872 to pay off the mortgage on the 40-acre parcel; (2)\r\n$6,576 to pay a judgment against Clark Lowther; (3) $1,257 to pay a creditor's\r\nclaim against the estate; and (4) $1,250 in attorney's fees. After LeGrand was\r\ncredited $6.24 for paying the prorated real estate tax in advance, LeGrand cleared\r\n$207,051 from the sale.\r\n\nbeneficiaries would have earned but for LeGrand's actions—$299,000—and (2) the\r\nEcho Tango distributions should not have been considered in calculating the award\r\nbecause Mr. Lowther equitably owned a fifty-percent interest in Echo Tango,\r\nwhich entitled the beneficiaries to any proceeds after his death. However, the\r\ncircuit court affirmed the probate court's subtraction of $9,076 for payments made\r\nat the closing.5 In his cross-appeal, LeGrand argued the probate court erred in\r\nfinding he breached a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries. The circuit court\r\ndisagreed and affirmed the probate court's ruling.\r\n\r\n      II.    Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\nLeGrand contends the circuit court erred in affirming the probate court's holding\r\nthat he breached a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries. LeGrand makes three\r\narguments as to why he should not be liable to the beneficiaries: (1) he had no\r\nfiduciary duty to them because the transactions took place outside the estate\r\nadministration process; (2) he did not breach a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries;\r\nand (3) any duty he breached did not proximately cause the beneficiaries' damages.\r\n\r\nTo establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the plaintiff must prove (1) the\r\nexistence of a fiduciary duty, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) damages\r\nproximately resulting from the wrongful conduct of the defendant. RFT Mgmt. Co.\r\nv. Tinsley & Adams L.L.P., 399 S.C. 322, 335-36, 732 S.E.2d 166, 173 (2012).\r\nThe existence of a fiduciary duty is a question of law for the court. See Vortex\r\nSports & Entm't, Inc. v. Ware, 378 S.C. 197, 207, 662 S.E.2d 444, 450 (Ct. App.\r\n2008) (citing Clearwater Trust v. Bunting, 367 S.C. 340, 346, 626 S.E.2d 334, 337\r\n(2006)). Pursuant to the probate code, a personal representative owes a fiduciary\r\nduty to all beneficiaries of the estate. S.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-703(a) (2009)\r\n(stating \"[a] personal representative is a fiduciary\" and must \"use the authority\r\nconferred upon him . . . for the best interests of successors to the estate\"); see also\r\nEx parte Wheeler v. Estate of Green, 381 S.C. 548, 555, 673 S.E.2d 836, 840 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009) (\"A personal representative is a fiduciary under this state's probate\r\ncode.\"); Witherspoon v. Stogner, 182 S.C. 413, 415, 189 S.E. 758, 759 (1937)\r\n(\"That a fiduciary relationship exists between each heir or beneficiary of an estate\r\n\r\n5Except for the $593,872 mortgage payment, the court subtracted the payments\r\nand the credit listed in the above footnote from the award—$9,076 in total. The\r\ncourt did not consider the mortgage payment when determining the award because\r\n(1) LeGrand voluntarily mortgaged the 40-acre parcel instead of purchasing with\r\ncash, and (2) the $585,000 mortgage loan exceeded the purchase price by $74,000,\r\nand the beneficiaries received none of the excess funds.\r\n\nand the administratrix thereof is fundamental.\"). Subsection 62-3-703(a) states a\r\npersonal representative has the \"duty to settle and distribute the estate . . . as\r\nexpeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate\"\r\nand the \"successors to the estate.\" If the personal representative improperly\r\nexercises his power in connection with the estate, he is \"liable to interested persons\r\nfor damage or loss resulting from breach of his fiduciary duty.\" S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n62-3-712 (2009).\r\n\r\n             A.     Acting in Capacity as Fiduciary\r\n\r\nLeGrand first contends the fiduciary duty he had to the beneficiaries did not apply\r\nwhen he purchased their interests because he distributed the properties to them in\r\nhis fiduciary capacity, and then purchased the individually-owned properties from\r\nthem in a personal capacity. Thus, LeGrand argues the transactions occurred\r\noutside of the administration of the estate and thus were not subject to a fiduciary\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nLeGrand's argument focuses on whether he had a fiduciary duty to the\r\nbeneficiaries when he closed his purchase of the 40-acre parcel from them in\r\nDecember 2005. We believe LeGrand defines the issue too narrowly. LeGrand\r\nconcedes he had a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries when he was negotiating to\r\npurchase their interests in the summer of 2005 and when the beneficiaries signed\r\ntheir contracts to sell their interests in October 2005. This duty required him to\r\ndisclose information affecting the value of the beneficiaries' interests in the estate\r\nbefore he could negotiate to purchase those interests. See Pitts v. Jackson Nat'l\r\nLife Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 335, 574 S.E.2d 502, 510 (Ct. App. 2002) (noting a\r\nduty to disclose arises from a preexisting, definite fiduciary relationship between\r\nthe parties); Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 251, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App.\r\n2004) (stating \"[p]arties in a fiduciary relationship must fully disclose to each other\r\nall known information that is significant and material, and when this duty to\r\ndisclose is triggered, silence may constitute\" a breach of that duty (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\nLeGrand and ISI began negotiating the sale of the 40-acre parcel and the\r\nWellington tract in early 2005. Through these negotiations, LeGrand acquired\r\ninformation concerning the value of the properties that he could not have known\r\nexcept by virtue of his position as personal representative. On the other hand, the\r\nbeneficiaries could not have learned this information unless LeGrand disclosed it\r\nto them. The beneficiaries' ability to accurately assess the value of the properties,\r\nand thus determine the price they were willing to accept, depended on the\r\n\ninformation available to them at that time. Nevertheless, LeGrand began\r\nnegotiations with the beneficiaries in the summer of 2005, and they agreed on a\r\npurchase price and signed the contracts to sell their interests to LeGrand in October\r\n2005. Because his negotiations and contracts with ISI affected the value of the\r\nbeneficiaries' interests, LeGrand's fiduciary duty required him to disclose this\r\ninformation to them when he negotiated to purchase their interests and when the\r\nbeneficiaries signed the contracts to sell their interests to him.\r\n\r\n             B.    Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\nLeGrand also argues that even if he had a fiduciary duty at the relevant time, he did\r\nnot breach this duty because (1) there was no contract with ISI when the\r\nbeneficiaries signed their contracts and when LeGrand closed on his purchase of\r\nthe 40-acre parcel, (2) ISI walked away from the contracts, and Amberwinds—who\r\nhe argues is not an assignee or the same entity as ISI—purchased the 40-acre\r\nparcel, and (3) he did not profit from the transaction with Amberwinds. These\r\nthree arguments challenge the factual findings of the circuit court. We reject these\r\narguments and affirm because evidence in the record supports these findings and\r\nthe finding that LeGrand breached his fiduciary duty of disclosure. See Jordan v.\r\nHolt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005) (stating the trial court's\r\nfindings in a breach of fiduciary duty action will be upheld unless they are\r\n\"without evidentiary support\").\r\n\r\n             C.    Proximate Cause\r\n\r\nLeGrand argues any breach of his fiduciary duty did not proximately cause the\r\nbeneficiaries' damages. We find, however, there is evidence to support the circuit\r\ncourt's finding of proximate cause. See Jordan, 362 S.C. at 205, 608 S.E.2d at 131.\r\nThree of the beneficiaries testified they relied on LeGrand's denial of existing\r\ncontracts when they decided to sell their interests, and two testified they would not\r\nhave gone through with the sale had they known about the contracts.\r\n\r\nLeGrand also contends the beneficiaries, with full knowledge of the sale to\r\nAmberwinds in March 2006, ratified the transaction by electing to receive\r\nproceeds from Echo Tango sales under the terms of the notes, instead of rescinding\r\nthe transaction and suing for damages. This issue, however, is not preserved for\r\nour review because LeGrand never made this argument to the probate court. See\r\nUlmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 860 (2006) (\"In reviewing an\r\nappeal from the probate court, the circuit court must apply the same rules of law as\r\nan appellate court would apply.\"); Whaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 482,\r\n\n609 S.E.2d 286, 299 (2005) (finding issue not preserved because it was not raised\r\nto and ruled upon by the trial court).\r\n\r\n      III.   Calculation of Damages\r\n\r\nLeGrand argues the circuit court erred in modifying the probate court's award of\r\ndamages. First, he contends the probate court correctly based damages on the\r\namount LeGrand cleared from the sale to Amberwinds, instead of the difference\r\nbetween what LeGrand paid the beneficiaries for the 40-acre parcel—$511,000—\r\nand the amount Amberwinds paid for it—$810,000. We disagree. Generally, the\r\nmeasure of damages in a tort case is \"the amount needed to compensate the\r\nplaintiff for the losses proximately caused by the defendant's wrong so that the\r\nplaintiff will be in the same position he would have been in if there had been no\r\nwrongful injury.\" Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 312, 594\r\nS.E.2d 867, 874 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378,\r\n529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (\"The goal [of compensatory damages] is to restore the\r\ninjured party . . . to the same position he or she was in before the wrongful injury\r\noccurred.\"); Haselden v. Davis, 353 S.C. 481, 486, 579 S.E.2d 293, 296 (2003)\r\n(Burnett, J., dissenting) (explaining the \"central tenet of compensatory damages\" is\r\n\"to make an injured person whole by placing him in the position enjoyed prior to\r\nthe injury\"). Thus, the correct measure of damages in this case is the amount that\r\nwill compensate the beneficiaries for the loss proximately caused by LeGrand's\r\nfailure to disclose. See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-712 (2009) (stating damages for a\r\npersonal representative's breach of fiduciary duty are calculated pursuant to\r\nsubsection 62-7-1002(a) of the South Carolina Code (2009), which provides\r\nrecovery for (1) the amount needed to restore the asset's value to what it would\r\nhave been but for the breach, or (2) \"the profit the [fiduciary] made by reason of\r\nthe breach,\" whichever is greater); Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 100 (2012)\r\n(stating one of the objectives in awarding damages for breach of fiduciary duty is\r\nto make the beneficiaries whole by restoring what they would have had if the\r\nbreach had not occurred). Here, the evidence supports the circuit court's finding\r\nthat LeGrand purchased the 40-acre parcel from the beneficiaries for $511,000\r\nwhen he knew its value was $810,000. Thus, we affirm the circuit court because\r\nbut for LeGrand's breach, the beneficiaries would have earned an additional\r\n$299,000.\r\n\r\nSecond, LeGrand argues the probate court correctly subtracted from the damages\r\naward $138,000 in Echo Tango proceeds previously paid to the beneficiaries\r\nbecause the payments were made pursuant to the overall deal negotiated between\r\nLeGrand and the beneficiaries. The circuit court found the Echo Tango proceeds\r\n\nshould not be considered in calculating the award because Mr. Lowther owned an\r\nequitable one-half interest in Echo Tango prior to his death, which entitled the\r\nbeneficiaries to any proceeds after his death. LeGrand argues, however, Mr.\r\nLowther held no interest in Echo Tango upon his death because it was titled solely\r\nin LeGrand's name and they never reached an agreement regarding joint ownership\r\nof the property. Therefore, LeGrand claims the beneficiaries were not entitled to\r\nthe profits except under the terms of the notes, and the circuit court erroneously\r\noverruled the probate court's determination of damages.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence in the record, however, to support the circuit court's finding that\r\nEcho Tango was part of Mr. Lowther's estate. First, the provision in the\r\nbeneficiaries' contracts that they must quitclaim their rights in Echo Tango\r\nsupports the contention that the beneficiaries were entitled to an equitable interest\r\nin Echo Tango; otherwise, the provision would be useless. When asked in a\r\ndeposition why the contracts contained this provision, LeGrand responded, \"I was\r\nbuying them out of Echo Tango . . . . There never was any question that they were\r\ngoing to get fifty percent of the proceeds out of Echo Tango.\" When asked why he\r\nthought this, LeGrand admitted the beneficiaries were entitled to the proceeds\r\nbefore he defaulted on the notes, and stated, \"I was going to give it to them. I felt\r\nlike I owed it to them.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, in a pretrial hearing, LeGrand testified that \"while the title to Echo Tango\r\nwas in [his] name, it's undisputed that [he] and [his] dad owned it together 50/50.\"\r\nThis is also consistent with a 2002 agreement signed by LeGrand, stating, in\r\nrelevant part:\r\n\r\n             This is to acknowledge that the following individuals are\r\n             the equitable and true owners of the below-described\r\n             interest in Echo Tango property located in the\r\n             Chechessee Community in Beaufort County.\r\n             Acknowledging this ownership interest, title, however,\r\n             shall be in the name of E. LeGrand Lowther for business\r\n             purposes.\r\n\r\n             E. LeGrand Lowther           50% ownership\r\n             C.E. Lowther                 50% ownership\r\n\n             All net proceeds from any sales shall be divided\r\n             according to the above interests.6\r\n\r\nThird, LeGrand's counsel admitted at trial there was \"some legitimacy to the\r\n[beneficiaries'] contention\" that they had a one-half interest in Echo Tango because\r\nLeGrand \"had reached this agreement with his father before he passed.\" And later\r\nat trial, when asked what would have happened to Echo Tango proceeds had none\r\nof the transactions taken place, LeGrand answered as follows:\r\n\r\n             A. I would've given them 50 percent of the proceeds out\r\n                of the sale of it.\r\n\r\n             Q. Why would you have done that?\r\n\r\n             A. Because it was my dad's wishes.\r\n\r\n             Q. Would you characterize [it] as an understanding and\r\n             agreement that you had with your father?\r\n\r\n             A. Agreement, understanding. That's what he wanted . . .\r\n             .\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Lowther's will devised a fifty-percent interest in Echo Tango to the\r\nbeneficiaries, which shows he believed he owned an interest in the property.\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence discussed above, we affirm the circuit court's award of\r\ndamages and agree the probate court erred in reducing the award by $138,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 LeGrand contends evidence from the deposition, pretrial hearing, and agreement\r\nis not a legitimate part of the record, and the circuit court erred in relying on it.\r\nHowever, LeGrand never raised this issue to the circuit court, even though the\r\nparties extensively discussed the evidence during pretrial hearings. Accordingly,\r\nwe find the issue is not preserved for this court's review. See Ulmer, 369 S.C. at\r\n490, 632 S.E.2d at 860 (\"In reviewing an appeal from the probate court, the circuit\r\ncourt must apply the same rules of law as an appellate court would apply.\"); Talley\r\nv.

Tuition Grants Comm., 289 S.C. 483, 487, 347 S.E.2d 99, 101\r\n(1986) (stating issues may not be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\n\nbecause the beneficiaries were entitled to a fifty-percent equitable interest in Echo\r\nTango.7\r\n\r\n      IV.    Award of Damages\r\n\r\nFinally, LeGrand claims the circuit court erred in affirming the probate court's\r\naward of damages in favor of all the beneficiaries, when only three were parties in\r\nthis case. However, when the probate court granted judgment in favor of all seven\r\nbeneficiaries, LeGrand never raised this issue to the probate court through a Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP, motion. Therefore, this argument is not preserved. See In re\r\nTimmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding\r\nwhen an order grants certain relief not previously contemplated or presented to the\r\nprobate court, the aggrieved party must file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter\r\nor amend the judgment to preserve the issue for appeal).\r\n\r\n      V.     Conclusion\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, the decision of the circuit court is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Additionally, LeGrand argues the probate court erred in allocating equal damages\r\nto each of the beneficiaries when they previously received proceeds of Echo Tango\r\nsales in unequal amounts. Because we find the circuit court correctly disregarded\r\nthe proceeds in calculating damages, we need not address this argument. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues on\r\nappeal when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5153","title":"Cherry v.

They argue they presented sufficient\r\nevidence to raise a jury question as to whether Levister Logging was an employee\r\nof Myers and not an independent contractor. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nMyers entered into timber harvesting contracts with landowners under which it\r\nwould arrange for a third party to cut timber from the landowner's property and\r\nhaul it to mills that purchased the timber. Myers did not own any log trucks or\r\nequipment and hired logging companies to fulfill its duties. After being hired for a\r\njob on thirteen acres of land in Lancaster County, Myers hired Levister to cut and\r\n\r\n1Appellants are Jane Cherry, as personal representative of the Estate of Nicholas\r\nWayne Cherry; Taylor C., by and through her guardian, Jane Cherry; Carlton\r\nQuinton as personal representative of the Estate of Hannah Nicole Quinton; Alice\r\nQuinton and Carlton Quinton; and Carlton Quinton as guardian for Timothy Q.\r\n\nremove timber from the land. The agreement between Myers and Levister was\r\noral. The terms of the agreement were the rates2 Myers would pay Levister for\r\nharvesting and hauling the lumber to the mills Myers identified. Levister decided\r\nwhat equipment to use and how to set up its equipment at the site. The agreement\r\nwas terminable at will by either party.3\r\n\r\nMyers would send one of its employees to a site at times to make sure the crew had\r\nnot cut any trees on other property and was keeping the property neat, but the\r\nemployee would not remain on site. On March 26, 2007, an employee of Myers\r\nwas on site while one of Levister's trucks, a tractor-trailer rig, was being loaded\r\nwith cut logs. Myers and Levister learned the mill where they had planned to send\r\nthe logs was shut down. One of Levister's employees, George Rogers, was to drive\r\nthe log truck and wanted to take the logs to Bowater Mill. Instead, one of Myers's\r\nemployees instructed him to take the logs to Chester Wood Mill in Chester County.\r\nHowever, the logs that had already been loaded onto the truck had to be cut to\r\nconform to the log size requirements at Chester Wood Mill.\r\n\r\nOnce the logs were loaded, Rogers began driving the truck towards the Chester\r\nWood Mill. The truck approached an intersection with a traffic light. At the same\r\ntime, Alice Quinton, who had just picked up her two children and their two friends\r\nfrom elementary school, was stopped at the intersection in her van. Quinton drove\r\nher van into the intersection, where Roger's truck ran into the driver's side of it.\r\nTragically, two of the children were killed and the other occupants of the van were\r\nseriously injured.4\r\n\r\nAppellants brought wrongful death, survival, and negligence actions against Myers\r\nalleging it was vicariously liable for Rogers's and Levister's negligence. Myers\r\nanswered, asserting Levister was an independent contractor and thus denying it\r\nwas vicariously liable. Myers filed a motion for summary judgment. Following a\r\nhearing, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment, finding\r\nLevister was an independent contractor of Myers and thus Myers was not liable for\r\n\r\n2 Myers paid Levister an agreed amount per ton of wood it cut and loaded onto its\r\ntruck as well as mileage to and from the mill. The drivers were allowed to take\r\nany route they chose, but the rate was calculated based on the shortest route.\r\n3 Myers disputes this in its respondent's brief. However, the circuit court made this\r\nfinding, and Myers did not file an appeal challenging it. Accordingly, it is the law\r\nof the case. See Ulmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006).\r\n4 Rogers was acquitted on charges of reckless homicide following a trial in 2009.\r\n\nthe acts of Levister's employees. The circuit court found (1) Myers had no right to\r\nexercise control over Levister; Levister could harvest the timber and transport it in\r\nany manner it saw fit; (2) Levister was not paid a wage or salary but instead was\r\npaid based on the end result, the amount of timber delivered; (3) Levister furnished\r\nall of its own equipment; and (4) Myers had no right to hire or fire Levister's\r\nemployees. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not\r\nrequiring the services of a fact finder. George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\nS.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\nmotion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In\r\ndetermining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences drawn from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581\r\nS.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting Myers's motion for summary\r\njudgment by finding Levister was an independent contractor and not an employee.\r\nSpecifically, Appellants contend the circuit court erred in (1) finding Myers had no\r\nright or power to control or direct the manner or performance of Levister's work;\r\n(2) finding Myers had no right to fire Levister's personnel; (3) failing to find\r\nMyers's right to exercise control over material elements of payments to Levister\r\ncreated a genuine issue of material fact; and (4) failing to find Myers's right to use\r\nand exercise control over Levister's use of equipment created a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Generally, an employer is not liable for the torts of an independent contractor. No\r\nconcrete rule has been established to determine whether the relationship of\r\nindependent contractor has been established, but the general test is the degree of\r\ncontrol exercised by the employer.\" Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. P'ship, 334\r\nS.C. 96, 116, 512 S.E.2d 510, 520 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations omitted). The\r\ndistinction between employees and independent contractors is not the actual\r\n\ncontrol exercised, but whether there is the right and authority to control and direct\r\nthe particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its\r\naccomplishment. Id. at 116, 512 S.E.2d at 520-21. \"An independent contractor . . .\r\ncontracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods, without being\r\nsubject to the control of his employer except as to the result of his work.\" Id. at\r\n116, 512 S.E.2d at 521 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n             The Courts have encountered much difficulty in\r\n             determining whether under various circumstances a\r\n             person doing work for another was an employee or an\r\n             independent contractor. It is generally recognized that it\r\n             is impossible to formulate a fixed or absolute rule\r\n             applicable to all cases and that each must be determined\r\n             on its own facts. However, there are many well\r\n             recognized and fairly typical indicia of the status of\r\n             independent contractor, even though the presence of one\r\n             or more of them in a case is not necessarily conclusive.\r\n\r\nNorris v. Bryant, 217 S.C. 389, 398, 60 S.E.2d 844, 847 (1950). Courts have\r\nrecognized four factors bearing on the right of control: (1) direct evidence of the\r\nright to, or exercise of, control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishing of\r\nequipment; and (4) right to fire. Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 32, 180 S.E.2d\r\n648, 649 (1971).\r\n\r\nIn Creighton, Partnership hired D & M to do landscaping at a shopping center,\r\nColigny Plaza, it owned. 334 S.C. at 107, 512 S.E.2d at 516. A shopper fell on the\r\nentrance steps to one of the stores, which had two large palm trees with limbs\r\noverhanging the handrails on each side. Id. at 106-07, 512 S.E.2d at 515.\r\nAdditionally, a vine \"was growing along the outer edge of some of the steps and\r\nwas intertwined with portions of the handrails.\" Id. at 107, 512 S.E.2d at 516.\r\nThis court found:\r\n\r\n             The Partnership had no direct control over how or when\r\n             D & M did its work and no control over its daily work\r\n             activities. . . . [C]o-owner of D & M[] supervised and\r\n             directed the employees of D & M. The Partnership paid\r\n             D & M $4,000.00 a month, and did not withhold social\r\n             security or FICA. D & M had job sites other than\r\n             Coligny Plaza. The Partnership did not furnish any\r\n\n             equipment to D & M to perform the maintenance at the\r\n             Plaza. The Partnership had no authority to hire or fire D\r\n             & M employees. [Co-owner] testified he never received\r\n             instructions from the Partnership regarding maintenance\r\n             of the area around [where the shopper fell], and that the\r\n             contract gave him discretion as to how to maintain the\r\n             grounds. Periodically, the partners walked the grounds\r\n             with [co-owner] and showed him specific things that\r\n             needed to be done such as repairing potholes and\r\n             replacing or moving shrubbery. [One of the partners]\r\n             would also communicate his satisfaction or\r\n             dissatisfaction with D & M to [co-owner]. Nothing in the\r\n             record indicates the Partnership controlled the manner or\r\n             means that D & M used to accomplish the requested\r\n             work. The trial court correctly ruled the Partnership was\r\n             not liable for any negligence on the part of D & M in\r\n             maintaining the palms and jasmine at the entrance steps .\r\n             . . because D & M was an independent contractor.\r\n\r\nId. at 117, 512 S.E.2d at 521.\r\n\r\nIn Norris, 217 S.C. at 395, 398, 60 S.E.2d at 846, 847, our supreme court found a\r\nlogging contract somewhat similar to one in this case created the relationship of\r\nindependent contractor between Poinsett Lumber and Manufacturing Company, a\r\ncompany that owned timber land in different locations, and S.C. Grant, who cut the\r\ntimber on one area of Poinsett's land and hauled it to a mill.5 The court found\r\nGrant owned logging equipment and engaged in that business. Id. at 398, 60\r\nS.E.2d at 847.\r\n\r\n             He contracted to cut and haul a large quantity of logs at a\r\n             fixed price. The operation was to cover a period of over\r\n             two years. Poinsett had no right to terminate the contract\r\n             as long as Grant fulfilled the conditions and requirements\r\n             set forth therein. Grant was to furnish his own equipment\r\n             and to pay all employees and subcontractors engaged by\r\n\r\n5The court found it was for the jury to determine whether the relationship between\r\nGrant and his employee was that of an independent contractor. Id. at 405, 60\r\nS.E.2d at 850.\r\n\n             him. He had the right to control and direct the manner in\r\n             which the details of the work were to be executed.\r\n             Poinsett reserved no control over Grant's employees.\r\n             Grant was to produce a given result and was to determine\r\n             the means by which such result was to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nId. The court also noted, \"Hauling contracts of a similar nature have also been held\r\nto create the relation of employer and independent contractor in other\r\njurisdictions.\" Id. at 399, 60 S.E.2d at 847. The court found \"it is clear from a\r\nconsideration of the entire contract that the general direction and supervision\r\nreserved to Poinsett related only to the result to be attained and not to the details of\r\nthe operation.\" Id. at 399, 60 S.E.2d at 848.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment. Appellants did\r\nnot present evidence Myers had control over Levister. Levister could harvest the\r\ntimber how it wanted, owned all of the equipment, and was paid based on the end\r\nresult. Myers could not directly fire Levister's employees, and Levister paid its\r\nown employees, including withholding taxes. Myers's being able to tell Levister it\r\nwas leaving too much stump or leaving ruts in the ground is similar to Creighton in\r\nwhich the partnership would give D & M specific instructions of what needed\r\nattention. The arrangement here is also like the one in Norris between Poinsett and\r\nGrant. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in granting Myers summary\r\njudgment by finding the only evidence was that Levister was an independent\r\ncontractor. Therefore, the circuit court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5154","title":"Trimmier v.

Trimmier appeals the order of the Administrative\r\nLaw Court (ALC) affirming the South Carolina State Board of Dentistry's (the\r\nBoard's) order granting his request for relicensure conditioned upon his provision\r\nof written evidence regarding the status of his Georgia license. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nTrimmier has been licensed in Georgia, New York,1 and South Carolina during his\r\ncareer as a dentist. He has been the subject of disciplinary action in South Carolina\r\nand New York arising out of his conviction in 2002 for filing false claims with the\r\nSouth Carolina Medicaid program.2 The Board and Trimmier entered into a\r\ndisciplinary consent agreement dated December 7, 2002. Trimmier's license was\r\nsuspended for six years, which was stayed to probation provided he paid a civil\r\npenalty of $25,000 and completed eight hours of Board-approved ethical training\r\nand education. Trimmier complied with the consent agreement but discontinued\r\npracticing in South Carolina and moved to Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Georgia Board of Dentistry (the Georgia Board) suspended Trimmier's\r\nlicense for six years with it being actively suspended for the first ninety days, and\r\nthe remainder of the time he would be on probation. This sanction was the result\r\nof a consent agreement with the Georgia Board3 after it discovered Trimmier\r\nsubmitted an application for a sedation permit that falsely indicated he had never\r\nbeen convicted of a crime. The Georgia Board issued a probationary sedation\r\npermit when it had no knowledge of these misleading responses.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the Georgia Board again reprimanded Trimmier for performing a\r\nprocedure on a patient while sedated after the probationary sedation permit he had\r\nreceived lapsed. Although there were no accusations of patient endangerment, the\r\nGeorgia Board revoked his license. Trimmier appealed the revocation and won.\r\nThe circuit court ordered the Georgia Board to dispense less severe sanctions.\r\nTherefore, beginning October 2009, Trimmier was on indefinite suspension but\r\ncould go before the Georgia Board for reinstatement after two years. Instead of\r\nwaiting the two years and reapplying, or simply doing nothing, Trimmier\r\nvoluntarily surrendered his Georgia license in April 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The status of Trimmier's New York license is not at issue in this appeal.\r\n2  Trimmier was also reprimanded for publishing a misleading advertisement\r\nsuggesting he was a specialist in pediatric dentistry and failing to properly\r\nsupervise auxiliary personnel.\r\n3 The 2003 Georgia Consent Order also required Trimmier to complete sixteen\r\nhours of coursework in professional ethics, twelve hours of coursework in risk\r\nmanagement, and the course on Law, Ethics, and Professionalism at the Medical\r\nCollege of Georgia. Additionally, he was fined $20,000.\r\n\nTrimmier moved to South Carolina and decided to practice here. He petitioned to\r\nhave his South Carolina license reinstated.4 His greater than six-year absence from\r\npractice in South Carolina meant his license here was inactive and he had to seek\r\nrelicensure. At that hearing, conducted in July 2010, the Board inquired into the\r\nstatus of Trimmier's Georgia and New York licenses.\r\n\r\n              Q. You voluntarily surrendered your license in Georgia?\r\n\r\n              A. That's correct.\r\n\r\n              Q. Let me ask you, what was the status of your license in\r\n              Georgia prior to that surrender?\r\n\r\n              A. That was the suspension pending - - which I could've\r\n                 appealed. But you know, rather than keep going on\r\n                 and rehashing the same thing, I just said, you know,\r\n                 forgiveness is better.\r\n\r\n              Q. Are you saying that your license - -\r\n\r\n              A. Put that to bed.\r\n\r\n              Q. - - are you saying that your license was suspended\r\n              just -- when you surrendered it?\r\n\r\n              A. Yes\r\n\r\nBecause the Board had concerns about the facts underlying Trimmier's apparently\r\nongoing issues with the Georgia Board, the Board members requested transcripts\r\nand information regarding those proceedings. The record is unclear if Trimmier\r\nprovided any additional information, but the Board issued an order later that month\r\ngranting his South Carolina license upon the condition that he \"provide\r\ndocumentary evidence satisfactory to the Board that his license and/or certificates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4   Trimmier was pardoned for his misdemeanor convictions in 2007.\r\n\nfrom Georgia, New York [,] and any other states of licensure are in good standing,\r\nwhether active or inactive.\"5\r\n\r\nTrimmier subsequently filed a motion for the Board to reconsider its order and\r\nanother hearing was held. The issue of the Georgia license was again a subject of\r\nmuch discussion.\r\n\r\n             Q. So you would submit that your license - - I just want\r\n             to be clear. I know this is probably asking the same\r\n             question over. You submit that your license to practice\r\n             in Georgia is in good standing but inactive?\r\n\r\n             A. \tYes\r\n\r\nTrimmier's attorney tried to clarify the issue.\r\n\r\n             Q. In other words, there were no charges against him in\r\n             Georgia when he took this inactive status?\r\n\r\n             A. [Attorney] When he took the status in Georgia I\r\n             believe everything had been resolved in front of the\r\n             court. He had taken an appeal at some point. It had been\r\n             resolved to the extent that he was now back at square one\r\n             to reapply in Georgia and rather than go through all the\r\n             rigmarole and effort and expenditure, he just said I'm\r\n             done with Georgia.\r\n\r\n             A. [Trimmier] See you later[.] \tSays I owe no fees[.] I'm\r\n                fine. Everything's good with them.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Board granted Trimmier's license conditional upon proof of \"written\r\nevidence to the Board which is satisfactory, in the Board's discretion, that shows\r\nhis Georgia license either was in good standing at the time of his voluntary\r\nsurrender and/or that there were no disciplinary or other impediments, pending or\r\n\r\n5 Trimmier provided a letter from New York, which the Board found satisfactory,\r\nthat indicated he completed the period of probation he was on in that state and his\r\nfiled was closed.\r\n\notherwise, against his license at that time.\" Trimmier appealed this order to the\r\nALC, which affirmed the Board's order. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe review of decisions from the ALC is governed by section 1-23-380(5) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), which states:\r\n\r\n             The court may not substitute its judgment for the\r\n             judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence\r\n             on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision\r\n             of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.\r\n             The court may reverse or modify the decision if\r\n             substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced\r\n             because the administrative findings, inferences,\r\n             conclusions, or decisions are:\r\n\r\n             (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n             (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n             (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n             (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n             (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,\r\n             and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n             (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of\r\n             discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.    Violation of Section 40-1-110(1)\r\n\r\nTrimmier argues the Board exceeded its statutory authority by conditioning his\r\nrelicensure upon action by the Georgia Board and because such a requirement was\r\nnot a part of the 2002 consent agreement. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 40-1-110 of the South Carolina Code (2011) states: \"In addition to other\r\ngrounds contained in this article and the respective board's chapter: (1) A board\r\nmay cancel, fine, suspend, revoke, or restrict the authorization to practice . . . .\"\r\nBecause Trimmier elected to let his license lapse in South Carolina, his application\r\nfor licensure in 2010 was not a continuation of the 2002 proceedings but a new\r\n\nrequest to be licensed in the State. Consequently, the authority granted to the\r\nBoard under section 40-1-110(1), which relates to disciplinary action by the Board,\r\nis irrelevant to this appeal and cannot serve as a basis for reversing the ALC's\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n   II.   Unlawful Procedure\r\n\r\nTrimmier also argues the Board's decision was made upon unlawful procedure\r\nbecause it delegated the Board's decision making authority to Georgia. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nSection 40-15-170 of the South Carolina Code (2011) provides:\r\n\r\n            If an individual's license to practice dentistry or dental\r\n            hygiene is revoked by another state for cause this shall, in\r\n            the discretion of the board, constitute grounds for\r\n            revocation of his South Carolina license. The license of a\r\n            dentist or dental hygienist who does not either reside or\r\n            practice in South Carolina for a period of six successive\r\n            years is considered inactive. . . . Relicensing after an\r\n            absence of over six years may be made at the discretion\r\n            of the board upon proof of high professional fitness and\r\n            moral character.\r\n\r\nSection 40-15-140 of the South Carolina Code (2011) states, \"An applicant who\r\nholds a license or certificate from any jurisdiction shall certify that he has not\r\nviolated any of the provisions of the Dental Practice Act governing his prior\r\nlicense or practice or operation.\" Under section 40-15-170, the Board may revoke\r\na license based solely on the revocation of a dentist's license in another State.\r\n\r\nThe Board is permitted discretion in determining whether to issue a license and\r\nmay require the candidate to demonstrate \"high professional fitness and moral\r\ncharacter.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-170. Requiring Trimmier to provide\r\ndocumentation he was not currently facing any new or additional charges before\r\nthe Georgia Board was well within the Board's discretion in light of Trimmier's\r\npast failures to comply with various requirements of the practice of dentistry.\r\nFurthermore, sections 40-15-140 and -170 specifically contemplate the Board's\r\nconsideration of a license applicant's standing in other states. Any argument the\r\nBoard should disregard Trimmier's license in Georgia because he voluntarily\r\n\nsurrendered it is completely without merit. Ignoring the status of a professional\r\nlicense in another State could permit a dentist or other professional to forum shop\r\nto a new location in order to avoid admonition in another State. Consequently, we\r\nfind the ALC did not abuse its discretion in affirming the Board's decision.\r\n\r\n   III.   Substantial Evidence\r\n\r\nNext, Trimmier argues the Board erred because substantial evidence in the record\r\ndemonstrates he cannot comply with the condition imposed. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that, considering the record as a whole,\r\na reasonable mind would accept to support an administrative agency's action.\"\r\nPorter v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 333 S.C. 12, 20, 507 S.E.2d 328, 332 (1998).\r\n\"Furthermore, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the\r\nevidence does not prevent a court from concluding that substantial evidence\r\nsupports an administrative agency's finding.\" Id. at 21, 507 S.E.2d at 332.\r\n\r\nTrimmier's own testimony provides substantial evidence supporting the Board's\r\ndecision to condition his relicensure on proof of good standing in Georgia.\r\nAccording to him \"everything was good\" with the Georgia Board when he\r\nsurrendered his license. Trimmier asserted, and his counsel agreed, the only\r\nimpediment in being reinstated in Georgia was administrative, not disciplinary.\r\nThe surrender of Trimmier's license indicates his license is \"terminated\" but only\r\n\"unless and until such time as [his] license may be reinstated, in the sole discretion\r\nof the [Georgia] Board.\"\r\n\r\nThis evidence substantially supports that Trimmier can obtain documentation\r\nevidencing he has complied with the sanctions imposed against him in Georgia and\r\nis eligible to apply for reinstatement, or Trimmier can actually apply for\r\nreinstatement in Georgia. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the\r\ncondition imposed by the Board can be achieved even if it is, in Trimmier's\r\nopinion, burdensome.\r\n\r\n   IV.    Arbitrary and Capricious\r\n\r\nFinally, Trimmier argues the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\n\"A decision is arbitrary if it is without a rational basis, is based alone on one's will\r\nand not upon any course of reasoning and exercise of judgment, is made at\r\npleasure, without adequate determining principles, or is governed by no fixed rules\r\nor standards.\" Deese v. S.C. State Bd. of Dentistry, 286 S.C. 182, 184-85, 332\r\nS.E.2d 539, 541 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\nThe determination by the Board to condition Trimmier's licensure upon sufficient\r\nproof of good standing in Georgia rationally relates to a protection of the public's\r\ninterest. Trimmier has, on more than one occasion, been reprimanded by the\r\nboards governing his chosen field. The requirements placed upon dentists are in\r\nplace to protect the citizenry and ensure the public has access to safe and\r\ntrustworthy dental care. Requiring further explanation and demonstration of good\r\nstanding with the Georgia Board is rationally related to fulfilling this purpose.\r\nTherefore, we conclude the Board's decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious,\r\nand the ALC did not abuse its discretion in affirming it.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the decision of the ALC is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5155","title":"Busillo v.

The\r\ncity argues on appeal that the trial court erred in making two evidentiary rulings\r\nand in not using a special verdict form. We affirm.\r\n\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOfficer Ryan Terrell attempted a U-turn after a traffic stop and collided with a\r\nvehicle driven by Busillo. Busillo filed a claim for property damage with the city's\r\ninsurance company. An arbitration panel ruled the city was responsible for\r\n$4,184.70 in repairs to Busillo's vehicle and for the cost of a rental car.\r\n\r\nBusillo also filed this action in circuit court. At trial, she submitted evidence of\r\nbodily injuries and medical costs. She also submitted evidence of property damage\r\nto her car. This evidence included a summary of expenses showing $6,034.70 in\r\nproperty damage, and the testimony of an expert witness, Frank Troy, who testified\r\nto the extent of the depreciation to Busillo's vehicle caused by the wreck.\r\nFollowing the charge to the jury but before the jury began deliberations, the city\r\nasked the trial court to consider using a special verdict form. The court denied this\r\nrequest. After the jury returned a verdict for Busillo, the trial court applied the\r\narbitration award as a setoff against the verdict, but denied the city's motions for a\r\nnew trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\n\r\n      II.    The Expert on Depreciation—Issue Preservation\r\n\r\nThe city argues on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of\r\nFrank Troy. Specifically, the city argues the trial court abused its discretion by (1)\r\nnot \"consider[ing] that the type of witness and content of the witness's testimony\r\nwere not disclosed until the day of trial,\" (2) not \"inquir[ing] into [Busillo's] excuse\r\nfor [her] Rule 33(b) [SCRCP] violation,\" and (3) not \"consider[ing] the surprise\r\nand prejudice to [the city].\" The first of these arguments was not adequately\r\npresented to the trial court, and the second and third were not presented to the trial\r\ncourt at all. Therefore, we find the city's arguments are not preserved for appellate\r\nreview. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998)\r\n(stating \"an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\nraised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review\");\r\nArmstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 225, 621 S.E.2d 368, 378 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(stating \"[b]ecause this argument was not presented to the trial court . . . . the\r\nmatter is not preserved and we decline to address it\").\r\n\r\nDuring a pretrial hearing, the city's lawyer stated, \"The … last thing we have is our\r\nsecond motion in limine . . . to exclude any testimony of Frank Troy.\" The trial\r\ncourt responded, \"Who is that?\" and the city's lawyer stated, \"He was never listed\r\nin discovery.\" The court said, \"Oh, this is the depreciation guy,\" and the city\r\n\nresponded, \"Yeah, a fact witness or an expert witness.\" The trial court stated it\r\nwould \"probably\" let Busillo introduce Troy's testimony. The court then stated,\r\n\"Let's just see how nimble you are on your feet.\" The city responded, \"Very good,\r\nyour Honor,\" and asked if the trial court intended to apply the arbitration award as\r\na setoff. The court indicated it would, \"somehow or another,\" but that it would\r\nthink about the issue during trial. Nothing further was mentioned regarding Troy\r\nbefore the trial began.\r\n\r\nWhen Busillo called Troy to testify, the trial court acknowledged the city's pretrial\r\nobjection by stating, \"Now, this is over your objection.\" During Troy's testimony,\r\nhe was asked \"what was your determination regarding the depreciation on Ms.\r\nBusillo's vehicle due to this automobile collision?\" At that point, the city's lawyer\r\nstated only, \"Objection,\" but offered no grounds for the objection and did not\r\nreference his pretrial motion. The trial court overruled the objection without\r\nreference to any basis on which the objection was made. The city made no other\r\nobjections during Troy's testimony.\r\n\r\nThe mere statement \"objection\" during a witness's testimony does not preserve any\r\nargument for appeal because such a general statement does not bring the specific\r\ngrounds for the objection to the attention of the trial court. See Rule 103(a)(1),\r\nSCRE (\"Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits . . . evidence\r\nunless . . . a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the\r\nspecific ground of objection . . . .\" (emphasis added)); State v. Byers, 392 S.C. 438,\r\n444, 710 S.E.2d 55, 58 (2011) (\"For an objection to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview, the objection must be made . . . with sufficient specificity to inform the\r\ncircuit court judge of the point being urged by the objector.\"); Wilder Corp., 330\r\nS.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (\"[A]n objection must be sufficiently specific to\r\ninform the trial court of the point . . . .\").\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that the context of the proceeding may make the specific\r\nground for the objection sufficiently apparent to the trial court so that a general\r\nstatement such as \"objection\" is enough to preserve an argument for appeal. See\r\nRule 103(a)(1) (stating the requirement of \"stating the specific ground of\r\nobjection\" applies \"if the specific ground was not apparent from the context\");\r\nByers, 392 S.C. at 446, 710 S.E.2d at 59 (stating \"to be preserved, the objection\r\nmust include a specific ground 'if the specific ground was not apparent from the\r\ncontext'\" (quoting Rule 103(a)(1))). Because the trial court acknowledged the\r\ncity's pretrial objection, we look back to that discussion as part of the context from\r\n\nwhich the trial court could have understood any specific ground for the city's\r\nobjection.1\r\n\r\nWe find the grounds the city now argues on appeal were not apparent to the trial\r\ncourt from the context of the proceedings, including the pretrial hearing. Not only\r\nwas the statement \"objection\" insufficient to preserve any issue, the city's\r\nstatements in the pretrial hearing also were not sufficiently specific. Of the three\r\narguments the city makes on appeal, the only one even remotely presented to the\r\ntrial court in the pretrial hearing was the first—that Troy \"was never listed in\r\ndiscovery.\" However, the city (1) never indicated it served discovery on Busillo,\r\n(2) never identified which interrogatory Busillo supposedly did not answer, (3)\r\nnever argued Busillo's failure to respond was intentional or willful, (4) never\r\nprovided the court any basis for finding a Rule 33(b) violation,2 (5) never\r\naddressed any of the factors our courts have set out for considering the\r\nadmissibility of testimony of a witness not named in discovery,3 and (6) never\r\nexplained any basis on which the trial court could conclude the city was prejudiced\r\nby the late disclosure. Nor were any of these points apparent to the trial court\r\nduring the pretrial hearing. Thus, the city did not provide the trial court any basis\r\nin the pretrial hearing on which the court could have excluded Troy's testimony for\r\na discovery violation. Under these circumstances, even the pretrial objection was\r\n\r\n\r\n1   There is no written motion in the record.\r\n2 Standard interrogatory 6 in Rule 33(b) would have required Busillo to list Troy as\r\na witness. However, the standard interrogatories must be served before any\r\nobligation arises to answer them. See Rule 33(b), SCRCP (stating \"the following\r\nstandard interrogatories may be served by one party upon another\"). The city's\r\nbrief also does not cite any discovery questions served on Busillo or any\r\ncircumstances of her alleged failure to answer. Even if the city did serve standard\r\ninterrogatory 6 or some similar discovery question, the important fact here is that\r\nthe city did not inform the trial court that it did, or of any circumstances of a failure\r\nto answer. Thus, the city did not give the trial court in the pretrial hearing a basis\r\nfor finding that Busillo's alleged failure to answer required Troy's testimony to be\r\nexcluded.\r\n3See Jenkins v. Few, 391 S.C. 209, 219, 705 S.E.2d 457, 462 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(discussing factors a trial court should consider before excluding a witness not\r\nnamed in discovery).\r\n\nnot \"made . . . with sufficient specificity to inform the circuit court judge of the\r\npoint.\" Byers, 392 S.C. at 444, 710 S.E.2d at 58.\r\n\r\nBecause none of the city's arguments on appeal as to the admissibility of Troy's\r\ntestimony were properly raised to the trial court, the arguments are not preserved\r\nfor appellate review.\r\n\r\n      III.   Evidence of Property Damage\r\n\r\nThe city also argues the trial court erred in admitting \"evidence about [Busillo's]\r\nproperty damage\" because \"[t]hese damages had been resolved prior to trial.\"\r\nDuring Busillo's testimony, she offered into evidence an exhibit entitled \"Expenses\r\nfor Kristin Busillo.\" The exhibit summarized the damages Busillo claimed,\r\nbreaking out \"Property Damage\" and \"Medical Damages\" in separate categories.\r\nUnder the category of property damage, the exhibit read:\r\n\r\n                                   Property Damage\r\n\r\n             Depreciation                                       $1,850.00\r\n             Repairs                                            $3,677.89\r\n             Rental Vehicle                                       $506.81\r\n                   Total PD Expenses                            $6,034.70\r\n\r\nThe city objected under Rules 402 and 403, SCRE, arguing the city's previous\r\npayment of the repair and rental car bills made property damages \"not a proper\r\nelement of damages.\"\r\n\r\nLike the objection to Troy's testimony, this objection was stated generally and\r\nimprecisely. We find, however, that it is preserved for appeal because the\r\ntranscript reveals the trial court understood the nature of the objection and thus \"the\r\nspecific ground was . . . apparent from the context\" under Rule 103(a)(1).\r\n\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court, and the court's\r\ndecision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Weaver\r\nv. Lentz, 348 S.C. 672, 683, 561 S.E.2d 360, 366 (Ct. App. 2002). \"The trial court\r\n. . . has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence . . . .\" Davis v.\r\nTraylor, 340 S.C. 150, 155, 530 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 2000). Similarly, a trial\r\ncourt has particularly wide discretion in ruling on Rule 403 objections. See State v.\r\nAdams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"A trial judge's\r\n\ndecision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of\r\nevidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances. We . . . are\r\nobligated to give great deference to the trial court's judgment [regarding Rule\r\n403].\" (internal citation omitted)). We agree with the city that the pretrial\r\nresolution of the property damages claim rendered the evidence less probative.\r\nThe trial judge nevertheless determined the evidence was relevant and had\r\nprobative value because the evidence assisted the jury in understanding the severity\r\nof the collision. We find that determination to be within the discretion of the trial\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nWe also find the evidence created no danger of unfair prejudice or confusion of the\r\nissues. See State v. Gilchrist, 329 S.C. 621, 630, 496 S.E.2d 424, 429 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (stating unfair prejudice \"refers to evidence which tends to suggest decision\r\non an improper basis\" (citation and quotation marks omitted)). The city's only\r\nargument of unfair prejudice was that admitting evidence of property damage\r\nallowed a double recovery. The trial court eliminated that concern when it applied\r\nthe arbitrator's award against the verdict as a setoff. The city also argued admitting\r\nthe evidence \"would lead to jury confusion.\" The trial court engaged in a lengthy\r\ndiscussion with counsel to understand the potential for jury confusion. Ultimately,\r\nthe court decided that allowing the jury to consider the evidence and then applying\r\nthe arbitration award as a setoff against any verdict would simplify, rather than\r\nconfuse, the issues. We find the trial court properly exercised its discretion and\r\nacted within it to admit the evidence.\r\n\r\n      IV.    Special Verdict Form\r\n\r\nWhen the city requested a special verdict form, the trial court stated, \"I think mine\r\ncovers it along with my instructions,\" and denied the request. We affirm the trial\r\ncourt's decision not to use the special verdict form pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1),\r\nSCACR, and the following authority: S.C. Dep't. of Transp. v. First Carolina\r\nCorp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 300, 641 S.E.2d 903, 906 (2007) (\"The determination\r\nof whether a special verdict should be submitted to the jury is within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court will only reverse upon a finding\r\nof an abuse of that discretion.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\nWILLIAMS, J., dissenting: I respectfully dissent. I believe the city's argument\r\nregarding the admission of testimony of Frank Troy, an undisclosed witness, was\r\nproperly preserved for appeal. Further, I would find that the trial court erred in\r\nfailing to inquire into the necessary factors before admitting the undisclosed\r\nwitness's testimony. See Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 627, 620 S.E.2d 59, 63-64\r\n(2005) (finding the trial court is under a duty, when the situation arises, to delay\r\nthe trial for the purpose of ascertaining information relating to the factors used to\r\ndetermine whether an undisclosed witness should be excluded).\r\n\r\nIn Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C. 142, 558 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 2001), this court\r\nenunciated five factors that a trial court must consider before imposing the sanction\r\nof excluding a witness not disclosed in discovery. The Jumper factors are \"(1) the\r\ntype of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence emanating from the\r\nproffered witness; (3) the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to furnish the\r\nwitness' name; (4) the degree of surprise to the other party, including the prior\r\nknowledge of the name of the witness; and (5) the prejudice to the opposing party.\"\r\nId. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at 916. \"[T]he trial court is under a duty, when the situation\r\narises, to delay the trial for the purpose of ascertaining [information relating to the\r\nJumper factors].\" Laney v. Hefley, 262 S.C. 54, 59, 202 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1974)\r\n(quoting with approval Wright v. Royse, 43 Ill.App.2d 267, 288, 193 N.E.2d 340,\r\n350 (1963)). \"After inquiring, the [trial] court has discretion whether to admit or\r\nexclude the testimony.\" Callen, 365 S.C. at 627, 620 S.E.2d at 64. Failing to\r\ninquire into the Jumper factors before admitting the testimony of an undisclosed\r\nwitness amounts to a failure to exercise discretion and requires reversal and a new\r\ntrial. Id. (reversing and requiring a new hearing when the \"family court failed to\r\nmake the inquiry required under Laney and Jumper and [thereby] failed to exercise\r\nits discretion\"); see also Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566\r\n(1987) (\"When the trial [court] is vested with discretion, but [its] ruling reveals no\r\ndiscretion was, in fact, exercised, an error of law has occurred.\").\r\n\r\nIn the instant action, the city argues the trial court erred in failing to consider the\r\nJumper factors before allowing Troy to testify.4 At the pretrial hearing, the city\r\n\r\n4 The majority frames the city's argument regarding the testimony of the\r\nundisclosed witness as three separate arguments on appeal: (1) not \"consider[ing]\r\nthat the type of witness and content of the witness's testimony were not disclosed\r\nuntil the day of trial,\" (2) not \"inquir[ing] into [Busillo's] excuse for [her] Rule\r\n33(b) [SCRCP] violation,\" and (3) not \"consider[ing] the surprise and prejudice to\r\n[the city].\" In its brief, the city specifically highlights these three factors, which it\r\n\nbegan its argument to exclude Troy's testimony, but was immediately interrupted\r\nby the trial court asking, \"Who is that?\" The city continued to state that Troy \"was\r\nnever listed in discovery.\" Again, the trial court interrupted and stated, \"Oh, this is\r\nthe depreciation guy?\" The city replied, \"Yeah, a fact witness or an expert witness\r\n. . .\"5 The trial court interrupted for a third time and stated twice that it would\r\n\"probably let him do that,\" indicating that Troy would be allowed to testify and the\r\ncity's motion to exclude was being denied. When Troy was called to testify during\r\ntrial, the court stated to the city, \"Now, this is over your objection. Over your\r\nobjection.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the city's actions at trial are sufficient to preserve this issue for appeal.\r\nThe conversation during the pre-trial conference, while brief, conveyed the\r\nnecessary information to sufficiently preserve the city's objection. Based upon its\r\nresponses to the city's argument, the trial court exhibited familiarity with Troy and\r\nthe nature of his testimony. While the city's argument to exclude Troy was very\r\nlimited, it conveyed the crucial point that Troy was \"never listed in discovery.\"\r\nUpon learning of an undisclosed witness, the trial court is \"under a duty . . . to\r\ndelay the trial for the purpose of ascertaining [information relating to the Jumper\r\nfactors].\" Callen, 365 S.C. at 627, 620 S.E.2d at 63-64 (quoting Laney, 262 S.C. at\r\n59-60, 202 S.E.2d at 14).\r\n\r\nFurther, any inadequacy that the majority finds with the sufficiency of the city's\r\nobjection is a direct result of the trial court's repeated interruption of the city's\r\nargument. Thus, the city's failure to elaborate or explain its position or the relevant\r\nSouth Carolina law should not preclude this court from considering the underlying\r\nissue. See State v. Ross, 272 S.C. 56, 60, 249 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1978) (declining to\r\nhold that counsel \"must try to speak over [a judge]\" in order to preserve an\r\nobjection when the judge interrupts the attempted explanation of that objection);\r\nsee also Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC v. Lewis, 398 S.C. 323, 333, 730\r\nS.E.2d 282, 287 (2012) (Toal, C.J., dissenting) (\"[W]here the question of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontends the trial court failed to consider before making its decision. However,\r\nreading the argument section as a whole, including the city's numerous citations to\r\nand discussion of Jumper, it is clear the city is arguing the trial court failed to\r\naddress the Jumper factors before allowing Busillo's undisclosed witness to testify.\r\n5The first of the five Jumper factors is \"the type of witness involved\" and concerns\r\nwhether the undisclosed witness is a fact witness or an expert witness.\r\n\npreservation is subject to multiple interpretations, any doubt should be resolved in\r\nfavor of preservation.\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I do not believe the city's failure to make a contemporaneous\r\nobjection renders this issue unpreserved. As Troy was called to testify at trial, the\r\ntrial court stated to the city, \"Now, this is over your objection.\" With this\r\nstatement, the trial court renewed its holding from the pretrial hearing.\r\nAccordingly, the city did not need to renew its motion to exclude Troy's testimony.\r\nSee Fettler v. Gentner, 396 S.C. 461, 469, 722 S.E.2d 26, 31 (Ct. App. 2012)\r\n(\"This [c]ourt does not require parties to engage in futile actions in order to\r\npreserve issues for appellate review.\"); Rule 43(i), SCRCP (\"Counsel shall not\r\nattempt to further argue any matter after he has been heard and the ruling of the\r\ncourt has been pronounced.\").\r\n\r\nOn the merits of this issue, I believe the trial court erred in failing to inquire into\r\nthe five Jumper factors before allowing Troy to testify. The record is void of\r\ninquiry into any these factors. Accordingly, I would reverse and remand for a new\r\ntrial. See Callen, 365 S.C. at 627, 620 S.E.2d at 64 (reversing and requiring a new\r\nhearing when the \"family court failed to make the inquiry required under . . .\r\nJumper and [thereby] failed to exercise its discretion\").\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5156","title":"State v.

He argues the trial court erred\r\nin (1) refusing to instruct the jury that a person acting in self-defense has the right\r\n\nto continue shooting until the threat has ended and (2) refusing to charge the jury\r\non South Carolina Code subsection 16-11-450(A) (Supp. 2012), which provides\r\nimmunity from prosecution for persons \"justified in using deadly force.\" We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 2008, Marin attended a Colombian Independence Day party at a\r\nnightclub in Greenville. His acquaintance Nelson Tabares was also present, and\r\nafter several hours Tabares became so intoxicated he was unable to drive. Marin\r\nclaimed to know where Tabares lived and offered to drive him home. The bouncer\r\nat the club testified that Tabares, although still able to converse, was stumbling\r\naround the club and needed help getting to Marin's vehicle.1 The bouncer and\r\nAlfredo Jimenez helped Tabares into the backseat. Marin drove, with Jimenez in\r\nthe passenger seat, towards Tabares's home in Greer.\r\n\r\nMarin testified he and Jimenez were discussing politics when \"all of a sudden Mr.\r\nTabares says 'I'm sorry but he's got to go.' And he jumps up and he grabs me in a\r\nheadlock.\" This caused the vehicle to swerve into the oncoming lane and head\r\ntoward a telephone pole. After the initial attack, Marin was \"very scared\" and\r\ndecided not to take Tabares home. He testified, \"I was just trying to find a public\r\nplace . . . where I could . . . possibly jump out of the car and get some help.\"\r\n\r\nMarin apparently drove for some time after the initial incident, eventually reaching\r\ndowntown Spartanburg. He testified, \"Everything was dark and everything was\r\nclosed. I mean, I was looking for a public place with people somewhere stopped,\r\n\r\n1 At the time of his death, Tabares's blood alcohol level was .323. The pathologist\r\ntestified that \"at a .300 level everybody is drunk.\" Perhaps the pathologist was\r\nengaged in understatement, as medical literature generally rates the consequences\r\nof such a high level of blood alcohol to be much more severe than \"drunk.\" See,\r\ne.g., Vincent J. DiMaio & Dominick DiMaio, Forensic Pathology 519 (2d ed.\r\n2001) (listing symptoms of blood alcohol levels above 0.300 as \"impaired\r\nconsciousness, stupor, unconsciousness\"); James C. Garriott & Joseph E.\r\nManno, Pharmacology and Toxicology of Ethyl Alcohol, in Garriott's Medicolegal\r\nAspects of Alcohol 25, 28 (James C. Garriott ed., 5th ed. 2008) (listing symptoms\r\nof blood alcohol levels above 0.350 as \"complete unconsciousness, coma,\r\nanesthesia, depressed or abolished reflexes . . . and possible death\").\r\n\nbut everything, I mean, it was dark. Nothing seemed to be open.\" He explained\r\nTabares repeatedly tried to grab the steering wheel and Marin repeatedly pushed\r\nhim into the backseat.2 After Tabares again tried to run the car off the road, Marin\r\npulled his loaded gun out of the glove compartment and shot him. Tabares died\r\nfrom two gunshot wounds to the back of his head.\r\n\r\nThe trial court charged the jury on murder, voluntary manslaughter, and self-\r\ndefense. After the charge, the court asked, \"Are there any [objections] to the\r\ninstruction or requests for additions to the instruction?\" Marin renewed his earlier\r\nrequest that the court charge immunity under subsection 16-11-450(A). Marin also\r\nstated, quoting language from the dissenting opinion in State v. Rye, 375 S.C. 119,\r\n651 S.E.2d 321 (2007), \"I would like . . . , 'If the defendant is justified in defending\r\nhimself or others and in firing the first shot, then the defendant is also justified in\r\ncontinuing to shoot until it is apparent that the danger of death or serious bodily\r\ninjury has completely ended.'\" 375 S.C. at 134, 651 S.E.2d at 328 (Moore, J.,\r\ndissenting) (quoting the jury charge from the trial of that case). The trial court\r\ndenied both requests. The jury found Marin guilty of murder and the trial court\r\nsentenced him to life in prison.3\r\n\r\n      II.     The \"Continuing to Shoot\" Charge\r\n\r\nThis court will not reverse a trial court's decision to refuse a specific request to\r\ncharge unless the trial court committed an error of law. See State v. Commander,\r\n396 S.C. 254, 270, 721 S.E.2d 413, 421-22 (2011) (\"An appellate court will not\r\nreverse the trial judge's decision regarding a jury charge absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\"); State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 570, 647 S.E.2d 144, 166 (2007) (\"An\r\nabuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law .\r\n. . .\"). The trial court is required to charge the correct law applicable to the case.\r\nState v. Mattison, 388 S.C. 469, 478-79, 697 S.E.2d 578, 583 (2010); State v.\r\nBurkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002). When a party requests\r\n\r\n2 Jimenez, the passenger and only other eyewitness in this case, did not testify at\r\ntrial. Multiple witnesses testified that Jimenez's statements to law enforcement\r\nimmediately after the incident and while assisting investigators with recreating the\r\nevents leading up to Tabares's death corroborated Marin's trial testimony.\r\n3Pursuant to subsection 16-23-490(A) of the South Carolina Code (2003), the trial\r\ncourt did not impose a sentence for possession of a weapon during the commission\r\nof a violent crime.\r\n\nthe trial court charge a correct and applicable principle of law, the court must\r\ncharge it. State v. Brandt, 393 S.C. 526, 549, 713 S.E.2d 591, 603 (2011).\r\nHowever, the court is not required to use any particular language in explaining the\r\nprinciple. Id.; Mattison, 388 S.C. at 479, 697 S.E.2d at 583; Burkhart, 350 S.C. at\r\n261, 565 S.E.2d at 303. When reviewing a challenge to a trial court's refusal to use\r\nthe specific language in a request to charge, an appellate court must consider the\r\ncharge as a whole in evaluating whether the trial court charged the correct law\r\napplicable to the case. Brandt, 393 S.C. at 549, 713 S.E.2d at 603; Barber v. State,\r\n393 S.C. 232, 236, 712 S.E.2d 436, 438 (2011). Therefore, there is no error of law\r\nin refusing to give a specific request to charge where (1) the charge requested is an\r\nincorrect statement of law, or (2) the trial court used language different from that\r\nrequested, but considering the charge as a whole, the charge as given stated the\r\nrequested principle of law correctly. As we will explain, we find no error.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned the charge Marin requested is not a correct statement of law.4\r\nSelf-defense is premised on a person's right to use deadly force when, under the\r\ncircumstances, he reasonably believes such force is necessary to prevent death or\r\nserious bodily injury. See State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 46, 317 S.E.2d 452, 453\r\n(1984) (describing the third element of self-defense—\"a reasonably prudent man of\r\nordinary firmness and courage would have . . . belie[ved he was in imminent\r\ndanger]\" and requiring for \"actual[] . . . imminent danger, the circumstances were\r\nsuch as would warrant a man of ordinary prudence, firmness and courage to strike\r\nthe fatal blow in order to save himself\"). Therefore, if the State has not proven the\r\nabsence of any other element, see id., a person may use deadly force in firing the\r\nfirst shot when he reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death or serious\r\nbodily injury. Under the language requested by Marin, however, a defendant could\r\ncontinue to shoot even if the first shot changed the circumstances to make the use\r\nof deadly force no longer reasonable, so long as the initial danger has not\r\n\"completely ended.\" Thus, according to Marin's requested charge, the jury could\r\n\r\n4 We do not mean to imply Justice Moore made an incorrect statement of law. In\r\nfact, the quote from Rye is not Justice Moore's statement at all, but a portion of the\r\ntrial court's jury charge in that case, from which Justice Moore quoted extensively\r\nin his dissent. Justice Moore did not quote the jury charge to say it was correct, but\r\nto support his argument that it adequately covered the law on the subject of a\r\nproposed charge the trial court refused to give. See 375 S.C. at 134, 651 S.E.2d at\r\n328 (Moore, J., dissenting) (stating \"[i]t was unnecessary for the trial court to use\r\nthe proposed charge when his charge to the jury adequately covered the contents of\r\nthe proposed charge.\").\r\n\ndetermine that the danger almost completely ended after the first shot, and that no\r\nreasonable person would believe it was necessary to continue to shoot; however,\r\nthe jury would nevertheless be required to find the defendant not guilty because a\r\nminimal danger to him remained—that is, the danger had not completely ended.\r\nBecause the requested charge required the State to prove the danger had\r\ncompletely ended before it could defeat self-defense, and thus the charge allowed\r\nthe use of deadly force when it was no longer reasonably necessary to prevent\r\ndeath or serious bodily injury, we question whether the charge contained a correct\r\nstatement of law.\r\n\r\nEven to the extent Marin requested that the trial court give the \"continuing to\r\nshoot\" charge using correct language—that a defendant may continue to shoot as\r\nlong as he reasonably believes it is necessary to use deadly force—we find the trial\r\ncourt did not err in refusing to give the charge.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court used language similar to the charge Marin requested in opinions\r\nin addition to the dissenting opinion in Rye. In Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, 504\r\nS.E.2d 307 (1998), the court quoted the trial court's charge to the jury, \"[I]f the\r\ndefendant was justified in using force and firing the first shot, he is justified in\r\ncontinuing to shoot until it appears that any danger to his life and body has\r\nceased.\" 332 S.C. at 72, 504 S.E.2d at 309. The supreme court approved the\r\ncharge as a proper way to deal with a different issue than the one we face in this\r\ncase.5 In State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 244 S.E.2d 503 (1978), the court faced\r\nthe question of whether the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the\r\ndefendant. 270 S.C. at 654, 244 S.E.2d at 504. In the course of discussing its\r\nholding that self-defense existed as a matter of law, 270 S.C. at 661-62, 244 S.E.2d\r\nat 507, the supreme court stated \"the rule is also that 'when a person is justified in\r\nfiring the first shot, he is justified in continuing to shoot until it is apparent that the\r\ndanger to his life and body has ceased.'\" 270 S.C. at 661, 244 S.E.2d at 507\r\n(quoting 40 C.J.S. Homicide § 131(b) (1944)).\r\n\r\n\r\n5 The issue in Douglas was whether the trial court erred in refusing to charge the\r\njury \"the defendant . . . has the right to use such necessary force as required for his\r\ncomplete protection from loss of life or serious bodily harm and cannot be limited\r\nto the degree or quantity of attacking opposing force.\" Id. The supreme court\r\nfound that the \"continuing to shoot\" language was \"consistent\" with the requested\r\ncharge and thus \"the trial court's refusal to give Douglas's requested charge was not\r\nerror.\" 332 S.C. at 73, 504 S.E.2d at 310.\r\n\nFrom Douglas, we may infer that it is permissible for a trial court to instruct the\r\njury that a defendant may continue to shoot as long as he reasonably believes it is\r\nnecessary to continue to use deadly force. However, neither Rye, Douglas, nor\r\nHendrix answers the question before us in this case—whether the trial court was\r\nrequired to charge this point to the jury.\r\n\r\nMarin's request to charge derives from the correct principle of law that, if no other\r\nelement has been disproven, any particular act of deadly force done in self-defense\r\nis justified if the act was reasonably necessary to prevent death or serious bodily\r\ninjury, under the circumstances as they existed at the time of the act. See State v.\r\nDickey, 394 S.C. 491, 499, 716 S.E.2d 97, 101 (2011) (stating one \"is justified in\r\nusing deadly force in self-defense when . . . a reasonab[ly] prudent man of ordinary\r\nfirmness and courage would have entertained the same belief\"); see also S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-11-440(C) (Supp. 2012) (codifying the right to use deadly force under\r\ncertain circumstances if one \"reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death or\r\ngreat bodily injury\"). Considered as a whole, the trial court's charge explained this\r\nprinciple of law. Therefore, we find there is no error, even though the trial court\r\ndid not charge the \"continuing to shoot\" language Marin requested. See Brandt,\r\n393 S.C. at 549, 713 S.E.2d at 603 (\"The substance of the law is what must be\r\ncharged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.\" (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court charged the jury:\r\n\r\n             Th[e] law recognizes the right of every person to protect\r\n             himself or herself . . . from intruders and attackers and\r\n             from death or sustaining great bodily injury while in his\r\n             home, business, or vehicle. And to do this a person may\r\n             use such force as is reasonably necessary even to the\r\n             point of taking human life if such is reasonable to prevent\r\n             death or great bodily injury to himself or to another\r\n             person.\r\n\r\nThis excerpt from the trial court's charge includes the legal principle underlying\r\nMarin's request—in its correct formulation—that a person may use deadly force\r\nwhen it is reasonably necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury. Under\r\nthis correct formulation, a person who is justified in firing a first shot may lawfully\r\nshoot again if the second shot is reasonably necessary under the circumstances as\r\nthey exist at the time of the second shot. Under the specific language of the trial\r\n\ncourt's charge in this case, Marin \"may use such force as is reasonably necessary\r\n[i.e., fire the second shot] . . . if such is reasonable to prevent death or great bodily\r\ninjury.\"\r\n\r\nThe role of the trial court is to charge the jury correctly based on the evidence\r\npresented at trial. Brandt, 393 S.C. at 549, 713 S.E.2d at 603. The lawyers bear\r\nthe responsibility to argue how a point of law affects the jury's interpretation of the\r\nevidence. When Marin made his request for the charge, quoting Rye, the trial court\r\nstated, \"And that was an instruction? That sounds like a comment on the facts to\r\nme.\" It then stated, \"Well, I certainly think that is proper argument.\" The trial\r\ncourt correctly observed it was the task of Marin's trial counsel to argue that the\r\nsecond shot was reasonably necessary under the circumstances, either because the\r\ninitial danger of Marin losing control of the car persisted, or for some other reason.\r\nThe charge the trial court gave enabled that argument by informing the jury that \"a\r\nperson may use such force as is reasonably necessary even to the point of taking\r\nhuman life if such is reasonable to prevent death or great bodily injury.\" We find\r\nthe trial court's refusal to charge the \"continuing to shoot\" language requested by\r\nMarin was not error.\r\n\r\nMarin argues, however, that this case is controlled by the supreme court's decision\r\nin State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 377 S.E.2d 328 (1989), in which the supreme court\r\n\"instruct[ed] the trial court to consider the facts and circumstances of the case at\r\nbar in order to fashion an appropriate [self-defense] charge.\" 297 S.C. at 443, 377\r\nS.E.2d at 330. Fuller argued on appeal the trial court erred in refusing to give three\r\ncharges he requested: (1) \"a defendant . . . has the right to act on appearances,\" 297\r\nS.C. at 443, 377 S.E.2d at 331; (2) \"words accompanied by hostile acts, may,\r\ndepending on the circumstances, establish a plea of self-defense,\" 297 S.C. at 444,\r\n377 S.E.2d at 331 (quotation marks omitted); and (3) \"an individual ha[s] no duty\r\nto retreat if by doing so he would increase his danger of being killed or suffering\r\nserious bodily injury.\" Id. The supreme court began its analysis by stating that the\r\ntrial court correctly charged the elements of self-defense by taking \"language . . .\r\ndirectly from the Davis case.\" 297 S.C. at 443, 377 S.E.2d at 330. As to each of\r\nthe three charges requested, however, the supreme court found the request\r\ncontained a substantive principle of law the supreme court had previously\r\napproved, which was not contained in the charge the trial court gave, and that facts\r\n\nin the record supported the charge.6 On this basis, the supreme court reversed. 297\r\nS.C. at 445, 377 S.E.2d at 331.\r\n\r\nWe find this case distinguishable from Fuller because the trial court here covered\r\nin its charge the substantive principle of law Marin requested—that a person may\r\nuse deadly force when he reasonably believes it is necessary to do so under the\r\ncircumstances. The trial court having correctly and adequately charged the jury, it\r\nwas the trial lawyer's responsibility to argue how the principle of law affected the\r\nfacts of the case.\r\n\r\n      III.   Immunity Under Subsection 16-11-450(A)\r\n\r\nMarin also argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the immunity from\r\nprosecution provision contained in South Carolina Code subsection 16-11-450(A).\r\nWe find the trial court correctly refused to charge this subsection because it does\r\nnot contain any substantive provisions of law. Rather, it is a procedural subsection\r\nunder which the circuit court may grant immunity from prosecution before a trial\r\nbegins if the court finds the defendant acted lawfully in self-defense. See id.\r\n(providing \"[a] person who uses deadly force as permitted by the provisions of this\r\narticle or another applicable provision of law is justified in using deadly force and\r\n\r\n6 As to the \"act on appearances\" charge, the court stated it \"articulated\" that rule in\r\nState v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271, 277, 87 S.E.2d 681, 684-85 (1955), and it cited\r\nState v. Rivers, 186 S.C. 221, 229, 196 S.E. 6, 10 (1938). Fuller, 297 S.C. at 443-\r\n44, 377 S.E.2d at 331. The court stated Fuller was \"entitled\" to the charge\r\n\"because he testified that he saw [the victims] open the trunk of their car and also\r\nthought he saw a shiny object in [one victim]'s hand.\" 297 S.C. at 444, 377 S.E.2d\r\nat 331. As to the \"words accompanied by hostile acts\" charge, the court cited as\r\nauthority for the charge State v. Harvey, 220 S.C. 506, 518, 68 S.E.2d 409, 414\r\n(1951), and State v. Mason, 115 S.C. 214, 216, 105 S.E. 286, 287 (1920). Fuller,\r\n297 S.C. at 444, 377 S.E.2d at 331. The court stated Fuller was \"entitled\" to the\r\ncharge because one victim \"stated 'he was going to take care' of Fuller\" and both\r\nvictims threatened him with a racial slur. Id. As to the \"no duty to retreat\" charge,\r\nthe court stated it had \"approved such a charge in State v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271,\r\n87 S.E. (2d) 681 (1955) and State v. Hardin, 114 S.C. 280, 103 S.E. 557 (1920).\"\r\nFuller, 297 S.C. at 444, 377 S.E.2d at 331. The court explained the charge was\r\nrequired because the victims \"rammed Fuller's car door when he tried to leave his\r\ncar\" and \"Fuller . . . testified that he did not believe it was safe to leave his car and\r\nrun from the scene.\" Id.\r\n\nis immune from criminal prosecution and civil action\"); see also State v. Duncan,\r\n392 S.C. 404, 410, 709 S.E.2d 662, 665 (2011) (stating subsection 16-11-450(A)\r\nwas not intended as an affirmative defense but rather as a procedure for\r\ndetermining immunity prior to trial).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court fully charged self-defense—the substantive point of law\r\nupon which subsection 16-11-450(A) depends. Subsection 16-11-450(A) is a\r\nprocedural provision that is not relevant to the work of a jury. In fact, if a\r\ndefendant is entitled to the relief set forth in the subsection, the defendant is\r\n\"shielded from trial\" and no jury will ever hear the case. 392 S.C. at 410, 709\r\nS.E.2d at 665. Thus, the trial court correctly refused the requested charge.\r\n\r\n      IV.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err in refusing to give Marin's requested jury instructions,\r\nand Marin's conviction for murder is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5157","title":"State v.

Catoe, both of Columbia,\r\n            for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.: Lexie Dial, III appeals his conviction of homicide by child abuse.\r\nDial argues the trial court committed reversible error by: (1) ruling officer Henry\r\nDukes had arrest authority as a United States Marshal under section 23-1-220 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (2007), or in the alternative, as a citizen pursuant to\r\nsection 17-13-10 of the South Carolina Code (2003); (2) refusing to allow Dial to\r\nimpeach the State's lead investigator; (3) denying his motion for a mistrial after\r\n\nVictim's mother brought an urn to the witness stand; (4) admitting autopsy\r\nphotographs into evidence; (5) refusing to admit the pathologist's conflicting death\r\ncertificates; and (6) sentencing him to the maximum sentence permitted under\r\nSouth Carolina law without properly considering the aggravating and mitigating\r\ncircumstances. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn January 10, 2010, Dial was at his home in Lexington County with his five-\r\nmonth-old son (Victim) when Victim sustained severe head injuries. Victim began\r\nsuffering breathing problems and Dial tried CPR, which was unsuccessful. Dial\r\nthen called his father, who came to the home and attempted CPR as well. All CPR\r\nattempts failed, and emergency personnel responded after Dial's father made a 911\r\ncall. At the scene, Dial claimed he fell while holding Victim, and when he fell,\r\nVictim's head hit a coffee table that was in the room.\r\n\r\nVictim was initially transported to Lexington Medical Center but was transferred\r\nto Richland Memorial Hospital1 in Richland County. Early the next afternoon,\r\nVictim passed away. Lexington County major crimes investigator Eric Russell\r\nwas placed in charge of investigating Victim's death. Russell spoke with Victim's\r\ndoctors and based on their diagnoses and explanations, he asked Officer Luis\r\nRivera to obtain a warrant for Dial for great bodily injury to a child. The first\r\nwarrant was issued prior to Victim's death, but once Victim passed away, it was\r\nwithdrawn. A new warrant for homicide by child abuse was issued against Dial.\r\nOfficer Dukes, a Lexington County officer with the U.S. Marshal's fugitive task\r\nforce, arrested Dial at Richland Memorial.\r\n\r\nRussell questioned Dial at the Lexington County Detention Center and obtained a\r\nstatement from him. Dial first stated he was carrying Victim when he tripped over\r\na steam cleaner in the living room and fell through a coffee table. Dial said that\r\nafter the fall, Victim was gasping for breath so he shook Victim in a manner that\r\nwould not have caused injury. Russell explained to Dial that he had spoken with\r\nthe doctors, and Dial's version of the events did not match their description of\r\nVictim's symptoms and injuries. Dial then admitted to Russell in a second\r\nstatement he had been frustrated at the Victim for failing to walk so he shook\r\n\r\n1Richland Memorial Hospital is now known as Palmetto Health Richland.\r\nWitnesses referred to it by different names throughout the record.\r\n\nVictim. At trial, Russell stated he never mentioned anything about shaken baby\r\nsyndrome to Dial. Dial claimed at trial he made the second statement out of fear\r\nand after being told cooperation would help him.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Dr. Shuler, with Lexington Medical Center, testified he was given a\r\nhistory stating Victim was dropped on a coffee table, and Victim's bilateral\r\nbleeding and subdural hematoma could have been caused by a drop on a coffee\r\ntable. Further, Dr. Shuler stated the small 2-3 inch bruise found on the back of\r\nVictim's head could have been caused by Victim's head striking an object. Dr.\r\nSarah Webb-Wood, a pediatric resident at Richland Memorial, stated Victim was\r\nbrain dead when she saw him, and she ordered a skeletal survey to determine\r\nwhether prior injuries existed. She found a large amount of blood in Victim's eye\r\narea and bleeding on both sides of his brain. Dr. Susan Luberoff, a pediatrician,\r\nwas called in to assist Dr. Webb-Wood with Victim. Dr. Luberoff stated Victim\r\nhad non-accidental blunt force trauma, with extensive retinal hemorrhaging. She\r\ndid not believe the injuries could have been accidentally caused, but conceded the\r\npathologist was best suited to determine the cause of death. Dr. Edward\r\nCheeseman, an ophthalmologist, also examined Victim. He found numerous\r\nhemorrhages in Victim's eyes and found he suffered from retinaschisis, which\r\ncould be caused by a back and forth acceleration or a fall, although falls are usually\r\naccompanied by crushing type injuries of the skull. Dr. Cheeseman opined it was\r\nunlikely Victim hit his head on a table because there were no crushing skull\r\ninjuries. His diagnosis was shaken-baby syndrome. Dr. Greta Harper, a pediatric\r\ncritical care specialist, also opined Victim died from shaken-baby syndrome.\r\n\r\nDr. Janice Ross, a forensic pathologist, testified she found subdural and\r\nsubarachnoid hemorrhaging.2 She determined Victim's death was a homicide\r\ncaused by subdural hemorrhaging due to blunt force trauma to the head but initially\r\nwrote on Victim's death certificate that Victim died from hitting his head on an\r\nobject or surface. Thereafter, she edited the death certificate to omit the language\r\nregarding Victim hitting his head on an object because there was an ongoing\r\ninvestigation and she did not want to narrow the possibilities for the cause of death.\r\nDr. Ross conceded she could not rule out more than one injury as leading to\r\nVictim's death.\r\n\r\n\r\n2The arachnoid is a thin membrane covering the surface of the brain. The bleeding\r\nwas subarachnoid, underneath the arachnoid but on top of the brain's surface.\r\n\nThe jury found Dial guilty of homicide by child abuse. The trial court sentenced\r\nDial to life imprisonment, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"'In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. We are\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.'\" State\r\nv. Bonner, 400 S.C. 561, 564, 735 S.E.2d 525, 526 (Ct. App. 2012) (quoting State\r\nv. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nArrest Authority\r\n\r\nDial first argues Dukes was a Lexington County Sheriff's officer with no authority\r\nor jurisdiction to arrest in Richland County. Thus, Dial contends his arrest was\r\nunlawful. We disagree.\r\n\r\nPrior to Dukes's testimony at trial, Dial made a motion to dismiss his charge\r\nbecause Dukes lacked authority to arrest him. As alternate relief, Dial requested\r\nexclusion of any evidence obtained subsequent to the arrest as being the fruit of the\r\npoisonous tree. In response, the State presented a Memorandum of Understanding\r\n(MOU) between the Lexington County Sheriff's Office and the United States\r\nMarshals Service. The trial court denied Dial's motion, finding the MOU and the\r\nwarrant were valid and therefore the arrest was valid. In the alternative, it found\r\nunder State v. Swilling, 249 S.C. 541, 155 S.E.2d 607 (1967), and pursuant to\r\nsection 17-13-10, Dukes made a valid citizen's arrest, because the arrest was made\r\nupon certain information that a felony had been committed. During Dukes's\r\ntestimony, Dial objected to his statement to Russell being placed into evidence,\r\nagain arguing his arrest was unlawful. The trial court overruled the objection.\r\n\r\nWhile Dial argues in his Statement of Issues the trial court erred in determining\r\nDukes's authority arose from section 23-1-220, in the body of his argument he\r\nasserts the trial court erred in ruling that Dukes's authority arose from section 23-1-\r\n212 of the South Carolina Code (2007 & Supp. 2012). Despite this discrepancy in\r\nstatutes, Dial is inaccurate in his assertions that the trial court determined Dukes\r\nhad authority pursuant to section 23-1-212 or section 23-1-220. After the State and\r\n\nDial presented their arguments on the issue, the trial court ultimately found the\r\nagreement between Lexington County and the U.S. Marshals was valid because\r\nthere was no testimony otherwise, and the warrant was valid. It ruled that as a\r\nresult, Dukes had authority to arrest Dial in Richland County. It did not specify\r\nany statutory authority in its final decision, and neither party requested clarification\r\nregarding the statutory authority upon which the trial court based its decision.\r\n\r\nThe MOU stated the Lexington County Sheriff's Office entered into an agreement\r\nwith the U.S. Marshals pursuant to the Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000.\r\n28 U.S.C. § 566 (2006 & Supp. 2012). The MOU's primary purpose was to create\r\na task force that would \"investigate and arrest, as part of joint law enforcement\r\noperations, persons who have active state and federal warrants for their arrest.\"\r\nFurther, the MOU explained \"[t]he authority of the United States Marshals and\r\nDeputy U.S. Marshals to, 'in executing the laws of the United States within a State\r\n. . . exercise the same powers which a sheriff of the State may exercise in executing\r\nthe laws thereof' is set forth in 28 USC § 564.\"\r\n\r\nWe find the MOU was valid pursuant to its cited federal authority. Because the\r\nMOU recites that U.S. Marshals and their deputies have \"the same powers which a\r\nsheriff of the State may exercise in executing the laws thereof,\" Dukes, as a\r\nspecially deputized member of the task force, had the same arrest authority as the\r\nRichland County Sheriff. A sheriff may arrest someone within his county pursuant\r\nto an arrest warrant, and, therefore, Dukes had authority under the MOU and § 564\r\nto arrest Dial in Richland County. Consequently, we find the arrest was lawful,\r\nand we affirm the trial court. Because we affirm the trial court on the first\r\nindependent ground, we need not reach the argument regarding a citizen's arrest.\r\nSee Henry v. Lewis, 327 S.C. 336, 340 n.1, 489 S.E.2d 639, 641 n.1 (Ct. App.\r\n1997) (stating that because the appellate court affirmed the circuit court on one\r\nindependent ground, it need not reach the alternative ground).\r\n\r\nCross-Examination Regarding Bias\r\n\r\nDial argues the trial court erred in not allowing cross-examination of Russell\r\nregarding Russell's romantic relationship with the assistant solicitor initially\r\nassigned to the case. Specifically, he contends the State did not show the cross-\r\nexamination was clearly improper pursuant to Rule 608(c), SCRE, and thus, he\r\nshould have been permitted to cross-examine Russell pursuant to Rules 401 and\r\n\n403, SCRE, because Russell's bias and motive to lie were relevant issues in the\r\ntrial.3 We disagree.\r\n\r\nDial requested to cross-examine Russell regarding his romantic relationship with\r\nthe assistant solicitor who was initially assigned to prosecute the case. In October\r\nof 2010, Russell and his then-wife separated due to the discovery that Russell was\r\nconducting a romantic relationship with the assistant solicitor. The solicitor's\r\noffice withdrew from the case and the South Carolina Attorney General's Office\r\ntook it over due to the potential conflict of interest arising from the relationship\r\nbetween the assistant solicitor and Russell. Dial argued the cross-examination was\r\nadmissible to show Russell's personal bias and to question his credibility. The\r\nState argued the connection between Russell's relationship with the assistant\r\nsolicitor and Russell's conduct during Dial's questioning was too tenuous,\r\nregardless of the time period. The trial court ruled that pursuant to Rule 608(c), the\r\ncross-examination was not allowed, and it also found the cross-examination was\r\nnot relevant to the case.\r\n\r\n\"'As a general rule, a trial court's ruling on the proper scope of cross-examination\r\nwill not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of discretion.'\" State v. Quattlebaum,\r\n338 S.C. 441, 450, 527 S.E.2d 105, 109 (2000) (quoting State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C.\r\n189, 196, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1998)). \"Rule 608(c), SCRE, provides that 'bias,\r\nprejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness\r\neither by examination of the witness or by evidence otherwise adduced.'\" State v.\r\nSims, 348 S.C. 16, 25, 558 S.E.2d 518, 523 (2002) (quoting State v. Jones, 343\r\nS.C. 562, 570, 541 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2001)). \"Rule 608(c) 'preserves South\r\nCarolina precedent holding that generally, anything having a legitimate tendency to\r\nthrow light on the accuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity of a witness may be shown\r\nand considered in determining the credit to be accorded his testimony.'\" Id.\r\n(quoting Jones, 343 S.C. at 570, 541 S.E.2d at 817).\r\n\r\nHere, the timeline of Russell's and the assistant solicitor's romantic relationship\r\nwas not definitively established. Russell claimed the relationship did not occur\r\nuntil October 2010, ten months after he took Dial's confession, and denied there\r\nwas any romantic relationship at the time of Dial's investigation. See State v.\r\nBeckham, 334 S.C. 302, 321, 513 S.E.2d 606, 615 (1999) (stating \"[w]hen a\r\n\r\n3 Dial did not raise any constitutional argument at trial or on appeal regarding his\r\nright to confrontation.\r\n\nwitness denies an act involving a matter collateral to the case in chief, the inquiring\r\nparty is not permitted to introduce contradictory evidence to impeach the witness\").\r\nFurther, the solicitor's office removed the assistant solicitor from the case when the\r\nimproper relationship was discovered, and the Attorney General took over the case.\r\nThe assistant solicitor had no involvement with the prosecution at the time of trial.\r\nWe find the connection between the romantic relationship and Russell's bias\r\nmerely speculative, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the\r\ncross-examination. Accordingly, we affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotion for Mistrial\r\n\r\nDial argues the trial court committed reversible error by denying his motion for a\r\nmistrial after Misti Richard, Victim's mother, approached the witness stand with an\r\nurn in her hands containing Victim's ashes. Dial contends Richard's actions caused\r\nsevere prejudice to him and only served to sway the emotions of the jury. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\"The decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt.\" State v. Wiley, 387 S.C. 490, 495, 692 S.E.2d 560, 563 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\"The trial court's decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion amounting to an error of law.\" Id. \"The power of the trial court to\r\ndeclare a mistrial should be used with the greatest caution under urgent\r\ncircumstances and for very plain and obvious reasons stated on the record by the\r\ntrial court.\" Id. \"A mistrial should only be granted when absolutely necessary, and\r\na defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a\r\nmistrial.\" Id. \"The granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure that\r\nshould only be taken if an incident is so grievous that the prejudicial effect can be\r\nremoved in no other way.\" Id. at 495-96, 692 S.E.2d at 563.\r\n\r\nWhen the State called Richard as a witness, she approached the witness stand\r\ncarrying a bronze, heart-shaped urn containing Victim's ashes. The trial court\r\nimmediately prevented her from advancing any further and asked the jury to leave\r\nthe courtroom. The jury was removed, and Dial requested a mistrial based on the\r\nextremely prejudicial nature of the urn in eyesight of the jury. Dial argued the\r\naction was a ploy to sway the jurors to convict him out of emotion and sympathy.\r\n\nThe trial court noted Richard approached the witness stand in a \"very low-grade\r\nmanner,\" and it did not believe any of the jury members saw the urn or knew it was\r\nan urn. The trial court measured the urn and found it was slightly less than three\r\ninches in width and about two-and-a-half inches in length. The trial court denied\r\nDial's motion given the small size of the item, the manner in which Richards\r\napproached the witness stand, and the fact that the trial court had the best view of\r\nthe item and still did not know it was an urn. Dial again requested a mistrial\r\nbecause the urn was shaped like a heart, and the jurors were likely to figure out it\r\nwas an urn. The trial court also denied that motion, stating it did not think the jury\r\nsaw the item, and offered to give a curative instruction. Dial suggested language\r\nfor the curative instruction, but the trial court declined to use it and issued a\r\ngeneral instruction to the jury. Dial noted for the record that he preferred the more\r\nspecific instruction.\r\n\r\nA curative instruction is generally deemed to have cured any alleged error. State v.\r\nWalker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005). Here, the trial\r\ncourt issued the following instruction to the jury:\r\n\r\n             Again, I would advise you that you may not allow\r\n             yourself to be governed by sympathy, prejudice, passion,\r\n             public opinion, emotions, any improper conduct or any\r\n             other arbitrary factors.\r\n\r\n             Both the State and the Defendant have a right to expect\r\n             that each of you will carefully and impartially consider\r\n             all of the evidence in the case and that you will follow\r\n             the law as I instruct it to you.\r\n\r\n             The State has the burden of proving its case beyond a\r\n             reasonable doubt. The Defendant is presumed to be\r\n             innocent. He does not have to prove his innocence. He\r\n             does not have to present evidence or testimony in any\r\n             manner.\r\n\r\n             He is entitled under the Constitution of our State and\r\n             United States Constitution to a fair and impartial trial,\r\n             based on the law and evidence from the witnesses\r\n\n             testifying under oath, and any inferences that you may\r\n             properly draw from that evidence.\r\n\r\nWe believe any alleged error or prejudice was cured by the curative instruction.\r\nDial could not establish that any juror saw the item in Richard's hands. Moreover,\r\nhe could not show the item would be recognizable as Victim's urn if in fact a juror\r\ndid see it. The trial court noted Richard approached the witness stand in a normal\r\nmanner without attracting attention to the item, and the trial court, which had the\r\nbest view of the urn, was not aware of the exact nature of the item when it excused\r\nthe jury. Further, the thorough curative instruction ensured the jurors knew they\r\nwere to base any decision on the facts presented at trial, not on emotional response\r\nor improper conduct. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's denial of Dial's\r\nmotion for a mistrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAutopsy Photographs\r\n\r\nDial argues the trial court erred in admitting autopsy photographs into evidence.\r\nHe maintains that pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, State's Exhibits 7, 8, and 86 were\r\nmuch more prejudicial than probative due to their gory and shocking nature. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nDuring Dr. Ross's testimony, the trial court admitted three autopsy photographs of\r\nVictim's head injuries over Dial's objection that the photographs were shocking\r\nand gross. The trial court ruled the photographs would assist Dr. Ross in showing\r\nthe force or violence in which Victim's injuries occurred.\r\n\r\nDr. Ross testified in camera that she regularly took pictures as part of performing\r\nautopsies. She stated it aided her testimony to be able to show the photographs she\r\ntook of Victim. State's Exhibit 86 depicted Victim's scalp area, with the skin over\r\nthe scalp folded back to reveal Victim's skull and brain. Dr. Ross stated it was\r\nimportant to examine this inside fold of skin to identify a possible pattern of injury,\r\nincluding blunt force injuries. In Victim's case, there was no contusion or bruising,\r\nand she was able to definitively conclude there was no bruising on the back of the\r\nhead. State's Exhibit 8 depicted the top of the brain with a subarachnoid\r\nhemorrhage. The exhibit further showed the surface of the brain was flat which\r\nindicated it was swollen. Dr. Ross testified that the depiction helped identify that\r\n\nthere was enough edema to have swelling of the brain, and that the bleeding would\r\nhave been started by the original trauma. State's Exhibit 7 showed the subdural\r\nspace in the brain after the brain had been removed. It depicted hemorrhaging on\r\nthe right and left sides of the brain. She stated the hemorrhaging pictured typically\r\nresults from the brain being jostled around and from pulling on the veins\r\nsurrounding the brain's surface. She testified the bleeding was caused by the\r\noriginal trauma that led to Victim's death, and the photographs would be helpful in\r\nexplaining the injury to the jury. The trial court conducted a Rule 403 analysis and\r\nfound the three contested exhibits corroborated Dr. Ross's testimony and supported\r\nher conclusive findings, and thus, it found they were admissible.\r\n\r\n\"The State has the right to prove every element of the crime charged . . . .\" State v.\r\nMartucci, 380 S.C. 232, 249, 669 S.E.2d 598, 607 (Ct. App. 2008) (citing State v.\r\nJohnson, 338 S.C. 114, 122, 525 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2000)). \"'The relevance,\r\nmateriality, and admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of\r\nan abuse of discretion.'\" Id. (quoting State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 199, 577\r\nS.E.2d 445, 450 (2003); State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588,\r\n589-90 (1999)); see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 177, 460 S.E.2d 368, 370\r\n(1995) (stating the trial court has \"considerable latitude in ruling on admissibility\r\nof evidence and his rulings will not be disturbed absent showing of probable\r\nprejudice\"). \"'The trial judge must balance the prejudicial effect of graphic\r\nphotographs against their probative value.'\" Martucci, 380 S.C. at 249, 669 S.E.2d\r\nat 607 (quoting State v. Vang, 353 S.C. 78, 87, 577 S.E.2d 225, 229 (Ct. App.\r\n2003)). \"A trial judge's decision regarding the comparative probative value and\r\nprejudicial effect of relevant evidence should be reversed only in exceptional\r\ncircumstances.\" Id. at 250, 669 S.E.2d at 607 (citing State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C.\r\n344, 357, 543 S.E.2d 586, 593 (Ct. App. 2001)). \"Admitting photographs which\r\nserve to corroborate testimony is not an abuse of discretion.\" Id. (citing Rosemond,\r\n335 S.C. at 597, 518 S.E.2d at 590). \"However, photographs calculated to arouse\r\nthe sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are irrelevant or\r\nnot necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.\" Id. (citing State v.\r\nBrazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997)). \"'To constitute unfair\r\nprejudice, the photographs must create a tendency to suggest a decision on an\r\nimproper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.'\" Id.\r\n(quoting Kelley, 319 S.C. at 178, 460 S.E.2d at 370-71). \"A trial judge is not\r\nrequired to exclude relevant evidence merely because it is unpleasant or offensive.\"\r\n\nId. (citing Davis v. Traylor, 340 S.C. 150, 155, 530 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App.\r\n2000)).\r\n\r\nDial claimed he tripped and fell with the Victim in his arms, and thus, Victim's\r\ninjuries were accidental. These photographs were introduced to corroborate the\r\ntestimony of Dr. Ross, who testified regarding the Victim's various injuries,\r\nincluding the placement and severity of bruising, which would be inconsistent with\r\nan accidental injury. She testified the photographs would aid in her testimony. We\r\nfind the photographs were highly probative to the issues of whether Victim was\r\nabused and whether the abuse was the cause of his death, which are integral\r\nelements to the charge of homicide by child abuse. See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-\r\n85(A)(1) (2003). Thus, we find the danger of unfair prejudice did not outweigh the\r\nphotographs' probative value, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\r\nadmitting them. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\nAdmission of Death Certificates\r\n\r\nDial argues the trial court erred in excluding copies of Dr. Ross's death certificate\r\nreports. He maintains the conflicting death certificates authored by the same\r\ndoctor were relevant and should have been admitted pursuant to Rules 401 and\r\n403, SCRE.\r\n\r\nDial attempted to place Victim's death certificates authored by Dr. Ross into\r\nevidence, because her initial determination supported his theory that Victim's\r\ninjuries were sustained by a fall onto the coffee table. The trial court refused Dial's\r\nrequest, stating the evidence would unduly highlight the apparent change in Dr.\r\nRoss's opinion. Dr. Ross testified she initially described the injury on the death\r\ncertificate as one where the Victim's head hit an object. She subsequently changed\r\nthe description because there was an ongoing investigation, and she realized the\r\ninjuries were such that the head could have been hit by something or could have hit\r\nan object. She removed any language from that section of the death certificate and\r\nleft it blank. She admitted she spoke with the coroner after she removed the\r\nlanguage.4\r\n\r\n\r\n4Dial asserts Dr. Ross spoke with the coroner after she completed the first death\r\ncertificate and then decided to remove the description. However, Dr. Ross testified\r\nshe spoke with the coroner only after she altered the death certificate.\r\n\nWhile it may be argued the trial court erred in refusing to admit the death\r\ncertificates into the record, we find the error, if any, was harmless. See State v.\r\nMcLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 82, 606 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"Error is harmless\r\nwhere it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. Generally,\r\nappellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not\r\naffecting the result.\" (citations omitted)). The first document merely had a\r\ndescription stating, \"head hit object,\" while the second document did not contain\r\nany description and had a blank space. Dr. Ross testified to the exact changes\r\nmade to the two documents, and she thoroughly explained the reason for the\r\nchange. Moreover, Dial had the opportunity to fully cross-examine Dr. Ross about\r\nthe death certificates and any changes made to them. We do not believe the\r\nadmission of the documents would have affected the outcome of the trial.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\nSentencing\r\n\r\nDial contends the trial court committed reversible error in sentencing him to the\r\nmaximum sentence permitted under section 16-3-85(D) because he maintains the\r\ntrial court did not properly consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\r\nHe maintains the record clearly demonstrates there were no aggravating\r\ncircumstances in his past history with Victim or any other child under the age of\r\neleven, and the trial court did not accord any weight to the mitigating factors he\r\npresented at trial.5 We find this issue was not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\nThe State argues Dial did not preserve this argument for our review because he did\r\nnot raise it at the trial. See State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423,\r\n425 (1999) (\"[T]his [c]ourt has consistently held that a challenge to sentencing\r\nmust be raised at trial, or the issue will not be preserved for appellate review.\")\r\nWe agree. The record reflects Dial did not raise an objection during or after\r\nsentencing. See State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 276, 498 S.E.2d 655, 669 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998) (finding that to preserve any alleged error in sentencing, a party must\r\nmake a contemporaneous objection). Accordingly, we find this issue was not\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Despite Dial's contention, the trial court did discuss and weigh aggravating and\r\nmitigating factors before sentencing Dial.\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Dial's conviction is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I agree with the majority's decision to affirm. I also\r\nagree with most of the majority's analysis. However, as to the denial of the mistrial\r\nmotion and the exclusion of the death certificates, I would find the trial court\r\ncommitted no error. With no error, further analysis of those issues is not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5159","title":"State v.

Henkel contends\r\nthe South Carolina Highway Patrol (SCHP) failed to comply with section 56-5-\r\n2953 of the South Carolina Code (2006), which requires the arresting officer to\r\nprovide videotaping of the defendant's conduct at the incident site. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAround 1:00 a.m. on January 19, 2008, Lillie Chastain called 911 and reported a\r\nmotorist driving a truck erratically on I-385 in Greenville County. Chastain\r\nfollowed the truck until it hit a bridge and overturned into a ditch. She observed\r\nthe driver get out of the truck and jump over a fence. Sergeant Wesley Hiott of the\r\nSCHP arrived on the scene and organized a search for the driver. Officers were\r\nunable to locate the driver, and the scene was cleared.\r\n\r\nAround 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., Sergeant Hiott responded to a call indicating the\r\npossible driver of the truck had been located on I-385. When he arrived on the\r\nscene, Sergeant Hiott pulled his patrol car to the front of the line of emergency\r\nvehicles on the side of the interstate. Thereafter, Sergeant Hiott found Henkel\r\nbeing examined by EMS in an ambulance behind his patrol car. Sergeant Hiott got\r\ninto the ambulance with Henkel and could smell alcohol. Sergeant Hiott read\r\nHenkel his Miranda rights and performed a horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test\r\ninside the ambulance. After performing the HGN test, Sergeant Hiott concluded\r\nHenkel was under the influence and moved him from inside the ambulance to the\r\nside of his patrol car. There, Sergeant Hiott had Henkel recite his ABCs.1 Henkel\r\nfailed the ABC test and admitted to Sergeant Hiott he was the driver of the\r\nwrecked truck. Henkel was arrested and placed in Sergeant Hiott's patrol car.\r\nOnce inside the patrol car, Sergeant Hiott turned the dashboard video camera to\r\nface Henkel and read him his Miranda rights again.\r\n\r\nHenkel was indicted for DUI and a trial was held in February 2011. Prior to trial,\r\nHenkel moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that neither the field\r\nsobriety tests nor the initial Miranda warning were videotaped as required by\r\nsection 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code. The trial court reserved ruling on\r\nthe motion until all of the testimony was presented.\r\n\r\nSergeant Hiott testified he activated the patrol car's video camera and his\r\nmicrophone by the remote control on his belt. The record indicates this occurred\r\nafter Sergeant Hiott read Henkel his Miranda rights in the ambulance but before he\r\nadministered the HGN test. Sergeant Hiott testified he activated the camera as\r\nsoon as it was practicable. Two versions of the videotape from the incident site\r\nwere admitted into evidence. In the defense's version (Court's Exhibit 1), the\r\nvideotape includes audio of the HGN and ABC tests but does not include video\r\n                                                            \r\n1Sergeant Hiott did not have Henkel perform any walking or balancing tests\r\nbecause Henkel indicated his leg was injured.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nbecause these tests were not administered in front of Sergeant Hiott's patrol car\r\nwhere the video camera was aimed. The State's version (State's Exhibit 2) of the\r\nvideotape is nearly identical to Court's Exhibit 1 but does not begin until after the\r\nHGN test. Thus, the videotapes in evidence do not include any video or audio of\r\nthe initial Miranda warning, or any video of the HGN or ABC tests.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the testimony, Henkel renewed his motion to dismiss. The\r\ntrial court denied Henkel's motion based on \"the totality . . . [of] the evidence.\"\r\nThe trial court noted Sergeant Hiott testified he activated the video camera as soon\r\nas practicable. The trial court further found the HGN and ABC tests \"don't cry out\r\nfor video representation . . . [t]hey cry out for audio representation on the ABCs.\"\r\nBased on the tests given, the trial court determined the videotape \"met the\r\nrequirements of the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury found Henkel guilty of DUI, and he was sentenced to three years in prison\r\nsuspended upon the service of three months and thirty months of probation. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006) (citing State v. Wilson, 345\r\nS.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)). \"This [c]ourt is bound by the trial court's\r\nfactual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\" Id. (citing State v.\r\nQuattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHenkel argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss his DUI\r\nindictment because the State failed to produce a videotape that complied with\r\nsection 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code. The State contends Sergeant Hiott\r\nactivated the video camera as soon as practicable, and the videotape, while\r\ncapturing only audio of the field sobriety tests, was sufficient to show Henkel's\r\nconduct at the incident site. We reverse the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\nI.    Applicable Law\r\n\r\nSubsection 56-5-2953(A) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n                             (A) A person who violates Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-\r\n                                 2933, or 56-5-2945 must have his conduct at the\r\n                                 incident site and the breath test site videotaped.\r\n\r\n                                    (1) The videotaping at the incident site must:\r\n\r\n                                            (a) begin not later than the activation of the\r\n                                                officer's blue lights and conclude after the\r\n                                                arrest of the person for a violation of Section\r\n                                                56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or a probable cause\r\n                                                determination that the person violated Section\r\n                                                56-5-2945; and\r\n\r\n                                            (b) include the person being advised of his\r\n                                               Miranda rights before any field sobriety tests\r\n                                               are administered, if the tests are administered.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A) (2006).2 Subsection (B) of section 56-5-2953\r\noutlines several statutory exceptions that excuse noncompliance with the\r\nmandatory videotaping requirements. Pursuant to subsection 56-5-2953(B),\r\n\r\n                             [f]ailure by the arresting officer to produce the\r\n                             videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground\r\n                             for dismissal . . . if the arresting officer submits a sworn\r\n                             affidavit certifying that the videotape equipment at the\r\n                             time of the arrest, probable cause determination, or\r\n                             breath test device was in an inoperable condition, stating\r\n                             reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the\r\n                             equipment in an operable condition, and certifying that\r\n                             there was no other operable breath test facility available\r\n                             in the county or, in the alternative, submits a sworn\r\n                             affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to\r\n                             produce the videotape because the person needed\r\n                             emergency medical treatment, or exigent circumstances\r\n                             existed. Further, in circumstances including, but not\r\n                             limited to, road blocks, traffic accident investigations,\r\n                                                            \r\n2Section 56-5-2953 was amended effective February 10, 2009.

Analysis\r\n\r\nSubsection 56-5-2953(A)(1) requires that a person who drives under the influence\r\nmust have his conduct at the incident site videotaped. Under subsection 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(1)(a), the videotaping must \"begin not later than the activation of the\r\nofficer's blue lights.\" Sergeant Hiott testified his patrol car was equipped with\r\nfront and rear blue lights, which could be activated independently of each other,\r\nbut the car's video camera turns on only when the front blue lights are activated.\r\nWhen he arrived at the scene, Sergeant Hiott activated only his rear blue lights.\r\nBecause the event that subsection 56-5-2953(A)(1)(a) sets as the latest point in\r\n\r\n \r\n\ntime when videotaping must begin—activation of the front blue lights that turn on\r\nthe camera—never occurred, the failure to videotape the Miranda warnings did not\r\nviolate subsection 56-5-2953(A)(1).\r\n\r\nSubsection 56-5-2953(B) (2006) provides that \"in circumstances including, but not\r\nlimited to . . . traffic accident investigations, . . . where an arrest has been made and\r\nthe videotaping equipment has not been activated by blue lights, the failure by the\r\narresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is not alone a\r\nground for dismissal.\" The next sentence of subsection (B) qualifies that provision\r\nwith two requirements: \"However, as soon as videotaping is practicable in these\r\ncircumstances, videotaping must begin and conform with the provisions of this\r\nsection.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a case in which the videotaping equipment was not activated by blue lights.\r\nThe trial court made a factual finding that Sergeant Hiott activated his patrol car's\r\nvideo as soon as practicable. There is evidence to support this finding, and under\r\nour standard of review, we are bound by it. However, the requirement in\r\nsubsection 56-5-2953(B) that the videotaping \"conform with the provisions of this\r\nsection\" refers back to subsection (A). Subsection 56-5-2953(A)(1)(b) requires\r\nthat the videotaping at the incident site \"include the person being advised of his\r\nMiranda rights before any field sobriety tests are administered, if the tests are\r\nadministered.\" Sergeant Hiott performed field sobriety tests after he started\r\nvideotaping. Because the videotape did not include him giving Henkel Miranda\r\nwarnings, it did not conform to the provisions of section 56-5-2953. Therefore, the\r\ntrial court was required to dismiss the charge,3 and it erred by not doing so.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., dissenting: For the following reasons, I would affirm\r\nAppellant's conviction for DUI.\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority's analysis that a key determination in this case is whether\r\nthe officer activated his patrol car's video recording equipment as soon as was\r\npracticable, such that the officer's delay in initiating the recording (non-compliance\r\n                                                            \r\n3Because the omission of the Miranda warnings requires dismissal, it is not\r\nnecessary for us to consider the significance of the alleged failure to videotape\r\nHenkel's conduct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nwith subsection 56-5-2953(A)) was excused pursuant to an exception within\r\nsubsection 56-5-2953(B). However, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that\r\nwhen this exception is invoked that an officer must still strictly comply with\r\nsubsection (A). To so construe the exception would effectively eviscerate it. See\r\nState v. Hercheck, Op. No. 27258 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 29, 2013) (Shearouse\r\nAdv. Sh. No. 24 at 46) (\"[E]very word, clause, and sentence must be given some\r\nmeaning, force, and effect, if it can be done by any reasonable construction\"\r\n(citation omitted)). Further, the majority's interpretation disregards the plain\r\nmeaning of subsection (B). In my view of the terms of this provision, when the\r\nexception is properly invoked an officer must, from that point forward, comply\r\nwith all applicable recording requirements. See § 56-5-2953(B) (\"[A]s soon as is\r\npracticable in these circumstances, videotaping must begin and conform with the\r\nprovisions of this section.\" (emphases added)). Accordingly, the initiation of the\r\nvideotaping and conformance must each begin as soon as is practicable. Id. In the\r\ninstant matter, it was not practicable for the officer to capture video evidence of\r\nAppellant receiving his initial Miranda warning or performing the HGN or ABC\r\ntests while Appellant was inside the ambulance.\r\nAdditionally, I believe that a complete recording of events \"at the incident site,\" as\r\nrequired by subsection (A), was excused due to the \"totality of the circumstances\"\r\nexception within subsection (B). See § 56-5-2953(A) (requiring \"videotaping at\r\nthe incident site\"); § 56-5-2953(B) (providing that \"[n]othing in this section\r\nprohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the failure to\r\nproduce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances.\" (emphases\r\nadded)). Notably, this case did not involve a typical DUI investigation and\r\nsubsequent arrest at or near the site of a traffic stop. Instead, this case involved a\r\nreport of an erratic driver, the erratic driver's collision with a bridge and\r\noverturning of his vehicle, and his subsequent fleeing on foot and jumping a fence.\r\nThus, when the officer first encountered the suspect four hours after the accident,\r\ninside of an ambulance, and after the suspect had wandered down the middle of the\r\nhighway back toward the site of the wreck that was cleared hours earlier, the\r\ntotality of these circumstances did not require video recording, at least not as\r\ncontemplated by subsection (A) for a typical DUI stop and investigation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the totality of the circumstances did not require a video recording in\r\nstrict compliance with subsection (A). Here, the produced video recording still\r\nbegan as soon as was practicable and included audio of the HGN and ABC tests.\r\nThus, in light of subsection (B) and the totality of the circumstances, the produced\r\nrecording was sufficient.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5160","title":"State v.

On appeal, he argues the trial court erred in\r\ndenying his motion to suppress evidence discovered during a traffic stop.\r\nSpecifically, he argues his continued detention was unlawful because the State did\r\n\nnot present sufficient evidence to establish the police officer's reasonable and\r\narticulable suspicion of a serious crime. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOfficers Dale Owens and Donnie Gilbert, Corporal Ken Hancock, and K-9 handler\r\nDeputy Jason Carraway, all with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office, were\r\nobserving traffic along the I-85 corridor in Spartanburg County the evening of June\r\n30, 2010. Around 1:10 a.m., Officer Owens observed Moore traveling at a rate\r\nabove the posted speed limit of 60 miles per hour. Officer Owens began pacing\r\nMoore's vehicle1 and determined Moore was keeping a steady speed of 70 miles\r\nper hour. Further, Moore failed to maintain his lane and crossed into the center\r\nlane from the far right-hand lane. Officer Owens initiated his blue lights, and\r\nMoore first activated his left turn signal, then his right turn signal. Officer Owens,\r\nfound those actions were an indicator that Moore might be preparing to flee.\r\nOfficer Owens testified Moore also took longer than the average time to stop and\r\nthat is consistent with people who have tried to run from him in the past. After\r\nstopping his vehicle, Moore failed to release his left turn signal, and Officer Owens\r\nopined this failure indicated Moore's heart rate might be so accelerated he had\r\ntemporarily lost his hearing capability.\r\n\r\nWhen Officer Owens approached Moore's vehicle, Moore was talking on a cell\r\nphone, and Officer Owens requested Moore end the call. Officer Owens opined\r\nthe average person would end a phone a call when an officer approached their\r\nvehicle. He added that drug traffickers may stay on the phone to report to a\r\nsuperior who needs to hear what is happening during the stop. An alcohol odor\r\nemanated from Moore's vehicle, and Moore admitted to having a couple of drinks.\r\nOfficer Owens had worked on several cases in which drug traffickers were\r\ndrinking alcohol, and he maintained the alcohol calmed their nerves. Moore\r\nfurther informed Officer Owens the vehicle was a rental and provided the rental\r\nagreement along with his driver's license. Officer Owens observed Moore's hand\r\nshaking heavily, which Officer Owens opined was a measurement of Moore's\r\nnervousness. Also during that time, Officer Owens observed Moore's carotid\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pacing is a method of measuring the speed of another vehicle. The officer\r\nmaintains the same distance and speed behind the other vehicle for a period of\r\ntime, and judging from the certified speedometer in the officer's car, the officer\r\ndetermines the other vehicle's speed.\r\n\nartery and his breathing, and consequently stated he discerned Moore's pulse and\r\nbreathing were accelerated, indicating nervousness.\r\n\r\nMoore picked up his cell phone as he obeyed a request to exit his vehicle, which\r\nOfficer Owens opined was an indicator of criminal activity because the cell phone\r\nis a person's device for communication when he tries to flee. Moore then lit a\r\ncigarette as he stood outside his vehicle, and Officer Owens explained that based\r\non his training, people sometimes light cigarettes to calm their nerves. Moore\r\nagreed to a pat-down and voluntarily raised his hands to his head, which is a\r\nposition known as the \"felony position.\" Officer Owens felt what he perceived to\r\nbe a large sum of wadded money. Moore moved the money from his front pocket\r\nto his back pocket, and Officer Owens said another alarm was triggered because\r\nMoore said he was unemployed. Officer Owens estimated the wad of money to be\r\naround one thousand dollars when he initially saw it, but subsequently, it was\r\ndetermined to be about six hundred dollars. Moore again admitted he had been\r\ndrinking and placed his hands in his pockets with his head down, in a position\r\nOfficer Owens described as a \"defeated look.\" Officer Owens opined this action is\r\nused to dissipate nervous energy.\r\n\r\nMoore was traveling from Lawrenceville, Georgia, which is a suburb of Atlanta,\r\nGeorgia, to see his grandmother in Marion, North Carolina. Officer Owens\r\ntestified ninety percent of the people he has arrested in major criminal drug cases\r\nhave come from Atlanta. It raised some questions for Officer Owens when Moore\r\nexplained he was traveling to visit his grandmother at one o'clock in the morning,\r\nespecially after drinking. During questioning, Moore stated a third-party had\r\nrented the vehicle. Officer Owens explained third-party rental vehicles are one of\r\nthe largest indicators of criminal activity in criminal patrol on the interstate.\r\nOfficer Moore administered field sobriety tests to determine if Moore was\r\nimpaired, and Moore passed two out of three. Officer Owens found Moore was\r\nnot impaired and asked Moore if there was any alcohol in the vehicle. Moore\r\ndenied having any alcohol, weapons, or drugs in the vehicle. Officer Owens also\r\nasked Moore if he could search the vehicle, but Moore declined consent.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Officer Owens decided to issue a warning ticket to Moore because\r\nhe felt it would have been an injustice to arrest Moore for driving under the\r\ninfluence. However, he decided to detain Moore until the K-9 drug detection unit\r\ncould arrive. Officer Carraway arrived after about fifteen minutes, a total of thirty-\r\ntwo minutes since the beginning of the traffic stop. Officer Carraway's dog alerted\r\nto an odor inside the car, and the officers searched the vehicle. A bottle of alcohol\r\n\nwas found under the front passenger seat of the vehicle, and contraband consistent\r\nwith crack cocaine was found in two containers in a bag in the trunk of the vehicle.\r\nThey also found a semiautomatic weapon and a bundle of currency. Moore was\r\nthen arrested.\r\n\r\nOn October 22, 2010, Moore was indicted for trafficking cocaine base, first\r\noffense, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nThe case went to trial on April 25, 2011. The State cited State v. Provet, 391 S.C.\r\n494, 706 S.E.2d 513 (Ct. App. 2011), cert. granted, Oct. 3, 2012, in support of its\r\nargument that Officer Owens had reasonable suspicion to further detain Moore\r\nbeyond the scope of the initial traffic stop. It listed the following facts in support\r\nof finding a lawful detention: (1) Moore turned on his left turn signal when he was\r\nintending to turn right; (2) there was a distinctive odor of alcohol coming from\r\nMoore's vehicle; (3) Moore smoked two cigarettes during the traffic stop; (4)\r\nMoore failed to hang up his cell phone when Officer Owens approached; (5)\r\nMoore appeared nervous, evidenced by his shaky hands, rapid pulse, and heavy\r\nbreathing; (6) Moore attempted to pick up his cell phone when Officer Moore\r\nasked him to exit the vehicle; (7) Moore had a large wad of cash on his person\r\neven though he stated he was unemployed; (8) Moore drove a vehicle rented by a\r\nthird-party; (9) Moore was driving from Atlanta, a known hub for drug trafficking;\r\nand (10) Moore stated he was going to his grandmother's house, but it was already\r\n1 a.m.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing both parties' arguments and reviewing relevant case law, the trial\r\ncourt stated In particular, the problem I have with the or the facts that\r\n             are revealed by the rental agreement indicate the rental in\r\n             North Carolina on the evening, afternoon before the stop\r\n             was made at one o'clock in the morning. I have my\r\n             doubts that the car was driven from Morganton to\r\n             Lawrenceville and back to Marion to visit a grandmother.\r\n             Morganton and Marion is a much shorter trip than that.\r\n\r\n             So, it appears that he may have been less than truthful\r\n             about the purpose of his trip. Also, for someone\r\n             unemployed, to be carrying such a large amount of cash\r\n             in their pocket also would obviously give [an] officer\r\n             reasonable suspicions. The other factors as noted, I have\r\n\n             given those the weight required, and in this case I am\r\n             going to refuse to suppress.\r\n\r\nThe trial proceeded and Moore was convicted of both charges. He was sentenced\r\nto twenty-five years on his trafficking charge as well as five years on his\r\npossession charge, and the sentences were to run concurrently. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In Fourth Amendment cases, the trial court's factual rulings are reviewed under\r\nthe 'clear error' standard.\" Provet, 391 S.C. at 498, 706 S.E.2d at 515 (citing State\r\nv.

United States, 517\r\nU.S. 806, 810 (1996)).\r\n\r\n\"Lengthening the detention for further questioning beyond that related to the initial\r\nstop is acceptable in two situations: (1) the officer has an objectively reasonable\r\nand articulable suspicion illegal activity has occurred or is occurring; or (2) the\r\ninitial detention has become a consensual encounter.\" Id. at 500, 706 S.E.2d at 516\r\n(citing Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 99, 623 S.E.2d at 848). \"Reasonable suspicion\r\nrequires a particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another\r\nof criminal activity.\" Id.

Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 522, 698 S.E.2d 203, 205 (2010), an officer\r\nstopped Tindall for speeding, following too closely behind another vehicle, and\r\nfailing to maintain his lane. The officer eventually informed Tindall that he would\r\nreceive a warning ticket, but the officer then continued questioning Tindall for six\r\nto seven additional minutes, asking about drug crimes and various things about\r\nTindall's business. Id. The issue before the court was \"whether the officer\r\nreasonably suspected a serious crime at the point at which he chose not to conclude\r\nthe traffic stop, despite his stated intention to issue a warning ticket, instead opting\r\nto continue his questioning.\" Id. at 523, 698 S.E.2d at 206. The court found when\r\nthe officer decided to continue detaining Tindall, he had ascertained the following\r\nfacts:       (1) Tindall was driving to Durham to meet his brother;\r\n             (2) Tindall was driving a rental car rented the previous\r\n             day by a third-party which was to be returned to Atlanta\r\n             on the day of the stop; (3) Tindall did a \"felony stretch\"\r\n             on exiting the vehicle; and (4) Tindall seemed nervous.\r\n\r\nId. Our supreme court found those facts did not provide reasonable suspicion, and,\r\nthus, the continued detention was illegal. Id.\r\n\r\nMoore concedes the initial stop was legal but contends Officer Owens exceeded\r\nthe scope of the stop without reasonable suspicion of a serious crime. The question\r\nbefore this court is whether Officer Owens developed a reasonable, articulable\r\nsuspicion that Moore was trafficking drugs at the time he intended to issue the\r\nwarning citation such that the continued detention was lawful.\r\n\r\nWe first note the trial court placed a heavy emphasis on Moore's trip from\r\nMorganton to Lawrenceville to Marion in finding reasonable suspicion existed.\r\nThe dissent believes the trial court's finding was consistent with Officer Owen's\r\ntestimony, but we do not agree. Officer Owens simply stated the third-party rental\r\n\nagreement was indicative of drug trafficking and that it was an odd time of night to\r\nbe visiting a grandmother especially given that Moore had been drinking. Officer\r\nOwens did not testify that the exact route Moore allegedly took was suspicious and\r\ngave no specific testimony to support the trial court's finding that it was doubtful\r\nhe had driven from Morganton to Lawrenceville and back to Marion. It is\r\nimportant that we analyze the factors that Officer Owens considered at the time of\r\nthe detention and not factors put forth by the trial court at a later date. Thus, we do\r\nnot address the trial court's finding as a factor in determining whether Officer\r\nOwens' continued detention of Moore was lawful.\r\n\r\nThe State argues there were many indicators giving rise to a reasonable suspicion:\r\n(1) Moore turned on his left turn signal when he was initially pulled over (sign that\r\nMoore might flee); (2) Moore took a long time to pull over (sign that Moore might\r\nflee); (3) Moore never turned off his turn signal (sign of nervousness); (4) Moore\r\nadmitted to drinking (typically used to calm a drug trafficker's nerves); (5) Moore\r\nstarted smoking a cigarette (another sign of attempting to calm nerves); (6) Moore\r\ncontinued to talk on his cell phone after he was pulled over by officer (common in\r\ndrug trafficking cases because it indicates he is attempting to let a superior know\r\nhe has been stopped by law enforcement); (7) Moore's hands were shaking heavily\r\nand his pulse was elevated (additional signs of nervousness); (8) Moore tried to\r\npick up his cell phone once he got out of the car (sign that Moore might flee); (9)\r\nMoore had a large amount of cash in his pocket even though he admitted to being\r\nunemployed; (10) Moore drove a rental car rented by a third-party (common in\r\ndrug trafficking); (11) Moore was driving on I-85, coming from the Atlanta area (a\r\nknown drug corridor and a major drug source); (12) Moore claimed to be on the\r\nway to visit his grandmother (unusual to visit grandmother at 1 a.m.); (13) Moore\r\nassumed the felony stretch position even though the officers did not ask him to do\r\nso; and (14) Moore remained extremely nervous even after he was advised he\r\nwould only receive a warning citation.\r\n\r\nWe share the Fourth Circuit's concern regarding the State's inclination toward\r\nusing whatever facts are present, no matter how innocent, as indicia of suspicious\r\nactivity. See State v. Burgess, 394 S.C. 407, 415, 714 S.E.2d 917, 921 (2011)\r\n(citing United State v. Foster, 634 F.3d 243, 248 (4th Cir. 2011)).\r\n\r\n             [T]he State must do more than simply label a behavior as\r\n             suspicious to make it so. The State must be able to either\r\n             articulate why a particular behavior is suspicious or\r\n             logically demonstrate, given the surrounding\r\n\n             circumstances, that the behavior is likely to be indicative\r\n             of some more sinister activity than may appear at first\r\n             glance.\r\n\r\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted). We recognize that factors consistent\r\nwith innocent travel can, when taken together, give rise to reasonable suspicion,\r\nbut we do not believe the present factors eliminate a substantial portion of innocent\r\ntravelers. See United States v. Digiovanni, 650 F.3d 498, 511-13 (4th Cir. 2011).\r\nIn our view the present factors have been expanded by the State in an effort to\r\ndistinguish this case from Provet. Despite this effort, the alleged flight indicators\r\nlost much of their significance once Moore cooperated and stayed throughout the\r\ninitial traffic stop and sobriety test. Further, the State attempted to expand the\r\nfactor of nervousness into several factors by listing Moore's specific nervous\r\nconduct throughout the stop. As to Moore's wad of money, Officer Owens had no\r\nway of determining the total amount of cash in Moore's pocket, and it could have\r\nconsisted of one dollar bills or one hundred dollar bills. Thus, this fact does not\r\nreasonably contribute to his reasonable suspicion. The State argues Moore's\r\nadmission of drinking also contributed to Officer Owens' reasonable suspicion, but\r\nOfficer Owens admitted Moore was not impaired and it would have been unfair to\r\nissue a ticket for an alcohol-related offense. Once we have viewed the factors in\r\ntheir totality, we find the State presented a similar case to Tindall: Moore was\r\ndriving to visit a family member, Moore was driving a vehicle rented by a third-\r\nparty, he was coming from a major city known as a drug hub and traveling along a\r\nknown drug route, he assumed the felony position, and he displayed nervous\r\nconduct throughout the entire stop.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we find these facts did not provide Officer Owen with a reasonable\r\nsuspicion of a serious crime. Moore also declined consent to search his vehicle.\r\nAs a result, the continued detention was illegal, and the drugs discovered during\r\nthe search of the vehicle must be suppressed.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., dissenting: I would affirm the trial court's decision denying Moore's\r\nmotion to suppress because there is evidence in the record to support the trial\r\ncourt's factual findings, and its legal conclusions are not clearly erroneous. See\r\nState v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 523 n.5, 698 S.E.2d 203, 206 n.5 (2010)\r\n(summarizing our standard of review—\"we must ask first, whether the record\r\nsupports the trial court's assumed findings . . . and second, whether these facts\r\nsupport a finding that the officer had reasonable suspicion of a serious crime\"). As\r\nexplained by the majority, trial courts employ a \"totality of the circumstances\r\nanalysis\" and \"must give due weight to common sense judgments reached by\r\nofficers in light of their experience and training.\" State v. Taylor, 401 S.C. 104,\r\n112-13, 736 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2013). In this case, the trial court did just that in\r\nconcluding the officer's observations and the circumstances under which he\r\nassessed the situation gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that Moore was engaged\r\nin serious criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThe majority's opinion lists numerous observations the officer made that led him to\r\nbe suspicious of Moore. I agree many of the facts the officer observed are\r\ninsignificant, and I share the majority's frustration over the officer's attempt to\r\nmake innocent circumstances appear suspicious. In this case, however, the trial\r\ncourt made specific factual findings regarding observations it found to be\r\nsignificant, focusing on two key facts—the \"large sum of wadded money in\r\n[Moore's] pocket\" and Moore's explanation that he was driving to his\r\ngrandmother's house at 1:00 a.m. Our standard of review forbids us to disagree\r\nwith these findings if there is any evidence to support them. See 401 S.C. at 108,\r\n736 S.E.2d at 665 (\"A trial court's Fourth Amendment suppression ruling must be\r\naffirmed if supported by any evidence.\").\r\n\r\nThe majority's decision expressly disregards this standard of review as to these key\r\nfacts. First, the majority improperly reassesses the significance the officer placed\r\non the money found in Moore's pocket. During the suppression hearing, the officer\r\ntestified,   I felt what I perceived as a large sum of wadded money\r\n             in his pocket, and I left it there, and then Deputy or\r\n             Corporal Hancock proceeded in checking his pockets,\r\n             then he pulled out the wad of money, and then put[] it\r\n             back in his pocket.\r\n\nWhen asked how much money he thought Moore had, the officer replied, \"Well,\r\nit's more . . . folded money than I carry. I would . . . [say] it was at least . . .\r\nbordering a thousand dollars.\" The officer also testified that Moore told him he\r\nwas unemployed. When asked about the apparently large amount of money in the\r\npossession of an unemployed suspect, the officer replied, \"That would be cause for\r\nalarm.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court found that \"someone unemployed . . . [and] carrying such a large\r\namount of cash in their pocket . . . would obviously give an officer reasonable\r\nsuspicions.\" Despite the officer's testimony to support the trial court's finding, the\r\nmajority disagrees. The majority states, \"As to Moore's wad of money, [the\r\nofficer] had no way of determining the total amount of cash in Moore's pocket, and\r\nit could have consisted of one dollar bills or one hundred dollar bills. Thus, this\r\nfact does not reasonably contribute to his reasonable suspicion.\"2 In State v.\r\nWallace, 392 S.C. 47, 52, 707 S.E.2d 451, 453 (Ct. App. 2011), this court stated\r\n\"the application of the law to a specific set of facts in an individual case can be\r\nunsettling.\" By that, we meant it can be difficult to determine \"whether [the trial\r\ncourt's factual findings] support a [legal conclusion] that the officer had reasonable\r\nsuspicion of a serious crime\"—the second step in the analysis set out in Tindall.\r\nSee 388 S.C. at 523 n.5, 698 S.E.2d at 206 n.5. In the first step of the Tindall\r\nanalysis—reviewing the factual findings themselves—we are not permitted to\r\nmake it difficult. Rather, we are constrained to determine whether there is any\r\nevidence to support the finding. In this instance, the majority simply disagrees\r\nwith the trial court despite evidence supporting the trial court's finding. In doing\r\nso, the majority has failed to observe our standard of review.\r\n\r\nSecond, the majority disregards our standard of review by minimizing the\r\nsignificance of the trial court's specific factual finding regarding Moore's pretextual\r\nexplanation that he was driving to his grandmother's house at 1:00 a.m. along a\r\nhighly improbable route. At the suppression hearing, the State offered in evidence\r\nthe rental agreement the officer found in Moore's car, which showed the car had\r\n\r\n2 I disagree with the majority's statement that this fact should not be considered\r\nbecause the officer \"had no way of determining the total amount of cash in Moore's\r\npocket.\" The officer made an on-the-spot assessment under the circumstances\r\nbefore him that Moore was carrying an unusual amount of money, and this made\r\nhim suspicious. The trial court relied on this fact to find the officer's suspicion was\r\nreasonable. It makes no difference that the money could have been one dollar\r\nbills.\r\n\nbeen rented in North Carolina the day before. Moore told the officer he had driven\r\nthe car to a suburb of Atlanta, and was on his way back to Marion, North Carolina,\r\nto visit his grandmother. Based on this evidence, the trial court found:\r\n\r\n             [T]he rental agreement indicates the rental in North\r\n             Carolina on the evening, afternoon before the stop was\r\n             made at one o'clock in the morning. I have my doubts\r\n             that the car was driven from Morganton to Lawrenceville\r\n             [Georgia] and back to Marion to visit a grandmother.\r\n             That's a long way to go around to visit your grandmother.\r\n             Morganton and Marion is a much shorter trip than that.\r\n             So, it appears that he may [have] been less than truthful\r\n             about the purpose of his trip.\r\n\r\nThe majority ignores this finding because it claims the officer \"did not testify to\r\nthis particular detail.\" However, as part of his testimony regarding observations he\r\nmade during the traffic stop, which was offered to show why he was suspicious,\r\nthe officer testified he read the rental agreement and found Moore's story regarding\r\nthe purpose of his trip to North Carolina to be dubious, given the hour and his\r\nalleged destination. Because the officer's testimony and the evidence produced at\r\nthe hearing supports the court's finding that Moore was \"less than truthful about the\r\npurpose of his trip,\" we are not permitted to simply ignore this finding.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two key facts, the trial court relied on other observations made\r\nby the officer that support the reasonableness of the officer's suspicion. In the\r\nargument portion of the suppression hearing, the assistant solicitor listed, by my\r\ncount, eighteen separate facts in support of reasonable suspicion. While some of\r\nthose facts are almost completely insignificant by themselves, I find the following\r\nfacts, considered as a whole, to be important to our analysis: (1) Moore turned on\r\nhis left turn signal, even though he was pulling over to the right side of the road,\r\nafter the officer activated his blue lights; (2) Moore took a long time to pull over;\r\n(3) the officer detected an odor of alcohol; (4) Moore smoked two cigarettes during\r\nthe stop; (5) Moore continued talking on his cell phone during the stop; (6) the\r\nofficer described Moore as \"overly nervous;\" (7) Moore's pulse was rapid; (8)\r\nMoore's breathing was heavy; (9) Moore tried to pick up his cell phone after he got\r\nout of the car; (10) someone other than Moore, who was not in the car, rented the\r\ncar; (11) Moore was traveling from a city that is a known drug source; and (12)\r\nMoore looked down in a \"defeated\" fashion when asked if there were any illegal\r\nitems in the car. The trial court clearly indicated it relied on these facts in addition\r\n\nto the two key facts discussed above, stating, \"The other factors as noted, I have\r\ngiven those the weight required.\" While none of these twelve observations, on\r\ntheir own, could give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, when\r\nconsidered together with the two key facts discussed above, they support the trial\r\ncourt's finding.\r\n\r\nWe must also consider the officer's background in law enforcement, which is\r\nextensive and includes: (1) being a member of the Highway Patrol with the South\r\nCarolina Department of Public Safety for seventeen years; (2) spending twelve of\r\nthose years with the Aggressive Crime Enforcement Unit—nine of which he\r\nserved as the first line supervisor for the unit; (3) receiving over a thousand hours\r\nin advanced criminal interdiction, which included drug interdiction; (4) being\r\ncertified as a \"master interdictor\" through the National Criminal Enforcement\r\nAssociation; and (5) serving as an instructor for the South Carolina Criminal\r\nJustice Academy in criminal interdiction. See Wallace, 392 S.C. at 52, 707 S.E.2d\r\nat 453 (relying on United State v. Branch, 537 F.3d 328, 336, (4th Cir. 2008), for\r\nthe contention that courts should give weight to the practical experience of officers\r\nwhen determining the reasonableness of an officer's suspicion). In particular, I\r\nfind the officer's experience in the Aggressive Crime Enforcement Unit and his\r\ntraining in drug interdiction important to support the reasonableness of his\r\nsuspicion. See id. (considering the officer's education in drugs and drug\r\ninterdiction in its analysis); State v. Provet, 391 S.C. 494, 506, 706 S.E.2d 513, 519\r\n(Ct. App. 2011) (considering, in particular, the officer's experience with the\r\nAggressive Criminal Enforcement Unit in determining the existence of reasonable\r\nsuspicion).\r\n\r\nReviewing the record as a whole and considering the totality of the circumstances,\r\nthe trial court did not err in concluding reasonable suspicion existed. Thus, I\r\nwould affirm.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5161","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 2010, Williams cared for his girlfriend's fifteen-month-old daughter\r\n(Victim) for about ten hours. That evening, Victim's mother and other family\r\nmembers took her to the emergency room after they noticed bruises on her face,\r\narms, and genital area. Detective Ed Prestigiacomo visited the hospital to\r\ninvestigate Victim's injuries the following day. He learned Williams had cared for\r\nVictim on the day her injuries were discovered. He contacted Williams and asked\r\nhim to come to the Lexington County Sheriff's Department to talk to him.\r\nWilliams told Detective Prestigiacomo he wanted to clear up the matter that night\r\nbecause he had a wedding to attend in Alabama the following day. Williams\r\narrived at the Department that night around 7 p.m. with his mother and two-year-\r\nold daughter.\r\n\r\nDetective Prestigiacomo escorted Williams to an interview room while his mother\r\nand daughter stayed in the lobby. The door to the interview room was locked to\r\npeople entering the room but a person could exit the room without a key or code.2\r\nDetective Palkowski joined them in the interview room after Detective\r\nPrestigiacomo had gotten some background information from Williams. Detective\r\nPrestigiacomo informed Williams Victim had bruises all over her body, and\r\nWilliams said she had fallen. Detective Prestigiacomo showed Williams pictures\r\nof Victim's arms, which had circular bruises on them that Detective Prestigiacomo\r\nbelieved to be finger marks from someone holding her too tightly. Williams told\r\nDetective Prestigiacomo he sometimes picks his daughter up like that and his\r\nmother has told him he should not pick up a child like that. He informed the\r\ndetectives a shard of glass had gone into his hand when he was in school and the\r\ninjury caused his hand to be numb because of the severed nerves. Williams\r\nindicated that as a result of the injury, sometimes he is heavy handed. Williams\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). \n\r\n2 Detective Prestigiacomo provided this in his testimony at trial, but during the \n\r\nJackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), hearing, he had testified the door was \n\r\nlocked and Williams did not have a key or the combination to open it. \n\r\n\noffered to shake Detective Prestigiacomo's hand to demonstrate his grip, and\r\nDetective Prestigiacomo allowed him to do that.\r\n\r\nDetective Prestigiacomo next showed Williams pictures of Victim's ears, revealing\r\nbruising on and behind the ears, which Detective Prestigiacomo testified is\r\ncommon when a person is slapped or punched in the ear. Williams stated Victim\r\nhad misbehaved and the injuries occurred when he disciplined her during those two\r\noccurrences. Williams said Victim had a temper tantrum and was throwing her\r\ntoys and he slapped her twice on one ear. Later, she threw her bottle down and he\r\nslapped her on the other ear twice. He said he did it for discipline and\r\ndemonstrated on himself to show how he could not tell his own strength. Williams\r\nalso punched the desk at some point during the interview to demonstrate how he\r\ncould not feel his hand.\r\n\r\nDetective Prestigiacomo showed Williams the third picture, which was her\r\nforehead that had several circular bruises, and another of the outside of her vagina,\r\nwhich was bruised. Williams stated Victim had injured her head by falling and he\r\nhad to put eczema cream on her vagina and did not realize how hard he was\r\npressing. He told Detective Prestigiacomo he was angry about having to clean her\r\nand demonstrated how much force he had used. Detective Prestigiacomo then\r\nstopped the interrogation and advised Williams of his Miranda rights.3 Williams\r\nwaived those rights and wrote a formal statement repeating the explanations given\r\nfor Victim's injuries. In response to direct written questions by Detective\r\nPrestigiacomo, Williams added he had injured Victim's vagina while cleaning her\r\nduring a diaper change because he was angry. He also wrote that he had an anger\r\nproblem. Williams was arrested for physical assault and sexual assault or assault\r\nagainst sexual organs. A grand jury indicted him for CSC with a minor, first\r\ndegree, and unlawful conduct towards a child.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the trial, the court held a Jackson v. Denno hearing. Detective\r\nPrestigiacomo testified about the evening Williams came to the Department. He\r\nprovided that Williams was the primary suspect but Victim's mother and her\r\nroommate were also suspects. He testified Williams was not in custody during his\r\ninterview before he was advised of his Miranda rights. Detective Prestigiacomo\r\ntestified Williams was free to leave at the beginning of the interview until he gave\r\n\r\n\r\n3This occurred approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after they had started\r\nspeaking about Victim's injuries.\r\n\nthe incriminating statements and at that point Detective Prestigiacomo\r\nadministered the Miranda warnings.\r\n\r\nThe trial court first analyzed the oral statement and looked at State v. Evans, 354\r\nS.C. 579, 582 S.E.2d 407 (2003), and State v. Navy, 386 S.C. 294, 688 S.E.2d 838\r\n(2010). It noted that it was to look at the totality of the circumstances from an\r\nobjective standard. The trial court determined that based on \"the method of arrival,\r\nthe voluntary arrival, the agreement to participate, the accidental explanations,\r\n[and] the officer's testimony that the Defendant was free to leave,\" the oral\r\nstatement was admissible because Williams was not in custody and therefore\r\nMiranda warnings were not required. The court noted it was making that decision\r\nbased on an objective standard and not just the officer's subjective testimony that\r\nWilliams was free to leave. The trial court found that \"a reasonable person arriving\r\nvoluntarily in a private vehicle, never requests any help, not under the influence,\r\ncooperating with the officers, wanting to clear it up, that a reasonable person would\r\nbelieve they were free to leave.\" The trial court further found once Detective\r\nPrestigiacomo decided to place Williams under arrest, he was appropriately\r\nadvised of his Miranda rights. Thus, the written statement was admissible.4\r\n\r\nDuring the testimony of Marlena Clary, a forensic nurse examiner, the State sought\r\nto admit enlarged copies of a report, including anatomical diagrams (State's\r\nExhibits 9, 10 and 11). Williams objected, and the trial court overruled the\r\nobjection, instructing the jury the fact that it was enlarged should not enhance or\r\ndisenhance the evidence or testimony. Later, the State sought to introduce\r\nphotographs into evidence (State's Exhibits 12, 13, 14, and 15). Williams stated he\r\nhad no objection, and the trial court admitted the photographs into evidence.\r\n\r\nDr. Susan Breeland Luberoff was qualified as an expert in child abuse pediatrics\r\nand testified. During her testimony, the State sought to introduce photographs Dr.\r\nLuberoff had taken during her examination of Victim (State's Exhibits 16, 17, 18,\r\n19, and 20). Williams stated he had no objection to the photographs.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the State's case, Williams moved for a directed verdict on the count\r\nof unlawful conduct towards a child. He argued he was not a person responsible\r\nfor Victim's welfare because he was not the parent of Victim. The trial court\r\ndenied the motion, finding the State presented evidence he was an adult who\r\n\r\n4Williams later testified on his own behalf and repeated the explanations he had\r\ngiven during his questioning by the officers.\r\n\nassumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for a child, in that he\r\nstayed at the house overnight with Victim's mother a majority of the time and\r\ninteracted with Victim. The court found he had more than incidental contact.\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Williams of both counts. The trial court sentenced him to\r\ntwenty-five years' imprisonment for CSC and ten years' imprisonment for unlawful\r\nconduct towards a child, to run concurrently. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Thus, an appellate court is\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Miranda Rights\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred in admitting statements he gave before and\r\nafter he was advised of his Miranda rights because he was in custody at the time he\r\ngave the statements. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\nbe reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\" State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\nS.E.2d 262, 265 (2006). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\nthe trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.\"\r\nId.; see also State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004) (\"The\r\nadmission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of\r\nthe trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest abuse\r\nof discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.\"). Our review of whether a\r\nperson is in custody is confined to a determination of whether the ruling by the trial\r\ncourt is supported by the record. State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 583, 582 S.E.2d\r\n407, 409 (2003).\r\n\r\nThe State may not use statements stemming from custodial interrogation of the\r\ndefendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to\r\nsecure the privilege against self-incrimination. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436,\r\n444 (1966). Custodial interrogation entails questioning initiated by law\r\nenforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise\r\n\ndeprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. Id. Interrogation can be\r\neither express questioning or its functional equivalent and includes words or\r\nactions on the part of police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and\r\ncustody) the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating\r\nresponse. State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 303, 479 S.E.2d 838, 842 (Ct. App.\r\n1996), aff'd as modified, 333 S.C. 426, 510 S.E.2d 714 (1998).\r\n\r\nWhether a suspect was in \"custody is determined by an objective analysis of\r\n'whether a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood himself\r\nto be in custody.'\" State v. Ledford, 351 S.C. 83, 88, 567 S.E.2d 904, 907 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002) (quoting State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 128, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621\r\n(1997)). \"To determine whether a suspect is in custody, the trial court must\r\nexamine the totality of the circumstances, which include factors such as the place,\r\npurpose, and length of interrogation, as well as whether the suspect was free to\r\nleave the place of questioning.\" Evans, 354 S.C. at 583, 582 S.E.2d at 410. A\r\nperson is \"in custody\" when a person's freedom has been restricted. State v.\r\nCaulder, 287 S.C. 507, 515, 339 S.E.2d 876, 881 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a suspect was in custody for the purposes of Miranda, the\r\nSupreme Court has asked whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom\r\nof movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. Maryland v. Shatzer,\r\n559 U.S. 98, 112 (2010). \"The threat to a citizen's Fifth Amendment rights that\r\nMiranda was designed to neutralize has little to do with the strength of an\r\ninterrogating officer's suspicions.\" Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 324-25\r\n(1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[A]ny inquiry into whether the\r\ninterrogating officers have focused their suspicions upon the individual being\r\nquestioned (assuming those suspicions remain undisclosed) is not relevant for\r\npurposes of Miranda.\"\r\nId. at 326. In [Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004)], the Court\r\n            dealt with the police practice of questioning a suspect\r\n            until incriminating information is elicited, then\r\n            administering Miranda warnings. Following the\r\n            warnings, the suspect is again questioned and the\r\n            incriminating information re-elicited. The post-warning\r\n            statement is then sought to be admitted. The factors to be\r\n            considered in determining whether a constitutional\r\n\n             violation occurred in this setting, according to the Seibert\r\n             plurality opinion, are:\r\n             1) the completeness and detail of the question and\r\n             answers in the first round of interrogation;\r\n             2) the timing and setting of the first questioning and the\r\n             second;\r\n             3) the continuity of police personnel; and\r\n             4) the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated\r\n             the second round as continuous with the first.\r\n\r\nState v. Navy, 386 S.C. 294, 302, 688 S.E.2d 838, 841-42 (2010). In Seibert,\r\n\r\n             Justice Kennedy wrote separately, stating that while he\r\n             agreed with much of the plurality opinion, he wished to\r\n             emphasize that not every Miranda violation would\r\n             require suppression. He explained that an exception\r\n             should be made where the officer may not have realized\r\n             that a suspect is in custody and therefore a warning was\r\n             required, or where the officer did not plan to question the\r\n             suspect at that juncture. Justice Kennedy noted that in\r\n             Seibert, the two-step technique was used to deliberately\r\n             avoid Miranda, using a strategy based on the assumption\r\n             that Miranda warnings will mean less when given after\r\n             an incriminating statement has already been made.\r\n             Under these circumstances, Justice Kennedy agreed the\r\n             statements must be suppressed unless \"curative\r\n             measures\" were taken. As examples of curative actions,\r\n             Justice Kennedy suggested a substantial break in time\r\n             and circumstances between the pre-warning statement\r\n             and the warned, or an additional warning before\r\n             questioning resumes that the pre-warned statement is not\r\n             admissible.\r\n\r\nNavy, 386 S.C. at 302-03, 688 S.E.2d at 842. Our supreme court held the evidence\r\nof a deliberate police practice, the \"question first\" strategy, was not determinative\r\nin Seibert. Navy, 386 S.C. at 304, 688 S.E.2d at 842.\r\n\r\nIn Navy, the supreme court noted:\r\n\n             The officers began the questioning of [defendant] with\r\n             knowledge that the child had been suffocated and with\r\n             the intention of eliciting a confession. After\r\n             [defendant]'s first oral statement, the officers \"sprang\"\r\n             the suffocation/healing rib fractures information on\r\n             [defendant], and began an unwarned custodial\r\n             interrogation designed to elicit incriminating information,\r\n             that is, questioning designed to have [defendant] admit to\r\n             having hit the child and to having smothered him. Once\r\n             those incriminating answers were given—i.e. after\r\n             [defendant] admitted he had popped the child on the back\r\n             and \"patted\" his mouth—[defendant] was permitted a\r\n             supervised cigarette break, then given Miranda warnings,\r\n             with interrogation by the same officer resuming\r\n             immediately. Thus the four elements outlined in Seibert\r\n             were met here.\r\n\r\nNavy, 386 S.C. at 303, 688 S.E.2d at 842.\r\n\r\nSimply because an interview takes place at a law enforcement center and at the\r\ninitiation of police investigators does not render it a \"custodial interrogation.\"\r\nState v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 708, 258 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1979). Rather, the fact a\r\ndefendant voluntarily agreed to accompany investigators to their office and answer\r\nquestions without being placed under arrest indicates a non-custodial situation. Id.\r\nIn Navy, the supreme court found it was debatable whether a reasonable person\r\nwould have believed he was in custody at the time the first statement was given,\r\nand thus held the trial court's finding the defendant was not in custody should have\r\nbeen upheld as it was supported by the record. 386 S.C. at 301, 688 S.E.2d at 841.\r\n\r\n             Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police\r\n             officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue\r\n             of the fact that the police officer is part of a law\r\n             enforcement system which may ultimately cause the\r\n             suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers\r\n             are not required to administer Miranda warnings to\r\n             everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of\r\n             warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning\r\n             takes place in the station house, or because the\r\n             questioned person is one whom the police suspect.\r\n\n            Miranda warnings are required only where there has\r\n            been such a restriction on a person's freedom as to render\r\n            him in custody. It was that sort of coercive environment\r\n            to which Miranda by its terms was made applicable, and\r\n            to which it is limited.\r\n\r\nOregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).   The initial determination of whether an individual is in\r\n            custody depends on the objective circumstances of the\r\n            interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by\r\n            either the interrogating officers or the person being\r\n            questioned. Thus, a police officer's subjective view that\r\n            the person being questioned is a suspect, if undisclosed,\r\n            does not bear upon the question of whether that person is\r\n            in custody, and the same is true where the officer's\r\n            undisclosed assessment is that the person being\r\n            questioned is not a suspect. However, an officer's\r\n            knowledge or beliefs may bear upon the issue of whether\r\n            the person being questioned is in custody if they are\r\n            conveyed, by word or deed, to the person being\r\n            questioned; those beliefs are relevant only to the extent\r\n            they would affect how a reasonable person in the position\r\n            of the person being questioned would gauge the breadth\r\n            of his or her freedom of action.\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Blum, Annotation, What Constitutes \"Custodial Interrogation\" of Adult\r\nby Police Officer Within Rule of Miranda v. Arizona Requiring that Suspect Be\r\nInformed of Federal Constitutional Rights Before Custodial Interrogation—At\r\nPolice Station or Sheriff's Office, Where Defendant Voluntarily Appears or\r\nAppears at Request of Law Enforcement Personnel, or Where Unspecified as to\r\nCircumstances Upon Which Defendant Is Present, 29 A.L.R.6th 1, § 2 (2007).\r\n\r\nIn determining whether an interrogation was \"custodial\" within the meaning of the\r\nMiranda rule, courts have considered the following factors: (1) whether the contact\r\nwith law enforcement was initiated by the police or the person interrogated, and if\r\nby the police, whether the person voluntarily agreed to interview; (2) whether the\r\nexpress purpose of the interview was to question the person as a witness or\r\n\nsuspect; (3) where the interview took place; (4) whether the police informed the\r\nperson he or she was under arrest or in custody; (5) whether they informed the\r\nperson he or she could terminate the interview and leave at any time or whether the\r\nperson's conduct indicated an awareness of such freedom; (6) whether there were\r\nrestrictions on the person's freedom of movement during the interview; (7) how\r\nlong the interrogation lasted; (8) how many police officers participated; (9)\r\nwhether they dominated and controlled the course of the interrogation; (10)\r\nwhether they manifested a belief that the person was culpable and they had the\r\nevidence to prove it; (11) whether the police were aggressive, confrontational, or\r\naccusatory; (12) whether the police used interrogation techniques to pressure the\r\nsuspect; and (13) whether the person was arrested at the end of the interrogation.\r\nId. at § 3. Some courts have outlined several factors used to assess\r\n            how a reasonable person in the defendant's situation\r\n            would have understood the situation: (1) What was the\r\n            location where the questioning took place, that is, was the\r\n            defendant comfortable and in a place a person would\r\n            normally feel free to leave, for example, at home as\r\n            opposed to being in the more restrictive environment of a\r\n            police station; (2) Was the defendant a suspect at the time\r\n            the interview began, bearing in mind that Miranda\r\n            warnings are not required simply because the\r\n            investigation has focused; (3) Was the defendant's\r\n            freedom to leave restricted in any way; (4) Was the\r\n            defendant handcuffed or told he was under arrest; (5)\r\n            Were threats . . . made during the interrogation; (6) Was\r\n            the defendant physically intimidated during the\r\n            interrogation; (7) Did the police verbally dominate the\r\n            interrogation; (8) What was the defendant's purpose for\r\n            being at the place where questioning took place? For\r\n            example, the defendant might be at a hospital for\r\n            treatment instead of being brought to the location for\r\n            questioning; (9) Were neutral parties present at any point\r\n            during the questioning; (10) Did police take any action to\r\n            overpower, trick, or coerce the defendant into making a\r\n            statement?\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\nThe Court of Appeals of Georgia has noted:\r\n\r\n             Even if the police have probable cause to arrest at the\r\n             time of the interview and secretly intend to charge the\r\n             suspect at some future time, such facts are immaterial to\r\n             a determination of whether the suspect was in custody at\r\n             the time of the interview, except when and to what extent\r\n             the police communicate their future intent to arrest\r\n             during the course of the interview.\r\n\r\nRay v. State, 615 S.E.2d 812, 815-16 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\nIn Evans, the interview lasted three hours and officers challenged the defendant on\r\nthe answers she gave. 353 S.C. at 581, 584, 582 S.E.2d at 409, 410. There, the\r\ntrial court found the defendant to be in custody, and thus, the appellate court based\r\nits decision on whether any evidence supported that finding. Id. at 584, 582 S.E.2d\r\nat 410. In Navy, the court noted that the defendant was upset during the interview,\r\nwhich lasted three hours, and the police called into doubt his responses to their\r\nquestions. 386 S.C. at 297, 303, 688 S.E.2d at 839, 842. Here, the record\r\ndemonstrates Williams was not upset and the officers were not confrontational\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\nEvidence supports the trial court's finding Williams was not in custody before he\r\nwas given his Miranda warnings. He came to the Department voluntarily; his\r\nmother and young daughter were waiting for him; he wanted to get the matter\r\ntaken care of before leaving the state for a wedding the following day; he talked\r\nwith the detectives about Victim's injuries for fifteen to twenty minutes before he\r\nwas given Miranda warnings; he never asked if he could leave or asked for\r\nanything; and the conversation leading to his incriminating statements included\r\ninformation about where he was from and his background. Therefore, evidence\r\nsupports the trial court's finding Williams was not in custody and thus Miranda\r\nwas not violated. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's admission of Williams's\r\nstatements.\r\n\nII.   Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on\r\nthe unlawful conduct towards a child charge because he was not a person\r\nresponsible for the child's welfare. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with\r\nthe existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.\" State v. Weston, 367\r\nS.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). When reviewing a trial court's denial\r\nof a defendant's motion for a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the\r\nevidence in a light most favorable to the State. State v. Venters, 300 S.C. 260, 264,\r\n387 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1990). Additionally, an appellate court must find a case is\r\nproperly submitted to the jury if any direct evidence or any substantial\r\ncircumstantial evidence reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused.\r\nWeston, 367 S.C. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\n\r\n             It is unlawful for a person who has charge or custody of a\r\n             child, or who is the parent or guardian of a child, or who\r\n             is responsible for the welfare of a child as defined in\r\n             [s]ection 63-7-20 to:\r\n             (1) place the child at unreasonable risk of harm affecting\r\n             the child's life, physical or mental health, or safety;\r\n             (2) do or cause to be done unlawfully or maliciously any\r\n             bodily harm to the child so that the life or health of the\r\n             child is endangered or likely to be endangered; or\r\n             (3) wilfully abandon the child.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-5-70(A) (2010).\r\n\r\nSection 63-7-20(16) of the South Carolina Code (2010) provides:\r\n\r\n             \"Person responsible for a child's welfare\" includes the\r\n             child's parent, guardian, foster parent, an operator,\r\n             employee, or caregiver, as defined by [s]ection 63-13-20,\r\n             of a public or private residential home, institution,\r\n             agency, or childcare facility or an adult who has assumed\r\n             the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for the\r\n             child, but who does not necessarily have legal custody of\r\n             the child. A person whose only role is as a caregiver and\r\n\n             whose contact is only incidental with a child, such as a\r\n             babysitter or a person who has only incidental contact but\r\n             may not be a caretaker, has not assumed the role or\r\n             responsibility of a parent or guardian.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err in denying Williams's motion for a directed verdict.\r\nWilliams and Victim's mother had been dating for four months, and he stayed\r\novernight with them between two and four nights a week. Williams and Victim's\r\nmother had discussed moving in together once Victim's mother finished school.\r\nShe testified he wanted to be a stepfather to Victim. She would ask him to tell\r\nVictim to stop if she was doing something wrong. Williams would instruct Victim\r\nverbally but was not allowed to physically discipline her. He had changed Victim's\r\ndiaper before and would watch her while her mother was cooking. He had also\r\nbathed her before with Victim's mother in the house. He had watched her before\r\nwith other adults or other children present. Williams's involvement in Victim's life\r\nwas some evidence that he has assumed the role of a parent. Accordingly, the trial\r\ncourt did not err in denying the motion for the directed verdict. Therefore, we\r\naffirm the trial court's denial of the directed verdict motion.\r\n\r\nIII.   Admission of Photographs\r\n\r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred in admitting enlarged anatomical diagrams\r\nand photographs of the victim. We disagree.\r\n\r\nTo preserve an issue regarding the admissibility of evidence, a contemporaneous\r\nobjection must be made. State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 499, 552 S.E.2d\r\n284, 286 (2001). The failure to object to photographs at the time they are offered\r\nwaives the right to object to them on appeal. Ramos v. Hawley, 316 S.C. 534, 536,\r\n451 S.E.2d 27, 28 (Ct. App. 1994). However, once the trial court has ruled on an\r\nobjection, counsel does not need to object every time the issue arises. Bennett v.\r\nState, 383 S.C. 303, 308, 680 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2009) (stating because the trial\r\ncourt had already ruled on an issue, trial counsel did not need to renew objection);\r\nsee also Rule 17, SCRCrimP (\"If an objection has once been made at any stage to\r\nthe admission of evidence, it shall not be necessary thereafter to reserve rights\r\nconcerning the objectionable evidence.\").\r\n\n\"The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\nbe reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\" Pagan, 369 S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d at\r\n265. \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either\r\nlack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.\" Id. \"[E]vidence\r\nshould be excluded when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial\r\neffect.\" State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 177, 460 S.E.2d 368, 370 (1995).\r\n\r\n             Demonstrative evidence includes items such as a\r\n             photograph, chart, diagram, or video animation that\r\n             explains or summarizes other evidence and testimony.\r\n             Such evidence has secondary relevance to the issues at\r\n             hand; it is not directly relevant, but must rely on other\r\n             material testimony for relevance. Demonstrative\r\n             evidence is distinguishable from exhibits that comprise\r\n             \"real\" or substantive evidence, such as the actual murder\r\n             weapon or a written document containing allegedly\r\n             defamatory statements.\r\n\r\nClark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 383, 529 S.E.2d 528, 535 (2000). In Kelley, the\r\ncourt found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting hand-drawn\r\noutlines of a victim's face and body, showing numerous wounds, because they\r\ncorroborated the pathologist's testimony. 319 S.C. at 177, 460 S.E.2d at 370.\r\n\r\n\"The relevance, materiality, and admissibility of photographs are matters within\r\nthe sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a\r\nshowing of an abuse of discretion.\" State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 249, 669\r\nS.E.2d 598, 607 (Ct. App. 2008). The trial court must balance the prejudicial\r\neffect of graphic photographs against their probative value, and that decision\r\nshould be reversed only in exceptional circumstances. Id. at 249-50, 669 S.E.2d at\r\n607. \"Admitting photographs which serve to corroborate testimony is not an abuse\r\nof discretion. However, photographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or\r\nprejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are irrelevant or not necessary to\r\nsubstantiate material facts or conditions.\" Id. at 250, 669 S.E.2d at 607 (citations\r\nomitted). \"To constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must create a tendency\r\nto suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an\r\nemotional one.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). A trial court is not\r\nrequired to exclude relevant evidence simply because it is unpleasant or offensive.\r\nId.\r\n\nWilliams only objected to the admission of the anatomical diagram enlargements\r\n(State's Exhibits 9, 10, and 11). He did not object to the admission of any of the\r\nphotographs.5 He contends that any objection to the photographs was futile in light\r\nof the trial court's ruling on the diagrams. We disagree. The photographs and\r\nanatomical diagrams are not the same thing. He objected to each of the diagrams.\r\nHe needed to object to at least the first picture to be able to argue that further\r\nobjections would be futile. Therefore, the admission of the photographs is not\r\npreserved for our review because Williams did not object to their admission.\r\n\r\nAs to the diagrams, the nurse used them to point out Victim's injuries.\r\nAccordingly, they were relevant and corroborated her testimony. They were not\r\ngraphic at all; they were simply black and white diagrams of a child's head, body,\r\nand vagina. They did not have any prejudicial effect. Therefore, the trial court did\r\nnot err in admitting the diagrams.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe trial court's admission of Williams's statements, denial of the directed verdict\r\nmotion, and admission of the photographs and diagrams are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5   Williams submitted State's Exhibits 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, and 20 to this court.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5162","title":"Town of Kingstree v.

We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 1879, John T. Nelson purchased a substantial amount of property in the Town\r\nbut could not obtain the title until he turned twenty-one years old. In 1899, he\r\nacquired the title. In 1903, he had the land platted, which showed twenty lots that\r\nwere to be sold along a road that became known as Ashton Avenue and a road or\r\nalley1 between Lots 13 and 14. In 1909, he sold Lots 13 and 14 to two separate\r\nbuyers. Both deeds indicated the street between them was \"a new Street\" or \"a\r\nNew Side Street.\" Nelson retained the land to the South of the lots, and Marie L.\r\nNelson inherited this land from her father in 1938. In 1981, John McIntosh\r\ninherited this land from Marie.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Appellants purchased a 20.97-acre tract of property from McIntosh, which\r\nwas part of the land he inherited from Marie. At the same time, Appellants also\r\nacquired from McIntosh a fifty-foot easement from Ashton Avenue to Nelson\r\nBoulevard. The easement stated that the property Appellants purchased was\r\n\"bounded on the West by a proposed fifty (50) foot street or road know as Porter\r\nStreet.\" Further, the easement stated, \"Whereas the lands on the Western side of\r\nproposed road or street known as Porter Street were devised by Marie L. Nelson to\r\nthe trustees under her last Will and Testament as will appear by reference to the\r\n\r\n1   This area is now known as Porter Street and is the area at issue.\r\n\nsame and whereas said devise may have included the proposed fifty (50) foot road\r\nor street known as Porter Street . . . .\" The easement specified: \"said proposed fifty\r\n(50) foot road or street should be opened and remain open for the mutual use and\r\nbenefit of the owners of the lands of the Estate of Marie L. Nelson now held in\r\ntrust and the owners of the twenty and ninety-seven hundredths (20.97) acres this\r\nday conveyed to [Appellants].\" The easement further stated:\r\n\r\n             The grantor does agree that the grantee, their heirs or\r\n             assigns may take such steps and make such\r\n             improvements as may be necessary to have said street or\r\n             road opened and maintained as a public street or road and\r\n             that grantor will assist in such endeavor and that said\r\n             street or road when opened shall be for the mutual use\r\n             and benefit of the owners of property lying on either side\r\n             of the same.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, several of the charities to which Marie had devised property in the same\r\narea sold their land to the Town in order for the Town to build a recreation\r\ncomplex. Part of Porter Street was within the boundaries of the land sold.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Waccamaw Housing, Inc. agreed to purchase 2.15 acres of Appellants'\r\nproperty for a senior citizens housing project, contingent upon the zoning for the\r\narea being changed from highway commercial to planned unit development.\r\nNehemiah Corporation on behalf of Waccamaw requested the rezoning of the\r\nproperty. On January 26, 2004, at the town council meeting, the Town had a first\r\nreading on the rezoning. Alice's husband, W. N. Kellahan, Jr.,2 was present. After\r\na council member indicated he had received calls from residents concerned about\r\nthe development, the council decided to have a public hearing before the second\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe council held the public hearing on February 20, 2004, and discussed\r\npedestrian traffic. Kellahan was unable to attend the public hearing and second\r\nreading because he was out of town. He and Senator John Yancey McGill had\r\ndiscussed that he would be absent. A council member asked if the developer was\r\nwilling to close Porter Street on the Ashton Avenue side. J.W. Campbell\r\n\r\n2Kellahan managed the acquisition, management, development, and sale of\r\nAppellants' property. He is a civil and structural engineer licensed in North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, and Georgia for engineering and surveying.\r\n\nresponded that would only stop vehicle traffic, not pedestrian traffic. Senator\r\nMcGill made a recommendation for a second reading of the ordinance with the\r\nunderstanding that Porter Street would be closed permanently from Ashton Avenue\r\nand a barricade and fence would be erected. The second reading of the rezoning\r\nimmediately followed at a special meeting of town council. The council approved\r\nthe ordinance to rezone the property with the amendment that Porter Street be\r\nblocked on the Ashton Avenue side. The minutes provided that Kellahan would\r\nfence his property line to within fifty feet of Highway 377, which Kellahan did.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 2004, Waccamaw purchased the 2.15-acre tract from Appellants.\r\nConstruction of the housing project began within sixty days of the zoning change\r\napproval and took approximately one year to complete.\r\n\r\nOn November 14, 2005, the Town filed a petition for abandonment and closure of\r\nthe area. The Town named Appellants, Gary W. Chapman, Jr., Terilyn J. McClary,\r\nthe South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT), and Waccamaw as\r\ndefendants. McClary and Chapman, who at the time owned the two lots that\r\nbordered the area at issue, Lots 13 and 14, did not answer and were held in\r\ndefault.3 Both SCDOT and Waccamaw filed answers stating they had no objection\r\nto the closing. SCDOT stated Porter Street \"is not shown as part of the State\r\nHighway System. SCDOT records do not find any file or documents for this\r\nsection of road.\" Appellants filed an answer and counterclaim, requesting the\r\npetition be dismissed and if it was not, asking for just compensation for the\r\ntermination of their rights to their easement based on a reduction in value to their\r\nproperty. The circuit court referred the matter to the special referee.\r\n\r\nFollowing a hearing, the special referee ordered a portion of Porter Street be\r\nclosed. The referee found the Town and Appellants \"have unequivocally agreed\r\nthat Porter Street would be used as a public road. Public funds were used for the\r\npaving of Porter Street and the original easement conveyed to [Appellants]\r\nunderscores the desire to have the street opened and used for their benefit and\r\nmembers of the public.\" Additionally, the special referee found an agency\r\nrelationship was established between Appellants and Senator McGill and thus,\r\nAppellants were bound by the deal brokered by Town Council with the input of\r\nSenator McGill. The referee also determined the closing would not affect\r\n\r\n\r\n3Both of them later sold their lots, and the subsequent owners are in favor of the\r\nclosure of the property.\r\n\nemergency vehicles because they have other means of access and the part of the\r\nstreet to be closed was not in use. Further, the referee found:\r\n\r\n             Porter Street is owned by the Town . . . as evidenced by\r\n             the deeds for the purchase of the land for the recreation\r\n             complex, the negotiated agreement to rezone the property\r\n             to permit the housing project, and the paving of a\r\n             substantial portion of Porter Street using public funds.\r\n             Although there was never a public dedication of Porter\r\n             Street, Porter Street has been used by the public and all\r\n             of the street except the length of one lot has been paved\r\n             using public CTC funds which benefitted [Appellants].\r\n             Porter Street is therefore by the agreement and the\r\n             actions of the parties to this litigation a public street.\r\n\r\nThe special referee further noted the deed from Appellants to Waccamaw did not\r\ncontain an easement, evidencing that Porter Street was public. Additionally, the\r\nreferee determined the closing would be in the best interests of the citizens and\r\nresidents of the surrounding area and the Town, including abutting property\r\nowners and interested parties, and would not be prejudicial to abutting property\r\nowners or interested parties. The referee found the determination of the scope of\r\nan easement was one in equity and thus, found Appellants' counterclaim should be\r\ndenied because they purchased the easement for the purpose of making Porter\r\nStreet a public road. The special referee ordered the title for the property that was\r\nclosed to be split equally between the owner of lots 13 and 14. On November 4,\r\n2010, Appellants filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rules 59(e) and 60,\r\nSCRCP.\r\n\r\nThe special referee denied the motion to alter or amend, finding: \"Porter Street is a\r\npublically dedicated road which has been delineated on a number of plats since\r\n1903. It was expressly dedicated to the public when the 1903 subdivision plat was\r\nrecorded.\" The referee further found, \"The public later accepted that dedication by\r\nusing the roadway, albeit light use. Porter Street was dedicated to the public and\r\naccepted by the public prior to the easement granted by Samuel McIntosh to\r\n[Appellants].\" The referee further found that \"[e]ven if the portion of the road was\r\nnot dedicated and accepted by the public, there is strict, cogent[,] and evincing\r\nconvincing evidence that [Appellants] dedicated the easement to the public making\r\nit a public road.\" The referee found the grant contained a dedication by writing\r\nwhen it stated \"'proposed fifty (50) foot road or street should be opened and remain\r\n\nopen for the mutual use and benefit of the owners of the lands of the Estate of\r\nMarie L. Nelson' . . . and . . . 'the parties have agreed that efforts should be made to\r\nhave [Porter] street opened and used for their benefit and members of the public\r\nwho may need to use the same.'\" (alterations by special referee). The special\r\nreferee found pavement of the road was not a requirement for a dedication.\r\n\r\nThe special referee also found Appellants conveyed the land that adjoined the\r\neasement for the senior citizens housing developments without expressly retaining\r\nany easement rights. Additionally, he found Appellants knew the rezoning was\r\napproved based on the closing of an unpaved portion of the road. The referee\r\ntherefore determined Appellants intended to abandon the easement and not retain\r\nany rights to the roadway.\r\n\r\nThe special referee found Porter Street could be closed pursuant to section 57-9-10\r\nof the South Carolina Code. The referee determined the Town established Porter\r\nStreet was a street used for vehicular travel and it had a right to close the street.\r\nThe referee found Michael Kirby, the Community Planning and Development\r\nDirector for the Town, testified it would be in the best interests of the residents of\r\nthe Town that the street be closed. The referee also stated that one of the adjacent\r\nlandowners testified \"'people would just drive through all the time'\" and vehicles\r\nhad used the road since 1997 or 1998. The special referee found, \"The closing of\r\nthe portion of Porter Street is for the safety of landowners in the area, the public,\r\nand Town property.\" The referee stated, \"The closing of Porter Street decreases\r\nfoot and automobile traffic to the rear of the Recreation Center, and to the\r\nresidential neighborhood located behind the Recreation Center. The Town has\r\nprovided sufficient proof that the closing of Porter Street is in the best interests of\r\nthe residents of the Town.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, the special referee determined because the land was dedicated to the\r\npublic, Appellants were \"not entitled to compensation as they have lost the ability\r\nto control the future use of the property.\" The referee noted McIntosh did not have\r\nan easement to grant Appellants, or if he did, the grant was dedicated to the public\r\nand was accepted.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the special referee found although the defense of estoppel was not\r\nincluded as a defense in the Town's reply to Appellants' counterclaim, the issue\r\nwas raised, thus allowing it to be considered. The referee found an agency\r\nrelationship was established between Appellants and Senator McGill because\r\nKellahan testified he had sent Senator McGill to represent his interest and the\r\n\nintent of the principal determines whether an agency relationship exists. The\r\nreferee found Senator McGill understood that a portion of Porter Street would be\r\nclosed permanently to allow for the rezoning. \"The representation that this portion\r\nof Porter Street would be permanently closed was made so that Town Council\r\nwould agree to the rezoning. This representation would be reasonably calculated\r\nto induce the Town to act, and it did so.\" The referee found Appellants were able\r\nto sell a portion of their property because of the agreement \"and are estopped from\r\narguing that they do not want the unpaved section of Porter Street closed, or in the\r\nalternative, that they should be compensated for the extinguishment of their\r\neasement.\" This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Easement Issues and Dedication\r\n\r\nAppellants argue because they had an express written easement across the area in\r\nquestion, which had not been abandoned, the Town was not entitled to close the\r\narea and they are entitled to continued and unrestricted use of the area for access.\r\nThey maintain the Town failed to plead or prove they abandoned the easement.\r\nAdditionally, they assert the area in question was not dedicated as a public\r\nroadway or street and as such, the Town is not entitled to close the area, preventing\r\nAppellants from having access and use of the area to access their property. Finally,\r\nAppellants argue the evidence does not support the special referee's finding they\r\npurchased the easement to make Porter Street a public road. It maintains the\r\nlanguage in the easement is clear that the road is proposed. We agree.\r\n\r\nAn easement is a right to use the land of another for a specific purpose. Steele v.\r\nWilliams, 204 S.C. 124, 132, 28 S.E.2d 644, 647 (1944). This right of way may\r\narise by grant,4 from necessity, by prescription, or by implication by prior use.\r\nBoyd v. Bellsouth Tel. Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410, 416, 633 S.E.2d 136, 139 (2006);\r\nSteele, 204 S.C. at 132, 28 S.E.2d at 647-48. \"A grant of an easement is to be\r\nconstrued in accordance with the rules applied to deeds and other written\r\ninstruments.\" Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist. of Fountain\r\n\r\n\r\n4 \"A reservation of an easement in a deed by which lands are conveyed is\r\nequivalent, for the purpose of the creation of the easement, to an express grant of\r\nthe easement by the grantee of the lands.\" Sandy Island Corp. v. Ragsdale, 246\r\nS.C. 414, 419, 143 S.E.2d 803, 806 (1965).\r\n\nInn, 348 S.C. 58, 71, 558 S.E.2d 902, 909 (Ct. App. 2001) (quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\n\"The determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law\r\naction and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by a judge\r\nwithout a jury.\" Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006)\r\n(quotation marks omitted). \"In a law case tried by the judge without a jury, this\r\ncourt reviews for errors of law and reviews factual findings only for evidence\r\nwhich reasonably supports the court's findings.\" Eldridge v. City of Greenwood,\r\n331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n\"However, the determination of the scope of the easement is a question in equity.\"\r\nHardy, 369 S.C. at 165, 631 S.E.2d at 541. On appeal in an action in equity, the\r\nappellate court may find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of\r\nthe evidence. Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834 (2005).\r\nThus, this court may reverse a factual finding by the trial court in such cases when\r\nthe appellant satisfies us the finding is against the preponderance of the evidence.\r\nCampbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 263, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2004). This\r\ndoes not require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the trial court,\r\nwhich saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility. Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291\r\n(2000). Furthermore, the appellant is not relieved of the burden of convincing this\r\ncourt the trial court committed error in its findings. Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C.\r\n382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).\r\n\r\n\"One claiming title by deed has no greater title than the original grantor in the\r\nchain of title upon which he relies.\" Hoogenboom v. City of Beaufort, 315 S.C.\r\n306, 313, 433 S.E.2d 875, 880 (Ct. App. 1992); see also Belue v. Fetner, 251 S.C.\r\n600, 606, 164 S.E.2d 753, 755 (1968) (holding a deed cannot convey an interest\r\nthe grantor does not have).\r\n\r\n\"Any interested person, the State[,] or any of its political subdivisions or agencies\r\nmay petition a court of competent jurisdiction to abandon or close any street,\r\nroad[,] or highway whether opened or not.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 57-9-10 (Supp.\r\n2012).       By creating a formal judicial procedure for terminating a\r\n             public right of way over land, [Section 57-9-10] removes\r\n             the uncertainty attending the common law of dedication\r\n\n            and abandonment. It also ameliorates the rigor of the\r\n            common law rule requiring strict proof of intent to\r\n            abandon a public right of way before that right can be\r\n            extinguished.\r\n\r\nS.C. Dep't of Transp. v. Hinson Family Holdings, LLC, 361 S.C. 649, 655, 606\r\nS.E.2d 781, 784 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration by court).\r\n\r\n            \"Highway\", \"street\", or \"road\" are general terms denoting\r\n            a public way for the purpose of vehicular travel,\r\n            including the entire area within the right-of-way, and the\r\n            terms shall include roadways, pedestrian facilities,\r\n            bridges, tunnels, viaducts, drainage structures, and all\r\n            other facilities commonly considered component parts of\r\n            highways, streets, or roads.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 57-3-120(1) (2006).\r\n\r\n            Under [s]ection 57-9-20, the court is empowered to close\r\n            roads on a finding that it is in the best interest of all\r\n            concerned. A public street may not be vacated for the\r\n            sole purpose of benefiting an abutting owner. However,\r\n            the mere fact that the vacation was at the instigation of an\r\n            individual who owns abutting property does not\r\n            invalidate the vacation or constitute abuse of discretion,\r\n            nor does the fact that some private interest may be served\r\n            incidentally. On the other hand, it must appear clearly\r\n            that no consideration other than that of public interest\r\n            could have prompted the action.\r\n\r\nFirst Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229, 417 S.E.2d\r\n592, 593-94 (1992) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\"The determination of whether a roadway has been dedicated to the public is an\r\naction in equity.\" Mack v.

App.\r\n1995). \"As such, we have jurisdiction on appeal to find facts in accordance with\r\nour own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" Id. \"Dedication requires two\r\nelements. First, the owner must express in a positive and unmistakable manner the\r\nintention to dedicate his property to public use. Second, there must be, within a\r\n\nreasonable time, an express or implied public acceptance of the property offered\r\nfor dedication.\" Id. (citation omitted). \"[T]he burden of proof to establish\r\ndedication is upon the party claiming it.\" Anderson v.

The\r\ncourt found this gave rise to the inference the grantor intended to retain ownership.\r\nId. at 477-78, 556 S.E.2d at 697. The court noted that although the plat may have\r\ncreated a private right of easement between the grantor and the purchasers, \"the\r\nfact that [the grantor] allowed this small group to use the road did not vest any\r\nrights in the public at large or convey an offer of the road to the county.\" Id. at\r\n478, 556 S.E.2d at 697. The court recognized \"[t]here is a clearly defined\r\ndistinction between the rights acquired by the public through dedication effected\r\nby platting and sale, and the private rights acquired by the grantees by virtue of the\r\ngrant or covenant contained in a deed which refers to a plat, or bounds the property\r\nupon a street through the grantor's lands. Id.

The court concluded \"a plat alone is not determinative of\r\nimplied dedication whe[n] there is evidence of the grantor's contrary intent.\" Id.\r\n\"When property is subdivided and sold according to a plat showing streets or\r\nroads, the grantees acquire a private easement in the streets, but the easement does\r\nnot become a public easement until there has been an express or implied\r\nacceptance of the dedication, evidenced either by general public use or by acts of\r\nthe public authorities.\" Id. at 478-79, 556 S.E.2d at 698 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).

City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307\r\nS.C. 24, 27, 413 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1992).

Lewin, 141 A.2d\r\n151, 155 (Md. Ct. App. 1958).

The dedicator is presumed to\r\n             have intended the property to be used by the public,\r\n             within the limitations of the dedication, in such way as is\r\n\n             most convenient and comfortable and according to not\r\n             only the properties and usages known at the time of the\r\n             dedication, but also to those justified by lapse of time and\r\n             change of conditions.\r\n\r\nId.

The intention to abandon\r\n             need not appear by express declaration, but may be\r\n             inferred from all of the facts and circumstances of the\r\n             case. It may be inferred from the acts and conduct of the\r\n             owner and the nature and situation of the property, where\r\n             there appears some clear and unmistakable affirmative\r\n             act or series of acts clearly indicating, either a present\r\n             intent to relinquish the easement, or purpose inconsistent\r\n             with its further existence.\r\n\r\nCarolina Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 109, 217 S.E.2d 16, 21 (1975). The\r\nburden of proof is upon the party asserting abandonment to show the abandonment\r\nby clear and unequivocable evidence. Id. Mere nonuse of an easement created by\r\ndeed will not amount to an abandonment. Witt v. Poole, 182 S.C. 110, 115, 188\r\nS.E. 496, 498 (1936).\r\n\r\nOn the matter of dedication, this court makes findings of fact in accordance with\r\nour own view of the preponderance of the evidence, and the evidence must be\r\nstrict, cogent, and convincing. Mack, 320 S.C. at 239, 464 S.E.2d at 126. The\r\nTown did not present sufficient evidence for the special referee to find there was a\r\ndedication, either in 1903 or 1993. The plat from 1903 simply shows an opening\r\nbetween lots 13 and 14. It is not labeled. When the lots were sold in 1909, the\r\ndeeds referred to that area as a new street. This was not sufficient to show the\r\nintent of John Nelson to dedicate the area. Further, the language in the 1993\r\neasement was not sufficient to dedicate the land to the public. While it states that\r\nefforts should be made for the streets be open to the public, it only demonstrates\r\nAppellants and McIntosh were planning on doing that, not that they had\r\naccomplished it. Kellahan testified that McIntosh informed him when Appellants\r\npurchased the property that the road had not been dedicated. He further testified\r\nthat when purchasing the property, a title search revealed no dedication, which is\r\n\nwhy Appellants requested the easement. Kellahan testified he did not know if\r\nAppellants received a separate tax notice for the area in question. Accordingly, the\r\nTown did not meet its burden of proof to establish a dedication.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Town had to prove the area was accepted by the public. Kellahan\r\ntestified Appellants had previously tried to dedicate the area in question to the\r\nTown but the Town would not accept it. He also testified the area Appellants\r\npurchased was used for agricultural purposes until a few years before the purchase\r\nand it was covered in weeds and broom straw. Kirby testified the area had never\r\nbeen developed as a road until the senior citizens housing was built and thus was\r\nnever used for vehicular traffic. However, he also testified it was used as a dirt\r\nroad entrance and exit one year for a \"Pig Pickin\" held at the recreation center. It\r\nwas not used for that purpose in the following years due to citizens' complaints.\r\nKirby also testified that prior to the recreation center being built, the road had two\r\ndirt lanes and one of those lanes was used to access a telephone substation.\r\n\r\nOne of the owners of the adjacent property testified that before the road was paved,\r\nit was a dirt road and there were little pine trees and \"people would drive through\r\nall the time.\" However, she testified that when she bought her property, although\r\nthe prior owners had told her that people were using the road as a cut through,\r\nthere was no street there and she did not expect people to be driving or walking\r\nthrough the area. She stated it was all forest when she bought the property. She\r\nprovided it is now all dirt, which she had the Town place there due to a mud\r\nproblem. She further testified the Town has not maintained the street.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the other adjacent lot testified that although the road was unpaved\r\nand unimproved, cars had used it since he moved there in 1995. He testified he\r\npreviously believed the street was a lot and tried to purchase it from the Town\r\nbecause of the traffic driving through the area. He stated that he was told at the\r\ncourthouse it was not being used. He testified the area did not look like a street.\r\nFurther, he provided that he used the area as his driveway when he purchased his\r\nhouse because it did not have a driveway. Because the evidence does not establish\r\nit was a public road, the special referee erred in finding for the Town on this issue.\r\n\r\nFurther, when a subdivision is created, the property owners have a private\r\neasement in the roads. When John Nelson originally divided his property, any\r\nlandowner that purchased the property would have an easement regardless of\r\nwhether or not the roads became public. Several cases explicitly state that the\r\npublic easement or dedication does not extinguish the private easement. Further,\r\n\nAppellants' easement from McIntosh stated it was for their use, not just the public's\r\nuse. Therefore, regardless of whether the 1903 plat or Appellants' 1993 purchase\r\nof the easement from McIntosh was a dedication, they still had an easement.\r\nAccordingly, the special referee erred in finding the Town could close the road.\r\n\r\nII.   Allegation in the Pleadings\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the Town was bound by the allegation in its petition that they had\r\nan easement for the use of Porter Street. We find this issue to be unpreserved for\r\nour review.\r\n\r\n\"[B]ut for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address\r\nan issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.\" Lucas v.

The allegations, statements, or admissions\r\n             contained in a pleading are conclusive as against the\r\n             pleader and a party cannot subsequently take a position\r\n             contradictory of, or inconsistent with, his pleadings and\r\n             the facts [that] are admitted by the pleadings are taken as\r\n             true against the pleader for the purpose of the action.\r\n\r\nPostal v. Mann, 308 S.C. 385, 387, 418 S.E.2d 322, 323 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\n\r\nThis issue was first discussed at the hearing on Appellants' motion to alter or\r\namend. The referee asked, \"[T]here is no question that [Appellants] had an\r\neasement, right[?]\" Appellants responded:\r\n\r\n             [T]hat's what I thought. The allegation is in the\r\n             Complaint, the Petition, stated that. I think on page 11\r\n             and 18, the arguments in that second hearing, [the Town]\r\n             said that they were the easement owners. In the Reply\r\n             Memorandum I got some indication that there was now a\r\n             claim that there was a prior dedication, and the easement\r\n             was no longer there. I'm just kind of amazed by that.\r\n\r\nLater, Appellants stated:\r\n\n              I'm not clear as to whether or not based on the pleadings\r\n              it stated [Appellants] have an easement, and the record\r\n              on page 11, says there is a recorded easement to\r\n              [Appellants] which is the subject of this. We are asking\r\n              that the easement be extinguished for a little portion at\r\n              the end, and then on page 18 I think it is. [The Town] is\r\n              again talking about the [T]own's property, pled and\r\n              notified all adjoining property owners and also notified\r\n              them talking about [Appellants]. The easement owners\r\n              have specifically pled that they were easement owners,\r\n              and when I read their Reply, the Opposition\r\n              memorandum, I got there was a question whether or not\r\n              it was a valid easement.\r\n\r\nAppellants seemed to be arguing the Town admitted they had an easement in its\r\npetition to close the road.5 However, at the hearing they did not cite to any case\r\nlaw or specifically state the Town should be bound by its statement. In their\r\nproposed order granting their motion for reconsideration they submitted to the\r\nreferee, they stated, \"The [Town], in its Petition, specifically states that\r\n[Appellants] have an easement. The statement is a clear, unequivocal admission\r\nby the plaintiff, without any qualification. There is no testimony, no other\r\npleading or any other action by the [Town] to retract this admission in any\r\nmanner.\" However, the special referee never ruled on it. If an issue has been\r\nraised at trial, and the trial court fails to rule on it, and it is raised again in a motion\r\nfor reconsideration, the issue is preserved for appellate review even if the trial\r\ncourt does not rule on it. See Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 565-66, 633\r\nS.E.2d 505, 510 (2006). Here, that was not the case, as the issue was not raised\r\nuntil the hearing on the motion for reconsideration. The special referee did not rule\r\non the issue in the order denying Appellants' motion to alter or amend, and\r\nAppellants did not file a subsequent motion for reconsideration. In Coward Hund\r\nConstruction Co. v. Ball Corp., this court distinguished when an issue is first raised\r\nat trial and when one is not raised until after trial. 336 S.C. 1, 4-5, 518 S.E.2d 56,\r\n58 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Payton v. Kearse, 319 S.C. 188, 460 S.E.2d 220 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998)). The\r\n\r\n5At the close of the hearing on the petition to close the road, the Town stated,\r\n\"There is a recorded easement into [Appellants] which is the subject of this, and we\r\nare asking that that easement be extinguished for that little portion at the end.\"\r\n\nissue in the present case did not arise until the special referee issued its order.\r\nTherefore, because Appellants did not make a motion for reconsideration when the\r\nspecial referee failed rule on it, it is not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\nIII.   Estoppel and Agency\r\n\r\nAppellants allege the Town failed to plead or prove Appellants were estopped to\r\nobject to the closing of the area in question because it maintained Senator McGill\r\nwas serving as their agent at the meeting when the closure was suggested. We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\"[E]stoppel must be affirmatively pled as a defense and cannot be bootstrapped\r\nonto another claim.\" Collins Entm't, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 562, 611 S.E.2d\r\n262, 270 (Ct. App. 2005). \"The failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a\r\nwaiver of the right to assert it.\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 21, 640 S.E.2d 486,\r\n497 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nThe elements of equitable estoppel for \"the party claiming the estoppel are: (1) lack\r\nof knowledge and of means of knowledge of truth as to facts in question; (2)\r\nreliance upon conduct of the party estopped; and (3) prejudicial change in\r\nposition.\" Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 589, 553 S.E.2d 110,\r\n114 (2001). The elements as to the party estopped are: (1) conduct by the party\r\nestopped amounting to a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2)\r\nthe intention such conduct be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or\r\nconstructive knowledge of the true facts. Id. \"The burden of proof is upon the\r\nparty who asserts an estoppel.\" Blue Ridge Realty Co. v. Williamson, 247 S.C.\r\n112, 122, 145 S.E.2d 922, 927 (1965).\r\n\r\n\"A true agency relationship may be established by evidence of actual or apparent\r\nauthority.\" R & G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424,\r\n432, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The doctrine of apparent authority\r\nfocuses on the principal's manifestation to a third party that the agent has certain\r\nauthority.\" Id. \"[T]he principal is bound by the acts of its agent when it has placed\r\nthe agent in such a position that persons of ordinary prudence, reasonably\r\nknowledgeable with business usages and customs, are led to believe the agent has\r\ncertain authority and they in turn deal with the agent based on that assumption.\"\r\nId. \"Thus, the concept of apparent authority depends upon manifestations by the\r\nprincipal to a third party and the reasonable belief by the third party that the agent\r\nis authorized to bind the principal.\" Id. at 432, 540 S.E.2d at 118.\r\n\nAn agency may not be established solely by the declarations and conduct of an\r\nalleged agent. WDI Meredith & Co. v. Am. Telesis, Inc., 359 S.C. 474, 479, 597\r\nS.E.2d 885, 887 (Ct. App. 2004). \"Apparent authority must be established based\r\nupon manifestations by the principal, not the agent. The proper focus in\r\ndetermining a claim of apparent authority is not on the relationship between the\r\nprincipal and the agent, but on that between the principal and the third party.\" R &\r\nG Constr., 343 S.C. at 432-33, 540 S.E.2d at 118 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n             Apparent authority to do an act is created as to a third\r\n             person by written or spoken words or any other conduct\r\n             of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the\r\n             third person to believe the principal consents to have the\r\n             act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for\r\n             him.\r\n\r\nId. at 433, 540 S.E.2d at 118. \"Either the principal must intend to cause the third\r\nperson to believe the agent is authorized to act for him, or he should realize his\r\nconduct is likely to create such belief.\" WDI Meredith, 359 S.C. at 478-79, 597\r\nS.E.2d at 887. To establish apparent agency, a party must prove the purported\r\nprincipal has represented another to be his agent by either affirmative conduct or\r\nconscious and voluntary inaction. Watkins v. Mobil Oil Corp., 291 S.C. 62, 67,\r\n352 S.E.2d 284, 287 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\n\"The elements of apparent agency are: (1) purported principal consciously or\r\nimpliedly represented another to be his agent; (2) third party reasonably relied on\r\nthe representation; and (3) third party detrimentally changed his or her position in\r\nreliance on the representation.\" R & G Constr., 343 S.C. at 433, 540 S.E.2d at 118.\r\n\"In the principal and agent relationship, apparent authority is considered to be a\r\npower which a principal holds his agent out as possessing or permits him to\r\nexercise under such circumstances as to preclude a denial of its existence.\" Id.\r\n\"When a principal, by any such acts or conduct, has knowingly caused or permitted\r\nanother to appear to be his agent, either generally or for a particular purpose, he\r\nwill be estopped to deny such agency to the injury of third persons who have in\r\ngood faith and in the exercise of reasonable prudence dealt with the agent on the\r\nfaith of such appearances.\" Id. \"A principal creates apparent authority as to a third\r\nperson by the principal's written or spoken words or any other conduct which,\r\nreasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe the principal consents to\r\nhave the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\" WDI\r\n\nMeredith, 359 S.C. at 478, 597 S.E.2d at 887 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\"The apparent authority of an agent results from conduct or other manifestations of\r\nthe principal's consent, whereby third persons are justified in believing the agent is\r\nacting within his authority.\" R & G Constr., 343 S.C. at 433-34, 540 S.E.2d at\r\n118. \"Such authority is implied where the principal passively permits the agent to\r\nappear to a third person to have the authority to act on his behalf.\" Id. at 434, 540\r\nS.E.2d at 118. \"Generally, agency is a question of fact.\" Id. \"Agency may be\r\nimplied or inferred and may be proved circumstantially by the conduct of the\r\npurported agent exhibiting a pretense of authority with the knowledge of the\r\nalleged principal.\" Id.\r\n\r\nInitially, Appellants are correct the Town was barred from asserting estoppel\r\nbecause it failed to plead it. Further, the special referee erred in finding Appellants\r\nwere estopped due to Senator McGill being their agent.\r\n\r\nKirby testified nothing indicated Senator McGill attended the meeting on\r\nAppellants' behalf. Kellahan testified Senator McGill went to the meeting for him\r\nbecause he was going to be out of town but they had no discussion about closing\r\nthe road. On cross-examination, he testified he sent Senator McGill to represent\r\nhis interest. On redirect, he testified he never authorized Senator McGill to offer to\r\nclose the road on his behalf and the closing of the road had not been discussed at\r\nthe previous meeting. Senator McGill testified he attended the meeting because he\r\nwas interested in having senior citizens housing in Kingstree. He testified\r\nAppellants and Kellahan did not authorize him to take any action on their behalf at\r\nthe meetings. He further testified he participated in the meetings because he\r\nbelieved his constituents needed more senior housing.\r\n\r\nThe Town did not establish Senator McGill was Appellants' apparent agent. The\r\ncrux of apparent agency is that the principal holds out to a third party the agent is\r\nacting on his or her behalf. Although Kellahan testified he sent Senator McGill to\r\nrepresent his interests, nothing from the minutes of the meeting or the testimony,\r\nincluding Kirby's, indicates anyone at the meetings thought Senator McGill was\r\nacting on Appellants' behalf. Accordingly, the special referee erred in finding\r\nAppellants should be estopped from contesting the road closing.\r\n\r\nVI.    Other Issues\r\n\r\nAppellants also contend the Town lacked statutory authority to petition to close the\r\narea in question, the Town failed to prove the closure of the area in question was in\r\n\nthe best interest of all concerned, and the closure of Porter Street constituted a\r\ntaking and Appellants are entitled to just compensation in the amount of $100,000.\r\nBecause we find the special referee erred in closing the road, we need not decide\r\nthese issues. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review\r\nremaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\nappeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the special referee's order is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5138","title":"Chase Home Finance v.

Ronald Stanley, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nTHOMAS, J.: Chase Home Finance, LLC (Chase) sought to foreclose a mortgage\r\non property owned by Cassandra S. Risher (Cassandra) and her late husband,\r\nSidney Allan Risher (Sidney). The Lexington County Master-In-Equity allowed\r\nChase to proceed against Sidney's undivided one-half interest, but refused to allow\r\nforeclosure of Cassandra's interest. Chase appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn June 17, 2008, Cassandra and Sidney entered into a contract to purchase a\r\nresidence in Lexington County for $505,000. After signing the sales contract,\r\nSidney met with a loan officer at Midland Mortgage Corporation to apply for a\r\nloan. Although Cassandra was present when Sidney met with the loan officer, she\r\ndid not remember completing a loan application or any other paperwork in\r\nconnection with the sale.\r\n\r\nThe closing took place on July 7, 2008. At the closing, Sidney obtained a loan\r\nfrom Midland Mortgage Corporation for $479,750 to finance the purchase of the\r\nproperty and executed a purchase money note in favor of Midland Mortgage\r\nCorporation along with a purchase money mortgage to secure the note. Although\r\nCassandra was present at the closing and both she and Sidney were named on the\r\ndeed, she did not sign either the note or mortgage. The note and mortgage were\r\nsubsequently assigned to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., on July 7, 2008.\r\n\r\nSidney died on August 23, 2009, and Cassandra was appointed personal\r\nrepresentative of his estate. According to probate documents, Sidney's assets\r\nincluded an undivided one-half interest in the residence.\r\n\r\nNo payments were made on the loan since Sidney's death, and the mortgage went\r\ninto default. On February 3, 2010, Chase, as current holder of the note and\r\nmortgage,1 filed this action against Cassandra individually and in her capacities as\r\npersonal representative and legal heir of Sidney's estate.2 In its complaint, Chase\r\nsought (1) foreclosure of its mortgage, (2) the establishment and foreclosure of an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1JPMorgan Chase Bank assigned the note and mortgage to Chase on February 16,\r\n2010, and the assignment was recorded on March 5, 2010.\r\n2Chase also named as defendants several other individuals and the Highland Hills\r\nHomeowners Association. None of these defendants are parties to this appeal.\r\n\nequitable lien on the entire subject property, including Cassandra's one-half\r\ninterest, and (3) a judgment against Cassandra for unjust enrichment.\r\n\r\nCassandra responded on March 5, 2010, denying the substantive allegations of the\r\ncomplaint. Although she acknowledged Chase had a valid mortgage on Sidney's\r\ninterest, she asserted she never mortgaged her undivided one-half interest and\r\nChase should be barred from claiming any lien on the property other than its\r\nmortgage on Sidney's interest.\r\n\r\nPursuant to an order of reference, the Master heard the matter on May 12, 2011.\r\nDuring the hearing, Chase presented the testimony of a real estate paralegal and\r\nlicensed title insurance agent who prepared the closing package for the sale, and\r\nthe attorney who supervised the closing.3 In addition, the record includes excerpts\r\nfrom a deposition that Cassandra gave on October 4, 2010.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 2011, the Master signed an order in which he found (1) the mortgage\r\nexecuted by Sidney was not enforceable against Cassandra's interest in the\r\nproperty, (2) Chase was not entitled to an equitable lien against Cassandra's interest\r\nor judgment against Cassandra under the theory of unjust enrichment, and (3)\r\nChase could proceed with its foreclosure action against Sidney's undivided one-\r\nhalf interest.\r\n\r\nChase moved to alter or amend the Master's order. The Master denied the motion,\r\nand Chase appeals.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nI.\t     Did the Master err in finding that Chase failed to establish an equitable lien\r\n        against Cassandra's undivided one-half interest in the subject property?\r\n\r\nII.\t    Did the Master err in finding Chase could not recover under the South\r\n        Carolina common law remedy of unjust enrichment?\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Did the Master err in citing a case on the federal common law theory of\r\n        unjust enrichment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3The attorney testified he was not present at the closing because he was probably\r\non vacation. According to the appealed order, the paralegal who prepared the\r\nclosing package contacted another attorney to attend the closing.\r\n\nIV.\t   Did the Master err in holding that Chase was not entitled to any form of\r\n       equitable relief?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"An action to establish an equitable lien is an action in equity.\" Fibkins v. Fibkins,\r\n303 S.C. 112, 115, 399 S.E.2d 158, 160 (Ct. App. 1990). Likewise, \"[u]njust\r\nenrichment is an equitable doctrine.\" Dema v. Tenet Physician Servs.-Hilton Head,\r\nInc., 383 S.C. 115, 123, 678 S.E.2d 430, 434 (2009). In an action in equity\r\nreferred to a master for final judgment, an appellate court may find facts according\r\nto its own view of the preponderance of the evidence; however, it is not required to\r\nignore the trial judge's findings. K & A Acquisition Group, LLC v. Island Pointe,\r\nLLC, 383 S.C. 563, 571, 682 S.E.2d 252, 256-57 (2009).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.\t    Equitable Lien\r\n\r\nChase first argues the Master erred in ruling it failed to prove the necessary\r\nelements to establish an equitable lien against Cassandra's interest. Specifically,\r\nChase complains the Master erred in (1) finding Chase failed to show a debt, duty,\r\nor obligation owed by one person to another, (2) requiring Chase to show a specific\r\ndebt owed from Cassandra, (3) finding such a showing of a debt from Cassandra\r\nwas necessary for an equitable lien to attach, (4) requiring Chase to show an\r\n\"expressed affirmative action\" by Cassandra to make Sidney's debt her own debt,\r\n(5) holding that because Cassandra had no obligation to Chase, there was no\r\nproperty on which such an obligation could attach, and (6) finding no evidence of\r\nexpress or implied intent that the entire property serve as collateral to secure the\r\npurchase money loan. We hold the Master correctly determined that Chase did not\r\nestablish an equitable lien against Cassandra's undivided one-half interest in the\r\nsubject property.\r\n\r\n\"An equitable lien or charge is neither an estate or property in the thing itself, nor a\r\nright to recover the thing, but is simply a right of a special nature over the thing,\r\nwhich constitutes a charge upon the thing so that the very thing itself may be\r\nproceeded against in equity for payment of a claim.\" Carolina Attractions, Inc. v.\r\nCourtney, 287 S.C. 140, 145, 337 S.E.2d 244, 247 (Ct. App. 1985). \"'For an\r\nequitable lien to arise, there must be a debt, specific property to which the debt\r\nattaches, and an expressed or implied intent that the property serve as security for\r\npayment of the debt.'\" Regions Bank v. Wingard Props., Inc., 394 S.C. 241, 250,\r\n\n715 S.E.2d 348, 353 (Ct. App. 2011) (quoting First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n of S.C.\r\nv. Finn, 300 S.C. 228, 231, 387 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1989)). Furthermore, \"equity is\r\ngenerally only available when a party is without an adequate remedy at law.\" Nutt\r\nCorp. v. Howell Rd., LLC, 396 S.C. 323, 328, 721 S.E.2d 447, 449 (Ct. App.\r\n2011).\r\n\r\nCiting First Federal Savings and Loan Ass'n of Charleston v. Bailey, 316 S.C. 350,\r\n356, 450 S.E.2d 77, 80-81 (Ct. App. 1994), and Carolina Attractions, Inc. v.\r\nCourtney, 287 S.C. 140, 145, 337 S.E.2d 244, 247 (Ct. App. 1985), the Master\r\ncorrectly stated that \"[i]n order for an equitable lien to arise as to specific property,\r\nthere must be a debt, a duty or obligation owing from one person to another, a res\r\nto which the obligation attaches, which can be described with reasonable certainty,\r\nand an intent, expressed or implied, that the property is to serve as security for the\r\npayment or obligation.\" (emphasis added). If a party seeking an equitable lien\r\ncannot satisfy any one of these requirements, this remedy is not available.\r\n\r\nHere, there is no dispute that Chase had a valid mortgage on Sidney's interest. The\r\nquestion, then, is whether any deficiency remaining after a foreclosure of this\r\nmortgage would attach to Cassandra's interest. In other words, the \"res to which\r\nthe obligation attaches\" was not the entire interest in the subject property, but\r\nCassandra's undivided one-half interest. We agree with the Master that Chase did\r\nnot show the parties had an express or implied intent that Cassandra's interest\r\nwould serve as security for payment of the debt that Sidney incurred.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that Cassandra admitted in a deposition (1) she and Sidney could not\r\nhave purchased the residence without the loan from Midland Mortgage, (2) she\r\nwas aware of the loan, and (3) she benefited from the transaction. Nevertheless,\r\nthese admissions do not warrant a finding that the Rishers and Midland Mortgage\r\nintended that Midland Mortgage or any successor-in-interest could recover against\r\nCassandra's interest in the property for any part of the debt that Sidney's share\r\ncould not satisfy in event of a default. The Master noted the attorney who attended\r\nthe closing did not testify at the hearing; therefore, no information was presented\r\nabout her review of the title examination, the title commitment, the loan closing\r\ninstructions and documents, the deed, and the failure to obtain Cassandra's\r\nsignature on the mortgage. Furthermore, although Cassandra signed several\r\ndocuments at the closing, there is no evidence that she was asked to sign either the\r\nnote or the mortgage. We find particularly significant the Master's concern that no\r\none from Midland Mortgage offered evidence that would have supported Chase's\r\nargument that Midland Mortgage had bargained for more than a mortgage\r\nencumbering only Sidney's interest. Applying our standard of review to the\r\n\nevidence presented, then, we affirm the Master's refusal to find Chase established a\r\nright to an equitable lien on Cassandra's interest.\r\n\r\nChase further suggests that it is entitled to an equitable lien on Cassandra's interest\r\nbecause it held a purchase money mortgage and note on the property. The priority\r\nconferred to the mortgagee of a purchase money mortgage, however, extends only\r\nto \"all other claims or liens arising through the mortgagor.\" SunTrust Bank v.\r\nBryant, 392 S.C. 264, 268, 708 S.E.2d 821, 823 (Ct. App. 2011) (emphasis added)\r\n(quoting Hursey v. Hursey, 284 S.C. 323, 327, 326 S.E.2d 178, 180 (Ct. App.\r\n1985)). Chase further attempts to equate Cassandra's interest with \"a variety of\r\nother non-lien interests arising through the purchase-mortgagor,\" such as dower\r\nrights and homestead claims. Cassandra's interest, however, did not \"arise\"\r\nthrough Sidney or from her status as his wife and widow. Moreover, her interest is\r\nnot a judgment or lien, but an undivided ownership interest in the property that was\r\ngranted to her by the prior owners of the property.\r\n\r\nCiting Home Owners' Loan Corp. v. Cilley, 125 S.W.2d 313 (Tex. App. 1939),\r\nChase further argues that Cassandra, as a tenant-in-common who knew about the\r\nmortgage at its inception and benefited from it, \"agreed\" that the entire property\r\nwould be used as collateral for the loan. We hold Cilley is not applicable to the\r\npresent case. The court in Cilley stated two exceptions to the rule co-tenants\r\ncannot encumber more than their individual shares: \"One is that the act of the\r\ncotenant with reference to the common property must have been previously\r\nauthorized by the nonassenting cotenants, and the other is that it must have been\r\nsubsequently ratified.\" Id. at 316-17 (emphases added). Here, it was not\r\nestablished that Sidney's execution of the note and mortgage was \"with reference to\r\nthe common property\" rather than to solely his undivided one-half interest.\r\nFurthermore, without evidence that Sidney ever encumbered Cassandra's one-half\r\ninterest as well as his own, there was no unauthorized act for Cassandra to ratify.\r\nCf. Lincoln v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 300 S.C. 188, 191, 386 S.E.2d 801, 803 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1989) (noting that ratification, as it relates to the law of agency, requires,\r\namong other elements, \"circumstances or an affirmative election indicating an\r\nintention to adopt the unauthorized arrangements\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nFinally, we agree with Cassandra that Chase has not alleged or proved it lacked an\r\nadequate remedy at law. Although the Master did not discuss the adequacy of a\r\nlegal remedy in detail, he expressly allowed Chase to proceed with its foreclosure\r\naction against Sidney's undivided one-half interest. Here, there was no dispute\r\nChase had a valid mortgage against Sidney's interest and, if necessary, the right to\r\nproceed with a deficiency claim against his estate.\r\n\nII.     Unjust Enrichment\r\n\r\nChase next argues the Master erred in finding it failed to establish the necessary\r\nelements to recover under the South Carolina common law remedy of unjust\r\nenrichment. As a corollary to this argument, Chase takes issue with the Master's\r\nfinding that it did not confer a benefit to Cassandra because she was not a direct\r\nrecipient of the loan. We hold the Master correctly determined that Chase was not\r\nentitled to recovery under the theory of unjust enrichment.\r\n\r\n\"Unjust enrichment is an equitable doctrine, which permits recovery of the amount\r\nthat the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.\"\r\nRegions Bank, 394 S.C. at 256-57, 715 S.E.2d at 356. One seeking to recover for\r\nunjust enrichment must show: \"(1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the\r\ndefendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention of the\r\nbenefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to\r\nretain it without paying its value.\" Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle\r\nBeach, 341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).\r\n\r\nWe hold Chase has not shown circumstances that would make it inequitable for\r\nCassandra to retain any benefits that she received from Chase or Midland\r\nMortgage. There was no evidence that Cassandra failed to disclose any\r\ninformation or discharge any legal obligation that would have prevented Midland\r\nMortgage from authorizing a loan to Sidney that was secured only by his undivided\r\none-half interest but was in an amount greatly exceeding the value of that interest.\r\nTo the contrary, the evidence shows Midland Mortgage was or should have been\r\naware that Cassandra was named on the contract with Sidney as a purchaser and\r\ndid not sign either the note or the mortgage. See Pitts v. Jackson Nat'l Life Ins.\r\nCo., 352 S.C. 319, 339, 574 S.E.2d 502, 512 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating the plaintiff\r\n\"failed to establish any duty to disclose or other cause of action that would allow\r\nrecovery for unjust enrichment\"). Moreover, Cassandra never signed the note or\r\nthe mortgage, and there was no evidence that either Midland Mortgage or Chase\r\nattempted to procure her signature either at the closing or during the thirteen\r\nmonths between the closing date and Sidney's death.\r\n\r\nIII.    Federal Common Law\r\n\r\nChase next takes issue with the Master's citation to a federal case on unjust\r\nenrichment, arguing there is no federal question at issue in this action.4 Although\r\n\r\n4   The Master cited Mason v. M.F. Smith & Assocs., 158 F. Supp. 2d 673 (2001).\r\n\nChase is correct that this case does not involve a federal question, we find no error.\r\nIt is not improper to cite cases from the federal courts as persuasive authority even\r\non a matter litigated in a state court that does not present a federal question.\r\nMoreover, the cases from the South Carolina state courts that we have cited on\r\nunjust enrichment and restitution support the affirmance of the Master's finding\r\nthat Chase is not entitled to recover against Cassandra based on a theory of unjust\r\nenrichment.\r\n\r\nIV.   Other Relief\r\n\r\nFinally, Chase contends that the Master erred in holding it is not entitled to any\r\nform of equitable relief because Midland Mortgage and the closing attorney could\r\nhave avoided the loss. In support of this assertion, Chase argues the closing\r\nattorney is deemed to represent the buyer and Cassandra should be charged with\r\nthe error of her attorney. Chase also points out that Midland Mortgage\r\nCorporation did not prepare or review the deed of conveyance. We hold these\r\ncircumstances do not warrant reversal of the Master's refusal to award equitable\r\nrelief to Chase.\r\n\r\nWe agree that in a standard real estate transaction, the closing attorney represents\r\nthe borrower. See S.C. Code Ann. § 37-10-102(a) (2002) (referring to \"legal\r\ncounsel that is employed to represent the debtor in all matters of the transaction\r\nrelating to the closing\" of a loan that is primarily \"for a personal, family or\r\nhousehold purpose\" and \"is secured in whole or in part by a lien on real estate\").\r\nNonetheless, even though Midland Mortgage Corporation did not prepare or\r\nreview the deed, it processed the Rishers' loan application and, according to the\r\nMaster's order, prepared the other closing documents. We found nothing in the\r\nrecord suggesting Midland Mortgage would have not had access to the contract of\r\nsale, which listed both Sidney and Cassandra as purchasers and was admitted into\r\nevidence as a plaintiff's exhibit. Furthermore, although Cassandra accompanied\r\nSidney when he applied for the loan, she was never asked to complete an\r\napplication or to sign either the note or the mortgage. We therefore hold that\r\nalthough Midland Mortgage Corporation was not formally represented by counsel\r\nat the closing, it had sufficient information to avoid the loss it sustained.\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Master's findings that Chase was not entitled to an equitable lien,\r\nrecovery under the theory of unjust enrichment, or any other form of equitable\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
