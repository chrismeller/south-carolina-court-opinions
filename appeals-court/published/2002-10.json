Hayes, III, Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3554\r\nHeard September 12, 2002 â€“ Filed October 7, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMary Lou Hill, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Mark Hayes, II, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.:Â  Kohler Company appeals the decision \r\n  of the Circuit Court affirming an award of Workersâ€™ Compensation.Â  Kohler argues: \r\n  (1) the Circuit Court did not apply the correct standard of review; (2) the \r\n  record does not support the Circuit Courtâ€™s decision; and (3) the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in finding Kohler was not entitled to set off for payments it made to \r\n  Corbin under a salary continuation plan.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJames R. Corbin (Corbin) worked in the \r\n  casting department at Kohler Company in Spartanburg for forty-one years.Â  Corbin \r\n  testified that, during his career at Kohler, he was exposed to significant amounts \r\n  of silica dust.Â  In 1999, he first began having respiratory symptoms, including \r\n  a dry cough which progressed to some shortness of breath and loss of stamina.Â  \r\n  Corbinâ€™s family physician referred him to Dr. Douglas Clark, a pulmonary specialist.Â  \r\n  Additionally, he was seen by Dr. Mary Lou Applebaum, a pulmonary specialist \r\n  in the same office as Dr. Clark.Â  In August 1999, Dr. Applebaum removed Corbin \r\n  from work and advised him he had silicosis.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCorbin filed a Form 50 seeking Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  benefits for the silicosis.Â  Kohler denied the compensability of his claim.Â  \r\n\r\nCorbin was evaluated by several doctors \r\n  in connection with his illness, in addition to Drs. Applebaum and Clark.Â  Dr. \r\n  William Stewart reviewed Corbinâ€™s medical records and other factors to provide \r\n  a vocational and rehabilitation assessment.Â  Dr. Donald Schlueter examined the \r\n  records of Dr. Applebaum and her partners.Â  Drs. Kevin Kopera and Arden Levy \r\n  also evaluated Corbin.\r\n In his order, the Single Commissioner found that \r\n  Corbin sustained an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of \r\n  his employment at Kohler.Â  He found Corbinâ€™s occupational disease was silicosis \r\n  resulting from prolonged exposure to silica dust in the workplace and Corbin \r\n  was permanently and totally disabled as a result of his occupational disease.Â  \r\n  The Commissioner denied Kohler credit for benefits paid to Corbin under his \r\n  salary continuation program, and ordered the payment of 500 weeks compensation \r\n  in addition to reimbursement and coverage of all medical, hospital, pharmaceutical, \r\n  and other expenses related to Corbinâ€™s occupational disease.Â  Kohler appealed \r\n  the order to the full Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.\r\nThe Commission upheld the Single Commissionerâ€™s \r\n  decision in its entirety.Â  Kohler appealed.Â  The Circuit Court affirmed the \r\n  findings of the Commission and dismissed the appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       \r\n  Did the Circuit Court apply the correct standard of review in upholding the \r\n  decision of the Commission?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n     \r\n  Does the record support the Circuit Courtâ€™s finding that the Commissionâ€™s decision \r\n  was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n     \r\n  Did the Circuit Court err in finding that Kohler was not entitled to a set off \r\n  from the Commissionâ€™s award to Corbin for compensation paid under the salary \r\n  continuation plan?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Commission.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg School Dist. No. 3, 338 \r\n  S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); Hamilton v. Bob Bennett Ford, \r\n  336 S.C. 72, 518 S.E.2d 599 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, \r\n  this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to \r\n  the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision \r\n  is affected by an error of law.Â  Hamilton, 336 S.C. at 76, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  at 601.Â  The appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error \r\n  of law.Â  Id.Â  The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct \r\n  and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Hicks \r\n  v. Piedmont Cold Storage, 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Broughton \r\n  v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  It \r\n  is not within our province to reverse findings of the Commission which are supported \r\n  by substantial evidence.Â  Hunter v. Patrick Constr. Co., 289 S.C. 46, \r\n  344 S.E.2d 613 (1986); Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d 637.Â  \r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla \r\n  of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but \r\n  is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to \r\n  justify its action.Â  Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 441 S.E.2d \r\n  323 (1994); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  â€œIndeed, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions \r\n  from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from \r\n  being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Muir, 336 S.C. at 282, 519 \r\n  S.E.2d at 591.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Standard of Review\r\nKohler contends the Circuit Court failed \r\n  to apply the correct standard of judicial review in upholding the decision of \r\n  the Commission.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the hearing before the Circuit Court, the following \r\n  colloquy occurred:\r\nTHE COURT: All right.Â  Iâ€™m looking at Page 12 of the order.Â  \r\n  And it alleged â€“ I mean, itâ€™s based on claimantâ€™s functional limitations and \r\n  report of Dr. William Stewart, it is clear that claimant is and will be permanently \r\n  and totally disabled.Â  Where can I find Dr. Stewartâ€™s â€“ this is it right here.Â  \r\n  William Stewart?\r\nMS. HILL: Yes.Â  Dr. Stewart talks about disability.Â  But \r\n  Dr. Stewart does not connect the disability to silicosis.Â  And the finding on \r\n  functional limitation, there is no functional limitation other than heâ€™s got \r\n  to stay out of dust.\r\nTHE COURT: Well, both of you are aware Iâ€™ve got to see if \r\n  there is any evidence, basically.\r\nMS. HILL: I understand, Your Honor.\r\n  . . . \r\nTHE COURT: [Dr. Stewart] says he concluded his prognosis \r\n  was successful vocational rehabilitation to some kind of lighter work job be \r\n  considered very poor to nonexistent.Â  If we were to assume he could, in fact, \r\n  return to some kind of alternative work, he has concluded â€“ and then he goes \r\n  into that he could only earn $7.50 an hour.Â  Is that not enough evidence for \r\n  the â€“ coupled with what they call functional limitations?Â  Isnâ€™t that some evidence \r\n  on which they could base their opinion?\r\nMS. HILL: This is evidence by a vocational expert that, in \r\n  his opinion, he is going to have a hard time finding a job with his limitation \r\n  of not being able to work in dust, strong fumes, or odors.Â  But nowhere in here \r\n  does he say that his disability is caused by the occupational disease of silicosis.Â  \r\n  And thatâ€™s my point.Â  There is no evidence on the causal connection between \r\n  this manâ€™s impairment, even if he has some, even if he has silicosis, and his \r\n  disability.Â \r\nTHE COURT: Well, I thought Dr. Applebaum said he did have \r\n  silicosis.\r\nMS. HILL: He â€“ yes, she certainly did.\r\nTHE COURT: Well, isnâ€™t that enough?Â  You donâ€™t have to have \r\n  15 doctors.Â  Once the Workers Comp. Commission has any evidence that he had \r\n  silicosis -- and Dr. Applebaum says he does -- isnâ€™t that -- doesnâ€™t that jump \r\n  the hurdle?\r\nMS. HILL: She said he had silicosis.Â  She put no functional \r\n  limitations on him other than he canâ€™t work where itâ€™s real dusty.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Well, letâ€™s take it one step at the time.Â  Doesnâ€™t \r\n  that get him over the first hurdle, though?Â  Doesnâ€™t that put him â€“ having silicosis?\r\nMS. HILL: Yes.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  And doesnâ€™t that also put it as a result of inhaling \r\n  silica while employed at Kohler Company, as she states in so many word[s]?\r\nMS. HILL:Â  Yes, but she never states that it resulted in \r\n  a disability that prevented him from working.\r\nTHE COURT: I understand that.Â  Iâ€™m just taking it one step \r\n  at a time.\r\nMS. HILL: Okay.\r\nTHE COURT: So she says heâ€™s got silicosis and that he has \r\n  residual pulmonary condition.\r\nMS. HILL: Thatâ€™s right.Â  But she also states, in an earlier \r\n  report, that his pulmonary functioning was normal.Â  He just canâ€™t work where \r\n  itâ€™s dusty.\r\nTHE COURT: Well, so, she said two different things.Â  That \r\n  goes to weight; does it not?Â  Why should I believe the first one and not the \r\n  second?Â  And â€“ instead of the Commission believing one as opposed to the other?Â  \r\n  When you got somebody saying two things, you can either believe the first, second, \r\n  or somewhere in between.\r\nMS. HILL: Well, when she says residual . . .\r\nTHE COURT: . . . pulmonary.\r\nMS. HILL: All right.Â  I â€“ Iâ€™m . . .\r\nTHE COURT: Letâ€™s see.Â  In my opinion, within a reasonable \r\n  degree of certainty, he has a silicosis, condition as a result of exposure.Â  \r\n  It is my opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Mr. \r\n  Corbin suffers from a significant pulmonary condition, referred to as silicosis.Â  \r\n  Thatâ€™s what she says heâ€™s got.Â  And thatâ€™s what she says, to a reasonable degree \r\n  of medical certainty, creates a significant pulmonary condition.Â  She said that, \r\n  not Dr. Applebaum.Â  I donâ€™t know whether itâ€™s true or not.Â  But I canâ€™t weigh \r\n  the evidence; Iâ€™ve got to see if there is any.Â  To me the question becomes whether \r\n  or not he has silicosis and he got it at Kohler Company.Â  So the question becomes, \r\n  whether or not, based on that and Dr. Stewartâ€™s report, that is â€“ jumps the \r\n  hurdle of some evidence.Â  And Iâ€™m going to find that it does.Â  Iâ€™m going to \r\n  dismiss the appeal.\r\n  . . .\r\nTHE COURT: As I see it, Iâ€™ve got a very little narrow thing \r\n  I can look at.Â  And once that little hurdle is jumped, I canâ€™t say, Well, Iâ€™d \r\n  have found different, or anything like that.Â  Once they get the door open just \r\n  a crack, thatâ€™s all it takes.Â  That may be all thatâ€™s here but thatâ€™s all it \r\n  takes.Â  \r\nKohler asserts the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  statements reflect his misunderstanding of the standard of review.Â  Kohler maintains \r\n  the Circuit Court reviewed the Commissionâ€™s decision based on a â€œcracked doorâ€ \r\n  standard of review in which a mere scintilla of evidence would be sufficient \r\n  to sustain the decision of the Commission.Â  This argument has no merit because \r\n  the statements by the judge were merely contemporaneous colloquy.Â  The judge \r\n  and the lawyers were talking in the course of working through the attorneysâ€™ \r\n  arguments.Â  The judgeâ€™s final written order represents the decision of the court.\r\nâ€œNo order is final until it is written \r\n  and entered.â€Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. Hitman, Inc., 306 S.C. 327, \r\n  329, 411 S.E.2d 681, 682 (Ct. App. 1991), affâ€™d, 308 S.C. 421, 418 S.E.2d \r\n  545 (1992) (citing Rule 58(a), SCRCP).Â  See also Case v. Case, \r\n  243 S.C. 447, 134 S.E.2d 394 (1964) (judgments in general are not final until \r\n  written and entered); Bayne v. Bass, 302 S.C. 208, 394 S.E.2d 726 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1990) (divorce decree is not final until written and recorded).Â  â€œUntil \r\n  written and entered, the trial judge retains discretion to change his mind and \r\n  amend his oral ruling accordingly.â€Â  Ford v. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 344 \r\n  S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001); First Union Natâ€™l Bank, 306 \r\n  S.C. at 329, 411 S.E.2d at 682.Â  See also Case v. Case, 243 S.C. \r\n  at 451, 134 S.E.2d at 396 (holding even if the trial judge made oral ruling \r\n  in favor of one party, such pronouncement is not a final ruling on the merits \r\n  nor is it binding on the parties until it has been reduced to writing, signed \r\n  by the judge, and delivered for recordation).\r\nâ€œIt is well settled that a judge is not \r\n  bound by a prior oral ruling and may issue a written order which is in conflict \r\n  with the oral ruling.â€Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 204, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  835, 839 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  See also Owens v. Magill, 308 S.C. \r\n  556, 419 S.E.2d 786 (1992) (ruling judge was not bound by prior oral ruling \r\n  and could issue written order which conflicted with prior oral ruling).Â  â€œTo \r\n  the extent the written order may conflict with the prior oral ruling, the written \r\n  order controls.â€Â  Parag v. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, 226, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  590, 592 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThe written order is the trial judgeâ€™s final order \r\n  and as such constitutes the final judgment of the court.Â  The final written \r\n  order contains the binding instructions which are to be followed by the parties.â€Â  \r\n  Ford, 344 S.C. at 646, 545 S.E.2d at 823 (citing Rule 58, SCRCP).&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nThe judgeâ€™s final order reads:\r\n\r\n  The South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Section 1-23-310, et. seq., establishes the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ rule \r\n  as the standard for judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.Â  \r\n  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  On an appeal \r\n  from the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, the court may not substitute its \r\n  judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  \r\n  Stephen v. Avins Construction Company, 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  Also see Lyles v. Quantum Chemical Company, 315 S.C. 440, \r\n  434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nThis paragraph accurately states the â€œsubstantial \r\n  evidenceâ€ standard of review which the judge applied in his final written order.Â  \r\n  Regardless of the colloquy during the hearing, the final written order correctly \r\n  articulated the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Thus, we find no error.\r\nII.Â  Substantial Evidence to Support the Decision of the Commission\r\nKohler argues the record does not support \r\n  a finding that the Commissionâ€™s decision was supported by the substantial evidence \r\n  in the record as a whole.Â  We disagree.\r\nBeginning in April 1999, Corbin was seen by Dr. \r\n  Applebaum.Â  By August of 1999, Dr. Applebaum had removed Corbin from work and \r\n  diagnosed him with silicosis.Â  Corbin continued in her care through March 2000, \r\n  when Dr. Applebaum found he had reached â€œmaximum medical improvement.â€Â  Dr. \r\n  Applebaumâ€™s memorandum dated March 17, 2000 provided:\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the undersigned is the treating physician \r\n  for James R. Corbin.Â  A complete copy of my medical records concerning Mr. Corbin \r\n  is attached.Â  \r\nBased on the history presented, my examination, and x-ray \r\n  and other diagnostic evaluations, it is my opinion within a reasonable degree \r\n  of medical certainty that Mr. Corbin suffers from a significant pulmonary condition \r\n  referred to as silicosis.Â  Based on my examination, treatment records, x-ray \r\n  and diagnostic evaluations, the history presented, and my review of certain \r\n  Industrial Hygiene Sampling Results, it is my opinion within a reasonable degree \r\n  of medical certainty that Mr. Corbinâ€™s silicosis condition was most probably \r\n  the result of exposure to respirable silica (Crystalline Quartz) while employed \r\n  at the Kohler Company, in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\r\nI have been treating Mr. Corbin since April of 1999.Â  I have \r\n  continued to treat him since August 30, 1999 when I advised that he should leave \r\n  his work environment at Kohler.Â  It is my opinion that he has now reached maximum \r\n  medical improvement concerning his condition.Â  However, it is further my opinion \r\n  that it is medically necessary that he avoid any further exposure to respirable \r\n  silica dust in any fashion.Â  It is further my opinion that due to his residual \r\n  pulmonary condition, he will be unable to work in any environment that would \r\n  result in pulmonary exposure to dust, strong fumes or odors, or extreme hot \r\n  or cold temperatures.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. William W. Stewart, a vocational \r\n  rehabilitation specialist, evaluated Corbin.Â  He did not meet with Corbin personally, \r\n  but he reviewed the records of Dr. Applebaum and Dr. Douglas Clark.Â  He analyzed \r\n  vocational and occupational factors, labor market access, Corbinâ€™s ability to \r\n  earn, and his earning capacity.Â  His vocational and rehabilitation assessment \r\n  stated in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIMPRESSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\nBased on Mr. Corbinâ€™s evaluation it is concluded that he \r\n  is a person who sustained significant work-related injury, or injuries, to his \r\n  lungs, with continuing problems and limitations, and work restrictions that \r\n  will prevent him from ever being able to return to the kind of work he had normally \r\n  performed in the past.Â  And, after considering all vocational/occupational factors \r\n  relating to Mr. Corbin, including his advanced/retirement age, and all medical/pulmonary \r\n  factors, including his inability to return to the kind of work he had normally \r\n  performed over the past 41 years, it is concluded that his prognosis for successful \r\n  vocational rehabilitation to some kind of lighter, alternative worker job has \r\n  to be considered very poor to non-existent.\r\nIf it were assumed that he could, in fact, return to some \r\n  kind of alternative work, it is concluded that Mr. Corbinâ€™s ability to earn \r\n  has been reduced to no more than approximately $7.50 per hour because of his \r\n  injuries, continuing problems and limitations, and his permanent work restrictions.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nCorbin testified there was silica \r\n  dust at Kohler.Â  He provided a photo which showed dust accumulation in his office.Â  \r\n  He declared his â€œhealth has been excellent before this last illness.â€Â  He stated \r\n  that, after having trouble breathing, his family doctor referred him to â€œa set \r\n  of pulmonary doctors.â€Â  Corbin explained that he saw Dr. Applebaum and did not \r\n  return to work after she diagnosed him with silicosis.\r\nIn addition to the materials and \r\n  testimony of Dr. Applebaum, Dr. Stewart, and Corbin, other evidence was presented \r\n  relating to Corbinâ€™s illness.Â  Dr. Arden Levy, of Foothill Allergy and Asthma \r\n  Associates, saw Corbin on one occasion.Â  In his report, Dr. Levy diagnosed Corbin \r\n  with possible bronchial asthma and rhinosinusitis, which may have contributed \r\n  to his cough. Â Dr. Donald Schlueter did not see Corbin but reviewed some \r\n  of the records of Dr. Applebaum and her partners.Â  Dr. Schlueter expressed his \r\n  opinion â€œto a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Mr. Corbinâ€™s asthma \r\n  was not caused by any occupational exposure at Kohler Company.â€ Dr. Kevin Kopera \r\n  declared that he did not believe Corbin had silicosis, though he conceded on \r\n  cross-examination he could not exclude silicosis as a diagnosis.Â  Dr. Kopera \r\n  was not a pulmonologist.\r\n Expert medical testimony is designed \r\n  to aid the Commission in coming to the correct conclusion.Â  Tiller v. National \r\n  Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333,Â  513 S.E.2d 843 (1999).Â  Therefore, the \r\n  Commission determines the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Once admitted, expert testimony is to be considered just like any \r\n  other testimony.Â  Id.; Smith v. Southern Builders, 202 S.C. 88, \r\n  24 S.E.2d 109 (1943).\r\nDr. Applebaum saw Corbin more \r\n  than any other doctor.Â  She is a pulmonologist who specializes in the very type \r\n  of condition Corbin sustained in his workplace.Â  Dr. Schlueter never examined \r\n  Corbin personally but instead reviewed the records of other doctors.Â  Dr. \r\n  Kopera performed an evaluation, but he is not a pulmonologist.Â  Dr. Levy \r\n  saw Corbin only one time.Â  The evidence provided by Dr. Applebaum was entitled \r\n  to greater weight than that of the other expert medical testimony, as she saw \r\n  Corbin more and was a specialist in pulmonology.\r\nIn our opinion, substantial evidence \r\n  supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that Corbin suffered from silicosis arising \r\n  out of and in the course of his employment at Kohler.Â  This evidence includes \r\n  the letters of Drs. Applebaum and Stewart, as well as Corbinâ€™s own testimony.Â  \r\n  Because there was substantial evidence in the record to support the decision \r\n  of the Commission, there was no error by the Circuit Court in affirming the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s order.\r\nIII.Â  Set Off of Award\r\nKohler claims the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in finding it was not entitled to a set off from the Commissionâ€™s award \r\n  for compensation paid to Corbin under his salary continuation plan.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nUnder the salary continuation plan, beginning \r\n  in August 1999, Kohler paid 100% of Corbinâ€™s base salary for the first three \r\n  months of his disability and 80% for the following three months, thus compensating \r\n  Corbin for a total of 26 weeks.Â  Kohlerâ€™s pay protection program brochure states: \r\n  â€œ[y]ouâ€™re eligible to participate in the Pay Protection Program if youâ€™re an \r\n  active full-time exempt associate.â€Â  Kohler paid the cost of each employeeâ€™s \r\n  pay protection program.Â  In the materials relating to the program, there was \r\n  no mention of Workersâ€™ Compensation.Â  Significantly, there was a section explaining \r\n  â€œwhen benefits are not paid,â€ and Workersâ€™ Compensation is not mentioned in \r\n  connection with this list.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. section 42-9-210 \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  Any payments made by an employer to an injured employee \r\n  during the period of his disability, or to his dependents, which by the terms \r\n  of this Title were not due and payable when made may, subject to the approval \r\n  of the Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation; provided, \r\n  that in the case of disability such deductions shall be made by shortening the \r\n  period during which compensation must be paid and not by reducing the amount \r\n  of the weekly payment.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-210 (1985).\r\nâ€œThe approval of the Commission for such \r\n  deduction is required by Â§ 42-9-210.â€Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. \r\n  266, 298, 519 S.E.2d 583, 599 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œIn order for payments to be \r\n  deductible, they must have been made with reference to liability under the provisions \r\n  of the Act and intended to be in lieu of compensation.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œSince \r\n  only those payments are deductible which are made in contemplation of the legal \r\n  obligation of the employer to pay compensation to a disabled employee, the intent \r\n  with which such payments are made becomes important.â€Â  Id. (citing Brittle \r\n  v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 255, 258, 127 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1962)).Â  \r\n\r\nThe payments Corbin received were from a compensation \r\n  plan which was set up internally at Kohler.Â  The intent of the plan was not \r\n  connected to Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits.Â  Rather, it was a benefit Kohler \r\n  provided to certain employees who became disabled.Â  We find no evidence in the \r\n  record that the payments were made with reference to liability under the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Act or in lieu of compensation.Â  We rule Kohler was not entitled \r\n  to a credit for the payments.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Accordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the decision of the Circuit Court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3555","title":"Cowan v.

Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3555\r\nSubmitted September 9, 2002 â€“ Filed October 7, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSamuel D. Harms,Â  of Greenville, for appellants.\r\nRobert D. Moseley, Jr., of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Kevin Cowan and \r\n  Jimmy Blanding (collectively Appellants) brought this declaratory judgment action \r\n  against Allstate Insurance Company to recover damages awarded by default against \r\n  Allstateâ€™s insured.Â  The circuit court ruled Allstate could assert its insuredâ€™s \r\n  failure to comply with the cooperation clause of the insurance policy and deny \r\n  coverage when it lacked actual knowledge of the lawsuit.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nAllstate issued the insurance policy to its named \r\n  insured, Charles A. Griffis, who was the owner of the vehicle involved in the \r\n  accident.Â  Stacy Johnson was operating Griffisâ€™ automobile with his permission \r\n  at the time of the accident.Â  Although Appellantsâ€™ counsel sent a letter of \r\n  representation to Allstate, they did not send a courtesy copy of the summons \r\n  and complaint, nor otherwise provide any notice that the lawsuit, which only \r\n  named Johnson as the defendant, had been filed and served.Â  Johnson did not \r\n  forward the summons and complaint to Allstate and did not file an answer.Â  Allstateâ€™s \r\n  first notice of the existence of a lawsuit was when Appellantsâ€™ counsel forwarded \r\n  a copy of the order awarding damages following the entry of default. Â Allstateâ€™s \r\n  motion on behalf of Johnson under Rule 60(b), SCRCP to be relieved of the judgment \r\n  was denied.Â  \r\nAppellants then brought this declaratory judgment \r\n  action against Allstate to collect the judgment entered against its insured \r\n  based on coverage provided by the insurance policy.Â  On cross motions for summary \r\n  judgment, the circuit court held that Allstate could assert its insuredâ€™s failure \r\n  to comply with the cooperation clause to deny coverage when it lacked actual \r\n  knowledge of the lawsuit.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-142(B) (1997) overturned this courtâ€™s holding in Shores \r\n  v. Weaver, 315 S.C. 347, 433 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  We hold that the \r\n  statutory language modified Shores, and affirm the circuit court.\r\nIn Shores, this court found that \r\n  a violation of the cooperation clause of an insurance contract providing the \r\n  statutory minimum amount of automobile liability insurance cannot prevent recovery \r\n  by an innocent victim.Â  Id. at 355, 433 S.E.2d at 917.Â  This court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œFurthermore, it appears to us that to allow the insuredâ€™s \r\n  failure to give notice of the accident to prevent the injured personâ€™s recovery \r\n  would be to practically nullify the statute by making the enforcement of the \r\n  rights of the person intended to be protected dependent upon the acts of the \r\n  very person who caused the injury.â€ \r\n\r\nId. at 354, 433 S.E.2d at 916 (quoting Ott \r\n  v. Am. Fid. &amp; Cas. Co, 161 S.C. 314, 319, 159 S.E.2d 635, 637 (1931).Â  \r\n  This court went on to hold:\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we hold, as a matter of public policy, the \r\n  minimum limits automobile liability insurance policy involved in this case was \r\n  not defeated or voided by [the insuredâ€™s] failure to comply with policy notice \r\n  provisions after the accident resulting in [the victimâ€™s] injuries, because \r\n  the coverage was mandated by the legislature to protect innocent third parties. \r\n  . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 356, 433 S.E.2d at 917.\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-142(B) provides in pertinent part:\r\nIf an insurer has actual notice of a motion for judgment \r\n  or complaint having been served on an insured, the mere failure of the insured \r\n  to turn the motion or complaint over to the insurer may not be a defense to \r\n  the insurer, nor void the endorsement or provision, nor in any way relieve the \r\n  insurer of its obligations to the insured, provided the insured otherwise cooperates \r\n  and in no way prejudices the insurer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-142(B) (Rev. 2002) (1997 \r\n  Act No. 154, Â§ 11, eff. Mar.&nbsp;1, 1999).Â  \r\nAppellants argue Shores is still controlling precedent \r\n  because USAA v. Markosky, the progeny of Shores, continued to \r\n  apply it after the effective date of Â§ 38-77-142(B).Â  USAA v. Markosky, \r\n  340 S.C. 223, 530 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Their reliance is misplaced.Â  \r\n  Markosky did not apply this statute.Â  While it is true Markosky \r\n  was decided after the effective date of the statute, the accident occurred before \r\n  its effective date, and this court applied the Shores law. Therefore, \r\n  Markosky cannot be read to hold that Shores survives the statute.Â  \r\n  Appellants then reason section 38-77-142(B) expanded Markosky by rendering \r\n  the insurer liable for the full amount of a judgment, rather than only the minimum \r\n  limits, if the insurer has notice of the lawsuit.Â  However, as Allstate aptly \r\n  notes, the statute could not have been intended to expand Markosky because \r\n  it was enacted in 1997, before Markosky was decided, though it did not \r\n  take effect until 1999.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  for the court to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Mid-State \r\n  Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, \r\n  692 (1996).Â  â€œIn interpreting a statute, words must be given their plain and \r\n  ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit \r\n  or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 369, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, \r\n  reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and \r\n  policy of lawmakers.â€Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 \r\n  S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â  â€œIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain \r\n  and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion \r\n  for employing rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to \r\n  look for or impose another meaning.â€Â  Miller v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 447, \r\n  441 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1994).Â  \r\nThe court must presume the legislature did not \r\n  intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something.Â  \r\n  See State ex rel. McLeod&nbsp;v. Montgomery, 244 S.C. 308, 314, \r\n  136 S.E.2d 778, 782 (1964).Â  â€œFinally, there is a basic presumption that the \r\n  legislature has knowledge of previous legislation as well as of judicial decisions \r\n  construing that legislation when later statutes are enacted concerning related \r\n  subjects.â€Â  Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997).\r\nWe find Section 38-77-142(B) is aimed at addressing \r\n  the concerns stated by this court in Shores, while also addressing some \r\n  concerns raised by our decision.Â  In Shores, this court concentrated \r\n  on the unfairness to the innocent victim in having to rely on the insured to \r\n  forward the complaint to the insurance company and otherwise cooperating with \r\n  the insurer prior to the insurer having a responsibility to provide coverage.Â  \r\n  The statute specifically addresses this courtâ€™s concern by allowing the injured \r\n  party to provide notice of the lawsuit to the insurer and to no longer have \r\n  to rely on the injured party to provide the notice.Â  However, the statute also \r\n  removes the concern that insurers had to pay default judgments, as in this case, \r\n  where the insurer had no opportunity to participate in discovery or present \r\n  a defense.\r\nAs the trial court noted, â€œ[t]his interpretation \r\n  allows Plaintiffs the ability to avoid the effects of this section by informing \r\n  the carrier of the suit by sending a filed courtesy copy of the complaint, which \r\n  should encourage the open exchange of information and discourage default â€˜trapsâ€™ \r\n  where the insured is not represented by counsel.â€Â  The alternative is to render \r\n  meaningless the cooperation clause contained in virtually every policy of automobile \r\n  liability insurance.\r\nAlthough the statutory language is couched in terms \r\n  which address the opposite of the situation in this case, we find the statute \r\n  is unambiguous and clearly states the insurer cannot enforce a cooperation clause \r\n  when it has actual knowledge and its insured otherwise cooperates and does nothing \r\n  to prejudice the insurerâ€™s interest.Â  By clear implication the reverse of that \r\n  proposition must, of necessity, apply.Â  The statute specifically includes the \r\n  conditions upon which the insurer may not enforce the cooperation clause.Â  When \r\n  the legislature spells out the specific conditions an insurer may not \r\n  rely upon to deny coverage or escape liability, then, a fortiori, the \r\n  legislature intended that the absence of those conditions may be relied upon \r\n  to provide a viable defense.Â  Therefore, consistent with rules of statutory \r\n  construction, we find the legislature intended to allow an insurer to enforce \r\n  its cooperation clause if neither the insured nor the innocent victim provided \r\n  the insurer with notice of the lawsuit.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, \r\n  341 S.C. 79, 86, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000) (â€œThe canon of construction â€˜expressio \r\n  unius est exclusio alteriusâ€™ or â€˜inclusio unius est exclusio alteriusâ€™ \r\n  holds that â€˜to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another, \r\n  or of the alternative.â€™â€).\r\nAdditionally, under the system established in Shores, \r\n  attorneys for the injured third party had no incentive to inform the insurer \r\n  of the lawsuit.Â  However, in addition to being zealous advocates on behalf of \r\n  their clients, members of the bar are also officers of the court.Â  The Canons \r\n  of Professional Ethics, the predecessor to the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  â€œprohibit an attorney from engaging in practices that bring the courts or the \r\n  legal profession into disrepute.â€Â  Norris v. Alexander, 246 S.C. 14, \r\n  19, 142 S.E.2d 214, 217-18 (1965).Â  Activities undertaken for the purpose of \r\n  evading the full and fair litigation of a case on its merits do not promote \r\n  the essential goals upon which the Rules of Professional Conduct rest. \r\nFinally, the primary policy undergirding \r\n  the Shores holding has also been changed by statute.Â  Our holding in \r\n  Shores was premised on the mandatory minimum limits required by statute, \r\n  which could not be defeated by contract.Â  The same act containing Section 38-77-142(B) \r\n  also contained the provision codified at Section 56-10-510.Â  Under that section, \r\n  South Carolina allows a person to be uninsured by paying a fee and registering \r\n  with the Division of Motor Vehicles.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-510 (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n  Thus, South Carolina is no longer a mandatory insurance state, the critical \r\n  difference being that such policies are rendered voluntary.Â  â€œ[I]nsurers have \r\n  the right to limit their liability and to impose whatever conditions they desire \r\n  upon an insured, provided they are not in contravention of some statutory inhibition \r\n  or public policy.â€Â  Penn. Natâ€™l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Parker, 282 S.C. \r\n  546, 550-51, 320 S.E.2d 458, 461 (Ct. App. 1984) (citations omitted); see \r\n  also USAA v. Markosky, 340 S.C. 223, 226, 530 S.E.2d 660, 662 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold section 38-77-142(B) is unambiguous and \r\n  was clearly intended by the legislature to address the situation presented in \r\n  Shores.Â  We find the trial courtâ€™s interpretation promotes the â€œtruth-seekingâ€ \r\n  function of the courts and allows for an open process aimed at a full examination \r\n  of all relevant facts.Â  Thus, we conclude the interpretation of section 38-77-142(B) \r\n  offered by the trial courtâ€”that an insurer who has no actual notice of a complaint \r\n  or motion for judgment having been served on an insured and with whom the insured \r\n  fails to cooperate to the prejudice of the insurer can rely on its cooperation \r\n  clause as a defense to deny a claimâ€”is the correct construction of the legislative \r\n  intent.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to \r\n    Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3556","title":"Lee v.

Morgan, of Columbia; for Respondent-Appellant(s)\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:Â  Richard \r\n  E. Lee sued Thermal Engineering Corp. and its founder, Willie Best (collectively, \r\n  â€œThermalâ€), asserting claims for breach of contract and violation of the Payment \r\n  of Post-Termination Claims to Sales Representatives Act, S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-10 \r\n  to â€“80 (Supp. 2001). Lee also sought punitive damages and attorney fees.Â  Following \r\n  a bench trial, the court granted judgment to Lee.Â  In a separate order, the \r\n  court awarded Lee attorney feesÂ  and prejudgment interest, but denied Leeâ€™s \r\n  request for punitive damages.Â  Both Thermal and Lee appeal.Â  We affirm in part \r\n  and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nThermal \r\n  manufactures curing ovens, paint booths and control panels that operate manufacturing \r\n  equipment.Â  On October 5, 1987, Thermal entered into a written agreement with \r\n  Lee to serve as its sales representative in the Southeastern United States.\r\nThe agreement, \r\n  which was to run from year to year, provided that Lee was to be paid on a commission \r\n  basis for any orders accepted by Thermal.Â  Either party could terminate the \r\n  relationship upon six months written notice;Â  however, the agreement would remain \r\n  in force for six months after notice of termination.Â  Upon termination of the \r\n  contract, Lee was entitled to commissions for accounts he generated for a period \r\n  of eight months after the termination.Â  If an order was received from one of \r\n  Leeâ€™s customers during the eight months after termination then an additional \r\n  eight-month period would be in effect from the order date and would continue \r\n  in effect so long as orders were received during the eight-month interval.\r\nOn March \r\n  29, 1995, Thermal sent Lee notice of termination of the contract.Â  Lee reminded \r\n  Thermal of the six-month notice provision in their contract and requested an \r\n  accurate accounting of any commissions that might be due during the notice period.\r\nThermal disputed the application \r\n  of the notice provision and advised Lee that the March 29th letter \r\n  had declared their contract to be at an end. Thermal further advised Lee that \r\n  if he was already working on any particular projects that â€œThermal [was] willing \r\n  to work with [him] on a case-by-case basis so that those efforts wonâ€™t be wasted.â€Â  \r\n  On November 9, 1995, after a demand from Leeâ€™s attorney, Thermal paid Lee $7098.42 \r\n  for the undisputed, pre-termination commissions earned prior to March 29, 1995.\r\nLee filed this action against \r\n  Thermal seeking the balance of his post-termination commissions, plus punitive \r\n  damages and attorney fees.Â  The trial court awarded Lee a judgment of $58,465.64 \r\n  for all the unpaid commissions in accordance with the notice provisions of the \r\n  contract.Â  The courtâ€™s order further provided Lee was entitled to reasonable \r\n  attorney fees and instructed him to submit an affidavit of attorney fees within \r\n  fifteen days of receipt of the order.Â  Following a hearing, the court awarded \r\n  Lee pre-judgment interest of $16,901.61 and attorney fees of $25,122.Â  This \r\n  appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThermalâ€™s \r\n  Appeal\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Oral Amendment of Contract\r\nThermal asserts the trial court committed reversible \r\n  error in ruling the contract was orally amended because Lee never asserted in \r\n  his pleadings that the written contract was modified.Â  We believe the question \r\n  of whether or not the contract was orally amended was presented to the trial \r\n  court.\r\nInitially, we discuss Thermalâ€™s \r\n  argument that Leeâ€™s pleadings make no claim that the contract was orally amended \r\n  to include â€œengineeredâ€ products within its terms.Â  Thermal argues that clearly \r\n  the complaint bases Leeâ€™s right to recover on the written contract and that \r\n  Lee never made a motion to amend his pleadings to assert a right to recover \r\n  based on an oral modification.Â  Notwithstanding such failures, we conclude Leeâ€™s \r\n  pleadings should not preclude recovery in this case.Â  First, we note that Thermal \r\n  consistently asserted during trial that Lee was not entitled to recover because \r\n  the commissions he claimed were either not based on sales personally made by \r\n  him or that the sales were not of â€œpre-engineeredâ€ products.Â  Thermal never \r\n  asserted during trial that the pleadings limited Leeâ€™s recovery to commissions \r\n  from the sale of pre-engineered products only.Â  Having failed to object to the \r\n  courtâ€™s consideration of Leeâ€™s entitlement to commissions based on Leeâ€™s failure \r\n  to plead a modification of the Parties agreement, Thermal is considered to have \r\n  tried the issue by consent.Â  See Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. \r\n  Ctr., 330 S.C. 115, 125 n.2, 498 S.E.2d 408, 413 n.2 (Ct. App. 1998) (an \r\n  issue not expressly mentioned in the complaint but tried without objection and \r\n  incorporated in the trial courtâ€™s order is tried by consent according to Rule \r\n  15 SCRCP);Â  McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441, 447, 481 S.E. 2d 166, 169 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997) (issues tried by consent will be treated as if raised in the \r\n  pleadings).\r\nSecondly, even if the record \r\n  on appeal could be interpreted to show Thermal raised the oral modification \r\n  issue at trial, the issue must be both presented to and ruled upon by the trial \r\n  court before it will be considered on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. \r\n  Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998)(â€œIt is axiomatic that \r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€);Â  \r\n  First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œIt is a fundamental rule of law that an appellate \r\n  court will affirm a ruling by a lower court if the offended party does not challenge \r\n  that ruling.â€).\r\nWe now move to Thermalâ€™s \r\n  claim that the evidence does not support the trial courtâ€™s holding that the \r\n  contract in issue was orally amended.Â  â€œIt is true that a simple contract completely \r\n  reduced to writing cannot be changed or modified by parol evidence of what was \r\n  said or done by the parties at the time it was made, because the parties agree \r\n  to put the contract in writing and to make the writing part, and evidence thereof.â€Â  \r\n  Evatt v. Campbell, 234 S.C. 1, 6, 106 S.E.2d 447, 450 (1959) (quoting \r\n  Mebane v. Taylor, 164 S.C. 87, 94, 162 S.E. 65, 67 (1932)). â€œNevertheless, \r\n  by the rules of the common law it is competent for the parties to a simple contract \r\n  in writing before any breach of its provisions, either altogether to waive, \r\n  dissolve, or abandon it, or vary or qualify its terms, and thus make a new one.â€Â  \r\n  Id. â€œA written contract may, in the absence of statutory provisions requiring \r\n  a writing, be modified by a subsequent oral agreement.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, Best testified \r\n  that Thermal entered into the written agreement with Lee for the purpose of \r\n  securing orders for pre-engineered products so that its manufacturing division \r\n  could continue production even when its engineering division was working on \r\n  custom-designed items.Â  Apparently, however, very few orders materialized that \r\n  did not require the assistance of Thermalâ€™s in-house engineering division.Â  \r\n  Although Best stated he did not â€œknow how [Lee] got changed over to the selling \r\n  of other products,â€ he acknowledged that Thermal paid Lee for all orders he \r\n  solicited during the contract period at the same commission rate, regardless \r\n  of whether the items were pre-engineered.Â  Kerry Smith, Thermalâ€™s Vice President \r\n  and General Manager of the Control Division also acknowledged that Lee was never \r\n  refused a commission on the basis the order was not for a pre-engineered product.Â  \r\n  Moreover, Smith acknowledged that he discussed this with Lee, and approved of \r\n  him selling engineered products.\r\nFinally, Lee and Thermal \r\n  disagree as to the definition of â€œpre-engineeredâ€ and â€œengineeredâ€.Â  According \r\n  to Lee, Thermal never had any pre-engineered products to sell.Â  Smith acknowledged \r\n  it had few, if any, pre-engineered products and that most of the products Lee \r\n  sold wereÂ  â€œengineeredâ€ as he understood the term.Â  Counsel for Thermal maintained \r\n  there was an oral agreement to sell engineered products that â€œran parallelâ€ \r\n  to the written contract, but argued it was not incorporated into the written \r\n  contract;Â  therefore, the contractâ€™s notice provision was not applicable.Â  Thermalâ€™s \r\n  attorney conceded on Thermalâ€™s behalf that all of the jobs for which Lee was \r\n  compensated in the November 1995 payment, following Leeâ€™s termination, were \r\n  for â€œengineeredâ€ items.\r\nWhile acknowledging that \r\n  almost from the beginning Lee secured orders mostly for custom-made products \r\n  that required the services of Thermalâ€™s engineering division, Thermal nevertheless \r\n  paid Lee throughout the contract period for all orders he secured in his territory, \r\n  not just for pre-engineered products.Â  Thermal also continued to pay Lee commissions, \r\n  per the language of their written agreement, for orders procured by others in \r\n  his territory, although Lee did not participate in bringing the orders to the \r\n  company.\r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that the parties orally modified their written contract to encompass \r\n  paying Lee commissions for all products sold within Leeâ€™s exclusive territory, \r\n  regardless of whether the products were pre-engineered.Â  Accordingly, we affirm \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Lee was due $58,465.64 in unpaid commissions that \r\n  accrued during the period of the contract, and subsequent to termination, as \r\n  per the contractâ€™s residual notice provision.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Prejudgment Interest Award under \r\n  Rule 60(a)\r\nThermal next contends the \r\n  trial court committed reversible error in concluding Rule 60(a), SCRCP was an \r\n  appropriate vehicle for awarding prejudgment interest to Lee.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe judgment in this case was entered on August \r\n  23, 1999, but the Clerk of Court inadvertently failed to provide either party \r\n  with notice of entry of the judgment.Â  Leeâ€™s attorney discovered the order on \r\n  April 28, 2000.Â  On May 12, 2000, Lee Filed a motion under Rule 60(a), SCRCP \r\n  asserting the trial court mistakenly omitted an award of prejudgment interest \r\n  from the order, and that he was entitled to prejudgment interest on the unpaid \r\n  commissions as matter of law.Â  Thermal opposed the motion, arguing Rule 60(a) \r\n  was not a proper procedural mechanism for recovering prejudgment interest because \r\n  the failure to include interest was not the result of a clerical mistake.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court granted Leeâ€™s \r\n  motion and awarded him prejudgment interest of $16,901.61.Â  The court notedÂ  \r\n  Lee submitted a detailed chart at trial with calculations of the prejudgment \r\n  interest.Â  â€œIn addition, the parties agreed that the payment date for each invoice \r\n  was 60 days after the invoice date, unless shown otherwise.Â  Since payment of \r\n  [Leeâ€™s] commission was due fifteen days after [Thermal] received its invoice \r\n  payments, the commissions were due seventy-five days after the invoice payment \r\n  date.Â  [Leeâ€™s] exhibit 16 calculated interest at the rate of 8 and 3/4%, per \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 34-31-20(A).â€Â  The court found the amount of prejudgment interest \r\n  due was â€œeasily ascertainable from [Leeâ€™s] exhibit 16.â€Â  The court stated although \r\n  Leeâ€™s exhibit showed interest accruing after 60 days, the amount of interest \r\n  could be adjusted and â€œis easily ascertainable and calculable on the basis of \r\n  the record before this Court.â€\r\nThe statutory basis for the award of prejudgment interest \r\n  is section 34-31-20(A), which provides:\r\n\r\nIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein \r\n  any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and being due, shall draw interest \r\n  according to law, the legal interest rate shall be at the rateÂ  of eight and \r\n  three-fourths percent per annum.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann Â§ 34-31-20(A) (1987) (emphasis added).\r\nâ€œPrejudgment interest is \r\n  allowed on liabilities to pay money from the time when, either by agreement \r\n  of the parties or operation of law, the payment was demandable, if the sum is \r\n  certain or capable of being reduced to certaintyâ€¦.The right of a party to \r\n  prejudgment interest is not affected by rights of discount or setoff claimed \r\n  by the opposing party.Â  It is the character of the claim and not of the defense \r\n  to it that determines whether prejudgment interest is allowable.â€Â  S. Welding \r\n  Works, Inc. v. K &amp; S Constr. Co., 286 S.C. 158, 164, 332 S.E.2d 102, \r\n  106 (Ct. App. 1985) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nRule 60(a), SCRCP provides \r\n  â€œ[c]lerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors \r\n  therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at \r\n  any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such \r\n  notice, if any, as the court orders.â€\r\nWright &amp; Miller, discussing \r\n  the types of errors covered by the federal rule 60(a), which is virtually identical \r\n  to South Carolinaâ€™s rule, state in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe court may correct clerical errors and mathematical computations.Â  \r\n  It has been held that it also may correctâ€¦the addition of costs to a judgment.Â  \r\n  The judgment may be corrected by including interest if this is a matter of \r\n  right but not if allowing interest is discretionary.\r\n\r\n11Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \r\n  Â§ 2854 (1973).\r\nThe commentators further \r\n  state:\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable overlap between Rule 59(e) and Rule \r\n  60.Â  It has been held that a motion for amendment of the judgment to include \r\n  prejudgment interest is under Rule 60(a), and is not subject to the time limit \r\n  of Rule 59(e), if the party is entitled to interest as a matter of right, \r\n  but that if allowance of prejudgment interest is in the discretion of the court \r\n  then the ten-day limit of Rule 59(e) applies.\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 2817 (emphasis added).\r\nThere apparently was no real \r\n  dispute at trial that the statutory provision for prejudgment interest was applicable \r\n  to Leeâ€™s claim.Â  The trial court noted in its order that both parties agreed \r\n  that the pleadings would be construed to assert a claim for pre-judgment interest.Â  \r\n  The court found the amount of prejudgment interest was easily ascertainable \r\n  from the evidence presented during the trial.\r\nAlthough it is proper to \r\n  make this motion within the time limits of Rule 59(e), there is authority that \r\n  where interest is available as a matter of right, rather than discretion, the \r\n  interest may properly be sought in a Rule 60(a) motion.Â  See, e.g., State, \r\n  Personnel Bd. v. Akers, 797 So. 2d 422, 426 n.4 (Ala. 2000) (holding Court \r\n  has authority under Rule 60(a), Ala R. Civ. P., to correct omissions of pre-judgment \r\n  interest from a judgment where the court intended to grant pre-judgment interest, \r\n  but failed to do so, or where the judgment did not include pre-judgment interest \r\n  mandated by law);Â  Brooks v. Jackson, 813 P.2d 847, 849 (Colo. Ct. App. \r\n  1991) (The failure to include interest in a judgment, when the law provides \r\n  for the award of pre-judgment interest, is an oversight which fits squarely \r\n  within the parameters of Rule 60(a);Â  therefore, the addition of interest to \r\n  a verdict is a ministerial act that is mandatory and does not require the exercise \r\n  of judgment or discretion.).Â  But see Jennings v. Ibarra, 921 \r\n  P.2d 62, 65 (Colo. Ct App. 1996) (holding a Rule 60(a) motion could not be used \r\n  to include pre-judgment interest in the circumstances where it was clear the \r\n  trial court did not originally intend to make such an award. The court rejected \r\n  the position that a failure to include an award of mandatory pre-judgment interest \r\n  is always to be viewed as an oversight or omission which is correctable at any \r\n  time by amendment of the judgment under Rule 60(a).)\r\nBecause pre-judgment interest \r\n  is mandatory under the statute for this type of claim, we find no error in the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision to correct this omission under 60(a), especially in light \r\n  of the fact that the parties were not given notice of entry of the order in \r\n  the usual manner.1 \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s award of pre-judgment interest to Lee.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Sales Representatives Act,Â§ 39-65-10 to \r\n  -80\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thermal asserts the trial \r\n  court erred in applying the Sales Representatives Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-10 \r\n  to â€“80, to Leeâ€™s claims, because Lee did not solicit wholesale orders as required \r\n  by the Act.Â  Therefore, Thermal argues Lee was not entitled to punitive damages \r\n  or attorney fees.Â  We agree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Section 39-65-20 (Supp. 2001) provides: \r\n  â€œWhen a contract between a sales representative and a principalÂ  \r\n  is terminated for any reason, the principal shall pay the sales representative \r\n  all commissions that have or will accrue under the contract to the sales representative \r\n  according to the terms of the contract.â€Â  (emphasis added).\r\nThe Act defines a â€œprincipalâ€ as one who:\r\n\r\n(a) manufactures, produces, imports, or distributes \r\n  a tangible product for wholesale;\r\n(b)&nbsp;contracts with a sales representative to solicit orders for the \r\n  product;Â  and\r\n(c) compensates the sales representative, in whole or in \r\n  part, by commission.\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 39-65-10(3) (emphasis added).\r\nA â€œsales representativeâ€ is a person who:\r\n\r\n  (a)\r\n  contracts with a principal to \r\n  solicit wholesale orders;\r\n  (b) is compensated, in whole or in part by commission;\r\n  (c) does not place orders or purchase \r\n  for his own account or for resale;Â  and\r\n  (d)&nbsp; does not sell or take orders \r\n  for the sale of product to the ultimate consumer.\r\n\r\nId.Â§ 39-65-10(4) (emphasis added).\r\nWhere a violation of the \r\n  Act has occurred, the sales representative is entitled to sales commissions \r\n  plus punitive damages up to three times the amount of commissions due, plus \r\n  reasonable attorney fees and costs.Â  Id. Â§ 39-65-30.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory \r\n  construction is that we are to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of \r\n  the legislature.â€Â  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,Â  297 S.C. \r\n  520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989).Â  â€œ[W]ords used therein must be given their \r\n  plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to \r\n  limit or expand its operation.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, \r\n  309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  â€œThe language must also be read \r\n  in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general \r\n  purpose.â€Â  Id.Â  Where a word is not defined in a statute, our appellate \r\n  courts have looked to the usual dictionary meaning to supply its meaning.Â  See \r\n  e.g. Gulf Oil Corp. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 248 S.C. 267, 270, 149 S.E.2d \r\n  642, 643 (1966) (citing Websterâ€™s New International Dictionary for definition \r\n  of a statuteâ€™s reference to â€œpaid-in surplusâ€);Â  State v. Dickinson, \r\n  339 S.C. 194, 199, 528 S.E.2d 675, 677 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n  for definition of â€œobtainingâ€ in statute for obtaining property in fraudulent \r\n  manner);Â  State v. Estridge, 320 S.C. 288, 291, 465 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995) (referencing dictionary definition in determining legislative intent).\r\nThermal argues that the Act \r\n  only relates to commissions earned on â€œwholesale orders.â€ Thermal defines â€œwholesaleâ€ \r\n  as the sale of goods in quantity usually for resale by a retail merchant.Â  Thermal \r\n  argues that the Act is not applicable to this case because the items manufactured \r\n  by Thermal were sold for use by the purchaser or were sold to manufacturers \r\n  to be included in a complete piece of operational equipment.Â  Thermal contends \r\n  that neither of these sales can be considered wholesale.Â  Therefore it argues \r\n  Lee is not a sales representative as defined by the Act and is not entitled \r\n  to attorney fees or punitive damages.\r\nLee avers that the Legislature \r\n  passed the Sales Representative Act intending to cover all workers who are not \r\n  paid their wages or commissions.Â  Lee therefore argues that interpreting the \r\n  Act to limit its application to a narrower class of workers would only serve \r\n  to thwart the Legislative intent behind the Act.Â  Lee agrees with the definition \r\n  for wholesale employed by the trial court.Â  In holding the Sale Representatives \r\n  Act to be applicable in this case, the trial court stated only that it found \r\n  â€œthe definitions of â€˜wholesaleâ€™ and â€˜retailâ€™ as defined in Roland Elect. \r\n  Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657 (1946), to be persuasive.â€Â  In Roland, \r\n  the Supreme Court found among other definitions, that â€œwholesale salesâ€ means \r\n  buying goods for the purpose of reselling them, but could also refer to sales \r\n  of goods used for business purposes or made to commercial, professional, or \r\n  governmental users, rather than for personal or household consumption.Â  Id. \r\n  at 674-75.2Â  Lee contends \r\n  that Thermalâ€™s sales would be encompassed under this definition of â€œwholesaleâ€, \r\n  and he is thus entitled to attorney fees and punitive damages.\r\nOur Sales Representative \r\n  Act defines a sales representative for purposes of the Act as someone who â€œcontracts \r\n  with a principal to solicit wholesale orders.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-10(4).Â  \r\n  The South Carolina General Assembly did not include the definition of â€œwholesaleâ€ \r\n  or â€œwholesalerâ€ in this Act, and our research has revealed no South Carolina \r\n  case law that has defined these terms as they relate to this Act.Â  In interpreting \r\n  the words â€œwholesaleâ€ and â€œwholesalerâ€ we look to the plain and ordinary meaning \r\n  of these words.Â  â€œWholesaleâ€ is defined as â€œ[t]he sales of goods or commodities \r\n  [usually] for resale by a retailer, as opposed to a sale to the ultimate consumer.â€ \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1591 (7th ed. 1999).Â  A â€œwholesalerâ€ is â€œ[o]ne \r\n  who buys large quantities of goods and resells them in smaller quantities to \r\n  retailers or other merchants, who in turn sell to the ultimate consumer.â€ Id. \r\n  See Am. Delta Techs., Inc. v. RK Elec. Info. Concepts, 647 A.2d \r\n  1344, 1347 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1994) (stating where the terms â€œwholesaleâ€ \r\n  and â€œwholesale ordersâ€ were not defined in its sales representatives statutes, \r\n  â€œreference to the usual definition of those terms would apply;â€ the court noted \r\n  a â€œwholesalerâ€ is â€œ[o]ne who buys in comparatively large quantities, and then \r\n  resells, usually in smaller quantities, but never to the ultimate consumerâ€)(citing \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary).\r\nWe are persuaded that the \r\n  Legislature intended the usual dictionary meaning to apply to the term â€œwholesale,â€ \r\n  and in so intending, limited the application of this Act to a specific class \r\n  of workers.Â  We decline to extend the meaning of wholesale as advocated by Lee.Â  \r\n  Whether or not all sales representative paid commissions should be covered under \r\n  this Act is a question better addressed by the Legislature.\r\nWe find support for our definition \r\n  of â€œwholesaleâ€ in at least one other jurisdiction that has considered this issue \r\n  in a case involving similar facts.Â  In Hoffman v. Van Pak Corp., 16 S.W. \r\n  3d 684 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000), the Missouri Court of Appeals held that an employer \r\n  which manufactured electrical control systems was not a principal within the \r\n  meaning of its statutes allowing damages to sale representatives who are not \r\n  timely paid.\r\nThe employer primarily custom-manufactured each \r\n  product after it was ordered and thus was mostly selling to end users, although \r\n  some sales were made at wholesale.Â  The Missouri court rejected the broader \r\n  definitions of â€œwholesaleâ€ found in Roland Electrical Co.3Â  The Hoffman court \r\n  noted:\r\n\r\nThe statute uses the word â€œwholesaleâ€ in defining both â€œprincipalâ€ and â€œsales \r\n  representative.â€ We presume that the legislature did not insert idle verbiage \r\n  or superfluous language in the statute.Â  Each word, clause, sentence, and section \r\n  of a statute should be given meaning.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in its use of the word â€œwholesaleâ€ the \r\n  legislature intended to address a problem in the wholesale distribution system \r\n  and wholesale markets and did not intend to create additional remedies for all \r\n  salespersons who are paid by commission.Â  Whether such a remedy should be extended \r\n  to all commissioned salespeople is a question for the legislature, not the courts.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 689-90 (citations omitted).\r\nIn order to recover attorney \r\n  fees and punitive damages, Lee must fit within the parameters of a â€œsales representativeâ€ \r\n  as defined in this Act.Â  The evidence at trial was that Lee solicited orders \r\n  of control panels to manufacturers, who in turn used the items to manufacture \r\n  equipment.Â  Thus, those placing the orders were, for the most part, the ultimate \r\n  consumer or end user of the products.Â  Further, Lee himself testified that the \r\n  use of the concepts of â€œwholesaleâ€ and â€œretailâ€ have no application to his work.Â  \r\n  We find that Lee does not fit within the meaning of â€œsales representativeâ€ as \r\n  defined by the Act, and therefore, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that \r\n  the Sales Representative Act is applicable to Leeâ€™s claims and, consequently, \r\n  reverse the courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Lee.\r\nLeeâ€™s Appeal\r\nLee contends the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in failing to award him punitive damages under the Sales \r\n  Representatives Act.Â  Because we conclude the Act was not applicable to Leeâ€™s \r\n  claim, we affirm the courtâ€™s denial of punitive damages.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we affirm the trial courtâ€™s award of past due commissions and pre-judgment interest.Â  \r\n  Based on our finding that the Sales Representative Act4 does not apply to Leeâ€™s action because \r\n  he does not deal in wholesale sales, we affirm the courtâ€™s denial of punitive \r\n  damages under the Act and reverse the courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decision below is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\r\nSTILLWELL and SHULER,\r\nJJ. concur.\r\n\r\n  1 Cf.Calhoun v.

Teer, of Greenville; \r\n  for Appellant\r\nRonald K. Wray, II, Esq., Andrea Hawkins, \r\n  of Greenville; for Respondents.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Marietta \r\n  Garage, Inc., appeals the grant of summary judgment to the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Public Safety in an action for damages Marietta allegedly sustained from \r\n  the removal of its name from a wrecker rotation list.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe South Carolina Highway Patrol, pursuant to regulations \r\n  promulgated by the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, maintainsÂ  wrecker \r\n  rotation lists within established towing zones to provide towing services to \r\n  motorists. [1] Â  The regulations provide that, \r\n  unless the owner or driver of a wrecked or disabled vehicle requests a specific \r\n  wrecker service to tow the vehicle, the Patrol contacts a wrecker service from \r\n  the rotation list for the zone where towing is required. \r\n  [2] Â  Companies on the list are contacted in the order in which they \r\n  appear. [3] Â  To remain on the rotation list \r\n  for a particular towing zone, a wrecker service must be either physically located \r\n  within the zone or maintain a separate business and storage lot within the zone. \r\n  [4] Â  \r\nMarietta has been on various wrecker rotation lists since the Department adopted \r\n  this practice.Â  On November 8, 1995, the Patrol approved Mariettaâ€™s request \r\n  to be placed on the list for zone 5, where Marietta had an office and access \r\n  to a storage facility. Â The office and storage facility were on the premises \r\n  of Fender Mender, a business located at 205 North Pleasantburg Drive.Â  Marietta \r\n  had an oral agreement with Fender Mender allowing Marietta to store vehicles \r\n  on Fender Menderâ€™s property in exchange for splitting the storage fees. \r\nOn February 8, 1996, the \r\n  Patrol contacted Marietta to tow a vehicle belonging to Chris Busha.Â  Busha \r\n  had been involved in a single-car accident about one-half mile from Mariettaâ€™s \r\n  North Pleasantburg Drive location.\r\nRobert Pritchett, \r\n  Mariettaâ€™s general manager, went to the scene to tow the vehicle to the North \r\n  Pleasantburg Drive location.Â  When Pritchett arrived at Fender Mender, \r\n  however, he noticed the Marietta Garage sign was missing and the lock had been \r\n  cut.Â  Pritchett then towed the vehicle to Mariettaâ€™s home office, which \r\n  was approximately sixteen miles from the accident scene.\r\nSubsequently, unbeknownst \r\n  to Marietta, Jean Busha, Chris Bushaâ€™s mother, complained to the Patrol about \r\n  the towing charge for her sonâ€™s vehicle.Â  After receiving Jean Bushaâ€™s \r\n  complaint, Lt. Kimbrell of the Patrol drove to the North Pleasantburg Drive \r\n  location and learned from the proprietors of Fender Mender that Fender \r\n  Mender and Marietta had ceased doing business with each other.Â  On February \r\n  16, 1996, Marietta was removed from the rotation list for zone 5 without a hearing \r\n  and was notified in writing of the removal a few days later.\r\nMarietta requested a hearing \r\n  to contest its removal from the rotation list.Â  The request was granted, \r\n  and the hearing took place June 10, 1996.Â  At the hearing, Marietta informed \r\n  the Patrol that it had acquired a new location in zone 5.Â  The Patrol inspected the new site and, on November 10, \r\n  1996, reinstated Marietta to the rotation list for zone 5.Â  \r\n  On November 26, 1996, however, the Department informed Marietta in writing that \r\n  it was upholding the earlier decision to remove Marietta from the list â€œfor \r\n  the simple reason that the location of 205 [North] Pleasantburg Drive is no \r\n  longer occupied by Marietta Garage.â€\r\nAfter receiving this notification \r\n  from the Department, Marietta filed a complaint in the circuit court against \r\n  the Department requesting damages allegedly resulting from gross negligence \r\n  on the part of the Department and from the unconstitutional taking of Mariettaâ€™s \r\n  property rights. [5] Â  Marietta determined it had missed about twenty rotation calls during the time \r\n  it was off the rotation list for zone 5 up until the administrative hearing \r\n  on June 10, 1996.\r\nBoth sides moved for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  On October 17, 1997, the circuit court issued an order denying summary \r\n  judgment to Marietta and granting summary judgment to the Department. \r\nMarietta appealed the grant \r\n  of summary judgment to the Department.Â  On September 17, 1999, this court, in \r\n  a published opinion, affirmed the grant of summary judgment on Mariettaâ€™s gross \r\n  negligence claim, but further held the Department violated the South Carolina \r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA) by failing to conduct a pre-removal hearing \r\n  before removing Marietta from the rotation list for zone 5. [6] Â  Because of the determination \r\n  that â€œ[t]he Departmentâ€™s failure to provide Marietta notice and a hearing prior \r\n  to actual removal violated the APA,â€ the case was remanded to the circuit court \r\n  for further proceedings. [7] \r\nOn remand, the Department \r\n  again moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted the motion, holding \r\n  (1) Mariettaâ€™s claim for damages as a result of the Departmentâ€™s APA violation \r\n  was moot, and (2) Marietta could not recover damages for inverse condemnation \r\n  because it had failed to allege a compensable property interest.Â  Again, \r\n  Marietta appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Marietta first argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in ruling that its claim for damages under the APA was moot.Â  We disagree.\r\n&nbsp;â€œA case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, \r\n  will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is \r\n  true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to \r\n  grant effectual relief.â€ [8] \r\nIn the present case, there is no meaningful relief \r\n  that either this court or the trial court could now give Marietta.Â  In this \r\n  courtâ€™s prior opinion, we held the Department had violated the APA by failing \r\n  to hold a hearing before removing Marietta from the rotation list. \r\n  [9] Â  Notwithstanding the finding that a violation occurred, Marietta \r\n  received a hearing and was eventually reinstated to the list.Â  The only question \r\n  remaining is whether Marietta is entitled to money damages for the APA violation \r\n  as compensation for the time it was not on the list.\r\nThe APA allows a party to seek judicial review \r\n  upon exhaustion of administrative remedies. [10] Â  It does not, however, specifically provide for \r\n  the assessment of civil penalties against an agency found to be in violation \r\n  of its provisions.Â  We have not foundâ€”nor has Marietta directed our attention \r\n  toâ€”any authority indicating that an aggrieved party may seek money damages under \r\n  the APA or under any analogous legislation absent an express provision recognizing \r\n  such a claim. [11] \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marietta further contends the circuit court erred in granting summary \r\n  judgment to the Department on Mariettaâ€™s inverse condemnation claim, contending \r\n  it was â€œdeprived . . . of a protected property right without compensation.â€Â  \r\n  We hold summary judgment was proper.\r\nTo prove an inverse condemnation, a plaintiff must show: \r\n  (1) an affirmative, positive, aggressive act on the part of the governmental \r\n  agency; (2) a taking; (3) the taking is for a public use; and (4) the taking \r\n  has some degree of permanence. \r\n  [12] Â  â€œThe threshold inquiry is whether the property interest affected \r\n  is inherent in the plaintiffâ€™s ownership rights or completely dependent upon \r\n  regulatory licensing.â€ [13] Â Â Â  \r\nIn Pritchett v. Alford, \r\n  [14]  the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, once a wrecker \r\n  service is placed on a wrecker rotation list, it acquires a constitutionally \r\n  protected property right not to be removed from the list without Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment procedural due process requirements. [15] Â  Nonetheless, we hold that, \r\n  even when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to Marietta, the \r\n  inverse condemnation claim must fail because there is nothing to suggest that \r\n  there was a taking for a public use.Â  \r\nMarietta argues only that the rotation list was â€œa list maintained \r\n  for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€Â  Like the plaintiff in Gasque v. Town of Conway, [16]  who unsuccessfully claimed damages resulting \r\n  from the refusal of the municipal authorities to grant him a permit to build \r\n  and operate a gasoline filling station within the town, Marietta cannot show, \r\n  either â€œdirectly or indirectly,â€  [17]  that its place on the rotation list was â€œsubjected \r\n  to a public useâ€ [18]  \r\n  during the time Marietta was removed from the list. \r\n  [19] Â  At best, it has demonstrated only that its removal benefitted \r\n  other wrecker services on the rotation list.\r\n  &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marietta also contends the circuit court inaccurately portrayed \r\n  several allegations as undisputed facts in the case.Â  The specific findings \r\n  with which Marietta appears to take issue concern:Â  (1) whether Department regulations \r\n  require that a lot be inspected before it is placed on the wrecker rotation \r\n  list; (2) whether the rules and regulations of the Department require notification \r\n  for a change of address within a zone; (3) whether Marietta at all times had \r\n  maintained a storage lot within zone 5; (4) whether a predeprivation hearing \r\n  was feasible; (5) whether circumstances necessitated quick removal of Marietta \r\n  by the Department from the rotation list; and (6) whether there was ample opportunity \r\n  for the State to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before suspending \r\n  Marietta from the wrecker rotation list.Â  We agree with the Department that \r\n  these concerns, even if resolved in Mariettaâ€™s favor, would not affect the result \r\n  in this case insofar as our holdings are based on our analysis of the APA and \r\n  our determination that there was no evidence that the alleged taking was for \r\n  a public use.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]\r\n  Â Â  At the time of the lawsuit, \r\n    the pertinent regulations were found at 25A S.C.

Johnston, of Greenville; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, \r\n  J.:Â  This is a legal malpractice action.Â  The trial \r\n  court granted summary judgment to Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Guerard, LLP \r\n  (Haynsworth), holding Robert W. Binkley and Susan B. Binkley failed to file \r\n  their lawsuit within the applicable limitations period.Â  The Binkleys appeal.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Binkleys purchased lakefront property in the \r\n  Lakeview Acres subdivision in Greenville County, South Carolina.Â  Haynsworth \r\n  conducted the closing on Lot 8, the subject property, on April 19, 1991.\r\nÂ On May 2, 1991, Haynsworth sent the Binkleys their \r\n  deed to Lot 8 along with a letter indicating the law firm had performed a title \r\n  examination of the property.Â  According to the letter, Haynsworth concluded \r\n  the Binkleys were vested with a marketable fee simple title to the premises, \r\n  subject to several exceptions.Â  Included in the list of exceptions was \r\n  an â€œ[e]asement for construction and impoundment given to Rabon Creek Watershed \r\n  Conservation District recorded in Deed Book 211 at Page 657, Office of the Clerk \r\n  of Court for Laurens County and Deed Book 1169 at Page 88 in the RMC Office \r\n  for Greenville County.â€Â  The Binkleys, however, assumed the mailing contained \r\n  only the deed to their property, and Robert Binkley placed it in his safe without \r\n  reading it.Â  This letter was apparently the only communication between \r\n  Haynsworth and the Binkleys about the easement. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn August 7, 1991, the Binkleys \r\n  entered into a contract for the construction of their home on Lot 8.Â  The \r\n  contract noted the first floor of the home would be constructed two feet above \r\n  the 100-year floodplain level.Â  In his deposition, however, Robert Binkley \r\n  conceded that, before construction of the home commenced, he was aware that \r\n  the lower level of the building would be in the floodplain. \r\n  [1] \r\nOn November 4, 1991, \r\n  Haynsworth closed on a mortgage given by the Binkleys to American Federal Bank \r\n  and secured by Lot 8.Â  A few days before the closing, a plat had been \r\n  prepared indicating the elevation of the dam spillway would be higher than the \r\n  elevation of the lower level of the Binkleysâ€™ proposed home.Â  Robert \r\n  Binkley admitted he saw the plat and was aware of the elevations.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the Binkleys signed a release at the closing that stated they knew the basement \r\n  of their home was within the 100-year floodplain level.Â  The Binkleys waived \r\n  the option of flood insurance and proceeded with construction on their \r\n  home.\r\nThe Binkleys subsequently \r\n  purchased Lot 9 in Lakeview Acres.Â  Lot 9 lies next to Lot 8Â  and is also lakefront \r\n  property.Â  Haynsworth performed the closing on March 2, 1992.Â  This time, \r\n  however, Haynsworth did not conduct a title search on the property.\r\nIn August 1995, heavy \r\n  rains caused water impounded by the Rabon Creek Watershed District to back up \r\n  onto the Binkleysâ€™ property and flood the basement of their home.Â  After \r\n  the flood, Rabon Creek informed the Binkleys and other homeowners affected by \r\n  the rain that it claimed an easement to the top of the dam and set out flags \r\n  to indicate the boundary lines of the easement around the lake.Â  The \r\n  pin locations indicated that the easement claimed by Rabon Creek covered all \r\n  of Lot 8 and almost all of Lot 9.Â  It was only after the flood that the \r\n  Binkleys read the letter from Haynsworth advising them of the easement that \r\n  encumbered Lot 8. \r\nOn June 7, 1996, the Binkleys \r\n  sued Rabon Creek.Â  In addition to damages, the Binkleys sought a declaratory \r\n  judgment regarding the extent and enforceability of the easement. (Binkley \r\n  I)Â  Rabon Creek counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment, asking the court \r\n  to construe the easement and determine its extent.\r\nBoth sides moved for summary \r\n  judgment on the interpretation of the easement agreement.Â  The trial \r\n  court, Judge Kittredge presiding, held a hearing on the motions on September \r\n  17, 1996.Â  On December 23, 1996, Judge Kittredge issued an order on the \r\n  motions holding (1) the language of the easement was ambiguous as to its extent \r\n  and scope, thus necessitating resort to the intention of the parties to the \r\n  easement; (2) the parties intended the easement to allow Rabon Creek to â€œstoreâ€ \r\n  water to create a lake level of 700.5 feet; and (3) during periods of heavy \r\n  rain, Rabon Creek could allow the â€œflowageâ€ of water up to and over the top \r\n  of the dam to an elevation of 725.2 feet. [2] Â  The order further noted that \r\n  â€œ[v]arious issues remain to be determined,â€ such as the Binkleysâ€™ contention \r\n  that Rabon Creek should not be allowed to enforce the easement for equitable \r\n  reasons.Â  Pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure, final judgment was entered to the extent of the issues decided by \r\n  the order. [3] Â  By consent of the parties, \r\n  all remaining claims and defenses were dismissed with prejudice.\r\nÂ On February 27, 1997, \r\n  the Binkleys commenced this action against Haynsworth alleging Haynsworth committed \r\n  professional malpractice in â€œfailing to disclose the existence of the [e]asement \r\n  or its impact.â€ [4] Â  (Binkley II)Â  \r\n  On August 7, 1997, Judge Kittredge signed a consent order consolidating \r\n  this lawsuit with cases brought by other homeowners who had experienced flooding \r\n  during the same event that damaged the Binkleys.Â  This consolidation was for \r\n  the limited purposes of construing the extent of the easement and considering \r\n  the affirmative defenses to enforcement of the easement.Â  On September \r\n  8, 1997, Haynsworth filed an answer, cross-complaint, and third-party complaint \r\n  against Rabon Creek in Binkley II, alleging among other things that Rabon \r\n  Creek was estopped from enforcing the easement against the Binkleys and other \r\n  homeowners.Â  Judge Kittredge issued an order on September 12, 1997, in \r\n  which he granted summary judgment as to the existence of the easement but found \r\n  that genuine issues of material fact existed as to its scope and extent.Â  \r\n  After a trial on the merits on February 17 and 18, 1998, Judge Kittredge \r\n  issued an order on May 5, 1998, construing the easement documents and finding \r\n  Rabon Creek was estopped from enforcing the easement against the homeowners, \r\n  but could enforce it against John Burry, the party granting the easement.\r\nIn the meantime, on August \r\n  19, 1997, the Binkleys moved under Rule 60 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure for relief from the summary judgment order in Binkley I issued \r\n  by Judge Kittredge on December 23, 1996.Â  Later, on June 30, 1998, the \r\n  Binkleys moved to amend their complaint to assert a claim for equitable relief \r\n  based on the doctrine of estoppel and to assert causes of action against Rabon \r\n  Creek based on inverse condemnation, negligence, and trespass.Â  Finding \r\n  his December 1996 order in Binkley I contained inconsistencies that would \r\n  prejudice the Binkleys, Judge Kittredge vacated the order and, on October 2, \r\n  1998, granted the Binkleysâ€™ motion for consolidation.\r\nRabon Creek appealed both \r\n  Judge Kittredgeâ€™s order limiting its enforcement of the easement to Burry and \r\n  Judge Kittredgeâ€™s order vacating his order of December 23, 1996, and consolidating \r\n  Binkley I and Binkley II.Â  On appeal, this court held (1) the \r\n  easement extended to the top of the dam; (2) the recording of the easement gave \r\n  constructive notice to the homeowners; and (3) Rabon Creek was not equitably \r\n  estopped from enforcing the easement. \r\n  [5]  \r\nWhile Rabon Creekâ€™s appeal \r\n  was pending, the Binkleysâ€™ malpractice claim proceeded in the trial court.Â  \r\n  On December 7, 1998, Haynsworth moved for summary judgment, alleging the claim \r\n  was barred by the statute of limitations. \r\nOn March 8, 2000, the trial \r\n  court, Judge Hall presiding, held a hearing on the motion.Â  On March \r\n  15, 2000, Judge Hall issued an order granting summary judgment to Haynsworth \r\n  on the ground that the Binkleysâ€™ malpractice claim was untimely as to their \r\n  purchases of both Lot 8 and Lot 9.Â  On March 24, 2000, the Binkleys moved \r\n  for reconsideration, alteration, or amendment of the judgment pursuant to Rules \r\n  59(e) and 60(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Judge Hall \r\n  denied their motion by order dated April 24, 2000.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  NOTICE\r\nThe Binkleys first argue that, â€œ[b]ecause the issue \r\n  of notice had been previously litigated and decided in Judge Kittredgeâ€™s Order, \r\n  Judge Hall erred in re-addressing this issue and deciding it in a way that is \r\n  in conflict with Judge Kittredgeâ€™s previous Order.â€Â  In support of their position, \r\n  the Binkleys contend (1) the prior pending appeal of Judge Kittredgeâ€™s order \r\n  divested the trial court of jurisdiction to decide this issue; (2) the findings \r\n  in Judge Kittredgeâ€™s prior order are the law of the case; (3) Judge Hall did \r\n  not have the power to review, modify, affirm, or reverse Judge Kittredgeâ€™s findings; \r\n  and (4) Haynsworth was judicially estopped from adopting a position that was \r\n  contrary to the position it took on that issue in the prior hearing before Judge \r\n  Kittredge.Â  We disagree with these arguments.\r\nA.Â  Jurisdiction\r\nAt the summary judgment motion hearing before Judge \r\n  Hall, the Binkleys argued the motion should be stayed while the appeal of Judge \r\n  Kittredgeâ€™s order was pending.\r\nAs noted in this courtâ€™s prior opinion, Judge Kittredgeâ€™s \r\n  order held as follows:\r\n\r\n1) the language of the easement was ambiguous, but other \r\n  evidence demonstrated the parties intended for the easement to extend to the \r\n  top of the dam; 2) the Homeowners did not have actual or constructive knowledge \r\n  that Rabon Creek claimed an easement to the top of the dam; and 3) Rabon Creek \r\n  was equitably estopped from enforcing the easement against the Homeowners. \r\n  [6] Â  \r\n\r\nOnce an appeal is filed, the appellate court has \r\n  exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. \r\n  [7] Â  The tribunal from which the appeal is taken, however, may proceed \r\n  with matters unaffected by the appeal. \r\n  [8] \r\nÂ In contrast to the issues before Judge Kittredge, \r\n  the issue before Judge Hall was whether Haynsworthâ€™s disclosure to the Binkleys \r\n  of the presence of the easement put the Binkleys on inquiry notice that â€œsome \r\n  claim against another party might exist.â€ \r\n  [9] Â  Because the accrual date for determining when the statute of \r\n  limitations had begun to run did not depend on findings concerning the extent \r\n  and enforceability of the easement, we hold Judge Hall was correct in proceeding \r\n  with the summary judgment motion.\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Law of the Case \r\n\r\nThe Binkleys further argue that, because Haynsworth \r\n  had chosen not to appeal Judge Kittredgeâ€™s order, Haynsworth must accept the \r\n  rulings in that order as the law of the case. [10] Â  As with the \r\n  Binkleysâ€™ argument concerning jurisdiction, we hold the question of notice regarding \r\n  the existence of an easement is distinct from the question of notice as it relates \r\n  to the scope and enforceability of the easement.Â  We therefore hold that, although \r\n  the law of the case doctrine may preclude Haynsworth from challenging Judge \r\n  Kittredgeâ€™s finding that the Binkleys did not have notice of the scope and enforceability \r\n  of the easement, the doctrine does not prevent Haynsworth from raising the issue \r\n  of when the Binkleys had notice of the existence of the easement.\r\nC.Â  Judge Hallâ€™s Authority to Review Judge Kittredgeâ€™s Order\r\nThe Binkleys argue that Judge Hall effectively reversed \r\n  Judge Kittredgeâ€™s prior order.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, one circuit court judge may not reverse \r\n  or modify the order of another circuit court judge. \r\n  [11] Â  In the present case, the issues before Judge Kittredge and \r\n  Judge Hall were easily distinguishable.Â  Judge Kittredge determined that Rabon \r\n  Creekâ€™s easement was ambiguous, that the homeowners had no actual or constructive \r\n  notice of it, and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel limited Rabon Creekâ€™s \r\n  enforcement rights.Â  Judge Hall addressed the question of when the Binkleys \r\n  knew or should have known that they had a potential claim for legal malpractice \r\n  against Haynsworth and determined that they had at least inquiry notice of their \r\n  claim when Haynsworth advised them that the easement existed. [12] Â  \r\nD.Â  Judicial Estoppel\r\nThe Binkleys argue that Haynsworth, as a party to \r\n  and a participant in the litigation before Judge Kittredge â€œtook the position \r\n  that [a]ppellants and the other homeowners did not have notice that the flood \r\n  easement burdened their propertyâ€ and â€œshould therefore be judicially estopped \r\n  from adopting a conflicting position on the issue of notice for purposes of \r\n  its summary judgment motion.â€Â  In our view, however, the doctrine of \r\n  judicial estoppel is inapplicable here.\r\nâ€œJudicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting \r\n  a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.â€ \r\n  [13] Â  â€œThe purpose or function of the doctrine is to protect the \r\n  integrity of the judicial process or the integrity of courts rather than to \r\n  protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries.â€ [14] Â  Generally, the doctrine applies \r\n  to only inconsistent statements of fact and not to conclusions of law or assertions \r\n  of different legal theories. [15]   \r\nAt the hearing before Judge Kittredge, Haynsworth \r\n  took the position that the easement could not be enforced against the Binkleys \r\n  and other homeowners because the easement documents were vague and ambiguous \r\n  and because Rabon Creek failed to notify the homeowners that it claimed an easement \r\n  to the top of the dam.Â  When the case came before Judge Hall on Haynsworthâ€™s \r\n  summary judgment motion, the question was not the interpretation of the easement \r\n  but when the Binkleys had knowledge sufficient to put a reasonable person in \r\n  their situation on notice of the existence of a possible claim against Haynsworth.\r\nII.Â  SUMMARY \r\n  JUDGMENT\r\nThe Binkleys argue there was a question of fact as \r\n  to when they were put on notice that they had a claim against Haynsworth and \r\n  summary judgment was therefore inappropriate.Â  We disagree.\r\nA. Lot 8\r\nThe Binkleys do not dispute the premise that the applicable \r\n  limitations period for their claim against Haynsworth is three years. [16] Â  Moreover, they \r\n  do not take issue with the principle that â€œactions must be commenced within \r\n  three years after the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence \r\n  should have known that he had a cause of action.â€ [17] \r\nReviewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the Binkleys, we hold Judge Hall correctly determined that, as a matter of \r\n  law, they knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known \r\n  that they had a cause of action no later than November 4, 1991.Â  Robert Binkley \r\n  admitted he received Haynsworthâ€™s letter dated May 2, 1991, advising him and \r\n  his wife about the existence of the easement in question.Â  Moreover, the Binkleys \r\n  knew their property was located near the spillway.Â  Indeed, Robert Binkley took \r\n  specific steps to ensure that the main living floor of the house would be above \r\n  the floodplain level.Â  \r\nIn addition, at the loan closing on November 4, 1991, \r\n  the Binkleys signed a release indicating they had actual knowledge that their \r\n  property was in a floodplain, but elected not to purchase flood insurance.Â  \r\n  \r\nWithout question, then, as early as May 1991, the \r\n  Binkleys had inquiry notice of a possible claim against Haynsworth regarding \r\n  the easement.Â  By November 4, 1991, they had actual notice of the risk of flooding \r\n  to their property. [18] Â  The Binkleys \r\n  had, then, the responsibility to investigate their claim once they had information \r\n  that would place a reasonable person on notice that they had a possible cause \r\n  of action.Â  \r\nFinally, we reject the Binkleysâ€™ argument that knowledge \r\n  of the existence of the easement was insufficient to provide them with notice \r\n  that they may have sustained damages.Â  An easement by its very nature involves \r\n  the right to encroach upon anotherâ€™s property. \r\n  [19] Â  Moreover, once a reasonable person has reason to believe â€œthat \r\n  some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party \r\n  might exist,â€ [20]  the requirement \r\n  of reasonable diligence to investigate this information further takes precedence \r\n  over the inability to ascertain the amount of damages or even the possibility \r\n  that damages may be forthcoming at all. \r\n  [21] \r\nB. Lot 9\r\nThe Binkleys state in their brief that all the arguments \r\n  advanced regarding Lot 8 apply equally to Lot 9.Â  Because we have upheld Judge \r\n  Hallâ€™s determination that the Binkleysâ€™ malpractice action regarding Lot 8 was \r\n  barred by the statute of limitations, we likewise hold their action concerning \r\n  Lot 9 was untimely as well.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  Robert Binkley also admitted that, when he \r\n    looked at Lot 8, he understood there was a dam close by that was owned by \r\n    a public entity and the land upstream from the dam could be flooded â€œup to \r\n    probably the spillway.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  The order, however, further \r\n    noted that â€œthe spillway (assuming proper operation) will almost certainly \r\n    preclude â€˜flowageâ€™ beyond 718 feet.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3] Â Â  See Rule 54(b), SCRCP (stating \r\n    â€œ[w]hen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action . . . , the \r\n    court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer \r\n    than all of the claims or partiesâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  In addition to Haynsworth, the Binkleys also named \r\n    as defendants John Burry, the developer of Lakeview Acres; Donald Harper, \r\n    their predecessor-in-title for Lot 9; Greenville County; and Fant Engineering \r\n    and Surveying Company.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â Â  Binkley v.

Follin was convicted of aiding and abetting embezzlement, conspiracy, \r\n  and obtaining goods and services by false pretenses.Â  She was sentenced to ten \r\n  years, suspended upon the service of four years and five years probation, for \r\n  aiding and abetting embezzlement.Â  On the conspiracy charge, she was sentenced \r\n  to three years, to run concurrent with the aiding and abetting sentence.Â  She \r\n  was sentenced to three years for obtaining property by false pretenses, to run \r\n  concurrently with the other sentences.\r\nFollin argues on appeal \r\n  that the trial court: (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction; (2) punished her \r\n  for exercising her right to a jury trial; (3) erred in denying her motion for \r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict and motion in arrest of judgment as to \r\n  the charges of criminal conspiracy, aiding and abetting embezzlement, and obtaining \r\n  goods and services by false pretenses; and (4) erred in denying her motions \r\n  for directed verdict as to the charges of criminal conspiracy, aiding and abetting \r\n  embezzlement, and obtaining goods and services by false pretenses.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThe charges against Follin \r\n  stemmed from an investigation into the diversion of nearly $2.5 million from \r\n  Sumter County School District 17 (District 17) by Adolph Joseph Klein, the Assistant \r\n  Superintendent in charge of Financial Affairs for District 17.Â  Follin, a travel \r\n  agent and owner of Follin Travel, handled the travel arrangements for District \r\n  17 from 1988 to 1997.Â  Follin dealt exclusively with Klein.Â  She made a commission \r\n  on every trip she booked which was actually taken.\r\nKlein had two methods of \r\n  diverting funds.Â  First, with the assistance of James Benjamin â€œBenjiâ€ Adams, \r\n  Klein directed over $1.5 million of District 17 funds as payment to fraudulent \r\n  corporations created by Adams.Â  Kleinâ€™s second scheme involved having District \r\n  17 pay for nearly $1.5 million in personal travel expenses for Klein, his friends, \r\n  and his family to travel to Mardi Gras, to go skiing in Colorado, to go on cruises, \r\n  and to go to various sporting events around the country.Â  As part of his travel \r\n  scheme, from 1987 to 1995, Klein booked luxury vacations, which he termed â€œjunket \r\n  travel,â€ through Follin for himself, friends, and people from out of state.Â  \r\n  He then filed a requisition of funds form with District 17, which appeared to \r\n  request payment for legitimate District 17 business.Â  No invoice for this travel \r\n  existed.Â  After District 17 issued a check to Follin Travel without an invoice \r\n  number listed on it, Klein attached a note instructing Follin to apply those \r\n  funds to an invoice number representing Kleinâ€™s junket travel.\r\nIn 1995, Klein learned that \r\n  if travel plans made one week were cancelled before the Friday of that same \r\n  week, no payment would be required on the trip, the invoice would be voided, \r\n  and the invoice number would no longer appear in Follinâ€™s computerized accounting \r\n  system.Â  He began using invoices to get District 17 to pay for his junket travel.Â  \r\n  Klein would request an invoice from Follin for what appeared to be legitimate \r\n  travel for a school group or a District 17 employee.Â  Klein would then request \r\n  that Follin void the invoice prior to the Friday of that week.Â  Follin would \r\n  cancel the trip in her computer and stamp â€œvoidâ€ on her copy of the invoice.Â  \r\n  However, Klein submitted his clean copy of the invoice to District 17 for payment.Â  \r\n  Klein called these invoices â€œspecial invoicesâ€ for the junket travel.Â  After \r\n  the check was issued to Follin on the special invoice, Klein would attach a \r\n  note to the check identifying for Follin the invoice number to which she should \r\n  apply the check.Â  The invoice number did not match the number on the special \r\n  invoice submitted to District 17 for payment but matched the invoice number \r\n  of another of Kleinâ€™s junket trips.\r\nPhilip K. Davis, the accountant \r\n  for District 17, assisted Klein in his scheme by not reporting the payments \r\n  for junket travel.Â  However, Davisâ€™ accounting firmâ€™s contract with District \r\n  17 ended after the 1994-95 school year and a new accounting firm was hired.Â  \r\n  Klein, as the person in charge of the districtâ€™s financial matters, had sole \r\n  approval of invoices and access to the check-signing machine, which generated \r\n  his and the superintendentâ€™s signatures on the checks.Â  Thus, the checks had \r\n  the appearance of being approved by both parties.\r\nThe investigation began \r\n  in September 1997 when District 17 officials learned that Klein approved travel \r\n  and funding for School Board member Ione Dwyer to travel to New York to watch \r\n  the chorus perform.Â  Because the School Board had previously refused Dwyerâ€™s \r\n  request for funding, District 17Â  Superintendent Dr. Andrena Ray investigated \r\n  Klein.Â  The investigation revealed that Klein approved invoices requesting travel \r\n  funds for school groups and individuals working within District 17.Â  However, \r\n  after questioning the sponsors of the school trips, Dr. Ray learned that, despite \r\n  the fact that District 17 paid Follin Travel for the trips, many of the school \r\n  groups never went on the trips.Â  An auditor began reviewing Kleinâ€™s travel files \r\n  for 1997.\r\nKlein learned of the audit \r\n  and contacted Follin at her home on a Sunday in October 1997.Â  The two met at \r\n  Follinâ€™s office.Â  At Kleinâ€™s request, Follin created false, back-dated records \r\n  which indicated that District 17 was owed a credit of approximately $70,000 \r\n  because several of the school-related trips paid for by the district were cancelled.Â  \r\n  Klein and Adams later delivered several cashierâ€™s checks to Follin totaling \r\n  $52,000.Â  Follin put the cashierâ€™s checks in her safety deposit box at her bank.\r\nSumter High School Principal \r\n  Kay Raffield and District 17 attorney Bruce Davis went to Follinâ€™s business \r\n  to discuss various invoices amounting to nearly $70,000 for school trips in \r\n  1997 that were never taken.Â  Follin admitted District 17 had a $70,000 \r\n  credit.Â  She told Raffield and Davis that whenever a trip was paid for but later \r\n  canceled, Klein would inform her to keep the money as a credit towards future \r\n  District 17 travel.Â  Follin agreed to give the money back to District 17 but \r\n  informed Davis that she did not have access to it at the moment because it was \r\n  in a separate account.Â  After the meeting, Follin retrieved the cashierâ€™s checks \r\n  from her safety deposit box and deposited them into her business account.Â  District \r\n  17 did have a legitimate credit owed to them from Follin Travel.Â  However, the \r\n  cashierâ€™s checks and the genuine credit did not amount to the $70,000 owed to \r\n  the district.Â  Thus, Follin transferred $17,000 from her grandmotherâ€™s IRA account \r\n  to her business account.Â  She then wrote District 17 a â€œrefundâ€ check of $70,389.10. \r\n\r\nAfter further investigation, \r\n  Klein, Follin, and other individuals connected to the scheme were indicted by \r\n  the State Grand Jury.Â  Klein and most of the other individuals charged in the \r\n  scheme pled guilty to the charges.Â  Follin proceeded to trial.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\nFollin argues the State \r\n  Grand Jury [1]  was \r\n  without power to issue the indictments against her because the investigation \r\n  lasted longer than two years and was transferred from one State Grand Jury to \r\n  two subsequent State Grand Juries in violation of the statute.Â  Thus, she asserts, \r\n  the indictments were invalid and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe extensive investigation \r\n  by the State Grand Jury into this matter began in 1997 and numerous people were \r\n  ultimately indicted for defrauding District 17.Â  The investigation against Follin \r\n  was before several different panels of the State Grand Jury.Â  The 1998 State \r\n  Grand Jury heard evidence in the case, but was discharged in 1999 before issuing \r\n  an indictment.Â  On October 13, 1999, Follin was initially indicted for criminal \r\n  conspiracy by the 1999 State Grand Jury.Â  The State Grand Jury issued a first \r\n  superseding indictment on January 11, 2000, charging Follin with criminal conspiracy; \r\n  larceny by trick; embezzlement; obtaining goods and services by false pretenses; \r\n  receiving stolen goods; and obstruction of justice.\r\nFollin, along with two co-defendants, \r\n  moved to quash the indictment.Â  She argued the General Assembly intended a particular \r\n  State Grand Jury to investigate allegations of criminal conduct for up to two \r\n  years before it must be discharged.Â  Follin maintained the legislature did not \r\n  intend for an investigation to be transferred from one grand jury to a successive \r\n  grand jury if the initial panel could not issue an indictment upon an investigation.Â  \r\n  She complained the grand jury that heard her testimony on May 5, 1998, did not \r\n  issue an indictment, and the subsequent grand jury which issued indictments \r\n  in October 1999 and January 2000 did not hear her testimony.Â  The trial court \r\n  denied the motion to quash.\r\nFollin contends the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to find that the statute governing the State Grand Jury \r\n  does not allow a subsequent grand jury to issue an indictment if the original \r\n  grand jury failed to issue one at the expiration of its term.Â  \r\nAlthough there have not \r\n  been any recent cases discussing the rules regarding the transfer of investigations \r\n  to a subsequent county grand jury, the common law allows such transfers.Â  In \r\n  Fitch v. State, 11 S.C.L. (2 Nott &amp; McC.) 558 (Ct. App. 1820), the \r\n  defendant appealed the referral of the investigation against him to a new grand \r\n  jury after the initial grand jury returned a â€œno bill.â€Â  The Court noted:\r\n\r\nAs a legal principle, there can be no doubt but \r\n  that a prosecutor may prefer a new bill where a grand jury has returned â€œno \r\n  bill.â€Â  4 Black. 305, is in point, and I have known no time when this practice \r\n  in our courts has not prevailed.Â  Blackstone says, that where the bill is returned, \r\n  â€œnot found,â€ the party is discharged without farther [sic] answer.Â  But a fresh \r\n  bill may afterwards be preferred to a subsequent grand jury.Â  There is no inconsistency \r\n  in those sentences.Â  He may be discharged from farther [sic] answer; but from \r\n  what?Â  The meaning is evident, from the bill which has been thus returned, not \r\n  from the charge for which he was recognized to appear; on this, if essential \r\n  to public justice, a fresh bill may be given out.Â  The proofs may have been \r\n  defective on the first bill, and this deficiency may be supplied on the preferment \r\n  of another.Â  It is the verdict of a petty jury alone, which can operate as a \r\n  discharge of the defendant from the accusation against him.Â  If, on trial, they \r\n  find the party not guilty, he is then, says Blackstone, forever quit and discharged \r\n  of the accusation.Â  The implication is clear, that before then he is not so \r\n  discharged.Â  It is not to be supposed that the solicitor, in the exercise of \r\n  a discretion with which he is invested, would use it in an arbitrary or oppressive \r\n  manner, nor would it be consistent with justice, that an offender should be \r\n  permitted to withdraw himself from an accusation where, in the opinion of the \r\n  solicitor, his guilt might be made to appear more fully before another grand \r\n  jury.Â  \r\n\r\nFitch, 11 S.C.L. at 559.Â  \r\nWe must determine whether \r\n  the legislature intended to abrogate this common law rule in enacting the State \r\n  Grand Jury statute.Â  To that end, we must ascertain the intent of the legislature \r\n  and give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning.Â  State \r\n  v. Johnson, 343 S.C. 693, 541 S.E.2d 855 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œWhat a legislature \r\n  says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative \r\n  intent or will.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, \r\n  581 (2000)(citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe General Assembly created \r\n  the State Grand Jury to detect and investigate multi-county crimes involving \r\n  narcotics, dangerous drugs, controlled substances, obscenity, and crimes involving \r\n  public corruption and election laws.Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-7-1610 (Supp. 2001); \r\n  State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 291, 433 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1993) (â€œThe \r\n  State Grand Jury was created to improve the Stateâ€™s ability to â€˜detect and eliminateâ€™ \r\n  multi-county criminal activity . . . . To this end, the Grand Jury has statewide \r\n  authority but its jurisdiction is limited to certain offenses.â€) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  After the impaneling judge considers the Attorney Generalâ€™s petition and orders \r\n  the impanelment, a State Grand Jury is impaneled for a term of twelve months.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1630(B)-(C) (Supp. 2001).Â  Upon petition by the Attorney \r\n  General, the chief administrative judge of the circuit in which the State Grand \r\n  Jury was impaneled may order the term of that Grand Jury extended for a six \r\n  month period.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1630(C) (Supp. 2001).Â  However, the total \r\n  term of a particular State Grand Jury, including extensions, shall not exceed \r\n  two years.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe proceedings of the State \r\n  Grand Jury are secret and a witnessâ€™s testimony may not be disclosed by anyone \r\n  except where directed by a court for the purpose of:\r\n\r\n(1) ascertaining whether it is consistent with the testimony \r\n  given by the witness before the court in any subsequent proceeding;\r\n(2) determining whether the witness is guilty of perjury;\r\n(3) assisting local, state, other state or federal law \r\n  enforcement or investigating agencies, including another grand jury, \r\n  in investigating crimes under their investigative jurisdiction;\r\n(4) providing the defendant the material to which he \r\n  is entitled pursuant to Section 14-7-1700;\r\n(5) complying with constitutional, statutory, or other legal \r\n  requirements or to further justice.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720(A)(1)-(5) (Supp. 2001) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe statute does not specify \r\n  that a matter may be referred to subsequent grand juries for investigation.Â  \r\n  Unequivocably, the legislature intended to allow such referrals.Â  Although the \r\n  legislature limited the time period for which a single State Grand Jury may \r\n  investigate a particular matter to two years, nothing in the statute purports \r\n  to forbid a subsequent referral to another State Grand Jury or to limit the \r\n  number of grand juries which may investigate a matter.Â  The legislature granted \r\n  prosecutors the authority to disclose matters before one State Grand Jury to \r\n  a subsequent State Grand Jury to assist in the investigation.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720(A)(3) (Supp. 2001).Â  This authority to disclose the \r\n  secret information presented to one State Grand Jury to a subsequent State Grand \r\n  Jury evidences the legislatureâ€™s intent to allow the continuation of the common \r\n  law practice of referring matters to subsequent grand juries when one fails \r\n  to return an indictment at the end of its term.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurther credence is given \r\n  to this view by referring to the federal rule regarding grand juries.Â  Federal \r\n  Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) is very similar to our statute regarding disclosure \r\n  of secret information to subsequent grand juries.Â  It provides that disclosure \r\n  of the grand jury proceedings otherwise prohibited by the rules may be made \r\n  â€œwhen the disclosure is made by an attorney for the government to another Federal \r\n  grand jury.â€Â  Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(C)(III).Â  Where one federal grand jury \r\n  returns a â€œno bill,â€ prosecutors may submit the investigation to a subsequent \r\n  grand jury after obtaining government approval.Â  24 James Wm. Moore et \r\n  al., Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â§ 606.01[2][b][iv] (3d ed. 2002).\r\nâ€œAt one time, it was regarded \r\n  as potentially abusive for the prosecutor to submit a case to a second grand \r\n  jury when a first refused to indict.â€Â  Id. Â§ 606.06[4][c].Â  â€œHowever, \r\n  it is now regarded as acceptable practice.Â  Presentation of an investigation \r\n  to a second grand jury occurs most frequently when the first grand juryâ€™s \r\n  term has expired prior to completion of the investigation.â€Â  \r\n  Id. (emphasis added). \r\nThis position has been followed \r\n  by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Â  See United \r\n  States v. Penrod, 609 F.2d 1092 (4th Cir. 1979) (matter was referred to \r\n  a second grand jury where first grand jury failed to indict); see also \r\n  United States v. Thompson, 251 U.S. 407, 413, 40 S.Ct. 289, 292, 64 L.Ed. \r\n  333, 342 (1920) (â€œ[T]he power and duty of the grand jury . . . is continuous \r\n  and is therefore not exhausted or limited by adverse action taken by a grand \r\n  jury or by its failure to act, and hence may thereafter be exerted as to the \r\n  same instances by the same or a subsequent grand jury.â€).\r\nOther jurisdictions allow \r\n  referral to subsequent grand juries, although some impose a statutory limit \r\n  to the number of times a charge can be referred to a grand jury or require prosecutors \r\n  to seek court approval prior to resubmitting the matter to the grand jury.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., United States v. Contenti, 735 F.2d 628 (1st \r\n  Cir. 1984) (holding it is acceptable to transfer an investigation to a subsequent \r\n  grand jury where the original grand jury did not complete the investigation \r\n  before the term ended); United States v. Shane, 584 F. Supp. 364 (E.D.Pa. \r\n  1984) (ruling transfer of investigation, without a court order, from one grand \r\n  jury to another in the course of continuing in the same investigation did not \r\n  warrant dismissal of the indictment); Ephamka v. Alaska, 878 P.2d 647 \r\n  (Alaska Ct. App. 1994 ) (stating prosecutor must seek court permission to resubmit \r\n  a charge to a grand jury where the first grand jury failed to issue an indictment); \r\n  New Mexico v. Isaac M., 34 P.3d 624, 627 (N.M. Ct.

Gelman, \r\n  712 N.E.2d 686 (N.Y. 1999) (holding statute was enacted to prevent abuse resulting \r\n  from common law rule that prosecutor could repeatedly resubmit a charge to successive \r\n  grand juries; it provided that a charge may only be resubmitted to a subsequent \r\n  grand jury once).\r\nIndubitably, the statute \r\n  does not limit the number of times the State may submit a matter for investigation \r\n  to the State Grand Jury.Â  In contrariety, there is clear indication the legislature \r\n  intended the State to have the ability to resubmit a matter to a subsequent \r\n  grand jury, especially in cases such as this where the investigation is very \r\n  complex.Â  This interpretation comports with the verbiage of the statute, the \r\n  common law, and federal law.Â  Although Follin argues the legislature intended \r\n  the two year term to mean that one State Grand Jury could not be dismissed until \r\n  it had served an entire two years, we disagree.Â  We do not read the statute \r\n  that narrowly and reject this contention.\r\nWe hold the State Grand \r\n  Jury has subject matter jurisdiction to issue indictments \r\n  in factual scenarios involving:\r\n\r\n (1) Â Â Â  anÂ  investigation lasting \r\n  longer than two years; or\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  an investigation transferred from one \r\n  State Grand Jury to a subsequent State Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nII.Â  SENTENCING\r\nFollin maintains the trial \r\n  court erroneously considered her exercise of the right to a jury trial by sentencing \r\n  her more severely than the co-defendants who pled guilty.Â  We disagree.\r\nKlein pled guilty to several \r\n  charges and was sentenced to a total of ten years imprisonment.Â  Other individuals \r\n  were indicted for their involvement with Kleinâ€™s scheme.Â  Benji Adams helped \r\n  Klein create fraudulent corporations that provided no services to District 17, \r\n  and Klein directed $1.5 million in District 17 funds to the corporations.Â  Adams \r\n  pled guilty to embezzlement as a principal in the second degree, principal in \r\n  the first degree, and accessory before the fact of embezzlement.Â  Adams received \r\n  a sentence of ten years imprisonment, suspended on the service of three years \r\n  and five years probation and restitution.\r\nJames A. Perry pled guilty \r\n  to receiving stolen goods and conspiracy to commit embezzlement.Â  He received \r\n  a sentence of seven years imprisonment, suspended with five years probation \r\n  and an obligation to pay $100,000 in restitution on the stolen goods charge.Â  \r\n  Perry was sentenced to five years, suspended with five years probation, on the \r\n  conspiracy to commit embezzlement charge.\r\nGeorge Kurzenberger pled \r\n  guilty to receiving stolen goods and was sentenced to three years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended with five years probation, and restitution in the amount of $2,700.\r\nGeorge E. â€œEddieâ€ Myers \r\n  pled guilty to official misconduct in office and was sentenced to five years \r\n  imprisonment, suspended with five years probation and payment of $15,000 in \r\n  restitution.\r\nTroy Phillips pled guilty \r\n  to official misconduct in office.Â  He was sentenced to five years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended with five years probation and payment of $18,000 in restitution.\r\nSamuel G. Lovell, III, pled \r\n  guilty to criminal conspiracy to commit official misconduct.Â  He received a \r\n  sentence of three years imprisonment, suspended with five years probation, and \r\n  payment of $40,000 in restitution.\r\nMark J. Clifford pled guilty \r\n  to receiving stolen goods and was sentenced to five years imprisonment suspended \r\n  with five years probation and payment of $30,000 in restitution.\r\nEdward Thomas Lewis pled \r\n  guilty to criminal conspiracy, common law official misconduct in office, and \r\n  receiving stolen goods.Â  He received three years imprisonment suspended with \r\n  five years probation on the criminal conspiracy charge.Â  Lewis was sentenced \r\n  to ten years imprisonment on the official misconduct charge, suspended upon \r\n  the service of ninety days with five years probation, plus restitution of $45,000.Â  \r\n  Lewis was sentenced to three years imprisonment suspended on five years probation \r\n  for receiving stolen goods.Â  The sentences ran concurrently.\r\nJohnny M. Martin was charged \r\n  with receiving stolen goods, common law official misconduct in office, and criminal \r\n  conspiracy.Â  He was found guilty of all three offenses after a jury trial.Â  \r\n  He was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years, suspended upon the service \r\n  of one year with five years probation and payment of $50,000 in restitution; \r\n  ten years imprisonment, suspended upon five years probation; and five years, \r\n  suspended upon five years probation, respectively.\r\nJames Michael Hicks pled \r\n  guilty to official misconduct in office and receiving stolen goods.Â  He was \r\n  sentenced to concurrent terms of five years imprisonment, suspended upon five \r\n  years probation and payment of $32,000 in restitution, and five years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended upon five years probation, respectively.\r\nEllison Lawson, Jr., pled \r\n  guilty to criminal conspiracy, common law official misconduct in office, and \r\n  receiving stolen goods.Â  He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended \r\n  with one year probation on the criminal conspiracy charge.Â  Lawson received \r\n  a concurrent sentence of two years imprisonment, suspended upon one year probation, \r\n  on the official misconduct in office charge.Â  He received a concurrent sentence \r\n  of five years imprisonment, suspended with one year probation, on the charge \r\n  of receiving stolen goods.\r\nPhilip K. Davis, the former \r\n  accountant for District 17, was charged with criminal conspiracy; two counts \r\n  of breach of trust with fraudulent intent; receiving stolen goods amounting \r\n  to $48,000; receiving stolen goods amounting to $37,784; receiving stolen goods \r\n  amounting to $45,635; and receiving stolen goods amounting to $34,166.Â  Davis \r\n  pled guilty to all the charges and was sentenced to five years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended to five years probation, on the criminal conspiracy charge.Â  He was \r\n  sentenced to two concurrent terms of seven years, suspended upon the service \r\n  of three years with five years probation and restitution on the breach of trust \r\n  charges.Â  Davis was sentenced to four concurrent terms of seven years, suspended \r\n  with five years probation on the four charges of receiving stolen goods.\r\nIn sentencing Follin, the \r\n  trial judge noted she had been an asset to the community, and stated:\r\n\r\nBut none of those things in any way \r\n  suggests to me that I should give you a straight probationary sentence because \r\n  I canâ€™t, because there is no way in this world that I can view you in the same \r\n  light that I view the persons that have been involved in the school.Â  There \r\n  were other forces at play on that.Â  \r\nI know that plenty of people in the \r\n  community donâ€™t agree with that and I respect their right to think that.Â  Thatâ€™s \r\n  fine.Â  But in this case, you are not at that level.Â  You are â€“ I agree you are \r\n  not where Joe Klein is and you probably are not where Benji Adams was. \r\nBut as I mentioned in sentencing Johnny \r\n  Martin and I have said throughout and I will continue to say I canâ€™t ignore \r\n  Benji Adams admitting his guilt, and I am not punishing you and will not punish \r\n  you for your jury trial in no way, shape or form, but I donâ€™t have an admission \r\n  of guilt nor do I want one.\r\nIâ€™m not asking you for one.Â  Iâ€™m not \r\n  asking for â€“ just simply saying thatâ€™s not a factor for me to consider.Â  I will \r\n  consider your cooperation.Â  I think you were very very instrumental in helping \r\n  pull this together.\r\n\r\nFollin received a sentence of three years on her \r\n  conviction for criminal conspiracy.Â  She was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended upon the service of four years with five years probation and payment \r\n  of $20,000 in restitution for her conviction of aiding and abetting embezzlement.Â  \r\n  Finally, Follin was sentenced to three years for her conviction of obtaining \r\n  property by false pretenses.Â  All sentences ran concurrently.\r\nFollin filed a post-trial \r\n  motion for reconsideration of her sentence.Â  She claimed her sentence was disproportionate \r\n  to the sentences received by others involved in the scandal.Â  Further, Follin \r\n  asserted that the trial judge, in imposing the sentences, improperly considered \r\n  Follinâ€™s exercise of her right to a jury trial in violation of Davis v. State, \r\n  336 S.C. 329, 520 S.E.2d 801 (1999).\r\nThe trial judge addressed \r\n  the argument regarding the improper consideration of the defendantâ€™s failure \r\n  to plead guilty at Johnny Martinâ€™s sentencing. [2] Â  The judge referenced his reasoning \r\n  given in the Martin hearing and the following exchange took place:\r\n\r\nThe Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thereâ€™s no need for me to restate that here.Â  As I stated \r\n  then in basically summary fashion Iâ€™ll say, I do not, will never, and pray I \r\n  never, I should say that, I hope I never â€“ if I do I hope Iâ€™m reversed immediately, \r\n  I should be â€“ penalize a person for exercising something that I consider very \r\n  dearly and that is those rights that are given to us as citizens of this country \r\n  in the constitution and that to me is her right.\r\nAnd I would not penalize her for that \r\n  and nor have I done so.\r\nAs I stated and he â€“ no question the \r\n  court alludes to this same language in the Davis case.Â  As I stated, \r\n  and I incorporate the Martin [sic], I asked the court again, if I â€“ if I as \r\n  a trial judge in sentencing and fashioning a sentence am I not at liberty to \r\n  consider in mitigation and in trying to mitigate the sentence the fact that \r\n  a person admits their guilt and give some consideration for that, then tell \r\n  me so.\r\nTell me I canâ€™t do that and Iâ€™ll stop.Â  \r\n  Iâ€™ll stop.\r\nBut as a trial lawyer and as a trial \r\n  judge, I know as a trial lawyer for 21 years, that was the first thing.Â  Judge, \r\n  my client is standing before you admitting their guilt. That should â€“ you should \r\n  consider that and I ask for your mercy because they are admitting their guilt.Â  \r\n  They are admitting they are wrong.Â  \r\nI donâ€™t fault Ms. Follin for that.Â  \r\n  She chose to â€“ and she made the statement and I donâ€™t fault the statement she \r\n  made before sentencing because I believe her.Â  I donâ€™t think she was telling \r\n  an untruth.Â  This is truly how she felt.Â  And I understand that.Â  I really do.\r\nBut my â€“ what I had was a person a \r\n  jury had convicted.Â  I didnâ€™t have that factor to consider.Â  I considered, as \r\n  Iâ€™ve already stated, the limit or the extent of her participation in it in trying \r\n  to fashion a sentence which I thought was just for both sides and just and proper.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  And I didnâ€™t think it was â€“ I frankly \r\n  think it was fair and it had nothing to do with her â€“ her exercising her jury \r\n  right.\r\n\r\nYou have that position in this record \r\n  and you have what is here before us and weâ€™ll see if need be what they â€“ what \r\n  they â€“ persons who review this will say.\r\nBut I wish to state again, I did not \r\n  consider that and penalize her for â€“ for not pleading guilty or exercising her \r\n  right to a jury trial.Â  \r\nMr. Weinberg:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Your Honor, just point of information, so I understand \r\n  the courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nThe Court stated in Davis or \r\n  the trial judge stated in Davis, Iâ€™m quoting from the record, they admitted \r\n  what they had done to me and thatâ€™s the first step toward rehabilitation.\r\nIn other words, he was admitting â€“ \r\n  he was stating that they had admitted that â€“ they stood before him and said \r\n  what they did wrong.Â  If thatâ€™s what youâ€™re saying, if I canâ€™t do that anymore, \r\n  tell me, is that â€“\r\nThe Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâ€™m just saying to you that if that is volitive \r\n  [sic] of Davis, if that is what the Court is saying, then we can never \r\n  â€“ and I asked [Martinâ€™s attorney], and I would ask you, in giving a guilty plea, \r\n  do you expect the court to give credit or give some consideration for the fact \r\n  that a person is admitting their guilt?\r\nMr. Weinberg:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Judge, I think probably â€“ probably pre-Davis \r\n  we all did.Â  But I think now â€“\r\nThe Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  So you think now that thereâ€™s no need to state \r\n  that before me now that I should consider the fact that a person is pleading \r\n  guilty?\r\nMr. Weinberg:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Whether you should or not, Judge, I donâ€™t know.Â  \r\n  I think the Supreme Court has said you canâ€™t.\r\nThe Court:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  I appreciate that and weâ€™ll find \r\n  out.Â  But I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s what they are saying.Â  I think that in that case \r\n  youâ€™re talking that language, and it was just like â€“ it was just like I told \r\n  [Martinâ€™s attorney] â€“ when youâ€™re trying to argue it for Mr. [sic] Follinâ€™s \r\n  back (sic) itâ€™s much easier â€“ itâ€™s more difficult to explain than it is going \r\n  the other way.\r\nBecause when you sit there and ask \r\n  for some consideration I donâ€™t think the court has ever said that sentence ought \r\n  to be overturned because you considered the fact that they pled guilty and you \r\n  gave a sentence in giving consideration for admission of the guilt.Â  Thatâ€™s \r\n  not there. \r\nThis case there was indication and \r\n  suggestion and there are other facts of that case that will suggest possibly, \r\n  not just that language, that that judge may have in that situation imposed a \r\n  stiffer sentence.Â  And I wasnâ€™t there.Â  Donâ€™t know.Â  I just know what the Supreme \r\n  Court said he did.Â  But thank you very much.Â  \r\nYour motion is noted and the Davis \r\n  case is clearly there.Â  I hope we framed it properly for review should that \r\n  become necessary.Â  \r\n\r\nIn recent years, our state \r\n  appellate courts have addressed the problem of trial judges improperly considering \r\n  the defendantâ€™s failure to plead guilty in imposing sentence.Â  In State v. \r\n  Hazel, 317 S.C. 368, 453 S.E.2d 879 (1995), the defendant was convicted \r\n  of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.Â  During the sentencing \r\n  proceeding, the defendant requested a sentence under the Youthful Offender Act, \r\n  and the trial judge noted:\r\n\r\nWell, itâ€™s one thing if heâ€™d pled guilty, Iâ€™d have considered \r\n  that, but taking into consideration the age and where he was and the time it \r\n  was, the sentence of the court is you be confined to the State Board of Corrections \r\n  for a period of fifteen years and pay a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nId. at 369, 453 S.E.2d at 879.\r\nOur Supreme Court reversed \r\n  the defendantâ€™s sentence, finding the trial judge improperly considered the \r\n  defendantâ€™s exercise of his right to a jury trial.Â  The Court recognized â€œâ€˜[c]ourts \r\n  have long adhered to the principle forbidding a trial court from improperly \r\n  considering the defendantâ€™s exercise of his constitutional right to a jury trial \r\n  as an influential factor in determining the appropriate sentence.â€™â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 370, 453 S.E.2d at 880 (citations omitted).Â Â Â  \r\nIn Davis v. State, \r\n  336 S.C. 329, 520 S.E.2d 801 (1999), the defendant was convicted by a jury and \r\n  later moved to have his sentence reduced.Â  In denying the defendantâ€™s motion, \r\n  the trial judge explained as follows:\r\n\r\nYes, Maâ€™am, but he didnâ€™t plead guilty.Â  Those other two \r\n  people, they pled guilty.Â  They admitted what they had done and to me thatâ€™s \r\n  the first step towards rehabilitation is admitting that you did something wrong \r\n  and youâ€™re pleading guilty and when a fellow wants a trial which heâ€™s entitled \r\n  to as a matter of law â€“ and thatâ€™s fine.\r\n\r\nId. at 332, 520 S.E.2d at 802.\r\nDavis moved for post-conviction \r\n  relief based in part on trial counselâ€™s failure to object when the trial judge \r\n  considered Davisâ€™s exercise of his right to a jury trial in sentencing.Â  The \r\n  Court held that Davis was entitled to relief because his trial attorney failed \r\n  to object to the consideration placed upon his exercise of his constitutional \r\n  right to a jury trial.\r\nThe issue has been addressed \r\n  recently by this Court in State v. Brouwer, 346 S.C. 375, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  915 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Brouwer and a co-defendant were employees of an adult \r\n  video store.Â  Both were charged with disseminating obscene materials.Â  Brouwer \r\n  was convicted.Â  Pursuant to Davis, Brouwer asked the trial judge [3]  to impose a probationary \r\n  sentence similar to that imposed on his co-defendant who previously pled guilty \r\n  to the same charge. [4] Â  In denying the request \r\n  and sentencing Brouwer to four years imprisonment, suspended upon the service \r\n  of six months, and three years probation, the trial judge stated as follows:\r\n[L]et me respond to your reference to the Davis \r\n  case . . . . And you are talking about where the trial judge made a reference \r\n  to the fact that because he exercised his right to a jury trial, now he has \r\n  to impose a certain sentence.\r\nWhat I indicated to you in chambers \r\n  was simply what I indicate to anyone who is there.Â  The court wishes to say \r\n  that we are not going to have that involved, then let them do it and we will \r\n  put it on the record in this case, and I welcome the instruction, because I \r\n  see â€“ I distinguish that Davis case from what I said, because I never \r\n  said to you that if he exercises his right to a jury trial, I would punish him \r\n  more severely.Â  I said to you, as I recall, and I think I said, because I say \r\n  it just about every time I talk to someone, Iâ€™m a judge that gives serious consideration \r\n  for someone admitting their guilt. I think thatâ€™s important.Â  It was told to \r\n  me when I first started practicing law years ago by Judge Clarence Singletary, \r\n  who was the judge in my circuit, that I believe that thatâ€™s the first step towards \r\n  rehabilitation . . . .\r\n. . . [T]here is no way in rhyme or \r\n  reason for us to ever give a sentence for someone pleading guilty the same sentence \r\n  for a jury trial.Â  Then we have ignored the fact that a person has admitted \r\n  their guilt. \r\nNow, I donâ€™t think a person needs \r\n  to be punished because of their jury trial, because thatâ€™s a Constitutional \r\n  Right.Â  And I, as a trial judge, have never, nor will I ever, punish someone \r\n  for exercising their right to a jury trial.Â  I think that is something valuable.Â  \r\n  I take it very seriously . . . . But one of the factors that I will always consider, \r\n  . . . is consider someone who admits their guilt.\r\nId. at 396, 550 S.E.2d at 926-27 (Anderson, J., dissenting).\r\nDespite the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  comments that he would never punish someone for exercising his or her right \r\n  to a jury trial, the majority opinion found the trial judge expressly violated \r\n  Davis by improperly considering that fact during sentencing, â€œespecially \r\n  since the record fail[ed] to reflect an otherwise appropriate basis for \r\n  Brouwerâ€™s disparate sentence.â€Â  Id. at 388, 550 S.E.2d at 922 \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the case sub judice, \r\n  Follin was sentenced to a period of incarceration longer than any of the other \r\n  individuals charged in the case, with the exception of Klein.Â  At first glance, \r\n  it would appear that the trial judge violated the mandate found in Brouwer \r\n  by referencing the fact that other defendants pled guilty in the case.Â  However, \r\n  the instant case is clearly distinguishable from Brouwer.\r\nBrouwer and his co-defendant \r\n  were in the same posture: both were employees of an adult video store, both \r\n  were charged with the same crime, and both faced the same potential sentence.Â  \r\n  As emphasized by the majority opinion in Brouwer, nothing in the record \r\n  indicated an appropriate basis for the disparity in the sentences actually given.Â  \r\n  Id. at 388, 550 S.E.2d at 922.Â  \r\nBy contrast, there are very \r\n  few similarities between Follin and the other defendants in this case.Â  The \r\n  defendants were not in the same posture with each other because they were not \r\n  all employees of District 17, they were not all charged with identical crimes, \r\n  and they faced different sentences.Â Â Â  \r\nAdams was the single most \r\n  important individual in assisting Klein in his fake corporation scheme.Â  He \r\n  was charged with embezzlement in the first and second degree and accessory before \r\n  the fact and was sentenced to three years total incarceration.Â  Davis, the accountant \r\n  who assisted Klein in the fake travel scheme, pled guilty to criminal conspiracy, \r\n  breach of trust, and receiving stolen goods.Â  He was sentenced to a total of \r\n  three years imprisonment.Â  Aside from Davis, Follin was the most important individual \r\n  in assisting Klein with the fake travel scheme.Â  As Klein testified at Follinâ€™s \r\n  trial, without Follin, he could not have effectuated the travel scheme.Â  Although \r\n  Follin received a sentence of four years imprisonment, instead of the three \r\n  years Adams and Davis received, she was convicted of aiding and abetting embezzlement, \r\n  obtaining a signature or property by false pretenses, and criminal conspiracy.Â  \r\n  Her sentence was well within the sentencing range for her convictions. [5] \r\nIt is regrettable that the \r\n  trial judge in the present case commented on Adamsâ€™s guilty plea and the consideration \r\n  given to him for pleading guilty.Â  However, the trial judge repeatedly noted \r\n  that he was not considering Follinâ€™s exercise of her right to a jury trial in \r\n  rendering her sentence.Â  Further, Follinâ€™s charges and potential sentences were \r\n  vastly different so as to render comparison to any other co-defendant difficult.Â  \r\n  Thus, unlike Brouwer, the record before us clearly indicates that the \r\n  differences in the charges Follin faced led to the disparity in her sentence, \r\n  not her decision to proceed with a trial.\r\nWe rule a sentencing judge \r\n  may NOT improperly consider a defendantâ€™s decision to proceed with a \r\n  jury trial.Â  We conclude that, when the record clearly reflects an appropriate \r\n  basis for a disparate sentence, the sentencing judge may impose a different \r\n  sentence on a co-defendant in a criminal trial.Â  We caution the Bench that a \r\n  trial judge abuses his or her discretion in sentencing when the judge considers \r\n  the fact that the defendant exercised the right to a jury trial.\r\nIII.Â  JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING \r\n  THE VERDICT (JNOV)\r\nAfter her conviction, Follin \r\n  moved for JNOV.Â  She alleged the trial court erred by failing to grant her motion \r\n  for directed verdict as to all of the charges.Â  The trial judge denied the motions.Â  \r\n  Follin argues on appeal that the trial court erred in denying her motion for \r\n  JNOV.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nJNOV is a post-trial motion \r\n  challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment.Â  See \r\n  generally, Rule 50 (b), SCRCP.Â  A motion for JNOV is a civil trial motion, \r\n  and thus it is improper for a party to move for JNOV in a criminal trial.Â  State \r\n  v. Miller, 287 S.C. 280, 337 S.E.2d 883 (1985); State v. Dasher, \r\n  278Â  S.C. 395, 297 S.E.2d 414 (1982) (it was error of law for judge to direct \r\n  verdict of not guilty in criminal case after jury had returned guilty verdict); \r\n  State v. Taylor, 348 S.C. 152, 158, 558 S.E.2d 917, 919 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (cert. granted May 30, 2002) (ruling â€œa motion for a JNOV in a criminal \r\n  case is not recognized in this state.â€).\r\nIn criminal matters, a motion \r\n  for a new trial is the â€œonly available post-trial motion addressing the sufficiency \r\n  of the evidence.â€Â  Miller, 287 S.C. at 282 n.2, 337 S.E.2d at 884 n.2 \r\n  (citing State v. Dawkins, 32 S.C. 17, 10 S.E. 772 (1890)); see \r\n  also State v. Scurry, 322 S.C. 514, 518, 473 S.E.2d 61, 63 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (â€œ[I]n a criminal case, a motion for a new trial is the only available \r\n  post-trial motion addressing the sufficiency of the evidence.â€).Â  â€œThere is \r\n  no precedent that â€˜gives the trial court authority to change its mind after \r\n  a guilty verdict has been returned and thereafter, on its own motion, grant \r\n  a directed verdict of innocence as to the same charge.â€™â€ Taylor, 348 \r\n  S.C. at 158, 558 S.E.2d at 920 (citation omitted).\r\nBecause a motion for JNOV \r\n  is not recognized as a valid post-trial motion in criminal cases, Follin was \r\n  not entitled to JNOV.\r\nIV.Â  MOTION \r\n  IN ARREST OF JUDGMENT\r\nIn post-trial motions, Follin \r\n  made a motion in arrest of judgment as to her charges.Â  In support of this motion, \r\n  Follin first asserted the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict as \r\n  to the charge of aiding and abetting the embezzlement because there was no evidence \r\n  that she was a principal in the embezzlement and she was not indicted as an \r\n  accessory after the fact.Â  Follin further contended there was insufficient evidence \r\n  to support the charge of conspiracy, and there was no evidence of intent to \r\n  defraud in order to support the charge of obtaining goods and services by false \r\n  pretenses.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA â€˜motion for arrest of \r\n  judgmentâ€™ is a postverdict motion made to prevent the entry of a judgment where \r\n  the charging document is insufficient or the court lacked jurisdiction to try \r\n  the matter.â€ Â State v. Taylor, 348 S.C. 152, 160, 558 S.E.2d 917, 920-21 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (cert. granted May 30, 2002).Â  A defendant may \r\n  make a motion for arrest of judgment alleging an insufficiency of the indictment.Â  \r\n  Id.; see also State v. Brown, 201 S.C. 417, 23 S.E.2d \r\n  381 (1942) (holding motion for arrest of judgment should have been granted where \r\n  trial court did not have jurisdiction to impose the sentence); State v. Jeter, \r\n  47 S.C. 2, 24 S.E. 889 (1896) (concluding it was error for trial court to deny \r\n  motion for arrest of judgment where indictment was insufficient).Â  However, \r\n  the defendant may not move for a verdict in arrest of judgment based on the \r\n  insufficiency of the evidence to support the charges in the indictment.Â  Taylor, \r\n  348 S.C. at 160, 558 S.E.2d at 921; see also State v. Miller, \r\n  287 S.C. 280, 286, 337 S.E.2d 883, 886-87 (1985) (Ness, J., concurring in part \r\n  and dissenting in part) (stating a defendant â€œmay not move for \r\n  verdict in arrest of judgment based on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain \r\n  the allegations in the indictment.â€) (emphasis in original)(citation omitted).Â  \r\n  â€œ[W]hen ruling on a motion in arrest of judgment, the trial court is limited \r\n  to rectifying trial errors, and cannot make a redetermination of the credibility \r\n  and weight of the evidence.â€Â  21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law Â§ 785 (1998); \r\n  see also Taylor, 348 S.C. at 160, 558 S.E.2d at 921.Â  \r\nHere, Follin maintains the \r\n  trial court should have granted her motion in arrest of judgment because there \r\n  was no evidence to support her charges.Â  Because she is not entitled to an arrest \r\n  of judgment based on the sufficiency of the evidence, we find no error with \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s denial of her motion.Â  \r\nV.Â  \r\n  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nFollin claims the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to grant her motions for directed verdict and new trial \r\n  regarding the charges of criminal conspiracy, aiding and abetting the embezzlement, \r\n  and obtaining goods and services by false pretenses.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal from the denial \r\n  of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  254 (2001); State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999); State \r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).Â  When ruling on a motion for \r\n  a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight.Â  State v. Spann, 279 S.C. 399, 308 S.E.2d 518 (1983); \r\n  State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 473 S.E.2d 831 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œIf \r\n  there is any direct or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending \r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was \r\n  properly submitted to the jury.â€Â  Lollis, 343 S.C. at 584, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  at 256.Â  Conversely, a trial court should grant a motion for a directed verdict \r\n  when the evidence merely raises a suspicion the accused is guilty.Â  Id.\r\nA.Â  Criminal Conspiracy\r\nFollin alleges there was \r\n  no evidence to support the charge of criminal conspiracy because there was no \r\n  evidence that she knowingly entered into an agreement with Klein to defraud \r\n  District 17 of $1.4 million.Â  We disagree.\r\nKlein testified that the \r\n  invoices for legitimate District 17 travel were handled differently from the \r\n  â€œspecialâ€ travel invoices that were used to pay for his junket travel.Â  According \r\n  to Klein, the invoices for the legitimate travel came through the mail, and \r\n  the clean copies of the illegitimate travel invoices, which were â€œautomaticallyâ€ \r\n  voided by Follin, were always hand-delivered.Â  Although the District 17 checks \r\n  used to pay Follin for legitimate travel expenses were sometimes mailed and \r\n  sometimes hand-delivered, the checks issued on the bogus travel invoices, which \r\n  were credited to Kleinâ€™s junket travel invoices, were always hand-delivered.Â  \r\n  He estimated that, from 1989 to 1994, approximately 60% of the money paid by \r\n  District 17 to Follin covered his junket travel expenses.\r\nKlein declared that Follin \r\n  helped him by booking luxury travel for his family and friends.Â  Although some \r\n  of the individuals traveling worked for District 17, Klein stated that some \r\n  of the individuals were from California, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, and Greenville.Â  \r\n  Klein usually took luxury trips, eventually paid for by District 17, for New \r\n  Yearâ€™s, Mardi Gras, and the Fourth of July.Â  Follin booked a Royal Caribbean \r\n  cruise for Klein, his girlfriend, and four other individuals, which was paid \r\n  for by District 17.Â  Trips booked through Follin Travel included a Colorado \r\n  ski trip for a group of people, a trip to Atlantic City, and a gambling â€œcruise \r\n  to nowhere.â€ Â Follin accompanied the group to the Colorado ski trip and on the \r\n  gambling â€œcruise to nowhere.â€Â  At the direction of Klein, Follin mailed the \r\n  tickets to the out of town individuals, although Klein testified that on some \r\n  occasions he told Follin those individuals were reimbursing District 17.Â  Klein \r\n  professed that he would not have been able to succeed in the travel scheme without\r\nFollin.\r\nKlein stated that when \r\n  he realized District 17 was investigating him in 1997, he contacted Follin and \r\n  warned her that she was going to be asked about the â€œspecial invoicesâ€ for trips \r\n  which were never taken, but were paid for by the district.Â  At Kleinâ€™s request, \r\n  Follin created false invoices indicating that the â€œspecial invoiceâ€ trips were \r\n  never taken and that District 17 was owed a credit for that payment.Â  She then \r\n  accepted $52,700 in cashierâ€™s checks from Klein to make it appear that District \r\n  17 had a credit. \r\nKlein was asked whether \r\n  there was an explicit agreement between himself and Follin to defraud District\r\n17:&nbsp; \r\n\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did you \r\n  have an agreement with Dale Follin concerning the travel scheme?

If the client cancels the trip by the Friday \r\n  of that same week, the ticket and invoice are voided, ARC never drafts the cost \r\n  of the ticket from the agency, and the record does not appear in the accounting \r\n  system.Â  If the client cancels after Friday, the ARC will still draft the cost \r\n  of the trip from the agency and the agency must later obtain a refund.Â  Follin \r\n  declared that, before 1996, travel agents made a commission of 10% on airline \r\n  tickets, but the commission was capped at $50 for a roundtrip ticket and $25 \r\n  for a one-way ticket after 1997.\r\nFollin professed that she \r\n  was almost always the travel agent from Follin Travel who handled District 17 \r\n  travel arrangements with Klein.Â  She set up four accounts related to District \r\n  17 travel and Klein: (1) Account number 2099 for District 17â€™s â€œLeisure/Incentive \r\n  Travelâ€; (2) Account number 2022 for general District 17 travel; (3) Account \r\n  number 214 for District 17 school group travel; and (4) Account number 209 for \r\n  Kleinâ€™s personal travel.Â  Follin admitted that all four accounts were \r\n  funded by payments from District 17. District 17 accounted for between 8% and \r\n  15% of Follin Travelâ€™s total business from 1989 to 1997. \r\nFollin believed the Leisure/Incentive \r\n  travel account covered leisure trips organized by District 17 as incentives.Â  \r\n  Klein told her the District 17 employees would reimburse the district for the \r\n  cost of the trip through payroll deductions.Â  Follin stated she believed that \r\n  the individuals traveling on all of the leisure trips paid for by District 17, \r\n  including the skiing trip to Colorado and both cruises, were reimbursing the \r\n  district.Â  Follin went on the skiing trip and the â€œcruise to nowhereâ€ as an \r\n  escort, but her expenses were complimentary to her as a travel agent and nothing \r\n  was billed to District 17, other than the costs of things not complimentary.\r\nFollin denied knowing anything \r\n  about Kleinâ€™s scheme to defraud District 17.Â  Although Klein instructed her \r\n  to deal exclusively with him, it was not unusual to have one contact on a corporate \r\n  account.Â  Follin said that Klein periodically would request an invoice for a \r\n  school groupâ€™s travel and would request her to void it the same week.Â  Because \r\n  the travel was voided and no longer appeared in her accounting system and the \r\n  checks would be issued days to weeks later and may include payment for several \r\n  voided invoices, it was not possible for her to recognize or recall that an \r\n  amount included in the check from District 17 matched the amount on a particular \r\n  voided invoice.Â  Further, as the checks did not list the invoice number on them, \r\n  Follin received instructions from Klein as to which invoice number to apply \r\n  the funds.Â  Because the checks were signed by Klein and the superintendent, \r\n  Follin testified that she did not suspect anything was out of the ordinary with \r\n  the checks.Â  Follin denied on cross-examination ever getting a check from District \r\n  17 the day after drafting a voided invoice.Â  However, when shown copies of voided \r\n  invoices with checks issued in that amount by District 17 the next day, Follin \r\n  stated she could not recall those incidents.\r\nÂ Follin stated she first \r\n  suspected Klein might have been involved in wrong-doing in September 1997 when \r\n  she requested a deposit for a cruise he had booked and he immediately asked \r\n  her for a voided invoice in the same amount for a school group.Â  Follin testified \r\n  that she created the invoice, but no longer handled travel arrangements with \r\n  Klein after that time.\r\nFollin described the events \r\n  leading to the creation of the â€œcredit.â€Â  According to Follin, Klein called \r\n  her on a Sunday sometime in early October and requested that she meet him at \r\n  her office.Â  Klein asked her to create false statements, back-dated to June \r\n  30, 1997, which indicated that District 17 had a large credit due to purchased \r\n  trips that were canceled.Â  Reviewing Follinâ€™s copies of District 17â€™s voided \r\n  invoices, Klein deduced which of the 1997 trips would be audited and he told \r\n  Follin she would be asked about them.Â  Klein instructed Follin to tell District \r\n  17 officials that he directed her to maintain the credit instead of issuing \r\n  a refund check.Â  Follin declared that Klein commented about her grandson, whom \r\n  she had custody of, during the meeting.Â  Because he had never done that before, \r\n  Follin said she felt Klein was threatening her life and her grandsonâ€™s life \r\n  if she did not create the false credit statements as he asked.Â  However, Follin \r\n  refused to shred the documents concerning District 17 travel as Klein requested.Â  \r\n  Follin kept the cashierâ€™s checks Klein and Adams brought later that week in \r\n  her safe deposit box at her bank.\r\nFollin testified regarding \r\n  her conversations with Principal Raffield and District 17 Attorney Davis during \r\n  their investigation of District 17 travel.Â  Follin admitted telling them that \r\n  District 17 had a credit and showing them the false statements.Â  She stated \r\n  that, when asked for the refund, she told them the money was at an out-of-town \r\n  bank.Â  Follin later wrote a check for $70,389.10 to District 17.Â  Although Follin \r\n  initially pretended District 17 was owed a â€œrefund,â€ she eventually admitted \r\n  to SLED that Klein had given her the money and turned over all her documents.Â  \r\n  However, Follin denied conspiring with Klein to defraud District 17 and denied \r\n  receiving anything from the transactions other than her normal commission.\r\nCriminal conspiracy is â€œa \r\n  combination between two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an \r\n  unlawful object or lawful object by unlawful means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 \r\n  (Supp. 2001).Â  To constitute conspiracy, there must be an agreement or a mutual \r\n  understanding.Â  State v. Horne, 324 S.C. 372, 478 S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996).Â  Proof of an express agreement or direct evidence of the agreement is \r\n  not essential, but the conspiracy may be shown by circumstantial evidence and \r\n  the actions of the parties.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d \r\n  63 (1998).Â  â€œThe substantive crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy \r\n  constitute circumstantial evidence of the existence of the conspiracy, its object, \r\n  and scope.â€Â  State v. Gosnell, 341 S.C. 627, 636, 535 S.E.2d 453, 458 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nViewing the evidence in \r\n  the light most favorable to the State, Klein would not have been able to proceed \r\n  with his travel scheme without Follinâ€™s assistance.Â  Despite the fact that there \r\n  was not a spoken agreement between the two to defraud District 17, the uncontradicted \r\n  evidence showed that Follin knowingly assisted Klein by creating false records \r\n  indicating District 17 had a credit.Â  Klein testified that he and Follin conspired \r\n  through their actions.Â  Although the agreement was not written or verbalized, \r\n  evidence was presented that an arrangement was reached between Klein and Follin \r\n  to defraud District 17.Â  Because there was evidence that reasonably tended to \r\n  prove Follin conspired with Klein, the trial judge properly denied Follinâ€™s \r\n  motion for a directed verdict as to this charge.Â  \r\nB.Â  Aiding and Abetting\r\nFollin contends the trial \r\n  court should have granted her motion for a directed verdict as to the charge \r\n  of aiding and abetting embezzlement because there was no evidence that she had \r\n  the intent to defraud District 17.Â  She asserts the evidence shows at most that \r\n  she was an accessory after the fact.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFollin was indicted for \r\n  aiding and abetting embezzlement in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-210 \r\n  (Supp. 2001).Â  Section 16-13-210 provides that it is â€œunlawful for an officer \r\n  or other person charged with the safekeeping, transfer, and disbursement of \r\n  public funds to embezzle these funds.â€Â Â  \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case, Follin moved for a directed verdict on the embezzlement charge.Â  The trial \r\n  judge denied her motion.Â  At the close of all the evidence, Follin renewed her \r\n  motion.Â  The trial court found that Follinâ€™s act of knowingly creating false \r\n  invoices at Kleinâ€™s request to help him avoid detection was evidence of aiding \r\n  and abetting the embezzlement. Â The trial court denied Follinâ€™s directed verdict \r\n  motion.\r\nWhen the factual presentation \r\n  is viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient \r\n  to go to the jury.Â  Follin knowingly assisted Klein in hiding his fraud.Â  Klein \r\n  testified Follin implicitly agreed to assist him by submitting false invoices \r\n  and then crediting the amounts paid on the invoices to his personal travel.Â  \r\n  Because there was sufficient evidence to submit the matter to the jury, the \r\n  trial court did not err in denying Follinâ€™s directed verdict motion.\r\nC.Â  Obtaining Goods and Services by False Pretenses\r\nFollin argues the trial \r\n  court erred by denying her motion for a directed verdict on the charge of obtaining \r\n  goods and services by false pretenses.Â  We disagree.\r\nAfter the State presented \r\n  its case, Follin moved for a directed verdict on the charge of obtaining property \r\n  by false pretenses, which was denied by the trial court.Â  At the close of all \r\n  the evidence, Follin renewed her motion, which was denied. \r\nSection 16-13-240 provides \r\n  that it is a felony for a person to, â€œby false pretense or representation[,] \r\n  obtain[] the signature of a person to a written instrument or obtain[] from \r\n  another person any chattel, money, valuable security, or other property, real \r\n  or personal, with intent to cheat and defraud a person of that property.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240 (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\nAlthough Follin claims \r\n  no evidence was presented which showed she made any false representations to \r\n  District 17 in order to obtain money, the evidence, when viewed in a light most \r\n  favorable to the State, lends a different conclusion.Â  Follin provided voided \r\n  invoices to Klein and accepted payment for them from District 17.Â  This was \r\n  evidence of a false representation.Â  Accordingly, we find there was sufficient \r\n  evidence to deny the motion for a directed verdict and to submit the matter \r\n  to the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, \r\n  Follinâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nCONNOR, J., dissents \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  (Concurring)\r\nI concur in Judge Andersonâ€™s opinion, but write separately \r\n  to focus on what I consider to be an extremely difficult task faced by an appellate \r\n  court in passing upon the acceptability of the sentence imposed in this case.\r\nIt is an undeniable fact \r\n  that for generations trial courts have not only been allowed but actually encouraged \r\n  to consider the entry of a guilty plea as an ameliorating factor in structuring \r\n  an appropriate sentence.Â  In stark contrast, it is now and has been for many \r\n  years totally unacceptable to impose a harsher sentence because a defendant \r\n  demands a jury trial rather than entering a guilty plea.Â  These two concepts \r\n  are almost irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nHere, the sentencing judge made statements \r\n  that clearly indicated his motivation for imposing a somewhat harsher sentence \r\n  upon this defendant than upon other defendants who entered guilty pleas was \r\n  based upon acceptable considerations.Â  At the same time, the sentencing judge \r\n  made remarks that can be and have been interpreted as being violative of recent \r\n  decisions of this court and the supreme court.Â \r\nThe question, then, is which of the two diametrically \r\n  opposite statements are we to consider as controlling in judging his motivation?Â  \r\n  Are we to look exclusively at those statements that are unacceptable, disregarding \r\n  the acceptable, or do we do just the opposite and disregard the unacceptable \r\n  in favor of the acceptable?\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, perhaps the \r\n  best thing if not the only thing to do is to disregard the statements altogether \r\n  or consider them neutral on the issue of his motivation, and determine whether, \r\n  on the record, the sentence imposed is justified in comparison to the more lenient \r\n  sentence imposed on other defendants.Â  Using that as the criteria, this sentence \r\n  is unquestionably justified.\r\nCONNOR, J. (dissenting):Â  \r\n  I respectfully dissent from Issue II in the majority opinion and would reverse \r\n  Follinâ€™s sentence and remand for resentencing.Â  The trial judge committed an \r\n  error of law by improperly considering Follinâ€™s decision to proceed with a jury \r\n  trial.Â  As noted by the majority, the trial judge made it quite clear by his \r\n  statements that he was giving Follin a harsher sentence because she had not \r\n  pled guilty, as most of her co-defendants had.\r\nHe specifically \r\n  stated he gave consideration to the defendants who entered guilty pleas and \r\n  admitted their guilt. [6] [1]Â  The judge further asserted he could not \r\n  ignore another defendantâ€™s admission of guilt. [7] [2]Â  Such sentencing comments have been expressly \r\n  disapproved and warrant reversal.Â  See Davis v. State, 336 S.C. \r\n  329, 520 S.E.2d 801 (1999) (disapproving the trial judgeâ€™s statements regarding \r\n  other defendantsâ€™ guilty pleas and admissions of guilt); State v. Brouwer, \r\n  346 S.C. 375, 387, 550 S.E.2d 915, 922 (Ct. App. 2001) (disapproving the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s â€œserious consideration for someone admitting their guiltâ€ as being â€œthe \r\n  first step towards rehabilitationâ€).\r\nFurthermore, I disagree \r\n  with the majorityâ€™s interpretation of Brouwer.Â  Specifically, the majorityâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that â€œwhen the record clearly reflects an appropriate basis for a \r\n  disparate sentence, the sentencing judge may impose a different sentence on \r\n  a co-defendant in a criminal trialâ€ is troubling.Â  In my opinion, a sentencing \r\n  review pursuant to Brouwer requires us to confine our analysis to the \r\n  judgeâ€™s comments on the record at sentencing.Â  I do not believe the language \r\n  of Brouwer permits a de novo review of whether there is an â€œappropriate \r\n  basisâ€ for a sentence, especially where, as here, to do so would negate a judgeâ€™s \r\n  comments which are clearly based on an improper consideration of a defendantâ€™s \r\n  decision to exercise her right to a jury trial. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Follin erroneously refers to this entity as the â€œStatewide \r\n    Grand Jury.â€Â  As clearly indicated in the statute, this judicial body is known \r\n    as the State Grand Jury.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1600 (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  The same judge presided over Martinâ€™s \r\n    jury trial and sentenced him to three concurrent terms of ten years, suspended \r\n    upon the service of one year and five years probation.Â  At the hearing on \r\n    Martinâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the trial judge noted that he was not \r\n    punishing Martin for exercising his right to a jury trial, but he gave consideration \r\n    to the others who pled guilty:\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  No \r\n    one should be punished because they have exercised their right to have a trial \r\n    by jury.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  \r\n  It occurred to me in sentencing not \r\n    as a punishment, but what do you use as a minimum sentence?Â  How is that â€“ \r\n    how can that be for the person who admits their guilt versus a person for \r\n    trial?Â  If everybody is to be treated the same, then we â€“ there would never \r\n    be any distinction.Â  And none of the case law that we have had or none of \r\n    the things that we have all said throughout the practice of law would have \r\n    no meaning at all. \r\n  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  \r\n  He didnâ€™t stand up and admit as the \r\n    other persons did admit that I did something wrong and not only did I admit \r\n    that Iâ€™m doing something wrong, but I admit and Iâ€™m willing to pay â€œXâ€ number \r\n    of dollars.Â  Those are factors . . . .\r\n  \r\n  If those arenâ€™t factors that a court \r\n    should consider then the Supreme Court needs to come out and say so and I \r\n    would urge them to do so . . . .\r\n  Restitution is a part of it.Â  Itâ€™s \r\n    a part that I will consider. \r\n  . . . .\r\n  . . . I have to fashion a sentence \r\n    given that set of circumstances, then I have to fashion a sentence for somebody \r\n    that comes up and says Iâ€™m guilty, I admit my guilt, Iâ€™m wrong, and not only \r\n    am I guilty but, Your Honor, I â€“ I cost the State or I cost the victim in \r\n    this situation â€œXâ€ number of dollars and I want to repay that.Â  \r\n  That is the distinction, not what \r\n    he is saying to me, but that is the distinction that I have to determine.Â  \r\n    Is that person entitled to some consideration?\r\n  . . . .\r\n  &nbsp; . . . The other people got consideration \r\n    for their sentence because they entered a guilty plea.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  &nbsp; . . . I gave credit for admitting \r\n    guilt.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n     [3] Â  The trial judge in the present case was the trial \r\n    judge in Brouwer.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n     [4] Â  The co-defendant was sentenced to two years imprisonment \r\n    plus a $5,000 fine, with the sentence suspended upon payment of $750 and two \r\n    years probation.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n     [5] Â  The sentence for conspiracy is no more than five \r\n    years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (Supp. 2001).Â  The sentence for embezzlement \r\n    of public funds is no greater than ten years where the amount of funds embezzled \r\n    is $5,000 or more.Â  If the amount is less than $5,000, the sentence shall \r\n    be no more than five years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-210 (1)-(2) (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n    Finally, the sentence for obtaining a signature or property by false pretenses \r\n    is no more than ten years where the property is valued at $5,000 or more.Â  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240(1) (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] [1]Â  For example, in Johnny Martinâ€™s case, the \r\n    trial judge stated â€œ[t]he other people got consideration for their sentence \r\n    because they entered a guilty plea. . . .Â  I gave credit for admitting guilt.â€ \r\n    The trial judge specifically incorporated these statements during Follinâ€™s \r\n    sentence reduction hearing.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7] [2]Â Â  The trial judge stated, â€œas I mentioned \r\n    in sentencing Johnny Martin and I have said throughout and will continue to \r\n    say I canâ€™t ignore [co-defendant] Benji Adams admitting his guilt . . . .â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3560","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy \r\n  Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold \r\n  M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Druanne D. White, of Anderson, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:&nbsp;\r\nBrent P. Guthrie was convicted of first degree burglary.Â  On \r\n  appeal, he contends the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because \r\n  the State improperly amended his indictment at trial.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGuthrie, Mark Velt, and Jerry Lambert broke into \r\n  Ed Tanneryâ€™s fishing cabin during the evening sometime between January 13 and \r\n  January 15, 1999.Â  The three men removed beer, a tackle box, fishing rods, and \r\n  several other items from the cabin.Â  They filled their truck with these items, \r\n  deposited them in Veltâ€™s hotel room, and returned to the cabin a second time \r\n  to extricate more items.Â  All three men were charged with the crime.\r\nGuthrie was indicted for first degree burglary \r\n  based on the aggravating factor of unlawfully entering the dwelling during the \r\n  nighttime hours.Â  At the beginning of Guthrieâ€™s trial, the State moved to amend \r\n  the indictment to include as an additional aggravating factor Guthrieâ€™s conviction \r\n  of two or more prior burglaries.Â  Guthrie objected to the amendment and argued \r\n  the presentation of his six prior burglaries would be prejudicial to his defense.Â  \r\n  The Circuit Court found Guthrie would not suffer any prejudice and allowed the \r\n  amendment.Â  Although the Circuit Court granted the amendment, it does not appear \r\n  from the record that the actual indictment was altered to include the additional \r\n  aggravating factor.\r\nThe State later submitted evidence of Guthrieâ€™s \r\n  six prior burglary convictions.Â  The Circuit Court instructed the jury that \r\n  they were not to consider the prior convictions as proof of guilt in the present \r\n  case, but that it was evidence that would satisfy an element of first degree \r\n  burglary.\r\nVelt testified at trial regarding Guthrieâ€™s participation \r\n  in the burglary.Â  The jury found Guthrie guilty of first degree burglary.Â  The \r\n  foreman signed the verdict form on the back of the original indictment, which \r\n  charged the element of entering in the nighttime.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGuthrie maintains the Circuit \r\n  Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the amendment to the indictment \r\n  added an additional element of aggravation that was not presented to the grand \r\n  jury.Â  We agree.\r\nI.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nThe jurisdiction of a court \r\n  over the subject matter of a proceeding is fundamental.Â  Brown v. State, \r\n  343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001).Â  The Circuit Court does not have subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant of an offense unless: (1) there has \r\n  been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2) the defendant \r\n  has waived presentment of the indictment; or (3) the offense is a lesser included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  State v. Primus, 349 \r\n  S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002); State v. Timmons, 349 S.C. 389, 563 \r\n  S.E.2d 657 (2002); State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001).\r\nThe lack of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on \r\n  appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.Â  State v. \r\n  Brown, Op. No. 3549 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Sept. 9, 2002)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. \r\n  No. 32 at 52); see also State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d \r\n  220 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may \r\n  be raised at any time).Â  Furthermore, lack of subject matter jurisdiction may \r\n  not be waived, even by consent of the parties, and should be taken notice of \r\n  by this Court.Â  Brown, 343 S.C. at 346, 540 S.E.2d at 848.Â  The acts \r\n  of a court with respect to a matter as to which it has no jurisdiction are void.Â  \r\n  Id. at 346, 540 S.E.2d at 849; State v. Funderburk, 259 S.C. 256, \r\n  191 S.E.2d 520 (1972).\r\nII.Â  Sufficiency of the Indictment\r\nIn South Carolina, an indictment \r\n  â€œshall be deemed and judged sufficient and good in law which, in addition to \r\n  allegations as to time and place, as required by law, charges the crime substantially \r\n  in the language of the common law or of the statute prohibiting the crime or \r\n  so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood and, \r\n  if the offense be a statutory offense, that the offense be alleged to be contrary \r\n  to the statute in such case made and provided.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (1985).Â  \r\n  Thus, an indictment passes legal muster if it charges the crime substantially \r\n  in the language of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the \r\n  nature of the offense charged may be easily understood.Â  State v. Reddick, \r\n  348 S.C. 631, 560 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nThe indictment must state the offense with sufficient \r\n  certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, \r\n  and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer, and whether he may \r\n  plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. \r\n  366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995); State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  586 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).Â  The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether \r\n  it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the \r\n  defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.Â  Browning, 320 S.C. at \r\n  368, 465 S.E.2d at 359; Reddick, 348 S.C. at 635, 560 S.E.2d at 443.Â  \r\n  An indictment phrased substantially in the language of the statute which creates \r\n  and defines the offense is ordinarily sufficient.Â  State v. Shoemaker, \r\n  276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 (1981).\r\nAn indictment is sufficient \r\n  to convey jurisdiction if it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense \r\n  intended to be charged and informs the defendant of the circumstances he must \r\n  be prepared to defend.Â  Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 533 S.E.2d 324 (2000); \r\n  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998); Hamilton, \r\n  344 S.C. at 364, 543 S.E.2d at 597.Â  Generally, an indictment is required to \r\n  perform two functions: (1) it should inform the accused of the charge against \r\n  him by listing the elements of the offense charged; and (2) it should be sufficiently \r\n  specific to protect the accused against double jeopardy.Â  State v. Bullard, \r\n  348 S.C. 611, 560 S.E.2d 436 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nSouth Carolina courts have \r\n  held that the sufficiency of an indictment must be viewed with a practical eye.Â  \r\n  State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d 582 (1981), overruled on \r\n  other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  \r\n  All the surrounding circumstances must be weighed before an accurate determination \r\n  of whether a defendant was or was not prejudiced can be reached.Â  Id.\r\nIII.Â  Amendment of Indictment\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  section 17-19-100 (1985), states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIf (a) there be any defect in form in any indictments \r\n  or (b) on the trial of any case there shall appear to be any variance between \r\n  the allegations of the indictment and the evidence offered in proof thereof, \r\n  the court before which the trial shall be had may amend the indictment (according \r\n  to the proof, if the amendment be because of a variance) if such amendment does \r\n  not change the nature of the offense charged.\r\n\r\nAn indictment may be amended \r\n  provided such amendment does not change the nature of the offense charged.Â  \r\n  State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001); see also \r\n  Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 507 S.E.2d 322 (1998) (finding that, under \r\n  Â§ 17-19-100, an indictment may be amended at trial only if amendment does not \r\n  change nature of offense charged).Â  For example, an amendment which changes \r\n  an offense to one with increased punishment deprives the Circuit Court of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  Lynch, 344 S.C. at 639, 545 S.E.2d at 513; Hopkins \r\n  v. State, 317 S.C. 7, 451 S.E.2d 389 (1994); State v. Riddle, 301 \r\n  S.C. 211, 391 S.E.2d 253 (1990).Â  However, an amendment may deprive the Circuit \r\n  Court of jurisdiction even if it does not change the penalty.Â  See Lynch, \r\n  344 S.C. at 639, 545 S.E.2d at 514; Weinhauer v. State, 334 S.C. 327, \r\n  513 S.E.2d 840 (1999).\r\nAmendments to an indictment \r\n  are permissible if: 1) they do not change the nature of the offense; 2) the \r\n  charge is a lesser included offense of the crime charged on the indictment; \r\n  or 3) the defendant waives presentment to the grand jury and pleads guilty.Â  \r\n  State v. Myers, 313 S.C. 391, 438 S.E.2d 236 (1993).\r\nIV.Â  Efficacy of Amendment\r\nGuthrie asserts the trial \r\n  court erred in allowing the State to amend his indictment at trial by adding \r\n  the additional aggravating factor and, therefore, the court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over his case.Â  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  section 16-11-311(A) (Supp. 2001) provides:\r\n(A) A person is guilty of burglary in the first \r\n  degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit \r\n  a crime in the dwelling, and either:\r\n\r\n(1) when, in effecting entry or while in the \r\n  dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n  \r\n(a) is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; \r\n  or\r\n(b) causes physical injury to a person who \r\n  is not a participant in the crime; or\r\n(c) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous \r\n  instrument; or\r\n(d) displays what is or appears to be a knife, \r\n  pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm;Â  or\r\n  \r\n(2) the burglary is committed by a person with \r\n  a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a \r\n  combination of both; or\r\n(3) the entering or remaining occurs in the \r\n  nighttime.\r\n\r\nThe relevant aggravating factors in the present \r\n  case involve: â€œ(2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record \r\n  of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of \r\n  both; or (3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe case of State v. \r\n  Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001), is particularly instructive.Â  \r\n  In Lynch, the defendant was indicted for first degree burglary, with \r\n  the aggravating factor being that the burglary occurred in the nighttime.Â  At \r\n  the outset of trial, the State moved to amend the indictment to strike out the \r\n  words â€œin the hours during darknessâ€ and to replace that phrase with â€œcaused \r\n  physical injury.â€Â  The trial court allowed the amendment.\r\nOn appeal, the defendant \r\n  argued that an aggravating circumstance is a required element of first degree \r\n  burglary, and the aggravating circumstance upon which his burglary conviction \r\n  was based had never been presented to the grand jury.Â  Therefore, he claimed, \r\n  the amendment to the indictment deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over the burglary charge.Â  The Supreme Court agreed and held:\r\n\r\nThe offense of first degree burglary, as defined \r\n  by section 16-11-311, occurs when a person enters a dwelling without consent, \r\n  with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and an aggravating circumstance \r\n  is present.Â  Without an aggravating circumstance, the crime committed would \r\n  be second degree burglary.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(A).Â  Thus, \r\n  although it is only one element of the crime, the aggravating circumstance is \r\n  â€œthe essenceâ€ of first degree burglary.Â  [State v.] Sowell, 85 S.C. at \r\n  284, 67 S.E. at 318.Â  Moreover, these aggravating circumstances are quite distinct \r\n  from one another, and thus, the proof required for each aggravating circumstance \r\n  is materially different from one another.Â  Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(1), \r\n  (2) &amp; (3).\r\nWe find that by changing the aggravating circumstance \r\n  from entering during the darkness to causing physical injury, the amendment \r\n  to the indictment â€œsubstituted an entirely different [offense] for the one charged.â€Â  \r\n  Sowell, 85 S.C. at 284, 67 S.E. at 318.Â  The amendment was a material \r\n  change which modified what the defendant was â€œcalled upon to answer.â€Â  Browning \r\n  [v. State], 320 S.C. at 368, 465 S.E.2d at 359.Â  Accordingly, the amendment \r\n  deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction over the burglary \r\n  charge.\r\nThe State argues that the amendment was properly \r\n  permitted because it came as no â€œsurpriseâ€ to appellant.Â  The trial court utilized \r\n  a similar â€œprejudiceâ€ analysis when it allowed the amendment.Â  However, in testing \r\n  the sufficiency of an indictment and the propriety of amending an indictment, \r\n  it is improper to look to other indictments, even if those indictments relate \r\n  to the same course of conduct.Â  A subject matter jurisdiction analysis is performed \r\n  on individual charges, not the charges in the aggregate. Â The appropriate analysis \r\n  is whether the amendment to the indictment changed the nature of the offense \r\n  charged, not whether the amendment in any way surprised or prejudiced appellant.Â  \r\n  See Â§ 17-19-100.Â  We hold the amendment here violated section 17-19-100.\r\n\r\nLynch, 344 S.C. at 640-41, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d at 514 (footnote omitted).\r\nSimilarly, the amendment \r\n  in the instant case changed the nature of the offense charged.Â  The two aggravating \r\n  circumstances in the case sub judice are distinct from one another, \r\n  and thus, the proof required for each aggravating circumstance is materially \r\n  different from the other.Â  The amendment was a material change which modified \r\n  what Guthrie was called upon to answer.Â  It was impossible for Guthrie to prepare \r\n  a defense to the additional factor regarding two or more prior convictions where \r\n  the aggravating circumstance was not added until trial.Â  We rule the amendment \r\n  deprived the Circuit Court of subject matter jurisdiction over the first degree \r\n  burglary charge.\r\nThe dissent articulates \r\n  an amendment rule with no boundaries or parameters.Â  The rule set forth in the \r\n  dissenting opinion allows for â€œamendment ambushâ€ on the eve of trial.Â  Moreover, \r\n  under the rule advanced by the dissent, a multi-faceted criminal charge containing \r\n  alternative grounds for aggravation is thrust upon a defendant at trial with \r\n  an indictment containing only one of the alternatives.Â  The implementation of \r\n  such an amendment procedure would create evidentiary conundrums of gargantuan \r\n  proportion to a defendant as the trial commences.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Circuit Court erred in granting the Stateâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend the indictment at trial to include as an additional aggravating \r\n  factor Guthrieâ€™s conviction of two or more prior burglaries.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  Circuit Courtâ€™s decision to grant the amendment to the indictment is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nCONNOR, J., concurs.\r\nSTILWELL, J., dissents \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J. \r\n  (dissenting):Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because I believe the trial court \r\n  retained subject matter jurisdiction following the amendment of Guthrieâ€™s burglary \r\n  indictment, I respectfully dissent. \r\nIn Lynch, our supreme \r\n  court held that by â€œchanging the aggravating circumstance from entering during \r\n  the darkness to causing physical injury, the amendment to the indictment â€˜substituted \r\n  an entirely different [offense] for the one charged.â€™â€Â  State v. Lynch, \r\n  344 S.C. 635, 640-41, 545 S.E.2d 511, 514 (2001) (quoting State v. Sowell, \r\n  85 S.C. 278, 284, 67 S.E. 316, 318 (1910)) (alteration in original).Â  Thus the \r\n  court held the substitution of one aggravating factor for another divested the \r\n  trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Unlike Lynch, the amendment \r\n  here did not substitute one aggravating circumstance for another; it \r\n  added an additional one.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court \r\n  to â€œhear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in \r\n  question belong.â€Â  Brown v. Evatt, 322 S.C. 189, 193, 470 S.E.2d 848, \r\n  850 (1996); Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  598, 600 (1994).Â  While the amendment may have offended the law in some other \r\n  particular, the only issue before us is subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See \r\n  Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is \r\n  not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€).Â  In my view, because \r\n  the aggravating circumstance passed upon by the grand jury remained in the indictment, \r\n  the trial court retained subject matter jurisdiction and the addition of another \r\n  aggravating factor did not divest the trial court of that jurisdiction.Â  Cf. \r\n  State v. White, 338 S.C. 56, 525 S.E.2d 261 (Ct.

Baril appeals the Circuit \r\n  Courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Aiken Regional Medical Centers (Hospital) \r\n  on Barilâ€™s action for breach of employment contract.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBaril joined Hospitalâ€™s nursing staff in 1986.Â  She \r\n  earned a masterâ€™s degree in nursing administration from the University of South \r\n  Carolina in 1990.Â  The following year, Baril was named director of Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  emergency department.Â  Baril resigned from that position for personal reasons \r\n  in 1992, but continued as a staff nurse in the emergency department.Â  Holly \r\n  Martinez de Andino eventually succeeded Baril as director of Hospitalâ€™s emergency \r\n  department.Â  John Arnold [1]  and Martinez de \r\n  Andino indirectly supervised Baril.\r\nIn early 1993, Baril began teaching nursing classes \r\n  on a part-time basis at the University of South Carolinaâ€™s Aiken campus (USC-Aiken).Â  \r\n  She joined the faculty on a full-time basis later that year.\r\nBaril received an â€œAssociate Handbookâ€ from Hospital \r\n  in May of 1997.Â  She signed an acknowledgment form provided by Hospital, indicating \r\n  she would familiarize herself with the handbook and that she understood the \r\n  handbook â€œconstitute[d] the personnel policies of [Hospital] and that [she was] \r\n  governed by them.â€Â  The handbook and acknowledgment form contained disclaimer \r\n  language:\r\nPlease Read!\r\nImportant Employment Information\r\n\r\nThe information contained in this booklet is designed to \r\n  serve only as a reference to Aiken Regional Medical Centers policies and procedures.Â  \r\n  Aiken Regional Medical Centers reserves the right to amend this guide as necessary \r\n  at any time, with or without prior notice.Â  Current hospital policies and procedures \r\n  will apply in all cases.\r\nPlease remember that this booklet does not constitute \r\n  a contract between you and Aiken Regional Medical Centers.Â  Employment at \r\n  Aiken Regional Medical Centers is on a voluntary basis and either you or \r\n  the Facility may terminate this employment relationship at any time with or \r\n  without reason or prior notice.\r\nNo associate of Aiken Regional Medical Centers has the right \r\n  to make verbal promises or commitments which may create a contract and thereby \r\n  alter the â€œemployment at willâ€ relationship.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  Additionally, the handbookâ€™s â€œRecruiting and Hiringâ€ section \r\n  included similar language:\r\n\r\nIn no event shall a hiring of an associate be considered \r\n  as creating a contractual [re]lationship between the associate and the Facility; \r\n  and, unless otherwise provided in writing, such relationship shall be defined \r\n  as â€œemployment at will,â€ where either party may dissolve the relationship.Â  \r\n  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHowever, the acknowledgment form states that â€œthe information in [the] handbook \r\n  is subject to change/revisionâ€ and â€œany change will be communicated through \r\n  the usual channels.â€\r\nThe handbook incorporated a detailed, progressive disciplinary procedure.Â  \r\n  Two categories of offenses were specifically identified.Â  The categories were \r\n  bifurcated: (1) actions meriting immediate termination; and (2) actions warranting \r\n  termination for continuous violations.\r\nIn July of 1998, Martinez de Andino disciplined Baril for allegedly \r\n  slamming a door in Arnoldâ€™s face and disagreeing with Hospitalâ€™s management \r\n  regarding a management issue. \r\n  [2] Â  Baril was first suspended and later given a â€œfinalâ€ written \r\n  warning.Â  Yet, the handbookâ€™s procedure mandated use of a â€œfinalâ€ written warning \r\n  only after two previous warnings.Â  Baril had not previously been warned or disciplined.\r\nBaril asked Hospital to change her work status from full-time to \r\n  part-time in November 1998.Â  She continued to teach full-time at USC-Aiken.\r\nBaril initiated a grievance pursuant to Hospital policy.Â  Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  chief executive officer, Richard H. Satcher, investigated Barilâ€™s complaint \r\n  and found sufficient cause to purge the disciplinary action from Barilâ€™s employment \r\n  file.Â  As a condition to purging her employment file, Satcher required Baril \r\n  and Martinez de Andino to meet with Hospitalâ€™s director of human resources, \r\n  Richard Lowe, and director of nursing, Mary Ann Angle.Â  The purpose of the meeting \r\n  was to â€œclarify understandings and expectationsâ€ regarding Baril and Martinez \r\n  de Andinoâ€™s working relationship.\r\nIn January of 1999, Baril met with Martinez de Andino, Lowe, and \r\n  Angle to discuss problems between Baril and Martinez de Andino.Â  During the \r\n  meeting, Baril expressed concern that Martinez de Andino had targeted Baril \r\n  for termination which Martinez de Andino intended to accomplish using the disciplinary \r\n  procedure.Â  Lowe responded that Hospital had updated pertinent portions of its \r\n  employee handbook to prevent the disciplinary procedure from being abused to \r\n  eliminate employees and to ensure that it would only be used to positively impact \r\n  its employees.\r\nLowe delivered a copy of the new policy to Baril.Â  Regarding its \r\n  purpose, the policy stated:\r\n\r\nTo set standard operating procedures in order to ensure \r\n  that all associates are fully aware of the conduct expected of them.Â  \r\n  This policy will also ensure fair and consistent treatment to associates \r\n  if violations of these standards of conduct occur.\r\nThis policy is based on the concept of increased severity \r\n  in disciplining associates who repeatedly violate hospital rules while performing \r\n  work for the hospital or while on hospital premises.Â  Written counselings are \r\n  given for initial, minor infractions of rules; if the infractions continue harsher \r\n  discipline is enforced.Â  However, situations which are so serious that they \r\n  require immediate stern disciplinary action will not follow a progressive concept.Â  \r\n  [Hospital] reserves the right to administer disciplinary action as it deems \r\n  appropriate for the circumstances involved.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  The new policy provided: â€œDiscipline is an instrument for \r\n  changing unacceptable performance or behavior, and for providing motivation \r\n  and encouragement for disciplined associates.â€\r\nThe new policy described four general categories of disciplinary \r\n  offenses, ranging in degree of seriousness from greatest (critical offenses) \r\n  to least (minor offenses).Â  The category of â€œcritical offensesâ€ included actions \r\n  that constituted â€œserious violations of rules or associate misconduct which \r\n  justify immediate termination without regard to the associateâ€™s length of service \r\n  or prior conduct.â€Â  The new policy contained various examples of critical offenses.Â  \r\n  It specified in section 2.2.2 of HR116 that actions of â€œ[d]ishonesty, fraud, \r\n  theft (regardless of the amount), [or] unauthorized removal of hospital propertyâ€ \r\n  were examples of critical offenses.\r\nAt the end of the meeting, Baril and Martinez de Andino signed a \r\n  document identifying â€œexpectationsâ€ concerning Barilâ€™s and Hospitalâ€™s obligations \r\n  to each other.Â  The details of the document consisted of expectations related \r\n  to performance and communications.\r\nOn July 6, 1999, Baril suffered injuries when a cabinet fell on her \r\n  while at work.Â  She immediately sought treatment for injuries involving muscle \r\n  strain, subperiosteal hematoma, and an impinged nerve.Â  Baril filed an accident \r\n  report and claim for Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits at the time of the accident.\r\nFour days after her accident, on July 10, 1999, Baril traveled to \r\n  Tacoma, Washington, for a vacation.Â  When Baril arrived, she received a telephone \r\n  message indicating Hospital called her sister in an effort to contact Baril.Â  \r\n  In response, Baril called Hospital on its toll-free number and asked to speak \r\n  to someone in her department.Â  After a brief conversation with a coworker, Baril \r\n  asked the coworker to transfer her call to her sisterâ€™s home in Aiken.Â  Baril \r\n  informed her sister that she had arrived in Washington safely, and asked why \r\n  Hospital wanted to talk to her.Â  Barilâ€™s sister offered to call Hospital to \r\n  ask why it had contacted her to try to reach Baril.Â  However, Baril declined \r\n  her sisterâ€™s offer.\r\nAccording to telephone company records, the call lasted thirty-two \r\n  seconds.Â  No evidence exists in the record concerning the cost of the call or \r\n  whether Hospital sustained any economic loss as a result of the call.\r\nBaril returned from vacation on July 17, 1999.Â  When she reported \r\n  to work the following day, Baril was told to meet with Arnold and Martinez de \r\n  Andino.Â  At the meeting, Baril learned that by using Hospitalâ€™s toll-free number \r\n  for personal use, she violated section 2.2.2 of Hospital Policy HR116, which \r\n  cites â€œ[d]ishonesty, fraud, theft (regardless of amount), unauthorized removal \r\n  of hospital property,â€ as â€œcritical offensesâ€ justifying immediate termination.Â  \r\n  Baril offered to pay for the telephone call, but Arnold refused to accept payment \r\n  and informed her she was being terminated.Â  Baril exited the premises a short \r\n  time thereafter.\r\nBaril filed this cause of action averring (1) Hospital created a contract of \r\n  employment between Baril and itself through its written employee handbook, its \r\n  amendments to the handbook, and its conduct regarding the handbookâ€™s policies, \r\n  particularly the mandatory language of the disciplinary procedure in HR116 and \r\n  verbal assurances provided by Lowe during the January 1999 meeting; (2) Hospital \r\n  breached the contract between Baril and itself by wrongfully terminating her; \r\n  and (3) Hospital violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-1-80 (Supp. 2001) by terminating \r\n  Baril in retaliation for filing a Workersâ€™ Compensation claim.Â  Baril sought \r\n  $403,508 in actual damages, plus costs and other just and proper relief.\r\nHospital answered, generally denying Barilâ€™s allegations and claiming it â€œacted \r\n  in good faithâ€ when dealing with Barilâ€™s discipline and termination.Â  Hospital \r\n  specifically asserted that Baril was an at-will employee throughout her employment \r\n  with Hospital, and denied the existence of an employment contract.Â  Hospital \r\n  further claimed that, even if any employment contract existed, Hospital never \r\n  breached it and that Barilâ€™s discharge was not wrongful.Â  Hospital cited \r\n  Barilâ€™s own conduct as the source of â€œany and all of the employment actions \r\n  that [Hospital] took against [Baril].â€Â  Additionally, Hospital maintained \r\n  that Baril â€œfailed to meet [Hospitalâ€™s] established work standards, stole [Hospitalâ€™s] \r\n  time and possibly money when making an impermissible telephone call, and violated \r\n  at least one of [Hospitalâ€™s] specific written Company policies for which [Hospitalâ€™s] \r\n  action was a stated remedy of the violation.â€Â  Finally, Hospital contended Baril \r\n  failed to mitigate any damages she might have sustained.\r\nHospital moved for summary judgment, arguing no material issues of fact existed \r\n  and Hospital was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  The Circuit Court \r\n  conducted a hearing on the motion and issued an order finding: (1) Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  policies did not constitute an implied employment contract as a matter of law, \r\n  even when viewed in the light most favorable to Baril; (2) even if Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  policies constituted an implied employment contract, Hospitalâ€™s actions did \r\n  not breach the contract because it acted pursuant to the express terms of the \r\n  alleged contract and because Barilâ€™s interpretation of the alleged contract \r\n  was â€œstrained and unreasonable and would have led to absurd consequencesâ€; (3) \r\n  Hospital did not breach any alleged contract because on the date Hospital terminated \r\n  Baril it had a â€œreasonable, good faith belief that, pursuant to the language \r\n  of HR 116, it had sufficient and just cause to terminate [Barilâ€™s] employmentâ€; \r\n  (4) Baril failed to establish a retaliation claim because she â€œbased this cause \r\n  of action merely upon her own self-serving, unsupported opinions and the temporal \r\n  proximity between the filing of her workersâ€™ compensation claim and her termination \r\n  of employmentâ€; and (5) Baril failed to mitigate her damages because she â€œdid \r\n  nothing to seek employment or mitigate damages in any way.â€Â  The Circuit Court \r\n  dismissed all of Barilâ€™s claims with prejudice.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming \r\n  v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002); Ferguson v. Charleston \r\n  Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2002).Â  In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, \r\n  350 S.C. 315, 566 S.E.2d 536 (2002); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, \r\n  499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must \r\n  go to the jury.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. \r\n  714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of \r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence \r\n  must be construed most strongly against the moving party.Â  Bayle v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions \r\n  or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Hall \r\n  v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 561 S.E.2d 654 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Moreover, summary \r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â  Lanham \r\n  v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 563 S.E.2d 331 (2002); Trivelas \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Did the Circuit Court err in granting summary judgment on the issue \r\n  of whether Hospitalâ€™s written policies and actual practices created an employment \r\n  contract between the parties?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Did the Circuit Court err in granting summary judgment on the issue \r\n  of whether Hospitalâ€™s actions in terminating Barilâ€™s employment breached a contract \r\n  between the parties?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Did the Circuit Court err in granting summary judgment on the issue \r\n  of whether Baril acted reasonably in attempting to mitigate her damages?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Existence of Employment Contract\r\nBaril maintains the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment because, \r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Baril as the nonmoving party, \r\n  material issues of fact exist concerning whether Hospitalâ€™s written policies \r\n  and actual practices created an employment contract between Baril and Hospital.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the doctrine of employment at-will.Â  Prescott \r\n  v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 516 S.E.2d 923 (1999).Â  This \r\n  doctrine provides that a contract for permanent employment is terminable at \r\n  the pleasure of either party when unsupported by any consideration other than \r\n  the employerâ€™s duty to provide compensation in exchange for the employeeâ€™s duty \r\n  to perform a service or obligation.Â  Id.Â  â€œAt-will employment is generally \r\n  terminable by either party at any time, for any reason or no reason at all.â€Â  \r\n  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 334, 516 S.E.2d at 925.\r\n However, an employer and employee may contractually alter the general \r\n  rule of employment at-will, thereby restricting the freedom of either party \r\n  to terminate the employment relationship without incurring liability.Â  See \r\n  Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987).Â Â  \r\n  For example, an employee handbook may create a contract altering an at-will \r\n  arrangement.Â  Id.Â  \r\nBecause an employee handbook may create an employment contract, the question \r\n  of whether a contract exists is for a jury when its existence is questioned \r\n  and the evidence is either conflicting or admits of more than one inference.Â  \r\n  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002) (stating \r\n  summary judgment is inappropriate in most instances when handbook contains both \r\n  a disclaimer and promises).Â  The presence of promissory language and a disclaimer \r\n  in the handbook make it ambiguous and subject to more than one interpretation. \r\n  [3] Â  See Fleming v. Borden, 316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d \r\n  589 (1994) (stating that a handbook containing both a disclaimer and promissory \r\n  language should be viewed as inherently ambiguous).\r\nHere, the handbook states that it does not operate to change the at-will nature \r\n  of employment to a contractual relationship.Â  However, the handbookâ€™s procedures \r\n  concerning progressive discipline, discharge, and grievance are couched in mandatory \r\n  terms, including assurances that the procedures will be followed.Â  As to Loweâ€™s \r\n  statements regarding the new disciplinary policy, Baril testified:\r\n\r\nRichard Lowe told me, guaranteed me that the new disciplinary \r\n  policy was put into effect for exactly that reason because I told Richard, I \r\n  said, you know, I have been a manager, and you can use a disciplinary procedure \r\n  to try to eliminate people or try to help people grow and have positive behaviors \r\n  and goals and grow.\r\n  And Richard Lowe said that is what that policy is for, \r\n  is to help you, and that is what is going to be happening from this point forward, \r\n  and I felt that that was a guarantee, was a contract, a verbal contract that \r\n  I would be treated equitably, that I would beâ€”that I would not be targeted any \r\n  further, that the grievance was over, and we were to go forward.Â  And so I felt \r\n  at that time that that was a contract that was made . . . .\r\n\r\nThus, the Hospitalâ€™s procedures and practices give rise to more than one reasonable \r\n  inference concerning the creation of an employment contract.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  we find the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s policies found in its employee handbook, amendments, and actual practices \r\n  created an employment contract between Baril and Hospital.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Hospitalâ€™s Actions in Terminating Barilâ€™s Employment \r\nBaril claims the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment \r\n  because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Baril as the nonmoving \r\n  party, material issues of fact exist regarding whether Hospitalâ€™s actions in \r\n  terminating her employment breached an employment contract between Hospital \r\n  and Baril.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen an employment contract only permits termination for cause, the appropriate \r\n  test on the issue of breach focuses on whether the employer had a â€œreasonable \r\n  good faith belief that sufficient cause existed for termination.â€Â  \r\n  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 464, 560 S.E.2d 606, 611 \r\n  (2002) (emphasis added).Â  â€œ[T]he fact finder must not focus on whether the employee \r\n  actually committed misconduct; instead, the focus must be on whether the employer \r\n  reasonably determined it had cause to terminate.â€Â  Id. at 464-65, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d at 611.\r\n a.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Reasonable Good Faith\r\nIn the January 1999 meeting, Baril expressed concern that Martinez de Andino \r\n  disliked her and would use Hospitalâ€™s disciplinary process to terminate her.Â  \r\n  Lowe responded that Hospital had updated pertinent portions of its employee \r\n  handbook to prevent the disciplinary procedure from being abused to eliminate \r\n  employees and to ensure that it would only be used to positively impact its \r\n  employees.Â  Nevertheless, reasonable minds could disagree as to whether Hospital \r\n  proceeded to act in reasonable good faith by using the disciplinary policy to \r\n  immediately terminate Baril for using the toll-free line to transfer one possibly \r\n  business-related telephone call to Barilâ€™s sister for thirty-two seconds.\r\nAdditionally, our Supreme Court has held that summary judgment should not ordinarily \r\n  be used to resolve the question of whether an employer acted under a reasonable \r\n  good faith belief that sufficient cause existed for termination.Â  Conner, \r\n  348 S.C. at 465, 560 S.E.2d at 611-612.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to Baril, we find that reasonable minds could differ as to whether \r\n  Hospital acted with good faith in terminating Baril.\r\n b.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sufficient Cause\r\nHospital alleges it followed its disciplinary policies in terminating Baril.Â  \r\n  Hospital contends Barilâ€™s request that her call on Hospitalâ€™s toll-free line \r\n  be transferred to her sisterâ€™s private residence constituted an act of â€œdishonesty, \r\n  fraud, theft (regardless of amount), unauthorized removal of hospital property.â€Â  \r\n  Thus, Hospital avers Baril demonstrated violation of a â€œcritical offenseâ€ meriting \r\n  immediate termination.\r\nHowever, Hospital never announced a policy against use of its toll-free telephone \r\n  line by employees for personal or private business, although the written materials \r\n  of Hospital purported to communicate policies and changes to Hospital employees.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Baril declared that other Hospital employees had engaged in similar \r\n  behavior without Hospitalâ€™s objection, thereby raising the possibility that \r\n  Hospital tacitly condoned the practice.Â  Assuming, arguendo, that Hospital \r\n  rightfully concluded such employee use of its toll-free telephone lines for \r\n  private purposes constituted dishonesty, fraud, or theft sufficient to merit \r\n  immediate termination under its policy, evidence exists that Barilâ€™s telephone \r\n  call to her sister originated in matters related to her employment at Hospital.\r\nMoreover, Hospital failed to produce any evidence that it suffered a loss related \r\n  to the telephone call.Â  In addition, Hospital rejected Barilâ€™s good-faith efforts \r\n  to compensate Hospital for any loss it may have sustained for the thirty-two \r\n  second call, although Hospitalâ€™s undisputed practice was to permit employees \r\n  to reimburse it for private long-distance telephone calls.\r\nThe Circuit Court determined â€œno evidence showed or even suggested that [Baril] \r\n  ever reimbursed or attempted to reimburse Hospital for any of these calls.â€Â  \r\n  A cursory reading of the record contradicts this finding.Â  First, the phrase \r\n  â€œany of these callsâ€ wrongly implies that Baril made more than one call, contrary \r\n  to undisputed evidence that she only made one call at issue.Â  Next, the record \r\n  is replete with testimony from Baril and Lowe that Baril immediately offered \r\n  to reimburse Hospital for any expenses related to the telephone call.\r\nHospital maintains Baril abused her authority by ordering a subordinate to \r\n  transfer the telephone call outside the Hospital.Â  Yet, the record contains \r\n  no evidence that Baril had any subordinates at the Hospital at the time she \r\n  placed the call.Â  In fact, the employee whom Baril asked to transfer the call \r\n  was only considered a subordinate by the trial court because she had previously \r\n  been one of Barilâ€™s nursing students.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to Baril, we conclude her actions constituted a mere peccadillo at \r\n  worst and that reasonable minds could differ concerning whether Hospital terminated \r\n  Baril with just cause.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mitigation of Damages\r\nBaril claims the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment because, \r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Baril as the nonmoving party, \r\n  material issues of fact exist concerning whether she made reasonable efforts \r\n  to mitigate her damages.Â  We agree.\r\nA party injured by the acts of another is required to do those things a person \r\n  of ordinary prudence would do under the circumstances, but the law does not \r\n  require him to exert himself unreasonably or incur substantial expense to avoid \r\n  damages.Â  McClary v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 291 S.C. 506, 354 S.E.2d \r\n  405 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Whether the party acted reasonably to mitigate damages \r\n  is ordinarily a question for the jury.Â  Id.\r\nBaril did not seek other employment throughout this litigation.Â  However, she \r\n  attempted to justify her behavior.Â  First, she testified she did not want to \r\n  reveal to potential employers that she had been fired. Â Second, she testified \r\n  that there were no other hospitals with emergency rooms in or near Aiken, where \r\n  she resided.Â  Thus, she would have been forced to either commute or relocate \r\n  in order to perform similar work.Â  Baril did not want to relocate because she \r\n  had a home and family in Aiken, where she taught college classes on a full-time \r\n  basis.Â  Baril speculated that a lengthy commute would interfere with \r\n  her teaching career.\r\nConsidering the evidence in the light most favorable to Baril, \r\n  reasonable minds could disagree over whether she made reasonable efforts to \r\n  mitigate her damages.Â  The trial court should have allowed this question to \r\n  be resolved by a jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n CONNOR and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n     John Arnoldâ€™s specific job title is unclear in the record, which \r\n    indicates he operated in a supervisory capacity similar to that of Martinez \r\n    de Andino.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] \r\n     Shortly before Martinez de Andino initiated the July 1998 disciplinary \r\n    action against Baril, a dispute arose between them concerning Martinez de \r\n    Andinoâ€™s decision to hire paramedics to perform nursing functions in the emergency \r\n    room.Â  Baril learned from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental \r\n    Control that South Carolina law prohibited paramedics from performing some \r\n    of the functions that Martinez de Andino intended for them to perform.Â  Baril \r\n    conveyed this information to Martinez de Andino, who told Baril to â€œdeal with \r\n    it.â€Â  Baril contends Martinez de Andino resented Barilâ€™s input, leading to \r\n    a souring of their relationship that motivated her to seek Barilâ€™s termination.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] \r\n     Baril and Hospital clearly disagree about the existence of a contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
