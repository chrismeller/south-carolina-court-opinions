Whitney, of Seneca; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this termination of parental \r\n  rights case, Diane Cannon Hardy and James Hardy (mother and stepfather) appeal \r\n  from an order of the family court denying their plea to terminate the parental \r\n  rights of John S. Gunter, Jr. (the father) to his two minor children.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe mother and father were married \r\n  in April 1988.Â  They have two children, Shane and Tyler, born on November 18, \r\n  1992 and March 1, 1995, respectively.Â  During the marriage, the father retired \r\n  as a major from the United States Air Force, having earned two masterâ€™s degrees \r\n  during his military service.\r\nThe mother and father separated \r\n  in June 1996.Â  During the same month, the father admitted himself to the Anderson \r\n  Area Medical Center Psychiatric Ward where he was diagnosed with depression \r\n  and drug addiction.\r\nThe parties were divorced by order of the family \r\n  court dated November 8, 1996.Â  Pursuant to the divorce decree, which embodied \r\n  the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement, the mother was granted full custody of the \r\n  children.Â  Visitation for the father was held in abeyance pending the fatherâ€™s \r\n  compliance with requirements that he obtain a psychological evaluation from \r\n  the Veteranâ€™s Administration (VA) and approval to visit the children from the \r\n  guardian ad litem.Â  The order specifically provided that â€œupon receipt of the \r\n  recommendation of the Guardian Ad Litem . . . the Court, without further hearing, \r\n  may review the same and adopt the recommendation . . . as the order of this \r\n  Court, however, either party may request a hearing on the visitation as recommended \r\n  within 30 days of the receipt of such recommendation.â€Â  Determination of the \r\n  fatherâ€™s child support obligation was held in abeyance.\r\nIn December 1996, the father began receiving disability \r\n  payments totaling $1,345 per month. [1] Â  Simultaneously, the partiesâ€™ children each began receiving \r\n  $212 monthly social security checks related to the fatherâ€™s disability status. \r\n  Â The father has made no additional support payments for the children.\r\nAfter the partiesâ€™ divorce, the \r\n  father moved to Florida in order to be near and assist his mother, who has been \r\n  diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and his father, who has been diagnosed with \r\n  congestive heart failure. Â In addition, the fatherâ€™s son from a former \r\n  marriage resides in Florida.\r\nAlthough the divorce degree specifically \r\n  directed that the fatherâ€™s psychological evaluation be conducted through the \r\n  VA and the father obtained two evaluations from the VA prior to the entry of \r\n  the divorce decree, the guardian ad litem desired a doctor independent from \r\n  the VA to do an evaluation.Â  The father consented to have the evaluation performed \r\n  by the doctor of the guardianâ€™s choosing.Â  The guardian arranged for Dr. Spurgeon \r\n  Cole to evaluate the father in her office on October 13, 1998.Â  The father arrived \r\n  at the guardianâ€™s office at the appointed time, but Dr. Cole did not appear.Â  \r\n  The father agreed to reschedule with Dr. Cole; however, at a December 8, 1998 \r\n  interview with the guardian, he declared his reluctance to be evaluated by a \r\n  psychologist whose base of operation was in Oconee County and expressed financial \r\n  concerns about having the evaluation carried out by a doctor not associated \r\n  with the VA. Â In August 1999, the father provided the guardian with the \r\n  notes from a third evaluation administered by Dr. Phillip Tate of the VA in \r\n  Florida.Â  The father testified that he â€œwas calling [the guardian] at least \r\n  once every couple weeks . . . to see what [he] could do to hasten the process.â€Â  \r\n  The father went on to state:Â  â€œI know Iâ€™ve made lots of phone calls to try to \r\n  make appointments, to have her call me.Â  Iâ€™ve left you know, many, many messages \r\n  and we . . . went through my phone log . . . and I think that she finally said \r\n  that, â€˜Yes, you know, you have been trying to get in touch with me.â€™â€Â  The guardian \r\n  admittedly received both the notes from the fatherâ€™s third evaluation and several \r\n  follow-up telephone calls from the father; however, the guardian never made \r\n  any proposal to the parties or the family court regarding the fatherâ€™s visitation \r\n  with the children.Â  The father has not visited with the children since the date \r\n  of the divorce order holding the issue of visitation in abeyance. \r\nThe mother and stepfather were married \r\n  in September 1997.Â  On December 9, 1999, they instituted the instant action \r\n  against the father, alleging the fatherâ€™s parental rights be terminated due \r\n  to willful failure to visit and/or support the children and seeking an order \r\n  of adoption establishing a parent/child relationship between the stepfather \r\n  and the minor children.Â  The mother and stepfatherâ€™s complaint also alleged \r\n  the fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated based on a diagnosable condition \r\n  (drug addiction and mental illness), which condition was not likely to change \r\n  within a reasonable time and rendered him unfit to provide minimally acceptable \r\n  care for the children; however, the mother and stepfather abandoned this ground \r\n  for termination at trial.Â  Proceeding pro se, the father answered the \r\n  complaint, denying the mother and stepfather were entitled to the requested \r\n  relief.\r\nBy order dated October 16, 2000, \r\n  the family court found the fatherâ€™s conduct following his separation and divorce \r\n  from the mother did not constitute willful failure to visit and support the \r\n  children.Â  Accordingly, the court denied the mother and stepfatherâ€™s petition \r\n  for termination of the fatherâ€™s parental rights and ordered the guardian ad \r\n  litem to enter a recommendation as to visitation between the father and children \r\n  within fifteen days of the order. Â The mother and stepfatherâ€™s post-trial \r\n  motion for reconsideration was denied without a hearing.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights case, the best \r\n  interests of the children are the paramount consideration.Â  South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc.

Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1998); Cummings, \r\n  345 S.C. at 293, 547 S.E.2d at 509.Â  â€œThis Court may review the record and make \r\n  its own findings whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination.â€Â  \r\n  Cummings, 345 S.C. at 293, 547 S.E.2d at 509; accord Parker, \r\n  336 S.C. at 254, 519 S.E.2d at 354; South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc.

App. 1988).Â Â  â€œOur \r\n  broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or \r\n  ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility \r\n  of the witnesses.â€Â  Cummings, 345 S.C. at 293, 547 S.E.2d at 509; accord \r\n  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996); Berry v. Ianuario, 286 S.C. 522, \r\n  525, 335 S.E.2d 250, 251 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n&nbsp; Our supreme court has held that a finding \r\n  of a willful failure to visit will not be predicated upon parental conduct that \r\n  can be reasonably explained.Â  Wilson v. Higgins, 294 S.C. 300, 305, 363 \r\n  S.E.2d 911, 914 (Ct. App. 1987), revâ€™d in part on other grounds, Joiner \r\n  ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000).Â  A finding \r\n  of willful failure to support will not be predicated upon parental conduct that \r\n  can be reasonably explained.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Failure to Support\r\nThe mother and stepfather claim the family court \r\n  erred in not finding the father willfully failed to support the children from \r\n  the time the parties separated in June 1996 until December 1996, and the failure, \r\n  if proven, should serve as a basis for termination of the fatherâ€™s parental \r\n  rights.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section \r\n  20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2001) provides for termination of parental rights upon a \r\n  finding that termination is in the best interest of the child and:\r\n\r\nThe child has lived outside the home of either parent for \r\n  a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed \r\n  to support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to \r\n  make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists \r\n  of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions \r\n  of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according \r\n  to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in \r\n  determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, \r\n  including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent \r\n  to provide support.\r\n\r\nWhether a parentâ€™s failure to support \r\n  a child is â€œwillfulâ€ within the meaning of section 20-7-1572 is a question of \r\n  intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.Â  Broome, \r\n  307 S.C. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838; South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Servs. \r\n  v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 336, 543 S.E.2d 580, 582 (Ct. App. 2001); Parker, \r\n  336 S.C. at 256, 519 S.E.2d at 355.Â  Generally, the family court is given wide \r\n  discretion in making this conclusion.Â  However, the element of willfulness must \r\n  be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Broome, 307 S.C. at \r\n  52, 413 S.E.2d at 838; Wilson, 344 S.C. at 336, 543 S.E.2d at 582; Parker, \r\n  336 S.C. at 256, 519 S.E.2d at 335. \r\nInitially, we note that the six month \r\n  time period prescribed in section 1572 did not elapse between June 1996, when \r\n  the partiesâ€™ separated, and December 1996, when the children began receiving \r\n  social security payments based on the fatherâ€™s disability status.Â  The evidence \r\n  is unchallenged that the father was in the process of applying for his social \r\n  security benefits during that time span and was in fact disabled during that \r\n  period, although the Social Security Administration had not declared him disabled.Â  \r\n  It is further undisputed that the childrenâ€™s social security benefits total \r\n  $424 per month, only $60 short of the amount of the fatherâ€™s support obligation \r\n  under the Child Support Guidelines.Â  Although the mother and stepfather correctly \r\n  note that the childrenâ€™s social security benefits are not deducted from the \r\n  fatherâ€™s benefits, we concur with the family court that the benefits are nonetheless \r\n  available to the children due to the fatherâ€™s disability status and the father \r\n  is deemed to have made a material contribution to their upkeep.Â  Moreover, we \r\n  agree with the family courtâ€™s holding that even though the father could be ordered \r\n  to contribute to child support in excess of the childrenâ€™s social security benefits, \r\n  the family court has not had occasion to rule on the issue because it was not \r\n  raised by any of the parties in this case.Â Â  \r\nUnder these facts and circumstances, we \r\n  find no error in the courtâ€™s conclusion that the fatherâ€™s failure to pay support \r\n  in addition to the childrenâ€™s social security benefits did not amount to a willful \r\n  failure to support the children.Â  \r\nII.Â  Failure to Visit\r\nThe mother and stepfather next assert \r\n  the family court erred in failing to determine the father willfully failed to \r\n  visit the children.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572(3) provides that parental rights \r\n  may be terminated if termination is in the best interest of the child and:\r\n\r\nThe child has lived outside the home of either parent for \r\n  a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed \r\n  to visit the child.Â  The court may attach little or no weight to incidental \r\n  visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting \r\n  by the party having custody or by court order.Â  The distance of the childâ€™s \r\n  placement from the parentâ€™s home must be taken into consideration when determining \r\n  the ability to visit.\r\n\r\nAs with failure to support, \r\n  a parentâ€™s â€œwillfulâ€ failure to visit a child within the meaning of section \r\n  20-7-1572 is a question of intent to be resolved by the facts and circumstances \r\n  of each case.Â  Broome, 307 S.C. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838; Wilson, \r\n  344 S.C. at 336, 543 S.E.2d at 582; Parker, 336 S.C. at 256, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  at 355.Â  Ordinarily, the family court has extensive discretion in making this \r\n  decision.Â  Yet, the requirement of willfulness must be established by clear \r\n  and convincing evidence.Â  Broome, 307 S.C. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838; \r\n  Wilson, 344 S.C. at 336, 543 S.E.2d at 582; Parker, 336 S.C. at \r\n  256, 519 S.E.2d at 335.\r\nIn the initial divorce decree, \r\n  the family court expressly held the issue of visitation in abeyance pending \r\n  the father obtaining a psychological evaluation from the VA and the guardian \r\n  providing the court with a recommendation as to visitation.Â  It is uncontested \r\n  the father obtained the evaluation by the VA in accordance with the order.Â  \r\n  Nonetheless, the guardian ad litem declined to make a recommendation because \r\n  she desired an independent evaluation.Â  Particularly in light of the fatherâ€™s \r\n  initial efforts to comply with the guardianâ€™s superfluous requirement that he \r\n  obtain a psychological evaluation from an â€œindependentâ€ doctor, we cannot conclude \r\n  the fatherâ€™s failure to ultimately obtain an evaluation from a doctor of the \r\n  guardianâ€™s choice amounted to either a failure to comply with the terms of the \r\n  courtâ€™s order or an election to forego his visitation with the children.Â  \r\nWe reject the mother and stepfatherâ€™s contention \r\n  that the fatherâ€™s failure to request a hearing on visitation despite the lack \r\n  of a recommendation from the guardian constituted an election not to visit the \r\n  children.Â  Under the express terms of the divorce decree, a request for a hearing \r\n  was not to be made until after the guardian submitted a proposal as to visitation.Â  \r\n  Significantly, the same family court judge who issued the divorce decree determined \r\n  in this action that â€œ[s]ince the Guardian made no recommendations, the [father] \r\n  correctly argues that no request for a hearing was authorized by the Order.â€\r\nThe case of Stefan v. Stefan, 320 S.C. 419, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 734 (Ct. App. 1995) is controlling and edifying in regard to the \r\n  issue of delegating judicial authority to a guardian to recommend the time for \r\n  visitation.Â  Stefan states:\r\n\r\nThe father argues the family court abused its discretion \r\n  by delegating judicial authority to the parenting specialist and the guardian, \r\n  and by authorizing the guardian to recommend the time for the resumption of \r\n  visitation, and modification of visitation.Â  We agree.\r\nIn the final analysis it is the family court which is \r\n  charged with the authority and responsibility for protecting the interest of \r\n  minors involved in litigation, not the guardian or any other person whom the \r\n  court may appoint to assist it.Â  While this court can appreciate the frustration \r\n  of the family court in devising a visitation plan for the husband, it was error \r\n  to delegate this responsibility to the guardian and the parenting specialist. \r\n  . . .\r\n. . . In her final order, the trial judge appointed a \r\n  guardian for the children and directed him to perform certain tasks and to make \r\n  recommendations prior to the husbandâ€™s visitation being resumed.Â  This was error.\r\n\r\nId. at 422-23, 465 S.E.2d at 736 (footnote \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nWe caution family court judges NOT \r\n  to delegate any responsibility to a guardian in regard to visitation \r\n  of children with parents.Â  We encourage the Family Court Bench and Bar to strictly \r\n  adhere to the holding in Stefan.\r\nBecause the father was effectively enjoined from \r\n  visiting the children even after he complied with the terms of the order, we \r\n  cannot rule that he willfully failed to visit the children during the time the \r\n  order was in effect.Â  \r\nThe mother and stepfather complain that the family \r\n  court erred in failing to consider the best interests of the children in determining \r\n  the fatherâ€™s parental rights should not be terminated.Â  We find no reversible \r\n  error.\r\nAlthough the family court order does not directly \r\n  address whether the childrenâ€™s interests would be best served by terminating \r\n  the fatherâ€™s parental rights, we note that section 20-7-1572 requires both a \r\n  finding as to the best interests of the child and proof of one or more \r\n  of the enumerated statutory grounds before termination may be ordered.Â  Inasmuch \r\n  as the mother and stepfather failed to establish the requisite statutory grounds \r\n  for termination, any error on the family courtâ€™s part in not expressly ruling \r\n  on the best interests of the children is of little consequence to the propriety \r\n  of the courtâ€™s order.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe take this opportunity to remind the Bench and \r\n  Bar that we disapprove of the length of time from the issuance of the Order, \r\n  dated November 8, 1996, and the response by the guardian and court on October \r\n  16, 2000.Â  Children should not be held in limbo for an inordinate period of \r\n  time.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  The fatherâ€™s disabilities include degenerative joint disease, nine \r\n    knee surgeries, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity \r\n    disorder, and peripheral nerve damage stemming from his participation in Desert \r\n    Storm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3597","title":"Anderson v.

During the campaign, two hurricanes \r\n  hit the coast of North Carolina; Anderson, a claims adjuster specializing in \r\n  natural disasters, traveled to North Carolina to process insurance claims. As \r\n  a result, Anderson was out of the state for ten weeks of the election season. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe next year, following redistricting, Anderson prepared \r\n  to run again in a special election for the same House seat. Chad Bray, a reporter \r\n  for The Chronicle, phoned Anderson twice to discuss the previous campaign. \r\n  On April 6, 1997, The Chronicle published an article by Bray concerning \r\n  the special election and stating in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Democrats [sic] best hope -- other than Mr. Clyburn \r\n    -- may be Tom Anderson. He's expected to seek a rematch against state Rep. \r\n    Roland Smith, R-Langley, Mr. Brown said. \r\n\r\n  Mr. Anderson took 32 percent of the vote in District 84 \r\n    when he ran against Mr. Smith in 1996, even though he was out of the area \r\n    with the National Guard during the final weeks of the election. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt some point thereafter, Anderson announced his candidacy \r\n  and again spoke with Bray by phone. According to Anderson, the subject of his \r\n  absence during the 1996 campaign did not come up during the call. On June 3, \r\n  The Chronicle published another article by Bray about the special election. \r\n  In pertinent part, the article stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mr. Anderson, a Bath property appraiser, said he felt cheated \r\n    after being called away for National Guard duty in the last month before the \r\n    1996 general election. Mr. Smith eventually won with 67 percent of the vote \r\n    to Mr. Anderson's 33 percent. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson, who asserts he never told Bray he worked with \r\n  the National Guard, did not contact The Chronicle following publication \r\n  of either article to request a retraction or correction.\r\n\r\nThe following September, John Boyette, The Chronicle's \r\n  Aiken Bureau Chief, contacted Anderson and asked if he was planning to withdraw \r\n  from the race since he had been \"proven\" a liar for stating he was working for \r\n  the National Guard in 1996. Anderson told Boyette Bray must have misunderstood \r\n  when he said he had worked for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), \r\n  an insurance adjuster program operated under the auspices of the Federal Emergency \r\n  Management Agency (FEMA). The Chronicle published Boyette's article, \r\n  headlined \"GOP wants Anderson out of House race,\" on September 18. The subheading \r\n  read: \"Clearwater Democratic candidate is accused of lying about his National \r\n  Guard service.\" This article stated in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The South Carolina Republican Party called for Tom Anderson \r\n    to drop out of the House District 84 race Wednesday, charging that the Clearwater \r\n    Democrat lied about service in the National Guard.\r\n\r\n  The South Carolina National Guard has no record of Mr. Anderson's \r\n    ever serving, said Trey Walker, state GOP executive director. In a faxed statement, \r\n    Mr. Walker said Mr. Anderson \"should immediately dishonorably discharge himself \r\n    from the race.\" \r\n\r\n  The Augusta Chronicle  reported in June that \r\n    Mr. Anderson said he felt cheated after being called away for National Guard \r\n    duty in the last month before the 1996 general election . . . . \r\n\r\n  Mr. Anderson, however, denied Wednesday that he ever told \r\n    The Chronicle that he had served in the National Guard. Instead, \r\n    he said, he spent more than two months in North Carolina doing damage appraisals \r\n    for the National Flood Insurance Group after two hurricanes hit the coast.\r\n\r\n  Last fall, National Guard units were called on to assist \r\n    victims of Hurricane Fran in eastern North Carolina.\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  Mr. Anderson was drafted into the Army, served in the Korean \r\n    War and, after a two-year stint in Europe, was discharged in 1956. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe same day, an article appeared in the Aiken Standard \r\n  with the headline, \"Democrat responds to 'misinformation.'\" This article, by \r\n  senior writer Carl Langley, recorded Anderson's denunciation of The Chronicle's \r\n  allegations and quoted him as saying: \"I've never been in the National Guard, \r\n  and would have been a fool to make such a statement.\" The article continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Anderson missed several weeks of the last campaign by working \r\n    on insurance claims generated from Hurricane Fran in North Carolina. \r\n\r\n  \"I was gone on two occasions during the 1996 campaign, and \r\n    a lot of the insurance (claims) we worked on involved the National Flood Insurance \r\n    Program,\" said Anderson. \r\n\r\n  He speculated that the reporter for an Augusta newspaper \r\n    couldn't tell the difference between the national flood insurance program \r\n    and the National Guard. \r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  Anderson said he told the reporter that during the last \r\n    election he had to go to North Carolina in July and again in September and \r\n    October to work on the insurance claims. \r\n\r\n\r\nOther local papers also published articles concerning the \r\n  controversy. \r\n\r\nOn September 26, Anderson received a telephone call from \r\n  Pat Willis. Willis told Anderson she was working on an article for The Chronicle \r\n  and requested proof that he was a government-approved insurance adjuster and \r\n  that he had worked in North Carolina in 1996. Anderson subsequently faxed Willis \r\n  several documents, including a letter on FEMA/NFIP stationery approving his \r\n  application for NFIP certified adjuster status.\r\n\r\nDespite this information, on October 1 The Chronicle \r\n  published an editorial with the headline \"Let the liar run.\" Written by Phil \r\n  Kent, The Chronicle's editorial page editor, the piece stated in full:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Clearwater Democrat Tom Anderson, running in November's \r\n    court-ordered special election for South Carolina's House District 84 seat, \r\n    has been exposed as a liar. \r\n\r\n  He told this newspaper he was called away to National Guard \r\n    duty in the last weeks of the 1996 election, his first race against incumbent \r\n    state Rep. Roland Smith, R-Langley. (Anderson lost by a decisive margin.) \r\n    \r\n\r\n  It turns out, however, the state Guard has no record of \r\n    Anderson ever serving -- either then or any other time. \r\n\r\n  State GOP director Trey Walker, saying Anderson has dishonored \r\n    himself and the National Guard, demands that the Democrat withdraw from the \r\n    race. Walker's right about the dishonor, but what about the withdrawal? \r\n\r\n  If Anderson is the best Democrats can come up with, they \r\n    still have every right to run him. There's nothing in the election rules that \r\n    says a political party can't nominate for public office a candidate who, in \r\n    effect, lies on his resume. \r\n\r\n  We are confident that an informed electorate won't vote \r\n    into office a proven prevaricator. After all, he doesn't even have the long \r\n    robes of one of Al Gore's Buddhist monks to hide behind! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning following publication, Anderson tried to reach \r\n  Kent to demand a retraction or clarification. After several attempts, Anderson \r\n  eventually spoke with a woman named Tara in The Chronicle's editorial \r\n  department. (1) Tara informed Anderson that Kent \r\n  \"wouldn't talk\" to him, but stated that if Anderson faxed a rebuttal letter \r\n  it would be printed. In the meantime, Republican Party officials mailed copies \r\n  of the editorial to district voters. \r\n\r\nThe Chronicle subsequently printed a \"Clarification\" on October 29:  \r\n\r\n\r\nTom Anderson, Democratic candidate in this year's special election for the\r\nSouth Carolina House District 84 seat, said he was called away from the\r\nAiken area just before the 1996 election for the post to work for the\r\nNational Flood Insurance Program.  Mr. Anderson also said he was\r\nmisquoted in [the] June 2 story in The Augusta Chronicle.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe paper also published Anderson's response as a Letter to the Editor on\r\nNovember 2. \r\n\r\nAnderson ultimately filed a complaint for libel, amended March 8, 1999,\r\nalleging The Chronicle published false statements in Kent's editorial dated\r\nOctober 1, 1997.  At a trial held October 11, 1999, The Chronicle moved\r\nfor a directed verdict at the close of Anderson's case.  The trial court orally\r\ngranted the motion on October 12, finding Anderson failed to show\r\nconstitutional malice, and thereafter filed a form order judgment.  This\r\nappeal followed.  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nWhen deciding a motion for a directed verdict, the trial \r\n  court \"must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most \r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.\" Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm \r\n  Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999); see Bell \r\n  v. Evening Post Pub. Co., \r\n\r\n318 S.C. 558, 459 S.E.2d 315 (Ct. App. 1995). If the evidence \r\n  presented yields only one inference such that the trial court may decide the \r\n  issue as a matter of law, the decision to grant the motion is proper. See \r\n  Swinton, 334 S.C. at 476, 514 S.E.2d at 130. On the other hand, a directed \r\n  verdict motion on liability for libel is properly denied where evidence exists \r\n  justifying submitting the issue to the jury. See Holtzscheiter v. \r\n  Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 513, 506 S.E.2d 497, 503 (1998). \r\n\r\n\r\nWhether a plaintiff has presented evidence sufficient to \r\n  constitute actual malice is, in the first instance, a question of law for the \r\n  trial court. See Elder v. Gaffney Ledger, 341 S.C. 108, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  899 (2000); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 254 (1986) \r\n  (\"When determining if . . . actual malice exists in a libel suit brought by \r\n  a public figure, a trial judge must bear in mind the actual quantum and quality \r\n  of proof necessary to support liability under New York Times.\"); Bose \r\n  Corp. v. Consumers Union, 466 U.S. 485, 511 (1984) (\"Judges, as expositors \r\n  of the Constitution, must independently decide whether the evidence in the record \r\n  is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any \r\n  judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of 'actual malice.'\"). \r\n  Similarly, the appellate court is obliged to independently examine the entire \r\n  record on appeal and decide, de novo, whether the evidence presented \r\n  below is of sufficient quantity and character to sustain a finding of actual \r\n  malice. See Elder, 341 S.C. at 113-114, 533 S.E.2d at 902; Miller \r\n  v. City of West Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 471 S.E.2d 683 (1996); see also \r\n  Bose, 466 U.S. at 512 (\"Appellate judges . . . must exercise independent \r\n  judgment and determine whether the [entire] record establishes actual malice \r\n  with convincing clarity.\"). In all cases the court must ask \"whether the evidence \r\n  in the record could support a reasonable jury finding either that the plaintiff \r\n  has shown actual malice by clear and convincing evidence or that the plaintiff \r\n  has not.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255-56.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThe tort of defamation exists to redress injury to the plaintiff's \r\n  reputation arising from the defendant's publication of a false and defamatory \r\n  statement. See Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 508, 506 S.E.2d at 501; \r\n  Swinton, 334 S.C. at 484, 514 S.E.2d at 133. Proof of the tort requires \r\n  the plaintiff to show the defendant was at fault in publishing a false and defamatory \r\n  statement concerning him to a third party that either caused him special harm \r\n  or was actionable irrespective of harm. See Fleming v. Rose, Op. \r\n  No. 25500 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 22, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 25); Boone \r\n  v. Sunbelt Newspapers, Inc., 347 S.C. 571, 556 S.E.2d 732 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nAlthough defamation is substantively a matter of our state \r\n  common law, the federal Constitution \"may reshape the common-law landscape to \r\n  conform to the First Amendment.\" Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, \r\n  475 U.S. 767, 775 (1986). Thus, when a public figure or official \r\n  (2) claims defamation by speech of public concern, the Constitution \r\n  requires him \"to surmount a much higher barrier before recovering damages from \r\n  a media defendant than is raised by the common law.\" Id.; see \r\n  Beckham v. Sun News, 289 S.C. 28, 30, 344 S.E.2d 603, 604 (1986) (\"[I]n \r\n  libel actions brought by public officials and public figures the traditional \r\n  burdens of proof are necessarily altered by the constitutional protections afforded \r\n  the press.\"). Part of this \"higher barrier\" is the degree of fault by the publisher \r\n  that the plaintiff must prove. See Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. \r\n  153, 171-72 (1979) (\"[S]ome error is inevitable; and the difficulties of separating \r\n  fact from fiction convinced the Court . . . to limit liability to instances \r\n  where some degree of culpability is present in order to eliminate the risk of \r\n  undue self-censorship and the suppression of truthful material.\"); see also \r\n  Fleming, Op. No. 25500 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 22, 2002) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 25 at 35); Beckham, 289 S.C. at 30, 344 S.E.2d at 604. \r\n\r\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) \r\n  and its progeny prescribe the requisite fault to be proved by a public figure. \r\n  Under this standard, the plaintiff must show an allegedly libelous statement \r\n  was published with \"actual malice.\" Id. at 279-280; see George \r\n  v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001); Elder, 341 S.C. at \r\n  113, 533 S.E.2d at 901. Proof of actual malice requires the plaintiff to demonstrate, \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence, that the publisher made the statements either \r\n  knowingly or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. George, 345 \r\n  S.C. at 456, 548 S.E.2d at 876; Elder, 341 S.C. at 114, 533 S.E.2d at \r\n  902. Clear and convincing evidence may be defined as \"'that degree of proof \r\n  which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief as to the \r\n  allegations sought to be established.'\" Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting, Inc., \r\n  324 S.C. 261, 269 n.4, 478 S.E.2d 282, 286 n.4 (1996) (citation omitted). It \r\n  is an intermediate measure of proof, i.e., \"'more than a mere preponderance \r\n  but less than is required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it does not mean \r\n  clear and unequivocal.'\" Id. \r\n\r\nActual malice is \"a subjective standard which tests \r\n  the defendant's good faith belief in the truth of [its] statements.\" George, \r\n  345 S.C. at 456, 548 S.E.2d at 876; see Peeler, 324 S.C. at 266, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d at 284. Hence, absent proof of a knowing falsehood, the plaintiff must \r\n  establish a defendant \"'in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of \r\n  his publication'\" or possessed a \"'high degree of awareness'\" of probable falsity. \r\n  George, 345 S.C. at 456, 548 S.E.2d at 876 (citations omitted); see \r\n  Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 512-13, 506 S.E.2d at 503 (proving constitutional \r\n  actual malice requires a showing that the publisher either \"realized the statement \r\n  was false\" or \"had serious reservations about its truth\"). Recklessness presupposes \r\n  \"an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily \r\n  adhered to by responsible publishers.\" Peeler, 324 S.C. at 266, 478 S.E.2d \r\n  at 284. \r\n\r\nWithout question, \"'public discussion of the qualifications \r\n  of a candidate for elective office presents what is probably the strongest possible \r\n  case for application of the New York Times rule.'\" George, 345 S.C. at \r\n  454, 548 S.E.2d at 875 (quoting Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, \r\n  491 U.S. 657, 686 (1989)); see Patriot Monitor Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, \r\n  271-72 (1971) (\"[If] the First Amendment was 'fashioned to assure the unfettered \r\n  interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes \r\n  desired by the people,' then it can hardly be doubted that the constitutional \r\n  guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct \r\n  of campaigns for political office.\") (internal citation omitted). Indeed, the \r\n  actual malice standard \"is premised on our 'profound national commitment to \r\n  the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and \r\n  wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly \r\n  sharp attacks on government and public officials.'\" George, 345 S.C. \r\n  at 456-57, 548 S.E.2d at 876 (quoting New York Times, 376 U.S. at 270). \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe First Amendment, however, does not afford defamatory \r\n  political speech absolute immunity. See id.  at 455, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  at 876; Stevens v. Sun Publ'g Co., 270 S.C. 65, 71, 240 S.E.2d 812, 815 \r\n  (1978) (\"An individual's status as a public figure does not immunize a publisher \r\n  from liability when it prints defamatory articles with malice.\"); Harte-Hanks \r\n  Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 688 (1989) (\"We have \r\n  not gone so far . . . as to accord the press absolute immunity in its coverage \r\n  of public figures or elections.\"). As the Supreme Court has stated: \r\n\r\n\r\n  That speech is used as a tool for political ends does \r\n    not automatically bring it under the protective mantle of the Constitution. \r\n    For the use of the known lie as a tool is at once at odds with the premises \r\n    of democratic government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, \r\n    or political change is to be effected. Calculated falsehood falls into that \r\n    class of utterances which \"are no essential part of any exposition of ideas \r\n    . . . .\" Hence the knowingly false statement and the false statement made \r\n    with reckless disregard of the truth[] do not enjoy constitutional protection. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nGarrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 75 (1964) (citation \r\n  omitted); see Curtis Publ'g Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 150 (1967) \r\n  (\"[T]hat dissemination of information and opinion on questions of public concern \r\n  is ordinarily a legitimate, protected and indeed cherished activity does not \r\n  mean . . . that one may in all respects carry on that activity exempt from sanctions \r\n  designed to safeguard the legitimate interests of others.\"). \r\n\r\nThe sole basis of the trial court's decision to direct a \r\n  verdict in The Chronicle's favor, and the only question before this \r\n  Court, is whether Anderson presented sufficient evidence to create a jury question \r\n  on the constitutional malice element of defamation. We therefore assume for \r\n  purposes of this opinion that The Chronicle published \"Let the liar \r\n  run\" and that it contained false and defamatory statements. See George, \r\n  345 S.C. at 456 n.7, 548 S.E.2d at 876 n.7 (\"Because summary judgment was granted \r\n  solely on the issue of actual malice, we assume arguendo that the statements \r\n  were false and defamatory.\"). Moreover, since \"[c]redibility determinations, \r\n  the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from \r\n  the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether he is ruling on \r\n  a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict,\" the evidence presented \r\n  by Anderson \"is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn \r\n  in his favor.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986); \r\n  see Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 520 (1991) \r\n  (&quot;[W]e must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, \r\n  including questions of credibility and of the weight to be accorded particular \r\n  evidence.\"). \r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, it is important to recognize the presumptively \r\n  false and defamatory statements contained in \"Let the liar run\" may constitute \r\n  libel in two separate ways. First, the statement that Anderson \"told this newspaper \r\n  he was called away to National Guard duty in the last weeks of the 1996 election\" \r\n  could cause injury by attributing to Anderson a statement of fact he did not \r\n  make. See Masson, 501 U.S. at 511 (\"A fabricated quotation may \r\n  injure reputation . . . [and] giv[e] rise to a conceivable claim of defamation \r\n  . . . because it attributes an untrue factual assertion to the speaker.\"); White \r\n  v. Wilkerson, 328 S.C. 179, 184, 493 S.E.2d 345, 347 (1997) (holding a statement \r\n  is defamatory \"if the words used . . . convey to the minds of those to whom \r\n  they are addressed . . . the impression that the plaintiff has done wrong\" when \r\n  considered in the context of the entire publication) (internal citation omitted). \r\n  Such a statement is defamatory per quod, because its defamatory meaning \r\n  is derived from facts extrinsic to the statement itself, in this case Anderson's \r\n  denial that he ever said what the editorial claims. See Holtzscheiter, \r\n  332 S.C. at 509, 506 S.E.2d at 501 (\"If the defamatory meaning is not clear \r\n  unless the hearer knows facts or circumstances not contained in the statement \r\n  itself, then the statement is defamatory per quod.\"). \r\n\r\nSecond, the statements that Anderson \"has been exposed as \r\n  a liar,\" is a \"proven prevaricator,\" and effectively \"lies on his resume\" are \r\n  actionable in their own right as being defamatory per se. See \r\n  id. at 508-09, 506 S.E.2d at 501 (\"The defamatory meaning of a message \r\n  or statement may be obvious on the face of the statement, in which case the \r\n  statement is defamatory per se.\"). Thus, we must look to each potential \r\n  libel and determine if Anderson presented sufficient evidence to permit us to \r\n  conclude a reasonable jury could have found The Chronicle acted with \r\n  actual malice in publishing the statements. Viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to Anderson, the evidence reveals the following. \r\n\r\nAnderson denies he ever told Chad Bray or anyone at The \r\n  Chronicle that he left his district during the 1996 general election to \r\n  serve in the National Guard, and we must presume his denial is correct. See \r\n  Masson, 501 U.S. at 520-21 (\"[W]e must assume . . . petitioner is correct \r\n  in denying that he made the statements attributed to him . . . . [Author] contests \r\n  petitioner's allegations, and only a trial on the merits will resolve the factual \r\n  dispute.\"). Instead, Anderson asserts that in a telephone interview in the spring \r\n  of 1997, he told Bray he had been out of the area working for various insurance \r\n  companies. When Bray, who appeared unfamiliar with the property insurance industry, \r\n  asked him to describe what a property company does and to name one, Anderson \r\n  recounted several, including the National Flood Insurance Program. According \r\n  to Anderson, Bray confused this reference to National Flood with the \r\n  National Guard. \r\n\r\nAfter two brief mentions of Anderson and the National Guard \r\n  in articles written by Bray the previous April and June, on September 17, 1997, \r\n  The Chronicle's John Boyette telephoned Anderson and inquired if he \r\n  was planning to withdraw from the special election race because he had lied \r\n  about being in the National Guard. Anderson contends he gave Boyette \"the facts\" \r\n  at this time, i.e., that he had been working for various insurance companies \r\n  in North Carolina, not the National Guard, and we assume Anderson's version \r\n  of this telephone conversation is accurate. See id. \r\n\r\nDespite Anderson's express disavowal, Boyette authored the \r\n  September 18 article in which he repeated the National Guard statement along \r\n  with Anderson's denial and explanation for his absence, and The Chronicle, \r\n  now obviously aware of the denial, published Kent's editorial on October 1. \r\n  (3) Although The Chronicle subsequently printed a \"Clarification\" \r\n  and Anderson's Letter to the Editor, the paper never retracted its assertion \r\n  that Anderson had claimed to be in the National Guard or its conclusion that \r\n  he was a liar.  \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has held that the \"deliberate alteration \r\n  of the words uttered by a plaintiff does not equate with knowledge of falsity \r\n  for purposes of [actual malice], unless the alteration results in a material \r\n  change in the meaning conveyed by the statement.\" Masson, 501 U.S. at \r\n  517 (internal citations omitted). Anderson, however, does not contend Bray intentionally \r\n  altered his statement concerning National Flood. Instead, Anderson argues he \r\n  carried his burden on actual malice by showing The Chronicle knew of \r\n  the alleged inaccuracy and chose to ignore it. \r\n\r\nIn conducting our independent examination of the record, \r\n  we concentrate on evidence of The Chronicle's \"conduct and state of \r\n  mind.\" Herbert, 441 U.S. at 160; see Butts, 388 U.S. at \r\n  152-53 (\"[New York Times] makes clear . . . that neither the interests \r\n  of the publisher nor those of society necessarily preclude a damage award based \r\n  on improper conduct which creates a false publication. It is the conduct element, \r\n  therefore, on which we must principally focus . . . .\"). \r\n\r\nThe law of libel recognizes the subjective nature of a media \r\n  defendant's intent may be very difficult to prove. Because a plaintiff \"will \r\n  rarely be successful in proving awareness of falsehood from the mouth of the \r\n  defendant himself,\" any direct or indirect evidence relevant to the defendant's \r\n  state of mind is admissible to demonstrate actual malice. Herbert, 441 \r\n  U.S. at 170; see Harte-Hanks, 491 U.S. at 668 (\"[A] plaintiff \r\n  is entitled to prove the defendant's state of mind through circumstantial evidence \r\n  . . . .\") (internal citations omitted); Zerangue v. TSP Newspapers, Inc., \r\n  814 F.2d 1066, 1070 (1987) (\"Although the defendant's state of mind is a subjective \r\n  fact, it can be shown by indirect or circumstantial evidence.\"). Moreover, since \r\n  \"[t]he finder of fact must determine whether the publication was indeed made \r\n  in good faith,\" a plaintiff's presentation of competent circumstantial evidence \r\n  of bad faith may establish actual malice despite a defendant's claim that a \r\n  publication was made \"with a belief that the statements were true.\" St. Amant \r\n  v.  Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 732 (1968); see McFarlane v. Sheridan \r\n  Square Press, Inc., 91 F.3d 1501, 1510 (recognizing a plaintiff is \"entitled \r\n  to an aggregate consideration\" of evidence of actual malice\"); Tavoulareas \r\n  v. Piro, 817 F.2d 762, 789 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (\"[A] plaintiff may prove the \r\n  defendant's subjective state of mind through the cumulation of circumstantial \r\n  evidence.\"); Zerangue, 814 F.2d at 1070 (stating sufficient indirect \r\n  evidence of actual malice can negate a defendant's assertion that he acted in \r\n  good faith). \r\n\r\n\"Reckless disregard\" is a term of art that \"cannot be fully \r\n  encompassed in one infallible definition.\" St. Amant, 390 U.S. at 730. \r\n  To the contrary, the recklessness standard is formed as case law evolves. Id.; \r\n  see Harte-Hanks, 491 U.S. at 686 (\"[O]nly through the course of \r\n  case-by-case adjudication can we give content to these otherwise elusive constitutional \r\n  standards.\"). Hence, beginning with New York Times, where the plaintiff's \r\n  case was unsuccessful because \"the record failed to show that the publisher \r\n  was aware of the likelihood that he was circulating false information,\" St. \r\n  Amant, 390 U.S. at 731, the Supreme Court has continually refined the standard's \r\n  parameters to guide the state and lower federal courts in making independent \r\n  determinations on actual malice. \r\n\r\nAlthough a publisher's \"[f]ailure to investigate does not \r\n  in itself establish bad faith,\" id. at 733, the Court has articulated \r\n  several instances where recklessness might be shown. One of these is \"where \r\n  there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of [an] informant or the \r\n  accuracy of his reports.\" St. Amant, 390 U.S. at 732-33 (emphasis \r\n  added); see Herbert, 441 U.S. at 156 (stating a court may find \r\n  \"'subjective awareness of probable falsity'\" if \"'there are obvious reasons \r\n  to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.'\") (citations \r\n  omitted); Harte-Hanks, 491 U.S. at 688 (same). \r\n\r\nWhile we recognize the opinions in St. Amant, Herbert, \r\n  and Harte-Hanks were referring to a publisher's outside source, we see \r\n  no legitimate reason why the analysis would not apply with equal force to a \r\n  newspaper's own reporter, particularly when the evidence points to a mistake \r\n  or misunderstanding between the reporter and his interview subject. In fact, \r\n  in considering the Masson case on remand from the Supreme Court, the \r\n  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals so held. See Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, \r\n  Inc., 960 F.2d 896, 900 (9th Cir. 1992) (stating where direct proof of a \r\n  publisher's actual state of mind is missing, the jury may nevertheless infer \r\n  awareness of falsity if it finds circumstances which \"gave the publisher 'obvious \r\n  reasons to doubt'\" the \"accuracy of facts and quotations\" in an author's article \r\n  and the publisher \"failed to take reasonable steps to dispel those doubts\"); \r\n  see also Speer v. Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., 828 F.2d 475, 477 \r\n  (8th Cir. 1987) (treating reporter who supplied false information but had no \r\n  input into defamatory editorial as \"outside source\" for purposes of actual malice \r\n  determination based on the newspaper's alleged recklessness). Similarly, our \r\n  supreme court has declared that \"actual malice may be present where the defendant \r\n  fails to investigate and there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity \r\n  of the statement or informant.\" George, 345 S.C. at 459, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d at 878 (additional emphasis added); see Zerangue, 814 F.2d \r\n  at 1070 (&quot;[C]ourts have upheld findings of actual malice when a defendant \r\n  failed to investigate a story weakened by . . . apparently reliable contrary \r\n  information.\"). (4) In our view, the facts of \r\n  this case amply demonstrate \"obvious reasons to doubt\" the truth of the National \r\n  Guard statement reported by Bray. \r\n\r\nTo begin, The Chronicle unquestionably knew Anderson \r\n  disputed Bray's version of their conversation, (5) \r\n  as it had published Boyette's article containing an express denial less than \r\n  two weeks before \"Let the liar run.\" Indeed, The Chronicle's primary \r\n  argument before the trial court and now as respondent is that Anderson cannot \r\n  show actual malice because Kent, as editor, simply chose to believe Bray rather \r\n  than Anderson. But unlike Speer, supra, this was not a case of \r\n  a publisher's failure to guess accurately among conflicting accounts of a perceived \r\n  event. In Speer, the court found no clear and convincing evidence of \r\n  actual malice when a newspaper failed to investigate a reporter's information \r\n  that had been disputed by others because the editorial staff \"already knew both \r\n  versions\" of the incident and \"at least two eyewitnesses had corroborated [the \r\n  reporter's] version.\" Speer, 828 F.2d at 478. Here, however, Kent never \r\n  spoke with Anderson to obtain his side of the story. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, our supreme court's decision in Peeler, \r\n  supra, is similarly unavailing. The Peeler court ruled that subjective \r\n  awareness of probable falsity is not shown with convincing clarity by evidence \r\n  indicating a publisher and plaintiff \"disagreed with respect to their perceptions \r\n  of events which they both observed.\" Peeler, 324 S.C. at 266-67, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d at 285. As The Chronicle recognizes, though neither Peeler \r\n  nor the Wyoming opinion quoted therein so states, this language effectively \r\n  recites the \"rational interpretation\" doctrine outlined by the Supreme Court \r\n  in Time, Inc. v. Pape, 401 U.S. 279 (1971), and Bose, supra. These cases \r\n  held that where a publisher chooses \"one of a number of possible rational interpretations\" \r\n  of an event \"bristl[ing] with ambiguities,\" the choice, even if it reflects \r\n  a misconception, is protected under the First Amendment. Pape, 401 U.S. \r\n  at 290; Bose, 466 U.S. at 512. The Chronicle contends that because \r\n  Kent \"was presented in the preceding articles with a rational account of what \r\n  [Anderson] said to Bray and why he said what he did,\" Anderson cannot establish \r\n  actual malice. \r\n\r\nMasson, however, explicitly rejected \"rational interpretation\" \r\n  protection for defamatory statements in the context of alleged misquotations. \r\n  See Masson, 501 U.S. at 518. There, the Court unequivocally stated \r\n  that \"[t]he protection for rational interpretation serves First Amendment principles \r\n  by allowing an author the interpretive license that is necessary when relying \r\n  upon ambiguous sources.\" Id. at 519 (emphasis added). As the \r\n  Court noted: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Were we to assess quotations under a rational interpretation \r\n    standard, we would give journalists the freedom to place statements in their \r\n    subjects' mouths without fear of liability. . . . Not only public figures \r\n    but the press doubtless would suffer under such a rule. Newsworthy figures \r\n    might become more wary of journalists, knowing that any comment could be transmuted \r\n    and attributed to the subject, so long as some bounds of rational interpretation \r\n    were not exceeded. We would ill serve the values of the First Amendment if \r\n    we were to grant near absolute, constitutional protection for such a practice. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nId.  at 520. As in Masson, the significance \r\n  of The Chronicle's unqualified statement that Anderson \"told this newspaper\" \r\n  he was in the National Guard is to inform the reader he is reading Anderson's \r\n  statement, not The Chronicle's \"rational interpretation of what [Anderson] \r\n  said or thought.\" Id. at 519-20. We therefore reject The Chronicle's \r\n  contention that any part of \"Let the liar run\" is protected under the doctrine \r\n  of \"rational interpretation.\"  (6)  \r\n\r\nTurning to the evidence at hand, the record reflects that \r\n  in addition to Anderson's emphatic denial that he ever claimed to be in the \r\n  National Guard, The Chronicle knew Anderson thought Bray had confused \r\n  National Flood with National Guard. Anderson testified he told John Boyette \r\n  he had been in North Carolina working for various insurance companies. Boyette's \r\n  September 18 article confirms this, referencing not only Anderson's denial but \r\n  also his assertion that he actually said he spent two months working in North \r\n  Carolina for National Flood. According to Anderson's testimony, he contacted \r\n  The Chronicle to dispute Boyette's article and was under the impression \r\n  Boyette had the situation \"covered\" and \"put to rest.\" \r\n\r\nHowever, on September 26 Anderson received a call from The \r\n  Chronicle's Pat Willis, who said she was working on an article about candidates \r\n  in the upcoming special election. Anderson testified Willis specifically asked \r\n  him for proof that he was a federally-approved insurance adjuster and that he \r\n  had worked in North Carolina the year before. In response, Anderson faxed Willis \r\n  seven pages of information along with a cover sheet which read: \r\n\r\n\r\n  To: Pat Willis\r\n\r\n  Fr: Tom Anderson\r\n\r\n   National Flood info to follow - Proves I am certified to \r\n    handle their claims - Ask John to have retraction run prior to 11-4-97. \r\n\r\n  NFIP Info - 3 pages\r\n\r\n  Resume - 2 pages\r\n\r\n  [E]lection info - 2 pages \r\n\r\n  8 pages\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transmission included a letter from the supervisor of \r\n  the NFIP's claims field operations, dated September 11, 1996 and addressed to \r\n  Anderson on National Flood Insurance Program stationery, that stated in part: \r\n  \"We are pleased to advise you that your application for NFIP Adjuster Certification \r\n  has been approved.\" (7) As indicated on the cover \r\n  sheet, Anderson also faxed a resume he prepared and used during his campaign \r\n  for House Seat 84.  (8)   \r\n\r\n Replete with references to his work in flood insurance \r\n  and related matters, the resume noted Anderson had been 1) commended for supervising \r\n  flood restoration projects in four states; 2) responsible for \"approximately \r\n  200 contractors, workmen and damage assessors in efforts to house 4500 flood \r\n  inundated families\"; 3) a program chief in Johnstown, Pennsylvania following \r\n  a destructive flood; 4) a contract coordinator in Los Angeles after mudslides \r\n  in 1979; 5) a work supervisor following flooding in Winslow, Arizona; and 6) \r\n  an appraiser of \"property damage for various insurance companies and government \r\n  agencies following hurricanes Andrew, Hugo, Alicia, Freddie, Camille, [and] \r\n  Betsy. . . .\" Thus, Anderson not only directly contradicted Bray's initial reports \r\n  in The Chronicle, he furnished the newspaper, at its request, \r\n  with documentary evidence to support his denial. \r\n\r\n Although Anderson's age was not listed on the resume, it \r\n  did refer to his military service in the Korean War. Boyette's article also \r\n  stated Anderson \"was drafted into the Army, served in the Korean War and, after \r\n  a two-year stint in Europe, was discharged in 1956.\" Because military records \r\n  are public and easily verifiable, we believe a jury could have concluded The \r\n  Chronicle, in full possession of this information, should have realized \r\n  Anderson's purported statement was highly improbable, particularly in light \r\n  of his advanced age and the fact such a claim was obviously inconsistent with \r\n  his resume, which listed military service but made no mention of the National \r\n  Guard.  (9) \r\n\r\nThe above-stated facts about Anderson, known to The \r\n  Chronicle before publication of \"Let the liar run,\" support our conclusion \r\n  that a reasonable jury could have found the newspaper had \"obvious reasons to \r\n  doubt\" Bray's recollection of his conversation with Anderson. Without question, \r\n  the phone call from Pat Willis clearly evidences some doubt at The Chronicle \r\n  as to whether Bray accurately attributed the National Guard remark to him. Not \r\n  only did Anderson deny the remark, he offered a logical explanation for Bray's \r\n  confusion supported by documentary evidence. In light of these facts, we believe \r\n  The Chronicle's failure to undertake a reasonable investigation into \r\n  the matter creates a jury question as to whether it published the editorial \r\n  with actual malice. (10) See St. Amant, \r\n  390 U.S. at 731 (\"Publishing with [obvious] doubts shows reckless disregard \r\n  for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice.\"); Butts, 388 U.S. \r\n  at 169-70 (Warren, C.J., concurring in result) (\"Suffice it to say that little \r\n  investigative effort was expended initially, and no additional inquiries were \r\n  made even after the editors were notified by respondent and his daughter that \r\n  the account to be published was absolutely untrue. Instead, the Saturday Evening \r\n  Post proceeded on its reckless course with full knowledge of the harm that would \r\n  likely result from publication of the article.\"); Masson, 960 F.2d at \r\n  900-01 (holding evidence which could sustain a jury verdict as to actual malice \r\n  included knowledge on the part of the publisher that the plaintiff disputed \r\n  the accuracy of a quotation attributed to him along with the fact that the publisher \r\n  did not dismiss the plaintiff's charge of inaccuracy out of hand). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Anderson's trial evidence circumstantially \r\n  supports an inference of actual malice in this case. Without objection, Anderson \r\n  entered into evidence an editorial by Senior Writer Carl Langley that appeared \r\n  in the Aiken Standard on September 21, 1997. Langley wrote: \r\n\r\n\r\n  A year ago, and shortly before the November elections, Anderson, \r\n    a semi-retired insurance claims adjuster, was asked by a group of independent \r\n    insurance companies to help process claims from hurricane damage in North \r\n    Carolina.\r\n\r\n  A large number of the claims were made under the National \r\n    Flood Insurance Program, which Anderson referred to in his conversations \r\n    with me and which he told me he gave to another reporter. \r\n\r\n  (He not only furnished that information last year, \r\n    but again this past June after I asked why he did not campaign before \r\n    the 1996 election.) \r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson supported this affirmation by introducing a brief \r\n  clip from the Aiken Standard dated September 27, 1996 and headlined \r\n  \"Candidate leaves area to help Fran victims.\" In relevant part, the article \r\n  stated: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Aiken County House candidate Tom Anderson has had to break \r\n    off his campaign for House District 84 to help process insurance claims resulting \r\n    from Hurricane Fran's destruction in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n  Anderson, the Democratic candidate in House District 84, \r\n    was called out of town and is now working on claims in North Carolina and \r\n    Virginia, a Democratic Party official said. \r\n\r\n\r\nA jury could reasonably infer from this evidence that Anderson \r\n  had in fact said National Flood, or that even a cursory investigation of his \r\n  denial would have revealed the likelihood of a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nOther documentary evidence includes Anderson's cancelled \r\n  check, dated October 10, 1996 and payable to an inn in Jacksonville, N.C., that \r\n  bore the notation \"lodging--Fran 9/9 to 10/10/[9]6.\" Certainly, if The Chronicle \r\n  had inquired further, it would have discovered Anderson could in fact prove \r\n  he was working on hurricane-related claims in North Carolina just before the \r\n  November election. Moreover, a reasonable jury could infer that claims of inaccuracy \r\n  from a candidate running for public office would be taken seriously by a newspaper \r\n  purporting to publish the truth. The Chronicle's failure to do so provides \r\n  a legitimate basis for a jury to conclude \"Let the liar run\" was published with \r\n  actual malice because it evinces an intent to avoid the truth. See Harte-Hanks, \r\n  491 U.S. at 692-93 (\"[I]t is likely that the newspaper's inaction was a product \r\n  of a deliberate decision not to acquire knowledge of facts that might confirm \r\n  the probable falsity of [its editorial]. . . . Although failure to investigate \r\n  will not alone support a finding of actual malice . . . the purposeful avoidance \r\n  of the truth is in a different category. . . . [E]vidence of an intent to avoid \r\n  the truth was not only sufficient to convince the plurality [in Butts] \r\n  that there had been an extreme departure from professional publishing standards, \r\n  [] it was also sufficient to satisfy the more demanding [New York Times] \r\n  standard . . . .\"); Masson, 960 F.2d at 901 (stating that even in the \r\n  absence of proof of a conscious decision to alter a quotation on the publisher's \r\n  part, a jury could still conclude the publisher had obvious reasons to doubt \r\n  the quote's accuracy but, \"in an effort to purposefully avoid the truth, failed \r\n  to conduct a reasonable investigation\" of the plaintiff's claims of inaccuracy) \r\n  (citations omitted); Elder, 341 S.C. at 114, 533 S.E.2d at 902 (finding \r\n  actual malice may be established when there is at least some evidence that \"the \r\n  defendant purposefully avoided the truth\"). \r\n\r\nFurther support is found in the fact that the editorial \r\n  was not \"hot news.\" The phone conversation in which Bray claimed Anderson stated \r\n  he was in the National Guard occurred at some point prior to Bray's first article, \r\n  which appeared in The Chronicle on April 6, 1997. Kent did not publish \r\n  \"Let the liar run\" until October 1, nearly six months later. Undoubtedly, if \r\n  The Chronicle suspected Anderson lied to Bray, it had ample opportunity \r\n  to investigate the matter before publishing the editorial; evidence of intentional \r\n  avoidance can itself lead to a reasonable conclusion of recklessness. See \r\n  Stevens, 270 S.C. at 72, 240 S.E.2d at 815 (finding reckless disregard where \r\n  the defamatory matter was not \"hot news\" and the newspaper failed to verify \r\n  it despite warnings concerning its falsity). Indeed, a jury logically could \r\n  infer some measure of reckless conduct from the fact The Chronicle \r\n  chose to wait and publish the opinions of Kent, whose political bias was evident \r\n  in the editorial's tone, until just a few weeks before the special election. \r\n   (11)   \r\n\r\nFinally, The Chronicle's publication of a \"Clarification\" \r\n  on October 29, 1997 is susceptible of an inference bolstering a finding of reckless \r\n  disregard. The clarification was published nearly a month after the editorial \r\n  defaming Anderson. Although it also noted Anderson's assertion he had been misquoted \r\n  in the June 2 article by Bray, this was six weeks after Anderson told Boyette \r\n  about the mistake. Inferentially, a jury could find The Chronicle's \r\n  lackluster \"clarification\" was merely an attempt to avoid liability for \"Let \r\n  the liar run\" rather than a sincere effort at rectifying the harm done to Anderson's \r\n  reputation. See, e.g., Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. \r\n  29, 46 (1971) (\"Denials, retractions, and corrections are not 'hot' news, and \r\n  rarely receive the prominence of the original story.\"). The reasonableness of \r\n  such a conclusion is buttressed by the fact the \"Clarification\" did not clarify \r\n  anything; it failed to put the issue in context by referencing either the editorial \r\n  or previous articles by Boyette and Bray. More important, it was neither a correction \r\n  nor a retraction of the allegedly false statements. See Zerangue, \r\n  814 F.2d at 1071 (\"Refusal to retract an exposed error tends to support a finding \r\n  of actual malice.\"). \r\n\r\nTaken as true, we think Anderson's testimony, combined with \r\n  the irrefutable documentary evidence in the record, is sufficient to permit \r\n  a jury to decide whether The Chronicle published the statements in \r\n  \"Let the liar run\" with actual malice. See Masson, 501 U.S. at \r\n  510 (stating a plaintiff's sworn denial of the defamatory statements attributed \r\n  to him, combined with such additional evidence as the resemblance of the statements \r\n  to what was actually said, the absence of a tight deadline affording the author \r\n  a practical ability to investigate, and the opportunity to make corrections \r\n  along the way, created a jury question as to whether the defendant published \r\n  the statements with actual malice). At the time of publication, The Chronicle \r\n  had no more reason to believe Bray and his report of Anderson's statement than \r\n  Anderson's denial. As the lower court observed in Masson, in the absence \r\n  of independent evidence, it is not unreasonable to expect a publisher to investigate \r\n  an alleged alteration in a quotation by confronting the author and asking him \r\n  to verify the statement's accuracy by producing notes or other supporting materials. \r\n  Masson, 960 F.2d at 902. \r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the statement \"[Anderson] told this newspaper \r\n  he was called away to National Guard duty\" were found to be true, a reasonable \r\n  jury could infer it was at most a \"slip of the tongue\" and not an intentional \r\n  attempt to mislead. Thus, if the editorial correctly attributed the National \r\n  Guard statement to Anderson but the jury determined he was not a liar, Anderson \r\n  would still be entitled to recover for defamation. See Virginia Bankshares, \r\n  Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1097 (1991) (\"[A] defamatory assessment \r\n  of facts can be actionable even if the facts underlying the assessment are accurately \r\n  presented.\"). \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated repeatedly that \"there is no \r\n  constitutional value in false statements of fact.\" Gertz v. Robert Welch, \r\n  Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 340 (1974); see Herbert, 44 U.S. at 171 \r\n  (\"Spreading false information in and of itself carries no First Amendment credentials.\"). \r\n  The Court also has noted that \"quotations may be a devastating instrument for \r\n  conveying false meaning.\" Masson, 501 U.S. at 517. Because \"a person's \r\n  reputation is invaluable,\" Miller, 322 S.C. at 231, 471 S.E.2d at 687, \r\n  \"[t]hose who publish defamatory falsehoods with the requisite culpability . \r\n  . . are subject to liability, the aim being not only to compensate for injury \r\n  but also to deter publication of unprotected material threatening injury to \r\n  individual reputation.\" Herbert, 441 U.S. at 172. \r\n\r\n\r\n  First [A]mendment cases are unique because our society \r\n    places a high value on free discussion of public issues, and those who engage \r\n    in that discussion are protected even when they make careless errors. However, \r\n    reputation is also a value, and the courts attempt, where possible, to protect \r\n    both freedom of speech and reputation. Balancing these two interests mandates \r\n    that a publisher have clear [F]irst [A]mendment protection from liability \r\n    for the first nonmalicious publication of an erroneous story. However, \r\n    once the publisher knows that the story is erroneous . . . the argument for \r\n    weighting the scales on the side of [F]irst [A]mendment interests becomes \r\n    less compelling. . . . At some point, the effort required of the publisher \r\n    is so slight, and the helplessness of the victim so great, that the balance \r\n    of the scales tips. \r\n\r\n\r\nZerangue, 814 F.2d at 1072 (internal citations omitted). \r\n  Accordingly, although the actual malice standard \"offers substantial protection \r\n  to the critic of a public figure,\" it \"should not be taken as a signal that \r\n  'All is fair' in politics.\" George, 345 S.C. at 462, 548 S.E.2d at 879-80. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe evidence in the record before us supports an inference \r\n  The Chronicle went beyond the \"sloppy journalism\" found in Peeler \r\n  when it published \"Let the liar run.\" We are satisfied this evidence, viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to Anderson, is of a convincing clarity sufficient \r\n  to justify sending the question of actual malice to a jury. See Anderson, \r\n  477 U.S. at 257 (declaring it the duty of the reviewing court to determine \"whether \r\n  the evidence presented is such that a reasonable jury might find that actual \r\n  malice had been shown with convincing clarity\"). The trial court, therefore, \r\n  erred in directing a verdict on this ground. \r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissenting: Because I believe \r\n  Anderson failed to present clear and convincing evidence that The Chronicle \r\n   acted with actual malice, I respectfully dissent. \r\n\r\nIn defamation actions involving \"public figures,\" the plaintiff \r\n  bears the burden of proving the statement was made with actual malice - that \r\n  is, with either knowledge the statement is false or reckless disregard for its \r\n  truth.

Whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of \r\n  actual malice is a question of law. Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, \r\n  491 U.S. 657, 685, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 2694 (1989). An appellate court must independently \r\n  review the record to determine whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient \r\n  to support a finding of actual malice. Elder, 341 S.C. at 113-14, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d at 902; Miller v. City of West Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 228, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d 683, 685 (1996). In all cases, the court must determine whether the evidence \r\n  in the record could support a reasonable jury finding that plaintiff proved \r\n  actual malice by clear and convincing evidence. See \r\n  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255-56 (1986) (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n\r\nActual malice is the subjective standard testing the publisher's \r\n  good faith belief in the truth of his or her statements. Peeler v. Spartan \r\n  Radiocasting, Inc., 324 S.C. 261, 478 S.E.2d 282 (1996). Therefore, in order \r\n  to prevail, Anderson must present clear and convincing evidence establishing \r\n  The Chronicle had no good faith belief in the truth of its statements, \r\n  and thus acted with reckless disregard for the truth when publishing \"Let the \r\n  Liar Run.\" \"A 'reckless disregard' for the truth, however, requires more than \r\n  a departure from reasonably prudent conduct.\" Elder, 341 S.C. at 114, \r\n  533 S.E.2d at 902. Instead, the plaintiff must present \"sufficient evidence \r\n  that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth \r\n  of his publication.\" St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968) \r\n  (emphasis in original). \"There must be evidence the defendant had a 'high \r\n  degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity.'\" Elder, 241 \r\n  S.C. at 114, 533 S.E.2d at 902 (quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. \r\n  64, 74, 85 S.Ct. 209, 216 (1964) (emphasis in original). To prove such, Anderson \r\n  must present evidence, from a subjective standpoint, which demonstrates what \r\n  The Chronicle knew with regard to the alleged falsity of its statements. \r\n  It is insufficient to show the defendant made an editorial choice or merely \r\n  failed to investigate; there must be evidence at least that the defendant purposefully \r\n  avoided the truth. Id. (citations omitted) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\nI believe there is insufficient evidence in the record to \r\n  establish The Chronicle acted with actual malice in publishing the \r\n  editorial written by Kent. After Bray first interviewed Anderson, The Chronicle \r\n  published an article stating Anderson was in the National Guard. When Anderson \r\n  announced he would again run as a candidate, he spoke with Bray once more, and \r\n  a second article was published in which The Chronicle referenced Anderson's \r\n  alleged service in the National Guard. Anderson never requested a retraction \r\n  or correction of either publication. It was not until Boyette contacted Anderson \r\n  about the GOP's request for Anderson to withdraw from the race that Anderson \r\n  denied having made such statements to Bray. Furthermore, The Chronicle \r\n  reported Anderson's version of why he was in North Carolina and that Anderson \r\n  denied telling The Chronicle he served in the National Guard in its \r\n  article discussing the GOP's sentiments. \r\n\r\nPrior to the publication of \"Let the Liar Run,\" The \r\n  Chronicle's Pat Willis contacted Anderson and informed him that she was \r\n  working on an article and requested proof that he was a government-approved \r\n  insurance adjuster and that he had worked in North Carolina in 1996. A reasonable \r\n  jury might view this investigation as subjective evidence that The Chronicle \r\n  did not believe Anderson was so licensed and that he had in fact allowed Bray \r\n  to believe he was serving in the National Guard. Though Anderson was able to \r\n  prove his status as a certified insurance adjuster, this fact does not establish \r\n  that he accurately communicated to Bray his reason for being in North Carolina \r\n  and that The Chronicle purposefully avoided the truth when publishing \r\n  \"Let the Liar Run.\" Moreover, from the subjective point of view of The Chronicle, \r\n  its position that Anderson had stated he was in the National Guard is strengthened \r\n  by Anderson's failure to object to The Chronicle's two prior reports \r\n  and Bray's continued belief in his version of the interview with Anderson. \r\n\r\nThe majority places emphasis on the fact that The Chronicle \r\n  was aware that Anderson disputed Bray's assertion that Anderson stated he served \r\n  in the National Guard. However, this evidence fails to demonstrate The Chronicle \r\n  in fact knew the falsity of its editorial \"Let the Liar Run.\" Rather, this fact \r\n  demonstrates only that The Chronicle knew of Anderson's disagreement \r\n  with Bray's version of the interview - a fact The Chronicle had published \r\n  as well. Moreover, evidence that Anderson disputed Bray's version of their conversation \r\n  says nothing about The Chronicle's knowledge as to the truth of the \r\n  matter, especially considering that Bray stood behind his recollection of the \r\n  interview. \r\n\r\nThe only evidence presented at trial was Anderson's own \r\n  testimony about his conversations with reporters from The Chronicle. \r\n  Because the test for actual malice is subjective as to the knowledge of the \r\n  publisher, evidence of Anderson's personal recollection of the interviews fails \r\n  to shed light on what The Chronicle believed in good faith about the \r\n  truth of the statements it published. Anderson presented no evidence regarding \r\n  the standards and practices of the newspaper industry nor did he present any \r\n  evidence that The Chronicle in fact knew Anderson did not tell Bray \r\n  he had served in the National Guard. Furthermore, Anderson's challenge to the \r\n  publication came only after the Republican Party asked him to withdraw from \r\n  the race. As a public figure, Anderson bore the burden of proof to establish \r\n  actual malice by clear and convincing evidence. Peeler, 324 S.C. at 266, \r\n  478 S.E.2d at 84. Because I believe the evidence presented by Anderson falls \r\n  far short of establishing The Chronicle published \"Let the Liar Run\" \r\n  with a high degree of knowledge as to its probable falsity, I would affirm the \r\n  trial court's directed verdict in favor of the publisher. \r\n\r\n1.  Tara Harbin is Phil Kent's assistant \r\n  at The Chronicle.  \r\n2.  Anderson concedes he is a public \r\n  figure for defamation purposes. See, e.g., Monitor Patriot Co. v. \r\n  Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 271 (1971) (\"[I]t might be preferable to categorize a \r\n  candidate as a 'public figure,' if for no other reason than to avoid straining \r\n  the common meaning of words. But the question is of no importance so far as \r\n  the standard of liability . . . is concerned . . . . That [New York Times] \r\n  itself was intended to apply to candidates, in spite of the use of the more \r\n  restricted 'public official' terminology, is readily apparent from that opinion's \r\n  text and citations to case law.\") (footnote omitted).  \r\n3.  Although The Chronicle concedes \r\n  Phil Kent authored the editorial, it argues Anderson \"presented no evidence \r\n  on who wrote the editorial or who . . . had responsibility for publication of \r\n  the editorial.\" This contention is belied not only by The Chronicle's \r\n  admission, but also by Anderson's trial testimony and a letter from Kent to \r\n  Anderson's son Mark. On re-direct, in response to a question concerning who \r\n  was \"responsible for the creation of the [editorial],\" Anderson replied, \"Phil \r\n  Kent and The Augusta Chronicle.\" In addition, the letter, on Chronicle \r\n  stationery listing \"Philip Kent\" as the \"Editorial Page Editor\" and admitted \r\n  into evidence without objection, includes his statement that \"[m]y responsibility \r\n  is solely for the opinion pages, including letters to the editor.\"  \r\n4.  We agree with the court in Masson, \r\n  which explained that Harte-Hanks and other Supreme Court precedent stand \r\n  for the proposition \"that a publisher who does not already have 'obvious reasons \r\n  to doubt' the accuracy of a story is not required to initiate an investigation \r\n  that might plant such doubt. Once doubt exists, however, the publisher must \r\n  act reasonably in dispelling it. Thus, where the publisher undertakes to investigate \r\n  the accuracy of a story and learns facts casting doubt on the information contained \r\n  therein, it may not ignore those doubts, even though it had no duty to conduct \r\n  the investigation in the first place.\" Masson, 960 F.2d at 901.  \r\n5.  Although the record before us indicates \r\n  Bray \"stands by his story on the National Guard issue,\" the determination of \r\n  what Anderson actually said is uniquely a question for the trier of fact. See \r\n  Masson, 501 U.S. at 521 (stating that, although the article's author \r\n  contested the plaintiff's allegations that he was misquoted, \"only a trial on \r\n  the merits will resolve the factual dispute\").  \r\n6.  We further note this case is factually \r\n  distinguishable from both Peeler and its source for the rationality principle, \r\n  McMurry v. Howard Publ'ns, Inc., 612 P.2d 14 (Wyo. 1980). Not only did \r\n  Peeler involve a situation in which a discrepancy emerged between what \r\n  several listeners, including the reporter, thought they heard a third party \r\n  say, there was absolutely no evidence suggesting the reporter or publisher \r\n  had reason to doubt the truth of the statements at issue before publication. \r\n  McMurry, on the other hand, is clearly a case where several parties heard the \r\n  plaintiff say the same thing, but interpreted the meaning \r\n  of what was said differently; the statement, therefore, properly was protected \r\n  under a rational interpretation principle.  \r\n7.  Anderson testified the letter, which \r\n  specifically authorized him to \"handle residential, commercial and condominium \r\n  losses,\" reflected a renewal of his status as a certified adjuster for National \r\n  Flood. According to Anderson, the agency had certified him \"five or six times\" \r\n  before 1996.  \r\n8.  Although The Chronicle now \r\n  asserts the documents faxed to Willis were \"confusing,\" the paper made no attempt \r\n  to contact Anderson for an explanation or to request additional information. \r\n   \r\n 9.  The Chronicle's assertion \r\n  that \"evidence concerning whether or not [Anderson] could have served in the \r\n  National Guard does not establish what [he] said to reporter Bray during their \r\n  two telephone interviews\" misses the point. The issue involved in the actual \r\n  malice inquiry is not what Anderson said, but whether The Chronicle \r\n  had reason to doubt the accuracy of Bray's report or its own conclusion that \r\n  Anderson was a liar based on that report.  \r\n10.  As noted in Masson on remand, \r\n  &quot;[i]t is not . . . the failure to act reasonably in itself that establishes \r\n  malice; that failure is only a link in the chain of inferences that could (but \r\n  need not) lead a jury to conclude that the publisher failed to conduct an investigation \r\n  because it was already pretty much aware of the falsity.\" Masson, 960 \r\n  F.2d at 900.  \r\n11.  We recognize a defamatory item \r\n  published in an editorial/opinion column may in some circumstances militate \r\n  against a finding of actual malice. See Elder, 341 S.C. at 118 \r\n  n.9, 533 S.E.2d at 904 n.9 (\"The 'form and content of [a] story are relevant \r\n  . . . to the question of actual malice.'\") (quoting Harte-Hanks, 491 \r\n  U.S. at 695). However, \"where a statement of 'opinion' on a matter of public \r\n  concern reasonably implies false and defamatory facts regarding public figures \r\n  or officials, those individuals [can recover if they] show that such statements \r\n  were made with knowledge of their false implications or with reckless disregard \r\n  of their truth.\" Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 20 (1990). \r\n  As noted in Milkovich:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If a speaker says, \"In my opinion John Jones is a liar,\" \r\n    he implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion that Jones told \r\n    an untruth. Even if the speaker states the facts upon which he bases his opinion, \r\n    if those facts are either incorrect or incomplete, or if his assessment of \r\n    them is erroneous, the statement may still imply a false assertion of fact. \r\n    Simply couching such statements in terms of opinion does not dispel these \r\n    implications; and the statement, \"In my opinion Jones is a liar,\" can cause \r\n    as much damage to reputation as the statement, \"Jones is a liar.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 18-19. Thus, the mere fact that an item appears \r\n  on the editorial page and is couched in terms of an \"opinion\" does not relieve \r\n  the speaker or publisher from liability. See id.; see also \r\n  Goodwin v. Kennedy, 347 S.C. 30, 41, 552 S.E.2d 319, 325 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (applying Milkovich to uphold the trial court's denial of a requested \r\n  jury instruction that &quot;appear[ed] to exempt all opinion as non-defamatory \r\n  comment without qualification\"). To the contrary, the same constitutional analysis \r\n  applies to statements of opinion that imply an assertion of fact, unless, of \r\n  course, the statement is not capable of being proved either true or false. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3598","title":"Belton v.

Jahue Moore, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:Â  Stewart Belton filed this \r\n  action alleging breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay insurance proceeds. \r\n  Cincinnati Insurance Company (Cincinnati) moved for summary judgment. The circuit \r\n  court granted Cincinnatiâ€™s motion. Belton appeals. We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nStuart Belton and Grady Query signed \r\n  an agreement captioned â€œLease Option to Buyâ€ dated October 5, 1997. The agreement \r\n  was a simple handwritten contract specifying a purchase price of $280,000 with \r\n  a $50 down payment. The contract further provided for a note for $280,000 at \r\n  8% interest and lease payments of $1200 per month with eighty percent of each \r\n  payment to be applied to the purchase price. The note was never executed.\r\nThe contract further provided the purchase was \r\n  to be completed by November 1, 2002 with payment of the balance due at that \r\n  time. The contract allowed Belton to improve the property before the closing \r\n  only with Queryâ€™s approval. \r\nBelton fell behind almost immediately on his lease \r\n  payments. On January 16, 1998, Belton wrote Query claiming the November 1997 \r\n  payment was â€œmoved up to December due to a miscommunication.â€ Belton also claimed \r\n  he was repairing the roof in lieu of rental payments for January and February. \r\n  Query wrote Belton a letter on January 23, 1998, stating he was terminating \r\n  the agreement and advising him to immediately vacate the premises. Belton \r\n  did not vacate, and Query wrote another letter on February 18, 1998, again advising \r\n  Belton he was terminating the agreement and advising Belton to vacate the premises.\r\nBelton did not vacate, and Query filed \r\n  a rule to vacate or show cause dated February 25, 1998. Query alleged Belton \r\n  had not paid December, January, or February lease payments. Belton also failed \r\n  to make payments in March and April of 1998. By petition dated April 24, 1998, \r\n  Belton filed for bankruptcy and received protection from eviction due to the \r\n  resulting automatic stay. \r\nOn July 24, 1998, Query filed a motion in the bankruptcy \r\n  court seeking to lift the stay. Belton, as advised by his bankruptcy attorney, \r\n  sought to obtain property insurance on the building. On August 5, 1998, the \r\n  Livingston Agency issued a binder from Cincinnati. On August 14, 1998, an intentional \r\n  fire destroyed the building. The bankruptcy court granted Queryâ€™s motion to \r\n  lift the automatic stay on August 21, 1998. \r\nBelton filed a claim with Cincinnati for \r\n  insurance proceeds on the building.Â  Cincinnati refused to pay the claim based \r\n  upon the absence of a binding insurance contract and fraud. Belton sued Cincinnati \r\n  asserting breach of contract and bad faith refusal to tender insurance proceeds. \r\n  Cincinnati moved for summary judgment on September 8, 2000. A hearing on the \r\n  motion was held on October 23, 2000. The trial court granted Cincinnatiâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment on all of Beltonâ€™s causes of action, ruling that Beltonâ€™s \r\n  insurance contract was invalid at the time of its making and at the time of \r\n  the fire because Belton did not have an insurable interest in the building at \r\n  either time. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there \r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to summary \r\n  judgment as a matter of law. Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. \r\n  454, 462, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002). When determining whether triable issues \r\n  of fact exist, all evidence and inferences drawn from the evidence are viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Osborne v. Adams, \r\n  346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&nbsp;Belton contends the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment on his breach of contract and bad faith refusal \r\n  to pay insurance proceeds causes of action. We agree.\r\nIn order to have an insurable interest \r\n  in property under contract for purchase, there must be a valid contract in existence \r\n  both at the time the policy was issued and became effective, and at the time \r\n  of the loss. South Carolina Ins. Co. v. White, 301 S.C. 133, 138, 390 \r\n  S.E.2d 471, 475 (Ct. App. 1990); Powell v. Ins. Co. of North America, \r\n  285 S.C. 588, 590, 330 S.E.2d 550, 552 (Ct. App. 1985). When a contract to purchase \r\n  property terminates, the purchaserâ€™s insurable interest is extinguished. White, \r\n  301 S.C. at 138, 390 S.E.2d at 471. Where an insurable interest does not exist \r\n  at the time the contract for insurance was made, the insurance contract is void \r\n  from its inception. Abraham v. New York Underwriters Ins. Co., 187 S.C. \r\n  70, 78, 196 S.E. 531, 534 (1938).Â Â  \r\nThe trial court concluded the entire contract \r\n  terminated upon Queryâ€™s attempted cancellation of the contract by letters dated \r\n  January 23 and February 18, 1998. The contract did not provide terms for ejectment. \r\n  Accordingly, the statutory grounds for ejectment of a tenant under a lease would \r\n  apply. Section 27-37-10 of the South Carolina Code provides: â€œ(A) The tenant \r\n  may be ejected upon application of the landlord or his agent when (1) the tenant \r\n  fails or refuses to pay the rent when due or when demanded, (2) the term of \r\n  tenancy or occupancy has ended, or (3) the terms or conditions of the lease \r\n  have been violated.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-37-10 (Supp. 2001). â€œ[T]he Legislature \r\n  enacted section 27-37-10 to give the lessor a right not recognized at common \r\n  law, the right to terminate a lease in the absence of a contractual provision.â€ \r\n  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275-76, \r\n  440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994). Therefore, even without specific terms for ejectment \r\n  in the partiesâ€™ contract, the application of section 27-37-10 may have been \r\n  sufficient to evict Belton and terminate the lease portion of the contract.\r\nHowever, the termination of the lease \r\n  would not ipso facto terminate Beltonâ€™s option to purchase the property. \r\n  The determination of whether terms in a contract are severable depends on the \r\n  intent of the parties, which requires a factual determination. Williams v. \r\n  Riedman, 339 S.C. 251, 277, 529 S.E.2d 28, 41 (Ct. App. 2000). Belton testified \r\n  in deposition he recognized the contract was a lease with an option to purchase \r\n  but believed the right to purchase the property existed even at the time of \r\n  the hearing. Query acknowledged he remained willing to honor Beltonâ€™s option \r\n  to purchase the property. We find a factual issue exists as to whether Beltonâ€™s \r\n  right to purchase the property under the option was severable from his rights \r\n  as a lessee. Accordingly, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that the entire \r\n  contract terminated due to Beltonâ€™s failure to make lease payments.\r\nThe trial court further found, however, \r\n  that even if the option was severed from the lease, Belton had no insurable \r\n  interest as he held a mere expectancy to purchase property that did not qualify \r\n  as an insurable interest.\r\nIn Benton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Boden, \r\n  this court defined an insurable interest:\r\nIt may be said, generally, that any one has an insurable interest \r\n  in property who derives a benefit from its existence or would suffer loss from \r\n  its destruction.Â  An insurable interest in property is any right, benefit or \r\n  advantage arising out of or dependent thereon, or any liability in respect thereof, \r\n  or any relation to or concern therein of such a nature that it might be so affected \r\n  by the contemplated peril as to directly damnify the insured. \r\n* * *\r\nThe term â€˜interest,â€™ as used in the phrase â€˜insurable interest,â€™ \r\n  is not limited to property or ownership in the subject matter of the insurance \r\n  . . . . [A]n insurable interest in property may arise from some liability which \r\n  insured incurs with relation thereto. . . . Such liability may arise by force \r\n  of statute or by contract, or may be fixed by law from the obligations which \r\n  insured assumes.Â  \r\n* * *\r\nMoreover, an insurable interest in property does not necessarily \r\n  imply a property interest in, or a lien upon, or possession of, the subject \r\n  matter of the insurance, and neither the title nor a beneficial interest is \r\n  requisite to the existence of such an interest, it is sufficient that the insured \r\n  is so situated with reference to the property that he would be liable to loss \r\n  should it be injured or destroyed by the peril against which it is insured.Â  \r\n  For instance, although a person has no title, legal or equitable, in the property, \r\n  and neither possession nor right to possession, yet he has an insurable interest \r\n  therein if it is primarily charged in either law or equity with a debt or obligation \r\n  for which he is secondarily liable.Â  \r\n310 S.C. 400, 403-04, 426 S.E.2d 823, 825-26 (Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (internal citations omitted). \r\nThere is no South Carolina case expressly considering the \r\n  insurable interest of a party holding an option to purchase. When there is no \r\n  South Carolina case directly on point, our court may look to other jurisdictions \r\n  for persuasive authority. See Williams v. Morris, 320 S.C. 196, \r\n  200, 464 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1995) (applying the law of foreign jurisdictions in \r\n  the absence of governing South Carolina law).Â Â  \r\nAt least one legal commentator has concluded that a party \r\n  with an option to purchase property has an insurable interest in the property. \r\n  See Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, 3 Couch on Insurance 3d \r\n  Â§ 42:64, at 42-80 (1997) (â€œThe holder of an option to purchase has an insurable \r\n  interest in the property to which the option extends.â€).

See Neuman v. Travelers Indem.

Co., 316 S.C. 199, 202, 447 S.E.2d 869, 870 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994). We thus make no determination regarding the extent of Beltonâ€™s insurable \r\n  interest. It may well be minimal or nonexistent. We find, however, the determination \r\n  of the extent of the interest is a question of fact.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the order granting \r\n  summary judgment on Beltonâ€™s causes of action for breach of contract and bad \r\n  faith refusal to pay insurance proceeds and remand for proceedings consistent \r\n  with this opinion.

Keeton &amp; \r\n  Alan I. Widiss, Insurance Law, A Guide to Fundamental Principles, Legal Doctrines, \r\n  and Commercial Practices, Practitionerâ€™s Edition Â§ 3.1(c), at 136-138 (1988).Â  \r\n  Allowing the holder of an option to purchase insurance prior to his exercise \r\n  of the option invites the very misbehavior the doctrine of insurable interest \r\n  endeavors to prevent.Â  Beltonâ€™s situation is the perfect case in point.Â  Here, \r\n  Belton purchased insurance after he failed to make numerous payments toward \r\n  his lease with option to purchase, after he received notice that his lease had \r\n  been terminated, and after he was asked to vacate the premises.Â  For Belton \r\n  to receive any money now that the property is destroyed would put him in a better \r\n  position than he was in prior to the fire.Â  Such a result, in my opinion, could \r\n  well encourage fraudulent and even criminal conduct.\r\nThe majority cites Neuman v. Travelers Indem. \r\n  Co., 319 A.2d 522 (Md. 1974), for the proposition that the holder of an \r\n  unexercised option to purchase property has an insurable interest in that property.Â  \r\n  I decline to read Neuman so broadly.Â  In Neuman, the lessees of \r\n  a warehouse had an insurance policy that covered tangible property.Â  During \r\n  the lease, a wall of the warehouse collapsed, and the lessees argued that their \r\n  loss of use of the warehouse for the remainder of the leaseâ€™s term ought to \r\n  be covered by their insurance because it constituted tangible property.Â  Although \r\n  the issue in Neuman did not involve the insurability of an option to \r\n  purchase, the court did state that it was â€œfamiliar with the fact that [a] \r\n  lessee has an insurable interest in property leased under certain circumstances, \r\n  as where he has covenanted to return it in good order at the end of the term, \r\n  has orally agreed to keep the premises insured, or where he has an option to \r\n  purchase.â€Â  Id. at 531 (citing 3 G. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \r\n  Â§ 24:60 (2d ed. R. Anderson 1960)) (emphasis added).Â  Notably, this statement \r\n  was not outcome-determinative in the case.Â  Moreover, the Maryland court only \r\n  refers to a lessee who has an option to purchase, not someone like Belton \r\n  who was merely a holder of an option.Â  Finally, the statement does not shed \r\n  any light on whether the holder of an unexercised option to purchase \r\n  property would have an insurable interest. \r\nThe majority next cites \r\n  G.M. Battery &amp; Boat Co. v. L.K.N. Corp., 747 S.W.2d 624 (Mo. 1988) \r\n  (en banc) (5-2 decision), to support its conclusion that Beltonâ€™s option to \r\n  purchase gave him an insurable interest in the property. However, L.K.N.â€™s lease \r\n  with option to purchase is significantly different from Beltonâ€™s lease.Â  In \r\n  G.M. Battery &amp; Boat, Co., the terms of L.K.N.â€™s lease required L.K.N. \r\n  to obtain an insurance policy naming G.M. Battery as the loss payee.Â Â  L.K.N. \r\n  did obtain insurance, but it named itself as the loss payee.Â  When a fire destroyed \r\n  the building, L.K.N.â€™s insurance carrier refused to pay for any part of the \r\n  building loss, claiming that L.K.N. had no insurable interest in the building.Â  \r\n  The Supreme Court of Missouri disagreed and found that because L.K.N. â€œhad bound \r\n  itself to furnish insurance payable to GMBâ€ and because L.K.N. â€œstood to lose \r\n  the remaining six months on the lease, as well as the utility of the option \r\n  and the rent credit on the option price,â€ it indeed had an insurable interest \r\n  in the property.Â  Id. at 627.Â Â  Unlike L.K.N.â€™s lease, Beltonâ€™s lease \r\n  did not require him to purchase insurance.Â  Furthermore, because Beltonâ€™s lease \r\n  was already terminated, he did not stand to lose any time remaining on the lease \r\n  as was the case for L.K.N. \r\nFinally, the majority relies \r\n  on Morris v. Clay County Mutual Ins. Co., 1996 WL 251832 (Neb. Ct. App. \r\n  1996), a case which has not been approved for publication.Â  In the Morris \r\n  case, the lower court granted the insurance companyâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  The appellate court reversed, finding that because the Morrises presented evidence \r\n  that they had an option contract to buy property and had been performing \r\n  that contract by making $75 monthly payments, a finder of fact could determine \r\n  the Morrises had an insurable interest in the property.Â  Id. at *4 (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  Unlike the Morrises, Belton had not been performing on his lease with \r\n  option to purchase.\r\nTaking into consideration \r\n  the purpose behind the doctrine of insurable interest and cases from other jurisdictions, \r\n  I do not believe Belton had an insurable interest.Â  Beltonâ€™s lease was terminated \r\n  months before he obtained fire insurance.Â  At the time of the fire, Belton merely \r\n  had an obligation-free, unexercised option to purchase the building.Â  Therefore, \r\n  Belton derived no benefit from the propertyâ€™s existence nor suffered any loss \r\n  upon its destruction.Â  Accordingly, Belton had no insurable interest, and the \r\n  judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  In light of our disposition, we need not address Beltonâ€™s remaining \r\n    arguments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3599","title":"State v.

Morgan, of Aiken; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:Â  Pamela Grubbs appeals her \r\n  murder conviction arguing she is entitled to a new trial because the circuit \r\n  court erred in refusing to admit expert testimony regarding the battered spouse \r\n  syndrome and in refusing to charge the jury the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nGrubbs and Clifford Smith lived together in a common \r\n  law relationship.Â  Grubbs admitted Smith intended to sever the relationship. \r\n  Â Late on the evening of November 18, 1998, the Bamberg County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department received a call to respond to the coupleâ€™sÂ  residence.Â  The caller \r\n  reported â€œa shooting and an intruder.â€Â  When the police arrived, they found \r\n  Smith dead on the sofa in the living room.Â  Smith died as the result of five \r\n  gunshot wounds to the right side of his body. \r\n Grubbs made numerous conflicting statements \r\n  regarding the events leading to Smithâ€™s death. In her first written statement \r\n  made several hours after the incident, Grubbs stated Smith left the home in \r\n  the early evening to find the title to a truck at work. Before Smith left, Grubbs \r\n  told him she was afraid of being alone. Smith left Grubbs a portable telephone \r\n  in the bedroom and told her he would call before returning home. After falling \r\n  asleep in the bedroom, Grubbs stated she was awakened by the sound of the bedroom \r\n  door opening and saw a personâ€™s shadow in the doorway. Grubbs said she shouted \r\n  Smithâ€™s name and pulled a pistol from under her pillow as the figure leaned \r\n  over her as she lay in bed. The intruder did not respond and she shot him. Grubbs \r\n  stated the intruder then ran into the living room where she fired the bullets \r\n  remaining in the gun. Grubbs stated she then turned on the light and discovered \r\n  the intruder was Smith.Â  Grubbs stated the shooting occurred at 10:30 p.m. She \r\n  called her brother and waited for him to arrive before calling the sheriffâ€™s \r\n  department at 11:28 p.m.\r\nDuring the investigation, Officer Tom \r\n  Darnell concluded the physical evidence at the scene did not match Grubbsâ€™s \r\n  story. Darnell testified the physical evidence indicated no gunshots were fired \r\n  in the bedroom. Instead, all the wounds Smith received were consistent with \r\n  being shot while lying on his side on the sofa. \r\nIn her next statement, Grubbs told the \r\n  police she arrived home from work just before 5:00 p.m. on November 18th.Â  Smith \r\n  arrived home shortly thereafter and they argued about a truck title.Â  Grubbs \r\n  went to bed.Â  Smith later entered the bedroom, hovered over the bed, and yelled \r\n  at Grubbs. He then turned around and walked out. Grubbs followed with the gun, \r\n  approached him, and shot him. Â In her final pretrial statement, Grubbs \r\n  supplemented this statement stating that when Smith argued with her in the bedroom, \r\n  he pushed her around and hit her in the eye. \r\nAt trial, Grubbs testified Smith argued with her \r\n  about putting the title to her car in his name. When Grubbs refused to change \r\n  the name on the title, Smith pushed her onto the couch and left the house.Â  \r\n  After she went to bed, she woke up when the bedroom door cracked open and a \r\n  figure was on top of her and hit her in the stomach and eye.Â  Grubbs testified \r\n  she never saw the face of her attacker and could only identify the outline of \r\n  his body.Â  Grubbs testified that after being hit, she screamed and the figure \r\n  ran into the living room.Â  Grubbs retrieved her pistol and went into the living \r\n  room.Â  As Grubbs approached the couch, she stated the figure jumped at her and \r\n  she fired the gun.Â  Grubbs maintained throughout the trial that she did not \r\n  know her attacker was Smith until she turned the lights on in the living room.\r\nGrubbs was convicted and sentenced to thirty-five \r\n  years imprisonment. She appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Failure to admit expert testimony\r\nGrubbs argues the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to admit the testimony of her expert witness regarding battered \r\n  spouse syndrome.Â  We agree.\r\nGrubbs testified to numerous instances of physical \r\n  and mental abuse perpetrated on her by Smith, including a physical altercation \r\n  in 1997, after which Grubbs obtained an order of protection against Smith.Â  \r\n\r\nGrubbs sought to introduce the testimony \r\n  of Dr. Lois Veronen. Veronen concluded Grubbs fit the profile of one suffering \r\n  from battered spouse syndrome.Â  Veronen also opined the syndrome could explain \r\n  why Grubbs gave conflicting statements. During Veronenâ€™s in camera testimony, \r\n  the following colloquy ensued:\r\n\r\n[Defense]: [Are you] aware that Ms. Grubbs stated on numerous \r\n  occasions during cross that this shooting was an accident and not really admitting \r\n  or stating that she recognized Mr. Smith as being the abuser/ intruder[?]\r\n[Veronen]:Â  Correct.\r\n[Defense]:Â  Is that something â€“ how does that play with being \r\n  a â€“ a victim of the battered womanâ€™s syndrome?\r\n[Veronen]:Â  Well, I think it plays very directly because her \r\n  sense of self and her role as an actor has been so diminished in her relationship \r\n  that she cannot say that she is defending herself.Â  She has to make her intimate \r\n  partner a stranger in order to defend herself. He cannot be Cliff whom she was \r\n  fighting with.Â  He has to be an intruder.Â  The sense of having a right to defend \r\n  herself against her partnerâ€™s violence â€“ she has lost that in the process of \r\n  this relationship.Â  \r\n\r\nVeronen testified further that \r\n  women who suffer from battered spouse syndrome rarely disclose their abuse to \r\n  others. The colloquy continued: Â Â \r\n\r\n[Defense]:Â  In this particular case, is it possible that during \r\n  the initial questioning after this incident that [Grubbs] was still trying to \r\n  protect [Smith].\r\n[Veronen]:Â  Well, trying to protect [Smith] but trying to \r\n  protect the image of their relationship as well â€“ that this was a loving relationship.\r\n[Defense]:Â  Could that possibly be the case almost two years \r\n  later?\r\n[Veronen]:Â  In part, we see, you know, thereâ€™sÂ  - thereâ€™s \r\n  cracks in it.Â  Thereâ€™s some insight into the nature of this relationship, but \r\n  itâ€™s not a full recognition of this relationship as being abusive.\r\n[Defense]:Â  So [Grubbs] could be still possibly protecting \r\n  that image of the relationship on today.Â  \r\n[Veronen]:Â  Correct.\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to allow \r\n  Veronenâ€™s testimony because it conflicted with Grubbsâ€™ own testimony at trial \r\n  that she did not know her attacker at the time she fired the gun. The court \r\n  stated: â€œIf a defendant does not recognize the intruder as the abuser, then \r\n  the defense does not apply . . . .â€Â  The court further explained:\r\n\r\n[T]he jury would have to ignore the rationale expressed by \r\n  [Grubbs] as she explained to this jury why she did not believe [Smith] to be \r\n  her abuser and would have to supplant the testimony which it has heard under \r\n  oath by . . . [Grubbs] herself with the supposition of an opinion of that put \r\n  forth by [Grubbsâ€™] expert. I find that that would be an intrusion into the province \r\n  of the jury.Â  As Iâ€™ve said, [Grubbs] may very well be a battered woman, but \r\n  under the facts of this case as testified to by [Grubbs] herself, those facts \r\n  do not bear out the presentation of that defense or the expert testimony supporting \r\n  it to this jury and the Stateâ€™s motion to suppress that line of testimony is \r\n  therefore granted. \r\n\r\nWe find the trial court erred in excluding \r\n  the testimony.Â  Rule 702, SCRE, allows a party to present expert testimony to \r\n  the finder of fact if â€œscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge \r\n  will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact \r\n  in issue.â€Â  Rule 702, SCRE. A trial courtâ€™s decision to admit or exclude expert \r\n  testimony will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Mizell v. \r\n  Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 406, 570 S.E.2d 176, 183 (2002). A trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion \r\n  where the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair. Means \r\n  v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 166, 558 S.E.2d 921, 924 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\n The battered spouse syndrome was first \r\n  recognized in South Carolina by our supreme court in State v. Hill, 287 \r\n  S.C. 398, 339 S.E.2d 121 (1986).Â  In Hill, the court held that expert \r\n  testimony about battered spouse syndrome is admissible to establish a claim \r\n  of self-defense in a homicide case.Â  Hill, 287 S.C. at 399-400, 339 S.E.2d \r\n  at 122.Â  The court acknowledged the emerging trend in other jurisdictions that \r\n  find â€œthe testimony is relevant to the issue of self-defense and highly probative \r\n  of the defendantâ€™s state of mind at the time of the incident.â€ Id. at \r\n  400, 339 S.E.2d at 122. Therefore, â€œ[i]f the jury accepted the [defendantâ€™s] \r\n  version of what happened, that would make the proffered expert testimony not \r\n  only relevant, but critical.â€ Id. at 399-400, 339 S.E.2d at 122.Â  \r\nIn Robinson v. State, the court examined \r\n  the battered spouse syndrome in relation to the specific elements of self-defense \r\n  in a homicide case. 308 S.C. 74, 417 S.E.2d 88 (1992).Â  The court found â€œthe \r\n  unique perceptions of a defendant suffering from battered womanâ€™s syndrome are \r\n  generally compatible with the law of this State regarding self-defense.â€ Id. \r\n  at 78, 417 S.E.2d at 91. The court concluded: â€œOur interpretation of the relationship \r\n  between the battered womanâ€™s syndrome and self-defense is cursory, at best, \r\n  and should not be construed as this Courtâ€™s last word on the subject.Â  Our law \r\n  will continue to evolve as the scientific communityâ€™s understanding of the battered \r\n  womanâ€™s syndrome develops and societyâ€™s comprehension of the condition becomes \r\n  more sophisticated.â€ Id. at 80, 417 S.E.2d at 92. \r\nFurthermore, section 17-23-170 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code governs the admissibility of expert testimony of the battered spouse syndrome:\r\n\r\n(A) Evidence that the actor was suffering from the battered \r\n  spouse syndrome is admissible in a criminal action on the issue of whether the \r\n  actor lawfully acted in self-defense, defense of another, defense of necessity, \r\n  or defense of duress. This section does not preclude the admission of testimony \r\n  on battered spouse syndrome in other criminal actions.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-170 (Supp. 2001).\r\nGrubbsâ€™s defense at trial was self-defense.Â  In \r\n  one of her pre-trial statements, Grubbs claimed Smith pushed her and punched \r\n  her in the eye. Grubbs also testified to a pattern of past abuse perpetrated \r\n  by Smith. In closing arguments, Grubbsâ€™s counsel argued self-defense. The trial \r\n  court charged the jury the law of self-defense. Precisely because Grubbsâ€™s trial \r\n  testimony conflicted with her own defense, and the proffered expert testimony \r\n  was relevant to explain this conflict, the jury was entitled to consider the \r\n  testimony. See State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 306-09, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  391, 396-98 (2001) (finding a jury question existed regarding which of a defendantâ€™s \r\n  conflicting statements to believe; thus, entitling defendant to a jury charge \r\n  relevant to a pretrial, inconsistent statement).Â  The jury needed the expertâ€™s \r\n  testimony to assist it in evaluating Grubbsâ€™ state of mind at the time of the \r\n  shooting.Â  The expert offered testimony that Grubbsâ€™s conflicting statements \r\n  resulted from the syndrome. Without the expertâ€™s testimony, the jury had no \r\n  way of putting the differing versions of Grubbsâ€™ statements into context. We \r\n  find Veronenâ€™s testimony was necessary to assist the jury in understanding the \r\n  issues involved in the case, and the trial court erred in excluding the evidence.\r\nII.Â  Voluntary Manslaughter Charge\r\nGrubbs also argues the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to charge the jury the law of voluntary manslaughter. We agree.\r\nAt trial, the State argued Grubbs was \r\n  not entitled to a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter because, through her \r\n  trial testimony, she â€œdisavowed herself of the manslaughter element . . . .â€ \r\n  The trial court agreed finding that â€œa person charged with an offense [does \r\n  not have] the right to submit various inconsistent theories of a defense and \r\n  kind of throw them up on the wall to see what sticks . . . .â€ \r\nThe law to be charged must be determined \r\n  from the evidence presented at trial. Knoten, 347 S.C. at 302, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  at 394.Â  When determining whether a defendant is entitled to a voluntary manslaughter \r\n  charge, the court views the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant.Â  \r\n  State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474 S.E.2d 430, 431 (1996).Â  Fighting \r\n  is sufficient legal provocation to warrant giving a voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  \r\n  State v. Davis, 278 S.C. 544, 546, 298 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1983).\r\nVoluntary manslaughter is defined as:\r\n\r\n[T]he unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of \r\n  passion upon sufficient legal provocation. Heat of passion alone will not suffice \r\n  to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. Both heat of passion and sufficient \r\n  legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing. The sudden heat \r\n  of passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing \r\n  to manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge \r\n  and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and \r\n  render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce \r\n  what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse \r\n  to do violence.\r\n\r\nState v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101-02, 525 S.E.2d \r\n  511, 513 (2000) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\r\nIn Knoten, Knoten was charged with \r\n  numerous crimes including murder. 347 S.C. at 299, 555 S.E.2d at 393.Â  Knoten \r\n  gave several conflicting statements including one in which he claimed the victim \r\n  armed herself with a knife, and threatened and cut Knoten.Â  Id. at 301, \r\n  555 S.E.2d at 393-94.Â  Knotenâ€™s conflicting statements were introduced at trial.Â  \r\n  Id. at 302, 555 S.E.2d at 394.Â  Also at trial, Knoten recanted his statements, \r\n  claiming a co-worker committed the murder.Â  Id. at 301-02, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  at 393-94. \r\nThe trial court refused to charge the \r\n  jury the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Id.Â  Our supreme court reversed \r\n  finding the jury could have believed Knotenâ€™s statement claiming the victim \r\n  threatened and cut him.Â  Id. at 306-09, 555 S.E.2d at 396-98.Â  Notwithstanding \r\n  the conflicting statements, the court concluded Knoten was entitled to a charge \r\n  of voluntary manslaughter because one of his statements asserted facts entitling \r\n  him to the charge.Â  Id. at 305-06, 555 S.E.2d at 398.\r\nWe likewise find Grubbsâ€™s inconsistent statements \r\n  do not negate her right to a charge of voluntary manslaughter where one of her \r\n  statements asserted facts entitling her to the charge.Â  Because a jury could \r\n  believe the facts as represented by Grubbs in her statement alleging Smith pushed \r\n  her and punched her in the eye, and in light of the testimony of long term abuse \r\n  of Grubbs by Smith, a charge on voluntary manslaughter was appropriate. Thus, \r\n  the trial court erred by failing to charge voluntary manslaughter to the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to admit the expert testimony regarding battered spouse syndrome. We likewise \r\n  find the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury the law of voluntary \r\n  manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, Grubbsâ€™s conviction is reversed and the case is \r\n  remanded for a new trial.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3600","title":"State v.

Â Â We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 21, 1999, Jane \r\n  Doe [1]  and Gill Armstrong were \r\n  traveling with their infant daughter from Virginia to their home in Florida.Â  \r\n  They stopped at a hotel off I-95 in St. George about 11:00 p.m.Â Â  After checking \r\n  in, Armstrong went to a nearby restaurant to get some food.Â Â  When he returned, \r\n  he noticed three men standing in the breezeway near his room.Â  Assuming they \r\n  were hotel guests, he proceeded back to his room.Â  After putting the food in \r\n  the room, Armstrong went back outside to the vending machines for drinks.Â  \r\nAt the vending machine, \r\n  a man whom Armstrong later identified as Timothy Washington, placed a gun to \r\n  his head and demanded money.Â  Lewis and Shermaine Elmore were with Washington.Â  \r\n  Armstrong recognized the three as the same men he had seen in the breezeway \r\n  minutes earlier.Â  The three assailants demanded that Armstrong take them to \r\n  his room.Â  \r\nAs the men entered the room, \r\n  Doe was getting out of the shower clad only in a towel.Â  Their daughter was \r\n  asleep on the bed.Â  The assailants demanded money.Â  When they realized Armstrong \r\n  and Doe had only fourteen dollars, they became enraged and began searching the \r\n  room.Â  They did not find anything else in the room.Â  \r\nLewis and Washington then took turns sexually assaulting \r\n  Doe in the bedroom while Elmore held Armstrong at gunpoint in the bathroom.Â Â  \r\n  Washington then took Doe into the bathroom and sexually assaulted her in Armstrongâ€™s \r\n  presence.Â Â  Thereafter, the assailants took Armstrongâ€™s keys and stole his car.Â  \r\n  The car was found a few days later near St. George.Â  \r\nLewis and Washington were tried \r\n  together, and both were found guilty of all charges.Â  The trial court sentenced \r\n  Lewis to five years for grand larceny and thirty years concurrently on each \r\n  of the remaining charges.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the trial court err by failing to suppress Armstrongâ€™s \r\n  in-court identification of Lewis?Â  \r\nII. Did the trial court err in refusing to allow Lewis to \r\n  strike a juror previously stricken by his co-defendant?Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nLewis first argues he is entitled to \r\n  a new trial because the trial court erred in failing to suppress the in-court \r\n  identification Armstrong made of him.Â  He contends the trial court erred in \r\n  not holding a hearing to determine the reliability of the in-court identification \r\n  and that the identification was unduly suggestive and unreliable.Â  Lewis asserts \r\n  the error in allowing the in-court identification was not harmless. Â We \r\n  hold the trial court did not err in failing to hold a hearing and admitting \r\n  the in-court identification of Lewis.\r\nArmstrong was unable to return to South \r\n  Carolina from Florida before the trial.Â  Therefore, law enforcement had no opportunity \r\n  to conduct a lineup prior to trial to determine if Armstrong could identify \r\n  any of the three assailants.Â  \r\nBefore jury selection Lewisâ€™s counsel asked the court to \r\n  require police or the solicitor to conduct a photo lineup to determine if Armstrong \r\n  could identify his client or, in the alternative, for the court to suppress \r\n  any in-court identification of Lewis.Â  The trial court refused.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Lewis requested an in \r\n  camera hearing prior to Armstrongâ€™s in-court identification.Â  He wanted \r\n  the court to determine whether the identification was reliable.Â  The trial court \r\n  denied Lewisâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nAn in-court identification of an accused \r\n  is inadmissible if an out-of-court confrontation such as a showup, lineup, or \r\n  photo array was so unduly suggestive that it created a very substantial likelihood \r\n  of irreparable misidentification.Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 300 (2001), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ (2002).Â  The United \r\n  States Supreme Court has crafted a two-pronged inquiry for the trial court to \r\n  use in determining the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.Â  Neil \r\n  v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).Â  â€˜â€œ[A] court must first determine whether \r\n  the identification process was unduly suggestive. . . . [It] next must determine \r\n  whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no \r\n  substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.â€™â€Â  State&nbsp;v. Moore, \r\n  343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000) (quoting Curtis v. Commonwealth, \r\n  396 S.E.2d 386, 388 (Va. Ct. App. 1990)).\r\nRecently, the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court has set forth the rule trial courts should use in deciding the \r\n  reliability of in-court identifications.Â  State v. Ramsey, 345 S.C. 607, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 294 (2001).Â  In Ramsey, the Court stated:\r\n\r\nWhere identification is concerned, the general rule is that \r\n  a trial court must hold an in camera hearing when the State offers a \r\n  witness whose testimony identifies the defendant as the person who committed \r\n  the crime, and the defendant challenges the in-court identification as being \r\n  tainted by a previous, illegal identification or confrontation.\r\n\r\nId. at 613, 550 S.E.2d at 297.Â  The Court \r\n  limited this rule to situations where an in-court identification was the product \r\n  of an unlawful confrontation or lineup.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nHowever, in this case the police did not conduct any \r\n  kind of pretrial identification which could have contributed to a misidentification \r\n  of Lewis during trial.Â  Our research reveals no South Carolina case requiring \r\n  a trial court to conduct an in camera hearing to determine the reliability \r\n  of an in-court identification, where law enforcement has conducted no pretrial \r\n  out-of-court identification.Â  Nor has Lewis cited any such case.\r\nâ€œGenerally, the decision to \r\n  admit an eyewitness identification is at the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of such, or the commission of prejudicial \r\n  legal error.â€Â  Moore, at 288, 540 S.E.2d at 448.Â  We find no abuse of \r\n  discretion or prejudicial legal error because the trial court failed to conduct \r\n  a Neil v. Biggers hearing or to suppress Lewisâ€™s in-court identification.\r\nUltimately, the reliability \r\n  and credibility of the in-court identification was a question for the jury, \r\n  as it was the sole judge of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses.Â  \r\n  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  Lewisâ€™s counsel \r\n  subjected Armstrong to extensive cross-examination concerning the accuracy and \r\n  reliability of his in-court identification.Â  Armstrong explained the extent \r\n  of his opportunity to view Lewis at the time of the crime, the degree of attention \r\n  he paid, and the accuracy of his prior description of Lewis. Â In his \r\n  direct testimony, Armstrong unhesitatingly identified Lewis as one of the assailants, \r\n  and even though he admitted that a year and a half had elapsed since the crime, \r\n  he testified he was nevertheless â€œpositiveâ€ about his identification. \r\nTherefore, the trial court committed \r\n  no error on this issue.Â  \r\nII.\r\nLewis additionally argues \r\n  he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court refused to allow him to \r\n  strike a juror previously stricken by his co-defendant.\r\nDuring jury selection Lewis \r\n  exercised peremptory strikes on nine white jurors.Â  His co-defendant, Washington, \r\n  also separately struck nine white jurors, including juror 304, a white female.Â  \r\n  At the end of jury selection, the State requested a Batson \r\n  [2]  hearing.Â  Each defendant separately presented reasons for his respective \r\n  strikes.Â  Washington explained he struck juror 304 because she was a housewife.Â  \r\n  The trial court found several jurors, including juror 304, had been struck for \r\n  reasons not race-neutral or gender-neutral. [3] Â  The parties then began selecting a second \r\n  jury.Â  \r\nJuror 304 was presented again.Â  \r\n  Washington accepted the juror, but Lewis attempted to strike her.Â  At that point, \r\n  the trial court asked the attorneys to approach the bench and told Lewisâ€™s attorney \r\n  he could not strike the juror because the court had already held that the reason \r\n  for the previous strike was pretextual.Â  Lewis therefore accepted the juror.Â  \r\n  After finishing the second jury selection process, Lewis moved to quash the \r\n  jury and re-select another jury because he was not allowed to exercise a peremptory \r\n  strike.Â  The following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Loy [Lewisâ€™s counsel]:Â  Your Honor, my \r\n  motion is to strike the jury and re-pick based on the following, Your Honor:Â  \r\n  Juror Number 304 was called, when she was called I exercised a strike, struck \r\n  her, you called us to sidebar, indicated as you had earlier ruled that that \r\n  was not a race-neutral or gender-neutral strike.\r\n The Court:Â  \r\n  I did.\r\n  Mr. Loy:Â  That I couldnâ€™t strike her for any reason \r\n  whatsoever, and in fact was compelled to seat her on the jury.Â  I didnâ€™t want \r\n  to make the argument there, I attempted to preserve my objection to that instruction \r\n  by saying pursuant to your instruction at the bench.Â  However, Your Honor, I \r\n  think if I have independent grounds to strike her separate and apart from what \r\n  we did last time -- \r\n  The Court:Â  No, sir.Â  You donâ€™t get to pick and choose.Â  \r\n  When you put on there that thatâ€™s the reason you struck her the first time and \r\n  I ruled that was not gender or race neutral, that means you cannot strike her.Â  \r\n  Now, put anything you want to on the record.\r\n  Mr. Loy:Â  Thatâ€™s my argument, Your Honor.Â  My argument \r\n  is that if I have independent reasons for striking her, such as if something \r\n  -- \r\n  The Court:Â  I donâ€™t know what the independent reason \r\n  is.Â  Youâ€™re stuck with what you gave me the first time.Â  I had already ruled \r\n  you couldnâ€™t put her, but Iâ€™ll let you put anything you want to on the record.\r\n  Mr. Loy:Â  I think, You[r] Honor, itâ€™s akin, although \r\n  this is not the case, that if I had heard her in the hallway saying they ought \r\n  to just hang both of those guys and be done with it, that I wouldnâ€™t be compelled \r\n  to seat her on the jury.Â  Thatâ€™s my argument, I think I should have been allowed \r\n  to strike her.\r\n  The Court:Â  Iâ€™ll be glad to let you put down whatever \r\n  independent reason you would have used.\r\n  Mr. Loy:Â  Your Honor, the reason I would have used, \r\n  the reason I would have struck her was based solely on her demeanor when she \r\n  came forward on the manner in which she looked at our table versus the Stateâ€™s \r\n  table entirely independent of what happened during our first jury selection \r\n  process.\r\n  The Court:Â  All right.Â  Anything else?\r\n  Mr. Loy:Â  No.Â  Thatâ€™s it, Your Honor. \r\n  The Court:Â  I deny your motion.Â  Anything further?\r\n  Mr. Loy:Â  Not from [sic] on behalf of Mr. Lewis, Your \r\n  Honor.\r\n\r\nNeither the State nor the defendant \r\n  may exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.Â  \r\n  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998) (citing Batson \r\n  v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), and Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. \r\n  42 (1992)).Â  The United States Supreme Court let individual states fashion a \r\n  remedy for striking a juror based upon race.Â  Batson, 476 U.S. at 99 \r\n  n.24.Â  \r\nIn State v. Jones, 293 \r\n  S.C. 54, 58, 358 S.E.2d 701, 704 (1987), abrogated on other grounds by \r\n  State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995), our Supreme Court \r\n  held that if the trial court finds a Batson violation, â€œthe process of \r\n  selecting the jury shall start de novo.â€Â  The Court stated, â€œmembers \r\n  of the tainted jury and all persons who were struck shall be placed back in \r\n  the jury venire.Â  The jury selection process shall start anew using this â€˜reconstructedâ€™ \r\n  venire.â€Â  Id. at 58 n.3, 358 S.E.2d at 704 n.3.\r\nLater, in State v. Franklin, \r\n  318 S.C. 47, 51, 456 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1995), the Court addressed the procedure \r\n  the trial court should follow when â€œa party attempts to strike from the second \r\n  venire a person previously ruled stricken in violation of Batson.â€Â  The \r\n  Court recognized the de novo jury selection procedure established \r\n  in Jones but held, to protect a venirepersonâ€™s constitutional rights \r\n  and to prevent rewarding a party for improper conduct, that it was not error \r\n  for the trial court to disallow a partyâ€™s second attempt to strike a juror who \r\n  was previously improperly removed from the jury.Â  \r\nHowever, in this case, Lewis \r\n  did not strike juror 304 during the first selection process.Â  His co-defendant \r\n  Washington did.Â  Thus, Lewis argues he should have been able to strike juror \r\n  304, independent of his co-defendantâ€™s earlier actions.Â  Lewis alleges the trial \r\n  court erred in imputing the co-defendantâ€™s unconstitutional strike to him, thereby \r\n  prohibiting Lewis from striking the juror.Â  Moreover, he claims his strike could \r\n  have been for an intervening, independent reason. \r\nThe State contends Franklin \r\n  controls these facts because a defendant does not have the right to repeatedly \r\n  strike a prospective juror on an unconstitutional basis.Â  However, Franklin \r\n  did not address a situation where co-defendants exercise strikes independent \r\n  of each other.Â  In Franklin, the issue facing the Court was the â€œclaimed \r\n  right [of an offending party] to unconstitutionally strike a prospective juror \r\n  over and over again . . . .â€Â  Id. at 54, 456 S.E.2d at 361.Â  The Court \r\n  reasoned that allowing the trial court the discretion to seat an improper juror \r\n  prevented â€œâ€˜giv[ing] the offending party exactly what he wanted, namely,â€™ a \r\n  jury panel which unconstitutionally excludes a particular juror.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 53, 456 S.E.2d at 360 (quoting People v. Moten, 603 N.Y.S.2d 940, \r\n  947 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1993)).Â  \r\nHere, Lewis was not the â€œoffending \r\n  party.â€Â  Lewis did not strike juror 304 during the first selection process.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, there is no evidence Lewis attempted to strike the juror on an \r\n  unconstitutional basis during the second selection process.Â  The trial courtâ€™s \r\n  discretionary remedy for an improper peremptory strike must not infringe on \r\n  either the jurorâ€™s or the defendantâ€™s constitutional rights.Â  Id. at \r\n  53, 456 S.E.2d at 360.Â  Lewis is constitutionally entitled to a fair and impartial \r\n  jury.Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14; see State v. Harris, 340 S.C. \r\n  59, 62, 530 S.E.2d 626, 627 (2000) (â€œThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of \r\n  the United States Constitution guarantee a defendant a fair trial by a panel \r\n  of impartial and indifferent jurors.â€).Â  Lewisâ€™s entitlement to an impartial \r\n  jury was not met where the trial court prohibited Lewis from striking a juror \r\n  he had not previously challenged.\r\nMoreover, Lewis presented an \r\n  intervening, independent reason to strike the juror.Â  See Franklin, \r\n  318 S.C. at 54, 456 S.E.2d at 361 (stating a defendant is â€œnot prohibited from \r\n  bringing to light facts justifying striking the prospective juror which arose \r\n  after the initial Batson hearingâ€).Â  Lewis stated he attempted to strike \r\n  the juror because of her demeanor when she came forward.Â  However, the trial \r\n  court did not even consider Lewisâ€™s explanation for the attempted strike, given \r\n  the courtâ€™s earlier ruling that Lewis was â€œstuck with what [he] gave [the trial \r\n  court] the first time.â€Â  This was error.Â  Because Lewis did not strike the juror \r\n  the first time, he should have been allowed to strike the juror the second time, \r\n  subject to scrutiny by the court only if the State moved for a Batson \r\n  hearing.Â  He should also have been allowed to present evidence concerning an \r\n  intervening reason and had the trial court rule on that.Â  \r\nThe State contends the trial \r\n  court â€œproperly refused to allow Lewis to use subterfuge to discriminate against \r\n  juror [number 304] for a second time.â€Â  There is no evidence the reason advanced \r\n  by Lewis to strike the juror was â€œsubterfuge.â€ Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court should have \r\n  allowed Lewis to exercise a peremptory challenge during the second selection \r\n  process given Lewis had not already stricken the juror and may have had an intervening \r\n  reason to later strike the juror.Â  Lewis should not have been held responsible \r\n  for the unconstitutional strike exercised by his co-defendant.Â  Cf. State \r\n  v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 238 S.E.2d 678 (1977) (finding the objections \r\n  of one defendant are not imputable to a co-defendant).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of Lewisâ€™s motion to hold an in camera hearing to determine the reliability \r\n  of an in-court identification is affirmed.Â  However, based on the foregoing \r\n  analysis concerning the jury selection, we reverse and remand this case for \r\n  a new trial.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs and ANDERSON, \r\n  J., dissents in separate opinion.\r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  The majority concludes the trial court did not err by denying Lewisâ€™s \r\n  request for an in camera hearing and the trial court should have allowed \r\n  Lewis to strike a previously stricken juror.Â  I disagree.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n On June 21, 1999, Jane Doe \r\n  [4]  and Gill Armstrong were traveling from Virginia to their home in Florida \r\n  with their infant daughter.Â  They checked in at the Economy Inn off I-95 in \r\n  St. George around 11:00 p.m.Â  Leaving Doe and the infant daughter in the hotel \r\n  room, Armstrong went to the Huddle House to pickup food.Â  When he returned, \r\n  he noticed three men standing in the breezeway near his room.Â  Assuming they \r\n  were hotel guests, Armstrong proceeded to his room and was not suspicious of \r\n  their presence.Â  After putting the food in the hotel room, Armstrong went back \r\n  outside to the nearby soda machines without completely closing his door.\r\nAt the soda machines, a man whom Armstrong \r\n  identified as Timothy Washington placed a gun to his head.Â  Gerrod Lewis and \r\n  Shermaine Elmore accompanied Washington.Â  Armstrong recognized the three men \r\n  as the same men he had seen in the breezeway a few minutes earlier.Â  Washington \r\n  demanded to go to Armstrongâ€™s hotel room.\r\nAs the men entered the hotel room, Doe \r\n  was getting out of the shower clad only in a towel.Â  The infant daughter was \r\n  asleep on the bed.Â  The men wanted money.Â  When they realized Armstrong and \r\n  Doe had only fourteen dollars, they became enraged and searched the room. \r\n  Â Once they could not find anything of value, Lewis and co-defendant Washington \r\n  took turns sexually assaulting Doe in the bedroom while co-defendant Elmore \r\n  held Armstrong at gunpoint in the bathroom.Â  Then Washington took Doe into the \r\n  bathroom and sexually assaulted her in front of Armstrong.Â  After sexually assaulting \r\n  Doe, the men took Armstrongâ€™s keys and stole his car.Â  The car was found burned \r\n  a few days later near St. George.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\nI.Â  Did the trial court err by failing to suppress Armstrongâ€™s \r\n  identification of Lewis?\r\nII. Did the trial court err in refusing to allow Lewis to \r\n  strike a previously stricken juror?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Identification of Lewis\r\nLewis argues he is entitled to a new trial because \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to suppress Armstrongâ€™s in-court identification \r\n  of him.Â  Lewis contends the identification was unduly suggestive and unreliable, \r\n  and the error was not harmless. Â I disagree.\r\nA.Â  Line-up\r\nLewis asserts the trial judgeâ€™s failure to suppress \r\n  the identification was error because the State refused to conduct a non-suggestive \r\n  lineup before the defendant was brought into the courtroom for trial.Â  I find \r\n  this argument has no merit.Â  \r\nBefore trial, Lewis made a motion to either require a photographic \r\n  lineup or suppress any identification of him.Â  In connection with the photographic \r\n  lineup, his counsel stated,\r\n\r\nWe think as a matter of fundamental fairness [the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  office] should have done a lineup, either live or in person. . . . They should \r\n  still be compelled to do a photographic lineup.Â  Itâ€™s not something we have \r\n  the opportunity to do, obviously as defense, but I do think as a matter of due \r\n  process and fundamental fairness they should have done that.\r\n\r\nIn denying the motion for a photographic lineup, \r\n  the trial judge explained, â€œI canâ€™t require the solicitors or the police officers \r\n  to do a photo lineup.Â  You know, in many cases thereâ€™s not a photo lineup.Â  \r\n  And I donâ€™t know of any law that would require them to do it, so I have to deny \r\n  your motion legally.â€Â  \r\nI agree with the trial judge.Â  There is neither \r\n  a law requiring the solicitor to conduct a photographic lineup, nor a law allowing \r\n  the judge to order one.Â  Thus, this issue has no merit.\r\nB.Â  InÂ  Camera \r\n  Hearing\r\nLewis alleges the trial court erred by denying \r\n  his request for an in camera hearing to determine the reliability of \r\n  Armstrongâ€™s identification of him in court.Â  I agree.\r\nThe issue posited is novel.Â  Precedentially and \r\n  by rule language the issue of pre-trial mandatory in camera \r\n  hearings for identification evidence is extant.Â  Here, we analyze and decide \r\n  whether an in camera hearing is mandatory in regard to identification \r\n  evidence that relates solely to an in-court identification.\r\nWhen Lewisâ€™s motion to compel a lineup was denied, he asked \r\n  for an in camera hearing prior to the identification being made before \r\n  the jury.Â  The trial court denied Lewisâ€™s motion:\r\n\r\n[Lewisâ€™s counsel]:Â  My re-request at this point is for an \r\n  in camera hearing prior to them doing that so the Court can make its own determination \r\n  as to whether or not thatâ€™s a reliable identification.Â  If itâ€™s so unreliable \r\n  under the circumstances, they shouldnâ€™t allow --\r\nThe Court:Â  That means Iâ€™m going to have to try the case \r\n  twice, which Iâ€™m not going to do.Â  Youâ€™ve got your right to move during the \r\n  trial at any time to suppress any evidence or identification.Â  Iâ€™m not going \r\n  to have a hearing beforehand.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe standard for determining the admissibility of a[n] \r\n  . . . identification is â€˜whether the identification procedure â€œwas so impermissibly \r\n  suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€â€™ \r\n  â€Â  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 228, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (citing State v. Gambrell, 274 S.C. 587, 590, 266 S.E.2d 78, 80 \r\n  (1980); see also Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. \r\n  967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968)).Â  â€œA criminal defendant may be deprived of due \r\n  process of law by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive \r\n  and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.â€Â  State v. Blassingame, \r\n  338 S.C. 240, 251, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Stovall v. \r\n  Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. at 228, 522 S.E.2d at 851-52).\r\nIn Patterson, we stated:\r\n\r\nSome general guidelines emerge from these [pre-trial identification] \r\n  cases as to the relationship between suggestiveness and misidentification.Â  \r\n  It is, first of all, apparent that the primary evil to be avoided is â€œa very \r\n  substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€ . . . While the phrase \r\n  was coined as a standard for determining whether an in-court identification \r\n  would be admissible in the wake of a suggestive out-of-court identification, \r\n  with the deletion of â€œirreparableâ€ it serves equally well as a standard for \r\n  the admissibility of testimony concerning the out-of-court identification itself.Â  \r\n  It is the likelihood of misidentification which violates a defendantâ€™s right \r\n  to due process. . . . Suggestive confrontations are disapproved because they \r\n  increase the likelihood of misidentification, and unnecessarily suggestive ones \r\n  are condemned for the further reason that the increased chance of misidentification \r\n  is gratuitous.\r\n\r\n337 S.C. at 228-9, 522 S.E.2d at 852 (quoting Neil v. \r\n  Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972)) (brackets in original).\r\nIn State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000), this court articulated the rule:\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an identification is reliable, it is \r\n  necessary to consider the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers: 1) the \r\n  opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; 2) \r\n  the witnessâ€™s degree of attention; 3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description \r\n  of the criminal; 4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the \r\n  confrontation; and 5) the amount of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  \r\n  The corrupting effect of a suggestive identification is to be weighed against \r\n  these factors.Â  After the trial court determines the witnessâ€™s identification \r\n  is reliable, the witness is permitted to testify before the jury.Â  \r\n\r\nMansfield, 343 S.C. at 78-79, 538 S.E.2d at 263 (internal \r\n  citations omitted). \r\n In U.S. v. Hill, 967 F.2d 226 (6th \r\n  Cir. 1992), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held the factors in Neil v. \r\n  Biggers apply to in-court identifications as well as pre-trial identifications.Â  \r\n  The court elucidated:\r\n\r\nIn this case, the court had to make an ex ante determination \r\n  of whether to allow a witness, who had never before positively identified the \r\n  defendant in person, to make an identification in court.Â  We hold that the Biggers \r\n  analysis applies to such in-court identifications for the same reasons that \r\n  the analysis applies to impermissibly suggestive pre-trial identifications.Â  \r\n  The due process concerns are identical in both cases and any attempt to draw \r\n  a line based on the time the allegedly suggestive identification technique takes \r\n  place seems arbitrary.Â  All of the concerns that underlie the Biggers \r\n  analysis, including the degree of suggestiveness, the chance of mistake, and \r\n  the threat of due process are no less applicable when the identification takes \r\n  place for the first time at trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 232.\r\nâ€œ[While] there was no obligation to stage a lineup, . . \r\n  . there was, however, an obligation to ensure that the in-court procedure here \r\n  did not simply amount to a show-up.â€Â  U.S. v.

Simmons, 308 S.C. 80, 83, 417 S.E.2d 92, 94 (1992) (citing Chapman \r\n  v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)); see \r\n  also Cheatham, 349 S.C. at 117, 561 S.E.2d at 627 (stating Simmons \r\n  rule that harmless error rule may be applicable if identification is corroborated \r\n  by either circumstantial or direct evidence).\r\nIn State v. Ramsey, 345 S.C. 607, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  294 (2001), the defendant did not challenge the testimony of three witnesses \r\n  who testified they had â€œno doubtâ€ Ramsey was wearing a striped sweater on the \r\n  day of the murder.Â  Id. at 614, 550 S.E.2d at 298.Â  Given this direct \r\n  evidence, our supreme court held that failure to conduct an in camera \r\n  hearing was harmless error.\r\nSimilarly in the present case, there was direct \r\n  evidence that corroborated Armstrongâ€™s identification of Lewis.Â  Even without \r\n  Armstrongâ€™s testimony, the State presented co-defendant Elmore who testified \r\n  in detail about Lewisâ€™s involvement in the crime.Â  Elmore said that he, Lewis, \r\n  and Washington had walked to the Economy Inn from a nearby convenience store.Â  \r\n  He verified the details of the occurrence in the hotel room, including the fact \r\n  that Lewis sexually assaulted Doe.Â  Thus, even though the trial judge erred \r\n  in not conducting the in camera hearing, the error was harmless and does \r\n  not require reversal. \r\nII.Â  Viability \r\n  of Previously Stricken Juror\r\nLewis claims he is entitled to a new trial based \r\n  on the courtâ€™s refusal to allow him to strike a previously stricken juror.Â  \r\n  I disagree.\r\n During jury selection, Lewisâ€™s counsel struck \r\n  nine white jurors.Â  Co-defendant Washingtonâ€™s counsel also struck nine white \r\n  jurors, including juror number 304, a white female.Â  At the end of the selection, \r\n  the State requested a Batson [5]  hearing.Â  Lewis and Washingtonâ€™s attorneys \r\n  separately presented their reasons for each of the strikes.Â  The State argued \r\n  the explanations were a pretext for purposeful discrimination.Â  The judge found \r\n  that several jurors, including juror number 304, had been struck for pretextual \r\n  reasons.\r\n\r\nJuror number 304 was called again when the second \r\n  jury was selected.Â  Washingtonâ€™s attorney accepted the juror, but Lewisâ€™s attorney \r\n  attempted to strike her.Â  At that point, the trial judge asked the attorneys \r\n  to approach the bench and told Lewisâ€™s lawyer he could not strike juror number \r\n  304 for any reason.Â  Lewisâ€™s lawyer then accepted the juror.Â  After the jury \r\n  was excused, Lewisâ€™s counsel moved to strike the jury and re-pick because he \r\n  was denied his right to exercise a peremptory strike.Â  The following colloquy \r\n  occurred:\r\nMr. Loy [Lewisâ€™s counsel]:Â  Your Honor, my motion is to \r\n  strike the jury and re-pick based on the following, Your Honor:Â  Juror Number \r\n  304 was called, when she was called I exercised a strike, struck her, you called \r\n  us to sidebar, indicated as you had earlier ruled that that was not a race or \r\n  gender-neutral strike.\r\nThe Court: I did.\r\nMr. Loy: That I couldnâ€™t strike her for any reason whatsoever, \r\n  and in fact was compelled to seat her on the jury.Â  I didnâ€™t want to make the \r\n  argument there, I attempted to preserve my objection to that instruction by \r\n  saying pursuant to your instruction at the bench.Â  However, Your Honor, I think \r\n  if I have independent grounds to strike her separate and apart from what we \r\n  did last time â€“\r\nThe Court: No, sir.Â  You donâ€™t get to pick and choose.Â  \r\n  When you put on there that thatâ€™s the reason you struck her the first time and \r\n  I ruled that was not gender or race neutral, that means you cannot strike her.Â  \r\n  Now, put anything you want to on the record. Â  \r\nMr. Loy: Thatâ€™s my argument, Your Honor.Â  My argument is \r\n  that if I have independent reasons for striking her, such as if something â€“ \r\n\r\nThe Court: I donâ€™t know what the independent reason is.Â  \r\n  Youâ€™re stuck with what you gave me the first time.Â  I had already ruled you \r\n  couldnâ€™t put her, but Iâ€™ll let you put anything you want to on the record.\r\nMr. Loy: I think, You[r] Honor, itâ€™s akin, although this \r\n  is not the case, that if I had heard her in the hallway saying they ought to \r\n  just hang both of those guys and be done with it, that I wouldnâ€™t be compelled \r\n  to seat her on the jury.Â  Thatâ€™s my argument, I think I should have been allowed \r\n  to strike her.\r\nThe Court: Iâ€™ll be glad to let you put down whatever independent \r\n  reason you would have used.\r\nMr. Loy: Your Honor, the reason I would have used, the reason \r\n  I would have struck her was based solely on her demeanor when she came forward \r\n  on the manner in which she looked at our table versus the Stateâ€™s table entirely \r\n  independent of what happened during our first jury selection process.\r\nThe Court: All right.Â  Anything else?\r\nMr. Loy: No.Â  Thatâ€™s it, Your Honor.\r\nThe Court: I deny your motion.Â  Anything further?\r\nMr. Loy: Not from [sic] on behalf of Mr. Lewis, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nIn Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 80 \r\n  (1986), the United States Supreme Court declared striking a juror solely on \r\n  the basis of race is unconstitutional.Â  Batson left the remedy for striking \r\n  a juror based only upon race to each state.Â  Batson, 476 U.S. at 99, \r\n  n. 24.Â  South Carolina first addressed the remedy for Batson violations \r\n  in State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987) (abrogated on \r\n  other grounds by State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995)).Â  \r\n  In Jones, our supreme court held that when there is a Batson violation, \r\n  the jury shall be quashed and â€œthe process of selecting the jury shall start \r\n  de novo.â€ Jones, 293 S.C. at 58, 358 S.E.2d at 704.Â  The court stated \r\n  â€œmembers of the tainted jury and all persons who were struck shall be placed \r\n  back in the jury venire [and] [t]he jury selection process shall start anew \r\n  using this â€˜reconstructedâ€™ venire.â€Â  Id. at 58, n. 3, 358 S.E.2d at 704, \r\n  n. 3. \r\nIn State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 \r\n  S.E.2d 357 (1995), our supreme court addressed the procedure when a party attempts \r\n  to strike from the second venire a person previously stricken in violation of \r\n  Batson.Â  The court noted â€œ[t]he majority of jurisdictions addressing \r\n  the question of whether the trial judge may seat a juror improperly excluded \r\n  in violation of Batson have found no error in seating such a juror.Â  \r\n  The rationale for allowing the trial judge the discretion to seat the improper \r\n  juror is sound.â€Â  Franklin, 318 S.C. at 52, 456 S.E.2d at 360.Â  The court \r\n  quoted People v. Moten, 603 N.Y.S.2d 940 (1993) as follows:\r\n\r\nTo hold otherwise would inadvisably reward a party for his \r\n  own improper conduct, as would the declaration of a mistrial, which, in my view \r\n  is an inappropriate remedy where the court is confronted with a valid Batson \r\n  . . . challenge.Â  The declaration of a mistrial, as an alternative to a difficult \r\n  decision involving a remedy for a Batson . . . violation, merely avoids \r\n  the critical issue and is inappropriate since such a declaration would give \r\n  the offending party exactly what he wanted, namely, a different jury panel.Â  \r\n  Thus, it would reward him for the very discrimination which Batson . \r\n  . . [was] designed to prevent.Â  \r\n\r\nFranklin, 318 S.C. at 52, 456 S.E.2d at 360 (quoting \r\n  Moten, 603 N.Y.S.2d at 947) (brackets in original).\r\nThe court further noted that â€œthe defendantâ€™s \r\n  constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury is [not] in any way violated \r\n  by this procedure.â€Â  Id. at 53, 456 S.E.2d at 360.Â  The court held that \r\n  â€œonce a new venire has been selected . . . it is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion \r\n  to fashion the appropriate remedy under the particular facts of each case and, \r\n  as long as neither partyâ€™s constitutional rights are infringed, that remedy \r\n  may include the seating of an improperly challenged juror.â€Â  Id. at 53, \r\n  456 S.E.2d at 360 (citing Jefferson v. State, 595 So.2d 38, 41 (Fla. \r\n  1992)).\r\n In the present case, the jury selection process \r\n  began anew after the first jury was set aside.Â  Lewis does not challenge the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s ruling that juror number 304 was first stricken in violation of \r\n  Batson.Â  Instead, he professes he had an independent reason for striking \r\n  the juror during the second jury selection, namely â€œher demeanor when she came \r\n  forward on the manner in which she looked at our table versus the Stateâ€™s table \r\n  entirely independent of what happened during our first jury selection process.â€\r\nThe trial judge should have allowed Lewis to state on the \r\n  record his reason(s) for wanting to strike the juror during the second jury \r\n  selection and not after the jury selection was completed.Â  However, there was \r\n  no error in seating the juror.Â  Lewis was not denied his peremptory challenge.Â  \r\n  Instead, he was prohibited from exercising it in a racially discriminatory manner.Â  \r\n  The trial judge properly refused to allow Lewis to discriminate against juror \r\n  number 304 during the second jury selection.Â  Further, I find no evidence that \r\n  Lewis suffered any prejudice from having juror number 304 on the jury.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  To protect the female victimâ€™s identity, she has been referred to \r\n    as Jane Doe.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Batson v.

Trooper, why did you get the individuals that were inside \r\n  the van out?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my protection and their protection.\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What were you going to do when you got them out?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a routine pat down.\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pat down?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry frisk, okay.Â  Did you check the passenger?Â  \r\n  Did you attempt to check the passenger for weapons or a weapon?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes sir, I did.\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened after you attempted to check for weapons?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passenger, Mr. Butler fled on foot.\r\nQ:Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the result of your check of him or your pat \r\n  down of him?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just his outer clothes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    *&nbsp; \r\n    *&nbsp; \r\n    *&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you do and what did you find?Â  Did you feel \r\n  anything?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.Â  During my pat down I patted down the pocket \r\n  and outside the pocket, and I felt what felt like to be a pistol.Â  And at that \r\n  time, he took off running.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    *&nbsp; \r\n    *&nbsp; \r\n    *&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Y]ou got the individuals out for a pat down because \r\n  there were other ones there?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.\r\nQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  I had suspicion that there was alcohol in the van \r\n  from the traffic stop.\r\n\r\nDuring cross-examination of Officer Cook, he testified \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  [W]as [Butler] doing anything wrong, that you could \r\n  see, in the van . . . when he was sitting there?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Well, I was in the process of investigating.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  But was he doing anything wrong to cause you to investigate him, sit \r\n  down in the front seat?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  I mean - -\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  What was he doing but sitting there?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Well, you know, I smelled alcohol.Â  I thought it was coming from inside \r\n  the van, and thatâ€™s what - - if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re asking me.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  What was this man doing?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  I was investigating further.\r\n\r\nWhen asked on re-direct why he removed Butler \r\n  from the van, Officer Cook indicated that the driver had given him an incorrect \r\n  name for the passenger, and that there were â€œa lot of suspicions going on.â€Â  \r\n  Officer Cook stated that he could not see what Butler was doing inside the van \r\n  and when asked why that was a danger he stated: â€œBecause the driver, when I \r\n  asked the driver about the alcohol, if thereâ€™s anything in the van, he stated \r\n  to me no, there was not, and he gave me the passenger - - or a different name \r\n  than what the passengerâ€™s real name was.â€Â  He further stated that in order to \r\n  ascertain whether anybody in the van had a weapon or was a threat to him he \r\n  had to â€œ[g]et each one of them out and talk to them and pat them down.â€\r\nButler argued Officer Cook did not have reasonable \r\n  suspicion to conduct a search of Butler, and moved to suppress any evidence \r\n  which resulted from the search.Â  The trial court determined that Officer Cook \r\n  â€œwas entitled to at least ask the passengers to vacate the van and do a pat \r\n  down search beforeâ€ using his flashlight to look in the van because he had a \r\n  â€œreasonable suspicion of criminal activity, i.e., the smell of alcohol.â€Â  The \r\n  trial court further stated he didnâ€™t think Officer Cook was afraid of Butler, \r\n  but believed Cook conducted the pat down search as part of his continuing investigation \r\n  for open containers in the van.Â  The court therefore ruled the officer had a \r\n  reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on the smell of alcohol coming \r\n  from the van, and the officer was therefore entitled to conduct a search for \r\n  an open container and remove the passengers from the vehicle.\r\nOfficer Cook testified in the presence of the \r\n  jury, that when he searched Butler and found the gun, Butler ran away into some \r\n  woods.Â  Officer Cook shortly thereafter apprehended Butler and seized a large \r\n  bag of cocaine and $863.00 from Butlerâ€™s pantsâ€™ pocket, as well as the pistol \r\n  from his jacket pocket.\r\nThe jury found Butler guilty of trafficking in \r\n  cocaine and unlawful possession of a pistol.Â  Butler appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to \r\n  review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial court's factual findings \r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  This same standard of review applies to \r\n  preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence \r\n  in criminal cases.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, \r\n  829 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  â€œOur review in â€œFourth amendment search and \r\n  seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s finding.â€Â  State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 219 n. 3, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  896, 898 n. 3 (Ct. App. 2000) (relying on State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. \r\n  57, 528 S.E.2d 661 (2000)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nButler argues the trial court erred in finding \r\n  there was reasonable suspicion to justify a warrantless search under Terry \r\n  v. Ohio, [1]  and in failing to suppress the evidence obtained \r\n  as a result of the search of Butler.Â  We agree.\r\n  The Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œ[t]he right of \r\n  the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \r\n  unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  â€œThe Fourth Amendment \r\n  does not proscribe all contact between police and citizens, but is designed \r\n  â€˜to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with \r\n  the privacy and personal security of individuals.â€™â€Â  INS v. Delgado, \r\n  466 U.S. 210, 215, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1762 (1984) (quoting United States v. \r\n  Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3081, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 \r\n  (1976)).Â  The stopping of a vehicle and the detention of its occupants constitutes \r\n  a seizure and implicates the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against unreasonable \r\n  searches and seizures.Â  Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653-54, 99 \r\n  S.Ct. 1391, 1396 (1979).Â  â€œA police officer may stop and briefly detain and \r\n  question a person for investigative purposes, without treading upon his Fourth \r\n  Amendment rights, when the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable \r\n  facts, short of probable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal \r\n  activity.â€Â  State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the circumstances \r\n  must be considered as a whole, and if the officerâ€™s suspicions are confirmed \r\n  or further aroused, the stop may be prolonged and the scope enlarged.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The scope and the duration of the seizure must be strictly tied to and justified \r\n  by the circumstances which rendered its initiation proper.Â  Sikes v. State, \r\n  323 S.C. 28, 30, 448 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1994).\r\nObserving that traffic stops may be dangerous encounters \r\n  for police officers, the United States Supreme Court has held that once a motor \r\n  vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers \r\n  may order the driver and passengers to get out of the vehicle without violating \r\n  the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s proscription of unreasonable seizures.Â  Maryland v. \r\n  Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 412-15, 117 S.Ct. 882, 885-86 (1997).Â  Under the mandates \r\n  of Terry, however, a police officer must have a reasonable suspicion \r\n  that an individual is armed and dangerous before conducting a pat down or frisk \r\n  of the person.Â  Terry, 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883.Â  The question \r\n  is whether â€œa reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted \r\n  in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  See also Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 373, 113 S.Ct. \r\n  2130, 2136 (1993) ( when an officer is justified in believing the individual \r\n  whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently \r\n  dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a pat-down search \r\n  to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon;Â  purpose ofÂ  limited \r\n  search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue \r\n  his investigation without fear of violence);Â  Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. \r\n  325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1097 (1990) ( limited pat-down for weapons is authorized \r\n  where a reasonably prudent officer would be warranted in the belief, based on \r\n  specific and articulable facts, and not on a mere inchoate and unparticularized \r\n  suspicion or hunch, that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual).\r\nIt is undisputed Officer Cook had reasonable suspicion \r\n  to stop the vehicle in which Butler was a passenger, based on the traffic violation.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Officer Cook was justified in extending the scope and duration \r\n  of the traffic stop based on his suspicion that open containers of alcohol may \r\n  have been in the van.Â  It is also clear the officer could order the driver and \r\n  passengers to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s \r\n  proscription of unreasonable seizures.Â  The question before us, however, is \r\n  whether Officer Cook had reasonable suspicion to conduct a pat-down or frisk \r\n  of Butler.\r\n\r\n[B]efore the police may frisk a defendant, they must have \r\n  a reasonable belief the defendant is armed and dangerous.Â  Ybarra v. Illinois, \r\n  444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979).Â  In other words, a reasonable \r\n  person in the position of the officer must believe the frisk was necessary to \r\n  preserve the officerâ€™s safety.Â  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, \r\n  20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).Â  An officer must be able to specify the particular facts \r\n  on which he or she based his or her belief the suspect was armed and dangerous.Â  \r\n  Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968) \r\n  (an officer is not entitled to seize and search every person on the street;Â  \r\n  mere knowledge of the suspect being a known narcotics dealer who put his or \r\n  her hand into a pocket as the police approached does not provide justification);Â  \r\n  cf. United States v. Moore, 817 F.2d 1105 (4th Cir. 1987) (justification \r\n  found where suspect was observed in the vicinity of a building late at night, \r\n  shortly after the alarm sounds, and the street is dark, the officer is alone, \r\n  and the suspected crime is burglary), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 965, 108 \r\n  S.Ct. 456, 98 L.Ed.2d 396 (1987).\r\n\r\nState v. Fowler, 322 S.C. 263, 267, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  706, 708 (Ct. App. 1996);Â  see also State v. Burton 349 \r\n  S.C. 430, 439, 562 S.E.2d 668, 673 (Ct. App. 2002) (once a basis for a lawful \r\n  investigatory stop exists, an officer may protect himself during the stop by \r\n  conducting a frisk for weapons if he has reason to believe the suspect is armed \r\n  and dangerous;Â  in justifying the intrusion, the officer must be able to point \r\n  to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences \r\n  from those facts, reasonably warrant the intrusion).\r\nNoting that â€œ[t]he indisputable nexus between \r\n  drugs and guns presumptively creates a reasonable suspicion of dangerâ€ to an \r\n  officer, the United States Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has found that where \r\n  an officer has reasonable suspicion that drugs are present in a vehicle lawfully \r\n  stopped, there is an appropriate level of suspicion of criminal activity and \r\n  apprehension of danger to justify a pat-down or frisk of both the driver and \r\n  the passengers.Â  U.S. v. Sakyi, 160 F.3d 164, 169-70 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1998).Â  Thus, the court held, â€œin connection with a lawful traffic stop \r\n  of an automobile, when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that illegal drugs \r\n  are in the vehicle, the officer may, in the absence of factors allaying his \r\n  safety concerns, order the occupants out of the vehicle and pat them down briefly \r\n  for weapons to ensure the officerâ€™s safety and the safety of others.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 169.Â  Additionally, our court has found reasonable suspicion existed for \r\n  an officer to conduct a pat down search of an individual under a variety of \r\n  circumstances where the officer articulated sufficient facts to justify the \r\n  search.Â  See e.g., State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 249, 525 \r\n  S.E.2d 535, 540 (Ct. App. 1999) (frisk by officer was proper under the circumstances \r\n  because a reasonably prudent man, when faced with a man who met the description \r\n  of an armed carjacker, kidnapper, and robber who could not satisfactorily explain \r\n  why he was in the area, would be warranted in a belief that his safety was in \r\n  danger);Â  State v. Smith, 329 S.C. 550, 495 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App.1998) \r\n  (finding reasonable suspicion individual might be armed and dangerous, justifying \r\n  a pat down, where officer stated the driver was acting a little bit edgy, fidgeting \r\n  and looking around on the inside like he was looking for a weapon, such that \r\n  he thought for officer safety he should remove him from the vehicle to keep \r\n  him away from any weapons opportunity);Â  State v. Lesley, 326 S.C. 641, \r\n  644, 486 S.E.2d 276, 277 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding officer could reasonably have \r\n  believed driver of a brown Honda would be armed and dangerous where the officer \r\n  â€œunderstood the following from the information related to him by the dispatcher \r\n  and his own observations:Â  (1) a female complainant had two days earlier reported \r\n  a shooting incident to the police; (2) the complainant saw two black males in \r\n  two separate cars drive by her home; (3) she described one automobile as a brown-colored \r\n  Honda bearing paper tags that advertised Breakaway; (4) the driver in each car \r\n  had made a gesture toward her; (5) she felt their actions were connected with \r\n  the shooting incident; (6) there could be weapons on the driversâ€™ persons or \r\n  in their cars; and (7) a brown-colored Honda equipped with Breakaway paper tags \r\n  and driven by a black male was in the area where the cars were reported as having \r\n  been seen.â€).\r\nHere, the trial court failed to make any determination that \r\n  the officer had the necessary apprehension of danger to justify a pat-down search \r\n  of Butler.Â  Indeed, the trial court found the officer had no fear of Butler, \r\n  but was merely continuing his investigation of a possible open container violation. \r\n  [2] Â  Clearly, the trial court improperly assumed if the officer was entitled \r\n  to remove Butler from the vehicle in furtherance of his investigation, he was \r\n  automatically entitled to frisk the passenger.Â  The law is settled, though, \r\n  that there must be a showing that the officer had a reasonable fear for himself \r\n  or for the safety of others to justify the greater intrusion of a pat-down.\r\nThe appellate court, however, does not review the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s determination de novo, but applies a deferential standard \r\n  of review, and will reverse only if there is clear error in its ruling.Â  State \r\n  v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 572 S.E.2d 456 (2002).Â  Thus, this court \r\n  will affirm if there is any evidence to support the decision, regardless of \r\n  the basis of the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Id.Â  In accessing whether a suspect \r\n  is armed and dangerous, the officer need not be absolutely certain the individual \r\n  is armed; rather the question is whether a reasonably prudent person in those \r\n  circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others \r\n  is in danger.Â  Id.Â  The officer must be able to point to specific articulable \r\n  facts which, taken together with reasonable inferences, reasonably warrant the \r\n  intrusion.Â  Id.\r\nTurning to the facts of this case, we find Officer Cook \r\n  failed to articulate any facts indicating he believed Butler was armed and dangerous, \r\n  or that he feared for his safety or that of others.Â  Officer Cook merely stated \r\n  he was suspicious.Â  He did not indicate what his specific suspicions were and, \r\n  particularly, did not indicate he was suspicious that Butler was armed or dangerous.Â  \r\n  The only basis for any suspicion he had was that he smelled alcohol and the \r\n  driver had provided him with an incorrect name for the passenger. \r\n  [3] Â  See State v. Burton, 349 S.C. at 440, 562 S.E.2d at \r\n  673 (where only activity detective pointed to as â€œsuspiciousâ€ was individualâ€™s \r\n  refusal to answer questions and fact that individual kept his right hand in \r\n  his coat pocket, detective failed to articulate valid reasonable suspicion for \r\n  stop and search of individual, in spite of detectiveâ€™s testimony he feared for \r\n  safety of those around him).Â  Further, this case does not involve a heightened \r\n  apprehension of danger based upon a reasonable suspicion of drug activity, allowing \r\n  the conclusion that guns would likely be present.Â  Finally, although Officer \r\n  Cook indicated he would have to remove all the passengers from the van and frisk \r\n  them in order to ascertain whether anyone in the van had a weapon or was a threat \r\n  to him, he failed to specify the particular facts upon which he based any fear \r\n  that the passengers were armed and dangerous.Â  See U.S. v. Sakyi, \r\n  160 F.3d at 168-69 (generalized risk to officer safety is insufficient to justify \r\n  a routine pat-down of all passengers as a matter of course). Accordingly, we find that Officer Cookâ€™s \r\n  search of Butler was unlawful and that the trial court erred in failing to suppress \r\n  the evidence that resulted from the search.Â  See State v. Copeland, \r\n  321 S.C. 318, 323, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996) (â€œThe â€˜fruit of the poisonous \r\n  treeâ€™ doctrine provides that evidence must be excluded if it would not have \r\n  come to light but for the illegal actions of the police, and the evidence has \r\n  been obtained by the exploitation of that illegality.â€).\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and SHULER JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Â Â See State v.
