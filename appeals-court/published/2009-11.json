Bannister, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Mark Craft contends\r\n  the trial court erred in finding he did not demonstrate the elements necessary\r\n  to recover under a theory of promissory estoppel.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCraft\r\n  received a vending license from the South Carolina Commission for the Blind\r\n  (Commission) in 1981 and began working as a blind licensed vendor (vendor) in\r\n  Florence that same year.[1]Â \r\n  Craft, who has lived with his mother his entire life, continued to work as a\r\n  vendor in Florence until he and his mother moved to Anderson in 1991.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Craft accepted successive positions as a vendor at a welcome center\r\n  in Fair Play, a rest stop in Anderson, and ultimately, at the county square in\r\n  Greenville.Â  \r\nIn 2005,\r\n  while working at Greenville County Square, Craft received a bid notice from the\r\n  Commission, informing him of new vending sites available through the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Corrections.Â  In the bid notice, the Commission informed\r\n  all interested vendors that it did not guarantee income at any location, it\r\n  could cancel the bid, and it could make adjustments to the bid as necessary.Â \r\n  After having his mother read the bid notice to him, Craft submitted a bid to\r\n  the Commission for a vending position at Perry Correctional Institution\r\n  (Perry).Â  In September 2005, Bill Holland, Craft's counselor with the\r\n  Commission, called Craft and offered him the position at Perry, which Craft\r\n  accepted.Â  Following his conversation with Holland, Barbara Skinner, the Business\r\n  Enterprise Program Director for the Commission, sent Craft a letter, confirming\r\n  his selection as the vendor at Perry.Â  According to the bid notice, Craft was\r\n  scheduled to begin work at Perry in November 2005 or March 2006.Â  \r\nPursuant to rules\r\n  promulgated by the Commission, a vendor can only operate one vending location\r\n  at a time.Â  Thus, after Craft accepted the position at Perry, Holland informed\r\n  Ronnie Roberts, property manager of the Greenville County Square, of Craft's\r\n  impending departure from the county square in order to accept a vending\r\n  position at another location.Â  Furthermore, Holland added that the Commission\r\n  would select a vendor to replace Craft at the county square.Â  On October 17,\r\n  2005, Roberts, without citing any reason, notified Holland of Greenville\r\n  County's intent to close the food service canteen at the county square effective\r\n  December 31, 2005.Â  Despite subsequent efforts by the Commission to convince\r\n  Greenville County to keep the canteen open, it refused to reconsider its decision.Â  \r\nCraft's last day of\r\n  work at the county square was December 29, 2005.Â  On this date, Holland\r\n  inspected Craft's vending site at the county square and completed a report.Â  In\r\n  his report, Holland stated that Craft would begin work at Perry on January 24,\r\n  2006.Â  On January 4, 2006, the Commission sent Craft a proposed contract\r\n  between the Commission and the South Carolina Department of Corrections.Â \r\n  Although the contract was unsigned, Barbara Skinner testified she had no reason\r\n  to think an agreement between the parties would not be reached.Â  However, the\r\n  Commission never entered into a contract with the Department of Corrections,\r\n  and the vending site at Perry never opened.Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  learning the vending location at Perry would not become available, Craft\r\n  routinely checked the bid line, a telephone service provided by the Commission that\r\n  informs vendors of job openings.Â  As of the time of trial, no vending positions\r\n  had become available near the Anderson area where Craft lived with his mother.Â \r\n  As a result, Craft has not worked since his last day at the county square\r\n  canteen on December 29, 2005.Â  However, Craft continued to receive commissions\r\n  from the vending machines at the county square through February 6, 2006.Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 29, 2006, Craft commenced an action against the Commission, seeking to\r\n  recover damages from the Commission based on promissory estoppel.Â  Following a\r\n  bench trial, the trial court issued an order denying recovery, finding Craft\r\n  failed to demonstrate the elements of promissory estoppel.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nPromissory estoppel\r\n  is equitable in nature.Â  Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 289, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 917, 922 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In an action at equity,\r\n  this court can find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337\r\n  (1995).Â  However, this court is not required to disregard the findings of the\r\n  trial court who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to\r\n  judge their credibility.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Argo, Inc., 301 S.C.\r\n  229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL\r\nCraft\r\n  argues the trial court erred in finding he did not demonstrate the elements\r\n  necessary to recover under promissory estoppel.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  order to recover under a theory of promissory estoppel, a claimant must\r\n  demonstrate:Â  (1) the presence of a promise unambiguous in its terms; (2)\r\n  reasonable reliance on the promise; (3) the reliance was expected and foreseeable; and (4) injury\r\n  in reliance on the promise.Â  Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 483-84\r\n  570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The applicability of the doctrine of\r\n  promissory estoppel depends on whether the refusal to apply it would virtually\r\n  sanction the perpetration of fraud or would result in other injustice.Â  Citizens\r\n    Bank v. Gregory's Warehouse, Inc., 297 S.C. 151, 154, 375 S.E.2d 316, 318\r\n  (Ct. App. 1988).Â Â  Â \r\nA. Unambiguous Promise\r\nCraft\r\n  argues the Commission, by way of its agents, Bill Holland and Barbara Skinner,\r\n  unambiguously offered him the vending position at Perry.Â  By contrast, the\r\n  Commission asserts its promise was ambiguous because the language in the bid\r\n  notice did not guarantee income at any\r\n  location, allowed the Commission to cancel the bid, and stated that the opening\r\n  dates for the correctional facilities were subject to change.Â  In addition, the\r\n  Commission contends Craft knew the contract between the Commission and Perry\r\n  was unsigned on January 4, 2006; as a result, Craft knew or should have known\r\n  any promise made to him concerning future employment was contingent upon the\r\n  parties signing the contract.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  the Commission seems confused as to what constitutes the promise in this case.Â \r\n  The promise in this case occurred when Holland called Craft and offered him the\r\n  position at Perry.Â  Most of the Commission's arguments center around the\r\n  language found within the bid notice itself.Â  However, the bid notice did not\r\n  promise Craft future employment at Perry.Â  Rather, the bid notice merely\r\n  provided all interested vendors with a list of locations where vending\r\n  positions were available and invited them to apply for these job openings.Â \r\n  Therefore, because the bid notice was not part of the promise of future\r\n  employment or referenced as controlling terms by Holland, its language is of no\r\n  force in determining whether the promise was ambiguous.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  Commission acknowledges Craft did not receive notice of the unsigned contract\r\n  between the Commission and Perry until January 4, 2006.Â  As stated above, the\r\n  promise in this case occurred when Holland offered Craft the position at Perry\r\n  a few days prior to Skinner's congratulatory letter dated September 22, 2005.Â \r\n  Thus, the fact that the Commission mailed an unsigned contract between itself\r\n  and Perry more than two months following the promise of employment does not\r\n  render the promise ambiguous.Â  Accordingly, the Commission unambiguously\r\n  promised Craft the vending position at Perry.Â Â  \r\nB. Reasonable Reliance\r\nCraft\r\n  argues he reasonably relied on the promise of future employment made by the\r\n  Commission because it possessed the sole authority to operate vending locations\r\n  and hire vendors pursuant to statute.[2]Â \r\n  The Commission contends Craft's reliance on the promise was unreasonable in\r\n  light of the fact he knew the agreement between the Commission and Perry was\r\n  unsigned on January 4, 2006.Â  \r\nRegulations\r\n  promulgated by the Commission prevent a vendor from operating more than one\r\n  vending location at a time.Â  Thus, when the Commission offered Craft the\r\n  vending position at Perry, he was forced to choose between accepting the\r\n  Commission's offer and continuing to work at the Greenville County Square.Â \r\n  Ultimately, Craft relinquished his job at the Greenville County Square in\r\n  reliance on the Commission's promise of employment at Perry.Â  In our view,\r\n  Craft's reliance on the Commission's promise of employment was reasonable.Â  The\r\n  Commission maintained the sole authority to hire vendors.Â  See Â§ 43-26-30(b) (stating the Commission possesses the\r\n  authority to hire personnel for the administration of the vending facility\r\n  program).Â  To us, it seems reasonable for a would-be employee to rely on a\r\n  promise of future employment from the only entity with the power to hire him.Â \r\n  Additionally, the Commission did not make the promise of employment conditioned\r\n  upon Perry entering into a formal contract with the Commission.Â  See Davis\r\n    v. Greenwood Sch. Dist., 365 S.C. 629, 635, 620 S.E.2d 65, 68, (2005)\r\n  (holding it is unreasonable to rely on a conditional promise).Â  Moreover, Craft\r\n  did not learn that Perry and the Commission had not entered into a contract\r\n  until January 4, 2006.Â  By this time, Craft had already relied on the\r\n  Commission's promise by giving up his job at the county square.Â  October 3,\r\n  2005, the date on which the Commission informed Greenville County of Craft's\r\n  imminent departure from the location, Craft neither knew, nor should have\r\n  known, that the contract between the Commission and Perry had not been signed.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find Craft's reliance on the Commission's promise was\r\n  reasonable.Â Â  \r\nC.Reliance Was Expected &amp;\r\n  Foreseeable \r\nCraft\r\n  contends it was expected and foreseeable he would quit his job at the county\r\n  square after being promised employment at Perry because the Commission's rules\r\n  prevented him from holding more than one vending position at a time.Â  The\r\n  Commission asserts this element cannot be established because it committed no\r\n  wrongful act.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the Commission could have both expected and foreseen that Craft would\r\n  relinquish his job at the county square in reliance on the promise of\r\n  employment at Perry.Â  The Commission's own rules prevented Craft from holding\r\n  more than one vending position at a time.Â  Thus, after Craft accepted the job\r\n  at Perry, he was forced to give up his job at the county square. Accordingly,\r\n  Craft's reliance on the Commission's promise of employment at Perry was\r\n  expected and foreseeable.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nD. Injury\r\nCraft\r\n  argues he sustained injury in reliance on the Commission's promise of\r\n  employment at Perry by giving up his job at the county square.Â  The Commission\r\n  asserts Craft did not suffer any injury in reliance on the Commission's promise\r\n  because the Commission never promised him income at any site, Craft's damages\r\n  were not proximately caused by the Commission, and Greenville County decided to\r\n  terminate the vending position at the county square.Â  In the alternative, the\r\n  Commission contends Craft is not entitled to recover from the Commission\r\n  because he failed to mitigate his damages.Â  \r\nCraft has failed to\r\n  demonstrate that he suffered injury in reliance on the Commission's promise.Â \r\n  Without citing any reason for its decision, Greenville County informed the Commission\r\n  of its intent to close the food service canteen at the county square effective\r\n  December 31, 2005.[3]Â \r\n  Because Greenville County offered no explanation for its decision and no reason\r\n  was presented at trial, we simply cannot speculate as to the motivating factors\r\n  prompting the county's decision.Â  All we are left with on appeal is the fact\r\n  that the vending position at the county square was eliminated as of December\r\n  31, 2005.Â  Although Craft could have remained at the county square until its\r\n  closing date, he quit on December 29.Â  Thus, even assuming Craft quit his job\r\n  in reliance on the Commission's promise, he could no longer work at the county\r\n  square after December 31 because the location had been closed down.Â  As a\r\n  result, because his job at the county square was no longer available following\r\n  his resignation, Craft has failed to demonstrate that he sustained injury by\r\n  quitting his job in reliance on the Commission's promise.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  Craft has failed to demonstrate the elements of promissory estoppel.Â  \r\nII.Â  REMAINING ISSUES\r\nCraft contends the trial court erred in concluding the\r\n  theories of promissory estoppel and quasi-contract are equivalent.Â  In\r\n  addition, Craft argues the trial court erred in finding his claim for\r\n  promissory estoppel was barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  \r\nIn the trial\r\n  court's order, it observed &quot;promissory estoppel is considered\r\n  quasi-contract and quasi-tort . . . .&quot;Â  Even assuming Craft is correct and\r\n  the trial court erred in making this statement, it makes no difference on\r\n  appeal.Â  See McCall v.\r\n    Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26,\r\n  28 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;[W]hatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesn't\r\n  matter.&quot;).Â  The trial court\r\n  correctly set forth the elements of promissory estoppel.Â  If the trial court\r\n  erred in referring to promissory estoppel as quasi-contract, this error had no\r\n  bearing on the resolution of this case.Â  Similarly, even if the trial court\r\n  erred in concluding Craft's claim for promissory estoppel was barred by the Tort\r\n  Claims Act, it makes no difference on appeal.Â  After concluding Craft failed to\r\n  demonstrate the elements of promissory estoppel, the trial court also found the\r\n  Tort Claims Act barred Craft's claim.Â  Because we agree with the trial court\r\n  that Craft failed to demonstrate the elements of promissory estoppel, we need\r\n  not address this issue.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist.\r\n    No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating appellate\r\n  courts need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, J., and\r\n  KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Vendors are self-employed and are not considered\r\n  employees of the Commission.Â  \r\n[2] Section 43-25-70 of the South Carolina Code (1985)\r\n  empowers the Commission to operate all vending locations.Â  Section 43-26-30(b)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (1985) grants the Commission the authority to\r\n  &quot;appoint such personnel as may be necessary for the administration of the\r\n  vending facility program.&quot;Â  Regulation 18-1(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  of Regulations (Supp. 2007) vests the Commission with the authority to provide employment\r\n  for vendors licensed under the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program.Â  \r\n[3] Pursuant to the contract entered into between the\r\n  Commission and Greenville County, either party could terminate the agreement\r\n  upon ninety days written notice.Â  Although Greenville County terminated the\r\n  contract with less than ninety days notice, the Commission chose not to\r\n  commence legal action against Greenville County.Â  Because Craft was not a party\r\n  to this contract and because he does not argue he was a third-party beneficiary\r\n  under the contract, this fact has no effect on Craft's attempt to recover\r\n  damages from the Commission.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4618","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of James Miller","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4618","description":"James Carl Miller appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss, arguing the State's failure to hold a hearing within sixty days after the court found probable cause to believe Miller was a sexually violent predator requires the action be dismissed pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act.

Â We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1998, the mother of a one-year-old baby walked into\r\n  a room and found Miller leaning over her child with his pants down, while the\r\n  baby's diaper was off.Â  While exiting the room, Miller punched the mother.Â \r\n  Miller pled guilty to committing a lewd act on a child under the age of sixteen\r\n  years and criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN).Â \r\n  The trial court sentenced Miller to fifteen years' imprisonment for the lewd\r\n  act offense suspended upon the service of ten years and five years' probation,\r\n  and ten years imprisonment for the CVDHAN, to be served concurrently.[1]Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to his release, Miller's case was referred to the multi-disciplinary committee\r\n  for assessment pursuant to section 44-48-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  After review in May of 2005, the multi-disciplinary team found Miller satisfied\r\n  the statutory definition of &quot;Sexually Violent Predator&quot; (SVP)\r\n  pursuant to section 44-48-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Thereafter, the multi-disciplinary team referred the case to the Prosecutor's\r\n  Review Committee (the Committee).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Committee determined probable cause existed to conclude Miller was an SVP.Â \r\n  After this finding, pursuant to section 44-48-70 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2008), the State filed a petition requesting a trial court make a\r\n  judicial determination as to whether Miller was an SVP and petitioned the trial\r\n  court for a probable cause hearing.Â  In August, the court appointed\r\n  Janice Baker as Miller's counsel.Â  A probable cause hearing pursuant to section\r\n  44-48-80 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) was set for August 29, 2005,\r\n  before the Honorable William P. Keesley.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  notified of the hearing, Baker informed the Attorney General's office that she\r\n  would be relieved of counsel in the case and that the new attorney would be\r\n  David B. Betts. Therefore, she would not participate in the hearing, and it\r\n  needed to be postponed until Betts received the case file from her. The\r\n  original hearing date was continued, and Betts was appointed by order.Â  Efforts\r\n  to get a new hearing were hindered by the untimely death of Judge Marc\r\n  Westbrook shortly thereafter.Â  On November 3, 2005, the court held Miller's\r\n  probable cause hearing. \r\nAfter\r\n  the court found probable cause existed to believe Miller was an SVP, pursuant\r\n  to section 44-48-90 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), the State had\r\n  sixty days to conduct Miller's civil SVP trial.Â  Although Miller was scheduled\r\n  to be released from prison on December 1, 2005, the Act allowed the State to\r\n  continue to confine Miller for the sixty days leading up to his SVP civil\r\n  trial.Â  See Â§ 44-48-90.Â  The sixty-day window would have expired on\r\n  January 2, 2006.Â  Prior to the expiration of the sixty day time period, the\r\n  State realized that it would not have a mental health evaluation from the\r\n  Department of Mental Health by the deadline set by the statute. Â The\r\n  State, therefore, moved for a continuance pursuant to section 44-48-90 on\r\n  December 29, 2005.Â  In its motion, the State pointed out January 2, 2006, was a\r\n  holiday, and the last day for a trial of Miller's case would be December 30,\r\n  2005.Â  Furthermore, the State indicated the court-ordered evaluation of Miller\r\n  would not be complete until January 31, 2006, and pointed to problems in\r\n  obtaining information related to Miller's prior North Carolina convictions.[2]Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 13, 2006, the trial court held a hearing regarding the State's motion\r\n  for a continuance.Â  At the hearing, Miller's counsel argued Miller was being\r\n  held &quot;without bond and is now incarcerated because they said there was\r\n  probable cause to have him evaluated.&quot;Â  Further, Miller's counsel argued &quot;the\r\n  statute says--the [S]tate can ask for a continuance . . . only if the\r\n  respondent will not be substantially prejudiced, and it says it may be\r\n  continued up[on] request of either party on a showing of good cause.&quot;Â  Up\r\n  until this time, Miller had made no motion to dismiss or raised an objection\r\n  even though he was being held beyond his release date.Â  The State responded\r\n  that it was ready to try the case on January 13 or as soon as the court could\r\n  get a jury together. Â The trial court commented on the State's delay in\r\n  bringing the action by stating: Â &quot;The Attorney General has got to comply\r\n  with the statute, and the [courts] have got to give you an opportunity to be\r\n  heard.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the trial court noted:Â  &quot;The State has a habit\r\n  of waiting until the man's about to be released in all cases and then filing\r\n  these actions. . . . The legislature drew hard and fast lines and if [Miller]\r\n  is going to suffer substantial prejudice and a deprivation of liberty is\r\n  substantial prejudice.&quot;Â  The court made the assertion about alleged habits\r\n  of the State without any supporting documentation or evidence for its\r\n  assertion.Â  Even so, the trial court found it was not unreasonable to set the\r\n  trial for the following week, beginning January 17, 2006.Â  Thus, in effect the\r\n  trial court granted the State's motion for a continuance.Â  \r\nMiller\r\n  voiced no objection to the continuance, but in response to the trial court's\r\n  ruling, Miller's counsel made a motion to dismiss for the first time based on\r\n  Miller's substantial prejudice and cited to In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638,\r\n  550 S.E.2d 311 (2001).Â  The trial court did not rule on Miller's motion to\r\n  dismiss, but stated: Â &quot;I think you have to file your motion if you want it\r\n  dismissed, and then if you have a motion to dismiss and set forth the reasons\r\n  then I could address that today.&quot;Â  Miller's counsel agreed to file the\r\n  motion to dismiss that afternoon and requested scheduling a hearing on that\r\n  motion.Â  The trial court again did not rule on Miller's motion to dismiss but\r\n  instructed trial counsel to &quot;file whatever you think you need to&quot; and\r\n  indicated &quot;[w]hat I've stated in the record is the order of the [c]ourt.&quot; \r\nOn\r\n  January 17, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on Miller's motion to\r\n  dismiss.Â  There, counsel stated:Â  &quot;[Miller] paid his debt under the\r\n  criminal statutes of this State.Â  He was free to go on December the 1st.&quot;Â \r\n  The State responded by pointing out that Dr. Pamela Crawford conducts all the\r\n  SVP evaluations in South Carolina, which is a fairly significant load.Â \r\n  Further, the State reasoned &quot;that [it] is very important, not only for the\r\n  public and the State . . . for her to do a thorough job.&quot;Â  As support for\r\n  its &quot;good cause&quot; assertion, the State mentioned several things out of\r\n  its control occurred before and after Miller's probable cause hearing,\r\n  including the untimely death of Judge Westbrook, change of Miller's counsel,\r\n  and changes in the Attorney General's office.Â  The State repeated that it was\r\n  ready for trial, but the defense inferred that if the motion to dismiss was not\r\n  granted it needed the case continued to have its own evaluation completed to\r\n  combat the State's expert.Â  Accordingly, the trial court continued the\r\n  case.Â  Further, it did not rule on Miller's motion that day but apparently took\r\n  the matter under advisement.Â  The trial court denied Miller's motion in\r\n  a written order filed July 24, 2006, after weighing the State's interest in\r\n  proceeding with the SVP trial against Miller's prejudice.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  trial court's order stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    State routinely waits until the inmates falling under the [Act] are nearing\r\n    their max-out date before beginning the process set out under the statute.Â \r\n    However, the [c]ourt finds that the State's interest in examining potential\r\n    [SVP]s outweighs the prejudice to [Miller].Â  Absent a showing of substantial\r\n    prejudice, the [c]ourt DENIES the motion to dismiss but reminds the State that\r\n    it is in the interest of justice to begin the statutory evaluation prior to the\r\n    imminent max out date of inmates falling under the statute. \r\n\r\nThereafter, the State moved\r\n  to alter or amend the trial court's order denying Miller's motion to dismiss.Â \r\n  Specifically, the State requested the trial court remove the following\r\n  sentence:Â  &quot;[T]he State routinely waits until the inmates falling under\r\n  the [Act] are nearing their max-out date before beginning the process set out\r\n  under the statute&quot; from its order.Â  The State pointed out that regardless\r\n  of what may have occurred in other cases, the state began this process more\r\n  than 180 days prior to Miller's scheduled release date.Â  Furthermore, the State\r\n  asserted but for Miller's decision to change counsel which delayed the process\r\n  for more than sixty days, the probable cause hearing would have taken place\r\n  more than ninety days before his release date.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  State's motion to alter or amend on September 6, 2006, once again without\r\n  providing any evidence to support its assertion.Â  \r\nMiller's\r\n  civil SVP trial began on November 27, 2006, in Lexington County.[3]Â \r\n  The jury found Miller was an SVP, and the trial court issued an order of\r\n  commitment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMiller argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to\r\n  dismiss when his civil SVP trial was not held within sixty days after the\r\n  probable cause hearing because he was incarcerated past his release date.Â \r\n  Specifically, Miller argues section 44-48-90 allows for a continuance\r\n  only upon 1) request of either party; 2) good cause shown; and 3) &quot;only if\r\n  the respondent will not be substantially prejudiced.&quot;Â  Miller argues he\r\n  was substantially prejudiced because he was faced with two choices:Â  1) he\r\n  could have gone forward with trial on January 13, 2006, without having an\r\n  independent psychiatric evaluation, depriving him an opportunity to prepare a\r\n  defense or 2) he could have asked for a continuance in order to obtain the\r\n  independent psychiatric evaluation which would have resulted in his continued\r\n  incarceration past his release date.Â  Miller argues either choice was\r\n  substantially prejudicial.Â  \r\nIn reply, the State\r\n  argues the trial court did not err in denying Miller's motion because the case\r\n  was properly continued under section 44-48-90.Â  Specifically, the State\r\n  addressed the three statutory requirements Miller cited and argued it\r\n  demonstrated good cause for a continuance and Miller was not substantially\r\n  prejudiced.Â  In its prejudice argument, the State mentions most of Miller's\r\n  extended confinement was due to circumstances beyond its control, including the\r\n  untimely death of Judge Westbrook.Â  Additionally, Miller's change in counsel\r\n  required a postponement of the initial probable cause hearing from August 29,\r\n  2005 to November 3, 2005.Â  Finally, the State contends obtaining records for a\r\n  complete evaluation is in the best interest of the State as well as Miller and\r\n  explained Dr. Pamela Crawford could not perform a complete evaluation of Miller\r\n  within the statutory time parameters.Â  \r\nThe State further argues that\r\n  &quot;as a matter of public policy, it is important that the court appointed\r\n  evaluator be afforded the time and opportunity to conduct a complete\r\n  evaluation.&quot;Â  Such a thorough evaluation, explains the State, would be in\r\n  the best interest of the public at large as well as Miller.Â  Further, the State\r\n  notes all the burdens it must comply with under the Act and argues &quot;any\r\n  prejudice to [Miller] in this case was overwhelmingly outweighed by the\r\n  interest of the State.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Act requires the State to follow certain procedures and timelines before\r\n  committing an individual as an SVP.Â  When a person has been imprisoned for one\r\n  or more of the sexually violent offenses identified in section 44-48-30 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), the Act requires the agency with jurisdiction\r\n  over that person to notify the Attorney General and a multidisciplinary team\r\n  designed to evaluate the particular offender prior to his release.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-40(A) (Supp. 2008).Â  The multidisciplinary team reviews\r\n  relevant records and assesses whether the person the team is reviewing\r\n  satisfies the definition of an SVP under the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  If the multidisciplinary team determines the person satisfies the\r\n  statutory definition, the team forwards its assessment and all relevant records\r\n  to the Committee.Â  Id.\r\nSection 44-48-80(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) states\r\n  &quot;the court must determine whether probable cause exists to believe that\r\n  the person named in the petition is a sexually violent predator.&quot;Â  Once\r\n  probable cause is established in a hearing, a trial is conducted.Â  Section 44-48-90 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008)\r\n  states:Â  &quot;Within sixty days after the completion of a hearing held pursuant\r\n  to Section 44-48-80, the court must conduct a trial to determine whether the\r\n  person is a sexually violent predator.&quot;Â  A provision in section 44-48-90\r\n  allows for an extension of the sixty-day time frame and states:Â  &quot;The\r\n  trial may be continued upon the request of either party and a showing of good\r\n  cause, or by the court on its own motion in the due administration of justice,\r\n  and only if the respondent will not be substantially prejudiced.&quot;Â  \r\nIn In\r\n  re Matthews, the South Carolina Supreme Court addressed whether a trial\r\n  court had subject matter jurisdiction when the State failed to comply with the\r\n  sixty-day time period without asking for a continuance.Â  345 S.C. 638, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 311 (2001).Â  The Matthews court found &quot;the legislature's use\r\n  of the word 'shall' in section 44-48-90 indicates the holding of a trial within\r\n  sixty days of the probable cause hearing is mandatory.&quot;Â  345 S.C. at 644,\r\n  550 S.E.2d at 313.Â  Additionally, the court noted section 44-48-90 created a\r\n  statutory burden on the State or the trial court to &quot;require the issuance\r\n  of a continuance, or even a notation in the record, indicating (1) the trial\r\n  cannot be held within sixty days; (2) good cause for the delay; and (3) the\r\n  respondent will not suffer prejudice.&quot;Â  Id. at 644, 550 S.E.2d at\r\n  314.Â  Ultimately, the supreme court found the State's failure to comply with\r\n  the statutory time period did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 645, 550 S.E.2d at 314. Â Thus, the appellant in Matthews should have\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss when the State failed to bring the case within sixty\r\n  days without asking for a continuance.Â  Id.Â  Here, the State sought a\r\n  continuance before the expiration period as required by Matthews and\r\n  noted why the case could not be tried within sixty days.Â  Â \r\nWe find the trial court did not err in denying Miller's motion to\r\n  dismiss.Â  As the trial court mentioned, the legislature set definite timelines\r\n  for SVP actions, and this court must give plain meaning to clearly written\r\n  statutes.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (&quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\n  of the legislature. . . . Where the statute's language is plain and\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory\r\n  interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\n  meaning.&quot;).Â  Under the legislation at issue, the\r\n  General Assembly used strong language like &quot;shall&quot; and intended to\r\n  make exceptions to the sixty-day requirement only in limited circumstances.Â  See Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 644, 550 S.E.2d 311, 314 (&quot;The language of\r\n  the Act does allow a trial to be held outside the sixty day period, but only\r\n  under certain conditions.&quot;).Â  We find the State followed Matthews and the statutory requirements for the trial court to conduct Miller's civil\r\n  commitment trial more than sixty days after the probable cause hearing.\r\nHere, the State complied with these conditions and followed the\r\n  guidelines set by Matthews by seeking a continuance prior to the\r\n  expiration of the sixty day time period.[4]Â  It is clear that the Matthews court decided\r\n  that although the legislature has set mandatory standards to be followed in SVP\r\n  cases, these standards are not jurisdictional.Â  345 S.C. at 645, 550 S.E.2d at\r\n  314.Â  Further, Matthews notes that the statute provides a means for\r\n  cases to be continued.Â  Id. at 644, 550 S.E.2d at 314.Â  In the instant\r\n  case the trial court found good cause existed to grant the State's motion for a\r\n  continuance and that granting the motion would not result in substantial\r\n  prejudice to Miller.Â  In making this ruling, the trial court considered several\r\n  factors, including:Â  1) Miller's change in counsel that delayed the case over\r\n  thirty days, 2) the interest of Miller in having a thorough report by DMH that\r\n  could have been in his favor; and 3) granting the State's motion for continuance\r\n  on January 13, 2006, was only ten days after the expiration of the sixty day\r\n  window set on November 3, 2005.Â  Therefore, we find the State satisfied the\r\n  first two prongs of Matthews by demonstrating the trial could not be\r\n  held within sixty days and good cause for the delay.Â  \r\nOur analysis now turns to whether Miller was substantially\r\n  prejudiced by the trial court's granting of the State's motion for a\r\n  continuance.Â  The Act does not define &quot;prejudice.&quot; Â Here, both Miller\r\n  and the State were granted great latitude in order to sufficiently prepare for\r\n  the SVP trial.Â  Though the State was ready to proceed to trial on January 13, due to the trial court's grant of the motion for a continuance,\r\n  Miller, pursuant to his request, was able to prepare a defense and complete an\r\n  independent psychiatric examination.Â  Therefore, the trial court's grant of the\r\n  motion for a continuance enabled Miller to adequately prepare for his trial and\r\n  develop a trial strategy, and we find the trial court properly denied Miller's\r\n  motion to dismiss thereafter.Â  Â Â \r\nWe recognize\r\n  Miller was incarcerated past his release date; however, we are hesitant to set\r\n  a bright line rule which would require reversal of an SVP's commitment when an\r\n  individual is detained past his release date.Â  In this respect, the State was\r\n  ready to proceed with trial on January 13, 2006 and prior to that date Miller\r\n  had not filed a motion to dismiss.Â  Accordingly, the trial court found it was\r\n  not unreasonable to set Miller's civil commitment trial the week beginning\r\n  January 17, 2006.Â  Accordingly, we do not believe Miller suffered substantial\r\n  prejudice by his two week prolonged incarceration.Â  For the reasons set forth\r\n  above, we believe the State met the three part test articulated in Matthews.\r\nWe\r\n  also note with concern that Miller's civil commitment trial did not occur until\r\n  well over a year after the probable cause hearing was held, some ten months\r\n  longer than the limit prescribed in section 44-48-90.Â  It is further noted\r\n  that, with the exception of the trial court's order denying the motion to\r\n  dismiss, the record before us contains no indication whether either party moved\r\n  to proceed with the commitment trial prior to the date it actually took place.Â \r\n  Although not reversible error under these circumstances, as explained above, it\r\n  is worth emphasizing that SVP trials should take priority when scheduling a\r\n  court's docket, precisely because of the potential for the prolonged\r\n  incarceration evidenced in this case.Â  See Â§ 44-48-90 (&quot;If such a\r\n  request is made, the court must schedule a trial before a jury at the next\r\n  available date in the court of common pleas in the county where the offense was\r\n  committed. &quot;).Â  For the reasons set forth above, the decision of the\r\n  circuit court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prior to Miller's 1998\r\n  plea, Miller pled guilty to taking indecent liberties with children in a North Carolina court.Â  The date of the offense was on or about June 5, 1995.Â  North\r\n  Carolina sentenced Miller to probation for the offense on the condition that he\r\n  participate in sex offender treatment.Â  Subsequently, he violated probation and\r\n  was imprisoned for approximately two-and-a-half months in 1996.Â  In 1998,\r\n  Miller fled North Carolina while still on probation and was considered a\r\n  fugitive.Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  Though the State\r\n  indicated Miller's evaluation would not be completed until January 31, 2006,\r\n  from the record it appears the evaluation was completed on January 13, 2006, as\r\n  the State was ready to proceed with Miller's civil commitment trial the day of\r\n  the continuance hearing.Â  Further, the record indicates Miller's counsel\r\n  received the evaluation report prior to the January 17, 2006 hearing. \r\n[3] The record on appeal does\r\n  not indicate that Miller made any other requests to the court after the January\r\n  17, 2006 hearing to seek an earlier trial date or make any other complaints\r\n  about the process before his trial on November 27, 2006.\r\n[4] We\r\n  note with interest that Miller does not appeal the trial court's decision to\r\n  grant the continuance based upon consideration of section 44-48-90, rather he\r\n  appeals the trial court's decision not to grant his motion to dismiss.Â  It\r\n  should also be noted that the State was ready to proceed on and after January\r\n  13, 2006, and the record does not indicate any delay thereafter was\r\n  attributable to the State.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4629","title":"Alonzo Brinkley v.

Arthur, III, of Florence, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Alonzo Brinkley appeals the circuit court's vacation of the jury award\r\n  and grant of a new trial in favor of Respondent, South Carolina Department of\r\n  Corrections (Department).Â  Brinkley asserts sufficient evidence of gross\r\n  negligence existed to support the verdict and the amount of the verdict was not\r\n  so excessive as to shock the conscience.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBrinkley was an inmate with\r\n  Department, housed at the Evans Correctional Facility (Evans) in November of\r\n  2004.Â  During the first part of the month, a special unit of Department\r\n  officers, known as the Rapid Response Team (the Team), was in control of Evans\r\n  pursuant to an institutional lock-down to investigate suspicions of contraband\r\n  being smuggled into the facility.Â  Brinkley asserts that during the lock-down the\r\n  Team physically assaulted him. Â According to Brinkley he was sprayed with mace;\r\n  struck in the back of his head with the mace canister; punched and kicked while\r\n  on the ground; and finally rammed, head-first, into a brick wall.Â  \r\nBrinkley testified he\r\n  received medical attention for his injuries immediately following the assault,\r\n  including multiple bruises and a large bump on his head that remained for\r\n  several weeks.Â  Thereafter, Brinkley filed suit against Department, alleging\r\n  gross negligence, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional\r\n  distress.Â  A jury trial resulted in a verdict for Brinkley in the amount of $600,000.Â \r\n  Department filed a post-trial motion, requesting judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict, and, alternatively, a new trial based on the excessiveness of the\r\n  verdict or the thirteenth juror doctrine, or new trial nisi remitittur,\r\n  pursuant to Rules 50(b) and 59, SCRCP.Â  The circuit court held a hearing on the\r\n  motions and subsequently issued an order granting Department's motion for a new\r\n  trial absolute.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA circuit court may grant a\r\n  new trial absolute on the ground that the verdict is excessive or inadequate.Â  Rush\r\n    v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 379, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).Â  &quot;The\r\n  jury's determination of damages, however, is entitled to substantial\r\n  deference.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The circuit court should grant a new trial\r\n  absolute on the excessiveness of the verdict only if the amount is so grossly\r\n  inadequate or excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly\r\n  indicates the figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice,\r\n  partiality, corruption, or some other improper motives.Â  Id. at 379-80,\r\n  426 S.E.2d at 805.Â  \r\nThe grant or denial of new\r\n  trial motions rests within the discretion of the circuit court, and its\r\n  decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless its findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\n  of law.Â  Umhoefer v. Bollinger, 298 S.C. 221, 224, 379 S.E.2d 296, 297\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989); see also Boozer v. Boozer, 300 S.C. 282, 283, 387\r\n  S.E.2d 674, 675 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating the court of appeals has no power to\r\n  review circuit court's ruling unless it rests on basis of fact wholly\r\n  unsupported by evidence or is controlled by error of law).Â  &quot;In deciding\r\n  whether to assess error to a court's denial of a motion for a new trial, we\r\n  must consider the testimony and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in\r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Umhoefer, 298\r\n  S.C. at 224, 379 S.E.2d at 297.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrinkley contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in granting Department's motion for a new trial absolute,\r\n  arguing sufficient evidence of gross negligence existed to support the verdict\r\n  and the amount of the verdict was not so excessive as to shock the conscience.[1]Â \r\n  In essence, Brinkley maintains the circuit court did not give substantial\r\n  deference to the credibility determinations typically left to the discretion of\r\n  the jury, and in so doing, was not justified in invading the jury's province.\r\nIn its order, the circuit\r\n  court determined little or no evidence substantiated Brinkley's claims for\r\n  damages outside of his own testimony and that of two other inmates who claimed\r\n  to have witnessed the assault.Â  The court noted Brinkley failed to introduce\r\n  any medical records supporting the testimony of injuries, while the testimony\r\n  of Department's doctor, who claims to have seen Brinkley some four days\r\n  following the alleged assault, testified Brinkley neither exhibited signs or\r\n  symptoms of an assault, nor complained to him that he had been assaulted.Â \r\n  Moreover, the court noted Brinkley himself testified he had no permanent scars\r\n  or other marks resulting from the alleged assault.Â  Additionally, the circuit\r\n  court discussed the possibility that the jury reached its decision by\r\n  considering improper punitive or exemplary measures.Â  The circuit court noted\r\n  Brinkley's counsel came close in his closing statement to asking the jury to\r\n  &quot;send a message&quot; to Department when calculating any damages award;\r\n  this, it concluded, contributed to the excessiveness of the verdict.[2]Â \r\n  Finally, the circuit court determined the amount of damages the jury awarded,\r\n  based on the evidence and testimony admitted at trial, clearly indicated the\r\n  verdict must have been the result of caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality,\r\n  corruption, or other improper motive, and it was so excessive that it shocked\r\n  the conscience.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Appellant that the record contains some evidence to support a\r\n  verdict against Department.Â  Unfortunately for Brinkley, that is not the lens\r\n  through which an appellate court must view a circuit court's grant of a new\r\n  trial absolute.Â  Brinkley did not introduce into evidence any medical records\r\n  tending to show the effects of the alleged assault, although he does correctly\r\n  point out that Department is in sole possession and control of those records.Â \r\n  Additionally, Brinkley did testify to some aspects of pain and suffering on\r\n  which a jury could base an award of damages.Â  However, we agree with the\r\n  circuit court that an award of $600,000, for an assault that admittedly left\r\n  Brinkley no permanent scars or injuries, is so excessive as to shock the\r\n  conscience.Â  This is particularly true in a case in which an award could not,\r\n  and should not, have contained any element of punitive or deterrent-based\r\n  damages, because the defendant was a governmental entity.Â  See Macmurphy\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Public Transp., 295 S.C. 49, 51, 367 S.E.2d\r\n  150, 151-52 (1988) (stating that punitive damages are not recoverable, absent\r\n  an authorizing statute, against the State of South Carolina or its agencies).\r\nNevertheless, as stated\r\n  above, our standard also requires a finding that the jury award was clearly\r\n  reached as a result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or\r\n  some other improper motives.Â  Brinkley contends the circuit court's\r\n  justification for that finding â€“ a statement made by Brinkley's counsel in\r\n  closing argument that was both objected to and sustained â€“ is the only evidence\r\n  of prejudice in the recordÂ  and is wholly insufficient to support the circuit\r\n  court's ruling.Â  Notwithstanding, our standard of review dictates that we must\r\n  only look to see if there is evidence in the record to support the circuit\r\n  court's decision to grant a new trial, and, only in the complete absence of\r\n  such evidence, is it within our province to find the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion.Â  Because there is evidence and testimony in the record to support\r\n  its finding of both elements, we cannot say the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion in granting Department's motion for a new trial absolute.Â  The\r\n  decision of the circuit court is thereforeÂ Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKONDUROS, J.,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Brinkley also asserted in oral argument that the\r\n  circuit court committed an error of law when it improperly melded the standards\r\n  for granting a new trial based on the excessiveness of the verdict or the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  Because Brinkley neither filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion asking the circuit court to address the alleged error in the application\r\n  of two legal remedies in its order, nor included this argument in its brief to\r\n  this court, we find the argument is not preserved for our review.Â  See Lucas\r\n    v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715\r\n  (2004) (stating an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review).\r\n[2] A review of the record reveals Brinkley's counsel\r\n  actually stated:\r\nNow,\r\n  when you think about damages in this case you've got to determine what's an\r\n  appropriate amount, a monitory [sic] amount to award Alonzo Brinkley.Â  That's\r\n  your decision.Â  Obviously, you know you've got to keep in mind that he doesn't\r\n  have any medical bills to present to the jury.Â  The best you can give him is\r\n  money in this case.Â  I want you to think about something. Â See, in order to\r\n    get somebody's attention you've got to make them pay the money . . . \r\n(emphasis added).Â \r\n  Counsel for Department then objected to this statement, and the court sustained\r\n  the objection.

under\r\n  this policy.Â  \r\nNew\r\n  York Central is a New York corporation licensed to engage in the insurance\r\n  business in New York.Â  It is not licensed to do business or to sell insurance\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Smith's parents are New York residents.Â  Smith moved from\r\n  New York to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in 1999.Â  At that time he drove an\r\n  Audi owned and insured by his parents.Â  In 2001, Father purchased the Ford\r\n  Escort and provided it for Smith to use while he attended college at Coastal\r\n  Carolina University.Â  Before starting college, Smith established legal\r\n  residency in South Carolina.Â  He turned in his New York driver's license and\r\n  acquired a South Carolina license in March of 2001.Â  Mother testified that she\r\n  informed her New York Central agent, the Mang Agency, Smith was using the car\r\n  while he attended college in South Carolina.Â  \r\nFather\r\n  signed over title to Smith in January of 2004 with the intent Smith would have\r\n  ownership of the vehicle once it was titled and insured in South Carolina.Â  On\r\n  April 5, 2004, Smith went to the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles\r\n  (DMV) to transfer the title and register the vehicle in his name.Â  At the\r\n  request of the DMV employee, he presented the New York Central insurance card\r\n  and told her both of his parents' names were on the card.Â  He listed the Mang\r\n  Insurance Company on the DMV application as the insurance agency.Â  According to\r\n  Smith, the DMV employee told him he had thirty days to change the insurance to\r\n  South Carolina.Â  Smith called several insurance agents before choosing State\r\n  Farm.Â  He called a State Farm agent on April 12 and was told he needed a copy\r\n  of the declaration page from the New York Central policy.Â  That same day Smith called\r\n  the Mang Agency and requested a faxed copy of the policy.Â  Smith testified he\r\n  told the agent he had transferred the title to his name and that he needed the\r\n  document in order to acquire insurance within the thirty-day time frame.Â \r\n  Although Smith received the fax from the Mang Agency, he failed to acquire\r\n  insurance from State Farm or any other agency before the accident.Â  New York\r\n  Central sent Smith's parents notice that effective May 4, 2004, eleven days\r\n  after the accident, the Ford Escort was deleted from the policy and amended the\r\n  covered drivers on the policy to remove Smith due to his being &quot;out of\r\n  household.&quot;Â  In addition, New York Central sent notice it was cancelling\r\n  the policy effective May 21, 2004.Â  New York Central refunded some of the\r\n  premiums paid by Smith's parents for coverage for Smith, but it refused to\r\n  refund any premiums paid through May 4, 2004.Â  It subsequently reinstated the\r\n  policy as to Smith's parents' remaining vehicle.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the accident, New York Central informed Leggett's counsel of the limits of the\r\n  policy.Â  It hired South Carolina insurance adjusters to appraise the damage to\r\n  Leggett's motorcycle and paid Leggett $5,636.65 for the motorcycle on June 7,\r\n  2004.Â  On June 9, 2004, New York Central sent Leggett's counsel a letter\r\n  denying liability coverage for the claim.Â  \r\nLeggett\r\n  filed this action asserting a negligence claim against Smith and his parents\r\n  and requesting a declaratory judgment that New York Central provided coverage\r\n  for the accident.Â  Smith filed a cross-claim requesting the court determine he\r\n  was in fact an insured under the New York Central policy.Â  New York Central answered\r\n  denying coverage and asserting the state of South Carolina lacked jurisdiction\r\n  over it.Â  The trial court stayed the negligence claims against the Smiths until\r\n  the declaratory judgment action was heard.Â  After a hearing on the declaratory\r\n  judgment action, the trial court determined South Carolina had personal\r\n  jurisdiction over New York Central.Â  Applying New York law,[2] the court held New York Central was obligated to provide coverage for the\r\n  accident.Â  The court subsequently denied New York Central's Rule 59, SCRCP,\r\n  motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.&quot;Â  Felts v. Richland County,\r\n  303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). Â An action to determine coverage\r\n  under an insurance policy is an action at law.Â  City of Hartsville v. S.C.\r\n    Mun. Ins. &amp; Risk Fin. Fund, 382 S.C. 535, 543, 677 S.E.2d 574, 578\r\n  (2009).Â  On appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the findings of\r\n  fact of the trial court will not be disturbed unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the trial court's findings.Â  Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Personal jurisdiction \r\nNew\r\n  York Central argues the trial court erred in determining South Carolina had\r\n  personal jurisdiction over it.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is one which\r\n  must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case.&quot; Â State v. NV\r\n    Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 88, 666 S.E.2d 218, 221 (2008). Â The\r\n  circuit court's decision should be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence\r\n  or influenced by an error of law. Â Cockrell v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co.,\r\n  363 S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005).\r\n&quot;Personal\r\n  jurisdiction is exercised as 'general jurisdiction' or 'specific\r\n  jurisdiction.'&quot; Â Coggeshall v. Reprod. Endocrine Assocs. of Charlotte,\r\n  376 S.C. 12, 16, 655 S.E.2d 476, 478 (2007).Â  The court acquires specific\r\n  jurisdiction over a cause of action arising from a defendant's contacts with the\r\n  state through the long arm statute. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803 (Supp. 2008); Cockrell,\r\n  363 S.C. at 491, 611 S.E.2d at 508.Â  &quot;Because South Carolina treats its\r\n  long-arm statute as coextensive with the due process clause, the sole question\r\n  becomes whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate due\r\n  process.&quot;Â  Cockrell, 363 S.C. at 491, 611 S.E.2d at 508.Â  \r\n&quot;General\r\n  jurisdiction attaches even when the nonresident defendant's contacts with the\r\n  forum state are not directly related to the cause of action, if the defendant's\r\n  contacts are both 'continuous and systematic.'&quot; Â Id. at 495, 611\r\n  S.E.2d at 510 (citing Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall,\r\n  466 U.S. 408, 413-14 nn. 8-9, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984)).Â  \r\n\r\n  These\r\n    contacts must be &quot;so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit\r\n    against [the respondents] on causes of action arising from dealings entirely\r\n    different from those activities.&quot; Â International Shoe Co. v. Washington,\r\n    326 U.S. 310, 318, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). Â Furthermore, the\r\n    defendant's contacts with the forum must satisfy the due process clause. Â Federal\r\n      Ins. Co. v. Lake Shore Inc., 886 F.2d 654, 660 (4th Cir. 1989).\r\n\r\nCockrell, 363 S.C. at 495, 611 S.E.2d at 510.\r\nDue process requires minimum\r\n  contacts exist between the defendant and the forum state such that maintenance\r\n  of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial\r\n  justice. Â Id. at 491, 611 S.E.2d at 508.Â  &quot;Further, the due process\r\n  requirement mandates the defendant possess sufficient minimum contacts with the\r\n  forum state such that he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court\r\n  there.&quot; Â Power Prods. &amp; Servs. Co. v. Kozma, 379 S.C. 423, 431-32,\r\n  665 S.E.2d 660, 665 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  In determining whether such minimum contacts\r\n  exist, courts apply a two-pronged analysis.Â  S. Plastics Co. v. S. Commerce\r\n    Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 260, 423 S.E.2d 128, 130-131(1992).Â  The court must (1)\r\n  find that the defendant has the requisite minimum contacts with the forum,\r\n  without which, the court does not have the &quot;power&quot; to adjudicate the\r\n  action and (2) find the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable or fair. Â Id. at 260, 423 S.E.2d at 131.Â  &quot;If either prong fails, the exercise of\r\n  personal jurisdiction over the defendant fails to comport with the requirements\r\n  of due process.&quot; Â Id.\r\nUnder\r\n  the power prong, a minimum contacts analysis requires a court to find the\r\n  defendant directed its activities to residents of South Carolina and the cause\r\n  of action arises out of or relates to those activities.Â  Moosally v. W.W.\r\n    Norton &amp; Co., 358 S.C. 320, 331-32, 594 S.E.2d 878, 884 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).\r\n\r\n  It is\r\n    essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant\r\n    purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the\r\n    forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. Â The\r\n    &quot;purposeful availment&quot; requirement ensures that a defendant will not\r\n    be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or\r\n    attenuated contacts. \r\n\r\nMoosally, 358 S.C. at 332, 594 S.E.2d at 884 (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Neither should a defendant be haled into a forum solely as a result\r\n  of the unilateral activity of another party.Â  Carson v. Vance, 326 S.C.\r\n  543, 549, 485 S.E.2d 126, 129 (Ct. App. 1997). Â \r\nThe\r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Eastern District Court of\r\n  Virginia had personal jurisdiction over an Illinois insurer when the policy\r\n  included a territory-of-coverage clause in which the insurer contracted to\r\n  provide coverage for accidents and losses that occurred within the policy\r\n  territory, which included all of the United States of America.Â  Rossman v.\r\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 832 F.2d 282 (4th Cir. 1987).Â  The Fourth\r\n  Circuit found there was no doubt the insurer could foresee being haled into\r\n  court in Virginia because insurance, by its very nature, often necessitates\r\n  litigation and an automobile policy is typically sued upon where an accident\r\n  takes place. Â Id. Â at 286.Â  The court stated the insurer's expectation\r\n  of being haled into court was an express feature of its policy.Â  Id.Â  It\r\n  explained, &quot;[p]resumably, [the insurer] offers this type of broad coverage\r\n  to induce customers to buy its policies and pay higher premiums for them.Â  The\r\n  benefits thereby accruing to [the insurer] are neither fortuitous nor\r\n  incidental.&quot;Â  Id. at 287. Â It noted an insurance company has the\r\n  ability to exclude a state in which it wanted to avoid litigation from the policy\r\n  territory.Â  Id.[3]\r\nOther\r\n  jurisdictions have also held a territory-of-coverage provision that includes\r\n  the forum state, coupled with the insured event occurring in the forum state,\r\n  is sufficient to establish minimum contacts.Â  Payne v. Motorists' Mut. Ins.\r\n    Cos., 4 F.3d 452, 456 (6th Cir. 1993) (&quot;The fact that [insurer] chose\r\n  to provide coverage for all fifty states . . . constitutes purposeful availment\r\n  of any individual state's forum.&quot;); Ferrell v. West Bend Mut. Ins. Co.,\r\n  393 F.3d 786, 791 (8th Cir. 2005) (holding insurance policy's territory of coverage\r\n  clause established sufficient contact between insurer and Arkansas to satisfy\r\n  the strictures of the Due Process Clause); Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Portage La\r\n    Prairie Mut. Ins. Co., 907 F.2d 911, 914 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding minimum\r\n  contacts where insurer had purposefully availed itself of the forum state by\r\n  agreeing to defend its insured throughout the United States); McGow v.\r\n    McCurry, 412 F.3d 1207, 1215 (11th Cir. 2005) (noting that by including\r\n  Georgia in territory of coverage, insurer purposefully sought to provide\r\n  coverage for accidents occurring in Georgia and reasonably should have foreseen\r\n  being haled into court in Georgia); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. v. Tenn.\r\n    Farmers Mut. Ins. Co., 645 N.W.2d 169, 174 (Minn. Ct. App. 2002) (holding the\r\n  out-of-state insurer could reasonably anticipate being haled into Minnesota\r\n  courts, by virtue of its policy provisions and the inherently mobile nature of\r\n  the motor vehicle); see also, TH Agric. &amp; Nutrition, LLC v. Ace\r\n    European Group Ltd., 488 F.3d 1282, 1290 (10th Cir. 2007) (noting that with\r\n  territory-of-coverage clause, insurers purposefully avail themselves of the privilege\r\n  of conducting business in the forum state by affirmatively choosing to include\r\n  the forum state in the territory of coverage).\r\nThe\r\n  policy in this case includes a territory-of-coverage clause limiting coverage\r\n  to the United States, its territories or possessions, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Â It\r\n  also includes a provision specifically addressing out-of-state coverage.Â  In\r\n  addition, New York Central was on notice the vehicle it was insuring was being\r\n  kept in South Carolina and Smith was living in South Carolina.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination by Leggett's counsel, Mother testified that when she went to\r\n  the Mang Agency to ensure Smith would still be covered by the policy, she told\r\n  the agent that Smith was taking the Ford Escort with him to South Carolina.Â  We\r\n  find that by virtue of the policy provisions, as well as New York Central's\r\n  notice that it was insuring a vehicle kept in South Carolina, New York Central\r\n  could reasonably expect to be haled into court in South Carolina.Â  Thus, the\r\n  &quot;power prong&quot; is met.Â  \r\nWe must\r\n  next examine the &quot;fairness prong.&quot;\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    order to determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign\r\n    defendant meets the fairness prong, the court must consider the following: (1)\r\n    the duration of the activity of the nonresident within the state; (2) the\r\n    character and circumstances of the commission of the nonresident's acts; (3)\r\n    the inconvenience resulting to the parties by conferring or refusing to confer\r\n    jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the State's interest in exercising\r\n    jurisdiction. Cockrell, 363 S.C. at 492, 611 S.E.2d at 508.\r\n\r\nPower Prods. and Servs. Co., 379 S.C. at 432, 665 S.E.2d at 665. \r\nNew York Central\r\n  had been on notice for several years the vehicle had been garaged in South\r\n  Carolina and was aware Smith was living in the state at the time.Â  As to the\r\n  convenience of the parties, all of the witnesses to the declaratory judgment\r\n  action, including Smith who had returned to New York to live with his parents,\r\n  were residing in New York at the time of the hearing.Â  In addition, New York\r\n  law applied.Â  However, Leggett, the injured party, was a South Carolina resident\r\n  with a South Carolina attorney.Â  As far as South Carolina's interests, Smith\r\n  and Leggett, who were requesting the court determine coverage was available for\r\n  the accident, were South Carolina citizens.Â  Thus, South Carolina has a\r\n  substantial interest in exercising jurisdiction.Â  See Rossman,\r\n  832 F.2d at 287 (holding Virginia has a substantial interest in providing\r\n  relief for its citizens when insurance companies refuse to pay claims).Â  The Rossman court explained, &quot;These residents would be at a severe disadvantage if\r\n  they were forced to follow the insurance company to a distant state in order to\r\n  hold it legally accountable.&quot; Id. (quoting McGee v. International\r\n    Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223, 78 S.Ct. 199, 201, 2 L.Ed.2d 223\r\n  (1957)).\r\nWe conclude the\r\n  trial court's assertion of jurisdiction over New York Central comported with\r\n  traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Â  Accordingly, as both\r\n  the power prong and the fairness prong have been met, we find the trial court\r\n  did not err in holding it had personal jurisdiction over New York Central.[4]Â  \r\nB. Coverage on Ford Escort \r\nNew\r\n  York Central argues the trial court erred in finding coverage on the Ford\r\n  Escort.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nNew\r\n  York Central first contends the coverage on the Ford Escort terminated upon\r\n  transfer of title.Â  Generally, an insurer's coverage of an insured automobile\r\n  terminates upon the transfer of title by its insured to another.Â  However,\r\n  coverage may continue if the insurer is notified and consents to continued\r\n  coverage.Â  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Santos, 673 N.Y.S.2d 694, 694 (N.Y. App.\r\n  Div. 1998).Â  &quot;When a party is under a duty to speak, or when his failure\r\n  to speak is inconsistent with honest dealings and misleads another, then his\r\n  silence may be deemed to be acquiescence.&quot;Â  LeCorre v. Bijesse Belford\r\n    Dolewski &amp; DiMicco, 703 N.Y.S.2d 279, 281 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000)\r\n  (internal quotations omitted). Â &quot;Furthermore, an insurer has an implied\r\n  duty to act in good faith in dealing with its insured.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In LeCorre,\r\n  the court held a question of fact existed as to whether the insurer's silence\r\n  on the issue of subrogation regarding the underinsurance claim could have been\r\n  viewed as consenting to a settlement for the policy limits of the other\r\n  driver's vehicle, as well as whether the insurer was acting in good faith\r\n  regarding potential claims by insured.Â  Id. Â \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the trial court held New York Central consented to the transfer because\r\n  it failed to cancel the policy after Smith informed the Mang Agency that title\r\n  had been transferred to him.Â  Smith testified when he called the Mang Agency to\r\n  inform it of the transfer and have the policy faxed to him, he specifically\r\n  told the agent with whom he spoke he believed he had thirty days to acquire new\r\n  insurance for the vehicle.Â  No one from the Mang Agency indicated to him he did\r\n  not have continued coverage or warned him not to drive the car.Â  New York\r\n  Central did not actually cancel the policy on the Ford Escort until May 4, 2004,\r\n  eleven days after the accident.Â  It only credited Smith's parents for the\r\n  premium charged after that date.Â  Thus, although it now claims coverage\r\n  terminated before the accident, it retained the premiums charged though the\r\n  date of the accident and eleven days afterwards. \r\nWe\r\n  find New York Central's failure to formally cancel the policy as to the Ford Escort\r\n  after Smith informed it of the transfer of ownership, along with its silence\r\n  after Smith expressed his belief that he had continued coverage for thirty days\r\n  to find new insurance, supports the trial court's determination that New York\r\n  Central consented to the continued coverage.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in\r\n  the trial court's decision on this issue.Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  also found New York Central was estopped from denying coverage due to the\r\n  transfer of title.Â  Equitable estoppel is the &quot;doctrine by which a person\r\n  may be precluded by his act or conduct, or silence when it is his duty to\r\n  speak, from asserting a right which he otherwise would have had.&quot;Â  Besicorp\r\n    Group Inc. v. Enowitz, 652 N.Y.S.2d 366, 369 (N.Y. App. Div. 1997). Â Under\r\n  this doctrine, a party is precluded from asserting rights against another who\r\n  has justifiably relied upon such conduct and changed his position so that he\r\n  will suffer injury if the former is allowed to repudiate the conduct.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  as stated above, Smith expressed his belief to New York Central's agent he had\r\n  continuing coverage for thirty days after the transfer of title to obtain new\r\n  insurance in South Carolina.Â  The agent failed to correct this mistaken\r\n  belief.Â  Smith testified that if he had known he did not have coverage, he\r\n  would not have driven the vehicle.Â  \r\nWe hold\r\n  the record supports the trial court's finding that due to New York Central's\r\n  agent's silence when Smith informed him of the title transfer, New York Central\r\n  is estopped from asserting coverage terminated upon transfer.Â  Thus, we find no\r\n  error in the trial court's ruling.Â  \r\nC. Coverage for Smith \r\nNew\r\n  York Central argues Smith was not entitled to liability coverage because he was\r\n  not a household resident at the time of the accident and the car was not\r\n  principally garaged in New York. Â We disagree.\r\nSmith\r\n  was listed as a &quot;covered driver&quot; on the policy.Â  This term was not\r\n  defined and the rights of a covered driver were not set forth in the policy.Â \r\n  The New York Appellate Division found when a son was listed as a &quot;named\r\n  driver&quot; along with his parents and the policy failed to define the term\r\n  &quot;named driver&quot; or to exclude it from coverage, an ambiguity arose,\r\n  which must be construed in favor of the insured.Â  Kennedy v. Valley Forge\r\n    Ins. Co., 612 N.Y.S.2d 712, 713 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).Â  The court noted\r\n  that if the insurers had wished to exclude a &quot;named driver&quot; from\r\n  coverage, they must have done so in clear and unmistakable language.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Because the insurers failed to do so, the court concluded the son must be\r\n  afforded the same coverage as his parents.Â  Thus, the son as a &quot;named\r\n  driver&quot; fell within the same exception to an exclusion for &quot;named\r\n  insureds.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is no indication in the present policy the residency requirement applied to\r\n  &quot;covered drivers.&quot;Â  Furthermore, we hold the record supports the\r\n  trial court's ruling New York Central waived the residency requirement.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  policy stated it would &quot;pay damages for 'bodily injury' or 'property\r\n  damage' for which any 'insured' becomes legally responsible because of an auto\r\n  accident.&quot;Â  It defined the term &quot;insured&quot; as &quot;You and any\r\n  'family member' for the ownership maintenance or use of any auto or\r\n  'trailer'&quot; and &quot;[a]ny person using 'your covered auto.'&quot;Â  It\r\n  defined &quot;family member&quot; as &quot;a person related to you by blood,\r\n  marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.&quot;Â  \r\nWaiver\r\n  is a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. Â Albert J.\r\n    Schiff Assocs. v. Flack, 417 N.E.2d 84, 87 (N.Y. 1980).Â  The court\r\n  explained: \r\n\r\n  &quot;[w]aiver\r\n    evolved because of courts' disfavor of forfeitures of the insured's coverage\r\n    which would otherwise result where an insured breached a policy condition, as\r\n    for instance, failure to give timely notice of a loss or failure to co-operate\r\n    with the insured. Â To defeat the forfeiture, courts find waiver where there is\r\n    direct or circumstantial proof that the insurer intended to abandon the\r\n    defense.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).Â  \r\nMother\r\n  testified when Smith moved to South Carolina, she immediately told their insurance\r\n  agent at the Mang Agency about the move and that Smith would be taking the Ford\r\n  Escort with him.Â  She stated their insurance premiums were higher based upon\r\n  the fact Smith was listed as a covered driver.Â  No one from New York Central\r\n  ever informed her Smith was no longer a covered driver before the accident.Â  In\r\n  addition, on March 16, 2004, New York Central received actual notice Smith had\r\n  surrendered his New York driver's license on March 8, 2001.Â  Although Timothy\r\n  Trueworthy, Vice President of Claims Division with New York Central, testified\r\n  the company would have investigated whether Smith's coverage should continue,\r\n  there is no evidence it ever took any action in this regard.Â  Thus, although\r\n  New York Central had actual notice Smith was a South Carolina resident for over\r\n  a month before the accident, it took no action to remove Smith from the\r\n  policy.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the record contains evidence to support the trial court's finding that\r\n  while New York Central knew about Smith's change of residency, it continued to\r\n  accept premium payments to include him as a covered driver and thus waived the\r\n  household residency requirement.Â  Similarly, we find New York Central continued\r\n  to accept premiums on the Ford Escort even though it had notice that the\r\n  vehicle was kept in South Carolina and therefore waived any condition that the\r\n  vehicle be principally garaged in New York.Â  \r\nD. Knowledge of terms of policy \r\nNew\r\n  York Central argues the Smiths are bound by the terms of the insurance policy\r\n  because they are conclusively presumed to have knowledge of its contents.Â  The\r\n  trial court did not address this issue and New York Central failed to raise it\r\n  in its post-trial motion.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not properly before the\r\n  court.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122,\r\n  124 (1991) (holding where a trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument\r\n  raised, and appellant makes no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to obtain a ruling,\r\n  the appellate court may not address the issue); Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C.\r\n  56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating when a trial judge makes a\r\n  general ruling on an issue, but does not address the specific argument raised\r\n  by the appellant and the appellant fails to raise the issue in a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the evidence supports the trial court's finding that New York Central\r\n  waived the household residency requirement through its continued acceptance of\r\n  premium payments and inclusion of Smith as a covered driver despite knowledge\r\n  of his change in residency.Â  Similarly, through continued acceptance of\r\n  premiums with the knowledge the Ford Escort was being kept in South Carolina,\r\n  New York Central waived any condition that the vehicle be principally garaged\r\n  in New York.Â  For the above stated reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Smith was charged with driving under the influence.Â  \r\n[2] Both parties assert New York law applies to this case.Â  \r\n[3] This court found South Carolina had personal\r\n  jurisdiction over an out-of-state insurer where the appellant took no exception\r\n  to the trial court's finding that the insured vehicle would &quot;travel in a\r\n  carnival over the eastern portion of this country [and that] [the insurer]\r\n  should certainly be put on notice that vehicles traveling in a carnival would\r\n  be very likely to be involved in accidents in states in which the carnival\r\n  travels such as South Carolina.â€Â  Parker v. Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark,\r\n    N.J., 297 S.C. 166, 169, 375 S.E.2d 325, 326 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  It held the\r\n  plaintiff's declaratory judgment action arose from the insurer's contracting to\r\n  insure the insured's automobile while it moved through the eastern United\r\n  States, including South Carolina, and from the insurers entry into an insurance\r\n  contract to be performed at least in part in states along the eastern seaboard,\r\n  including South Carolina.Â  Id.Â  Citing to Rossman, the court\r\n  noted it could not determine if the policy expressly defined its coverage to\r\n  include South Carolina because the policy was not in the record on appeal and\r\n  the insurer as the appellant bore the burden of providing the court with an\r\n  adequate record on appeal as well as showing the trial court erred.Â  Id. at 169 n.1, 375 S.E.2d at 326 n.1.Â  \r\n[4]Although\r\n  the circuit court held it had personal jurisdiction over New York Central for\r\n  different reasons, this court may affirm for any ground appearing in the\r\n  record.Â  See I'On v.

(the\r\n  Property).Â  At the time the Purchase Agreement was executed, SouthTrust Bank\r\n  had foreclosed on the Property.Â  Gerald claimed he did not know about the\r\n  foreclosure proceedings at the time he executed the Purchase Agreement.Â  Soon\r\n  after entering into the Purchase Agreement, Gerald Builders' attorney discovered\r\n  the foreclosure action.Â  However, Gerald continued negotiating with Scott Pyle\r\n  of Plantation A.D. concerning a development deal for the Property.Â  \r\nGerald Builders' attorney\r\n  drafted a Memorandum of Understanding, which provided for a 50/50 profit participation\r\n  between Gerald Builders and Plantation A.D.Â  The Memorandum required Gerald\r\n  Builders to fully satisfy the SouthTrust Bank first mortgage and repay a\r\n  $950,000.00 loan to Ralph Jones and Charlie Floyd as the lots in the\r\n  development were sold with the interest deducted from Plantation A.D.'s share\r\n  of the profits.Â  The Memorandum also provided: Â &quot;Plantation A.D., LLC will\r\n  cooperate fully with Jimmy Gerald in the closing of [the Property] on or before\r\n  December 31, 2003 upon this signed understanding.&quot; Â Although the parties\r\n  were listed as Jimmy Gerald of Gerald Builders as the Buyer and Scott Pyle of\r\n  Plantation A.D. as the Seller, the Memorandum stated, &quot;This memorandum\r\n  shall not be deemed as a contract for the sale of Real Estate.&quot;Â  \r\nGerald signed the Memorandum\r\n  on November 3, 2003.Â  According to Gerald, Pyle refused to accept the\r\n  Memorandum and threatened to file for bankruptcy.Â  Gerald authorized his\r\n  attorney to offer the Memorandum to Pyle again two days later at the upset bid\r\n  sale.Â  Gerald claimed Pyle again rejected the Memorandum.Â  Pyle, however,\r\n  claimed that Plantation A.D. accepted the terms of the Memorandum and he signed\r\n  the Memorandum when it was faxed to him on November 3.Â  \r\nGerald Builders purchased the\r\n  Property at the upset bid sale for $2,327,500.00.Â  It borrowed $2,517,500.00\r\n  from Wachovia Bank to pay for the purchase.Â  Gerald Builders began developing\r\n  the property for a single family subdivision.Â  In March of 2005, Pyle contacted\r\n  Gerald and informed him that he knew of potential purchasers for the property.Â \r\n  Gerald Builders agreed to the sale.Â  On September 26, 2005, Gerald Builders\r\n  sold the property to Signature Homes for $6,870,000.00.Â  Gerald Builders'\r\n  distribution from the sale was $1,510,222.23.Â  It did not share the profit with\r\n  Plantation A.D. Â \r\nPlantation A.D. brought this\r\n  action against Respondents asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of\r\n  contract with fraudulent intent, fraud, unfair trade practices, unjust\r\n  enrichment, constructive trust, and conversion.Â  Respondents asseverated in\r\n  their answer that Gerald's signature had been forged on the draft of the\r\n  Memorandum and also asserted counterclaims and third party claims against Pyle\r\n  and ADB Development due to the sale of the Property to Signature Homes.Â \r\n  Plantation A.D., ADB Development, and Pyle denied Respondents' claims and\r\n  asserted defenses including statute of limitations and unclean hands.Â  In\r\n  addition, Pyle asserted a claim for defamation.Â  \r\nWhile discovery motions and\r\n  Plantation A.D.'s motions to amend its complaint and answer to Respondents' counterclaim\r\n  and third-party claim were pending, the trial court granted summary judgment in\r\n  favor of Respondents on Plantation A.D.'s claims in an order filed July 5,\r\n  2007.Â  The trial court found the Memorandum was a complete, unambiguous\r\n  agreement and therefore parol evidence was not admissible.Â  It held the\r\n  Memorandum lacked consideration and was unenforceable.Â  The court also found\r\n  the Memorandum contained two conditions precedent: Â 1) Gerald Builders had to\r\n  purchase the property from Plantation A.D. (and not from the master-in-equity\r\n  or some other party); and 2) Gerald Builders had to develop the property and\r\n  not simply resell it.Â  The court held as these conditions precedent did not\r\n  occur, the Memorandum was void.Â  In addition, the court ruled there was no\r\n  evidence of individual liability of Gerald.Â  Plantation A.D. filed a Rule 59,\r\n  SCRCP, motion asking the court to alter or amend the judgment.Â  It subsequently\r\n  amended its motion and included excerpts from depositions taken after the order\r\n  granting summary judgment.Â  \r\nWhile the Rule 59 motion was\r\n  pending, the court ruled on other pending motions.Â  The court denied Plantation\r\n  A.D.'s motion to amend the complaint as summary judgment had already been\r\n  granted, but allowed Plantation A.D. leave to amend its answer to the\r\n  third-party complaint and counterclaim.Â  It also ruled on discovery motions.Â  On\r\n  November 7, 2007, Plantation A.D. filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP,\r\n  asserting in their Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim, Respondents made\r\n  allegations contrary to the arguments they had made previously to the court.Â  \r\nThe trial court denied the\r\n  Rule 59 motion in an order filed December 10, 2007.Â  The court provided all\r\n  other pending motions would be heard before a judge with proper jurisdiction.Â \r\n  It did not address Plantation A.D.'s Rule 60, SCRCP, motion.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of summary\r\n  judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial\r\n  court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576\r\n  S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Summary judgment should be granted when\r\n  &quot;the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\n  file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\r\n  as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as\r\n  a matter of law.&quot; Â Rule 56(c).Â  &quot;In determining whether any triable\r\n  issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n  the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C.\r\n  372, 378-79, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  &quot;[I]n cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Management Co., 381\r\n  S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  &quot;However, in cases requiring a\r\n  heightened burden of proof or in cases applying federal law, we hold that the\r\n  non-moving party must submit more than a mere scintilla of evidence to\r\n  withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Id. at 330-31, 673\r\n  S.E.2d at 803.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Consideration\r\nPlantation A.D. argues the\r\n  trial court erred in holding as a matter of law the Memorandum was void for\r\n  lack of consideration.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n&quot;It is a question of law\r\n  for the court whether the language of a contract is ambiguous.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  &quot;Whether a contract is ambiguous is to be\r\n  determined from the entire contract and not from isolated portions of the\r\n  contract.&quot;Â  Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d\r\n  431, 433 (1975).Â  An ambiguous contract is one that can be understood in more\r\n  ways than just one or is unclear because it expresses its purpose in an\r\n  indefinite manner. Â Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Down'Round Dev. Corp.,\r\n  268 S.C. 80, 89, 232 S.E.2d 20, 25 (1977); see Hawkins v. Greenwood\r\n    Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;A\r\n  contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed\r\n  objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of\r\n  the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices,\r\n  usages, and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or\r\n  business.&quot;) (internal citation and quotation omitted).\r\nConstruction of an ambiguous\r\n  contract is a question of fact.Â  Skull Creek Club Ltd. P'ship v. Cook &amp;\r\n    Book, Inc., 313 S.C. 283, 286, 437 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  When\r\n  an agreement is ambiguous, the court should seek to determine the parties'\r\n  intent.Â  Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995).Â  Any ambiguity in a contract, doubt, or uncertainty as to its\r\n  meaning should be resolved against the party who prepared the contract or is\r\n  responsible for the ambiguous language.Â  Myrtle Beach Lumber Co. v.\r\n    Willoughby, 276 S.C. 3, 8, 274 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1981). Â &quot;The parol\r\n  evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of agreements or\r\n  understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a written\r\n  instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or\r\n  explain the written instrument.&quot; Â Redwend Ltd. P'ship v. Edwards,\r\n  354 S.C. 459, 471, 581 S.E.2d 496, 502 (Ct. App. 2003). Â However, if a contract\r\n  is ambiguous, parol evidence is admissible to ascertain the true meaning of the\r\n  contract and the intent of the parties. Â Klutts Resort Realty, 268 S.C.\r\n  at 89, 232 S.E.2d at 25.\r\n&quot;The necessary elements\r\n  of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.&quot;Â  Roberts\r\n    v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  &quot;Valuable\r\n  consideration to support a contract may consist of some right, interest, profit\r\n  or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or\r\n  responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.&quot;Â  Prestwick\r\n    Golf Club, Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. P'ship, 331 S.C. 385, 389, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  184, 186 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  &quot;A forbearance to exercise a legal right is\r\n  valuable consideration.&quot; Â Id.\r\nPlantation A.D. asserts the\r\n  Memorandum does state consideration.Â  Item 3 of the Memorandum provides:Â \r\n  &quot;Plantation A.D., LLC will cooperate fully with Jimmy Gerald in the\r\n  closing of the 45 acres on or before December 31, 2003 upon this signed\r\n  understanding.&quot;Â  As this provision is indefinite, we hold the trial court\r\n  erred in ruling the Memorandum was unambiguous and in refusing to consider\r\n  parol evidence.Â  A fact finder may view the &quot;cooperation&quot; listed in\r\n  Item 3 as a responsibility undertaken by Plantation A.D.Â  In his affidavit,\r\n  Pyle explained Plantation A.D. cooperated by ceasing negotiations with other prospective\r\n  buyers and refraining from filing bankruptcy, thus allowing the upset bid sale\r\n  to Gerald Builders to go forward.Â  Therefore, Plantation A.D. produced more\r\n  than a &quot;scintilla of evidence&quot; that the Memorandum was supported by\r\n  valuable consideration.Â  \r\nWe find the trial court erred\r\n  in holding as a matter of law the contract was not supported by valuable\r\n  consideration.Â  \r\nII. Conditions precedent\r\nPlantation A.D. argues the\r\n  trial court should not have found conditions precedent at the summary judgment\r\n  stage.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nRespondents assert this\r\n  argument is not preserved because Plantation A.D. failed to make it when\r\n  Respondents raised the issue at the summary judgment hearing.Â  Plantation A.D.\r\n  did not address the issue of conditions precedent at the hearing but did fully\r\n  address the issue in its Rule 59 motion.Â  The Respondents had the burden of\r\n  proof on this issue.Â  See Youmans v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 380\r\n  S.C. 263, 281-82, 670 S.E.2d 1, 10 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating defendant asserting\r\n  an affirmative defense bears the burden of its proof), cert. granted (July\r\n  9, 2009); Floyd v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 285 S.C. 148,\r\n  150, 328 S.E.2d 132, 132 (Ct. App. 1985) (noting defendant asserted as an\r\n  affirmative defense plaintiff had not complied with condition precedent).Â \r\n  Plantation A.D. is not attempting to raise a new theory of law but rather\r\n  simply asserts that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the\r\n  agreement between the parties actually includes the conditions precedent as\r\n  found by the trial court.Â  As the issue of whether the Memorandum included the\r\n  conditions precedent was raised to and ruled on by the trial court, we find the\r\n  issue properly before this court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an issue\r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\nThe trial court found the\r\n  Memorandum contained the following two conditions precedent: Â 1) Gerald\r\n  Builders had to purchase the property from Plantation A.D. (and not from the\r\n  master-in-equity or some other party); and 2) Gerald Builders had to develop\r\n  the property and not simply resell it.Â  \r\n\r\n  A\r\n    condition precedent entails something that is essential to a right of action,\r\n    as opposed to a condition subsequent, which is something relied upon to modify\r\n    or defeat the action. In contract law, the term connotes any fact other than\r\n    the lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of\r\n    immediate performance arises. The question of whether a provision in a contract\r\n    constitutes a condition precedent is a question of construction dependent on\r\n    the intent of the parties to be gathered from the language they employ. \r\n\r\nWorley v. Yarborough Ford,\r\n  Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d\r\n  622, 624 (Ct. App. 1994) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Â  Generally,\r\n  &quot;a condition precedent may not be implied when it might have been provided\r\n  for by the express agreement.&quot; Â Id. at 210, 452 S.E.2d at 625.\r\nThe Memorandum does not\r\n  expressly set forth the conditions precedent as found by the trial court.Â  The\r\n  Respondents assert the condition that Gerald Builders purchase the property\r\n  from Plantation A.D. can be implied from the designation of the parties as\r\n  &quot;Seller&quot; and &quot;Buyer&quot; although the Memorandum clearly states\r\n  it &quot;shall not be deemed as a contract for the sale of Real Estate.&quot; Â Respondents\r\n  also claim the development condition is implied from Paragraph 2, which\r\n  provides for the repayment of a loan to Ralph Jones and Charlie Floyd on a per\r\n  lot basis.Â  The profit participation provision, however, does not include\r\n  similar language concerning payment on a per lot basis.Â  We find the conditions\r\n  cannot as a matter of law be implied from the Memorandum.Â  Accordingly, we hold\r\n  the trial court erred on this issue.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Individual liability of Gerald\r\nPlantation A.D. argues the\r\n  trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to Gerald individually.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nSection 33-6-220(b) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2006) states:Â  &quot;Unless otherwise provided in the\r\n  articles of incorporation, a shareholder of a corporation is not personally\r\n  liable for the acts or debts of the corporation except that he may become\r\n    personally liable by reason of his own acts or conduct.&quot;Â  (Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  This court recognized:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    director or officer of a corporation does not incur personal liability for its\r\n    torts merely by reason of his official character; he is not liable for torts\r\n    committed by or for the corporation unless he has participated in the wrong.Â \r\n    Accordingly, directors not parties to a wrongful act on the part of other\r\n    directors are not liable therefor.Â  If, however, a director or officer commits\r\n    or participates in the commission of a tort, whether or not it is also by or\r\n    for the corporation, he is liable to third persons injured thereby, and it does\r\n    not matter what liability attaches to the corporation for the tort . . . .\r\n\r\nBPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 327, 608 S.E.2d 155, 160 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) (quoting 19 Am.Jur.2d Corporations, Â§ 1382 (2004)).Â  Thus, the\r\n  court held the president of a corporation was not shielded from direct\r\n  liability in tort for his own actions and was personally liable for any\r\n  tortuous acts he participated in or directed. Â Id. at 328, 608 S.E.2d at\r\n  160.\r\n&quot;Conversion is the\r\n  unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or\r\n  personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of the condition or\r\n  the exclusion of the owner's rights.&quot;Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C.\r\n  509, 527, 595 S.E.2d 817, 826 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nThe trial court held Gerald\r\n  was not individually liable for Plantation A.D.'s claims.Â  However, as stated\r\n  above, Gerald's status as an officer or a shareholder of the corporation does\r\n  not automatically shield him from liability.Â  After the sale of the Property to\r\n  Signature Homes, Gerald Builders deposited the profit from the sale into its\r\n  checking account.Â  Since then, Gerald has made disbursements from the account,\r\n  thus assuming ownership of funds allegedly belonging to Plantation A.D.Â  In\r\n  addition, Gerald made representations to Plantation A.D. regarding the\r\n  Memorandum and plans for the property.Â  We find Plantation A.D. has presented evidence\r\n  sufficient to overcome summary judgment that Gerald committed or participated\r\n  in the commission of conversion and fraud.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment to Gerald individually.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reasons,\r\n  the trial court's order granting summary judgment to Gerald Builders and Gerald\r\n  individually is REVERSED and the matter REMANDED to the trial court.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTHOMAS and PIEPER, JJ.,\r\n  concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4633","title":"State v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  Â Gene\r\n  Cooper appeals his convictions for murder, armed robbery, conspiracy to commit\r\n  armed robbery, and kidnapping, arguing the trial court erred in: (1) denying\r\n  Cooper's motion to dismiss the charges against him because his constitutional\r\n  right to a speedy trial was violated; (2) finding Phillip Farmer was an\r\n  unavailable witness and allowing Farmer's prior testimony to be read into the\r\n  record because it denied Cooper his constitutional right to confrontation; and\r\n  (3) ruling Cooper could be impeached with his 1977 convictions for\r\n  housebreaking and grand larceny because the convictions were too remote and\r\nwere highly prejudicial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCooper was indicted in January 1990 for murder,\r\n  kidnapping, armed robbery, forgery, and conspiracy.Â  On February 22, 1991, he\r\n  was convicted on all charges and sentenced to death.Â  However, almost three\r\n  years later, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed Cooper's conviction for murder\r\n  and remanded the case for a new trial.[1]Â \r\n  The Supreme Court affirmed Cooper's convictions for kidnapping, armed robbery,\r\n  forgery, and conspiracy.[2]Â \r\n  The following year, Cooper filed an application for Post Conviction Relief (PCR)\r\n  pertaining to his four non-capital convictions.Â  Counsel for both parties agreed\r\n  that Cooper's retrial for murder should await the disposition of his PCR\r\n  challenge.Â  Following an evidentiary hearing, the PCR court granted Cooper\r\n  relief for all of his non-capital convictions.Â  The State appealed, and the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the granting of PCR.[3]Â \r\n  The State did not petition for rehearing, and the Supreme Court sent the remittitur\r\n  to the Lexington County Circuit Court on August 29, 2002.\r\nAlmost a year\r\n  later, however, Cooper's retrial had still not been scheduled.Â  On July 15,\r\n  2003, Cooper filed an amended demand for speedy trial, and a month later, a\r\n  hearing was held in the circuit court before Judge Westbrook.[4]Â \r\n  During the hearing, the State made a motion to disqualify Cooper's attorney,\r\n  David Bruck, from the case for having contact with Cooper's co-defendant, Bo\r\n  Southerland.Â  Bruck asserted he had no prior knowledge of the State's motion to\r\n  disqualify him from the case.Â  Judge Westbrook took the matter under\r\n  advisement, and set another hearing to discuss the speedy trial and\r\n  disqualification issues.Â  On August 25, 2003, the parties held an in-chambers\r\n  conference to discuss the issues, and at that time, the deputy solicitor stated\r\n  the solicitor's office would call Cooper's case for trial during spring 2004,\r\n  between April and June.\r\nThe\r\n  case was not called in spring 2004, and on February 10, 2005, Cooper filed a\r\n  renewed demand for a speedy trial.Â  Five days later, a hearing on the motion\r\n  was held before Judge Keesley.Â  Cooper moved to have the trial set for June or\r\n  July 2005.Â  The assistant solicitor said he could not set a date without Solicitor\r\n  Donnie Myers being present, and the court should wait to set a date until a\r\n  judge was selected for the case.Â  On April 25, 2005, Judge Keesley ordered the\r\n  case be heard before the end of 2005, or Cooper could move for bail or for\r\n  dismissal of the charges.Â  The order also provided notice was to be given to\r\n  defense counsel of the trial date within thirty days of the order.\r\nThe\r\n  following month, Solicitor Myers filed a motion to disqualify and recuse Cooper's\r\n  attorneys.Â  Myers stated that during Bruck's PCR representation of Cooper,\r\n  Bruck contacted and communicated with Southerland, and obtained statements from\r\n  him exculpating Cooper without approval from Southerland's attorneys.Â  Myers\r\n  asserted Bruck stipulated to the unauthorized communications; thus, Bruck and\r\n  the other attorneys should be removed from the case and prohibited from talking\r\n  with Cooper's newly-appointed attorneys.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCooper\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss all charges for lack of a speedy trial on June 1st.Â  In\r\n  the motion, Bruck stated that in response to Judge Keesley's April 25, 2005 Order,\r\n  he sent an e-mail to the judge opposing counsel's request that the trial be set\r\n  for the first of August because of a conflict with his schedule as a law\r\n  professor at an out-of-state school.[5]Â \r\n  On July 12, 2005, a hearing was held before Judge Keesley concerning Cooper's motion\r\n  for speedy trial; the State's motion to excuse Cooper's counsel; and the\r\n  Eleventh Circuit Solicitor's motion to withdraw from the case due to a conflict\r\n  of interest.Â  The solicitor's office moved to be excused because the deputy solicitor\r\n  was a law clerk to the judge who presided over Cooper's first trial and was\r\n  present for attorney-client issues.[6]Â \r\n  The State also argued Bruck should be removed from the case because of his\r\n  improper contact with Southerland.Â  On July 13, 2005, Judge Keesley filed his\r\n  order, (1) denying the State's motion to remove Cooper's counsel; (2) granting the\r\n  State's motion to disqualify the Eleventh Circuit Solicitor's Office; (3)\r\n  denying Cooper's motion to dismiss; and (4) denying Cooper's motion for bail.\r\nIn\r\n  September 2005, the First Circuit Solicitor's Office was appointed to the case,\r\n  and in December, Chief Justice Toal appointed Judge Pieper to hear the case.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, on December 29, Cooper filed a renewed motion to dismiss all\r\n  charges for lack of a speedy trial, or in the alternative for release on bail.Â \r\n  Cooper re-asserted everything from his prior motions.Â  Cooper also asserted\r\n  that despite Judge Keesley's second order, the State appeared to have taken no\r\n  action other than deliver the file to the Attorney General's Office and request\r\n  assignment of a new solicitor.Â  The State filed a response to Cooper's Motion,\r\n  arguing this case was different from most speedy trial cases involving pre-indictment\r\n  or pre-trial delay because the case had already been tried once.Â  The State\r\n  conceded the length of delay in this case triggered further analysis of the\r\n  reasons the trial was delayed and whether Cooper was prejudiced; however, the\r\n  State claimed the case was delayed for three years and four months, beginning\r\n  from August 29, 2002, the date the Supreme Court sent down the remittitur.Â  The\r\n  State contended Cooper was not prejudiced by the delay because he had already\r\n  been tried and convicted for the crimes.Â  Cooper filed a reply to the State's\r\n  response, asserting the State cited no authority for its position that Cooper's\r\n  rights were diminished by his intervening conviction and appellate reversal,\r\n  and Cooper argued it should have required less time for the State to retry the\r\n  case.Â  Cooper also claimed his many motions for speedy trial differentiated\r\n  this case from other speedy trial cases and weighed heavily in granting his\r\n  motion to dismiss.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 8, 2005, a hearing was held before Judge Pieper concerning the speedy\r\n  trial issue.Â  Judge Pieper issued his order on April 21, 2006, denying Cooper's\r\n  motion.Â  Cooper's second trial was held before Judge Pieper from May 22 to June\r\n  1, 2006.Â  At the conclusion of the State's case and the conclusion of the presentation\r\n  of evidence, Cooper made motions for directed verdict, which were denied.Â  Cooper\r\n  also renewed his motion to dismiss the indictments due to a speedy trial\r\n  violation at the conclusion of all the evidence; however, Judge Pieper denied\r\n  the motion.Â  The jury convicted Cooper of each of the charged offenses.Â  Judge\r\n  Pieper sentenced Cooper to life imprisonment for murder, twenty-five years for\r\n  armed robbery, and five years for conspiracy to commit armed robbery.Â  He did\r\n  not impose a sentence for the kidnapping conviction.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a criminal case,\r\n  the appellate court reviews errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345\r\n  S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The court is bound by the findings of\r\n  the trial court unless they are unsupported by the evidence, clearly wrong, or\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Williams, 326 S.C. 130, 135,\r\n  485 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1997).Â  The reviewing &quot;[c]ourt does not re-evaluate\r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by any\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Speedy Trial\r\nCooper\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charges\r\n  against him because his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to a speedy trial.Â  U.S. Const.\r\n  amend. VI; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14; State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 548,\r\n  647 S.E.2d 144, 155 (2007).Â  &quot;This right 'is designed to minimize the\r\n  possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but\r\n  nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while\r\n  released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and\r\n  the presence of unresolved criminal charges.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting U.S. v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 8 (1982)).Â  There is no universal test to\r\n  determine whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial has been violated.Â  State\r\n    v. Waites, 270 S.C. 104, 107, 240 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1978).Â  \r\nA\r\n  reviewing court should consider four factors when determining whether a\r\n  defendant has been deprived of his or her right to a speedy trial: 1) length of\r\n  the delay; 2) reason for the delay; 3) defendant's assertion of the right; and\r\n  4) prejudice to the defendant.Â  Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530\r\n  (1972); see also State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 75, 480 S.E.2d\r\n  64, 70 (1997).Â  These four factors are related and must be considered together\r\n  with any other relevant circumstances.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 533.Â  &quot;Accordingly,\r\n  the determination that a defendant has been deprived of this right is not based\r\n  on the passage of a specific period of time, but instead is analyzed in terms\r\n  of the circumstances of each case, balancing the conduct of the prosecution and\r\n  the defense.&quot;Â  Pittman, 373 S.C. at 549, 647 S.E.2d at 155.Â  However,\r\n  in Doggett v. U.S., 505 U.S. 647, 652 n.1 (1992), the United States\r\n  Supreme Court suggested in dicta that a delay of more than a year is\r\n  &quot;presumptively prejudicial.&quot;Â  Also, in State v. Waites, our\r\n  supreme court found a two-year and four month delay was sufficient to trigger\r\n  further review.Â  Waites, 270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653.Â  Therefore,\r\n  &quot;a delay may be so lengthy as to require a finding of presumptive\r\n  prejudice, and thus trigger the analysis of the other factors.&quot;Â  Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 549, 647 S.E.2d at 155.\r\nCooper argues the\r\n  delay of forty-four months in bringing his case to trial the second time exceeded\r\n  any delay in almost any reported South Carolina case, and the State's reason\r\n  for the delay was both arbitrary and unreasonable.Â  Cooper argues his many\r\n  motions for speedy trial should be weighted heavily in favor of granting his\r\n  motion to dismiss.Â  He also asserts his incarceration on death row\r\n  &quot;amounted to no small prejudice&quot; and his &quot;anxiety and concern as\r\n  he waited for the state to call his case also cannot be diminished.&quot;Â  He\r\n  further asserts that witnesses' memories were clearly affected by the delay at\r\n  trial.\r\nIn his April 21,\r\n  2006 order denying Cooper's motions, Judge Pieper addressed each of the four Barker factors.Â  As to the length of delay in bringing the case to trial, Judge Pieper\r\n  noted that &quot;a total delay of at least forty-four months [was] sufficient\r\n  to trigger review of the other factors.&quot;[7]Â \r\n  However, he found &quot;the delay was to some degree the result of\r\n  prosecutorial and governmental negligence, and partly justifiable.&quot;Â  He also\r\n  stated that while none of the excuses alone were sufficient to justify the\r\n  delay, when considered together, they sufficiently justified a majority of the\r\n  delay.Â  See Waites, 270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653 (holding\r\n  that the &quot;constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial is protection only\r\n  against delay which is arbitrary or unreasonable&quot;).Â  Specifically, Judge\r\n  Pieper determined the main excuses for the delay were: (1) the complexity of the\r\n  case and the amount of time required to prepare for trial; (2) the Eleventh\r\n  Circuit Solicitor's Office's relocation due to mold contamination and an\r\n  overcrowded docket; (3) confusion over which judge, if any, had been assigned\r\n  to the case; and (4) the recusal of the Eleventh Circuit Solicitor's Office\r\n  from the case in July 2005, preventing the First Circuit Solicitor's Office\r\n  from being appointed until September 2005.Â  Therefore, Judge Pieper concluded\r\n  &quot;the state's conduct in this instance was not apparently willful and was\r\n  largely justifiable.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  considering Cooper's assertion of his right to a speedy trial, Judge Pieper\r\n  noted that &quot;[i]t cannot be argued that since 2003 the defendant ever\r\n  failed to assert his right to a speedy trial&quot; and &quot;nothing in the\r\n  procedural history of the case could support a finding that the defendant\r\n  failed to properly assert his right to a speedy trial.&quot;Â  In consideration\r\n  of the fourth and most important factor, prejudice, Judge Pieper found the main\r\n  prejudice Cooper suffered was pretrial incarceration.\r\nAfter\r\n  weighing the four Barker factors and &quot;the lack of demonstrable\r\n  evidence of trial prejudice,&quot; Judge Pieper determined the\r\n  &quot;presumption of prejudice has been persuasively rebutted&quot;; therefore,\r\n  he denied Cooper's motion.Â  Further, Judge Pieper noted the State withdrew its\r\n  notice to seek the death penalty; thus, the withdrawal could be construed as a\r\n  benefit to Cooper resulting from the delay.Â  See Brazell, 325\r\n  S.C. at 76, 480 S.E.2d at 70-71 (noting the three-year and five-month delay was\r\n  negated by the lack of prejudice to the defense).Â  Therefore, we find Judge\r\n  Pieper's decision was supported by the evidence.\r\nII. Unavailable Witness\r\nCooper\r\n  argues the trial court erred in finding Phillip Farmer was an unavailable\r\n  witness and allowing Farmer's prior testimony to be read into the record\r\n  because it denied Cooper his constitutional right to confrontation.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United\r\n  States is applicable to the States, and the primary interest secured by the\r\n  confrontation clause is the right of cross-examination.Â  State v. Mizzell,\r\n  349 S.C. 326, 330, 563 S.E.2d 315, 317 (2002); Starnes v. State, 307\r\n  S.C. 247, 249, 414 S.E.2d 582, 583 (1991).Â  &quot;The right to confrontation\r\n  has been referred to as a 'trial right.'&quot;Â  Starnes, 307 S.C. at\r\n  249, 414 S.E.2d at 583 (quoting Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 725\r\n  (1968)).Â  This trial right includes the opportunity to cross-examine and have a\r\n  jury weigh the demeanor of the witness.Â  Barber, 390 U.S. at 725 (1968).Â \r\n  Thus, &quot;the appropriate question under the confrontation clause is whether\r\n  there has been any interference with the defendant's opportunity for effective\r\n  cross-examination at trial.&quot;Â  Starnes, 307 S.C. at 250, 414 S.E.2d at\r\n  584.Â  \r\n&quot;[T]here\r\n  has traditionally been an exception to the confrontation requirement where a\r\n  witness is unavailable and has given testimony at previous judicial proceedings\r\n  against the same defendant which was subject to cross-examination by that defendant.&quot;Â  Barber, 390 U.S. at 722.Â  &quot;[A] witness is not 'unavailable' for\r\n  purposes of the foregoing exception to the confrontation requirement unless the\r\n  prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence\r\n  at trial.&quot;[8]Â  Id. at 724-25.Â  Rule 804(a)(5), SCRE, provides that a witness may be\r\n  declared &quot;unavailable&quot; if the declarant &quot;is absent from the\r\n  hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the\r\n  declarant's attendance . . . by process or other reasonable means.&quot;\r\nCooper\r\n  argues the State's efforts to procure Farmer's presence from Texas were unreasonable.Â \r\n  Cooper also asserts the State knew it would be unable to obtain Farmer's presence\r\n  at trial eleven days prior to the trial; however, the State did not make a\r\n  motion for continuance, or even bring the problem to the court's attention.Â  He\r\n  argues the State's failure to have Farmer available to testify in person denied\r\n  him his constitutional right to confrontation because Farmer is a pathological\r\n  liar and it was imperative for the trial jury to observe his demeanor in person.[9]\r\nThe\r\n  State asserted the Solicitor was unable to secure Farmer's presence from a Texas\r\n  penitentiary through a normal out-of-state subpoena because South Carolina is\r\n  not a signatory state to the Uniform Rendition of Prisoners as Witnesses in\r\n  Criminal Proceedings Act (the Act).Â  At trial, the State submitted two affidavits\r\n  in support of its motion to have Farmer declared an &quot;unavailable&quot;\r\n  witness under Rule 804(a)(5): one from Senior Assistant Solicitor B. Harrison Bell,\r\n  and one from James M. Frazier, III, an Assistant General Counsel for the Office\r\n  of General Counsel for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. \r\nIn\r\n  his affidavit, Frazier testified that because South Carolina is not a signatory\r\n  to the Act, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice would not honor a mere\r\n  subpoena for Farmer to appear as a witness in South Carolina.Â  Instead, Texas\r\n  required an executive agreement between the governor of South Carolina and the\r\n  governor of Texas.Â  The prisoner witness must then have a hearing before a\r\n  district judge who will decide whether the prisoner witness will be transported\r\n  to the requesting state.Â  Frazier also testified that Texas will not release a\r\n  prisoner without a hearing and an order of transport from a district judge.Â  He\r\n  further testified there are only two judges in Texas who hold hearings for\r\n  prisoner witness renditions to other states.Â  He confirmed Bell made a request\r\n  to have Farmer transported, and he submitted the appropriate paperwork to\r\n  Texas, which was received on May 10, 2006.Â  Frazier testified he contacted the\r\n  court to set up a hearing; however, neither judge was available for the remainder\r\n  of the month of May.Â  He notified Bell of this on May 11, 2006.Â  He said he had\r\n  &quot;no reason to believe the South Carolina authorities were aware of that\r\n  unavailability before this week when I first informed them of such.&quot; \r\nJudge\r\n  Pieper reviewed the rendition request and noted it was initiated in April, but\r\n  was delayed because a duplicate had not been submitted to the South Carolina Secretary\r\n  of State. Â However, he reviewed the &quot;pertinent procedures and statutory\r\n  requirements&quot; and did not see any requirement to submit a duplicate; thus,\r\n  he did not attribute the delay to the prosecution.Â  He found that both the\r\n  South Carolina and Texas governors had signed the paperwork in early May;\r\n  however, no Texas judge was available to hold the hearing as required by Texas\r\n  law.Â  Thus, Judge Pieper stated &quot;it's difficult for me to say that the\r\n  State acted unreasonably&quot; when Texas did not have any judges available to\r\n  hear the rendition request.Â  Additionally, Judge Pieper noted that Farmer was\r\n  under oath at the first trial and Cooper had engaged in &quot;the full right of\r\n  confrontation.&quot;Â  Judge Pieper further noted that neither party had\r\n  requested a continuance.Â  Therefore, we find Judge Pieper's decision was\r\n  supported by the evidence.\r\nIII. Prior Crimes\r\nCooper\r\n  argues the trial court erred in ruling Cooper could be impeached with his 1977\r\n  convictions for housebreaking and grand larceny because the convictions were\r\n  too remote and were highly prejudicial.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule\r\n  609(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provides:\r\n\r\n  Evidence\r\n    of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten\r\n    years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the\r\n    witness from confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later\r\n    date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the\r\n    probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances\r\n    substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 609(b), SCRE.Â  &quot;Rule\r\n  609(b) establishes a presumption against admissibility of remote convictions .\r\n  . . and the State bears the burden of establishing facts and circumstances\r\n  sufficient to substantially overcome that presumption.&quot;Â  State v. Colf,\r\n  337 S.C. 622, 626-27, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2000).Â  In determining whether the\r\n  probative value of a prior conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect, the\r\n  court should apply five factors: (1) the impeachment value of the prior crime;\r\n  (2) the point in time of the conviction and the witness's subsequent history;\r\n  (3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime; (4) the\r\n  importance of the defendant's testimony; and (5) the centrality of the\r\n  credibility issue.Â  Id. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248.\r\nCooper\r\n  was released from prison in 1988 for his 1977 convictions for armed robbery,\r\n  housebreaking, and grand larceny.[10]Â \r\n  Cooper was being re-tried for a murder that occurred in 1989.Â  Cooper objected\r\n  to the introduction of his prior crimes under Rule 609 because they were more\r\n  than ten years old.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  considering the balancing test required by Rule 609(b), Judge Pieper did not\r\n  allow Cooper's conviction for armed robbery to be used for impeachment because\r\n  of its similarity to the armed robbery in this case.Â  However, Judge Pieper did\r\n  allow Cooper's convictions for housebreaking and larceny to be admitted for\r\n  impeachment purposes because they are crimes of dishonesty that weigh on\r\n  Cooper's credibility, and the probative value of the convictions outweighed their\r\n  prejudicial effect.Â  See Colf, 337 S.C. at 628, 525 S.E.2d at 249\r\n  (&quot;The fact that larceny reflects on credibility and the importance of\r\n  credibility to the jury's decision are both factors the trial court should have\r\n  weighed in making the admissibility determination.&quot;).Â  Additionally,\r\n  Cooper's attorney conceded the crimes of housebreaking and larceny were not so\r\n  similar to the charge in this case to be prejudicial to Cooper.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Judge Pieper gave a limiting charge to the jury explaining Cooper's convictions\r\n  could only be considered for impeachment purposes.Â  Therefore, we find Judge\r\n  Pieper's decision was supported by the evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See State v. Cooper, 312 S.C. 90, 439\r\n  S.E.2d 276 (1994).Â  \r\n[2] Cooper remained incarcerated from his arrest in 1989\r\n  until his retrial in 2006.\r\n[3]Â  See State v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 330 (2002).\r\n[4] Cooper's motion was titled &quot;Defendant's Amended\r\n  Demand for Speedy Trial,&quot; but the record does not contain a copy of an\r\n  un-amended motion.\r\n[5]Â  Bruck also sent copies of the e-mail to opposing\r\n  counsel.\r\n[6] The motion to have the solicitor's office removed was\r\n  not made known to Cooper until a June 29, 2005 letter.\r\n[7]Â  We note the forty-four month delay in re-trying\r\n  Cooper's case is troubling; however, in this case, we find it was justifiable.\r\n[8]Â  In Barber v. Page, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court found Barber's right to confrontation had been violated when &quot;the\r\n  State made absolutely no effort to obtain the presence of [the witness] at\r\n  trial other than to ascertain that he was in a federal prison outside of\r\n  Oklahoma.&quot;Â  390 U.S. at 723.Â  Further, the Court found the &quot;sole\r\n  reason why [the witness] was not present to testify in person was because the\r\n  State did not attempt to seek his presence.&quot;Â  Id. at 725.Â  In\r\n  contrast, here, the State attempted to have Farmer brought to South Carolina to\r\n  testify, but was unable to do so due to circumstances beyond the State's\r\n  control.\r\n[9]Â  At trial, the State introduced Farmer's previous\r\n  testimony that he called Cooper to initiate a conspiracy between himself and\r\n  Cooper to rob the decedent.Â  To impeach Farmer's previous testimony, Cooper\r\n  introduced the testimony of Kimberly Turner, a Ph.D. student in clinical\r\n  psychology who had interviewed Farmer in jail.Â  In Farmer's new statement to\r\n  Turner, he stated he had only heard from Cooper after the murder, and he was\r\n  &quot;completely surprised&quot; by the phone call.Â  Farmer told her that he had\r\n  put a &quot;spin&quot; on his testimony in favor of the State at the first trial\r\n  to make &quot;Cooper look worse than he was.&quot;Â  He said he wanted to\r\n  &quot;tell the truth this time.&quot;\r\n[10]Â  Cooper pleaded guilty to armed robbery,\r\n  housebreaking, and grand larceny, and received a sentence of fifteen years.Â  He\r\n  was released from prison in 1988 for his 1977 convictions.Â  Cooper was arrested\r\n  for murder that occurred in 1989 and his retrial was in May 2006.Â  Thus,\r\n  although eighteen years had passed between his release for his prior convictions\r\n  and his retrial for murder, Cooper's 1988 release for the prior crimes was very\r\n  close in time to the October 1989 offenses for which he was being retried.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4631","title":"Stringer v.

Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAndrew\r\n  F. Stringer, III paid a premium of $424.76 to State Farm in exchange for a six-month\r\n  automobile insurance policy that provided coverage from February 15, 2002, to\r\n  August 15, 2002.Â  The policy stated the premium was subject to increase &quot;during\r\n  the policy period based upon corrected, completed, or changed\r\n  information.&quot;Â  During the policy period, a policy adjustment caused\r\n  Stringer's premium to increase by $47.25.[1]Â \r\n  State Farm sent a bill to Stringer for this increase in premium, which he\r\n  failed to pay.Â  On July 11, 2002, State Farm mailed a notice of cancellation to\r\n  Stringer, informing him the policy would be cancelled on July 29, 2002, unless\r\n  he paid $47.25 on or before that date.[2] Â The notice further stated that payment after July 29, 2002, would reinstate\r\n  the policy, however, &quot;[t]here [would be] no coverage between the date and\r\n  time of cancellation and the date and time of reinstatement.&quot;Â  Stringer\r\n  took no action in response to this notice.Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 31, 2002, Stringer was involved in an automobile accident with an\r\n  uninsured driver.Â  Subsequently, Stringer notified State Farm employee Sherri Jennings\r\n  of the accident.Â  Stringer testified Jennings informed him there would be\r\n  uninterrupted coverage if he paid the $47.25 due.[3]Â \r\n  On August 2, Stringer paid the additional premium, and Jennings issued a\r\n  receipt and mailed a form FR-10 to the Department of Motor Vehicles verifying\r\n  that Stringer had valid coverage on the date of the accident.Â  \r\nUltimately,\r\n  State Farm refused to pay Stringer's claim under the policy, contending the\r\n  policy was not in effect when the accident occurred.Â  Stringer commenced this\r\n  action to determine whether coverage existed at the time of the accident.Â  The\r\n  trial court ruled Stringer was entitled to uninterrupted coverage because he\r\n  fulfilled his obligations under the policy by paying the entire premium prior\r\n  to the expiration of the six-month policy period.Â  In addition, the trial court\r\n  found Jennings's post-accident and post-cancellation representations of\r\n  coverage precluded State Farm from denying coverage. Â State Farm appealed.Â  In\r\n  a split decision, a three-judge panel of this court affirmed the trial court's\r\n  order. Â See Stringer v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., Op. No.\r\n  4474 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Dec. 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sheet No. 48 at 68-78).Â \r\n  We granted State Farm's petition for en banc review. \r\nISSUES\r\nWhether the trial court erred in finding Stringer was\r\n  entitled to uninterrupted automobile insurance coverage after receiving a\r\n  notice of cancellation from State Farm based on:Â  (I) the language of the\r\n  policy or (II) representations of coverage by a State Farm employee.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law.Â  Nationwide\r\n    Mut. Ins. Co. v. Prioleau, 359 S.C. 238, 241, 597 S.E.2d 165, 167 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial court based\r\n  its ruling on an error of law or on a factual conclusion without evidentiary\r\n  support.Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E Underwriters Risk\r\n    Retention Group, 347 S.C. 333, 338, 554 S.E.2d 870, 873 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Policy Language\r\nState\r\n  Farm contends the trial court erred in construing the terms of the policy\r\n  liberally in favor of Stringer without finding the policy ambiguous.Â  In\r\n  addition, State Farm argues the trial court erred in finding the language of\r\n  the policy provided for continuous and uninterrupted coverage on the date of\r\n  Stringer's accident.Â  We agree in part.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAmbiguous terms in an insurance policy must be construed\r\n  liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. Â Diamond\r\n    State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d\r\n  912, 915 (1995).Â  &quot;However, in cases where there is no ambiguity,\r\n  contracts of insurance, like other contracts, must be construed according to\r\n  the terms which the parties have used, to be taken and understood in their\r\n  plain, ordinary and popular sense.&quot;Â  Garrett v. Pilot Life Ins. Co.,\r\n  241 S.C. 299, 304, 128 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1962).Â  \r\nIn our view, the\r\n  trial court neither found the policy ambiguous nor construed the policy in\r\n  favor of Stringer.Â  In its order, the trial court\r\n  determined Stringer was covered under the policy because he &quot;complied with\r\n  the terms of the insurance contract, drafted by State Farm, in that he made all\r\n  of his premium payments . . . before the end of the current policy\r\n  period.&quot;Â  While the trial court referenced the proposition of law\r\n  requiring courts to construe an ambiguous insurance policy in favor of the\r\n  insured, it never made any specific findings of fact to support the conclusion the\r\n  policy in question is ambiguous as a matter of law.[4]Â  Because the trial court did not find\r\n  the policy to be ambiguous, we review only the plain language of the\r\n  insurance policy to determine whether any evidence supports the trial court's\r\n  ruling that Stringer was entitled to uninterrupted coverage.Â  See USAA Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 655, 661 S.E.2d 791, 797 (2008) (&quot;Courts\r\n  must enforce, not write, contracts of insurance, and their language must be\r\n  given its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.&quot; (quoting Sloan Constr.\r\n    Co. v. Cent. Nat'l Ins. Co. of Omaha, 269 S.C. 183, 185, 236 S.E.2d 818,\r\n  819 (1997))).Â Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  found Stringer entitled to uninterrupted coverage because he complied with the\r\n  terms of the insurance policy by paying the additional premium prior to the end\r\n  of the policy period on August 15, 2002.Â  The trial court relied solely on the following policy provision in\r\n  making this finding:Â  &quot;[t]he policy period is shown . . . on the\r\n  declarations page and is for successive periods of six months each for which you\r\n  pay the renewal premium.Â  Payments must be made on or before the end of the\r\n    current policy period.&quot;Â  (Emphasis added by trial court).Â  The trial\r\n  court erred in isolating the statement &quot;[p]ayments must be made on or\r\n  before the end of the current policy period,&quot; from its proper context.Â  See Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins.\r\n    Co., 266 S.C. 584, 593, 225 S.E.2d\r\n  344, 349 (1976) (&quot;[T]he meaning of a particular word or phrase is\r\n  not determined by considering the word or phrase by itself, but by reading the\r\n  policy as a whole and considering the context and subject matter of the\r\n  insurance contract.&quot; (citing 13 Appleman Ins. Law and Practice, Â§ 7382, p.\r\n  43-45 (1976))); Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C.\r\n  636, 643, 216 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1975) (&quot;[T]he parties have a right to make\r\n  their own contract and it is not the function of this Court to rewrite it or\r\n  torture the meaning of a policy to extend coverage never intended by the\r\n  parties.&quot;).Â  In proper\r\n  context, this sentence clearly refers to renewal and provides that payments of\r\n  renewal premiums must be made before the end of the current policy period.Â \r\n  This sentence does not contemplate whether the insured's payment of an\r\n  additional premium before the expiration of the current policy period provides\r\n  for uninterrupted coverage.Â  Accordingly, the trial court\r\n  erred in failing to consider the context in which this provision appears.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the language of the insurance policy as a whole, no evidence supports\r\n  the trial court's conclusion that Stringer was entitled to uninterrupted\r\n  coverage.Â  The policy in question provides that the initial $424.76 premium was\r\n  subject to increase &quot;during the policy period based upon corrected,\r\n  completed, or changed information.&quot;Â  Further, pursuant to the policy,\r\n  Stringer agreed to pay any additional premium that might become due during the\r\n  policy period.Â Â  In this case, changed information caused an additional premium\r\n  of $47.25 to be due in order to keep the policy in effect until August 15,\r\n  2002.Â  State Farm sent two notifications to Stringer, informing him that\r\n  failure to pay the additional premium on or before July 29, 2002, would result\r\n  in cancellation of the policy on that date.Â  State Farm specifically retained\r\n  the right to cancel the policy for failure to pay the premium when due as the\r\n  policy states: &quot;[State Farm] will not cancel your policy before the end of\r\n  the current policy period unless . . . you fail to pay the premium when\r\n  due.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Stringer's failure to pay the increase in premium by July 29, 2002,\r\n  effectively cancelled his coverage under the plain language of the policy on\r\n  that date.Â  Thus, when Stringer was involved in an automobile accident two days\r\n  later, he was not covered under the policy.Â  In addition, the cancellation\r\n  notice specifically and unequivocally provided that &quot;[t]here is no\r\n  coverage between the date and time of cancellation and the date and time of\r\n  reinstatement.&quot;Â  Thus, Stringer's payment of $47.25 on August 2 failed to\r\n  provide coverage from the date his policy was cancelledâ€“July 29â€“to the date his\r\n  policy was reinstatedâ€“August 3.[5]Â \r\n  While payment of the additional premium reinstated Stringer's coverage from\r\n  August 3 to the end of the policy period, the payment of the additional premium\r\n  could not resurrect the policy to provide coverage during the gap between July\r\n  29, 2002, and August 3, 2002.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding\r\n  payment of the additional premium during the policy period provided for\r\n  uninterrupted coverage.[6]Â  \r\nII. Employee Representation\r\nFinally, State Farm argues the trial court erred in\r\n  finding uninterrupted coverage based on post-accident and post-cancellation\r\n  representations of coverage made by Jennings.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding Stringer's failure to plead estoppel\r\n  in this action at law, such a defense still fails on the merits.Â  See Rule 8(c), SCRCP (stating that all affirmative defenses shall be pleaded); see\r\n    also Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 21, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (finding that estoppel must be &quot;affirmatively pleaded as a defense\r\n  and cannot be bootstrapped onto another claim&quot;).Â  In appropriate\r\n  circumstances, estoppel can be used to prevent the insurer from denying\r\n  coverage to the insured.Â  Koren v. Nat'l Home Life Assurance Co., 277\r\n  S.C. 404, 407, 288 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1982).Â  In order to prevail on a claim of\r\n  estoppel, the insured must demonstrate:Â  (1) lack of\r\n  knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in\r\n  question; (2) reasonable reliance on the other party's conduct; and (3) a\r\n  prejudicial change in position.Â  Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 477, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\nHere, the trial court did not find\r\n  uninterrupted coverage based on estoppel.[7]Â  Rather, the trial court concluded\r\n  Stringer was entitled to uninterrupted coverage because he reasonably relied on\r\n  Jennings's representations of coverage.Â  As the elements of estoppel make clear,\r\n  reasonable reliance alone does not provide a basis upon which to prevent State\r\n  Farm from denying coverage.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in determining\r\n  reasonable reliance sufficiently bound State Farm to coverage.Â Â  \r\nIn addition, nothing in the record demonstrates Stringer\r\n  satisfied the remaining elements of estoppel.Â  Namely, Stringer has failed to\r\n  prove that he suffered a prejudicial change in position or detrimentally relied\r\n  on the representations of Jennings.Â  See Queen's Grant II Horizontal\r\n    Prop. Regime v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 359, 628 S.E.2d 902,\r\n  912 (Ct. App. 2006) (indicating the lack of detrimental reliance is fatal to a\r\n  claim of estoppel).Â  Stringer has failed to do so because Jennings'\r\n  representation of coverage occurred after the accident took place.Â \r\n  While our appellate courts have prevented insurance companies from denying\r\n  coverage, they have done so when the insurer, or its agent, makes\r\n  representations of coverage before the loss occurred.Â  See Riddle-Duckworth,\r\n    Inc. v. Sullivan, 253 S.C. 411, 424, 171 S.E.2d 486, 492 (1969) (holding an\r\n  insured was entitled to rely on representations that he was &quot;fully\r\n  covered&quot;; accordingly, when an accident later occurred, the insurer could\r\n  not deny coverage); Giles v. Landford &amp; Gibson, Inc., 285 S.C. 285,\r\n  289, 328 S.E.2d 916, 918-19 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding that when an insured\r\n  specifically requested particular coverage and an employee, in writing the\r\n  policy, represented the policy provided such coverage, the insurer could not\r\n  deny coverage when the loss subsequently occurred).Â  These cases are not\r\n  analogous to the case sub judice because here, the representation of\r\n  coverage occurred after the loss.Â  \r\nAs we stated in dictum in Jones\r\n  v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., &quot;[The Appellant] cites no legal authority\r\n  establishing that a policy, once effectively canceled, can somehow become\r\n  renascent by virtue of a qualified representation of coverage by an agent after\r\n  a loss.&quot;Â  364 S.C. 222, 236, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Similarly, we have failed to find any legal authority to\r\n  support this proposition.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in determining\r\n  Stringer was entitled to uninterrupted coverage based on representations of\r\n  coverage made by Jennings after the accident.Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause\r\n  neither the plain language of the policy nor the representations made to\r\n  Stringer operate to provide uninterrupted coverage or to resurrect the policy,\r\nthe ruling of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED.[8]\r\nHEARN, C.J., WILLIAMS, PIEPER, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., CURETON,\r\nA.J., concur.\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ., dissent.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and SHORT, JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; We\r\n  would affirm the judgment of the court below, and therefore, we respectfully\r\n  dissent from the majority opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing so, we adopt the\r\n  opinion of Judge Ralph King Anderson, Jr. that originally constituted the\r\n  majority opinion of the panel that heard this case. Â See Stringer v.\r\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., Op. No. 4474 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Dec. 23,\r\n  2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 48 at 68).&nbsp; \r\n\r\n[1] The trial court found the increase in premium was due\r\n  to the addition of a driver to the policy at the request of Stringer.Â  On\r\n  appeal, State Farm takes exception to this finding and argues a traffic\r\n  accident in October 2001 caused Stringer's premium to increase.Â  The cause for\r\nthe increase in premium is of no consequence to our analysis.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The policy allowed State Farm to cancel Stringer's\r\npolicy for failure to pay the premium when due. Â \r\n[3]Â  At trial, Jennings denied making this statement.Â  \r\n[4]Â  We further hold that even if the trial court found\r\nthe policy ambiguous, this was error.Â  \r\n[5] Although payment was made on August 2, Stringer's\r\npolicy was not reinstated until the following day.Â  \r\n[6] We note Jeffrey v. Sunshine Recycling, Op. No.\r\n  4626 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 28, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 47), in\r\n  which this court found no lapse in workers' compensation coverage occurred\r\n  because a reinstatement notice failed to specifically identify any coverage\r\n  lapse.Â  In Jeffrey, according to section II.D.5 of the Assigned Risk\r\n  Plan of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan Operating\r\n  Rules and Procedures, any lapse in coverage should have been specifically\r\n  identified.Â  Thus, Jeffrey is distinguishable from this case as there is\r\n  no such policy language, nor is this matter within the realm of workers'\r\ncompensation law.Â  \r\n[7]Â  We also note that the record indicates Stringer\r\nstated that recovery was not being sought on an estoppel theory.\r\n[8] In light of our decision on the aforementioned issues,\r\n  it is not necessary for this court to address State Farm's additional arguments\r\n  on appeal. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that an appellate court\r\n  need not address remaining issues when a decision on a prior issue is\r\ndispositive).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
