We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n                                    FACTS\r\n\r\n        Allegro is a professional employer organization (\"PEO\") that was\r\nformed in the late 1990s by its initial owner, Mary Etta McCarthy. A PEO\r\nprovides human resource services for companies wanting to outsource that\r\nfunction. Scully joined Allegro in August of 1998 as president and a member\r\nof its board of directors. He was also given thirty percent of Allegro's stock.\r\nThe remaining directors consisted of Allegro's majority owner, McCarthy,\r\nand one of Allegro's clients, Frank Brown. Between 1998 and 2001, Scully's\r\nownership interest in Allegro increased to forty-nine percent, with McCarthy\r\nowning the remaining fifty-one percent.\r\n\r\n      There was no written employment contract or non-compete agreement\r\nbetween Allegro and Scully. Furthermore, Allegro did not have an employee\r\nhandbook that was issued to or utilized by Allegro's employees. However,\r\nthere was a Partnership/Buy-Sell Agreement negotiated by Scully and\r\nMcCarthy at the time Scully joined Allegro which governed the percentage\r\nand change in ownership of Allegro.1\r\n\r\n      McCarthy was actively involved in Allegro's management until Scully\r\njoined and took over the day-to-day operations. Scully testified that as\r\npresident, he was entrusted with managing the operations in the best interest\r\n\r\n1   Brown was not a party to this agreement.\r\n\nof Allegro along with financial oversight of the company. Beginning in late\r\n2002 or early 2003, Scully expressed his frustration about the business to his\r\nfriend, Corbin, who was also a certified public accountant (CPA). In addition\r\nto being Scully's personal friend, Corbin's company, Merritt, was a client of\r\nAllegro. Corbin advised Scully of three ways to deal with the situation: (1)\r\nScully could buy out McCarthy; (2) McCarthy could buy out Scully; or (3)\r\nScully could start his own business. Scully then consulted with Corbin about\r\nhow to make an offer to purchase McCarthy's interest in Allegro. In March\r\nof 2003, Corbin issued a letter to Scully outlining three approaches for\r\ndetermining a fair purchase price for McCarthy's shares in Allegro. In\r\nclosing, Corbin stated:\r\n\r\n           The overall issue here is that something needs to\r\n           happen. The ongoing tension between you and Mary\r\n           Etta is obvious. That has to be tiring for both of you.\r\n           It is also probably obvious to employees. Either way,\r\n           it is not healthy for the business. The business has a\r\n           better chance of success without that tension. If one\r\n           of you has to sell out to relieve it, then that is what\r\n           needs to happen.\r\n\r\n      In the spring of 2003, Scully informed McCarthy that he wanted to\r\npurchase her ownership interest in Allegro. Scully also discussed his\r\nproposal with Allegro's third director, Brown. During his conversation with\r\nBrown, Scully informed Brown that if he could not purchase McCarthy's\r\nshares, he would set up his own PEO business. Over the course of a series of\r\ndiscussions with McCarthy in 2003, Scully told her that if they could not\r\nagree upon a price at which she would sell her ownership interest in Allegro,\r\nhe would leave the company and form a competing company, taking\r\nemployees and clients with him. In response to these conversations,\r\nMcCarthy suggested they have Allegro valued to determine the price of her\r\ninterest. After McCarthy hired the Geneva Corporation (Geneva) to conduct\r\na valuation study, Corbin reviewed the study and provided feedback to Scully\r\nat Scully's request.\r\n\r\n      On December 24, 2003, McCarthy received a letter from Scully\r\noffering to purchase her shares, setting forth two options as to the purchase\r\n\nprice, and asking for her response by January 23, 2004. Prior to sending\r\nMcCarthy the offer, Scully had asked Corbin to review it and Corbin advised\r\nthat it was a fair offer. McCarthy received a subsequent letter from Scully on\r\nJanuary 23, 2004, restating his offer. On January 29, 2004, McCarthy\r\nresponded with a written counteroffer. Scully replied in a February 2, 2004\r\nletter, stating, \"if we are unable to come to terms the result is a lose, lose, lose\r\nfor everyone involved. If I leave Allegro and start a new PEO we will be in\r\ncompetition for the same customers and employees.\"\r\n\r\n       Having failed to reach an agreement regarding the purchase of Allegro,\r\nScully gave his letter of resignation to McCarthy on February 16, 2004.\r\nMcCarthy then told Scully she would accept his last offer to purchase her\r\nownership interest in Allegro. They agreed her lawyers would draw up the\r\nnecessary paperwork by the end of that week. After that conversation, Scully\r\nleft town on a business trip for Allegro. While Scully was out of town,\r\nMcCarthy decided she did not want to sell her ownership interest after all and\r\nfocused her efforts on retaining Allegro. During Scully's absence, McCarthy\r\nmet with Jim Everly, whom she hired to replace Scully as Allegro's president.\r\nMcCarthy met with Scully on February 23, 2004, and presented Scully with a\r\nletter accepting his resignation. Immediately following Scully's departure\r\nfrom the company, McCarthy and Everly held a meeting with all Allegro\r\nemployees during which time they were told they must sign non-compete\r\ncontracts. Yarborough was an employee of Allegro from 2000 until 2004.\r\nAt the meeting with McCarthy and Everly, Yarborough and another\r\nemployee, Lisa Milliken, refused to sign the non-compete contracts.\r\n\r\n      McCarthy and Everly contacted all of Allegro's clients to inform them\r\nScully was no longer employed by Allegro and made arrangements to meet\r\nwith each client. They first met with Corbin of Merritt, who told them that\r\ndue to his personal friendship with Scully, Merritt's business would likely go\r\nto Scully's new company, Synergetic. Pursuant to Merritt's contract with\r\nAllegro, Corbin sent a thirty day notice in the form of a letter on February 27,\r\n2004, announcing its termination of their contract as of March 31, 2004.\r\nLetters from other clients terminating their contracts with Allegro shortly\r\nfollowed.\r\n\n      After his departure from Allegro, Scully formed his new company,\r\nSynergetic. On March 1, 2004, Yarborough resigned as an employee of\r\nAllegro and began working for Synergetic on March 2, 2004. Millikin also\r\nresigned from her position with Allegro on March 1, 2004, and subsequently\r\nbecame an employee of Synergetic.\r\n\r\n      On April 15, 2004, Allegro initiated this action by filing a complaint\r\nagainst Scully, Yarborough, Corbin, and Synergetic. On that same date,\r\nAllegro filed a motion for a temporary injunction, seeking to enjoin Scully,\r\nYarborough, and Synergetic from soliciting business from Allegro's clients.\r\nThat motion was granted in an eleven page order after a hearing on October\r\n14, 2004.\r\n\r\n      At the close of Allegro's case, as well as at the close of all evidence,\r\nboth sides moved for directed verdicts. These motions were denied. The trial\r\ncourt then submitted to the jury eleven of the claims asserted by Allegro.2\r\nNine of the claims applied to Scully alone,3 one claim applied to Yarborough\r\nalone,4 and one claim applied jointly to Scully, Yarborough, and Corbin.5\r\nThe jury's special verdict form listed each of the eleven causes of action and\r\nasked two questions for each charge: (1) whether the plaintiff had proven\r\nthat claim; and (2) if the claim had been proven, the amount of actual\r\ndamages and punitive damages (where appropriate) the jury awarded as to\r\neach claim.\r\n\r\n     During deliberations, the jury sent a question to the trial court asking\r\nwhether they should list the damages specific to each cause of action\r\n\r\n2 Allegro acknowledges no claims against Synergetic, Inc. were submitted to\r\nthe jury; Synergetic joins this appeal because the issue was not addressed in\r\nthe trial court's orders denying the Appellants' post-trial motions.\r\n3 Scully was the sole defendant on charges of breach of contract, breach of\r\ncontract with fraudulent intent, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of\r\nfiduciary duty, breach of duty of loyalty, gross negligence, violation of\r\nsection 33-8-310 of the South Carolina Code, and violation of section 33-8-\r\n420(a) of the South Carolina Code.\r\n4 Yarborough was the sole defendant on one breach of loyalty charge.\r\n5 Scully, Yarborough, and Corbin were jointly charged with civil conspiracy.\r\n\nindividually, or place the overall total amount the jury decided to award. In\r\ndiscussing the verdict with the foreperson, using apples as the hypothetical\r\naward, the trial court stated, \"You give a certain number of apples for each\r\ncause of action. And that's all you are worried about. And there are some\r\nlaw related matters that I will take care of as a Judge . . . .\" The foreperson\r\nstated she understood the concept, and the trial court continued:\r\n\r\n            So, for each cause of action depends on the breach of\r\n            duty or [contract or] whatever you may find give a\r\n            number, assign a value that you have been -- if the\r\n            [p]laintiff's have [proven] to you by the greater\r\n            weight of preponderance of evidence they are entitled\r\n            to two apples on this one or three on that one or four\r\n            on that one, that's the way you do it and don't worry\r\n            about the total.6\r\n\r\n       The jury returned a verdict for Allegro on all eleven causes of action.\r\nThe jury awarded actual damages in the amount of $160,000 for each of the\r\ncauses of action. Furthermore, the jury awarded $75,000 in punitive damages\r\non the breach of loyalty claim against Yarborough, and $175,000 in punitive\r\ndamages on the civil conspiracy claim against Scully, Yarborough, and\r\nCorbin jointly. The jury's verdict form shows that an award of $1,760,000\r\nhad initially been entered in the designated space for actual damages for the\r\nfirst cause of action, but it was struck through and replaced with $160,000.\r\n\r\n      Once the jury verdict was announced, the foreperson was questioned as\r\nto the total number of \"apples\" they intended to award Allegro, and their\r\nresponse was $1,760,000. The court then asked \"What about punitive\r\ndamages in terms of the total number of apples you wanted to give to\r\n[Allegro]?\" The foreperson said the jury wanted to give $250,000 total to\r\nAllegro. The court finally stated, \"We can add it up but your mathematician\r\nsays it was the intent of this jury to award [Allegro] $2,010,000,\" to which\r\n\r\n6 It is unclear whether the trial court addressed the issue of the jury's verdict\r\nsolely with the foreperson, or in the presence of the entire jury. This court\r\nstrongly warns the trial bench of the danger of interacting with only the\r\nforeperson on substantive matters.\r\n\nthe foreperson agreed. As a final review, the trial court said, \"Actual damage\r\n1.7 million and the remainder of that sum is punitive damages totaling in the\r\namount of $2,010,000.\" Subsequently, no change was made to the verdict\r\nform by either the jury or the judge and no change was requested by Allegro.\r\n\r\n      The trial court completed a Form 4 order, which stated the total amount\r\nof actual and punitive damages and their grand total of $2,010,000. The\r\nForm 4 order did not state that these amounts applied to all, or any, of the\r\nindividual Appellants, but the special verdict form was attached showing the\r\nspecific damages awards. Further, the Form 4 order gave no indication that\r\nthe jury's verdict, as stated on the special verdict form, had been changed,\r\naltered, or modified in any way.\r\n\r\n       In their post-trial motions, Appellants moved for an election of\r\nremedies and asserted grounds for JNOV and a new trial. On July 14, 2008,\r\nthe trial court denied all of Appellants' post-trial motions.7 In denying the\r\nmotion for an election of remedies, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\n           Based upon the verdict form and the conversations\r\n           with the jury before and after its verdict, I am\r\n           convinced the jury intended to award $1.76 Million\r\n           Dollars in actual damages for each cause of action,\r\n           and that it intended to award $250,000 in punitive\r\n           damages on the two causes of action. I am further\r\n           convinced that the jury's apportionment of the verdict\r\n           amongst the various causes of action does not reflect\r\n           a finding that the Plaintiff suffered only $160,000.00\r\n           in actual damages. Thus, entering judgment for the\r\n           Plaintiff in the total amount of $1.76 Million Dollars\r\n           in actual damages and $250,000.00 in punitive\r\n           damages does not give rise to a double recovery.\r\n\r\n      On July 23, 2008, Appellants filed a motion to amend and/or set aside\r\nthe July 14, 2008 order. This motion was also denied in an order by the trial\r\n\r\n7 Prior to this order, Appellants submitted their objections to the proposed\r\norder.\r\n\ncourt on April 5, 2010.8 The trial court stated that in its May 5, 2006 Form 4\r\norder, it reformed the jury's verdict, changing it from eleven separate actual\r\ndamages awards of $160,000 and two punitive damages awards of $75,000\r\nand $175,000, which resulted in different totals against different defendants,\r\nto one total verdict of $2,010,000 against all the defendants. The trial court\r\nfurther stated any issue regarding this \"reformation\" of the jury's verdict not\r\nbeing coupled with the option of a new trial was waived because the issue\r\n\"was not raised in Defendants' post-trial motions.\"\r\n\r\n                              ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n     1. Did the trial court err in admitting the order granting a preliminary\r\n        injunction to Allegro into evidence?\r\n\r\n     2. Did the trial court err in admitting McHenry's report into evidence?\r\n\r\n     3. Did the trial court err in qualifying McHenry as an expert in the field of\r\n        \"damages\"?\r\n\r\n     4. Did the trial court err in excluding evidence that Appellants allege was\r\n        relevant to the issue of Allegro's damages as well as Allegro's failure to\r\n        mitigate those damages?\r\n\r\n     5. Did the trial court err in denying Appellants' directed verdict and JNOV\r\n        motions in regards to civil conspiracy?\r\n\r\n     6. Did the trial court err in denying Appellants' directed verdict and JNOV\r\n        motions in regards to the contract claims?\r\n\r\n     7. Did the trial court err in denying Appellants' directed verdict and JNOV\r\n        motions in regards to the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims?\r\n\r\n     8. Did the trial court err in reforming the jury verdict?\r\n\r\n     9. Did the trial court err in not requiring an election of remedies?\r\n\r\n8   The Appellants objected to the 2010 order prior to its entry as well.\r\n\n                             LAW/ANALYSIS \n\r\n\r\n   I.    Evidentiary Errors\r\n\r\n      \"'The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion\r\nof the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an\r\nabuse of discretion.'\" State v. Byers, 392 S.C. 438, 444, 710 S.E.2d 55, 57-58\r\n(2011) (quoting State v. Williams, 386 S.C. 503, 509, 690 S.E.2d 62, 65\r\n(2010)). \"'An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based\r\non an error of law.'\" Id. at 444, 710 S.E.2d at 58 (quoting State v. McDonald,\r\n343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000)). A finding of abuse of\r\ndiscretion does not end the analysis, however, \"because to warrant reversal\r\nbased on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appealing party must\r\nshow both the error of the ruling and prejudice.\" Fields v. J. Haynes Waters\r\nBuilders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 557, 658 S.E.2d 80, 86 (2008). \"Prejudice is a\r\nreasonable probability that the jury's verdict was influenced by the challenged\r\nevidence or the lack thereof.\" Id.\r\n\r\n         a. Preliminary Injunction Order\r\n\r\n      Appellants argue the trial court erred in admitting the temporary\r\ninjunction order into evidence. We agree.\r\n\r\n      First, we will address the threshold issue of preservation. For an\r\nobjection to be preserved for appellate review, the objection must be made at\r\nthe time the evidence is presented. State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58, 609\r\nS.E.2d 520, 523 (2005). Further, it must be made with sufficient specificity\r\n\"to inform the trial court of the point being urged by the objector.\" Wilder\r\nCorp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998). However,\r\nwhen the evidence is inherently prejudicial, the grounds for the objection are\r\npatent, and the issue will be found preserved. Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola\r\nBottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, 43-47, 426 S.E.2d 756, 757-58 (1993) (holding a\r\nrequest that a voir dire question regarding insurance coverage \"not be\r\ncharged\" was sufficient to preserve the issue, because even though specific\r\ngrounds were not stated, the grounds were patent because the voir dire\r\nquestion was so inherently prejudicial).\r\n\n       We will examine whether a preliminary injunction order is inherently\r\nprejudicial, thus making the grounds of the objection to its admittance patent.\r\nAn applicant for a preliminary injunction must allege sufficient facts to state\r\na cause of action for injunction and demonstrate that this relief is reasonably\r\nnecessary to preserve the rights of the parties during the litigation. Cnty. of\r\nRichland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App.\r\n2002). One of the elements the applicant must establish is that he has a\r\nlikelihood of success on the merits. Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes W.\r\nResidential Golf Props., Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 121, 603 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2004);\r\nsee Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 481, 167\r\nS.E.2d 313, 315 (1969) (\"It is well settled that, in determining whether a\r\ntemporary injunction should issue, the merits of the case are not to be\r\nconsidered, except in so far as they may enable the court to determine\r\nwhether a prima facie showing has been made. When a prima facie showing\r\nhas been made entitling plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction\r\nwill be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the\r\nmerits.\"). A temporary injunction is granted without prejudice to the rights of\r\neither party pending a hearing on the merits, and \"when other issues are\r\nbrought to trial, they are determined without reference to the temporary\r\ninjunction.\" Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d\r\n824, 826 (1992) (citing Alston v. Limehouse, 60 S.C. 559, 569, 39 S.E. 188,\r\n191 (1901) (stating \"no fact decided upon such motion [for a temporary\r\ninjunction] is concluded thereby, and when the other issues are brought to\r\ntrial they are to be determined without reference to said orders\")). The\r\npurpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo and prevent\r\nirreparable harm to the party requesting it. Powell v. Immanuel Baptist\r\nChurch, 261 S.C. 219, 221, 199 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1973).\r\n\r\n        In the case at bar, the order included approximately four and a half\r\npages of \"Findings of Fact\" by the trial court, as well as this statement by the\r\ntrial court:The Court carefully considered the pleadings,\r\n            documents, and argument of counsel at a hearing . . .\r\n            and finds that despite Defendants’ denials of\r\n            wrongdoing, there is sufficient evidence to indicate\r\n\n            that the Defendants were engaged in the activities\r\n            alleged by the Plaintiff.\r\n\r\nAfter Appellants' objection to the admission of the preliminary injunction\r\norder, the trial court stated, \"I think subject to your earlier objection, is that\r\nfair enough, that I've already ruled upon?\" The Appellants concurred with\r\nthe trial court, and the trial court continued, stating, \"Very well. We might go\r\ninto a little more detail later but it is over your objection.\"\r\n\r\n      It is hard for this court to determine an instance where admission of a\r\npreliminary injunction order into the trial record would not be highly\r\nprejudicial. While Appellants did not state specific grounds for their\r\nobjection, we find the introduction of the order for temporary injunction was\r\ninherently prejudicial, and thus, the grounds for the objection were patent.\r\nSee Dunn, 311 S.C. at 43-47, 426 S.E.2d at 757-58. We believe admitting\r\nthis order had a high possibility of influencing the jury due to its numerous\r\nfindings of fact and statements concluding defendants' liability for the\r\ncharges. The trial court abused its discretion in admitting the order into\r\nevidence. Thus, we reverse and remand in accordance with this decision.\r\n\r\n         b. McHenry's Expert Report\r\n\r\n      Appellants argue McHenry's written report and its attachments were\r\ncumulative of his subsequent testimony and contained impermissible and\r\nhighly prejudicial hearsay, making its admission into evidence reversible\r\nerror. We agree to the extent that the written report included the preliminary\r\ninjunction order, but find the remainder of the testimony did not prejudice\r\nAppellants.\r\n\r\n      \"Rule 703, SCRE, allows an expert giving an opinion to rely on facts or\r\ndata that are not admitted in evidence or even admissible into evidence.\"\r\nWright v. Hiester Const. Co., 389 S.C. 504, 523, 698 S.E.2d 822, 832 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010) (citing Jones v. Doe, 372 S.C. 53, 62, 640 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006). However, Rule 703 does not allow the admission of hearsay\r\nevidence simply because an expert used it in forming his opinion; the rule\r\nonly provides the expert can give an opinion based on facts or data that were\r\nnot admitted into evidence. Jones, 372 S.C. at 62-63, 640 S.E.2d at 519.\r\n\n      As stated previously, for an objection to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview, the objection must be made at the time the evidence is presented.\r\nState v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 42, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996). Further, it must\r\nbe made with sufficient specificity \"to inform the trial court of the point\r\nbeing urged by the objector.\" Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497\r\nS.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).\r\n\r\n      At trial, Appellants objected to McHenry's report after Allegro moved\r\nto put it into evidence. The Appellants stated, \"Same objection,\" purportedly\r\nin reference to a previous objection on the record that was based on matters\r\ndiscussed in camera. While the in camera discussion was either not placed\r\non the record or not given to us in the record on appeal, the trial court's 2008\r\norder states,\r\n\r\n            I overruled this general objection which was\r\n            insufficient as a matter of law to present any\r\n            objection, upon the ground that experts are permitted\r\n            to base their opinion on hearsay if it is the type\r\n            generally relied upon by experts. The Defendants\r\n            never objected that the hearsay, to the extent there\r\n            was any, was not this permissible type of hearsay.\r\n\r\nIn light of the trial court's 2008 order, it is apparent the objection was a\r\ngeneral hearsay objection. In their 2006 post-trial motion, the Appellants\r\nobjected again to the admission of McHenry's report \"because this report was\r\ncumulative of his testimony, contained impermissible hearsay, and contained\r\nmatters that were irrelevant and which served only to unfairly prejudice\r\nDefendants, confuse the issues, and mislead the jury.\" They further stated the\r\nreport contained a document that gave \"a purported timeline replete with\r\nmultiple layers of impermissible hearsay, self-serving statements, conclusions\r\nof fact and law, Plaintiff's own opinions, and references to impermissible\r\ndamages such as Plaintiff's litigation costs and attorneys' fees in this action.\"\r\n\r\n      We believe the specific issue of impermissible hearsay in the expert's\r\nreport is preserved for appellate review, as the issue was raised with\r\nsufficient specificity, and ruled upon by the trial court. See S.C. Dep't of\r\n\nTransp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d\r\n903, 907 (2007) (holding that to be preserved for appellate review, an issue\r\nmust have been (1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) raised by\r\nthe appellant, (3) raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the trial court\r\nwith sufficient specificity). There is nothing in the record on appeal that\r\nindicates the trial objection included arguments that the report was\r\ncumulative and contained matters that were irrelevant; thus, we find those\r\nissues are not preserved for our review. See McCall v. IKON, 380 S.C. 649,\r\n663, 670 S.E.2d 695, 703 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding that the appellant has the\r\nburden of providing a record sufficient for appellate review).\r\n\r\n       Here, McHenry was allowed to rely on hearsay in his report when\r\ngiving his expert opinion. However, the admission of the report itself simply\r\nbecause McHenry used it in forming his expert opinion was in error. The\r\nreport contained many instances of hearsay, including numerous statements\r\nby Scully. However, \"the admission in evidence of inadmissible hearsay\r\naffords no basis for reversal where the out-of-court declarant later testifies at\r\ntrial and is available for cross-examination.\" Clark v. Ross, 284 S.C. 543,\r\n551, 328 S.E.2d 91, 97 (Ct. App. 1985), abrogated by Sherer v. James, 290\r\nS.C. 404, 351 S.E.2d 148 (1986). Further, we do not find any of the\r\nremaining impermissible hearsay to be reversible error.\r\n\r\n       We address the fact that a copy of the temporary injunction order was\r\nattached to the report, which we find highly prejudicial to the Appellants.\r\nWe found admission of the temporary injunction order was improper, and it\r\nwas error to admit it with the expert's report as well. We find that portion of\r\nthe expert's report to be highly prejudicial; thus, we reverse the decision of\r\nthe trial court to the extent it allowed the temporary injunction order into the\r\nrecord.  c. Exclusion of Damages Evidence and McHenry's Qualification\r\n\r\n       Because we reverse and remand based upon the above evidentiary\r\nissues, we need not reach Appellants' remaining evidentiary arguments\r\nregarding the trial court's exclusion of damages evidence and McHenry's\r\nqualification as an expert. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\nInc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court\r\n\nneed not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is\r\ndispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n    II.      Remaining Arguments\r\n\r\n       Appellants contend the trial court should have granted their motions for\r\ndirected verdict and JNOV on their civil conspiracy claim, their contract\r\nclaims, and their misrepresentation claims. Further, they contend the trial\r\ncourt erred in reforming the jury's verdict when the trial court should have\r\neither required an election of remedies based upon the jury's verdict or\r\ngranted a new trial nisi additur. 9 Again, because we reverse the trial court on\r\nthe issues noted above, we need not review this argument. See Futch v.\r\nMcAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\nits determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n          Based on the foregoing reasons, the trial court's decision is\r\n\r\n          REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n          HUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n9 We reiterate that we do not approve the practice of asking a question or\r\nresponding only to the foreperson regarding a substantive issue about the law\r\nor the verdict. When a question arises regarding the law or the verdict form,\r\nthe better practice is to confer with counsel outside the presence of the jury to\r\ndiscuss the proper response, and then instruct the entire jury in court or in\r\nwriting and return them to the jury room to act in accordance with the court's\r\ninstructions. See Keeter v. Alpine Towers Int'l, Inc., Op. No. 4995 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed June 27, 2012) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 22 at 73, 90-91) (Thomas,\r\nJ., concurring) (providing the best practice to ensure a valid verdict is for the\r\ncourt to address any questions that arise in front of the entire jury). If a jury\r\nverdict form is ambiguous or unclear, the jury should be returned to the jury\r\nroom in order to clarify or conform the verdict to its intent before the jury is\r\nexcused.

With the exception of the claim for breach of\r\ncontract, the trial court granted Horton summary judgment on all of Wescott's\r\ncounterclaims, and granted Horton summary judgment on all of Hawkins'\r\ncounterclaims, including that of breach of contract.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n              FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      This appeal arises out of a contract for the conveyance of real property.\r\nIn the early 1980's, Hawkins purchased approximately 400 acres of realty in\r\nDorchester County. Hawkins sold around twenty-six acres of the property to\r\nanother individual, and thereafter entered into a series of contracts with\r\nHorton for the sale of most, if not all, of the remaining acres. Horton\r\npurchased all but the last forty-plus acres in \"individual chunks\" from\r\n\nHawkins. Thereafter, Hawkins, along with Tim Fraylick and Cliff Rickard,\r\nformed Wescott to develop and sell this remaining acreage to Horton.\r\n\r\n      In November 2004, Horton and Wescott entered into a contract\r\nwhereby Horton agreed to buy, and Wescott agreed to sell, the property,\r\nconsisting of 83 single family lots and 110 townhouse lots. The purchase and\r\nsale of the property was to be accomplished pursuant to a \"Takedown\r\nSchedule,\" wherein set numbers of lots would be purchased over a period of\r\nsixteen quarters, with the single family lots being purchased quarter one\r\nthrough eight, and the townhouse lots to be purchased from quarter seven\r\nthrough sixteen.1 Under the agreement, Wescott was required to meet certain\r\nconditions precedent pertaining to development of the lots and to provide\r\ndocumentation and certification of these conditions precedent prior to closing\r\non the lots. The contract further provided that Horton was not obligated to\r\npurchase any lots which had not achieved \"Substantial Completion,\" and\r\nstated \"'Substantial Completion' shall be achieved upon the date [Horton]\r\nreceives [Wescott's] notice [regarding the meeting of the conditions\r\nprecedent] accompanied by evidence satisfactory to [Horton], in [Horton's]\r\nreasonable discretion that said requirements have been met.\" Additionally,\r\nthe contract stated that if \"Substantial Completion\" had not been achieved by\r\nsix months past the estimated date in the \"Takedown Schedule\" with regard\r\nto any lot to be purchased, Horton had the right, in its sole discretion, to\r\neither terminate the contract or extend the date for achievement of\r\n\"Substantial Completion.\" Horton could also, in its sole discretion, elect to\r\npurchase lots prior to the achievement of \"Substantial Completion,\" but\r\nWescott would still be obligated to achieve \"Substantial Completion\" and\r\nHorton's election to purchase prior to \"Substantial Completion\" did not\r\nconstitute a waiver of that obligation.\r\n\r\n     Subsequently, in July 2005, Wescott and Horton executed an\r\namendment to the November 2004 contract, further specifying the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the parties to the development of the property and the time\r\n\r\n\r\n1The contract also recognized that lots could be purchased in excess of the\r\nrequired number per the schedule, but those lots purchased in excess would\r\nbe credited in successive time frames.\r\n\nperiod for the purchase and sale of the property. Pursuant to the amendment,\r\na new takedown schedule provided for the sale of the lots as follows:\r\n\r\n      a. Phase 3A (45 lots) on or before the later of July 1, 2005 or upon\r\n         final plat approval and recordation. 45 lots @ $32,000/lot =\r\n         $1,440,000.00\r\n      b. Phase 3D (38 lots) on or before the later of October 1, 2005 or upon\r\n         final plat approval and recordation. 38 lots @ $32,000/lot =\r\n         $1,216,000.00\r\n      c. Phase 3E-1 (37 lots) on or before the later of January 1, 2006 or\r\n         upon final plat approval and recordation. 37 lots @ $25,500/lot =\r\n         $943,500.00\r\n      d. Phase 3E-2 (37 lots) on or before the later of April 1, 2006 or upon\r\n         final plat approval and recordation. 23 lots @ $25,500/lot =\r\n         $586,500.00 and 14 lots @ $24,500/lot = $343,000.00\r\n      e. Phase 3E-3 (36 lots) on or before the later of July 1, 2006 or upon\r\n         final plat approval and recordation. 36 lots @ $24,500/lot =\r\n         $882,000.00\r\n\r\nThe amendment further added a stipulation that Wescott agreed to provide\r\nthe conditions precedent documents and certifications set forth in the parties'\r\ncontract twenty days prior to the closing date, in order to give Horton\r\nsufficient time to verify the documentation, inspect the property, and conduct\r\nfinal examinations to prepare for closing.\r\n\r\n       Horton closed on the lots in Phase 3A and Phase 3D, which apparently\r\nencompassed the 83 single family lots, and those matters are not in issue.\r\nHowever, a dispute arose in regard to the 110 townhouse lots in Phase 3E-1,\r\n3E-2 and 3E-3. On July 19, 2006, Wescott sent Horton a letter in regard to\r\nPhase 3E indicating the conditions precedent required by the contract had\r\nbeen completed so that the twenty day period under the contract had begun\r\nrunning, and requesting to schedule a closing for the entire phase as soon as\r\npossible. On August 2, 2006, Wescott's attorney, Steven Smith, sent Horton\r\na letter stating the conditions precedent had been satisfied and proof was\r\nprovided to Horton on July 19, 2006, and therefore requested that closing on\r\nthe properties take place no later than August 9, 2006. The letter further\r\nwarned that failure to close by that date would constitute a default under the\r\n\ncontract and amendment. On August 10, 2006, Smith again wrote Horton on\r\nbehalf of Wescott stating that the conditions precedent documents and\r\ncertification were delivered to Horton on July 19, 2006, a notice of\r\ncompletion was hand delivered to Horton on August 2, 2006 stating all lots\r\nmust be closed no later than August 9, 2006, and notifying Horton it was in\r\ndefault for failure to close pursuant to the terms of the contract and\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n      Horton responded to this letter on August 11, 2006 maintaining the\r\nconditions precedent to closing were not satisfied as to the townhouse lots\r\nuntil August 9, 2006, that the last of the documentation and certification for\r\nthose lots was not received until August 10, 2006, and therefore, given the\r\ntwenty days Horton was allowed under the contract, Horton could not be in\r\ndefault \"until August 31, 2006 at the earliest.\" Horton further asserted the\r\ncontract, as amended, contemplated the purchase and sale of the townhouse\r\nlots in three, separate, quarterly takedowns. Horton therefore indicated it\r\nwould close on thirty-seven townhouse lots on August 31, 2006, would\r\npurchase a like number of them on November 30, 2006, and would close on\r\nthe remaining lots on February 28, 2007. Horton proposed the parties\r\nexecute a second amended contract, which would establish the new takedown\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\n      On August 18, 2006, Horton sent Smith a draft of the proposed\r\n\"Second Amendment,\" setting forth a new schedule with Phase 3E-1 to close\r\non or before September 5, 2006, 3E-2 to close on or before December 5.\r\n2006, and 3E-3 to close on or before March 6, 2007. On September 13,\r\n2006, Mitchell Flannery, from Horton, sent Tim Fraylick, with Wescott, an e-\r\nmail attaching the proposed \"Second Amendment,\" and indicating it had \"36\r\nunits funded for takedown 1\" and agreeing to \"take 40 units down the 2nd\r\nphase and 36 the last.\" Horton also discussed the possibility of shrinking the\r\ntakedown to \"2 months apart rather than 3 months apart with the first closing\r\nimmediately.\" On September 18, 2006, Flannery sent Fraylick another e-\r\nmail, stating the parties needed to close on the funded units in the next few\r\nweeks, or he would have to \"send the money back to corporate.\" Flannery\r\nindicated \"[t]o give a little,\" he proposed they \"shrink the takedown over 2\r\nmonths rather than 3,\" and stated, \"If you all don't agree to this the property\r\ncould be tied up for a lot longer than this so I hope you will consider my\r\n\nproposal.\" Another proposed \"Second Amendment\" was attached to the e-\r\nmail, this one setting forth closing dates for the three phases of October 5,\r\n2006, December 5, 2006, and February 6, 2007.\r\n\r\n       On October 16, 2006, Horton's attorney, Michael Shetterly, wrote\r\nWescott's attorney, Smith, referencing their conversation of October 11,\r\n2006, and stating Wescott had not complied with the conditions precedent\r\nrequirements set forth in the parties' contract as amended. In particular,\r\nShetterly indicated that subparts (i) and (j) of paragraph 15 had not been met\r\ninasmuch as there was no evidence under subpart (i) of erosion control in\r\nplace, and Horton had not seen any \"sign-off\" from a governmental entity\r\nshowing erosion control had been erected, and no street lights had been\r\ninstalled pursuant to subpart (j). Shetterly stated Horton offered to forgive\r\nthe remaining conditions precedent and assume the conditions precedent as\r\nHorton's obligations in exchange for a reasonable takedown schedule in three\r\nphases, beginning in October and concluding in February.\r\n\r\n      On November 6, 2006, Wescott received an offer from a third party,\r\nKB Homes, to purchase the property in question, proposing KB Homes buy\r\nthe lots for $30,000 a piece with closings to occur on a quarterly basis. On\r\nNovember 29, 2006, KB Homes made another offer, proposing a price of\r\n$30,000 for the first 37 lots, $32,500 for the second takedown of 37 lots, and\r\n$33,500 for the third takedown of 36 lots, with the lots to be purchased over a\r\nsix month period.2 Wescott declined the offers from KB Homes because of\r\nconcern over the contract with Horton and the fear that it would confuse the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n     On December 4, 2006, Horton filed a lis pendens on the property in\r\nPhase 3E, naming Wescott as the defendant; however, this lis pendens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Both proposed purchase prices from KB Homes exceeded the amounts\r\nHorton was to pay for the lots under the amendment to the contract.\r\n\nexpired prior to Horton filing any action to perfect the lis pendens. On\r\nDecember 21, 2006, Wescott conveyed the property in question to Hawkins.3\r\n\r\n      Negotiations continued between the parties. On December 27, 2006,\r\nFlannery sent Fraylick an e-mail referencing a meeting between the parties on\r\nthe 21st, and providing a list of matters Horton required Wescott to rectify\r\nonsite within a few weeks of closing, in exchange for which Horton agreed to\r\npay $30,000 per unit and close as soon as possible. Included within the list of\r\nrequirements was \"the pads to be shaped back into their original condition\r\nand make sure that the pads are 95% compacted at 2,000 psf,\" and that\r\nWescott provide Horton with \"compaction letters.\" On January 12, 2007,\r\nHorton's attorney sent Wescott's attorney another proposed \"Second\r\nAmendment\" for Wescott's consideration. This amendment contained many\r\nprovisions the earlier proposed amendments had not, including the\r\nrequirement mentioned in the December 27 e-mail that Wescott, within two\r\nweeks after closing, make each of the 110 lots graded flat and constructed at\r\nninety-five percent compaction with compaction of 2000 psf. Under this\r\namendment, Horton agreed to waive any right to have a phased takedown,\r\nand agreed to purchase the property in its entirety on or before February 2,\r\n2006. On January 16, 2007, Wescott's attorney sent Horton's attorney an\r\namended version of Horton's latest proposal. Wescott's amendment made\r\nsome changes to the purchase price and escrow amounts, and completely\r\ndeleted Horton's proposal concerning grading and compaction. On January\r\n26, 2007, Horton's attorney sent Wescott's attorney yet another proposed\r\namendment, adding back the provision regarding grading and compaction.\r\nWescott's attorney responded to this e-mail on January 30, 2007,\r\nproclaiming, \"This is not at all what we agreed to,\" and asking to be\r\ncontacted. Horton's attorney replied, indicating he would call to discuss\r\nWescott's complaints with the proposed amendment. On January 31, 2007,\r\nHorton's attorney sent Wescott's attorney an e-mail stating Horton was\r\nadamant that the compaction matter remain in the proposed amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 There is no indication Hawkins or Wescott ever informed Horton of this\r\ntransfer, and Horton continued negotiations with Wescott until it filed this\r\naction against Wescott in February 2007.\r\n\n       Wescott's attorney testified he thought the reason Wescott did not agree\r\nto Horton's latest amendment was because of the compaction issue, as\r\nWescott believed \"compaction [had] already been done.\" Wescott's attorney\r\nappeared for closing on February 2, 2007, but no representatives from Horton\r\nappeared. Wescott's attorney then contacted Horton's attorney, who informed\r\nWescott they were not closing because they had not worked out all the\r\ndetails, and the compaction matter was still an issue. Wescott's attorney\r\nacknowledged that Horton's attorney made it clear in this conversation that,\r\nall along, Horton required new compaction testing to show the pads met the\r\nconditions precedent to the contract, and that this requirement was not being\r\nraised for the first time, but they had discussed it for thirty days.4\r\n\r\n      Following this latest breakdown in negotiations, on February 13, 2007,\r\nHorton filed another lis pendens on the property, again naming Wescott as\r\nthe defendant. This time, Horton followed up with the filing of a breach of\r\ncontract action against Wescott on February 26, 2007. Around March 5,\r\n2007, KB Homes made another offer to purchase the 110 townhouse lots for\r\nan amount even greater than its two previous offers in November 2006.\r\nHawkins testified that the filed lis pendens prevented him from accepting KB\r\nHomes' offer. Hawkins further stated that a similar situation occurred with an\r\noffer from Jessco Homes. This offer likewise included a higher purchase\r\nprice for the lots.\r\n\r\n      In April 2009, Horton filed an amended complaint for breach of\r\ncontract against Wescott, asserting the parties had established a course of\r\nperformance whereby the property would be developed and conveyed in\r\nphases, but in contravention of the course of performance, Wescott developed\r\n\r\n4 In support of its contention that compaction requirements had not been met,\r\nHorton submitted an affidavit for the engineer on this project, who stated his\r\ncompany \"did not do compaction tests on these lots,\" but based on his\r\nexperience and knowledge deterioration of the soils involved could occur due\r\nto weather and length of time between the testing reported on May 1, 2006\r\nand the July 19, 2006 date. He further opined that the \"upper 1 foot of soils\r\ndepicted in the evaluations and certifications would not be valid as of July 19,\r\n2006,\" and the \"upper 1 foot of soils would deteriorate and not be valid on\r\nJuly 1, 2006 nor any date thereafter\" without additional work effort.\r\n\nall the remaining property and demanded simultaneous closing on the\r\nproperty. Horton further alleged that Wescott failed to convey the property\r\nwithin the time required by the contract. Additionally, Horton maintained\r\nthat Wescott failed to fulfill certain conditions precedent in a timely manner.\r\nHorton therefore asserted Wescott breached the contract by demanding\r\nperformance by Horton prior to the time Wescott met all conditions precedent\r\nand after the time allowed in the contract. On April 30, 2009, Wescott filed\r\nits answer, and counterclaimed for breach of contract, unfair trade practices,\r\nabuse of process, malicious prosecution, breach of contract accompanied by a\r\nfraudulent act, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,\r\nand slander of title. The counterclaim further added Hawkins as a\r\ncounterclaimant, \"as an owner\" of the property, asserting that Hawkins\r\nconveyed the property to Wescott in June 2005, but the land was to revert\r\nback to Hawkins, per the terms of the transfer, should the sale to Horton not\r\noccur. In May 2009, Horton filed a motion for summary judgment on\r\nAppellants' counterclaims for slander of title, breach of contract, unfair trade\r\npractices, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, breach of contract\r\naccompanied by a fraudulent act, and tortious interference with prospective\r\neconomic advantage. Following a hearing on the matter, the trial court\r\ngranted summary judgment to Horton on Appellants' counterclaims for\r\nslander of title, unfair trade practices, abuse of process, malicious\r\nprosecution, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and tortious\r\ninterference with prospective contractual relations. Additionally, the trial\r\ncourt granted summary judgment to Horton on Hawkins' breach of contract\r\ncounterclaim. This appeal follows. ISSUES\r\n\r\n1.   Whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to\r\nAppellants' slander of title claim.\r\n\r\n2.    Whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to\r\nAppellants' unfair trade practices claim.\r\n\n3.   Whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to\r\nAppellants' abuse of process claim.\r\n\r\n4.   Whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to\r\nAppellants' malicious prosecution claim.\r\n\r\n5.   Whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to\r\nAppellants' breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act claim.\r\n\r\n6.   Whether the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to\r\nAppellants' tortious interference with prospective contractual relations claim.\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases\r\nwhich do not require the services of a fact finder.\" Dawkins v. Fields, 354\r\nS.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003) (quoting George v. Fabri, 345 S.C.\r\n440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001)). Summary judgment is appropriate\r\nwhen \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\r\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\nmatter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Appellate courts apply the same\r\nstandard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP when\r\nreviewing a grant of summary judgment. Turner v. Milliman, 392 S.C.\r\n116,121-22, 708 S.E.2d 766, 769 (2011). In determining whether any triable\r\nissues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must\r\nbe viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 122,\r\n708 S.E.2d at 769. When the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence, a non-moving party need only present a scintilla of evidence to\r\nwithstand a motion for summary judgment. Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt.\r\nCo., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009). \"A court considering\r\nsummary judgment neither makes factual determinations nor considers the\r\nmerits of competing testimony; however, summary judgment is completely\r\nappropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth facts that remain\r\nundisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.\" David v. McLeod Reg'l\r\nMed. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2006). \"Summary judgment\r\nshould not be granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if\r\n\nthere is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.\"\r\nBrockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 378, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692\r\n(2000).\"Under Rule 56(c), the party seeking summary judgment has the initial\r\nresponsibility of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material\r\nfact.\" Baughman v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537,\r\n545 (1991). This initial responsibility may be discharged by pointing out to\r\nthe trial court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving\r\nparty's case, and it is not necessary for the moving party to support its motion\r\nwith affidavits or other similar materials negating the opponent's claim. Id.\r\nOnce the moving party carries its initial burden, the opposing party must do\r\nmore than rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but\r\nmust, by affidavit or otherwise, set forth specific facts to show that there is a\r\ngenuine issue for trial. Id.; Rule 56(e), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.    Slander of Title\r\n\r\n       The trial court found Horton was entitled to summary judgment on\r\nappellants' slander of title claim noting that, instead of putting forth any facts\r\nto establish slander of title, appellants relied on the fact that Horton filed two\r\nlis pendens. The trial court determined the filing of these lis pendens, which\r\nrelated to the property dispute giving rise to this action, were absolutely\r\nprivileged under South Carolina law, and therefore could not be a basis for\r\nestablishing a claim for slander of title, citing Pond Place Partners, Inc. v.\r\nPoole, 351 S.C. 1, 567 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 2002) (cert. denied).\r\n\r\n      Appellants first contend the trial court erred as a matter of law in\r\nfinding the filing of the lis pendens was absolutely privileged such that a\r\nclaim for slander of title fails as a matter of law. They argue the trial court\r\ngave \"far too broad a reading\" of the Pond Place decision, and that Pond\r\nPlace only stands for the proposition that, assuming a lis pendens is properly\r\nfiled in accordance with the statutory requirements by one who has a\r\ncolorable claim to the property to which it attaches, and the filing party\r\ncompletes the statutory process by the timely filing of an associated\r\n\ncomplaint, then the filing of the lis pendens is privileged. Appellants assert\r\nPond Place did not extend a blanket privilege that would encompass an\r\nimproper lis pendens, and argue that strict compliance with the statutory\r\nprovisions is required. Thus, Appellants maintain Horton's filing of the lis\r\npendens, the first of which was not timely followed with a complaint, did not\r\ncomply with the statutory scheme.\r\n\r\n       In Pond Place, this court addressed the issue of whether the filing of a\r\nlis pendens was entitled to absolute privilege. There, Poole, along with\r\nothers who owned property in a development, filed a declaratory judgment\r\naction against Pond Place and others, challenging an amendment to restrictive\r\ncovenants on the subject property. Id. at 7, 567 S.E.2d at 884. Poole also\r\nfiled a lis pendens on the property in question. Id. By way of counterclaim,\r\nPond Place filed a cause of action for slander of title against Poole. Id. The\r\ntrial court granted Pond Place's motion for summary judgment on Poole's\r\ndeclaratory judgment action, finding modification to the restrictive covenants\r\nwas valid. Id. Thereafter, Pond Place prosecuted its slander of title action.\r\nId. At the close of Pond Place's case, Poole moved for a directed verdict on\r\nthe slander of title claim arguing the lis pendens was authorized by law, was\r\nproperly filed, and was absolutely privileged. Id. at 14, 567 S.E.2d at 887.\r\nThe trial court denied the motion, finding a lis pendens is not absolutely\r\nprivileged, but is only qualifiedly privileged. Id. The jury returned a verdict\r\nagainst Poole, and Poole appealed, asserting he was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict on the slander of title claim. Id. at 14, 567 S.E.2d at 888. This court\r\nreversed, finding the trial court should have granted Poole's motion for\r\ndirected verdict on the slander of title claim because the filing of a lis\r\npendens is absolutely privileged in South Carolina. Id. at 32, 567 S.E.2d at\r\n897.  This court issued a lengthy opinion discussing the law regarding the\r\nfiling of a lis pendens, the nature of a slander of title action, and other\r\njurisdictions' treatment of the filing of a lis pendens and whether such an act\r\nenjoys a qualified or an absolute privilege. Id. at 16-29, 567 S.E.2d at 889-\r\n896. As to the filing of a lis pendens, this court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n      The purpose of a notice of pendency of an action is to inform a\r\n      purchaser or encumbrancer that a particular piece of real property\r\n\n      is subject to litigation. A properly filed lis pendens binds\r\n      subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers to all proceedings\r\n      evolving from the litigation. Generally, the filing of a lis pendens\r\n      places a cloud on title which prevents the owner from freely\r\n      disposing of the property before the litigation is resolved.\r\n\r\nId. at 16-17, 567 S.E.2d at 889 (quotations and citations omitted). We\r\nfurther noted section 15-11-10 of our code allows for the filing of a lis\r\npendens not more than twenty days before filing the complaint in an action\r\naffecting the title to real property. Id. at 17, 567 S.E.2d 889; S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 15-11-10 (2005). We therefore determined that an action \"'affecting the\r\ntitle to real property' clearly allow[ed] the filing of a lis pendens by an\r\ninterested party in order to protect [the person's] ownership interest in the\r\nproperty subject to the litigation.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In regard to slander of title, we observed that our courts have adopted\r\nthe following six point test a plaintiff must establish to prove such an action:\r\n\"(1) the publication (2) with malice (3) of a false statement (4) that is\r\nderogatory to plaintiff's title and (5) causes special damages (6) as a result of\r\ndiminished value of the property in the eyes of third parties.\" Id. at 21-22,\r\n567 S.E.2d at 892. We also noted that \"[w]rongfully recording an unfounded\r\nclaim against the property of another generally is actionable as slander of\r\ntitle.\" Id. at 22, 567 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. 142,\r\n149, 459 S.E.2d 886, 891 (Ct. App. 1995)).\r\n\r\n       Finally, as to whether the filing of a lis pendens is privileged, this court\r\nnoted that \"[p]rivileged communications are either absolute or qualified,\" and\r\nthat \"South Carolina has long recognized that relevant pleadings, even if\r\ndefamatory, are absolutely privileged.\" Id. at 22 and 23, 567 S.E.2d at 892\r\nand 893. We further stated that the majority of cases from other jurisdictions\r\nthat have dealt with the question have held that the filing of a lis pendens\r\nenjoys the absolute privilege that is accorded to judicial proceedings. Id. at\r\n25, 567 S.E.2d at 893. The rationale set forth by these other jurisdictions is\r\nas follows:\r\n\n           (1) With few exceptions, any publication made in a judicial\r\n      proceeding enjoys absolute privilege from later charges of\r\n      defamation.\r\n\r\n            (2) The sole purpose of recording a notice of lis pendens is\r\n      to give to prospective buyers constructive notice of the pendency\r\n      of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n            (3) The notice of lis pendens is purely incidental to the\r\n      action wherein it is filed, and refers specifically to such action\r\n      and has no existence apart from that action.\r\n\r\n            (4) The recording of a notice of lis pendens is in effect a\r\n      republication of the proceedings in the action and therefore, it is\r\n      accorded the same absolute privilege as any other publication\r\n      incident to the action.\r\n\r\nId. at 25, 567 S.E.2d at 894. In particular, we note this court cited two cases\r\nfrom other jurisdictions that applied the absolute privilege and held (1) since\r\nthe filing of a lis pendens is incident to the filing of the complaint, if the\r\nplaintiff had probable cause to bring the action, then neither of the actions\r\ncould be considered slander of title and (2) because the recording of a lis\r\npendens is specifically authorized by statute and has no existence separate\r\nand apart from the litigation of which it gives notice, the filing of a notice of\r\nlis pendens is a part of a judicial proceeding and thus cannot form the basis\r\nfor an action for libel or slander. Id. at 25-26, 567 S.E.2d at 894 (citing\r\nBrough v. Foley, 572 A.2d 63 (R.I. 1990) and Kropp v. Prather, 526 S.W.2d\r\n283, 287 (Tex. Civ. App.1975)). In addressing the reasons behind finding the\r\nfiling of a lis pendens to be privileged, the court in Pond Place emphasized\r\nanother jurisdiction's conclusion that the notice of a lis pendens is, in effect, a\r\nrepublication of some of the essential information contained in the complaint\r\nfiled in the action. Id. at 27-28, 567 S.E.2d at 895 (citing Wendy's of South\r\nJersey, Inc. v. Blanchard Mgmt. Corp. of New Jersey, 170 N.J. Super. 491,\r\n406 A.2d 1337, 1339 (Ch. Div. 1979)). Additionally, this court noted the\r\nSupreme Court of California held an absolute privilege attaches to a lis\r\npendens \"[i]f the publication has a reasonable relation to the action and is\r\n\npermitted by law.\" Id. at 29, 567 S.E.2d at 896 (citing Albertson v. Raboff,\r\n46 Cal.2d 375, 295 P.2d 405, 409 (Ca. 1956)).\r\n\r\n      Based upon its thorough analysis, this court held a lis pendens filed in\r\nconjunction with an action involving the same real estate is merely another\r\nform of pleading. Id. at 30, 567 S.E.2d at 896. We also determined,\r\nhowever, that \"[a lis pendens] is premised upon and must be filed in time in\r\nconjunction with an underlying complaint involving an issue of property.\"\r\nId. (emphasis added). Ultimately, we concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n      We find the filing of a lis pendens is ABSOLUTELY privileged\r\n      in South Carolina. The filing of a lis pendens enjoys the absolute\r\n      privilege accorded to judicial proceedings.           Because the\r\n      recording of a lis pendens is specifically authorized by statute and\r\n      has no existence separate and apart from the litigation of which it\r\n      gives notice, the filing of a lis pendens CANNOT form the basis\r\n      of an action for slander of title.\r\n\r\nId. at 32, 567 S.E.2d at 897 (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\n       Appellants essentially argue that, because Horton did not follow\r\nthrough with the filing of a complaint within twenty days of the filing of the\r\nfirst lis pendens, the first lis pendens was not properly filed in accordance\r\nwith the statutory requirements and, therefore, was not entitled to absolute\r\nprivilege pursuant to Pond Place, as it was an improper lis pendens.5 We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n5 Section 15-11-10, governing the time of filing notice of lis pendens,\r\nprovides in part as follows:\r\n\r\n      In an action affecting the title to real property the plaintiff (a) not\r\n      more than twenty days before filing the complaint or at any time\r\n      afterwards . . . , may file with the clerk of each county in which\r\n      the property is situated a notice of the pendency of the action,\r\n      containing the names of the parties, the object of the action and\r\n      the description of the property in that county affected thereby\r\n\n       Although this court noted in Pond Place that a lis pendens is premised\r\nupon and \"must be filed in time in conjunction with an underlying complaint\"\r\ninvolving that property, we do not believe that Horton's failure to file a\r\ncomplaint within twenty days of the initial lis pendens necessarily invalidates\r\nthe absolute privilege accorded the filing of a lis pendens as provided in Pond\r\nPlace. Here, it is undisputed that Horton subsequently filed an identical lis\r\npendens and followed that filing with the filing of a complaint involving the\r\nsame real estate within a twenty day period pursuant to section 15-11-10. As\r\nnoted, part of the rationale behind allowing absolute privilege to attach to the\r\nfiling of lis pendens is that the notice of lis pendens is purely incidental to a\r\nfiled action, and the recording of a notice of lis pendens is, in effect, \"a\r\nrepublication of the proceedings in the action,\" and is therefore afforded the\r\nsame privilege as any other publication incident to the action. It is simply a\r\nrepublication of some of the essential information contained in the complaint\r\nultimately filed in the action. Although the initial lis pendens was allowed to\r\nexpire before the twenty day period ran for filing a complaint on the matter,\r\nthis simply rendered the initial lis pendens invalid. See South Carolina Nat'l\r\nBank v. Cook, 291 S.C. 530, 532-33, 354 S.E.2d 562, 563 (1987) (finding a\r\ncomplaint filed more than twenty days after the filing of the lis pendens\r\nrenders the lis pendens invalid). Because Horton thereafter filed a second lis\r\npendens in compliance with the statute, we discern no reason why the\r\nidentical lis pendens initially filed should not be afforded the same absolute\r\nprivilege. As argued by Horton, and supported by the record before us,\r\nHorton allowed the first lis pendens to expire when the parties continued to\r\nnegotiate, which thereby potentially obviated the need for the lis pendens.\r\nAfter negotiations between the parties finally broke down, Horton\r\nimmediately filed a second lis pendens in conjunction with an action\r\ninvolving the same real property. It is also indisputable that the first lis\r\npendens involved the same real property as that of the second lis pendens,\r\nand as that involved in the subsequent breach of contract action. To give the\r\ncourt's admonishment in Pond Place concerning strict compliance with the\r\nstatutory provisions surrounding the filing of a lis pendens such a stringent\r\ninterpretation as advanced by Appellants would require this court to ignore\r\none of the primary tenets behind affording the absolute privilege, i.e. that the\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-11-10 (2005). \n\r\n\nrecording of the notice of lis pendens is in effect a republication of the\r\nproceedings in the action, providing the essential information contained in the\r\ncomplaint. Although the initial lis pendens was not perfected within twenty\r\ndays, it still provided the essential information contained in the complaint and\r\namounted to a republication of the complaint. Accordingly, we hold that in a\r\nsituation such as this, where a party allows a filed lis pendens to expire before\r\nthe filing of an action, but subsequently files another lis pendens on the same\r\nproperty and thereafter timely files a complaint involving the same property,\r\nthe filing of the lis pendens is afforded absolute privilege and may not be the\r\nbasis for a slander of title action.6\r\n\r\n    II.   Unfair Trade Practices\r\n\r\n      Appellants next contend the trial court erred in granting Horton\r\nsummary judgment as to their unfair trade practices claim. While they\r\nacknowledge a claim of breach of contract, standing alone, cannot state a\r\nclaim under the unfair trade practices act, they contend the unfair trade\r\npractice here is not limited to a breach of the contract the parties entered, but\r\nthat Horton \"has engaged in a pattern and procedure of engaging in the same\r\nacts complained of herein.\" Specifically, they argue Horton is a national\r\nbuilder of residential developments that routinely enters into similar contracts\r\nthroughout the country, and Horton \"has used myriad reasons for delaying the\r\nclosing without adequate presales, including changing the reasons for not\r\nclosing.\" Appellants argue Horton uses various pretexts to string out the\r\ntransactions until it is able to presell enough units to abide by the contract.\r\nThey maintain this behavior is capable of repetition and that, carried out\r\nacross the country, would amount to a clear violation of the unfair trade\r\npractices act. Appellants summarily argue the evidence is sufficient to form\r\nthe basis for an unfair trade practices claim, and the court erred in holding\r\nthey rested their claim solely on failure to fulfill contractual obligations. We\r\nfind no error.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 We intimate no opinion on whether the filing of a lis pendens that is\r\nallowed to expire and is not thereafter subsequently followed with the filing\r\nof a valid lis pendens and complaint on the same real property would also be\r\nentitled to absolute privilege.\r\n\n       First, we find Appellants have abandoned this issue. In Appellants'\r\nbrief, they fail to cite any law or authority in support of their argument, and\r\nmake only conclusory arguments. While Appellants do cite to one federal\r\ndistrict court case in their reply brief in regard to their unfair trade practices\r\nclaim, their argument in this regard is also largely conclusory. See First Sav.\r\nBank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting an\r\nissue is deemed abandoned where appellant fails to provide arguments or\r\nsupporting authority for his assertion); Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container\r\nCorp., 355 S.C. 154, 164, 584 S.E.2d 390, 396 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"[S]hort,\r\nconclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed\r\nabandoned on appeal and therefore not preserved for our review.\").\r\n\r\n       At any rate, we would affirm this issue on the basis that, assuming as\r\nAppellants contend that Horton used myriad reasons for delaying the closing,\r\nchanged the reasons for not closing, and used various pretexts to string out\r\nthe transactions, these actions, even if subsequently found to be in breach of\r\nthe parties' contract, amount to nothing more than an intentional breach of\r\ncontract. This finding is supported by Fraylick's deposition. When asked if\r\nthere was anything, other than not purchasing the 110 town home lots, that\r\nWescott was complaining Horton did not do, Fraylick responded, \"No.\"\r\nFurther, when specifically questioned regarding the allegation of unfair trade\r\npractices and what Horton did that was \"unfair,\" Fraylick stated that Horton\r\nfailed to close on the phases in a timely fashion and Horton \"never performed\r\non anything they said they were going to do.\" When asked what Horton did,\r\nother than not closing on time, Fraylick replied, \"I guess it all relates back to\r\nnot closing on time.\" Fraylick could not think of any other ways they were\r\ntreated unfairly by Horton. When questioned about how Horton acted\r\ndeceptively, Fraylick stated Horton \"said they were going to close and they\r\ndidn't close,\" and again agreed he could think of nothing else, but that it \"all\r\nrelated to timeliness of closing or not closing.\" A mere breach of contract,\r\nwithout more, does not constitute a violation of the unfair trade practices act,\r\neven if done intentionally. Key Co. v. Fameco Distribs., Inc., 292 S.C. 524,\r\n526, 357 S.E.2d 476, 478 (Ct. App. 1987). Otherwise, every intentional\r\nbreach of a contract within a commercial setting would constitute an unfair\r\ntrade practice and thereby subject the breaching party to treble damages. Id.\r\nat 527, 357 S.E.2d at 478. This evidence supports the trial court's\r\ndetermination that Appellants' claim rested solely on the assertion that Horton\r\n\nfailed to fulfill its contractual obligations, and that a mere breach of contract\r\nis insufficient to constitute a violation of the UTPA.\r\n\r\n   III. Abuse of Process\r\n\r\n       Appellants contend the trial court erred in finding Horton was entitled\r\nto summary judgment as to their abuse of process claim based upon its\r\nfinding Appellants failed to set forth a genuine issue of material fact as to\r\nulterior motive. Citing Broadmoor Apartments of Charleston v. Horwitz, 306\r\nS.C. 482, 413 S.E.2d 9 (1991), they argue our courts have found the filing of\r\na lis pendens to prevent the sale of property to a third party can constitute\r\nulterior motive. Appellants argue that despite their valid rescission of the\r\ncontract, Horton filed a lis pendens against the property, and though\r\nAppellants \"had every right to walk away from the parties' contract,\" Horton\r\nmisused a lis pendens to tie up the property and attempt to browbeat Wescott\r\ninto accepting Horton's new terms. In support of this argument, Appellants\r\npoint to Flannery's September 18, 2006 e-mail to Fraylick, wherein Flannery\r\nstates, \"If you all don't agree to this the property could be tied up for a lot\r\nlonger than this so I hope you will consider my proposal.\" They argue,\r\npursuant to Broadmoor, a lis pendens may constitute an abuse of process\r\nwhen done without justification and for the purpose of preventing third\r\nparties from purchasing the subject property. Appellants contend Horton's\r\nlack of specific knowledge of KB Homes' offer does not excuse Horton's\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n      We find the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this\r\nclaim because Appellants failed to present evidence meeting the essential\r\nelements of an abuse of process claim. The two essential elements of an\r\nabuse of process claim are (1) an ulterior purpose, and (2) a willful act in the\r\nuse of the process not proper in the conduct of the proceeding. Argoe v.\r\nThree Rivers Behavioral Ctr. & Psychiatric Solutions, 388 S.C. 394, 403, 697\r\nS.E.2d 551, 556 (2010). \"The abuse of process tort provides a remedy for\r\none damaged by another's perversion of a legal procedure for a purpose not\r\nintended by the procedure.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      \"An ulterior purpose exists if the process is used to gain an objective\r\nnot legitimate in the use of the process.\" First Union Mortg. Corp. v.\r\n\nThomas, 317 S.C. 63, 74, 451 S.E.2d 907, 914 (Ct. App. 1994). \"[T]here is\r\nno liability when the process has been carried to its authorized conclusion,\"\r\neven if done with bad intentions. Id. at 74-75, 451 S.E.2d at 914. \"The\r\nimproper purpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral\r\nadvantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself.\" Hainer v. Am.\r\nMed. Int'l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 492 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997). \"Some\r\ndefinite act or threat not authorized by the process or aimed at an object not\r\nlegitimate in the use of the process is required.\" Id. The essence of the tort\r\nof abuse of process centers on events occurring outside the process, and our\r\ncourts have noted that \"[t]he improper purpose usually takes the form of\r\ncoercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the\r\nproceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money,\r\nby the use of the process as a threat or club.\" Swicegood v. Lott, 379 S.C.\r\n346, 353, 665 S.E.2d 211, 214 (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Huggins v. Winn-\r\nDixie Greenville, Inc., 249 S.C. 206, 209, 153 S.E.2d 693, 694 (1967)).\r\n\"There is, in other words, a form of extortion, and it is what is done in the\r\ncourse of negotiation, rather than the issuance or any formal use of the\r\nprocess itself, which constitutes the tort.\" Id. (quoting Huggins, 249 S.C. at\r\n209, 153 S.E.2d at 694).\r\n\r\n       Our courts have noted that an abuse of process action may lie if a party\r\nprosecutes an entire lawsuit for collateral purposes. Food Lion, Inc. v.\r\nUnited Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 73, 567 S.E.2d\r\n251, 255 (Ct. App. 2002). Nonetheless, \"[a]n allegation of an ulterior\r\npurpose or 'bad motive,' standing alone, is insufficient to assert a claim for\r\nabuse of process.\" Id. at 74, 567 S.E.2d at 255. An ulterior purpose, to\r\nsatisfy that element for abuse of process, exists if the process is used to gain\r\nan objective not legitimate in the use of the process. Id. at 71, 567 S.E.2d at\r\n253. However, even assuming there is some evidence a party has an ulterior\r\nmotive for bringing an action, that party is entitled to summary judgment in\r\nits favor on an abuse of process claim if there is no evidence the party\r\nengaged in a \"willful act,\" an element essential to the abuse of process cause\r\nof action which is characterized as a \"definite act . . . not authorized by the\r\nprocess or aimed at an object not legitimate in the use of the process.\"\r\nSouthern Glass & Plastics Co. v. Duke, 367 S.C. 421, 430-31, 626 S.E.2d 19,\r\n24 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Hanier, 328 S.C. at 136, 492 S.E.2d at 107).\r\n\n      In Food Lion, our court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n             The distinction between the two requirements is evident in\r\n      the language of the Restatement of Torts: \"One who uses a legal\r\n      process, whether criminal or civil, against another primarily to\r\n      accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed, is subject to\r\n      liability to the other for harm caused by the abuse of process.\"\r\n      Restatement (Second) of Torts § 682 (1977) (emphasis added).\r\n      As noted in the Restatement comment, \"[t]he significance of\r\n      ['primarily'] is that there is no action for abuse of process when\r\n      the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended, but\r\n      there is an incidental motive of spite or an ulterior purpose of\r\n      benefit to the defendant.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 682\r\n      cmt. b. at 475 (1977). Accordingly, liability exists not because a\r\n      party merely seeks to gain a collateral advantage by using some\r\n      legal process, but because the collateral objective was its sole or\r\n      paramount reason for acting. See id. . . . It therefore follows that\r\n      when a claim for abuse of process is predicated on an alleged act\r\n      \"aimed at an object not legitimate in the use of the process,\" the\r\n      ulterior purpose allegation must be accompanied by an allegation\r\n      that the process was misused by the undertaking of the alleged\r\n      act, not for the purpose for which it was intended but for the\r\n      primary purpose of achieving a collateral aim.\r\n\r\nId. at 75, 567 S.E.2d at 255-56 (some citations omitted) (emphasis in\r\noriginal).\r\n\r\n      Here, Appellants have asserted Horton filed the lis pendens to prevent\r\nthe sale of property to a third party and misused the lis pendens to tie up the\r\nproperty and attempt to browbeat Wescott into accepting Horton's new terms\r\nto the contract. Even assuming for the sake of argument that Appellants'\r\nallegation might qualify as an \"ulterior motive,\" we find such an allegation is\r\ninsufficient to overcome Horton's summary judgment motion, as Appellants\r\nhave presented no evidence of any willful acts \"not authorized in the use of\r\nthe process.\" Clearly, Horton had the right to negotiate with Appellants when\r\nthe parties came to a disagreement regarding their obligations under the\r\ncontract. The fact that the September e-mail states that the property could be\r\n\ntied up for a longer period of time if the parties do not come to some\r\nresolution does not evince an act that is not authorized by the process.\r\nHorton merely recognized that Appellants desired to close on all of the\r\nproperty right away, and the parties' inability to agree on terms would\r\nprolong any closing. Accordingly, Appellants failed to submit even a\r\nscintilla of evidence that Horton engaged in a willful act in the use of the\r\nprocess not proper in the conduct of the proceeding, and the trial court\r\nproperly granted Horton's motion for summary judgment on Appellants'\r\nabuse of process claim. See also CEL Products, LLC v. Rozelle, 357 S.C.\r\n125, 129-30, 591 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding former employer\r\nwas entitled to summary judgment as to former employee's claim of abuse of\r\nprocess where former employee's response to the summary judgment motion\r\nmerely relied on former employee's pleadings, and former employee did not\r\nprepare a summary judgment affidavit creating a genuine issue of material\r\nfact).7\r\n\r\n7 We find the Broadmoor case, cited by Appellants, is distinguishable from\r\nthe case at hand. In Broadmoor, our supreme court found sufficient evidence\r\nfrom which the jury could infer that defendant corporation and its president\r\nwillfully abused the process by filing a lis pendens for the ulterior purpose of\r\npreventing a sale to third parties in hopes of obtaining financial backing to\r\npurchase the property at an advantageous price. Broadmoor, 306 S.C. at 487,\r\n413 S.E.2d at 12. Notably, the court did not specifically delve into what\r\nconstitutes the elements of \"an ulterior purpose, and \"a willful act in the use\r\nof the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.\" Rather,\r\nthe court determined the trial court properly denied appellants' motion for\r\ndirected verdict on Broadmoor's abuse of process claim where the facts\r\nshowed as follows: appellant Schlopy, who initially contracted to purchase\r\nthe property, \"assigned\" the contract to appellant Berkeley Square Realty,\r\nnotwithstanding Broadmoor's rejection of the assignment, then advised\r\nappellant Horwitz, Berkley's President, that he thought filing a lis pendens\r\nwas a good idea; and, during the pendency of the lawsuit Schlopy, who had\r\nthe right to assign his interest without Broadmoor's consent only if a\r\ncorporation known as Marc Equity was a partner of the assignee, filed an\r\naffidavit on Berkeley's behalf, erroneously listing Marc Equity in the\r\nassignment, and stating \"the information was satisfactory and the parties\r\nwould proceed to fulfill the terms of the contract,\" but there was nothing in\r\n\n      Finally, we note the trial court properly determined, because Horton did\r\nnot employ any legal procedure or process against Hawkins, Hawkins cannot\r\nmaintain an action against Horton for abuse of process.\r\n\r\n   IV.   Malicious Prosecution\r\n\r\n        Appellants next contend the trial court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment on their malicious prosecution claim. They argue the trial court\r\ngranted Horton summary judgment on this claim because the claim was not\r\nripe, but the court's finding in this respect did not refer to the initial lis\r\npendens that expired under its own terms, which was the civil proceeding that\r\nunderpinned Appellants' malicious prosecution claim. They contend that\r\nPond Place specifically recognizes that a proper action against a maliciously\r\nfiled lis pendens includes a malicious prosecution action, and the fact that\r\nAppellants had yet to prevail against Horton in the present action had no\r\nbearing on the ripeness of its claim for malicious prosecution based on the\r\nfirst lis pendens.\r\n\r\n      We find this argument is abandoned on appeal. Appellants merely\r\nsummarily argue that the trial court erred in finding their claim was not ripe,\r\nbut fail to cite any law or authority in support of their argument that the fact\r\nthey have yet to prevail has no bearing on the matter. Their reference to\r\nPond Place addresses only whether a maliciously filed lis pendens will\r\nsupport a malicious prosecution cause of action, and does not address\r\nwhether a party is required to prevail in a matter before bringing such an\r\naction. See McLean, 314 S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514 (noting an issue is\r\n\r\nthe record to support the affidavit and, to the contrary, Broadmoor had\r\nexplicitly rejected Schlopy's request that the required deposit be reduced from\r\n$50,000 to $25,000. Id. Thus, there was an abundance of evidence Schlopy\r\nand the others knew they had not complied with the contractual terms, but\r\nfiled a lis pendens for an ulterior purpose, i.e. to tie up the property until it\r\ncould obtain financial backing at a favorable price. Further, the court did not\r\naddress the elements of an abuse of process claim in Broadmoor, and made\r\nno specific findings whatsoever applicable to the second necessary element,\r\ni.e. a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the conduct of the\r\nproceeding.\r\n\ndeemed abandoned where appellant fails to provide arguments or supporting\r\nauthority for his assertion); Eaddy, 355 S.C. at 164, 584 S.E.2d at 396 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2003) (\"[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting\r\nauthority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not preserved for\r\nour review.\").\r\n\r\n   V.    Breach of Contract Accompanied by Fraudulent Act\r\n\r\n       Appellants contend the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\r\nto Horton on their breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act claim.\r\nThey contend they put forth sufficient facts to support recovery for this cause\r\nof action, ranging from Horton's shifting reasons for refusing to close on\r\nPhase 3E, reversing positions as to whether conditions precedent had been\r\nsatisfied, its strained and self-serving construction of the parties' contract, and\r\nHorton's written threat to tie up the property if Horton did not get its way.\r\nThey further argue, whether Appellants provided sufficient evidence they\r\nrelied on misrepresentations by Horton is a genuine issue of fact to be\r\ndetermined by the trier of fact. Appellants also contend the filing of\r\nsuccessive lis pendens for the purpose of preventing third parties from\r\nacquiring the property and forcing them to bend to Horton's will is, in itself, a\r\nfraudulent act accompanying Horton's breach. They maintain the lis pendens\r\nwas designed for no other purpose than to cloud their title to the property and\r\nto interfere with their right to freely alienate the property, and that genuine\r\nissues of material fact exist as to whether Horton's intent was fraudulent. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n       To establish a claim for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\nact, a party must show: (1) a breach of contract; (2) fraudulent intent relating\r\nto the breaching of the contract and not merely to its making; and (3) a\r\nfraudulent act accompanying the breach. Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348\r\nS.C. 454, 465-66, 560 S.E.2d 606, 612 (2002). \"Fraudulent act\" is broadly\r\ndefined as \"any act characterized by dishonesty in fact or unfair dealing.\" Id.\r\nat 466, 560 S.E.2d at 612. \"'Fraud,' in this sense, 'assumes so many hues and\r\nforms, that courts are compelled to content themselves with comparatively\r\nfew general rules for its discovery and defeat, and allow the facts and\r\ncircumstances peculiar to each case to bear heavily upon the conscience and\r\njudgment of the court or jury in determining its presence or absence.'\" Id.\r\n\n(quoting Sullivan v. Calhoun, 117 S.C. 137, 139, 108 S.E. 189, 189 (1921)).\r\nBreach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act requires proof of\r\nfraudulent intent relating to the breaching of the contract and not merely to its\r\nmaking, and such proof may or may not involve false representations. Ball v.\r\nCanadian Am. Exp. Co., 314 S.C. 272, 276, 442 S.E.2d 620, 623 (Ct. App.\r\n1994). \"Fraudulent intent is normally proved by circumstances surrounding\r\nthe breach.\" Floyd v. Country Squire Mobile Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 51, 54,\r\n336 S.E.2d 502, 503-04 (Ct. App. 1985). \"The fraudulent act may be prior\r\nto, contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the breach of contract, but it must\r\nbe connected with the breach itself and cannot be too remote in either time or\r\ncharacter.\" Id. at 54, 336 S.E.2d at 504.\r\n\r\n       Here, Appellants have failed to present any evidence Horton committed\r\na fraudulent act accompanying its alleged breach of contract. Appellants\r\nmaintain Horton's shifting reasons for refusing to close on Phase 3E,\r\nreversing positions as to whether conditions precedent had been satisfied, its\r\nstrained and self-serving construction of the parties' contract, and Horton's\r\nwritten threat to tie up the property if Horton did not get its way support this\r\ncause of action. Even if we were to assume these qualify as evidence of\r\nHorton's fraudulent intent in breaching the contract, they are not evidence of\r\nan independent fraudulent act which accompanied the breach. See Minter v.\r\nGOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 530, 473 S.E.2d 67, 70-71 (Ct. App. 1996)\r\n(holding evidence corporation opened quick oil-change facility without\r\noffering real estate developer contractual right of first refusal despite being\r\nput on notice by developer that such conduct would be regarded as breach,\r\nwhile possibly evidence of corporation's fraudulent intent in breaching the\r\ncontract, was not evidence of an independent fraudulent act which\r\naccompanied the breach). Further, Appellants submitted no evidence that\r\nHorton had any fraudulent intent in filing the lis pendens, nor any evidence\r\nthe act of filing the lis pendens was dishonest or amounted to unfair dealing.\r\nEven when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants,\r\nmore is required than mere speculation to withstand Horton's motion for\r\nsummary judgment on this claim. RoTec Servs., Inc. v. Encompass Servs.,\r\nInc., 359 S.C. 467, 471, 597 S.E.2d 881, 883 (Ct. App. 2004). Accordingly,\r\nwe find no error in the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Horton on\r\nthis counterclaim.\r\n\n      Additionally, we again note the trial court properly determined, because\r\nHawkins did not have a contract with Horton, Hawkins' claim for breach of\r\ncontract accompanied by a fraudulent act must fail.\r\n\r\n    VI.   Interference with Prospective Contractual Relations\r\n\r\n       Lastly, Appellants contend the trial court erred in granting Horton\r\nsummary judgment on their intentional interference with prospective\r\ncontractual relations claim.8 They contend the evidence presented established\r\nthat they declined to ratify the numerous offers from others to purchase the\r\nproperty out of concern the lis pendens filed by Horton would prevent the\r\ndeals from going forward, and if Horton acted in bad faith by filing the lis\r\npendens to tie up the property, as evidenced by Flannery's threat to do so, it\r\nwas with full knowledge such action would prevent Appellants from selling\r\nthe property to third parties. Thus, Appellants assert genuine issues of\r\nmaterial fact exist as to this claim.\r\n\r\n       While our courts previously refused to recognize a common law action\r\nfor intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, in Crandall\r\nCorp. v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 395 S.E.2d 179 (1990),\r\nour supreme court abandoned our prior law and recognized such a cause of\r\naction in South Carolina. Id. at 266, 395 S.E.2d at 180. To establish a cause\r\nof action for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations,\r\nthe plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant intentionally interfered with\r\nthe plaintiff's potential contractual relations, (2) for an improper purpose or\r\nby improper methods, and (3) that the interference caused injury to the\r\nplaintiff. Id. While it is not necessary that the interfering party intend harm,\r\nit is necessary that he intend to interfere with a prospective contract. Eldeco,\r\nInc. v. Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist., 372 S.C. 470, 481, 642 S.E.2d 726, 732\r\n(2007).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8Although the Appellants referred to this cause of action as tortious\r\ninterference with prospective economic advantage in their counterclaim, the\r\ntrial court and the parties acknowledge this action is recognized in South\r\nCarolina as intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.\r\n\n       We affirm this issue based on Appellants' inability to show Horton\r\nintentionally interfered with Appellants' prospective contractual relations. It\r\nis undisputed Appellants were unable to show Horton was ever aware of any\r\noffers, or even negotiations, between Appellants and third parties in regard to\r\nthe sale of the property. Thus, Appellants cannot show the most basic\r\nelement of the cause of action, i.e. that Horton intentionally interfered.\r\nBecause there is no evidence Horton was aware of any prospective third party\r\nrelations, there is no evidence Horton intentionally interfered with them.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we affirm the trial courts' granting of summary\r\njudgment to Horton on Appellants' counterclaims for slander of title, unfair\r\ntrade practices, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, breach of contract\r\naccompanied by a fraudulent act, and tortious interference with prospective\r\neconomic advantage.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      LOCKEMY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PIEPER, J., concurring:\r\n\r\n       I agree that we should affirm the order of the trial court granting\r\nsummary judgment, but I write separately as I do not believe the filing of the\r\nDecember 4, 2006 lis pendens is entitled to absolute privilege on Appellants'\r\nslander of title cause of action. Nonetheless, I would affirm because\r\nAppellants failed to set forth a genuine issue of material fact as to the\r\nelements essential to the slander of title cause of action.\r\n\r\n      The statute providing the procedure for filing a lis pendens states:\r\n\r\n            In an action affecting the title to real property the\r\n            plaintiff (a) not more than twenty days before filing\r\n            the complaint or at any time afterwards or (b)\r\n            whenever a warrant of attachment under §§ 15-19-10\r\n\n            to 15-19-560 shall be issued or at any time afterwards\r\n            or a defendant when he sets up an affirmative cause\r\n            of action in his answer and demands substantive\r\n            relief, at the time of filing his answer or at any time\r\n            afterwards if such answer be intended to affect real\r\n            estate, may file with the clerk of each county in\r\n            which the property is situated a notice of the\r\n            pendency of the action, containing the names of the\r\n            parties, the object of the action and the description of\r\n            the property in that county affected thereby. If the\r\n            action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage such\r\n            notice must be filed twenty days before judgment and\r\n            must contain the date of the mortgage, the parties\r\n            thereto and the time and place of recording such\r\n            mortgage.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §15-11-10 (2005). A lis pendens \"is premised upon and\r\nmust be filed in time in conjunction with an underlying complaint involving\r\nan issue of property.\" Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 30, 567\r\nS.E.2d 881, 896 (Ct. App. 2002). A complaint filed more than twenty days\r\nafter the filing of the lis pendens renders the lis pendens invalid. South\r\nCarolina Nat'l Bank v. Cook, 291 S.C. 530, 532-33, 354 S.E.2d 562, 563\r\n(1987). \"Since the filing of a lis pendens is an extraordinary privilege\r\ngranted by statute, strict compliance with the statutory provisions is\r\nrequired.\" Pond Place, 351 S.C. at 17, 567 S.E.2d at 889. \"[T]he filing of a\r\nlis pendens is absolutely privileged in South Carolina.\" Id. at 32, 567 S.E.2d\r\nat 897.\r\n\r\n      Here, it is undisputed that Horton filed a lis pendens on December 4,\r\n2006, and did not file a complaint within twenty days. Therefore, Horton did\r\nnot meet the statutory requirements for filing a lis pendens. Because strict\r\ncompliance with the statutory requirements for filing a lis pendens is\r\nrequired, the December 4, 2006 lis pendens is invalid, and thus, is not entitled\r\nto absolute privilege.\r\n\r\n     However, instead of putting forth facts to establish a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact on Appellants' slander of title cause of action, Appellants relied\r\n\nsolely on the fact that Horton filed two lis pendens. \"[T]o maintain a claim\r\nfor slander of title, the plaintiff must establish (1) the publication (2) with\r\nmalice (3) of a false statement (4) that is derogatory to plaintiff's title and (5)\r\ncauses special damages (6) as a result of diminished value of the property in\r\nthe eyes of third parties.\" Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. 142, 149, 459 S.E.2d\r\n886, 891 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Res. Corp.,\r\n187 W.Va. 457, 419 S.E.2d 870 (1992), aff'd, 509 U.S. 443 (1993)). \"Actual\r\nmalice can mean the defendant acted recklessly or wantonly, or with\r\nconscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights.\" Constant v. Spartanburg Steel\r\nProds., Inc., 316 S.C. 86, 89, 447 S.E.2d 194, 196 (1994). \"Special damages\r\nrecoverable in a slander of title action are the pecuniary losses that result\r\n'directly and immediately from the effect of the conduct of third persons,\r\nincluding impairment of vendibility or value caused by disparagement, and\r\nthe expense of measures reasonably necessary to counteract the publication,\r\nincluding litigation.'\" Huff, 319 S.C. at 150-51, 459 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting\r\n50 Am. Jur. 2d Libel & Slander § 560).\r\n\r\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants, the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and affidavits submitted to\r\nthe court failed to set forth facts creating a genuine issue of material fact as to\r\nall elements of the slander of title cause of action. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP\r\n(stating summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\").\r\nSpecifically, Appellants failed to set forth a genuine issue of material fact on\r\nthe elements of malice and special damages.

Murphy, of North Augusta, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.: In this declaratory judgment action, Ola Mae Steedley appeals\r\nthe special referee's order, which concluded that her predecessor in title, Claude\r\nSmith, granted an appurtenant easement across her property to the prior owner of\r\nan adjoining parcel. We affirm.\r\n\n                       FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n\r\n\r\nAppellant Ola Mae Steedley is the owner of a parcel of land located on Sweetwater\r\nRoad in Edgefield County, South Carolina.1 To the west of Steedley's parcel is an\r\nadjoining parcel owned by Respondent Sheran Proctor (Parcel 1). To the\r\nsouthwest of this adjoining parcel is a smaller parcel also owned by Proctor (Parcel\r\n2). Proctor's two parcels, which are located on an unpaved road, Country Manor\r\nLane, and Steedley's parcel originated from a common grantor, Claude Smith.2\r\nHereinafter, Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 will be referenced together as one tract (Proctor's\r\nproperty).\r\n\r\nThe dispute in this case arises over the nature of an easement granted in 1973 by\r\nSmith to Proctor's parents and predecessors in title, Karl and Mary Louise Burger.\r\nThe easement allowed the Burgers to access the northern part of their property\r\nfrom Sweetwater Road by use of an unpaved road crossing Smith's adjoining\r\nparcel to the east, which is now owned by Steedley. Smith and the owner of\r\nneighboring property to the north, Emerson Odom, had created this access road for\r\ntheir own use a few years before Smith granted the easement allowing the Burgers\r\nto use the road as well. In 1981, after Smith died, his widow conveyed the parcel\r\nabutting Sweetwater Road to David Steedley.\r\n\r\nProctor's property lies directly north of Country Manor Lane, which forks off from\r\nRandall Road; thus, Proctor can access the southern part of her property from\r\nCountry Manor Lane. However, a creek bisects Proctor's property;3 hence, she\r\ncannot access the part of her property to the north of the creek from Country\r\nManor Lane. While it is possible to access the northern part of Proctor's property\r\nfrom the unpaved access road that crosses Steedley's property, Steedley erected a\r\nlocked gate preventing Proctor from using the access road. Therefore, Proctor\r\n\r\n1 Sweetwater Road was previously named Five Notch Road. Throughout the\r\nrecord, witnesses and the special referee refer to the road by both names.\r\n2 Smith conveyed the parcels on Country Manor Lane to Proctor's parents, Karl\r\nand Mary Louise Burger, in 1973. In 1979, after Smith's death, his widow and sole\r\ndevisee executed a \"correction deed\" that corrected the description of the south and\r\nsouthwest boundaries of Parcel 1 and Parcel 2. In 1981, Smith's widow conveyed\r\nthe parcel on Sweetwater Road to David Steedley. Ola Mae Steedley is David\r\nSteedley's widow. After the 1980 death of Proctor's father, Proctor's mother\r\nconveyed Parcel 1 to Proctor in 1994. In 2001, Proctor's mother conveyed Parcel 2\r\nto Proctor.\r\n3 According to testimony, the creek runs from a pond on Steedley's property.\r\n\nbrought this action seeking a judgment declaring that the right to use this access\r\nroad, granted by Smith to her parents in 1973, was transferrable to her, i.e., an\r\nappurtenant easement.\r\n\r\nThe following language appears in the 1973 deed from Smith to the Burgers:\r\n\r\n             It is understood and agreed by and between the Grantor\r\n             and the Grantees that an access road shall be maintained\r\n             between the property of Temples and the Smith property\r\n             which leads from the Five Notch Road to the lands herein\r\n             conveyed and an access road from the Five Notch Road\r\n             on the South and Southwestern part of the said property\r\n             hereinabove conveyed.4\r\n\r\nThe first access road described in the deed relates to the easement at issue.5\r\nAlthough the deed states that this access road \"leads from\" Five Notch (now\r\nSweetwater) Road, it is actually separated from Sweetwater Road by an area\r\ndescribed by Steedley's son as approximately forty to fifty feet long and \"ditch-\r\nlike.\" Thus, anyone desiring to drive a vehicle on this access road must cross a\r\nparcel to the north of the access road to get to and from Sweetwater Road.\r\n\r\nThe access road runs along the property line between the Steedley (formerly\r\nSmith) parcel and the Odom parcel, then it reaches a fork; to the left (south), it runs\r\nto a pond on the Smith property, and to the right, it runs onto the northern part of\r\nProctor's property and terminates at a cul-de-sac. Depending on the precise\r\nlocation, the width of the access road is between eight and twenty feet; it is wide\r\nenough for a truck or a tractor to traverse.\r\n\r\nProctor and her family have used their property for activities such as picnicking\r\nand gathering firewood. They cut a path from the southernmost part of the\r\nproperty to the creek. Proctor's mother and step-father put a trailer on the southern\r\npart of the property abutting Country Manor Lane. Additionally, Proctor's mother\r\nhad timber cut from the property on at least one occasion. The timber company\r\ndid not use the access road to the northern part of the property. Instead, the loggers\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The Temples' property was later purchased by Emerson Odom, a portion of \n\r\nwhich he deeded to his daughter, who subsequently deeded this portion to her \n\r\ndaughter.\n\r\n5 The second access road referenced in the deed is Country Manor Lane.\n\r\n\npushed the timber across the creek by building a temporary bridge and took all the\r\ntimber to the southern part of the property and out via Country Manor Lane.\r\n\r\nAfter Steedley's husband passed away, her family became concerned about\r\ntrespassers using the access road to get to the pond on her property. Consequently,\r\nthe family installed an unlocked chain across the road. They later replaced the\r\nchain with a gate, which initially remained unlocked. Once the gate was locked,\r\nSteedley's family offered keys to neighbors who might use the access road.\r\nHowever, the family did not offer a key to Proctor.\r\n\r\nSeveral months after the chain and then the gate were installed, Proctor contacted\r\nSteedley, requesting use of the access road and indicating that she was going to\r\nsend her a copy of the deeds creating the easement.6 Proctor called Steedley a\r\nsecond time to determine if she had received the copies of the deeds. Steedley\r\nindicated she had received them and \"had turned it over to her son.\" Steedley's son\r\nlater telephoned Proctor and told her not to call his mother again.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2008, Proctor filed an action seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment\r\nestablishing (a) the grant of an appurtenant easement; and (b) the easement's width;\r\n(2) injunctive relief prohibiting Steedley from denying Proctor the use of the\r\neasement; and (3) economic damages. The complaint cited the language in the\r\ndeed between their respective predecessors-in-interest. Steedley asserted that any\r\ngrant of a right to use the access road was an easement in gross that was personal\r\nto the original contracting parties.\r\n\r\nA special referee conducted a hearing on July 21, 2010. At that time, Proctor\r\nabandoned her claim for damages and pursued only her claims for equitable relief.\r\nImmediately prior to the hearing before the special referee, Steedley moved to\r\nexclude the testimony of Proctor's expert witness, Keith Taylor, an attorney who\r\nhad practiced in the area of real property law for over twenty-seven years. Taylor\r\nperforms his own title examinations and writes title insurance. Steedley objected\r\nto the admission of Taylor's testimony on the ground that it would be improper for\r\nan attorney to give an expert opinion as to what would be the \"ultimate question of\r\nlaw\" in the case, i.e., whether the easement in question was an easement in gross or\r\nan appurtenant easement. The special referee ruled that he would allow Taylor's\r\ntestimony. Steedley noted a continuing objection to Taylor's testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n6The original deed from Smith to the Burgers was executed in 1973. In 1979,\r\nSmith's widow executed a \"correction deed.\"\r\n\nTaylor testified that whether the easement was appurtenant or in gross depended on\r\nthe intent of the parties at the time the deed was executed. He gave his opinion as\r\nto the plain meaning of the phrase \"access road\" as used in the deed:\r\n\r\n             An access road just means . . . a road to access your\r\n             property. It would mean a right to transfer the access of\r\n             that road. I mean, I think a plain meaning of an access\r\n             road is a way to access the property. You don't buy\r\n             landlocked property thinking, well, I'll never be able to\r\n             transfer or sell this property because I don't have access\r\n             to it. So, an access road would mean, I think, an\r\n             easement in perpetuity and appurtenant to the property.\r\n\r\nTaylor also gave his opinion as to the nature of the easement in the present case:\r\n\"[T]he access road granted is an easement appurtenant to the property, because the\r\nplain meaning of an access road is a way of accessing your property, and would be\r\none that could be conveyed to subsequent purchasers.\"\r\n\r\nThe special referee issued a written order concluding that the easement created by\r\nthe language of the deed from Smith to the Burgers established an appurtenant\r\neasement for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The special referee also ruled\r\n\"henceforth the easement shall be twenty (20) feet in width throughout its current\r\npath across [Steedley's] property.\"\r\n\r\nThe order further required steps to be taken to continue the access road from its\r\ncurrent termination point on Steedley's property to Sweetwater Road so that users\r\nof the road will not have to cross the neighboring property to the north. Finally,\r\nthe order stated \"nothing contained in this Order shall be interpreted as allowing\r\n[Proctor] the right to materially increase the volume of traffic over the access road\r\nbeyond her personal use and that of members of her family and invitees.\" This\r\nappeal followed.              ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n1.    Did the special referee err in concluding that the easement across Steedley's\r\nproperty was an appurtenant easement?\r\n\r\n2.    Did the special referee improperly expand the scope of the easement?\r\n\n3.    May this court affirm the special referee's order on the ground that Proctor\r\nhas an easement by necessity?\r\n\r\n4.     Did the special referee err in admitting an attorney's testimony as to the issue\r\nof the grantor's intent as expressed in the deed?\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe distinction between an appurtenant easement and an easement in gross\r\ninvolves the extent of a grant of an easement, as opposed to the creation of an\r\neasement. See Windham v. Riddle, 370 S.C. 415, 418, 635 S.E.2d 558, 559 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006) (characterizing the determination of whether an easement was\r\nappurtenant or in gross as a determination of the extent of a grant of an easement),\r\naff'd, 381 S.C. 192, 672 S.E.2d 578 (2009).7 The determination of the extent of a\r\ngrant of an easement is an action in equity. Tupper v. Dorchester Cnty., 326 S.C.\r\n318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997). Therefore, on appeal of such a\r\ndetermination, this court may take its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence. Id. \"However, this broad scope of review does not require an appellate\r\ncourt to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the\r\nbetter position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.\" Pinckney v. Warren, 344\r\nS.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001) (citations omitted). \"Moreover, the\r\nappellant is not relieved of his burden of convincing the appellate court the trial\r\njudge committed error in his findings.\" Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d at 623.\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Appurtenant Easement\r\n\r\nSteedley first argues the special referee erred in concluding that the easement in\r\nquestion was appurtenant because Proctor failed to show either the grantor's intent\r\nto convey an appurtenant easement or the necessity of the easement. We will\r\naddress these arguments in turn.\r\n\r\n             An easement is a right which one person has to use the\r\n             land of another for a specific purpose, and gives no title\r\n             to the land on which the servitude is imposed. An\r\n7Further, the interpretation of a deed is an equitable matter. Heritage Fed. Sav. &\r\nLoan v. Eagle Lake & Golf Condos., 318 S.C. 535, 539, 458 S.E.2d 561, 564 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1995).\r\n\n            easement is therefore not an estate in lands in the usual\r\n            sense. An easement may be created by reservation in a\r\n            deed.\r\n\r\nWindham, 381 S.C. at 201, 672 S.E.2d at 582 (citations and quotation marks\r\nomitted).   The character of an express easement is determined by\r\n            the nature of the right and the intention of the parties\r\n            creating it. An easement in gross is a mere personal\r\n            privilege to use the land of another; the privilege is\r\n            incapable of transfer. In contrast, an appurtenant\r\n            easement inheres in the land, concerns the premises, has\r\n            one terminus on the land of the party claiming it, and is\r\n            essentially necessary to the enjoyment thereof. It also\r\n            passes with the dominant estate upon conveyance.\r\n            Unless an easement has all the elements necessary to be\r\n            an appurtenant easement, it will be characterized as a\r\n            mere easement in gross. Where language in a plat\r\n            reflecting an easement is capable of more than one\r\n            construction, that construction which least restricts the\r\n            property will be adopted.\r\n\r\nId. at 201-02, 672 S.E.2d at 583 (quoting Tupper, 326 S.C. at 325–26, 487 S.E.2d\r\nat 191) (emphases added) (citations omitted). Here, the only two elements in\r\ndispute are intent and necessity.\r\n\r\n      A. Grantor's Intent\r\n\r\nBecause the language creating the easement is found in the deed from Smith to the\r\nBurgers and in the subsequent corrective deed, both parties acknowledge the\r\napplication of case law governing the interpretation of deeds in support of their\r\nrespective positions. See K & A Acquisition Grp., LLC v. Island Pointe, LLC, 383\r\nS.C. 563, 581, 682 S.E.2d 252, 262 (2009) (holding that the grant of an easement is\r\nto be construed in accordance with the rules applied to deeds and other written\r\ninstruments).\r\n\r\n            In construing a deed, the intention of the grantor must be\r\n            ascertained and effectuated, unless that intention\r\n\n             contravenes some well settled rule of law or public\r\n             policy. In determining the grantor's intent, the deed must\r\n             be construed as a whole and effect given to every part if\r\n             it can be done consistently with the law. The intention of\r\n             the grantor must be found within the four corners of the\r\n             deed.\r\n\r\nWindham, 381 S.C. at 201, 672 S.E.2d at 582-83 (emphasis added) (citations and\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nThe determination of the grantor's intent when reviewing a clear and unambiguous\r\ndeed is a question of law for the court. Hunt v. Forestry Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564,\r\n568, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848 (Ct. App. 2004). This court reviews questions of law de\r\nnovo. Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 564, 658 S.E.2d 80,\r\n90 (2008). In other words, a reviewing court is free to decide questions of law\r\nwith no particular deference to the trial court.8 Hunt, 358 S.C. at 569, 595 S.E.2d\r\nat 848-49.\r\n\r\nHere, the language in Smith's deed describing the access road in issue is as follows:\r\n\r\n             It is understood and agreed by and between the Grantor\r\n             and the Grantees that the access road shall be maintained\r\n             between the property of the Temples and the Smith\r\n             property which leads from the Five Notch Road to the\r\n             lands herein conveyed and an access road from the Five\r\n8 Likewise, the determination of whether language in a deed is ambiguous is a\r\nquestion of law. Cf. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C.\r\n617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001) (applying rules of contract construction\r\nto a restrictive covenant in a deed and stating that whether a contract is ambiguous\r\nis a question of law for the court). The language in a deed is ambiguous if it is\r\nreasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. Id. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at\r\n302 (stating that a contract is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably susceptible\r\nto more than one interpretation). We conclude there is no ambiguity in the\r\nlanguage of Smith's deed creating the easement at issue in this case. Therefore, it\r\nwas unnecessary for the special referee to evaluate evidence outside the deed's four\r\ncorners on the issue of Smith's intent. Id. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 303 (stating that\r\nonce the court decides the language of the instrument is ambiguous, evidence may\r\nbe admitted to show the parties' intent, the determination of which is then a\r\nquestion of fact).\r\n\n             Notch Road on the South and Southwestern part of the\r\n             said property hereinabove conveyed.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the clear and unambiguous language of the deed as a whole, the\r\ngrant of an \"access road\" describes a way to access the property that all current and\r\nfuture owners of the property may enjoy. In support of her argument that Smith\r\nintended to grant an appurtenant easement, Proctor highlights the deed's words of\r\ninheritance, i.e., \"their heirs and assigns forever,\" which both precede and follow\r\nthe description of the property with the accompanying easement language. Proctor\r\nalso highlights the phrase, \"[t]ogether with all and singular, the rights, members,\r\nhereditaments and appurtenances to the said premises belonging or in anywise\r\nincident or appertaining[,]\" which follows the property description and easement\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the phrase \"heirs and assigns\" will not convert an easement in gross to\r\nan appurtenant easement when the elements of an appurtenant easement are not\r\notherwise present. Douglas v. Medi. Investors, Inc., 256 S.C. 440, 447-48, 182\r\nS.E.2d 720, 723 (1971); Sandy Island Corp. v. Ragsdale, 246 S.C. 414, 423, 143\r\nS.E.2d 803, 808 (1965); Ballington v. Paxton, 327 S.C. 372, 381, 488 S.E.2d 882,\r\n887 (Ct. App. 1997). However, such language is relevant to the determination of\r\nthe grantor's intent. Douglas, 256 S.C. at 448, 182 S.E.2d at 724; Sandy Island,\r\n246 S.C. at 423, 143 S.E.2d at 808; see also Smith v. Comm'rs of Pub. Works of\r\nCity of Charleston, 312 S.C. 460, 468, 441 S.E.2d 331, 336 (Ct. App. 1994)\r\n(stating that the phrase \"all and singular, the rights, members, hereditament and\r\nappurtenances to the said premises belonging, or in anywise incident or\r\nappertaining[,]\" which followed a deed's property description, showed an intent to\r\ngrant all rights essential to the enjoyment of the premises conveyed).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the phrases highlighted by Proctor, combined with the easement\r\nlanguage, show Smith's intent that the easement run with the land. Notably,\r\nnothing in the deed suggests the grantor intended the easement to be merely\r\npersonal to the Burgers. Based on the foregoing, the deed as a whole shows the\r\ngrantor's intent to convey an appurtenant easement.\r\n\r\n      B. Necessity\r\n\r\nSteedley asserts that the access road is not necessary to the enjoyment of Proctor's\r\nproperty. We disagree.\r\n\nThe record shows that Proctor's property is bisected by a creek emanating from the\r\npond on Steedley's property. On either side of the creek is a ravine preventing\r\nvehicular access to the north side of the property, absent use of the access road\r\nthrough Steedley's property. Tom Proctor described the creek and ravine as\r\nfollows:    [W]here it comes out of the pond, it's kind of flat and\r\n            swampy up in there for a good ways, and then it gets\r\n            pretty deep. It's deep pretty much all the way down until\r\n            it exits our property . . . The ditch is . . . six or seven feet\r\n            deep and probably seven or eight feet wide.\r\n\r\nThis evidence supports the special referee's conclusion that the access road was\r\nnecessary for the enjoyment of the dominant estate.\r\n\r\nSteedley contends Tom Proctor essentially admitted that the access road was not\r\nnecessary when he testified that a bridge could be built over the creek. We\r\ndisagree with the contention that this testimony is equivalent to an admission that\r\nthe access road is unnecessary. Tom Proctor did not testify that such an option was\r\nreasonable or affordable. Further, Steedley has not pointed to any evidence in the\r\nrecord showing that the option of building a bridge to support heavy-duty vehicles\r\nis reasonable or affordable. Therefore, she has failed to carry her burden of\r\nconvincing this court that the special referee erred in finding the access road\r\nnecessary to Proctor's enjoyment of her property. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C.\r\n381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011) (holding that the burden is upon the\r\nappellant to convince this court that the trial court erred in its findings).\r\n\r\nII.   Burden on the Servient Estate\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, the special referee required the access road to be maintained\r\nat \"twenty (20) feet in width throughout its current path across [Steedley's]\r\nproperty.\" The special referee further required steps to be taken to continue the\r\naccess road from its current termination point on Steedley's property to Sweetwater\r\nRoad, so that users of the access road will not have to cross the neighboring\r\nproperty to the north to avoid the ditch-like area separating the access road from\r\nSweetwater Road. Steedley maintains that these rulings unreasonably burden her\r\nproperty. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn determining the proper scope of an easement, this court's opinion in Smith v.\r\nCommissioners of Public Works of City of Charleston is instructive. 312 S.C. 460,\r\n\n441 S.E.2d 331 (Ct. App. 1994). In Smith, this court interpreted the language of an\r\neasement agreement negotiated between the plaintiffs' predecessor in interest,\r\nBenjamin Kittredge, and the defendants' predecessor in interest, Bushy Park\r\nAuthority.9 312 S.C. at 462, 441 S.E.2d at 333. The easement agreement stated:\r\n\r\n            \"Kittredge and all future owners of Dean Hall Plantation\r\n            and Cypress Gardens shall have the right, and the same is\r\n            hereby granted to them, of ingress, egress and regress to\r\n            the banks of and across the canal about to be constructed,\r\n            leading from the Cooper River to Back River, at any\r\n            point contiguous to the lands being conveyed by\r\n            Kittredge to the Authority.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 463, 441 S.E.2d at 333 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe court concluded it was unreasonable to interpret the agreement to mean\r\nKittredge and Bushy Park intended that each owner of any portion of the\r\nPlantation, \"no matter how small his portion, would have his own private unlimited\r\naccess to the canal as long as his land was contiguous to [the defendant's] land.\"\r\nId. at 468-69, 441 S.E.2d at 337. In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned as\r\nfollows:    The subject unlocated easement must be interpreted,\r\n            however, in light of good faith, reasonableness and what\r\n            was necessarily the intent of the parties to the 1955\r\n            agreement. Hill v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 204\r\n            S.C. 83, 28 S.E.2d 545 (194[3]) (an easement in general\r\n            terms is limited to a use which is reasonably necessary\r\n            and convenient and as little burdensome to the servient\r\n            estate as possible for the use contemplated). In\r\n            determining the extent of the easement (number of access\r\n            points or routes), consideration must be given to what is\r\n            essentially necessary to the enjoyment of the [plaintiffs']\r\n            property.\r\n\r\nSmith, 312 S.C. at 468, 441 S.E.2d at 336 (emphases added).\r\n\r\n9Kittredge had agreed to sell land to Bushy Park Authority so that the Authority\r\ncould construct a canal from the Cooper River to the Back River. 312 S.C. at 463,\r\n441 S.E.2d at 333.\r\n\nHere, the evidence shows that without extending the access road from Steedley's\r\ngate to the roadway of Sweetwater Road, a vehicle would have to either drive\r\nthrough a \"ditch-like area\" or travel over the adjacent property to the north of\r\nSteedley's property. The special referee believed that extending the length of the\r\naccess road was the most reasonable implementation of the easement Smith\r\nintended to grant to the Burgers and their successors in title. We agree with the\r\nspecial referee's assessment. Moreover, the special referee required Proctor to bear\r\nthe cost of making this short extension.\r\n\r\nAs to the width requirement, Steedley's own witness, Emerson Odom, testified that\r\nthe access road would not accommodate log trucks. Further, Steedley has failed to\r\nspecify precisely how the extra width in those places not already twenty-feet-wide\r\nwould burden her property other than requiring the removal of some \"established\"\r\ntrees. Moreover, Steedley has not pointed to any evidence in the record showing\r\nthat these trees are unique or have any special significance that would render their\r\nremoval unreasonable. Therefore, she has failed to carry her burden of convincing\r\nthis court that the challenged requirements impose an unreasonable burden on her\r\nproperty. See Pinckney, 344 S.C. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d at 623 (recognizing the\r\nappellant has the burden of convincing the appellate court that the trial judge\r\nerred).\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the challenged requirements fall within the\r\noriginal intent of Smith's grant of access to the Burgers and do not impose an\r\nunreasonable burden on Steedley's property.\r\n\r\nIII.   Easement by Necessity\r\n\r\nProctor argues that pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR,10 this court may affirm the\r\nspecial referee's order on the ground that Proctor has an easement by necessity.\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nThe elements of a claim for easement by necessity are: (1) unity of title, (2)\r\nseverance of title, and (3) necessity. Boyd v. Bellsouth Tel.Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410,\r\n418-19, 633 S.E.2d 136, 140-41 (2006). \"The necessity required for easement by\r\nnecessity must be actual, real, and reasonable as distinguished from convenient,\r\nbut need not be absolute and irresistible.\" Id. at 420, 633 S.E.2d at 141. \"The\r\n\r\n10Rule 220(c), SCACR, provides that this court may affirm an order upon any\r\nground appearing in the Record on Appeal.\r\n\nnecessity element of easement by necessity must exist at the time of the severance\r\nand the party claiming the right to an easement must not create the necessity when\r\nit would not otherwise exist.\" Id. (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\"To establish unity of title, the owner of the dominant estate must show that his\r\nland and that of the owner of the servient estate once belonged to the same person.\"\r\nKennedy v. Bedenbaugh, 352 S.C. 56, 60, 572 S.E.2d 452, 454 (2002). Severance\r\nof title means that title to a larger tract was severed \"by conveyance of a part to the\r\npredecessor in title of the plaintiff and of a part to the predecessor in title to the\r\ndefendant; they both claim, from a common source, different parts of the integral\r\ntract, which necessarily assumes a severance.\" Brasington v. Williams, 143 S.C.\r\n223, 246, 141 S.E. 375, 382 (1927). In the present case, no party disputes that the\r\nelements of unity of title and severance of title are present, and these elements\r\nclearly appear in the record.\r\n\r\nSteedley argues that because Proctor did not assert the claim of easement by\r\nnecessity before the special referee, she did not preserve the claim for appellate\r\nreview. However, \"it is not always necessary for a respondent—as the winning\r\nparty in the lower court—to present his issues and arguments to the lower court\r\nand obtain a ruling on them in order to preserve an issue for appellate review.\"\r\nI'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723\r\n(2000). \"[W]hen the lower court rules in one party's favor, it is not necessary for\r\nthat party to return to the court and ask for a ruling on remaining issues and\r\narguments in order to preserve those arguments for use in an appeal.\" Id. at 423,\r\n526 S.E.2d at 725.\r\n\r\nHere, although Proctor did not include the claim of \"easement by necessity\" in her\r\ncomplaint, she presented evidence on all of the elements of this claim as this\r\nevidence was relevant to her claim for an appurtenant easement.11 Therefore, the\r\ngrounds for establishing an easement by necessity appear in the record and allow\r\nthis court to affirm the special referee's order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11Proctor argues that a second ground for necessity existed at the time of Smith's\r\nconveyance to the Burgers, i.e., Smith had already conveyed his interest in the\r\nother access road, now known as Country Manor Lane, to a third party. However,\r\nthis ground for necessity was later extinguished when the parties' rights to use the\r\nroad were clarified. See Boyd, 369 S.C. at 420, 633 S.E.2d at 141 (holding that an\r\neasement by necessity will be extinguished once the necessity ends).\r\n\nIV.   Expert Testimony\r\n\r\nSteedley maintains that the special referee erred in admitting attorney Keith\r\nTaylor's expert testimony as to the issue of the grantor's intent.12 Assuming\r\narguendo that this testimony was improper, its admission into evidence was\r\nharmless because the deed itself supports the special referee's finding that Smith\r\nintended to grant an appurtenant easement. See Judy v. Judy, 384 S.C. 634, 646,\r\n682 S.E.2d 836, 842 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding that appellate courts will not set\r\naside judgments due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result).\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the special referee's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12Taylor also testified regarding the objective results of his title examination.

Walden (Mary) argues the circuit court erred\r\nin compelling arbitration of a dispute involving an alleged breach of contract\r\nresulting from Harrelson Nissan, Inc.'s (Harrelson) failure to obtain credit life\r\ninsurance in connection with the lease of an automobile from Harrelson. We\r\naffirm.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 2007, Mary and her late husband, James Walden (James), executed a\r\nmotor vehicle lease agreement (Lease) with Harrelson for a 2007 Nissan Murano.\r\nThe Lease contained an arbitration agreement, which states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n             [A]ny claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute\r\n             or otherwise (including the interpretation and scope of\r\n             this clause, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute),\r\n             between you and us or our employees, agents, successors,\r\n             or assigns, which arise out of or relate to your credit\r\n             application, this lease or any resulting transaction or\r\n             relationship (including any such relationship with third\r\n             parties who do not sign this Lease) shall, at your or our\r\n             election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and\r\n             not by a court action.\r\n\r\nThe Lease provided an option for Mary to purchase credit life insurance coverage\r\nwith Life Investors Insurance Company (Life Investors) upon both lessees\r\ninitialing the coverage on page two of the Lease. Both Mary and James initialed\r\nthe relevant coverage portion of the Lease. The entire premium for the optional\r\ncredit life insurance coverage amounted to $602.27 and was financed into the\r\nLease. Mary began making regular monthly payments in the amount of $594.94 to\r\nHarrelson, which included a pro rata amount for the credit life insurance.\r\n\r\nOn January 24, 2009, James passed away. When Mary sought the proceeds of her\r\ncredit life insurance policy, Life Investors denied her claim. Mary subsequently\r\nlearned Harrelson allegedly failed to pay the premiums for her credit life insurance\r\ncoverage to Life Investors. On February 25, 2009, Mary filed suit against\r\nHarrelson, asserting breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, breach of contract\r\naccompanied by a fraudulent act, and a violation of the South Carolina Unfair\r\nTrade Practices Act. After filing an answer, Harrelson filed a motion to compel\r\narbitration, attempting to force Mary to arbitrate her claims under the terms of the\r\narbitration agreement that was a part of the Lease. Following the hearing, the\r\n\ncircuit court granted the motion to compel arbitration. After an arbitration award\r\nin Mary's favor, this timely appeal followed.1\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe question of arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination unless\r\nthe parties provide otherwise. Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596,\r\n553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001). This determination is subject to de novo review.\r\nGissel v. Hart, 382 S.C. 235, 240, 676 S.E.2d 320, 323 (2009). Nevertheless, a\r\ncircuit court's factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence\r\nreasonably supports the findings. Aiken v. World Fin. Corp. of S.C., 373 S.C. 144,\r\n148, 644 S.E.2d 705, 707 (2007).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMary argues the circuit court erred in determining her claims were subject to\r\narbitration. We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, if the contract providing for arbitration involves interstate commerce,\r\nthe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) displaces the state arbitration statute.2 Soil\r\nRemediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., 323 S.C. 454, 459-60, 476 S.E.2d 149, 152\r\n(1996) (\"If the arbitration agreement in the instant controversy is covered by the\r\nFAA, then . . . the FAA preempts S.C. Code Ann. § 15-48-10(a) . . . . For the\r\nFederal Act to apply, the commerce involved in the contact must be interstate or\r\nforeign.\"). The FAA requires the enforcement of an arbitration agreement upon\r\nproof (1) that a written agreement to arbitrate exists, and (2) that the written\r\nagreement is contained within a contract involving \"commerce.\" 9 U.S.C.A. § 2\r\n(1947). However, Mary argues the FAA does not apply to insurance contracts in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\n1 At oral argument before this court, counsel for Mary acknowledged his client\r\ntraded in the Nissan Murano. Mary subsequently leased a second vehicle and\r\nselected credit life insurance coverage. When James passed away, the proceeds of\r\nthe credit life insurance policy from the second vehicle were paid to Mary.\r\n2 There is no dispute the transaction here included a written agreement to arbitrate\r\nand involved interstate commerce as Mary is a South Carolina resident, Harrelson\r\nis a North Carolina corporation, the vehicle was manufactured in Tennessee, and\r\nfinancing was provided by Nissan-Infiniti LT of California.\r\n\nSection 15-48-10(b)(4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) provides that a\r\nwritten agreement to arbitrate shall not apply to \"any claim arising out of personal\r\ninjury, based on contract or tort, or to any insured or beneficiary under any\r\ninsurance policy or annuity contract.\" Mary correctly states the FAA's mandate\r\nconflicts with section 15-48-10(b)(4). See Am. Health & Life Ins. Co. v. Heyward,\r\n272 F. Supp. 2d 578, 582 (D.S.C. 2003) (holding section 15-48-10(b)(4)'s\r\nprohibition on arbitration \"reverse preempts\" the FAA through application of the\r\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act and \"prohibits the enforcement of arbitration clauses in\r\ninsurance policies governed by South Carolina law\"); see also Cox v. Woodmen of\r\nThe World Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 460, 468, 556 S.E.2d 397, 402 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n(concluding section 15-48-10(b)(4) \"reverse preempts\" the FAA through the\r\napplication of the McCarran-Ferguson Act). The contract in dispute here is not an\r\ninsurance contract, and the provision in the lease did not create an insurance policy\r\nor a duty to insure. Therefore, Mary's causes of action against Harrelson are not\r\nthe claims of \"any insured or beneficiary under any insurance policy\" that would\r\nexempt this action from arbitration. Mary urges an expansive reading of section\r\n15-48-10(b)(4), contending the statute precludes arbitration of any claim related to\r\na contract for insurance. We find this assertion without merit.\r\n\r\n\"In interpreting a statute, this [c]ourt's primary function is to ascertain the intent of\r\nthe legislature.\" Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997). \"In\r\nconstruing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning\r\nwithout resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's\r\noperation.\" First Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229,\r\n417 S.E.2d 592, 593 (1992).\r\n\r\nIn Cox v. Woodmen of World Insurance Company, this court found section \"15-48-\r\n10(b)(4) was enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,\" but\r\nalso concluded the statute is a \"specific exemption limited to entities within the\r\ninsurance industry.\" Cox, 347 S.C. at 468, 556 S.E.2d at 402 (emphasis added).\r\nMoreover, although not binding upon this court, a federal district court applied\r\nsection 15-48-10(b)(4) and concluded \"the McCarran-Ferguson Act precludes the\r\napplication of the FAA to arbitration clauses contained in insurance policies\r\ngoverned by South Carolina law.\" Am. Health, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 582 (emphasis\r\nadded). Accordingly, we reject Mary's expansive interpretation of the statute and\r\nconclude the General Assembly did not intend for the arbitration exception of\r\nsection 15-48-10(b)(4) to apply to automobile lease agreements that only have a\r\n\ntangential relationship to an insurance policy, but was instead intended to apply\r\ndirectly to an insurance contract.\r\n\r\nThe FAA and section 15-48-10(b)(4) conflict with one another only when a litigant\r\nseeks to enforce an arbitration agreement contained in an insurance policy\r\ngoverned by South Carolina law. Here, the parties' arbitration agreement was part\r\nof an automobile lease by Harrelson, not an insurance contract. As part of the\r\nLease, Mary selected optional credit life insurance and chose to pay premiums up\r\nfront through its inclusion in the financing agreement between the parties. The\r\nterms of the Lease included the offer to secure credit life insurance from Life\r\nInvestors in exchange for the payment of the premium. Mary paid the premiums to\r\nHarrelson and the dealership accepted and retained those payments while failing to\r\nprocure an insurance policy from Life Investors. As a result, Mary's selection of\r\noptional insurance did not create a separate, binding insurance contract, but instead\r\narose out of the original Lease. Moreover, Mary did not allege in her complaint\r\nthat she was an \"insured or beneficiary under any insurance policy\" as stated in\r\nsection 15-48-10(b)(4). Instead, Mary's complaint alleged Harrelson breached its\r\nfiduciary duty and breached the parties' contract by failing to procure the credit life\r\ninsurance from Life Investors. Because Mary's asserted causes of action arise out\r\nof an automobile lease agreement and not an insurance contract, the circuit court\r\nproperly held Mary was required to submit her claims against Harrelson to binding\r\narbitration. See Cox, 347 S.C. at 468, 556 S.E.2d at 402 (holding section 15-48-\r\n10(b)(4) is a specific exemption limited only to entities within the insurance\r\nindustry).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe conclude the Lease between Mary and Harrelson did not create a duty to\r\ninsure. Therefore, the FAA governs the Lease in this case and compels arbitration.\r\nAccordingly, the order of the special circuit court judge is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4981","title":"State v.

McEachern appeals, asserting the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting various testimony, failing to sustain her objection to certain\r\narguments by the State which exceeded limitations placed by the trial court,\r\ndenying her mistrial motion based on improper comment by the State and\r\ndenying her motion for a new trial.\r\n\r\n              FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On March 9, 2007, Hollie McEachern was arrested, along with others,\r\nafter Dominic Thomas set up a drug deal for the Kershaw County Sheriff's\r\nDepartment, following Dominic's arrest by the Department earlier that day.\r\nDominic testified that after he was caught in a drug transaction involving\r\ncocaine, he offered to call some people from whom he could obtain drugs.\r\nAs a result, he called his friend Raheem, who kept Dominic on hold, telling\r\nhim \"he had to call his girl Hollie.\" Dominic told Raheem he wanted a \"Big\r\n8,\" which is four and a half ounces of powder cocaine. During this phone\r\ncall, Dominic had Raheem on speaker phone, where Lieutenant Dowey could\r\nhear the conversation. Raheem indicated he was \"waiting on his girl to see if\r\nshe was going to do it,\" because they were not sure they wanted to meet with\r\nDominic. Arrangements were ultimately made to meet in front of a nail salon\r\nbeside Domino's Pizza, where the \"Big 8\" was to be purchased for $3,200.\r\nAn officer then drove Dominic to the location in Dominic's truck. Dominic\r\ngot out of his truck and got into a vehicle with Hollie, Terrence Rivera, and\r\nTheodore Shepperd, who was known as Raheem. Dominic spoke with the\r\ndriver, Terrence, who Dominic knew, and then turned to Raheem and asked\r\nto see the drugs. Raheem, who was sitting in the back seat with Dominic,\r\nhad the drugs handed to him from the front seat. Dominic believed it was\r\n\nHollie who handed Raheem the drugs. Dominic indicated he had half of the\r\nmoney with him, and he told them he was going to get the other half when he\r\ngot out of the truck, at which time the police then surrounded the area.\r\n\r\n       Lieutenant Dowey testified that he was standing next to Dominic when\r\nDominic made the phone call to Raheem. When Dominic first called,\r\nRaheem said that \"he didn't have that much\" and he was \"waiting on his girl\r\nto get there.\" Raheem called them back, stating that \"she had gotten there\"\r\nand \"she had that much.\" Raheem declined to meet them at McDonald's as\r\nthey suggested, stating, \"Hollie doesn't want to drive that far . . . with that\r\nmuch weight.\" Ultimately, an agreement was made to meet at the nail salon.\r\nA police officer drove Dominic to the location in Dominic's vehicle. An\r\nSUV registered to Hollie arrived at the location, with Terrence driving, Hollie\r\nsitting in the front passenger seat, and Raheem sitting in the back, behind the\r\ndriver. After hearing Dominic say the code word, the officers executed the\r\ntake-down. Lieutenant Dowey stated a search of the vehicle revealed a black\r\nbag, located underneath the bench seat where Raheem and Dominic were\r\nseated, which contained cocaine, marijuana, a large quantity of crack cocaine,\r\nempty baggies and digital scales. Underneath the front seat the officers\r\nlocated a large quantity of cocaine in a red bag. Also found was a cigar\r\nblunt, containing marijuana, in the car's console. Terrence had, on his person,\r\ntwo small bags of marijuana and $1,723. Raheem had $320. Hollie had a\r\nblack purse in her possession which held $2,133 and 32 grams of marijuana.\r\nAfter the arrest was made, Dominic informed Lieutenant Dowey that Hollie\r\nhad passed the bag of drugs from the front seat to Raheem in the back.\r\n\r\n      Terrence Rivera testified that he, Hollie, and Raheem are all cousins.\r\nOn the day in question, he and Hollie left the restaurant owned by Hollie's\r\nmother, where they both worked, and went to their aunt's house. Terrence\r\ndrove Hollie's car because Hollie had a problem with her license. They gave\r\nRaheem a ride to a nail salon so he could pick up some money for a party\r\nRaheem was going to have. Hollie was in the passenger seat and Raheem\r\nwas sitting behind her. Raheem got out and then brought Dominic back to\r\nthe vehicle with him. When asked if he saw anything handed from the front\r\nseat to the back seat, Terrence stated, \"Not exactly. I seen her turn around,\r\nand that was it.\" He later reiterated that he saw Hollie turn around in the car,\r\nbut did not \"see exactly what she passed or if it was anything.\" Terrence\r\n\nstated that he was on the phone at the time, and did not really see what was\r\ngoing on in the car. After that, Raheem said something, Dominic got out of\r\nthe car, and Terrence looked up to see a gun in his face. Terrence admitted\r\nhe had a bag of marijuana and some money in his pocket, but claimed he was\r\n\"not guilty of these offenses.\" Terrence admitted he wrote a note to Raheem\r\nstating as follows:\r\n\r\n            Yo, Ra, just left the courthouse and gave my\r\n            statement, told them everything, just need you to say\r\n            that I was on the phone and couldn't hear what y'all\r\n            was talking about. Told them Hollie gave you the\r\n            drugs. Just remember I was on the phone and we're\r\n            good.\r\n\r\nTerrence stated he wrote the note to let Raheem know what was going on\r\nwith his side of the case and that he had given a statement. On cross-\r\nexamination, Terrence agreed his note told Raheem that he had informed\r\nauthorities that he saw Hollie pass drugs, but testified that was not true\r\nbecause he did not see Hollie pass drugs. When asked on re-direct why he\r\nwould lie to Raheem in that manner, Terrence stated, \"At the time I was\r\nwriting, my writing just got ahead of myself, and the letter was already out of\r\nmy hand.\"\r\n\r\n       The State also presented the testimony of Raheem. According to\r\nRaheem, on March 9, 2007, he received a call from Dominic about buying\r\nsome drugs. Dominic wanted a \"Big 8.\" Raheem called his cousin Hollie to\r\nsee if she could supply the drugs, and he waited on her and Terrence to come\r\nget him. With Terrence driving, Hollie in the front passenger seat, and\r\nRaheem sitting behind Terrence, they drove to the location. Hollie had\r\npulled a plastic sandwich bag out of the black bag and handed Raheem the\r\ndrugs over the seat. Dominic got in the car with them, and he told them he\r\nwas waiting on his cousin to get some money. Once Dominic got out of the\r\ncar, the police came. When asked why he thought he could get the drugs\r\nfrom Hollie, Raheem stated that he was dealing drugs and she was who he\r\nused to get his drugs from in the past, stating it was \"an ongoing thing,\" and\r\ncharacterizing himself as the middle man. Raheem testified that all of the\r\n\ndrugs found in the car that day were Hollie's, with the exception of the two\r\nbags of marijuana found on Terrence.\r\n\r\n      The marijuana found in Hollie's pocketbook weighed 32.5 grams. The\r\nother marijuana found in the common area of Hollie's automobile weighed 25\r\ngrams. The various other drugs in individual plastic bags found in the\r\nvehicle tested positive for powder cocaine, with weights of 124.73 grams,\r\n28.77 grams, and 6.61 grams, and crack cocaine, with weights of 12.25\r\ngrams, 3.31 grams, and 13.7 grams.\r\n\r\n      Hollie took the stand in her own defense. She testified that in March\r\n2007, she was the manager of her mother's restaurant, drawing a salary of\r\n$400 a week and earning tips on top of that. At the time the incident\r\noccurred on March 9, 2007, Hollie stated she had cashed two payroll checks\r\nin the amount of $400 each, and that money was in her pocketbook at the\r\ntime she was arrested. Hollie testified that she also had about $700 cash in\r\nher pocketbook that she was supposed to use to pay for a delivery of supplies\r\nfor the restaurant. About $180 in her pocketbook was a roll of \"old 20's\" that\r\nshe collected. The rest of the money in her pocketbook was proceeds from\r\nthe restaurant that she had not yet deposited into the bank. Hollie testified\r\nthat none of the money found in her pocketbook was drug money.\r\n\r\n       On the night in question, she and Terrence left the restaurant to go to\r\nher aunt's house, where Raheem lived. Terrence was driving because her\r\nlicense had been suspended for a simple possession of marijuana charge.\r\nWhile there, Raheem asked for a ride to pick up some money for a party\r\nRaheem was having that night, and Hollie agreed. They drove to the nail\r\nplace, where Raheem exited the car. There was a man standing outside who\r\nHollie did not know, and this person got in the car with Raheem. The man\r\nfirst talked to Terrence, and then he and Raheem engaged in conversation.\r\nThe man said \"I'll be right back,\" and then the police came and arrested them.\r\nHollie admitted she had purchased the marijuana found in her pocketbook\r\nthat day for $150, maintaining it was for her personal use and explaining she\r\nhad been addicted to marijuana and it was more cost efficient to purchase that\r\namount. She denied that Raheem ever called her and asked her to bring\r\ndrugs, denied ever selling crack or cocaine to anyone, and denied handing\r\nsomething to the back seat while Dominic was in the car. She proclaimed she\r\n\ndid not \"have anything to do with the crack and the cocaine that were found\r\nin the car that night.\"\r\n\r\n      The jury convicted Hollie of trafficking in cocaine, trafficking in crack\r\ncocaine, and possession with intent to distribute marijuana. This appeal\r\nfollows.                           ISSUES\r\n\r\n       1.   Whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning\r\nHollie's civil forfeiture of money seized during her arrest, this error being\r\ncompounded by the State's argument which exceeded the court's limitation on\r\nthis evidence.\r\n\r\n       2.    Whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning\r\npost-arrest assistance Hollie provided to her cousin and co-defendant and\r\nfailing to sustain her objection to the State's argument based on that evidence\r\nwhich exceeded limitations placed by the trial court.\r\n\r\n      3.     Whether the trial court erred in denying Hollie's mistrial motion\r\nbased on an improper comment by the State and allowing the State to\r\nquestion her about selling drugs to particular individuals without a proper\r\nfoundation for such questions, and in denying her motion for a new trial after\r\nthe State failed to comply with the court's ruling.\r\n\r\n      4.    Whether the trial court erred in denying Hollie's motion for a new\r\ntrial on the basis of the above errors, singly or cumulatively, and in\r\nconsideration of multiple instances of improper argument by the State.\r\n\r\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\r\nState v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). The appellate\r\ncourt \"does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial\r\njudge's ruling is supported by any evidence.\" Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\n\n                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   A. Civil Forfeiture of Money\r\n\r\n      The record shows that during cross-examination in relation to Hollie's\r\ndirect testimony regarding the money found in her pocketbook, the solicitor\r\nbegan to question Hollie concerning a consent order she signed. Defense\r\ncounsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection to the admission\r\nof the document. When the solicitor inquired if he could ask Hollie if she\r\nconsented to the forfeiture, without presenting the order itself, defense\r\ncounsel again objected. The court ruled the document was not admissible,\r\nbut concluded whether Hollie forfeited the money was relevant and could be\r\nasked. The solicitor agreed he understood that when he argued to the jury, he\r\ncould not use that evidence as an admission.\r\n\r\n      When Hollie's cross-examination resumed in front of the jury, she\r\nadmitted, in spite of her testimony regarding where the $2,133 came from,\r\nshe agreed to forfeit the vast majority of the money to the State. Hollie went\r\non to explain that she did so after her attorney told her it would be difficult to\r\nget the rest of the money back, because of the marijuana in her purse.\r\n\r\n      During the State's closing argument, the solicitor argued Hollie was not\r\nforthright and stated, \"[S]he consented she had $2,133, she got $500 back.\r\nSo she had $1633 she consented to be forfeited as drug proceeds to the\r\nState.\" Defense counsel objected, noting the court had limited the solicitor's\r\nargument on this matter, and moved to strike. The trial court sustained the\r\nobjection and instructed the jury to \"[s]trike the most recent statement,\"\r\nnoting the only evidence was that there was a forfeiture.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, Hollie contends the trial court erred in admitting testimony\r\nconcerning her forfeiture of money. She argues a judgment in a civil action\r\ncannot be introduced as evidence in a criminal action to establish the facts on\r\nwhich it was rendered. She asserts, like the forfeiture judgment itself,\r\ntestimony concerning the forfeiture is inadmissible. Hollie further contends\r\nthis evidence was not relevant, was extremely prejudicial, and the prejudice\r\noutweighed the probative value such that its admission was reversible error.\r\nShe further maintains this prejudice was heightened when the solicitor\r\n\ncontravened the court's prior limitation on the use of the evidence and argued\r\nthe fact of consent to the jury.\r\n\r\n      We need not decide whether evidence concerning a consent forfeiture\r\norder is admissible in a criminal trial, as we find Hollie opened the door to\r\nthis evidence. The admission or exclusion of evidence falls within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\nabuse of that discretion. State v. Morris, 376 S.C. 189, 205, 656 S.E.2d 359,\r\n368 (2008). An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's decision is\r\nbased on an error of law or upon factual findings that are without evidentiary\r\nsupport. Id. at 206, 656 S.E.2d at 368. As well, the scope of cross-\r\nexamination is within the discretion of the trial court, and the court's decision\r\nwill not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of prejudice. State v. Colf,\r\n337 S.C. 622, 625, 525 S.E.2d 246, 247-48 (2000). When a party introduces\r\nevidence about a particular matter, the other party is entitled to introduce\r\nevidence in explanation or rebuttal thereof, even if the latter evidence would\r\nhave been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially. State v.\r\nJackson, 364 S.C. 329, 336, 613 S.E.2d 374, 377 (2005); State v. Stroman,\r\n281 S.C. 508, 513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 398 (1984); State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45,\r\n52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Taylor, 333 S.C.\r\n159, 174, 508 S.E.2d 870, 878 (1998) (noting an accused may be cross-\r\nexamined as to all matters which he himself has brought up on direct\r\nexamination). \"It is firmly established that otherwise inadmissible evidence\r\nmay be properly admitted when opposing counsel opens the door to that\r\nevidence.\" State v. Page, 378 S.C. 476, 482, 663 S.E.2d 357, 360 (Ct. App.\r\n2008).Here, Hollie gave lengthy testimony concerning where all the money\r\ncame from that was found in her pocketbook to rebut any inference that the\r\nmoney was connected to the drugs. Further, Hollie specifically proclaimed\r\nnone of the money found in her pocketbook was drug money. Thus, Hollie\r\nopened the door to admission of evidence that she agreed to forfeit the money\r\nin question, and we therefore find no error in the admission of this evidence.\r\nWe further note that her testimony on this matter on cross-examination was\r\nlimited to her acknowledgement that she forfeited the majority of the money\r\nfound in her pocketbook to the State, and she was thereafter allowed to\r\nexplain that she did so on the advice of her attorney, in consideration of the\r\n\nmarijuana found in her pocketbook. Accordingly, we do not believe she has\r\nshown prejudicial error. Finally, we note in regard to Hollie's assertion that\r\nthe solicitor exceeded the trial court's limitations placed on this evidence in\r\nclosing argument, the trial court sustained Hollie's objection and struck the\r\nargument as requested. See State v. Primus, 341 S.C. 592, 604, 535 S.E.2d\r\n152, 158 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding, where a curative instruction is given and\r\nthe objecting party does not contemporaneously challenge the sufficiency of\r\nthe corrective charge or move for a mistrial, no issue is preserved for review),\r\nrev'd in part on other grounds, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002).\r\n\r\n   B. Assistance Provided to Terrence\r\n\r\n       On direct examination Terrence testified, without objection, that his\r\nmother, cousins, and family hired his attorney for him. The solicitor then\r\nasked if Hollie was involved in hiring his lawyer. Defense counsel objected\r\non the grounds of relevance. The trial court sustained this objection. The\r\nsolicitor then asked if Hollie ever offered to pay for a lawyer for him.\r\nDefense counsel again objected and the trial court sustained this objection as\r\nwell. The solicitor asserted the matter went to \"the continuum of the\r\nconspiracy.\" Out of the presence of the jury, the trial court asked what the\r\nrelevance was, and the solicitor maintained that Hollie was charged with\r\nconspiracy to traffic drugs along with Terrence and Raheem, and that the\r\nconspiracy did not end when the parties were arrested. He told the court he\r\nhad been informed by Terrence that Hollie provided Terrence the financial\r\nsupport to retain his attorney, and this was evidence of a continuing\r\nconspiracy between the family members. Defense counsel argued the\r\nconspiracy ended once the arrests occurred, and there could be no evidence of\r\nconspiracy post-arrest. The trial court sustained defense counsel's objection,\r\nand stated \"[t]he whole business of how [Terrence's attorney] got retained is\r\nnot admissible.\" Thereafter, on redirect examination, Terrence testified\r\nHollie had offered to provide financial assistance to him after his arrest, and\r\nthis occurred just prior to Terrence retaining his latest counsel. Terrence\r\ndenied there was any discussion with Hollie in regard to her financial\r\nassistance and what his version of the facts were, and was adamant that the\r\nfinancial assistance offer was not tied to his testimony whatsoever. Defense\r\ncounsel did not object to this line of questioning on redirect.\r\n\n       Following Hollie's direct testimony, the solicitor sought to cross-\r\nexamine her regarding her visiting Terrence's attorney. In a proffer, Hollie\r\nstated she went to the attorney's office with Terrence's mother because his\r\nmother did not have a vehicle. Hollie denied assisting Terrence's mother\r\nfinancially in retaining representation for Terrence, stating she only gave his\r\nmother money to put in Terrence's account at jail. Defense counsel objected\r\nto this testimony as being irrelevant. The solicitor argued it tied in with the\r\nevidence concerning the note from Terrence to Raheem regarding them\r\ncoordinating their testimony and Terrence's testimony that Hollie offered him\r\nfinancial assistance. The trial court indicated it would allow the evidence.\r\nDefense counsel then argued the prejudicial value outweighed any probative\r\nvalue. The solicitor reiterated that the evidence was probative of the\r\nconspiracy, which involved the cover-up of the crime. The trial court\r\nultimately determined it was \"going to allow it, but only in a very limited\r\nsense,\" and instructed the solicitor to not go beyond what Hollie \"just\r\ntestified.\"\r\n\r\n       When cross-examination of Hollie resumed before the jury, the\r\nsolicitor asked her if she ever sent money, either directly or through someone\r\nelse, to Terrence's account in jail. Hollie responded that she had given\r\nTerrence's mother some money at one time because she had indicated\r\nTerrence was \"doing really bad,\" and he was unable to call anyone or get any\r\nfood or long johns. She also acknowledged she took Terrence's mother to\r\nobtain a lawyer for him.\r\n\r\n      During the State's closing argument, the solicitor stated, \"[U]sually\r\nwhen you have a conspiracy case it ends when the arrest is made, but this one\r\nwas interesting because we've got [Terrence] still trying to coordinate\r\ntestimony, we've got [Hollie] offering financial assistance to [Terrence]….\"\r\nAt this point, defense counsel objected, stating he thought the trial court had\r\n\"ruled in this area that that was not evidence of the ongoing conspiracy,\" and\r\nthe solicitor was \"again disregarding [the court's] ruling.\" The solicitor stated\r\nthat he did not recall that being the court's ruling, and the trial court then\r\nstated, \"Move on.\" Thereafter, the solicitor argued that Terrence testified he\r\nreceived financial assistance from Hollie right before he obtained his\r\nattorney, and Hollie admitted she gave money for Terrence's account and\r\n\nwent to the office of his attorney for him. No further objection was made to\r\nthis argument.\r\n\r\n      On appeal, Hollie contends the trial judge erred in admitting testimony\r\nconcerning her post-arrest financial assistance to Terrence, and further erred\r\nin not sustaining her objection to the State's argument, which exceeded the\r\nlimitation imposed by the trial court. She argues any conspiracy which may\r\nhave existed terminated upon the arrest of the three defendants. Hollie\r\nmaintains her assistance in her family's efforts to hire a lawyer for her cousin\r\nand provision of incidental expenses while he was in jail was not evidence of\r\nan ongoing conspiracy, and was irrelevant to any issue in the case.\r\nAdditionally, Hollie contends the solicitor \"blatantly exceeded the court's\r\nlimitation,\" as the court specifically ruled that how Terrence's attorney got\r\nretained was not admissible. She therefore asserts the court committed\r\nadditional error in not striking the solicitor's argument to the jury in this\r\nregard.Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, SCRE; State\r\nv. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 578, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007). Relevant\r\nevidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\nthat is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or\r\nless probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SCRE. The\r\ntrial court has broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and\r\nits decision to admit or exclude evidence will not be reversed on appeal\r\nabsent an abuse of that discretion and a showing of prejudice. State v.\r\nHolder, 382 S.C. 278, 288, 676 S.E.2d 690, 696 (2009); State v. Gaster, 349\r\nS.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).\r\n\r\n      First, it should be noted that the trial court sustained Hollie's objections\r\nto the questioning of Terrence in regard to how Terrence's attorney was\r\nretained, and no unobjected to testimony from Terrence was admitted in this\r\nregard. Thus, the only testimony admitted on this subject for which an\r\nobjection is preserved for review is that of Hollie.\r\n\r\n     \"Bias, prejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to\r\nimpeach the witness either by examination of the witness or by evidence\r\notherwise adduced.\" Rule 608(c), SCRE (emphasis added). \"Proof of bias is\r\n\nalmost always relevant because the jury, as finder of fact and weigher of\r\ncredibility, has historically been entitled to assess all evidence which might\r\nbear on the accuracy and truth of a witness' testimony.\" State v. Pipkin, 359\r\nS.C. 322, 327, 597 S.E.2d 831, 833 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting U.S. v. Abel,\r\n469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 469, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984)). Rule 608(c),\r\nSCRE, \"preserves South Carolina precedent holding that generally, 'anything\r\nhaving a legitimate tendency to throw light on the accuracy, truthfulness, and\r\nsincerity of a witness may be shown and considered in determining the credit\r\nto be accorded his testimony.'\" State v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 570, 541 S.E.2d\r\n813, 817 (2001) (quoting State v. Brewington, 267 S.C. 97, 226 S.E.2d 249\r\n(1976)).\r\n\r\n       We find the evidence was properly admitted to show bias.1 Here,\r\nevidence that Hollie provided Terrence's mother transportation to assist in\r\nattaining an attorney for Terrence, as well as evidence that she provided him\r\nfinancial assistance by giving Terrence's mother some money to put in his\r\naccount was relevant to Terrence's potential bias toward Hollie.\r\nAdditionally, we note that evidence was admitted through Terrence, without\r\nobjection, that Hollie had offered to provide financial assistance to him after\r\nhis arrest, and this assistance occurred just prior to Terrence retaining his\r\nlatest counsel. Accordingly, even assuming arguendo the admission of\r\nHollie's testimony in this regard was error, any such error is harmless. See\r\nHolder, 382 S.C. at 289, 676 S.E.2d at 696-97 (holding the erroneous\r\nadmission of evidence is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it is\r\nminimal in the context of the entire record and cumulative to other testimony\r\nadmitted without objection); State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247\r\nS.E.2d 334, 337 (1978) (the admission of improper evidence is deemed\r\nharmless if it is merely cumulative to other evidence). See also State v.\r\nMizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318-19 (2002) (noting whether\r\nan error is harmless depends on the particular facts of each case, including:\r\nthe importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether\r\nthe testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence\r\ncorroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material\r\n\r\n1 We note that this court may affirm based on any ground appearing in the\r\nrecord. Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\n\npoints, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and the overall\r\nstrength of the prosecution's case). \"'Harmless beyond a reasonable doubt'\r\nmeans the reviewing court can conclude the error did not contribute to the\r\nverdict beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319.\r\n\r\n       We further find no merit to Hollie's assertion that the court committed\r\nerror in not striking the solicitor's argument to the jury, because the solicitor\r\nexceeded the court's limitation in its admonishment concerning the\r\ninadmissibility of how Terrence's attorney was retained. First, we do not\r\nbelieve the solicitor exceeded the court's admonishment. Defense counsel's\r\nobjection to this argument by the solicitor was that the trial court had ruled\r\nthis was not evidence of the ongoing conspiracy, and the solicitor was\r\ntherefore disregarding the court's ruling. However, the record does not reflect\r\nsuch a ruling by the trial court. Rather, the ruling to which Hollie points on\r\nappeal is the court's initial determination that evidence of how Terrence's\r\nattorney was retained was inadmissible. The trial court never determined that\r\nthe evidence objected to did not qualify as evidence of an ongoing\r\nconspiracy. As to Hollie's assertion that the trial court erred in not striking\r\nthe solicitor's argument in this regard, Hollie never requested the court strike\r\nthe argument. After Hollie's initial objection, the court instructed the solicitor\r\nto \"move on.\" When the solicitor thereafter argued Terrence testified he\r\nreceived financial assistance from Hollie right before he obtained his\r\nattorney, and Hollie admitted she gave money for Terrence's account and\r\nwent to the office of his attorney for him, defense counsel raised no further\r\nobjection. See State v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 606, 611 S.E.2d 283, 293 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005) (noting, where a party objects to improper comments in closing\r\narguments and the objection is sustained, the issue is not preserved unless the\r\nparty further moves to strike or requests a curative instruction). Finally, after\r\nreviewing the solicitor's argument in context of the entire record, we find no\r\nreversible error. See State v. Finklea, 388 S.C. 379, 385-86, 697 S.E.2d 543,\r\n547 (2010) (noting the trial court is vested with broad discretion in dealing\r\nwith the range and propriety of closing arguments, and ordinarily his rulings\r\non such matters will not be disturbed; the burden is on the appellant to show\r\nthat any alleged error deprived her of a fair trial; the relevant question is\r\nwhether the solicitor's action so infected the trial with unfairness as to make\r\nthe resulting conviction a denial of due process; and the appellate court must\r\nreview the argument in the context of the entire record).\r\n\n   C. Selling of Drugs to Particular Individuals\r\n\r\n      During cross-examination of Hollie, the solicitor asked her if she knew\r\n\"Earl Warren.\" When Hollie replied, \"not by that name,\" the solicitor then\r\nasked, \"You hadn't just sold him four cookies of crack that same night?\"\r\nHollie replied that she had not, and did not even know who he was. Defense\r\ncounsel objected, at which point the solicitor stated, \"She testified earlier that\r\nshe had never sold any before, so I'm going to ask her specific names of\r\npeople that we have heard that she was supplying to.\" Defense counsel\r\nobjected again, and the trial court had the jury removed from the courtroom\r\nfor counsel to further argue the matter. Defense counsel then stated his\r\nobjection as follows:\r\n\r\n            Your Honor, I recognize he is on cross-examination,\r\n            but he hasn't laid any sort of foundation for this\r\n            question. And then he blurted out in front of the jury,\r\n            well, we have heard that she sold cookies to these\r\n            people. I mean, he is testifying. I don't know how\r\n            you can unring that bell. I would first request a\r\n            curative instruction and ask you to ask the jury to\r\n            disregard the remarks that [the solicitor] made about\r\n            what they heard and that it is not evidence in this\r\n            case. If not, I would have to ask for a mistrial.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the solicitor's comment, that they had heard Hollie was\r\nsupplying to specific people, was the equivalent of the solicitor testifying.\r\nThe solicitor maintained he had a good faith basis to ask Hollie the question\r\nbecause Raheem's attorney relayed information that she was the supplier for\r\nEarl Warren and Jarminski Cook, and defense counsel had asked Hollie if she\r\never sold the drugs, thus making the question about previous incidents\r\nproper. Defense counsel argued that his question to Hollie did not \"open the\r\ndoor for an improper comment by the solicitor.\" The trial court agreed with\r\ndefense counsel on that point, and indicated it would give a curative\r\ninstruction on the matter. As to the line of questioning concerning sales to\r\nother individuals, the court determined the solicitor could ask Hollie \"if she\r\nhad ever sold it to, blank\", but he was not allowed to state \"we have heard\r\n\nthat you have,\" because that would be the solicitor testifying. The court\r\nnoted the solicitor may have inadvertently informed the jury that he had\r\nheard that information, but he was not \"to do it anymore.\" It then stated as\r\nfollows:   Now, if you bring these witnesses in to contradict\r\n           her, that's fine. If she denies that she sold it to X or Y\r\n           or Z, you can bring those people in. One has already\r\n           testified. But that is as far as I'm - - I mean, you can't\r\n           bring them in through you, you have got to bring\r\n           them in to prove that she is - - to impeach her and\r\n           prove that she is not telling the truth.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel inquired whether the trial court intended to give a curative\r\ninstruction, and the court informed him that it did. Defense counsel then\r\nsaid, \"And you have overruled my motion for a mistrial,\" to which the court\r\nstated, \"At this point.\"\r\n\r\n      Once the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial court instructed as\r\nfollows:   All right, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, with\r\n           regard to the last comment by the solicitor about, we\r\n           know this or we know that, I'm going to ask you to\r\n           disregard that comment. It is not evidence in this\r\n           case. As I told you at the beginning of the trial, the\r\n           evidence comes from the witness, not from what the\r\n           solicitors may say or ask or make any comment\r\n           about. This lady is all the evidence that you are\r\n           hearing at this time. So I'm going to ask you to\r\n           disregard that last comment and strike it from the\r\n           record and strike it from your consideration in this\r\n           case.\r\n\r\nWhen Hollie resumed her cross-examination, the solicitor asked her if she\r\nknew Jarminski Cook and whether she supplied his drugs. Hollie testified\r\nshe knew Cook, but denied supplying him drugs. The solicitor then asked if\r\n\nshe knew Jarvis Gibbs, and she denied knowing him. Hollie agreed that she\r\ndid not know Earl Warren or Jarvis Gibbs, but she did know Jarminski Cook.\r\nThe solicitor then asked, \"And you deny being involved with all three of\r\nthem,\" to which Hollie replied, \"Yes, sir.\" No further objection was noted by\r\ndefense counsel.\r\n\r\n      On appeal, McEachern argues the trial court erred in denying her\r\nmotion for a mistrial based on the improper comment by the State and in\r\nallowing the State to question her about selling drugs to particular individuals\r\nwithout a proper foundation for such questions, and further erred in denying\r\nher motion for a new trial after the State failed to comply with the court's\r\nruling. Hollie makes three separate arguments in this regard.\r\n\r\n      First, she contends the improper comment by the solicitor in the\r\npresence of the jury was not capable of being cured by an instruction to the\r\njury to disregard it, such that the trial court's failure to grant a mistrial was an\r\nabuse of discretion.\r\n\r\n        Second, Hollie argues the solicitor did not have a proper foundation for\r\nasking about whether she knew or supplied drugs to these individuals. She\r\nmaintains the solicitor gave no basis \"whatsoever for questioning [her] about\r\n. . . Jarvis Gibbs.\" As to the others, she contends the State's information was\r\n\"based on pure hearsay from an unnamed attorney for one of the co-\r\ndefendants,\" and \"[t]here was no representation that the information was\r\nbased on that attorney's personal knowledge of the alleged facts\" or that\r\nattorney had obtained the information from a reliable source. She argues the\r\ninformation was not from someone with first-hand knowledge of the alleged\r\nsales, such that the State did not have a good faith basis for these questions.\r\nAccordingly, she maintains, because the State failed to provide any\r\nfoundation for its question concerning Jarvis Gibbs, and inasmuch as it did\r\nnot provide a sufficient foundation for its questions concerning Earl Warren\r\nand Jarminski Cook, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing this line\r\nof cross-examination.\r\n\r\n      Finally, Hollie contends the trial court abused its discretion in not\r\ngranting a new trial after the State failed to comply with the court's\r\nrequirement that it produce the witnesses if Hollie denied she had previously\r\n\nsold drugs to the three individuals. She argues the court instructed the\r\nsolicitor as to this requirement, and upon the State's failure to produce the\r\nfoundation witnesses as the court instructed, the trial court should have\r\ngranted her motion for a new trial.\r\n\r\n       First, we find no reversible error in the trial court's denial of Hollie's\r\nmotion for a mistrial based on the improper comment by the State. The\r\ndecision to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial is a matter within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\nabsent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. State v. Council,\r\n335 S.C. 1, 12, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999). A mistrial should be granted\r\nonly when absolutely necessary. Id. at 13, 515 S.E.2d at 514. Further, before\r\na defendant may receive a mistrial, he or she must show both error and\r\nresulting prejudice. Id.\r\n\r\n       Here, Hollie clearly requested a curative instruction, and in the event\r\nthe trial court declined to give such an instruction, requested that the court\r\ngrant her a mistrial. The trial court then instructed the jury to disregard the\r\nsolicitor's comment, noting it was not evidence in the case, and the jury was\r\ntold to strike it from the record and from their consideration. Accordingly,\r\nHollie received the relief she sought and should not now be heard to\r\ncomplain. See State v. Parris, 387 S.C. 460, 466, 692 S.E.2d 207, 210 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010) (holding where a defendant receives the relief requested from the\r\ntrial court, there is no issue for the appellate court to decide); State v. Brown,\r\n389 S.C. 84, 95, 697 S.E.2d 622, 628 (Ct. App. 2010) (finding, where defense\r\ncounsel received the relief asked for, the defendant could not complain on\r\nappeal). Hollie contends, however, that the issue is nonetheless preserved\r\nbecause defense counsel noted in argument to the trial court that he did not\r\nknow how the court could \"unring that bell,\" thus indicating the defense was\r\nseeking a mistrial and, following argument on the issue and learning the court\r\nintended to give a curative instruction, specifically inquired about the mistrial\r\nmotion. We note, however, that defense counsel failed to object to the\r\ncurative instruction as given, and did not make a mistrial motion after the\r\ngiving of the instruction. \"If a trial court issues a curative instruction, a party\r\nmust make a contemporaneous objection to the sufficiency of the curative\r\ninstruction to preserve an alleged error for review.\" Brown, 389 S.C. at 95,\r\n697 S.E.2d at 628. Where an objection is sustained, the trial court has\r\n\nrendered a favorable ruling to the party, and it therefore \"becomes necessary\r\nthat the sustained party move to cure, or move for a mistrial if such a cure is\r\ninsufficient, in order to create an appealable issue.\" State v. Wilson, 389 S.C.\r\n579, 583, 698 S.E.2d 862, 864 (Ct. App. 2010) (emphasis added).\r\n\"Moreover, as the law assumes a curative instruction will remedy an error, . .\r\n. failure to object to the sufficiency of that charge, renders the issue waived\r\nand unpreserved for appellate review.\" Id. Because Hollie failed to object to\r\nthe curative instruction, and additionally failed to move for a mistrial after the\r\ntrial court gave its curative instruction, we find the mistrial issue is not\r\npreserved for review. Furthermore, even if this issue were properly\r\npreserved, we believe the trial court's explicit curative instruction cured any\r\nerror, and that the prejudicial effect is minimal such that a mistrial was not\r\nwarranted. See Brown, 389 S.C. at 95, 697 S.E.2d at 628 (noting a curative\r\ninstruction is usually deemed to cure an alleged error); State v. Moyd, 321\r\nS.C. 256, 263, 468 S.E.2d 7, 11 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding a trial court should\r\nexhaust other available methods to cure prejudice before aborting a trial, and\r\nwhere the prejudicial effect is minimal, a mistrial need not be granted in\r\nevery case where incompetent evidence is received and later stricken and a\r\ncurative instruction is given).\r\n\r\n      In regard to Hollie's argument that the solicitor failed to have a proper\r\nfoundation to ask Hollie questions concerning her selling drugs to individuals\r\nbecause the State's information was based on hearsay from an unnamed\r\nattorney and, in the case of Jarvis Gibbs, there was no basis whatsoever for\r\nthe questioning, we find no reversible error. As noted by Hollie, our courts\r\nhave held that a cross-examiner must have a good faith factual basis before\r\nquestioning a witness about his or her past conduct. State v. Joseph, 328 S.C.\r\n352, 359, 491 S.E.2d 275, 278 (Ct. App. 1997). Counsel should not be\r\npermitted to go on a fishing expedition, and \"[m]erely asking a question that\r\nhas no basis in fact may be prejudicial.\" State v. McGuire, 272 S.C. 547,\r\n550, 253 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1979). Here, however, the argument made by\r\ndefense counsel in this regard was to the solicitor's question of whether\r\nHollie sold crack to Earl Warren the night of this incident, at which point\r\ndefense counsel objected because the solicitor had not \"laid any sort of\r\nfoundation for this question.\" Defense counsel also objected at that time to\r\nthe improper comment by the solicitor. The solicitor then explained his basis\r\nfor asking the question, and defense counsel did not thereafter contest the\r\n\nbasis given by the solicitor as being insufficient, but concentrated his\r\nargument instead on the solicitor's improper argument in front of the jury. It\r\nis only on appeal that Hollie contends the foundation given by the solicitor\r\nwas insufficient to provide a factual basis and amounted to a fishing\r\nexpedition. Accordingly, the argument made on appeal, that the solicitor's\r\nstated foundation was insufficient, was not presented to the trial court, and\r\ntherefore is not preserved for our review. See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C.\r\n125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005) (finding argument advanced on appeal\r\nwas not raised and ruled on below and therefore was not preserved for\r\nreview); I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d\r\n716, 724 (2000) (noting a losing party must first try to convince the lower\r\ncourt it is has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the\r\nappellate court that the lower court erred; imposing preservation requirements\r\non the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has\r\nconsidered all relevant facts, law, and arguments; the purpose of an appeal is\r\nto determine whether the trial judge erroneously acted or failed to act and\r\nwhen appellant's contentions are not presented to or passed upon by the trial\r\njudge, such contentions will not be considered on appeal). We further note\r\nthat defense counsel raised no objection whatsoever concerning any questions\r\nrelated to Jarvis Gibbs. Additionally, we note that the mere asking of an\r\nimproper question is not necessarily prejudicial, where no evidence is\r\nintroduced as a result. Brown, 389 S.C. at 93, 697 S.E.2d at 627. Here,\r\nHollie denied even knowing Warren or Gibbs, and denied \"being involved\"\r\nwith any of the three men. Thus, we find any error in allowing these\r\nquestions was harmless.\r\n\r\n       Finally, we find no merit to Hollie's argument the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in not granting a new trial because the State failed to comply with\r\nthe court's requirement that it produce the witnesses if Hollie denied she had\r\npreviously sold drugs to the three individuals. First, we believe appellate\r\ncounsel has misinterpreted the trial court's ruling. The court did not, as\r\nHollie suggests, require the solicitor to produce witnesses if Hollie testified\r\nshe had not previously sold drugs to these individuals. Rather, a reading of\r\nthis portion of the court's ruling indicates only that the court prohibited the\r\nsolicitor from testifying as to what the State \"heard,\" but indicated the State\r\nmight possibly be allowed to present those witnesses if Hollie denied selling\r\nthe drugs to them. At any rate, this issue is clearly not preserved, as it was\r\n\nnever raised to or ruled upon by the trial court. State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53,\r\n58-59, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (noting, in order to properly preserve an\r\nissue for appellate review, there must be a contemporaneous objection that is\r\nruled upon by the trial court, and if a party fails to properly object, he is\r\nprocedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal); State v. McKnight, 352\r\nS.C. 635, 646-47, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003) (noting contention must be\r\nraised to and ruled upon by trial court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\n   D. Motion for New Trial based on Singular and Cumulative Errors\r\n\r\n       Lastly, Hollie argues the trial judge erred in denying her motion for a\r\nnew trial based upon the above argued errors, singly or cumulatively, as well\r\nas in consideration of multiple instances of improper argument by the State.\r\nFirst, she contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant her a\r\nnew trial based upon each of the errors argued in her first three issues. Next\r\nshe argues, even if no single error sufficiently prejudiced her, that the\r\ncumulative effect of the errors was so prejudicial as to deprive her of a fair\r\ntrial. She maintains that if the trial court erred as to any two or three of these\r\nissues, the jury likely based its verdict on these multiple improper\r\nconsiderations. Finally, Hollie argues the cumulative prejudice should be\r\nevaluated in light of other improper comments and arguments by the\r\nsolicitor, as to which objections were sustained. Thus, Hollie maintains,\r\nagainst the backdrop of these numerous prosecutorial excesses, the trial\r\ncourt's error with respect to any single evidentiary issue, or multiple errors in\r\ncombination, was so prejudicial as to require reversal and warrant a new trial.\r\n\r\n      We find the facts of this case do not support a finding of cumulative\r\nerrors warranting reversal. An appellant must demonstrate more than error in\r\norder to qualify for reversal pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine. State\r\nv. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 93, 512 S.E.2d 795, 803 (1999). The errors must\r\nadversely affect her right to a fair trial to qualify for reversal on this ground.\r\nId. In this regard, our courts have \"stressed on more than one occasion, the\r\nConstitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\"\r\nId. (quoting State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 199-200, 498 S.E.2d 642, 647-\r\n48 (1998)).\r\n\n       First, because we have found no errors in regard to the other issues, this\r\nissue is without merit. See State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 290, 350\r\nS.E.2d 180, 186 (1986) (holding where the appellate court found no errors,\r\nappellant's assertion the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of\r\nthe cumulative effect of the asserted trial errors had no merit); State v.\r\nNicholson, 366 S.C. 568, 581, 623 S.E.2d 100, 106 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding,\r\nwhere appellant asserted the cumulative effect of the errors he alleged\r\nwarranted a new trial, because the appellate court determined that the trial\r\njudge did not err in any of the particulars alleged in the appeal, the\r\ncumulative error doctrine was inapplicable). Further, even if the court did\r\ncommit any errors, we believe those errors to be harmless such that Hollie\r\ncan show neither prejudice, nor that the errors affected her right to a fair trial.\r\nSee Johnson, 334 S.C. at 93, 512 S.E.2d at 803 (finding the defendant failed\r\nto show he suffered prejudice warranting a new trial based on cumulative\r\ntrial errors); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 373, 453 S.E.2d 890, 891 (1995)\r\n(error in admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other\r\nevidence which was properly admitted). As to the other sustained objections\r\nof which Hollie complains, our reading of the record does not support the\r\nprejudice she maintains in her appellate brief. Accordingly, we find Hollie\r\nfailed to demonstrate cumulative errors adversely affected her right to fair\r\ntrial.For the foregoing reasons, Hollie's convictions are\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      PIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5001","title":"State v.

The State appeals the circuit court's decision to grant Hawes\r\nearly parole eligibility under section 16-25-90 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2011). We affirm.\r\n\n    I.   Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nHawes and his wife were estranged in 2007 when he shot and killed her. He was\r\nindicted for murder but pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter. He also pled guilty\r\nto possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The circuit\r\ncourt sentenced Hawes to twenty-two years in prison for voluntary manslaughter\r\nand five years concurrent for possession of a firearm.\r\n\r\nAt the sentencing hearing, Hawes asserted section 16-25-90 applied to make him\r\nparole eligible after serving one-fourth of his voluntary manslaughter sentence.\r\nSection 16-25-90 states in part:\r\n\r\n            [A]n inmate who was convicted of, or pled guilty . . . to,\r\n            an offense against a household member is eligible for\r\n            parole after serving one-fourth of his prison term when\r\n            the inmate at the time he pled guilty . . . presented\r\n            credible evidence of a history of criminal domestic\r\n            violence, as provided in Section 16-25-20, suffered at the\r\n            hands of the household member.\r\n\r\nHawes presented the following evidence that he suffered criminal domestic\r\nviolence (CDV) at the hands of his wife:\r\n\r\n         1. A 1996 municipal court conviction in which Hawes' wife pled guilty\r\n            to CDV against Hawes. Hawes was also convicted of CDV against\r\n            her for the same incident.\r\n         2. A separate CDV indictment, pending at the time of the 1996 incident,\r\n            in which Hawes' wife allegedly struck and kicked him.\r\n         3. A July 2006 CDV indictment stating she did \"willfully or unlawfully\r\n            cause or offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to his family\r\n            or household member, to wit: Alonzo Craig Hawes, with apparent\r\n            present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of\r\n            imminent peril.\"\r\n         4. A November 2006 incident report stating Hawes called the police\r\n            complaining about a domestic disturbance in which his wife had a\r\n            knife. When the police arrived, Hawes was gone, and his wife denied\r\n            anything \"other than a verbal altercation\" occurred.\r\n\n          5. A 2007 incident in which Hawes claimed his wife stabbed his hand.\r\n             Hawes sought treatment at a hospital and told the doctor his wound\r\n             resulted from a dirt bike accident.\r\n          6. Recordings of voicemail messages Hawes' wife left on his cell phone\r\n             and numerous arguments and conversations between them.1\r\n          7. The testimony of Brittany Roundtree, Hawes' stepdaughter and his\r\n             wife's daughter, that Hawes and her mother argued a lot after her\r\n             mother discovered him cheating on her. She said Hawes was the\r\n             primary instigator of violence in the relationship and he \"sometimes\"\r\n             \"put his hand on\" her mother.\r\n          8. The testimony of an expert in forensic psychiatry that Hawes\r\n             described a history of mutual violence, \"that he had certainly abused\r\n             [his wife] in the past and she had also physically abused him in the\r\n             past.\"\r\n\r\nAfter weighing the evidence, the circuit court found Hawes satisfied the\r\nrequirements of section 16-25-90 and granted him early parole eligibility.\r\n\r\n    II.   The State's Issue on Appeal\r\n\r\nWe address three issues on appeal: (1) the circuit court used the wrong definition\r\nof \"a history\" of CDV under section 16-25-90; (2) the court erroneously\r\ndetermined it was required to find Hawes presented a history of CDV based solely\r\non his wife's 1996 CDV conviction and 2006 CDV indictment; and (3) the\r\nlegislature did not intend section 16-25-90 to reduce an inmate's sentence when the\r\nCDV evidence presented demonstrated mutual domestic violence in which the\r\ninmate was the aggressor and primary instigator of the domestic violence.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether these issues are properly preserved and presented to this\r\ncourt. At the sentencing hearing, the State made arguments related to issues one\r\n\r\n1 In the recordings, Hawes' wife threatened to kill him and his girlfriend numerous\r\ntimes. However, we agree with the circuit court that the recordings are not\r\nevidence of CDV because the recordings do not indicate she had \"apparent present\r\nability[,] under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril[,]\" \"to\r\ncause physical harm or injury\" to Hawes. S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-20(A)(2) (Supp.\r\n2011). Nevertheless, the recordings aid in understanding the nature of the\r\nrelationship between Hawes and his wife, which is relevant to determining whether\r\nsection 16-25-90 should apply.\r\n\nand three, and the court addressed both points in its order. As to issue two, Hawes\r\nargued that his wife's CDV conviction and indictment alone were sufficient to\r\nprove a history of CDV under section 16-25-90. The State argued in response that\r\nthe statute required \"a pattern of domestic violence,\" presumably meaning more\r\nthan one or two incidents. Because they are not clearly unpreserved, we address\r\nthe merits of the issues. Cf. Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC v. Lewis, Op.\r\nNo. 27044 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 16, 2012) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 15,\r\n21) (\"While it may be good practice for us to reach the merits of an issue when\r\nerror preservation is doubtful, we should follow our longstanding precedent and\r\nresolve the issue on preservation grounds when it clearly is unpreserved.\").\r\n\r\nAs to the merits of the State's appeal, we find the State has shown no error of law.\r\nAs we will explain, there is evidence in the record to support the circuit court's\r\nfactual findings. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm. See State v.\r\nBlackwell-Selim, 392 S.C. 1, 3, 707 S.E.2d 426, 427-28 (2011) (per curiam)\r\n(stating on appeal from an early parole eligibility determination under section 16-\r\n25-90 that an appellate court may \"not reevaluate the facts based on its own view\r\nof the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial\r\njudge's ruling is supported by any evidence\" and is \"bound by factual findings of\r\nthe trial court unless an abuse of discretion is shown\").\r\n\r\n   III.   The Definition of \"a history\" Under Section 16-25-90\r\n\r\nThe State argues the circuit court used the wrong definition of the term \"a history\"\r\nof CDV in section 16-25-90. Because the statute does not define the term, the\r\nState asserts the definition should be determined based on legislative intent. In its\r\nbrief, the State maintains the \"clear legislative intent of section 16-25-90 is to\r\nprovide mitigation of the sentence of someone who committed an offense against\r\ntheir household member after suffering domestic violence at the hands of the\r\nvictim.\" The State argues the court did not consider the legislative intent of section\r\n16-25-90 but rather found the requirement to prove \"a history\" of CDV satisfied by\r\none or two documented CDV incidents. We disagree with the State's interpretation\r\nof the circuit court's definition of the term \"a history.\"\r\n\r\nThe circuit court specifically provided a definition of a history in its order which\r\nthe State does not argue is incorrect on appeal. The court defined a history as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n             For purposes of the case before me, the court interprets\r\n             reference to \"a history\" to connote not only consideration\r\n             of the number of prior instances of domestic violence,\r\n             but also the relative severity of the various instances. In\r\n             this way, the court may properly weigh the relative\r\n             egregiousness of the conduct. Put another way, more\r\n             serious or violent instances of criminal domestic violence\r\n             would be entitled to substantially more consideration,\r\n             even though fewer in number, than less egregious, but\r\n             more frequent instances.\r\n\r\nThe State did not challenge the circuit court's definition of a history in a motion to\r\nreconsider. On appeal, the State offered no definition in its brief. At oral\r\nargument, the State argued the definition of a history under section 16-25-90 was a\r\n\"circumstance in which an individual is repeatedly the victim and not repeatedly\r\nthe primary instigator of a series of violence—criminal domestic violence—at the\r\nhands of the victim.\" While we neither adopt nor reject the definition of a history\r\nused by the circuit court, nor that proposed by the State at oral argument,2 we\r\ndisagree with the State's assertion that the circuit court failed to consider the\r\nlegislative intent behind section 16-25-90 to reach its definition of a history.\r\n\r\nWe find the circuit court specifically considered the legislative intent behind\r\nsection 16-25-90 both in determining the definition it used for a history of CDV\r\nand in determining whether Hawes satisfied that definition. The court stated the\r\nlegislative intent behind section 16-25-90 is \"to permit some middle ground for\r\nthose instances where there would be insufficient evidence of abuse to maintain a\r\ndefense under [Battered Spouse's Syndrome in section] 17-23-170, but where\r\nsufficient evidence of abuse may exist to mitigate somewhat the usual non-parole\r\nnature of a homicide sentence.\" In some future case, this court or the supreme court\r\nmay be required to specifically define \"a history\" to resolve the controversy before\r\nthe court. In this case, however, defining the term is not necessary because we find\r\nthe circuit court did precisely what the State contends it failed to do—it considered\r\nthe legislative intent of section 16-25-90. We find no error.\r\n\r\n\r\n2We do reject the definition of a history argued by Hawes—that one incident of\r\nCDV by the victim against the defendant automatically entitles the defendant to\r\nearly parole eligibility, with no discretion to be exercised by the circuit court.\r\nHowever, the circuit court did not employ this definition.\r\n\n   IV.\t   Whether the Circuit Court Erred in Determining it was Required to\r\n          Find Hawes Satisfied Section 16-25-90\r\n\r\nThe State argues the circuit court incorrectly determined it was compelled to find\r\nHawes proved a history of CDV based solely on evidence of his wife's 1996 CDV\r\nconviction and 2006 CDV indictment. The State asserts this error is found in the\r\nfollowing passage at the conclusion of the court's order:\r\n\r\n             This court is called upon to make a ruling based solely on\r\n             the evidence and the applicable law. That the victim and\r\n             defendant argued and fought is not, in and of itself,\r\n             sufficient to warrant application of the section. Coupled,\r\n             however, with the documented convictions for CDV and\r\n             the other competent evidence of a mutually violent\r\n             relationship, and despite (or perhaps because of) the\r\n             statute's peculiarities as explained . . . , this court is\r\n             compelled to find that [Hawes] has met his burden.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). The State interprets the phrase \"is compelled\" to mean that once\r\nthe court was presented with Hawes' wife's 1996 CDV conviction and 2006 CDV\r\nindictment, it felt it must find Hawes entitled to application of section 16-25-90.\r\nTherefore, the State argues the trial court abused its discretion by failing to use its\r\ndiscretion in applying the definition of a history of CDV to the facts of this case.\r\nWe disagree with the State's interpretation of the circuit court's order.\r\n\r\nThe court discussed evidence it found weighed in favor of and against the\r\napplication of section 16-25-90. The court found evidence relating to Hawes being\r\nthe primary instigator and to the remote 1996 CDV cross-warrant incident weighed\r\nagainst application. The court also found the 1996 CDV conviction, the 2006\r\nCDV indictment, and the psychiatrist's report were evidence that weighed in favor\r\nof application. Because the circuit court considered each factor the State contends\r\nit should have considered, we find the court did exercise its discretion in applying\r\nthe statute.\r\n\r\nThe State's argument is essentially that it disagrees with the discretionary decision\r\nof the circuit court. However, in an appeal from a parole eligibility determination\r\nunder section 16-25-90, we are not permitted to reverse the circuit court's factual\r\nfindings when there is evidence to support them. Blackwell-Selim, 392 S.C. at 3,\r\n\n707 S.E.2d at 427-28. We find evidence to support the circuit court's ruling that\r\nHawes proved a history of CDV under section 16-25-90.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we believe the State's insistence on arguing that the circuit court felt\r\ncompelled to grant Hawes early parole eligibility is based upon the circuit court's\r\nincorrect citation to a prior version of section 16-25-90. Prior to 2004, section 16-\r\n25-90 provided that an inmate \"shall be eligible\" for early parole eligibility if he\r\nproves a history of CDV suffered at the hands of the victim. (emphasis added). In\r\n2003, the statute was amended to state \"is eligible.\" 2003 S.C. Acts 1546, 1552\r\n(stating the \"act takes effect January 1, 2004, and applies to all offenses occurring\r\non or after that date\") (emphasis added). The circuit court incorrectly quoted the\r\n\"shall be eligible\" version of the statute in its order, and emphasized the language\r\nin making its decision. The circuit court wrote \"use of the word 'shall' in the\r\nstatute notes mandatory, not precatory, language so that, if the court were to find a\r\ncredible history of domestic violence suffered at the hands of the victim, the court\r\nis required to authorize the application of the statute.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, neither party brought the mistake to the circuit court's attention, nor did\r\nthe parties even recognize the error in their briefs to this court. We cannot\r\ndiscount the significance of the circuit court's use of the incorrect version of the\r\nstatute. However, because the mistake was not raised to the circuit court, it was\r\nnever given the opportunity to correct itself, and the error \"clearly is unpreserved\"\r\nfor our review on appeal. Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC, (Shearouse\r\nAdv. Sh. No. 17 at 21).\r\n\r\n    V.    Evidence of Mutual Domestic Violence\r\n\r\nFinally, the State argues the legislature did not intend for section 16-25-90 to apply\r\nto someone like Hawes, whose evidence for application of the statute shows\r\nmutual domestic violence in which he was the aggressor as to most of the domestic\r\nviolence. One witness testified that Hawes was the primary instigator of the\r\nviolence. We agree that there was mutual violence between Hawes and his wife\r\nand that this evidence weighs against application of the section. However, that fact\r\ndoes not automatically preclude Hawes from obtaining relief under section 16-25-\r\n90. Rather, the mutual nature of the violence is one factor the court should\r\nconsider in exercising its discretion to decide whether the defendant has proven a\r\nhistory of CDV such that he is entitled to early parole eligibility.\r\n\nThe circuit court in this case did consider the mutual nature of the violence. The\r\ncourt specifically stated \"that the statute makes no allowance or exception for\r\ncross-warrant situations in which both husband and wife are charged and convicted\r\nout of the same incident.\" Nevertheless, the court proceeded to \"find it proper for\r\nthe court to consider such circumstances in weighing the evidence presented.\" The\r\ncourt found Hawes and his wife's 1996 CDV convictions involved \"a cross-warrant\r\nincident,\" \"that there were times when both parties were primarily responsible for\r\ninstigating the arguments,\" and \"this is a close case . . . [c]ertainly, [Hawes] was\r\nalso responsible for several instances of domestic violence against his wife.\" After\r\nweighing this evidence that the State asserts the circuit court should consider, the\r\ncourt found Hawes proved a history of CDV suffered at the hands of his wife by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence. We find evidence to support the circuit court's\r\ndecision and no error of law.\r\n\r\n   VI.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find the circuit court acted within its discretion in granting early parole\r\neligibility to Hawes pursuant to section 16-25-90.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5002","title":"State v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J: Otis Lamar Bland appeals his convictions for attempted armed\r\nrobbery, attempted burglary, and possession of a weapon during the commission of\r\na violent crime. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuring the late afternoon or early evening of February 23, 2009, Joan Hughes was\r\nat her mother's home in Greenwood, South Carolina. Someone knocked on the\r\ndoor and Hughes answered. A short, thin man whom Hughes recognized only by\r\nsight offered to rake leaves. Hughes closed the door to ask her mother if she\r\nwanted leaves raked, and her mother instructed Hughes to ask the man if he was\r\n\"Otis' son.\" Hughes went back to the door to ask the question. From the corner of\r\nher eye, she saw another man come from behind her mother's car. The second man\r\nran toward her, waving a gun, and Hughes shut the door. Hughes was able to give\r\nonly a general description of his build and clothing. Hughes had to struggle to\r\nclose the door and did not know which of the two men attempted to prevent her\r\nfrom doing so.\r\n\r\nAround 8:00 p.m. that same day, Isabel Martin, upon arriving at her home, was\r\napproached by two men as she exited her car. One of them, who wore a bandanna\r\nacross his face, stuck a gun to her temple and demanded her pocketbook. Martin\r\nobeyed and made eye contact with her assailant when she handed him her\r\npocketbook. Because the streetlight was shining, Martin could see her assailant\r\nand remembered his build and eyes, as well as certain mannerisms. The other man,\r\nwhom Martin described as shorter and heavier than the man who took her\r\npocketbook, was farther away from her.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, Greenwood County Sheriff's Deputy Mitchell Mathis went to\r\nthe area where the incidents took place to assist with the bloodhound team. His\r\nrole was to stop and identify people entering or leaving the area on foot or by car.\r\nAlthough there was little foot traffic, Martin observed two individuals, later\r\nidentified as Bland and James Ware, walking together. Mathis informed Detective\r\nChristopher Haden about his observation of Bland and Ware. Several\r\nneighborhood residents also reported to Haden that they had seen Bland in the area\r\nwith two other persons.\r\n\r\nHaden encountered Bland the next day, and Bland agreed to come to the Sheriff's\r\nOffice to speak further. Eventually, after receiving Miranda warnings, Bland gave\r\nan oral tape-recorded statement and a signed written statement. In the written\r\nstatement, Bland admitted the following: he, Ware, and Kiersten Martin1 went to\r\n\r\n1The record does not indicate that Kiersten Martin was related to Victim Isabel\r\nMartin.\r\n\nthe home of Hughes' mother. There, he remained in the backyard while Ware went\r\nto the door to offer to do yard work. When Hughes asked Ware if he was Otis' son,\r\nWare unsuccessfully tried to force his way into the house, but Hughes slammed the\r\ndoor shut quickly enough to prevent him from doing so. Ware and Kiersten Martin\r\nthen said they would \"try a nother one\" [sic], but he did not accompany them when\r\nthey robbed Isabel Martin.\r\n\r\nThe following day, James Ware and Kiersten Martin gave statements to Haden.\r\nBased on this information, Haden obtained arrest warrants for Bland, Ware, and\r\nKiersten Martin.\r\n\r\nA few days after the incident, the Sheriff's Office showed Hughes a photo lineup in\r\norder to determine whether she could identify either the person at the door or the\r\nperson running from behind her mother's car. Hughes could not identify either\r\nindividual in the lineup because of the poor quality of the images.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Bland was indicted on two counts of possession of a weapon during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime. During the same term, the grand jury also\r\nindicted him for armed robbery of Isabel Martin, attempted burglary of the home\r\nof Hughes' mother, and attempted armed robbery of Hughes. The indictment for\r\nattempted burglary was nol prossed, but was replaced by another indictment on\r\nMarch 26, 2010, for attempted first-degree burglary.\r\n\r\nA jury trial on all charges took place on May 18, 2010. Both Ware and Kiersten\r\nMartin appeared as witnesses for the State. Ware testified that after he knocked on\r\nthe door of the house of Hughes' mother, Bland \"came around with the gun and the\r\nlady had shut the door.\" Ware also testified that Bland took Isabel Martin's\r\npocketbook after pointing a gun at her. Kiersten Martin testified about the\r\npremeditated nature of the attempt to force entry into the home of Hughes' mother\r\nand corroborated Ware's testimony that Bland approached Isabel Martin with a gun\r\nand took her pocketbook.\r\n\r\nHaden testified Hughes was shown a photo lineup and admitted the lineup was\r\nnow missing from the case file. Although he did not know whether Bland's picture\r\nwas included in the lineup, he also testified that Hughes never said she would have\r\nbeen able to identify the person with the gun and could provide only a general\r\ndescription of him. Hughes corroborated this testimony, stating only that this\r\nperson wore dark clothing, was tall and thin, and carried a large gun. On cross-\r\nexamination, Hughes asserted she did not know whether any of the subjects\r\n\ndepicted in the photo lineup could have been Bland. Martin, who was not shown a\r\nphoto lineup, pointed Bland out to the jury.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the testimony, the defense made various directed verdict motions\r\nand requested to have the charges against Bland dismissed because of the missing\r\nlineup. The trial court denied these motions.\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Bland on one count of possession of a weapon during the\r\ncommission of a violent crime, attempted armed robbery, and attempted first-\r\ndegree burglary. Hughes was the prosecution's main witness for these three\r\ncharges. Bland was acquitted of the armed robbery charge and the remaining\r\ncount of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, both of\r\nwhich involved Isabel Martin. The trial court sentenced Bland to concurrent terms\r\nof twenty years on the attempted armed robbery and attempted first-degree\r\nburglary charges and a consecutive five-year sentence on the weapons charge.\r\nBland then filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in refusing to dismiss the charges against Bland on the\r\ngrounds that the State mishandled the photo lineup and the possibility that the\r\nlineup contained exculpatory information favorable to Bland's defense at trial?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). The reviewing court is\r\nbound by the trial court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBland argues the charges against him should have been dismissed because the\r\nState's inability to produce the photo lineup amounted to a due process violation\r\nthat deprived him of his right to present a complete defense. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has stated the following on the issue of\r\npreservation of evidence:\r\n\r\n             The State does not have an absolute duty to preserve\r\n             potentially useful evidence that might exonerate a\r\n             defendant. To establish a due process violation, a\r\n\n             defendant must demonstrate (1) that the State destroyed\r\n             the evidence in bad faith, or (2) that the evidence\r\n             possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the\r\n             evidence was destroyed and the defendant cannot obtain\r\n             other evidence of comparable value by other means.\r\n\r\nState v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 538-39, 552 S.E.2d 300, 307 (2001) (citations\r\nomitted) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHere, Bland made no attempt to argue the State destroyed the lineup in bad faith.\r\nThe question before us, then, is whether Bland demonstrated (1) the lineup\r\npossessed an exculpatory value apparent before it was lost and (2) he could not\r\nobtain other evidence of comparable value by other means. Unless he satisfied\r\nboth requirements of the second prong, he failed to establish a due process\r\nviolation.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the State that Bland failed to establish that the lineup possessed an\r\nexculpatory value that was apparent before it was lost. At trial, Haden testified he\r\ndid not know who compiled the photographs for the lineup and no one knew whose\r\nimages were included.2 More important, however, is Hughes' testimony that the\r\npoor quality of the photographs prevented her from identifying anyone in the\r\nlineup as either of the two individuals she encountered during the incident even\r\nthough she had indicated she might have been able to identify the person with\r\nwhom she spoke at her mother's door. She testified that in her haste to close the\r\ndoor, all she noticed about the other man was his clothing, his build, and his gun.\r\nWhen asked by Bland if \"his picture was one of those on that piece of paper,\" she\r\nresponded that she did not know. Whether or not the missing layout included\r\nBland's picture, when considered with Hughes' undisputed inability to make a\r\npositive identification of anyone involved in the attempted burglary either before\r\nor during trial, it was not exculpatory evidence. Cf. Porter v. State, 368 S.C. 378,\r\n384, 629 S.E. 2d 353, 357 (2006) (holding the fact that a witness did not identify\r\n\r\n2 At trial, Bland suggested he should not be penalized for the State's inability to\r\nverify whether or not a picture of him was included in the lineup, arguing \"it wasn't\r\nhis job to keep up with this evidence.\" We do not suggest here that a defendant\r\nseeking to show a due process violation through the State's loss of evidence should\r\nbe required to present information available only from the State if the State cannot\r\nprovide it. Rather, we hold that regardless of whether Bland's picture appeared in\r\nthe lineup, the circumstances of this case are such that the lineup did not have\r\nexculpatory value.\r\n\nthe defendant at the crime scene was not material exculpatory evidence in view of\r\nother evidence of his guilt); Clark v. State, 315 S.C. 385, 388, 434 S.E.2d 266, 268\r\n(1993) (\"[E]xculpatory evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability\r\nthat, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding\r\nwould have been different.\").\r\n\r\nThe State further argues that Bland did not establish that he could not have\r\nobtained other evidence of comparable value and that any error resulting from the\r\nloss of the photographic lineup was harmless in view of other evidence presented.\r\nBecause, however, our holding that Bland failed to demonstrate that the lineup had\r\nexculpatory value is sufficient to uphold his convictions, we decline to address\r\nthese arguments.

The notice to creditors of the\r\nestate ran in the Anderson News-Chronicle on February 19 and 26, 2003, and\r\nMarch 5, 2003. On December 8, 2003, Barnett's daughter, Quick, filed two\r\nstatements of creditor's claim with the probate court. In the statements, she\r\nasserted Barnett took funds belonging to Quick under the UGMA without notifying\r\nher and failed to provide her with the funds that were being held on her behalf.\r\nShe submitted copies of two cancelled checks from a UGMA account with A.G.\r\nEdwards & Sons. The checks were in the amounts of $107.29 and $41,646.27.\r\nQuick subsequently filed a petition for claim under the UGMA with the probate\r\ncourt. She claimed Barnett made a gift to her under the UGMA and then converted\r\nthe money for his own use on two occasions. In his answer to the petition, Phillips,\r\nwho was the successive personal representative of Barnett's estate, asserted, among\r\nother defenses, Quick's claim was not timely filed and was time barred.\r\n\r\nThe probate court rejected Phillips's contention that Quick's claims were barred\r\nbecause she failed to file her claim within the eight-month period prescribed by\r\nsections 62-3-801 and 62-3-803 of the South Carolina Probate Code (2009). The\r\nprobate court noted Quick testified she had no notice or knowledge of the UGMA\r\naccount until she became personal representative of Barnett's estate and learned of\r\nthe account during discovery for litigation contesting Barnett's will in December,\r\n2003. Her mother testified she had never told Quick about the account that Barnett\r\nset up pursuant to their divorce decree. The probate court applied the discovery\r\nrule and found that because Quick had no notice or knowledge of the claim prior to\r\ndiscovering it in December 2003, her claim was not barred by section 62-3-803.\r\nThe court approved Quick's UGMA claim, but denied her request for interest.\r\nPhillips filed a motion to alter or amend, which the probate court denied. He then\r\nappealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the probate court. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   S.C.

Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274, 617 S.E.2d 135, 137 (Ct. App. 2005). \"Questions of\r\nlaw . . . may be decided with no particular deference to the lower court.\" Neely v.\r\nThomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 350, 618 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2005).\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nPhillips argues Quick's claims are barred by the time limitation set forth in sections\r\n62-3-801(a) and 62-3-803(a) of the South Carolina Probate Code (2009) because\r\nsection 62-3-803 is a nonclaim statute.2 We agree.\r\n\r\n      Section 62-3-803(a) provides:\r\n\r\n             All claims against a decedent's estate which arose before\r\n             the death of the decedent, including claims of the State\r\n             and any subdivision thereof, whether due or to become\r\n             due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,\r\n             founded on contract, tort, or other legal basis, if not\r\n             barred earlier by other statute of limitations, are barred\r\n             against the estate, the personal representative, and the\r\n             heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented\r\n             within the earlier of the following dates:\r\n\r\n             (1) one year after the decedent's death; or\r\n\r\n             (2) within the time provided by Section 62-3-801(b) for\r\n             creditors who are given actual notice, and within the time\r\n             provided in Section 62-3-801(a) for all creditors barred\r\n             by publication . . . .\r\n\r\nSection 62-3-801(a) mandates that creditors who are not given actual notice must\r\npresent their claims within eight months after the date of the first publication of the\r\nnotice or be forever barred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2At oral argument, both parties acknowledged this issue had been raised to the\r\nprobate court. Despite the paucity of the record, we will review the issue on the\r\nmerits.\r\n\nThis court held Section 62-3-803 is a nonclaim statute. In re Estate of Tollison,\r\n320 S.C. 132, 135, 463 S.E.2d 611, 613 (Ct. App. 1995). Thus, unless the statute\r\nis complied with, the creditor's claim is barred. Id. The Indiana Supreme Court\r\nexplained the difference between a nonclaim statute and a statute of limitations:\r\n\r\n             [A] nonclaim statute . . . grants to every person having a\r\n             claim of any kind or character against a decedent's estate,\r\n             the right to file the same in the court having jurisdiction\r\n             thereof and have the same adjudicated, provided such\r\n             claim is filed within the time specified in the statute.\r\n             Unless such claim is filed within the time so allowed by\r\n             the statute, it is forever barred. The time element is a\r\n             built-in condition of the said statute and is of the essence\r\n             of the right of action. Unless the claim is filed within the\r\n             prescribed time set out in the statute, no enforceable right\r\n             of action is created.\r\n\r\n             While such statutes limit the time in which a claim may\r\n             be filed or an action brought, they have nothing in\r\n             common with and are not to be confused with general\r\n             statutes of limitation. The former creates a right of action\r\n             if commenced within the time prescribed by the statute,\r\n             whereas the latter creates a defense to an action brought\r\n             after the expiration of the time allowed by law for the\r\n             bringing of such an action.\r\n\r\nEstate of Decker v. Farm Credit Servs. of Mid-Am., ACA, 684 N.E.2d 1137, 1138-\r\n39 (Ind. 1997) (quoting Donnella v. Crady, 185 N.E.2d 623, 624-25 (Ind. App.\r\n1962)).\r\n\r\n\"While equitable principles may extend the time for commencing an action under\r\nstatutes of limitation, nonclaim statutes impose a condition precedent to the\r\nenforcement of a right of action and are not subject to equitable exceptions.\"\r\nEstate of Decker, 684 N.E.2d at 1139; see also 51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitation of\r\nActions § 3 (2011) (\"The time element is a built-in condition of a nonclaim statute\r\nand is of the essence of the right of action, and unless the claim is filed within the\r\nprescribed time set out in the statute, no enforceable right of action is created.\").\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the probate court relied on the discovery rule found in section\r\n15-3-535 of the South Carolina Code (2005), which provides:\r\n\n             Except as to actions initiated under Section 15-3-545, all\r\n             actions initiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be\r\n             commenced within three years after the person knew or\r\n             by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have\r\n             known that he had a cause of action.\r\n\r\nThis rule, however, does not apply to all causes of actions.

App. 1991).\r\n\r\nThe Washington Supreme Court declined to apply the discovery rule to a probate\r\nnonclaim statute that was silent regarding the discovery rule. Ruth v. Dight, 453\r\nP.2d 631, 636 (Wash. 1969) (superseded by statute as stated in Teeter v. Lawson,\r\n610 P.2d 925, 925 (Wash. Ct. App. 1980)). The court held: \"The nonclaim statute\r\nis mandatory and not subject to enlargement by interpretation; and it cannot be\r\nwaived.\" Id. at 637.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas Court of Appeals likewise rejected a claimant's argument the discovery\r\nrule should apply to the Kansas statute similar to our section 62-3-803, K.S.A. 59-\r\n2239. In re Estate of Watson, 896 P.2d 401, 404 (Kan. Ct. App. 1995). It\r\nexplained:   Because the Kansas Legislature specifically created a\r\n             statutory discovery rule under the provisions of K.S.A.\r\n             60-513, the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio\r\n             alterious (the inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion\r\n             of another) suggests that the legislature did not intend for\r\n             the same discovery rule to be applicable to probate cases.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nOur section 62-3-803 makes no mention of the discovery rule and no other statute\r\nspecifies the rule applies to the nonclaim statute. Because we find no indication\r\nour legislature intended for the discovery rule to apply to the nonclaim statute, we\r\nconclude this rule does not extend to section 62-3-803.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3In her Respondent's brief, Quick relies on this court's opinion in Kolb v. Cook,\r\n284 S.C. 598, 602, 327 S.E.2d 379, 382 (Ct. App. 1985), in which we held a tort\r\n\nQuick filed her statements of claim more than nine months after the first\r\npublication of notice. Thus, the lower courts erred in holding Quick's claims were\r\nnot barred by section 62-3-803. Accordingly, the order of the circuit court\r\naffirming the probate court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.4\r\n\r\nPIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclaimant seeking to recover damages from sources other than the distributable or\r\ndistributed assets of the probate estate does not need to file a verified claim or\r\naccount with the personal representative of the deceased tortfeasor. Quick asserts\r\nthe funds from the UGMA account were not a distributable asset of the probate\r\nestate because she has a vested title in the proceeds from account and she is\r\nentitled to a constructive trust. While we find this argument intriguing, we decline\r\nto consider it on appeal. See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.

Following a bench trial, the trial\r\njudge found Appellant Susan M. Ard (Wife), the former wife of Richard Todd Ard\r\n(Decedent), was entitled to the face value of the policy with interest, but awarded\r\nthe balance of the death benefit to Respondent Gerald Ray Ard (Father),\r\nDecedent's father. Wife appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nWife and Decedent married on June 14, 1990. On April 17, 1991, State Mutual\r\nissued a whole life insurance policy to Decedent. Decedent was the insured and\r\nnamed Father as the sole beneficiary of the policy. The policy had an initial death\r\nbenefit of $50,000.00, and the death benefit increased over the years.\r\n\r\nDuring their marriage, Wife and Decedent had two children, born in 1996 and\r\n1998. On December 9, 1998, Decedent attempted to change the beneficiary on the\r\npolicy from Father to Wife by signing a policy service request and delivering it to\r\nthe insurance agent who sold him the policy. The agent no longer represented\r\nState Mutual, but witnessed the request and faxed it to State Mutual's office in\r\nRome, Georgia. Nineteen days after receiving the faxed request, State Mutual sent\r\na letter to Decedent advising that an original signature on the original form was\r\nnecessary to process his request to change the beneficiary. State Mutual never\r\nreceived a response to this letter, and Father remained the only named beneficiary\r\non the policy.\r\n\r\nThe policy provided for an annual increase in the death benefit beginning the fifth\r\nyear the policy was in effect. In addition, the policy also participated in company\r\ndividends; therefore, the death benefit would most likely exceed the $50,000.00\r\nguaranteed benefit.\r\n\r\nWife and Decedent divorced in October 2006. The divorce decree incorporated a\r\nsettlement agreement. Under the agreement, Wife was granted custody of the\r\nchildren, and Husband was to pay child support.\r\n\r\nThe agreement included two references to life insurance. The first reference was in\r\nSection VI, which covered medical insurance for the children, the children's\r\nuncovered medical expenses, and life insurance, and provided as follows:\r\n\n             3. Life Insurance: [Decedent] currently has life\r\n             insurance in the amount of $50,000 on his life.\r\n             [Decedent] shall continue such coverage naming [Wife]\r\n             as beneficiary for the benefit of the minor children until\r\n             such time as the youngest child reaches eighteen years of\r\n             age, and shall continue to provide annual proof of said\r\n             insurance to [Wife].\r\n\r\nThe second reference to life insurance in the agreement appeared in Section VII,\r\nwhich covered equitable division and provided as follows:\r\n\r\n             3. Personal Property: [Wife] shall have all right, title\r\n             and interest in and to the Jet Skies [sic]. [Decedent] shall\r\n             have all right, title and interest in and to the following\r\n             personal property: boat and motor; guns, 4-wheeler (with\r\n             trailer), life insurance; lawn mower, and miscellaneous\r\n             tools in back shed.\r\n\r\nDecedent died on March 14, 2008. At the time of his death, the total cash value of\r\nthe policy was $85,521.30.\r\n\r\nFather filed a claim for the proceeds of the policy. Later, Wife filed a competing\r\nclaim and sent State Mutual the divorce decree and the separation agreement\r\nexecuted by her and Decedent. Both Father and Wife sought payment of the entire\r\npolicy proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn light of the competing demands for payment on the policy, State Mutual brought\r\nthis action to interplead the funds. Father and Wife each filed responsive\r\npleadings. Father also brought a cross-claim against Wife, claiming the entire\r\nproceeds of the policy. Likewise, Wife filed a cross-claim against Father seeking a\r\nconstructive trust in her favor on the entire policy proceeds.\r\n\r\nA bench trial in the matter took place, and the trial judge issued an order finding\r\n(1) State Mutual was entitled to interpleader status; (2) the facts and circumstances\r\nof the case, including the agreement incorporated into the divorce decree, gave rise\r\nto the constructive trust for Wife's benefit; (3) the agreement did not necessarily\r\nrequire a change in beneficiary; (4) the agreement only required Decedent to\r\nprovide $50,000.00 in life insurance coverage until the younger child attained his\r\nmajority and to name Wife the beneficiary for the minor children; (5) Wife was\r\n\nentitled to the face value of the policy of $50,000.00 plus interest from March 14,\r\n2008; and (6) Father was entitled to the balance of the policy proceeds over the\r\namount awarded to Wife.1\r\n\r\nWife moved to alter or amend the trial judge's order. After her motion was denied,\r\nshe filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI. Did the trial judge erroneously interpret the provision in the divorce decree under\r\nwhich Decedent was to maintain life insurance for the benefit of his minor\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\nII. Did equitable principles entitle Wife to be treated as the exclusive beneficiary of\r\nthe policy?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"The interpretation of [marital litigation] agreements is a matter of contract law.\"\r\nMiles v. Miles, 393 S.C. 111, 117, 711 S.E.2d 880, 883 (2011) (citing Hardee v.\r\nHardee, 348 S.C. 84, 91-92, 558 S.E.2d 264, 267 (Ct. App. 2001)). \"When an\r\nagreement is clear on its face and unambiguous, 'the court's only function is to\r\ninterpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the\r\nagreement.'\" Id. (quoting Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 295, 543 S.E.2d\r\n271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001)).\r\n\r\nAn action to declare a constructive trust is an equitable matter, and an appellate\r\ncourt may find facts according to its own view of the evidence. Lollis v. Lollis,\r\n291 S.C. 525, 530, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1987). Nevertheless, this standard of\r\nreview \"does not require us to disregard the findings below.\" Cherry v.\r\nThomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Interpretation of the Separation Agreement\r\n\r\nThe trial judge held the agreement required only that Decedent \"provide Fifty\r\nThousand and no/100 . . . Dollars in life insurance coverage 'naming [Wife] as\r\n1 As of April 14, 2010, the date of the bench trial, the total cash value, including\r\nthe guaranteed death benefit, had increased to $87,838.64.\r\n\nbeneficiary for the benefit of the minor children until such time as the youngest\r\nchild reaches eighteen (18) years of age.'\" Wife takes issue with this interpretation,\r\narguing the separation agreement and divorce decree identified the policy and\r\nrequired Decedent to \"continue such coverage.\" We disagree with this argument.\r\n\r\nTaylor v. Taylor, 291 S.C. 261, 263, 353 S.E.2d 156, 157 (Ct. App. 1987) involved\r\na requirement in a separation agreement and divorce decree that the decedent\r\n\"maintain and keep in force\" $90,000.00 \"worth\" of life insurance on his life with\r\nhis son as beneficiary. This court held the requirement did not warrant the\r\nimposition of a trust on the entire proceeds of a life insurance policy on which the\r\nson was not a beneficiary even though that policy was in effect when the parties\r\nnegotiated their agreement. Id. at 264, 353 S.E.2d at 158. Because, however, the\r\nson was the named beneficiary on three other life insurance policies maintained by\r\nthe decedent and had already received proceeds from those policies, this court\r\naffirmed the trial court's decision to impose a trust on the policy at issue, but only\r\nto the extent necessary to ensure the son received a total of $90,000.00 from all\r\nfour policies, explaining: \"The language only requires [the decedent] to maintain\r\n$90,000 'worth' of life insurance with [his son] as beneficiary. The agreement does\r\nnot mention the Aetna policy or the group policy or any similar language tending\r\nto identify a particular policy.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the agreement mentions only that Decedent, at the time the\r\nagreement was executed, had life insurance, with the only description being the\r\namount of coverage. There is no reference to the carrier, the policy number, or the\r\nfact that the policy was a whole life policy rather than a term life policy. Most\r\nsignificantly, the agreement includes no information about the increase in death\r\nbenefits even though the total death benefit had reached $71,908.00 several months\r\nbefore the separation agreement was executed. Moreover, Wife testified that\r\nDecedent was obligated to disclose his financial condition when they negotiated\r\ntheir separation agreement. If, then, she intended to receive the entire proceeds of\r\nthat particular policy, specific identifying information could have been included in\r\nthe agreement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there was no express requirement that Wife and children be the sole\r\nbeneficiaries of the policy, and the divorce decree expressly granted Decedent\r\nownership and control of his life insurance. His right to name the beneficiaries of\r\nhis life insurance policy was subject only to the requirement that Wife, as\r\nbeneficiary on behalf of their children, receive the first $50,000.00 of coverage in\r\nthe event that he died before the younger child reached the age of majority. Once\r\nthis requirement was fulfilled, there was no restriction in either the policy or the\r\n\ndivorce decree preventing him from naming another beneficiary to receive the\r\nbalance of the proceeds. See Glover v. Inv. Life Co. of Am., 312 S.C. 126, 131, 439\r\nS.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding a party could agree to a requirement in a\r\ndivorce decree that he purchase and maintain a life insurance policy on himself\r\nwith his only child as sole beneficiary and thus contract away any existing right to\r\nchange the beneficiary).\r\n\r\nWe find instructive the case of Sparks v. Jackson, 658 S.E.2d 456 (Ga. Ct. App.\r\n2008). In Sparks, as part of a divorce settlement, the decedent agreed to \"maintain\r\nhis current level of life insurance on his life through his employment which at the\r\npresent time [was] $220,000.00,\" with his first wife as the \"irrevocable beneficiary\r\nfor the benefit of the children.\" Id. at 458. Several years later, he designated his\r\nsecond wife as the beneficiary of the policy. After he died, the trial court awarded\r\nthe entire proceeds of the policy to his first wife, and the second wife appealed.\r\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals held the first wife \"had a vested interest\" in the\r\ndecedent's life insurance policies by virtue of the settlement, but was \"limited to\r\nthe amount of insurance the [decedent] agreed to maintain at the time of the\r\nsettlement agreement\" and ordered that the insured's second wife receive the\r\nbalance of the proceeds in excess of $220,000 plus applicable interest. Id. at 460.\r\nSimilarly, the agreement in the present case required Decedent only to maintain a\r\nspecified amount of coverage for a designated beneficiary. Proceeds not included\r\nin this specified amount were therefore properly awarded to Father, the only other\r\nnamed beneficiary on the policy.\r\n\r\nII. Equitable Principles\r\n\r\nWife further argues she is entitled to a constructive trust on the entire proceeds of\r\nthe policy because (1) if Decedent had done what he was supposed to do under the\r\ndivorce decree, Wife would have been the sole beneficiary of the policy and (2)\r\nDecedent's prior unsuccessful attempt to have Wife named as beneficiary was\r\nevidence that he believed Wife would receive the entire proceeds and intended for\r\nher to do so. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe separation agreement and divorce decree did not require Decedent to name\r\nWife as the sole beneficiary of any particular life insurance policy. Furthermore,\r\nthese documents expressly provided that Decedent would retain ownership of his\r\nlife insurance. As the owner, Decedent had the right to designate his beneficiaries,\r\nsubject only to the provision that Wife was to be a beneficiary of $50,000.00 worth\r\nof coverage until his children attained their majority. Contrary to Wife's argument\r\nthat Decedent's unsuccessful attempt in 1998 to make her the beneficiary of his life\r\n\ninsurance policy evidenced his intent that she receive the entire proceeds if he\r\npredeceased her, Decedent's failure to contact State Mutual after it advised him in\r\n1998 that an original signature was necessary to process his request for a change of\r\nbeneficiary could just as easily support a finding that Decedent ultimately did not\r\nintend for Wife to become the sole beneficiary of his whole life insurance policy\r\nand wanted Father to receive any proceeds in which Wife did not have a vested\r\ninterest. Under these circumstances, we hold Wife has not carried her burden to\r\nconvince this court that the trial court erred in declining to hold the constructive\r\ntrust imposed in her favor included the policy proceeds in excess of the face value\r\nplus any applicable interest. See Cherry, 276 S.C. at 525, 280 S.E.2d at 541\r\n(stating that in an appeal of the grant of equitable relief the burden remains on the\r\nappellant to convince the appellate court that the findings of fact by the hearing\r\ntribunal are incorrect).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5005","title":"McCain v.

Buhl, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: In this ecclesiastical dispute wherein church trustees and deacons\r\nof Mount Canaan Baptist Church (Respondents) sought to enjoin G.L. Brightharp\r\nfrom continuing to act as pastor and reinstate Respondents to their former\r\npositions, Brightharp appeals the trial court's order finding him in contempt,\r\narguing the trial court erred in: (1) assuming subject matter jurisdiction; (2)\r\ndeclaring any actions taken by the church null and void, and ordering him to\r\nreinstate Respondents to their former positions as trustees and deacons; and (3)\r\nholding him in contempt of court.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nBrightharp is the pastor of Mount Canaan Baptist Church (the Church) in Trenton,\r\nSouth Carolina. At a joint board meeting of the Church trustees and deacons on\r\nSeptember 11, 2007, attended by Respondents and fourteen other board members,\r\ntwelve members voted to terminate Brightharp's contract as pastor and moved to\r\nhave a vote by the Church conference.1 During the meeting, Brightharp stated \"he\r\nknew nothing\" about discord concerning \"the condition and direction of the\r\n[C]hurch.\" Later that same day, at a Church conference meeting attended by\r\nRespondents and forty-eight Church members, Brightharp stated he did not want to\r\n\"split the Church\" and would resign rather than proceed with the vote before the\r\nChurch conference.2 Respondents accepted Brightharp's resignation and prepared\r\na written settlement agreement and release of all claims for Brightharp to sign.\r\nHowever, eight days later, Brightharp wrote a letter to members of the\r\ncongregation notifying them he had chosen not to resign. Respondents informed\r\n\r\n1 Thomas McCain, a Church trustee, testified a church conference is a meeting of\r\nthe entire Church and is open for every member of the Church to attend. He\r\nfurther said the conference is a business meeting of the Church and is announced in\r\nadvance from the pulpit. Article IV, Section 6(a), of the Church's By-Laws\r\nprovides: \"Should a change be desired on the part of the Pastor or the Church, a\r\n60-day Notice shall be given by either party. It shall require a simple majority vote\r\nof the members present at a regular business meeting to ensure this action; and at\r\nthe close of the sixty day requirement, said action shall be enforced.\"\r\n2 Article IV, Section 6(b), of the Church's By-Laws provides: \"Whenever there is\r\nan involuntary separation of Pastor and Church, the condition of 60 days leave can\r\nbe given to the Pastor, with pay, to seek employment; or either 60 days\r\ncompensation and immediate termination.\" Section 6(c) provides: \"If a Pastor\r\nterminates voluntarily, he is expected to submit a resignation at least 60 days in\r\nadvance of termination.\"\r\n\nBrightharp he could not rescind his resignation and gave him trespass notice,\r\nprohibiting him from utilizing the Church or its property.3 Brightharp continued to\r\nuse the Church's facilities, and on September 23, 2007, announced from the pulpit\r\nthat a Church conference was scheduled for October 9, 2007.\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 2007, Respondents filed a complaint in the Edgefield County Court\r\nof Common Pleas, requesting the court enjoin Brightharp from continuing to act as\r\npastor and enjoin the Church conference scheduled for October 9. However, the\r\nChurch met on October 9, as scheduled. The Church also held a meeting on\r\nOctober 22, 2007. During the October 22 meeting, Church members voted to\r\nreinstate Brightharp as pastor, remove Thomas McCain and Joseph Curry as\r\ntrustees, and silence deacons Nathan Goodwin and James Johnson. After the\r\nmeeting, Brightharp informed McCain he was relieved of his duties effective\r\nimmediately, and after a November 5, 2007, Church meeting, Brightharp told\r\nMcCain he was silenced as a member of the Church.\r\n\r\nBrightharp filed his answer on November 6, 2007, asserting six defenses: (1)\r\nbreach of contract; (2) wrongful arrest; (3) malicious prosecution; (4) abuse of\r\nprocess; (5) defamation of character; and (6) intentional infliction of emotional\r\ndistress.4 Thereafter, on November 20, 2007, Respondents filed an amended\r\ncomplaint, alleging five causes of action: (1) injunction; (2) defamation; (3)\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) conspiracy; and (5) breach of\r\nfiduciary duty.5\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Casey L. Manning held a hearing on the matter on December 13-\r\n14, 2007. Judge Manning issued his order on December 21, 2007, declining to rule\r\non the request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Brightharp from the Church;\r\nordering the reinstatement of Respondents to their positions as trustees and\r\ndeacons; and declaring any actions taken after September 11, 2007, to be null and\r\nvoid. The Honorable R. Knox McMahon held a second hearing on April 23 and\r\n25, 2008, and he issued his order on June 5, 2008. Judge McMahon determined\r\n\r\n3 McCain testified the letter was not approved by the Church's members. At some\r\npoint, Brightharp was arrested for trespassing.\r\n4 Brightharp asserted he was entitled to $1 million in actual damages and $1\r\nmillion in punitive damages.\r\n5 Respondents alleged that Brightharp made false and defamatory statements about\r\nthem, and they are entitled to $1 million in actual damages and $1 million in\r\npunitive damages.\r\n\nthe board members violated the Church's By-Laws by failing to put Brightharp's\r\nresignation before a final Church vote, and Brightharp's removal of Respondents\r\nfrom their Church positions was also in violation of the By-Laws. Therefore,\r\nJudge McMahon ordered that Brightharp shall remain as pastor; Respondents shall\r\nbe reinstated to their former positions; and joint board meetings must be held the\r\nfirst Sunday of every month beginning July 2008. However, on August 12, 2008,\r\nafter a Church conference, Brightharp wrote to McCain, Goodwin, and Johnson,\r\nand informed them they were excluded from Church membership.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2009, Respondents filed a rule to show cause, seeking a finding of\r\ncontempt against Brightharp for his refusal to abide by Judge McMahon's June 5,\r\n2008 order. Judge McMahon held a hearing on April 30, 2009, and issued his\r\norder finding Brightharp in contempt on May 4, 2009. In his order, Judge\r\nMcMahon found the December 21, 2007 and June 5, 2008 orders were the law of\r\nthe case, and Brightharp had not followed either of the orders. Judge McMahon\r\nfurther found the silencing and exclusion of Respondents was unlawful and null\r\nand void because the purpose of both orders was to establish the status quo to\r\nSeptember 11, 2007. Therefore, Judge McMahon found Brightharp was in\r\nviolation of the two orders for failing to reinstate Respondents to their positions\r\nand refusing to allow the joint board meeting scheduled for July 6, 2008 to take\r\nplace pursuant to the June 5 order. Judge McMahon also ordered the Church to\r\nhold four joint board meetings in 2009 on May 5, September 8, November 3, and\r\nDecember 8. Judge McMahon further fined Brightharp $1,000 for his failure to\r\nreinstate Respondents and hold four joint board meetings, and in the future, if\r\nRespondents were not allowed to fully participate in joint board meetings that\r\nBrightharp be fined $1,000 for each meeting. At a Church meeting on May 5,\r\n2009, McCain, Curry, Goodwin, and Johnson were reinstated as members of the\r\nChurch. Sometime thereafter, Respondents filed another rule to show cause\r\nseeking a finding of contempt against Brightharp for his refusal to abide by Judge\r\nMcMahon's May 4, 2009 order. Judge McMahon held a hearing on October 9,\r\n2009, and issued his order on October 14, 2009, finding Brightharp did not\r\nwillfully violate the terms of the June 5, 2008 and May 4, 2009 orders. Therefore,\r\nJudge McMahon did not hold Brightharp in contempt of those orders. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis case began as an action for declaratory relief. \"Whether an action for\r\ndeclaratory relief is legal or equitable in nature depends on the plaintiff's main\r\n\npurpose in bringing the action.\" Williams v. Wilson, 349 S.C. 336, 340, 563 S.E.2d\r\n320, 322 (2002). Respondents' main purpose in bringing this action was to enjoin\r\nBrightharp from continuing to act as pastor and reinstate Respondents to their\r\nformer positions in the church. Therefore, this is an action in equity, and the\r\napplicable standard of review is our own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nBrightharp argues the trial court erred in assuming subject matter jurisdiction in\r\nthis case. We disagree.\r\n\r\nBrightharp asserts civil courts do not have jurisdiction over internal church\r\ndisputes and other ecclesiastical matters; therefore, the trial court did not have\r\njurisdiction to hear this case. He maintains that church decisions about selection,\r\nappointment, supervision, and removal of ministers and persons in positions of\r\ntheological significance are ecclesiastical matters that are beyond the reach of civil\r\ncourts. He further asserts the Church congregation did not remove him, did not\r\naccept his resignation, and did not vote to terminate him as pastor; therefore, the\r\ntrial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.\r\n\r\nRespondents assert the December 21 and June 5 orders are law of the case because\r\nBrightharp did not appeal from them; however, while it is true that Brightharp did\r\nnot appeal the orders, subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time. \"The\r\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.\" Town of Hilton\r\nHead Island v. Godwin, 370 S.C. 221, 223, 634 S.E.2d 59, 60-61 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power a court has to hear cases in the general\r\nclass to which the proceedings in question belong. Altman v. Griffith, 372 S.C.\r\n388, 396 n.2, 642 S.E.2d 619, 623 n.2 (Ct. App. 2007). Courts have limited review\r\nof church matters, and \"[c]hurch disputes may be resolved by the courts only if\r\nresolution can be made without extensive inquiry into religious law.\" Williams v.\r\nWilson, 349 S.C. 336, 340, 563 S.E.2d 320, 322 (2002). \"It is not the function of\r\nthe courts to dictate procedures for a church to follow.\" Id. \"Generally, a civil\r\ncourt has no authority to intervene in cases involving expulsion from church\r\nmembership where there is no question of an invasion of a civil, property or\r\n\ncontract right.\" Bowen v. Green, 275 S.C. 431, 434, 272 S.E.2d 433, 434 (1980).\r\n\"South Carolina case law is in accord with the view that no review of the\r\necclesiastical decision follows absent the infringement of those rights but South\r\nCarolina authorities do not treat the specific issue of membership expulsion.\" Id. at\r\n434, 272 S.E.2d at 434-35.\r\n\r\n\"Religious organizations are generally divided into two groups: (1) congregational\r\nchurches and (2) hierarchical churches.\" Seldon v. Singletary, 284 S.C. 148, 149,\r\n326 S.E.2d 147, 148 (1985). Our supreme court has explained the differences\r\nbetween the two types of churches:\r\n\r\n             A congregational church is an independent organization,\r\n             governed solely within itself, either by a majority of its\r\n             members or by such other local organism as it may have\r\n             instituted for the purpose of ecclesiastical government,\r\n             while a hierarchical church may be defined as one\r\n             organized as a body with other churches having similar\r\n             faith and doctrine with a common ruling convocation or\r\n             ecclesiastical head. . . . Under the congregational form of\r\n             government . . . the local church is not subject to the\r\n             control of any higher ecclesiastical judicature and is self-\r\n             governing in its religious functions.\r\n\r\nId. at 149-50, 326 S.E.2d at 148-49. Our supreme court elaborated on how\r\ncongregational churches function in Williams v. Wilson:\r\n\r\n             The evidence is uncontested that Christian Churches are\r\n             independent congregational churches governed by their\r\n             own congregations. The congregation selects the\r\n             church's trustees and the trustees are always members of\r\n             that church. In a congregational church, the congregation\r\n             is the highest authority.\r\n\r\nWilliams, 349 S.C. at 342, 563 S.E.2d at 323. \"The law is clear that the majority\r\ncontrols the decisions of a congregational church.\" Seldon, 284 S.C. at 151, 326\r\nS.E.2d at 149. In Bowen, our supreme court took judicial notice that, generally,\r\nBaptist churches are governed by their own congregations. Bowen, 275 S.C. at\r\n435, 272 S.E.2d at 435. Therefore, \"the burden [is] on the party departing from the\r\nusual Baptist convention to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that\r\n\nits church had adopted an alternative means of church government and that it was\r\nfollowing the procedure prescribed by that church.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn Morris Street Baptist Church v. Dart, 67 S.C. 338, 343, 45 S.E.2d 753, 754\r\n(1903), a case involving the dismissal of a pastor, our supreme court held the only\r\nquestions it had the power to consider were: (1) whether the congregation met, and\r\n(2) whether the congregation disposed of the defendant as pastor. If the answers\r\nwere in the affirmative, the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case. Id.\r\nIn Williams v. Wilson, 349 S.C. 336, 343, 563 S.E.2d 320, 323 (2002), the court\r\nfound the church's bylaws clearly reserved to the congregation the right to dismiss\r\nthe preacher. Accordingly, the court held the trustees had no authority to dismiss\r\nthe preacher, and the master in equity properly ruled the dismissal was a nullity.\r\nId.\r\n\r\nIn Knotts v. Williams, 319 S.C. 473, 479, 462 S.E.2d 288, 291 (1995), another case\r\ninvolving the dismissal of a pastor, our supreme court held the trial court\r\nimproperly exercised jurisdiction in the matter because there had been no action by\r\nthe congregation in regard to the litigation, neither the congregation nor the church\r\nwas named as a party, and the congregation never approved an agreement to have\r\nthe court determine the percentage vote necessary to terminate its pastor or who\r\nwas eligible to vote. In Pearson v. Church of God, 325 S.C. 45, 53, 478 S.E.2d\r\n849, 853 (1996), our supreme court held it was not proper for this court to\r\n\"determine whether the Church acted consistently with its religious laws and\r\ndoctrines, its system of discipline and administration in revoking [the minister's]\r\nministry. . . . [because that] would be a quintessentially ecclesiastical matter over\r\nwhich a court could not exercise jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bowen court explained the reasoning behind this rule:\r\n\r\n             The premise upon which the foregoing authority is built\r\n             is that the ecclesiastical matter was decided by the duly\r\n             constituted ecclesiastical body having jurisdiction.\r\n             Obviously then, if a decision is reached by some body\r\n             not having ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the matter, then\r\n             the civil court would not be bound by that decision. The\r\n             appropriate remedy, therefore, would not be to impose\r\n             an ecclesiastical dictate of the civil court but would\r\n             rather be to restore the status quo prevailing before the\r\n             unauthorized action. Once determination is made that\r\n\n             the proper ecclesiastical authority has acted in its duly\r\n             constituted manner, no civil review of the substantive\r\n             ecclesiastical matter may take place as this would be\r\n             prohibited by Amendments I and XIV of the Federal\r\n             Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the State\r\n             Constitution.\r\n\r\nId. at 434, 272 S.E.2d at 435 (emphasis added). The Bowen court further explained\r\nthat the appellate court will not determine who shall or shall not be members of a\r\nchurch or dictate procedure for a church to follow. Id. at 435, 272 S.E.2d at 435.\r\nIn these cases, this court's function is to assure that the church itself has spoken: if\r\nit has, this court inquires no further, but if it has not, this court may restore the\r\nstatus quo to enable the church to act. Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nMount Canaan Baptist Church's By-Laws, Article IV, Section 6(a), titled\r\n\"Termination of Pastor,\" provides:\r\n\r\n             Should a change be desired on the part of the Pastor or\r\n             the Church, a 60-day Notice shall be given by either\r\n             party. It shall require a simple majority vote of the\r\n             members present at a regular business meeting to ensure\r\n             this action; and at the close of the sixty day requirement,\r\n             said action shall be enforced.\r\n\r\nMcCain testified that only the Church's congregation can terminate the pastor, not\r\nthe joint board, and if there is no vote of the congregation, the pastor continues in\r\nhis position. Johnson, a Church deacon, also testified this was the church's\r\nprocedure, and there was no vote of the congregation in this case. Here,\r\nBrightharp stated he was resigning as pastor before the Church congregation was\r\ngiven the chance to vote on whether they wanted to terminate him. Thereafter,\r\nBrightharp decided not to resign, and Respondents' attempted to enforce\r\nBrightharp's resignation. Therefore, because the Church congregation did not vote\r\nto dispose of Brightharp as pastor prior to this litigation, we find the trial court had\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction to restore the status quo to September 11 to enable the\r\nChurch to act pursuant to its By-Laws.\r\n\nII.    Reinstatement of Trustees and Deacons\r\n\r\nBrightharp argues the trial court erred in declaring any actions taken by the Church\r\nnull and void and ordering him to reinstate Respondents to their former positions\r\nas trustees and deacons. We disagree.\r\n\r\nBrightharp asserts the Church congregation voted to exclude Respondents from the\r\nChurch; therefore, the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to order\r\nreinstatement or declare the Church's actions null and void.\r\n\r\nThe Mount Canaan Baptist Church's By-Laws state the Board of Trustees is\r\ncomprised of deacons and trustees. Article VI, Section 7, titled \"Removal from the\r\nTrustee Board,\" provides:\r\n\r\n            Any trustee who fails to discharge his duties or is found\r\n            to be inefficient shall first be counseled by the Pastor and\r\n            a committee of Trustees. If he fails to rectify his ways,\r\n            he shall be removed from the Trustee Board by a simple\r\n            majority vote of the Church members present in a regular\r\n            business meeting.\r\n\r\nMcCain testified that this is the procedure established by the Church to remove and\r\nsilence trustees and deacons, and he was not counseled prior to his removal.\r\nJohnson and Goodwin also testified they were not counseled. Because\r\nRespondents were removed without prior notice or counseling by the pastor and a\r\ncommittee of trustees, as required by the Church's By-Laws, we find the trial court\r\nproperly found their dismissals were a nullity.\r\n\r\nIII.   Contempt\r\n\r\nBrightharp argues the trial court erred in holding him in contempt because the\r\ncourt did not have subject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, he asserts he could not\r\ncomply with the court's order because he had no ability to restore Respondents as\r\nmembers of the Church, as the Church congregation holds that authority.\r\n\r\nWe find the court had subject matter jurisdiction to restore the status quo to\r\nSeptember 11 to enable the Church to act pursuant to its By-Laws. However, we\r\nneed not address whether the court erred in holding Brightharp in contempt\r\nbecause he did not appeal from the order finding him in contempt of court. A\r\n\ndecision on contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Ex parte\r\nCannon, 385 S.C. 643, 660, 685 S.E.2d 814, 823 (Ct. App. 2009). A contempt\r\norder is a final order that is immediately appealable. Id. \"It is axiomatic that an\r\nissue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and\r\nruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\" Wilder Corp. v.\r\nWilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998). Therefore, this issue is not\r\npreserved for our review.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5007","title":"Hamilton v.

Jackson, of Senn Legal, LLC, of Charleston, for\r\n            Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Janette Hamilton appeals the trial court's grant of the Charleston\r\nCounty Sheriff's Department's (the Department) directed verdict motion on\r\nHamilton's negligent supervision claim.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Hamilton argues the trial court erred because evidence in the record\r\nexisted showing the Department was grossly negligent in its supervision of an\r\nemployee of the Department who assaulted her. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOfficer Antonio Aiken, former prison guard for the Department, assaulted\r\nHamilton while she was imprisoned with the Department. Subsequently, Officer\r\nAiken pled guilty to sexual misconduct with an inmate and was sentenced to two\r\nyears' imprisonment, suspended upon two years' probation.1 After the assault,\r\nHamilton sued the Department for negligent training and supervision of Officer\r\nAiken.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 2009, a jury trial was held. Hamilton testified she was sorting laundry\r\nin the break room as usual during the late evening of June 19, 2003, when Officer\r\nAiken came into the break room and began joking with her. Hamilton testified\r\nOfficer Aiken then required her to perform oral sex on him twice.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Hamilton's case, the Department moved for a directed verdict on\r\nboth claims. The trial court granted the Department's directed verdict motion on\r\nthe negligent training claim, but denied the Department's motion on the negligent\r\nsupervision claim. After the close of its evidence, the Department again moved for\r\na directed verdict on the negligent supervision claim, and Hamilton also moved for\r\na directed verdict. The trial court granted the Department's motion and denied\r\nHamilton's motion, finding no evidence existed indicating Officer Aiken would\r\ncommit such crimes and Officer Aiken was clearly acting in his own capacity\r\nwhen he engaged in sexual misconduct with Hamilton. Hamilton filed a motion to\r\namend the judgment or to grant a new trial, which the trial court denied. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in granting the Department's motion for a directed verdict on\r\nthe negligent supervision claim?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a directed verdict, the court should consider in favor of the non-\r\nmoving party whether any evidence existed. S.C. Fed. Credit Union v. Higgins,\r\n394 S.C. 189, 193-94, 714 S.E.2d 550, 552 (2011). The court should be concerned\r\nonly with the existence or nonexistence of evidence. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Officer Aiken also pled guilty to two additional indecent exposure charges;\r\nhowever, these charges did not involve Hamilton.\r\n\nAn employer can be liable for negligent supervision of an employee when an\r\n\"employee intentionally harms another\" on the employer's premises and \"[the\r\nemployer] (i) knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control his\r\n[employee], and (ii) knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for\r\nexercising such control.\" Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 116-\r\n17, 420 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1992) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 317\r\n(1965)). \"[A] governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from\r\nresponsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control,\r\nconfinement, or custody of any . . . prisoner, inmate, or client of any governmental\r\nentity, except when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent\r\nmanner.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60 (25) (2005). \"A defendant is guilty of gross\r\nnegligence if he is so indifferent to the consequences of his conduct as not to give\r\nslight care to what he is doing.\" Jackson v. S.C. Dep't of Corrs., 301 S.C. 125,\r\n126, 390 S.E.2d 467, 468 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHamilton argues the trial court erred in granting the Department's motion for a\r\ndirected verdict because abundant evidence existed showing the Department was\r\ngrossly negligent in its supervision of Officer Aiken. Specifically, Hamilton\r\nasserts her expert witness, Dr. George Kirkham, testified that the Department was\r\ngrossly negligent by failing to employ rape prevention measures, maintain the\r\nminimum national security standards, and adopt adequate monitoring policies.\r\nAdditionally, Hamilton argues the Department failed to adequately investigate\r\nOfficer Aiken's background prior to employing him.\r\n\r\nDr. Kirkham, a criminologist, testified the Department was grossly negligent\r\nbecause it \"was in gross violation of what would have been nationally accepted\r\nstandards.\" He explained the Department ignored a foreseeable harm of sexual\r\nassaults against inmates by failing to minimize contact of male officers with\r\nfemale inmates, monitor the officers' whereabouts, and implement adequate\r\nsupervision mechanisms such as cameras and locked doors.\r\n\r\nJohn Gaillard, a retired lieutenant tour commander with the Department, testified\r\nthe door leading to the break room also led to the service hallway. Keith Novak, a\r\nretired chief deputy with the Department, explained they typically did not lock the\r\ndoor during the day because the service hallway was such a highly trafficked area.\r\n\r\nNovak testified the break room had a camera, but explained the camera focused on\r\nthe busy service hallway and entrance to the break room. Michael Tice, an\r\n\nadministrative security lieutenant over the security services at the Department's\r\ndetention center, testified the camera system met the minimum standards required\r\nby the South Carolina Department of Corrections as well as the American\r\nCorrectional Association standards.\r\n\r\nAccording to Major Willis Beatty, the Department did not have any established\r\npolicies concerning the interactions of male guards and female inmates at the time\r\nof the incident. He also stated that the Department complied with the minimum\r\njail standards that were established by the Department of Corrections at that time.\r\nBeatty explained the Department did not have any monitoring system for the\r\nofficers, and they were able to move around the jail as they desired in order for\r\nthem to do their jobs. Both Gaillard and Novak testified they trusted Officer Aiken\r\nbecause they had hired him and he had successfully completed the Department's\r\ntraining. Once the training for guards was completed they were no longer\r\nroutinely supervised. Novak also explained that the Department complied with the\r\njail standards established by the Department of Corrections.\r\n\r\nMajor Patricia Garrison testified that Officer Aiken was trained on the\r\nDepartment's policies on sexual harassment and appropriate interaction with the\r\ninmates. She also stated the Department immediately began investigating the\r\nincident when it learned about it in July 2003 and terminated Officer Aiken\r\nimmediately after the charges were brought against him.\r\n\r\nDana Herron, a human resources employee for the Department, testified she\r\nrecommended Officer Aiken for employment after a pre-employment\r\ninvestigation. However, Herron admitted she received a report from the\r\nCharleston Police Department ten days after she submitted her recommendation to\r\nthe Department. There were two reports from the Charleston Police. One report\r\nconcerned employment as a dispatcher during the summer of 1996 when Officer\r\nAiken was in high school. This report stated the police would \"absolutely not\"\r\nrehire Officer Aiken. At the bottom of this report, the Charleston Police also have\r\na note that Officer Aiken interviewed for a dispatcher position in 2001 and in that\r\nnote stated that Officer Aiken was \"not CPD material-for any position.\" Another\r\nreport from the Charleston Police covered employment by Officer Aiken as a clerk\r\nand also a position in the control room during the summer of 1998. This report\r\nstated that he was a nice young man and \"took his job seriously.\" Herron testified\r\nshe did not reopen her investigation on Officer Aiken after receiving these\r\nadditional reports because she did not believe any \"red flags\" were present in the\r\nprocess. There was no misconduct detailed in either report. Herron explained the\r\nDepartment performed a psychological evaluation on Officer Aiken, which only\r\n\nindicated Officer Aiken had \"a proclivity towards being late and absent more than\r\nthree times in a single year, as well as possibly being terminated prematurely for\r\nwrongdoing.\" Herron testified her investigation showed that Officer Aiken was at\r\na low-risk for performance difficulties.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough Dr. Kirkham testified the Department violated nationally accepted\r\nstandards, the Department provided uncontradicted evidence that it met minimum\r\nsecurity standards set for South Carolina. In addition, there is no evidence the\r\nDepartment knew or should have known of the necessity to exercise additional\r\nsupervision of Officer Aiken to prevent him from harming Hamilton. We find the\r\nonly inference from the evidence is that the Department exercised at least slight\r\ncare in its supervision of Officer Aiken. See Jackson v. S.C. Dep't. of Corrs., 301\r\nS.C. 125, 126, 390 S.E.2d 467, 468 (Ct. App. 1989) (stating to be guilty of gross\r\nnegligence defendant's conduct must not have given slight care to what he was\r\ndoing). Accordingly, the trial court properly granted the Department a directed\r\nverdict on Hamilton's negligent supervision claim.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., dissents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT, J: I respectfully dissent and would reverse the trial court's order granting\r\nthe Department directed verdict on Hamilton's negligent supervision claim. While\r\ngross negligence is defined as the failure to exercise slight care, it is also \"a relative\r\nterm, and means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.\"\r\nSteinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing & Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 395, 520\r\nS.E.2d 142, 153 (1999) (quoting Hollins v. Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist. One, 310 S.C.\r\n486, 490, 427 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1993)). Viewing the evidence and its inferences in\r\nthe light most favorable to Hamilton, I find there was evidence the Department was\r\ngrossly negligent in supervising Aiken. Hamilton presented expert testimony that\r\nthe Department was in gross violation of nationally accepted standards and\r\nprocedures, and the Department failed to exercise even slight care for Hamilton's\r\nsafety. As to the Department's policies permitting male guards to go wherever they\r\nwanted to among female inmates, the expert testified: \"[I]t just combines a\r\nmaximum of opportunity and temptation in an area where we've had problems for\r\n\nso many years. It's shocking that something like this could still exist.\" Hamilton\r\nalso presented evidence by the retired Department commander that the\r\ncircumstances caused concern, and the Department violated its own policies.\r\nBecause I believe Hamilton's negligent supervision claim should have gone to the\r\njury, I would reverse.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5008","title":"Stephens v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts\r\n\r\nCSX maintains a railroad track in Hampton County. As the track passes through\r\nthe town of Yemassee, it runs parallel to state Highway 68 and crosses Hill Road, a\r\ntwo-lane road that terminates at Highway 68 just a few feet from the crossing. The\r\nHill Road crossing is a passive grade crossing, meaning it has no active traffic-\r\ncontrol devices, such as lights or gates. Vehicle traffic is controlled by a stop sign,\r\na stop line, and a cross-buck.1\r\n\r\nIn 2000, CSX started a program to improve sight distances for vehicles\r\napproaching its passive grade crossings in South Carolina by removing vegetation\r\nat the crossings. Several months before this accident, CSX's clear-cutting crew\r\nreached the Hill Road crossing. When the crew attempted to cut down a line of\r\ntrees on land adjacent to the crossing, they encountered Thomas Jackson. Jackson\r\nclaimed he owned the land and CSX had no right to cut down the trees. The crew\r\ndid not cut down the trees. CSX's policy was that in the event of a dispute with a\r\nlandowner, the crew would not remove vegetation until the dispute was resolved.\r\nCSX eventually showed Jackson that it owned a right of way over the land on\r\nwhich the trees were located, and its crew removed them. However, the trees were\r\nstill in place on the day of the accident.\r\n\r\nOn February 3, 2004, as Tonia Colvin drove down Hill Road towards Highway 68,\r\na CSX train approached the crossing from her right. Tonia's boyfriend sat in the\r\n\r\n1A cross-buck is a white, \"X-shaped sign with the words 'Railroad Crossing' in\r\nblack lettering.\" It \"is considered the same as a 'Yield' sign.\" Webb v. CSX\r\nTransp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 644 n.1, 615 S.E.2d 440, 443 n.1 (2005).\r\n\nfront passenger's seat, and her twelve-year old daughter Lillian sat in the back seat.\r\nWhen Tonia reached the crossing, she stopped at the stop sign. She pulled forward\r\nto the stop line and stopped again. Her line of sight in the direction of the train ran\r\nacross the property Jackson claimed he owned. Tonia testified that she did not\r\nhear or see the train before she drove onto the track. As she did so, she heard the\r\ntrain's horn. She tried to get out of the way by accelerating, but the train struck her\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina law requires that a train's horn be sounded continuously from a\r\ndistance of at least 1,500 feet from the road until the engine has crossed it. The\r\ntrain's engineer testified he \"believed\" he blew the horn on time, but the train's\r\nevent recorder showed he did not blow the horn until the engine was 1,161 feet\r\nfrom the crossing. CSX took varying positions on whether it complied with the\r\nrequirement, but eventually stipulated that the data from the event recorder was\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nTonia, her boyfriend, and Lillian were all injured in the accident. Lillian's injuries\r\nwere devastating. She sustained severe brain injuries, requiring that doctors place\r\nher in a medically induced coma and drill a hole in her skull to alleviate pressure\r\non her brain. When Lillian awoke from the coma approximately one month later,\r\nshe could not speak, walk, or feed herself. Her injuries required months of\r\nphysical, occupational, and speech therapy, but even at the time of the trial over\r\nfour years later, she continued to suffer severe intellectual, behavioral, and\r\nphysical impairments.\r\n\r\n      II.    Procedural History\r\n\r\nActing on behalf of Lillian, Stephens sued CSX and the state Department of\r\nTransportation for negligence. Stephens' primary claims of negligence as to CSX\r\nwere that it failed to sound its train's horn far enough in advance of the crossing\r\nand that it failed to remove trees and other vegetation that obstructed Tonia's view\r\nof the track. As to DOT, Stephens claimed it failed to properly inspect the crossing\r\nand installed the stop sign and stop line at improper locations.\r\n\r\nAt trial, after both defendants had presented their evidence, Stephens moved for a\r\npartial directed verdict against CSX. Stephens asked the trial court to hold CSX\r\nbreached its duty of reasonable care and to have the jury decide proximate cause\r\nand damages. The trial court denied the motion. Stephens then presented evidence\r\n\nin reply, including the stipulation with CSX that the data from the train's event\r\nrecorder was accurate. He rested without renewing his motion for directed verdict.\r\n\r\nThe verdict form contained special interrogatories, which first asked whether CSX\r\nor DOT breached its duty of reasonable care. The jury answered both questions\r\n\"No\" and did not answer any of the other questions on the form. Stephens filed a\r\nmotion for JNOV, renewing his request for judgment as a matter of law on CSX's\r\nbreach of duty. He also asked for a new trial on grounds that the trial court\r\nerroneously excluded evidence and erred in charging the jury. The trial court\r\ndenied the motions.\r\n\r\n      III.   Evidentiary Rulings\r\n\r\nStephens sought to admit evidence of two actions taken by CSX after the accident:\r\n(1) CSX removed the trees at the Hill Road crossing that Thomas Jackson claimed\r\nCSX had no right to remove, and (2) CSX removed vegetation planted at a\r\ndifferent location on the railroad right of way, despite opposition by members of a\r\nlocal garden club. In separate rulings, the trial court sustained CSX's objections to\r\ntestimony regarding these actions on the basis that the actions were subsequent\r\nremedial measures and thus inadmissible under Rule 407, SCRE. We affirm both\r\nrulings.     A.    Removal of Trees at the Hill Road Crossing\r\n\r\nOne of Stephens' theories of liability as to CSX was that the trees CSX failed to\r\nremove interfered with the proper sight distance, so that a driver on Hill Road\r\ncould not see an approaching train. Stephens argued that if the trees had not been\r\nthere, or more particularly if CSX had cut the trees before the accident, there\r\nwould have been sufficient sight distance and the crossing would have been\r\nreasonably safe. He claimed that CSX's failure to cut the trees was a breach of its\r\nduty to maintain a reasonably safe crossing. CSX argued in response that the\r\ncrossing was reasonably safe even with the trees. On this point, Stephens\r\npresented testimony from Jackson about CSX's efforts to cut the trees before the\r\naccident. Without objection, Jackson testified he \"rais[ed] hell\" and CSX agreed\r\nnot to cut them. Stephens also attempted to elicit testimony from Jackson that\r\nCSX cut the trees shortly after the accident. The trial court excluded the testimony\r\nof the subsequent measure under Rule 407.\r\n\nRule 407 provides that \"evidence of . . . subsequent [remedial] measures is not\r\nadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.\"\r\nThe central inquiry under Rule 407, therefore, is the purpose for which the\r\nevidence is offered. If the proponent of the evidence offers it for the purpose of\r\nproving negligence or culpable conduct, Rule 407 excludes it. However, the rule\r\nalso provides that it \"does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent\r\nmeasures when offered for another purpose.\" See also Webb, 364 S.C. at 653, 615\r\nS.E.2d at 448 (\"Rule 407 bars the introduction of any change, repair, or precaution\r\nthat under the plaintiff's theory would have made the accident less likely to happen,\r\nunless the evidence is offered for another purpose.\"). Permissible purposes\r\ninclude, as the rule provides, \"proving ownership, control, or feasibility of\r\nprecautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.\"\r\n\r\nAt trial, Stephens argued his purpose for introducing evidence of the tree removal\r\nwas to \"impeach\" CSX's position that the Hill Road crossing was reasonably safe\r\neven with the trees in place. He argued the evidence was admissible because \"[i]f\r\n[the crossing] was safe, it didn't need cutting. The fact that [CSX] came back later\r\nand cut it impeaches their position . . . .\" It is the trial court's responsibility to\r\ndetermine whether the proponent is offering the evidence for the prohibited\r\npurpose of proving negligence or culpable conduct, or is offering it for some other\r\npurpose. Webb requires the trial court to consider Stephens' argument as to his\r\npurpose for offering the evidence in light of his theory of the case, which was that\r\nCSX's duty of reasonable care required it to cut the trees, and therefore the crossing\r\nwas not reasonably safe because CSX was negligent. 364 S.C. at 653, 615 S.E.2d\r\nat 448 (\"Rule 407 bars the introduction of any change, repair, or precaution that\r\nunder the plaintiff's theory would have made the accident less likely to happen . . .\r\n.\" (emphasis added)). The trial court correctly saw past the \"impeachment\" label\r\nStephens put on the evidence and determined that his purpose for admitting the\r\nevidence was to prove that the crossing was not safe because CSX was negligent in\r\nfailing to cut the trees. By offering the evidence to \"impeach\" CSX's position that\r\nthe crossing was safe, Stephens was actually attempting to prove that CSX's\r\nnegligence in failing to cut the trees was the reason the crossing was not safe. The\r\nadmission of the evidence for that purpose is precisely what Rule 407 forbids. The\r\ntrial judge properly excluded the evidence under Rule 407.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Stephens presents a different argument. He now claims his purpose for\r\noffering the evidence was to show that Jackson's opposition to cutting the trees was\r\nnot the reason CSX failed to cut them. He argues that CSX's decision to cut the\r\ntrees after the accident shows that CSX had the right to cut them before the\r\n\naccident, which means Jackson's opposition could not be the reason CSX failed to\r\nact sooner. Stephens thus argues that the purpose of offering the evidence was not\r\nthe prohibited purpose of proving CSX was negligent, but the permitted purpose of\r\nimpeaching the testimony of a CSX witness who testified that it was Jackson's\r\nopposition to the trees being cut that prevented CSX from cutting them beforehand.\r\nHis argument also goes to the \"feasibility of [the] precautionary measure[]\" of\r\ncutting the trees. If Stephens had presented this argument to the trial court, the\r\ncourt might have exercised its discretion to admit the evidence.2 A trial court's\r\nbroad discretion to decide evidence questions would have allowed it to determine\r\nwhether the evidence violated Rule 407 or was legitimately offered for a purpose\r\npermitted under the rule. However, a party \"may not argue one ground on the\r\nadmissibility of evidence at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.\" Pike v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Transp., 332 S.C. 605, 615, 506 S.E.2d 516, 521 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nBecause Stephens did not present this argument to the trial court, the court was not\r\ngiven the opportunity to exercise its discretion as to that argument, and the\r\nargument is not preserved for appeal.\r\n\r\n             B.     Removal of a Garden in Hampton\r\n\r\nStephens also attempted to introduce evidence regarding the removal of vegetation\r\nat a different crossing. Several months after the accident, CSX removed a public\r\ngarden in Hampton that was planted in CSX's right of way near the other crossing.\r\nStephens offered the testimony of two members of a local garden club who\r\nopposed the removal of the garden on the grounds that it did not obstruct sight.\r\nStephens offered the testimony for the purpose of contradicting CSX's position that\r\nits dispute with Jackson caused the delay in removing the trees at the Hill Road\r\n\r\n2 Stephens insists he did present this argument, citing his lawyer's statement at\r\ntrial: \"The fact that [CSX] came back and cut it impeaches their position . . . .\" In\r\ncontext, however, it is clear that the position to which this statement referred was\r\nthe safety of the crossing with the trees in place:\r\n\r\n             in [CSX's] opening statement - - by the opening\r\n             statement saying this crossing was safe, it didn't need\r\n             cutting, is what he said in the opening statement, it was\r\n             only - - it was safe, but we wanted to make it safer. If it\r\n             was safe, it didn't need cutting. The fact that they came\r\n             back later and cut it impeaches their position . . . .\r\n\ncrossing. The trial court excluded the testimony under Rule 407. We find Rule\r\n407 does not exclude this testimony because removing a sight obstruction at a\r\ndifferent crossing was not a \"measure[] . . . which, if taken previously, would have\r\nmade the event less likely to occur.\" Rule 407, SCRE. Thus, by its own terms, the\r\nrule does not apply to this evidence. See Webb, 364 S.C. at 653, 615 S.E.2d at 448\r\n(\"Rule 407 bars the introduction of any change, repair, or precaution that . . . would\r\nhave made the accident less likely to happen . . . .\").\r\n\r\nHowever, we affirm the exclusion of the testimony. First, we question whether it\r\nis relevant. See Rule 402, SCRE (\"Evidence which is not relevant is not\r\nadmissible.\"). The garden club members opposed the removal of the garden on an\r\nentirely different basis than the ownership-based objection Jackson asserted.\r\nSecond, for this reason and because it relates to a collateral matter, even if it is\r\nrelevant the evidence had almost no probative value. See Rule 403, SCRE (stating\r\n\"evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of . . . confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations\r\nof undue delay, [or] waste of time\"). In any event, the exclusion of the evidence\r\ncaused Stephens no prejudice. See Fields v. Reg'l Med'l Ctr. Orangeburg, 363\r\nS.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (holding appellant must show prejudice\r\nfrom admission of evidence to warrant reversal).\r\n\r\n      IV.\t Denial of Motions for Partial Directed Verdict and JNOV Against\r\n           CSX\r\n\r\nStephens argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for partial directed\r\nverdict. We find this issue is not preserved.\r\n\r\nWhen a party moves unsuccessfully for directed verdict at any point during a trial,\r\n\"he must renew that motion at the close of all evidence.\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C.\r\n1, 19, 640 S.E.2d 486, 496 (Ct. App. 2006). \"Otherwise, this court is precluded\r\nfrom reviewing the denial of the motion on appeal.\" 372 S.C. at 20, 640 S.E.2d at\r\n496. Stephens made his motion for partial directed verdict when both defendants\r\nrested, and the trial court denied the motion. Stephens then introduced evidence in\r\nreply. However, he did not renew his directed verdict motion after he presented\r\nthat evidence. Therefore, the denial of his directed verdict motion is not preserved\r\nfor our review.\r\n\r\nAfter the trial, Stephens filed a motion for JNOV and a new trial, raising the same\r\npoints he argued in his directed verdict motion. However, because he had not\r\n\nrenewed his directed verdict motion after presenting evidence in reply, he could\r\nnot obtain JNOV. \"When a party fails to renew a motion for a directed verdict at\r\nthe close of all evidence, he waives his right to move for JNOV.\" Wright, 372 S.C.\r\nat 20, 640 S.E.2d at 496. Therefore, Stephens did not properly present his JNOV\r\nmotion to the trial court, which leaves this issue unpreserved on appeal. See 372\r\nS.C. at 20, 640 S.E.2d at 496-97 (\"Because Craft did not renew his motion for a\r\ndirected verdict at the close of all evidence, there is no JNOV motion to review.\");\r\nsee also Hendrix v. E. Distribution, Inc., 316 S.C. 34, 37, 446 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1994) (\"The rule that a judgment notwithstanding the verdict may not be\r\ngranted unless the moving party moved for a directed verdict at the close of all the\r\nevidence is a strict one.\"), vacated in part on other grounds, 320 S.C. 218, 464\r\nS.E.2d 112 (1995) (per curiam).\r\n\r\nStephens makes several arguments that the rule requiring the renewal of an\r\nunsuccessful directed verdict motion does not apply in the procedural\r\ncircumstances presented in this case. He first argues the rule applies only to a\r\ndirected verdict motion made by a defendant, as it would be \"illogical\" to require a\r\nplaintiff to renew his directed verdict motion after he presents reply evidence. We\r\ndisagree. The facts and procedural circumstances of this case illustrate that the\r\nrule always applies when the question of law addressed in the motion is whether\r\nthe facts yield only one reasonable inference. See Rule 50(a), SCRCP (\"When\r\nupon a trial the case presents only questions of law the judge may direct a\r\nverdict.\"); Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997)\r\n(stating \"when only one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence,\r\nthe question becomes one of law\").\r\n\r\nStephens' argument that he was entitled to partial directed verdict is based\r\nprimarily on section 58-15-910 of the South Carolina Code (1976), which requires\r\nthat a train engine's horn be sounded \"at the distance of at least five hundred yards\r\nfrom the place where the railroad crosses any public highway, street or traveled\r\nplace and be kept . . . whistling until the engine . . . has crossed such highway,\r\nstreet or traveled place.\"3 When Stephens made the motion, he relied on evidence\r\nthat the horn was sounded for a distance of less than 1,500 feet, including the data\r\nfrom the train's event recorder indicating that the horn began sounding 1,161 feet\r\n\r\n3 Alternatively, a \"bell of at least thirty pounds' weight\" may be rung for the same\r\ndistance. Id. Nothing in the record indicates CSX met this alternative\r\nrequirement.\r\n\nfrom the crossing. The event recorder is an electronic device that records data\r\nfrom various systems in the train. Stephens argued its record of when the horn was\r\nsounded should be considered conclusive and thus he was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict that CSX breached its duty of reasonable care. However, in CSX's case-in-\r\nchief, the train's engineer testified as follows:\r\n\r\n             Q: \t   Did you believe that you blew the horn at the\r\n                    whistle post?\r\n\r\n             A: \t   I believe I started at the whistle post.\r\n\r\nThe whistle post was 1,544 feet from the crossing. This testimony by the engineer\r\nappears to create a conflict in the evidence, and if so, the trial court could not have\r\nproperly granted Stephens' motion at that time.\r\n\r\nStephens argues, however, that viewing even this testimony by the engineer in\r\ncontext, there is only one reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence—\r\nthat CSX failed to sound the whistle on time and thus violated section 58-15-910.\r\nWe agree that, taking this statement by the engineer in the context of his entire\r\ntestimony, the inference that he blew the horn on time is a weak one. In the next\r\nquestion to the engineer, CSX's counsel asked, \"the event recorder says you were\r\nshort, right?\" The engineer answered, \"right.\" Counsel also asked whether the\r\nengineer was \"disputing what the event recorder said,\" and the engineer replied,\r\n\"No, I'm not.\" On cross examination, Stephens' counsel asked the engineer if \"we\r\ncan agree that you failed to blow the horn of the locomotive for 1500 feet before\r\nthe crossing as required by the company rule and South Carolina law?\" The\r\nengineer replied, \"According to the event recorder.\"\r\n\r\nThere is other testimony from the engineer, however, that supports the inference he\r\nblew the horn on time. Stephens' counsel read into the record notes a CSX official\r\ntook from a statement the engineer gave him—\"The engineer thought he started at\r\nwhistle post.\" Stephens' next question to the engineer was \"your best memory that\r\nday was that you started that blowing the horn at the whistle post?\" The engineer\r\nstated, \"Right.\" Stephens' counsel cross-examined the engineer using his\r\ndeposition, in which the engineer testified \"[I] believe[ I] started blowing the horn\r\nat the whistle post.\" Explaining his deposition testimony, the engineer testified at\r\ntrial, \"I started at the whistle post, I thought, and I was in the process of blowing\r\ntwo longs, a short, and a long.\"\r\n\nEven as to the engineer's testimony that he was not disputing what the event\r\nrecorder said, there is reason to believe he did not intend to admit violating the\r\nstatute. The engineer testified he did not know how to interpret the recorder's data,\r\nand he never stated whether he agreed or disagreed with what the data indicated.\r\nThe engineer's statement \"[a]ccording to the event recorder\" could be interpreted\r\neither as a concession he did not blow the horn on time or simply as an\r\nacknowledgement of what the event recorder said, not a concession of its accuracy.\r\nWhen Stephens' counsel asked the engineer \"you have testified previously you\r\ndon't contest the event recorder,\" he replied \"I did not.\" The answer can be\r\ninterpreted as stating he does \"contest\" the accuracy of the recorder, or as denying\r\nhe ever said that. While it is possible to draw from the engineer's testimony the\r\ninferences Stephens argues should be drawn, the testimony also supports an\r\ninference that the engineer was simply conceding the existence of the data, which\r\nhe did not understand, but not agreeing to its accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe point of this discussion is not whether the trial court should have granted the\r\nmotion for directed verdict, but whether the issue is preserved. During his\r\npresentation of evidence on reply, Stephens introduced a stipulation with CSX that\r\nthe data from the train's event recorder was accurate.4 If conflicting inferences\r\ncould be drawn from the engineer's testimony at the point when the motion was\r\nmade, the stipulation arguably removed the conflict. Stephens makes this very\r\nargument in his reply brief:\r\n\r\n             After the Appellant's directed verdict motion, and before\r\n             the close of all evidence, the Appellant offered the\r\n             stipulation of CSX as to the accuracy of the event\r\n             recorder on the locomotive. The accuracy of the event\r\n             recorder . . . bolstered . . . the evidence that CSX had not\r\n             complied with [section] 58-15-910.\r\n\r\nThe argument proves our point on preservation. In response to Stephens' motion\r\nfor partial directed verdict, CSX argued the engineer \"believe[s] he did begin\r\nsounding at the whistle post . . . . That is an issue of fact.\" The trial court saw a\r\nconflict in the evidence and stated, \"I am going to deny the directed verdict\r\nmotions to CSX. . . . I think it is a jury issue.\" The stipulation was entered in\r\nevidence after this ruling. By not renewing his motion, Stephens never gave the\r\n\r\n4 The exact language of the stipulation is not known, as Stephens did not include it\r\nin the record on appeal.\r\n\ntrial court an opportunity to consider whether the stipulation eliminated the conflict\r\nthe court saw in the evidence as to this issue. Even if we thought the trial court\r\nwas mistaken as to the ruling it did make, we have no idea how the court would\r\nhave ruled in light of the stipulation. This illustrates the reason for the rule—a\r\nparty must renew his directed verdict motion at the close of all evidence so that the\r\ncourt may decide whether evidence presented after it denied the earlier motion\r\nchanged the evidentiary landscape in such a way that directed verdict has now\r\nbecome appropriate.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we reject Stephens' argument that the rule requiring the renewal\r\nof an unsuccessful motion for directed verdict does not apply to the facts and\r\nprocedural circumstances of this case. See State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, 43 n.4, 626\r\nS.E.2d 898, 900 n.4 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating in a criminal case \"[i]f a defendant\r\npresents evidence after the denial of his directed verdict motion at the close of the\r\nState's case, he must make another directed verdict motion at the close of all\r\nevidence in order to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence\").\r\n\r\nStephens' second argument is that even without the stipulation, he was entitled to a\r\ndirected verdict at the time he made his motion because CSX's counsel admitted in\r\nhis opening statement that the engineer did not begin sounding the horn at the\r\nwhistle post. Even if Stephens is correct about the significance of what CSX's\r\ncounsel said, Stephens' failure to renew his motion still leaves the issue\r\nunpreserved. Moreover, Stephens did not make this argument to the trial court.\r\nWhen Stephens made his motion for partial directed verdict, he never contended\r\nthat counsel's remarks in opening statement constituted a binding admission that\r\nCSX breached its duty. See Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 224-25, 621\r\nS.E.2d 368, 378 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding because appellant did not present to the\r\ntrial court the argument he raised in his appellate brief, the trial court was never\r\ngiven an opportunity to rule upon that argument, and thus the argument was not\r\npreserved for appeal).\r\n\r\nThe trial court's denial of Stephens' motions for directed verdict and JNOV are not\r\npreserved.5\r\n\r\n5 Stephens also appeals the trial court's refusal to grant him partial directed verdict\r\nthat CSX breached its duty of reasonable care by not removing the trees at the\r\ncrossing. For the reasons discussed above regarding preservation, and because the\r\nrecord is full of conflicting evidence on this issue, we affirm the trial court's\r\ndecision.\r\n\n      V.\t    Jury Charge Rulings\r\n\r\nStephens challenges a number of rulings the trial court made in regards to the jury\r\ncharge. Our review of the trial court's jury charge is controlled in the first instance\r\nby the fact that the trial court prepared special interrogatories for the jury to answer\r\nin returning its verdict, and that the jury resolved the case by finding that neither\r\nCSX nor DOT breached its duty of reasonable care. Because the jury's verdict on\r\nthat basis made it unnecessary for the jury to reach the other issues in the case, it is\r\nnot necessary that we address any ruling on the jury charge unless it relates to\r\nbreach of CSX's and DOT's duty of reasonable care. See Cole v. Raut, 378 S.C.\r\n398, 405, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008) (stating an erroneous jury instruction \"is not\r\ngrounds for reversal unless the appellant can show prejudice from the erroneous\r\ninstruction\"); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 390, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000)\r\n(\"[E]ven if the trial court erred in failing to give a requested instruction, the\r\nrequesting party also must show that the error was prejudicial to warrant reversal\r\non appeal.\"). Therefore, we address only those issues on appeal challenging\r\nportions of the charge given, or the refusal to give requested charges, that relate to\r\nCSX and DOT's alleged breach of their duty of reasonable care. Specifically, we\r\nfind it unnecessary to address the issues raised by the dissent regarding the\r\npresumption against impairment and \"Train Time\" charges, as those alleged errors\r\ncould hardly have affected the jury's deliberations over whether CSX or DOT\r\nbreached its duty of reasonable care, and could not possibly have prejudiced\r\nStephens.    A.\t    Rejection of Stephens' Proposed Charges on a Railroad\r\n                    Company's Duties\r\n\r\nStephens argues the trial court erred in rejecting two proposed instructions\r\nconcerning a railroad company's liability for injuries occurring at crossings. In the\r\nfirst, Stephens requested the court charge the jury:\r\n\r\n             A railroad corporation has a duty to maintain its right-of-\r\n             ways and highway railroad grade crossings in a\r\n             reasonabl[y] safe condition. If a railroad corporation\r\n             negligently allows vegetation to grow on its right-of-way\r\n             adjacent to the crossing to such an extent that it obscures\r\n             or obstructs the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle\r\n             using the roadway, it is liable to anyone who is injured in\r\n\n             a collision, if the obstructing vegetation contributed as a\r\n             proximate cause to the collision.\r\n\r\nIn his second proposed instruction, Stephens requested the court charge: \"When\r\nvegetation at a railroad crossing is such that it obstructs a motorist's view of an\r\noncoming on train, the railroad has a duty to exercise added care in the operation . .\r\n. of its train as the train approaches and crosses the crossing.\"\r\n\r\nWe find the instructions the trial court gave adequately addressed the substance of\r\nboth of Stephens' proposed instructions. \"It is not error to refuse a request to\r\ncharge when the substance of the request is included in the general instructions.\"\r\nSee Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 53, 557 S.E.2d 676, 686 (Ct. App. 2001). As to\r\nthe first proposed instruction, the trial court's general instructions fully and\r\naccurately explained the concepts of negligence and proximate cause. The court\r\nalso specifically instructed the jury that \"a railroad corporation has a duty to\r\nmaintain a reasonably safe grade crossing.\" As to the second proposed instruction,\r\nthe court instructed the jury that a railroad company must use \"reasonable and\r\nordinary caution to prevent accidents at [a] crossing, and this degree of care may\r\nbe affected by obstructions which prevent the track from being seen as a train\r\napproaches.\" While this instruction does not specifically refer to \"added care,\" it\r\nexplains that obstructions affect what a railroad must do to comply with its duty of\r\ncare. We do not believe the jury would have understood the charge to mean the\r\npresence of sight obstructions would allow CSX to exercise less care at the\r\ncrossing. In any event, the precise manner in which an obstruction affects the\r\ndegree of care required by a railroad or a driver is a matter for the parties to argue\r\nin closing argument, not one for the trial court to address in its charge. See S.C.\r\nConst. art. V, § 21 (\"Judges shall not charge juries in respect to matters of fact, but\r\nshall declare the law.\"). The trial court committed no error in refusing to give the\r\nrequested instructions.\r\n\r\nStephens argues the trial court's alleged error in refusing these charges was\r\ncompounded by the instruction it gave that a motorist whose vision is obscured\r\n\"must exercise due care consistent with the increased danger occasioned by the\r\nconditions that obstruct their vision.\" He contends this instruction led the jury to\r\nbelieve the law places the duty of care entirely on the motorist, when the law\r\nactually places duties on both the railroad company and the motorist. Stephens is\r\ncorrect that there are mutual duties, and that the duties of each must be exercised in\r\nlight of all surrounding circumstances. See Chisolm v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 121\r\nS.C. 394, 401, 114 S.E. 500, 503 (1922) (\"A railroad company and a traveler on a\r\n\nhighway crossing are charged with a mutual duty of keeping a lookout for danger,\r\nand the degree of vigilance required of both is in proportion to the known risk; the\r\ngreater the danger, the greater the care required of both.\"). The trial court\r\nconveyed that point to the jury, however, stating \"there is a mutual duty on traveler\r\nand railroad to exercise due care.\" Additionally, the trial court instructed the jury\r\nthat \"both the traveler and the company are charged with the same degree of care:\r\nthe one to avoid being injured; and the other to avoid inflicting injury. The care of\r\neach must be commensurate with the risk and danger involved. The greater the\r\nrisk, the greater the care.\" We find no error.\r\n\r\n             B.\t   Charging on Signage Rules and DOT's Authority to Close\r\n                   Railroad Crossings\r\n\r\nStephens argues the trial court erred in charging the substance of three statutes\r\npertaining to signs at railroad crossings: section 56-5-1010 (2006), which requires\r\nrailroad companies to install and maintain cross-buck signs at crossings; section\r\n58-17-1390 (1976), which requires railroad companies to install and maintain signs\r\nreading \"Railroad Crossing\" at crossings; and section 56-5-1020 (2006), which\r\nprohibits unauthorized signs, signals, or other devices at crossings. The court also\r\ninstructed the jury on section 58-15-1625 (Supp. 2011), which authorizes DOT to\r\nclose railroad crossings to public traffic when DOT finds the increased public\r\nsafety of closing the crossing outweighs the inconvenience caused to motorists\r\nwho will have to take another route.\r\n\r\nDespite Respondents' argument to the contrary, Stephens' challenges to these\r\ninstructions are preserved. However, the charges contain accurate statements of\r\nlaw, and there was evidence to support the trial court's decision to give each of\r\nthem. See Clark, 339 S.C. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539 (stating a trial court must\r\ncharge the current and correct law of South Carolina, and must charge principles of\r\nlaw that apply to the issues raised in the pleadings and developed by the evidence\r\nin support of those issues).\r\n\r\nAs to the first two charges, Stephens claimed in his complaint that, in addition to\r\nfailing to remove vegetation and properly sound the train horn, CSX was negligent\r\n\"in maintaining an unreasonably hazardous and unsafe crossing\" and \"in failing to\r\nmaintain adequate warning devices at the crossing.\" CSX's duty to install and\r\nmaintain the cross-buck and railroad crossing sign relate to those claims.\r\n\nAs to the third charge, Stephens' grade crossing safety expert gave an opinion that\r\nthe Hill Road crossing could be made safer with the installation of active traffic-\r\ncontrol devices, such as lights and gates. DOT's traffic management engineer,\r\nRichard Jenkins, testified railroad companies have installed gates and lights at\r\ncrossings without DOT's authorization. The charge on section 56-5-1020 was\r\napplicable because it informed the jury that CSX could not legally install active\r\ntraffic-control devices without DOT's authorization.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to DOT's authority to close crossings, the charge properly relates to the\r\nliability of DOT. Further, Jenkins testified railroads have closed crossings without\r\nasking DOT for permission. From that testimony, the jury could have inferred\r\nCSX should have closed the crossing. Section 58-15-1625 places the power to\r\nclose crossings in DOT's hands. Accordingly, the charge on that statute was\r\napplicable because it showed the jury CSX did not have the authority to close Hill\r\nRoad at the crossing.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in giving these charges.\r\n\r\n             C.     Charging on Discretionary Act Immunity\r\n\r\nStephens argues the trial court erred in charging the jury on subsection 15-78-60(5)\r\nof the South Carolina Code (2005), which immunizes governmental entities from\r\nliability for injuries caused by \"the exercise of discretion or judgment by the\r\ngovernmental entity or employee or the performance or failure to perform any act\r\nor service which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental entity or\r\nemployee.\"6\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Discretionary act immunity is an affirmative defense, which the defendant bears\r\nthe burden of proving. Creech v. S.C. Wildlife & Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24,\r\n28, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997). However, it is not clear whether discretionary act\r\nimmunity comes into play only after a plaintiff establishes the elements of\r\nnegligence, or instead relates to the question of whether a governmental entity\r\nbreached its duty in the first place. See Pike v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 343 S.C. 224,\r\n230, 540 S.E.2d 87, 90 (2000) (stating discretionary act immunity requires proof\r\nthat the government entity used \"accepted professional standards,\" \"actually\r\nweighed competing considerations and made a conscious choice\"). If the latter is\r\ntrue, then the court's instruction could have affected the jury's verdict that DOT did\r\nnot breach its duty. Thus, we address this issue.\r\n\n\"To establish discretionary immunity, the governmental entity must prove that the\r\ngovernmental employees, faced with alternatives, actually weighed competing\r\nconsiderations and made a conscious choice.\" Pike, 343 S.C. at 230, 540 S.E.2d at\r\n90. \"[T]he governmental entity must show that in weighing the competing\r\nconsiderations and alternatives, it utilized accepted professional standards\r\nappropriate to resolve the issue before them.\" Id. (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted). In this case, DOT asserted it was entitled to an instruction on\r\ndiscretionary immunity for its installation of the stop sign and the stop line at the\r\ncrossing. Stephens contends DOT did not present evidence entitling it to the\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Stephens that DOT did not present sufficient evidence to prove its\r\ndiscretionary act immunity claim. However, that does not necessarily mean the\r\ntrial court erred in giving the instruction. The trial court was never asked to direct\r\na verdict on DOT's immunity claim. At the charge conference, therefore, the court\r\napproached the issue believing immunity was for the jury to decide. The\r\narguments on whether to instruct the jury on discretionary act immunity centered\r\non whether there was evidence of DOT making an actual choice in where it located\r\nthe stop sign or the stop line. With regard to the stop line, there was evidence that\r\nthe DOT employee who installed it made a conscious choice between two potential\r\nlocations.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Stephens contends the immunity defense failed because DOT did not\r\nfollow an accepted professional standard in its placement of the stop sign or the\r\nstop line. Stephens did not present this argument to the trial court. We will not\r\nreverse the trial court's jury charge based on a point Stephens never asked the court\r\nto consider. See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772,\r\n779-80 (2004) (\"[A]rguments are preserved for appellate review only when they\r\nare raised to and ruled on by the lower court.\"). Therefore, we affirm.\r\n\r\n      VI.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court's decisions are AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\r\n\nSHORT, J.: I concur with the majority regarding the trial court's exclusion of\r\nsubsequent remedial acts. I also concur with the majority's finding that Stephens\r\nfailed to preserve the issues regarding the trial court's denial of her motions for\r\ndirected verdict and JNOV. However, I respectfully disagree with the majority\r\nregarding the alleged erroneous jury charges, and I would reverse and remand for a\r\nnew trial.\r\n\r\nFirst, I agree with the majority that DOT failed to present sufficient evidence to\r\nentitle it to a jury charge on discretionary immunity. However, I disagree with the\r\nmajority's conclusion that despite DOT's failure to prove entitlement to the charge,\r\nthe trial court did not err by giving the charge. Furthermore, I find Stephens was\r\nprejudiced by the error because the charge could easily have confused the jury.\r\nHere, as noted by the majority, there was testimony by three DOT employees about\r\nthe conditions near the crossing.\r\n\r\nI also note the trial judge erred in charging section 56-5-2930, which makes it\r\nunlawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle under the influence, but refusing to\r\ncharge section 56-5-2950(G)(1), which provides that a person with a blood alcohol\r\nlevel of .05% or less is conclusively presumed to not be under the influence. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §§ 56-5-2930; -2950(G)(1) (Supp. 2011). The trial court also\r\ncharged that DOT was immune from liability for the criminal actions of third\r\npersons. S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60 (20) (2005). Colvin admitted she consumed\r\none or two wine coolers in the five hours preceding the accident and took\r\nprescription medications. Her blood alcohol content was measured at .018%\r\nfollowing the accident. I conclude the trial court erred by charging the criminal\r\ndriving under impairment statute and the immunity statute without charging 56-5-\r\n2950(G)(1), which permitted Colvin to rebut her alleged impairment and\r\nprejudiced her.\r\n\r\nI next find the trial judge erred in charging CSX's proposed request to charge\r\nNumber 45, which stated, \"It is Always Train Time at the Crossing.\" In my view,\r\nthis could have implied to the jury that CSX and DOT had lesser duties of care\r\nthan a motorist and constituted prejudicial error.\r\n\r\nFinally, I find these errors were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See\r\nWells v. Halyard, 341 S.C. 234, 237, 533 S.E.2d 341, 343 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"An\r\nalleged error is harmless if the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that the alleged error did not contribute to the verdict.\") (emphasis added).\r\nAccordingly, I would reverse and remand.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5009","title":"State v.

Peace, of Greenwood, for the\r\n            State.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.: In this criminal action, Bennie Mitchell argues the trial court\r\nerred in: (1) allowing a police officer to identify Mitchell from photographs taken\r\nby the victim's deer camera because it was in violation of Rule 403, SCRE, and\r\nRule 701, SCRE; (2) admitting a disk containing photographs from a deer camera\r\nbecause it was in violation of Rules 1001, 1002, and 1003, SCRE; and (3) failing\r\n\nto grant Mitchell's post-trial motion for a new trial on the first-degree burglary\r\ncharge when all of the elements of the charge were not met. We affirm the trial\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of October 28, 2008, Stephen Potts returned to his home in\r\nNewberry County and discovered someone had broken into his home during his\r\nabsence. After reviewing a motion-activated deer camera that had been placed on\r\ntop of his refrigerator, Potts saw photographs of a man in his kitchen. A police\r\nofficer subsequently identified the man in the photographs as Mitchell.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, the Newberry County Grand Jury (Grand Jury) indicted Mitchell\r\non one count of first-degree burglary, one count of possession of burglary tools,\r\nand one count of enhancement of larceny.1 In February 2010, the Grand Jury also\r\nindicted Mitchell on one count of petit larceny. The matter was called for a jury\r\ntrial on April 19, 2010.\r\n\r\nIn a pre-trial hearing, Mitchell moved to require the State to establish the\r\nauthenticity and foundation of the photographs from Potts's deer camera. The trial\r\ncourt denied his request but indicated Mitchell could object at the appropriate time\r\nduring the trial.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mitchell moved to exclude testimony from Lieutenant (Lt.) Roy\r\nMcClurkin, of the Newberry Police Department, regarding Lt. McClurkin's\r\nidentification of Mitchell as the person in the photographs from Potts's deer\r\ncamera. He objected on several grounds: (1) the testimony was a lay opinion; (2)\r\nthe jury could determine whether Mitchell was the person in the photographs\r\nwithout Lt. McClurkin's testimony; and (3) the testimony would be unduly\r\nprejudicial because of Lt. McClurkin's position as a police officer. The trial court\r\ndenied his motion, finding the proposed testimony met the requirements for\r\nadmissibility under Rule 701, SCRE. The trial court further found the testimony's\r\nprobative value outweighed any prejudice to Mitchell, but it excluded similar\r\ntestimony from other police officers as cumulative and prejudicial.\r\n\r\nPotts testified he lived in Newberry County in October 2008, and due to some\r\nbreak-ins at his home, he mounted a motion-activated deer camera on top of his\r\n\r\n1   The enhancement of larceny indictment was nolle prossed on April 21, 2010.\r\n\nrefrigerator. Potts stated that upon returning home from work at approximately\r\n1:00 a.m. on October 28, 2008, he noticed someone or something had tampered\r\nwith the window next to his back door. After going inside his home and checking\r\nthe deer camera, he discovered photographs of someone in his kitchen that he did\r\nnot recognize. He waited to contact the police until around 10 a.m. and then told\r\nthem of the photographs.\r\n\r\nMitchell objected to the admission of a disk containing the photographs from the\r\ndeer camera, arguing it was not the \"original\" as required by the South Carolina\r\nRules of Evidence and maintaining there was a genuine issue with the original's\r\nauthenticity. Potts testified during the in camera hearing that he had possession of\r\nthe deer camera from the time he returned home on the night of the alleged\r\nincident until he took it to his business and downloaded the data onto a laptop. He\r\nidentified the photographs on the disk as the ones he downloaded directly from the\r\ncamera. Potts stated the police officer viewed the photographs on his personal\r\nlaptop at his home on October 28 but that laptop could not download the\r\nphotographs to print them out. He then took the camera to the police station, but\r\nthe police station was not able to download and print the photographs either. At\r\nthat point, Potts took the deer camera back to his business where he downloaded\r\nthe photographs and copied them onto a disk. The State argued that the deer\r\ncamera photographs were meant to be downloaded and then printed out. It then\r\nanalogized the deer camera to a regular film camera because when one takes a\r\npicture with a regular film camera, the original is on the film and then the person\r\ncan get them developed to produce a copy of what came from the original. Thus,\r\nthe State maintained the photographs fell under the definition of an original.\r\n\r\nPotts admitted the pictures had a timestamp of 3:00 a.m., even though he testified\r\nhe returned home from work around 1:00 or 1:30 a.m. He stated the clock was\r\nwrong on the deer camera because he had just set it up and had not properly\r\nprogrammed the clock feature yet.\r\n\r\nThe trial court overruled Mitchell's objection, finding the photographs on the disk\r\nwere data stored in a computer put in a format readable by sight. Further, the\r\nphotographs were the same as the ones on the deer camera based upon the\r\nfoundation offered by the State. The trial court determined the photographs were\r\n\"originals\" as defined in Rule 1001, SCRE. Potts then testified before the jury\r\nregarding the photographs and stated he did not know the person pictured in them.\r\nFurther, he testified that approximately one hundred dollars in quarters, some\r\nclothing, and some beer were taken from his home.\r\n\nCorporal (Cpl.) Allison Moore of the Newberry Police Department testified she\r\nresponded to Potts's residence on October 28, 2008. She stated Potts showed her\r\nthe photographs on the deer camera, and she thought they depicted the unknown\r\nsuspect well. Cpl. Moore could not determine where the person entered Potts's\r\nhome and could not recover any fingerprints. When Potts came to the police\r\nstation with the deer camera as requested, he met Cpl. Moore and they discovered\r\nthe police station did not have the ability to download and print the photographs\r\neither. Potts informed Cpl. Moore that he could download the photographs at his\r\nplace of business. She advised him to bring the photographs to the police\r\ndepartment after he downloaded them, and he did so later that day on October 28.\r\n\r\nLt. McClurkin stated that Potts and Cpl. Moore came to his office with the disk on\r\nthe afternoon of October 28, 2008, and asked him if he recognized the person in\r\nthe photographs taken from Potts's deer camera. Lt. McClurkin testified, over\r\nMitchell's objection, that he viewed the photographs from the disk on his office\r\ncomputer and recognized Mitchell as the person in the photographs. He stated that\r\nin one of the photographs, the person he believed to be Mitchell was standing with\r\na flashlight and a bag in his hands. Lt. McClurkin explained he knew Mitchell\r\nfrom living in Newberry for over twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Mitchell of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary\r\ntools, but it acquitted him of the petit larceny charge. Mitchell moved for a new\r\ntrial based on the ground that the State failed to establish all elements of the\r\nburglary charge because the jury acquitted him of petit larceny. The trial court\r\ndenied his motion, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Thus, an appellate court is\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.     Identification of Mitchell\r\n\r\nMitchell contends it was reversible error to allow Lt. McClurkin to identify\r\nMitchell at trial from photographs taken from the deer camera because it was in\r\n\nviolation of Rule 701, SCRE, and Rule 403, SCRE. Specifically, Mitchell argues\r\nLt. McClurkin was not an eyewitness to the burglary; therefore, his identification\r\nof Mitchell from the photographs from the disk was simply his opinion of what\r\nwas on the video. Further, Mitchell states the jury could observe the photographs\r\nthemselves and draw their own conclusion as to identity. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"'The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a\r\nmanifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.'\" State v. Fripp,\r\n396 S.C. 434, 438, 721 S.E.2d 465, 467 (Ct. App. 2012) (quoting State v. Douglas,\r\n369 S.C. 424, 429, 632 S.E.2d 845, 847-48 (2006)). \"Rule 701 of the South\r\nCarolina Rules of Evidence explains when lay witness testimony is admissible.\"\r\nId. at 439, 721 S.E.2d at 467.\r\n\r\n             If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness'\r\n             testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited\r\n             to those opinions or inferences which (a) are rationally\r\n             based on the perception of the witness, (b) are helpful to\r\n             a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the\r\n             determination of a fact in issue, and (c) do not require\r\n             special knowledge, skill, experience or training.\r\n\r\nRule 701, SCRE. \"'Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise\r\nadmissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided\r\nby the trier of fact.'\" Fripp, 396 S.C. at 439, 721 S.E.2d at 467 (quoting Rule 704,\r\nSCRE).\r\n\r\nMitchell also argues the police officer's testimony violated Rule 403, SCRE, which\r\nstates:      Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\n             probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger\r\n             of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\r\n             the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of\r\n             time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\r\n\r\nRule 403, SCRE.\r\n\nMitchell cites State v. Herring, 387 S.C. 201, 692 S.E.2d 490 (2009), in support of\r\nhis argument that the police officer's identification was in violation of Rule 701,\r\nSCRE. However, in Fripp this court determined that two witnesses could testify to\r\nthe identity of a person depicted on surveillance videotape. 396 S.C. at 438-40,\r\n721 S.E.2d at 467-68. The defendant was charged with second-degree burglary\r\nafter he was identified as the suspect in a burglary at a general store. Id. at 436-37,\r\n721 S.E.2d at 466. The burglary took place around 4:00 a.m. with no one else\r\npresent in the general store. Id. at 437, 721 S.E.2d at 466. An alarm triggered the\r\npolice response, and the suspect's image was caught on the store's surveillance\r\nvideotape. Id. In explaining how she was able to identify the suspect on the\r\nvideotape as being the defendant, one witness, the store manager, indicated she\r\nknew the defendant \"very well\" and \"saw him all the time.\" Id. at 437-38, 721\r\nS.E.2d at 466. The second witness, a store employee, testified she was able to\r\nidentify the defendant because she was acquainted with him through his family.\r\nId. at 438, 721 S.E.2d at 466. This court found their testimony was \"rationally\r\nbased on their perceptions of Fripp's appearance including his physical appearance,\r\nmannerisms, and clothing.\" Id. at 439, 721 S.E.2d at 467. Additionally, this court\r\nconcluded the two witnesses' opinions were helpful in determining a key fact in\r\nissue—\"whether [the defendant] was the person depicted on the videotape.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThis court then proceeded to analyze federal authority construing the element of\r\nhelpfulness in determining a key fact in issue.2 Id. at 439-40, 721 S.E.2d at 467-\r\n68. In United States v. Allen, 787 F.2d 933 (4th Cir. 1986), vacated on other\r\ngrounds, 479 U.S. 1077 (1987), the court permitted identification testimony by\r\nwitnesses based on surveillance photographs. That court stated:\r\n\r\n             We believe . . . testimony by those who knew defendants\r\n             over a period of time and in a variety of circumstances\r\n             offers to the jury a perspective it could not acquire in its\r\n             limited exposure to defendants. Human features develop\r\n             in the mind's eye over time. These witnesses had\r\n             interacted with defendants in a way the jury could not,\r\n\r\n2 Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence states: \"If the witness is not testifying\r\nas an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited\r\nto those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of\r\nthe witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the\r\ndetermination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other\r\nspecialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\"\r\n\n              and in natural settings that gave them a greater\r\n              appreciation of defendants' normal appearance. Thus,\r\n              their testimony provided the jury with the opinion of\r\n              those whose exposure was not limited to three days in a\r\n              sterile courtroom setting.\r\n\r\n              This fuller perspective is especially helpful where, as\r\n              here, the photographs used for identification are less than\r\n              clear.\r\n\r\nId. at 936.\r\n\r\n\"In United States v. Robinson, 804 F.2d 280 (4th Cir.1986), the court concluded\r\nthe defendant's brother's identification testimony, based on surveillance\r\nphotographs, was admissible under Federal Rule 701 as it would aid the jury in\r\ndetermining a key fact in issue.\" Fripp, 396 S.C. at 440, 721 S.E.2d at 468.\r\n\r\n              Sylvester Robinson was an individual who could testify\r\n              under this rule as a lay witness. His testimony was based\r\n              upon his perceptions from viewing the photographs and\r\n              from his perceptions of and close association with his\r\n              brother over the years. Although the defendant's\r\n              appearance may not have physically changed from the\r\n              time of the bank surveillance photograph until the time of\r\n              trial, the individual in the photograph was wearing a hat\r\n              and dark glasses, and the testimony of Sylvester\r\n              Robinson could be helpful to the jury on the issue of fact\r\n              of whether the appellant was the person shown in the\r\n              bank surveillance photographs. A lay witness may give\r\n              an opinion concerning the identity of a person depicted in\r\n              a surveillance photograph if there is some basis for\r\n              concluding that the witness is more likely to correctly\r\n              identify the defendant from the photograph than is the\r\n              jury. Sylvester Robinson certainly qualified as a person\r\n              more likely to correctly identify the individual shown in\r\n              the photograph.\r\n\r\nId. at 440-41, 721 S.E.2d at 468 (quoting Robinson, 804 F.2d at 282).\r\n\nAfter analyzing federal law, this court stated \"the surveillance video was not\r\ncrystal clear and the perpetrator sought, in some measure, to obscure his identity by\r\nwearing the hood of his jacket up.\" Id. at 441, 721 S.E.2d at 468. \"While the jury,\r\nhaving observed Fripp for a relatively brief period of time in the courtroom setting,\r\nmay have believed Fripp was the person on the videotape, Brown's and Young's\r\ntestimonies, based on their perceptions of him over time, aided the jury in making\r\nan ultimate determination as to the burglar's identity.\" Id. We then found that \"the\r\nidentification of a familiar person does not require any specialized knowledge,\r\nskill, experience, or training as contemplated by subpart (3) of Rule 701.\" Id.\r\n\"Consequently, [this court] affirm[ed] the trial court's admission of Brown's and\r\nYoung's identification testimonies.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, we find these facts are analogous to Fripp, and the trial court did not err in\r\nintroducing Lt. McClurkin's testimony pursuant to Rule 701, SCRE. Lt.\r\nMcClurkin's perception of the person in the photographs was based on his first-\r\nhand knowledge of Mitchell. While Lt. McClurkin was not present during the\r\nalleged crime, he knew Mitchell through his twenty years of living in the\r\nNewberry area. This was the only fact presented at trial that allowed Lt.\r\nMcClurkin to identify Mitchell, whereas in Fripp, the witnesses seemed to be able\r\nto describe their knowledge of the defendant from the community in more detail.\r\nHowever, that fact did give a basis for concluding that Lt. McClurkin was more\r\nlikely to correctly identify the defendant from the photograph than the jury.\r\nFurthermore, the identity of the person in the photographs was a fact in issue, and\r\nLt. McClurkin's identification of who he thought was in the photographs was\r\nsurely helpful to the jury.\r\n\r\nAs we noted, we do not find Lt. McClurkin's testimony's probative value was\r\noutweighed by the prejudicial value under Rule 403, SCRE, based on Mitchell's\r\ncontention that it was a lay opinion not based on personal observation. We also\r\nfind the probative value of his testimony was not outweighed by the prejudicial\r\neffect based upon Mitchell's argument that Lt. McClurkin was a police officer\r\noffering his opinion as to Mitchell's identity. Lt. McClurkin was available for\r\ncross-examination by Mitchell, and his basis for identification was stated as simply\r\nhaving been in the Newberry community for twenty years. The trial court's jury\r\ninstructions further undermined any prejudicial effect Lt. McClurkin's testimony\r\nmay have had.3 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n3The jury instructions included the following statements, \"[A]s I told you, you\r\nmust consider and determine the credibility of the witnesses and of the exhibits.\r\n\n    II.   Authentication of the disk with downloaded photographs\r\n\r\nMitchell contends the trial court erred in allowing the disk with the downloaded\r\ndeer camera photographs to be admitted when the photographs were not properly\r\nauthenticated. Specifically, Mitchell maintains that because the police did not take\r\nthe camera into custody but left it with Potts to download the photographs onto his\r\nbusiness computer, the evidence was admitted in violation of Rules 1001, 1002,\r\nand 1003, SCRE.4 We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe pertinent section of Rule 1001, SCRE, states:\r\n\r\n             An \"original\" of a writing or recording is the writing or\r\n             recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the\r\n             same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An\r\n             \"original\" of a photograph includes the negative or any\r\n             print therefrom. If data are stored in a computer or\r\n             similar device, any printout or other output readable by\r\n             sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an\r\n             \"original\".\r\n\r\nRule 1001(3), SCRE. Further, Rule 1001 defines a duplicate as \"a counterpart\r\nproduced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by\r\nmeans of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or by mechanical\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I told you some things you could use in engaging credibility . . . [Y]ou may\r\nbelieve everything a witness says, you may believe nothing a witness says. You\r\nmay believe parts of a witnesses [sic] testimony and disregard other parts. You\r\nmay believe one witness over several or several over one. But remember that your\r\njob is to determine the true facts of the case and whether the state has met its\r\nburden of proof and you do that by weighing all the evidence, regardless of who\r\ncalled the witness.\"\r\n4 At trial, Mitchell objected to the chain of custody of the disk as well. However,\r\nhe appears to have abandoned that argument on appeal. See Jinks v. Richland\r\nCnty., 355 S.C. 341, 344, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003) (holding issues not argued in\r\nthe brief are deemed abandoned and precluded from consideration on appeal).\r\n\nor electronic re-recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other equivalent\r\ntechniques which accurately reproduces the original.\" Rule 1001(4), SCRE.\r\n\r\nRule 1002, SCRE, in addressing the requirements of an original, states that \"[t]o\r\nprove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing,\r\nrecording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or\r\nby statute.\" In addressing the admissibility of duplicates, Rule 1003, SCRE, states\r\nthat \"[a] duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a\r\ngenuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the\r\ncircumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.\"\r\n\r\n\"The question of whether to admit evidence under [Rules 1001 to 1004,\r\ncollectively known as the best evidence rule,] is also addressed to the discretion of\r\nthe trial court.\" State v. Halcomb, 382 S.C. 432, 443-44, 676 S.E.2d 149, 154-55\r\n(Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\nWe find the photographs from the disk were originals pursuant to Rule 1001,\r\nSCRE. Rule 1001(3), SCRE (\"If data are stored in a computer or similar device,\r\nany printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately,\r\nis an 'original'.\"). A digital camera was used, and the photographs from the disk\r\nwere testified to as being the same photographs that were on the deer camera on\r\nOctober 28, 2008. Mitchell had the opportunity to cross-examine Potts and the\r\npolice officers as to the handling of the photographs and disk on which the\r\nphotographs were downloaded. We conclude the trial court properly admitted the\r\nphotographs from the disk as originals, and thus, Rule 1003 is not relevant to our\r\nanalysis. For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n   III.   Motion for New Trial\r\n\r\nMitchell argues the trial court erred in denying his post-trial motion for a new trial\r\non his first-degree burglary charge. Specifically, Mitchell contends all of the\r\nelements of first-degree burglary were not met because the intent to steal element\r\nwas not proven since the jury found Mitchell not guilty of petit larceny. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\"'The decision whether to grant a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the\r\ntrial court, and [the appellate court] will not disturb the trial court's decision absent\r\nan abuse of discretion.'\" State v. Senter, 396 S.C. 547, 552, 722 S.E.2d 233, 236\r\n(Ct. App. 2011) (quoting State v. Mercer, 381 S.C. 149, 166, 672 S.E.2d 556, 565\r\n\n(2009)). \"If there is no evidence to support a conviction, [this court] should uphold\r\nan order granting a new trial.\" State v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 619, 567 S.E.2d 523,\r\n526 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176\r\n(1993)). \"However, if competent evidence supports the jury's verdict, the trial\r\n[court] may not substitute [its] own judgment for that of the jury and overturn that\r\nverdict.\" Id. (citing State v. Miller, 287 S.C. 280, 283, 337 S.E.2d 883, 885\r\n(1985)).\r\n\r\nWe believe Mitchell's argument is referencing the \"inconsistent verdict theory.\"\r\nHowever, our supreme court has abolished the rule against inconsistent verdicts in\r\nthis state. State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 383, 401 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1991).\r\nMoreover, we find the verdicts are not necessarily inconsistent. Mitchell was\r\ncharged and convicted of first-degree burglary, pursuant to section 16-11-311(A)\r\nof the South Carolina Code (2003). The pertinent portion of the statute states: \"A\r\nperson is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling\r\nwithout consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling . . . .\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-11-311(A) (2003) (emphasis added). Mitchell was identified from\r\nphotographs on the deer camera in Potts's home. Potts testified that he did not\r\nrecognize the person in the photographs and had not given permission for that\r\nperson to be in his home. There was testimony Mitchell held a bag and a flashlight\r\nin one of the photographs, and the photograph was admitted into evidence. A jury\r\ncould have inferred that Mitchell intended to commit a crime while in Potts's\r\nhome, and due to a multitude of scenarios, was unable or decided not to carry out\r\nthe intended crime. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying Mitchell's post-trial\r\nmotion for a new trial. For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion regarding the issues\r\non appeal. Thus, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS AND THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5010","title":"SCDOT v.

Poston, Jr. (the Appellants) argue the circuit court erred in finding they were\r\nentitled to attorney's fees based on an hourly rate rather than a contingency fee\r\nagreement. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 2007, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT)\r\nserved the Appellants with a notice of condemnation.1 SCDOT subsequently\r\noffered the Appellants $40,300 for their property. In June 2009, the case\r\nproceeded to a jury trial where the Appellants prevailed and were awarded\r\n$125,000.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2009, the Appellants filed an application for attorney's fees and costs\r\npursuant to section 28-2-510(B)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2007). The\r\nAppellants sought $28,233.33 in attorney's fees and $6,643.91 in costs pursuant to\r\na contingency fee agreement with their attorney. The agreement provided that the\r\nAppellants' attorney agreed to represent them on a contingency fee basis of one-\r\nthird of the gross amount collected over SCDOT's offer of $40,300. During a\r\nhearing before the circuit court, the Appellants argued the court should determine\r\nwhether the requested contingent attorney's fees were reasonable based on the\r\nfactors set forth in Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997).\r\nSCDOT argued the contingency fee agreement should not be considered, but rather\r\nfees should be calculated based upon the lodestar analysis set forth in Layman v.\r\nState, 376 S.C. 434, 658 S.E.2d 320 (2008).\r\n\r\nIn a March 1, 2010 order, the circuit court determined attorney's fees should be\r\nbased on an hourly rate rather than on the contingency fee agreement between the\r\nAppellants and their attorney. Citing the six Jackson factors, the circuit court\r\ndetermined Appellants' attorney was entitled to compensation at the rate of $300\r\nper hour for a total of $16,290.2 The circuit court subsequently denied the\r\nAppellants' motion for reconsideration. In its order denying the Appellants'\r\n\r\n1 According to the Appellants' brief, the condemnation notice provided that\r\nSCDOT was acquiring .314 acres of the Appellants' property for the construction\r\nof the U.S. Highway 378 relocation.\r\n2 The circuit court also awarded the Appellants $6,643.91 in costs. The costs\r\nawarded are not at issue in this appeal.\r\n\nmotion, the court found the Jackson factors were not applicable. The court also\r\nfound the Appellants' request for a determination that its contingency fee\r\nagreement was reasonable was not applicable in light of Layman. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The decision to award or deny attorneys' fees under a state statute will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\" Kiriakides v. School Dist. of\r\nGreenville Cnty., 382 S.C. 8, 20, 675 S.E.2d 439, 445 (2009) (citing Layman v.\r\nState, 376 S.C. 434, 444, 658 S.E.2d 320, 325 (2008)). \"An abuse of discretion\r\noccurs when the conclusions of the [circuit] court are either controlled by an error\r\nof law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions.\" Id. \"Similarly, the\r\nspecific amount of attorneys' fees awarded pursuant to a statute authorizing\r\nreasonable attorneys' fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be\r\ndisturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nLayman v. State\r\n\r\nThe Appellants argue the circuit court erred in relying on Layman v. State, 376\r\nS.C. 434, 658 S.E.2d 320 (2008). We disagree.3\r\n\r\n\"Under the 'American Rule,' the parties to a lawsuit generally bear the\r\nresponsibility of paying their own attorneys' fees.\" Layman, 376 S.C. at 451, 658\r\nS.E.2d at 329. South Carolina and other jurisdictions \"recognize numerous\r\nexceptions to this rule, including the award of attorneys' fees pursuant to a statute.\"\r\nId. at 451-52, 658 S.E.2d at 329. \"A statutory award of attorneys' fees is typically\r\nauthorized under what is known as a fee-shifting statute, which permits a\r\nprevailing party to recover attorneys' fees from the losing party.\" Id. at 452, 658\r\nS.E.2d at 329.\r\n\r\n3 The Appellants also argue they are entitled to attorney's fees based upon their\r\ncontingency fee agreement in order to satisfy the \"just compensation\" to which\r\nthey are entitled under the South Carolina Constitution. Because the Appellants\r\nfailed to raise this argument to the circuit court, it is not preserved for our review.\r\nSee Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2006) (holding\r\nissues must be raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved for\r\nappellate review).\r\n\nIn Layman, participants in the Teachers and Employee Retention Incentive (TERI)\r\nbrought a class action suit against the State and the South Carolina Retirement\r\nSystem alleging breach of contract as a result of the State collecting retirement\r\ncontributions from their paychecks. 376 S.C. at 441, 658 S.E.2d at 323-24. The\r\nplaintiffs argued the court's instructions to consider the \"benefit to all old TERI\r\nparticipants\" in awarding attorney's fees made the determination of a reasonable\r\naward analogous to cases in which attorney's fees were awarded from a common\r\nfund. Layman, 376 S.C. at 453, 658 S.E.2d at 330. The plaintiffs argued that even\r\nthough the applicable state action statute, section 15-77-300 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (Supp. 2011), shifts the source of attorney's fees to the State, the court should\r\nfind that the circuit judge properly awarded attorney's fees based on the\r\npercentage-of-the-recovery approach typically utilized when the source of\r\nattorney's fees is spread among the beneficiaries of a common fund. Id.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court disagreed with the plaintiffs, holding \"that because the state\r\naction statute shifts the source of the prevailing party's attorneys' fees to the losing\r\nparty, an award of fees based on a percentage of the prevailing party's recovery is\r\nimproper.\" Id. at 455, 658 S.E.2d at 331. The court noted:\r\n\r\n             [U]tilizing common fund methodology when awarding\r\n             attorneys' fees pursuant to a fee-shifting statute is wholly\r\n             inappropriate in light of the underlying theoretical\r\n             distinction between a common fund source of attorneys'\r\n             fees and a statutory source of attorneys' fees. Although\r\n             both sources are exceptions to the general rule that each\r\n             party is responsible for the party's own attorneys' fees,\r\n             the common fund doctrine is based on the equitable\r\n             allocation of attorneys' fees among a benefited group,\r\n             and not the shifting of the attorneys' fee burden to the\r\n             losing party. This Court certainly acknowledges that a\r\n             percentage-of-the-recovery approach may be appropriate\r\n             under circumstances in which a court is given jurisdiction\r\n             over a common fund from which it must allocate\r\n             attorneys' fees among a benefited group of litigants.\r\n             However, where, as here, a fee-shifting statute shifts the\r\n             source of reasonable attorneys' fees entirely to the losing\r\n             party, we find it both illogical and erroneous to calculate\r\n             fees using the methodology justified under a fee-\r\n             spreading theory.\r\n\nId. at 453-454, 658 S.E.2d at 330. The court found a lodestar analysis was the\r\nproper method for determining an award of reasonable attorneys' fees under the\r\nstate action statute. Id. at 457, 658 S.E.2d at 332. \"A lodestar figure is designed to\r\nreflect the reasonable time and effort involved in litigating a case, and is calculated\r\nby multiplying a reasonable hourly rate by the reasonable time expended.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the Appellants argue Layman is not applicable because the state action\r\nstatute at issue in Layman, section 15-77-300, is not at issue in the present case.\r\nThey contend the Eminent Domain Procedure Act4 (the Act) provides the proper\r\nprocedure for determining reasonable litigation expenses. SCDOT argues the\r\nanalysis in Layman is not limited to section 15-77-300, but also applies to the Act.\r\n\r\nThe Act provides the procedural guidelines for determining just compensation with\r\nregards to the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Pursuant to the Act, a\r\nlandowner who prevails in the trial of a condemnation action, in addition to his\r\ncompensation for the property, may recover his \"reasonable litigation expenses.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 28-2-510(B)(1) (2007). \"Litigation expenses\" are defined in the\r\nAct as        the reasonable fees, charges, disbursements, and\r\n              expenses necessarily incurred from and after service of\r\n              the Condemnation Notice, including, but not limited to,\r\n              reasonable attorney's fees, appraisal fees, engineering\r\n              fees, deposition costs, and other expert witness fees\r\n              necessary for preparation or participation in\r\n              condemnation actions and the actual cost of transporting\r\n              the court and jury to view the premises.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 28-2-30(14) (2007). In any application for attorney's fees under\r\nthe Act, the landowner\r\n\r\n              shall show that [he] has prevailed, state the amount\r\n              sought, and include an itemized statement from an\r\n              attorney or expert witness representing or appearing at\r\n              trial in behalf of the landowner stating the fee charged,\r\n              the basis therefor, the actual time expended, and all\r\n              actual expenses for which recovery is sought.\r\n\r\n4   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 28-2-10 to -510 (2007).\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 28-2-510(B)(1) (2007). The court can, in its discretion, reduce\r\nor deny the amount to be awarded if it determines the landowner \"engaged in\r\nconduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the\r\naction or to the extent the court finds that the position of the condemnor was\r\nsubstantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\" Id.\r\n\r\nWe find Layman is controlling in this case. Here, section 28-2-510, like section\r\n15-77-300, shifts the source of the prevailing party's attorney's fees to the losing\r\nparty, the State. According to Layman, it is improper to award a percentage-of-\r\nthe-recovery as fees under a statute that shifts the source of attorney's fees to the\r\nlosing party. Furthermore, as the court explained in Layman, it is improper to\r\naward a percentage-of-the-recovery under a statute that explicitly requires an\r\nattorney to state his hours. The Layman court found:\r\n\r\n             [A]n award based on a percentage of the TERI plaintiffs'\r\n             recovery is inconsistent with the express terms of the\r\n             statutory scheme. Although the state action statute\r\n             neither requires that attorneys' fees be awarded based on\r\n             an hourly rate, nor places a numerical cap on attorneys'\r\n             fees, we find it significant that the statute provides that\r\n             attorneys' fees assessed to the state agency may only be\r\n             paid 'upon presentation of an itemized accounting of the\r\n             attorney's fees.' S.C. Code Ann. § 15-77-330 (2005). In\r\n             our opinion, the requirement of an 'itemized accounting'\r\n             squarely contradicts the utilization of the percentage-of-\r\n             the-recovery method in awarding attorneys' fees under\r\n             the statute.\r\n\r\n376 S.C. at 454, 658 S.E.2d at 330-31. Like section 15-77-300, section 28-2-\r\n510(B)(1) requires the presentation of an itemized statement from an attorney\r\ndetailing his fee, hours, and expenses. As the Layman court found, this\r\nrequirement \"squarely contradicts\" the percentage-of-the-recovery approach.\r\n\r\nWe also note the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina\r\nrecently discussed Layman in Sauders v. South Carolina Public Service Authority,\r\n2011 WL 1236163 (D.S.C. 2011). In Sauders, the District Court found the\r\nplaintiffs' contingency fee agreement was merely one of many factors to be taken\r\ninto consideration in determining the reasonable amount of attorneys' fees due to\r\nthe plaintiffs arising out of their inverse condemnation claims pursuant to section\r\n\n28-11-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).5 Citing Layman, the Sauders\r\ncourt gave \"enhanced consideration\" to the actual amount of work performed, the\r\ncustomary legal fees for similar services, and the benefit obtained for all plaintiffs.\r\nSauders, 2011 WL 1236163 at 7. The District Court noted that \"[e]mphasizing\r\nthese criteria remains consistent with awarding fees pursuant to a fee-shifting\r\nstatute.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in relying on Layman.\r\n\r\nJackson v. Speed\r\n\r\nThe Appellants argue the circuit court erred in failing to determine whether the\r\nrequested attorney's fees were reasonable pursuant to Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C.\r\n289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997). We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Jackson, our supreme court held that \"[w]hen determining the reasonableness of\r\nattorney's fees under a statute mandating the award of attorney fees, the contract\r\nbetween the client and his counsel does not control the determination of a\r\nreasonable hourly rate.\" 326 S.C. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 759. The court held the\r\nfollowing six factors should be considered when determining a reasonable\r\nattorney's fee: \"(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time\r\nnecessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\ncontingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary\r\nlegal fees for similar services.\" Id. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760.\r\n\r\nHere, the circuit court, in its order, stated\r\n\r\n              I have taken into consideration the following items in\r\n              reaching a decision in this matter:\r\n\r\n                 a)   Major extent and difficulty of the case;\r\n                 b)   Time necessarily devoted to the case;\r\n                 c)   Professional standing of counsel;\r\n                 d)   Contingency of compensation; and\r\n                 e)   Beneficial results obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n5Section 28-11-30 deals with reimbursement for property owners for certain\r\nexpenses under the relocation assistance chapter. S.C. Code Ann. § 28-11-30\r\n(Supp. 2011).\r\n\n             Based on the factors set forth above, I do find that [the\r\n             Appellants are] entitled to an award of attorney's fees but\r\n             that the attorney's fees should be based on an hourly rate\r\n             rather than on a contingency fee agreement between [the\r\n             Appellants'] attorney and his client[s].\r\n\r\nIn their motion for reconsideration, the Appellants argued the circuit court's ruling\r\ndid not address any of the Jackson factors the court must consider in awarding\r\nattorney's fees. Subsequently, in its order denying the Appellants' motion for\r\nreconsideration, the circuit court found the Jackson factors were not applicable.\r\nThe court further stated that the Appellants' \"request for attorney's fees and\r\nwhether or not a contingent attorney fee under S.C. Code Ann. § 28-2-510(B) are\r\nreasonable are not applicable in light of the Layman decision.\"\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Appellants contend that although the circuit court cited the six\r\nJackson factors in its order, it relied on the factors \"only in determining the\r\nlodestar multiplier\" and did not rule whether the Appellants' agreed upon\r\ncontingency fee was reasonable under the Act. Relying on Vick v. South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Transportation, 347 S.C. 470, 556 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2001), the\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court should have first determined whether the\r\nrequested attorney's fees were reasonable in accordance with the Jackson factors.\r\n\r\nIn Vick, a property owner brought an inverse condemnation action against SCDOT,\r\nalleging damage to a private road. 347 S.C. at 475, 556 S.E.2d at 696. After a\r\nfinding by the master-in-equity that the road was privately owned and had not been\r\ndedicated to the public, the circuit court entered judgment on the jury verdict and\r\nawarded Vick, the property owner, attorney's fees pursuant to section 28-2-510(A).\r\nId. at 476, 556 S.E.2d at 696. After the trial, Vick's attorney submitted an affidavit\r\nstating that he had worked for Vick in the past at an hourly rate of $130, but in this\r\ncase the fee agreement called for a one-third contingency fee. Id. at 483, n.6, 556\r\nS.E.2d at 700, n.6. Vick's attorney stated that he spent 137.2 hours on this matter,\r\nplus 59.1 hours by an associate, and 7.7 hours of paralegal time. Id. The circuit\r\ncourt awarded Vick $41,425.00 in attorney's fees. Id. SCDOT appealed and this\r\ncourt found that \"[t]o the extent SCDOT asserts the attorney fees are excessive\r\nbecause they exceed the amount that would be due on an hourly basis, this issue\r\nalso was not preserved . . . . In any event, the award was not error.\" Id. at 483, 556\r\nS.E.2d at 700. Based upon the Jackson factors, this court found that the \"circuit\r\njudge's order in this case shows that he considered these factors in determining a\r\nfigure he believed constituted reasonable compensation.\" Id. at 484, 556 S.E.2d at\r\n701.\r\n\nHere, the circuit court was not required to first make a determination regarding the\r\nreasonableness of the contingency fee agreement. The South Carolina District\r\nCourt recently analyzed Vick in Sauders. The Sauders court held that although this\r\ncourt's language in Vick concerning the amount of reasonable attorney's fees was\r\ndicta because the issue was not preserved for appeal, the discussion in Vick was\r\nrelevant to determining the method of attorney's fees. 2011 WL 1236163 at 5. The\r\nDistrict Court found Vick \"demonstrates that after analyzing the six factors a court\r\nshould consider in determining a reasonable attorney's fee, a court could conclude\r\nthat a reasonable attorney's fee under the circumstances of the particular case is an\r\namount close to or equal to the contingency fee contract.\" Id. However, the\r\nDistrict Court noted \"Vick does not hold that the contingency fee contract controls\r\nthe determination of what is a reasonable attorney's fee in an inverse condemnation\r\naction.\" Id. The District Court noted that \"South Carolina law specifically rejects\r\nthe notion that a contingency fee contract controls a court's determination of\r\nreasonable attorneys' fees due to a plaintiff pursuant to a statute mandating the\r\naward of attorney's fees.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in light of Layman and Sauders, we find the circuit court was not\r\nrequired to first determine the reasonableness of the Appellants' contingency fee\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nConsideration of Fee Agreement\r\n\r\nRelying on Kiriakides v. School District of Greenville County, 382 S.C. 8, 675\r\nS.E.2d 439 (2009), the Appellants argue a contingency fee agreement between a\r\nlandowner and his attorney must be considered by the court when determining\r\nreasonable attorney's fees. The Appellants contend it is contradictory for SCDOT\r\nto argue the circuit court should not consider the Appellants' contingency fee\r\nagreement when, in Kiriakides, the condemnor argued the contingency fee\r\nagreement between the condemnee and his attorney controlled. Because the\r\nAppellants failed to raise this argument to the circuit court, it is not preserved for\r\nour review. See Pye, 369 S.C. at 564, 633 S.E.2d at 510 (holding issues must be\r\nraised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\nWILLIAMS and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5011","title":"Dreher v.

In addition, Dreher asserts a permit should have been issued because\r\n\nshe demonstrated de minimus environmental impact from the proposed bridge\r\nconstruction. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nDreher is the record owner of two parcels of property located on Folly Island.1 The\r\nfirst parcel of land, designated as 806 East Cooper Avenue, consists of .2409 acres.\r\nThe second parcel, identified as \"Tract D,\" contains .8434 acres of upland high\r\nground (the buildable portion) and the remainder, which surrounds the buildable\r\nportion, is comprised of coastal tidelands and waters. Tract D commences at the\r\nsoutheast corner of lot 809 East Cooper Avenue and extends to the edges of the\r\nmarsh of Folly River and then approximately 290 feet to the west and back to the\r\neastern line of 805 East Cooper Avenue and then back to the starting point at lot\r\n809. It is undisputed that 806 East Cooper Avenue and Tract D were previously a\r\ncontiguous tract of high ground property. Prior to Dreher's purchase of the parcels,\r\ntwo man-made canals were constructed resulting in Tract D being completely\r\nsurrounded by coastal tidelands and waters.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 2009, Dreher submitted an application to the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), requesting a permit to\r\nconstruct a 9 feet x 51 feet vehicular bridge originating at 806 East Cooper Avenue\r\nand across the tidal canal to Tract D. DHEC denied Dreher's application because\r\nRegulation 30-12(N)(2)(c) (the Small Islands Regulation) prohibits DHEC from\r\nissuing a permit for the construction of a bridge to a coastal island that is less than\r\ntwo acres in size. 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(N)(2)(c) (Supp. 2011) (\"The\r\nDepartment will not consider applications for bridge access to islands less than two\r\nacres in size.\"). The Board of Health and Environmental Control (Board) declined\r\nto conduct a final review conference on the matter, and Dreher filed a written\r\nrequest for a contested hearing with the ALC. Following a hearing on July 13,\r\n2010, the ALC issued a Final Order and Decision (the Order) on October 19, 2010,\r\nand both parties timely filed motions to reconsider. The ALC did not issue a ruling\r\n\r\n1The title abstract for Dreher's property demonstrates that her title derives from an\r\noriginal grant on November 8, 1918, to Folly Island Company of a tract described\r\nas \"the 'Folly Islands' or more commonly known collectively as 'Folly Island,'\r\nbeing bounded on the East by the Atlantic Ocean, on the South by the channel of\r\nStono Inlet, on the West by the channel of Folly River and Folly Creek and on the\r\nNorth by the channel of 'Lighthouse Inlet.'\"\r\n\non either party's motions and, by rule, they were deemed denied after thirty days.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes this court's standard of review for\r\ncases decided by the ALC. This court will only reverse the ALC's decision if it is:\r\n\r\n             (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\r\n             (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n\r\n             (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\r\n             (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n\r\n             (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,\r\n             and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n\r\n             (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of\r\n             discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2011). Furthermore, \"[t]he court may not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for the judgment of the administrative law [court] as to the\r\nweight of the evidence on questions of fact.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Folly Island\r\n\r\nDreher contends the ALC erred in concluding Tract D is subject to the Small\r\nIslands Regulation because Folly Island is expressly excluded by the General\r\nAssembly's definition of coastal island. We agree.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, we note the ALC's finding of fact that Tract D is a part of\r\nFolly Island is the law of the case. DHEC initially filed a motion to reconsider this\r\nparticular finding by the ALC, stating \"[t]he [c]ourt's finding that 'notwithstanding\r\nthe man-made excavation, Petitioner's property, geologically, geographically, and\r\n\nby legal description, is on and within the boundaries of Folly Island' is inconsistent\r\nwith the evidence presented and misleading in light of the court's correct legal\r\nconclusions.\" Despite DHEC's attempt to correct this alleged inconsistency in the\r\nOrder, the ALC did not rule on the motion and DHEC failed to challenge the\r\nALC's finding on appeal; therefore, the finding that Tract D is a part of Folly\r\nIsland is the law of the case. See, e.g., Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle,\r\n334 S.C. 176, 187, 512 S.E.2d 123, 129 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding a lower court's\r\nfinding was the law of the case because respondent failed to cross appeal the\r\nissue).\r\n\r\nEven if the ALC's finding that Tract D is a part of Folly Island is not the law of the\r\ncase, we find there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALC's\r\nfinding of fact that Dreher's property \"geologically, geographically, and by legal\r\ndescription, is on and within the boundaries of Folly Island.\" At the hearing,\r\nDreher presented expert testimony establishing that Tract D is geologically and\r\ngeographically part of Folly Island. Dr. Eric Poplin (\"Dr. Poplin\") and Dr. Allen\r\nKem Fronabarger (\"Dr. Fronabarger\") both testified Tract D was part of a \"dune\r\nridge\" that formed on the back side of Folly Island as a result of aeolian deposition\r\nof sand. In addition, this \"dune ridge\" is graphically depicted as early as 1825 on a\r\nsurvey prepared by the Department of the Army and on subsequent aerial\r\nphotographs as late as 1949. Furthermore, Dr. Poplin testified he conducted shovel\r\ntests of the soils on 806 East Cooper and Tract D that demonstrated there are no\r\ndifferences in their composition and that they appear to be from the same land\r\nform.\r\n\r\nDreher also presented substantial evidence to support the ALC's finding that Tract\r\nD is on and within the legal boundaries of Folly Island. The title abstract for Tract\r\nD states that Dreher's title derives from a grant made on November 8, 1918, to\r\nFolly Island Company of a tract described as \"the 'Folly Islands' or more\r\ncommonly known collectively as 'Folly Island,' being bounded on the East by the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, on the South by the channel of Stono Inlet, on the west by the\r\nchannel of Folly River and Folly Creek and on the North by the channel of\r\nLighthouse Inlet.\" Attached to the deed is a plat recorded on December 9, 1895,\r\nshowing the property described in the grant. Accordingly, Tract D is included both\r\nin the metes and bounds of the 1918 deed and within the surveyed boundaries of\r\n\nthe 1895 plat. Based on Dreher's deed and subsequent chain of title, Tract D is, by\r\nlegal description, on and a part of Folly Island. 2\r\n\r\nTherefore, the ALC's finding of fact that Tract D is \"geologically, geographically,\r\nand by legal description, on and within the boundaries of Folly Island\" is a\r\nreasonable conclusion supported by substantial evidence based on the expert\r\ntestimony and title evidence presented at the hearing. See Risher v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nHealth & Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 210, 712 S.E.2d 428, 434 (2011) (\"The\r\ncourt's determination of whether or not the Lot is a part of Fripp Island is not a\r\nlegal question that is determined under the rubric of a regulation; instead, it is a\r\nfinding of fact properly left within the purview of the fact finding body, and only\r\nreversible if unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\"); Bursey v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 369 S.C. 176, 188-89, 631 S.E.2d 899, 906\r\n(2006) (stating when conflicting evidence exists as to an issue, the court's\r\nsubstantial evidence standard of review defers to the findings of the fact-finder).\r\n\r\nII. Plain Language of the Regulation\r\n\r\nNext, Dreher contends the ALC erred in determining Tract D was a coastal island\r\nbecause the court relied exclusively on the first sentence of the regulatory\r\ndefinition of coastal island to the exclusion of the subsequent language of the\r\nregulation. We agree.\r\n\r\nRegulation 30-1(D)(11) defines coastal island as \"an area of high ground above the\r\ncritical area delineation that is separated from other high ground areas by coastal\r\ntidelands or waters.\" 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1(D)(11) (Supp. 2011). Here,\r\nthere is no dispute that Tract D is a coastal island as defined in the regulations\r\nbecause Dreher concedes Tract D is a high ground area above the critical line\r\ndelineation separated from the upland immediately adjacent to 806 East Cooper\r\nAvenue by navigable, saline waters. However, the regulation further provides, in\r\npertinent part, that:\r\n\r\n             The purpose of this definition is to include all islands\r\n             except those that are essentially mainland, i.e., those that\r\n\r\n2 The property description found in the eight subsequent deeds, including the grant\r\nto Dreher in 1994, is identical to the original grant to the Folly Island Company in\r\n1918.\r\n\n             already have publicly accessible bridges and/or\r\n             causeways. The following islands shall not be deemed a\r\n             coastal island subject to this section due to their large\r\n             size and developed nature: . . . Folly Island . . . .\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\n\"The primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\nintent of the legislature.\" Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324\r\nS.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996). A statute should be read as a whole. Id.\r\nFurther, \"[s]tatutes which are part of the same legislative scheme should be read\r\ntogether.\" Great Games, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 84, 529 S.E.2d\r\n6, 8 (2000). \"Unless there is something in the statute requiring a different\r\ninterpretation, the words used in a statute must be given their ordinary meaning.\"\r\nMid-State Auto, 324 S.C. at 69, 476 S.E.2d at 692. \"The true guide to statutory\r\nconstruction is not the phraseology of an isolated section or provision, but the\r\nlanguage of the statute as a whole considered in light of its manifest purpose.\"\r\nFloyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 260, 626 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2005).\r\n\r\nAlthough Tract D satisfies the definition of a coastal island in the first sentence of\r\nRegulation 30-1(D)(11) as it is \"an area of high ground above the critical area\r\ndelineation that is separated from other high ground areas by coastal tidelands or\r\nwaters,\" the regulation further provides for certain exclusions, stating the coastal\r\nisland definition does not apply to Folly Island. See § 30-1(D)(11). Based upon\r\nthe ALC's finding that Tract D is a part of Folly Island, we find the regulation,\r\nwhen read in its entirety, supports a finding that Tract D is exempt from the\r\ndefinition of coastal island and thereby exempt from the Small Islands Regulation.\r\nTherefore, the ALC erred in concluding Tract D was not exempt from the\r\ndefinition of coastal island under Regulation 30-1(D)(11).\r\n\r\nIII.   De Minimus Impact\r\n\r\nDreher contends if the Small Island Regulations do not apply to Tract D, she is in\r\ncompliance with 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(F) (Supp. 2011) (the\r\nTransportation Regulation), and the bridge permit should be granted. We agree.\r\n\r\nAlthough DHEC initially filed a motion to reconsider the ALC's finding that \"the\r\nproposed bridge was the least environmentally damaging alternative for access to\r\n\nTract D and, in fact, would have de minimus environmental impact,\" DHEC failed\r\nto challenge the ALC's finding on appeal. Accordingly, the ALC's finding is the\r\nlaw of the case. See Commercial Credit Loans, 334 S.C. at 187, 512 S.E.2d at 129\r\n(holding a lower court's finding was the law of the case because respondent failed\r\nto cross appeal the issue).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the law of the case, there is substantial evidence to support the\r\nALC's finding that the proposed bridge complied with the Transportation\r\nRegulation. The Transportation Regulation provides, in pertinent part, \"the\r\nlocation and design of public and private transportation projects must avoid the\r\ncritical areas to the maximum extent feasible. Where coastal waters and tidelands\r\ncannot be avoided, bridging rather than filling of these areas will be required to the\r\nmaximum extent feasible.\" See § 30-12(F)(2)(b). Because Dreher cannot avoid\r\nthe waters and tidelands, her permit application proposes minimal construction of a\r\nbridge to span the critical area to reach Tract D. Dreher's application also states\r\nthat the cumulative impacts to the environment and surrounding areas would be\r\nminimal and that the proposed bridge represents \"the least damaging and most\r\npracticable alternative for accomplishing the project.\" Accordingly, we find there\r\nis substantial evidence to support the ALC's finding that Dreher's permit\r\napplication complied with the criteria of the Transportation Regulation. See Se.\r\nRes. Recovery, Inc. v. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 402, 407, 595\r\nS.E.2d 468, 470 (2004) (\"Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the\r\nrecord as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the\r\nadministrative agency reached.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIt is the law of the case that Dreher's property is geologically, geographically, and\r\nby legal description on, and a part of, Folly Island. Folly Island is specifically\r\nexempted from the Small Islands Regulation, and as a result, it was error for the\r\nALC to affirm DHEC's denial of Dreher's permit to build a bridge to Tract D. We\r\nfurther conclude the finding that Dreher's permit application to access Tract D\r\ncomplies with the Transportation Regulation is the law of the case. Accordingly,\r\nthe order of the ALC is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
