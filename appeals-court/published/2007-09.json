Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tGary C. Pennington and Jessica Clancy Crowson, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In this declaratory judgment action, Linda Hartough appeals the special refereeâ€™s order finding South Carolina Electric and Gas (SCE&amp;G) has a valid and enforceable option.Â  She also appeals the special refereeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to SCE&amp;G.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 2001, SCE&amp;G entered into a contract with Hartough and Firelight Farm LTD, an entity wholly owned by Hartough, for an option to purchase 213.6 acres of real property (Farm Tract) located in Jasper County.Â  The contract also granted SCE&amp;G an option to purchase whatever interest Hartough had in an adjacent fifty-eight acre tract (Norton Tract). Â Paragraph 12 of the contract provided:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he signing of this Option shall constitute consideration for an exclusive Option for Purchase to acquire any and all fee interest which Linda A. Hartough . . . owns in the adjacent fifty-eight (58) acres . . . with said consideration to be based on the value of $5,000 per acre and $2,500 per acre for high lands and wetlands, respectively.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe option provided that the final purchase price would be determined after an accurate field survey was performed to determine the amount of acreage in the lowlands and highlands and after determining Hartoughâ€™s percentage of ownership in the Norton Tract.Â  SCE&amp;G paid Hartough $25,000 for the option to purchase the Farm and Norton Tracts.Â  Section two of the contract provided the option would be valid until July 6, 2001.Â  The parties later agreed to extend the deadline for the closing on the Farm Tract until September 14, 2001.Â \r\n \r\nWhen the parties signed the option contract in March of 2001, Hartough did not possess any interest in the Norton Tract.Â  It was not until April 12, 2001, when Hartough paid Wanda Johnson $50,000 that she acquired any interest.Â  Johnson was a descendent of John Norton, the original owner of the Norton Tract.Â  At the time of the purchase, the extent of Johnsonâ€™s interest in the Norton Tract was uncertain and Hartoughâ€™s purchase was known as an â€œheirâ€™s share.â€Â  Hartoughâ€™s interest in the Norton Tract could have been anywhere from as little as forty percent to as much as one hundred percent.Â  A month later, Hartough instituted a quiet title and partition action against a plethora of people, mostly heirs of John Norton, who all claimed to have an interest in the property.Â  Her stated reason for filing the action was to determine the extent of her interest in order to sell the property to SCE&amp;G.Â \r\n \r\nOn September 14, 2001, SCE&amp;G purchased the Farm Tract from Hartough for $1,275,000.Â  During the signing of the contract for sale, Catherine Badgett, the attorney representing SCE&amp;G at the closing, became concerned about the option to purchase the Norton Tract and wanted assurances that it would not be extinguished after the purchase of the Farm Tract was completed. Â Thayer Rivers, Hartoughâ€™s attorney, assured Badgett the Norton Tract option still existed.Â  Towards that end, Rivers drafted a letter dated September 19, 2001, confirming the existence of the option to purchase the Norton Tract.Â  The letter provided: Â â€œThis letter is to confirm our agreement that the Norton heir option to the power company is still in existence.Â  As soon as this matter can be heard and the interest of my client determined, we will then set up a closing on that.â€Â \r\n \r\nIn March 2003, SCE&amp;G became concerned regarding the lack of progress in the quiet title action, and it contacted Rivers by letter requesting he reaffirm the Norton Tract option.Â  It appeared none of the parties to the quiet title action had any intention of moving the action forward.Â  The Norton heirs did not want the action to progress because they believed if Hartough was found to have an interest in the property they would all be forced to sell.Â  Hartough did not want to move the action forward because she believed the land in the Norton Tract was worth more per acre than the price originally provided for by the contract.Â  Rivers responded to SCE&amp;G by letter dated March 21, 2003, stating that either the option to the Norton Tract had expired at the time of the expiration of the Farm Tract option, or the Norton Tract option contract had no expiration date, and thus, would not be valid under South Carolina law.Â  \r\n \r\nOn May 15, 2003, SCE&amp;G filed the present action seeking a declaratory judgment that the option to the Norton Tract was valid and enforceable.Â  Additionally, SCE&amp;G sought attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Hartough answered, generally denying the option was valid.Â  \r\n \r\nFollowing a hearing on May 5, 2005, the special referee found the option was valid despite having no date of expiration.Â  The special referee reasoned that under South Carolina law, an option must be exercised in a reasonable time if no time is specified.Â  Therefore, no specified closing date was required.Â  Further, the special referee concluded a reasonable time for the closing of the option would be after the quiet title action determined the extent of Hartoughâ€™s interest.Â  In addition, the special referee awarded SCE&amp;G attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Hartoughâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeclaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable; thus, the standard of review depends on the nature of the underlying issues.Â  Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 279, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Because this action involves the interpretation of a contract, it is an action at law.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc., v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, â€œour scope of review extends merely to the corrections of errors of law.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, this court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings unless they are found to be without evidence that reasonably supports those findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\n \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Validity of Option Contract\r\nHartough alleges the special referee erred in finding the option to the Norton Tract was valid and enforceable.Â  Specifically, Hartough argues the option is unenforceable because the option agreement fails to set a definitive date by which the option must be exercised.Â  We disagree.[2]\r\n\r\n\tGenerally, option contracts have three main characteristics:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) they are unilateral contracts where the optionor, for a valuable consideration, grants the optionee a right to make a contract of purchase but does not bind the optionee to do so; (2) they are continuing offers to sell, irrevocable during the option period; and (3) the transition of an option into a contract of purchase and sale can only be effected by an unqualified and unconditional acceptance of the offer in accordance with the terms and within the time specified in the option contract.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIngram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assoc., 340 S.C. 98, 108, 531 S.E.2d 287, 292 (2000).Â  If the option agreement â€œrequires performance in a certain manner, time is of the essence and exact compliance with the terms of the option [is] required.â€Â  Id.Â  However, if the parties to an option agreement fail to â€œspecify a time for performance, a reasonable time will be implied.â€Â  King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 316, 318 S.E.2d 125, 130 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Lindler v. Adcock, 250 S.C. 383, 158 S.E.2d 192 (1967)); see also 17a Am. Jur. 2nd Contracts Â§ 79 (2004) (â€œ[I]f an option provision fails to impose a time limitation, courts will construe the provision to require that it be exercised within a reasonable time.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nWhether the length of time to exercise an option contract is â€œreasonableâ€ depends on the particular facts and circumstances of a given case.Â  See Wall v. Huguenin, 305 S.C. 100, 103, 406 S.E.2d 347, 349 (1991) (holding that a delay of thirteen years in exercising an option to repurchase family land was not unreasonable, considering the fact that the land was subject to two lawsuits and the option indicated it could be exercised when â€œconvenientâ€ for the optionee); Carroll v. Page, 264 S.C. 345, 351, 215 S.E.2d 203, 206 (1975) (noting that where the option for lessee to purchase the property if the lessor decided to sell it fixed no time for lesseeâ€™s acceptance of the offer to sell, the delay of one year after lessee indicated he only wanted â€œa few daysâ€ to consider the option did not constitute the exercise of the option within a reasonable time); Lindler, 250 S.C. at 388, 158 S.E.2d at 195 (finding the delay of more than nine years after the option ripened was an unreasonable time to exercise the option and stating that â€œ[w]hether there is unreasonable delay in accepting an option or an offer, and whether such delay is explained to the exclusion of negligence depends on all of the surrounding circumstancesâ€); see also Ridglea Interests, Inc. v. Gen. Lumber Co., 343 S.W.2d 490, 493 (Tex. Civ. App. 1961) (noting that a reasonable time is such time as is necessary conveniently to do what the contract requires to be done as soon as circumstances will permit and that what is a reasonable time depends on the nature and character of the thing to be done, the circumstances of the particular case, and the difficulties surrounding its accomplishment).\r\nIn the instant case, the original contract does not specify a term for the expiration of the option.Â  This does not render this option unenforceable, however, because we can imply that the option may be exercised within a reasonable time.Â  As noted in the letter ratifying the option, a reasonable time to exercise the option would be after Hartoughâ€™s interest in the Norton Tract was finally determined. Â Therefore, because the letter ratifying the contract clearly provides a method to determine the date by which the option was to be exercised, we find the special referee properly determined the option does not fail for failure to specify an expiration term because it can be exercised in a â€œreasonable time.â€Â  \r\n \r\nHartough also alleges the special referee erred by determining a reasonable time for the option to be exercised was following the litigation of the quiet title action.Â  Relying on Lindler v. Adcock, 250 S.C. 383, 158 S.E.2d 192 (1967), she contends the quiet title action cannot be concluded within a reasonable time because it had already been stalled for five years and there was no evidence that it would go forward.Â  \r\n \r\nIn Lindler, three physicians executed a written option on downtown property they owned as tenants in common.Â  The 1949 option provided that survivors could buy the interest of any deceased party, or the interest of any party wishing to sell, at the original cost of the property.Â  One physician sold his interest in the property to the remaining two a few years later.Â  In 1955, one of the remaining two physicians died intestate.Â  The final physician did not seek to exercise the option to purchase the deceasedâ€™s interest in the property at the original cost until 1964.Â  The Lindler court found the nine-and-a-half year delay in exercising the option after it ripened was unreasonable.Â  Lindler, 250 S.C. at 388-89, 158 S.E.2d at 194-95.Â  \r\n \r\nHartoughâ€™s reliance on Lindler is misplaced.Â  The physician in Lindler failed to exercise his option until nearly ten years after it had ripened.Â  Hartough points out that she was interested in the Norton Tract for nearly ten years prior to obtaining an interest in the property and that the quiet title action had stalled for nearly five years prior to the hearing before the special referee.Â  Thus, she argues, the long time period in which to exercise the option was unreasonable like the time period in Lindler.Â  As noted in the option itself, SCE&amp;G in the present case cannot exercise the Norton Tract option until Hartoughâ€™s percentage ownership in the property has been determined, a survey performed, and a final price calculated based on her percentage of ownership.Â  Thus, the option will not be ripe until the quiet title action is completed.Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, we are cognizant of the fact that some quiet title actions can take years; however, in the present case, the action has failed to progress because of Hartoughâ€™s own inaction.Â  During her deposition, her response when asked if she had any intention of moving the quiet title action forward was, â€œNo, I donâ€™t have any intentions at all right now.â€Â  In light of the fact Hartough has failed to take any steps which would resolve the underlying action, we agree with the special referee that under the facts and circumstances of this case, a â€œreasonable timeâ€ for the option to be exercised would be after the quiet title action has been adjudicated.\r\nII.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHartough argues the special referee erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  She contends SCE&amp;G is barred from recovering attorneyâ€™s fees because SCE&amp;G did not specifically plead it was seeking attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to the option contract but merely stated it sought attorneyâ€™s fees for bringing the action.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, a party may not recover attorneyâ€™s fees absent a contract or statute. Â Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993).Â  When an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is based upon a contract between the parties, the determination of the fees is left to the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Berger, 365 S.C. 234, 240, 616 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989)).Â  Further, a trial court may award costs in declaratory judgment actions as â€œmay seem equitable and just.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-100 (2005).Â  \r\n \r\nThe contract provided, â€œIn the event litigation is commenced to enforce any rights under this Agreement or to pursue any other remedy available to either party, all reasonable legal expenses and other direct costs of litigation of the prevailing party shall be paid by the other party.â€Â  Although SCE&amp;G made a request in the complaint for â€œan award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs for the maintenance of this action which has been occasioned by [Hartoughâ€™s] actions and conduct,â€ SCE&amp;G did not specifically plead the contract between the parties as the basis for its claim.Â  The special referee awarded SCE&amp;G attorneyâ€™s fees and costs for maintaining the action but reserved determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees until this action has been fully resolved.[3]Â   \r\nWe note the issue of whether a party must specifically plead the basis for seeking attorneyâ€™s fees was not ruled upon by the special referee. Â Â Although Hartough argued in her Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion that attorneyâ€™s fees are not permitted pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, she did not argue SCE&amp;G failed to specifically plead a contractual basis for the award of fees.Â  Therefore, the argument is not preserved for our review.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546 (holding that issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, even if SCE&amp;G did not specifically plead attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to the contract, we find the special referee properly awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  SCE&amp;G commenced the action in order to determine the validity of the option pursuant to the contract.Â  The contract permitted any prevailing party to seek attorneyâ€™s fees in an action to enforce any right under the contract.Â  In addition, the pleadings requested attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Therefore, Hartough was apprised SCE&amp;G would be seeking a recovery of fees if successful.Â  Accordingly, the special referee did not err in awarding fees. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the special referee did not err in concluding a valid and enforceable option existed.Â  Moreover, the special referee properly awarded SCE&amp;G attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Accordingly, the order of the special referee is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Â We note the parties signed the option contract for the Norton Tract prior to Hartough acquiring an interest in the property.Â  However, Hartough only argued before the special referee that the option failed for not stating an expiration date.Â Â  \r\n \r\n[3]&nbsp; The record on this point is somewhat unclear because it does not contain a signed order continuing the issue of the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, both parties seem to agree the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees is to be settled at a later date.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4293","title":"Penny Creek Associates v.

townhomes; apartment homes; commercial activities; and such other activities as may be approved by Penny Creek.Â  Another section of the covenants and restrictions provided as follows:\r\n\r\n\tSection 3.02Â  Subdivision, Re-Platting, and Lot Specifications\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(a)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNo Lot or Parcel shall be \r\n\t\t\tsubdivided or its boundary lines changed, nor shall application for \r\n\t\t\tsame be made to the City of Charleston, except with [Penny Creekâ€™s] \r\n\t\t\tprior, written consent, which such consent may be granted or \r\n\t\t\twithheld in the sole discretion of [Penny Creek], its successors and \r\n\t\t\tassigns.&nbsp; However, [Penny Creek] hereby expressly reserves for \r\n\t\t\titself, its successors and assigns, the right to replat any of the Property if [Penny Creek] determines, in its sole discretion, that the reconfiguration, alteration, or other adjustment of Property lines and boundaries would improve or enhance the value and/or aesthetic appearance of Fenwick Hall Plantation or any part thereof.Â  Provided, however, that upon the execution of a contract of sale between [Penny Creek] and a proposed purchaser of any Lot or Parcel, [Penny Creek] shall no longer have the right to replat or otherwise alter the property lines of such Lot or Parcel under contract, unless such proposed purchaser defaults under the terms of the contract.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(b)\r\n\t\t\tAny Lot or Parcel may, with \r\n\t\t\t[Penny Creekâ€™s] written approval, be combined to create a larger Lot \r\n\t\t\tor Parcel, and in such instance, [Penny Creek] may alter, without \r\n\t\t\tlimitation, the specifications and guidelines affecting the Lot or \r\n\t\t\tParcel.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Fenwick Tarragon decided to convert the apartments into condominiums, and it took steps towards upgrading, financing, and marketing the project.Â  Penny Creek learned of the project and demanded that Fenwick Tarragon first obtain Penny Creekâ€™s written consent for the conversion pursuant to the covenants and restrictions.[2]Â  Fenwick Tarragon believed that it did not need permission, and it proceeded with the project.Â  \r\n \r\nOn July 14, 2005, Penny Creek brought a declaratory judgment action against Fenwick Tarragon requesting the circuit court declare that the conversion of the apartments into condominiums amounted to a subdivision of the property without Penny Creekâ€™s permission and was in violation of the covenants and restrictions.Â  Penny Creek also sought both a temporary and permanent injunction on any further violations of the covenants and restrictions.Â  Fenwick Tarragon also filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that it had not violated the covenants and restrictions, which was later dismissed by consent of the parties.Â  On July 21, 2005, Penny Creek filed another motion for an injunction, specifically requesting that the court prohibit Fenwick Tarragon from continuing with the condominium project.Â  Fenwick Tarragon filed its answer and counterclaim, denying that it had violated the covenants and restrictions, asserting that the conversion from apartments to condominiums did not amount to the subdivision or the alteration of the boundary lines, and requesting a declaration to that effect.Â Â  Penny Creekâ€™s motion for a temporary injunction was denied.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nFenwick Tarragon filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the circuit court.Â  Fenwick Tarragon moved to expedite the hearing of the matter, and the parties consented to the case being transferred to the master.Â  Both parties made new motions for summary judgment, and the case was heard before the master on June 22, 2006.Â  After the hearing, the master granted summary judgment to Fenwick Tarragon, finding its actions did not violate the covenants and restrictions and did not amount to a subdivision of the property.Â  This appeal followed. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  However, summary judgment is not appropriate where there is no dispute as to the facts but the parties dispute the inferences to be drawn from those facts.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Osborne ex rel. Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nPenny Creek argues the master erred in determining the conversion of the apartments into condominiums did not require Penny Creekâ€™s prior consent.Â  Penny Creek asserts:Â  the stipulated language of the covenants required prior consent in order to subdivide the property; the creation of a condominium is a subdivision of the property; and the master erred in finding otherwise.Â  We disagree.\r\nRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature, and thus, the language used in the restrictive covenant is to be construed according to its plain and ordinary meaning.Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006).Â  However, restrictions on the use of property are historically disfavored.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1987).Â  â€œThus, to enforce a restrictive covenant, a party must show that the restriction applies to the property either by the covenantâ€™s express language or by a plain unmistakable implication.â€Â  Rhodes v. Palmetto Pathway Homes, Inc., 303 S.C. 308, 311, 400 S.E.2d 484, 485 (1991).Â  â€œRestrictions on the use of property will be strictly construed with all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, although the rule of strict construction should not be used to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the restrictive covenants.â€Â  Hardy, 369 S.C. at 166, 631 S.E.2d at 542.Â  \r\n \r\nThe master in the present case found that the relevant language of the covenants and restrictions was clear and unambiguous.Â  Reviewing the language of the covenants and restrictions, the master found that the restriction on subdividing the property without obtaining the prior written consent of Penny Creek applied only to the subdivision of the land and did not apply to the division of the landownersâ€™ ownership interest in the property.Â  The master further found that the covenants and restrictions did not specifically bar the use of a parcel for condominiums and changing apartments to condominiums did not amount to a change in use.Â  Noting that Penny Creek did not specify in the restrictions that property could not be used for condominiums, the master found Fenwick Terragon did not need to seek permission prior to converting the apartments and ordered that the conversion could proceed.Â Â  \r\n \r\nWe agree with the master.Â  The plain language of section 3.02 of the covenants and restrictions indicates a clear intention to prevent any change of the size or boundary of the property or land itself when it required prior permission for the subdivision or alteration of the boundary lines of a lot or parcel.Â  Within the same subsection that requires prior written permission before property lines can be altered, Penny Creek reserved for itself the right to replat property or change the boundary lines in a manner to improve the value and aesthetic appearance of Fenwick Hall Plantation.Â  Section 3.02(a).Â  Further, the next subsection also deals with altering boundary lines of property by providing that written permission is also required when attempting to combine lots or parcels to create one larger one.Â  Section 3.02(b).Â  This conclusion is further bolstered by the definitions of â€œlotâ€ and â€œparcelâ€ contained within the covenants and restrictions.[3]Â  Thus, a clear reading of the controlling section of the covenants and restrictions indicates that Penny Creek wished to control only a subdivision of land which would alter boundary lines in such a manner as would change the size of a building lot or parcel.Â  Nothing in the section indicates Penny Creek was retaining the power to prevent conversion of an approved apartment complex into a condominium complex.[4]Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, Penny Creek argues that prior caselaw provides that the conversion of an apartment into a condominium amounts to a subdivision of property such that the restriction in the current case would prevent the conversion without prior written permission.Â  Penny Creek first cites Harrington v. Blackston, 319 S.C. 1, 459 S.E.2d 309 (Ct. App. 1995), vacated by 322 S.C. 470, 473 S.E.2d 47 (1996), for the proposition that converting a property to a condominium-style of ownership subdivides the property horizontally and vertically.Â  In Harrington, this court noted that an owner of a fee or leasehold interest in property could declare it to be subject to a condominium form of ownership by following the requirements set out in the Horizontal Property Regime Act. Â This court noted that â€œ[u]pon the proper recordation of these documents, the declarantâ€™s interest in the property subject to the declaration is subdivided both horizontally and vertically.â€Â  Harrington, 319 S.C. at 5, 459 S.E.2d at 311 (citing 15A Am.Jur.2d Condominiums Â§ 14 (1976)).Â  \r\n \r\nIgnoring the fact that this opinion has been vacated,[5] we agree with the master that this case holds that conversion to a condominium divides an ownership interest in the property but does not subdivide the land itself.Â  In other words, while an owner of an apartment complex grants sole ownership of individual units to purchasers after converting the building to a condominium, the property and common areas remain intact and the owner merely grants a share of his ownership interest in these areas to purchasers.Â  Thus, the owners of individual units share ownership of the property/common areas as tenants in common.Â  The property itself is not subdivided or replatted, nor does the â€œfootprintâ€ of the property change.Â  Accordingly, we find Harrington is completely consistent with prior caselaw that converting apartments into condominiums divides the ownership interest in the underlying property and does not amount to a subdivision of the underlying parcel or lot.Â  See Baker, 279 S.C. at 584, 310 S.E.2d at 435 (finding â€œuntenableâ€ the argument that converting an apartment complex into a condominium would create twenty separate lots and noting that the â€œHorizontal Property Act provides that the ownership of the land upon which is built a condominium is held as co-tenants by the owners, but not subject to partitionâ€).\r\nPenny Creek next argues that this court has previously found that conversion to a condominium amounted to a subdivision of property in Houck v. Rivers, 316 S.C. 414, 450 S.E.2d 106 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In Houck, three separate buildings on one property -- a large house, a kitchen house, and a carriage house -- were converted into individual condominiums.Â  In describing the conversion, this court stated:Â  â€œIn order to subdivide the property, the owners designated it a condominium regime, although each unit is entirely separate.â€Â  Houck, 316 S.C. at 415, 450 S.E.2d at 108.Â  However, the issue before the Houck court was whether an owner of one of the units was violating the covenants and restrictions by operating a bed and breakfast out of her home.Â  Id. at 417, 450 S.E.2d at 109.Â  It is clear to this court that the quoted language, while appearing to support Penny Creekâ€™s position, is only a recitation of the facts of the case and has no precedential value whatsoever.Â Â  \r\n \r\nFinally, Penny Creek cites to Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 202 S.E.2d 363 (1974), to support its argument that a condominium conversion is a subdivision of property.Â  In Hoffman, a landowner proposed to build a sixty-two unit high-rise condominium building on his property within a residential subdivision at the beach.Â  The subdivisionâ€™s covenants and restrictions provided that:Â  residences could not extend beyond the boundary lines; the property could be used for residential uses only; and the lot could not be subdivided, or its boundary lines changed, without prior written consent of the grantor.Â  Id. at 74, 202 S.E.2d at 365.Â  The circuit court found that building a condominium complex would be a permissible use within the subdivision.Â  The Hoffman court reversed, finding the covenants ambiguous and construing the overall scheme of the neighborhood as permitting only single-family residences.Â  Id. at 77-78, 202 S.E.2d at 366.Â  The court noted that it was not deciding whether an apartment building would be permitted under the restrictions, and it further noted that a condominium complex would essentially be â€œa commercial-type operation, inconsistent, we think, with the whole tenor of restrictions.â€Â  Id. at 76, 202 S.E.2d at 366.Â  \r\n \r\nWe find Penny Creekâ€™s reliance upon Hoffman is misplaced.Â  Although the covenants and restrictions in Hoffman were similar to the ones in the present case, the court did not rule on the question of subdividing property, the Hoffman restrictions did not specify that multi-family residences could be built, and the Hoffman court had to look outside the language of the ambiguous restrictions to determine that the overall scheme of the neighborhood was for single-family residences.Â  The present case is distinguishable in that the parties stipulate the language of the restrictions is not ambiguous, the covenants and restrictions specify that a multi-family apartment complex may be built, and thus, the overall â€œtenorâ€ of the restrictions does not bar a multi-family residence, be it an apartment complex or a condominium complex.[6]Â   \r\nIn conclusion, we find the conversion of an apartment building to condominiums amounts to the division of the ownership interest in the underlying property/common areas; it does not amount to the subdivision of the underlying land, parcel, or lot.Â  Reading the covenants and restrictions as a whole in the present case, we find the requirement for permission prior to subdividing a â€œlot or parcelâ€ applied only to the land and did not apply to conversion of an apartment complex into condominiums.Â  Our caselaw does not hold that condominium conversion amounts to subdividing the underlying property.Â  Because the conversion did not amount to a subdivision under the covenants and restrictions or under our caselaw, we find Fenwick Tarragon did not need to seek permission from Penny Creek prior to conversion.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the master-in-equityâ€™s order granting summary judgment is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Fenwick Tarragon alleges in its brief that it actually sought permission from Penny Creek, despite the belief that no permission was necessary, but Penny Creek demanded $1,300,000 before it would grant permission.Â  Although an affidavit in the record indicates that Penny Creek requested â€œsubstantial sumsâ€ before consenting to the conversion, nothing in the record indicates the actual amount of the demand.Â Â  Â \r\n[3]Â  â€œLotâ€ is defined in the covenants and restrictions as â€œany lot, whether improved or unimproved, which may be independently owned and conveyed, which is shown on a recorded plat of the Property and designated for use as a building area or site for the construction of a single-family dwelling.â€Â  â€œParcelâ€ is defined as â€œany property, whether improved or unimproved, which may be independently owned and conveyed, and which is shown on a recorded plat of the Property and designated for use as a building area site for the construction of apartment homes, townhomes, or commercial buildings.â€Â  \r\n \r\n[4]Â  Although the question of whether the conversion amounts to a change in the approved â€œuseâ€ is not before this court, the master noted that section 3.01 of the covenants and restrictions provided that property could be used for, among other uses, apartments.Â  The master found that:Â  there had been no change in use in the present case; and the words â€œapartmentâ€ and â€œcondominiumâ€ were used interchangeably in the Horizontal Property Regime Act.Â  See Baker v. Town of Sullivanâ€™s Island, 279 S.C. 581, 584, 310 S.E.2d 433, 435-36 (Ct. App. 1983) (holding that town erred in denying approval of conversion of apartment building to condominium pursuant to a zoning ordinance because â€œthe conversion from an apartment building to condominiums constitute[ed] a change of ownership, rather than a change in useâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-20(c) (2007) (referring to condominiums as apartments).Â  \r\n \r\n[5]Â  Penny Creek seems to argue that the Harrington opinion is good law because it was vacated due to a settlement between the parties and not reversed by the supreme court.Â Â  \r\n \r\n[6]Â  We find untenable Penny Creekâ€™s argument that the condominium complex would violate the â€œwhole tenor of restrictionsâ€ and be out of character for the neighborhood in light of the fact that Penny Creek approved the original apartment building plans and later approved the building of a separate condominium complex within the same subdivision.Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4294","title":"SCDSS v.

Â The family court assented to Daughter remaining in the custody of DSS.Â  Further, the family court held Mother could apply to the Sumter County Family Court for the appointment of a lawyer if she desired a lawyer but could not afford one.Â Â \r\n \r\nOn July 26, 2001, the family court held a probable cause hearing.Â  The court then issued an order on August 14, 2001, finding probable cause existed to place Daughter in the care of DSS pending the merits hearing.Â  The family court ordered that Daughter should remain in the custody of DSS, that Mother must cooperate with DSS, and that Mother could have supervised visitation with Daughter.Â \r\n \r\nOn August 20, 2001, Douglas Ritz, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, re-evaluated Mother.Â  Dr. Ritz determined Motherâ€™s intellectual skills were in the mentally deficient range.Â  Dr. Ritz recommended an intervention program to teach Mother how to prevent further abusive situations for her children.Â \r\n \r\nPrior to the merits hearing on August 27, 2001, the family court asked Mother if she had retained an attorney.Â  Mother responded that she did not have an attorney, but she wanted to be represented by counsel.Â  DSS objected to delaying the hearing because Mother had the opportunity to obtain counsel and DSS had an out of town witness.Â  The family court reminded Mother she was advised at the probable cause hearing how to obtain counsel and denied her request for a continuance.Â  Subsequently, the parties reached an agreement, which was approved by the family court, granting custody of Daughter to DSS and visitation to Mother.Â \r\n \r\nThe case was reviewed six months after the August 2001 order.Â  At the February 2002 hearing, the family court approved an agreement that continued custody with DSS and allowed Mother to have extended visitation with Daughter.Â \r\n \r\nAt the second review hearing on August 15, 2002, the family court stated Motherâ€™s visits with Daughter were sporadic, and Motherâ€™s apartment was not suitable for Daughter.Â  Further, Daughterâ€™s Guardian ad Litem recommended terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  The family court ordered DSS to initiate an action for TPR within ninety days and reduced Motherâ€™s visitation to once a month.Â \r\n \r\nOn April 10, 2003, the family court approved DSSâ€™s permanent plan for TPR and adoption. Â Since DSS had not filed for TPR within ninety days as ordered in August 2002, the case was set to be reviewed six months later in December 2003.Â  In the December 2003 order, the family court required DSS to file for TPR by January 1, 2004.Â  The court also noted that Mother missed two of her last six visits with Daughter.Â \r\n \r\nOn October 2, 2004, the family court terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights to Daughter based on his failure to visit or support Daughter and his failure to attend parenting and anger management classes.Â  The court declined to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights, but it ordered DSS to provide specialized services consistent with Motherâ€™s disabilities and need for housing. Â At Fatherâ€™s TPR hearing, Mother was represented by counsel and a Guardian ad Litem.\r\n \r\nOn April 18, 2006, the family court held a final hearing and determined Motherâ€™s rights to Daughter should be terminated.Â  At the hearing, Dr. Patrick Goldsmith testified regarding his psychological evaluation of Mother from March 2006.Â  Based on his evaluation, Dr. Goldsmith believed Mother was mildly mentally retarded and stated that Mother â€œdoes not believe she has a problem sufficient enough to go to therapy.â€Â  \r\n \r\nÂ The family court terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights based on (1) a finding of harm to Daughter under South Carolina Code section 20-7-490 (Supp. 2006); (2) neglect under South Carolina Code section 20-7-1572(1) (Supp. 2006); (3) failure to remedy conditions leading to Daughterâ€™s removal under section 20-7-1572(2); (4) Motherâ€™s diagnosable condition under section 20-7-1572(6); and (5) Daughterâ€™s custody with DSS for fifteen of the last twenty-two months under section 20-7-1572(8).Â  This appeal follows.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is paramount.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before terminating parental rights, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); SCDSS v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this Court may review the record and make its own determination of whether the termination grounds are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  SCDSS v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite the broad scope of review, this Court should not wholly disregard the family courtâ€™s findings because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Due Process\r\nMother argues DSS denied her due process and equal protection by seeking removal of Daughter when Mother is functionally illiterate, has borderline intellectual skills, and has not been provided a Guardian ad Litem or an attorney.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this issue is abandoned because Mother makes a conclusory argument without citation of any authority to support her claim.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514&nbsp;(1994); R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 S.E.2d 113, 120&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).\r\nAdditionally, our Supreme Court has declined to address an alleged violation of due process when the family court terminates parental rights pursuant to section 20-7-1572.Â  SCDSS v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 633-34, 627 S.E.2d 718, 723-24 (2006); see also SCDSS v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 613, 582 S.E.2d 419, 425 (2003).Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights pursuant to South Carolina Code sections 20-7-1572(1), (2), (6), and (8) as well as a finding that termination was in the best interest of Daughter, and therefore, we need not address this argument.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, section 20-7-1570(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) requires appointment of counsel for a parent involved in a TPR case if the parent cannot afford representation.Â  In the case at hand, the family court instructed Mother in 2001 to apply to the Sumter County Family Court for the appointment of counsel.Â  Mother failed to do this as noted by a subsequent order in September 2001.Â  Despite family court orders, DSS failed to file for TPR until January 2004.Â  However, the family court noted Motherâ€™s disabilities and declined to terminate Motherâ€™s rights at the TPR hearing in October 2004.Â  At both TPR hearings, Mother was represented by counsel and a Guardian ad Litem.Â  Therefore, DSS did not violate her due process rights.Â \r\n \r\nII. Specialized Services\r\nMother argues DSS failed to offer specialized services to Mother as ordered by the family court in 2004.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nAgain, Mother fails to cite any authority to support this argument.Â  Therefore, this issue is deemed abandoned.Â  See McLean, 314 S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514.\r\nEven if Mother properly preserved this issue, we find DSS properly provided specialized services to Mother.Â  At Fatherâ€™s TPR hearing in October 2004, the family court ordered DSS â€œto provide specialized services to [Mother] consistent with her disabilities and need for housing.â€Â  DSS referred Mother to Sumter Housing Authority in October 2004, to vocational rehabilitation in October 2004, to the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs in 2004, and to Healthy Minds in September 2005.Â  We hold that these referrals comply with the family courtâ€™s order.\r\nIII. Expert Advice\r\nMother argues DSSâ€™s reasons for TPR are disingenuous because DSS experts advised treatment for Motherâ€™s diagnosable condition, which DSS purportedly did not follow.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nMother fails to cite any authority to support this conclusory argument.Â  Therefore, this issue is deemed abandoned.Â  Id.\r\nEven if Mother properly preserved this issue, we find DSSâ€™s actions were consistent with its expertsâ€™ advice.Â  Mother appears to argue that DSSâ€™s reasons for TPR are in fact the fault of DSSâ€™s failure to follow its expertsâ€™ advice in compliance with the October 2004 family court order.\r\n \r\nIn April 2006, the family court terminated Motherâ€™s parental rights upon finding (1) Daughter or another child in the home suffered harm or neglect, making it unlikely that the home would be made safe within twelve months; (2) Daughter was in DSSâ€™s custody over six months, and Mother had not remedied the conditions causing the removal; (3) Mother had a diagnosable condition preventing her from providing minimally acceptable care to Daughter, and the condition was unlikely to change in a reasonable time period; and (4) Daughter had been in DSS custody for fifteen of the last twenty-two months.Â  Additionally, the family court determined termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights was in Daughterâ€™s best interest.Â \r\n \r\nThe reasons for TPR are interconnected, stemming from Motherâ€™s dependency problems and mild mental retardation.Â  In 2000, 2001, and 2006, Mother was independently diagnosed with borderline intellectual functioning, mild mental retardation, depressed mood, and dependent personality traits.Â  The dependent personality traits paired with mild mental retardation are likely the reason Mother neglected Son and failed to recognize the seriousness of his abuse.Â  Motherâ€™s failure to comprehend Sonâ€™s abuse was part of the reason the family court initially removed Daughter in 2001.Â \r\n \r\nMother has failed to address these mental disorders despite the availability of counseling through DSS, including a counselor who provided therapy at Motherâ€™s intellectual level.Â  The record indicates Mother failed to make appointments for treatment in 2005.Â  Also, in 2005, a doctor suggested Mother take medication for her conditions, but Mother failed to do so.Â  At trial, Dr. Goldsmith, a psychologist who evaluated Mother in March 2006, testified he did not believe Motherâ€™s diagnosable condition would change until â€œshe believes that this is a problem and that she believes that she needs to go to therapy.â€Â  Therefore, the satisfaction of the TPR statutory elements does not arise from DSSâ€™s alleged failure to listen to its experts.\r\nIV. Accessible Services for the Disabled\r\nMother argues DSS had a duty to offer accessible services to Mother under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because DSS knew of Motherâ€™s disabilities.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThe ADA states in part, â€œSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.â€Â  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 12132 (Supp. 2006).Â  The ADA defines a public entity as â€œany department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.â€Â  Â§ 12131(1)(B).Â  Further, a qualified individual with a disability is â€œan individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.â€Â  Â§ 12131(2).\r\nPreviously, this Court addressed an argument that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act), 29 U.S.C.A. section 701, et seq. (Supp. 1976), required DSS to provide social and rehabilitative services for mentally deficient parents.Â  SCDSS v. Humphreys, 297 S.C. 118, 122, 374 S.E.2d 922, 925 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In Humphreys, the motherâ€™s IQ was 66, which was in the mildly mentally deficient range of intelligence.Â  Id. at 119, 374 S.E.2d at 923.Â  This Court rejected the motherâ€™s argument that TPR should not occur because DSS failed to provide parenting services tailored to the motherâ€™s needs.Â  Id. at 122, 374 S.E.2d at 925.Â  We found the purpose of the Act was â€œto insure that benefits are not denied based upon a handicap,â€ rather than â€œ[to] provide parental training for mentally deficient parents.â€Â  Id. Â Consequently, when a parent clearly suffers from a diagnosable condition that prevents the parent from providing minimally acceptable care for the child, the Act is not a defense to granting TPR.Â  Id. at 122, 374 S.E.2d at 924-25.Â Â  Our resolution of DSSâ€™s duty to provide parental services under the Act is instructive in determining DSSâ€™s responsibility to mentally disabled parents under the ADA.[2]\r\nWhile we have yet to uncover any South Carolina case law on whether the ADA requires DSS to make reasonable accommodations and provide services to a parent with mental deficiencies, North Carolina has recently addressed this issue in In the Matter of C.M.S., 646 S.E.2d 592 (N.C. App. 2007).Â  In C.M.S., the family court removed the child because the motherâ€™s boyfriend sexually abused the child, and the mother failed to prevent this abuse.Â  646 S.E.2d at 594.Â  The family court subsequently terminated motherâ€™s parental rights, finding the mother willfully left the child in foster care for more than twelve months without reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to the childâ€™s initial removal.Â  Id. at 595-96.Â  These conditions included the motherâ€™s mental and emotional instability, her inability to locate safe, appropriate housing and maintain a stable source of income, and her failure to prevent contact between the child and the abusive boyfriend.Â  Id. at 594.\r\nOn appeal, the mother claimed the ADA required â€œthe state to make reasonable accommodations and provide services to assist a person with mental retardation to exercise their constitutionally protected rights.â€Â  Id. at 595.Â  Citing to In re Terry, 610 N.W.2d 563, 569 (2000), the court noted that while â€œâ€˜mental retardation is a â€˜disabilityâ€™ within the meaning of the ADA . . . [s]everal courts have concluded that termination proceedings are not â€˜services, programs or activitiesâ€™ under the ADA, and the ADA does not apply in termination proceedings as a defense to the termination of parental rights.â€™â€ Id.Â  The C.M.S. court agreed with Terry, finding that if the state has made â€œreasonable effortsâ€ to correct the conditions that initiated the stateâ€™s involvement, the state properly satisfies the ADAâ€™s requirement for reasonably accommodating disabilities.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nSimilar to North Carolina, our legislature requires the family court to issue a finding of whether DSS has made reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the child from his or her home and whether the childâ€™s continuation in the home would be contrary to the childâ€™s welfare.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(I) (Supp. 2006).\r\nIn the case at hand, the family court made such a finding.Â  First, DSSâ€™s numerous attempts to rehabilitate Mother, by way of counseling and therapy, indicate it made reasonable efforts to prevent Daughterâ€™s removal.Â  Further, the counseling services provided to Mother were adapted to Motherâ€™s mental abilities.Â  Motherâ€™s failure to schedule appointments, even though Mother demonstrated the capacity to schedule appointments in the past, was not a failure on the part of DSS.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAs in Humphreys and C.M.S., TPR was granted for several reasons, including Motherâ€™s diagnosable condition.Â  Mother has an IQ of 73, and her intellectual skills are within mentally deficient and borderline limits. Â In addition to Motherâ€™s mental limitations, Mother has a dependent personality disorder, which is unlikely to change.Â  \r\n \r\nThus, DSS provided reasonable services to Mother; however, Motherâ€™s diagnosable conditions subsisted, at least in part due to her own actions.Â  If a parent suffers from a diagnosable condition, the family court may pursue TPR.Â  Although these conditions may in fact be disabilities, the existence of the ADA does not prevent TPR when it is in the childâ€™s best interest and DSS makes reasonable efforts to remedy any conditions leading to the childâ€™s removal.Â  See Â§ 20-7-1572(6); Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735. \r\n \r\nV. Local Limitations of ServicesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMother argues Sumter Countyâ€™s limitation of available services is not an excuse for DSSâ€™s failure to provide specialized services for Mother.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs previously stated, Mother was referred to other organizations for their services, Mother received counseling adjusted to her mental level, and Mother received parenting classes in an attempt to help Mother provide acceptable care to her children.Â  Therefore, DSS met its duty to provide specialized services to Mother. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The names of the minor children and the respective defendants have been changed to protect the minorsâ€™ identities.\r\n[2] Â See Diane L.

Smith, Jr. and Elizabeth Smith (the Smiths) were involved in an automobile\r\n    accident with an uninsured motorist.Â  Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company\r\n    (Nationwide) brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether the\r\n    insurance policy covering the vehicle in which the Smiths were riding was void\r\n    for lack of an insurable interest.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in\r\nfavor of the Smiths.Â  Nationwide appeals.[1]Â  \r\n  FACTS\r\n  \r\n  On October 29, 2003, the Smiths were\r\n    involved in a motor vehicle accident in Lexington County, South Carolina.Â  At\r\n    the time of the accident, James W. Smith, Jr. was driving and Elizabeth Smith\r\n    was a passenger in a 1999 Montero Sport (Montero) owned by James W. Smith, Jr.Â \r\n    The accident was caused when Martha Lawrence (Lawrence) collided with the\r\n    vehicle in front of the Smiths and then hit the Smiths causing the Montero to\r\n    overturn.Â  Lawrence was driving an uninsured vehicle.Â  As a result of the\r\n    accident the Smiths pursued uninsured motorist claims on the Nationwide Policy\r\n    Number: 61 39 K 931345.Â  \r\n  At the\r\n    time of the accident, the Montero was a listed vehicle on the Nationwide Policy\r\n    Number: 61 39 K 931345.Â  While the Montero was owned by and registered to James\r\n    W. Smith, Jr., the Nationwide policy covering the Montero was taken out and\r\n    owned by his father, James W. Smith, Sr. (Father).[2]Â  Father was the named insured under\r\n    the policy, which provided uninsured motorist (UM) coverage in the amounts of\r\n    $50,000 per person and $100,000 per occurrence.Â  The policy also covered a 1992\r\n    Ford Ranger (Ranger), owned by Father and his grandson, Christopher Smith.Â  The\r\n    UM policy covering the Ranger also provided UM coverage in the amounts of\r\n    $50,000 per person and $100,000 per occurrence.Â  In addition to Father, the\r\n    policy listed drivers Elizabeth Smith and Christopher Smith.[3]Â  \r\n  Nationwide\r\n    denied coverage and filed a declaratory judgment action for a determination\r\n    that the policy covering the Montero was void for lack of an insurable interest.Â \r\n    The Smiths answered and counterclaimed.Â  Both Nationwide and the Smiths filed\r\n    motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  At the hearing, Nationwide sought a declaration that the policy\r\n    was void as to the Montero and the Smiths were precluded from collecting UM coverage\r\n    from that policy.Â  Nationwide argued Father lacked an insurable interest in the\r\n    vehicle because he did not own the Montero, did not control the Montero, or was\r\n    not responsible for or could be held liable for its operation or use.Â  Nationwide\r\n    also raised the issue as to whether the Smiths would be entitled to UM coverage\r\n    under the Rangerâ€™s policy.Â  Nationwide noted four cases addressing the issue\r\n    were pending before the supreme court.Â  Depending on the outcome of the pending\r\n    cases, Nationwide argued the Smiths would either be entitled to nothing or the\r\n    basic statutory limit of $15,000 per person, $30,000 per occurrence.Â  \r\n  The\r\n    Smiths argued because they used the Montero to transport Father, Father\r\n    benefited from its use and therefore had an insurable interest in the Montero.Â \r\n    Regardless, they averred the insurable interest requirement for liability\r\n    coverage was irrelevant when dealing with UM coverage. Â Because the uninsured\r\n    motorist statute mandates insurers to provide UM coverage to the named insured\r\n    and resident relatives of the named insuredâ€™s household at all times, the Smiths\r\n    claimed the insurable interest argument had no bearing on UM coverage. Â \r\n  The trial court found the insurable interest requirement for\r\n    liability insurance was irrelevant to the case as the issue before the court\r\n    dealt with UM coverage and not liability coverage.Â  The trial court characterized\r\n    Nationwideâ€™s position as an attempt to circumvent the statutory mandate that\r\n    automobile insurance carriers must provide UM coverage on all policies issued.Â \r\n    The trial court concluded the Smiths were entitled to $50,000 per person,\r\n    $100,000 per occurrence in UM coverage on the Montero and that James W. Smith,\r\n    Jr. and Elizabeth Smith each could stack the $50,000 UM coverage provided on\r\n    the Montero policy and the $50,000 UM coverage provided on the Ranger.Â  The\r\n    total coverage available to each was held to be $100,000 for a total of\r\n$200,000 in UM coverage for the occurrence. Â \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  When reviewing\r\n    the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard of\r\n    review as the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP. Â Cowburn v. Leventis,\r\n    366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine\r\n    issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as\r\n    a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  To\r\n    determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing court must\r\n    consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable\r\n    to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 368 S.C.\r\n    424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  \r\n  When\r\n    plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot\r\n    differ, summary judgment should be granted.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C.\r\n    509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, summary judgment is\r\n    not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable\r\n    to clarify the application of the law. Â Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co.,\r\n    370 S.C. 578, 588, 635 S.E.2d 649, 654 (Ct. App. 2006). Â Even when there is no\r\n    dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences\r\n    to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Â Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746\r\n(Ct. App. 2004).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n  Nationwide\r\n    claims the trial court erred in holding the insurable interest requirement for\r\n    liability insurance was irrelevant when dealing with UM coverage. Â We agree.Â  \r\n  Initially, we note that in South Carolina all automobile insurance\r\n    policies are statutorily required to contain UM coverage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    38-77-150 (2002) (requiring all automobile insurance policies contain a\r\n    provision to protect against damages an\r\n    insured is legally entitled to recover which â€œarise out of the ownership,\r\n    maintenance or useâ€ of an uninsured vehicle). Â South Carolina mandates that UM coverage must be provided\r\n    in an amount equal to the minimum liability limits, id., and requires insurance\r\n    carriers to offer, at the option of the insured, UM coverage up to the limits\r\n    of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002). Â Thus,\r\n    UM coverage does not exist in and of itself, but rather is a requirement of and\r\n    dependent on a valid automobile insurance policy.Â  \r\n  An\r\n    automobile insurance policy, like other forms of insurance, must be supported\r\n    by an insurable interest in the named insured.Â  American Mut. Fire Ins. Co.\r\n    v. Passmore, 275 S.C. 618, 620, 274 S.E.2d 416, 417 (1981) (citations\r\n    omitted); Couch on Insurance\r\n    3d Â§41:1 (2005) (stating,â€œ[t]oday, it is universally held, either by force of\r\n    statute or upon public policy grounds, that insurable interest is necessary to\r\n    the validity of a policy, no matter what the subject matter.â€). Â â€œThe insurable interest required does not depend\r\n    upon the named insured having either a legal or equitable interest in the\r\n    property, â€˜but it is enough that the insured may be held liable for damages to\r\n    its operation and use.â€™â€Â  Passmore, 275 S.C. at 620-21, 274 S.E.2d at\r\n    417-18 (quoting Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Douglas, 273 S.C. 243,\r\n    255, 255 S.E.2d 828 (1979)(Lewis, C.J., dissenting)). Â Where a named insured\r\n    does not have any insurable interest in the vehicle, the insurance policy is\r\n    illegal.Â  Id. at 621-22, 274 S.E.2d at 418.Â  Thus, liability insurance is dependent\r\n    upon an insurable interest and since liability insurance cannot be issued\r\n    without UM coverage, UM coverage, consequently, is indirectly dependent on the\r\n    existence of an insurable interest. \r\n  The trial court ignored the requirement that an individual must\r\n    have an insurable interest in the vehicle in which he seeks coverage by making\r\n    a distinction between liability coverage and UM coverage.Â  The court based its\r\n    distinction on Unisun Insurance Company v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529\r\n    S.E.2d 280 (2000) and Hogan v. Home Insurance Company, 260 S.C. 157, 194\r\n    S.E.2d 890 (1973).Â  In both cases, the insurance company involved attempted to\r\n    exclude UM coverage to an insured under a valid policy.Â Â  \r\n  In Schmidt, the defendant, a guest of the named insured, was\r\n    injured while riding in the named insuredâ€™s vehicle while driven by an\r\n    unauthorized driver.Â  339 S.C. at 364-65, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  The insurance\r\n    company attempted to exclude coverage because once the vehicle was driven\r\n    without permission it was no longer covered under the policy.Â  Id. at 365, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  This court denied coverage, finding when the vehicle\r\n    was driven without permission it no longer was a vehicle â€œto which the policy\r\n    applied.â€Â  Id.Â  The definition of insured under South Carolina Code Ann.\r\n    Â§38-77-30(7) defines â€œinsuredâ€ to mean, â€œthe named insured and, while resident\r\n    of the same household, the spouse of any named insured and relatives . . . and\r\n    any person who uses with the consent. . . the motor vehicle to which the policy\r\n    applies.â€Â  The supreme court found the â€œmotor vehicle to which the policy\r\n    appliesâ€ is â€œthe motor vehicle designated in the policyâ€ and thus are words of\r\n    identification and not words of exclusion.Â  Id. at 367, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n    282 (citing Davidson v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 245 S.C. 472,\r\n    477-78, 141 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1965)).Â  The court concluded the vehicle qualified\r\n    as an uninsured vehicle and the defendant was covered under the uninsured\r\n    portion of the policy.Â  Id.\r\n  In this case, the trial court finds the motor vehicle to which the\r\n    policy applies is the Montero Sport as it is the motor vehicle designated in\r\n    the policy.Â  However, in Schmidt the policy the court relies on to find\r\n    coverage is a valid insurance policy.Â  In this case, the policy which the court\r\n    relies on to find coverage may not be a valid policy. Â If there is no valid policy,\r\n    there can be no motor vehicle to which the policy applies, nor can there be a\r\n    motor vehicle designated in the policy.Â  \r\n  Likewise, the court relies on Hogan to distinguish the\r\n    insurable interest requirement for liability coverage from UM coverage.Â  In Hogan,\r\n    the named insuredâ€™s son was killed while riding in a vehicle she retained title\r\n    to but which was actually owned by and driven by her nephew.Â  260 S.C. at 159,\r\n    194 S.E.2d at 890-91.Â  An exclusion in the insurance policy provided UM\r\n    coverage did not apply to injuries sustained by an â€œuninsuredâ€ while occupying\r\n    a car other than the insured vehicle owned by the named insured or a resident\r\n    relative.Â  Id. at 159-160, 194 S.E.2d at 891.Â  The court held the\r\n    exclusion invalid because it conflicted with the statutory mandate that UM\r\n    coverage apply to the named insured and resident relatives without regard to\r\n    the use of the insured vehicle.Â  Id. at 162, 194 S.E.2d at 892.\r\n  Again,\r\n    as in Schmidt, the issue before the Hogan court dealt with an\r\n    exclusion included in a valid insurance policy.Â  It is undeniable that under a\r\n    valid insurance policy Nationwide could not exclude coverage in this case.Â  The\r\n    question, however, is not whether Nationwide is unduly excluding coverage;\r\n    rather, the issue is whether there exists a valid insurance policy. \r\n  We acknowledge the purpose of the uninsured motorist statute is to\r\n    provide benefits and protection against the peril of injury or death by an\r\n    uninsured motorist to an insured motorist and his family. Â Ferguson v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 100, 198 S.E.2d 522, 524\r\n    (1973).Â  We also remain ever mindful the statute is remedial in nature, enacted\r\n    for the benefit of the injured persons, and is to be liberally construed so\r\n    that the purpose intended may be accomplished. Â Gunnels v. American Liberty\r\n    Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 247, 161 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1968).Â  However, we do\r\n    not believe that entitles this court to pervert the well settled rule of law in\r\n    this country that an insured must possess an interest in the subject matter of\r\n    the policy.Â  Where an insurable interest does not exist at the time the\r\n    contract for insurance was made, the insurance policy is void from its\r\n    inception.Â  Abraham v. New York Underwriters Ins. Co., 187 S.C. 70, 78,\r\n    196 S.E.2d 531, 534 (1938).\r\n  Therefore, in this case, the question whether Father lacked an\r\n    insurable interest in the Montero is relevant to determining the amount of UM\r\n    coverage available to the Smiths.Â  UM coverage provides â€œbenefits and\r\n    protection against the peril of injury or death by an uninsured motorist to an\r\n    insured motorist, his family, and the permissive users of his vehicle.â€Â  Ferguson, 261 S.C. at 100, 198 S.E.2d at 524.Â  An\r\n    insured is entitled to stack UM coverage in an amount no greater than the amount\r\n    of coverage on the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut.\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Mooneyham, 304 S.C. 442, 446, 405 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1991).Â  Stacking\r\n    is defined â€œas the insured's recovery of damages under more than one policy\r\n    until all of his damages are satisfied or the limits of all available policies\r\n    are met.â€Â  Giles v. Whitaker, 297 S.C. 267, 268, 376 S.E.2d 278, 279\r\n    (1989). Â â€œIf none of the insured's or named insured's vehicles is involved in\r\n    the accident, coverage is available only to the extent of coverage on any one\r\n    of the vehicles with the excess or underinsured coverage.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n    Â§38-77-160 (2002).Â  This court has interpreted the statute to mean UM coverage\r\n    is personal and portable, meaning coverage follows the person.Â  Nationwide\r\n    Mut. Ins. Co. v. Erwood, 364 S.C. 1, 6, 611 S.E.2d 319, 322 (Ct. App.\r\n    2005).Â  The â€œpersonal and portableâ€ nature of UM coverage was recently upheld\r\n    by the supreme court.Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Erwood, 373 S.C. 88,\r\n    __, 644 S.E.2d 62 (2007) (Erwood II).Â  The court reiterated that UM\r\n    coverage follows the insured not the vehicle and upheld the court of appeals\r\n    decision that an insured was entitled to receive UM benefits in the basic\r\n    limits from the policy maintained on a non-involved vehicle.Â  Id. at __,\r\n    644 S.E.2d at 63.\r\n  In this case, the Smiths must first look to recover the amount of\r\n    UM coverage on the Montero, as it was the vehicle involved in the accident and\r\n    serves as the measuring vehicle for the stacking of additional UM coverage.Â  If\r\n    Father had an insurable interest in the Montero, thereby making the policy\r\n    valid, the Smiths would be able to recover the UM coverage provided under the\r\n    policy.Â  In addition, the Smiths would be able to stack the UM coverage\r\n    provided on the Ranger.\r\n  However, if, as Nationwide asserts, the policy is void as to the\r\n    Montero for a lack of insurable interest, the Montero will have no liability coverage\r\n    and the Smiths may not look to it for UM coverage. Â Yet, the Smiths would not\r\n    be without coverage.Â  According to S.C.\r\n    Code Ann. Â§38-77-160 and the recent Erwood II decision, the Smiths may\r\n    look to the UM coverage maintained on the non-involved vehicle.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§38-77-160 (2002); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Erwood, 373\r\n    S.C. at __, 644 S.E.2d at 63-64.\r\n  Nationwide\r\n    acknowledged Erwood, pending before the supreme court at the time of\r\n    trial and filing of appeal, would answer the coverage issue in this case in the\r\n    event the Montero policy was found to be void and the Smiths were limited to\r\n    coverage under the Rangerâ€™s policy.Â  The defendant in Erwood was a\r\n    passenger on an uninsured motorcycle when it was involved in an accident.Â  The\r\n    defendant, however, owned an insured automobile providing UM coverage in the\r\n    required statutory minimum amount of $15,000.Â  Ultimately in Erwood II,\r\n    the supreme court found the insured was entitled to UM coverage from her\r\n    non-involved vehicle because of the personal and portable nature of UM\r\n    coverage.Â  Since the UM coverage on her non-involved vehicle was the statutory\r\n    minimum of $15,000, the court limited her coverage to the statutory limit.Â  Nationwide\r\n    asserts if Erwood were to be upheld the Smiths would be limited to the\r\n    statutory minimum of $15,000.Â  We disagree. Â According to Erwood II, the Smiths would be limited in recovery to\r\n    the UM coverage provided on the Ranger, the non-involved vehicle.\r\n  Because the trial court found whether Father had an insurable\r\n    interest was irrelevant to this case, it did not address whether Father\r\n    actually had an insurable interest.Â  As discussed above, we hold the issue of\r\n    insurable interest is pivotal in determining the recovery available to the\r\n    Smiths.Â  Therefore, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment and REMAND.Â  In\r\n    light of our disposition, we need not address Nationwideâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340-41, 428\r\n    S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address a remaining issue when\r\n    resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED \r\n  BEATTY,\r\n    J., concurs \r\n  ANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion \r\n  ANDERSON, J. (dissenting\r\n    in a separate opinion):Â  Â Because I\r\n    agree with the disposition and reasoning of the master-in-equity, I VOTE to AFFIRM and adopt the analysis in his order as my dissent:\r\n  ORDER OF\r\n    MASTER-IN-EQUITY CLYDE N. DAVIS, JR.\r\n  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 mandates that all\r\n    automobile insurance carriers may not issue or deliver policies unless the\r\n    policies contain a provision providing uninsured motorist coverage.Â  The\r\n    uninsured motorist statute is remedial and was enacted for the benefit of\r\n    injured persons; the statute is to be liberally construed to accomplish this\r\n    purpose.Â  Gunnels v. American Liberty Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 161 S.E.2d\r\n    822 (1968); Franklin v. Devore, 327 S.C. 418, 489 S.E.2d 65 (Ct.\r\n    App. 1997).Â  Provisions inconsistent with uninsured motorist statutes are\r\n    void.Â  Kay v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 349 S.C. 446, 562 S.E.2d\r\n    676 (2002).\r\n  The merit of Nationwideâ€™s position in the case at hand\r\n    hinges upon whether Nationwide can circumvent the requirement of South Carolina\r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 to deny James W. Smith, Jr. and Elizabeth Smith uninsured\r\n    motorist coverage benefits simply because the vehicle was owned by James W.\r\n    Smith, Jr. and James W. Smith, Sr. had no ownership interest in the Montero\r\n    Sport.Â  The evidence reveals that the Montero Sport was the primary means of\r\n    transportation for the family that included James W. Smith, Jr., Elizabeth\r\n    Smith, and James W. Smith, Sr.Â  The evidence establishes that the vehicle was\r\n    driven primarily by Elizabeth Smith who was a listed driver on the policy.Â \r\n    James W. Smith, Sr. did not drive at all due to medical reasons.Â  The vehicle\r\n    was often used to transport James W. Smith, Sr. to and from doctorsâ€™ visits and\r\n    to obtain prescriptions.Â  The testimony reveals that this was done several\r\n    times a month.Â  James W. Smith, Sr. certainly derived a benefit from the\r\n    Montero Sport.Â  The Montero Sport and Elizabeth Smith were added to the policy,\r\n    premiums for both were collected and retained by Nationwide, and Nationwide\r\n    should not be allowed to avoid payment of an uninsured claim due to what\r\n    amounts to a technicality.\r\n  This Court is persuaded by the decision of the South\r\n    Carolina Supreme Court in Unisum Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529\r\n    S.E.2d 280 (2000), and holds that the insurable interest argument is irrelevant\r\n    in this case, as we are dealing with uninsured coverage and not liability\r\n    coverage.Â  In the case of Schmidt, the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n    addressed a similar factual scenario.Â  In Schmidt, the Defendant was\r\n    injured while riding in a car driven by an unauthorized driver.Â  Schmidt at 364-65, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  The parties in Schmidt stipulated that\r\n    January Oâ€™Nealeâ€™s father gave her a BMW with strict instructions not to let\r\n    anyone else drive the car.Â  Schmidt at 365, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  On the\r\n    date in question, Miss Oâ€™Neale and her friend Jennifer Hurst went to a party at\r\n    the home of Christopher Schmidt.Â  Id.Â  During the party, Schmidt drove\r\n    the BMW with Hurst asleep in the back seat.Â  Id.Â  Schmidt lost control\r\n    of the vehicle, hit a tree and Hurst was injured.Â  Id.Â  The parties\r\n    agreed that Schmidt did not have permission to drive the vehicle, but that Hurstâ€™s use of the BMW at all times was consensual.Â  The insurance carrier for the BMW was\r\n    State Farm, and they successfully denied liability coverage due to the fact\r\n    that Schmidt did not have permission to operate the vehicle.Â  Id.Â  Hurst then attempted to collect under the uninsured coverage of the State Farm policy\r\n    covering the BMW.Â  Hurst argued that since she was a permissive occupant, she\r\n    was covered.Â  The trial court sided with Hurst, but the South Carolina Court of\r\n    Appeals reversed.Â  The Court of Appeals held that for Hurst to be an insured\r\n    under the statutory definition of insured, she must be a guest in a vehicle â€œto\r\n    which the policy applied.â€Â  Schmidt at 365, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  The\r\n    Court of Appeals held that when Schmidt drove off in the vehicle without\r\n    permission, the State Farm policy no longer applied to the vehicle.Â  Id.Â  Based on their conclusion, the Court of Appeals never addressed whether the BMW\r\n    was an uninsured motor vehicle.\r\n  The South Carolina Supreme Court then reversed the\r\n    Court of Appeals.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court first looked at the\r\n    definition of insured under South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) which\r\n    defines insured to mean:\r\n  \r\n    the\r\n      named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse of any\r\n      named insured and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or otherwise,\r\n      and any person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of the named\r\n      insured the motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in the motor\r\n      vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of any of\r\n      the above.\r\n  \r\n  The\r\n    South Carolina Supreme Court then stated that the Court of Appeals had erred in\r\n    concluding that the Oâ€™Neale vehicle was not a vehicle â€œto which the policy\r\n    applied.â€Â  Schmidt at 366-67, 529 S.E.2d at 282.Â  The Court then held\r\n    that the â€œ â€˜motor vehicle to which the policy appliesâ€™ is â€˜the motor vehicle\r\n    designated in the policyâ€™ â€ Schmidt at 367, 529 S.E.2d at 282 (citing Davidson\r\n    v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 141 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1965)).Â  The\r\n    South Carolina Supreme Court then stated that the words â€œto which the policy\r\n    appliesâ€ are words of identification and not words of exclusion as used by the\r\n    Court of Appeals.Â  Schmidt at 367, 529 S.E.2d at 282.Â  The South\r\n    Carolina Supreme Court then looked at the definition of an uninsured vehicle\r\n    and concluded that the Oâ€™Neale vehicle qualified as an uninsured vehicle\r\n    pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(13) and that Hurst was covered\r\n    under the uninsured portion of the policy.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme Court\r\n    stated that the purpose of the uninsured motorist law is â€œto provide benefits\r\n    and protection against the peril of injury or death by an uninsured motorist to\r\n    an insured motorist and his family . . .â€Â  Schmidt at 368, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n    283 (citing Ferguson v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96,\r\n    100, 198 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1973).\r\n  Applying the holding of the South Carolina Supreme\r\n    Court in Schmidt to the case at hand, one must conclude that the Smiths\r\n    should be covered under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy covering\r\n    the Montero.Â  As in Schmidt, they are insureds under South Carolina Code\r\n    Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7), as they resided with the insured, James W. Smith, Sr. and\r\n    are related by blood and marriage to the insured James W. Smith, Sr.Â \r\n    Furthermore, the motor vehicle to which the policy applies would be the Montero\r\n    Sport, as that is â€œthe motor vehicle designated in the policy.â€Â  Furthermore,\r\n    the Nationwide Policy at issue on page U1, which is the Uninsured Motorists and\r\n    Underinsured Motorist provision, states:Â  â€œWe will pay damages, including\r\n    derivative claims, because the bodily injury suffered by you or a relative, and\r\n    because of property damage.Â  Such damages must be due by law to you or a\r\n    relative for the owner or driver of:Â  1. an uninsured motor vehicle . . .â€Â \r\n    Therefore, the uninsured motorist coverage provision of the Nationwide policy\r\n    covering the Montero should cover James W. Smith, Jr. and Elizabeth Smith when\r\n    applying the reasoning of the South Carolina Supreme Court in Schmidt and the policy language of the Nationwide policy.\r\n  This Court is also persuaded by the holding of the\r\n    South Carolina Supreme Court in Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 157,\r\n    194 S.E.2d 890 (1973).Â  In Hogan, the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n    reviewed the judgment from the South Carolina lower court, which held that a\r\n    policy clause excluding uninsured motorist coverage to the insured and her\r\n    family, unless they were riding in the vehicle named in the policy, violated\r\n    the South Carolina Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act (S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    46-750.31 to -.32 (1962 Code of Laws)).\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina then points out\r\n    the distinction between liability and uninsured motorist coverage.Â  The Court\r\n    states that the liability contract is only required to insure â€œpersons defined\r\n    as insured, against loss from liability imposed by law for damages arriving out\r\n    of the ownership, maintenance or use of the motor vehicle described in the\r\n    policy; while uninsured motorist coverage obligates the insured to pay all sums\r\n    which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the\r\n    owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle.â€Â  Hogan at 162, 194 S.E.2d at\r\n    892 (internal quotations omitted).Â  Uninsured motorist coverage is not to\r\n    provide coverage for the uninsured vehicle but to afford additional protection\r\n    to an insured.Â  Id.Â  Unlike the provisions relative to liability coverage,\r\n    the Statute plainly affords uninsured motorist coverage to the named insured\r\n    and resident relatives of his/her household at all times and without regard to\r\n    the activity in which they were engaged at the time.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme\r\n    Court stated such coverage is nowhere limited in the Statute to the use of the\r\n    insured vehicle and cannot be so limited by policy provisions.Â  Id.Â  The Hogan decision is significant because the Supreme Court was\r\n    examining similar statutory language which is applicable today.\r\n  Nationwideâ€™s argument that having no insurable\r\n    interest defeats uninsured coverage is supported by no case law that refers to\r\n    uninsured motorist coverage.Â  Within their memorandum, Nationwide has cited the\r\n    South Carolina cases of American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Passmore, 275\r\n    S.C. 618, 274 S.E.2d 416 (1981), and Benton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Kenneth\r\n    Henry Edmund Boden, et al. Benton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Boden, 310\r\n    S.C. 400, 426 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  These cases can easily be\r\n    distinguished from the case at hand, as neither refer or pertain to uninsured\r\n    motorist coverage.Â  The case of Passmore involved a situation in which\r\n    Helen Whitehead agreed to sell her 1970 Chevrolet Nova to Lonnie Reed in\r\n    exchange for a down payment and assumption of the existing indebtedness.Â  Per\r\n    the agreement, Mr. Reed was required to obtain liability insurance on the\r\n    vehicle.Â  Because Mr. Reed had poor credit, he could not obtain liability\r\n    insurance and approached a friend, Leaman Foxworth, who agreed to place the\r\n    vehicle on his policy.Â  The girlfriend of Lonnie Reed was then involved in a\r\n    collision with James Passmore on May 21, 1977.Â  The trial judge held that an\r\n    insurance interest was not required for liability insurance in South Carolina, and the Supreme Court reversed the Trial Courtâ€™s decision and remanded the\r\n    matter.Â  The Supreme Court held that with regard to liability coverage, the\r\n    insurable interest does not depend upon the named insured having either a legal\r\n    or equitable interest in the property, but it is enough that the insured may be\r\n    held liable for damages to its operation and use.Â  Passmore at 620-21,\r\n    274 S.E.2d at 417-18.Â  Benton &amp; Rhodes does not involve automobile\r\n    insurance.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  In conclusion, Nationwideâ€™s argument that there is no\r\n    uninsured coverage on the Montero Sport is not supported by the evidence or the\r\n    case law, is irrelevant, and to hold there is no uninsured motorist coverage on\r\n    the Montero Sport would be against public policy.Â  The Smiths are entitled to\r\n    Fifty Thousand ($50,000.00) Dollars per person, One Hundred Thousand\r\n    ($100,000.00) Dollars per occurrence of uninsured coverage on the Montero Sport\r\n    and then they would each be able to stack the Fifty Thousand ($50,000.00)\r\n    dollars uninsured motorist coverage provided by the Montero Sport policy and the\r\n    Fifty Thousand ($50,000.00) Dollars uninsured motorist coverage provided by the\r\n    1992 Ford Ranger.Â  The total coverage available to each should be One Hundred\r\n    Thousand ($100,00.00) Dollars for a total of Two Hundred Thousand\r\n    ($200,000.000) Dollars in total uninsured motorist coverage for this\r\n    occurrence.Â  Stacking would be allowed, as James W. Smith, Jr. and Elizabeth\r\n    Smith are relatives of the insured, James W. Smith, Sr., and resided with him\r\n    at the time of the accident, thus they are Class I insureds.Â  Therefore they\r\n    can stack the available uninsured motorist coverage per Concrete Servs.,\r\n    Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 331 S.C. 506, 498 S.E.2d\r\n    865 (1998), and South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160.\r\n  (some\r\n    minor typographical and citation errors corrected)\r\n  Accordingly,\r\n    I VOTE to AFFIRM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  [2] Father was residing with the Smiths\r\n    and his grandson at the time the accident occurred.Â  Father did not drive due\r\n    to medical reasons and from time to time relied on the Smiths to drive him to\r\n  and from doctor visits and to obtain prescriptions.Â \r\n[3] Nationwide concedes that both the Smiths are Class I\r\n    insureds under the Fatherâ€™s policy.Â  There are two classes of insureds: (1) the\r\n    named insured, his spouse and relatives residing in his household; and, (2) any\r\n    person using, with the consent of the named insured, the motor vehicle to which\r\n    the policy applies and a guest in the motor vehicle.Â  Concrete Servs., Inc.\r\n    v.

Co., 331 S.C. 506, 509, 498 S.E.2d 865, 866\r\n    (1998).Â  The right to stack is available only to a Class I insured.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
