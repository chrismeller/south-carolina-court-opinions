Carpenter, Jr., George C. Beighley, S. Elizabeth Brosnan and Drew Hamilton Butler, all of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        John S. Nichols and Robert B. Ransom, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This is an appeal from the order of the circuit court, finding John E. Cooke was not a statutory employee of Palmetto Health Alliance (the Hospital) when he was injured.Â  Because of this ruling, the circuit court found Cookeâ€™s negligence action and his wifeâ€™s loss of consortium action were not barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCooke was employed as a pilot for Petroleum Helicopter, Inc., which contracted with the Hospital to transport critically injured patients to the emergency room.Â  On December 13, 1999, Cooke tripped and fell over a metal rod that Latisha Corley, an employee of the Hospital, allegedly used to prop open a door at the Hospital.Â  Because Cookeâ€™s injury occurred while in the course of his employment with Petroleum Helicopter, Cooke filed for and received workersâ€™ compensation benefits. \r\nIn addition to his workersâ€™ compensation claim, Cooke and his wife, Barbara, filed a complaint against the Hospital, alleging negligence and loss of consortium.Â  After the court ruled that the Hospital could not be sued for punitive damages because of its status as a charitable organization, the Cookes amended their complaint to add Latisha Corley individually, alleging her method of propping open the door amounted to gross negligence. \r\nIn their answer, the Hospital and Corley (collectively Appellants) asserted, among other things, that Cooke was either the Hospitalâ€™s statutory employee or borrowed servant at the time of the accident, and therefore, the exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act served as a complete bar to the Cookesâ€™ tort action.[1]Â  After filing their answer, Appellants notified the Cookes of their intent to seek summary judgment. Â However, before the summary judgment motion was heard, Appellants, with the consent of the Cookes, made a motion for a hearing on the merits to determine whether â€œthe exclusive jurisdiction and exclusive remedyâ€ was with the workersâ€™ compensation commission or with the circuit court.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, the circuit court judge characterized the action before her as a â€œmotion hearingâ€ on â€œjurisdictional issues.â€Â  The Appellantsâ€™ attorney did not agree with the judgeâ€™s characterization and said: â€œYour honor, this [is] not a motion.Â  It was originally a motion for summary judgment.Â  Weâ€™re here today on the merits of whether . . . Mr. Cooke qualifies as a statutory employee of the hospital; and, therefore, barred under workmenâ€™s (sic) compensation.â€Â  Â The attorney for the Cookes added: â€œWeâ€™re here today to decide the merits of that.Â  Itâ€™s a question of law anyway, so it would be for your decision.Â  But we decided to tee this issue up before we go further with the case, since this issue may decide the â€“ will obviously decide the future course of the case.â€Â  After hearing those explanations, the circuit court judge stated: â€œWell, thatâ€™s why it seems to come up as a motion to dismiss the case . . . I didnâ€™t consider it to be a hearing on the merits where there would be testimony from an individual who would provide information about who his employer was and the contract, and all that information.â€ \r\nThe hearing then proceeded, and although there were no live witnesses, both parties submitted deposition testimony in support of their respective positions.Â  The Appellants argued that Cooke was a statutory employee because helicopter transport allows paramedics to reach critically injured patients more quickly than other forms of transportation, and therefore, helicopter service is essential to the Hospitalâ€™s business of saving lives.Â  The Appellants further argued that Cooke was a borrowed servant of the Hospital because there was a contract for hire, the work Cooke performed benefited the Hospital, and the Hospital had control over Cooke.Â  To illustrate that control, the Appellantsâ€™ attorney pointed out that Cooke had a uniform and identification tag issued by the Hospital, and the Hospital told Cooke where to pick up and deliver patients.Â  \r\nThe Cookesâ€™ attorney argued Cooke was not a statutory employee because the Hospital was not in the business of transporting patients, the helicopter service was only a miniscule part of the overall business of the Hospital, and the Hospital and Petroleum Helicopter entered a contract in which they agreed that pilots were not employees of the Hospital.Â  Â In regards to the Hospitalâ€™s borrowed servant argument, the Cookesâ€™ attorney pointed out that the Hospital does not decide â€œif or when the helicopters ever fly,â€ nor does the Hospital have any say in who Petroleum Helicopters hires as pilots.Â  \r\nAfter hearing arguments, the circuit court judge issued a written order, finding Cooke was not a statutory employee or borrowed servant of the Hospital.Â  In her order, the judge characterized the action as â€œa motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,â€ and the last sentence of her order denied â€œDefendantâ€™s Motion to Dismiss.â€Â Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe determination of whether a worker is a statutory employee is jurisdictional and therefore the question on appeal is one of law.â€Â  Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 320, 523 S.E.2d 766, 769 (1999) (citing Glass v. Dow Chemical Co., 325 S.C. 198, 482 S.E.2d 49 (1997)).Â  Thus, the appellate court reviews the entire record and decides the jurisdictional facts in accord with the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Appellants argue the circuit court erred by failing to find Cooke was either a statutory employee or borrowed servant of the Hospital.Â  The Cookes argue, initially, that the order of the circuit court is not immediately appealable.Â  Thus, before delving into the merits of the Appellantsâ€™ arguments, we first address the threshold issue of appealability.\r\nI.Â Appealability\r\nAn order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not immediately appealable.Â  Deskins v. Boltin, 319 S.C. 356, 461 S.E.2d 395 (1995); Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995), overruled on other grounds by Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002).Â  However, the issue before the circuit court was not brought via a motion to dismiss; rather, both parties consented to have a non-jury hearing on the merits of the Hospitalâ€™s exclusivity defense.Â  Furthermore, pursuant to Sabb v. South Carolina State University, the exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act does not involve subject matter jurisdiction.Â  350 S.C. at 423, 567 S.E.2d at 234.\r\nHere, the circuit court held a hearing to determine the merits of the Hospitalâ€™s exclusivity defense.Â  The circuit court rejected this defense, but the merits of the Cookesâ€™ action has yet to be determined.Â  Thus, the circuit courtâ€™s order is interlocutory.\r\nFor an interlocutory order to be appealable, the order must â€œinvolve the merits.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1985).Â  To involve the merits, an order â€˜â€œmust finally determine some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense . . . .â€™â€ Mid-State Distributors, Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 334, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993) (quoting Jefferson v. Geneâ€™s Used Cars, Inc., 295 S.C. 317, 318, 368 S.E.2d 456, 456 (1988)).Â  Here, the circuit court weighed the evidence and concluded that the exclusivity provision did not apply because Cooke was neither a statutory employee nor a borrowed servant of the Hospital.Â  In so holding, the circuit court â€œfinally determined a substantial matter forming a part of the Hospitalâ€™s defense,â€ and thus, the order is appealable. \r\nII. Statutory Employee\r\nOn the merits, the Appellants first argue the trial court erred in failing to find Cooke was a statutory employee of the Hospital.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo qualify as a statutory employee under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, an individual must be engaged in an activity that â€œis a part of [the employerâ€™s] trade, business or occupation.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (1985).Â  A particular activity is part of the putative employerâ€™s â€œtrade, business or occupationâ€ if it â€œ(1) is an important part of the [employerâ€™s] business or trade; (2) is a necessary, essential, and integral part of the [employerâ€™s] business; or (3) has previously been performed by the [employerâ€™s] employees.â€Â  Olmstead v. Shakespeare, 354 S.C. 421, 424, 571 S.E.2d 483, 485 (2003).Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination that none of these criteria is met.Â  First, as is apparent from its articles of incorporation, the Hospital is in the business of providing health care, not transportation.[2]Â  While air transportation of patients helps facilitate the Hospitalâ€™s treatment of critically injured patients, that alone does not make transportation an important or essential part of the Hospitalâ€™s general business.Â  See Abbott v. The Limited, 338 S.C. 161, 163-64, 526 S.E.2d 513, 514 (2000) (holding that a truck driver who delivered goods to a clothing store was not a statutory employee of the store because, even though it was important for the store to receive those goods, the store was in the business of retail sales not transportation).Â  Second, helicopter service is not â€œnecessary, essential, or integralâ€ to the Hospitalâ€™s operation because less than one percent of the Hospitalâ€™s patients use the service and the Hospitalâ€™s emergency room services do not cease when the helicopter cannot fly.Â  Finally, the Hospital did not have an FAA certificate and has never directly employed helicopter pilots.Â  Thus, the preponderance of the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s determination that Cooke was not a statutory employee of the Hospital.\r\nII.Â Borrowed Servant\r\nThe Hospital next argues the circuit court erred in failing to find Cooke was a borrowed servant.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the borrowed servant doctrine, when a general employer lends an employee to a special employer, that special employer is liable for workersâ€™ compensation if: (1) there is a contract of hire between the employee and the special employer; (2) the work being done by the employee is essentially that of the special employer; and (3) the special employer has the right to control the details of the employeeâ€™s work.Â  Eaddy v. A.J. Metler Hauling &amp; Rigging Co., 284 S.C. 270, 272, 325 S.E.2d 581, 582-83 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  While the circuit court found that the first two prongs of the borrowed servant doctrine were met, it found the Hospital did not control the details of Cookeâ€™s work, and therefore, the third prong was not satisfied. \r\nWhen determining whether a special employer has the right to control the details of an employeeâ€™s work, courts consider the following four factors: â€œ(1) direct evidence of the right to, or exercise of, control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishings of equipment; and (4) right to fire.â€Â  Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 33, 180 S.E.2d 648, 649 (1971).Â  Although the hospital provided Cooke with a helicopter, Cooke was paid by Petroleum Helicopters, which was also charged with hiring (and presumably firing) its pilots. Furthermore, pursuant to the contract between the Hospital and Petroleum Helicopters, â€œthe methods and detailsâ€ of each flight were not left up to the Hospital.Â  Thus, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination that Cooke was not the Hospitalâ€™s borrowed servant.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find Cooke is neither a statutory employee nor a borrowed servant of the Hospital.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order resolving the merits of the Hospitalâ€™s exclusivity defense is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Section 42-1-540 of the South Carolina Code (1985) provides that workersâ€™ compensation is the exclusive remedy against an employer for an employeeâ€™s work related accident.\r\n[2] According to the Hospitalâ€™s articles of incorporation, its corporate purpose is to â€œprovid[e] hospital facilities and health care services for inpatient medical care of the sick and injured.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4055","title":"Aiken v.

Burney, both of Laurens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  World Finance Corporation of South Carolina and World Acceptance Corporation (â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order denying their motion to compel arbitration.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBeginning in October 1997 through late 1999, Richard Aiken entered into a series of consumer loan transactions with Appellants.Â  In conjunction with each of these loan agreements, Aiken signed an arbitration agreement,[1] which provided that the parties agreed to settle all disputes and claims through arbitration. \r\nIn late 2002, after Aiken had paid his loan in full, former employees of Appellants used Aikenâ€™s personal financial information to illegally procure loans and embezzle the proceeds from those loans.[2]Â  Upon discovering the misuse of his personal information, Aiken filed suit against Appellants seeking a jury trial for damages arising out of the following causes of action:Â  intentional infliction of emotional distress; negligence; negligent hiring/supervision; and unfair trade practices.Â  In response, Appellants denied the allegations and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and a motion to compel arbitration. \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court denied Appellantsâ€™ motions to dismiss and to compel arbitration.Â  In reaching this decision, the court found the creditor/debtor relationship between Appellants and Aiken ended once Aiken satisfied his loan in full.Â  As a result, the court concluded the â€œeffectiveness of the arbitration clause ceased when the relationship of the parties ceased.â€Â  The court also held the tort claims raised by Aiken were not subject to arbitration because the acts of Appellantsâ€™ employees were â€œcompletely independent of the loan agreement.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe question whether a claim is subject to arbitration is a matter of judicial determination, unless the parties have provided otherwise.Â  Appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is subject to de novo review.â€Â  Chassereau v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 363 S.C. 628, 631, 611 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in denying their motion to compel arbitration.[3]Â  Specifically, they contend that once the court determined that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties, the courtâ€™s â€œdecisional functionâ€ was completed and any decisions regarding the validity of the agreement and the arbitrability of Aikenâ€™s claims were to be decided by an arbitrator.Â  Even if the circuit court was authorized to determine the effectiveness of the agreement, Appellants claim the broad terms of the arbitration agreement encompassed any disputes beyond the expiration of the underlying loan transactions between the parties.\r\nAs a threshold matter, we find Appellantsâ€™ argument that the circuit courtâ€™s authority was strictly limited to determining whether the parties entered into an arbitration agreement is not properly before this court.Â  First, Appellants did not raise this precise argument in their motion to compel arbitration or during the hearing before the circuit court.Â  Secondly, the circuit court did not address this issue in its order, but instead, only ruled on the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement.Â  Appellants did not file a motion pursuant to Rule 59 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to challenge this omission.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (recognizing that in order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court); Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 502, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting an issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment). \r\nIn terms of the merits of Appellantsâ€™ motion to compel arbitration, we turn to recently established precedent.Â  â€œArbitration is a matter of contract, and the range of issues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of the agreement.â€Â  Palmetto Homes, Inc. v. Bradley, 357 S.C. 485, 492, 593 S.E.2d 480, 484 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied (July 8, 2005).Â  Our supreme court has outlined the analytical framework for determining whether a particular claim is subject to arbitration.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 597, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118-19 (2001).Â  In Zabinski, the court stated:\r\n\r\n  To decide whether an arbitration agreement encompasses a dispute, a court must determine whether the factual allegations underlying the claim are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause, regardless of the label assigned to the claim. Hinson v. Jusco Co., 868 F.Supp. 145 (D.S.C. 1994); S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal, 312 S.C. 559, 437 S.E.2d 22 (1993).Â  Any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration. Towles, supra.Â  Furthermore, unless the court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered. Great W. Coal, 312 S.C. at 564, 437 S.E.2d at 25.Â  A motion to compel arbitration made pursuant to an arbitration clause in a written contract should only be denied where the clause is not susceptible to any interpretation which would cover the asserted dispute. Â Tritech, supra.\r\n\r\nId. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118-19.Â  The court further articulated that â€œ[a] broadly-worded arbitration clause applies to disputes that do not arise under the governing contract when a â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.â€Â  Id. at 119, 553 S.E.2d at 598.Â  \r\nWith respect to tort claims, the supreme court noted the test from other jurisdictions stating, â€œthe focus should be on the factual allegations contained in the petition rather than on the legal causes of actions asserted.â€Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597 n.4, 553 S.E.2d at 119 n.4.Â  The court elaborated:\r\n\r\n  The test is based on a determination of whether the particular tort claim is so interwoven with the contract that it could not stand alone.Â  If the tort and contract claims are so interwoven, both are arbitrable.Â  On the other hand, if the tort claim is completely independent of the contract and could be maintained without reference to the contract, the tort claim is not arbitrable. \r\n\r\nId.\r\nShortly after the supreme court issued its decision in Zabinski, this court had the opportunity to apply the principles set forth and to interpret the â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ test.Â  Vestry &amp; Church Wardens of the Church of the Holy Cross v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 356 S.C. 202, 588 S.E.2d 136 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Although this court utilized the Zabinski principles to analyze the question of whether separate arbitration agreements previously executed by the parties mandated arbitration for the claims in dispute, we believe the holding is, nevertheless, instructive.Â  In Vestry, we concluded, â€œthe mere fact that an arbitration clause might apply to matters beyond the express scope of the underlying contract does not alone imply that the clause should apply to every dispute between the parties.â€Â  Id. at 209, 588 S.E.2d at 140.Â  \r\nThe arbitration agreement in the instant case provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND AND NATURE BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN AGREEMENT, OR ARISING OUT OF ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER OR ARISING OUT OF ANY PRIOR OR FUTURE DEALINGS BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER, SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION AND SETTLED BY ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT, THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (THE â€œARBITRATION RULES OF THE AAAâ€), AND THIS AGREEMENT. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  We would also note the arbitration agreement contained a provision that stated, â€œThis Agreement applies even if the Loan Agreement is paid in full, charged-off by Lender, or discharged in Bankruptcy.â€ \r\nGiven the broadly worded terms of the arbitration agreement, it is plausible that one could initially conclude that Aikenâ€™s claims were subject to arbitration.Â  However, as discussed above, the terms alone are not dispositive of this determination.Â  Instead, we are required to focus on the factual allegations of the underlying causes of action to analyze whether a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ existed between the claims and the loan contract.Â Â Â  Moreover, because Aiken had satisfied his loan in full at the time his claims arose, we must also look at the partiesâ€™ intent to assess whether the arbitration agreement extended beyond the termination of the contract.Â  See Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 41, 524 S.E.2d 839, 846 (Ct. App. 1999)(â€œWhen a party invokes an arbitration clause after the contractual relationship between the parties has ended, the partiesâ€™ intent governs whether the clauseâ€™s authority extends beyond the termination of the contract.â€); see Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (â€œArbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.â€).Â  \r\nApplying the foregoing principles to the specific facts of this case, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that Aikenâ€™s claims were not subject to arbitration. Â Initially, we reject Appellantsâ€™ contention that the claims arose out of the loan agreement simply because Appellantsâ€™ employees would not have had access to Aikenâ€™s personal financial information but for the loan agreement.Â  Although Appellantsâ€™ assertion is factually accurate, it disregards the analytical framework for determining whether claims are arbitrable.Â  Aikenâ€™s tort claims are independent of the loan agreement and require no reference to the contract.Â  At the time Appellantsâ€™ employees misused Aikenâ€™s personal financial information, Aiken had paid off his loan in full.Â  Thus, a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ does not exist between Aikenâ€™s claims and the loan agreement.Â  Moreover, it is inconceivable that Aiken intended to agree to maintain a contractual relationship with Appellants in perpetuity after he paid off his loan.Â  Given Aiken had satisfied his contractual obligation, no further dealings with Appellants were necessary.Â  Finally, we do not believe he could have foreseen the future tortious conduct of Appellantsâ€™ employees at the time he entered into the loan agreements.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we believe our holding is consistent with this courtâ€™s recent decision in Chassereau v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 363 S.C. 628, 611 S.E.2d 305 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In Chassereau, a homeowner entered into a contract for the construction of a pool by Global-Sun Pools.Â  The contract contained an arbitration provision that applied to â€œany disputes arising in any manner relating to this agreement.â€Â  Id. at 633, 611 S.E.2d at 307.Â Â  After construction was completed, the homeowner began to experience problems with the pool.Â  Because Global-Sun Pools failed to repair the pool, the homeowner stopped making payments on the pool.Â  Id. at 630, 611 S.E.2d at 306.Â  A few months later, the homeowner filed a complaint against the pool company and one of its employees, alleging this employee and other employees made a series of harassing and intimidating telephone calls to her workplace.Â  The homeowner claimed the pool companyâ€™s employees made defamatory statements about her to her co-workers and they disclosed information regarding her personal finances.Â  Additionally, the homeowner asserted these same employees made numerous telephone calls to her home as well as to her relatives in an effort to intimidate and harass her.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn her complaint, the homeowner sought damages based on causes of action for defamation, violation of South Carolina Code of Laws section 16-17-430 which prohibits unlawful use of a telephone, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Id. at 631, 611 S.E.2d at 306.Â  The pool company and its employee filed a motion to compel arbitration, alleging the provisions of the construction contract mandated arbitration.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, finding â€œ[t]he complaint is based upon tortious conduct of the employees of [Global-Sun Pools] unrelated to the contractâ€ and the â€œallegations of the complaint do not arise out of nor do they relate to the contract[.]â€Â  Id. at 631, 611 S.E.2d at 306-07.\r\nOn appeal, this court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  In so holding, we found the homeownerâ€™s claims did not arise out of the construction contract and could be proved independently of the contract.Â  We further concluded the causes of action alleged in the complaint â€œconstitute[d] tortious behavior that the parties . . . could not have reasonably foreseen and for which we seriously doubt they intended to provide a limited means of redress.â€Â  Id. at 634, 611 S.E.2d at 308.\r\nSimilar to the homeownerâ€™s tort claims in Chassereau, Aikenâ€™s tort claims did not arise out of the loan agreement and could be proved independently of this agreement.Â  Although we are cognizant of the policy favoring arbitration, we do not believe arbitration is warranted for Aikenâ€™s claims.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (â€œThe policy of the United States and South Carolina is to favor arbitration of disputes.â€). \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Aiken signed several arbitration agreements.Â  However, the only agreements pertinent to this appeal are those executed on February 3, 1999 and July 21, 1999. \r\n[2]Â  The former employees pleaded guilty for these offenses and were sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. \r\n[3]Â  Although Appellants raise four issues in their brief, we have consolidated these issues in the interest of brevity and clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4056","title":"Jackson v.

Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4056\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2005 â€“ Filed December 12, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nFletcher N. Smith, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJames D. Jolly, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This is a civil action brought under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act for violation of the state constitution, malicious prosecution and false arrest.Â  Timothy Jackson appeals from an order of the circuit court granting the City of Abbevilleâ€™s (City) motion for summary judgment and denying Jacksonâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  At issue is whether a City police officer had probable cause to arrest Jackson at a convenience store in Abbeville on February 22, 1999.Â  We hold the officer had probable cause to arrest Jackson and affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn February, 22, 1999, Jackson entered Rileyâ€™s BP, a convenience store located in Abbeville, South Carolina, and asked the attendant whether he could put up a flyer in the store for a party he was having at his club.Â  The attendant said he could not.Â  A video surveillance tape from the store indicates that Jackson became enraged, accusing the attendant of racism.Â  She asked Jackson to leave the premises.Â  Jackson refused to leave, and the attendant called the police.Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen the officer arrived, Jackson repeatedly interrupted the officer while he was attempting to find out what happened from the attendant.Â  The officer told Jackson to be quiet several times, but Jackson refused to do so.Â  The attendant again told Jackson to leave the premises.Â  When Jackson refused to leave, the officer put Jackson on trespass notice.Â  Jackson continued to interrupt.Â  The officer told Jackson to be quiet or he would be arrested.Â  Jackson ignored the officerâ€™s repeated demands, and the officer attempted to place him under arrest.Â  A scuffle ensued as Jackson resisted and backup was summoned to effect the arrest.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter being arrested and taken to jail, Jackson was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.Â  Jackson was not charged with trespass after notice.Â  The municipal judge dismissed the charges.[1]  \r\nJackson sued the City of Abbeville[2] under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act[3] for: (1) violation of the South Carolina Constitution, (2) malicious prosecution, and (3) false arrest.Â  Both sides moved for summary judgment.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court granted the Cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment and denied Jacksonâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 56, SCRCP, a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.Â  â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.â€Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 437, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAn essential element in each of Jacksonâ€™s causes of action is the lack of probable cause to arrest him.[4]Â  The dispositive issue before us is whether the â€œprobable cause to arrestâ€ determination is confined to the actual charges or whether consideration of an uncharged offense is appropriate.Â  The City concedes for purposes of this appeal the absence of probable cause to arrest Jackson for disorderly conduct and the related offense of resisting arrest.Â  The City contends, however, that it mayâ€”to defeat Jacksonâ€™s claimsâ€”properly rely on the presence of probable cause in connection with an uncharged offense.Â  We hold that the determination of â€œprobable cause to arrestâ€ for the purpose of Jacksonâ€™s tort claims may properly include consideration of an uncharged offense.Â Â  \r\nThe uncharged offense for which the City asserts probable cause existed is trespass after notice.Â  Trespass after notice is a misdemeanor criminal offense prohibited by section 16-11-620 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1998).Â  â€œStatutory criminal trespass involves . . . the failure to leave a dwelling house, place of business or premises of another after having been requested to leave.â€Â  State v. Cross,&nbsp;323 S.C. 41, 43, 448 S.E.2d 569, 570&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â  The City has an ordinance patterned after section 16-11-620.Â  A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person who commits trespass after noticeâ€”or any misdemeanorâ€”in the officerâ€™s presence.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-30 (1985); State v. Mims, 263 S.C. 45, 208 S.E.2d 288 (1974). \r\nJackson has the burden of demonstrating lack of probable cause.Â  Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co., 246 S.C. 318, 322, 143 S.E.2d 607, 609 (1965).Â  Probable cause turns not on the individualâ€™s actual guilt or innocence, but on whether facts within the officerâ€™s knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe the individual arrested was guilty of a crime.Â  State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 509, 476 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1996); Deaton v. Leath, 279 S.C. 82, 84, 302 S.E.2d 335, 336 (1983).Â  â€œâ€˜Probable causeâ€™ is defined as a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this belief rests on such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the circumstances, to believe likewise.â€Â  Jones v. City of Columbia,&nbsp;301 S.C. 62, 65, 389 S.E.2d 662, 663&nbsp;(1990).Â  Probable cause is determined as of the time of the arrest, based on facts and circumstancesâ€”objectively measuredâ€”known to the arresting officer.Â  The determination of probable cause is not an academic exercise in hindsight.Â  George, 323 S.C. at 509, 476 S.E.2d at 911; Eaves v. Broad River Elec. Co-op., Inc.,&nbsp;277 S.C. 475, 478, 289 S.E.2d 414, 415-16&nbsp;(1982); State v. Goodwin, 351 S.C. 105, 110, 567 S.E.2d 912, 914 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Robinson, 335 S.C. 620, 634, 518 S.E.2d 269, 276-77 (Ct. App. 1999); 5 Am. Jur. 2d Arrest Â§ 40; 6A C.J.S. Arrest Â§ 25 (2004). â€œ[E]venhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.â€Â  Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 138 (1990).Â Â  \r\nConcerning the narrow issue before us, we find no South Carolina case directly on point, but we find the reasoning of three cases persuasive.\r\nThe first case is State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 518 S.E.2d 278 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  There, police officers responded to a call and found an â€œescalating altercationâ€ between Tyndall and his father.Â  Id. at 12, 518 S.E.2d at 280.Â  The father asked Tyndall to leave the house.Â  Id.Â  The officers told Tyndall that if he did not comply he would be arrested for trespass after notice.Â  Id. at 12-13, 518 S.E.2d at 280.Â  Tyndall refused to leave, and when the officers attempted to arrest him, he became belligerent and attacked the officers.Â  Id. at 13, 518 S.E.2d at 280. Â Tyndall was charged with multiple offenses, but not trespass after notice.Â  He was convicted of two counts of assault and battery with intent to kill and resisting arrest.Â  \r\nTyndall appealed from the trial courtâ€™s refusal to dismiss the resisting arrest charge because â€œhe was never arrested or prosecuted for trespass after notice . . . .â€Â  Tyndall, 336 S.C. at 14, 518 S.E.2d at 281.Â  His specific contention was â€œthat[] because no judicial determination was made as to the officersâ€™ probable cause to arrest him for trespass after notice, â€˜the actions taken by the officers were absent probable cause . . . .â€™â€Â  Id. at 15, 518 S.E.2d at 282.Â  This court rejected Tyndallâ€™s argument and found as a matter of law the existence of probable cause to arrest for the uncharged offense of trespass after notice:Â  â€œBecause Tyndall committed this crime [trespass after notice in violation of section 16-11-620] in the presence of the police officers, they had the power and authority to arrest Tyndall without a warrant.Â  There was no requirement for a judicial determination as to probable cause to arrest for trespass after notice.â€Â  Id. at 16, 518 S.E.2d at 282. \r\nThe second case is Ruff v. Eckerd Drugs, Inc., 265 S.C. 563, 220 S.E.2d 649 (1975).Â  Ruff was approached while leaving an Eckerds Drug Store by the storeâ€™s manager and accused of shoplifting.Â  An altercation occurred when the manager attempted to make a citizenâ€™s arrest.Â  Id. at 566, 220 S.E.2d at 650.Â  Ruff was charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct.Â  He was convicted on the assault charge, but the disorderly conduct charge was dismissed.Â  Because of the dismissal, Ruff filed an action for malicious prosecution.Â  Id.Â  Ruff prevailed at trial, but lost on appeal.Â  Our supreme courtâ€™s analysis in rejecting Ruffâ€™s claim has application in the case before us.Â  \r\nThe salient portions of the Ruff analysis include the observation that one â€œmay not maintain an action for malicious prosecution because he was charged with the wrong offense.â€Â  Id. at 567, 220 S.E.2d at 651.Â  The court further noted:\r\n\r\nThe fact [Ruff] was discharged by the magistrate on the charge of disorderly conduct is not conclusive on the question of probable cause; that is, if it appears affirmatively from the facts [that Ruff] was guilty of a misdemeanor, although one which contains different elements, there still would not be an absence of probable cause.\r\n\r\nId. at 568, 220 S.E.2d at 651.Â  \r\nThe court concluded by finding that the drugstore manager was â€œin possession of knowledge of the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable mind that [Ruff] had committed a crime.â€Â  Id. at 568, 220 S.E.2d at 652.Â  \r\nThe third case is State v. Freiburger, Op. No. 26042 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Sept. 26, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37 at 26).Â  Freiburger was hitchhiking when he was stopped by a Tennessee state trooper.Â  The trooper patted Freiburger down prior to placing him in the patrol car.Â  The pat-down yielded a pistol, and Freiburger was arrested for â€œcarrying arms,â€ but not hitchhiking.Â  Id. at 27.Â  The pistol was traced to a homicide in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  Id. at 27-28.Â  \r\nAt the murder trial in South Carolina, Freiburger unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of the pistol seized in Tennesseeâ€”the murder weaponâ€”on several grounds.Â  The relevant ground for our purposes is Freiburgerâ€™s claim that search was illegal because he was not charged with hitchhiking, and hence probable cause was lacking.Â  Our supreme court rejected this argument, noting that â€œthe fact Freiburger was not ultimately arrested for hitchhiking is not dispositive.â€Â  Id. at 30.Â  The Freiburger court held that â€œan officerâ€™s â€˜subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause . . . .â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Devenpeck v. Alford, 125 S.Ct. 588, 594 (2004) (repeating the settled principle that â€œâ€˜the fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the officerâ€™s action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that actionâ€™â€); Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (quoted in Devenpeck)).Â  \r\nWe find the reasoning in Tyndall, Ruff, and Freiburger leads to the conclusion that it is permissible to rely on an uncharged offense to establish probable cause.Â  We believe this legal principle applies in a false imprisonment or malicious prosecution claim and holds true here although Jackson was not convicted of a crime.Â  As previously noted, in the context of a tort action, Jackson has the burden of proving lack of probable cause.Â  Although there was no finding of probable causeâ€”as to the offense of trespass after noticeâ€”in the underlying criminal case, such a judicial determination is not required.Â  Tyndall, 336 S.C. at 16, 518 S.E.2d at 282.Â  \r\nWe now turn to the factual question presentedâ€”did the police officer have probable cause to arrest Jackson for the offense of trespass after notice?Â  Although the question of whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided as a matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion. Parrott,&nbsp;246 S.C. at 323, 143 S.E.2d at 609.Â  We have carefully reviewed the record in the light most favorable to Jackson and conclude that, as a matter of law, the facts known to the officer â€œwould induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the circumstances, to believeâ€ that Jackson had committed the offense of trespass after notice.Â  Jones,&nbsp;301 S.C. at 65, 389 S.E.2d at 663.Â  Jackson was put on notice to leave the premises, and he refused to do so.Â  The fact that Jackson was not charged with trespass after notice is immaterial.Â  Since the law sanctions the Cityâ€™s reliance on the uncharged offense of trespass after noticeâ€”and concomitantly the presence of probable causeâ€”the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the City.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold, to the exacting summary judgment standard, that the City police officer had probable cause to arrest Jackson for trespass after notice, an uncharged offense.Â  We further hold that the Cityâ€™s reliance on the uncharged offense is sufficient to defeat Jacksonâ€™s claims.Â  Thus, summary judgment was properly granted for the City on all causes of action.[5]Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]\r\nThe record is not clear as to the basis of the dismissal of the charges in municipal court.Â  According to the Cityâ€™s brief, the disorderly conduct charge was dismissed because Jacksonâ€™s â€œactions did not rise to the level of â€˜fighting wordsâ€™ as required by Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451 (1987) and State v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991).â€ The resisting arrest charge was also dismissed, apparently on the belief that the dismissal of the underlying charge precluded a stand-alone prosecution for resisting arrest.Â  The present uncertainty as to the reasons why the charges against Jackson were dismissed does not impact this appeal, because the Cityâ€”for purposes of its summary judgment motionâ€”assumed a lack of probable cause concerning the charged offenses. \r\n[2] Rileyâ€™s BP and Angela McCurry have been dismissed from the case. \r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (2005). \r\n[4] Jackson predicated his constitutional violation claim on the lack of probable cause.Â  His false imprisonment claim also requires lack of probable cause.Â  See Gist v. Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t,&nbsp;336 S.C. 611, 615, 521 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œAn action for false imprisonment may not be maintained where the plaintiff was arrested by lawful authority . . . [and] [t]he fundamental issue in determining the lawfulness of an arrest is whether there was â€˜probable causeâ€™ to make the arrest.â€).Â  Finally, a malicious prosecution action fails if the plaintiff cannot show malice and lack of probable cause.Â  Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co., 246 S.C. 318, 322, 143 S.E.2d 607, 609 (1965); see also Gaar v. North Myrtle Beach Realty Co., Inc.,&nbsp;287 S.C. 525, 528, 339 S.E.2d 887, 889&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986) (listing the elements of malicious prosecution, including â€œwant of probable causeâ€).Â  \r\n[5] We need not address the Cityâ€™s alternative basis for disposing of the malicious prosecution claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4057","title":"Southern Glass &amp; Plastics Co. v.

Swagart, III; both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Southern Glass &amp; Plastics Co. instituted an action against Angela Duke, one if its former employees, seeking to recover money it alleges she distributed without authorization.Â  Angela denied the allegations and asserted numerous counterclaims.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment for Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s defenses of waiver and estoppel, and on her counterclaims for outrage, abuse of process, and wrongful termination.Â  The trial court also granted partial summary judgment on Angelaâ€™s counterclaim for defamation.Â  Angela appeals from this order, and we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nAngela worked as the administrative office manager for Southern Glass from May 1992 until her termination in October 2001.Â  For the majority of the time Angela worked there, Alan and Joanne Epley each had a fifty percent ownership interest in the company.Â  Joanne was Angelaâ€™s immediate supervisor. \r\nAt some point, the Epleysâ€™ relationship soured, and from 2000 to 2001, they were involved in both a divorce action and a shareholder derivative action.Â  While the coupleâ€™s divorce was pending, an order was issued in the derivative action which required Alan and Joanne to discuss and come to an agreement on issues such as hiring, firing, promoting, demoting, changing compensation, and awarding benefits.Â  Several months after the order was issued, Joanne sent a copy of it to Angela with a cover memo explaining that â€œthere are to be no changes in compensation of any managerial level employees without agreement between Alan Epley and Joanne Epley . . . .â€ After receiving the memo, Angela conferred with a human resource consultant who told her the order applied to the actions of Joanne and Alan, but not to her own actions. \r\nIn June of 2001, Angela e-mailed Joanne to ask about the status of her bonus, which Angela had received every year since 1996.Â  Joanne replied via e-mail, explaining Southern Glass had not performed as well as expected, and therefore, Angela would not be receiving a bonus this year.Â  Six weeks later, however, Joanne e-mailed Angela announcing that Southern Plastics was now showing a profit. Because the companyâ€™s numbers had improved, Joanne directed Angela to include a $4,500 bonus for herself and a $6,500 bonus for another employee (who happened to be Joanneâ€™s sister) on the payroll transmission for August 13, 2001.Â  Angela did so, and Joanne signed the checks. \r\nAfter the checks had been prepared, but one day prior to their disbursement, Alan told Angela to disobey any instructions Joanne had given her regarding checks.Â  According to Angela, this directive was issued by Alan because two insurance checks had been voided and re-cut, and he wanted information on the two additional checks.Â  Alan, however, claims that he specifically asked Angela about the bonus payments, and she told him she knew nothing about them.Â  \r\nIn the early fall of 2001, the Epleys settled their divorce action.Â  In the settlement, Joanne agreed to sell Alan her interest in Southern Glass.Â  On October 4, 2001, Joanne, Alan, and Southern Glass executed a release in which all parties agreed to â€œforever discharge each other, together with any and all of their . . . employees . . . who are or may be responsible for or jointly or severally liable for the same, from any and all liabilities, causes of action, [and] claims . . . that they have asserted or could have asserted in [the divorce proceeding or shareholder derivative suit].â€Â  The release further explains that its intent is to â€œfully and finally release all other parties from any and all claims, past, present, or future, arising from or connected with the issues and transactions arising out of the relationship among the parties as set forth in [the divorce proceedings or shareholder derivative action].â€Â  \r\nWithin three weeks of signing the release, Alan called Angela into his office and demanded she repay her bonus.Â  She refused, and Alan fired her.Â  After her termination, Angela applied for unemployment benefits.Â  Southern Glass challenged her application, and turned the unemployment claim over to the human resource consultant group it had on retainer to handle employment-related issues.Â  In a handwritten letter to the consultant group, Alan alleged Angela was fired for, among other things, theft, forgery, and taking money under false pretenses.Â  The consultant group incorporated parts of Alanâ€™s letter into its own letter to the South Carolina Employment Security Commission, but ultimately, the Commission found in Angelaâ€™s favor and awarded benefits. \r\nAlan wrote a letter to Angela in January of 2002, demanding she return her 2001 bonus. Because Angela did not return the money, Southern Glass initiated an action in magistrateâ€™s court, seeking the repayment of both her bonus and the bonus paid to Joanneâ€™s sister.Â  Together, these bonuses amounted to $11,000.Â Â  Angela filed an Answer denying Southern Glassâ€™s allegations and asserting numerous counterclaims.Â  She also filed a motion to transfer the case to the court of commons pleas, which was granted. \r\nOnce the case was transferred, both Southern Glass and Angela made motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s defenses of waiver and estoppel and her counterclaims for outrage, abuse of process, and wrongful termination.Â  The court also granted partial summary judgment in favor of Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s counterclaim for defamation, finding communications between Southern Glass and its human resources consultant were absolutely privileged.Â  However, the court refused to grant summary judgment with regard to false statements Alan allegedly made to a friend.Â Â  This appeal, filed by Angela, followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).&nbsp; \r\nIn determining whether a triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; Even if there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. &nbsp;Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991).&nbsp; Summary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of law.&nbsp; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Â Â Release Defense\r\nAngela claims the trial court erred in failing to find the release Southern Glass signed constituted a waiver to its claims against her.Â  We agree.\r\nBy signing the release, Alan, Joanne, and Southern Glass agreed to:\r\n\r\n  mutually release, acquit, and forever discharge each other, together with any and all . . . employees . . . who are or may be responsible for or jointly or severally liable for . . . all liabilities, causes of action, [and] claims . . . known or unknown, now existing or which may accrue hereafter, against any of the parties . . . which they now have, have had in the past, or may have in the future . . . and any other claim that they have asserted or could have asserted in the [the divorce and shareholder derivative actions].\r\n\r\nThere is no dispute that Angela was an employee of Southern Glass at the time this release was signed.[1]Â  What is disputed is whether Southern Glassâ€™s cause of action against Angela was intended to be waived when the parties signed this release.Â Â  The trial court found the claim against Angela was not waived because the release â€œapplies only to claims that could have been asserted in the divorce or shareholder derivative action.â€ (Emphasis in original.) We do not believe the parties, at the time they signed the release, intended for it to be so narrowly construed.\r\nA release is a contract, and the scope of a release is gathered by its terms.Â  Gardner v. City of Columbia Police Depâ€™t, 216 S.C. 219, 223, 57 S.E.2d 308, 309 (1950); Bowers v. Depâ€™t of Transp., 360 S.C. 149, 600 S.E.2d 543 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIn construing [a] release, the court must seek to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.â€Â  The Wilson Group, Inc. v. Quorum Health Resources, Inc., 880 F. Supp. 416, 425 (D.S.C. 1995).Â  \r\nHere, the release itself reveals the partiesâ€™ intent: \r\n\r\n  [I]t being the intent of this Release for all parties to fully and finally release all other parties from any and all claims, past, present, or future, arising from or connected with the issues and transactions arising out of the relationship among the parties as set forth in [the divorce and shareholder derivative actions].\r\n\r\nThis language makes clear the partiesâ€™ intent to release all other parties from any claim connected to the transactions arising out of the divorce action and shareholdersâ€™ derivative action.Â  Here, the foundation of Southern Glassâ€™s cause of action against Angela is the order from the derivative action requiring mutual agreement between Alan and Joanne.Â  Absent that order, Angela would unquestionably have been authorized to issue the bonus checks once Joanne gave her that directive.Â  Thus, Southern Glassâ€™s claim against Angela is â€œconnected with . . . transactions arising out of the relationship among the parties as set forth in [the shareholder derivative action],â€ and therefore, the parties intended it to be covered by the release. \r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s defense of waiver.Â  Instead, we find Southern Glassâ€™s claim against Angela is barred, and therefore, summary judgment should have been entered in Angelaâ€™s favor.[2]Â  See Campbell v. Hilton Head No. 1 Pub. Serv. Dist., 354 S.C. 190, 197, 580 S.E.2d 137, 141 (2003) (reversing trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent, and instead finding â€œsummary judgment should have been granted in appellantsâ€™ favorâ€).\r\nII.Â Â  Privilege to Defamation \r\nNext, Angela argues the trial court erred by concluding the statements Southern Glass made to its human resources consultant, who it hired to dispute Angelaâ€™s claim for unemployment, were absolutely privileged.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 41-27-560 of the South Carolina Code (1986) provides that communications made from an employer to the Employment Commission, or any of its agents, representatives, or employees, in connection with an application for unemployment compensation, are privileged.Â  Angela argues the statute only protects statements made to agents of the Commission, not statements made to agents of the employer.Â  \r\nWe find Angelaâ€™s interpretation illogical considering business entities must always use either an employee or agent to communicate with the Commission.Â  Furthermore, the principles of common law provide that an absolute privilege is not lost simply because an agent is used.Â  See Rodgers v. Wise, 193 S.C. 5, 9, 7 S.E.2d 517, 518-19 (1940) (holding the attorney-client privilege was not waived when an attorney dictated a letter to a stenographer).Â  Because â€œ[a] statute is not to be construed as in derogation of common-law rights if another interpretation is reasonable,â€[3] we agree with the trial court that section 41-27-560 applies to the statements Southern Glass made to its human resource consultant.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in its grant of partial summary judgment on Angelaâ€™s counterclaim for defamation.\r\nIII.Â Â  Abuse of Process\r\nAngela next argues the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on her counterclaim for abuse of process.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nÂ To overcome summary judgment on her counterclaim for abuse of process, Angela must show there was some evidence Southern Glass had an ulterior purpose for filing its suit against her, and Southern Glass committed some â€œwillful act not proper in the regular course of the proceeding.â€Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Intâ€™l, Inc.,Â  328 S.C. 128, 136-37, 492 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997).Â  â€œ[L]iability [for abuse of process] exists not because a party merely seeks to gain a collateral advantage by using some legal process, but because the collateral objective was its sole or paramount reason for acting.â€Â  Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Intâ€™l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 75, 567 S.E.2d 251, 256 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]here is no liability where the defendant has done nothing more than carry out the process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions.â€Â  Hainer, 328 S.C. at 136, 492 S.E.2d at 107.\r\nEven assuming without deciding there was some evidence Southern Glass had an ulterior motive for bringing this action against Angela, there is no evidence Southern Glass engaged in a â€œwillful act,â€ an element essential to the abuse of process cause of action.Â  The willful act element requires â€œ[s]ome definite act . . . not authorized by the process or aimed at an object not legitimate in the use of the process.â€Â  Id.Â  Here, Southern Glass filed a lawsuit seeking to collect the money it alleges Angela disbursed without authorization.Â  There is no evidence Southern Glass engaged in any improper acts during the course of the proceeding, and we find the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in its favor on Angelaâ€™s counterclaim for abuse of process.\r\nIV.Â Â  Wrongful Termination\r\nFinally, Angela argues the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Southern Glass on her counterclaim for wrongful termination.Â  Specifically, she argues there was evidence her termination violated public policy because it was based on her refusal to pay back a duly earned wage.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough Angela was an at-will employee and therefore could be terminated at any time, for any reason, even at-will employees can bring a cause of action for wrongful termination when the employerâ€™s reason for termination violates a clear mandate of public policy.Â  Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 225, 337 S.E.2d 213, 216 (1985).Â  Our courts have found the public policy exception to clearly apply in cases where the employer either (1) requires the employee to violate the law, or (2) the reason for the employeeâ€™s termination is itself a violation of criminal law. Lawson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 340 S.C. 346, 350, 532 S.E.2d 259, 260 (2000). Angela argues there was evidence in the record supporting her counterclaim for wrongful termination because (1) her refusal to repay the bonus was the reason she was fired; (2) the Payment of Wages Act requires employees to pay all wages when due; (3) her bonus was a duly earned wage; and (4) it would be a violation of law to require an employee to return a duly earned wage in order to continue her employment.\r\nAccording to the Payment of Wages Act, employers are required to pay all wages when due.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40(a) (Supp. 2004).Â  However, employers may withhold disputed wages.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-60.Â  Here, Angelaâ€™s entitlement to her bonus was clearly disputed.Â  Because Southern Glass would have been able to withhold the bonus pursuant to the Act, we believe it was not a clear violation of public policy for it to request that Angela return the bonus.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s counterclaim for wrongful termination. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s defense of waiver; instead, summary judgment should have been granted in Angelaâ€™s favor.Â  However, we agree with the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Southern Glass on Angelaâ€™s counterclaims for defamation, abuse of process, and wrongful termination.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although no one disputes that Angela was an employee of Southern Glass at the time the release was signed, Southern Glass nevertheless argues we should not allow a non-signatory to benefit from the release.Â  However, the clear language of the release includes employees of the signatories, and â€œ[p]ublic policy does not require consideration from each party where a general release purports to release not only the paying party, but all other potential defendants, from any and all future liability.â€Â  76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 9 (1994); see also Hyman v. Ford Motor Co., 142 F.Supp.2d 735, 742 (D.S.C. 2001) (upholding a release even though beneficiary did not provide consideration). \r\n[2] Because we propose to find the release applies to Southern Glassâ€™s cause of action against Angela, we need not address her estoppel argument.Â  \r\n[3] Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 473, 608 S.E.2d 556, 561 (Ct.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Kelvin Williams appeals the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge that an individual lawfully being placed under arrest has the right to defend himself against the use of excessive force by the police officer.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliams was tried and convicted of resisting arrest and assaulting a law enforcement officer.Â  The circumstances of this case arise from Deputy Warren Gadsonâ€™s attempt to serve a family court bench warrant on Williams at his residence.Â  The facts of the resulting encounter are thereafter in dispute.Â  \r\nGadson, of the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Office, testified he knocked on Williamsâ€™ door and appropriately identified himself.Â  There was no response, but Gadson heard movement from within the apartment.Â  Gadson then obtained a key to Williamsâ€™ apartment from the complex manager and attempted to enter the premises.Â  Williams testified he did not know of Gadsonâ€™s presence until the officer attempted to enter his apartment but was stopped by a bar lock on the entry door.[1]Â  Williams asked Gadson to identify himself, and Gadson verbally identified himself and showed Williams his badge.Â  Williams testified that Gadson had inserted his foot into the opening in the doorway, and he requested that Gadson remove his foot so that the bar bolt could be removed and the door opened completely.Â  Williams testified that Gadson drew his gun and told him to open the door or he would kick it in.Â  According to Williamsâ€™ testimony, when he stepped outside Gadson charged him, tackled him, pressed his gun into his ribs, and threatened to kill him.[2]Â  At that point, Williams threw Gadson off him, and the two scuffled until Gadson subdued Williams and other officers arrived at the scene.Â  \r\nAt the close of trial, Williams requested a charge that he was justified in resisting the officerâ€™s use of excessive force in the execution of the arrest warrant.Â  The trial court denied the request.Â  Williams appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its discretion.â€Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œIt is error for the trial court to refuse to give a requested instruction which states a sound principle of law when that principle applies to the case at hand, and the principle is not otherwise included in the charge.â€Â  Id. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â  If there is any evidence to support a charge, the trial court should grant the request.Â  State v. Burris, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  The requesting party must have been prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s failure to give the instruction in order to warrant reversal on appeal.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilliams argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that an individual being arrested is permitted to defend himself against excessive force by the arresting officer during a lawful arrest.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThis case actually involves two issues, one of which presents a novel question in South Carolina.Â  First, we must determine whether the evidence presented at trial supports giving the requested charge.Â  In addition, we must consider whether the charge requested in this case is based on a sound principle of law.Â  South Carolina has yet to clearly and definitively recognize the right of a suspect to resist excessive force by a police officer when such force is incident to a lawful arrest.Â  We will discuss each issue in turn.Â  \r\nI.Â  Was the requested charge warranted under the evidence presented?\r\nWilliams testified that as he opened the apartment door and stepped across the threshold, Gadson â€œthrew me to the ground, took his gun, shoved it up into my ribs.Â  And he told me that if I didnâ€™t stop he was going to kill me.Â  And I threw [Deputy Gadson] off me.â€Â  In evaluating the record for evidence supporting Williamsâ€™ position, we must consider all the evidence presented and consider what reasonable inferences a jury could draw therefrom.Â  According to Williamsâ€™ testimony, he resisted Gadson only in response to the unprovoked use of force against him. \r\nThis case is distinguishable from State v. Weaver, 265 S.C. 130, 217 S.E.2d 31 (1975), and State v. Galloway, 305 S.C. 258, 407 S.E.2d 662 (Ct. App. 1991).Â Â Â  In Weaver, the accused testified he protested his arrest and was handcuffed by three officers and beaten by a fourth one.Â  He claimed that he did not attack any officer or resist arrest.Â  Id. at 135, 217 S.E.2d at 33.Â  The supreme court concluded Weaver could not assert compliance with the arrest and also claim that his actions were excused due to the arresting officersâ€™ use of excessive force.Â  Id. at 137, 217 S.E.2d at 34.Â  \r\nCiting Weaver as controlling authority, this court likewise disposed of the same issue in Galloway.Â  Galloway, 305 S.C. at 266-67, 407 S.E.2d at 667.Â  There the accused claimed that he did not resist arrest, and his acts of resistance were fabricated by police in order to prevent him from filing a civil lawsuit for injuries he sustained during the incident.Â  Id. at 262, 407 S.E.2d at 665.\r\nIn this case, the State points to Williamsâ€™ testimony during cross-examination that he did not respond to Officer Gadson with force.Â  In the context of Williamsâ€™ entire testimony, we interpret that response by Williams to mean that during the initial phase of the encounter he cooperated with Officer Gadson and did not use force until after the officer employed excessive force against him.Â  Williams admitted he â€œthrew offâ€ Gadson.Â  He conceded that he and Gadson had physical contact and struggled.Â  Such a progression of events supports Williamsâ€™ argument that he was entitled to the requested charge and does not render his testimony inconsistent.Â  Therefore, the evidence in the record supports the giving of the requested charge.Â  \r\nIn order to warrant a new trial, the courtâ€™s failure to give a requested jury instruction must be prejudicial.Â  In the instant case, the jury was charged as follows regarding assaulting an officer while resisting a lawful arrest:\r\n\r\n  The State must prove . . . that the defendant knowingly and willfully assaulted, beat or wounded a law enforcement officer who was serving, executing or attempting to serve a legal writ or process; or in other words, an arrest warrant, or that the defendant assaulted, beat, or wounded an officer when the defendant was resisting arrest being made by a person that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known was a law enforcement officer.Â Â  \r\n\r\nNeither this charge, nor any of the other general charges given the jury, allowed the members to consider whether Williamsâ€™ resistance could have been justified in response to excessive force by Gadson.Â  Had the jury chosen to believe Williamsâ€™ version of events, it could have concluded that Williamsâ€™ actions were justified.Â  If so, the jury would have needed to understand the legal implications of that factual conclusion in order to apply it to the verdict.Â  Therefore, the failure to give the requested instruction was prejudicial.\r\nII.Â Does the requested charge accurately reflect the law of this State?\r\nHaving determined that the evidence warranted such a charge, we must now reach the issue of whether the requested charge accurately reflects the law of South Carolina.Â  We conclude that South Carolina does recognize a personâ€™s right to use reasonable force to defend against the use of excessive force by a police officer incident to a lawful arrest.Â  \r\nWeaver and Galloway did not require the court to address this precise issue since the facts in those cases did not warrant the giving of such a charge.Â  Therefore, we will look to our own general principles of law as well as the law of other jurisdictions for instruction.Â  In McCracken v. Commonwealth, 572 S.E.2d 493 (Va. App. 2002), the court held that an individual has the right to resist excessive force during a lawful arrest.Â  â€œA lawful arrest, when made with unlawful force, may be resisted.â€Â  Id. at 497.Â  North Carolina and Georgia have also recognized such a right.Â  See State v. Anderson, 253 S.E.2d 48, 51 (N.C. App. 1979) (â€œ[T]he right to use force to defend oneself against the excessive use of force during an arrest may arise despite the lawfulness of the arrest . . . .â€); see also Cunningham v. State, 471 S.E.2d 273, 274 (Ga. App. 1996) (approving a jury charge stating â€œthat a person being arrested, even though the arrest itself is lawful, has the right to resist the use of excessive and unlawful force by those making the arrest to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the degree of resistance used is necessary to defend himself against the officerâ€™s use of unlawful or excessive forceâ€).Â  Numerous other jurisdictions have recognized an arresteeâ€™s right to self-defense as well.Â  See generally Dag E. Ytreberg, J.D., Annotation, Right to Resist Excessive Force Used in Accomplishing Lawful Arrest, 77 A.L.R. 3d 281 (2005).\r\nThere is no question that South Carolina allows a police officer to use force reasonably necessary to effect an arrest.Â  See State v.

Burney, of Laurens; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  World Finance Corporation of South Carolina and World Acceptance Corporation (â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order denying their motion to compel arbitration.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBeginning in March 2001 through July 2002, Tawanda Simpson entered into a series of consumer loan transactions with Appellants.Â  In conjunction with each of these loan agreements, Simpson signed an arbitration agreement, which provided that the parties agreed to settle all disputes and claims through arbitration.Â  \r\nIn late 2002, after Simpson had paid her loan in full, former employees of Appellants used Simpsonâ€™s personal financial information to illegally procure loans and embezzle the proceeds from those loans.[1]Â  Upon discovering the misuse of her personal information, Simpson filed suit against Appellants seeking a jury trial for damages arising out of the following causes of action:Â  intentional infliction of emotional distress; negligence; negligent hiring/supervision; and unfair trade practices.Â  In response, Appellants denied the allegations and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and a motion to compel arbitration. \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court denied Appellantsâ€™ motions to dismiss and to compel arbitration.Â  In reaching this decision, the court found the creditor/debtor relationship between Appellants and Simpson ended once Simpson satisfied her loan in full.Â  As a result, the court concluded the â€œeffectiveness of the arbitration clause ceased when the relationship of the parties ceased.â€Â  The court also held the tort claims raised by Simpson were not subject to arbitration because the acts of Appellantsâ€™ employees were â€œcompletely independent of the loan agreement.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe question whether a claim is subject to arbitration is a matter of judicial determination, unless the parties have provided otherwise.Â  Appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is subject to de novo review.â€Â  Chassereau v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 363 S.C. 628, 631, 611 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in denying their motion to compel arbitration.[2]Â  Specifically, they contend that once the court determined that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties, the courtâ€™s â€œdecisional functionâ€ was completed and any decisions regarding the validity of the agreement and the arbitrability of Simpsonâ€™s claims were to be decided by an arbitrator.Â  Even if the circuit court was authorized to determine the effectiveness of the agreement, Appellants claim the broad terms of the arbitration agreement encompassed any disputes beyond the expiration of the underlying loan transactions between the parties.Â  \r\n As a threshold matter, we find Appellantsâ€™ argument that the circuit courtâ€™s authority was strictly limited to determining whether the parties entered into an arbitration agreement is not properly before this court.Â  First, Appellants did not raise this precise argument in their motion to compel arbitration or during the hearing before the circuit court.Â  Secondly, the circuit court did not address this issue in its order, but instead, only ruled on the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement.Â  Appellants did not file a motion pursuant to Rule 59 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to challenge this omission.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (recognizing that in order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court); Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 502, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting an issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment). \r\nIn terms of the merits of Appellantsâ€™ motion to compel arbitration, we turn to recently established precedent.Â  â€œArbitration is a matter of contract, and the range of issues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of the agreement.â€Â  Palmetto Homes, Inc. v. Bradley, 357 S.C. 485, 492, 593 S.E.2d 480, 484 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied (July 8, 2005).Â  Our supreme court has outlined the analytical framework for determining whether a particular claim is subject to arbitration.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 597, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118-19 (2001).Â  In Zabinski, the court stated:\r\n\r\n  To decide whether an arbitration agreement encompasses a dispute, a court must determine whether the factual allegations underlying the claim are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause, regardless of the label assigned to the claim. Hinson v. Jusco Co., 868 F.Supp. 145 (D.S.C. 1994); S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal, 312 S.C. 559, 437 S.E.2d 22 (1993).Â  Any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration. Towles, supra.Â  Furthermore, unless the court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered. Great W. Coal, 312 S.C. at 564, 437 S.E.2d at 25.Â  A motion to compel arbitration made pursuant to an arbitration clause in a written contract should only be denied where the clause is not susceptible to any interpretation which would cover the asserted dispute. Â Tritech, supra.\r\n\r\nId. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118-19.Â  The court further articulated that â€œ[a] broadly-worded arbitration clause applies to disputes that do not arise under the governing contract when a â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.â€Â  Id. at 119, 553 S.E.2d at 598.Â  \r\nWith respect to tort claims, the supreme court noted the test from other jurisdictions stating, â€œthe focus should be on the factual allegations contained in the petition rather than on the legal causes of actions asserted.â€Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597 n.4, 553 S.E.2d at 119 n.4.Â  The court elaborated:\r\n\r\n  The test is based on a determination of whether the particular tort claim is so interwoven with the contract that it could not stand alone.Â  If the tort and contract claims are so interwoven, both are arbitrable.Â  On the other hand, if the tort claim is completely independent of the contract and could be maintained without reference to the contract, the tort claim is not arbitrable. \r\n\r\nId.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Shortly after the supreme court issued its decision in Zabinski, this court had the opportunity to apply the principles set forth and to interpret the â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ test.Â  Vestry &amp; Church Wardens of the Church of the Holy Cross v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 356 S.C. 202, 588 S.E.2d 136 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Although this court utilized the Zabinski principles to analyze the question of whether separate arbitration agreements previously executed by the parties mandated arbitration for the claims in dispute, we believe the holding is, nevertheless, instructive.Â  In Vestry, we concluded, â€œthe mere fact that an arbitration clause might apply to matters beyond the express scope of the underlying contract does not alone imply that the clause should apply to every dispute between the parties.â€Â  Id. at 209, 588 S.E.2d at 140.Â  \r\nThe arbitration agreement in the instant case provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND AND NATURE BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN AGREEMENT, OR ARISING OUT OF ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER OR ARISING OUT OF ANY PRIOR OR FUTURE DEALINGS BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER, SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION AND SETTLED BY ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT, THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (THE â€œARBITRATION RULES OF THE AAAâ€), AND THIS AGREEMENT. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  We would also note the arbitration agreement contained a provision that stated, â€œThis Agreement applies even if the Loan Agreement is paid in full, charged-off by Lender, or discharged in Bankruptcy.â€ \r\nGiven the broadly worded terms of the arbitration agreement, it is plausible that one could initially conclude that Simpsonâ€™s claims were subject to arbitration.Â  However, as discussed above, the terms alone are not dispositive of this determination.Â  Instead, we are required to focus on the factual allegations of the underlying causes of action to analyze whether a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ existed between the claims and the loan contract.Â Â Â  Moreover, because Simpson had satisfied her loan in full at the time her claims arose, we must also look at the partiesâ€™ intent to assess whether the arbitration agreement extended beyond the termination of the contract.Â  See Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 41, 524 S.E.2d 839, 846 (Ct. App. 1999)(â€œWhen a party invokes an arbitration clause after the contractual relationship between the parties has ended, the partiesâ€™ intent governs whether the clauseâ€™s authority extends beyond the termination of the contract.â€); see Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (â€œArbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.â€).Â  \r\nApplying the foregoing principles to the specific facts of this case, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that Simpsonâ€™s claims were not subject to arbitration. Â Initially, we reject Appellantsâ€™ contention that the claims arose out of the loan agreement simply because Appellantsâ€™ employees would not have had access to Simpsonâ€™s personal financial information but for the loan agreement.Â  Although Appellantsâ€™ assertion is factually accurate, it disregards the analytical framework for determining whether claims are arbitrable.Â  Simpsonâ€™s tort claims are independent of the loan agreement and require no reference to the contract.Â  At the time Appellantsâ€™ employees misused Simpsonâ€™s personal financial information, Simpson had paid off her loan in full.Â  Thus, a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ does not exist between Simpsonâ€™s claims and the loan agreement.Â  Moreover, it is inconceivable that Simpson intended to agree to maintain a contractual relationship with Appellants in perpetuity after she paid off her loan.Â  Given Simpson had satisfied her contractual obligation, no further dealings with Appellants were necessary.Â  Finally, we do not believe she could have foreseen the future tortious conduct of Appellantsâ€™ employees at the time she entered into the loan agreements.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we believe our holding is consistent with this courtâ€™s recent decision in Chassereau v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 363 S.C. 628, 611 S.E.2d 305 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In Chassereau, a homeowner entered into a contract for the construction of a pool by Global-Sun Pools.Â  The contract contained an arbitration provision that applied to â€œany disputes arising in any manner relating to this agreement.â€Â  Id. at 633, 611 S.E.2d at 307.Â Â  After construction was completed, the homeowner began to experience problems with the pool.Â  Because Global-Sun Pools failed to repair the pool, the homeowner stopped making payments on the pool.Â  Id. at 630, 611 S.E.2d at 306.Â  A few months later, the homeowner filed a complaint against the pool company and one of its employees, alleging this employee and other employees made a series of harassing and intimidating telephone calls to her workplace.Â  The homeowner claimed the pool companyâ€™s employees made defamatory statements about her to her co-workers and they disclosed information regarding her personal finances.Â  Additionally, the homeowner asserted these same employees made numerous telephone calls to her home as well as to her relatives in an effort to intimidate and harass her.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn her complaint, the homeowner sought damages based on causes of action for defamation, violation of South Carolina Code of Laws section 16-17-430 which prohibits unlawful use of a telephone, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Id. at 631, 611 S.E.2d at 306.Â  The pool company and its employee filed a motion to compel arbitration, alleging the provisions of the construction contract mandated arbitration.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, finding â€œ[t]he complaint is based upon tortious conduct of the employees of [Global-Sun Pools] unrelated to the contractâ€ and the â€œallegations of the complaint do not arise out of nor do they relate to the contract[.]â€Â  Id. at 631, 611 S.E.2d at 306-07.\r\nOn appeal, this court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  In so holding, we found the homeownerâ€™s claims did not arise out of the construction contract and could be proved independently of the contract.Â  We further concluded the causes of action alleged in the complaint â€œconstitute[d] tortious behavior that the parties . . . could not have reasonably foreseen and for which we seriously doubt they intended to provide a limited means of redress.â€Â  Id. at 634, 611 S.E.2d at 308.\r\nSimilar to the homeownerâ€™s tort claims in Chassereau, Simpsonâ€™s tort claims did not arise out of the loan agreement and could be proved independently of this agreement.Â  Although we are cognizant of the policy favoring arbitration, we do not believe arbitration is warranted for Simpsonâ€™s claims.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (â€œThe policy of the United States and South Carolina is to favor arbitration of disputes.â€). \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The former employees pleaded guilty for these offenses and were sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. \r\n[2]Â  Although Appellants raise four issues in their brief, we have consolidated these issues in the interest of brevity and clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4060","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia and Ernest Charles Grose, Jr., of Greenwood, for Appellant.Â  \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Â Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey A. Jacobs, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Otis James Compton appeals his convictions for murder, burglary in the first degree, armed robbery, possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a violent crime, and malicious injury to real property.Â  He contends an agreement granted him immunity from prosecution on the charges in exchange for his cooperation with a police investigation.Â  Additionally, he raises several evidentiary and constitutional issues.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 1999, Johnny Hanna was murdered in his home during an apparent burglary.Â  Compton was originally questioned about the crime that same month.Â  In November 1999, Compton pled guilty to several unrelated counts of burglary and was sentenced to a total of fifteen years imprisonment.Â  Compton remained a person of interest in the Hanna murder.Â  \r\nIn January 2000, Compton was placed in a holding cell along with Tracey Black after they each had pled guilty to charges unrelated to the Hanna murder.Â  According to Black, Compton initiated a discussion regarding the Hanna murder and told Black, â€œhe had done what he had to do.â€Â  Black informed investigators of this conversation.Â  In March 2000, Black was transferred to the same prison where Compton was housed.Â  He was told by investigators to â€œlisten to Mr. Compton and see if he would talk about the case any more or what he had done or any involvement in it.Â  They told me that I could not question the guy or pursue nothing toward him, just listen.â€Â  Black was eventually placed in a cell with Compton and relayed to police several conversations in which Compton admitted taking part in the burglary and murder of Hanna.Â  \r\nIn July 2000, Compton was in the Abbeville County Courthouse for the trial of his wife on unrelated charges.Â  While there, he sought out Sheriff Goodwin regarding the Hanna investigation.Â  Subsequently, Sheriff Goodwin, Lieutenant Templeton, Solicitor Townes Jones, and Comptonâ€™s attorney, Joe Smithdeal, met at Smithdealâ€™s office to talk about an agreement.Â  The agreement at issue was labeled â€œPlea Agreementâ€ and required Compton to â€œfully and truthfully cooperate . . . in their investigation of the events involving the death of Johnny Hanna.â€Â  In exchange, the State agreed â€œto reduce the sentences by all reasonable means on [the unrelated burglary charges] to Burglary Second Degree, Non-Violent, for Seven and One-half (7-1/2) years, to run concurrent with each other and concurrent with all other sentences now serving, within 18 months of arrest or within 2 years from the date of this agreement.â€Â  \r\nCompton subsequently admitted he was present at the time of the murder of Hanna.Â  He told investigators that two other men took part in the crime and that he drove the getaway vehicle. Â Compton was indicted for the murder of Hanna, as well as other related charges.Â  Before trial, Compton moved to quash the indictment or suppress his statements to police on the grounds that the information was provided subject to an immunity agreement between Compton and the solicitor.Â  The motion also alleged the evidence should be suppressed because it violated Rule 410, SCRE,[1] and the investigators violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding there was no reasonable expectation of immunity, the agreement was not entered into pursuant to plea negotiations, and Compton breached the agreement by failing to pass the polygraph test.Â  \r\nCompton was tried for and convicted of Hannaâ€™s murder and all other related offenses.Â  He appeals all convictions.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  See State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€).Â  â€œOn review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829 (internal citations omitted).Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 353, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Immunity\r\nCompton contends his agreement to cooperate in the investigation of the murder of Hanna granted him immunity from prosecution on any related charges.Â  We disagree.\r\nLooking at the agreement, there is nothing to evidence an understanding between the parties that Compton could not be prosecuted for the Hanna murder.Â  It is generally recognized that immunity agreements and plea agreements are to be construed in accordance with general contract principles.Â  See U.S. v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 300 (4th Cir. 1986) (â€œIn the process of determining whether disputed plea agreements have been formed or performed, courts have necessarily drawn on the most relevant body of developed rules\r\nand principles of private law, those pertaining to the formation and interpretation of commercial contracts.â€).Â  Accordingly, this court should not read terms or conditions into the contract that the parties did not intend.Â  See Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003); McPherson v. J.E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183, 204, 33 S.E.2d 501, 509 (1945).Â  The court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.Â  Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994).Â  In Harvey, the court discussed the interpretation of immunity and plea agreements:Â  \r\n\r\nPrivate law interpretive principles may be wholly dispositive in an appropriate case.Â  For example, whether a written agreement is ambiguous or unambiguous on its face should ordinarily be decided by the courts as a matter of law.Â  If it is unambiguous as a matter of law, and there is no suggestion of government overreaching of any kind, the agreement should be interpreted and enforced accordingly.Â  Neither side should be able, any more than would be private contracting parties, unilaterally to renege or seek modification simply because of uninduced mistake or change of mind.Â  \r\n\r\nHarvey, at 300.\r\nIn the instant case, the agreement makes no mention of immunity from prosecution for any crime.Â  In fact the word immunity, or any variation thereof, is nowhere to be found in the four corners of the document.Â  â€œProsecutionâ€ is mentioned only once in relation to the Stateâ€™s â€œprosecutionâ€ of Compton for perjury if he lied to investigators.Â  The agreement is unambiguous.Â  It clearly indicates the Stateâ€™s intentionâ€”to get reliable information that could assist in solving the murder case.Â  Comptonâ€™s intention is equally clearâ€”to get a reduction in the sentences for his burglary convictions.Â  The burglary convictions are specifically referenced by indictment numbers, and the reduction sought is set forth in specific terms.Â  The agreement is simply a contract of cooperation between the parties.Â  To characterize the agreement as something more would be to read into it terms that simply are not there.Â  \r\nFurthermore, there is no argument by Compton that the investigators overreached or coerced him into making the agreement.Â  It was entered into after Compton initiated contact with Sheriff Goodwin in the hopes of procuring a reduction on his already imposed burglary sentence.Â  There is no indication the agreement contemplated the granting of immunity from prosecution on charges relating to the Hanna murder in exchange for Comptonâ€™s testimony.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to quash the indictments brought against Compton based upon this agreement. [2] \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 410, SCRE.\r\nCompton contends the trial court erred in refusing to exclude his statements under Rule 410, SCRE, as the statements were made in the course of plea negotiations.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 410 provides that evidence of a guilty plea that is later withdrawn or evidence of a plea of nolo contendere is inadmissible against a defendant.Â  Furthermore, statements made in the course of court proceedings related to such pleas are not admissible.Â  Likewise, a statement made during plea negotiations with a prosecuting authority, even if a guilty plea is not entered or is later withdrawn, is not admissible.\r\nThe unequivocal language of Rule 410 precludes its application in the instant case.Â  The discussions between Compton, the solicitor, and investigators were not in furtherance of Compton making a plea on any charges.Â  The discussions came after he already pled guilty to burglary charges and before any charges were brought related to the Hanna murder.Â  Nothing in the record indicates Compton ever offered to plead guilty or planned to plead guilty to the Hanna murder in exchange for anything from the State.Â  The only negotiations were related to the reduction in the sentence for the burglary charges.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to exclude the statements under Rule 410, SCRE.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Promise of LeniencyÂ Â Â  \r\nCompton contends the trial court erred in failing to exclude his confessions on the grounds that they were made after a promise of leniency and were, therefore, not voluntary.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe test for determining the admissibility of a statement is whether it was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given under the totality of the circumstances.Â  A statement induced by a promise of leniency is involuntary only if so connected with the inducement as to be a consequence of the promise.â€Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 660, 552 S.E.2d 745, 757 (2001) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)) (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn this case, the record indicates Compton was never told his statements would not be used against him.Â  Nothing brought out in the Jackson v. Denno[3] hearing or in the arguments to quash the indictments indicated Compton made the statements involuntarily and based upon a promise of leniency.Â  Additionally, he sought out the sheriff in order to make a deal to reduce his burglary sentence in exchange for information about a separate matter.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly concluded the statements were given knowingly and voluntarily by Compton and were properly presented to the jury for consideration.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Right to Counsel\r\nCompton contends the court erred in failing to suppress his statements because the State violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by having Tracey Black initiate contact as a government informant.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] attaches only â€˜post-indictment,â€™ at least in the questioning/statement setting.â€Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 15, 515 S.E.2d, 508, 515 (1999) (citing Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U.S. 344 (1990)).Â  â€œThe Sixth Amendment right does not attach simply because the defendant has been arrested or because the investigation has focused on him.â€Â  State v. Register, 323 S.C. 471, 477, 476 S.E.2d 153, 157 (1996) (citing Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293 (1966)).Â  Furthermore, South Carolina follows the federal constitutional rule that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific; the mere fact counsel is appointed in one matter does not invoke the right to counsel in another, unrelated matter.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 661, 552 S.E.2d 745, 758 (2001) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)).Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Compton was not indicted for the charges related to the Hanna murder until after he provided information to Black.Â  While he was represented on the unrelated burglary charges and at the making of the agreement, that fact does not give rise to a Sixth Amendment violation regarding information gathered about the Hanna murder.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly admitted evidence of Comptonâ€™s statements at trial.Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Examination of Witness\r\nCompton contends the trial court erred in limiting his ability to examine Solicitor Jones.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe Sixth Amendment rights to notice, confrontation, and compulsory process guarantee that a criminal charge may be answered through the calling and interrogation of favorable witnesses, the cross-examination of adverse witnesses, and the orderly introduction of evidence.â€Â  State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994).Â  â€œThis does not mean, however, that trial courts conducting criminal trials lose their usual discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination.â€Â  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 33-34, 538 S.E.2d 248, 255 (2000).Â  \r\nComptonâ€™s counsel sought to elicit testimony from Solicitor Jones to support the theory that the agreement called for Compton to be immune from prosecution in the Hanna murder.Â  Counsel also sought testimony about Jonesâ€™ belief that Comptonâ€™s attorney would continue to be involved in the case.Â  Such testimony was not relevant to the issue of Comptonâ€™s guilt or innocence.Â  The jury was not entitled to determine whether the agreement provided transactional immunity, as that was a question of contract interpretation before the court.Â  Additionally, the statement sought to be admitted to impeach the solicitor, while not relevant, was also based upon pure speculation that counsel would continue in his involvement.Â  As such, we find no error on the part of the trial court in limiting the examination of Solicitor Jones or in refusing to allow Compton to impeach Jones using a prior statement that was purely speculative.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the agreement is unambiguous and does not intend to grant immunity to Compton from prosecution on charges related to the Hanna murder.Â  Additionally, we find the statements given by Compton were properly admitted by the trial court.Â  We conclude there was no violation of Comptonâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by placing Black in the same prison cell to act as a conduit of information.Â  Finally, we find the limitation of Comptonâ€™s examination of Solicitor Jones was proper.Â  Accordingly, Comptonâ€™s convictions and sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 410 generally discusses the inadmissibility of withdrawn pleas and statements made during plea negotiations.Â  \r\n[2] Both parties also discuss in their briefs whether the agreement was breached and whether the State was required to honor the agreement.Â  The issue before this court is whether the agreement granted Compton immunity from prosecution based upon his cooperation and whether the trial court erred in refusing to quash the indictments.Â  We are therefore precluded from addressing any contention related to an alleged breach of the agreement.Â  \r\n[3] 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4061","title":"Doe v.

Howe, III, and Gedney M. Howe, III, P.A., for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Howe and his law firm.Â  Doe appeals.Â  We affirm the grant of summary judgment on Doeâ€™s action for legal malpractice, vacate the dismissal of Doeâ€™s action for breach of fiduciary duty, and remand the breach of fiduciary duty claim for a written order pursuant to our opinion in Bowen v. Lee Process Systems Co.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWe set forth the facts below, as we must, viewed in the light most favorable to Doe, the party against whom the trial judge granted summary judgment.Â  We glean these facts from three sources:Â  the allegations of the pleadings, the testimony given in depositions, and the statements of fact given in affidavits.Â  We assume these facts are true only for the purpose of the summary judgment motion and determine merely whether they, when properly viewed, present triable issues.[2]\r\nDoe, who was born September 2, 1962, is Howeâ€™s former client.Â  From 1968 to 1980, Doe attended Porter-Gaud, a private school in Charleston.Â  In 1977, Edward Fischer, a teacher at Porter-Gaud, began sexually molesting Doe.Â  At the time, Doe was fourteen years old and in the ninth grade.Â  Doe and Fischer continued to have sexual contact until 1982, two years after Doe became an adult and no longer attended Porter-Gaud.\r\nSeventeen years later, in June 1999, Doe retained Howe and Howeâ€™s brother, Donald Howe, to represent him in an action against Porter-Gaud arising from the abuse Doe said Fischer inflicted upon him.Â  Howe expressed concern to Doe early on that the statute of limitations presented a problem and could prevent Doe from recovering on any claim against Porter-Gaud.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding the statute of limitations, Porter-Gaud offered to settle Doeâ€™s claim.Â  Based upon Howeâ€™s advice and without filing suit, Doe settled with Porter-Gaud for $88,000 in May 2000.Â  A few months later, in October 2000, a parent of another of Fischerâ€™s victims received jury verdicts against Porter-Gaud and the estates of two former officials of the school totaling $105 million dollars.Â  The attorneys who obtained these verdicts had also succeeded in defeating summary judgment on at least four occasions.Â  \r\nAfter learning of the verdicts, Doe contacted Donald Howe the following month to inquire about the possibility of rescinding his settlement with Porter-Gaud.Â  According to Doe, Donald Howe knew of no way to set aside the settlement, but nevertheless agreed to talk with his brother about the matter.Â  Doe stated he never received an answer to his inquiry from either Donald Howe or Gedney Howe.Â  \r\nThe attorneys who obtained the multi-million dollar verdict later settled all the sexual abuse cases brought against the Porter-Gaud defendants, with each student claimant receiving an average of $2 million dollars each.Â  \r\nAfter Doe settled with Porter-Gaud, he discovered Howe had enrolled his son in Porter-Gaud during the time Howe had represented Doe.Â  Doe also learned Howe had made significant financial contributions to Porter-Gaud since 1996.Â  Howe never divulged to Doe these personal relationships with Porter-Gaud.Â  In addition, Doe learned in 2001 that Howe represented Porter-Gaud in a bad-faith action against its insurer regarding payment of claims made by Fischerâ€™s victims and their parents.\r\nDoe then brought the present action.Â  The trial judge subsequently granted Howeâ€™s motion for summary judgment, holding that, because Doeâ€™s action against Porter-Gaud would have been untimely, Doe could not provide evidence that he â€œâ€˜most probablyâ€™ would have received a larger settlement than he didâ€ or that â€œhe â€˜most probablyâ€™ would have prevailed on the underlying claim at trial.â€Â  \r\nIn the same order, the trial judge denied a motion by Doe to recuse himself based on disclosures that (1) the judge had contacted Howe on an unrelated matter and (2) the judgeâ€™s law clerk had applied for a position with the law firm of one of Howeâ€™s attorneys.Â  \r\nDoe filed this appeal after the trial judge denied his motion for reconsideration.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Doe contends the trial judge abused his discretion in failing to disqualify himself.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the summary judgment hearing, the trial judge invited counsel for both parties to his chambers to disclose that he had previously contacted Howe to inquire whom his wife should contact to apply for a position at the new Charleston School of Law.Â  He did not, however, ask Howe to otherwise assist his wife in securing employment with the school and he did not know of anything that indicated Howe did in fact exercise any influence on her behalf.Â  \r\nTwo days after the hearing, the judge also disclosed to attorneys for the parties that his law clerk had an employment application pending with the law firm representing Howe.Â  He assured counsel he would not allow the law clerk to have any further involvement with the case for that reason.Â  \r\nIn support of his claim of judicial prejudice in this case, Doe argues (1) he was highly suspicious and mistrustful of people and the legal system because of his victimization by Fischer, Porter-Gaud, and Howe; (2) the trial judge â€œgratuitouslyâ€ included the issue of damages in his ruling; (3) Howe had already made an unsuccessful motion before another judge in this case for summary judgment on the ground of the running of the statute of limitations; and (4) the trial judgeâ€™s, to quote Doeâ€™s brief, â€œabhorrenceâ€ of deciding a matter involving an attorney influenced the judgeâ€™s decision in this case.\r\nAs to the first contention, we are not aware of any decision recognizing the emotional fragility of a litigant as a ground for mandatory disqualification of a trial judge.Â  Further, Doe cites no authority for this proposition in his brief.Â  In any case, we hold the emotional fragility of a litigant, without more, provides no basis for disqualification of a judge. \r\nAs to the second contention, the mere fact that a judge includes an issue not raised by the parties does not indicate bias or prejudice.Â  It is not at all unusual for a judge to include in an order an issue not raised by a party.[3]Â  Besides, there are rules by which a party can challenge an order that includes matters not properly before the court.[4]Â  The record does not suggest that Doe attempted to avail himself of these procedures.\r\nAs to the third contention, the fact that a judge would reach an outcome different from that reached by another judge does not give rise to an inference of prejudice.Â  Judges differ all the time in their approach to the law.Â  One need only look at the number of dissenting and concurring opinions that sometimes accompany appellate court decisions or at the number of times an appellate court reverses the decisions of other tribunals.[5]\r\nAnd as to the fourth contention, although the trial judge expressed a dislike of having to sit in judgment of lawyers, he also said â€œit is what judges must do.â€Â  Judging others is not an easy task.Â  Just because a judge may dislike having to make a decision in a particular kind of case does not translate into his or her being unable to make an impartial and well-reasoned decision.Â  What every litigant has a right to expect from a judge is that he or she be fair[6] and, to paraphrase the inscription that appears on the seal of this court, he or she give the litigant his or her due, no more and no less.Â  This we are satisfied the trial judge endeavored to do in this instance.Â  His acknowledgment of the grave responsibility that judges have in deciding cases tells us as much.\r\nâ€œUnder South Carolina law, if there is no evidence of judicial prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal.â€[7]Â  â€œIt is not enough for a party to allege bias; a party seeking disqualification of a judge must show some evidence of bias or prejudice.â€[8]Â  \r\nBecause Doe made no showing here of actual prejudice, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to disqualify himself.Â  If anything, the trial judge demonstrated sensitivity toward any concerns Doe might have had regarding his impartiality by voluntarily making full disclosure of his and his law clerkâ€™s contacts with Howe and Howeâ€™s counsel.\r\n2.Â  Doe contends the trial judge improperly granted summary judgment on the basis that his underlying cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nAs we understand from his brief, Doe contends that, under Rule 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and Black v. Lexington School District No. 2,[9] the question of whether the statute of limitations barred his underlying action was a matter for jury determination.Â  He further contends evidence that â€œcompetent attorneys did, in fact, defeat summary judgment on the statute of limitations in cases exactly like [his case]â€ was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of limitations was an insurmountable bar to his claim against Porter-Gaud.Â  He makes no contention that a triable issue of fact exists regarding whether the statute of limitations would have been raised as an affirmative defense in the underlying action.[10]Â  \r\nWe recognize, as Doe argues, the supreme court in Black stated â€œthe issue of whether a defendant is estopped from claiming the statute of limitations is ordinarily a question of factâ€;[11] however, in the very same sentence in the opinion the court also noted that, nevertheless, â€œsummary judgment is appropriate where there is no evidence of conduct on the defendantâ€™s part warranting estoppel.â€[12]Â  We, too, hold that, although genuine issues of material fact regarding the applicability of the statute of limitations on an underlying case may prevent summary judgment on a legal malpractice action arising from that case, no such issues are present in this case.\r\nTo recover for legal malpractice, a plaintiff must prove the following:Â  (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship, (2) a breach of duty by the attorney, (3) damage to the client, and (4) proximate cause of the clientâ€™s damages by the breach.[13]Â  As to damages, the plaintiff must show he or she â€œmost probably would have been successful in the underlying suit if the attorney had not committed the alleged malpractice.â€[14]Â  The question of the success of the underlying claim, if suit had been brought, is a question of law.[15]Â  \r\nDoe testified Fischer molested him from 1977 until 1982.Â  Doe acknowledged he knew Fischerâ€™s actions were wrong when they occurred and said he had thought about what Fischer did to him at least once a day ever since the acts took place.Â  Even assuming each act of molestation gave rise to a distinct cause of action, the statute of limitations would have expired in 1988, six years after the last act of molestation in 1982, and more than ten years before Doe even retained Howe, which occurred in 1999.Â  \r\nBecause nothing in the record suggests that a dispute exists regarding any of the factual issues regarding the applicability of the statute of limitations in the underlying case, such as estoppel or some discrepancy as to the operative dates, we hold Doeâ€™s claim against Porter-Gaud, as a matter of law, had lapsed long before Howe undertook to represent him.[16]Â  The trial judge, therefore, correctly concluded Doe could not, as a matter of law, prove his claim of legal malpractice against Howe because the underlying action would not have been successful in that the statute of limitations would have barred Doe from maintaining it.[17]Â  \r\nWe further reject Doeâ€™s argument that, had he been aware of Howeâ€™s loyalties to Porter-Gaud, he would have dismissed Howe and hired another attorney who would have overcome the statute of limitations bar.Â  This argument provides at best only a subjective assessment of the viability of Doeâ€™s underlying action against Porter-Gaud.Â  The successful defeat of the statute of limitations defense in another case, even one involving a plaintiff who was substantially similar to Doe, does not create an issue of fact as to whether the statute of limitations had run on Doeâ€™s action against Porter-Gaud.[18]Â  \r\n3.Â  Doe further argues the trial judge erred in concluding the expert opinions he presented did not create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment.Â  \r\nThe opinions on which Doe relied came from Gregory B. Adams, a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law, and J. David Flowers, a Greenville attorney.Â  \r\nAccording to Adams, (1) Howe had an obligation to disclose the relationship between himself and Porter-Gaud; (2) if Howe had informed Doe of the potential conflicts of interests regarding a lawsuit against Porter-Gaud, Doe would have retained the attorneys who were representing other plaintiffs suing Porter-Gaud; and (3) consequently, Doe would have shared in the lucrative settlement and recovered much more than what he agreed to accept on Howeâ€™s advice.Â  \r\nAside from whether we now need to address the question related to Adamsâ€™ affidavit because of our holding that the statute of limitations barred the underlying action, the question of whether the opinions offered by Adams created an issue of material fact in this case is not properly before us.Â  The trial judge did not address the impact of Adamsâ€™ statements, and Doe did not raise this issue in his motion for reconsideration. [19] \r\nTurning to the statements from Flowers, we agree with the trial judge that this expert witness did not assert anything that would create an issue of material fact warranting denial of summary judgment in this case.Â  \r\nAccording to Flowers, â€œDoe most probably would have defeated Porter-Gaudâ€™s defenses if his case had been filed and zealously pursued.â€Â  In addition, Flowers noted that, until the present case, Porter-Gaud had been unsuccessful in obtaining dismissals of other claims arising from Fischerâ€™s misconduct.Â  He further stated his opinion was â€œnot â€˜mere speculation,â€™â€ but was â€œbased on the record and experience of the prior litigation which lasted years, and on the defendantsâ€™ apparently newfound belief in the strength of cases like Doeâ€™s.â€Â  \r\nThe trial judge held Flowersâ€™ statements were insufficient to defeat Howeâ€™s summary judgment motion because Flowers never explicitly stated Doe most probably would have recovered more than the $88,000 he received in his settlement with Porter-Gaud.Â  Doe takes issue with this holding, asserting he had to show only that he â€œmost probably would have been successfulâ€ in the underlying action but for the alleged malpractice and therefore did not need expert testimony regarding the amount that he would have recovered.Â  We disagree with both arguments.\r\nFlowers based his statement that Doe most probably would have defeated Porter-Gaudâ€™s defenses on the experiences of other individuals who had asserted claims against Porter-Gaud.Â  As we pointed out earlier, the success of other plaintiffs, even those who might be similarly situated to Doe, is not an objective criterion on which to base an assertion that, had Doe filed a lawsuit on his underlying claim against Porter-Gaud, he would have defeated the statute of limitations defense and prevailed at trial.[20]\r\nWe further agree with the trial judgeâ€™s reliance on the fact that Flowers never stated â€œthat Doe â€˜most probablyâ€™ would have received more than the $88,000 he received in his settlement with Porter-Gaud.â€Â  It appears to us that the trial judge, in citing this factor, was not imposing an additional requirement for Doeâ€™s prima facie case, but rather, was considering an alternative course through which Doe could avoid summary judgment.[21]Â  As one commentator has aptly stated on this subject:\r\n\r\nThe clientâ€™s burden of establishing proximate cause in a legal malpractice action requires that he prove that he would have obtained a better result in the underlying matter if the attorney had exercised reasonable care.Â  The burden does not necessarily compel the client to demonstrate that he would have won the underlying case.Â  Rather, it is enough for the legal malpractice plaintiff to show that he has lost a valuable right; e.g., the settlement value of the underlying case.Â  Stated otherwise, â€œthe client need not show a perfect claim.Â  But the client must show at least that he has lost a probability of success as a result of the attorneyâ€™s negligence.â€[22]\r\n\r\nDoeâ€™s counsel herself commented during oral argument to this court that numerous factors, including the statute of limitations, are considered to determine the settlement value of a claim.Â  Notably absent from the record in this case, however, is any mention of settlement value from Flowers or any other expert that was brought to the trial judgeâ€™s attention.Â  \r\nAs far as we can tell, the record contains only a â€œGross Distributionâ€ list showing that various claimants represented by other counsel each received approximately $2 million dollars following the initial verdict against the school.[23]Â  But this list does nothing more than set forth factual information.Â  Most certainly, the list does not constitute an opinion that Doe should have made a recovery similar to the other claimants.Â  At best, it could serve, if at all, only as evidence that could have supported an opinion regarding the settlement value of Doeâ€™s claim.[24]\r\n4.Â  Finally, Doe argues his inability to maintain his cause of action for legal malpractice should not bar him from proceeding on his breach of fiduciary duty claim.Â  \r\nThe trial judge, as we interpret his order, dismissed both the legal malpractice claim and the breach of fiduciary duty claim because he viewed the record as presenting no triable issue of fact regarding whether Doe would have recovered more by either trial or settlement than $88,000 if he had retained a different lawyer or if Howe had represented him more â€œzealously.â€\r\nDoe followed up with a post-hearing Rule 59(e) motion in which he contended, among other things, he could pursue a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty without establishing that he would have succeeded on the underlying claim on which the legal malpractice action was based.Â  The trial judge denied Doeâ€™s motion in a summary order without further discussion of Doeâ€™s right to maintain an action for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  \r\nIn Bowen v. Lee Process Systems Co., this court stated the following regarding the trial courtâ€™s responsibility when issuing a summary judgment order:Â  \r\n\r\nOn appeal from the grant of summary judgment, an appellate court must determine whether the trial courtâ€™s stated grounds for its decision are supported by the record.Â  It is our duty to undertake a thorough and meaningful review of the trial courtâ€™s order and the entire record on appeal.Â  Where, as here, the trial court fails to articulate the reasons for its action on the record or enter a written order outlining its rationale, we simply cannot perform our designated function.[25]\r\n\r\nConsidering all the relevant circumstances, we do not fault the trial judge for his summary handling of Doeâ€™s post-hearing motion.Â  We are mindful of the demands on trial judges, especially when back-to-back scheduling of nonjury matters occurs.Â  We also recognize that, early on in the present case, the trial judge, in a conscientious effort to prevent a potential conflict of interest from tainting his decision, instructed his law clerk not to participate in the proceedings, thereby relinquishing assistance that would normally have been available to adjudicate a difficult and emotionally driven lawsuit.Â  Moreover, in all fairness to the trial judge, we acknowledge that, after our decision in Bowen, we stated in Clark v. South Carolina Department of Public Safety that â€œthere is no blanket requirement that the trial court set forth a separate explanation on all of its rulings on post-trial motions.â€[26]Â  \r\nThe order at issue in Clark, however, had been issued pursuant to post-trial motions following a hearing on the merits.Â  Of even greater significance is the fact that the reasoning behind the denial of the post-trial motions was discernible from the record on appeal.Â  In contrast, we are unable to glean any â€œstated groundsâ€ in this case from either the order denying reconsideration or the record on appeal as to why the trial judge rejected Doeâ€™s arguments concerning his breach of fiduciary duty claim.Â  At this point, we can only speculate about the reason the trial judge determined Doe could not proceed on this claim.Â  Despite a number of possible explanations[27] as to why the trial judge held as he did, we are reluctant to pass judgment on his ruling based on mere conjecture as to how he reached his decision.\r\nWe therefore vacate the dismissal of the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action and remand the matter to the trial judge for an order â€œidentifying the facts and accompanying legal analysis on which [he] reliedâ€[28] to enable a meaningful appellate review of this issue.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Bowen v.

Hiller, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This appeal stems from a probate court action in which Mary Schuyler Campbell (Daughter) sought to have herself appointed as conservator of Betsy M. Campbellâ€™s (Mother) assets.Â  After appointing two doctors to examine Motherâ€™s capacity to handle her own affairs, the probate court denied Daughterâ€™s request to be appointed conservator.Â  Daughter appealed to the circuit court, which set the order aside, finding the doctors who examined Mother were not disinterested.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 28, 2002, Daughter filed a petition seeking to be appointed conservator of Motherâ€™s assets.Â  According to Daughter, Motherâ€™s assets exceeded sixty million dollars, and Mother needed a conservator because she â€œis no longer mentally capable of caring for [herself] or [her] assets due to Alzheimer disease and/or dementia and [her] assets are being given away to others who are exerting undue influence over [her].â€Â  Mother filed an answer, denying her need for a conservator and arguing that in the event she needed a conservator, William W. Brown would have priority over her daughter because he is her attorney in fact.Â  \r\nAfter filing her petition, Daughter sent a discovery request to Mother, seeking copies of all of Motherâ€™s financial transactions from 1999 to 2002, all of Motherâ€™s income tax returns from 1999 to 2002, copies of any documents evidencing the transfer of property from Mother to William W. Brown, and all documents evidencing personal property owned by Mother.Â  In response to this request, Mother sent Daughter a copy of a deed, showing Mother had transferred a condominium to Brown for the sum of ten dollars.Â  Other than this deed, Mother refused to comply with Daughterâ€™s discovery requests, arguing they were not only overly broad, but also irrelevant because Daughter had not made a prima facie showing of Motherâ€™s incompetence.Â  \r\nBecause Mother had not fully complied with the discovery request, Daughter filed a motion seeking to compel production.Â  On July 9, 2002, the probate court had a hearing on the motion.Â  After denying Daughterâ€™s motion, the probate court directed Motherâ€™s counsel to prepare the order.Â  Counsel complied, and the court signed the order on August 12, 2002. That same day, the probate court also executed an order appointing Dr. Preston Edwards and Dr. John Cathcart as examiners for Mother.Â  Mother had previously designated these very doctors as her expert witnesses.Â  \r\nDaughter argued the doctors were appointed without her input, and she did not learn of their appointment until she received the order, which was sent to her by Motherâ€™s counsel rather than by the court.Â  By the time Daughter received the order, arrangements had already been made with the doctors to fly them via private jet to Motherâ€™s home in Florida.Â  Mother paid the doctors about $2,000 each for their time and also paid for the cost of their transportation.Â  Brown accompanied the doctors during their entire trip.\r\nUpon learning of the doctorsâ€™ appointment, Daughter filed a motion to reconsider both the probate courtâ€™s order denying her motion to compel discovery and its order appointing examiners.Â  The probate court held a hearing on the motions, and at the end of the hearing, Daughter moved that the probate judge recuse himself from the case.Â  Both the motion to reconsider and the motion to recuse were denied. \r\nAfter denying Daughterâ€™s motions, the probate court proceeded to hear the matter on its merits.Â  At the hearing, the doctors each testified that they spent an afternoon with Mother and found her to be completely competent to handle her own financial affairs.Â  In an affidavit he submitted to the court, Dr. Cathcart admitted to being a friend of Motherâ€™s for over sixty years, attending her husbandâ€™s most recent birthday party, and having supper with Mother four months prior to examining her.Â  According to Dr. Edwardsâ€™ affidavit, he had also eaten supper with Mother four months prior to examining her and before that, she had occasionally consulted him from 1950 to 1995 if she was having medical problems.Â  \r\nBased on the doctorsâ€™ affidavits and their testimony at the hearing, the probate court found Mother to be mentally competent and therefore capable of handling her own finances.Â  Accordingly, the probate court found there was no need to appoint a conservator for Motherâ€™s assets.Â  \r\nDaughter appealed to the circuit court, arguing among other things, that: (1) the order appointing examiners resulted from improper ex parte communications, (2) the probate court erred in appointing the doctors who were not disinterested parties, (3) the probate court judge erred in not recusing himself, and (4) the probate court erred in finding Mother was mentally competent.Â  The circuit court set aside the probate courtâ€™s order, finding the probate court abused its discretion in naming Drs. Cathcart and Edwards as examiners when Mother had previously designated them as expert witnesses on her behalf.Â  The circuit court also found the probate judgeâ€™s order and the personal comments he directed at Daughterâ€™s counsel demonstrated an improper prejudice against Daughterâ€™s case, and therefore, the circuit court recused the probate judge from the case. Because the probate judge who had heard the case was the only probate judge in Cherokee County, the circuit court ordered the case be transferred to Spartanburg County Probate Court.Â  Mother appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother argues the circuit court erred in finding the probate courtâ€™s appointment of Drs. Cathcart and Edwards was an abuse of discretion.[1]Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to section 62-5-401 of the South Carolina Code (1987), the probate court may appoint a conservator to the estate and affairs of a person if the court determines: (1) the person is unable to manage his or her affairs due to advanced age or mental deficiency, and (2) the person has property that will be wasted unless proper management is provided.Â  To aid the court in determining whether a person lacks the mental capacity to handle his or her own affairs, section 62-5-407(b) requires the person â€œbe examined by one or more physicians designated by the court, preferably physicians who are not connected with any institution in which the person is a patient or is detained.â€\r\nMother argues the physicians appointed by the probate court were sufficient despite the fact she had previously designated them as her experts because the probate code does not restrict examiners to â€œdisinterestedâ€ physicians.Â  Mother points out that the statute merely states a preference for examiners who are not connected with an institution in which the person is a patient or is detained, neither of which are present in this case as Mother is not a patient in any institution.\r\nWhile the statute does not specifically address whether a physician must be â€œdisinterestedâ€ or not, the obvious purpose of appointing examiners is to provide the probate court with a medical opinion regarding the personâ€™s mental capacity, and it is inherent that such an opinion come from a neutral physician.Â  The statuteâ€™s preference that the physician be independent from institutions in which the person is a patient evidences the Legislatureâ€™s desire for neutralilty.Â  Furthermore, in other court proceedings in which the trial court receives information from an intermediary, independence is required.Â  See, e.g., Doe v. Ward Law Firm, 353 S.C. 509, 519, 579 S.E.2d 303, 308 (2003) (holding that it was in an adopted childâ€™s best interests to appoint an intermediary to review law firmâ€™s adoption file for information relating to childâ€™s physical and psychological problems, and requiring intermediary to be independent of any party to the suit); Wrenn v. Wrenn, 228 SC. 588, 591, 91 S.E.2d 267, 268 (1956) (modifying trial courtâ€™s order dissolving partnership and remanding case for a â€œcompetent, disinterested and impartial personâ€ to be appointed as receiver). \r\nHere, Mother had previously designated Drs. Cathcart and Edwards as experts.Â  Thus, it was a foregone conclusion those doctors would opine Mother was capable of handling her own financial affairs.Â  By appointing such doctors to aid the court in determining Motherâ€™s mental capacity, the probate court merely went through the motions of following section 62-5-407.Â  Such a charade was not what the General Assembly intended in enacting the probate code.Â  We therefore find the probate court erred by appointing Drs. Cathcart and Edwards as examiners.Â  Because this error impacted the probate courtâ€™s subsequent order finding Mother was not in need of a conservator, the circuit court was correct to set that order aside as well.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Mother also argues the circuit court erred in recusing the probate judge from further participation in this matter.Â  However, Mother concedes this issue has been rendered moot because the probate judge passed away during the pendency of this appeal.Â  Therefore, we need not address the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4063","title":"Doe v.

White, of Greenville and Michael H. Montgomery, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This is an appeal from the granting of a directed verdict in a negligent retention action.Â  The dispositive issue, as narrowly framed in the trial court, is whether a jury question existed as a result of the employerâ€™s decision not to fire an employee based on the report of a single incident of an inappropriate sexual advance toward a fellow employee.Â  We agree with the trial court that a jury question was not created by the employerâ€™s decision to retain the employee.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS[1]\r\nAppellant Sharon Doe[2] is the mother of Audra Doe, a disabled adult female.Â  Audra rode a Medicaid bus to physical therapy sessions and to Greenville Memorial Hospital, where she did volunteer work.Â  Calvin Murray, an employee of Respondents (collectively â€œATCâ€) drove the Medicaid bus on which Audra sometimes rode.Â  While Audra was on the bus, Murray repeatedly touched her legs inappropriately, kissed her and made persistent comments to her of a sexual nature over a period of several months.Â  \r\nDoe filed separate lawsuits on behalf of Audra against Murray and ATC.Â  These suits were consolidated and tried together.Â  Doeâ€™s claim against ATC was based on a negligent retention theory.[3]Â  \r\nThe trial court directed a verdict in favor of ATC.Â  The action against Murray resulted in a jury verdict of $1,000.Â  Doe appeals only from the direction of a verdict in favor of ATC, and there is no challenge in connection with the action against Murray.Â  Concerning the negligent retention theory of liability against ATC, Doe contended that Murray should have previously been fired due to an earlier, isolated incident involving a fellow employee, Tycie Moss.Â Â Â  \r\nMoss testified that several months before the incidents involving Audra, Murray made an inappropriate advance toward her.Â  Mossâ€™s car had broken down, so Murray picked her up before her shift, around 3 or 4 oâ€™clock in the morning.Â  Moss got out of Murrayâ€™s van and, as she was getting into her van, Murray approached her, and â€œthen grabbed [her] arms â€¦ like he was forcing [her] to kiss him.â€Â  Moss pushed him away before he could kiss her, got into her van, and left.Â  Moss also testified that Murray made inappropriate sexual comments to her in the presence of clients on the van.Â  \r\nMoss reported the incident to her supervisor, Hattie Wright.Â  Moss, however, told Wright not to write up a formal complaint against Murray because she â€œdidnâ€™t want it to blow up.â€Â  ATC had a formal complaint procedure that provided for an investigation of a complaint, but Moss refused to file a complaint.Â  In fact, Moss did not want Wright â€œto do anything about [the incident].â€Â  Wright said that Moss wanted her disclosure to remain in confidence, noting that Moss did not want Wright to â€œsay anything to anyone.â€Â Â Â  \r\nWright ignored Mossâ€™s wishes and pursued the matter the same day, initially by speaking with Murray.Â  Murray gave â€œhis sideâ€ and said the incident was not as â€œinterpreted.â€ Without an admission from Murray and the lack of a formal complaint, Wright nevertheless issued Murray a verbal warning, instructing him to â€œkeep [his] distanceâ€ and to â€œdo [his] job.â€Â  Also on the same day, Wright discussed the incident with her supervisor, Audlyn Williams, who was the manager in charge of the Greenville office. Â Williams believed that in light of Murrayâ€™s otherwise laudable employment recordâ€”he â€œnever had a [problem] beforeâ€â€”Wrightâ€™s actions were appropriate.Â  Wright subsequently prepared a memorandum for the file regarding the incident.Â Â Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that ATCâ€”prior to Doeâ€™s complaint on behalf of Audraâ€”had no other knowledge of inappropriate conduct of any kind by Murray. \r\nAfter Doe filed her complaint, Williams and Wright notified Melville Padgett, the general manager for ATCâ€™s Medicaid properties in South Carolina.Â  Padgett testified he was satisfied with Wrightâ€™s earlier actions because prior to the present action Murray had a â€œclean recordâ€ except for the single incident reported by Moss.Â  Following Doeâ€™s complaint, Murray admitted making an inappropriate comment to Audra on the bus, and Padgett fired him.Â  \r\n The Directed Verdict Motion\r\nATC moved for a directed verdict, and the trial court engaged in a lengthy discussion with Doeâ€™s counsel in an effort to determine the precise allegation of negligence against ATC.Â  Specifically, it was not clear what Doe claimed ATC should have done differently following the reported incident involving Moss.Â  The answer eventually surfaced:\r\n\r\nThe Court:Â  So they would have to have fired him [following the report by Moss]?\r\n[Doeâ€™s counsel]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe trial court, as noted, directed a verdict in favor of ATC.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the appellate court applies the same standard as the circuit court.Â  Welch v. Epstein,&nbsp;342 S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  The court must view the evidence and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995); Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 366, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nDoe argues that ATC negligently retained Murray by failing to fire him following the report by Moss.Â  The issue before us, as framed in the trial court and stipulated at oral argument, is a narrow oneâ€”was a jury question presented on Doeâ€™s theory of liability that ATC was negligent in not firing Murray following the attempted kissing incident involving a fellow employee?Â  We join the circuit court in answering the question â€œno.â€ \r\nWe have canvassed the record and conclude that ATCâ€™s decision not to fire Murray following the incident with Moss was reasonable as a matter of law.Â  Doe makes no claim that ATCâ€™s supervision of Murray was negligent following the incident with Moss.Â  Cf. Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 116-17, 420 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1992) (recognizing the tort of negligent supervision in South Carolina law); Moore by Moore v. Berkeley County School Dist.,&nbsp;326 S.C. 584, 590, 486 S.E.2d 9, 12-13&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (examining negligent supervision case law since Degenhart).[4]Â  We can find no South Carolina case on point, and none has been cited.Â  South Carolina, indeed, recognizes the tort of negligent retention in the context of a negligent supervision action.Â  We have no pause in concluding our supreme court would recognize the tort of negligent retention, independent of allegations of negligent supervision.Â  See e.g., Yunker v. Honeywell, Inc., 496 N.W.2d 419, 422 (Minn. Ct. App. 1993) (holding that negligent hiring and negligent retention are distinct theories of recovery separate from negligent supervision).Â  In addressing the law of negligent supervision, our supreme court has cited with approval the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 317 (1965).Â  Degenhart, 309 S.C. at 116-17, 420 S.E.2d at 496.Â  Comment c to section 317 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts deals specifically with the retention of employees, and provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nc. Retention in employment of servants known to misconduct themselves. There may be circumstances in which the only effective control which the master can exercise over the conduct of his servant is to discharge the servant. Therefore the master may subject himself to liability under the rule stated in this Section by retaining in his employment servants who, to his knowledge, are in the habit of misconducting themselves in a manner dangerous to others.Â  \r\n\r\nOur review of negligent hiring and retention cases from other jurisdictions leads us to conclude that such cases generally turn on two fundamental elementsâ€”knowledge of the employer and foreseeability of harm to third parties. Di Cosala v. Kay,&nbsp;450 A.2d 508, 516&nbsp;(N.J. 1982).Â  These elements, from a factual perspective, are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as a fact bearing on one element may also impact resolution of the other element.Â  From a practical standpoint, these elements are analyzed in terms of the number and nature of prior acts of wrongdoing by the employee, and the nexus or similarity between the prior acts and the ultimate harm caused.Â  Such factual considerationsâ€”especially questions related to proximate cause inherent in the concept of foreseeabilityâ€”will ordinarily be determined by the factfinder, and not as a matter of law.Â  Hoke v. May Depâ€™t Stores Co.,&nbsp;891 P.2d 686, 691&nbsp;(Or. Ct. App. 1995); Gaines v. Monsanto Co.,&nbsp;655 S.W.2d 568, 571&nbsp;(Mo. Ct. App. 1983).Â  Nevertheless, the court should dispose of the matter on a dispositive motion when no reasonable factfinder could find the risk foreseeable or the employerâ€™s conduct to have fallen below the acceptable standard.Â  Hoke, 891 P.2d at 690; Reed v. Kelly,&nbsp;37 S.W.3d 274, 278&nbsp;(Mo. Ct. App. 2000).Â  We believe Doeâ€™s claim against ATC is properly resolved as a matter of law.Â  \r\nThe standard, according to the Restatement section 317 comment c, is whether the employer knew the offending employee was â€œin the habit of misconducting [himself] in a manner dangerous to others.â€Â  Accordingly, many courts have recognized that a plaintiff must demonstrate some propensity, proclivity, or course of conduct sufficient to put the employer on notice of the possible danger to third parties.Â  See e.g., Frye v. Am. Painting Co., 642 N.E.2d 995, 999 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994) (holding that an employer may be held negligent if it retains an employee it knew or should have known had a propensity for dangerous behavior); Alpharetta First United Methodist Church v. Stewart, 472 S.E.2d 532, 536 (Ga. Ct. App. 1996) (holding that an employer may not be held liable for negligent hiring or retention unless the plaintiff shows the employer knew or should have known of the employeeâ€™s dangerous propensities); Gomez v. City of New York, 758 N.Y.S.2d 298, 299&nbsp;(N.Y. App. Div. 2003) (â€œ[R]ecovery on a negligent hiring and retention theory requires a showing that the employer was on notice of the relevant tortious propensities of the wrongdoing employee.â€).Â  \r\nBased on this requirement, some courts have dismissed negligent hiring and negligent retention claims when the claim rests on a single prior incident of misconduct.Â  For example, in Sullivan v. St. Louis Station Assocs., 770 S.W.2d 352 (Mo. Ct. App. 1989), the court held that a single prior incident was insufficient as a matter of law to establish negligent retention.Â  The Sullivan court noted that â€œthe plaintiff must demonstrate that the employee had dangerous proclivities . . . which denotes a course of conduct rather than a single aberration of behavior.â€Â  Id. at 357.Â  Similarly, in Moore v. Hosier,&nbsp;43 F. Supp. 2d 978, 993-994&nbsp;(N.D. Ind. 1998), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana granted summary judgment to an employer in a negligent hiring and retention claim that was predicated on a single, prior incident.Â  The court observed that a single incident does not equate to a habit or propensity toward misconduct.Â  Id. at 993.Â  \r\nHowever, we do not view the â€œhabit of misconductingâ€ language in the Restatement as mandating multiple prior acts of misconduct for a negligent retention action to remain viable in South Carolina.Â  We hold that a single isolated incident of prior misconduct (of which the employer knew or should have known) may support a negligent retention claim, provided the prior misconduct has a sufficient nexus to the ultimate harm.Â  In Doe v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 323 S.C. 33, 40-41, 448 S.E.2d 564, 568 (Ct. App. 1994), in the context of a negligent supervision claim, this court affirmed the denial of the employerâ€™s directed verdict motionâ€”and hence a jury question was presentedâ€”where the prior isolated incident involved the same sexual misconduct against the same victim.\r\nTurning to the case at hand, the prior alleged misconduct by Murray against Moss, a co-employee, lacks a sufficient nexus to the sexual assault on Audra.Â  While it is true that both incidents may generally be described as sexual in nature, the totality of the prior incident is a far cry from the reprehensible, persistent pattern of abuse against Audra.Â  If Mossâ€™s allegation against Murray were founded,[5] then Murrayâ€™s conduct involving Moss certainly deserved some form of disciplinary action.Â  ATC could have taken any number of actions, such as transferring Murray or requiring counseling.Â  However, none of these possibilities are in play here, because we are not confronted with any claim of negligent supervision, but only the claim that ATC should have fired Murray.Â  \r\nDoeâ€™s laser-beam approachâ€”Murray had to be firedâ€”is simply not reasonable under the facts presented, including the nature of the incident involving Moss, Mossâ€™s unwillingness to file a formal complaint, and the complete absence of evidence of other such similar conduct by Murray.Â  Indeed, but for the allegation by Moss, Murray had a â€œcleanâ€ work record. Imposition of liability against an employer for negligent retention under these facts is legally untenable.Â  This court in no manner condones Murrayâ€™s purported misconduct against Moss, and we recognize that a single assault may well create a jury question as to whether an employee should be fired.Â  But this is not such a case. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that the directed verdict for ATC was appropriate under the facts presented and the theory of liability advanced by Doe.Â  A reasonable jury could not conclude, based on the incident involving Moss, that ATC knew or should have known that Murray was likely to commit a sexual assault sometime in the future.Â  The decision to retain Murray following the informal report by Moss was reasonable as a matter of law.Â  The order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We adhere to the appropriate standard of review and thus view the facts in a light most favorable to Appellant, although the facts necessary for resolution of this appeal are largely undisputed.\r\n[2] We have substituted the name Doe due to the nature of the allegations.\r\n[3] The complaint alleged negligent supervision, but the case was tried as one of negligent retention. \r\n[4] In Appellantsâ€™ Final Brief, Doe seeks to recast the case as one of negligent supervision, arguing that ATC was â€œon noticeâ€ about the incident with Moss and hence the need to â€œexercise controlâ€ over Murray.Â  Issue preservation rules preclude us from expanding the case and issues beyond those argued in the trial court.Â  Counsel for Doe conceded at oral argument that the case against ATC rested solely on the claim that ATC was required to fire Murray following the incident with Moss. When properly viewed, Doe has defined and equated ATCâ€™s duty to â€œexercise controlâ€ with a duty to fire Murray. \r\n[5] We decline Doeâ€™s invitation to view Mossâ€™s allegation in hindsight through the lens of Murrayâ€™s abuse of Audra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4064","title":"Peek v.

Boulier, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nJames C. Cothran, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  This is an appeal from an order of the trial court enjoining Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System (the Hospital) from terminating the staff privileges of anesthesiologist Sharon Peek until the merits of her case can be adjudicated.Â Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nPeek is a licensed anesthesiologist.[1]Â  She has maintained staff privileges at the Hospital for almost fourteen years.Â  On January 30, 2004, general counsel for the Hospital informed Peek that pursuant to a prospective agreement between the Hospital and Foothills Anesthesia Consultants, P.C. (Foothills), Peek would lose her staff privileges at the Hospital unless she was employed by Foothills.Â  Although Peek did not wish to work at Foothills, she nevertheless sought employment there.Â  Foothills declined to employ her.Â  \r\nOn February 1, 2004, the Hospital entered into an â€œAnesthesiology Services Agreementâ€ with Foothills (2004 Agreement), which provided that Foothills â€œshall be the exclusive provider of Servicesâ€ at the Hospital.Â  This meant that core anesthesia servicesâ€”essentially, all anesthesia services outside of chronic pain managementâ€”could be performed only by employees of Foothills.Â  Accordingly, under the 2004 Agreement, if Foothills did not employ Peek, she could not practice core anesthesia services at the Hospital.Â  \r\nOn February 24, 2004, Peek was asked about her employment status with Foothills.Â  Because Foothills did not employ Peek, the Hospital acted under the 2004 Agreement and terminated her core anesthesia privileges.Â  On March 1, 2004, the President of the Hospital told Peek that effective March 6, 2004, she would no longer be allowed to perform any core anesthesia services at the Hospital.Â  On March 5, 2004, a day before Peekâ€™s privileges terminated, Peek sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the Hospital from revoking her core anesthesia privileges.Â  Peek also brought a breach of contract action against the Hospital for failing to follow its own bylaws when it terminated Peekâ€™s privileges.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted the temporary restraining order finding Peek made a prima facie showing she was entitled to protection under the Hospital bylaws.Â  The Hospital appeals from this temporary injunction.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe grant or denial of an injunction by the trial court will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Gilley v. Gilley, 327 S.C. 8, 11-12, 488 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1997); MailSource, L.L.C. v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs., 356 S.C. 363, 367, 588 S.E.2d 635, 637-38 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision of the trial court is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Ledford v. Pa. Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 675, 230 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976); County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting Peek injunctive relief until the merits of her case can be heard.Â  We find no abuse of discretion. \r\nâ€œAn injunction is a drastic remedy issued by the court in its discretion to prevent irreparable harm suffered by the plaintiff.â€Â  Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes W. Residential Golf Props., Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 121, 603 S.E.2d 905, 907 (2004).Â  To obtain an injunction, the plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for injunction and demonstrate the injunction is reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights pending in the litigation.Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  To establish a cause of action for injunction, the plaintiff must show â€œ(1) it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; (2) it will likely succeed on the merits of the litigation; and (3) there is an inadequate remedy at law.â€Â  Scratch Golf, 361 S.C. at 121, 603 S.E.2d at 908.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Irreparable Harm\r\nThe Hospital argues Peek has not suffered irreparable harm entitling her to injunctive relief because the harm she alleges can be remedied by monetary damages alone.Â  We disagree. \r\nWhether â€œa wrong is irreparable, in the sense that equity may intervene, and whether there is an adequate remedy at law, are questions that are not decided by narrow and artificial rules.â€Â  Kirk v. Clark, 191 S.C. 205, 211, 4 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1939).Â  Before granting an injunction, the trial court should balance the equities: the court should look at the particular facts of each case and the equities of each party and determine which side, if any, is more entitled to equitable relief.Â  MailSource, L.L.C. v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs., 356 S.C. 363, 368, 588 S.E.2d 635, 638 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The only purpose of an injunction is to preserve the status quo to avoid possible irreparable injury to a party pending litigation.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 601, 553 S.E.2d 110, 121 (2001); MailSource, 356 S.C. at 368, 588 S.E.2d at 638.Â  \r\nThe trial court found that because Peek was a physician with a private practice, she would suffer irreparable harm while her case against the Hospital was litigated, and that as between Peek and the Hospital, the equities favored Peek.Â  The record supports this conclusion.Â  Peek has lived and practiced anesthesiology in the Spartanburg area for fourteen years.Â  During this time Peek built a patient referral base, which fueled her professional practice.Â  The loss of privileges at the Hospital would lead to the loss of her patient referral base, which would, in turn, lead to the loss of her professional practice.Â  The complete loss of a professional practice can be an irreparable harm.[2]Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found Peek would suffer irreparable harm if the status quo was not maintained.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Success on the Merits\r\nThe Hospital next argues Peek cannot succeed on the merits of the underlying case because the 2004 Agreement is an enforceable exclusive contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen seeking a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff need not prove an absolute legal right; the plaintiff need only present â€œa fair question to raise as to the existence of such a right.â€Â  Williams v. Jones, 92 S.C. 342, 347, 75 S.E.2d 705, 710 (1912).Â  The determination of whether to grant an injunction should not be based on the merits of the underlying case except insofar as the merits may assist the trial court in determining whether a prima facie showing has been made.Â  MailSource, 356 S.C. at 368, 588 S.E.2d at 638 (citing Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 481, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969)).Â  â€œOnce a prima facie showing has been made entitling the plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.â€Â  Helsel v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992) (â€œ[I]t would have been improper for the hearing judge who issued the temporary injunction to make a finding upon the facts in such a manner as to affect the merits of the case.â€).Â  \r\nOnce the trial court determined Peek made a prima facie showing she was entitled to protection under the Hospital bylaws, the trial court was not required to determine whether the 2004 Agreement was an enforceable exclusive contract because such a finding would affect the merits of the case.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding Peek would likely succeed on the merits. \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Inadequate Remedy at Law\r\nFinally, the Hospital argues Peek had an adequate remedy at law in the form of monetary damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nAgain, the purpose of an injunction is the preservation of the status quo.Â  MailSource, 356 S.C. at 368, 588 S.E.2d at 638.Â  â€œA temporary injunction is used to preserve the subject of controversy in the condition which it is at the time of the [o]rder until opportunity is offered for full and deliberate investigation and to preserve the existing status during litigation.â€Â  Id.Â  As explained above, the trial court correctly found that if Peek lost her privileges at the Hospital, her professional practice and, by extension, her career would be lost long before her claims against the Hospital were adjudicated.Â  Furthermore, Peek, who both sides agree is a competent and capable anesthesiologist, would lose expertise if she were not otherwise allowed to exercise her privileges at the hospital while this case is pending, and therefore her future ability to practice anesthesiology would be compromised.Â  While courts do often award monetary damages when a plaintiff can no longer work, such damages are usually the only possible remedy and serve to make the plaintiff as whole as possible under the circumstances.Â  Here, monetary damages are not the only option, and injunctive relief is a better remedy because it would allow Peek to retain both her patient base and her expertise while also retaining her income.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Peek had an inadequate remedy at law.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the order of the trial court enjoining the Hospital from revoking Peekâ€™s privileges until the merits of her case can be heard is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and WILLIAMS, J.J. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Peekâ€™s competency as a physician is not, and has never been, an issue in this case.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Other appellate courts have upheld injunctive relief to prevent the loss of a business or business goodwill.Â  District of Columbia v. E. Trans-Waste of Md., Inc., 758 A.2d 1, 15 (D.C. 2000) (â€œWhile economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm, such harm will be found if economic loss threatens the very existence of [plaintiffâ€™s] business.â€); Campbell Inns, Inc. v. Banholzer, Turnure &amp; Co., 527 A.2d 1142, 1146 (Vt. 1987) (â€œThe potential loss of a business satisfies the irreparable harm requirement for the issuance of an injunction.â€); IAC, Ltd. v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 160 S.W.3d 191, 200 (Tex. App. 2005) (â€œLoss of business goodwill or loss that is not easily calculated in pecuniary terms is sufficient to show irreparable injury for purposes of obtaining a temporary injunction.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4065","title":"Levine v.

(the Hospital) and Foothills Anesthesia Consultants, P.C. (Foothills) from terminating the privileges of anesthesiologist Beth Ellen Levine until the merits of her case can be adjudicated.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nBeth Ellen Levine is a licensed physician and board-certified anesthesiologist.Â  Her competency as a physician is not, and has never been, an issue in this case.Â  \r\nOn May 1, 2000, the Hospital and Foothills entered into a three-year â€œAnesthesiology Agreementâ€ (2000 Agreement).Â  Under the 2000 Agreement, Foothills agreed to provide the Hospital with anesthesia services performed by licensed and qualified anesthesiologists.Â  Four months later, Foothills and Levine entered into a â€œMedical Service Agreementâ€ (Service Agreement).Â  Under the Service Agreement, Levine agreed to perform anesthesia services for Foothills at the Hospital.Â  The Service Agreement included a three-year term limit as well as an automatic renewal provision.Â  \r\nThe renewal provision stated:\r\n\r\nAt the end of the initial term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for a period of three (3) years unless any party gives written notice to the other party at least ninety (90) days before the end of the renewal term of its intent not to renew the Agreement.Â  [Foothills] agrees that it shall give [Levine] a notice of non-renewal only if the grounds for its decision not to renew this or subsequent Agreements would be grounds for terminating this or subsequent Agreements.Â  If such notice of non-renewal is given and [Levine] elects to exercise the rights available under Section 7(h) of the Agreement prior to the expiration of this or subsequent agreements, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect at least until the respective rights and obligations of the parties concerning the renewal of the Agreement are determined by final order of the arbitrator.Â  \r\n\r\nThe 2000 Agreement, by its own terms, ended in May 2003, but the Hospital and Foothills extended it through June.Â  On July 21, 2003, the President of Foothills told Levine the 2000 Agreement had expired.Â  Despite the end of the arrangement between the Hospital and Foothills, Levine continued to perform anesthesia services at the Hospital.Â  \r\nOn November 19, 2003, the Hospital Board of Directors (the Board) amended the bylaws to enable the Hospital to enter into an exclusive contract for core anesthesia services.Â  The Board also amended a provision of the bylaws related to the termination of privileges at the Hospital.Â  The amended provision of the bylaws stated:\r\n\r\nWhere a physician previously has been granted . . . privileges in a Restricted Member Service,[1] and was not, or is no longer, a Contract Physician,[2] the President shall so notify the Board.Â  The Board shall propose the termination of the affected physicianâ€™s privileges . . . .Â  The affected physician shall have the procedural rights set forth in the Medical Staff Bylaws related to revocation of privileges . . . but the only issues for determination in any such proceedings shall be:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the privileges in question are, in fact, privileges reserved for Restricted Member Services; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the applicant presently is, in fact, a Contract Physician . . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n(footnotes added).Â  On January 30, 2004, the Hospital and Foothills entered into another three-year agreement (2004 Agreement).Â  \r\nA month later, on February 24, 2004, general counsel for the Hospital notified Levine that if Foothills did not employ her she would lose her privileges at the Hospital.Â  On March 1, 2004, the President of the Hospital informed Levine of the Boardâ€™s decision to terminate her privileges.Â  He informed Levine that she was entitled to procedural rights under the bylaws, â€œbut the only issues for determination in such proceedingsâ€ would be whether Levine was employed by Foothills.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn March 3, 2004, Levine filed the present action against the Hospital and Foothills for breach of contract, interference with a contractual relationship, violation of due process, and civil conspiracy.Â  Levine also sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the Hospital from terminating her privileges.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted a temporary injunction against the Hospital and Foothills.Â  Both entities appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe grant or denial of an injunction by the trial court will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Gilley v.

Clark, 191 S.C. 205, 211, 4 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1939).Â  \r\nThe trial court found that Levine, as a physician with a private practice, would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction was not granted.Â  The record supports this conclusion.Â  Levine has built a patient referral base through her work at the Hospital.Â  This referral base would erode and potentially disappear if Levine lost her privileges at the Hospital while the merits of her underlying action against the Hospital and Foothills are adjudicated.Â  Levine would also lose competency in anesthesiology if she were unable to ply her trade as the lawsuit progressed.Â  Such inactivity could lead to the loss of her professional practice and career, which can be an irreparable harm.[3]Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding Levine would suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Success on the Merits\r\nThe Hospital and Foothills next argue Levine cannot succeed on the merits because the 2004 Agreement is an enforceable exclusive contract and the Service Agreement ended, without renewal, when the 2000 Agreement expired.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Validity of the 2004 Agreement \r\nWhen seeking a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff need not prove an absolute legal right; the plaintiff need only present â€œa fair question to raise as to the existence of such a right.â€Â  Williams v. Jones, 92 S.C. 342, 347, 75 S.E.2d 705, 710 (1912).Â  The determination of whether an injunction is granted should not be based on the merits of the underlying case except insofar as the merits may assist the trial court in determining whether a prima facie showing has been made.Â  MailSource, 356 S.C. at 368, 588 S.E.2d at 638 (citing Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 481, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969)).Â  â€œOnce a prima facie showing has been made entitling the plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.â€Â  Helsel v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992).Â  \r\nThe trial court concluded Levine made a prima facie showing she was entitled to protection under the Hospital bylaws.Â  Once this conclusion was made, the court was not required to determine whether the 2004 Agreement was valid.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding Levine would likely succeed on the merits of the underlying action.Â Â Â Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Automatic Renewal Provision of the Service Agreement \r\nThe trial court also concluded Levine made a prima facie showing she was entitled to protection under the Service Agreement.Â  The record supports this conclusion as well.Â  Under the Service Agreement, Foothills was required to give Levine notice of its intent not to renew the Service Agreement ninety days before the termination of the Service Agreement.Â  The July 21, 2003 letter from the President of Foothills to Levine does not appear to satisfy this requirement because it was sent within ninety days of the termination of the Service Agreement.Â  Thus, the Service Agreement may have automatically renewed until September 1, 2006.Â  Thus, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining Levine made a prima facie showing of success on the merits under the Service Agreement. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Inadequate Remedy at Law\r\nFinally, the Hospital and Foothills argue Levine has an adequate remedy at law because she can recover money damages for her injuries.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe purpose of an injunction is the preservation of the status quo.Â  MailSource, 356 S.C. at 368, 588 S.E.2d 638.Â  â€œA temporary injunction is used to preserve the subject of controversy in the condition which it is at the time of the [o]rder until opportunity is offered for full and deliberate investigation and to preserve the existing status during litigation.â€Â  Id.Â  As explained above, the trial court decided monetary damages alone would not remedy the harm Levine would sustain if her privileges at the Hospital were terminated.Â  If Levine lost her privileges, her professional practice and, by extension, her career may very well be lost long before her claims against the Hospital and Foothills were finally adjudicated.Â  This point is perhaps best buttressed by a provision of the 2004 Agreement between the Hospital and Foothills that states when privileges are terminated damages will â€œbe difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that [the Hospital] and Foothills shall have the right to an injunction or other equitable relief . . . .â€Â  Thus, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded the loss of a professional practice and a career could not be adequately remedied through money damages alone.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, J.J. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  â€œRestricted Member Serviceâ€ includes anesthesiology.Â  \r\n[2]Â  A â€œContract Physicianâ€ is a â€œphysician who is employed by a physician group who is party to an exclusive contract.â€Â  \r\n[3]Â  Other appellate courts have upheld injunctive relief to prevent the loss of a business or business goodwill.Â  District of Columbia v. E. Trans-Waste of Md., Inc., 758 A.2d 1, 15 (D.C. 2000) (â€œWhile economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm, such harm will be found if economic loss threatens the very existence of [plaintiffâ€™s] business.â€); Campbell Inns, Inc. v. Banholzer, Turnure &amp; Co., 527 A.2d 1142, 1146 (Vt. 1987) (â€œThe potential loss of a business satisfies the irreparable harm requirement for the issuance of an injunction.â€); IAC, Ltd. v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 160 S.W.3d 191, 200 (Tex. App. 2005) (â€œLoss of business goodwill or loss that is not easily calculated in pecuniary terms is sufficient to show irreparable injury for purposes of obtaining a temporary injunction.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
