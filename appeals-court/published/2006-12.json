Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4183\r\nHeard November 6, 2006 â€“ Filed December 11, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Appellant.Â  \r\nJohn S. Nichols, of Columbia, Â for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The State appeals the grant of Craig Davisâ€™ motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant procured with false information.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 31, 2004, the Conway Police Department received reports of multiple shots fired in a residential area.Â  Off-duty City Police Officer Rodrick Mishoe lived in the area, and one of the shots entered his residence.Â  Officer Mishoe looked out his window and saw a black male running up the street firing a gun, and another black male, wearing a ski mask, standing at the edge of his yard.Â  When police arrived on the scene, Officer Mishoe said from the â€œlips,â€ â€œeyes,â€ â€œfacial features,â€ and body structure he believed the person in the ski mask was a man who lived behind him.Â  The man went by the nickname â€œChubby.â€Â  Tyrone Williams, one of the responding officers, knew that Craig Duval Davis went by the nickname â€œChubby.â€ Â Officer Williams shared this information with Detective Sergeant Tammy Staples, who then obtained a photograph of Craig Davis from the J.&nbsp;Rubin Long Detention Center.Â  Staples showed the photograph to Mishoe, who confirmed that the subject was the person he knew as â€œChubby.â€Â  \r\nPolice officers proceeded to Davisâ€™ residence without an arrest warrant or search warrant.Â  Upon arriving, officers observed Davis and another individual exit a shed located at the back of the property.Â  The men complied with the officersâ€™ requests to get down on the ground.Â  As they did so, a handgun protruding from the back of Davisâ€™ waistband became clearly visible.Â  A search of the two subjects revealed an additional gun on Davis and two weapons on the other individual.Â  Staples sought a search warrant for the shed and submitted an affidavit in support of her request indicating that â€œOfficer Rodrick [sic] positively identified one of the subjects firing shots in his yard as Graig [sic] Davis . . . .â€Â  The search warrant was issued, and a search of the shed revealed another gun, a silencer, cocaine, marijuana, and crack cocaine.Â  Davis was indicted on drugs and weapons charges.Â  At trial, Davis moved to suppress the drug evidence arguing that the search of the shed was based on a falsified affidavit because Mishoe never â€œpositively identifiedâ€ Craig Davis as a suspect.Â  The trial court granted his motion. Â The State appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a suppression hearing, the appellate court will give deference to the circuit courtâ€™s findings and only reverse if there is clear error. Â State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000).Â  The appellate court may conduct its own review of the record to ascertain if there is any evidence to support the ruling.Â  State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 70, 572 S.E.2d 456, 460-61 (2002).\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State contends the courtâ€™s suppression of the evidence because it was discovered through a search warrant predicated on false information was error.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn determining whether alleged misstatements in an affidavit render a search warrant invalid, the court must conduct the analysis set forth in Franks&nbsp;v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).\r\n\r\nFranks outlined a two-part test for challenging the warrant affidavitâ€™s veracity.Â  First, to mandate an evidentiary hearing, there must be â€˜allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth . . . and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof.â€™ . . . Second, . . . the court must consider the affidavitâ€™s remaining content, with the affidavitâ€™s false material set to one side, to determine if it is sufficient to establish probable cause.\r\n\r\nState v. Davis, 354 S.C. 348, 359-60, 580 S.E.2d 778, 784 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing State v. Missouri, 337 S.C. 548, 524 S.E.2d 394 (1999)) (internal citations omitted).Â  â€œThere will be no Franks violation if the affidavit . . . still contains sufficient information to establish probable cause.â€Â  Missouri, at 554, 524 S.E.2d at 397. Â \r\nIn this case, evidence was presented in camera regarding Mishoeâ€™s alleged positive identification of Davis as one of the men involved in the shootout near his property.Â  Officer Mishoe testified that he was â€œnot positively sureâ€ the suspect was Chubby and that his looking at the photograph of Davis was not a positive identification of Davis as the man in the ski mask.Â  After hearing the testimony, the court concluded that Mishoe had not â€œpositively identifiedâ€ Davis.Â  The statement was therefore false and had been used in the affidavit with reckless disregard for the truth.Â  Because there is evidence in the record to support this finding, we do not disturb it on appeal.Â  \r\nAlthough the second part of the Franks analysis is not expressly discussed in the record, the trial court indicated that its decision to suppress the evidence was â€œconsistent with Frank [sic] versus Delaware.â€Â  The parties agree the trial court conducted the second part of the Franks analysis as such an examination would be implicit in a ruling under Franks.Â  Therefore, it necessarily follows the trial court determined the remaining information in the affidavit was insufficient to support probable cause to obtain the search warrant.Â  We disagree and conclude the court erred in its analysis.Â  \r\nIn many Franks cases, a false statement in the supporting affidavit will render a search warrant defective.Â  However, the facts of this case are unique.Â  Had an arrest warrant or search warrant for the person of Craig Davis been sought prior to the officersâ€™ encounter with the suspects, the false identification in Staplesâ€™ affidavit would have rendered such a warrant fatally defective and any evidence seized as a result would necessarily have been suppressed.Â  However, the in camera testimony of Mishoe indicated he told police that one of the suspects looked like his neighbor, â€œChubby,â€ whom Williams knew to be Craig Davis. Â That tentative identification was sufficient to justify the officers proceeding to Davisâ€™ residence.Â  The sequence of events was logical from an investigative standpoint, and led to the discovery of two individuals emerging from a shed in the rear of the property.Â  The individualsâ€™ compliance with the request to get on the ground revealed a handgun protruding from the waistband of one of the men, which then led to the search of their persons. Â That search then revealed the additional weapons, and the suspects were arrested.[1]Â  After these events transpired, Staples sought the search warrant for the shed.Â  Staplesâ€™ affidavit revealed that two armed men emerged from the shed in a neighborhood where a shooting had very recently occurred. Â In reviewing the affidavit, we believe the unfolding circumstances described therein, not the false statement about a positive identification of Craig Davis, was the basis for the issuance of the search warrant, or at least was information sufficient to justify its issuance.[2]Â  In large measure, therefore, any identification of the suspect contained in the warrant is only coincidental because it was the shed located on the back of the residence that was the subject of the search, not the individual.Â  \r\nConsequently, the decision of the trial court is Â \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We make no determination regarding the propriety of Davisâ€™ arrest at the scene.\r\n[2] The relevant portion of the affidavit in its entirety states:Â  \r\n\r\nThat on December 31, 2004 Officers with the Conway City Police Department responded to the area of Durant Street for multiple shots fired call.Â  Upon officers arrival, they were met by off duty Conway officer Rodrock [sic] Mishoe who advised that he heard the shots being fired and a single round went into his residence.Â  Officer Rodrick [sic] advised that he saw two black males in his front yard area with guns and then he saw them run down John Street.Â  During the investigation it was learned that two subjects in officers yard were firing shots towards three black males [sic] subjects near the end of Durant Street.Â  It was also discovered that shots fired from two subjects in officers yard, penitrated [sic] a residence on Robin Road.Â  Officer Rodrick [sic] positively identified[2] one of the subjects firing shots in his yard as Graig [sic] Davis (B/M 1775 Hemingway Street, Conway, S.C.).Â  Officer went to residence of 1775 Heningway [sic] Street, to locate Graig [sic] Davis.Â  On officers approach to residence, Graig [sic] Davis along with subject 2 â€“ John Fletcher appeared from a shed located behind the residence of 1725 Hemingway Street.Â  For officers safety, subjects were advised to get on the ground, and protruding from the back pant of subject Graig [sic] Davis was a hand gun.Â  A search of each subject was done and a larger hand gun was located in the waist band of subject â€“ Graig [sic] Davis.Â  A search of subject 2 -Â  John Fletcher- revealed he was in possession of two handguns.Â  It is the belief of the affiant that more weapons and ammunition for weapons found will be located inside of wooden shed located behind the residence od [sic] 1725 Hemingway Street. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4184","title":"Jones v.

Mitchell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nPerry D. Boulier, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This is a medical malpractice case.Â  Annie Lee Jones (Jones), individually and on behalf of the estate of Katherine Elaine Jones (Katherine), contends the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion for a continuance and in granting summary judgment to the defendants in this action.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 9, 2001, Katherine was admitted to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center (SRMC) for the birth of her child.Â  The child was delivered by cesarean section the same day. Â Katherine was discharged on November 12, 2001; however, the child remained under medical care at SRMC.Â  According to a postpartum discharge form that Katherine had signed, she was instructed to return to SRMC on November 19, 2001, for an incision check.Â  \r\nDuring the early hours of November 17, 2001, Katherine was found dead in her apartment.Â  Based on autopsy results, it was determined Katherine â€œdied as a result of internal hemorrhage secondary to partial dehiscenceâ€ of the uterine incision from her cesarean section.Â  The dehiscence of this incision resulted in internal bleeding that caused her death.[1]Â  \r\nOn October 31, 2002, Jones, as special administrator of Katherineâ€™s estate, filed this wrongful death and survival action, claiming SRMC employees committed medical malpractice resulting in Katherineâ€™s death.Â  Â The lawsuit was filed against SRMC and â€œJohn or Jane Doe (unknown physician)â€ (collectively Defendants).\r\nIn her deposition, Jones testified Katherine was in good spirits when she left SRMC and did not complain about any physical problems resulting from the cesarean section.Â  A day or two later, however, Katherine complained to Jones in a telephone conversation that her stomach hurt and her feet were swelling.Â  Although Jones told Katherine to go to the hospital if the pain became severe and even offered to drive her there, Katherine said she would be all right. Â \r\nPriscilla Jones, Katherineâ€™s sister, stated in an affidavit that she visited Katherine almost every day after Katherine returned home from SRMC.Â  According to Priscilla, Katherine complained regularly to her about feeling cold and having swollen feet after the procedure.Â  In addition, Priscilla stated she heard Katherine, during a visit with her newborn child at SRMC, make similar complaints to â€œattending medical staff,â€ whom Priscilla did not otherwise identify. Â In her deposition, Priscilla similarly testified she saw Katherine every day from the time she was discharged to the time of her death and the only complaints Katherine had concerned the swelling of her feet.Â  Although Priscilla also testified she was present when Katherine called her doctor to make an appointment, she only heard Katherine say her feet were swollen.Â  \r\nMinnie Montgomery, Katherineâ€™s grandmother, stated in her affidavit Katherine had complained to her numerous times about abdominal pain.Â  According to the affidavit, Montgomery heard Katherine relate she had complained about her abdominal pain to a nurse while visiting her newborn at SRMC the previous day and the nurse said â€œit was just normal after birth symptoms.â€ Â Although Montgomery told Katherine to insist on seeing a doctor, Katherine said she would â€œtry to make it until the appointment [on November 19].â€ Â \r\nJoel S. Engel, M.D., Jonesâ€™s expert witness, gave his opinion in an affidavit that â€œhad [Katherine] had post-operative medical attention when complaining of her [severe] abdominal pain . . . identification of the incisional disruption and the finding of the hematoperitoneum would have prevented the untimely death of this woman.â€Â  He further stated that â€œ[d]ehiscence of a uterine and/or surgical incision is a known and acceptable risk assuming the operative procedure is performed in an accepted mannerâ€[2]; however, in his deposition, he agreed it was a rare occurrence and acknowledged he had never been personally involved in a similar case. \r\nFurthermore, when asked during his deposition to summarize his opinions in this case, Engel replied SRMCâ€™s only deviation from the standard of care was its failure to respond in an appropriate manner to Katherineâ€™s alleged complaints of severe abdominal pain that were â€œoutside the normal postoperative complaints.â€[3]Â  Engel further stated he received no records from SRMC suggesting a physician at SRMC had been made aware of any complaints from Katherine regarding abnormal abdominal pain.Â Â Â  He further agreed it was appropriate follow-up care to schedule an appointment for a patient who had just had a cesarean section seven days after her discharge. \r\nAfter Engelâ€™s deposition on February 14, 2005, Defendants moved for summary judgment.Â  The Spartanburg County Court of Common Pleas scheduled the motion for a hearing on June 6, 2005, at 3:15 p.m.\r\nAccording to the record on appeal, on June 6, 2005, at 11:14 a.m., the Spartanburg County Clerk of Court filed a motion by Jonesâ€™s attorney to continue the hearing based on an allegation that Defendants untimely served their memorandum in support of summary judgment and Jonesâ€™s attorney still had not received a transcript of a deposition.Â  Around 12:42 p.m. that same day, Judge John C. Hayes, a visiting judge presiding at the summary judgment hearing, received a faxed letter from Jonesâ€™s attorney advising counsel would not be available that afternoon because he had a divorce hearing in McCormick County that morning.Â  When the case was called, it appears no one on Jonesâ€™s behalf was present.Â  Judge Hayes stated on the record that he called the McCormick County Courthouse and had been informed by the clerk the hearing had concluded â€œbefore lunch,â€ and counsel â€œhad left there saying he was heading to Spartanburg.â€Â  Reasoning counsel had ample time to arrive at the summary judgment hearing, Judge Hayes then allowed Defendantsâ€™ attorney to present arguments concerning both the requests for a continuance and the summary judgment motion.Â  \r\nOn June 9, 2005, Judge Hayes issued an order granting summary judgment to Defendants, finding Jones â€œhas not presented any admissible evidence that Defendants were ever contacted by [Katherine] following her discharge on November 12, 2001 with any complaints of post-operative complicationsâ€ and concluding that â€œ[a]s Dr. Engelâ€™s opinions against Defendants are premised on the contention that the Defendants were negligent in failing to provide prompt and timely follow-up care, [Jonesâ€™s] claims fail as a matter of law.â€Â  \r\nJones moved for reconsideration pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP.Â  By order dated June 22, 2005, Judge Hayes denied the motion.Â  Jones then filed this appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We disagree with Jones that Judge Hayes erroneously â€œassumed the authorityâ€ of the chief administrative judge in denying her motion for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing.Â  The only legal authority Jones has cited to this court in support of this argument is Rule 40(i)(1), SCRCP.Â  Although that rule concerns requests for continuances, it authorizes â€œthe courtâ€ to grant such requests â€œfor good and sufficient cause.â€[4]Â  Furthermore, the letter counsel faxed requesting postponement of the hearing was addressed to Judge Hayes, notwithstanding he was a visiting judge in the circuit.\r\n2.Â  We further find Judge Hayes committed no abuse of discretion in refusing to continue the summary judgment hearing either for the reasons advanced in Jonesâ€™s formal motion or because of potential scheduling conflicts that were referenced in the subsequent letter that her attorney faxed to the court.[5]Â  Â \r\nBy letter dated May 16, 2005, counsel for Defendants notified Jonesâ€™s attorney the summary judgment motion would be heard on June 6, 2005, at 3:15 p.m. Â It was not until the day of the scheduled hearing that Jones filed a formal motion for a continuance, which was followed by the faxed letter from her attorney advising that he had a hearing in another county that morning. \r\nRegarding the scheduling conflict, Judge Hayes issued an order on June 21, 2005, in which he acknowledged he may have been under the misapprehension that Jonesâ€™s attorney had left the McCormick County Courthouse at noon rather than at 1:00 p.m.Â  Nevertheless, Judge Hayes determined there was still ample time for counsel to drive to Spartanburg for the summary judgment hearing even if he had departed one hour later than originally assumed and a telephone call could have addressed the situation if he had been running late.Â  Judge Hayes noted he based his finding about the driving time on www.mapquest.com.Â  Jones has not offered anything in her brief on appeal to suggest this source was unreliable.Â  \r\nAs to the grounds advanced in Jonesâ€™s formal motion, we hold neither is of sufficient merit to warrant a determination that Judge Hayesâ€™s refusal to continue the hearing amounted to an abuse of discretion.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure do not set a deadline for submitting memoranda of law prepared in conjunction with summary judgment motions.Â  In fact, such memoranda are not required at all.Â  Moreover, the deposition that Jones claimed she needed a transcript for had been taken twenty-four days before the scheduled hearing, giving her ample time to move for a continuance.Â  Accordingly, Judge Hayes did not err in refusing to grant the requested continuance.[6]  \r\n3.Â  Turning to the merits of the case, we disagree with Jonesâ€™s contention that summary judgment was improper.\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€[7]Â  â€œIn reviewing an order of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard as that which the circuit court applied in determining whether to enter the order.â€[8]Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€[9]Â  \r\nA plaintiff alleging medical malpractice must provide evidence of (1) â€œthe generally recognized practices and procedures which would be exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant doctorâ€™s field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances,â€[10] and (2) a departure by the defendantÂ  â€œfrom the recognized and generally accepted standards, practices and procedures in the manner alleged by the plaintiff.â€[11]Â  In addition, there must be evidence that the defendantâ€™s failure to meet the recognized standard of care was the proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s alleged injuries and damages.[12]Â  \r\nIn the present case, Engel opined Defendants departed from the standard of medical care in failing to provide post-operative medical attention to Katherine after she complained of severe abdominal pain.Â  Absent, however, is any admissible evidence suggesting that anyone responsible for Katherineâ€™s care and treatment, physician or otherwise, was made aware of her abdominal pain.\r\nHere, Priscilla Jonesâ€™s affidavit and deposition were the only evidence that a witness actually heard Katherine voice any complaints to hospital personnel.Â  As we have recounted earlier in this opinion, Priscilla stated in her affidavit that she heard Katherine tell a nurse that her feet were swollen and she had been feeling cold.Â  Likewise, in her deposition, Priscilla testified she heard Katherine telephone her doctor for an appointment; however, she only recalled Katherine complaining about her swollen feet.Â  In neither instance did Priscilla attest to hearing Katherine tell anyone at SRMC that she was experiencing abdominal pain.Â  \r\nAlthough Jones testified she heard about Katherineâ€™s abdominal pain from Katherine herself, Jones never stated she was present during any conversations that Katherine may have had with staff members at SRMC.Â  Montgomeryâ€™s affidavit indicates Montgomery had, at best, hearsay knowledge about Katherineâ€™s complaints to medical personnel about her abdominal pain.Â  Finally, as noted in footnote 6 of this opinion, Jones does not specifically take issue with Judge Hayesâ€™s finding that any claim by Montgomery in her deposition that she knew Katherine sought medical care for her abdominal pain was actually hearsay testimony. [13] \r\n4.Â  Finally, Jones appears to argue Judge Hayes failed to give due consideration to an undated, unsigned document entitled â€œStatement of Annie Jones,â€ in which Jones purportedly averred Katherine â€œsaid for four days that she had been repeatedly calling the doctor, complaining of constant severe abdominal pain, but the doctor neglected to schedule an appointment to see her until finally an appointment was given for November 19, 2001 â€“ however, she died on November 17, 2001.â€ Â In support of this argument, Jones notes in her brief that Engel acknowledged he reviewed this document, which was provided to him by Jonesâ€™s attorney.Â  The implication appears to be that, notwithstanding the hearsay characteristics of the statement at issue and the fact that the document itself lacked authentication, the statement and document were admissible as factual evidence because they formed the basis of Engelâ€™s opinion.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAlthough Jones does not cite any particular rule of evidence in her brief, she apparently relies on Rule 703, SCRE.Â  This rule permits an expert giving an opinion to rely on facts or data â€œthat are not admitted in evidence or even admissible into evidence.â€[14] Â The rule, however, does not allow for the unqualified admission of hearsay evidence merely because an expert has used it in forming an opinion.Â  Rather, as aptly set forth in one treatise:\r\n\r\n[T]he expert may testify to evidence even though it is inadmissible under the hearsay rule, but allowing the evidence to be received for this purpose does not mean it is admitted for its truth.Â  It is received only for the limited purpose of informing the jury of the basis of the expertâ€™s opinion and therefore does not constitute a true hearsay exception.[15]\r\n\r\nApplying this interpretation of Rule 703 to the present case, we hold that, even if Jones is correct that Engel â€œhad information about complaints by [Katherine] to the Hospital or any physician in the unsigned, undated, typewritten â€˜Statement of Annie Jones,â€™ â€ the document and the assertion that Katherine â€œsaid for four days that she had been repeatedly calling the doctor, complaining of constant abdominal painâ€ were, at best, admissible only to explain how Engel reached his determination regarding whether there was a breach of a duty in this case.Â  Neither the document nor the statement within it could have been admitted as evidence that someone responsible for Katherineâ€™s care and treatment at SRMC was alerted to her complaints of abdominal pain.Â  Absent such evidence, Jones has failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants deviated from the applicable standard of care.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The term â€œdehiscenceâ€ has been defined as â€œ[a] bursting open, as of a graafian follical or a wound, esp. a surgical abdominal wound.â€Â  Taberâ€™s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 507 (17th ed. 1993).\r\n[2]Â  Priscilla stated in her affidavit she was present during the surgery and heard one of the doctors performing the cesarean section say â€œOh-ohâ€ â€œin an alarming manner, as though a mistake had been madeâ€ and, when she asked if anything was wrong, a physician said, â€œWeâ€™ll take care of it.â€Â  Despite this allegation, there was no attempt to develop the theory that Katherineâ€™s death resulted from the surgery itself.\r\n[3] Although Engel testified no dictated operative report was present in Katherineâ€™s file and stated this omission was â€œone glaring deficiency in the records,â€ there was no showing that Jones made any attempt to obtain such a report or that the absence of the report was proximately linked to the damages claimed in this lawsuit.\r\n[4]Â  Rule 40(i)(1), SCRCP.Â  Although paragraph (h) of Rule 40 requires â€œ[t]he Chief Judge for Administrative Purposes, in cooperation with the clerkâ€ to be â€œresponsible for setting all matters on the Nonjury Docket for disposition,â€ the rule does not specify that scheduling changes need approval from the chief administrative judge.\r\n[5]Â  See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 309, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997) (stating a ruling on a motion for a continuance is within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion).\r\n[6]Â  In her formal motion for a continuance, Jones alleged as good cause for a continuance that SRMC â€œchallenges the affidavit of Plaintiffâ€™s witness Minnie Montgomery, who was deposed Friday, May 13, 2005, and whose requested deposition transcript has not been received by Plaintiff, and to provide said transcript to Plaintiffâ€™s medical expert as an additional basis for his opinion . . . .â€ Â Pursuant to Jonesâ€™s motion for reconsideration, Judge Hayes issued an order in which he noted he read the deposition at issue â€œout of interestâ€ and found the â€œfirsthand knowledgeâ€ Montgomery claimed to have regarding Katherineâ€™s attempt to obtain medical care was actually inadmissible hearsay testimony.Â  Jones does not specifically challenge this finding in her brief.Â  Assuming, then, without deciding that Jones did not receive timely notice that Montgomeryâ€™s affidavit would be challenged, she failed to make a showing on appeal that Montgomeryâ€™s deposition would have cured the defects in the earlier statement.\r\n[7]Â  Gadson v.

Maddox, both of Blythewood, for Appellant.\r\nJames D. Calmes, III, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Henry Claude Dismuke, Jr. brought this action pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-410 (2006) to reinstate his driverâ€™s license, contending the two-year term for the suspension of his license had run following his plea of guilty to driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration over two years before.Â  By this appeal, the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles challenges the trial courtâ€™s order rescinding the Departmentâ€™s suspension order.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nOn February 18, 2002, Dismuke pled guilty, as we indicated above, to driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration in violation of South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2933 (2006).Â  The Greenville County Clerk of Court did not forward the ticket relating to Dismukeâ€™s conviction to the Department until June 15, 2005.[3]Â  Upon receipt of the ticket, the Department suspended Dismukeâ€™s driverâ€™s license and notified him the period of his suspension would begin on July 9, 2005 and end on July 9, 2007.Â  Dismuke then brought this action. Â \r\nAt the hearing upon his petition for reinstatement of his license, Dismuke testified he surrendered his license when he pled guilty. Â An employee of the Greenville County Clerk of Court, however, testified nothing on the face of the indictment indicated this had in fact occurred as would usually be the case had it done so.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2990(F) (2006) provides in part:\r\n\r\nExcept as provided for in Section 56-1-365(D) and (E), the driverâ€™s license suspension periods under this section begin on the date the person is convicted, receives sentence upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or forfeits bail posted for the violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933 . . . .\r\n\r\nAnother code section, South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-365(C) (2006), provides in part:\r\n\r\nExcept as provided in Section 56-5-2990, if the defendant surrendered his license to the magistrate or clerk immediately after conviction, the effective date of the revocation or suspension is the date of surrender. Â If the magistrate or clerk wilfully fails to forward the license and ticket to the department within five days, the suspension or revocation does not begin until the department receives and processes the license and ticket.\r\n\r\nThe trial court made only two findings of fact: Â that the clerk of court â€œdid not wilfully fail to forward [Dismukeâ€™s] license and ticket to the [D]epartment within five (5) daysâ€ and that Dismukeâ€™s suspension began on February 18, 2002 and ended on February 18, 2004.Â  The trial court viewed section 56-5-2990(F) as controlling.Â  We agree.\r\nAbsent a finding that Dismuke did not surrender his driverâ€™s license â€œimmediately after [his] convictionâ€ upon his plea of guilty and absent a finding that the clerk of court â€œwilfully fail[ed] to forward the licenseâ€ to the Department, â€œthe driverâ€™s license suspension period[ ]â€ in question â€œbeg[an] on the date [he] . . . receive[d] sentence upon a plea of guiltyâ€; i.e., February 18, 2002.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We do not address the Departmentâ€™s second issue regarding whether Dismuke â€œowesâ€ nearly five months suspension time to the State.Â  Dismuke testified he obtained another driverâ€™s license on September 25, 2003, following his release on June 19, 2003, from federal prison after fourteen months imprisonment for a parole violation.Â  The Department first raised the issue of extending Dismukeâ€™s suspension in the court below during oral argument at the close of the case.Â  Although the trial court acknowledged in its oral remarks that Dismukeâ€™s suspension ended on February 18, 2004, without regard to the license that Dismuke obtained in 2003, the trial court never addressed in its written order the effect of Dismukeâ€™s obtaining another license some five months before his period of suspension ended.Â  See Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004) (noting an issue must be both raised to and ruled on by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); cf. Owens v. Magill, 308 S.C. 556, 564, 419 S.E.2d 786, 791 (1992) (â€œ[A] judge was not bound by a prior oral ruling and could issue a written order which conflicted with the prior oral ruling.â€).Â  In addition, the Department did not ask the court to address the issue in a motion to alter or amend its judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Without an express ruling on this issue, we are powerless to review it.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding the court of appeals should not address an issue that the â€œcircuit court did not explicitly rule onâ€ and was not the subject of a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to amend or alter the judgment).Â  \r\n[2] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  Testimony given by a clerk of court employee indicated an in-office audit led to the discovery of Dismukeâ€™s ticket in 2005.Â  The witness blamed a computer coding error and a change in the case management system for the failure to report Dismukeâ€™s conviction to the Department.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4186","title":"Commissioners of Public Works v.

Shahid and Lucas C. Padgett, Jr., both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding DHEC erred in imposing certain flow and load limits in permits issued to the Charleston Commissioners of Public Works and the North Charleston Sewer District (hereinafter â€œRespondentsâ€).Â Â  For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand to the circuit court for the purpose of remanding to the DHEC Board.Â  \r\nI.\r\nRespondents collect and treat wastewater for portions of Charleston and Berkeley counties.Â  The treated wastewater, called effluent, is discharged into either the Cooper River or Charleston Harbor.Â  This discharge is permitted, subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits issued by DHEC.Â  In February 2003, DHEC issued Respondents renewed NPDES permits.Â  Respondents requested a contested case hearing to challenge various provisions of the renewed permits.Â  \r\nRespondents challenged the renewed permits in two respects.Â  First, Respondents argued there was no factual or legal basis for DHEC to impose weekly and monthly volumetric effluent flow limits (flow limits) in the renewed permits.Â  Second, Respondents argued there was no factual or legal basis for DHEC to impose ultimate oxygen demand (UOD) load limits in the renewed permits.Â  The UOD load limits set forth in the renewed permits vary depending on the time of the year; the limits set for the months of November through February (â€œwinter monthsâ€) are approximately three times higher than the limits set for the months of March through October.[1] \r\nThe UOD load limits were based upon a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) established by DHEC.[2]Â  The TMDL purports to implement regulation 61-68(D)(4)(a) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), a regulation known as the â€œ0.1 Rule.â€Â  The â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ prohibits the quality of surface water from being cumulatively lowered more than 0.1 mg/l for dissolved oxygen from point sources and other activities when natural conditions cause a depression of dissolved oxygen.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-68(D)(4)(a) (Supp. 2005).Â  Respondents argued DHEC has no authority to apply UOD load limits during a given month in which there is no evidence of a depression of dissolved oxygen in the Cooper River or Charleston Harbor system for that month.Â  Specifically, Respondents challenged the imposition of lower UOD load limits during March, April, May, and October (the â€œshoulder monthsâ€).[3]Â  DHEC sought to justify the imposition of UOD load limits for the â€œshoulder monthsâ€ on a predictive modeling analysisâ€”a holistic approach that does not narrowly depend on the data for a specific month to warrant UOD load limits for that month.\r\nThe Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) affirmed the issuance of the permits subject to two modifications.Â  First, the ALJ ordered DHEC to remove the flow limits.Â  The ALJ found DHEC lacked the authority to impose flow limits in an NPDES permit, concluding neither the South Carolina Code nor DHEC regulations authorize imposition of flow limits. Further, the ALJ found that, under the facts of this case, flow limits were unnecessary to protect water quality.Â  \r\nSecond, the ALJ ordered DHEC to remove the UOD load limits set for the â€œshoulder months.â€Â  The ALJ adopted Respondentsâ€™ view and held the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ does not apply to the â€œshoulder monthsâ€ because there is no evidence of a depression in dissolved oxygen levels attributable to a natural condition during these months.Â  The ALJ thus concluded that the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ is only applicable during months in which such a depression is exhibited.Â  The ALJ determined the UOD load limits established for the â€œwinter monthsâ€ should also apply to the â€œshoulder months.â€Â  The ALJ further found DHEC was not authorized to rely on the TMDL to set permit limits because the TMDL was not promulgated as a regulation. \r\nDHEC appealed the ALJâ€™s order to the DHEC Board (the Board).Â  Citing the South Carolina Pollution Control Act (SCPCA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-1-10 to -350 (1987 and Supp. 2005), and regulation 61-9 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), the Board first held DHEC has the â€œlegal authority to require flow limits in NPDES permits.â€Â  The Board, however, joined the ALJ in concluding effluent flow limits were not warranted on the facts presented in this case.Â  Accordingly, the Board affirmed the removal of the flow limits. \r\nThe Board next held the ALJ erred in interpreting the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ as a matter of law.Â  The Board construed the statute and regulation as follows: â€œIf a waterbody is found to be a â€˜naturally dissolved oxygen waterbodyâ€™ for some period during the year, the requirements of Code Â§48-1-83 and related Regulation 61-68.D.4 apply.â€Â  Thus, contrary to the ALJâ€™s narrow interpretation that DHEC may only impose UOD load limits during the months a depression in dissolved oxygen levels is exhibited, the Board ruled the UOD load limits may be imposed any time during the year provided the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ is triggered at some point in the year.Â  Because DHEC did not appeal the ALJâ€™s finding that the TMDL was improperly relied on to establish UOD load limits, the Board remanded the permits to DHEC to establish UOD load limits without relying on the TMDL.[4] \r\nRespondents appealed to the circuit court.Â  Regarding the effluent flow limits (which had been ordered removed from the challenged permits), the circuit court proceeded to address the legal issue of whether DHEC has authority to impose effluent flow limits in NPDES permits.Â  The circuit court ruled DHEC lacks any express authority, either in statute or regulation, to impose flow limits.Â  The circuit court also held that â€œwhile the Board ordered the removal [sic] flow limits from the [Respondentsâ€™] permits, those limits have not been removed and the issue of the Boardâ€™s authority to impose flow limits is justiciable nevertheless because it is capable of repetition.â€\r\nThe circuit court agreed with Respondentsâ€™ legal claim that section 48-1-83 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) and regulation 61-68(D)(4)(a)â€”regarding the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€â€”were unambiguous.Â  Although the statute and the regulation are silent as to when the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ may be applied, the circuit court ruled the law only allows the imposition of UOD load limits for a particular month when dissolved oxygen levels in a waterbody fall below the standard for that month.Â  As a result, the circuit court found the Board erred in remanding Respondentsâ€™ permits to DHEC staff for the purpose of calculating UOD loads for the â€œshoulder months.â€Â  The circuit court reversed the Board and reinstated the ALJâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nII.\r\nThe ALJ presides over all hearings of contested DHEC permitting cases and, in such cases, serves as the finder of fact.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006); see also Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  The Board, pursuant to section 1-23-610(D) of the South Carolina Code (2005), reviewed the ALJâ€™s order.[5]Â  On appeal of such a contested case, a reviewing tribunal â€œmust affirm the ALJ if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, not based on the [reviewing tribunalâ€™s] own view of the evidence.â€Â  Dorman v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C 159, 166, 565 S.E.2d. 119, 123 (Ct. App. 2002); Â§ 1-23-610(D).Â  The circuit court conducted the second appellate review under section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005).[6]\r\nOur review of the circuit court, which constitutes the third appellate review, is also governed by section 1-23-380(A)(6).Â  Accordingly, this court may reverse the ALJâ€™s decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced and the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions (1) violate constitutional or statutory provisions, (2) exceed the statutory authority of the agency, (3) are based upon unlawful procedure, (4) are affected by other error of law, (5) are clearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the entire record, or (6) are either arbitrary, capricious, or reflect abuse of discretion or the obvious unwarranted exercise of discretion.Â  Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6); Weaver v. S.C. Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 368, 374, 423 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1992).Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nÂ Under our standard of review, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the ALJâ€™s findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the whole record.Â  See Marlboro Park Hosp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 573, 580, 595 S.E.2d 851, 855 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.Â  Leventis v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 340 S.C. 118, 130, 530 S.E.2d 643, 650 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nIII.\r\nDHEC contends the circuit court erred in finding Respondents adequately preserved issues for appeal because Respondentsâ€™ Petition for Judicial Review (petition) failed to properly raise the issues for consideration.Â  We disagree.Â  Having carefully reviewed the petition, we find it adequately apprised the circuit court of â€œthe abuse or abuses allegedly committed below through a distinct and specific statement of the rulings complained of.â€Â  Smith v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 284 S.C. 469, 471, 327 S.E.2d 348, 349 (1985).Â  Because the issues were sufficiently preserved in the appeal to the circuit court, we now turn to the merits.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nDHEC alleges the circuit court erred in rejecting the Boardâ€™s interpretation of the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ and finding the rule may only be applied during the months in which a natural depression in dissolved oxygen levels is demonstrated.Â  DHEC argues the regulation is ambiguous and, therefore, the Boardâ€™s interpretation is entitled to deference.Â  We agree.Â Â Â  \r\nGenerally, â€œthe construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002) (quoting Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987)).Â  Indeed, the courts will typically defer to agency interpretation.Â  Id. at 515, 560 S.E.2d at 415.Â  \r\nWe note, however, â€œ[t]he primary rule of statutory construction is that the Court must ascertain the intention of the legislature.â€Â  Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002).Â  Moreover, where the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning, without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Moody v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 28, 30-31, 579 S.E.2d 527, 529 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, the court will reject the agencyâ€™s interpretation where it is specifically contrary to the statute or regulation.Â  Brown, 348 S.C. at 515, 560 S.E.2d at 415. Â \r\nSection 48-1-83(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), the controlling statute of the â€œ0.1 Rule,â€ provides:\r\n\r\n  [DHEC] shall not allow a depression in dissolved oxygen concentration greater than 0.10 mg/l in a naturally low dissolved oxygen waterbody unless the requirements of this section are all satisfied by demonstrating that resident aquatic species shall not be adversely affected.Â  The provisions of this section apply in addition to any standards for a dissolved oxygen depression in a naturally low dissolved oxygen waterbody promulgated by [DHEC] by regulation.\r\n\r\nRegulation 61-68(D)(4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), drafted pursuant to the authority granted by the SCPCA, provides: \r\n\r\n  Certain natural conditions may cause a depression of dissolved oxygen in surface waters while existing and classified uses are still maintained. Â The Department shall allow a dissolved oxygen depression in these naturally low dissolved oxygen waterbodies as prescribed below pursuant to the Act, Section 48-1-83, et seq., 1976 Code of Laws:\r\n  a. Under these conditions the quality of the surface waters shall not be cumulatively lowered more than 0.1 mg/l for dissolved oxygen from point sources and other activities . . . .\r\n\r\nWe find the statute and regulation are ambiguous as to when the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ applies.Â  Clearly, the regulation requires the quality of the surface waters â€œnot be cumulatively lowered more than 0.1 mg/l for dissolved oxygen from point sources or other activitiesâ€ when â€œ[c]ertain natural conditions . . . cause a depression of dissolved oxygen . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  The regulation is silent, however, as to the timing of the limitationsâ€™ application and allows for multiple interpretations.Â  DHEC asserts, for example, that the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ may be applied year-round whenever natural conditions cause a depression of dissolved oxygen in a waterbody at some point during the year.Â  \r\nThere is support for DHECâ€™s position in the record before us.Â  Larry Turner, manager of the Water Quality Modeling section for DHEC, testified that DHEC developed loadings that are protective and conservative.Â  He explained that during the four winter months (not at issue), DHEC determined less restrictive limits are required based on a number of factors including the cold weather and the increased ability of the system to absorb a pollutant without violating the standard during that period of the year.Â  For the remainder of the year, DHEC applied the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ as a protective measure given that the four summer months have a clearly demonstrated need for the â€œ0.1 Rule.â€ Â \r\nWe appreciate Respondentsâ€™ desire that we find the statute and regulation mandate a monthly justification for the imposition of UOD load limits for a given month.Â  There is, however, no language in the statute or regulation that suggests DHEC is confined to a narrow examination of a particular monthâ€™s testing results to justify the application of the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ for that month.Â  \r\nWe find the statute is ambiguous and, therefore, defer to the Boardâ€™s interpretation.Â  See S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005) (â€œCourts defer to the relevant administrative agencyâ€™s decisions with respect to its own regulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.â€); see also Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987) (â€œThe construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€).Â  \r\nWe find no compelling reasons to overrule the Boardâ€™s interpretation as it is neither arbitrary nor capricious, and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.Â  Further, Larry Turnerâ€™s testimony provides a sound basis for why DHEC would take a holistic approach (and not a myopic month-to-month analysis) in evaluating when reasonable UOD load limits in a naturally dissolved oxygen waterbody are warranted.Â  Admittedly, UOD load limits are issued in monthly intervals, but the decision whether to impose UOD load limits in a given month is not restricted to testing data for that month.Â  \r\nWe find the Boardâ€™s interpretation of the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€â€”the statute and regulation it is charged with enforcingâ€”is reasonable and in line with its overall statutory mandate.Â  We hold the circuit court erred in reversing the Board and adopt the Boardâ€™s finding that when natural conditions cause a depression of dissolved oxygen in a waterbody at some point during the year the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ may be applied.Â Â Â Â  \r\nV.\r\nDHEC asserts the circuit court erred in reversing the Boardâ€™s remand of the renewed permits for a determination of the applicable UOD load limits for the â€œshoulder months.â€Â  We agree.Â  \r\nInitially, we note the procedural posture of this case is awkward and confusing.Â  Respondents acknowledge decreased UOD load limits apply during the critical summer months and only challenge the imposition of the lower limits during the â€œshoulder months.â€Â  The ALJ found DHEC improperly relied on the TMDL to establish UOD load limits and this ruling was not challenged by DHEC.Â  Thus, while DHEC used the TMDL to establish the renewed permit conditions for the entire year, DHEC is barred in connection with these permits from using the TMDL to establish limits for the â€œshoulder months.â€Â  As a result, the Board, after finding the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ may be applied year-round, remanded the renewed permits to DHEC to allow UOD load limits to be imposed during the â€œshoulder monthsâ€ without relying on the TMDL.Â  Yet, the TMDL was used to determine the limits for the other months.Â  \r\nNevertheless, pursuant to section 1-23-610(D) of the South Carolina Code (2005), the Board has authority to remand a case for further proceedings.Â  Because we defer to DHECâ€™s interpretation of the application of the â€œ0.1 Rule,â€ we necessarily reinstate the Boardâ€™s remand of the permits to DHEC.Â  DHEC must be given the opportunity to establish UOD load limits for the â€œshoulder monthsâ€ without relying on the TMDL.Â  \r\nVI.\r\nDHEC alleges the circuit court erred in finding DHEC does not have the authority to impose flow limits in an NPDES permit.Â  We decline to address this legal issue because any ruling issued by this court would be merely advisory. \r\nIt is unchallenged that there is no factual basis for flow limits in the subject NPDES permits.Â  The ALJ ordered DHEC to remove the flow limits from the renewed permits, and the Board affirmed this ruling.Â  DHEC did not appeal the removal of the flow limits from the NPDES permits.Â  Therefore, this is the law of the case.Â  Ulmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, __, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006) (â€œA portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case.â€) (quoting Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., 358 S.C. 298, 320, 594 S.E.2d 867, 878 (Ct. App. 2004)).\r\nThe only issue concerning flow limits addressed and decided by the circuit court was whether DHEC has the legal authority to impose the flow limits.Â  The circuit court erred in addressing this issue.Â  Determining whether DHEC is authorized to include flow limits in an NPDES permit will have no impact on a party in a case where flow limits have been ordered to be removed from the renewed permits.Â  We hold DHECâ€™s inability to enforce the flow limits based on the unchallenged factual findings makes any opinion regarding DHECâ€™s authority to impose flow limits advisory.Â  Accordingly, this court will not address the issue.[7]Â  See Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 76 n.36, 558 S.E.2d 902, 911 n.36 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThis court will not issue advisory opinions that have no practical effect on the outcome.â€); see also In re Chance, 277 S.C. 161, 161, 284 S.E.2d 231, 231 (1981) (noting South Carolina appellate courts have â€œconsistently refrainedâ€ from issuing purely advisory opinions).\r\nVII.\r\nWe find (1) the Boardâ€™s interpretation of the application of the â€œ0.1 Ruleâ€ is entitled to deference because the statute and regulation are ambiguous; (2) the Boardâ€™s remand of the renewed permits to allow DHEC to determine the UOD load limits for the â€œshoulder monthsâ€ without relying on the TMDL was proper; and (3) the circuit court erred in deciding the issue of whether DHEC has the authority to impose flow limits in an NPDES permit because the issue is not in controversy.Â  Moreover, to the extent the issue of DHECâ€™s legal authority to impose effluent flow limits was addressed below, all legal conclusions are vacated.Â  The Boardâ€™s order should be reinstated except for the finding regarding DHECâ€™s authority to impose flow limits.Â  \r\nThe decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Higher UOD limits are easier for Respondents to meet; lower UOD limits are more restrictive and, therefore, more difficult for Respondents to meet.Â  \r\n[2]Â  DHECâ€™s Exhibit 6 provides this description of the TMDL process: â€œThe TMDL process establishes the allowable loading of pollutants or other quantifiable parameters for a waterbody based on the relationship between pollution sources and instream water quality conditions, so that the states can establish water quality based controls to reduce pollution from both point and non-point sources and restore and maintain the quality of their water resources.â€Â  \r\n[3]Â  Respondents raised an additional issue at the contested case hearing regarding whether requirements for whole effluent toxicity testing were properly included in the permits.Â  The testing requirements were found proper and this finding was not challenged on appeal.Â  \r\n[4]Â  DHEC did not challenge the ALJâ€™s rejection of the TMDL.Â  The Board, sitting in an appellate capacity, was thus bound by the ALJâ€™s determination in this regard.Â  We further note that DHECâ€™s decision to impose, or not to impose, UOD load limits for eight months of the year (other than the â€œshoulder monthsâ€) was not challenged, although the TMDL served as the basis for DHECâ€™s permitting decisions. \r\n[5]Â  Section 1-23-610(D) was amended by Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387; however, the applicable language at all times pertinent to the present appeal is found in section 1-23-610(D) of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  Pursuant to the amendment, effective July 1, 2006, DHEC administrative appeals will no longer track the awkward path followed here where the DHEC Board sits in an appellate capacity and applies the substantial evidence standard of review under the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  See Marlboro Park Hosp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 573, 577, 595 S.E.2d 851, 853 (Ct. App. 2004) (outlining the DHEC Boardâ€™s standard of review prior to the 2006 amendment). \r\n[6]Â  This section was also amended by Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387; however, as above, the applicable language at all times pertinent to the present appeal is found in section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  \r\n[7]Â  Our decision not to address this issue is further supported by the uncertain circumstances surrounding it.Â  If DHEC has the authority to impose flow limits in NPDES permits, as it contends, DHEC has done nothing required to promulgate this authority into a regulation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-1-30 (1987) (providing that DHEC is required to promulgate regulations to implement the SCPCA); see also Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, Op. No. 26209 (S.C. Sup. Ct. Filed Sept. 25, 2006) (Shearouse Ad. Sh. No. 36 at 46) (â€œIn order to promulgate a regulation, the APA generally requires a state agency to give notice of a drafting period during which public comments are accepted on a proposed regulation; conduct a public hearing on the proposed regulation overseen by an administrative law judge or an agencyâ€™s governing board; possibly prepare reports about the regulationâ€™s impact on the economy, environment, and public health; and submit the regulation to the Legislature for review, modification, and approval or rejection.â€) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-110 to -160 (2005 and Supp. 2005)).Â  Conversely, DHEC argues it can apply flow limits as it chooses because its action does not establish a â€œbinding norm.â€Â  Yet, DHEC has provided this court with no standard setting forth the conditions under which DHEC will impose the flow limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4187","title":"Kimmer v.

Johnson, III, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nThomas H. Pope, of Newberry, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Richard Kimmer sought benefits for an alleged work injury.Â  Before filing his workersâ€™ compensation claim and without notifying his employer-carrier (collectively Murata), Kimmer settled a third party claim for the liability policy limit.Â  The single commissioner concluded Kimmer elected his remedy by failing to notify Murata, and his workersâ€™ compensation claim was barred.Â  The Appellate Panel adopted the single commissionerâ€™s conclusion.Â  Kimmer appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the Appellate Panel and awarded Kimmer total disability benefits.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 29, 1999, Kimmer sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident as he was driving to work for his employer, Murata. Â The driver at fault was Anthony Pendergrass. As a result of the accident, Kimmer was diagnosed with meniscal tears in both knees, a ruptured disc at L4-5, post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression.Â Â Â  Following the accident, Kimmer had three surgeries on his right knee and one surgery on his left knee.Â  \r\nPendergrass had automobile liability insurance with a policy limit of $15,000. Following the accident and without notice to Murata, Kimmer negotiated a settlement of the third party claim with Pendergrassâ€™ liability carrier for the policy limit. Â On June 16, 1999, Kimmer signed a release of all claims against Pendergrass. Â \r\nKimmer filed a Form 50 on June 18, 1999, and an Amended Form 50 on May 29, 2002, seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  On June 18, 2002, Murata filed its Form 51 denying Kimmerâ€™s claim and asserting as a defense that the third party action had been settled without consent.Â  On December 10, 2002, a hearing was held to determine the issues set forth in the Forms 50 and 51.Â  The single commissioner found Kimmerâ€™s injuries compensable because Murata provided him with a car allowance and mileage.Â  However, she denied Kimmerâ€™s claim. Relying on Fisher v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Retardation-Coastal Ctr., 277 S.C. 573, 291 S.E.2d 200 (1982), the single commissioner concluded the settlement of the third party claim, without notice to Murata, constituted an election of remedies and barred the workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\nThe Appellate Panel affirmed and adopted the order of the single commissioner.Â Â  On appeal to the circuit court, the trial judge (1) reversed the order of the Appellate Panel, (2) awarded total and permanent disability to Kimmer, (3) awarded Murata an offset of $10,000 (the net amount of the third party settlement), and (4) entered judgment in favor of Kimmer in the amount of $209,235.00.Â  \r\nOn July 25, 2005, Murata filed a Motion for Reconsideration.Â  The circuit court issued an amended order reversing the order of the Appellate Panel and finding that (1) Murata suffered no prejudice as a result of the settlement without notice, (2) Kimmer was totally and permanently disabled, and (3) Kimmer was entitled to an award of total and permanent disability, less an offset for the third party settlement.Â  Murata then filed a Motion to Reconsider arguing the circuit court erroneously inserted a prejudice requirement into workersâ€™ compensation cases involving election of remedies. Â The motion was denied on September 1, 2005. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of workersâ€™ compensation commission decisions.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct. App. 2005) cert. granted, November 2, 2006; Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency decision if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€ Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 457, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005); Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006). Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â Â \r\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006).\r\nAn administrative agencyâ€™s findings are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â \r\nAnderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 492, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 48, 515 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1999); Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 222, 628 S.E.2d 262, 266 (Ct. App. 2006).Â \r\nAccordingly, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions\r\nof fact. Â Stephen, 324 S.C. at 337, 478 S.E.2d at 76. It is not within our province to reverse findings of the Appellate Panel which are supported by substantial evidence. Â Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Instead, review of issues of fact is limited to determining whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Â Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 289, 599 S.E.2d at 610-11.Â  â€œOn appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports the findings.â€Â  Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004); Jones v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 417, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe circuit court held Kimmerâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation action was not barred by his third party settlement, but only subject to an offset for the third party settlement he received.Â  Murata contends this holding was error because Kimmer settled his third party claim without notice to Murata, thereby electing his remedy.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act provides claimants with three remedies for job-related injuries:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Pursuant to section 42-1-560 (c) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) a claimant may proceed solely against the employer, thereby allowing the employer-carrier the opportunity to pursue reimbursement against the third party for its obligated payments: \r\n  \r\nIf, prior to the expiration of the one-year period referred to in subsection (b), or within thirty days prior to the expiration of the time in which such action may be brought, the injured employee . . . shall not have commenced action against or settled with the third party, the right of action of the injured employee . . . shall pass by assignment to the carrier; provided, that the assignment shall not occur less than twenty days after the carrier has notified the injured employee . . . in writing, by personal service or by registered or certified mail that failure to commence such action will operate as an assignment of the cause of action to the carrier.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (2) Alternatively, a claimant may proceed solely against the third party tortfeasor under section 42-1-550 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) by instituting and prosecuting an action at law:\r\n  \r\nWhen an employee, his personal representative or other person may have a right to recover damages for injury, loss of service or death from any person other than the employer, he may institute an action at law against such third person before an award is made under this Title [Workersâ€™ Compensation Act] and prosecute it to its final determination.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (3) Or a claimant may proceed against both the employer-carrier and the third party tortfeasor by complying with section 42-1-560 (b) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005):\r\n\r\nThe injured employee . . . shall be entitled to receive the compensation and other benefits provided by this Title [Workersâ€™ Compensation Act] and to enforce by appropriate proceedings his or their rights against the third party . . . . In such case the carrier shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery from the third party whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, to the extent of the total amount of compensation, including medical and other expenses, paid, or to be paid by such carrier, less the reasonable and necessary expenses, including attorney fees, incurred in effecting the recovery, and to the extent the recovery shall be deemed to be for the benefit of the carrier . . . . Notice of the commencement of the action shall be given within thirty days thereafter to the Industrial Commission, the employer and carrier upon a form prescribed by the Industrial Commission. \r\n\r\n\r\nSee Fisher v. S. C. Depâ€™t of Mental Retardation, 277 S.C. 573, 575, 291 S.E.2d 200, 201 (1982) (emphasis added). \r\nI.Â  Notice\r\n\r\nThe imperative nature of the statutory language mandating notice of a third party claim to the employer-carrier is well established by our precedent.Â  In 1982, our Supreme Court announced that a claimant who settled his third party case without notice to the employer or carrier elected his remedy and waived any right to workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Fisher, 277 S.C. at 576, 291 S.E.2d at 201. Â As in the instant case, Fisher sought workersâ€™ compensation benefits after making a compromise settlement with a third party tortfeasor without the consent of the carrier. Â The single commissioner, Appellate Panel, and circuit court agreed Fisher had elected to proceed against a third party without complying with section 42-1-560 and, having done so, had no further remedy under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Noting section 42-1-560 (b) does not specifically state the consequences of failure to notify the employer-carrier of a third party claim or settlement, the court emphasized, â€œit is clear from a reading of the statute that the legislature did not intend for a claimant to settle his third party case without regard to the employerâ€™s rights for subrogation under Â§ 42-1-560 and still maintain a workmenâ€™s compensation claim.â€ Â Fisher, 277 S.C. at 575, 291 S.E.2d at 201. Â The Fisher court reiterated an earlier observation that â€œ[t]he object of Â§ 42-1-560 is to effect an equitable adjustment of the rights of all the parties.â€ Â Stroy v. Millwood Drug Store, Inc., 235 S.C. 52, ___, 109 S.E.2d 706, 709 (1959). Drawing from its analysis in a case decided under prior statutes, the court recognized â€œ[i]t would â€˜defeat this objective to allow the employee to demand compensation from the employer after having destroyed the employerâ€™s normal right to obtain reimbursement from the third party.â€™ â€ Id. at 575-76, 291 S.E.2d at 201(quoting Stroy, 235 S.C. 52, 109 S.E.2d at 709).Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle articulated in Fisher when it addressed a dilemma generated by asbestos claims.Â  In Talley v. John-Mansville Sales Corp., workersâ€™ instituted product liability actions against asbestos manufacturers. 285 S.C. 117, 118, 328 S.E.2d 621, 622 (1985).Â  The workers sought to have the asbestos manufacturersâ€™ settlement offers approved by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in order to comply with section 42-1-560 and protect their potential workersâ€™ compensation claims. Â Id. at 118, 328 S.E.2d at 622.Â  The Commission refused to approve the settlements, ruling it had no jurisdiction because the workers had not yet become disabled.Â  Id. Â Consequently, the workers applied for a stay of the civil actions, which the circuit judge denied.Â  Id. at 119, 328 S.E.2d at 623.Â  Our Supreme Court reversed the denial, explaining: â€œ[h]ad [the workers] concluded their product liability actions, by settlement or otherwise, they would have made a binding election of remedies under Fisher v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Retardation, 277 S.C. 573, 291 S.E.2d 200 (1982), and would be barred from pursuing benefits under workersâ€™ compensation at a later date.â€ Â Talley, 285 S.C at 118, 328 S.E.2d at 622.Â  On the other hand, if the workers waited until they became disabled for workersâ€™ compensation purposes, their third party actions would be barred by the statute of limitations. Â Id. Â The court declined to carve out an exception in the statute to accommodate these unusual circumstances, concluding:Â  â€œ[s]uch a change is a function of the legislature, and this court refuses to usurp legislative authority in this matter.â€Â  Id. at 119, 328 S.E.2d at 622. Â Instead, the court ordered entry of the stay to avoid the inequity that would result from the application of Fisher to the circumstances in Talley. Â Id. at 199, 3289 S.E.2s at 623, n. 2.\r\nSubsequently, the Court of Appeals addressed the notice requirement in Johnson v. Pennsylvania Millers Mut. Ins. Co., 292 S.C. 33, 354 S.E.2d 791 (Ct. App. 1987) and Hudson v. Townsend Saw Chain Co., 296 S.C. 17, 370 S.E.2d 104 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In Johnson, the claimant prosecuted his third party claim to an adverse conclusion. Â 292 S.C. at 34, 354 S.E.2d at 792. Â The single commissioner and Appellate Panel, relying on Fisher, agreed with Pennsylvania Millers that the claimant had elected his remedy and waived his right to compensation.Â  Id. at 34-5, 354 S.E.2d at 792.Â  The circuit court disagreed. Â Id. at 36, 354 S.E.2d at 796. Â On appeal, we distinguished Fisher as inapplicable in Johnson, because the claimant in Johnson did not settle the third party action; rather, he prosecuted the case to its full conclusion. Â Id. at 39, 354 S.E.2d 794. Â â€œIf [the claimant] had settled the third party action and had done so without Pennsylvania Millersâ€™ consent, the Supreme Courtâ€™s holding in Fisher would have barred him from thereafter pursuing a workersâ€™ compensation claim.â€ Â Id. (emphasis added) Â Neither the single commissioner nor the Appellate Panel had determined whether the claimant had complied with the notice requirements. Id. Consequently, we remanded to the Commission for that determination and emphasized if the claimant gave proper notice of the third party action, then he had not elected his remedy or waived his workersâ€™ compensation claim.\r\n\r\nNeither Section 42-1-550, which allows an injured worker to maintain a third party action â€œbefore an award is made,â€ nor Section 42-1-560, which preserves an injured employeeâ€™s right to pursue a third party claim while also seeking workersâ€™ compensation, can be read to constitute, under the doctrine of election of remedies, a bar to an employee subsequently proceeding against the carrier once the action at law is prosecuted to a final, but unsuccessful, determination where the injured employee gave the carrier proper notice of the third party action.\r\n\r\nId. at 40, 354 S.E.2d at 795 (emphasis added). \r\nÂ Hudson v. Townsend Saw Chain Co. illustrates the scope of the notice requirementâ€™s applicability. Â 296 S.C. 17, 21-22, 370 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Hudson prosecuted a third-party claim to its conclusion, without issuing the required statutory notice. Id. The single commissioner and Appellate Panel found Hudson had elected her remedy and her workersâ€™ compensation claim was barred. Id. at 19, 370 S.E.2d at 105. The circuit court reversed, deeming the section 42-1-560(b) notice requirement inapplicable where an employee prosecutes the third-party claim to a final determination before filing for workersâ€™ compensation. The circuit court viewed section 42-1-560â€™s notice requirement applicable only to the situation in which an employee pursues a workersâ€™ compensation claim simultaneously with a third-party action. Â Id. at 19, 370 S.E.2d at 105-06.Â  In reversing the circuit court, we clarified:Â  \r\n\r\n[I]rrespective of whether an employee pursues a third-party action before or simultaneously with filing a workersâ€™ compensation claim, the employee, to preserve his or her claim to workersâ€™ compensation, must provide the notice required by Section 42-1-560(b). If the employee fails to give the notice required by Section 42-1-560(b) and prosecutes the third-party action to a final determination, either before or simultaneously with filing a workersâ€™ compensation claim, the employee will be regarded as having elected his or her remedy and will be barred from receiving workersâ€™ compensation benefits.\r\n\r\nId. at 20-21, 370 S.E.2d at 106.\r\nThe undisputed facts of the instant case are nearly identical to those in Fisher.Â  Kimmer instituted his third party claim against a tortfeasor without notice to Murata.Â  Subsequently, he settled with the liability carrier and released the at-fault driver from all claims without Murataâ€™s consent. Â South Carolina appellate courts have conclusively held a claimant who pursues a third party action without giving proper notice to the employer-carrier and settles the third party action or pursues it to an unsuccessful conclusion is regarded as having elected his remedy and is barred from receiving workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order, which awards Kimmer workersâ€™ compensation benefits, notwithstanding his failure to give the required notice to Murata, is inconsistent with our precedent.Â  As a result of Kimmerâ€™s noncompliance with the statutory procedure, he made an election of his remedy and waived any rights he may have had to recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits.\r\nII.Â  Prejudice\r\nMurata maintains the circuit court erred in determining Kimmerâ€™s failure to give timely notice of his third party claim did not prejudice Murata, and, consequently, did not bar Kimmerâ€™s recovery of workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  We agree with Murata.Â  \r\nContrary to Kimmerâ€™s suggestion, the mere mention of the word â€œprejudiceâ€ in an opinion does not mean that such a requirement exists. Neither section 42-1-550 nor section 42-1-560 contains a provision establishing prejudice as a factor in considering whether a compensation claim is barred when an employee settles or concludes a third party claim without notice. Â Moreover, our precedentâ€™s strong and unwavering emphasis on the importance of notice outweighs the relevance of prejudice in considering whether a workerâ€™s compensation claim is barred.Â  See Fisher v. S. C. Depâ€™t of Mental Retardation-Coastal Center, 277 S.C. 573, 291 S.E.2d 200 (1982); Talley v. John-Mansville Sales Corp., 285 S.C. 117, 328 S.E.2d 621, (1985); Johnson v. Pennsylvania Millers Mut. Ins. Co., 292 S.C. 33, 354 S.E.2d 791 (Ct. App. 1987); Hudson v. Townsend Saw Chain Co., 296 S.C. 17, 370 S.E.2d 104 (Ct. App. 1988). The Fisher court interpreted the implicated statutes but made no mention of a prejudice requirement. 277 S.C. at 573, 291 S.E.2d at 200. Â In Hudson, the claimant urged that a workersâ€™ compensation claim should be permitted if the carrier was not prejudiced by the lack of notice.Â  Hudson at 22, 370 S.E.2d at 107.Â  We declared: â€œHudsonâ€™s contention and the circuit courtâ€™s holding regarding lack of prejudice, however, is unpersuasive, if in fact the question of prejudice is relevant at all.â€ Â Id.; see Stroy v. Millwood Drug Store, Inc., 235 S.C. 52, ___, 109 S.E.2d 706, 709 (1959) (rejecting an almost identical argument made by a workersâ€™ compensation claimant in a case decided under former statutes).Â  Additionally, in Talley, our Supreme Court declined to carve out an exception to the statutes as interpreted by Fisher, regarding any such change as a function of the legislature, not the courts. \r\nAs a result of the failure to notify of a third party claim, the employer-carrier loses a voice in the litigation and is clearly prejudiced. Â Stroy, 235 S.C. 52, 109 S.E.2d at 709.[1] That voice encompasses the right to select oneâ€™s own counsel, conduct oneâ€™s own investigation, and direct the litigation. Â See id. Â Notice makes it possible for the employer-carrier to offer the employee meaningful assistance in prosecuting the third party claim. Â Hudson, 296 S.C. at 22, 370 S.E.2d at 107.Â  With timely knowledge the employer-carrier gains the opportunity to lend support to an effort that could lead to the carrierâ€™s recovery of some or all of the compensation it might later be required to pay the injured employee under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. Id.; see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560 (c).Â  The statuteâ€™s underlying purpose serves to protect the carrierâ€™s subrogation interests and prevents an employeeâ€™s double recovery.Â  Â \r\nHypothetically, if prejudice to the employer-carrier were required as an additional element to find the claimant elected his remedy, we identify prejudice to Murata in the instant case. \r\nThe single commissionerâ€™s findings comport with our determination:\r\n\r\n[T]he claimantâ€™s settling of this claim was prejudicial to the carrier since it [Murata] was not able to participate in the litigation or affect the full and final release executed by the claimant.Â  The carrier had no opportunity to investigate whether there was [sic] other assets or other coverage available to the claimant from the third party.\r\n\r\nKimmer avers his settlement for the liability policy limit is distinguishable from the â€œcompromiseâ€ settlement in Fisher because the at-fault party had no additional assets for Murata to pursue.Â  Though Kimmerâ€™s counsel determined the coverage under one liability policy and consulted Chester county records to discover any undisclosed assets, his investigation was by no means exhaustive.Â  In South Carolina, statutory provisions allow for the initiation and institution of supplementary proceedings.Â  Section 15-39-310 of the South Carolina Code (1976) provides: \r\n\r\n[T]he judgment creditor . . . is entitled to an order from a judge of the circuit court requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his property before such judge at a time and place specified in the order within the county to which the execution was issued.Â  \r\n\r\nAt the hearing in regard to a supplementary proceeding, a prospective debtor is required to answer under oath all queries as to real and personal property, including, but not limited to, policies of insurance, cash, jewelry, household furniture, and the entire spectrum and gamut of legal ownership possibilities.Â  Additionally, a judgment obtained against a motorist that is unpaid subjects the motorist to driverâ€™s license suspension pursuant to section 56-9-430 of the South Carolina Code (1976).Â  Murataâ€™s right to avail itself of the full range of investigatory opportunities was foreclosed by the absence of notice of the third party claim.Â  Furthermore, as part of the third party settlement, Kimmer released the at-fault driver from all liability, extinguishing any recourse Murata may have had in pursuing third party assets. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule that the settlement of a third party claim without notice to the employer and carrier bars a workersâ€™ compensation action.Â  We hold that prejudice is NOT an element to be considered in regard to the failure to give the mandated statutory notice.Â  Assumptively concluding that prejudice is a factor in the analysis, we conclude that there was actual prejudice in the case sub judice in regard to the employer and carrier. \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is reversed and the order of the Appellate Panel reinstated.[2]Â  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Though this case was decided under the former statute, its discussion on what constitutes prejudice is instructive.Â  \r\n[2] Because we reverse on the previous issue, we need not reach the additional issues.Â  See \r\nFutch v.

Garfinkel, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4188\r\nHeard December 5, 2006 â€“ Filed December 21, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMichael David Wood, Patricia Oâ€™Neill DeTreville, and James Michael DeTreville, all of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam J. Clifford, of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â In this domestic action, James Kelly Davis (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s (1) awarding Deborah Davis (Wife) Â Â alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees; and (2) finding Husband in contempt for failure to comply with the family courtâ€™s orders concerning the distribution of personal property, payment of Wifeâ€™s equitable share of the marital home, harassment, and communication with Wife about the childrenâ€™s issues.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife divorced on May 7, 2001 after almost twenty-one years of marriage.Â  The couple has three sons.\r\nWife is a college graduate.Â  At the time of the divorce she had worked in her fatherâ€™s insurance agency, primarily as the office manager, for approximately eleven years.Â  Father retired in December, 2001 and Wife began working as a library media specialist at a middle school for a yearly salary of $31,000. She anticipated a $2000 yearly salary increase upon completion of her masterâ€™s degree.Â  In addition, Wife intends to become certified by a national board, for which she expects a $7500 yearly increase in salary.Â  Her present income is supplemented with earnings from a part time job with Weight Watchers. \r\nWhen Father retired, Wifeâ€™s earnings from her work at Fatherâ€™s agency were near $85,000.Â  Wife testified her income was inflated as a result of the father-daughter relationship. Â She enjoyed a flexible work schedule and the use of a company car.Â  Father first mentioned his upcoming retirement in 1999, prior to Husband and Wifeâ€™s divorce. Â Husband and Wife planned for Fatherâ€™s impending retirement by starting a gift basket business called Baskets of Fun.Â  This venture was ultimately unsuccessful.Â Â  Â \r\nWife explained that jobs available to her in the insurance industry would require extended periods of travel and would start at a salary of approximately $40,000 per year.Â  She estimated her services while working in Fatherâ€™s business were worth $50,000 a year to a comparable insurance agency. Â Â \r\nHusband formerly worked at Forsburg Engineering, where he earned an annual salary of $75,000, plus bonuses that brought his total yearly earnings to approximately $100,000.Â  Prior to Fatherâ€™s retirement, Husband left Forsburg and began a land surveying business, Absolute Surveying, in which he currently holds a thirty-five percent interest. Â On his financial declaration he indicated an annual salary of $51,000.Â  In addition to his salary, Absolute Surveying provided Husband with a car, car insurance and maintenance, gas, health insurance, health club, cable, and credit cards.Â  The family court determined the value of those benefits amounted to $1100 monthly. Partnership distributions from Absolute averaged $1,333.33 per month.Â  Husband had other real estate partnership interests which he failed to include on his financial declaration.Â  Those interests yielded $35,000 from the sale of real property in 2002 and reflected an average of $10,000 equity in each of ten (10) condominiums. \r\nThe family court approved and adopted the partiesâ€™ agreement on â€œall issues arising from the marriage, save and except the issue of divorce,â€ in the March 12, 2001 divorce decree.Â  Terms of the agreement relevant to Husbandâ€™s appeal included a provision for joint legal custody of their three sons and the requirement that each party keep the other informed about matters concerning the children.Â  The litigants were restrained from harming, harassing, bothering or otherwise disturbing each other, whether at their respective residences, employment, or the like. Â The marital home would be the sole property of Husband and, for the purpose of equitable distribution, valued at $325,000. Â The home was to be refinanced to provide funds for Wifeâ€™s equitable share.Â  Husband was permitted to subtract from the $325,000 valuation of the home the first mortgage payoff, reasonably necessary closing costs, and the balance of Wifeâ€™s equity loan.Â  In addition, Husband was directed to pay Wife fifty percent of settlement proceeds from Forsberg Engineering no later than the refinance closing date. Wife was entitled to obtain from Husband certain items of personal property, and the parties were instructed to cooperate in the expeditious transfer of those items. Â The parties agreed to reserve the issue of alimony for a five year period, during which either party could assert a claim for alimony against the other.\r\nWife filed a complaint on December 10, 2001, and an amended complaint on February 19, 2002, seeking $1000 per month alimony.Â  During the pendency of this litigation Wife initiated a number of enforcement actions based on Husbandâ€™s non-compliance with the divorce decree. In its final ruling the family court awarded Wife $635 per month in alimony, adjusted to be retroactive from the date of the temporary hearing. Â In addition to noting its concern over the absence of Husbandâ€™s forthrightness regarding his income, the family court found Husband in contempt for failure to: (1) provide Wife with copies of family photographs, (2) pay Wife her equitable share of the marital home, (3) refrain from harassing Wife, and (4) Â Â communicate with Wife regarding issues with their children.Â  Wife was awarded attorneyâ€™s fees as well.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  Â However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002)); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Â Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (citing Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E. 2d 154, 157 (1996)). However, our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of the burden of convincing this court the family court committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. at 190, 612 S.E.2d at 711 (citing Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Agreement\r\nHusband argues the family court failed to effectuate the partiesâ€™ intention as found within the agreement with regard to the reservation of alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, the construction of a separation agreement is a matter of contract law. Â Estate of Revis by Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 477, 484 S.E.2d 112, 116 (Ct. App. 1997). â€œWhere an agreement is clear and capable of legal construction the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the parties as found within the agreement and give effect to them.â€ Â Bogan v. Bogan, 298 S.C. 139, 142, 378 S.E.2d 606, 608&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œIn the enforcement of an agreement, the court does not have the authority to modify terms that are clear and unambiguous on their face.â€ Â Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 621, 598 S.E.2d 310, 314&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œWhere an agreement has been merged into a courtâ€™s decree, the decree, to the extent possible, should be construed to effect the intent of both the judge and the parties.â€ Id. at 628, 598 S.E.2d at 318 (citing McDuffie v. McDuffie, 308 S.C. 401, 409, 418 S.E.2d 331, 336 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  â€œA court approved divorce settlement must be viewed in accordance with principles of equity and there is implied in every such agreement a requirement of reasonableness.â€ Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 340, 465 S.E.2d 121, 126 (Ct. App. 1995) (quoting 17A Am Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 479 (1991)).\r\n\r\n  Unambiguous marital agreements will be enforced according to their terms . . . . The court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully. To discover the intention of a contract, the court must first look to its languageâ€”if the language is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, it alone determines the documentâ€™s force and effect.\r\n\r\nHeins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997); Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 465 S.E.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1995); Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 449 S.E.2d 487 (1994); Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 199 S.E.2d 719 (1973).\r\nOn the other hand, when an agreement is susceptible of more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous and the court should seek to determine the intent of the parties. Â Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at 477, 484 S.E.2d at 116.Â  Whether or not an ambiguity exists in an agreement must be determined from the language of the instrument. Â Steffenson v. Olsen, 360 S.C. 318, 322, 600 S.E.2d 129, 131 (Ct. App. 2004); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAn ambiguous contract is one capable of being understood in more ways than one, an agreement obscure in meaning through indefiniteness of expression, or having a double meaning.â€Â  Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at 477, 484 S.E.2d at 116 (quoting Ebert, 320 S.C. at 338, 465 S.E.2d at 125). Â \r\nThe exact language of the agreement adopted in the divorce decree reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe parties agree to reserve the issue of alimony, each from the other, for a period of 5 years from the date of this hearing.Â  During this 5-year period, either party may elect to assert a claim for alimony.Â  If such a claim is not asserted during this 5-year period, such claim is extinguished when the 5-year period has ended. \r\n\r\nA reservation of alimony is recognized as a mechanism to address a set of circumstances that may generate a need for alimony in the future.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 363, 384 S.E.2d 741, 747 (1989).Â  Here, implicit in the partiesâ€™ agreement is their intention to prepare for unforeseen circumstances which might generate a future need for alimony by either party.Â  The only contingency established by the plain language of the agreement mandates the claim be asserted within a five year period following the decree.Â  Husbandâ€™s argument that the agreement is not clear and capable of legal construction is unpersuasive.Â  Contrary to his contention, nothing in the agreement suggests the parties intended to express or imply additional conditions under which alimony may be sought.Â  The terms of the agreement are clear and unambiguous on its face.Â  Moreover, Husbandâ€™s suggestion the agreement failed for lack of â€œspecificsâ€ to assist the court in the propriety of an alimony claim is without merit.Â  Section 20-3-130 of the South Carolina Code provides the family court with the appropriate guidelines for adjudicating such claims. \r\nHusband next complains the family court improperly reserved jurisdiction to award alimony because an identifiable set of circumstances likely to generate a need for alimony in the reasonably foreseeable future did not exist at the time of the decree. Â We disagree.\r\nIn Donahue our Supreme Court announced that where â€œthere is no need for alimony at the time of trial, and no indication of physical or mental illness, foreseeable change in need in the future, or some other extenuating circumstance, the question of alimony should not be reserved.â€Â  299 S.C. at 363, 384 S.E.2d at 747.Â  Most frequently our appellate courts have condoned the reservation of alimony when the potential for the occurrence or recurrence of a physical or mental disability existed.Â  See, e.g., Williamson v. Williamson,Â  311 S.C. 47, 50, 426 S.E.2d 758, 760 (1993) (wife had epilepsy since birth and serious problems developed in 1989; the condition could deteriorate in the future); Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988) (although the court properly denied alimony under the circumstances existing at the time of decree, husbandâ€™s pre-existing disability entitled him to reservation of alimony); Lowe v. Lowe, 256 S.C. 243, 248, 182 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1971) (wifeâ€™s past emotional problems, which occurred during the course of the marriage, might recur to the point where she would be entitled to alimony).Â  In contrast, this court decided the family court erred in reserving alimony when no indication of a foreseeable need in the future existed.Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In Hardy, the wife was in good health, drawing a pension from the state, and was working part-time.Â  \r\n Donahue nevertheless endorses the reservation of alimony where some foreseeable future need or other extenuating circumstance exists.Â  299 S.C. at 363, 384 S.E.2d at 747. Â In the instant case the parties implicitly recognized that Fatherâ€™s impending retirement was likely to generate a need for alimony in the reasonably foreseeable future.Â  Wife testified her income from employment in Fatherâ€™s business exceeded her earning capacity because of the father-daughter relationship.Â  Perhaps anticipating an income more in line with her earning capacity, the parties agreed to reserve an opportunity for re-evaluating their respective needs for a period of time after the divorce. \r\nFurthermore, the reservation of alimony in this case was accomplished pursuant to the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  In the pivotal case of Â Moseley v. Mosier, our Supreme Court declared parties to a divorce â€œmay agree to any terms they wish as long as the court deems the contract to have been entered fairly, voluntarily and reasonably.â€ Â 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983).\r\n\r\nThe parties may specifically agree that the amount of alimony may not ever be modified by the court; they may contract out of any continuing judicial supervision of their relationship by the court; they may agree that the periodic payments or alimony stated in the agreement shall be judicially awarded, enforceable by contempt, but not modifiable by the court . . . . With the courtâ€™s approval, the terms become a part of the decree and are binding on the parties and the court.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nSection 20-3-130(G) of the South Carolina Code instructs that the family court may: \r\n\r\nreview and approve all agreements which bear on the issue of alimony or separate maintenance and support, whether brought before the court in actions for divorce from the bonds of matrimony, separate maintenance and support actions, or in actions to approve agreement where the parties are living separate and apart. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2003). \r\nThe family court, in issuing the divorce decree, stated â€œthe parties have expressed their desire that their agreement be approved by this Court as being fair and equitable, and that the agreement be adopted by this Court as its own Order.â€Â Â  The decree further noted that both parties had been examined under oath as to matters related to the agreement.Â  The litigants understood the agreement and professed it was the product of negotiation and compromise, each confirming that it was fair and equitable. \r\n\r\n  Neither party entered into the agreement as a result of any threat, coercion or duress; rather each party entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily; . . . the [a]greement set forth . . . was entered into knowingly and intelligently by both parties, each having full understanding and appreciation of the consequences of their actions.Â \r\n\r\nThe family court concluded the agreement was â€œclearly within the bounds of reasonableness, and is fair and equitable to both parties . . . .â€ \r\nAccording to the plain and unambiguous language of the partiesâ€™ agreement reserving the issue of alimony, the family court did not fail to effectuate the intention of the parties. Â The divorce decree was filed on May 9, 2001, and Wife filed an amended complaint in February of 2002, well within the five year period provided in the divorce decree.Â  The family court did not err by considering Wifeâ€™s asserted claim for alimony.\r\nII.Â  Alimony\r\nHusband maintains Wife is not entitled to alimony because she intentionally sought and accepted employment below her earning history and potential.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002); Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, 535 S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000); Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 364, 489 S.E.2d 212, 215 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€ Â Spence v. Spence, 260 S.C. 526, 529, 197 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1973) (quoting Â McNaughton v. McNaughton, 258 S.C. 554, 558, 189 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1972)); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œGenerally, alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001). Â However, â€œ[a]limony should not dissuade a spouse, to the extent possible, from becoming self-supporting.â€ Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 525, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIt is the duty of the family court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well founded.â€ Â Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424 (citing Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 1987)). \r\nSouth Carolina law provides that the family court judge may grant alimony in such amounts and for such term as the judge considers appropriate under the circumstances.Â  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 462, 486 S.E.2d 516, 523 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Factors to be considered in making an alimony award include: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2003); Hatfield, 327 S.C. at 364, 489 S.E.2d at 215. The court is required to consider all relevant factors in determining alimony.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 290, 555 S.E.2d 386, 391 (2001) (finding the trial courtâ€™s denial of alimony was erroneous because the court did not address â€œseveral important factorsâ€ when determining no alimony should be awarded).Â  â€œOur inquiry on appeal is not whether the family court gave the same weight to particular factors as this court would have; rather, our inquiry extends only to whether the family court abused its considerable discretion in assigning weight to the applicable factors.â€Â  Allen, 347 S.C. at 186, 554 S.E.2d at 425.Â  Ultimately, no one factor is dispositive.Â  Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).\r\nThe record reflects that the family court considered the relevant statutory factors.Â  However, Wifeâ€™s earning history and potential are at the heart of the partiesâ€™ dispute over alimony.Â  Prior to Fatherâ€™s retirement Wife earned nearly $85,000 annually, but attributed her high salary to the â€œDaddyâ€ factor.Â  The family court acknowledged this employer-employee relationship was â€œclearly less than an armâ€™s length transaction.â€Â  Husband averred Wife could earn between $40,000 - $45,000 in the insurance industry.Â  Instead, Wife returned to work in education at a significantly reduced salary of $31,000, plus health, disability, and retirement benefits. In addition, she began studying for her masterâ€™s degree. Wife maintained that, taking state benefits into account, upon completion of her graduate degree her earnings would be roughly equivalent to those in the insurance industry.Â  The family court found:\r\n\r\n[Wifeâ€™s] future earnings are relatively predictable as she progresses through her educational process and employment in the field of education.Â  Her gross income will lie between thirty-five thousand ($35,000) and forty thousand ($40,000) dollars when she completes her masters degree and begins being paid at that level.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe evidence indicates Wifeâ€™s salary near the end of her employment with Father was not an accurate predictor of her earning potential, either in the education or insurance industry.Â  We discern no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s award of alimony. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Contempt\r\nHusband challenges the family courtâ€™s finding him in contempt for violation of the divorce decree and subsequent court orders. Â He contends the evidence failed to demonstrate his conduct was willful, voluntary, and intentional.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€ Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 263, 621 S.E.2d 389, 392 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal, a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if it is without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.â€Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840&nbsp;(1988) (citations omitted); Lukich v. Lukich, 368 S.C. 47, 56, 627 S.E.2d 754, 759 (Ct. App. 2006). â€œContempt results from the willful disobedience of an order of the court.â€ Bigham v. Bigham, 264 S.C. 101, 104, 212 S.E.2d 594, 596&nbsp;(1975); Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2004) (A party may be found in contempt of court for the willful violation of a lawful court order.).\r\nÂ â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™ â€ Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)). \r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€ Â Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Â Widman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705. Â â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€ Â Id. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€ Â Henderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€ Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWife initiated actions during the pendency of this litigation to enforce Husbandâ€™s compliance with family courtâ€™s orders to: (1) distribute certain family photographs or duplicates in a quality equal to the originals; (2) pay Wifeâ€™s share of the equity in the marital home; (3) refrain from harassing Wife and (4) communicate with Wife concerning childrenâ€™s issues.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Photographs\r\nAt trial Husband testified that he provided Wife with a compact disc of photographs, and Wife objected to the format rather than the quality of the photographs.Â  Husband delivered actual photographs to Wife as well.Â  In his testimony he acknowledged differences between the originals and those he tendered to Wife.Â  When asked if he were willing to have exact reproductions from the negatives made by the original photographer in order to discharge the enforcement action, Husband responded:Â  \r\n\r\nI donâ€™t care to buy photographs for my ex-wife.Â  Iâ€™ll do what Iâ€™m told to do.Â  I provided, according to the order, equivalent, equalâ€”in fact she was able to get them on high quality CD disks.Â  Thatâ€™s the way they provide them now to anybody.Â  She canâ€”actually with the CD I gave her, she can have the pictures made in large sizes, eight and a half by eleven or whatever size you want.Â  Thatâ€™s how good a quality they were scanned at.\r\n\r\nIn its final order dated filed June 12, 2003, the family court found, â€œ[n]otwithstanding the prior contempt Â proceeding and resulting order by the Presiding Judge to provide the [Wife] the original photographs or duplicate originals from the original negatives, the [Husband] once again gave the [Wife] a compact disc with inferior reproductions.â€Â  Consequently, Husband was held in contempt and advised he could purge the charge by turning the original photographs over to Wife within three days of the order. Â A modified final order filed on July 12, 2004 noted that Husband again gave Wife a compact disc instead of the original photographs or duplicates from the original negatives.Â  Subsequently, the family court held Husband in contempt for failure to comply with its June 12, 2003 order. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Equity in Marital Home\r\nWife complains the closing costs charged against her equitable interest in the marital home were inflated, unfair, and unreasonable, and Husband failed to distribute the equity in the home in accordance with the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â Â  The pertinent portion of the divorce decree reads:\r\n\r\nThe equity in the home is subject to division between the parties as follows:Â  [Husband] shall be permitted to subtract from the $325,000 valuation of the home the first mortgage payoff, as well as reasonable and necessary closing costs of refinance and the cost of the equity line taken by Mother.Â  The resulting figure shall be deemed the â€œnet equityâ€ and shall be divided equally between the parties, with the exception that the $30,000 second mortgage/equity line shall be deducted from [Wifeâ€™s] 50% share and reimbursed to [Husband]. The terms and details of refinancing the home shall be at the sole election and responsibility of [Husband].\r\n\r\n(Emphasis in original).\r\nHusband referred the closing of the refinancing loan to attorney Eric Davidson, a boyhood friend and partner in Husbandâ€™s surveying and real estate businesses.Â  Davidson had previously acted on the partiesâ€™ behalf in earlier closings, but never charged them closing fees.Â  However, Davidson charged the parties a total of $975 in attorneyâ€™s fees for closing the refinancing of the marital home following the divorce.Â  Additional costs included a survey performed by Husbandâ€™s company, Absolute Surveying, for $350, with the total closing costs amounting to over $10,000. Â Davidsonâ€™s records reflected that he issued a check to Husband refunding Husbandâ€™s portion of the fees.Â  The family court observed â€œ[i]t appears that this attorney directed material changes to be made to the closing statement used at the refinance of the marital home and these changes resulted in this attorney refunding money only to the [Husband] when, in fact, one half of this money was due to the [Wife].â€ Â The family court further enumerated closing costs not fairly charged to Wife â€œas they inured exclusively to the benefit of [Husband].â€ Â Accordingly, after the family courtâ€™s analysis, $6,839.25 was considered a fair and reasonable charge for the closing costs.Â  \r\nDavidson calculated Wifeâ€™s share of the home equity by deducting the closing costs, the first mortgage, and the balance on the home equity loan that Wife had used from the stipulated value of the home ($325,000).Â  The resulting net equity was divided in half and Wifeâ€™s share was again reduced by $30,000 for the home equity loan.Â  When challenged at trial that his calculation resulted in deducting the equity loan twice, Davidson stated this procedure reflected his interpretation of the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  Accordingly, the family court instructed the parties to submit post trial briefs on the method of calculating Wifeâ€™s equitable share.Â  The family court adopted Wifeâ€™s analysis, which reflected only one deduction of the equity loan from her share of the net equity.Â  The June 12, 2003 final order directed Husband to pay Wife the balance owed her as a result of the re-calculation, $20,689.19.Â  At the time the modified final order was issued in July, 2004, Husband had not paid Wife the balance of her equitable share, and the family court found Husband in contempt.Â  \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Harassment\r\nThe divorce decree provided that â€œboth parents will be restrained from harming, harassing, bothering or otherwise disturbing each other, whether at their respective places of residence, employment or the like.â€Â  \r\nWife submitted evidence of incidents during which Husband harassed her by threatening to publish embarrassing photographs of her, by discussing her personal life with the minor children, and by making harassing phone calls. Â Additionally, testimony indicated Husband and their youngest son went to Wifeâ€™s home late one evening when Wifeâ€™s boyfriend was present.Â  Husband later accused Wife of exposing the child to immoral behavior.Â  Wife recounted another incident that arose when Husband returned personal property to her in the parking lot of her church, causing a disturbance by shouting obscenities at her in the presence their youngest son. \r\nIn its final and modified final orders, the family court found Husbandâ€™s actions â€œconstituted harassment in violation of the Courtâ€™s prior order.â€Â  \r\nD. Â Â Â Â  Communication\r\nPursuant to the divorce decree, the parties were required to keep each other informed about matters concerning the children and to consult with each other on matters which pertained to the childrenâ€™s interests.Â  The family court noted, however, that Husband admitted two incidents when the children were involved with law enforcement.Â  Despite repeated requests, Husband would not disclose the charges or degree of involvement to Wife.Â  \r\nIn each of the four instances of alleged contemptuous conduct, the existence of the divorce decree and subsequent orders of the family court requiring Husbandâ€™s compliance is without dispute.Â  Testimony at trial and supporting affidavits provide further evidentiary support that Husband failed to accomplish what the law required of him.Â  Furthermore, by the time the modified final order was issued in July, 2004, nearly one year after the family courtâ€™s final order, Husband still had not paid Wife the balance of her equity in the marital home or provided her with required photographs.Â  Husbandâ€™s failure to comply with all the family courtâ€™s directives indicates his conduct was willful, voluntary, and intentional.Â  His defense amounts to a general denial that any evidence existed of wrongdoing concerning the photographs, harassment, and communication charges.Â  Husband professes he neither intentionally nor voluntarily inflated the closing costs charged against Wifeâ€™s interest or miscalculated her equitable share of the marital home.Â  He asseverates that, because he referred the entire transaction to the closing attorney, Husband was not responsible for the inequitable result. Additionally, Husband urges the closing attorneyâ€™s calculation of Wifeâ€™s equitable share was a reasonable interpretation of the language of the divorce decree and does not rise to the level of willful disobedience.Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s protestations are unavailing. The family court adopted Wifeâ€™s method for calculating her equitable share after being briefed by both partiesâ€™ on their respective interpretations.Â  Furthermore, because the partiesâ€™ agreement was adopted and incorporated into the divorce decree in its entirety, it was incumbent on the family court to effectuate not only the intention of the parties, but the intention of the presiding family court judge who issued the decree. Â See Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 628, 598 S.E.2d 310, 318 (Ct. App. 2004) (agreement adopted as divorce decree should be construed to effect intent of both judge and parties).Â  Apodictically, it strains credulity to infer the presiding judge intended for Wifeâ€™s equity loan to be deducted from her share in the net equity twice. \r\nWe conclude ample evidence existed to support the family courtâ€™s contempt findings on all four issues. Â Â Â Â  \r\nIV.Â  Sidebar Conference\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred by referencing a sidebar conference in its final and modified final order.Â  We agree.\r\nSidebar conferences without the presence of a court stenographer, must be reiterated for the record. North Charleston v. Gilliam, 311 S.C. 252, 254, 428 S.E.2d 720, 721&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nThe modified final order addresses the sidebar solely in part seven (7) of the Alimony section.Â  The order states:\r\n\r\nIt is noted that the Court expressed its concern in a side bar conference which is not referenced about [Husband] lying to the Court in an attempt to make it appear that he had far less income and benefits available to him than he actually had.Â  The Court advised counsel that this matter, in all likelihood, would be referred to the Solicitor to determine if a charge of perjury was warranted.Â  It was only then that the [Husband] submitted an amended financial declaration.\r\n\r\nThe sidebar conference referred to by the family court was not reiterated for the record.Â  However, the erroneous mention of the sidebar does not amount to reversible error.Â  â€œAn error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.â€ Â Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAn error is not reversible unless it is material and prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant.â€Â  Visual Graphics Leasing Corp., Inc. v. Lucia, 311 S.C. 484, 489, 429 S.E.2d 839, 841&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nWe caution the Bench in regard to the utilitarian efficacy of a sidebar conference.Â  An objection made during an off-the-record conference which is not made part of the record does not preserve the question for review. Â York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C.170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997); Benton v. Davis, 248 S.C. 402, 410, 150 S.E.2d 235, 239 (1996); State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C.221, 250, 609 S.E.2d 572, 587 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, it is sufficient if the party puts the grounds or arguments and the trial judgeâ€™s ruling in the record at a later time during the trial. Â See State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 361, 543 S.E.2d 586, 595 (Ct. App. 2001) overruled on other grounds State v. Gentry,Â  363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005); State v. Bostick, 307 S.C. 226, 288, 414 S.E.2d 175, 176 n. 1 (Ct. App. 1992);Â  see also City of North Charleston v. Gilliam, 311 S.C. at 254, 428 S.E.2d at 721 (rulings made buy trial judge at sidebar conferences without presence of court reporter may still be preserved for appellate review if they are reiterated for the record when the case is called for trial or trail resumes).\r\nIn this case, the family courtâ€™s error concerned extrinsic material and did not affect the courtâ€™s actual ruling.Â  The error is without prejudicial effect and, therefore, harmless.Â  \r\nV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband alleges the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe Family Court is authorized by statute to order payment of suit money, including attorney[â€™s] fees, to either party in a divorce action.â€Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903&nbsp;(1988).Â  Section 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2005) of the South Carolina Code provides: â€œ[s]uit money, including attorneyâ€™s fees, may be assessed for or against a party to an action brought in or subject to the jurisdiction of the family court.â€\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 553, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004); Bowen v Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272, (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court, in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standards of living. Â E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the family court must take into account the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. Â Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991); Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 222, 612 S.E.2d 456, 461-62&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005); see alsoÂ  Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 633, 598 S.E.2d 310, 320 (Ct. App. 2004) (refusing to find an abuse of discretion as to award of attorneyâ€™s fees when the family court analyzed each of the factors, detailed its findings in its final order, and those findings were supported by affidavits). \r\nApplying the Glasscock factors, the family court noted this litigation involved multiple issues, lasted five days, and transpired over a three month period.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney has been a member of the South Carolina Bar since 1978, his fees were consistent with legal fees for similar services, and Wife obtained a beneficial result. Moreover, Wifeâ€™s financial circumstances necessitated an award of attorneyâ€™s fees. The family court evaluated the reasonableness of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, her attorneyâ€™s extensive experience and standing in the Bar, and the number of hours involved in this litigation against the backdrop of Husbandâ€™s failure to comply with the provisions of the divorce decree and his failure to accurately report income in his financial declaration. We, therefore, affirm the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4189","title":"State v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  A Lexington County jury convicted Theresa Claypoole (Claypoole) of contributing to the delinquency of a minor andÂ  accessory before the fact to criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Claypoole appeals her conviction of accessory before the fact, claiming the trial court should have directed a verdict in her favor due to insufficient evidence.Â  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS&nbsp;\r\nBeginning in 1999, Kermit Claypoole (Kermit) resided with Claypoole and her two daughters from a previous marriage, K.H. and E.H. Â During this time, Kermit engaged in conversations with the two daughters that were sexual in nature.Â  E.H., Claypooleâ€™s older daughter, testified that Kermit would ask the girls if they wanted to have â€œfunâ€ with him, while rubbing E.H.â€™s arm in â€œa sexual sense.â€Â  Both K.H. and E.H. admitted they told their mother of Kermitâ€™s actions with Claypooleâ€™s reassurance that she would talk with Kermit about his behavior.\r\nShortly thereafter, the girls told their biological father about Kermitâ€™s advances.Â  Based on this information and Kermitâ€™s previous conviction of two counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor, the court granted the biological father sole custody of the girls; however, by September of 2001, they again resided with their mother and Kermit in South Carolina.Â  \r\nOver the next several months, Claypoole often left the girls alone with Kermit, despite her knowledge that Kermit was a registered sex offender and that a court order prohibited any contact between him and the girls.Â  During Claypooleâ€™s absence, Kermit re-initiated conversations with E.H. and K.H. about sex.Â  Once again, Claypoole reassured E.H. that she would talk to Kermit about his inappropriate interactions with the girls; however, E.H.â€™s journal entries indicate Claypoole took no action.Â  She wrote, â€œHey, last night I heard the worst thing, the sound of my little sis f[â€¦]ing.Â  [M]om is not afraid of [K.H.] getting knocked up.Â  Now that is whack[1].â€ Â While E.H. did not engage in any sexual acts with Kermit, her younger sister, K.H., admitted to having sex with Kermit, which resulted in her pregnancy.Â  \r\nK.H. also acknowledged that Kermit told her mother about the sexual relationship, and her mother then told K.H. to have sex with Kermit as long as it felt good.Â  Regarding the propriety of Claypooleâ€™s forty-nine-year-old husband sleeping with her thirteen-year-old daughter, Claypoole stated she did not know why everyone made such a big deal out of them having sex because in West Virginia, where she was raised, the older men often taught young girls about sex to prepare them for their wedding nights. \r\nAfter the Stateâ€™s presentation of evidence, Claypoole moved for a directed verdict as to the accessory before the fact charge.Â  Claypoole renewed this motion after the close of evidence, and the court again denied this motion.Â  The jury found Claypoole guilty of accessory before the fact to criminal sexual conduct with a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  The trial court sentenced Claypoole to concurrent terms of ten years for accessory before the fact and three years for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, all terms suspended to five-years probation.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Claypoole argues the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict for the charge of accessory before the fact as the evidence offered by the State was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the juryâ€™s conviction.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.â€Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  Furthermore, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict at the trial level when the State does not produce evidence of the offense charged; however, if the State presents any evidence at trial which reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt, the case must go to the jury.Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 103, 610 S.E.2d 494, 500 (2005); State v. Ezell, 321 S.C. 421, 424, 468 S.E.2d 679, 680 (Ct. App. 1996) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn deciding whether the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of a defendant in a criminal case, the appellate court must view the testimony in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Massey, 267 S.C. 432, 442, 229 S.E.2d 332, 337 (1976).Â  If there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced, the case should be submitted to the jury.Â  Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 189, 607 S.E.2d 82, 85 (2005).\r\nClaypoole argues the State failed to establish the requisite elements of accessory before the fact to criminal sexual conduct to justify her conviction.Â  Criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree is defined as â€œsexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years of age.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(2) (1984) (current version at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(B) (2005)).[2]Â  The State must prove: (1) the accused advised and agreed, urged, or in some way aided some other person to commit the offense; (2) the accused was not present when the offense was committed; and (3) some principal committed the offense.Â  State v. Farne, 190 S.C. 75, 84, 1 S.E.2d 912, 915-16 (1939). \r\nNeither party presented evidence that Claypoole was present when the sexual misconduct occurred. Â The uncontroverted testimony establishes that the principal, Kermit, committed the substantive offense of criminal sexual misconduct.Â  Consequently, for Claypoole to be an accessory before the fact, she must have advised, agreed, urged or in some way aided Kermit to commit criminal sexual misconduct against K.H. \r\nWhile Claypoole admits she was negligent in â€œfoolishly fail[ing] to pick up on her childrenâ€™s hints at improper conduct,â€ she argues the State presented no evidence that she either knew about the conduct or actively aided Kermit in his actions.Â  We find this argument to be without merit.Â Â  \r\nOur sister state of North Carolina has dealt with a similar issue in State v. Walden, 306 N.C. 466, 293 S.E.2d 780 (1982).Â  In that case, the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the trial courtâ€™s conviction of a mother for aiding and abetting an assault with a deadly weapon by another person against her child when the mother permitted another person to severely beat her son in the motherâ€™s presence.Â  Id.\r\nIn general, North Carolina law on aiding and abetting requires a person to say or do something to demonstrate consent to a felonious purpose and to contribute to the execution of a crime. [3] Â  Id. at 476, 293 S.E.2d at 787.Â  The court in Walden recognized a person is under no general duty to prevent the commission of a crime solely because that person is present; however, the court also acknowledged the nature of the parent-child relationship places a legal duty upon the parent to take all reasonable steps to protect the child from harm.Â  Id. at 472, 293 S.E.2d at 784; Id. at 475, 293 S.E.2d at 786.Â  Thus, a parentâ€™s failure â€œto take all steps reasonably possible to protect the parentâ€™s child from an attack by another person constitutes an act of omission by the parent showing the parentâ€™s consent and contribution to the crime being committed.â€Â  Id. at 476, 293 S.E.2d at 787.Â  \r\nLike the mother in Walden, Claypoole was aware that her child was at risk of suffering injury at the hands of another, and she was in a position to prevent the offense against her child. Â Unlike the mother in Walden, Claypoole was not present when the substantive offenses against K.H. were committed. Â However, this Court finds the North Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s reasoning in Walden persuasive and instructive in deciding this matter. \r\nThe State presented sufficient evidence that Claypoole aided and encouraged Kermit in committing criminal sexual conduct against K.H.Â  In 1999 and 2001, E.H. told her mother about Kermitâ€™s inappropriate comments and invitations to have â€œfun,â€ and Claypoole promised to talk with Kermit.Â  K.H. testified that her mother knew about Kermitâ€™s sexual innuendos as well as her sexual relationship with Kermit.Â  When Kermit told Claypoole about the sex, and Claypoole subsequently told K.H. it was all right as long as it felt good, [4] Claypoole was no longer a passive party.Â  Her approval, conveyed to both K.H. and Kermit, effectively aided and encouraged Kermit in his actions against K.H.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Claypoole allowed Kermit to reside in the same house with the girls, thus aiding him in the commission of these acts.Â  She was fully aware a court order prohibited any contact between Kermit and the girls, but she did nothing to prevent the situation.Â  In addition, when Claypoole learned Kermit was having sex with K.H., she continued to aid Kermit by her failure to stop him from having sex with K.H.Â  E.H.â€™s journal entries reveal that Claypoole agreed to this conduct by ignoring E.H.â€™s complaints and appearing to be unconcerned with the prospect of K.H. becoming pregnant.Â  Finally, Claypoole showed her approval and apparent lack of concern for Kermitâ€™s actions by telling her neighbor that she did not understand why everyone was so concerned with Kermit and K.H. having sex.Â  According to the neighborâ€™s testimony, Claypoole stated that permitting older men to have sex with young girls was a good way to teach them about sex.Â  \r\nClaypooleâ€™s consistent failure to prevent this misconduct or otherwise protect K.H. and her decision to live with Kermit, despite the presence of her children, constituted consent and encouragement to the commission of this crime.Â  Given the foregoing, sufficient evidence exists to sustain Claypooleâ€™s conviction of accessory before the fact to criminal sexual conduct with a minor. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis Court is not concerned with the weight of evidence, only its existence. Â The State presented direct and substantial circumstantial evidence that Claypoole was an accessory before the fact to criminal sexual conduct; thus, we hold the trial court properly denied Claypooleâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] E.H.â€™s journal entry, which she read during her testimony, reflects her disdain over her motherâ€™s indifference towards Kermitâ€™s illicit relationship with K.H.Â  The court reporter, unfamiliar with the slang term â€œwack,â€ misquoted E.H.Â  The absence of â€œhâ€ in â€œwackâ€ differentiates it from â€œwhack,â€ which means â€œto strike with a smart or resounding blow.â€Â  See Merriam Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary 1344 (10th ed. 1993).Â  â€œWack,â€ as defined in the Urban Dictionary and used in this context, means â€œappalling.â€ Â See The Urban Dictionary 331 (2005). \r\n[2] Because Claypooleâ€™s misconduct occurred in 2001, the court cites to the 2001 version of S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-655 as amended. Â While the legislature has revised this section since 2001, it did not alter the substantive statutory language for criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree as applied to Claypoole.\r\n[3] In distinguishing the crime of accessory before the fact from aiding and abetting, the North Carolina Supreme Court stated: â€œThe distinction between the two . . . lies in the elements of presence or absence at the time the crime is being committed.Â  An accessory before the fact must be absent from the scene of the offense, while an aider and abettor must be actually or constructively present at the scene.â€Â  State v. Graham, 303 N.C. 521, 525, 279 S.E.2d 588, 591 (1981).Â  Similarly, to aid and abet in South Carolina, one must â€œ[help], assist, or facilitate the commission of [the] crime, promote the accomplishment thereof, help in advancing or bringing it about, or encourage, counsel, or incite [the] commission [of the crime].â€Â  State v. Smith, 359 S.C. 481, 491, 597 S.E.2d 888, 892 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 68 (6th ed. 1990)).Â  While the law distinguishes these two crimes based on oneâ€™s presence or lack thereof, the required substantive actions are virtually the same to render one guilty as an accessory or an aider and abettor.\r\n[4] Claypoole argues for the first time during oral argument that the circuit court improperly considered this statement.Â  She argues the court should not have used the stateâ€™s reply testimony in considering Claypooleâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  We reiterate that the court, in ruling on a directed verdict motion, can consider any evidence presented by the State, which tends to prove a defendantâ€™s guilt.

Wyndham, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â Â  Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order awarding wages, treble damages, and attorneyâ€™s fees to Richard Ross for Ligandâ€™s breach of an employment contract, violation of the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, and violation of public policy.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn October 1998, Ligand offered Ross a position as a Senior Oncology Specialist (SOS).Â  The offer provided a starting salary of $7,166.67 per month and participation â€œin the 1998 Sales Force Incentive Plan based upon achievement of pre-agreed impact goals and/or sales objectives.â€Â  The offer further provided that â€œ[a]ny additions or modifications to these terms would have to be in writing and signed by [Ross] and the Company President.â€Â  Ross accepted the offer and began work with Ligand on November 3, 1998.\r\nInitially, Ross did not participate in a sales incentive plan because Ligand did not have an approved product for distribution; instead, Ross participated in a Management by Objective Plan that presumably provided for incentives based on non-sales related criteria.Â  Sometime in 1999, Ligandâ€™s first product was approved.Â  Subsequently, Ross began participating in the 1999 Sales Force Incentive Compensation Plan (1999 Plan) that permitted him to earn up to thirty-five percent of his salary.Â  The 1999 Plan based compensation on a mathematical formula applied to sales each quarter.Â  Â Â \r\nThroughout his employment with Ligand, Ross participated in yearly compensation plans similar to the 1999 Plan.Â  In 2001, however, Ligand changed the plan to provide compensation based on trimester sales.Â  In addition, Ligand altered the compensation plan to provide:Â  â€œIn order to be eligible for the trimester incentive compensation payout, [an employee] must be employed at the time the trimester sales incentive compensation payouts are distributed.â€Â  These changes were included in the incentive plans for 2001, 2002, and 2003. Â Â \r\nIn April of 2002, Ligand promoted Ross to Regional Business Manager (RBM).Â  The promotion allowed Ross to participate in the Oncology Regional Business Managers Plan (RBM Plan).Â  The RBM Plan provides:Â  â€œThe Incentive Plan payout will be paid following the conclusion of each trimester period according to the following estimated schedule:Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Trimester 1\r\n        Payout&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       June 30, 2003\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Trimester 2\r\n        Payout&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       October 31, 2003\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Trimester 3\r\n        Payout&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       February 28, 2004.â€\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe â€œtarget datesâ€ for the RBM Plan mirrored the scheduled payout dates for the 2001 and 2002 incentive plans.Â  \r\nRoss resigned from Ligand on October 15, 2003.Â  Rossâ€™s resignation was effective forty-five days after August 31, 2003, the date the second trimester of 2003 ended.Â  Ligand distributed the payouts for the second trimester of 2003 sometime after November 15, 2003.Â  Ligand declined to pay Ross the incentive plan payout of $12,000 for the second trimester of 2003 because the RBM Plan required that a person must be employed by Ligand, in good standing, at the time the incentive compensation checks were distributed.\r\nThereafter, Ross filed an action against Ligand alleging the refusal to pay the incentive payout breached the employment agreement and violated the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.Â  The circuit court held the RBM Plan violated sections 41-10-30, 41-10-40, 41-10-50, and 41-10-100 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) and public policy. Â The court also held Ligand breached the employment agreement.Â  The circuit court awarded Ross $36,000 as treble damages pursuant to section 41-10-80 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), attorneyâ€™s fees totaling $18,000, and costs in the amount of $837.60.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Payment of Wages Act\r\nLigand argues the trial judge erred in finding Ligand violated sections 41-10-30 and 41-10-40 of the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 41-10-30 provides, in relevant part: \r\n\r\n(A) Every employer shall notify each employee in writing at the time of hiring of the normal hours and wages agreed upon, the time and place of payment, and the deductions which will be made from the wages, including payments to insurance programs. The employer has the option of giving written notification by posting the terms conspicuously at or near the place of work. Any changes in these terms must be made in writing at least seven calendar days before they become effective. This section does not apply to wage increases.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAt trial, Ligand argued the establishment of the â€œtarget datesâ€ in the RBM Plan sufficiently complied with the time and place of payment requirements of section 40-10-30.Â  The trial judge found Ligand violated section 41-10-30â€™s requirement to provide the date and place of payment because the estimated schedule and â€œtarget datesâ€ in the RBM Plan did not provide a time for payment as required by the Payment of Wages Act.Â Â  We find sufficient evidence supports this finding.Â  The RBM Plan provides incentive payouts will be paid according to an estimated schedule with payment on the â€œtarget date.â€Â  In addition, payouts are contingent upon an employee such as Ross being â€œemployed at the time the [payouts] are distributed.â€Â  Ligand admitted the employee must be employed on the date it ultimately issued the checks, not on the â€œtarget date.â€Â  Ligand testified:\r\n\r\nQ:Â  And as I understand your position, the policy of Ligand is in order to get your incentive compensation payment for a particular trimester, you had to be employed when Ligand wrote the check?\r\nA (Ligand):Â  That is correct.\r\nQ:Â  Which could have been on the target date, could have been later? \r\nA:Â  That is correct.\r\nQ:Â  It could have been whenever Ligand decided to write that check, correct?\r\nA:Â  Correct.\r\nQ:Â  And your position is that if you all decided not to write this check for a year and Mr. Ross was not present, then he would not be entitled to the $12,000?\r\nA:Â  That is correct.\r\n\r\nLigand added the estimated payment schedule serves â€œno purpose, whatsoever, other than guidance to the field.â€Â  Moreover, the record demonstrates Ligand frequently distributed incentive payout checks after the date listed in the estimated scheduleâ€”with four of the previous ten payments being distributed after the â€œtarget date.â€ \r\nWe agree with the trial judgeâ€™s determination that Ligand fails to satisfy the statutory requirements of section 40-10-30 because Ligand provided employees with no time certain for when payment would occur.Â  Ligand admitted the key to receiving the earned bonus was the date it arbitrarily selected for distribution of the checks not the â€œtarget datesâ€ from the estimated schedule provided to Ross.Â  Providing estimated payment dates that serve â€œno purpose whatsoeverâ€ and are dependent upon employees being employed at the time payouts are distributed, whenever that may be, clearly does not provide notice of â€œtime and date of payment.â€Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the RBM Plan violates section 41-10-30.\r\nLigand also relies on Rice v. Multimedia, Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 456 S.E.2d 381 (1995), in support of its argument that the RBM Plan complied with the time and place mandates of section 40-10-30.Â  In Rice, an employee sought payment for commissions due on advertising contracts under the Payment of Wages Act.Â  Id. at 95, 456 S.E.2d at 381.Â  The parties had a contract providing that sales commissions would be paid to a departing employee only for those advertisements sold by the employee and actually broadcast in the month in which the employee left the company.Â  Id. at 96, 456 S.E.2d at 382.Â  When the employer refused to pay certain commissions after Rice left the company, Rice sued arguing the departure policy was void as against public policy.Â  Id. at 100, 456 S.E.2d at 384.Â  The supreme court disagreed and found the agreement enforceable.Â  Id.Â  The court found the agreement was â€œnot arbitrary nor does it violate any law,â€ because the agreement was customary to the industry and provided a valid economic purposeâ€”â€œto ensure that the salesperson gives continuing service to the client after the sale[.]Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe find the factual scenario in this matter distinguishable from Rice for three reasons.Â  First, unlike the agreement in Rice which was challenged on the ground of public policy rather than because of any violation of the Payment of Wages Act, we have found Ligandâ€™s policy violated both sections 40-10-30 and 40-10-40 of the Act.Â  Second, the RBM Plan serves no legitimate purpose, whereas the policy in Rice had a clear, legitimate economic purpose; even Ligand admitted its policy serves â€œno purpose whatsoever.â€Â  And third, the Rice agreement was not arbitrary as it established, in clear terms, the time certain for payment of the commission.Â  In our case, the time for payment was entirely dependant upon Ligandâ€™s arbitrary decision of when to issue the commission check to Ross, whenever that date may be, and was not based on any economic reason.Â  In other words, the policy in Rice merely established the manner the company would pay admittedly owed commissions, whereas Ligand, under its policy, would not even admit the commissions were due to Ross unless he was employed by Ligand when it ultimately decided to pay them.Â  Therefore, Ligandâ€™s reliance on Rice is misplaced.\r\nLigand next contends the circuit court erred in finding Ligand violated section 41-10-40.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 41-10-40(D) provides â€œ[e]very employer in the State shall pay all wages due at the time and place designated as required by subsection (A) of Â§ 41-10-30.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-10-40(D) (Supp. 2005). Â The trial judge held Ligand violated this section because the company failed to provide Ross with the time that wages earned and due under the RBM Plan would be paid.Â  Evidence exists to support this finding.Â  \r\nLigand admitted the commissions Ross sought were from sales made during the final trimester in which he worked for the company, and that he was in good standing with Ligand when the trimester ended and when he resigned.Â  Additionally, at the conclusion of Rossâ€™ final trimester, there was noting more that he was required to do or participate in to determine the amount of compensation due under the RBM Plan.Â  The sole reason Ligand failed to pay the wages earned during Rossâ€™ final trimester was that Ross was not employed when it finally issued the compensation checks, which was several weeks after its own target date had passed.Â  Moreover, as discussed above, Ligandâ€™s policy failed to provide the time and place for payment of commissions earned under the RBM Plan; therefore, the failure to provide the time and place of payment prevented Ligand from being able to pay wages due to Ross at the time and place designated as mandated by section 40-10-40(D).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s finding that Ligand violated section 41-10-40.\r\nII.Â  Treble Damages and Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nLigand also contends the trial judge erred in awarding treble damages and attorneyâ€™s fees to Ross.Â  We disagree. \r\nWhen reviewing the award of treble damages, this court can take its own view of the facts. Â Oâ€™Neal v. Intermedical Hosp. of S.C., 355 S.C. 499, 509-10, 585 S.E.2d 526, 532 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing The Father v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 578 S.E.2d 11 (2003)). Generally, treble damages may be awarded when the withholding of wages was unreasonable and there was no good faith dispute.Â  Id.; see also Rice v. Multimedia, Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 98, 456 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1995).Â  \r\nAs our courts have stated: â€œIf there is a dispute over unpaid wages the employer\r\nacts at his peril and the court in its discretion may award treble damages when the withholding was unreasonable and there was no good faith wage dispute,â€ and that â€œthe legislature intended to punish the employer who forces the employee to resort to the court in an unreasonable or bad faith wage dispute.â€Â  Rice, 318 S.C. at 99, 456 S.E.2d at 383.Â  Section 41-10-80 provides for the trebling of damages for violation of the Payment of Wage Act:Â  \r\n\r\nIn case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee as required by\r\nSection 41-10-40 or 41-10-50 the employee may recover in a civil action an amount equal to three times the full amount of the unpaid wages, plus costs and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees as the court may allow. Any civil action for the recovery of wages must be commenced within three years after the wages become due.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-10-80(C) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nLigand admitted the key to receiving the earned bonus was the date Ligand arbitrarily selected for distribution of the checks not the â€œtarget datesâ€ from the estimated schedule provided to Ross.Â  We agree with the trial judge that providing estimated payment dates that serve â€œno purpose whatsoeverâ€ and are dependent upon employees being employed at the time payouts are distributed, whenever that may be, is arbitrary and unreasonable.Â  Ligand admitted the commissions Ross sought were from sales made during the final trimester in which he worked for the company, and that he was in good standing with Ligand when the trimester ended and when he resigned.Â  Additionally, at the conclusion of Rossâ€™s final trimester, there was nothing more that he was required to do or participate in to determine the amount of compensation due under the RBM Plan.Â  The sole reason Ligand failed to pay the wages earned during Rossâ€™s final trimester was that Ross was not employed when it finally issued the compensation checks several weeks after the target date had passed.Â  Moreover, as discussed above, Ligandâ€™s policy failed to provide the time and place for payment of commissions earned under the RBM Plan, and this failure prevented Ligand from being able to pay wages due to Ross under the Payment of Wages Act.Â  Accordingly, we agree with the trial judge that Ligandâ€™s policy was based on its unilateral, arbitrary decision on when to issue compensation and that no good faith dispute existed.Â  Therefore, Ross is entitled to treble damages and attorneyâ€™s fees under section 41-10-80(C).Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.[1]\r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] In light of our disposition of this case, we need not address Appellantâ€™s remaining issues relating to (1) the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the compensation plan violates public policy or (2) the breach of contract action. Â See \r\nWhiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Â However, one issue that warrants discussion is whether Ross consented to the terms of the agreement and is estopped from challenging the policy after his departure.Â  The trial judge found this argument to be without merit because the agreement was void and unenforceable under the Payment of Wages Act.Â  We agree.Â  Section 40-10-100 provides that â€œno provision of this chapter may be contravened or set aside by a private agreement.â€Â  Additionally, in Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., the supreme court reiterated South Carolinaâ€™s policy underlying the Payment of Wages Act, stating that our courts â€œrefuse to allow employers to ignore the statute by claiming their employees had by contract or custom waived their statutory right to prompt payment of wages.â€Â  335 S.C. 598, 605, 518 S.E.2d 591, 594 (1999).Â  The RBM Plan sought to set aside the requirement of the Act that Employers must provide a â€œtime and place of paymentâ€ to employees.Â  As we have held, the arbitrary date of the issuance of the commission checks at the discretion of Ligand is insufficient to comply with the Act.Â  Therefore, any agreement Ross may have consented to would be void under section 40-10-100, and unenforceable against him by Ligand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4191","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

Knobel, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4191\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 21, 2006\r\n\r\nÂ Â AFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Charles R. Griffin, Jr., of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\n        Kimberly Welchel, of Walhalla, for Respondents.\r\n        Blair L. Stoudemire, of Seneca, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  The South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) initiated this termination of parental rights action against Richard, Roe, John Doe, and Jane Doe. The family court terminated Jane Doeâ€™s parental rights on the grounds: (1) she has a diagnosable condition not likely to change within a reasonable time that makes her unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for the child and (2) termination of her parental rights is in the childâ€™s best interest.[1]Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDoe gave birth to the minor child Matthew on May 30, 2002, after twenty-four (24) weeks of gestation. [2]Â  Â Matthew was placed in foster care in Georgia until November of 2003, when he was returned to Doe.Â  In April 2004, DSS took Matthew into custody as the result of allegations of neglect and violence in the family home, including the possibility of physical abuse.Â  \r\nÂ Shortly after Matthewâ€™s birth, Doe was referred to psychologist Fred W. Fussell for evaluation because of hospital personnelâ€™s concern regarding her parenting ability. Background information revealed that Doe receives a monthly Supplemental Security Income check and has never been married or employed. Â She graduated from a special education curriculum at Stephens County High School. Â Doeâ€™s parents divorced when she was nine.Â  Since then her home has been with her mother.Â  Her motherâ€™s boyfriend lives in the home as well. Â \r\nAfter Matthew was removed from Doeâ€™s custody in April 2004, Doe was evaluated by psychologist David G. Cannon. Â Subsequently, through the Oconee Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, Doe participated in counseling and parenting classes as part of a treatment plan. \r\nDSS instituted this action to terminate Doeâ€™s parental rights pursuant to section 20-7-766 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1996, amended 1997).Â  By order dated July 2, 2005, the family court announced, inter alia, the following findings of fact:\r\n\r\n  (9) I find that [DSS] has proven by clear and convincing evidence and unchallenged expert psychological testimony that Defendant [Jane Doe] has a diagnosable condition of Personality Disorder NOS [not otherwise specified] with Antisocial Traits, Mild Mental Retardation, and Borderline Intellectual Functioning unlikely to change within a reasonable time and the condition makes the Defendant unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for the child pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6).\r\n  (14)Â I find it to be in the best interest of the Defendant child for the parental rights of Defendant [Jane Doe] to be terminated.Â  The minor child has excelled in his present placement pursuant to testimony provided in that he talks constantly, knows his animal sounds, loves to play outside, eats a wide variety of foods and is potty trained.Â  The Guardian ad Litem states that termination of parental rights is in the childâ€™s best interest.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) action, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003). Â Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Â Â Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination as to whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, in reviewing a termination of parental rights, an appellate court is not required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars,Â Â  367 S.C. 623, 629, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721 (2006); Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996). Â â€œWhile we have jurisdiction in such matters to find facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, where the evidence presented in the record adequately supports the findings of the trial judge, due deference should be given to his judgment based on his superior position in weighing such evidence. Â This is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of children.â€ Â Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991) (citations omitted).Â  Because terminating the legal relationship between natural parents and a child is one of the most difficult issues an appellate court has to decide, great caution must be exercised in reviewing termination proceedings and termination is proper only when the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates such a result.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDoe contends that, although DSS may have shown she has a diagnosable condition, the condition can be remedied.Â  She argues the family court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence that her parental rights should be terminated, because DSS failed to prove a diagnosable condition not likely to change within a reasonable time.Â Â  Â We disagree.\r\nTermination of parental rights statutes must be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.Â  Parker, 336 S.C. at 258, 519 S.E.2d at 356 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 1998)). Â The interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict. Id. The family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding that one or more of the nine statutory grounds is met and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  Seegars,Â  367 S.C. at 629, 627 S.E.2d at 721; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  Subsection (6) provides for termination upon clear and convincing evidence that:\r\n\r\n  [t]he parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, mental deficiency, mental illness, or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child . . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nWhen the diagnosable condition alleged is mental deficiency, there must be clear and convincing evidence that: (1) the parent has a diagnosed mental deficiency, and (2) this deficiency makes it unlikely that the parent will be able to provide minimally acceptable care of the child. Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 311 S.C. 426, 428, 429 S.E.2d 807, 808 (1993); Orangeburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Harley, 302 S.C. 64, 66, 393 S.E.2d 597, 598 (Ct. App. 1990). Â We have determined that testimony by a clinical psychologist provided clear and convincing evidence of a diagnosable condition of mental deficiency, unlikely to change within reasonable time, and that condition made the mother unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of her child. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Humphreys, 297 S.C. 118, 122, 374 S.E.2d 922, 925 (Ct. App. 1988). Â In Humphreys, as in the instant case, the mother was mildly mentally deficient and the psychologist opined there was little likelihood that a course in parenting skills could ever make her capable of being primary caretaker for her child. Id.Â  Distinguishing Humphreys, in Smith, 311 S.C. at 426, 429 S.E.2d at 807, our Supreme Court reversed the family courtâ€™s termination of parental rights based on section 20-7-1572(6).Â  Both parents in Smith were mildly mentally retarded and expert psychological testimony indicated the motherâ€™s ability to function in a parental role was poor and unlikely to improve.Â  Id. at 428, 429 S.E.2d at 808.Â  On cross examination, however, the psychologist opined the parents could possibly benefit from a new and innovative program for the education of the mentally retarded focusing on parenting skills, family planning, and sexuality. Â Id. at 429, 429 S.E.2d at 809. Â The DSS social worker along with the administrator of the educational program agreed, and the Court reversed, remanding the case to the family court for reconsideration of termination following the parentsâ€™ participation in the program. \r\nOur precedent has traditionally distinguished between the provisions under section 20-7-1572(2) and section 20-7-1572(6) as to the remediation of conditions that lead to a TPR action. Â See Harley, 302 S.C. at 66, 393 S.E.2d at 598; Humphreys, 297 S.C. at 122, 374 S.E.2d at 924-25.Â  Subsection (2) provides that parental rights may be terminated if â€œ[t]he child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20-7-610 or Section 20-7-736, has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  On the other hand, section 20-7-1572(6) does not expressly provide an opportunity to remedy a diagnosed condition that is â€œunlikely to change within a reasonable time.â€ Id., Â§ 20-7-1572(6).Â  However, as Smith inculcates, even though a diagnosis of mental retardation is unlikely to change, a parentâ€™s ability to provide minimally acceptable care for the child may nevertheless improve with specialized training. Â \r\nWhile Smith offers some support for Doesâ€™ contention that the unfortunate consequences of her diagnosed condition may be remedied, the standard by which the court must evaluate her claim remains the same.Â  The family court must find by clear and convincing evidence that Doe has a mental deficiency, unlikely to change, that makes it unlikely she can provide minimally acceptable care for Matthew and that termination of Doeâ€™s parental rights are in Matthewâ€™s best interest. \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Diagnosable Condition\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Expert Testimony\r\nDr. Fussellâ€™s assessment was based on results from the Wechsler Intelligence Adult Scale-III, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, the Rorschach Psychodiagnostic Plates, the Bender-Gestalt Visual Motor Test, the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory, Projective Drawings, Clinical Interview, and Informant Interview.Â  Doeâ€™s cognitive test results fell within the borderline range of intellectual functioning, with a Full Scale I.Q. score of 71.Â  On the objective personality instruments Doeâ€™s results were appreciably defensive, requiring re-administration, but ultimately remaining defensive.Â  Dr. Fussellâ€™s diagnostic impression was Axis II: Borderline Intellectual Functioning and Personality Disorder, NOS (not otherwise specified) (Cluster A Traits), Axis IV: Problems with Primary Support Group, Custody Issues, and Axis V:Â  GAF = 35 (Current).Â  \r\nAt the termination hearing Dr. Fussell addressed Doeâ€™s parenting ability in light of his findings. Questioned by DSSâ€™s attorney about the meaning of â€œpersonality disorder not otherwise specified,â€ Dr. Fussell explicated: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Well, the personality disorders are&mdash;there&rsquo;s nine of them, and they&rsquo;re grouped into three clusters.&nbsp; The first cluster is composed of perceptional distortions, peculiar behavior.&nbsp; Cluster B, the second cluster, is composed of antisocial behaviors, borderline, behavioral aberrations, and Cluster C is dependent sorts of characteristics, and Cluster A is made up of paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal and I&rsquo;d see her [Doe] as mostly schizoid with some paranoid aspects.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    So, if you can describe that diagnosis of personality disorder not otherwise specified, Cluster A trait.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n     Interpersonal deficits, suspicious, untrusting, mild issues with perceptual accuracy.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Okay, and you also diagnosed her as borderline intellectual functioning.&nbsp; Describe that.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    Well, it&rsquo;s a classification below low average and above mild mental retardation.&nbsp; In her case she was just above the mild mental retardation.&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s significantly below average.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And on Axis V your diagnostic impression was a GAF of 35.&nbsp; What does that entail?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    Someone with a GAF of 35 is going to experience significant difficulties interacting successfully with the environment, and be a number of issues present, misinterpret others, misrepresent issues.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And based on your history, your interview and your testing what are your conclusions and recommendations regarding [Doe]. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    Well, at the time I performed this assessment I had considerable concern regarding her ability to care for a child, particularly one who is premature at that point, and in terms of recommendations I was not very optimistic.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    Okay, and what treatment or therapy would you recommend or did you recommend for [Doe]?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    Well, at the time of assessment I did not recommend one.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And is there a reason for that?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n     I didn&rsquo;t have much optimism it would be successful. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And why did you not have much optimism that it would be successful?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n     The personality characteristics compounded by intellectual ability. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And how does that work to make it to where she would not be a good . . . candidate for further counseling or treatment?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    Well, the degree of suspiciousness she&rsquo;s going to have marked difficulty trusting someone enough to let them know what&rsquo;s happening and accept their guidance and direction, and that&rsquo;s further compounded by intellectual limitations as she would have difficulty understanding what&rsquo;s being said.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    . . . \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    And do you have an opinion as to a reasonable degree of certainty within the area of your expertise as [Doe&rsquo;s] ability to provide minimally acceptable care for this child at the time you saw and evaluated her?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    I felt she did not have the ability to do that.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Now, based on your observations, is it reasonably likely that this condition could be remedied in a reasonable period of time at the time you saw her?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    No.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn June of 2004, when Matthew was again in DSS custody, psychologist David G. Cannon evaluated Doe.Â  Dr. Cannon administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wide-Range Achievement Test-Revised, which yielded a Full Scale I.Q. score of 69, indicating Doeâ€™s intellectual functioning was in the mild range of mental retardation. At this level Dr. Cannon opined Doe should be able to master basic academic skills up to a seventh or eighth grade level. Dr. Cannonâ€™s diagnostic impressions were in accord with Dr. Fussellâ€™s.Â  He confirmed the Axis II diagnosis of Personality Disorder NOS with Antisocial Traits.Â  In addition, Dr. Cannon indicated an Axis I diagnosis of Neglect of Child and Rule/Out Physical Abuse of Child. \r\nSummarizing his impressions of Doeâ€™s psychological status in his report, Dr. Cannon opined she appeared to be â€œheavily into denial,â€ â€œmanipulative and self-contradictory in her responses,â€ and â€œshould not be regarded as a credible respondent.â€Â Â  Dr. Cannon cautioned, â€œ[i]t seems unlikely that she will cooperate in any genuine manner with a rehabilitative program. Â She seems to possess few personal qualities at this time that would enable her to function as an effective parent.â€Â  Dr. Cannon recommended Doe be required to successfully complete classes in parenting and anger management and be required to enter individual psychotherapy.\r\nAt the termination hearing Dr. Cannon testified that, in addition to his earlier assessment, he reviewed Dr. Fussellâ€™s psychological evaluation prior to the termination hearing: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And were [Dr. Fussell&rsquo;s] diagnostic impressions on that psychological evaluation consistent with your findings two years later.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Yes, they were very similar.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And were the treatment recommendations as indicated in your evaluation consistent with the treatment recommendations recommended at that time?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    \r\n    As I recall Dr. Fussell in his report didn&rsquo;t make specific recommendations.&nbsp; He noted as I noted in effect that the probability of change and successful intervention was very low, and his prognosis as indicated in the latter part of his report was quite poor. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    \r\n    And after preparing your psychological evaluation and then reviewing that one, what effect did that have on your opinion regarding the chronicity of this condition and the parent&rsquo;s ability to provide minimally acceptable care for that child.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Well, unfortunately it reinforce[s] my impressions that the prognosis here is quite poor. &nbsp;There did not appear to be any &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appreciable gain or change in what was close to or going on a two-year period from the time he conducted his evaluation up to the time that I conducted mine, and that reinforced my impression that there was very little&mdash;there is very little probability of meaningful change on this lady&rsquo;s part. \r\n  \r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Lay Testimony[3]\r\nKathy Baker,[4] an employee with Oconee County Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, testified she met with Doe to create a treatment plan.Â  Implementation of the plan began on August 13, 2004, after DSS had taken custody of Matthew.Â  According to Baker, Doe â€œlearned how to learn resources into the community, like libraries or paying bills and interacting with anything in the community, living skills.â€ Â Baker commented that Doe â€œdone greatâ€ in the program.Â  She observed Doeâ€™s interactions with children and noted that Doe â€œwould just light upâ€ when she was around children.Â  \r\nDoe testified she liked working with the Disabilities and Special Needs program.Â  When asked what they do, she responded, â€œ[g]o to the movies, they carry me to pay bills and grocery shopping and stuff.â€Â  Doe claimed she had done everything DSS asked her to do; she attended parenting classes and earned a certificate, but she could not attend anger management classes because she could not afford them. She averred she planned to continue working with Disabilities and Special Needs.\r\nDoe maintained she visited Matthew regularly and the only visit she missed was one DSS cancelled. According to Doe, the visits were coordinated by Disabilities and Special Needs personnel, and Doe used a taxi for transportation to the visits at a cost of twenty-five dollars per trip.Â  She explained that during her visits with Matthew she played with him, read him books, and brought him snacks.Â  Doe professed she had hot water and a stove in her home and could cook â€œdifferent thingsâ€ like â€œspaghetti.â€Â  \r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s conclusion that clear and convincing evidence exists in the expert medical testimony to support termination of Doeâ€™s parental rights.Â  Both psychologists confirmed Doeâ€™s diagnosed intellectual deficits and personality disorder, and both agreed the conditions were unlikely to change.Â  In fact, no appreciable differences in Doeâ€™s condition were observed between the initial evaluation by Dr. Fussel and the assessment two years later by Dr. Cannon.Â  In his report Dr. Fussel opined:\r\n\r\n  [t]his assessment is indicative of a marginal individual, both intellectually and as regards to her personality organization.Â  Such individuals are often unable to provide an adequate environment for an infant or other child. They are largely unaware or oblivious to the needs of others.Â  Consequently, a significant potential for neglect exists. \r\n\r\nDr. Cannon subsequently explained Doe â€œseems totally lacking in judgment and insightâ€ and â€œshe did not present as a credible respondent.â€Â  He noted â€œ[i]t seems unlikely that she will cooperate in any genuine manner with a rehabilitative program.Â  She seems to possess few personal qualities at this time that would enable her to function as an effective parent.â€ Â Â Â  \r\nDr. Fussell cautioned that, because he did not observe Doeâ€™s interaction with Matthew, his clinical impressions should be corroborated by independent observation. Â Accordingly, the Guardian ad Litem appointed in this case stated that termination of Doeâ€™s parental rights was in Matthewâ€™s best interest. \r\nFinally, in contrast to the circumstances in Smith, no convincing evidence indicates the treatment available to Doe through Oconee County Disabilities and Special Needs offers the kind of specialized remediation that would enable Doe to provide minimally acceptable care for Matthew. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Best Interests of the Child\r\nDoe does not challenge the family courtâ€™s finding that terminating her parental rights is in the best interest of the child.Â  We, nevertheless, review the family courtâ€™s conclusion ex mero motu.Â  \r\nAn exception to the rule that an unpreserved issue will not be considered on appeal exists where the interests of minors or incompetents are involved.Â  State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 611 S.E.2d 273 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Procedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minors.Â  Ex Parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 624 S.E.2d 649 (2006); Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000).Â  Where the rights and best interests of a minor child are concerned, the court may appropriately raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised by the parties.Â  Ex parte Roper, 254 S.C. 558, 176 S.E.2d 175 (1970).Â  See also Arscott v. Bacon, 351 S.C. 44, 567 S.E.2d 898 (Ct. App. 2002) (due to role of courts in protecting minors, the appellate court may raise ex mero motu issues not raised by the parties). Â The duty to protect the rights of minors and incompetents has precedence over procedural rules otherwise limiting the scope of review and matters affecting the rights of minors can be considered by this court ex mero motu.Â  Galloway v. Galloway, 249 S.C. 157, 153 S.E.2d 326 (1967); Caughman v. Caughman, 247 S.C. 104, 146 S.E.2d 93 (1965).Â  See also S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 551 S.E.2d 274 (Ct. App. 2001) (under South Carolinaâ€™s public policy, the best interests of minor children prevail over procedural impediments to obtaining support for minor children).\r\nHere, the family court found that Matthew has excelled in his present placement pursuant to testimony provided in that he â€œtalks constantly, knows his animal sounds, loves to play outside, eats a wide variety of foods and is potty trained.â€Â  In addition, the Guardian ad Litem advised that termination was in Matthewâ€™s best interest.Â  The evidentiary record taken as a whole, including lay testimony, expert testimony, psychological reports, and the Guardian ad Litemâ€™s recommendation convinces us that Doe is not capable of providing the level of care Matthew needs and termination of Doeâ€™s parental rights is in his best interest.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter analyzing the facts, applicable statutory provisions, and relevant precedent with specificity, we place our imprimatur upon the ruling of the family court. \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. Â \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Defendant Richard Roe, Matthewâ€™s putative father, reportedly takes no role in Matthewâ€™s life.Â  Roe was served by publication but did not file a responsive pleading.Â  Consequently, the family court held Roe in default and terminated Roeâ€™s parental rights based on finding clear and convincing evidence of (1) willful failure to support or make a material contribution to the minor childâ€™s care as provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (1976), (2) willful failure to visit the minor child within the last six months pursuant to S.C.Â  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) (1976), and (3) the termination of Roeâ€™s parental rights would be in the best interest of the minor child. \r\n[3] The record lists Lori Sanders, Human Service Specialist for Oconee DSS, as a witness for Respondent DSS; Lynn Baker from Disabilities and Special Needs and Doeâ€™s Mother were listed as witnesses for Appellant Doe. Testimony from these witnesses, if they in fact did testify at the termination hearing, is not included in the record on appeal.\r\n[4] Baker, a high school graduate, did not testify as an expert witness, and the record contains no specific information on her professional qualifications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4192","title":"State v.

Clare, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  James Pondesta White was convicted of distribution of crack cocaine and sentenced to eight years.Â  White appeals, asserting the trial court abused its discretion by not declaring a mistrial after the jury listened to a tape of an in camera hearing that was mistakenly played in the place of trial testimony that the jury requested.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn August 14, 2003, White was involved in the sale of crack cocaine to Mike Lynn.Â  During Whiteâ€™s trial, the court held an in camera hearing regarding the identification of White by the Stateâ€™s witness, Lieutenant Jason Dalton.Â  At the hearing, Dalton testified that on the day in question, he was inside a vacant house conducting drug surveillance with binoculars. Â Dalton watched a white truck drive by very slowly, turn around at the end of the street, and return.Â  White approached the vehicle once it came to a complete stop.Â  Dalton stated that he saw White make a motion with his hand, after which the truck drove away only to come back moments later.Â  When called as a fact witness during trial, Dalton testified similarly.\r\nAt the trial, Lynn, the driver of the white truck, professed that when White walked up to his vehicle, he informed White he wanted to buy crack cocaine.Â  Following Whiteâ€™s instructions, Lynn circled the block and returned.Â  Upon stopping, he was given crack cocaine by Whiteâ€™s brother in exchange for twenty dollars.\r\nIn the course of its charge of the law, the court invited the jury to request any part of the trial they would like to have replayed.Â  During deliberation, the jury asked to hear Daltonâ€™s testimony.Â  However, the court reporter mistakenly played the testimony from the in camera hearing.Â  In an effort to correct the error, the court inquired if White would like Daltonâ€™s trial testimony played.Â  The court noted that if Daltonâ€™s complete trial account was replayed, the jury would ultimately hear the direct testimony two additional times but the cross examination only once more.Â  As a way to mitigate any damage possibly caused by the error, the judge suggested that only the cross-examination be heard again.Â  White did not accept the suggestion and moved for a mistrial. Â The court denied this motion and issued the following curative instruction:Â  \r\n\r\n  Through an honest mistake what you actually heard was not the trial testimony but the testimony from a matter outside your presence, so disregard in its entirety that testimony that was just played for you, just completely disregard it, and weâ€™re going to play the correct testimony for you at this time.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Daltonâ€™s trial testimony replayed in its entirety. \r\nAfter the jury returned a guilty verdict, White moved for a mistrial and new trial on the ground that the in camera testimony had been improperly presented to the jury.Â  The judge denied this motion.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhite alleges the accidental playing of the in camera hearing violated his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury and prevented the jury from reaching its verdict only from the evidence properly presented.Â  Specifically, White contends the tape the jury improperly heard â€œincluded factual allegations which were peripheral to the hearingâ€™s purpose but were repeated at trial as critical evidence in the overall prosecution.â€Â  He avers that â€œ[m]ost of the in camera testimony was not thoroughly cross-examined because of the hearingâ€™s limited purpose.â€Â  White does not point to any specific factual allegations or testimony that required cross-examination, nor does he identify any material or substantive ways in which the in camera and trial testimony differed.\r\nI. Mistrial\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. Â State v. Crim, 327 S.C. 254, 257, 489 S.E.2d 478, 479 (1997); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 226, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Our courts favor the exercise of wide discretion of the trial judge in determining the merits of such motion in each individual case.Â  State v. Howard, 296 S.C. 481, 483, 374 S.E.2d 284, 285 (1988).Â  â€œIt is only in cases of abuse of discretion which result in prejudice that this court will intervene and grant a new trial.â€Â  State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 94, 180 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1971).Â  â€œA mistrial should only be granted in cases of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons.â€ Patterson, 337 S.C. at 227, 522 S.E.2d at 851; see also State v. Wasson, 299 S.C. 508, 386 S.E.2d 255 (1989); State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 28, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977) (â€œThe power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.â€). Â \r\nIn State v. Bilton, the South Carolina Supreme Court explained, â€œthe proper general rule is this: â€˜The American cases hold generally that there must be a manifest necessity for the discharge of the jury and leave the Courts to determine in their discretion whether under all the circumstances of each case such necessity exists.â€™ â€ 156 S.C. 324, 342, 153 S.E. 269, 276 (1930) (emphasis removed).Â  Thus, a mistrial should not be ordered in every case in which incompetent evidence is improperly admitted, State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 89, 512 S.E.2d 795, 801 (1999); Patterson, 337 S.C. at 227, 522 S.E.2d at 851, and our ruling must hinge on whether a â€œmanifest necessityâ€ for declaring a mistrial existed. Â See State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1983) (â€œThe less than lucid test is therefore declared to be whether the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the ends of public justice, the latter being defined as the publicâ€™s interest in a fair trial designated to end in just judgment.â€).\r\nÂ  The trial judge should first exhaust other methods to cure possible prejudice before aborting a trial.Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999); Wasson, 299 S.C. at 511, 386 S.E.2d at 256; Patterson, 337 S.C. at 227, 522 S.E.2d at 851.Â  Our supreme court has stated, â€œThe granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.â€Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 70, 502 S.E.2d 63, 73 (1998).Â  \r\nII. Curative Instruction\r\nâ€œGenerally, a curative instruction is deemed to have cured any alleged error.â€Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005); see also 75B Am. Jur. 2d Trial Â§ 1284 (1992) (â€œBy striking the evidence and instructing the jury to ignore it, the court may often cure its error in admitting the evidence, or render such error harmless, even in criminal cases.â€).Â  â€œA curative instruction to disregard incompetent evidence and not to consider it during deliberation is deemed to have cured any alleged error in its admission.â€Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. at 658, 623 S.E.2d at 130; see also Kelsey, 331 S.C. at 70, 502 S.E.2d at 73 (instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence is usually viewed as having corrected the error in its admission). Â â€œBecause a trial courtâ€™s curative instruction is considered to cure any error regarding improper testimony, a party must contemporaneously object to a curative instruction as insufficient or move for a mistrial to preserve an issue for review.â€Â  Patterson, 337 S.C. at 226, 522 S.E.2d at 850; see also State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1996) (no issue is preserved for appellate review if the objecting party accepts the judgeâ€™s ruling and does not contemporaneously make an additional objection to the sufficiency of the curative charge or move for a mistrial). Â If the trial judge sustains a timely objection to evidence and gives the jury a curative instruction that it be disregarded, the error is deemed to have been cured by the instruction. Â George, 323 S.C. at 510, 476 S.E.2d at 911-12. \r\nState v. Smith, 290 S.C. 393, 350 S.E.2d 923 (1986), addressed the issue of what constitutes a sufficient curative instruction. Â The supreme court reversed the trial court for its failure to give an adequate instruction after the solicitor improperly asked the psychiatrist if he was aware the defendant had refused to give a statement to the police. Â The judge asked the members of the jury if anyone remembered the solicitorâ€™s question.Â  When one juror responded affirmatively, the judge simply instructed that juror to â€œforget itâ€ and not to speak with anybody else regarding the question.Â  Id., 290 S.C. at 394, 350 S.E.2d at 924.\r\nReasoning that the judgeâ€™s casual remark to â€œforgetâ€ the question did not serve as a curative instruction, the supreme court inculcated: \r\n\r\n  Great care should be exercised in the â€œdelicate, difficult and important matterâ€ of instructing the jury to disregard incompetent evidence.Â  The jury should be specifically instructed to disregard the evidence, and not to consider it for any purpose during deliberations.Â  A mere general remark excluding the evidence does not cure the error.\r\n\r\nId., 290 S.C. at 395, 350 S.E.2d at 924 (internal citations omitted). \r\nIn State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999), the trial court held an in camera hearing regarding a motion to suppress an in-court identification of the defendant because of an allegedly tainted pre-trial photo lineup.Â  Although the judge ruled that unique circumstances in the case would create an impermissible comment on the defendantâ€™s character if a particular witness were to mention when he placed the defendantâ€™s picture in the lineup, this exact information was elicited from the witness during trial.Â  The defendant promptly objected to the improper testimony and moved for a mistrial.Â  Finding â€œthere [was] no manifest necessity . . . for the declaration of mistrial,â€ the trial court denied the motion and gave a curative instruction to the jury.Â  On appeal, this court found no error in the judgeâ€™s actions, agreed that a mistrial was not required, and found â€œ[t]he extensive curative instruction given by the trial judge cured any possible error and eliminated any conceivable prejudice.â€Â  337 S.C. at 227, 522 S.E.2d at 851.\r\nIII. Prejudice\r\nWhile an instruction to disregard incompetent evidence usually is deemed to have cured the error in its admission, a mistrial may still be required if on the facts of the particular case it is probable, notwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal, the accused was prejudiced. Â State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996); see also 75B Am. Jur. 2d Trial Â§ 1284 (1992) (â€œError is not always rendered harmless by instructions to the jury to disregard it or to give it only a limited effect.Â  The test is one of prejudice.â€) (footnotes omitted). Â Analogously, even without a curative instruction, an error not shown to be prejudicial to the appellant does not constitute grounds for reversal.Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 228, 625 S.E.2d 239, 243 (Ct. App. 2006) (rehearing denied March 28, 2006); see also State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472-73, 613 S.E.2d 381, 384 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the defendant.â€) (citations omitted).\r\nThe South Carolina Rules of evidence provide, â€œError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of party is affected . . . .â€Â  Rule 103, SCRE.Â  Thus, reversal on appeal is only required where a substantial right of a party has been affected.Â  Notes to Rule 103, SCRE (citing Michael H. Graham, Handbook of Federal Evidence, Â§ 103.1 (3rd ed. 1981)).Â  â€œ[E]rror which is harmless does not affect a substantial right.â€Â  Id. Â â€œError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the results of the trial.â€Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  Similarly, our appellate courts have consistently held that a trial court should only be reversed when an error is prejudicial and not harmless.Â  See State v. Sosebee, 284 S.C. 411, 326 S.E.2d 654 (1985) (probable prejudice must be shown); Watts v. Bell Oil Co., 266 S.C. 61, 221 S.E.2d 529 (1976) (prejudice must be shown).\r\nâ€œWhether an offer of improper evidence requires a reversal depends upon the character and importance of the evidence offered and the good or bad faith of counsel, and each case must be judged on its own circumstances.Â  The vital inquiry usually is whether or not the verdict was substantially influenced by the impropriety.â€Â  75A Am. Jur. 2d Trial Â§ 502 (1991) (footnotes omitted).\r\nÂ â€œThe determination of prejudice must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.â€Â  State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 523, 626 S.E.2d 59, 72 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005)); accord State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 91, 512 S.E.2d 795, 803 (1999) (â€œThe prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€).Â  â€œThe admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€Â  Douglas, 367 S.C. at 520, 626 S.E.2d at 71.Â  Insubstantial errors that do not impact the result of a case do not warrant a mistrial when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence. Â State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93, 180 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1971); see also State v. Gathers, 295 S.C. 476, 480, 369 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1988) (affâ€™d by South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U.S. 805, 109 S.Ct. 2207 (1989)) (stating that in light of overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt, any alleged error regarding the judgeâ€™s charge to the jury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).Â  To warrant reversal, â€œthe errors must adversely affect [the defendantâ€™s] right to a fair trial.â€Â  Johnson, 334 S.C. at 93, 512 S.E.2d at 803.\r\nOur supreme court has held:\r\n\r\n  Whether the error in a given case shall be regarded as harmless on appeal may often depend on the circumstances of the particular case rather than on any definite rules of law, the materiality and prejudicial character of the alleged error being determined in its relation to the entire case. Â Accordingly, the appellate courts are disposed to regard as harmless intervening errors where it appears from the record that the conviction is clearly correct on the merits; where it appears on the whole case that substantial justice has been done; where the record shows that accused had a fair trial; where the record conclusively shows that the alleged error could not have resulted in prejudice; where from the whole record the guilt of accused appears to be clearly established; where no other verdict could have been returned on the evidence, and where the conviction was just and would have been reached if the errors had not been committed. Â So, also, where it can be said from the record that the errors complained of could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial, they may be regarded as harmless, and this particularly where proof of accusedâ€™s guilt is clear.\r\n\r\nState v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93-94, 180 S.E.2d 888, 889-90 (1971) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\r\nIn State v. Howard, 296 S.C. 481 374 S.E.2d 284 (1988), the prosecution impermissibly entered statements of other crimes into evidence through the testimony of a codefendant.Â  The first time this occurred, the court properly instructed the jurors to disregard what they had heard.Â  However, the judge gave no curative instruction when similar improper statements were given a second time.Â  Nonetheless, on appeal the supreme court found the defendant had not been prejudiced by the error and thus a reversal was not required.Â  Citing State v. Livingston, 282 S.C. 1, 317 S.E.2d 129 (1984), the court stated, â€œWhere guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence and no rational conclusion can be reached other than that the accused is guilty, a conviction will not be set aside because of insubstantial errors not affecting the result.â€ Â Howard, 296 S.C. at 485, 374 S.E.2d at 286.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe substance of Officer Daltonâ€™s statements in front of and outside of the juryâ€™s presence were almost identical one another.Â  A key part of Daltonâ€™s testimony, his observation of Whiteâ€™s hand motion, was contained in both his in camera and trial testimony.Â  Nothing material or that could have feasibly required cross-examination was said in the hearing that did not come out when Dalton took the stand.Â  Even in the event there had been additional or differing testimony during the hearing, White has failed to show how the judgeâ€™s curative instruction was insufficient to resolve the issue.\r\nThe burden is on the movant to show not only error, but resulting prejudice justifying a mistrial. Â State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999).Â  Had a curative instruction not been given for the jury to have disregarded the improperly played audio tape, White would still be required to show prejudice resulted from the error. White has not demonstrated why the curative instruction was not sufficient to cure the error and how he was prejudiced by the accidental playing of Daltonâ€™s in camera hearing that was so similar to his actual trial testimony. Â \r\nThe judge responded with propriety and alacrity when the tape of the in camera hearing was inadvertently played for the jury.Â  â€œ[T]he Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.â€Â  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 119-200, 498 S.E.2d 642, 647-48 (1998) (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436 (1986)).Â  The potency of the courtâ€™s curative instruction expunged and extirpated any alleged damage possibly caused by error.Â  No prejudice was suffered.Â  Concomitantly, Whiteâ€™s motion for a mistrial was properly denied and his conviction is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4193","title":"State v.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4193\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2006 â€“ Filed December 21, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Assistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        John Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Eddie Pauling appeals the revocation of his probation.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWhile on probation, Pauling was arrested for assault and battery with intent to kill and pointing and presenting a firearm.Â  At the time of his probation revocation hearing, Pauling had not been tried on these charges.Â  At the hearing, the State relied on the arrest warrants and affidavits of police officers and investigators.Â  Relying on Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), Pauling argued a revocation based on a mere allegation violated his right to confrontation.Â  The trial court found the protection afforded in Crawford does not apply to probation revocation proceedings.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether or not to revoke probation is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion. Â State v. Proctor, 345 S.C. 299, 301, 546 S.E.2d 673, 674 (Ct. App. 2001). Â â€œThis courtâ€™s authority to review such a decision is confined to correcting errors of law unless the lack of a legal or evidentiary basis indicates the circuit judgeâ€™s decision was arbitrary and capricious.â€Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 647, 511 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPauling argues the circuit court erred in revoking his probation in violation of his right to confront witnesses.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œProbation is a matter of grace; revocation is the means to enforce the conditions of probation.â€ Â Id. at 648, 511 S.E.2d at 97. Â â€œThus, before revoking probation, the circuit judge must determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish that the probationer has violated his probation conditions.â€Â  Id. at 648-49, 511 S.E.2d at 97.Â  However, a probationer facing revocation is afforded only minimal due process.Â  See State v. Hill, 368 S.C. 649, 654-60, 630 S.E.2d 274, 277-80 (2006) (providing an extensive discussion of the issue).Â  Probation revocation is not a criminal prosecution and the defendant is not entitled to â€œthe full panoply of rights.â€Â  23 C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1517 (2006).Â  For instance, our supreme court recently held that the disclosure rights under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), do not apply to probation revocation hearings.Â  State v. Hill, 368 S.C. 649, 654-59, 630 S.E.2d 274, 277-80 (2006).Â  Likewise, in State v. Franks, 276 S.C. 636, 639-40, 281 S.E.2d 227, 228 (1981), the court held â€œthe Fourth Amendmentâ€™s requirement that a magistrate issue an arrest warrant does not apply to a warrant for violation of probation conditions.â€Â  The court stated in Franks:\r\n\r\n  So there is quite a difference between a criminal prosecution and a probation revocation hearing. Â The courts have, accordingly, recognized that the rights of an offender in a probation revocation hearing are not the same as those extended him by the United States Constitution upon the trial of the original offense. Â \r\n  The United States Supreme Court has held a parolee is still in custody because he faces significant confinement and restraint even though he is no longer within the four walls of prison. . . . Â \r\n  We think that while a person convicted of a crime is still restrained within the confines of his probation, he does not enjoy the same unfettered constitutional privileges available to those not so confined. Â It is elementary that while conviction and imprisonment do not strip the violator of his rights, those privileges are severely diminished. \r\n\r\nId. at 639, 281 S.E.2d at 228.\r\nApplying similar reasoning, we find no reason to extend the right to confront witnesses to a probationer in a revocation proceeding.Â  â€œThe Sixth Amendmentâ€™s Confrontation Clause provides that, â€˜[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€™â€Â  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 42 (2004) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI).Â  In State v. Williamson, this court affirmed the revocation of probation based on a criminal charge that had not resulted in a conviction.Â  356 S.C. 507, 509-512, 589 S.E.2d 787, 788-89 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The court found a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that the terms of probation were violated despite the lack of prior conviction on the criminal charge.Â  Id. at 511-12, 589 S.E.2d at 789. Â The following year, the United States Supreme Court banned out-of-court testimonial statements from criminal trials unless the witness is unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at 53. \r\nPauling essentially argues Williamson was overruled by Crawford.Â  We disagree.Â  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently addressed a similar challenge, stating:\r\n\r\n  Crawford changed nothing with respect to revocation hearings. . . . Â [R]evocation hearings are not â€˜criminal prosecutionsâ€™ for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, so the â€˜full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceedingâ€™ does not apply. Â This â€˜full panoply of rightsâ€™ is precisely the list of protections found in the Sixth Amendment, which by its terms applies only to criminal prosecutions. Â Because revocation proceedings are not criminal prosecutions, Sixth Amendment rights are not implicated. . . . Â Crawford dealt with the introduction of testimonial hearsay at a criminal trialâ€”a â€˜criminal prosecution[ ],â€™ as that term is used in the Sixth Amendment. Â The Supreme Court did not mention revocation hearings . . . in Crawford; nothing in the case can be read to suggest that . . . revocation proceedings should now be characterized as â€˜criminal prosecutionsâ€™ within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. \r\n\r\nU.S. v. Kelley, 446 F.3d 688, 691-92 (7th Cir. 2006).Â  \r\nWe recognize that Crawford heightened the awareness of the importance of the confrontation clause in criminal proceedings.Â  However, like the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, we decline to extend the Crawford analysis to probation revocation proceedings.Â  Absent direction from our supreme court, we will not deviate from the long tradition of limiting a defendantâ€™s rights in probation revocation proceedings, where the evidence is often limited to the testimony of a probation officer or, as is the case here, affidavits of victims or police officers.Â  Based on the record before us, we find sufficient evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding of Paulingâ€™s probation violations.Â  Accordingly, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
