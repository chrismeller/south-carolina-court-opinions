Young, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Charleston County\r\nÂ DanielÂ  F.Â  Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3983\r\nHeard December 7, 2004 â€“ Filed May 2, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nActing Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Derringer L. Young was charged with possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, and kidnapping.Â  He pled guilty to the possession charge, and a jury convicted him of kidnapping, and of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature as a lesser included offense of criminal sexual conduct.Â  On appeal, Young argues (1) the trial judge erred by admitting evidence of his prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct and criminal domestic violence, and (2) the State improperly injected race as a motive.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nYoung was accused of kidnapping and raping the victim in the early morning hours of September 9, 2001, in downtown Charleston, South Carolina.Â  Following dinner the previous evening, the victim drove downtown by herself to purchase crack cocaine.Â  She testified she had done this numerous times before.Â  The victim bought crack cocaine on this particular night from Young because he â€œlooked familiar to [her], like [she] had bought from him before.â€Â  After purchasing crack from Young, the victim smoked it and asked to buy more.Â  He indicated he needed a ride to get more crack, and she agreed to drive him.Â  Young became enraged when the victim informed Young she wanted more crack so that she could return home and smoke it with her husband.Â  She alleges Young hit her, forced his way into the driverâ€™s seat, drove to a secluded area, and raped her.Â  \r\nAt approximately nine oâ€™clock a.m., Corporal Sherry Niblock spotted the victimâ€™s car parked and observed the victim fully reclined in the passenger seat with Young on top of her.Â  When Young saw Niblock, he jumped into the driverâ€™s seat and sped away in the vehicle.Â  Niblock testified that the victim looked exhausted, had been crying, and had bruises on her neck.Â  Niblock stated the victim â€œrolled her head over at [her] and said, â€˜Would you please just help me?â€™â€Â  Niblock dispatched information about the vehicle, which Officer Peter Hall located approximately ten minutes later.Â  According to Hall, the victim looked exhausted and had marks on her neck and wrists.Â  A rape exam was inconclusive as to whether sexual assault had occurred.Â  \r\nYoung testified at trial and gave a much different account of his encounter with the victim on the night in question.Â  According to Young, the victim was one of his customers.Â  He stated the two of them drove around all night smoking crack and talking.Â  \r\nThroughout his testimony, Young conveyed his concernment for the victimâ€™s safety.Â  He averred that he had previously sold drugs to the victim and on the night of the alleged rape, she returned to the place they had first met and asked for him.Â  Young proclaimed he sold her $80 worth of crack, which the two of them smoked.Â  After consuming the crack, the victim asked for more.Â  Young recounted:\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right after that she said she aint had anymore money.Â  So I said, well, Iâ€™ll get the drugs for you.Â  Just whenever, you know, you come back down the area, bring the money to me.\r\n\r\nNow I was able to trust her, because like I say before, once a person deal with you and we use the word and the term keep it real.Â  She kept it real.\r\n\r\nAnd I was able to trust [the victim].Â  So any time that she would come downâ€”and then I also told some people, said, If she come down, I donâ€™t want nobody talking to her.Â  I donâ€™t want nobody selling her nothing.Â  I donâ€™t want nobody bothering her.Â  Leave her be whenever she come, because sheâ€™s coming to me.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, tell me what happened after she asked you for some more drugs.Â  What did yâ€™all do?\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, we get the drugs.\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  How did you get the drugs?\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, I was getting all the drugs fronted to me by some people that I know.\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  And was she paying you for them?\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, she aint had no more money.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\nAny time we would run low [on drugs], [the victim] would feel that, you know,\r\nshe have to have more than what she got.\r\n\r\nSo I like, Well, . . . you know you got to get back on the road soon, you know?\r\n\r\nSo she like, Iâ€™m going to be all right.&nbsp; Iâ€™m going to be all right.\r\n\r\n I said, But then I donâ€™t want nothing to happen to you, because people\r\n saw, you know, me and you, you know, riding around together.&nbsp; And me\r\nand you were riding around forâ€”\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n And I do remember saying, . . . you got to get back on the road soon.&nbsp;\r\n You know, because you know, I donâ€™t want nothing to happen to you down here,\r\n because people saw me and you together, you know?\r\n \r\n So she said, Iâ€™m going to be all right.&nbsp; Iâ€™m going to be all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nSo I said, Okay.&nbsp; I said, Come on then, take me back on the block and Iâ€™ll\r\ngo and get something else for you.\r\n. . . .\r\nSo we park on Sheppard\r\nStreet.&nbsp; I said, . . . lock your windows.&nbsp; Up your windows.&nbsp;\r\nDonâ€™t talk to nobody.&nbsp; I mean nobody.\r\nSo she said, Okay.&nbsp; I said, Just give me five minutes\r\nand Iâ€™ll be right back.\r\nSo I got out of the vehicle . . . . \r\n. . . .\r\nI got the drugs and I came back.&nbsp; This little fellow\r\nby the nickname of Daddy, which is his real nickâ€”his real name is Antwan\r\nGrant.\r\nSo when I came up, I saw him and [the victim]\r\ntalking.&nbsp; I said, Yo, what are you doing to the vehicle?&nbsp; You know I\r\ndonâ€™t play that with nobody around here.\r\nHe said, Man, I was coming down the street, man, and I saw\r\nthis white girl in this vehicle and I thought something was wrong.&nbsp; I know\r\nfor a fact, dog, you always in this area.&nbsp; \r\nSo she probably thought he was spying on me or something.\r\n I said, No, she with me, man.\r\nSo at that time I didnâ€™t know [the victim] and him had\r\nalready done spoke.\r\nSo she said, Let me hold on him for a minute, Duke.\r\nI said, . . . you aint come down here to talk to nobody,\r\nyou come down here to deal with me; not nobody else.\r\nSo at that time I was kind of likeâ€”can I continue?\r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was like getting angry\r\nwith [the victim] because I was like, wait a minute.&nbsp; You come to deal with\r\nme, not nobody else.&nbsp; So if something happened to you, everybody going to\r\nlook at me; not this man right here. . . . \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nAt this point, Grant\r\nentered the car with Young and the victim.&nbsp; According to Young, Grant\r\ndirected the victim to drive to a certain location and park the vehicle.&nbsp;\r\nGrant then asked to be alone with the victim.&nbsp; Young, on direct\r\nexamination, described his reaction:\r\n\r\nHe said, because I need to holler at her, dog.\r\nI said, Yo, you aint got no words for her, period.\r\n She said, itâ€™s all right.&nbsp; Youâ€™re with me\r\nDuke, so I aint worried about nothing.\r\n. . . .\r\nSo [the victim] said Step out a minute, let me holler at\r\nhim.\r\n So I look at her likeâ€”now Iâ€™m getting real angry\r\nwith [the victim], because, first of all, she donâ€™t have to belittle herself\r\nlike that, because like I said before, Iâ€™m giving you all these drugs. &nbsp;I\r\nhavenâ€™t asked you for nothing but keep it real.&nbsp; So thenâ€”\r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you say havenâ€™t\r\nasked for nothing, what do you mean?\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked her for no\r\nsex. . . . \r\n. . . . \r\nQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you said you donâ€™t\r\nhave to belittle yourself like this, what do you mean?\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what I was saying\r\nby belittling herself, she donâ€™t have to play herself to a low standing\r\njust to get what she want when she got somebody who going to get it for her. \r\n. . . . \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nâ€”I got out of the vehicle.&nbsp; I got out the passenger seat.&nbsp; When I\r\ngot out the passenger seat, Daddy got out the back seat and got in the front\r\nseat.&nbsp; I went and I stood to the back part of the vehicle.\r\n. . . .\r\n. . . I thought that all they was going to do was talk and\r\ntrade drugs.\r\nSo when I went back to the passenger side, now I see [the\r\nvictim] performing oral sex on Daddy.&nbsp; And when [the victim] is performing\r\noral sex on Daddy, I knocked on the window, and I did like this right here to\r\nher.&nbsp; (Demonstrating.)\r\nSo I walked back to the back part of the vehicle.&nbsp;\r\nWhen I walked back to the back part of the vehicle, thatâ€™s when I said, no, I aint going to let this go down like this right here,\r\nbecause, see, Iâ€™m the type of person that I get angry when thereâ€™s something going on that I donâ€™t like.Â  So I walk backâ€”\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Mr. Young, just talk about what happened.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir. \r\n. . . . \r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Did you stay and watch what happened?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I stayed to the back of the vehicle, because just like I say, I didnâ€™t want to leave her.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nGrant left their company, and Young and the victim continued to drive around together getting high.Â  Young testified that around five oâ€™clock a.m. the victim expressed she was not ready to return home.Â  \r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  And at this time we sat right there by the East Side Community Center and thatâ€™s when she said, I need to talk to you about something.Â  She said, I aint ready to go.Â  Not yet.\r\nI said, okay.Â  Whatâ€™s up?Â  So she like start crying.Â  So I said . . . look, I aint angry no more.\r\nBecause, see, like I told my lawyer, I hate to see a female cry.\r\n. . . . Â \r\nSo I said, . . . I aint angry at you no more . . . .\r\n. . . Iâ€™m going to make sure you all right, you know?\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â Â  \r\nYoung then averred:\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  So at this time [the victim] was like, I still want to do something for you.\r\nI said, okay.Â  What?\r\nSo she said, I want to have oral sex with you.\r\nSo I said . . . if that going to get you to chill out, quit crying and all that, do what you got to do.\r\nSo at this time when [the victim] went down on me, I was feeling bad.\r\n I said, no, . . . stop.Â  I said, stop.\r\nI said, because I canâ€™t get down like this right here.Â  If I going to argue at you behind us then Iâ€™ll be just as wrong if I allowed myself to let you go through his right here. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  \r\nFollowing Youngâ€™s direct examination the State argued that he opened the door to admission of his prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct and criminal domestic violence.Â  The trial judge found Young had placed a character trait in issue and allowed the State to impeach him with a 1994 conviction for criminal sexual conduct in the third degree and a 1993 conviction for criminal domestic violence.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, ___ S.C. ___, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 600 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Mattison, 352 S.C. at 583, 575 S.E.2d at 855.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Admissibility of Prior Convictions\r\nGenerally, evidence of a defendantâ€™s character is not admissible to show a propensity to act in conformity therewith; however, it is well settled that if a defendant places his character in issue, the State may offer evidence of the defendantâ€™s bad character.Â  See Rule 404(a)(1), SCRE (â€œEvidence of a personâ€™s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except: (1) Character of Accused.Â  Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same[.]â€).\r\nThe jurisprudence of this State contains a plethora of enlightening cases establishing and explicating the proposition that a defendant may open the door to what would otherwise be improper evidence.Â  For instance, State v. Allen, 266 S.C. 468, 224 S.E.2d 881 (1976), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), although it never uses the open door language, is often cited for the door-opening doctrine.Â  See, e.g., State v. Major, 301 S.C. 181, 391 S.E.2d 235 (1990); State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619 (1984); State v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 258 S.E.2d 896 (1979).Â  In Allen, the defendant, who was accused of kidnapping and murder, offered four good-character witnesses.Â  He then took the stand and described his past criminal activities.Â  The Allen court explained, â€œThe gist of his testimony was to show to the jury that, though he was admittedly an habitual criminal, none of his nefarious acts were committed with the use of force, so as to harm any person.â€Â  266 S.C. at 481, 224 S.E.2d at 886.Â  The court observed:Â  â€œBy presenting character witnesses, defendant placed his good character and general reputation in issue; by submitting evidence of his criminal past, with the admitted purpose of establishing his propensity for nonviolence, defendant placed this specific character trait in issue.â€Â  Id. at 481-82, 224 S.E.2d at 886. \r\nOn cross-examination, the solicitor questioned Allen about his convictions as well as prior acts of misconduct for which he had not been convicted.Â  Allen argued that inquiry into the wrongful acts was error.Â  The court disagreed:\r\n\r\nWe recognize certain exceptions to the general rule that an accusedâ€™s bad character may not be offered against him by the State.Â  One exception is where the accused takes the stand and thus becomes subject to impeachment, like any other witness.Â  The accused may thus be cross-examined about any of his past transactions tending to affect his credibility.Â  Taylor v. State, 258 S.C. 369, 188 S.E.2d 850 (1972).Â  Secondly, where the accused offers evidence of his good character, thereby putting his reputation in issue, he may be cross-examined on particular acts which manifestly bear reference to the trait of character covered by the charge in the indictment.Â  State v. Gibert, 196 S.C. 306, 13 S.E.2d 451 (1941).\r\n. . . .\r\nThus, the solicitor had the right to cross-examine the defendant with respect to conduct which reflected on his credibility as a witness and on the specific character trait involved in the crime charged.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 482-83, 224 S.E.2d at 886.\r\nIn State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984), the defendant was convicted of four counts of murder and five counts of kidnapping, as well as safecracking, assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, and contempt of court.Â  On appeal, he challenged the propriety of allowing the State to introduce testimony indicating Stroman had committed prior armed robberies.Â  Frank McDowell, an accomplice in the crimes, testified for the State.Â  On cross-examination, the defense asked McDowell whether he had ever broken into other homes for money.Â  McDowell admitted that he had.Â  On redirect, the State sought to further question McDowell as to two of the incidents in which Stroman had participated as well.Â  Over the defenseâ€™s objection, â€œThe trial judge ruled the â€˜door had been openedâ€™ to inquiry into appellantâ€™s participation in â€˜any crime that included a breaking into a buildingâ€™ or â€˜armed robbery or some stealing of money.â€™â€Â  Id. at 513, 316 S.E.2d at 399.Â  The supreme court agreed: â€œWhere one party introduces evidence as to a particular fact or transaction, the other party is entitled to introduce evidence in explanation or rebuttal thereof, even though [the] latter evidence would be incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.â€Â  Id. (alterations in original) (citing State v. Albert, 277 S.E.2d 439, 441 (N.C. 1981)).Â  The court held:\r\n\r\nOnce appellantâ€™s counsel initiated the questioning concerning McDowellâ€™s prior acts of theft, the State was free to question him as to the details of any prior crime involving the stealing of money.Â  The scope of redirect rests in the discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Tyner, 273 S.C. 646, 258 S.E.2d 559 (1979).Â  We hold the trial court properly admitted McDowellâ€™s testimony.\r\n\r\n281 S.C. at 513, 316 S.E.2d at 399.\r\nIn State v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 258 S.E.2d 896 (1979), the defendant was convicted of murder.Â  The State was allowed to elicit evidence of Dobyâ€™s prior convictions for trespassing in womenâ€™s restrooms.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court employed the open-door doctrine in finding the admission proper:\r\n\r\nAppellant next asserts error in allowing the solicitor to cross examine him and his psychiatric witnesses about appellantâ€™s two prior convictions for trespassing in public womenâ€™s restrooms, and in admitting a note he had left in one of those restrooms into evidence.Â  We hold that appellant opened the door to this cross examination by direct testimony regarding his passive character and lack of mature sexual desires. \r\n\r\nId. at 710, 258 S.E.2d at 899-900 (citations omitted).\r\nState v. Major, 301 S.C. 181, 391 S.E.2d 235 (1990), is an edifying opinion.Â  Major was convicted of distribution of crack cocaine.Â  The trial judge allowed the State to introduce a prior conviction for simple possession of cocaine after Major denied having ever used the drug.Â  The court found that Major had made a â€œclear attempt . . . to communicate to the jury that he [wa]s not the sort of individual who would become involved in the drug trade.â€Â  Therefore, â€œHaving introduced evidence of his own good character on the issue of involvement in drugs, Major thereby became subject to cross-examination on that assertion.â€Â  Id. at 185-86, 391 S.E.2d at 238.Â  \r\nState v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991), is another demonstration of the supreme courtâ€™s utilization of the door-opening theory.Â  Robinson allegedly hired members of El Rukn, a Chicago-based gang, to murder the victim.Â  The disputed evidence emanated from the solicitorâ€™s questioning Henry Harris, a member of El Rukn.Â  The court explained: â€œHarris testified that in the 1980â€™s he was in charge of drug operations for the organization.Â  He was subsequently asked when he first became acquainted with appellant and he answered â€œâ€™83 or â€™84.â€Â  Id. at 474, 409 S.E.2d at 408.Â  Appellant objected and moved for a mistrial on the ground Harrisâ€™ testimony linked appellant to drug dealing.Â  After finding that the testimony did not imply appellant was involved in drug dealing, the court addressed the open-door doctrine:\r\n\r\nFurther, appellant was the first to bring out the El Ruknâ€™s involvement in drug dealing.Â  A previous witness, gang member Eugene Hunter, testified appellant was a friend of Jeff Fort, the head of El Rukns, and was assisting the El Rukns in establishing a legitimate business.Â  On cross-examination, appellant elicited testimony from Hunter that El Rukns were involved in drug dealing.Â  Since appellant opened the door to this evidence, he cannot complain of prejudice from its admission.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 474, 409 S.E.2d at 408 (citation omitted).\r\nState v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 518 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 1999), involved a conviction of transfer of recorded sounds for pirating videotapes.Â  The defense questioned expert Beasley whether he had performed a particular type of test, a switch point test, in order to determine the authenticity of allegedly pirated videos.Â  Beasley had not performed the test.Â  The defense then questioned expert Bowley about the switch point test.Â  Although Bowley had not conducted the test, he stated that he could arrange to perform the test in court.Â  Over the defenseâ€™s objection, Bowley was allowed to perform the test on two tapes, both of which he determined were counterfeits.Â  This Court concluded:\r\n\r\nBeam cannot complain about the admission of evidence where he opened the door to the evidence.Â  See State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991) (where appellant opened door to evidence, he cannot complain of prejudice from its admission); State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (appellant cannot complain of prejudice from admission of evidence if he opened the door to its admission).Â  Further, when a party introduces evidence about a particular matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.Â  State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984).Â  A party may not complain of error caused by his own conduct.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n336 S.C. at 53, 518 S.E.2d at 301.\r\nIn State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1999), the trial court allowed the State to introduce the defendantâ€™s prior criminal domestic violence convictions due to his opening the door to such evidence.Â  The defendant stipulated he killed his wife by strangling her with a t-shirt.Â  However, he denied the killing was murder.Â  Taylor took the stand and stated that â€œthings had kind of gotten rough for us the last couple of years . . . .â€Â  Id. at 172, 508 S.E.2d at 877.Â  On cross-examination, the State brought out an eight-year-old conviction for criminal domestic violence to rebut Taylorâ€™s assertion that things were rough â€œthe last couple of years.â€ \r\nTaylor contended the judge erred by allowing the solicitor to impeach him with a prior conviction for criminal domestic violence.Â  The court disagreed and noted:\r\n\r\nAn â€œaccused may be cross-examined as to all matters which he himself has brought up on direct examination.â€Â  98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 515 at 439 (1957); State v. Allen, 266 S.C. 468, 224 S.E.2d 881 (1976), citing 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 378 at 134-135 (â€œ[a]s a general rule, any matter is proper subject of cross-examination which is responsive to testimony given on direct examination, or which is material or relevant thereto, and which tends to elucidate, modify, explain, contradict or rebut testimony given in chief by the witness.â€). The cross-examination of matters which were addressed in direct-examination is not objectionable, even if the answers affect a witness' credibility and character.Â  98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 378.\r\n\r\nÂ  Id. at 174-75, 508 S.E.2d at 878 (footnote omitted).\r\nFurther, the Taylor court found:\r\n\r\n[T]his testimony did not place appellantâ€™s character in issue.Â  However, because appellant â€œopened the doorâ€ about his relationship with his wife, the solicitor was entitled to cross-examine him about the relationship, even if the responses brought out appellantâ€™s prior criminal domestic violence conviction.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 175, 508 S.E.2d at 878 (footnote and citations omitted).\r\nThe doctrine of opening the door was used by this Court in State v. Knighton, 334 S.C. 125, 512 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Knighton was arrested and convicted for driving under the influence.Â Â  Knighton testified on direct examination that Charleston and Greenville law enforcement made videotaping tests available to DUI arrestees, whereas his request for a videotape from Orangeburg was refused because they lacked the equipment.Â  The solicitor questioned Knighton on how he knew the other counties used video equipment.Â  The trial judge instructed the witness not to answer the question, and Knighton moved for a mistrial.Â  The court held: \r\n\r\nThough there was the potential for prejudicial testimony to have been submitted to the jury, the trial judge prevented any prejudice by instructing Knighton not to answer the solicitorâ€™s question. Further, appellant himself opened the door to this inference by testifying about his knowledge of videotaping offered to DUI suspects in two other counties.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nId. at 134, 512 S.E.2d at 112. \r\nIn State v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 579 S.E.2d 318 (2003), Dunlap was convicted for distribution of crack cocaine.Â  During opening statements, counsel for Dunlap professed that the defendant had â€œbeen in trouble with the lawâ€ and was â€œhooked on crack and had a problem with it,â€ but â€œnever sold it.â€Â  Id. at 541, 579 S.E.2d at 319.Â  Based on these statements, the State was able to introduce Dunlapâ€™s prior convictions for conspiracy to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute; distribution of an imitation drug; simple possession of marijuana; and shoplifting.Â  The Dunlap court explicated:\r\n\r\nThe opening statement created the impression that petitioner had no prior connection to the sale of narcotics.Â  In reality, petitioner was not a mere drug user, but an individual who sought to â€˜elevateâ€™ his status to that of a drug dealer. . . .Â  We therefore agree . . . that petitionerâ€™s counsel opened the door to the introduction of evidence rebutting the contention that petitioner was merely an addict.\r\n\r\nId. at 541, 579 S.E.2d at 319 (citations omitted).\r\nMoreover, the court found an analysis under Rule 609, SCRE, unnecessary:\r\n\r\nBecause we find that counsel opened the door to the admission of petitionerâ€™s prior drug record, we need not reach the issue whether these convictions were admissible to impeach petitionerâ€™s credibility under Rule 609, [SCRE]. \r\n\r\nId. at 542, 579 S.E.2d at 320.\r\nIn the case of State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004), Curtis was convicted of two counts of the sale of urine with the intent to defraud a drug or alcohol test.Â  At trial, both Curtis and his webmaster testified that Curtisâ€™s website did not contain pornographic material, or links to websites containing pornographic material.Â  On cross-examination, the State questioned Curtis about pornographic links and demonstrated, in court, how pornography indirectly could be accessed through links on pages linked to Curtisâ€™s page.Â  Curtis argued that this inquiry was irrelevant and misleading.Â  However, the court held:Â  â€œGiven that both Curtis and Turner maintained that PPS did not allow pornographic materials or links on the website, it is patent that they opened the door to this line of inquiry.â€Â  Id. at 632, 591 S.E.2d at 605 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nState v. McIntosh, 358 S.C. 432, 595 S.E.2d 484 (2004), discusses the door-opening doctrine in the context of a Doyle violation, ultimately concluding the doctrine did not apply to the facts of McIntosh.Â  At issue was the solicitorâ€™s questioning the defendant â€œat length about his failure to present his alibi defense to police after he was arrested and given the Miranda warnings.â€Â  Id. at 444, 595 S.E.2d at 490.Â  The court observed:\r\n\r\nThe State correctly explains other courts have held a defendant may open the door to cross-examination for impeachment purposes by testifying or creating the impression through his defense presentation he has cooperated with police when, in fact, he has not.Â  Such cross-examination is permissible, as the Supreme Court recognized in Doyle by noting a prosecutor may challenge a defendantâ€™s contention he told his exculpatory story to police when he actually did not.\r\n\r\n358 S.C. at 445, 595 S.E.2d at 491 (citations omitted).Â  However, the court found that McIntosh â€œdid not open the door to any Doyle violationâ€ because he â€œdid not, explicitly or implicitly, assert he cooperated with police.â€Â  Id.  \r\nState v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 605 S.E.2d 540 (2004), involves a defendant convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping.Â  At trial, Cole Badger, a psychotherapist who counseled the victim and was qualified as an expert, testified for the State.Â  White argued that Badger was improperly allowed to testify that she believed the victim.Â  The court concluded, â€œWhite opened the door to this testimony by cross-examining Badger as to whether she had cases in which she did not believe the alleged victim.Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (2003) (one who opens the door to evidence cannot complain of its admission).â€Â  White at 415-16; 605 S.E.2d at 544.Â  \r\nA number of additional arbitraments are extant wherein South Carolina courts have addressed the door-opening doctrine.Â  See State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (2003) (finding Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE is the sole means by which a prior consistent statement may be introduced and therefore, the Stateâ€™s argument that defendant opened the door to the prior consistent statement, while it may have been proper under pre-SCRE law, is simply not tenable under the SCRE); State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d 845 (1997) (determining testimony that witness gave defendant drugs proper to rebut prior witnessâ€™s testimony that implied defendant was adamantly opposed to drugs); State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 45, 282 S.E.2d 838, 844 (1981) (holding where â€œ[d]efense counsel asked Agent Powell on cross-examination whether the plastic was common place [sic] or specially made[, the] question opened the door for Powellâ€™s response that it was used inside the aircraft to set bales of marijuana on.â€); State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 7, 313 S.E. 2d 619, 623 (1984) (finding no abuse of discretion where defense offered testimony of an expert who disclosed defendantâ€™s juvenile offenses whereupon the State inquired into defendantâ€™s adult offenses and escape; the defense, while objecting to the inquiry, admitted that â€œthe â€˜doorâ€™ had been â€˜openedâ€™â€ to the testimony); State v. Bell, 263 S.C. 239,Â  209 S.E.2d 890 (1974) (ruling that evidence that victim had reported her watch as stolen was proper where defendant averred the victim had given the watch to him); State v. Spinks, 260 S.C. 404, 407-08, 196 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1973) (â€œThe appellant in answer to the question of his counsel, â€˜What chargeâ€™, introduced into record the testimony regarding the prior crimes for which he was sentenced, and in so doing, â€˜opened the doorâ€™ to all crimes for which he was incarcerated, including the crime of carrying a concealed weapon.â€); State v. Kennedy, 143 S.C. 318, 141 S.E. 755 (1928) (finding the trial court properly permitted the State to question victim on the details of previous difficulties victim had with defendant where defendant had first questioned the victim on the details of the prior difficulties); State v. Bramlett, 114 S.C. 389, 103 S.E. 755 (1920) (ruling the State may offer rebutting evidence of the defendantâ€™s familyâ€™s reputation for insanity where defendant offers evidence of his familyâ€™s reputation for insanity); State v. Marks, 70 S.C. 448, 50 S.E. 14 (1905) (mentioning the opening the door theory); State v. Trotter, 317 S.C. 411, 415, 453 S.E.2d 905, 908 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Benton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Boden, 310 S.C. 400, 426 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1993) for the proposition that â€œthere is no error in admitting evidence where the appellant opened the door to the evidenceâ€) affâ€™d as modified by State v. Trotter, 322 S.C. 537, 473 S.E.2d 452 (1996). \r\nAdverting to the case sub judice, Youngâ€™s testimony is replete with statements that connote character traits antithetical to the character evinced by his prior convictions of criminal domestic violence and criminal sexual conduct.Â  Most poignant is his statement: â€œlike I told my lawyer, I hate to see a female cry.â€Â  Yet the denouement of this case need not hang on the lone phrase â€œI hate to see a female cryâ€; throughout his testimony, Young characterized himself as a benefactor and protector of women generally and of the victim particularly.Â  His testimony demonstrates a concerted attempt to paint himself as a gallant man with the victimâ€™s best interest and safety always on his mind.Â  \r\nYoung testified he told the other drug dealers, â€œI donâ€™t want nobody bothering her,â€ and he told the victim to â€œlock your windows . . . . Donâ€™t talk to nobody.â€Â  He expanded his expressions of concern for the victim to all women when he asseverated: â€œI hate to see a female cry.â€Â  In addition to these physical and emotional concerns, Young related disquietude over the victimâ€™s chastity, saying she should not have to â€œbelittleâ€ herself, and telling her he would be â€œjust as wrong if I allowed myself to let you go through this right here [perform sexual favors on him].â€\r\nBecause Young set before the jury his concern for the victimâ€™s safety and chastity, the State was entitled to rebut his assertions with evidence of his prior abuse and the criminal results of his concupiscence.Â  Young opened the door to the convictions for criminal domestic violence and criminal sexual conduct.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Racially Biased Comments\r\nYoung claims the trial court erred in allowing the solicitor to ask Young racially inflammatory questions.Â  During cross-examination of Young, the State asked, â€œMr. Young, isnâ€™t it also true that you like going out and being with white women?â€Â  Young admitted that he has a child with a Caucasian woman.Â  The State then asked Young if he â€œprefer[ed] being with white women.â€Â  \r\nWe find this argument is not preserved for our review.Â  The lack of a contemporaneous objection to an improper argument acts as a wavier, except where a â€œvicious, inflammatory argument results in clear prejudice.â€Â  Toyota of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 263, 442 S.E.2d 611, 615 (1994).Â  While the Toyota court did not condone a failure to make a contemporaneous objection, it found it â€œwholly unreasonable for any attorney to anticipateâ€ flagrant, abhorrent conduct towards a party or witness.Â  Id.Â  However, the issue must be raised to the trial court by way of a post-trial motion.Â  Dial v. Niggel Assoc., Inc., 333 S.C. 253, 257, 509 S.E.2d 269, 271 (1998).Â  Because Young did not make a contemporaneous objection and did not present the issue during a post-trial motion, this issue is not preserved.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, Youngâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs.\r\nSHORT, J., dissents in a separate opinion.Â  \r\nSHORT, J., dissenting:Â  I respectfully dissent regarding the issue of whether the trial court erred in admitting Youngâ€™s prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct and criminal domestic violence.\r\nIn a criminal case, the State cannot attack the defendantâ€™s character unless the defendant first places his or her own character in issue.Â  State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 174, 508 S.E.2d 870, 877-878 (1998).Â  â€œWhen the accused offers evidence of his good character regarding specific character traits relevant to the crime charged, the solicitor has the right to cross-examine him as to particular bad acts or conduct.â€Â  State v. Major, 301 S.C. 181, 185, 391 S.E.2d 235, 238 (1990).Â  However, the State is restricted to showing bad character only for the traits initially focused on by the accused.Â  Id.Â  Also, â€œwhere prior convictions or misconduct are appropriately brought out on cross-examination, the State may inquire only so far as to bring out the nature of the conviction or activity and may not go into details.â€Â  State v. Allen, 266 S.C. 468, 482, 224 S.E.2d 881, 886 (1976), overruled on other grounds by State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 415 S.E.2d 816 (1992), and State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nWhen the prior crime is similar to the one for which the defendant is being tried, the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from impeachment by that prior offense weighs against its admission.Â  State v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 542, 579 S.E.2d 318, 320 (2003).Â  Thus, the trial court must consider the impeachment value of the prior crime, the timing of the prior crime, the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime, the importance of the defendantâ€™s testimony, and the centrality of the credibility issue.Â  Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433-34, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000).Â  In determining whether similar prior convictions can be used to impeach the accused, the trial court must weigh the probative value of the prior convictions against their prejudicial effect to the accused and determine, in its discretion, whether to admit the evidence.Â  Id.; Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE.\r\nDuring an in camera hearing, the trial judge ruled the probative value of admitting Youngâ€™s previous conviction for criminal sexual conduct was outweighed by its prejudicial value and allowed the prosecution to proceed by stating only that there was another felony for which Young had been convicted.Â  The prosecution did not raise Youngâ€™s prior conviction for criminal domestic violence to the judge during the hearing, so the judge did not rule on its admission.Â  After his direct examination, the State argued that Young had placed his character in issue with his statements insinuating that he was concerned about the victimâ€™s well-being, particularly in the following testimony:\r\n\r\nÂ . . . and thatâ€™s when she said, I need to talk to you about something.Â  She said, I ainâ€™t ready to go.Â  Not yet.Â  I said, okay. Â Whatâ€™s up?Â  So she like start crying.Â  So I said [victimâ€™s name], look, I ainâ€™t angry no more.Â  Because, see, like I told my lawyer, I hate to see a female cry.Â  So I said, all right.Â  I ainâ€™t angry no more.Â  I ainâ€™t angry no more.Â  Itâ€™s all good.Â  I ainâ€™t angry no more. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The State further contended that Young placed his character in issue by testifying that he was angry at the victim because â€œshe donâ€™t have to belittle herself like thatâ€ by performing oral sex on the other drug dealer and by testifying that he told her he was â€œgoing to make sure [she was] all right.â€Â  The trial judge determined that Youngâ€™s testimony had opened the door by injecting a character trait in issue and allowed the State to impeach the defendant with his prior criminal convictions for a 1994 criminal sexual conduct 3rd degree and a 1993 criminal domestic violence. \r\nAfter carefully reviewing Youngâ€™s testimony, I find he did not place his character in issue and, therefore, did not open the door for admitting into evidence his prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct 3rd degree and criminal domestic violence.Â  Young testified he sold drugs to the victim; however, he denied kidnapping or criminally assaulting her.Â  Youngâ€™s testimony, when considered in proper context, did not connote specific character traits toward his treatment of females, but rather described and explained his version of what transpired between the victim and himself on the night in question.\r\nI now address the question of whether the error was harmless, which necessarily depends on the particular circumstances of any case.Â  â€œError is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  â€œError which substantially damages the defendantâ€™s credibility cannot be held harmless where such credibility is essential to his defense.â€Â  Id.Â  Young was on trial for criminal sexual conduct 1st degree and kidnapping.Â  The trial jury could have concluded that Young had a greater propensity to commit a crime of a sexual nature because of his prior convictions for criminal sexual conduct 3rd degree and criminal domestic violence.Â  Id.Â  Whether Young committed the offenses of criminal sexual conduct 1st degree and kidnapping in this case essentially boils down to the conflicting testimony of the victim and Young himself.Â  Because of the credibility issue in this case, the erroneous admission of Youngâ€™s prior convictions for similar offenses cannot be found to be harmless error, and, therefore, I would reverse and remand Youngâ€™s conviction for criminal sexual conduct 1st degree and kidnapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3984","title":"Martasin v.

Martasin (Mrs. Martasin) brought wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering claims against three physicians (and related corporate health care entities), alleging they committed medical malpractice in negligently failing to treat and prevent the fatal side effects of a cancer treatment administered to her husband, Edwin S. Martasin (Mr. Martasin).Â  At trial, the circuit court entered a directed verdict in favor of all the defendants on the grounds Mrs. Martasin failed to present sufficient evidence to prove to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the alleged negligence â€œmost probablyâ€ caused her husbandâ€™s deathâ€”the required burden of proof in such medical malpractice cases.Â  We affirm the directed verdict as to Defendant Dr. Frank L. Hart and reverse with respect to Defendants Dr. Paul M. Long and Dr. Gary W. Thomas.Â  Additionally, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict on Mrs. Martasinâ€™s claim for punitive damages.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMr. Martasinâ€™s Disease and Medical Treatment\r\nThis appeal concerns the medical treatment Mr. Martasin received from the three defendant physicians (respondents here) during the time immediately after he was initially diagnosed with a form of blood cancer leukemia.Â  The relevant undisputed facts are as follows.\r\nOn Monday, December 4, 1995, Mr. Martasin sought treatment at the emergency room of Hilton Head Hospital for persistent headaches, fever, and fatigue.Â  Mr. Martasin was examined by Dr. Paul Long, an internal medicine specialist.Â  After his initial examination, Dr. Long decided to admit Mr. Martasin to the hospital for further tests.Â  Based on the initial test results, Dr. Long suspected Mr. Martasin had some form of the blood cancer leukemia.Â  Dr. Long called in Dr. Gary Thomas, an oncologist, for consultation.Â  Dr. Thomas examined Mr. Martasin and performed additional tests.Â  Dr. Thomas concluded that Mr. Martasinâ€™s clinical presentation was consistent with leukemia.Â  The doctors ordered more sophisticated blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. \r\nOn Thursday, December 7, 1995, Dr. Thomas determined that Mr. Martasin should immediately begin a course of treatment to counteract the effects of the cancer.Â  Mr. Martasin was given a prescription for the drug Prednisone to be taken daily. Later that day, he was discharged from the hospital with instructions to return to see Dr. Thomas the following Monday, December 11th.Â  Mr. Martasin left the hospital, filled the prescription for the Prednisone, and took the medication as instructed. \r\nWhile Mr. Martasin was at home, the doctors arranged for a home health care nurse to check in on him each day.Â  When the nurse visited on Saturday, December 9th, Mr. Martasinâ€™s condition had noticeably worsened.Â  The nurse paged Dr. Long, who responded by telephone, speaking directly with Mrs. Martasin.Â  Dr. Long declined to see Mr. Martasin that day, but he instructed Mrs. Martasin to take her husband back to the emergency room where Dr. Frank Hart, Dr. Longâ€™s medical practice associate, would meet them.Â  At the hospital, Dr. Hart examined Mr. Martasin and performed blood, urine and other tests.Â  Dr. Hart informed Mr. Martasin that the examination and laboratory test results did not indicate a change in his condition that would warrant readmitting him to the hospital.Â  Dr. Hart instructed the Martasins to return home and to keep their appointment with Dr. Thomas scheduled for the following Monday. \r\nWhen Mr. Martasin returned for his Monday appointment, Dr. Thomas found his condition had deteriorated substantially since his initial discharge from the hospital.Â  That evening, Mr. Martasin was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at the Medical University of South Carolina, where he lapsed into unconsciousness and died the next morning, December 12. \r\nDr. Lawrence Afrin, an oncologist at MUSC who examined Mr. Martasin, concluded Mr. Martasin was suffering from a condition known as â€œTumor Lysis Syndromeâ€ (TLS) when he arrived at MUSC.Â Â  Furthermore, the pathologist who performed the autopsy on Mr. Martasin reported that her findings as to the cause of death were clinically consistent with TLS.Â  \r\nAs described in the undisputed portions of the medical testimony, TLS is a serious, yet predictable, complication that arises when treating cancer with certain medications.Â  Treatments such as Prednisone work to attack the cancer cells in the body.Â  As the dead cells are broken down by the body, the chemicals in the cells are released into the bloodstream.Â  TLS occurs when these chemical by-products are released in quantities that overwhelm the bodyâ€™s ability to restore the proper chemical balance in the blood.Â  If a patient is at risk of TLS, the treating physician can prescribe certain prophylactic measures that will flush out the harmful chemicals in the bloodstream and aid the body in regulating the chemical balance in the blood.Â  Failure to properly institute these prophylactic measures can lead to the death of a patient suffering from TLS. \r\nThis Action\r\nAs personal representative of her husbandâ€™s estate, Mrs. Martasin filed suit against Dr. Long, Dr. Thomas, and Dr. Hart, as well as the physiciansâ€™ medical practices, alleging they were negligent in failing to treat and prevent the side effects of Mr. Martasinâ€™s TLS.Â  At trial, Mrs. Martasin offered expert testimony to establish the negligence of these physicians proximately caused the death of her husband.Â  At the close of the evidence, all three doctors moved for a directed verdict claiming the expert testimony failed to establish that the alleged deviation from the standard of care proximately caused Mr. Martasinâ€™s death to â€œa reasonable degree of medical certainty.â€Â  The circuit court granted the motion for directed verdict with respect to all three doctors and the corresponding corporate defendants, finding Mrs. Martasin did not establish the conduct of the doctors â€œmost probablyâ€ resulted in the death of Edwin Martasin.Â  Also, the circuit court directed a verdict denying Mrs. Martasinâ€™s claim for punitive damages.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the court must view the evidence and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995); Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365-66, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the jury.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Directed Verdict On Negligence Claims\r\nThe primary issue in this appeal is whether Mrs. Martasin presented sufficient evidence to establish the defendant physicians breached the applicable standard of care and that breach proximately caused her husbandâ€™s death.Â  To prove these critical components of her negligence claim, Mrs. Martasin relied on the testimony of medical experts, particularly the testimony of Dr. Mansoor N. Saleh.Â  After careful review of the evidentiary record, especially Dr. Salehâ€™s testimony, we find there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude the alleged acts of Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas in treating Mr. Martasin deviated from the standard of care and were a proximate cause of the death of Mr. Martasin.Â  The directed verdict granted in favor of these two physicians, therefore, should not have been granted.Â  We reach a different conclusion with regard to Dr. Hart.Â  Viewing the evidence as a whole, we are unable to find sufficient evidence to establish any act or omission by Dr. Hart proximately caused Mr. Martasinâ€™s death.Â  The directed verdict in favor of Dr. Hart shall, therefore, stand. \r\nA plaintiff in a medical malpractice case must establish by expert testimony both the standard of care and the defendantâ€™s failure to conform to the required standard, unless the subject matter is of common knowledge or experience so that no special learning is needed to evaluate the defendantâ€™s conduct. Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 254, 487 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1997).Â  â€œIn addition to proving the defendant negligent, the plaintiff must also prove that the defendantâ€™s negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury.â€ Carver v. Med. Socâ€™y of S.C., 286 S.C. 347, 350, 334 S.E.2d 125, 127 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Our supreme court has articulated the burden of proof borne by plaintiffs in proving proximate cause in medical malpractice cases:\r\n\r\nNegligence is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the injury complained of, and negligence may be deemed a proximate cause only when without such negligence the injury would not have occurred or could have been avoided.Â  When one relies solely upon the opinion of medical experts to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence and the injury, the experts must, with reasonable certainty, state that in their professional opinion, the injuries complained of most probably resulted from the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  The reason for this rule is the highly technical nature of malpractice litigation.Â  Since many malpractice suits involve ailments and treatments outside the realm of ordinary lay knowledge, expert testimony is generally necessary.Â  \r\n\r\nEllis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 125, 473 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1996) (citations omitted and emphasis added).Â  Therefore, the expert testimony as to proximate cause must provide a significant causal link between the alleged negligence and the injuries suffered, rather than a tenuous and hypothetical connection.Â  Id.\r\nHowever, in determining whether particular evidence meets the â€œmost probablyâ€ test, it is not necessary that the testifying expert actually use the words â€œmost probably.â€Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel., 306 S.C. 101, 111, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991); see also Gamble v. Price, 289 S.C. 538, 544, 347 S.E.2d 131, 132-33 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding the exact words â€œmost probablyâ€ need not be used by the expert).Â  The Baughman court held:\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient for the expert to testify merely that the ailment might or could have resulted from the alleged cause.Â  He must go further and testify that taking into consideration all the data it is his professional opinion that the result in question most probably came from the cause alleged.Â  In determining whether particular evidence meets this test it is not necessary that the expert actually use the words â€œmost probably.â€Â  It is sufficient that the testimony is such â€œas to judicially impress that the opinion . . . represents his professional judgment as to the most likely one among the possible causes.â€\r\n\r\nBaughman, 306 S.C. at 111, 410 S.E.2d at 543 (citations omitted).\r\nA.Â  Â Â Â  Alleged Negligence of Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas\r\nMrs. Martasin relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. Saleh to establish the failure of Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas to treat the TLS was a breach of the standard of care that resulted in the death of Mr. Martasin.Â  \r\nDr. Saleh testified it was a deviation from the standard of care not to prophylax Mr. Martasin against TLS when administering Prednisone as treatment for leukemia.Â  Dr. Saleh testified:\r\n\r\nIt is a written law of oncology that any tumor that is sensitive to chemotherapy, there is a propensity of killing the cell very rapidly, that you have to prophylax the patient against the effect of killing the tumor . . . [t]hat kills the malignant cells but the product of cell death results in liver shutdown, kidney shutdown, heart failure . . . . If you treat the patient for that condition, with this amount of tumor burden, you have to prophylax the patient.\r\n\r\nDr. Saleh emphasized the need to take prophylactic measures against the build-up of toxins when you prescribe a patient Prednisone, and, importantly, testified this would be the standard of care for an oncologist as well as a doctor practicing â€œgeneral internal medicine.â€ [1]Â Â  Dr. Saleh explained:\r\n\r\n[T]umor lysis prophylaxis is instituted by my residents, first year residents, even by medical students.Â  This is internal medicine therapy.Â  It does not require an oncologist.Â  The oncologist may treat the patient for the treatment of the malignancy but tumor lysis prophylaxis . . . is general internal medicine.Â  In fact, there are board questions that ask internists to say what would you do in a patient getting leukemic therapy for his high white count; you have a high white count, what would you do.Â  And the answer is tumor lysis prophylax.Â  \r\n\r\nBased on his review of the pertinent medical records, Dr. Saleh concluded that the cause of Mr. Martasinâ€™s death was the TLS that occurred as a result of the Prednisone being administered without necessary prophylactic measures being instituted. Admittedly, Dr. Saleh did not use the magic words â€œmost probably,â€ but the entirety of the evidence persuades us that Mrs. Martasin presented sufficient evidence to withstand the directed verdict motion with respect to Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas.Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mrs. Martasin as we must, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found as fact that Mr. Martasinâ€™s death was most probably the result of the Prednisone treatment that Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas implemented without taking appropriate measures to treat the TLS.Â  The order of the circuit court granting a directed verdict in favor of these two physicians is reversed, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.Â  Additionally, our ruling reversing the directed verdict as to these two individual defendants extends to the corresponding corporate defendants plaintiff claimed were vicariously liable for Dr. Longâ€™s and Dr. Thomasâ€™s alleged negligence.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Proof of Causal Link to the Alleged Negligence of Dr. Hart\r\nAs noted above, Dr. Frank Hart was the physician who examined Mr. Martasin when he returned to Hilton Head Hospital on Saturday, December 9th, after the initial discharge by Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas two days earlier.Â  Dr. Hart concluded it was not necessary to admit Mr. Martisan to the hospital at that time.Â  Mrs. Martasin claims there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude the failure of Dr. Hart to admit her husband to the hospital that Saturday and implement prophylaxis for the TLS was a proximate cause of her husbandâ€™s death.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPlaintiffâ€™s expert, Dr. Saleh, was asked about Dr. Hartâ€™s examination of Mr. Martasin on Saturday, December 9th and whether Mr. Martasinâ€™s death could have been prevented had Dr. Hart admitted him to the hospital that day and begun immediate prophylactic measures to counteract the TLS.Â  Though the transcript reveals some confusion in Dr. Salehâ€™s initial attempt to respond to this line of questioning, defense counsel asked for and received clarification:\r\n\r\nDR. SALEH: . . . If you have not prophylaxed and you get into the acute setting, the odds are less.Â  But thereâ€™s still one in three chance you can salvage the patient in that setting, yes.Â  \r\n\r\nTherefore, according to Dr. Salehâ€™s expert opinion, there was only a â€œone in three chanceâ€ Mr. Martasinâ€™s fatal TLS could have been prevented had Dr. Hart admitted Mr. Martasin on Saturday, December 9th and initiated immediate prophylactic measures.Â  This assessment fails to establish the causal link required under South Carolina law to recover for medical negligence.\r\nWe first note that our supreme court has expressly declined to adopt the â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine, which, in the context of medical malpractice, â€œpermits a recovery when the delay in proper diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition results in the patient being deprived of a less than even chance of surviving or recovering.â€Â  Jones v. Owings, 318 S.C. 72, 75, 456 S.E.2d 371, 373 (1995).Â  In rejecting the doctrine, the supreme court stated, â€œWe consider the better rule to be that in order to comport with the standard of proof of proximate cause, plaintiff in a malpractice case must prove that defendantâ€™s negligence, in probability, proximately caused the death.â€ Id. at 76, 456 S.E.2d at 373 (emphasis in original).\r\nMore recently, in Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 534 S.E.2d 295 (Ct. App. 2000), this court had the opportunity to determine whether evidence which demonstrates the negligence of a physician in failing to diagnose the decedent, who would have had a greater than fifty percent chance of survival except for the negligence of the doctor, satisfies the â€œmost probablyâ€ standard.Â  We held that, when an individual would have had a greater than fifty percent chance of survival if the physician had properly advised the decedent at an earlier time, evidence of the failure to do so satisfies the â€œmost probablyâ€ requirement for causation. Id. at 495, 534 S.E.2d at 300.\r\nIn the instant case, Dr. Salehâ€™s testimony demonstrates that Mr. Martasin would not have had a greater than fifty percent chance of survival if the TLS had been recognized and treated on December 9, 1995.Â  Indeed, the testimony makes plainâ€”in clear, quantitative termsâ€”that Dr. Hartâ€™s decision not to admit Mr. Martasin to the hospital deprived him of roughly a thirty percent chance of survival.Â  The survival chances articulated in this expert assessment therefore fall well short of satisfying the â€œmost probablyâ€ causation standard.Â  Moreover, a thorough review of the record reveals no other evidence that would tend to establish that Dr. Hartâ€™s actions contributed in any material way to Mr. Martasinâ€™s death.Â  \r\nFinding no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude the alleged negligent acts or omissions of Dr. Hart proximately caused Mr. Martasinâ€™s death, we conclude the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict in favor of Dr. Hart was proper.Â  Our ruling extends as well to any of the corporate defendants Mrs. Martasin claimed were vicariously liable for Dr. Hartâ€™s alleged negligence.\r\nII. Punitive Damages\r\nMrs. Martasin argues the circuit court erred in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion for directed verdict on her claim for punitive damages.Â  We agree.\r\nIn any civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (2005). Punitive damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights. Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 221, 479 S.E.2d 35, 46 (1996); Lister v. NationsBank of Delaware, 329 S.C. 133, 149, 494 S.E.2d 449, 458 (Ct. App. 1997). â€œThe issue of punitive damages must be submitted to the jury if more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence as to whether the defendantâ€™s behavior was reckless, willful, or wanton.â€ Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 301, 536 S.E.2d 408, 419 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nWithout repeating the relevant testimony already discussed above, and viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mrs. Martasin, there is some evidence that the decision by Dr. Long and Dr. Thomas to prescribe Prednisone without instituting prophylactic measures to prevent the TLS was a breach of the most basic standard of care such as to give rise to a reasonable inference that this decision rose to the level of recklessness.Â  Therefore, the issue as to whether these alleged negligent acts were reckless was properly a question for the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude that Dr. Longâ€™s and Dr. Thomasâ€™s failure to treat the TLS was a breach of the applicable standard of care that proximately caused Mr. Martasinâ€™s death.Â  We therefore reverse the directed verdict granted in favor of these two defendants and the corresponding corporate entities.Â  With respect to Dr. Hart, we find there was not sufficient evidence proving his alleged negligence proximately caused Mr. Martasinâ€™s death.Â  The directed verdict granted to him and the corresponding corporate defendants is therefore affirmed.Â  Finally, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s grant of directed verdict on Mrs. Martasinâ€™s claim for punitive damages.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  In granting the directed verdict, the circuit court noted that Dr. Salehâ€™s expert testimony was deficient because he failed to differentiate between the appropriate standard of care applicable to an oncologist (such as Dr. Thomas) versus the standard applicable to a physician who does not specialize in cancer treatment (such as Dr. Long).Â  This distinction, however, is not germane in the present case in light of Dr. Salehâ€™s testimony that the need to prophylax against TLS is basic medical knowledge, known to physicians practicing general internal medicine as well as oncologistsâ€”even â€œfirst year residentsâ€ and â€œmedical students.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3985","title":"Brewer v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\nÂ Gerald C. Smoak, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  3985\r\nHeard March 9, 2005 â€“ Filed May 2, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCosta Steven Moskos, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nSusan Corner Rosen, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This appeal arises after summary judgment was granted to Stokes Kia, Isuzu, Subaru, Inc., in a claim for breach of contract, conversion, and violation of certain consumer protection laws brought by a purchaser whose car had been repossessed in what was alleged to have been a yo-yo sale.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn January 2000, Rebecca Brewerâ€™s automobile quit running, and she began shopping for another car.Â  Brewer visited two car dealerships before visiting Stokes Kia.Â  At both of the prior dealerships, Brewer was unable to purchase a car because of her poor credit rating.Â  When Brewer arrived at Stokes Kia and explained her price range, she was shown a 1996 Ford Aspire, which she agreed to purchase.Â  The salesman completed a handwritten buyerâ€™s order, which was signed by Brewer and initialed by the Stokes Kia sales manager.Â  This buyerâ€™s order specified the car to be purchased, the price, and memorialized the acceptance of a one thousand dollar down payment from Brewer for the car.Â  \r\nNext, Brewer met with the Stokes Kia finance manager.Â  The finance manager had her sign a new buyerâ€™s order that had been computer-generated and was stamped â€œVEHICLE DELIVERED SUBJECT TO CREDIT APPROVAL.â€Â  Brewer initialed beside the stamped language.Â  Brewer also signed a retail installment sales contract and security agreement.Â  The retail installment sales contract lists the amount financed for the purchase of the car, $6,609.50; the name of the seller, Stokes Kia-Isuzu Subaru; the annual percentage rate, 21.95%; the number of payments, 36; amount of payments, $252.24; and when the monthly payments begin, February 10, 2000.Â  This form was not signed by a representative of Stokes Kia.Â  Additionally, Brewer signed a bailment agreement.Â  The bailment agreement states: â€œIf dealer is able to provide the Buyer(s) with financing according to the terms set forth in the Sales Agreement, the said Sales Agreement shall be binding upon Buyer(s) and enforceable by Dealer.Â  In the event dealer is unable to provide financing Buyer(s) shall provide their own financing.â€Â  It also says: Â â€œPending credit approval of the Buyer(s) by the financing institution and completion of the sales transaction, delivery of said vehicle by the Dealer is hereby made to Buyer(s) as a convenience to Buyer(s) . . . .â€Â  Brewer admitted nobody at Stokes Kia told her financing had been approved, but she also testified no one had indicated otherwise.Â Â Â  \r\nSeveral days later, Stokes Kia was having difficulty obtaining financing for Brewer and called to obtain further information about her employment status.Â  When Brewer called back to resolve the question, she was told the dealer was unable to secure financing for her and, in order to keep the car, she would have to get a co-signor or find her own financing.Â  Brewer contacted her bank, but her request for a loan was denied due to her poor credit rating.Â  On January 19, 2000, Brewer received a call from Stokes Kia asking her to return the car, but she refused.Â  Later that evening, a representative of Stokes Kia repossessed the vehicle.Â  After this claim was initiated and depositions had been taken by Brewer, Stokes Kia returned her deposit with interest. \r\nBrewer commenced this action against Stokes Kia, alleging causes of action for breach of contract; conversion; violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act; and violation of the Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act.Â  Approximately one year later, Stokes Kia moved for summary judgment.Â  Nearly three weeks after the motion, Brewer sought to amend her complaint to add six additional causes of action.Â  In June 2001, Judge Smoak denied the motion for summary judgment and granted the motion to amend the complaint.Â  However, upon reconsideration, Judge Smoak granted summary judgment.Â  A motion for reconsideration was timely filed, but was not heard until six months later.Â  By that time, Judge Smoak had retired and the motion for reconsideration was heard by Judge Rawl.Â  Judge Rawl denied the motion, and this appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact so that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 28, 586 S.E.2d 861, 863&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed against the moving party.Â  Id.Â  An appellate court will review summary judgment in a liberal manner so as to construe the record in favor of the nonmoving party and give the nonmoving party the benefit of all favorable inferences that might reasonably be drawn\r\ntherefrom.&nbsp; Jackson v. Doe,&nbsp;342 S.C. 552, 555, 537 S.E.2d 567, 568&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  Additionally, our court is cognizant that summary judgment is a drastic remedy, which must be cautiously invoked so that no person will be improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrewer argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because:Â  (1) issues of fact exist as to the existence of a contract; (2) she was not in default and therefore Stokes Kia did not have a right to repossess; and (3) she suffered damages.Â  Brewer further argues that because summary judgment was granted in error, she should have been allowed to amend her complaint to add various other causes of action.\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract issues \r\nBrewer argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there were issues of material fact regarding the existence of a contract.Â  To support this argument, she first asserts the contract between Stokes Kia was not conditioned on her credit being approved.Â  We disagree.\r\nA condition precedent to a contract is â€œany fact other than the lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance arises.â€Â  Worley v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622, 624&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œThe question of whether a provision â€˜in a contract constitutes a condition precedent is a question of construction dependent on the intent of the parties to be gathered from the language they employ.â€™â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  \r\nHere, the computer-generated buyerâ€™s order contained a stamped declaration that delivery was subject to credit approval, and Brewer admitted to seeing and initialing this declaration.Â Â  Further, Brewer admitted no one at Stokes Kia told her that her credit had been approved.Â  \r\nIn addition to the stamp on the signed, computer-generated buyerâ€™s order, a bailment agreement signed by Brewer states: â€œIn the event dealer is unable to provide financing Buyer(s) shall provide their own financing.â€Â  The computer-generated buyerâ€™s order and the bailment agreement make it clear that the sale was not final until financing was arranged.Â  The contract provided that Stokes Kia would attempt to obtain financing for Brewer, but if it could not, the responsibility would become Brewerâ€™s.Â Â  If neither Stokes Kia nor Brewer were able to obtain financing, ownership of the vehicle would remain with Stokes Kia.\r\nIn the event we find a condition precedent existed, Brewer further argues there was nothing to indicate the condition was not met, nor was there anything specifying who had to approve her request for credit.Â  However, the bailment agreement explained the deal would be completed â€œ[i]f dealer is able to provide Buyer(s) with financing according to the terms set forth in the Sales Agreement . . . .â€Â  This language vests discretion concerning financing with the dealership.Â  Stokes Kia, like the two dealerships Brewer had previously visited, was unable to find a company to finance Brewerâ€™s purchase.Â  Thus, it became Brewerâ€™s responsibility to find financing on her own.Â  She, too, was unable to find financing.\r\nBrewer also argues the computer-generated buyerâ€™s order was preceded by a handwritten buyerâ€™s order which did not have a condition precedent and that the handwritten order itself constituted a contract.Â  However, the actions of the parties and Brewerâ€™s ultimate signature on the computer-generated buyerâ€™s order demonstrate this handwritten buyerâ€™s order was simply a preliminary negotiation to the final agreement.Â  This is underscored by the fact that no terms besides price were discussed in the handwritten buyerâ€™s order.Â  In fact, it says that the â€œUNPAID BALANCE IS DUE ON DELIVERYâ€ and lists the balance as $5,397.50.Â  If this were the only enforceable contract between the parties, Brewer would be obligated to pay $5,397.50 to own the car.Â  It is undisputed that Brewer was not able to meet that obligation.\r\nBrewer also argues the retail installment contract and security agreement constitute Stokes Kiaâ€™s offer to finance the transaction.Â  It appears from deposition testimony the retail installment contract was signed by Brewer when she met with the finance manager.Â  It was at this time that she also signed the computer-generated buyerâ€™s order.Â  Although Brewer signed the installment contract, it was never signed by Stokes Kia.Â  In fact, Stokes Kia generally does not sign this document until the credit has been approved.Â  Because the document was not signed by Stokes Kia, it is not enforceable against it.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-201 (2004). \r\nAdditionally, Brewer argues physical delivery of the car by Stokes Kia is either evidence the contract was complete or an indication that legal ownership of the car had transferred.Â  She refers to section 36-2-401 of the South Carolina Code (2004) to support the latter proposition.Â  Section 36-2-401 provides: \r\n\r\nUnless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nThe key phrase from section 36-2-401 is â€œunless otherwise explicitly agreed.â€Â  The agreement between Brewer and Stokes Kia did explicitly state physical delivery of the car was only a convenience provided to the buyer and the sale was pending credit approval.Â  Therefore, pursuant to the agreement, title did not pass at the time of physical delivery.Â  This contract language also prevents introduction of this conduct as evidence the contract was complete.\r\nFinally, in her reply brief, Brewer attempts to argue this case is controlled by Singleton v. Stokes Motors, Inc., 358 S.C. 369, 595 S.E.2d 461 (2004).Â  Singleton involved a yo-yo sale, defined as occurring when: \r\n\r\nThe consumer believes a vehicleâ€™s installment or sale is final and the dealer gives the consumer possession of the car â€˜on the spot.â€™Â  The dealer later tells the consumer to return the car because the financing has fallen through.Â  If the consumer does not return the vehicle or agree to rewrite the transaction on less favorable terms, the dealer repossesses the vehicle.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 380, 595 S.E.2d at 467 (quoting National Consumer Law Center, Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices 316 (5th ed. 2001)).Â  The transaction in Singleton involved an unconditional sales contract and conditional bailment agreement, which our supreme court called â€œpatently unfair and deceptive acts.â€Â  Id. at 381, 595 S.E.2d at 468.Â  However, the court determined the dealerships could easily cure the unfairness by explaining in the sales agreement that the sale is conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing and telling the customers the truth about their credit.Â  Id.Â  at 381-82, 595 S.E.2d at 468.Â  Singleton does not apply to Brewerâ€™s transaction because the buyerâ€™s order did contain a stamp making delivery of the car conditional upon Brewer obtaining financing and because Stokes Kia never told Brewer she had been financed.\r\nThus, we agree the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the basis of the lack of an enforceable contract.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to repossess, damages, and amendment of the complaint \r\nBrewer argues the trial court was also in error when it found Stokes Kia had a right to repossess, when it found there were no damages, and when it denied her motion to amend the complaint.Â  We disagree.\r\nBrewer argues there was no right to repossession because she had not defaulted on the contract.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-5-110 (2002).Â  However, as discussed above, the car was delivered to Brewer subject to credit approval as a convenience extended to her by Stokes Kia.Â  When Brewer was not financed and she was not able to obtain financing on her own, she was unable to complete the transaction.Â  By failing to pay for the car, she defaulted on the contract.Â  When default occurred, Stokes Kia had the right to repossess the car.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-5-112 (2002).[1]  \r\nThe trial court also supported its grant of summary judgment on the basis that Brewer could not demonstrate any damages.Â  The trial court explained Brewerâ€™s down payment had been returned with interest and though Brewer alleged she could have had a free rental car for four additional days from the time of the sale, she actually used the car from Stokes Kia for eight days.Â  Because we found the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to Stokes Kia on the basis of the contract issues, it is not necessary that we rule on this issue.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR; Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining the appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is\r\ndispositive).\r\n\r\n Finally, Brewerâ€™s argument regarding amendment of her complaint is contingent on our finding the grant of summary judgment was in error.Â  Because we have affirmed the grant of summary judgment this issue must also fail.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Providing: â€œUpon default by a consumer with respect to a consumer credit transaction, unless the consumer voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral or rented property to the creditor, the creditor may take possession of the collateral or rented property without judicial process only if possession can be taken without entry into a dwelling used as a current residence and without the use of force or other breach of the peace.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3986","title":"Howard v.

Howard and John Nasser (collectively Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment for JoAnn Nasser (Respondent), surviving spouse of the decedent Leroy Nasser (Nasser) and personal representative of his estate.Â  Appellants argue the will was invalid because it was the product of undue influence by Respondent.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nLeroy Howard and John Nasser, the decedentâ€™s nephews, brought an action to contest an April 10, 2000 will of Nasser.Â  The will was properly executed and was admitted to probate.Â  Nasserâ€™s surviving spouse and second wife, Respondent, was appointed as personal representative of his estate.Â  The will left nothing to either Leroy Howard or John Nasser.Â  Instead, Nasser gave $10,000 to each of his great nieces and the remainder of his estate to Respondent.Â  Additionally, Nasser gave Respondent a power of attorney in October of 1999, specifically revoking a previous power of attorney in favor of Leroy Howard.Â  \r\nNasser had executed two prior wills.Â  The first will, executed on July 30, 1985, left everything to his first wife and appointed Leroy Howard as his personal representative.Â  After Nasserâ€™s first wife died, he executed another will, dated May 19, 1995, that left $50,000 to John Nasser and the residue to Leroy Howard.Â  Leroy Howard was also appointed personal representative of Nasserâ€™s estate.Â  \r\nIn August of 1998, Nasser was injured in a fall while in Roanoke, Virginia.Â  Leroy Howard drove Nasser back to Greenville, where he was admitted to the St. Francis Hospital System and released in September of 1998.Â  While recovering from his fall, Nasser met Respondent, who was employed as a housekeeper at the hospital.Â  Respondent obtained a divorce from her first husband, from whom she had been separated for approximately ten years, in April of 1999.Â  On May 24, 1999, Respondent and Nasser were married.Â  The will giving rise to this litigation was executed on April 10, 2000.Â  Nasser died as a result of pancreatic cancer and cirrhosis on May 19, 2000.Â  \r\nAppellants filed a petition in probate court, alleging causes of action for undue influence, lack of capacity, fraud, and tortious interference with an expectancy to inherit.Â  Respondent moved for summary judgment on all causes of action.[1]Â  At the hearing on the motion, Appellants argued that Respondentâ€™s fiduciary relationship with Nasser, along with other evidence, created a presumption of undue influence.Â  In support of their contention, Appellants offered the following evidence:\r\n\r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karen R. Hunter, M.D., testified that she diagnosed Nasser with pancreatic cancer in mid-April, 2000.Â  At that time, he appeared ill and was jaundiced, but he did not appear overly distraught about the diagnosis.Â  \r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy Howardâ€™s affidavit stated that during the last year of Nasserâ€™s life, his health had deteriorated, and that he believed that Respondent had poisoned his relationship with Nasser, as communication inexplicably broke down and he was not allowed to visit Nasser alone.Â  Additionally, Nasser allegedly withdrew funds in excess of $200,000 from a joint account held by Leroy Howard and Nasser in April of 2000.Â  \r\n(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Nasserâ€™s affidavit also stated that his communication with Nasser decreased dramatically in late 1999, and that Nasser appeared sickly and confused in April of 2000.Â  \r\n(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The affidavit of Nicholas M. Franchina, a realtor and friend of the family, stated that in addition to a â€œdramatic change in [Nasserâ€™s] affect, and personality,â€ he noticed on two occasions that someone was listening in on the telephone, and that Mr. Nasser abruptly cut short the conversation and hung up. \r\n(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A local attorney who had prepared Nasserâ€™s two previous wills felt that Nasser was upset about the April 2000 will, and since the disposition was dramatically different from that of the previous wills, he felt uncomfortable and encouraged the Nassers to seek other counsel.\r\n(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The durable power of attorney Nasser executed in October of 1999 specifically revoked the previous power of attorney in favor of Leroy Howard.Â  However, the paragraph containing the revocation was in a different font from the rest of the document.Â  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the attorney who drafted the April 2000 will testified that Nasser appeared to be of sound mind, and that he freely and voluntarily indicated that he wanted the majority of his estate to go to his wife.Â  Additionally, there was testimony that Leroy Howardâ€™s relationship with Nasser had become strained.Â  Nasser allegedly told the witness that he â€œwould rather throw that money in the garbage can or throw it away than for him to have one cent of my money.â€Â  Moreover, the same witness testified that Leroy Howard called immediately after learning of Nasserâ€™s death to inquire about Nasserâ€™s estate, whereas Respondent seemed much more concerned about Nasserâ€™s death. \r\nAfter hearing arguments, the circuit court granted Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment. [2]Â  Specifically, the court ruled that Appellantsâ€™ burden of proving undue influence could not be shifted to Respondent.Â  The court reasoned that Appellants continued to bear the burden of proof even if a confidential/fiduciary relationship existed between Respondent and Nasser.Â  As to the merits of the cause of action for undue influence, the court found there was no evidence to support Appellantsâ€™ claim.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.â€ McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 437, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 438, 567 S.E.2d at 242.Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy.Â  Thus, it â€œshould be cautiously invoked so that a litigant will not be improperly deprived of trial on disputed factual issues.â€Â  Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 491, 575 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2003).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. \r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in finding the existence of a confidential/fiduciary relationship between Nasser and Respondent did not shift the burden to Respondent to show the absence of undue influence.Â  Appellants claim Respondentâ€™s status as spouse of the decedent and holder of a power of attorney created a fiduciary relationship that gave rise to the presumption of undue influence.\r\nThe procedure outlining the burden of proof in contested will cases is governed by section 62-3-407 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 (Supp. 2004).Â  This section provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship.Â  Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases and, if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue. Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, revocation, or lack of testamentary intent or capacity.Â  Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 62-3-407 (Supp. 2004); see In re Estate of Cumbee, 333 S.C. 664, 671, 511 S.E.2d 390, 393 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œProponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases . . . Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, revocation, or lack of testamentary intent or capacity.â€).Â  In analyzing this code section, our supreme court has explained:\r\n\r\nWhen the formal execution of a will is admitted or proved, a prima facie case in favor of the will is made out, and the burden is then on the contestants to prove undue influence, incapacity or other basis of invalidation.Â  The contestants continue to bear the burden of proof throughout the will contest.Â  In determining whether the contestants sustained such burden, the evidence has to be viewed in the light most favorable to the contestants.\r\n\r\nCalhoun v. Calhoun, 277 S.C. 527, 530, 290 S.E.2d 415, 417 (1982).Â  \r\nâ€œUndue influence may be proved by circumstantial evidence, but the circumstances relied on to show it must be such as taken together point unmistakenly and convincingly to the fact that the mind of the testator was subjected to that of some other person, so that the will is that of the latter and not of the former.â€Â  Havird v. Schissell, 252 S.C. 404, 410-11, 166 S.E.2d 801, 804 (1969) (citations omitted); In re Last Will and Testament of Smoak, 286 S.C. 419, 424, 334 S.E.2d 806, 809 (1985) (â€œA will contest based on alleged undue influence is most often adjudicated on the basis of circumstantial evidence.â€). \r\nâ€œGenerally, in cases where a will has been set aside for undue influence, there has been evidence either of threats, force, and/or restricted visitation, or of an existing fiduciary relationship.â€Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 333 (2003).Â  â€œâ€˜A confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interest of the one imposing the confidence.â€™â€Â  In re Estate of Cumbee, 333 S.C. at 672, 511 S.E.2d at 394 (quoting Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 422, 483 S.E.2d 477, 484 (Ct. App. 1997)).\r\nBoth parties acknowledge that in contested deed cases a presumption of invalidity arises if the contestants of the deed present evidence that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between the grantor and the grantee.Â  See Middleton v. Suber, 300 S.C. 402, 405, 388 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1990) (recognizing that where a â€œconfidential relationshipâ€ exists between a grantor and a grantee, the deed is presumed invalid and the burden is upon the grantee to establish the absence of undue influence); Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 280-81, 363 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1987) (â€œUndue influence in the procurement of a deed may be shown in two ways.Â  The party challenging the deed may show the existence of a confidential relationship between the grantor and the grantee.Â  Once a confidential relationship is shown, the deed is presumed invalid.Â  The burden then shifts to the grantee to affirmatively show the absence of undue influence.â€); Hudson v. Leopold, 288 S.C. 194, 196, 341 S.E.2d 137, 138 (1986)(â€œA fiduciary relationship between the grantor and grantee may give rise to a presumption of undue influence, thus shifting the burden of proof to the grantee to rebut the presumption.â€). \r\nHowever, because the instant case involves a will, the central question in this appeal is whether this presumption, which affects the burden of proof, is applicable in the context of a contested will.Â  The parties have not presented nor has our research revealed any case law providing definitive guidance on this issue.Â  However, a recent case of our supreme court appears to implicitly recognize that the presumption of invalidity in deed cases applies to will cases.Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 608 S.E.2d 849 (2005).\r\nIn Dixon, Mother, who was elderly, conveyed her property to Son.Â  At the same time the deed was executed, Mother signed an agreement prepared by Son whereby he agreed to care for Mother and maintain her residence.Â Â  Following a confrontation approximately three years later, Mother asked Son to leave her home, changed the locks on the home, and requested that Son re-convey the title to the property to her.Â  When Son refused, Mother filed an action to set aside the deed.Â  Mother claimed undue influence as one of her grounds challenging the deed.Â  Specifically, she asserted that because she and Son were in a confidential relationship, Son had the burden of proving that he did not unduly influence her and he failed to meet that burden.Â  As a threshold matter, our supreme court found a confidential relationship existed between the parties.Â  The court ultimately concluded that Son proved that he did not unduly influence Mother.Â  In reaching this decision, the court utilized the principles of undue influence applicable in contested will cases.Â  The court relied on precedent from other jurisdictions which has found that â€œthe analysis is the same regardless of whether the underlying document sought to be set aside on the grounds that the plaintiff was unduly influenced is a will or a deed.â€Â  Dixon, 362 S.C. at 398 n.7, 608 S.E.2d at 854 n.7.Â  Based on these cases, the court recognized â€œ[m]ost of our jurisprudence on the issue of undue influence involves a contestant seeking to set aside a will, rather than a deed . . ., nonetheless, we find no reason why this discrepancy should change our analysis.â€ Id.\r\nIn addition to Dixon, we find secondary authority supports the application of the presumption to contested will cases.Â  Concerning this issue, the Restatement of Property provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\nA presumption of undue influence arises if the alleged wrongdoer was in a confidential relationship with the donor and there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the preparation, formulation, or execution of the donative transfer, whether the transfer was by gift, trust, will, will substitute, or a donative transfer of any other type.Â  The effect of the presumption is to shift to the proponent the burden of going forward with the evidence, not the burden of persuasion.Â  The presumption justifies a judgment for the contestant as a matter of law only if the proponent does not come forward with evidence to rebut the presumption.Â  \r\n\r\nRestatement (Third) of Property:Â  Wills and Other Donative Transfers Â§ 8.3 cmt. f (2003) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe interpret the foregoing to mean that if the contestants of a duly executed will provide evidence that a confidential/fiduciary relationship existed sufficient to raise the presumption, the proponents of the will must offer evidence in rebuttal.Â  We emphasize that although the proponents of the will must present evidence in rebuttal, they do not have to affirmatively disprove the existence of undue influence.Â  Instead, the contestants of the will still retain the ultimate burden of proof to invalidate the will.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 (Supp. 2004) (â€œParties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof.â€); Calhoun, 277 S.C. at 530, 290 S.E.2d at 417 (â€œThe contestants continue to bear the burden of proof throughout the will contest.â€); Smith v. Whetstone, 209 S.C. 78, 84, 39 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1946) (stating in case where will is formally executed the burden of proof is on the contestant to prove undue influence â€œand this burden remains on him to the endâ€). \r\nTo summarize, â€œ[w]here the contestants introduce testimony raising a presumption of undue influence by a beneficiary sustaining a confidential or fiduciary relation toward the testator, the issue should be submitted to the jury, as where, in addition to the factor of confidential relations, there also appear the further facts of an unnatural disposition making the person charged with the undue influence chief beneficiary, and that such person generally dominated the testatrix.â€Â  Moorer v. Bull, 212 S.C. 146, 149, 46 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1948) (citations omitted).Â  However, â€œ[a] mere showing of opportunity and even of a motive to exercise undue influence does not justify a submission of that issue to a jury, unless there is additional evidence that such influence was actually utilized.Â  General influence is not enough.Â  A contestant must show that the influence was brought directly to bear upon the testamentary act.â€Â  Mock v. Dowling, 266 S.C. 274, 277, 222 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1976).Â  â€œThe influence must be of such a degree that it dominated the testatorâ€™s will, took away his free agency, and prevented the exercise of judgment and choice by him.Â  If the testator had the testamentary capacity to dispose of his property and was free and unrestrained in his volition at the time of making the will, the influence that may have inspired it or some provision of it will not be â€˜undue influence.â€™â€Â  In re Last Will and Testament of Smoak, 286 S.C. at 424, 334 S.E.2d at 809.\r\nII. \r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in finding that they had not proved that undue influence was exerted upon Nasser.\r\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to Appellants and in the context of the above-outlined principles, we hold a genuine issue of material fact was created regarding Appellantsâ€™ claim of undue influence.Â  Initially, we note the formal execution of the will is undisputed, and thus, is presumed valid.Â  Furthermore, we find, and the parties appear to agree, that a confidential/fiduciary relationship existed between Nasser and Respondent.Â  In addition to the confidential relationship by way of marriage, Respondent admitted at oral argument that the power of attorney that Nasser gave to Respondent created a fiduciary relationship.Â  See In re Estate of Cumbee, 333 S.C. at 672-73, 511 S.E.2d at 394 (finding in will contest that fiduciary relationship, which created the presumption of undue influence, existed between son and mother where son had motherâ€™s power of attorney and managed her finances); see also Chapman v. Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 302 S.C. 469, 477, 395 S.E.2d 446, 451 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œ[W]e hold that when a husband or wife reposes in the other a trust to do or not do an act relating to the corpus of his estate after his or her death a confidential relationship shall be deemed to have existed if the one in whom the confidence is reposed has the power to abuse the confidence to his or her advantage.â€).\r\nAppellants did not rely solely on the existence of a confidential/fiduciary relationship, but additionally offered the following evidence in support of their claim of undue influence:Â  (1) Nasser was physically infirm as a result of a terminal illness prior to the execution of the will; (2) the disposition of Nasserâ€™s estate was significantly different from his two prior wills; (3) Respondent was present at the meetings with the attorneys to discuss the contents of the new will; (4) Nasserâ€™s relationship with his nephews became strained and the frequency of family visits was limited after Nasserâ€™s remarriage; (5) Nicholas Franchina, a member of the extended family, noticed a change in Nasserâ€™s disposition and believed someone was monitoring Nasserâ€™s telephone conversations; and (6) Joseph Francis, Jr., an attorney who discussed estate planning with Nasser and Respondent, refused to draft Nasserâ€™s will because he believed Nasser was troubled by the changes.Â  We believe this evidence was sufficient to require Respondent to present evidence rebutting the presumption of invalidity.Â  \r\nIn contrast to Appellantsâ€™ evidence, Respondent offered the following evidence: (1) Nasser traveled to Pennsylvania shortly before his death to attend a family event; (2) treating physicians did not discern any mental infirmity; (3) the attorney who prepared the final will believed Nasser had the requisite mental and physical capacity to dispose of his estate and that Nasser and his nephew had a â€œfalling outâ€; (4) a stockbroker, who handled Nasserâ€™s investments in April 2000, testified that Nasser did not want his nephew to have any of his money; and (5) Respondent denied she used Nasserâ€™s power of attorney, restricted his family visits, or monitored his telephone conversations. \r\nBecause there exists a conflict in the evidence, thus creating a genuine issue of material fact, we find the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent.Â  See Byrd v. Byrd, 279 S.C. 425, 431, 308 S.E.2d 788, 791-92 (1983) (finding in will contest case that issue of undue influence was properly submitted to the jury where: testator was physically and mentally infirm prior to and contemporaneous with the execution of the will; son, who was the principal beneficiary of the will and in a confidential/fiduciary relationship with testator, threatened to place testator in a nursing home and attempted to restrict visits between testator and his other children; and the will was executed less than six months prior to testatorâ€™s death); Moorer, 212 S.C. at 149, 46 S.E.2d at 681-82 (holding issue of undue influence in contested will case was properly submitted to the jury where there was evidence that testatorâ€™s son was in a confidential/fiduciary relationship with his mother, mother was in fear of him, and he indicated an intention to procure for himself her estate).\r\nAgain, we emphasize that the burden of proof as to undue influence remains on Appellants throughout the will contest.Â  In reversing the circuit court, we offer no opinion regarding Appellantsâ€™ success on the merits.Â  We merely find that Appellants offered sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J. and CURETON,\r\nA.J.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Pursuant to section 62-1-302 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, the parties consented to remove the action from probate court to circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(c) (Supp. 2004) (â€œNotwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court . . . any action or proceeding filed in the probate court and relating to the following subject matters, on motion of a party . . . must be removed to the circuit court and in these cases the circuit court shall proceed upon the matter de novo. . . .â€).\r\n[2]Â  Although the circuit court judge granted Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment on all causes of actions, Appellants only appeal the grant of summary judgment as to undue influence.Â  Accordingly, we have limited our analysis solely to the cause of action involving undue influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3987","title":"State v.

[M]aybe send some pictures of you all!!Â  I would be very greatful [sic]. . . . I know that youâ€™ll take really good care of her.Â  Please do your best, and let her know that I love her, please do this for me Melissa. . . . .\r\n. . . I just talked with my lawyer and did not get very good news from him. Â Seems they want me to plead guilty to Criminal Sexual Conduct 2nd degree.Â  It carries 15 years.Â  Missy, thatâ€™s a long time, and I probably wonâ€™t make it out alive.Â  Even if I do, I wonâ€™t be able to survive, because I wonâ€™t be able to work with a criminal record like the one Iâ€™ll have.Â  Maybe I should just ask for the Death Penalty because itâ€™s more or less what it will be. God, I donâ€™t know what to do now.Â  What should I do now? \r\nI have to ask you this because you are the only one who can be happy with the results and outcome of this whole situation.Â  I guess it comes down to what you want the Justice System to do to me, for you.Â  I really want you to know that my life is in your hands at this time, and only you can do whatâ€™s necessary to change what happens to me. I keep hearing that you are going to drop the charges, but I just donâ€™t know.Â  Melissa, if you have any part of my heart, please think about dropping the charges.Â  I am not begging you to, just asking please.Â  I just donâ€™t think I can make it in Prison again, especially 15 years.Â  Missy, my lawyer says that I can take this to Trial, but I donâ€™t want to drag out all the shit that they will put any of us thru, if you know what I mean.Â  They will drag out everyoneâ€™s past by doing a trial and more indictments or warrants could and will come up on others involved.\r\nI will try to keep from going to trial because I donâ€™t want them to antagonize you any more than they already have.Â  Melissa, it is very important that you do whatever you do at your own free will, and I want you to know that in no way am I threatening you or anyone else. I just hope and pray that this time youâ€™ll save my life from this crooked Justice System. . . . Once again Melissa, [p]lease do what you can to drop these charges so we donâ€™t have to suffer any more heartache that the past is going to bring up. . . . I pray that you will help me Missy.Â  (Emphasis in original).\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In a second letter, addressed to Melissaâ€™s sister, Preslar wrote:\r\n\r\nMandy, tell your sister Missy, not to take this as a threat, or personal, or as an effort to get her to drop these charges, Mandy, by no means am I a snitch, but I will not stand by and give my life to SCâ€™s prison system for accusations given to NC, almost 7 years ago.Â  Not when God, myself, and other people know about Chris and Missyâ€™s past which they explained to me and my friend just 14 months ago, (68 chev, late 1994?).Â  I donâ€™t by no means want to see Melissa hurt by her past with Chris but God wonâ€™t let me stand by and not bring this in to the open.Â  You know, maybe its Godâ€™s will that put me here to show this anyway since I never done anything about it back then when I should have and they were sleeping together in Indian Land.Â  I am going to hold off talking with any detectives about this until after Jan. 10th, when Court starts back up here.Â  Everything depends on whether this goes to trial or not.Â  I truly believe that God is using me to bring other people out of their misery of their own hidden sins in which only God and themselves know of!! (God works in mysterious ways). Only God &amp; Melissa have the power to change the outcome of this unforeseen travsety [sic] of all our lives.Â  I Hope and Pray that God will touch Missyâ€™s heart just as he has mine.\r\n\r\nPreslar was indicted for two counts of intimidation of a witness under section 16-9-340 of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  Prior to trial, Preslar moved to prohibit the State from presenting any evidence or mentioning the underlying CSC charges.Â  Preslarâ€™s counsel alleged the mention of the CSC charges would be unduly prejudicial and would confuse the jury.Â  The State maintained the underlying charges had to be identified in order to demonstrate why the two letters were so threatening to Melissa.\r\nThe court allowed the State to articulate that Preslar was charged with criminal sexual conduct without mentioning the number of charges or that he was currently incarcerated.Â  Portions of the letters were redacted so only those sections specifically alleged to be intimidating were allowed into evidence.\r\nDuring the trial, it was explained that Preslar was charged with CSC.Â  The State informed the jury that Melissa was the alleged victim in the case and the primary witness if it should proceed to trial.Â  Melissa professed that bringing the charges against her father scared her, â€œbut on the other handÂ  [made her] happyâ€ because â€œhe couldnâ€™t mess with [her] no more.â€\r\nMelissa described in detail why the first letter was intimidating to her.Â  As the alleged victim of Preslarâ€™s CSC charges, the references to her daughter made her very uneasy.Â  Melissa stated she â€œdidnâ€™t want him to know her or her to know him.â€Â  She later addressed the threat: â€œJust my daughter period, donâ€™t want him to know her or have anything to do with her or see her or touch her or anything.â€\r\nThe references to â€œmore indictments or warrantsâ€ made Melissa afraid for her husband.Â  She announced to the jury that she and her husband had sexual relations when she was still a minor, at sixteen.Â  Melissa testified she was â€œscaredâ€ Preslar would seek charges against her husband, Chris, even though the two married in 1997.\r\nAs to the second letter, Melissaâ€™s main concern was for her husband.Â  The threats that Preslar would expose their relationship when she was only sixteen made her afraid her husband could go to jail.Â  She articulated the claims by Preslar made her â€œ[h]esitant on going forth.â€Â  The jury found Preslar guilty on both counts of intimidating a witness.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004); see also State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004)(â€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€).Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Davis, Op. No. 3970 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 28, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 55).\r\nOn review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 600 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); State v. Staten, Op. No. 3955 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 7, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 12 at 22).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 606 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  See State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); see also State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995) (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPreslar contends the trial court erred in allowing testimony regarding the nature of his charges.Â  He maintains it was unduly prejudicial for the jury to be told the underlying charges were for CSC, and the testimony should have been excluded as improper character evidence or as a reference to a prior bad act.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  INTIMIDATION OF A WITNESS\r\nIn South Carolina, intimidation of a witness is a statutory offense consisting of the following elements:\r\n\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  an unlawful threat or force;\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  to intimidate or impede a witness in the discharge of his duty;\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nto destroy, impede, or attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-340(A) (2003).\r\nII.Â  RES GESTAE\r\nThe res gestae theory recognizes that evidence of other bad acts may be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged or may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.Â  State v. Fletcher, __S.C.__, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Our supreme court discussed the res gestae theory in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996):\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and is so much a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its proof is appropriate in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense is â€˜so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] part of the res gestae of the crime charged.â€\r\n\r\nId. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980)).Â  When evidence is admissible to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, there is â€œno reason to fragmentize the event under inquiry by suppressing parts of the res gestae.â€Â  State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 133, 606 S.E.2d 508, 517 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal quotations omitted).Â  Under the res gestae principle, it is important that the temporal proximity of the prior bad act be closely related to the charged crime.Â  Fletcher, __S.C. at __, 609 S.E.2d at 585.Â  Even if the evidence is relevant under this theory, prior to admission the trial judge should determine whether its probative value clearly outweighs any unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; Fletcher, __S.C. at __, 609 S.E.2d at 585.\r\nSection 16-9-340 of the South Carolina Code provides: \r\n\r\n(A) It is unlawful for a person by threat or force to:\r\n  \r\n(1) intimidate or impede a judge, magistrate, juror, witness, or potential juror or witness, arbiter, commissioner, or member of any commission of this State or any other official of any court, in the discharge of his duty as such;Â  or\r\n(2) destroy, impede, or attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-340 (2003).\r\nIn the case sub judice, the evidence was properly admitted under the res gestae theory.Â  The underlying CSC charges were a necessary and integral part of the crime for which Preslar was charged.Â  The nature of those crimesâ€”the explanation that Preslar allegedly victimized his daughter Melissaâ€”was inextricably interwoven in the fabric of the charge of intimidation of Melissa as the victim and primary witness in the case against\r\nPreslar.\r\nIn order for the jury to fully understand why Melissa would be threatened by Preslarâ€™s references to her baby girl, the jury had to understand what Melissa accused Preslar of doing to her.Â  Without reference to the underlying CSC charges, the jury would not be able to discern the context in which the questions became threats.Â  The reference to the CSC charges was necessary for a full presentation of the evidence to the jury.Â  The explanation that Preslar was charged with CSC and Melissa was his victim is archetypical res gestae evidence.Â  Moreover, the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.Â  See State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Concomitantly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence that Preslar was charged with CSC and Melissa was the victim and primary witness in the case.\r\nIII.Â  RELEVANCE\r\nFor evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant.Â  Rules 401 &amp; 402, SCRE; State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 606 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, or by other rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.â€Â  Rule 402, SCRE; State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 457-58, 602 S.E.2d 62, 75 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal quotations omitted).Â  \r\nRelevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 142, 591 S.E.2d 646, 651 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.Â  In re Care and Treatment of Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.â€Â  Rule 403,\r\nSCRE.\r\nThe evidence of Preslarâ€™s charges for CSC was absolutely necessary and relevant for the jury to determine why the letters written to Melissa were threatening and intimidating.Â  While the nature of the charges was prejudicial, as is any evidence against the defendant in a criminal trial, the evidence was essential to proving the elements of the crime for which Preslar is charged.Â  The probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.Â  Apodictically, the trial court properly allowed the testimony regarding Preslarâ€™s charges for CSC.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe testimony explaining Preslarâ€™s prior charges for CSC to the jury was necessary to explain the context or the res gestae of the crime of intimidating a witness under section 16-9-340.Â  Additionally, the evidence was not unduly prejudicial so as to outweigh its probative value.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion.Â  Accordingly, Preslarâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3988","title":"Murphy v.

Kerr, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Elizabeth Murphy filed an action against Jefferson Pilot Communications Company (Jefferson Pilot), WCSC, Inc. d/b/a WCSC Channel 5 (WCSC), and Donald M. Feldman, alleging, inter alia, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Elizabethâ€™s husband, Christopher Murphy, filed a companion claim alleging loss of consortium.Â  The trial court directed verdicts in favor of WCSC and Jefferson Pilot.Â  The jury returned a verdict against Feldman, awarding the Murphys substantial actual and punitive damages.Â  The Murphys appeal.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nDonald Feldman served as â€œAssistant VP Newsâ€ for Jefferson Pilot and was the news director of WCSC, a Charleston television station and Jefferson Pilot subsidiary.Â  He reported directly to the general manager of Jefferson Pilot.Â  Feldman met Sandra Senn, a local attorney, and convinced her to become a voluntary panelist on a political talk show broadcast by WCSC entitled â€œCarolina Gang.â€Â  Senn, a former partner in the Stuckey Law Firm, had recently started her own firm.Â  Elizabethâ€™s father, James Stuckey, was the senior partner of the Stuckey Law Firm.Â  Senn and the firm were involved in a dispute regarding business issues relating to Sennâ€™s departure from the firm, and Senn mentioned her frustrations springing from the dispute in casual conversations with Feldman.Â  \r\nOn July 23, 1999, Feldman telephoned Senn and said that he had just arrived in Atlanta on a flight from Charleston.Â  Feldman told Senn that Elizabeth was on his flight and, while very intoxicated, made slanderous remarks about Senn and WCSC.Â  \r\nA couple of days later, Feldman electronically mailed Senn stating: \r\n\r\nI have decided to take an ACTIVE roll [sic] in dealing with this woman.Â  I have come up with my own plan to deal with her. . . . After thinking about it, I am determined not to let this woman attempt to destroy your reputation and my plan will scare the crap out of her.Â  It was selfish of me to stay out of it. \r\n\r\nLater the same week, Feldman told Senn he sent a letter (the Letter) to Elizabeth via courier.Â  Feldman provided Senn with a copy of the Letter.Â  The Letter was written on WCSC stationery and stated:Â  \r\n\r\nDear Ms. Stuckey:[1]Â  \r\nAfter what I felt were disturbing and potentially Liable [sic] Statements aboard Delta Fight 852 from Charleston to Atlanta on July 23, 1999. [sic]Â  There are several issues I am compelled to discuss with you. \r\nYour unsubstantiated comments against Jefferson-Pilot Communications, WCSC News, Sandy Senn and Me are at the least tasteless and could force our company to take legal action against you and your law firm.Â  \r\nAs you so clearly stated, Ms. Senn is a WCSC Air Personality.Â  Therefore, WCSC has a moral as well as a financial interest in protecting her reputation and that of our News Department and itsâ€™ [sic] programs.Â  It is one thing to criticize an air personalities [sic] delivery, but it is quite another to loudly and publicly discuss their bedroom habits and personal disputes between you, your Law Firm, and her.Â  I am also deeply disturbed that you would question my hiring practices and the motives behind them.Â  I have been in Television News Management for thirty years and maintain WCSCâ€™s news as the highest rated and most respected in the market.Â  \r\nAs a result, I have instructed a member of our staff to contact Delta Airlines to obtain the passenger manifest and the flight attendant service log for the flight we were on.Â  Atlanta Passenger Service Agent Heath Hamrick will also be contacted.Â  As you recall, he was the individual who repeatedly told you to keep your voice down after our late arrival in Atlanta.Â  \r\nI intent [sic] to use the passenger service manifest to determine which passengers, if any, heard your comments.Â  I will then contact Frank Magid Associates, our research firm, and ask them to interview any Charleston area passengers to see if your statements will affect their perceptions and viewing habits of Channel Five and Carolina Gang.Â  They will also ask if the perceptions of Ms. Senn have changed.Â  \r\nThe flight attendant service log will be used to determine how many bottles [sic] alcohol you were served on the flight.Â  \r\nOnce I have this information, I intend to turn to our legal department.Â  They will advise me whether to tell Ms. Senn of the incident and whether our company should take legal action against you and your law firm.Â  If you care to discuss this incident further, please contact me at 402-5740.Â  \r\nIn the end, this matter could become far more embarrassing for you and your law firm than for Jefferson Pilot Communications, Ms. Senn, or me.Â  \r\nI would hope we can resolve this matter quickly before there is any more damage to the reputations of anyone.Â  \r\nSincerely, \r\nDonald M. Feldman\r\nVice-President/News Director\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Feldman told Senn that Elizabeth came to WCSC on two occasions to discuss entering into a civil agreement to refrain from any further defamation of Senn.Â  Senn testified she assisted Feldman in the preparation of the agreement, but never saw a signed copy.Â  At that time, Feldman told Senn that Elizabeth was on the plane with a man who was not her husband. Â On another occasion, Feldman told Senn he had the passenger manifest and the drink log from the flight.Â  \r\nIn late September of 1999, Senn gave a copy of the Letter to Dale DuTremble, the attorney representing her in the dispute with the Stuckey Law Firm.Â  Senn told DuTremble she wanted the airplane defamation incident resolved along with her other dispute with the Stuckey Law Firm.Â  DuTremble met with Feldman at WCSC to discuss the Letter.Â  At the meeting, Feldman repeated all the allegations he claimed occurred on the airplane and reiterated that Elizabeth was traveling with a man other than her husband.Â  Feldman told DuTremble he had the passenger manifest and the drink log, but would not reveal them as he was protecting his source at Delta.Â  \r\nDuTremble informed Susan Wall, the attorney representing the Stuckey Law Firm in its dispute with Senn, of Elizabethâ€™s alleged conduct on the airplane.Â  Wall called Elizabeth.Â  Elizabeth denied having any knowledge of the airplane incident and, subsequent to her conversation with Wall, realized she was attending a soccer game and birthday party in Charleston when the airplane incident allegedly occurred.Â  Elizabeth did not see the Letter, supposedly sent to her in July, until November.Â  \r\nElizabeth showed the Letter to Stuckey, who called Tom Waring, an attorney who represented WCSC.Â  On November 16, Waring talked with Elizabeth and Stuckey and then contacted Rita Oâ€™Neill, WCSCâ€™s general manager.Â  Oâ€™Neill called Feldman to find out what was going on.Â  Feldman told her about the alleged incident on the airplane and stated Elizabeth attacked Senn and the â€œCarolina Gang.â€Â  Feldman also told Oâ€™Neill that the former station manager, Chuck Wing, gave permission to write the letter, and that Wing edited the letter.Â  Feldman indicated that Dan McAlister, general counsel for Jefferson Pilot, probably saw the Letter.Â  \r\nThe next day, Waring went to WCSC and met with Feldman and Oâ€™Neill.Â  Feldman produced a copy of the Letter and stated that he had disposed of the passenger manifest and drink log.Â  Feldman told Oâ€™Neill and Waring it was his duty to respond to Elizabeth to protect the station, and he had permission from Wing to write the Letter.Â  \r\nDuTremble testified that beginning in either late 1999 or early 2000, Feldmanâ€™s story began to unravel.Â  All parties finally realized that Elizabeth was not on the flight as Feldman alleged, and obviously Feldman never had the manifest or log as he originally insisted.Â  In November of 2000, Feldman was arrested on embezzlement charges and, at the time of trial, was incarcerated in federal prison.Â  After his arrest, it became clear the entire incident involving Elizabeth never occurred and was entirely fabricated by Feldman.Â  \r\nAs a result of Feldmanâ€™s defamatory allegations, Elizabeth sought psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed with a major depressive episode, severe major depression, and severe anxiety.Â  Elizabeth took a medical leave from the practice of law.Â  \r\nIn 2001, the Murphys filed suit against Jefferson Pilot, WCSC, and Feldman.Â  The Murphys alleged Feldman made slanderous statements about Elizabeth, which he published in the Letter and to Senn.Â  The Murphys alleged Feldmanâ€™s actions were performed within the scope of his employment with WCSC and as an agent for WCSC and Jefferson Pilot.Â  In addition, they alleged Feldmanâ€™s conduct amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  \r\nThe action was tried before a jury over an eight-day period.Â  The trial court denied the Murphysâ€™ motions for directed verdicts on liability, and granted the directed verdict motions of WCSC and Jefferson Pilot based on â€œpublic policy.â€Â  The trial court then submitted the case to the jury on only the issue of damages as to Feldman.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Elizabeth of $3,009,268 in actual damages and $3,000,000 in punitive damages.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Christopher Murphy for $3,000,000 in actual damages due to loss of consortium.Â  \r\nThe Murphys filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, and in the alternative a motion for a new trial, arguing the trial court erred in directing verdicts in favor of Jefferson Pilot and WCSC and in denying the Murphysâ€™ motion for directed verdicts.Â  The trial court denied the post-trial motions.Â  The Murphys appeal.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  In ruling on a motion for directed verdict the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 199, 592 S.E.2d 626, 627&nbsp;(2004).Â  The court must determine the elements of the action alleged and whether any evidence existed on each element.Â  First State\r\n  Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 446, 385 S.E.2d 821, 824 (1989).Â  An appellate court must apply the same standard when reviewing the trial judgeâ€™s decision on such motion.Â  See Weir v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 514-15, 435 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1993) (stating standard for appellate court).Â  \r\n  I.Â  Directed Verdicts \r\n  The Murphys argue the trial court erred in directing verdicts for WCSC and Jefferson Pilot and erred by refusing to direct verdicts in favor of the Murphys.Â  We find the trial court erred in granting WCSC and Jefferson Pilot directed verdicts but did not err in denying the Murphysâ€™ motion for directed verdicts.Â  \r\n  The trial judge explained he had studied the law and general principles of vicarious liability but found this case â€œbizarreâ€ and â€œuniqueâ€ and â€œin the written history of the law there has never been another case like it.â€Â  Without considering the evidence presented as to the vicarious liability of WCSC and Jefferson Pilot, the court concluded:Â  \r\n\r\n  To extend vicarious liability to the facts of this case would be beyond reason.Â  If there is any principle guiding the common law, it is reason.Â  There is no reason or public policy to extend the principle of vicarious liability to the facts of this case.Â  I grant the motion for a directed verdict on behalf of WCSC [and Jefferson Pilot]. \r\n\r\n  We find the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting WCSC and Jefferson Pilot directed verdicts based on public policy without considering the elements of the actions alleged and the evidence introduced at trial.Â  See Phelps, 299 S.C. at 446, 385 S.E.2d at 824 (in reviewing the granting of a directed verdict, the court should determine the elements of the action alleged and whether any evidence existed on each element).Â  \r\n  Although we concur with the trial court that the facts of this case are bizarre, we find the law governing vicarious liability should have been considered in reviewing the motions for directed verdicts.Â  Clearly, there is legal authority that â€œa principal may be held liable for defamatory statements made by an agent acting within the scope of his employment or within the scope of his apparent authority.â€Â  Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 139, 542 S.E.2d 743, 748 (Ct.

App. 2004).Â  â€œThe elements which must be proven to establish apparent agency are:Â  (1) that the purported principal consciously or impliedly represented another to be his agent; (2) that there was a reliance upon the representation; and (3) that there was a change of position to the relying partyâ€™s detriment.â€Â  Graves v.

Doe, 343 S.C. 119, 125, 539 S.E.2d 62, 64 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds, 352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002).Â  The issues of agency relationship and scope of employment are generally for the jury.Â  Crittenden, 288 S.C. at 115, 341 S.E.2d at 387;\r\n  Gathers, \r\n  282 S.C. at 226, 317 S.E.2d at 752.Â  \r\n  As to Feldmanâ€™s authority and scope of employment, Oâ€™Neill and Waring testified that Feldman told them Wing, the station manager at that time, gave Feldman the authority to write the Letter.Â  Feldman also told Oâ€™Neill that Dan McAlister, counsel for Jefferson Pilot, likely previewed the Letter.Â  The Letter was written on WCSC stationery and in it, Feldman purported to be motivated by a desire to protect Senn, the station, and Jefferson Pilot.Â  \r\n  There was evidence in the record that Feldman had broad authority to speak on behalf of WCSC, enter contracts on behalf of WCSC, respond to viewer complaints, and defend the station in letters to newspaper editors or reporters.Â  However, there was conflicting evidence that Feldman did not have authority. Â Senn testified that Feldman repeatedly told her that the matter was personal and not a WCSC matter.Â  Wing denied he ever reviewed or edited the Letter.Â  \r\n  Both Senn and DuTremble testified they believed Feldman had authority to act on WCSCâ€™s behalf.Â  Senn believed Feldmanâ€™s story regarding the incident on the plane and believed Feldman had the authority to write the Letter.Â  â€œI didnâ€™t ever see him write letters, but I assume he would have the authority.Â  He had the letterhead, but I -- you know, I donâ€™t know.â€Â  Senn also testified after she received a copy of the letter she gave it to DuTremble.Â  She then told DuTremble that she heard for years that Elizabeth talked badly about her, â€œBut then I finally had something in writing on Channel 5 letterhead.Â  So I gave it to my lawyer.â€Â  \r\n  DuTrembleâ€™s testimony also indicates he believed Feldman had authority to make the defamatory statements.Â  DuTremble testified in camera:[2]  \r\n\r\n  When I went to see Don Feldman, I went to see him as a potential witness.Â  I did not have in my mind anything to do with his position as news director.Â  \r\n  However, when you read [the Letter and the civil agreement], together, itâ€™s obvious that Don Feldman is acting in his position as news director, as an employee for the station, because to give effect ---\r\n  [The Court]:Â  No question thatâ€™s what his job was.\r\n  [DuTremble]:Â  Exactly.Â  To give effect to the civil agreement, he had to have that authority.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  DuTremble later testified:Â  \r\n\r\n  I mean, Don Feldman was -- you know, he was a member of the community.Â  He was -- he was known in the community.Â  He was news director, a person of some authority apparently.Â  So he carried some indicia of reliability with him . . . .\r\n\r\n  Acting on this belief, DuTremble wrote the October 4, 1999 letter to Wall, Elizabethâ€™s attorney.Â  \r\n  We find the questions of agency and scope of employment were issues for the jury to decide.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the Murphysâ€™ motion for directed verdicts but erred in directing verdicts in favor of WCSC and Jefferson Pilot.Â  \r\n  II.Â  Ratification\r\n  The Murphys also argue WCSC and Jefferson Pilotâ€™s ratification of Feldmanâ€™s acts warranted submission of the case to the jury.Â  We find this issue is not properly preserved for our review.Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â \r\n  Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â  The Murphys did not assert the argument of ratification to the trial court or in their Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Because the Murphys raised this argument for the first time on appeal, we find it is not properly preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  III.Â  Admission of Evidence \r\n  The Murphys argue the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of Dale DuTremble.[3]Â  The decision whether or not to admit testimony into evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â \r\n  Am. Fed. Bank v. Number One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 174, 467 S.E.2d 439, 442 (1996).Â  \r\n  The trial court found DuTrembleâ€™s testimony related to Feldmanâ€™s authority at the time he met with DuTremble and Senn rather than Feldmanâ€™s authority at the time he wrote the Letter.Â  The court found the testimony relevant, but the admission of the testimony would confuse the jury, outweighing its probative value.Â  Accordingly, after consideration of Rules 701 and 403, SCRE, the trial court excluded the testimony.Â  \r\n  Rule 701, SCRE, states: \r\n\r\n  If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witnessâ€™ testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which (a) are rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) are helpful to a clear understanding of the witnessâ€™ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) do not require special knowledge, skill, experience or training.\r\n\r\n  Rule 403, SCRE, provides:Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€ \r\n  \r\n In this case, DuTremble was testifying as a fact witness.Â  His testimony was relevant to his perceptions and helpful to a clear understanding of a fact in issue.Â  We fail to see undue prejudice to the defendants.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this portion of DuTrembleâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the matter is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n  AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  \r\n  GOOLSBY and HUFF,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Elizabeth is referred to in the record as both Elizabeth Murphy and Elizabeth Stuckey.Â  We refer to her as Elizabeth.Â  \r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court denied the Murphysâ€™ request to enter this testimony into evidence.Â  However, the Murphys challenge the trial courtâ€™s ruling in this appeal and we find the trial court erred in excluding this testimony.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decline to address any other evidentiary issue on appeal.Â  See Dixon v.

Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), and Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  Based on the admission of this forbidden propensity evidence, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nAnthony Rice was arrested by the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Office in December of 2001 and charged with conspiracy to traffic in crack cocaine. Â Rice cooperated with law enforcement as an â€œundercover operative,â€ and, in an effort to â€œwork offâ€ his charge, he agreed â€œto set Kwasi [Tuffour] up.â€ \r\nOn December 18, 2001, Riceâ€™s cell phone was â€œwired,â€ and he called Tuffour, presumably to arrange a purchase of five ounces of crack cocaine. The conversation was recorded by law enforcement, but only Riceâ€™s voice is audible on the tape.[1] Following the conversation, Rice was â€œwired,â€ and he drove to the Anderson County town of Belton.Â  He stopped in a known drug area referred to as the â€œtree.â€Â  Several officers with the sheriffâ€™s office conducted surveillance in the area.Â  \r\nRice remained at the â€œtreeâ€ for approximately three hours and engaged in numerous conversations, none of which were recorded.Â  The vehicle that Tuffour was driving[2] passed by the area, and Rice returned to his vehicle and followed Tuffour.Â  The vehicles stopped at a nearby apartment complex.Â  Rice exited his vehicle and approached the vehicle occupied by Tuffour and another person, later identified as a juvenile.Â  The conversation which ensued was recorded, but the recording quality is poor.Â  When Rice gave the prearranged signal to law enforcement, officers immediately approached the vehicle.Â  Tuffour and the other occupant were taken from the vehicle.Â  Crack cocaine was found in the vehicle, and both Tuffour and the juvenile occupant were charged.Â  \r\nBased on the December 18th incident, Tuffour was indicted for trafficking in crack cocaine, 100 to 200 grams.Â  The State succeeded in admitting, over Tuffourâ€™s objection, testimony from Rice that he had purchased crack cocaineâ€”typically five ounces at a timeâ€”from Tuffour on numerous prior occasions.Â  The State contended that this evidence concerning alleged prior drug sales was proper under the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle and Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  The State asserted that Tuffour would not have sold five ounces of crack cocaine to Rice without the prior relationship and transactions.Â  The trial court additionally admitted evidence in connection with the tape recordings as well as a redacted version of Tuffourâ€™s criminal record to impeach his testimony.Â  Tuffour was convicted and sentenced, and he now challenges these evidentiary rulings on appeal.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citation omitted).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling admitting evidence, including prior bad act evidence, is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTuffour argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence that Rice, on several prior occasions, had purchased crack cocaine from him in unrelated transactions. Tuffour specifically asserts the admission of this evidence patently violates the rule in Lyle and Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  We agree.\r\nPerhaps no tenet of evidence law in the context of â€œprior bad actsâ€ is more firmly established than the principle that propensity or character evidence is inadmissible to prove the specific crime charged:\r\n\r\nThat contention is grounded upon the familiar and salutary general rule, universally recognized and firmly established in all English-speaking countries, that evidence of other distinct crimes committed by the accused may not be adduced merely to raise an inference or to corroborate the prosecutionâ€™s theory of the defendantâ€™s guilt of the particular crime charged . . . [p]roof that a defendant has been guilty of another crime equally heinous prompts to a ready acceptance of and belief in the prosecutionâ€™s theory that he is guilty of the crime charged.Â  Its effect is to predispose the mind of the juror to believe the prisoner guilty, and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.Â  It . . . â€˜raises a variety of issues, and thus diverts the attention of the jury from the one immediately before it.â€™\r\n\r\nLyle, 125 S.C. atÂ  415-16, 118 S.E. at 807 (internal citations omitted).\r\nThis rule of evidence is universally recognized in American jurisprudence and is necessary to ensure that the presumption of innocence is not relegated to an empty phrase: \r\n\r\nIt is a well-established common-law rule that in a criminal prosecution, proof which shows or tends to show that the accused is guilty of the commission of other offenses at other times, even though they are of the same nature as the one charged in the indictment, is inadmissible for the purpose of showing the commission of the particular crime charged.Â  This rule has been recognized and applied in cases involving prosecutions for the sale of narcotics, so that as a general rule, subject to the exceptions . . . , where the state charges a particular sale of narcotics, it is not proper to admit proof of other sales, for the purpose of establishing the particular sale charged. \r\n\r\nA. Petry, Admissibility in Prosecution for Illegal Sale of Narcotics of Evidence of Other Sales, 93 A.L.R.2d 1097, Â§ 3 (1964).\r\nThere are exceptions to the general rule of inadmissibility:\r\n\r\n[U]nder Lyle, evidence of these other bad acts may be admitted to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt if that evidence establishes:Â  (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) absence of mistake or accident; (4) identity; or (5) a common scheme or plan involving other crimes so closely related to the one charged that proof of one tends to prove the other.\r\n\r\nState v. Barroso, 328 S.C. 268, 271, 493 S.E.2d 854, 855 (1997) (emphasis in original).\r\nIn the present case, the trial court relied only on the common scheme or plan exception.[3] When this exception is invoked by the State, it is important to recognize that a close degree of similarity between the prior bad acts and the crime charged, by itself, does not satisfy Lyle.Â  Indeed, the mere presence of similarity only serves to enhance the potential for prejudice.Â  State v. Gore, 283 S.C. 118, 121, 322 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1984).[4]Â  The foundation for admissibility transcends mere similarity, for the admission of such evidence under the common scheme or plan exception requires a connection between the extraneous crimes and the crime charged so that proof of the former tends to prove the latter.Â  Succinctly stated, prior bad act evidence must be relevant to prove the alleged crime. See State v. Timmons, 327 S.C. 48, 52, 488 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1997) (â€œA common scheme or plan concerns more than the commission of two similar crimes; some connection between the crimes is necessary.â€);Â  State v. Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 95, 480 S.E.2d 77, 80 (1997) (â€œThe common scheme or plan [exception] concerns more than the commission of two similar crimes; some connection between the crimes is necessary.â€);Â  State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 234, 433 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1993) (noting that â€œa general similarity . . . [is] insufficient to support the common scheme or plan exceptionâ€);Â  State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 27-28, 393 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 (1990) (noting that â€œevidence of other crimes is never admissible unless necessary to establish a material fact or element of the crime chargedâ€);Â  State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 324, 360 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1987) (â€œEvidence of other crimes is never admissible unless necessary to establish a material fact or element of the crime charged.â€);Â  State v. Stokes, 279 S.C. 191, 193, 304 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1983) (â€œThe â€˜common scheme or planâ€™ exception requires more than mere commission of two similar crimes by the same person.Â  There must be some connection between the crimes.Â  If there is any doubt as to the connection between the acts, the evidence should not be admitted.â€); State v. Wallace, Op. No. 3971 (Ct. App. filed Mar. 28, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 30) (finding the trial court erred in admitting evidence of alleged prior bad acts merely because the prior acts were similar to the crime charged; holding instead that the trial court should look beyond mere close similarity to consider the connection between extraneous bad act and the crime charged); State v. Carter, 323 S.C. 465, 467, 476 S.E.2d 916, 917-18 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that â€œ[i]n the prosecution of one crime, proof of another direct substantive crime is never admissible unless there is some legal connection between the two upon which it can be said that one tends to establish the other or some essential fact in issueâ€; and further noting that â€œevidence of prior bad acts must be relevant to prove the alleged crimeâ€); State v. Campbell, 317 S.C. 449, 451, 454 S.E.2d 899, 901 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding that â€œthe evidence of prior bad acts must be relevant to prove the alleged crimeâ€).\r\nThe appellate courts of this state have unwaveringly adhered to the rule of exclusion of prior bad act evidence to show criminal propensity or that the defendant is a bad person unworthy of the presumption of innocence.Â  It bears reminder that Lyle and Rule 404(b) set forth a rule of exclusion, not inclusion.Â  The common scheme or plan exception is perhaps the most difficult exception to apply, for in the context of other exceptions to the rule (motive and identity, for example), the relevance (or lack of relevance) of the prior bad act is more easily discerned.[5]Â  When assessing the purported relevance of prior bad act evidence to the crime charged, we find the analytical framework advanced in Lyle helpful: \r\n\r\nWhether evidence of other distinct crimes properly falls within any of the recognized exceptions noted is often a difficult matter to determine.Â  The acid test is its logical relevancy to the particular excepted purpose or purposes for which it is sought to be introduced.Â  If it is logically pertinent in that it reasonably tends to prove a material fact in issue, it is not to be rejected merely because it incidentally proves the defendant guilty of another crime.Â  But the dangerous tendency and misleading probative force of this class of evidence require that its admission should be subjected by the Courts to rigid scrutiny.Â  Whether the requisite degree of relevancy exists is a judicial question to be resolved in the light of the consideration that the inevitable tendency of such evidence is to raise a legally spurious presumption of guilt in the minds of the jurors.Â  Hence, if the Court does not clearly perceive the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the crime charged, that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt, and the evidence should be rejected.\r\n\r\nLyle, 125 S.C. at 416-17, 118 S.E. at 807 (emphasis added).\r\nWe find instructive the case of State v. Campbell, 317 S.C. 449, 454 S.E.2d 899 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Campbell was charged with and convicted of distribution of crack cocaine.Â  A police informant, Timothy Bellamy, conducted a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Campbell, resulting in the charged offense.Â  Over Campbellâ€™s objection, the trial court allowed Bellamy to testifyâ€”pursuant to the common scheme or plan exceptionâ€”that he had purchased crack cocaine from Campbell on prior occasions. Â This court reversed, stating:\r\n\r\nHere, the testimony is of prior drug sales utilizing a similar sales technique.Â  However, this is not enough to satisfy Lyle.Â  Campbell was tried on a single charge of distribution.Â  The methodology of prior sales is not relevant to prove this transaction.Â  Several police who were present at the transaction and arrest testified.Â  The confidential informant also testified.Â  By introducing the prior bad acts, the State was not trying to prove a common scheme but to convince the jury that because Campbell sold crack cocaine in the past, he was selling crack cocaine on this occasion.Â  This is precisely the type of inference that Lyle prohibits.\r\n\r\nId. at 451, 454 S.E.2d at 901.\r\nWe reached the same result under strikingly similar facts in State v. Carter, 323 S.C. 465, 476 S.E.2d 916 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Gary Stamps was arrested for possession of crack cocaine on January 14, 1994, after leaving the home of the defendant, Charles Carter.Â  Stamps claimed he purchased the drugs from Carter.Â  Stamps agreed to cooperate with police and, four days later on January 18th, he made a controlled purchase from Carter.Â  At Carterâ€™s trial for the January 18th incident, the trial court permitted the State to elicit testimony from Stamps concerning the January 14th purchase.Â  On appeal, this court reversed, firmly rejecting the Stateâ€™s reliance on the common scheme or plan exception.Â  The Carter court held â€œ[t]here is no legal connection between these two purchases sufficient to come within the framework of the common scheme or plan exception.â€Â  Id. at 468, 476 S.E.2d at 918.\r\nTuffour was charged with a single charge of trafficking.Â  His alleged prior drug dealings have no relevance whatsoever to the charged offense.Â  The Stateâ€™s argument that Tuffour would not have sold five ounces of crack cocaine to Rice in December without the â€œprior relationshipâ€ and transactions is specious, for the alleged first sale from Tuffour to Rice in August supposedly involved five ounces of crack cocaine.Â  The crime here stands on its own, and â€œ[t]he methodology of prior sales is not relevant to prove this transaction.â€[6]Â  Campbell, 317 S.C. at 451, 454 S.E.2d at 901.Â  The State here â€œwas not trying to prove a common scheme but to convince the jury that because [Tuffour] sold crack cocaine in the past, he was selling crack cocaine on this occasion.Â  This is precisely the type of inference that Lyle prohibits.â€Â  Id.  \r\nApplying these principles and precedent to the present case, we perceive no legal connection or relevance between the alleged prior drug sales and the crime charged.Â  The prejudice in this testimony is manifest.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.[7]\r\nBecause we reverse and remand this matter for a new trial due to the improper admission of Tuffourâ€™s alleged prior bad acts, we need not address the remaining evidentiary exceptions raised by Tuffour.Â  See, e.g, Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining that the appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive); Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (noting that appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive); State v. Rivers, 273 S.C. 75, 79, 254 S.E.2d 299, 301 (1979) (declining to address additional errors raised by appellant in light of the courtâ€™s decision to reverse and remand the case on a challenged evidentiary ruling).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we reverse Tuffourâ€™s conviction and remand for a new trial.Â  \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur. \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â  [1]Â  It appears the inability to hear both Rice and Tuffour may have been the result of improper installation of the recording equipment by law enforcement.\r\nÂ Â Â Â  [2]Â  There was evidence Tuffour was driving someone elseâ€™s car. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â  [3] When a prior bad act is not the subject of a conviction, it must be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 468, 523 S.E.2d 787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  No issue is presented to us concerning this threshold determination.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â  [4] Similarly, in the area of impeachment under Rule 609, SCRE, courts are disinclined to admit prior similar convictions due to the unmistakable prejudice that would likely result. See Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433, 527 S.E.2d 98, 100-01 (2000) (noting that because prior convictions for the same or similar crimes are highly prejudicial, they should be admitted sparingly); State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 627, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2000) (including â€œthe similarity between the past crime and the charged crimeâ€ as a factor weighing against admissibility). \r\nÂ Â Â Â  [5] There are situations where the relevance between the prior bad act evidence and the crime charged is clearly perceived, often when the crime charged contains an element that is directly linked to the bad act evidence.Â  In State v. Wilson, the court held that â€œevidence of a prior drug transaction is relevant on the issue of intent when the defendant has been charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.â€Â  345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 830 (2001).Â  In State v. Raffaldt, the defendant was indicted for trafficking in cocaine. 318 S.C. 110, 112, 456 S.E.2d 390, 391 (1995).Â  The trial court allowed bad act evidence of â€œmarijuana dealingâ€ during the cocaine conspiracy.Â  The supreme court affirmed the admission of this bad act evidence, finding â€œthat the method of marijuana dealing between Raffaldt and [a co-conspirator] was quite similar to the cocaine conspiracy.â€ Id. at 114, 456 S.E.2d at 392.Â  In State v. Moultrie, the defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and this court affirmed the admission of Moultrieâ€™s â€œinvolvement . . . in the drug trade,â€ noting that â€œthe challenged [bad act] testimony was clearly relevant to the question of whether Moultrie possessed drugs with the intent to distribute them on the night of his arrest.â€Â  316 S.C. 547, 554, 451 S.E.2d 34, 38-39 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The nature of the chargesâ€”and the related bad act evidenceâ€”in Wilson, Raffaldt and Moultrie present circumstances far removed from those before us today, for Tuffourâ€™s alleged single act of drug trafficking requires no showing of intent and is otherwise unrelated to his purported prior dealings with Rice.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â  [6] Rice testified in the in camera hearing that he â€œstarted outâ€ by purchasing five ounces of crack cocaine from Tuffour; that he â€œjust bought individually [from Tuffour] whenever [he] needed it;â€ that the purchases were not connected, for there was never an agreement to â€œbuy more.â€ \r\nÂ Â Â Â  [7] The State makes no claim that the erroneous admission of this propensity evidence was harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3990","title":"Cowburn v.

Jay Pontrelli, both of Atlanta, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  James Cowburn brought several causes of action against Andrew Leventis and Fidelity National Bank related to his investment in a Ponzi scheme.[1]Â  Both Leventis and Fidelity made motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nJames Cowburn contributed financially to a series of investments collectively known as the â€œCash 4 Titles Programâ€ (the Program).Â  The Program, as it was described to Cowburn, engaged in the business of issuing short-term, high interest rate notes and bonds for the purpose of funding the automobile title lending industry.Â  Cowburn first learned of the Program from a former co-worker, Clyde Matkin.Â  Matkin then referred Cowburn to Andrew Leventis, an attorney who Matkin stated could get him into the Program.Â  During Cowburnâ€™s meeting with Leventis, Leventis provided further details about the Program.Â  Subsequently, Leventis arranged to accompany Cowburn on a trip to Atlanta to meet with Michael Gause, a principal in the Program.Â  Cowburn alleges he decided to invest in the Program based on his conversations with Leventis and Gause.Â  \r\nCowburn used money from his individual retirement account (IRA) to invest in the Program.Â  According to Cowburn, Leventis informed him that Gause chose Fidelity National Bank as the conduit through which investors could contribute to the Program.Â  Cowburn opened a self-directed individual retirement account (SDIRA) with Fidelity and transferred money from his other accounts into this SDIRA.Â  Cowburn then completed the necessary paperwork to enable Fidelity to invest the money from his SDIRA into various notes and bonds connected with the Program.Â  Specifically, Cowburnâ€™s investments consisted of:Â  (1) a 270-day promissory note from Bellwether Holdings for $150,000, dated September 1, 1998; (2) a 270-day promissory note from Bellwether holdings for $100,227, dated October 1, 1998 ; (3) a seven-year bond from Southwestern Holdings for $318,000, issued on February 1, 1999; (4) a seven-year bond from Southwestern Holdings for $12,000, issued on April 1, 1999; (5) a seven-year bond from Southwestern Holdings for $14,000, issued on June 1, 1999; (6) a 270-day promissory note from Southern Title Holdings for $15,000, dated August 1, 1999; and (7) a 270-day promissory note from Southern Title Holdings for $43,000, dated September 1, 1999.\r\nThe Program initially performed as expected, and Cowburn received the interest payments he anticipated.Â  However, in October of 1999, Cowburn received a call from Leventis informing him that his money was gone.Â  Leventis informed Cowburn the Program was actually an illegal Ponzi scheme and that Gause had been arrested in connection with it. \r\nCowburn filed suit against both Leventis and Fidelity, alleging the following causes of action: (1) legal negligence against Leventis; (2) breach of fiduciary duty against Leventis and Fidelity; (3) violation of the South Carolina Uniform Securities Act against Leventis and Fidelity; (4) violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act against Leventis; (5) fraud against Leventis and Fidelity; (6) negligence against Fidelity; and (7) civil conspiracy against Leventis and Fidelity.Â  Leventis and Fidelity filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court issued an order granting both Leventisâ€™s and Fidelityâ€™s motions.Â  Cowburn appeals.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Trousdell v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 639, 572 S.E.2d 264, 265&nbsp;(2002).Â  Pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP, summary judgment may be affirmed if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  â€œOn appeal from summary judgment, the reviewing court must consider the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â \r\nCantrell v. Green, 302 S.C. 557, 559, 397 S.E.2d 777, 778 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Leventis? \r\n\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violation of the South Carolina Securities Act \r\n\r\nCowburn argues the trial court erred in finding there was no material issue of fact concerning his allegation that Leventis violated sections of the South Carolina Uniform Securities Act (the Act).Â  We agree.Â  \r\nInitially, in order to determine whether the act was triggered, we must decide whether the investments made by Cowburn are securities.Â  Section 35-1-20(15) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) provides the definition of â€œsecurityâ€ as â€œany note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, [or] evidence of indebtedness, . . . .â€Â  Cowburnâ€™s investments, as indicated on the statements he received from Fidelity, consisted of promissory notes and bonds.Â  Therefore, Cowburnâ€™s investments in the Program were securities pursuant to the Act.Â  See McGaha v. Mosley,&nbsp;283 S.C. 268, 273, 322 S.E.2d 461, 464&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984) (â€œAn instrument may be included within any of the Actâ€™s definitions of a â€˜security,â€™ if on its face it answers to the name or description contained therein.â€).Â  \r\nBecause the investments were securities, the next issue we must resolve is whether Leventisâ€™s sale of those securities gave rise to a cause of action under the Act.Â  â€œThe South Carolina Uniform Securities Act . . . created public enforcement provisions as well as private civil remedies which are compensatory in nature.Â  The Act authorizes the state Securities Commissioner to enforce its provisions, while giving private plaintiffs a limited civil right of action for securities fraud.â€Â  Atlanta Skin &amp; Cancer Clinic, P.C. v. Hallmark Gen. Partners, Inc.,\r\n320 S.C. 113, 116-17, 463 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1995).Â  Section 35-1-1490 provides a private right of action for buyers of securities against â€œ[a]ny person who . . . offers or sells a security in violation of . . . Section 35-1-410 or Section 35-1-810 . . . .â€[2]Â Â Â  Cowburn argues the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment to Leventis because genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Leventis violated the Act.Â  Specifically, Cowburn asserts that (1) the securities were not registered pursuant to section 35-1-810, and (2) Leventis failed to register as a broker-dealer in violation of section 35-1-410.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 35-1-810 states:Â  â€œIt is unlawful for any person to offer or sell any security in this State unless (a) it is registered under this chapter, (b) the security or transaction is exempted under Section 35-1-310 or 35-1-320 . . . .â€Â  Leventis argues he did not act in violation of section 35-1-810 because (1) he did not offer to sell the securities, and (2) the securities were exempt under sections 35-1-310 and -320.\r\nAn â€œoffer to sellâ€ securities is defined in section 35-1-20(13)(b) as â€œevery attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a security interest in a security for value.â€Â  In this case, Leventisâ€™s role in the Program went beyond simply recommending an investment to a friend; rather Leventis played an integral role in the Program.Â  Leventis introduced investors, such as Cowburn and Matkin, to the Program.Â  In his deposition, Leventis stated he referred people to the Program and received a referral fee for doing so.Â  Leventis confirmed he referred approximately twenty people to the Program.Â  Leventis told potential investors about the Program and provided written information to them regarding the Program.Â  Leventis persuaded potential investors to contribute to the program by telling them about other investors, including him and his mother, and their contributions.Â  He also arranged trips for potential investors to meet with Gause and other principals of the Program.Â  After individuals decided to invest in the Program, Leventis assisted them in making their investment by providing them with forms and information about how to set up a SDIRA.Â  He even went further in some cases by filling out the forms for investors and assisting them with transactions.Â  Additionally, Cowburn testified he viewed Leventis as selling the investments purchased under the Program.Â  Thus, we find a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Leventis offered to sell securities.\r\nFurther, we find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the securities were exempt under sections 35-1-310 and -320.Â  Section 35-1-310(9) exempts short-term commercial paper from the registration requirements of section 35-1-810, stating: \r\n\r\nAny commercial paper which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions and which evidences an obligation to pay cash within nine months of the date of issuance . . . or any renewal of such paper which is likewise limited, or any guarantee of such paper or of any such renewal . . . .\r\n\r\nIn this case, Cowburnâ€™s initial investment consisted of short-term commercial paper exempted under section 35-1-310(9) because it was an investment in 270-day promissory notes,[3] which were obligated to be paid within nine months.Â Â  \r\nHowever, Cowburnâ€™s subsequent investments were funded in part by the redemption proceeds on those short-term notes and included several seven-year bonds.Â  Leventis asserts that these transactions were similarly exempted from the securities registration requirement of section 35-1-810 because they were â€œrolloverâ€ transactions.Â  Section 35-1-320(11) provides that â€œ[a]ny transaction pursuant to an offer to existing security holders of the issuer, including persons who at the time of the transaction are holders of convertible securities, [is an exempt transaction], if (a) no commission or other remuneration, other than a standby commission, is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting any security holder in this State or (b) the issuer first files a notice specifying the terms of the offer and the securities commissioner does not . . .Â  disallow the exemption . . . .â€Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, Cowburn did not invest with the same issuer for each transaction.Â  His initial investments were with Bellwether Holdings, but subsequent transactions included investments with Southwestern Holdings.Â  Further, Leventisâ€™s and Priority Advisorsâ€™ tax returns reflect income from â€œreferral feesâ€ for the years 1998 and 1999 respectively.Â  Because a material issue of fact exists as to whether the securities were exempt, the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Leventis on Cowburnâ€™s allegation that he violated section 35-1-810 of the Act.Â  See Gordon v. Drews, 358 S.C. 598, 606, 595 S.E.2d 864, 868 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating that exemptions from the Act must be narrowly construed to protect investors);\r\nCantrell v. Green, 302 S.C. 557, 559, 397 S.E.2d 777, 778 (Ct. App. 1990) (stating that in reviewing a grant of summary judgment, a reviewing court must consider the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party).\r\nMoreover, we also find a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Cowburnâ€™s allegation that Leventis failed to register as a broker-dealer in violation of section 35-1-410.Â  Section 35-1-410 states:Â  â€œIt is unlawful for any person to transact business in this State as a broker-dealer or agent unless he is registered under this chapter or exempt from licensing under this chapter.â€Â  Section 35-1-20 defines a â€œbroker-dealerâ€ as â€œany person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others or for his own accountâ€ and an â€œagentâ€ as â€œany individual, other than a broker-dealer, who represents a broker-dealer or issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities.â€ \r\n\r\nAs set forth above, the evidence indicates that Leventis played an essential role in marketing and referring investors to the Program.Â  Leventis also provided investors with forms to set up a SDIRA with Fidelity, and in some cases, completed the forms for customers.Â  In 1998, Leventisâ€™s tax return reflected over $120,000 in referral fees from the Program.Â  In addition, Leventis was the sole owner of Priority Advisors, which he described as being in the business of referring people to the Program.Â  In 1999, the tax return for Priority Advisors reflected $297,367 in income from referrals. Priority Advisors also received an ownership interest in Southwestern Holdings, one of the entities under the Program, without purchasing it.Â  The subscription agreement for Southwestern Holdings indicates Leventis served as its marketing manager at the time Cowburn made his investment in Southwestern Holdings.Â  \r\nThis evidence indicates Leventis may have been â€œeffecting transactions in securitiesâ€ when he referred Cowburn to the program.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-20(2) and (3).Â  Thus, evidence exists that Leventis acted as a broker-dealer or agent of Priority Advisors and Southwestern Holdings pursuant to section 35-1-20 of the South Carolina Code.Â  \r\nLeventis does not dispute that he was not registered as a broker-dealer or agent.Â  Rather, Leventis argues even if he were a broker-dealer or agent, he was exempt from the registration requirement.\r\nLeventis argues he was exempt from registering as a broker-dealer because the securities he dealt with were exempted securities pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-310(9) (providing that short-term commercial paper is a security exempt from the registration requirement of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-810).Â  Section 35-1-415(3)(b) provides that agents acting for an issuer effecting transactions in securities that are exempt from registering under 35-1-310(9) are exempt from the registration requirements of section 35-1-410.Â  \r\nAs stated above, we find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the securities were exempt securities.Â  Likewise, we find a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Leventis was exempt from registering as an agent of an issuer based on section 35-1-415(3)(b).\r\nLeventis further asserts that South Carolina Attorney General Order Number 97003 exempts him from registration as an agent because it permits an officer or director of Southwestern to make sales of securities without registration.Â  The relevant section of Order Number 97003 reads as follows:\r\n\r\nNo principal, partner, officer, or director of an issuer offering its securities under a South Carolina registration, shall engage in the sale of securities in South Carolina without a Sales Permit or registration as a securities agent.Â  Sales Permits will be deemed to have been issued unless notification of disallowance is provided to the issuer by the Securities Commissioner following at least thirty (30) days prior notice to the Office of the Securities Commissioner, filed in duplicate with a return envelope, of the names and corporate titles of each principal, partner, officer and director of the issuer along with a signed statement from each of the individuals selling the securities indicating they:Â  (1) perform or are intended to perform substantial duties for or on behalf of the issuer otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities and (2) will not be compensated in connection with their participation by payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nNothing in the record, including the cover letter provided by the Attorney General, suggests that Leventis met the requirements of Order Number 97003 by giving thirty days notice, along with a sworn statement that he would perform duties â€œother than in connection with transactions in securitiesâ€ or that he would not be compensated for his participation.Â  We find genuine issues of fact exist as to whether Order Number 97003 exempts Leventis from registration as a broker-dealer or agent. See Gordon, 358 S.C. at 606, 595 S.E.2d at 868;\r\nCantrell, 302 S.C. at 559, 397 S.E.2d at 778. Therefore, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment as to Cowburnâ€™s private cause of action under section 35-1-410.[4] \r\n\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud\r\n\r\nCowburn asserts the trial court erred in determining no genuine issue of material fact existed to show Leventis defrauded him.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn order to establish a claim for fraud, a plaintiff must establish the following elements: â€œa representation; its falsity; its materiality; knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; intent that the representation be acted upon; hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; hearerâ€™s right to rely; and hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.â€Â  First State Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps,\r\n299 S.C. 441, 446-47, 385 S.E.2d 821, 824 (1989).Â Â Â  â€œEach and every one of these elements must be proven by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.â€Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch,&nbsp;354 S.C. 648, 672, 582 S.E.2d 432, 445&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).\r\nFirst, Cowburn asserts Leventis misrepresented the status of the bonds issued by two of the entities affiliated with the program, Southwestern Holdings and Southwestern Title Holdings.Â  However, Cowburn fails to specify the misrepresentation.Â  In addition, Cowburn fails to assert evidence of the other necessary elements in order to establish his claim for fraud.Â  Because Cowburn did not assert a representation or any of the other required elements of fraud, we find no genuine issue of material fact with regard to this claim. \r\nThe only other misrepresentation asserted by Cowburn was Leventisâ€™s statement that his mother invested $50,000 in the Program.Â  Cowburn contends this statement is contradictory to a statement Leventis made at his deposition that he invested only $30,000 of his motherâ€™s money in the Program.Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s determination that Cowburn neither presented evidence of the falsity of Leventisâ€™s statement nor established that it was material to his decision to invest in the Program.Â  In addition, Cowburn did not present evidence of Leventisâ€™s intent for him to rely on the statement.Â Â Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Leventis on this issue.Â  \r\n\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breach of Fiduciary Duty \r\n\r\nCowburn argues there was a material issue of fact regarding his claim that Leventis owed him a fiduciary duty, violated that duty, and acted negligently.[5]Â  Cowburn maintains Leventisâ€™s duties to him arose because Leventis acted as a seller of securities, and Leventis breached this duty by failing to investigate investments under the Program.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe determination of whether a fiduciary relationship exists is an equitable issue to be determined by the court.Â \r\nHendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458, 578 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003).Â  â€œA fiduciary relationship exists when one reposes special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.â€Â \r\nOâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992).Â  Moreover, the evidence must show the entrusted party â€œâ€˜actually accepted or induced the confidence placed in him.â€™â€Â \r\nState v. Parris, 353 S.C. 582, 593, 578 S.E.2d 736, 742 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 423, 483 S.E.2d 477, 484 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  \r\nA broker or dealer of securities is an agent of the buyer, and therefore, generally owes the buyer fiduciary duties.Â  These duties often include the duty to account for all funds and property belonging to the buyer, to refrain from acting adversely to the buyerâ€™s interest, to avoid engaging in fraudulent conduct, and to communicate any information he or she may acquire that would be to the buyerâ€™s advantage.Â  See 12 Am. Jur. 2d Brokers Â§ 109 (1997).Â  However, Cowburn has not cited any case that imposes a fiduciary duty upon a broker to investigate for any unknown potential risks of investment.Â  Cf., 12 Am. Jur. 2d Brokers Â§ 128 (1997) (asserting that a loan broker, who has agreed to find a specific type and quality loan for the customer, has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to ensure the loans were of that specific type and quality); Â Regions Bank v. Schmauch,&nbsp; 354 S.C. 648, 671, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (stating that bank may be held to a fiduciary duty to disclose material facts if it undertakes to advise); Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 251, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œParties in a fiduciary relationship must fully disclose to each other all known information that is significant and material, and when this duty to disclose is triggered, silence may constitute fraud.â€ (emphasis added)); Â Â Â Eaddy v. Dorn,&nbsp; 289 S.C. 356, 359, 345 S.E.2d 513, 514-15&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986) (finding term â€œbrokerâ€ included any person hired to conduct an auction for a fee and reaffirming a brokerâ€™s fiduciary duty to keep its principal â€œfully and promptly informed of all material facts that come to the brokerâ€™s knowledge with respect to the transaction in which the broker is engaged, affect the principalâ€™s interest, and might influence the principalâ€™s action.â€ (emphasis added)); Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc. v. Lighthouse Realty, Inc.,&nbsp; 286 S.C. 261, 267-68, 332 S.E.2d 781, 785&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985) (â€œA [real estate] broker owes a duty to its principal to keep it fully and promptly informed of all material facts that come to the brokerâ€™s knowledge with respect to the transaction in which the broker is engaged, affect the principalâ€™s interest, and might influence the principalâ€™s action.â€ (emphasis added)).Â  See also Jordan v. UBS AG, 782 N.Y.S.2d 722 (App. Div. 1st Depâ€™t 2004) (finding customerâ€™s allegation of breach of fiduciary duty against bond broker precluded by agreements between customer and broker in which customer acknowledged his own responsibility for making investment decisions and investigations).Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment as to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.Â  \r\n\r\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligence \r\n\r\nCowburn also alleges an issue of material fact exists regarding whether Leventis acted negligently in failing to investigate the Program before recommending it to him.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œOrdinarily, the common law imposes no duty on a person to act.Â  Where an act is voluntarily undertaken, however, the actor assumes the duty to use due care.â€Â \r\nHendricks, 353 S.C. at 456-57, 578 S.E.2d at 714 (citations omitted). \r\nHere again, Cowburn cites no authority for the proposition that Leventis was under a duty to investigate, nor does the evidence indicate he undertook such a duty.Â  The record indicates Leventisâ€™s role in the Program was to refer investors to the Program, and in that capacity, we do not find a duty to investigate.Â  Therefore, the trial court acted appropriately in granting summary judgment on Cowburnâ€™s negligence cause of action.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Fidelity?\r\n\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AgencyÂ Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nCowburn argues Fidelity established an agency relationship with Leventis by giving him apparent authority to act on its behalf.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe test to determine agency is whether or not the purported principal has the right to control the conduct of the alleged agent.â€Â  Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 144, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982) (emphasis in original).Â  â€œAn agency relationship may be established by evidence of actual or apparent authority.â€Â \r\nCharleston, S.C. Registry for Golf &amp; Tourism, Inc. v. Young Clement Rivers &amp; Tisdale, LLP,\r\n359 S.C. 635, 642, 598 S.E.2d 717, 721 (Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted).Â  â€œThe elements which must be proven to establish apparent agency are: (1) that the purported principal consciously or impliedly represented another to be his agent; (2) that there was a reliance upon the representation; and (3) that there was a change of position to the relying partyâ€™s detriment.â€Â \r\nGraves v. Serbin Farms, Inc., 306 S.C. 60, 62, 409 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1991) (citation omitted).Â  â€œ[A]n agency may not be established solely by the declarations and conduct of an alleged agent.â€Â \r\nFrasier v. Palmetto Homes of Florence, Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 245, 473 S.E.2d 865, 868 (Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted). \r\nCowburn contends Leventisâ€™s apparent authority is evidenced by Fidelity giving Leventis application packages for SDIRAs, forms, and business cards of Fidelity employees.Â  In addition, Cowburn states Leventis bolstered his apparent agency by filling out the forms for investors and by dealing directly with Fidelity.Â  We find these actions do not establish the elements necessary to form apparent authority.Â  First, supplying forms and employee business cards to Leventis does not amount to a representation that Leventis was an agent of Fidelity nor suggest that Fidelity had the right to control Leventis.Â  Second, given that supplying Leventis with forms and business cards was the only action taken by Fidelity to evidence apparent authority, this is not enough to produce reliance by Cowburn.Â  Third, Cowburn does not argue how he relied on this action by Fidelity to his detriment.Â  Furthermore, the actions by Leventis, which Cowburn asserts bolstered his perception of an agency relationship, should not be considered because they are actions by the purported agent, not the principal.Â  See id. at 244-45, 473 S.E.2d at 868&nbsp;(â€œApparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.â€ (emphasis in original)).Â  Therefore, we find no genuine issue of material fact exists to support Cowburnâ€™s claim that Leventis was an agent of Fidelity.Â  \r\n\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affidavit\r\n\r\nCowburn argues the trial court failed to consider the affidavit from his expert, Thomas Mason, in resolving the motion for summary judgment, asserting the affidavit creates an issue of material fact as to the duties Fidelity owed to Cowburn.[6]Â  We find Cowburn did not preserve this issue for our review.Â  \r\nIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â \r\nLucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â  When a trial court makes a general ruling on an issue, but does not address the specific argument raised by a party, that party must make a Rule 59(e) motion asking the trial court to rule on the issue in order to preserve it for appeal.Â  See \r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).Â  \r\nLeventis and Fidelity objected at the summary judgment motion hearing to Masonâ€™s affidavit on the grounds that it did not establish Mason as an expert, was not timely, was not notarized, and contained legal conclusions. Although the record includes discussions during the motion hearing concerning Masonâ€™s affidavit and Cowburnâ€™s assertions that it should be considered, the trial court never indicated whether it would consider it.Â  In addition, the trial court did not specifically address Masonâ€™s affidavit in its written order granting summary judgment.Â  We find the trial court did not rule upon this issue, and thus, whether or not the court erred in failing to consider the affidavit is not preserved for appeal.Â  See id. Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breach of Fiduciary Duty \r\n\r\nCowburn argues a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Fidelity owed him a fiduciary duty and whether Fidelity breached that duty.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs stated previously: â€œA fiduciary relationship exists when one reposes special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.â€\r\nOâ€™Shea, 308 S.C. at 15, 416 S.E.2d at 631 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nThe term fiduciary implies that one party is in a superior position to the other and that such a position enables him to exercise influence over one who reposes special trust and confidence in him. As a general rule, mere respect for another's judgment or trust in his character is usually not sufficient to establish such a relationship. The facts and circumstances must indicate that the one reposing the trust has foundation for his belief that the one giving advice or presenting arguments is acting not in his own behalf, but in the interests of the other party.\r\n\r\nBurwell v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank,&nbsp; 288 S.C. 34, 41, 340 S.E.2d 786, 790&nbsp;(1986) (citations omitted).\r\nGenerally, a bank-depositor relationship establishes a creditor-debtor relationship rather than a fiduciary relationship.Â \r\nRush v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 560, 562, 343 S.E.2d 667, 668 (Ct. App. 1986).Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn limited circumstances, however, a fiduciary relationship may be created between a bank and a customer if the bank undertakes to advise the customer as a part of the services the bank offers.Â  Unless the funds are deposited into a special account or specifically designated to be kept separate, the relationship between a general depositor and the bank is that of creditor and debtor, and a trust is not created.\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, we find no evidence Fidelity undertook to advise Cowburn about his investments.Â  To the contrary, Fidelityâ€™s custodial agreement provides as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n11.1 Hold Harmless.Â  You agree to hold us harmless, to indemnify, and to defend us against any and all claims arising from and liabilities incurred by reason of any action taken by us in good faith pursuant to this agreement. \r\n11.2 No Investment Discretion.Â  You agree that all contributions shall be invested according to your sole discretion.Â  All investments in the IRA shall be in one or more of the following:Â  (1) term investments of the Custodian; (2) Marketable securities (excluding securities issued by Custodian or any of its affiliates acquired through a current underwriting); and any other category or investment acceptable to the Custodian.Â  We shall not be responsible or liable for any investment decisions or recommendations with respect to the investment, reinvestment, or sale of assets in the custodial account.Â  We shall not be responsible for reviewing any assets held in the custodial account and shall not be responsible for questioning any of your investment decisions. Â We shall not be responsible for any loss resulting from any failure to act because of the absence of direction from you.\r\n. . . .\r\n11.3 Transaction Responsibility.Â  We are not responsible for inquiring into the nature or amount of any contribution made by you, nor into the amount or timing of any distribution requested.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  This language in the custodial agreement specifically limits Fidelityâ€™s duties and emphasizes that Fidelity does not advise SDIRA customers on their investment decisions.Â  Fidelityâ€™s counsel questioned Cowburn in his deposition about these provisions in the custodial agreement, and Cowburn indicated he understood them.Â  Cowburn also stated he understood the contract limited Fidelityâ€™s duties, and that Fidelity was not responsible for reviewing his investments.Â  Cowburn also testified he had invested in SDIRAs in the past.Â  He stated he understood Fidelityâ€™s role to be that of a custodian, and that it was not Fidelityâ€™s role to provide him with investment advice.Â  Cowburn confirmed he alone was responsible for his investment decisions.Â  \r\nCowburn acknowledged Fidelity did not make any affirmative representations regarding whether he should make an investment and did not give him financial advice.Â  However, Cowburn asserts a single statement made by a Fidelity employee, Loree Adams, amounted to Fidelity undertaking to advise him.Â  Cowburn states this was the only statement made by a Fidelity employee that he considered a recommendation.Â  In regard to his conversation with Adams about the Program, Cowburn testified:Â  \r\n\r\nI asked her for her opinion on this - - this investment.\r\n. . . .\r\nShe said, â€œWell,â€ - - words to this effect, â€˜cause, you know, itâ€™s been three years ago; words to the effect, â€œIâ€™ve been here two years, and these guys have never missed a payment, and theyâ€™re always on time, and it seems good to me.â€Â  \r\n\r\nWe find this statement does not amount to Fidelity undertaking to advise Cowburn as to his investments.Â  The first part of the statement concerns only the timeliness of interest payments made by the Program. It does not offer any advice to Cowburn regarding the quality of his investment.Â  In addition, the statement, â€œit seems good to me,â€ does not amount to rendering advice such that Cowburn would rely on its authenticity for purposes of imposing a fiduciary duty on a bank.Â  See Burwell,&nbsp; 288 S.C. at 41, 340 S.E.2d at 790&nbsp;(stating that mere respect for anotherâ€™s judgment or trust in her character is usually not sufficient to establish a fiduciary relationship).Â  Neither has Cowburn presented any evidence that Adams knew he was placing her in a position of special trust. Regions Bank v. Schmauch,&nbsp; 354 S.C. 648, 671, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (â€œ[N]o fiduciary relationship between a bank and its depositor exists when the bank is unaware of any special trust reposed in it.â€).\r\nCowburn also argues section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code (West 2005) equates IRAs to trusts, thereby making Fidelity a trustee and imposing fiduciary duties on Fidelity.Â  We disagree with Cowburnâ€™s interpretation of this section.Â  \r\nSection 408 provides as follows: \r\n\r\n(a) Individual retirement account.--For purposes of this section, the term â€œindividual retirement accountâ€ means a trust created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries, but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:\r\n  . . . .\r\n(h) Custodial accounts.--For purposes of this section, a custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such account are held by a bank (as defined in subsection (n)) or another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a trust, constitute an individual retirement account described in subsection (a). For purposes of this title, in the case of a custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the trustee thereof.\r\n\r\n(emphais added).Â  Treasury Regulation 1.408-2 (West 2005) clarifies section 408 as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) In general. An individual retirement account must be a trust or a custodial account (see paragraph (d) of this section).\r\n. . . .\r\n(b) Requirements. An individual retirement account must be a trust created or organized in the United States (as defined in section 7701(a)(9)) for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries.Â  Such trust must be maintained at all times as a domestic trust in the United States.Â  The instrument creating the trust must be in writing and the following requirements must be satisfied.\r\nÂ . . . .\r\n(d) Custodial accounts.Â  For purposes of this section and section 408(a), a custodial account is treated as a trust described in section 408(a) if such account satisfies the requirements of section 408(a) except that it is not a trust and if the assets of such account are held by a bank (as defined in section 401(d)(1) and the regulations thereunder) or such other person who satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.Â  For purposes of this chapter, in the case of a custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding sentence, the custodian of such account will be treated as the trustee thereof.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nOur review of the plain language of the statute and the associated regulations persuades us to find that an IRA or custodial account is not a trust per se, but is treated as a trust for purposes of this particular provision of the Internal Revenue Code.Â  In addition, we do not find section 408 imposes particular fiduciary duties on a custodian of an IRA.Â  Therefore, we disagree with Cowburn that section 408 imposes fiduciary duties upon Fidelity sufficient to establish a breach of fiduciary duty claim.Â  \r\nBecause we do not find evidence that Fidelity owed Cowburn a fiduciary duty under any of the theories asserted by Cowburn, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue.Â  \r\n\r\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligence \r\n\r\nCowburn asserts a genuine issue of material fact exists to establish his claim of negligence against Fidelity.Â  He contends Fidelityâ€™s negligence arose out of the violation of its own polices and the terms of the custodial agreement.Â Â Â  \r\nIn order to establish a claim for negligence, Cowburn must present evidence of a legal duty owed by Fidelity, a breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission, and damages that were proximately caused by that breach.Â \r\nAndrade v. Johnson, 356 S.C. 238, 245, 588 S.E.2d 588, 592 (2003).Â  â€œThe Court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.Â  An affirmative legal duty to act exists only if created by statute, contract, relationship, status, property interest, or some other special circumstance.â€Â \r\nCharleston Dry  Cleaners &amp; Laundry, Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co.,\r\n355 S.C. 614, 618, 586 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2003) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nFirst, Cowburn argues Fidelity breached its duties pursuant to the custodial agreement because Fidelity did not require him to purchase assets through its brokerage arm.Â  We disagree with Cowburnâ€™s interpretation of this provision.Â  \r\nThe provision referred to by Cowburn states:Â  â€œUnless you give specific instructions to the contrary, we shall effect securities purchases or sales, when possible, through our affiliate, Fidelity National Capital Investors, Inc. at the brokerage commission rate charged for similar accounts.â€ (emphasis added).\r\nWe find this provision does not impose a mandatory duty on Fidelity, but rather allows Fidelity to purchase securities through its brokerage arm, â€œwhen possible.â€Â  In addition, Cowburn fails to argue how this alleged violation of the custodial agreement proximately caused his injury.Â  Therefore, we find no factual issue exists with regard to this argument.Â  \r\nSecond, Cowburn asserts Fidelity breached its duty to Cowburn by failing to keep adequate and complete records in accordance with Fidelityâ€™s internal policies and to annually determine the fair market value of his investments in accordance with its own internal policies and the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.Â  Further, Cowburn maintains if Fidelity had complied with its policies, and with section 408(i) of the Internal Revenue Code (West 2005), it would have discovered the Program was a Ponzi scheme.Â  \r\nFidelityâ€™s internal policy states regulations require custodians of SDIRAs to report the fair market value of the IRA to the IRS and the IRA holder annually.Â  The internal policy also provides if the IRA contains investments other than publicly traded securities, â€œthe bank must ascertain that they are legitimate methods for determining the FMV [fair market value] available.â€Â  Section 408(i) of the Internal Revenue Code provides:Â  \r\n\r\n(i) Reports.--The trustee of an individual retirement account and the issuer of an endowment contract described in subsection (b) or an individual retirement annuity shall make such reports regarding such account, contract, or annuity to the Secretary and to the individuals for whom the account, contract, or annuity is, or is to be, maintained with respect to contributions (and the years to which they relate), distributions aggregating $10 or more in any calendar year, and such other matters as the Secretary may require. The reports required by this subsection--\r\n(1) shall be filed at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes, and\r\n(2) shall be furnished to individuals--\r\n  \r\n(A) not later than January 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year to which such reports relate, and\r\n(B) in such manner as the Secretary prescribes.\r\n  \r\n\r\nInitially, Cowburn fails to argue what records were not kept by Fidelity, resulting in the breach of its duty to Cowburn.Â  Next, the record on appeal includes semi-annual statements issued by Fidelity to Cowburn for the years in which he invested in the Program.Â  These statements indicate the market value of his investments at the end of each reporting period as well as contributions and distributions made during the year.Â  Therefore, these statements comply with Fidelityâ€™s internal policies and section 408(i).Â  In addition, the custodial agreement states: \r\n\r\nArticle XIII.Â  Reports and Records.Â  We shall keep accurate and detailed records of all contributions, receipts, investments, distributions, disbursements, and other transactions relating to the custodial account.Â  We shall provide reports to the IRS and to you as required by law and regulations.Â  Unless you file a written statement with us within 60 days after you receive a statement, we shall be relieved and discharged from all liability to you (including your beneficiaries) with respect to all matters set forth in such report.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The record does not contain any indication that Cowburn alerted Fidelity to any discrepancies on the statements provided.Â  Finally, Cowburn fails to assert how Fidelity breached its duty under its internal policies and section 408(i).Â  Therefore, we find no factual dispute to be determined on this issue.Â  \r\nThird, Cowburn argues Fidelity had a legal duty to comply with the provisions of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.Â  He asserts Fidelity breached this duty by allowing Cowburn to invest in non-qualified investments.Â Â Â  \r\nSection 408 does not contain a provision stating investments must be â€œqualified.â€Â  However, section 408(a) sets forth requirements for IRAs.Â  These requirements must be met in order for a taxpayer to benefit from the tax advantages of IRAs.Â  One of these requirements prohibits investments in life insurance contracts, thereby limiting the type of investments available to a taxpayer.Â  I.R.C. Â§ 408(a)(3).Â  Therefore, contrary to Cowburnâ€™s assertion, â€œqualifiedâ€ does not mean Fidelity has an obligation to investigate the quality of the investments selected by Cowburn.Â  Rather, Fidelity must ensure the Code does not specifically prohibit a type of investment.Â  Because Cowburn failed to establish a duty pursuant to section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, we find no genuine issue of material fact.\r\nFourth, Cowburn asserts Fidelity had a duty under the Anunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act to report to him any of his funds sent to offshore banks.Â  Other than a vague reference to the name of the Act, Cowburn cites no authority to support this assertion.Â  Thus, we deem it abandoned on appeal. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (deeming an issue abandoned because the appellant failed to provide pertinent argument or supporting authority).\r\nFifth, Cowburn asserts Fidelity employees undertook a duty to advise him as to the quality of his investment, and therefore, owed him a duty of care in giving such advice.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs previously discussed, in the custodial agreement Fidelity specifically limited its duty to advise Cowburn on his investments.Â  We find no evidence in the record indicating any employees undertook the duty to advise Cowburn, nor any evidence of breach or causation.Â  Because we find no genuine issue of material fact exists concerning Fidelityâ€™s purported negligence, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. \r\n\r\ne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil Conspiracy against Fidelity and Leventis \r\n\r\nCowburn argues Fidelity provided Leventis with the means of opening SDIRAs for victims of the Ponzi scheme, and the opening of those SDIRAs was essential to the scheme.Â  Therefore, he alleges Fidelity and Leventis acted in a civil conspiracy, which contributed to Cowburnâ€™s injury.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is well-settled in South Carolina that the tort of civil conspiracy contains three elements: (1) a combination of two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff; (3) causing plaintiff special damage.â€Â \r\nKuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 610, 538 S.E.2d 15, 31 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œIn order to establish a conspiracy, evidence, either direct or circumstantial, must be produced from which a party may reasonably infer the joint assent of the minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the unlawful enterprise.â€Â \r\nFirst Union Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 575, 511 S.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nThe record does not contain any evidence that Fidelity and Leventis had an agreement, or that they joined together for the purpose of injuring Cowburn.Â  Therefore, we find no genuine issue of material fact exists to establish a claim for civil conspiracy.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Cowburnâ€™s argument that the trial court improperly disregarded his expertâ€™s affidavit is not preserved for our review.Â  Furthermore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment as to Fidelity on all Cowburnâ€™s causes of action.Â  As to Cowburnâ€™s causes of action against Leventis, we find a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding his private cause of action for violations of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-410 and -810 (Supp. 2003) and reverse the grant of summary judgment on those causes of action.Â  As to Cowburnâ€™s remaining causes of action, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) defines a Ponzi scheme as â€œ[a] fraudulent investment scheme in which money contributed by later investors generates artificially high dividends for the original investors, whose example attracts even larger investments.â€\r\n[2]  Section 35-1-1490 states that any person buying a security from someone acting in violation of sections 35-1-410 or -810 may â€œrecover the consideration paid for the security, together with interest at six percent per year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.Â  Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it and interest at six percent per year from the date of disposition.â€Â  \r\n[3] Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th 2004) defines â€œcommercial paperâ€ to include â€œa short-term unsecured promissory note, usu. issued and sold by one company to meet another companyâ€™s immediate cash needs.â€\r\n[4]  Leventis also argues that he was exempt from registration because as president of Priority Advisors, Inc., a company operating as director of Southwestern Holdings, he was not required to register by virtue of Southwesternâ€™s â€œRegulation Dâ€ filing, which exempts the company from registering its securities.Â  See 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 230.501 to 230.508 (2004).Â  This issue was not argued to the trial court in Leventisâ€™s motion for summary judgment or at the hearing on the motion.Â  \r\nThis court may review additional sustaining grounds raised by a respondent, and â€œif convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reasonâ€ raised on appeal and appearing in the record to affirm the lower courtâ€™s judgment.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,&nbsp;338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723&nbsp;(2000).Â Â  In this case, we decline to review this potential additional sustaining ground because we are not convinced it is proper and fair to do so.Â  This particular issue implicates complex state and federal securities law, which were summarily addressed by Leventis in his brief on appeal.Â  See also Gordon, 358 S.C. at 606, 595 S.E.2d at 868;\r\nCantrell,  302 S.C. at 559, 397 S.E.2d at 778.\r\n[5]Although Cowburn asserted a cause of action for legal negligence/malpractice, that issue was abandoned at the hearing on summary judgment.Â  \r\n[6] The affidavit does not contain any allegations concerning the duties owed by Leventis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3991","title":"SC Department of Motor Vehicles v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3991\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2005 â€“ Filed May 23, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPatrick M. Teague, and Frank L. Valenta, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nDanny Joe Nelson, of Fountain Inn, Pro Se Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:  Danny Joe Nelson was arrested for driving under the influence.Â  Nelson refused to consent to a breath test offered nearly five hours after his arrest.Â  As a result, the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (the Department), formerly the Department of Public Safety, suspended Nelsonâ€™s driverâ€™s license.Â  The circuit court reversed, finding the Department failed to videotape Nelsonâ€™s breath test within three hours of arrest as required by law.Â  The Department appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse.[1]  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 10, 2002, Deputy Jason Wilson of the Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s Department was on routine patrol in Duncan, South Carolina.Â  He observed a vehicle driving erratically and crossing back and forth over the center line.Â  The car, which Nelson was driving, turned left onto Berry Shoals Road and attempted to make a U-turn.Â  Deputy Wilson stopped the vehicle.Â  He found that Nelsonâ€™s speech was slurred and he smelled of alcohol.Â  Nelson admitted he had been drinking.Â  Deputy Wilson asked Nelson to get out of the car, and he conducted several field sobriety tests, which Nelson failed.Â  \r\nNelson was placed under arrest at 8:36 p.m. for driving under the influence.Â  Deputy Wilson read Nelson his Miranda rights and his section 56-5-2934 advisement and placed him in the patrol car.Â  Officer Piggins arrived at the scene at that time.Â  Nelson began complaining of asthma and asked for his inhaler.Â  Deputy Wilson was unable to locate an inhaler in Nelsonâ€™s car, but he did find an open bottle of vodka and four other open bottles of liquor.Â  An ambulance was called to the scene; the emergency medical technician checked Nelson and reported that he was fine.Â  \r\nDeputy Wilson took Nelson to the Detention Center, but had to leave him with Officer Piggins because Wilsonâ€™s house was on fire.Â  While Deputy Wilson was gone, Nelson again complained of asthma and asked to be taken to the hospital.Â  Officer Piggins complied with Nelsonâ€™s request.Â  \r\nWhen they returned to the Detention Center, Nelson was offered a DataMaster test.Â  Officer K.D. Green advised Nelson of his implied consent rights both orally and in writing and told Nelson that the testing was being videotaped.Â  The machine was working properly, and Officer Green followed procedure in preparing to administer the test.Â  At 1:20 a.m., Nelson refused to give a sample.Â  \r\nDeputy Wilson returned to the Detention Center and found Nelson again complaining of asthma and requesting a blood test.Â  Deputy Wilson transported Nelson to the hospital a second time, but the hospital refused to conduct a blood test because Nelson did not have cash to pay for it.Â  \r\nThe Department suspended Nelsonâ€™s driverâ€™s license.Â  Nelson requested an administrative hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. section 56-5-2951(B) (Supp. 2002).Â  The hearing officer upheld the suspension in accordance with S.C. Code Ann. section 56-5-2951 (Supp. 2002) for failure to consent to drug and alcohol testing.Â  The circuit court reversed, concluding the breath test was not offered within three hours of arrest as required by section 56-5-2953 (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. sections 1-23-310 to â€“400 (2005), establishes the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ rule as the standard for judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306-07 (1981).Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n  The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:\r\n\r\n  (a)Â Â Â Â  in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n(b)Â Â Â Â  in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n(c)Â Â Â Â  made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n(d)Â Â Â Â  affected by other error of law;\r\n(e)Â Â Â Â  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n(f)Â Â Â Â Â  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. \r\n\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œA court may not substitute its judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the agencyâ€™s findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Summersell v. South Carolina Dept. of Public Safety,&nbsp;334 S.C. 357, 363, 513 S.E.2d 619, 622 (Ct. App. 1999), vacated in part on other grounds, 337 S.C. 19, 522 S.E.2d 144 (1999); accord Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 289, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994); Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1991); see also Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. South Carolina Public Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984) (declaring that substantial evidence is something less than weight of evidence and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence).Â  In reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit court essentially sits as an appellate court to review alleged errors committed by the agency. Kiawah Resort Assocs. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 505, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995); see also Byerly Hosp. v. South Carolina State Health and Human Servs. Finance Commâ€™n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 385-86 (1995) (holding that a decision of an administrative agency must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence, and a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency on questions of fact). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Implied Consent Statute\r\nThe issue in this case is whether the failure to comply with the videotaping requirements of section 56-5-2953 precludes the Department from suspending Nelsonâ€™s license for his refusal to submit to a breath test under section 56-5-2950.Â  \r\nâ€œPursuant to Â§ 56-5-2950, a person driving a motor vehicle in South Carolina is deemed to have consented to a chemical test of his breath, blood, or urine if arrested for an offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two.â€Â  State v. Long, Op. No. 25955 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 21, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13, 68 at 70).Â  South Carolina Code Annotated section 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2002)[2] provides:\r\n\r\n(a)Â Â Â Â  A person who drives a motor vehicle in this State is considered to have given consent to chemical tests of his breath, blood, or urine for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol or drugs or the combination of alcohol and drugs if arrested for an offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both of them.Â  A breath test must be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer who has arrested a person for driving a motor vehicle in this State while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of them.Â  At the direction of the arresting officer, the person first must be offered a breath test to determine the personâ€™s alcohol concentration.Â  If the person is physically unable to provide an acceptable breath sample because he has an injured mouth or is unconscious or dead, or for any other reason considered acceptable by the licensed medical personnel, the arresting officer may request a blood sample to be taken.Â  If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of drugs other than alcohol, the officer may order that a urine sample be taken for testing.Â  If the alcohol concentration is ten one-hundredths of one percent or above, the officer may not require additional tests of the person as provided in this chapter.Â  The breath test must be administered by a person trained and certified by the department, pursuant to SLED policies.Â  The arresting officer may administer the tests if the personâ€™s conduct during the twenty-minute pre-test waiting period is videotaped pursuant to Section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d).Â  Before the breath test is administered, a ten one-hundredths of one percent simulator test must be performed and the result must reflect a reading between 0.095 percent and 0.105 percent.Â  Blood and urine samples must be obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners, registered nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, and other medical personnel trained to obtain the samples in a licensed medical facility.Â  Blood and urine samples must be obtained and handled in accordance with procedures approved by SLED.Â  \r\nNo test may be administered or samples obtained unless the person has been informed in writing that:\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  he does not have to take the test or give the samples but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least ninety days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal may be used against him in court; \r\n(2) his privilege to drive must be suspended for at least thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nSection 56-5-2951, S.C. Code Ann. (Supp. 2002), reads:\r\n\r\n(A)Â Â Â  The Department of Public Safety shall suspend the driverâ€™s license, permit, or nonresident operating privilege of or deny the issuance of a license or permit to a person who drives a motor vehicle and refuses to submit to a test provided for in Section 56-5-2950 or has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more.Â  The arresting officer shall issue a notice of suspension which is effective beginning on the date of the alleged violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nBoth section 56-5-2950 and â€“2951 use unqualified, mandatory language.Â  An operator of a motor vehicle in South Carolina is not required to submit to alcohol or drug testing; however, our legislature has clearly mandated that should one choose not to consent to such testing, his or her license must and shall be suspended for at least ninety days.Â  \r\nThe implied consent laws are driven by public policy considerations.Â  The State has a strong interest in maintaining safe highways and roads.Â  One way to accomplish this goal is to enact laws directed at minimizing drunk driving.Â  By providing for implied consent testing, our legislature struck a balance, allowing law enforcement to test and prosecute suspected drunk drivers while protecting individuals from such tests, should they choose to refuse them.Â  As stated by this Court in Sponar v. South Carolina Department of Public Safety, 361 S.C. 35, 603 S.E.2d 412 (Ct. App. 2004):\r\n\r\nThe license to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state is not a property right, but is a mere privilege subject to reasonable regulations under the police power in the interest of the public safety and welfare.Â  Such privilege is always subject to revocation or suspension for any cause relating to public safety.\r\n\r\nId.  at 39, 603 S.E.2d at 415; accord State v. Collins, 253 S.C. 358, 361, 170 S.E.2d 667, 668 (1969); South Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t v. Harbin, 226 S.C. 585, 595, 86 S.E.2d 466, 470 (1955). Â Were drivers free to refuse alcohol and drug testing without suffering penalty, the current system of detecting, testing, and prosecuting drunk drivers would simply fail.Â  Consequently, the legislature imposed a minimum ninety-day suspension for refusal to consent to testing where the driver has no prior DUI-related convictions.Â  This ninety-day suspension is substantially more severe than the thirty-day suspension imposed upon a person who takes a test and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more with no prior convictions.Â  Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(K)(1)(a) (Supp. 2002) with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(K)(1)(b) (Supp. 2002).Â  The disparity in suspensions demonstrates the legislative concern over an individualâ€™s refusal to consent to testing.Â  \r\nThe requirements for suspension for refusal to consent are: (1) a person (2) operating a motor vehicle (3) in South Carolina (4) be arrested for an offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both, and (5) refuse to submit to alcohol and drug testing.Â  See S.C. Code Â§Â§ 56-5-2950 and â€“2951 (Supp. 2002).Â  Those statutory predicates are present here.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s reversal of Nelsonâ€™s suspension was erroneous.Â  \r\nThe circuit court correctly noted the Department did not comply with section 56-5-2953.Â  That section provides:\r\n\r\n(A)Â Â Â  A person who violates Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 shall have his conduct at the incident site and the breath test site videotaped.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. . . . \r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  The videotaping at the breath site:\r\n  \r\n(a)Â Â Â Â  must be completed within three hours of the personâ€™s arrest for a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 or a probable cause determination that the person violated Section 56-5-2945, unless compliance is not possible because the person needs emergency medical treatment considered necessary by licensed medical personnel;\r\n  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. . . .\r\n(B)Â Â Â  Nothing in this section may be construed as prohibiting the introduction of other evidence in the trial of a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945.Â  Failure by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal of any charge made pursuant to Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that the videotape equipment at the time of the arrest, probable cause determination, or breath test device was in an inoperable condition, stating reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the equipment in an operable condition, and certifying that there was no other operable breath test facility available in the county or, in the alternative, submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to produce the videotape because the person needed emergency medical treatment, or exigent circumstances existed. . . . Nothing in this section prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances, nor do the provisions of this section prohibit the person from offering evidence relating to the arresting law enforcement officerâ€™s failure to produce the videotape.Â  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953 (Supp. 2002).\r\nThe Department concedes it did not comply with the requirements of section 56-5-2953.Â  The breath test was not conducted within three hours of Nelsonâ€™s arrest.Â  Moreover, the arresting officer did not submit a sworn affidavit stating that the videotape equipment was inoperable, or that it was physically impossible to produce the videotape because of the need for medical treatment or other exigent circumstances.Â  However, nothing in the code instructs that a failure to comply with section 56-5-2953 warrants the dismissal of prosecution for failure to submit to testing pursuant to section 56-5-2950.Â  \r\nHad Nelson consented to the breath test, the efficacy of a conviction for violation of section 56-5-2930 or 56-5-2933 would have been called into question.Â  Although the test was offered after the required three hours and no affidavit was offered, the hearing officer might still have considered the totality of the circumstances and found valid reasons for the Departmentâ€™s failure to comply with the statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (Supp. 2002) (â€œNothing in this section prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances[.]â€).Â  In the instant case, the hearing officer may have found that Nelson himself created the dilemma by repeatedly requesting treatmentâ€”especially because medical personnel apparently found Nelson did not need assistance.Â  However, as Nelson withheld his consent under section 56-5-2950, the Departmentâ€™s noncompliance under section 56-5-2953 has no application to this case. \r\nII. Scope of the Administrative Hearing\r\nThe Department argues the circuit court erred by failing to adhere to the scope of the implied consent hearing as dictated by section 56-5-2951.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe implied consent statute provides that a person must be informed in writing that â€œhe has the right to request an administrative hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension[.]â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a)(4) (Supp. 2002).Â  This hearing is limited in its scope.Â  Pursuant to the 2002 version of section 56-5-2951(H), the scope of the hearing must be limited to whether the person:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was lawfully arrested or detained;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was advised in writing of the rights enumerated in Section 56-5-2950;\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refused to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; or\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consented to taking the test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, and the:\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  reported alcohol concentration at the time of testing was fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  individual who administered the test or took samples was qualified pursuant to Section 56-5-2950;\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  tests administered and samples obtained were conducted pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; and\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the machine was working properly.Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(H) (Supp. 2002).Â  This limitation has been explained as follows:\r\n\r\n[T]he question before the hearing officer was not whether the state had proved its case, but whether the arresting officer had probable cause to believe [the driver] had committed the offense of driving under the influence.Â  This is not a trial in regard to the guilt or innocence of the defendant on a DUI charge.Â  Rather, the gravamen of the administrative hearing is a determination of the efficacy and applicability of the implied consent law. The query posited to the administrative hearing officer is: did the person violate the implied consent law. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Summersell v. Dept. of Public Safety, 334 S.C. 357, 368-369, 513 S.E.2d 619, 625&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999), vacated in part on other ground, 337 S.C. 19, 522 S.E.2d 177 (1999).\r\nBecause Nelson did not consent to testing, the scope of the hearing was limited to whether Nelson (1) was lawfully arrested, (2) was advised in writing of his section 56-5-2950 rights, and (3) refused to submit to a test.Â  The hearing officer determined that Nelson had been lawfully arrested, had been advised of his rights, and had refused to submit to the test offered in accordance with section 56-5-2950.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s reversal of the hearing officer was outside the purview of the proper scope of review.Â  Accordingly, we find the only relevant issues at the administrative hearing were not in dispute.Â  The circuit court erred in considering the violation of the three-hour videotaping requirement.Â  We reverse the order of the circuit court and reinstate the suspension. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the circuit court is hereby \r\n REVERSED.\r\n STILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n[2]  Act No. 61, 2003 S.C.

Richardson, of Columbia; and John Witherspoon and James A. Bell, both of St. George, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In this child support action, Keith Britt appeals a family court order awarding Jane Patrick an increase in child support and attorney&rsquo;s fees. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n Keith Britt and Jane Patrick were divorced by order of the Dorchester County Family Court on April 16, 1991. Patrick was awarded custody of the couple&rsquo;s two children. The divorce decree ordered Britt to pay child support in the amount of $450 a month and contained a provision which stipulated that the child support would continue until the oldest child reached eighteen years of age. Upon that child&rsquo;s emancipation, the payments would be reduced to $225 a month. \r\n Approximately three months after the oldest child turned eighteen in June 2002, Patrick commenced the current action seeking an increase in child support to better provide for the parties&rsquo; youngest child. The parties submitted financial declarations and a final hearing was held on June 4, 2003. \r\n The primary dispute at the hearing concerned the amount of income attributable to Britt. Britt is the owner and operator of Keith Britt Trucking and Construction, an incorporated business that he began in 1995. Although Britt&rsquo;s business took in over $430,000 in 2002, Britt submitted on his financial declaration that he personally received only $66.01 a month. Britt attributed his low income to high overhead costs of running the business, including the purchase and maintenance of heavy machinery. He further testified that he took out several loans to provide the company with operating capital. \r\n Britt also testified, however, that numerous personal expenses were paid by his business. For example, and this is by no means an exhaustive list of personal expenses, previous child support payments were paid through the business, as were church tithes, private school tuition for a step child, payments for the truck he used, gas, work clothes, and telephone bills. Britt&rsquo;s current wife also worked for the business and received a salary, which Britt testified she used to pay certain household expenses.1 \r\n Although Britt submitted monthly disbursement summaries outlining the business&rsquo; expenses for 2002, he was unable to tell exactly how much company money was used to pay personal expenses. Britt&rsquo;s accountant was also unable to provide an exact figure in this regard. Although the accountant was in the process of trying to complete the company&rsquo;s 2002 tax returns, he was unable to complete them before trial. Nevertheless, as of the date of trial, the accountant identified at least $17,000 of company money spent on Britt&rsquo;s personal expenses. \r\n The accountant also testified concerning tax deductions the company received for depreciation on business equipment such as bulldozers and trucks. The accountant testified the company spent approximately $100,000 a year on such equipment and that it was able to take depreciation of an equal amount. \r\n Upon conclusion of the hearing, the court took the matter under advisement. On June 20, 2003, the court issued an order finding that Britt &ldquo;purposefully arranged his finances in a manner that would make it difficult to determine his actual income.&rdquo; It then held that the only reasonable measure of Britt&rsquo;s income was the $100,000 of depreciation that the accountant testified Britt would have for 2002. Accordingly, the family court determined Patrick was entitled to an increase in child support and calculated Britt&rsquo;s obligation based on that income. The order compels Britt to pay child support in the amount of $987.00 a month, and requires payment retroactively to the date Patrick filed the complaint. \r\n In addition to the child support award, the family court ordered Britt to pay Patrick&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s fees of $4,375 based in part on its finding that Britt deliberately misrepresented his income and thus caused the litigation to be unnecessarily complicated and expensive. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992). This broad scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard the factual findings of the family court. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981). Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Child Support and Income Determination \r\n Britt first asserts the family court abused its discretion in increasing his child support obligation by imputing income to him based on taxable depreciation of equipment used in his business. We disagree.\r\n    \r\n    Child support awards are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and, absent an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984). Income for determining child support awards is defined in the Child Support Guidelines as &ldquo;the actual gross income of the parent, if employed to full capacity, or potential income if unemployed or underemployed.&rdquo; 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(1) (Supp. 2004). The Guidelines specifically address how to determine income from someone who is self employed:\r\n\r\n  For income from self-employment . . . gross income is defined as gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required for self-employment or business operation . . . . However, the court should exclude from those expenses amounts allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for accelerated depreciation or investment tax credits for the purposes of the guidelines and add those amounts back in to determine gross income. In general, the court should carefully review income and expenses from self-employment . . . to determine actual levels of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child support obligation. As may be apparent, this amount may differ from a determination of business income for tax purposes. \r\n\r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(4) (Supp. 2004).\r\n In the current case, Britt testified that although his business brought in over $430,000 in gross income, he personally made a mere $66.01 a month. He admitted, however, that the company paid a plethora of personal expenses, including his step-child&rsquo;s private school tuition, church tithes, child support payments, and various other expenses. \r\n Although Britt&rsquo;s accountant had not completed his analysis, as of the date of trial he identified over $17,000 worth of personal expenses paid by the company. The accountant further testified that the company spent approximately $100,000 on equipment and was able to take a tax depreciation that essentially made these expenses &ldquo;a wash.&rdquo; Based on this evidence, the applicable law, and the fact that Britt refused to assist the court in resolving the issue, we find no abuse of discretion by the family court in its determination of income and subsequent calculation of child support. See Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 364, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1995) (affirming family court&rsquo;s imputation of income based partially on husband&rsquo;s refusal to make an effort to show his earning potential). \r\n We find this holding to be especially appropriate considering Britt&rsquo;s stubborn refusal to provide any assistance whatsoever to the family court in resolving the issue of his income. Thus, having failed to provide the court with any meaningful representation of his actual income, and failing to respond to the court&rsquo;s requests for direction with anything other than patronizing remarks, we find Britt would be hard pressed to complain of the family court&rsquo;s ruling. See Rish v. Rish by and Through Barry, 296 S.C. 14, 17, 370 S.E.2d 102, 104 (Ct. App. 1988) (Bell, J., concurring) (stating that the court of appeals does not sit to relieve self-inflicted wounds); Gore v. Gore, 288 S.C. 438, 440-41, 343 S.E.2d 51, 52 (Ct. App. 1986) (denying relief when husband&rsquo;s conduct was to blame for the predicament in which he found himself). \r\nII. Attorney&rsquo;s Fees\r\n    \r\n  Britt next asserts the trial court erred in awarding Patrick $4,375 in attorney&rsquo;s fees. We disagree.\r\n&ldquo;An award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.&rdquo; Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989). In order to award attorney&rsquo;s fees a court should consider several factors including: (1) ability of the party to pay the fees; (2) beneficial results obtained; (3) financial conditions of the parties; and (4) effect a fee award will have on the party&rsquo;s standard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992); see also Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\n In its order, the family court concluded, &ldquo;[Britt&rsquo;s] deliberate misrepresentation of his income has caused this litigation to be complicated and expensive and [Patrick] is entitled to payment of her attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs.&rdquo; A review of the record supports this determination. In addition, in light of the family court&rsquo;s calculation of Britt&rsquo;s income at $100,000 per year, we do not find the award would unduly impact his financial condition. Considering this along with the fact that Patrick&rsquo;s attorney obtained beneficial results by obtaining an increase in child support, we find the award to have been well within the discretion of the family court judge. \r\n AFFIRMED2\r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n[1] When asked by the court how much money his current wife made in salary, Britt claimed to not know because &ldquo;[s]he does all the paying of the bills.&rdquo; Because of the difficulty in computing Britt&rsquo;s actual income, the court also asked Britt what amount of income he thought the court should use to determine child support. Britt offered no suggestions other than &ldquo;I will leave that up to you.&rdquo; \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3993","title":"In the Matter of: Estate fo Niles Stevens","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3993","description":"In this appeal from a declaratory judgment action involving a sizable trust, the court analyzes the boundaries of trustee discretion, particularly what considerations are appropriate when determining proper distributions for a benificiary's \"support.\"","date":"2005-05-23","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nIn Re: The Estate of Niles Stevens\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.SpellE\r\n\t{}\r\n.GramE\r\n\t{}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIN THE MATTER OF: ESTATE OF NILES STEVENS J.

Ohanesian, James F. McCrackin, Dominic A. Starr, J. Christopher Clark, and Mary Anna Neill, all of Myrtle Beach, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n WILLIAMS, J.:Â  Paul Stevens, II, appeals a master-in-equityâ€™s decision, which declared that the trustees of the Niles Stevens Trust, of which Paul is a named beneficiary, were barred under the trustâ€™s terms from making certain discretionary payments.Â  Specifically, the master held the trustees were prohibited from considering the educational needs of Paulâ€™s children when determining what constitutes a proper payment under the trust for Paulâ€™s â€œsupport.â€Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nNiles Stevens died on February 24, 1984, leaving a will that established the testamentary trust in question.Â  The trust contains the following language pertinent to this appeal:\r\n\r\n[M]y trustee may pay to or apply for the benefit of my said children, LAURA STEVENS and PAUL STEVENS, such sums from the principal or accumulated income of this trust as in his sole discretion shall be necessary or advisable from time to time for the health, education, support and maintenance of my said children, LAURA STEVENS and PAUL STEVENS, taking into consideration to the extent my trustee deems advisable any other income or resources of my said children . . . known to my trustee.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the litigation, the trust had an approximate value of six million dollars.\r\nLaura Stevens Lutch and Paul Stevens are presently the trustâ€™s only named beneficiaries.Â  Upon the death of either, the trust directs that the decedentâ€™s one-half interest shall be distributed to the issue of the deceased beneficiary.Â  Should either die leaving no issue, the trust would remain intact for the benefit of the survivor and ultimately distributed to the issue of the surviving beneficiary.Â  Paul presently has two minor children, Sunni and Grace Stevens.Â  Laura has no children at this time.\r\nPaul requested that the trustees exercise their discretionary authority by distributing trust funds for the purpose of funding the private school education of his two children, remainder beneficiaries of the trust.Â  Unsure of their authority in this regard, the trustees, J. Jackson Thomas and Claude M. Epps, Jr., petitioned the probate court for a declaratory judgment on whether such payments fell within their discretionary powers as trustees.Â  Pursuant to a motion filed by Paul, the case was removed to the circuit court and subsequently referred to the master-in-equity by consent of the parties.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing on the matter, the master held that â€œ[b]ased on the ordinary meaning of the language used in the Will, the Trustees are not authorized to make distributions to the Respondent Stevens or Respondent Lutch for the health, support, maintenance and education of their current or future children.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review for a declaratory judgment action is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  This case involves the construction of a will, which is an action at law.Â  See NationsBank of South Carolina v. Greenwood, 321 S.C. 386, 392, 468 S.E.2d 658, 662 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  This courtâ€™s review is therefore limited to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe court-appointed guardian of Niles Stevensâ€™ unborn heirs, the trustees, and beneficiary Paul Stevens all argue, in some fashion or another, that it is permissible under the terms of the trust for the trustees to consider the educational needs of Paulâ€™s children when determining what constitutes a proper distribution for Paulâ€™s â€œsupport.â€Â  We agree.\r\nIt is self-evident that the establishment of a trust involves some degree of confidence in the integrity, ability, and genuineness of another individual or entity, the trustee.Â  This truism is given increased credence when the trustee is bestowed a discretionary power, which the trustee â€œmay either exercise or refrain from exercising.â€Â  Page v. Page, 243 S.C. 312, 315, 133 S.E.2d 829, 831 (1963).Â  When determining the extent of a trusteeâ€™s discretionary power, courts should keep in mind that the allocation of discretionary authority â€œis done out of a desire to obtain the trusteeâ€™s honest judgment, perhaps even to the exclusion of the judgment of the court.â€Â  76 Am. Jur. 2d Trusts Â§ 346 (1992).Â  The mere fact that â€œif the discretion had been conferred upon the court, [it] would have exercised the power differently is not a sufficient reason for interfering with the exercise of the power by the trustee.â€ Page, 243 S.C. at 316, 133 S.E.2d at 832.Â  The trust in question is replete with language reflecting this intent on the part of the grantor, the most persuasive being the language of the clause in question: â€œmy trustee may pay . . . such sums from the principal or accumulated income of this trust as in his sole discretion shall be necessary or advisable.â€[1]  \r\nKeeping in mind the general notion that the grantor intended to give the trusteesâ€™ judgment much consequence, we move now to the issue at the heart of this appeal, namely, what considerations are appropriate under the trustâ€™s terms when determining whether to make a distribution for a beneficiaryâ€™s â€œsupport.â€Â  It was the position of the master, deciding the case in the absence of any South Carolina case law directly on point, that because the trust only granted the trustees the power to make trust distributions for the support of the named beneficiaries, it was improper for them to make distributions that would chiefly benefit the beneficiariesâ€™ children.Â  We appreciate the masterâ€™s thorough analysis in this matter, especially considering the issueâ€™s novelty in this state, but conclude that the questioned distributions fall within the discretionary authority of the trustees, subject of course to traditional judicial oversight of possible abuse of trustee discretion.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we are persuaded by the rationale of several other jurisdictions deciding similar, if not identical, matters.Â  In Robinson v. Elston Bank &amp; Trust Co., 48 N.E.2d 181 (Ind. Ct. App. 1943), the Indiana Court of Appeals, interpreting a trust for the support, maintenance, and enjoyment of a beneficiary, approved distributions to the beneficiary even though they predominately benefited his wife and children.Â  Explaining its conclusions, the court held, â€œ[t]he needs of a married man include not only needs personal to him, but also the needs of his family living with him and entitled to his support.â€Â  Id. at 189.Â  Analyzing a similar situation, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that a beneficiaryâ€™s needs included â€œnot only his needs, but also the needs of his family.â€Â  Eaton v. Lovering, 125 A. 433, 433 (N.H. 1924); see also Finch v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A., 577 S.E.2d 306, 348 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003) (interpreting a trust established for the â€œreasonable needsâ€ of a beneficiary, the court concluded the trustee erred in determining that the invasion of trust funds for the purpose of funding beneficiaryâ€™s familial gift giving was beyond its discretion); First Natâ€™l Bank of Beaumont v. Howard, 229 S.W.2d 781, 785-86 (Tex. 1950) (finding trust distributions for the purpose of funding the college education of beneficiaryâ€™s children fell within the trusteeâ€™s discretionary authority when the trust was established for the beneficiaryâ€™s â€œsupport.â€).[2]Â  We likewise hold, in recognition of the grantorâ€™s intent to vest broad discretionary authority in the trustees, that a trustee may consider the needs of a beneficiaryâ€™s family when determining what distributions would be â€œnecessary and advisableâ€ for the beneficiaryâ€™s â€œsupport.â€ \r\nRespondent Laura Stevensâ€™ most compelling argument against interpreting the term â€œsupportâ€ broadly when determining the metes and bounds of trustee discretion relates to another broad aim of establishing many trusts, spendthrift protection.Â Â  It is her position that our interpretation would allow meddlesome invasions into the trust funds by non-beneficiaries and creditors, despite the clear trust language that the trust shall not â€œbe liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, obligations, liabilities or torts of any beneficiary.â€Â  After due consideration of this argument, we are not persuaded of its merit.\r\nFirst, nothing in the present decision speaks to trust claims asserted by non-beneficiaries.Â  We hold merely that consideration of a beneficiaryâ€™s familial obligations falls within a trusteeâ€™s discretion when determining what constitutes a proper distribution for the beneficiaryâ€™s â€œsupport.â€Â  There would be nothing inconsistent with this opinion in barring a claim asserted by a non-beneficiary, even if that claim was based on a beneficiaryâ€™s familial obligations, on the basis that the trust does not authorize distributions to non-beneficiaries.Â  See e.g., First Natâ€™l Bank of Beaumont, 299 S.W.2d at 785-86 (holding that beneficiariesâ€™ children were absolutely barred under the terms of the trust from claiming through the trust because they were not beneficiaries; however, consideration of their educational needs was within trustee discretion in determining the propriety of distributions to the beneficiaries [the parents]); see also Burrage v. Bucknam 16 N.E.2d 705, 706-07 (Mass. 1938) (holding that wife and child of beneficiary were barred from collecting judgment [based on husbandâ€™s failure to support] from trust funds because the trustâ€™s terms unambiguously authorized payments to husband only).Â  Such a situation is not presently before this court and this opinion should not be interpreted as authority, persuasive or otherwise, in regard to such matters. \r\nSecond, as in all matters involving trustee discretion, the considerations approved by this opinion remain subject to the traditional oversight and supervisory control of the courts.Â  â€œ[A] trustee does not have absolute and uncontrolled discretion in disbursing trust funds.â€Â  Page, 243 S.C. at 316, 133 S.E.2d at 831.Â  In any discretionary action, a trustee must eliminate all selfish interest and â€œexercise the reasonable care, prudence and diligence in the management of trust assets as a reasonably prudent man would do with relation to his own affairs.â€Â \r\nCartee v. Lesley, 290 S.C. 333, 336, 350 S.E.2d 388, 390 (1986).Â  â€œPunitive damages may be imposed upon a trustee where there is evidence his management of the [trust] was in bad faith or conscious indifference to the rights of the beneficiaries.â€Â  Id.Â Â  The considerations we hold today fall within a trusteeâ€™s discretion must still be made with this requisite degree of care and prudence, and any alleged abuse of that discretion remains subject to court review.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the master-in-equityâ€™s decision is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] See also Trust Article IV (â€œusing so much of the net income and principal of such share as my trustee deems necessary,â€ â€œamounts shall be paid out by my trustee in such of the following ways as my trustee may deem bestâ€); Trust Article V (â€œmy trustee[s] . . . are authorized in their absolute discretionâ€ to take any one of nineteen listed actions regarding the management of trust property) (emphasis added).\r\n[2] The master based his decision on the rationale of Cavett v. Buck, 397 P.2d 901 (Okla. 1964), an Oklahoma case deciding a similar trust issue.Â  Although at first glance this decision seems to run contrary to our conclusions in the present case, we are not convinced the Oklahoma Supreme Court would necessarily decide the present appeal differently than we do here.Â  The court in Cavett acknowledged that other jurisdictions included the needs of a beneficiaryâ€™s family in interpreting the term â€œsupport,â€ but distinguished the case before it based on trust language specifically limiting distributions to those made for the â€œindividual supportâ€ of the beneficiary. Id. at 904-05.Â  Such limiting language was not employed in the trust presently before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3994","title":"The Huffines Co. v.

Lockhart (Lockhart) to recover a real estate brokerage commission.Â  The circuit court found that Lockhart had breached the partiesâ€™ Listing Agreement and directed a verdict in favor of the Huffines Company, LLC.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCalvert Huffines (Huffines) is a licensed real estate broker in South Carolina.Â  He owns the Huffines Company, LLC, a small real estate company located in Colleton County.Â  Lockhart hired Huffines to find a buyer for fifty acres of land located in Hendersonville, South Carolina (the Hendersonville property).Â  She listed the Hendersonville property with Huffines on April 26, 1999, for a selling price of $250,000.Â  The Listing Agreement provided, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nI (we), the seller(s), grant you the right to sell or transfer this property from the date of this agreement to and including 4/30/2000, and to accept deposit thereon, and employ you to procure a purchaser, ready, willing and able to buy this property at the listed price and terms, or at a price and terms that are acceptable to me. . . . \r\nIf a buyer or transferee ready, willing and able to buy or exchange for this property is procured by you, I agree to pay you a commission of 10% of the selling price, or a minimum commission of $200, whichever is greater.\r\nIf within six months after the termination of this agreement I sell or transfer this property to a prospect procured by you prior to its termination, I shall pay you your commission . . . . \r\n\r\nHuffines subsequently marketed the Hendersonville property.Â  He informed area brokers of the listing, talked to neighboring property owners, and disseminated plats and descriptions of the property.Â  Huffines learned from a newspaper article that the Colleton County School Board (the School Board) was searching for property suitable for a new school.Â  On November 10, 1999, he wrote a letter to the Colleton County Department of Education and School Board members to inform them that the Hendersonville property was for sale and â€œwould make an excellent site for a school.â€ \r\nElbert O. Duffie, general counsel for the Colleton County School District, was retained to seek out suitable properties for the new school. Â He compiled a list of twenty or thirty sites that met the School Boardâ€™s criteria.Â  The Hendersonville property was not placed on his initial list of suitable properties.Â  However, Duffie was later forwarded a copy of the letter Huffines sent to the School Board.Â  Duffie contacted Huffines and the two began a series of conversations concerning the property.Â  Eventually, Duffie placed the Hendersonville property on his list of possible properties for the School Board to purchase. \r\nDuffie informed Huffines that the School Board would be willing to pay a maximum of $3,500 an acre for the property.Â  Huffines conveyed this information to Lockhart in an email dated March 20, 2000.Â  Lockhart responded by email that same day, instructing Huffines to let the School Board know she was willing to accept that amount for the property.Â  On March 21, 2000, the School Board held a regular meeting at which the trustees authorized Duffie to secure an option to purchase the Hendersonville property for $3,500 an acre.Â  Duffie prepared a draft option contract.Â  The School Board agreed to pay $1,000 for the option.Â  On March 22, 2000, Lockhart emailed Huffines, informing him she did not feel the offer was a good one and requesting additional information about the transaction. \r\nDuffieâ€™s next communication concerning the property was from Edward M. Brown, Lockhartâ€™s attorney.Â  In a letter dated April 24, 2000, Brown informed Duffie that he had been asked to intercede in the real estate transaction.Â  The letter stated that $3,500 an acre was unacceptable.Â  Huffines received a letter from Lockhart, dated April 24, 2000, which requested he direct all communications concerning the property to Brown.\r\nOn April 30, 2000, the Listing Agreement expired.Â  However, the agreement provided that Huffines was still entitled to a commission if the property was sold or transferred within six months of the expiration of the agreement to a buyer procured by Huffines.Â  The six-month time period ran until October 30, 2000. \r\nBrown and Duffie continued to negotiate the sale of the property after the Listing Agreement expired.Â  Lockhart demanded a new price of $5,000 an acre and an option price of $10,000.Â  The School Board trustees subsequently rejected the $5,000 an acre offer.Â  Lockhart reduced the asking price to $4,500 an acre with a $1,000 option price.Â  The trustees voted to accept that purchase price, and the parties signed an option contract on May 8, 2000.Â  The option contract stated:\r\n\r\nWhereas, it is agreed that the Option price of the property located on Highway 17-A (Hendersonville Highway), near the Community of Hendersonville, in Colleton County, South Carolina, TMS#234-00-00-042, containing fifty (50) acres, more or less, and one (1) improvement shall be Four Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 ($4,500.00) Dollars per acre. . .Â  \r\n. . . [B]ut in the event that the Option is not exercised within one hundred eighty (180) days, the Optionor is no longer obligated and may retain the One Thousand and No/100 ($1,000.00) Dollar consideration. . . .\r\n\r\nPursuant to a United States District Court Consent Order, issued on November 17, 1999, the School Board was required to obtain permission from the United States Justice Department before building a new school at a designated site.Â  Duffie contacted a Justice Department attorney, Dan Foreman, prior to 2000.Â  They subsequently discussed obtaining approval for the placement of a school upon the Hendersonville property. Â In early September of 2000, Foreman visited Colleton County and viewed the Hendersonville property.Â  After observing the site, Foreman orally informed Duffie that the property was suitable for the purpose of a school.Â  However, written approval was not forthcoming until November 1, 2000. \r\nLockhart testified that at some point after she signed the Listing Agreement, her half brother indicated he thought he should share in any proceeds obtained from the Hendersonville property. Â He later informed Lockhart that he had retained an attorney to pursue his claim.Â  Lockhart filed a clear title action on September 18, 2000. Â Lockhart was adjudged the owner of the property in fee simple absolute on November 13, 2000. \r\nOn October 17, 2000, the School Board trustees voted to purchase the Hendersonville property pending approval from the U.S. Justice Department. Â Although no contract of sale was ever signed, Lockhart sold the Hendersonville property to the School Board on November 16, 2000, for $4,500 an acre. \r\nHuffines attended the closing, but Lockhart refused to pay him a commission.Â  The Huffines Company, LLC initiated this action alleging Lockhart breached the Listing Agreement by not paying Huffines a commission.Â  The circuit court directed a verdict in favor of the Huffines Company, LLC on the breach of contract claim in the amount of $21,906.Â  Additionally, the circuit judge held that Huffines procured a buyer in March of 2000 when he negotiated to sell the property for $3,500 an acre.Â  The judge ruled that a sale or transfer of the property occurred in May of 2000 (within the six-month expiration period) when the School Board signed the option contract.Â  He further held that a sale or transfer occurred on October 17, 2000, when the School Board voted to exercise the option contract.Â  The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Huffines Company on a breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act claim.Â  However, no punitive damages were awarded.Â  \r\n&nbsp;STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.Â  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Deptâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999); accord Hurd v. Williamsburg County, Op. No. 25959 (S.C. Sup.

Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 860 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should have been denied.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003); Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).\r\n\r\n A motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and may be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability.Â  Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346, 358, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972).Â  When the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476-77, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999); Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 860 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, if the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the case must be submitted to the jury.Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, Op. No. 25959 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 28, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 28); Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998); Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 426, 489 S.E.2d 223, 223 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\n When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002); Pond Place Partners v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002); Boddie-Noell Props., Inc. v. 42 Magnolia Pâ€™ship, 344 S.C. 474, 482, 544 S.E.2d 279, 283 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d as modified by 352 S.C. 437, 574 S.E.2d 726 (2002).Â Â  The issue must be submitted to the jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).Â  Yet, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views to the jury.Â  Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 461, 494 S.E.2d 835, 848 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Our courts have recognized that when only one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for the court.Â  Bell v. Bank of Abbeville, 211 S.C. 167, 173, 44 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1947); Small, 329 S.C. at 461, 494 S.E.2d at 848.Â  A corollary of this rule is that verdicts may not be permitted to rest upon surmise, conjecture, or speculation.Â  Hanahan, 326 S.C. at 149, 485 S.E.2d at 908; Small, 329 S.C. at 461, 494 S.E.2d at 848.Â  This does not mean the court should ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.Â  Long v. Norris &amp; Assocs., Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 568, 538 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2000); Love v. Gamble, 316 S.C. 203, 208, 448 S.E.2d 876, 879 (Ct. App. 1994). In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence.Â  Pond Place Partners, Inc., 351 S.C. at 15, 567 S.E.2d at 888.Â  \r\nThis Court will reverse only where there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling, or where the ruling was controlled by an error of law.Â  Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Public Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005); Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999); Abu-Shawareb v. S.C. State Univ. Op. No. 3968 (S.C. Ct.

App. 2000).Â  Essentially, our Court must resolve whether it would be reasonably conceivable to have a verdict for a party opposing the motion under the facts as liberally construed in the opposing partyâ€™s favor.Â  Harvey, 350 S.C. at 309, 566 S.E.2d at 532; Hanahan, 326 S.C. at 149, 485 S.E.2d at 908.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLockhart argues the circuit court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of Huffines.Â  We agree. \r\nThe Listing Agreement provided alternative conditions precedent to the brokerâ€™s right to recover a commission.Â  The first condition precedent required Huffines to procure a buyer or transferee who was â€œready, willing and able to buy or exchangeâ€ for the Hendersonville property.Â  Alternatively, Huffines was entitled to a commission if Lockhart actually sold or transferred the property to a â€œprospect procured by [Huffines]â€ within six months after the termination of the Listing Agreement.Â  The circuit court erred in ruling Huffines was entitled to payment under either clause.Â Â Â  \r\nI.Â  Ready, Willing, and Able\r\nFirst, Lockhart contends the circuit court judge erred in directing a verdict on the basis that Huffines procured a buyer when the Listing Agreement required him to procure a ready, willing, and able buyer.Â  We agree.\r\nIn issuing his ruling, the circuit judge stated: \r\n\r\nâ€œ[I]t was Mr. Huffines who made this deal take place, who put Ms. Lockhart in the position of selling this piece of property to the School District.Â  \r\nThere is no way in the facts of this case that this piece of property would have ever been sold to the School District had it not been for the work that Mr. Huffines did. \r\nNow, under those circumstances, and when Mr. Huffines brings this deal to the table and gets an agreement between them within the one year of the listing agreement, that is clearly to procure a purchaser within the term of that contract, and clearly he is entitled to his ten percent commission.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an agreement, a broker is entitled to a commission when he procures a sales contract that is both valid and enforceable by the seller, regardless whether the contract actually closes.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., Op. No. 25947 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 22, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 65); Dantzler Real Estate, Inc. v. Boland, 276 S.C. 275, 277-78, 277 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1981); Cass Co. v. Nannarello, 274 S.C. 326, 328, 262 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1980); Thomas-McCain, Inc. v.

App. 2002).Â  The fact that a buyer and seller enter into a sales agreement without the brokerâ€™s knowledge does not defeat his right to commission. Â Dantzler, 276 S.C. at 278, 277 S.E.2d at 706.Â  \r\nâ€œThe broker and the owner may, however, make the brokerâ€™s right to the commission contingent upon the occurrence of certain conditions.â€Â  Champion v. Whaley, 280 S.C. 116, 119, 311 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Hamrick v. Cooper River Lumber Co., 223 S.C. 119, 74 S.E.2d 575 (1953)); accord Chambers, 351 S.C. at 451, 570 S.E.2d at 532.Â  A real estate broker suing on a conditional sales contract has the burden of proving that all conditions precedent to his right to a commission have occurred.Â  Champion, 280 S.C. at 120, 311 S.E.2d at 406; Griffith v. Newell, 69 S.C. 300, 48 S.E. 259 (1904).Â  â€œA broker assumes the risk of the purchaserâ€™s nonperformance where the purchaserâ€™s performance is a condition precedent to the ownerâ€™s duty to pay the brokerâ€™s commission.â€Â  Chambers, 351 S.C. at 451, 570 S.E.2d at 532; accord Champion, 280 S.C. at 119, 311 S.E.2d at 406.Â  \r\nAs a threshold matter, we note the Listing Agreement does not define â€œprocure.â€Â  According to The American Heritage Dictionary 958 (2nd College ed. 1982), the term means â€œ[t]o obtain; acquire,â€ or, â€œ[t]o bring about.â€Â  Williston on Contracts observes that procurement has been defined as â€œconsisting of the brokerâ€™s efforts that are the efficient cause, but not necessarily the sole cause, of a series of unbroken, continuous events, which culminate in the accomplishment of the objective of the employment.â€Â  23 Williston on Contracts Â§ 62:19 (4th ed. 2004).Â  Cf. Edmonds v. Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate Servs. Inc., 377 S.E.2d 443 (Va. 1989) (finding a real estate broker is the procuring cause of a sale when it has originated or caused a series of events which, without break in their continuity, result in the accomplishment of the prime object of its employment).Â  \r\nLockhart admits that Huffines found a buyer for her property.Â  When asked if Huffines introduced the School Board to her, she replied, â€œHe found the School Board, yes.â€Â  Duffie testified as follows to Huffinesâ€™ role in brokering the transaction: â€œThe property would not have been recommended by me or it wouldnâ€™t have been put on the list that the School Board was utilizing as a list of potential properties to buy. . . . I had specifically excluded it.â€Â  It is clear from the record that but for the involvement of Huffines, the School Board would not have considered the Hendersonville property.Â  Accordingly, we find that Huffines did procure the School Board for the purposes of the Listing Agreement.Â  However, whether the School Board was a ready, willing, and able buyer is a separate inquiry.\r\nThe School Board was governed by the Consent Order which stated:Â  â€œ[T]he District will present any proposed site for a new school to the United States for its approval . . . .â€Â  Lockhart argues the School Board was not able to purchase the property until Justice Department approval was granted on November 1, 2000.Â  Thus, she asserts Huffines did not procure a buyer who was ready, willing, and able to purchase the property before the expiration of the Listing Agreement on April 30, 2000.\r\n\r\nEach of the words â€œready,â€ â€œwilling,â€ and â€œableâ€ expresses an idea that the others do not convey.Â  All three of these elements must exist in the customer, in order to entitle the broker to a commission.Â  It is not sufficient that the customer is ready and willing, but he or she must also have the ability to carry out the loan, sale, purchase, or exchange.Â  So also, the procurement of a ready, willing, and able purchaser by a broker involves not only a showing that the purchaser has the financial ability to complete the contract, but also that the purchaser is ready and willing to purchase at a price and on terms prescribed by the vendor.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nIn determining whether a ready, willing, and financially able purchaser is produced, developments subsequent to the time the transaction is closed, are not considered and are irrelevant.\r\n\r\n12 C.J.S. Brokers Â§ 225 (2004) (footnotes omitted).Â  See generally Annotation, 87 ALR 4th 11 (observing the requirements of providing an â€œableâ€ buyer; noting the term â€œableâ€ refers to both legal and financial ability; and discussing numerous issues pertaining to a potential buyerâ€™s financial ability).\r\nConflicting testimony exists concerning the application of the required Justice Department approval.Â  Lynette Bryant Fryar served on the School Board during the negotiations over the purchase of the Hendersonville property.Â  At trial, Fryar averred the School Board could not have purchased the property in question without approval from the United States Justice Department.Â  Duffie, however, testified the permission sought was not to purchase the property in question, but to build a school on that piece of property.Â  He stated the School District could have purchased the Hendersonville property without the Justice Departmentâ€™s approval.Â  Furthermore, even had the School Board been financially able to purchase the Hendersonville property without Justice Department approval, a jury might find that it would be unwilling to do so if the Justice Department withheld its permission to allow the School Board to build a new school on the property.Â  \r\nConsequently, we hold the circuit court erred in ruling Huffines earned his commission under the clause requiring him to procure a ready, willing, and able buyer within the time limits of the Listing Agreement.Â  More than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence in the record.Â  Therefore, this issue should have been submitted to the jury. \r\nII.Â  Sale or Transfer Within Six Months of Expiration\r\nLockhart contends the circuit court erred in finding the property was sold for purposes of the Listing Agreement when the School Board signed the option agreement, and when the School Board voted to exercise the option.\r\nThe Listing Agreement stated: â€œ[I]f within six months after the termination of this agreement I sell or transfer this property to a prospect procured by you prior to its termination, I shall pay you your commission.â€Â  Thus, even if Huffines failed to procure a ready, willing, and able buyer before the expiration of the Listing Agreement, he is nonetheless entitled to a commission if the property actually sold by October 30, 2000â€”within six months of the agreementâ€™s expiration. \r\nThe circuit court judge proclaimed: \r\n\r\n. . . I am ruling that in May of 2000 when the School District signed the option agreement that that is a sale or transfer of the property as those terms are used in this contract, and Iâ€™m also ruling that in Octoberâ€”on the 17th of October 2000, when the School District voted to exercise the option that they had signed, that that also was a sale or transfer of the property.\r\nAnd I fully understand that thoseâ€”that neither of those actions taken by the School District were binding on the School District.\r\nThey could have changed their minds, but theâ€”using the language of procured by you, that is a sale or isâ€”that is indistinguishable on the facts of this case from the contract for sale that is entered into as it would be under normal circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\nA sale of real property is complete when the seller has an unconditional right, under a valid contract of sale, to demand performance from a purchaser.Â  See Champion, 280 S.C. at 119, 311 S.E.2d at 406.Â  No sales contract was executed in this case.Â  However, an option contract was entered into between Lockhart and the School Board on May 8, 2000.Â Â  \r\nIt is well settled in South Carolina that an option contract merely gives the right to purchase, without imposing any obligation to do so.Â  Faulkner v. Millar, 319 S.C. 216, 220, 460 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1995).Â  An option is to be distinguished from a sale or a contract to sell.Â  Hutto v. Wiggins, 175 S.C. 202, 205, 178 S.E. 869, 871 (1935).Â  \r\n\r\nThe chief difference between a contract to sell and purchase real property, and an option to purchase said property lies in the fact that, while the former creates a mutual obligation on the part of one party to sell and the other to purchase, the option merely gives the right to purchase, at a fixed price, within a fixed time, without imposing any obligation to do so.Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nAn option contract is a promise which limits the promisorâ€™s power to revoke an offer.Â  Faulkner, 319 S.C. at 220, 460 S.E.2d at 380.Â  An optionee who is not in possession of property assumes no risk and enjoys no interest in the property.Â  Edens &amp; Avant Invest. Prop. v. Amerada Hess Corp., 318 S.C. 134,136, 456 S.E.2d 406, 407 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nIn Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Associates, 340 S.C. 98, 531 S.E.2d 287 (2000), our supreme court edified:\r\n\r\nOption contracts generally have three main characteristics: (1) they are unilateral contracts where the optionor, for a valuable consideration, grants the optionee a right to make a contract of purchase but does not bind the optionee to do so; (2) they are continuing offers to sell, irrevocable during the option period; and (3) the transition of an option into a contract of purchase and sale can only be effected by an unqualified and unconditional acceptance of the offer in accordance with the terms and within the time specified in the option contract.\r\n\r\nId. at 108, 531 S.E.2d at 292.Â  Option contracts are strictly construed in favor of the optionor and against the optionee.Â  Id. (citing Cotter v. James L. Tapp Co., 267 S.C. 647, 230 S.E.2d 715 (1976)).\r\nWe disagree with the circuit court that the parties intended an option contract to be considered a sale for the purposes of the Listing Agreement.Â  The two sentences at issue in this case provide different mechanisms for triggering Huffinesâ€™ entitlement to a commission.Â  Under the first provision, Huffinesâ€™ commission was not contingent upon the sale of the property.Â  He would have been entitled to his commission even if no sale occurred, provided he procured a buyer who was ready, willing, and able to purchase.Â  This provision is more broker-friendly than the common-law default rule which makes payment contingent upon the buyer and seller entering into a contract for the sale of the property.Â Â Â  \r\nThe second provision makes actual sale or transfer within six months of the expiration of the listing agreement the trigger for payment of a commission.Â  There is simply nothing to suggest that the parties meant anything other than â€œsell or transferâ€ when they used those terms in the Listing Agreement.Â  An option to purchase does not give the seller an enforceable right and is not a sale.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Huffines did not become entitled to a commission when the parties entered into the option contract.Â  \r\nHuffines argues Lockhart (1) interfered with his ability to negotiate the selling price under the Listing Agreement by hiring an attorney prior to April 30, the agreementâ€™s expiration date, and (2) prevented the property from selling within the sixth-month period.Â  He contends that â€œeven if the listing agreement contained a condition precedent, Huffines would still be entitled to his commissionâ€ because Lockhart prevented the condition from occurring.Â  \r\nOn April 24, 2000, six days before the expiration of the Listing Agreement, Lockhart informed Huffines via letter that Brown would be handling negotiations of the property.Â  As a result, Lockhart made a counteroffer to the School Boardâ€™s proposal of $3,500 per acre through Brown rather than Huffines.Â  \r\nOn September 18, 2000, Lockhart filed a clear title action to adjudicate the ownership of the Hendersonville property.Â  According to Lockhart, her half brother informed her that â€œhe was the oldest child, . . . that he should be the one to distribute the property,â€ and that â€œhe thought he should have it.â€Â  Her half brother allegedly informed Lockhart that â€œhe had gotten an attorney in Savannah . . . . [t]o see what he could get.â€Â  In response, Lockhart filed the clear title action.Â  Lockhartâ€™s brother did not make an appearance, however.Â  He was adjudged in default, and Lockhart was decreed owner of the Hendersonville property in fee simple absolute.Â  \r\nA broker ordinarily has the burden of proving that any conditions precedent to the duty of the seller to pay have been fulfilled.Â  Champion, 280 S.C. at 120, 311 S.E.2d at 406.Â  However, if a seller prevents a condition from occurring, then the condition is excused and his obligation to payÂ  becomes unconditional.Â  Id. (citing Shear v. National Rifle Association of America, 606 F.2d 1251 (D.C. Cir. 1979)); Chambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 451, 570 S.E.2d 528, 532-33 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Helms Realty, Op. No. 25947 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 22, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 65 n.2) (â€œA party that wrongfully prevents satisfaction of a condition precedent to its performance is not excused from performing.â€).Â  â€œIt is sufficient for the plaintiff to present evidence that the defendantâ€™s prevention â€˜substantially contributedâ€™ to the nonoccurrence of the condition.â€Â  Chambers, 351 S.C. at 452, 570 S.E.2d at 533.Â  If the seller can then prove that the condition precedent would not have occurred regardless of the prevention, then the condition is not excused.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Champion v. Whaley, 280 S.C. 116, 311 S.E.2d 404 (Ct. App. 1984), Champion had an exclusive listing agreement with the sellers.Â  The agreement made Championâ€™s commission contingent upon selling the house.Â  Champion procured a potential buyer, Bell.Â  Bell and the sellers entered a contract for the sale of the house, contingent upon Bellâ€™s obtaining financing.Â  However, the sellers soon informed Champion that they had sold the house to another buyer.Â  Loan officers, in the process of finalizing Bellâ€™s loan, attempted to appraise the house, but found it occupied by a man who told them he had purchased the house from the sellers.Â  As a result, Bellâ€™s loan was not finalized.Â  \r\nPursuant to the agreement, â€œ[a] sale would be completed when the Sellers had an unconditional right, under a valid contract of sale, to demand performance from a purchaser procured by Champion.â€Â  280 S.C. 119, 311 S.E.2d at 406.Â  â€œUntil that time, the risk of the purchaserâ€™s nonperformance was on Champion.â€Â  Id. at 119, 311 S.E.2d at 406.Â  We observed: â€œalmost all cases in which prevention is alleged will involve speculation as to what would have happened had the defendantâ€™s conduct not taken place.â€Â  280 S.C. 121, 311 S.E.2d at 407.Â  â€œIn view of the difficulties of proof created by the Sellersâ€™ own conduct,â€ we held that\r\n\r\nChampion was not required to show the loan would have closed â€œbut forâ€ the prevention of the condition.Â  It is sufficient for the plaintiff to present evidence that the defendantâ€™s prevention â€˜substantially contributedâ€™ to the nonoccurrence of the condition. . . . Once he has made such proof, the burden shifts to the defendant.Â  If the defendant can show that the condition would not have occurred regardless of the prevention, then the prevention did not contribute materially to its nonoccurrence and the condition is not excused. \r\n\r\n280 S.C. at 122, 311 S.E.2d at 407.Â  We remanded so that a jury could decide the question of prevention.Â  Subsequently, in Chambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 453, 570 S.E.2d 528, 534 (Ct. App. 2002), we articulated: â€œChampion clearly implies that the prevention of the condition precedent must be intentional or entail wrongdoing.â€\r\nThe record contains conflicting evidence concerning the allegation that Lockhart instituted the clear title action to delay the closing.Â  Lockhartâ€™s brother did not make an appearance in the clear title action.Â  Moreover, Lockhartâ€™s father deeded the property to her in September of 1997.Â  However, the original option extended through November 10, 2000.Â  Thus, the property might have sold outside the sixth-month period even if the clear title case had not been filed.Â  Additionally, when asked if the clear title action had any effect on the School Board exercising its option, Duffie declared: â€œNone that I know of.â€Â  Yvonne Robinson, a member of the School Board during the time of the events in question, testified Lockhart did nothing to delay the closing. \r\nThe issue is one for a jury to resolve.Â  If a jury finds the School Board was not a ready, willing, and able buyer, Huffines may still be entitled to the commission if the jury finds that Lockhart intentionally prevented the occurrence of the alternative condition precedent.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Lockhart, the factual issues are capable of more than one reasonable inference.Â  The Listing Agreement entitled Huffines to a commission only if (1) Huffines procured a ready, willing, and able buyer before the expiration of the agreement, or (2) Lockhart sold or transferred the property within six months of the expiration of the Listing Agreement to a prospect procured by Huffines.Â  Whether the School Board was a ready, willing, and able buyer was a question for the jury.Â  Additionally, whether Lockhart intentionally prevented the occurrence of the alternative condition precedent is a jury issue.Â  For edification on remand, we hold that a sale did NOT take place within the sixth-month expiration period.Â  The directed verdict was thus improper.Â  We reverse and remand this case for a new trial. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3995","title":"Cole v.

Maybank, and Deborah Sheffield, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this medical negligence action, Marty and Tracy Cole appeal from a verdict in favor of Dr. Pratibha P. Raut and her medical practice.Â  The Coles argue the circuit court erred in charging the jury on assumption of risk.Â  We agree, and reverse and remand for a new trial.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe day before delivering her son, Kyle, Tracy Cole (â€œColeâ€) was admitted to the hospital.Â  Coleâ€™s obstetrician, Dr. Raut, recommended that she undergo a vaginal birth after Cesarean section (â€œVBACâ€).Â  Although a VBAC carried risks including the possibility that the uterine scar from Coleâ€™s previous C-Section could rupture during labor and deprive the baby of oxygen, this procedure was the recommended method of delivery at that time. Cole signed a consent form acknowledging the risks associated with the VBAC procedure.Â  She consented to a vaginal delivery, induction with medication, augmentation with medication, and retained the option of delivering by C-section if necessary.Â Â  The consent form specifically stated that Cole:\r\n\r\n[R]ecognize[s] that during the course of the [procedure], unforeseen conditions may necessitate additional or different procedures or services than those set forth above and . . . further authorize[s] and request[s] that the above named surgeon . . . perform such procedures as are in his [sic] professional judgment, necessary and desirable. \r\n\r\nThe Coles admit that they â€œelected to face the risks of [VBAC]â€ and do not allege negligence in the doctorâ€™s choice of treatment to which they had consented.Â  Rather, they complain that Rautâ€™s timing in ordering the C-section was a departure from the standard of care.Â  \r\nAs part of the VBAC procedure, Raut induced Coleâ€™s labor on February 21, 1997.Â  Despite the decision to proceed with the VBAC, Raut retained a surgical crew on-call in case an emergency C-section became necessary.Â  Coleâ€™s labor progressed slowly.Â  At approximately 1:30 a.m. the following day, a fetal heart monitor indicated changes in the babyâ€™s heart rate.Â  At approximately 2:00 a.m., changes in the babyâ€™s heart rate necessitated administration of oxygen to Cole and continued close observation of the babyâ€™s vital signs.Â  At that time, Raut unsuccessfully attempted to notify the operating room personnel, who were engaged in another surgical procedure, to remain in the hospital.Â  At 2:15 a.m., Cole began to complain of abdominal pains, indicating her uterine wall had ruptured and requiring an emergency C-section.Â  At 2:20 a.m., Raut formally ordered that Cole undergo a C-section delivery.Â  The surgical procedure began at 2:42 a.m., twenty-two minutes after the formal order.Â  Kyle was born at 2:45 a.m.Â  He suffered from brain damage and related problems including cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and a seizure disorder.Â  Kyle died in August 2003 as a result of his conditions.\r\nBoth parties presented expert testimony.Â  The Colesâ€™ expert testified that in this case, waiting until 2:20 a.m. to order a C-section was â€œnot acceptable.â€ Â He maintained that â€œearly warning signs,â€ including variables in the babyâ€™s heart rate, warranted that a C-section be ordered by 2:00 a.m.Â  According to the Colesâ€™ expert, had Dr. Raut ordered the C-section by 2:00 a.m., the operating room staff should have been able to perform the surgery and deliver the child at the latest by 2:30.Â  The Colesâ€™ expert testified that the baby would have been neurologically normal if he were delivered by â€œ2:30 [a.m.] or 2:33 [a.m.] or 2:32 [a.m.].â€Â  The expert stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that â€œthe doctor fell below reasonable standards of care when she failed to recognize the non-reassuring tracing [on the fetal heart monitor] at two oâ€™clock and failed to set up for a possible emergency C-section.â€ \r\nRaut presented two expert witnesses who testified that she did not deviate from the appropriate standard of care with respect to the timing of the C-section.Â  One expert testified that there were no signs mandating an emergency C-section until 2:20 a.m. at which time Raut recognized the problem â€œright awayâ€ and â€œimmediately then called for a stat C-section.â€ \r\nDuring trial, Raut sought to amend her pleadings to include assumption of risk as an affirmative defense.Â  The trial court reserved its ruling until the close of the evidence. Â At the close of the case, the trial court charged the jury on the law of negligence and on assumption of risk.Â  The Coles objected to the charge of assumption of risk.Â  The jury returned a general verdict for Raut.Â Â  The Coles then moved for a new trial on the grounds that Cole never assumed the risk of a delayed emergency C-section.Â  Â The trial court denied the motion.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions, an appellate court will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â \r\nId. (citation omitted).Â  The trial court is required to instruct the jury only on principles of law that apply to the issues raised in the pleadings and developed by the evidence in support of those issues.Â Â  Id. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Coles argue the trial judge committed reversible error by instructing the jury on assumption of risk.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œ[I]t is reversible error to charge a correct principle of law as governing a case when such principle is inapplicable to the issues on trial.â€Â \r\nMiller v. Schmid Labs., Inc.,&nbsp;307 S.C. 140, 142-43, 414 S.E.2d 126, 127&nbsp;(1992) (quoting Dunsil v. E.M. Jones Chevrolet Co., 268 S.C. 291, 295, 233 S.E.2d 101, 103 (1977)).\r\nâ€œIn order for the doctrine of assumption of the risk to apply, the injured party must have freely and voluntarily exposed himself to a known danger which he understood and appreciated.â€ Faile v. Bycura,&nbsp;289 S.C. 398, 399, 346 S.E.2d 528, 529&nbsp;(1986) (citation omitted).Â  The specific requirements of the defense of assumption of risk are:Â  â€œ(1) the plaintiff must have knowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition; (2) the plaintiff must know the condition is dangerous; (3) the plaintiff must appreciate the nature and extent of the danger; and (4) the plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself to the danger.â€Â  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime,&nbsp;333 S.C. 71, 79, 508 S.E.2d 565, 569&nbsp;(1998) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of assumption of risk involves an intelligent and deliberate choice between a course known to be dangerous and what is not dangerous. It involves the taking of a calculated risk. Assumption of risk is a matter of knowledge of a danger and the intelligent acquiescence in it. The doctrine is predicated on the factual situation of a defendantâ€™s acts alone creating the danger and causing the accident, with the plaintiffâ€™s act being that of voluntarily exposing himself to such an obvious danger with appreciation thereof which resulted in the injury. \r\n\r\nSenn v. Sun Printing Co.,&nbsp; 295 S.C. 169, 173, 367 S.E.2d 456, 458&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988).\r\nIn the present case, Cole signed a consent form acknowledging the risks associated with the VBAC procedure.Â  The consent form suggests Cole freely and voluntarily exposed herself and her child to a known danger associated with the VBAC procedure, which she understood and appreciated.Â  However, nothing in the record suggests Cole assumed the risk associated with a delayed C-section delivery of her child following her decision to undergo the VBAC.Â  Cole had no knowledge of the danger posed by a delay between the warning signs and the time the C-section was commenced.Â Â  Moreover, Cole had no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the delay.Â  Without this knowledge, Cole could not appreciate the nature and extent of the danger or voluntarily expose herself and her child to such a danger.Â  As a result, the trial judge erred in charging the jury on assumption of risk.\r\nâ€œThe giving of an erroneous instruction is not reversible error, unless the appellant can show that he was injured and prejudiced thereby.â€Â  Ellison v. Simmons, 238 S.C. 364, 372, 120 S.E.2d 209, 213 (1961).Â Â  In Ellison, the court found the trial judge erred in instructing the jury â€œthat pecuniary loss will be presumed where the beneficiaries of the action for wrongful death are the widow and minor children of the decedent, when it is undisputed that all of the decedentâ€™s children are adults.â€Â  Id. at 370, 120 S.E.2d 209, 212.Â Â  However, the court found the error was not reversible because the appellant failed to show the charge was prejudicial when pecuniary loss was undisputed at trial and the judge also charged the jury on the elements to consider in awarding damages.Â  In so holding, the Ellison court distinguished two cases, Wright v. Harris, 228 S.C. 144, 89 S.E.2d 97 (1955) and Citizens Bank of Darlington v. McDonald, 202 S. C. 244, 24 S.E.2d 369 (1943).\r\nIn Wright, the court stated:\r\n\r\n[I]t is reversible error to charge a correct principle of law as governing a case when such principle is inapplicable to the issues on trial. Conflicting and irrelevant instructions constitute reversible error[;] and a trial Judge ought to take care not to confuse the jury by charging them on legal principles which are inapplicable to the case on trial . . . . \r\n\r\n228 S.C. at 148, 89 S.E.2d at 98 (citations omitted).Â  The Wright court held an erroneous charge on breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act to be reversible error where the causes of action were founded solely in fraud and deceit.Â  The Ellison court analyzed the erroneous charge in Wright, stating â€œ[i]t is readily apparent that such a charge was prejudicial to the appellant.â€ 238 S.C. at 372, 120 S.E.2d at 213.\r\nSimilarly, in Citizens Bank of Darlington, the sole issue for trial was the genuineness of a payeeâ€™s signature on a check.Â  202 S.C. at 250, 24 S.E.2d at 373. The court determined that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on conflicting burdens of proof and erred in charging the jury on estoppel.Â  The court held that it was reversible error for the judge to give conflicting instructions and to instruct on irrelevant issues.Â  Id. at 255, 24 S.E.2d at 375; See also Ellison, 238 S.C. at 372, 120 S.E.2d at 213.\r\nThe principles enunciated in Wright and Citizens Bank of Darlington have been consistently applied by this court and the supreme court.Â  See Miller v. Schmid Labs., Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 142-43, 414 S.E.2d 126, 127&nbsp;(1992) (finding reversible error to charge the correct definition of bilateral contract because the issue was irrelevant to whether an employee handbook could form the basis of a contract between an employer and employee); White v. Fowler, 276 S.C. 370, 372, 278 S.E.2d 777, 778 (1981) (stating that when the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that respondentâ€™s actionable negligence caused the accident, a charge on unavoidable accident was irrelevant and prejudicial); Dunsil v. E.M. Jones Chevrolet Co., 268 S.C. 291, 295, 233 S.E.2d 101, 103 (1977) (finding reversible error when â€œ[t]he instructions by the court of irrelevant and inapplicable principles of law was clearly erroneous and may have been confusing to the juryâ€); Brown v. Howell,&nbsp; 284 S.C. 605, 610, 327 S.E.2d 659, 662&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985) (concluding the trial judgeâ€™s instruction on avoidable accident was prejudicial when the issue was abandoned at trial).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the erroneous charge of assumption of risk was irrelevant and inapplicable to the Colesâ€™ allegations.Â  The evidence demonstrates that while Cole may have assumed the risk for the VBAC procedure, she never assumed the risk for a delayed C-Section delivery, which was the basis of the Colesâ€™ causes of action.Â  The assumption of risk charge had the potential to confuse the jury concerning the underlying factual basis of the Colesâ€™ claims and availed Raut with a defense that was not supported by the evidence.Â  As a result, the Coles were prejudiced by the erroneous charge.\r\nThe Respondents argue that any prejudice occasioned by the erroneous charge is specifically defeated by the â€œtwo issue rule.â€Â  In essence, the Respondents are asserting that the Coles have failed to demonstrate any prejudice because the jury returned a general defense verdict, and we have no way to discern if it decided in favor of Raut on the assumption of risk defense or against the Coles on their negligence claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs explained above, the trial judge instructed the jury on an inapplicable defense to the Colesâ€™ medical negligence claims.Â  Such an error likely confused the jury with respect to the relevant legal principles as well as the underlying facts of the causes of action subject to the inapplicable defense.Â  Thus, because the Colesâ€™ negligence claims were adversely impacted by the erroneous charge, the Colesâ€™ prejudice is not defeated by the â€œtwo issue rule.â€Â  The general defense verdict is not independently supported by the negligence cause of action, and the Coles have no other causes of action to support the general verdict.Â  See Ricks v. Jackson, 159 N.E.2d 225, 227&nbsp;(Oh. 1959) (explaining the two issue rule is used as a means of requiring an affirmative showing of prejudice in order to justify reversal, and finding that despite the two issue rule, an error in charging the jury on contributory negligence was prejudicial and reversible error).Â  \r\nFurthermore, we believe applying the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ under the circumstances of this case presents an â€œunusual applicationâ€ similar to the one that was soundly rejected in Anderson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 419, 472 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1996).Â  In Anderson, the trial judge submitted the issue of general negligence and the defense of contributory negligence to the jury.Â  The jury returned a general verdict in favor of the defendant.Â  After the verdict, the trial court belatedly granted plaintiffâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence.Â  The court noted that it had no way to tell whether the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant due to the plaintiffâ€™s failure to prove negligence or the defendantâ€™s success in proving contributory negligence.Â  As a result, the trial court granted a new trial.Â  The court of appeals reversed, â€œessentially [finding] the trial court erred by not applying the â€˜two issueâ€™ rule to uphold the juryâ€™s verdict.â€Â  Id. at 421, 472 S.E.2d at 255.Â Â  The supreme court declined to adopt â€œthis unusual application of the â€˜two issueâ€™ ruleâ€ for the following three reasons: (1) the rule is utilized by courts on appeal, not trial courts, (2) the rule is a procedural tool for upholding, not reversing decisions, and (3) such an application would discourage trial courts from correcting errors.Â Â  Id. \r\nLike Anderson, applying the rule in this case could very well have the effect of discouraging trial courts from correcting errors.Â  Here, the trial judge had an opportunity to correct the error by granting the Colesâ€™ motion for a new trial.Â  He did not do so, ostensibly because he did not believe his earlier decision to charge assumption of risk was error.Â  However, were we to accept Respondentsâ€™ argument on the â€œtwo issue rule,â€ a trial judge who realizes he or she has made an error during a trial could be inclined not to correct it and to uphold the verdict.Â  Thus, we believe this application of the rule is proscribed by the supreme courtâ€™s Anderson decision.Â  \r\nFurthermore, accepting the Respondentsâ€™ argument to employ the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ to affirm the verdict despite an erroneous charge on the defense of assumption of risk would arguably place a heavy burden on trial lawyers to request a special verdict form in every case.Â  Here, the Colesâ€™ attorney objected at every available opportunity, including post-trial, to what he perceived to be an erroneous charge.Â  It was not necessary to also request a special verdict form in order to preserve this objection.[1]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the defense of assumption of risk, and the Coles were prejudiced by the erroneous jury instruction. As a result, the verdict is hereby reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n HUFF, J., concurs and KITTREDGE, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., dissenting:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the general defense verdict pursuant to the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.\r\nIn my judgment, this is a difficult case, for we are confronted with an apparent tension between the presumption of validity accorded a general verdict in multi-issue casesâ€”and the concomitant viability of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule in South Carolinaâ€”and the principle that an erroneous and prejudicial jury instruction warrants reversal.Â  At bottom, I believe the proper resolution of this appeal turns on the degree of prejudice necessary to merit reversal in the context of an erroneous jury instruction and a general verdict involving two or more issues.Â  The majority, as I do, recognizes that the Appellants might have been prejudiced by the erroneous jury instruction.Â  Where I part company with the majority is their attempt to syllogize from the â€œpotentialâ€ for prejudice to an absolute, affirmative finding of prejudice.Â  I characterize the claim of prejudice to the Appellants as nothing more than speculation.Â  I adhere to the view that more is required to satisfy the prejudice prong.Â  This view, I believe, more closely comports with the foundational principle of appellate procedure that â€œ[a]n error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.â€Â  Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Moreover, such a view maintains the efficacy and even-handed application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule in this state.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe trial court instructed the jury that Marty K. Cole and Tracy S. Cole were entitled to prevail if the jury found Dr. Pratibha P. Raut was negligent â€œin at least one or more of the ways alleged . . . [and that] the defendantsâ€™ negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injuries.â€Â  At the conclusion of the charge on the assumption of risk affirmative defense,[2] the court stated:\r\n\r\nHowever, I charge you, on the other hand, if you find that the plaintiffâ€™s injuries and negligence were the result of the defendantâ€™s negligence, then in such circumstance your verdict would be for the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nDr. Raut urged the trial court to submit a special verdict form â€œwith specific questions for the jury . . . [including whether] plaintiff has proved [the negligence claim] by the greater weight or preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  The trial court denied Dr. Rautâ€™s request for a special verdict form.Â  The Coles did not request a special verdict form, although they were aware that assumption of risk would be charged. \r\nThe jury returned a general defense verdict.Â  \r\nThe Coles sought a new trial on the basis that assumption of risk was erroneously charged.Â  The motion was denied, and judgment was entered for Dr. Raut and her medical practice.Â  The Coles appeal only from the trial courtâ€™s decision to charge the jury on the assumption of risk defense.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWhile I agree with the majority that it was error to charge the jury on the defense of assumption of risk, I would find the general defense verdict is independently supported by the unchallenged submission of the negligence claim to the jury.Â  This principle is generally referred to as the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â  \r\nThe â€œtwo issueâ€ ruleâ€”sometimes referred to as the â€œgeneral verdictâ€ ruleâ€”is based on the principle that reversal is inappropriate where no error is found as to one of the issues that may independently support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  South Carolina is among an apparent minority of states that has adopted the rule.Â  South Carolinaâ€™s first recognition of the rule, as best I can determine, came in 1926 in the case of Hussmann Refrigerator &amp; Supply v. Cash &amp; Carry Grocer, Inc., 134 S.C. 191, 132 S.E. 173 (1926).Â  In Hussmann, the plaintiff filed an action in claim and delivery for possession of a refrigerator.Â  The defendants answered with a general denial and a counterclaim.Â  The jury rendered the following verdict:Â  â€œWe find for the plaintiff possession of the goods.â€Â  Id. at 194, 132 S.E. at 173.Â  The defendants moved for a new trial on â€œthe ground that it did not appear from the verdict that the jury had passed upon [the counterclaim].â€Â  Id.Â  The trial court granted the new trial motion.Â  The supreme court reversed and reinstated the jury verdict.Â  In so holding, the court relied on the principle that later became identified as the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule:\r\n\r\n[W]hen there are several issues in the case submitted to a jury under full instructions, a general verdict in favor of one or the other of the parties, in the absence of objection to\r\nthe verdict not having passed upon the several issues separately, will be held to have concluded all the issues.\r\n\r\nId. at 196, 132 S.E. at 174 (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe Hussmann court further noted that â€œ[t]he defendants had no right to remain silent under the apprehension that the irregularity might be corrected against their interest and afterwards complain of it.â€Â  Id. at 194, 132 S.E. at 174.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Court of Appeals, I believe, properly describes the policy underpinnings of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule:\r\n\r\nThe general verdict rule provides that where a general verdict is returned for one of the parties, and the mental processes of the jury are not tested by special interrogatories to indicate which issue was determinative of the verdict, it will be presumed that all issues were resolved in favor of the prevailing party, and, where a single determinative issue has been presented to the jury free from error, any error in presenting another issue will be disregarded . . . On the appellate level, the rule relieves an appellate court from the necessity of adjudicating claims of error that may not arise from the actual source of the jury verdict that is under appellate review.Â  Therefore, unless an appellant can provide a record to indicate that the result of the trial was a result of the trial errors claimed on appeal, rather than from proper determination of the error-free issues, there is no reason to spend the judicial resources to provide a second trial. \r\n\r\nLahm v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co., 571 N.W.2d 126, 131 (Neb. App. 1997) (internal citations omitted).\r\nOne of the leading South Carolina cases dealing with the â€œtwo issueâ€ ruleâ€”the case cited most frequentlyâ€”is Anderson v. West, 270 S.C. 184, 188, 241 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1978) (â€œ[W]here a jury returns a general verdict involving two or more issues and its verdict is supported as to at least one issue, the verdict will not be reversed.â€).Â  We are confronted here with the submission to the jury of an error-free negligence claim and a challenged jury charge on the affirmative defense of assumption of risk.Â  \r\nI recognize the limited applications of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, for the â€œrule may be applied by appellate courts in a few situations.â€Â  Anderson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 420, 472 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1996).Â  In Anderson, our supreme court addressed and rejected an â€œunusual applicationâ€ of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â  Id. at 421, 472 S.E.2d at 255.Â  Anderson was injured in a fall on a sidewalk, and she sued the South Carolina Department of Highways and Public Transportation on a theory of negligence in maintaining the sidewalk.Â  Anderson moved for a directed verdict as to liability, but the trial court deferred ruling on the motion.Â  The case was submitted â€œto the jury on the issues of general negligence and contributory negligence, and the jury returned a general verdict for Highway Department.â€Â  Id. at 419, 472 S.E.2d at 254.Â  The trial court then granted Andersonâ€™s directed verdict motion, ruling as a matter of law that the Highway Department was negligent in its maintenance of the sidewalk.Â  The trial court granted a new trial since it could not determine â€œwhether the jury reached its verdict for Highway Department on the basis of Andersonâ€™s failure to prove improper maintenance, Andersonâ€™s failure to prove proximate cause, or Highway Departmentâ€™s success in proving contributory negligence.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court reversed the granting of the new trial, finding the jury verdict should have been sustained under the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â \r\nAnderson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 317 S.C. 280, 282, 454 S.E.2d 353, 354-55 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The supreme court granted certiorari and affirmed in result, but rejected the application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â  Anderson provides a thoughtful analysis of the appropriate application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â  Of particular note is the courtâ€™s discussion of the three reasons for rejecting the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule in that case:\r\n\r\nInitially, the rule is utilized by courts on appeal, not trial courts. Secondly, the rule is a procedural tool for upholding, not reversing, decisions. Thirdly, the practical effects of the Court of Appealsâ€™ application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule are undesirable. Such an application would discourage trial courts from correcting errors. Because the juryâ€™s general verdict could potentially be upheld anytime it was susceptible of two or more constructions, there would be no incentive for trial courts to correct errors, such as through the direction of a post-trial verdict.\r\n\r\nAnderson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. at 421, 472 S.E.2d at 255.Â  \r\nIn my judgment, the reasons favoring application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule predominate in the case before us.Â  First, we would be invoking the rule in the context of appellate review.[3]Â  Next, we would be utilizing the rule to uphold the judgment below.Â  And finally, application of the rule under these circumstances should not discourage trial courts from correcting errors.[4]\r\nThis court, subsequent to Anderson, applied the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule in circumstances procedurally similar to those presently before us.Â  In the case of Bryant v. Waste Management, Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 536 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 2000), Bryant asserted six theories of negligence.Â  The jury returned a general verdict for Bryant.Â  The trial court denied the post-trial motions, from which Waste Management appealed.Â  We agreed with Waste Management that â€œthe trial court erred in instructing the jury that a violation of federal Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administrations . . . regulations constitutes negligence per se.â€Â  Id. at 166, 536 S.E.2d at 384.Â  We nevertheless affirmed, and in relying on the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, we noted the speculative nature of Waste Managementâ€™s prejudice argument:\r\n\r\nWaste Management, however, has not shown it was prejudiced by [the erroneous jury instruction] because there existed other bases upon which the jury could find it liableÂ  . . . Because the jury rendered a general verdict and could have relied upon any of these [other] allegations of negligence to find Waste Management liable and because there is ample evidence supporting at least one of these [other] allegations . . . we cannot say Waste Management was prejudiced by the jury charge in issue.\r\n\r\nId. at 167-68, 536 S.E.2d at 384-85. \r\nBryant is merely one case among many holding that an erroneous jury instruction, absent a showing of resulting prejudice, will not warrant reversal.Â  See Sierra v. Skelton, 307 S.C. 217, 225, 414 S.E.2d 169, 174 (Ct. App. 1992) (affirming general verdict under â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, noting that rule applies to â€œa situation where . . . the trial court erred in the jury instructionsâ€); Piedmont Aviation, Inc. v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 502, 505, 366 S.E.2d 31, 32-33 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding where case is submitted to jury on two causes of action and jury returns a general verdict, error by trial court in its instructions on second theory is of no consequence where verdict is supportable under first theory).\r\nI now turn to a related principleâ€”â€œit is reversible error to charge a correct principle of law as governing a case where such principle is inapplicable to the issue on trial.â€Â  Ellison v. Simmons, 238 S.C. 364, 372, 120 S.E.2d 209, 213 (1961).Â  This seems to me the strongest argument of the Coles to receive a new trial.Â  However, this general principle is applied where â€œ[i]t is readily apparent that such a charge was prejudicial to the appellant.â€Â  Id.Â  Perhaps the Coles were prejudiced by the giving of the assumption of risk charge.Â  Neither the majority nor I know for sure.[5]Â  We certainly cannot say it is â€œreadily apparentâ€ the challenged charge was the basis of the jury verdict.Â  This uncertainty brings me back to the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.\r\nThe touchstone of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule is its concern with prejudice.Â  As noted, an appellant must show not only error, but also prejudicial error, to secure reversal of an adverse judgment.Â  The prejudice prong, in the context of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule, is generally established by the mere request at trial for an appropriate special verdict form.Â  See Hussmann, 134 S.C. at 196, 132 S.E. at 174 (noting â€œthe absence of objection to the verdict not having passed upon the several issues separatelyâ€); Smoak v. Liebherr-America, Inc., 281 S.C. 420, 421, 315 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1984) (upholding denial of post-trial motion, and affirming general verdict under â€œtwo issueâ€ rule with court noting that â€œthe record indicates the trial judge asked the respective attorneys for assistance in constructing a special verdict form to submit to the jury, but received noneâ€).Â  Here, the Coles leave to conjecture the claim of prejudice.Â  After the trial court announced its decision to charge assumption of risk, the Coles voiced no complaint with the general verdict form, and remained silent when Dr. Raut was requesting a special verdict form.[6]Â  I would find that the Coles have failed to establish the critical prejudice prong.\r\nThe Coles and the majority cite Ricks v. Jackson, 159 N.E.2d 225 (Ohio 1959) for the proposition that prejudice is presumed and the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule does not apply when there was a charge on an issue upon which the jury should not have been charged.Â  The Ohio Supreme Court has since retreated from a strict application of the holding in Ricks.Â  That court has since twice applied the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule to uphold general verdicts where appellants failed to establish prejudice in connection with erroneous jury instructions.Â  Hampel v. Food Ingredients Specialties, Inc., 729 N.E.2d 726, 739 (Ohio 2000) (applying â€œtwo issueâ€ rule to affirm general verdict and noting that Ricks does not set forth a rule of mandatory reversal where a charge is erroneously given); Wagner v. Roche Labs., 709 N.E.2d 162, 166 (Ohio 1999) (applying â€œtwo issueâ€ rule to uphold a general verdict and finding an insufficient showing of prejudice, noting that the defendant â€œfailed to request interrogatories that might have explained the juryâ€™s general verdictâ€).\r\nA general verdict is presumptively valid.Â  See Gold Kist, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; Southern Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 286 S.C. 272, 282, 333 S.E.2d 67, 73 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œThe appellate courts of this State exercise every reasonable presumption in favor of the validity of a general verdict.â€).Â  The Coles concede the negligence claim involved disputed issues of fact and was properly submitted to the jury.Â  The general defense verdict may therefore be sustained on the negligence claim, notwithstanding the erroneous assumption of risk instruction.Â  \r\nI do agree with the majority that application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule places a burden on trial lawyers.Â  I would go further by acknowledging that most of the issue preservation rules are burdensome on trial practitioners.Â  Those rules, however, are designed to encourage precision and clarity of issues.Â  I do not view the burden here as onerous. The request for a special verdict form is not uncommon in our stateâ€™s trial courts, as Dr. Rautâ€™s request illustrates.Â  And finally, with the majorityâ€™s concern for the burden of requesting a special verdict form, we have introduced a new consideration.Â  The â€œtwo issueâ€ rule has served plaintiffs quite well in sustaining general verdicts without the slightest concern for the burden on defendants to request special verdict forms.Â  I believe the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule sustains the general defense verdict here.Â  \r\n CONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, I accord the general verdict here a presumption of validity and find this appeal presents a proper application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule. The inability of the Coles to establish prejudice resulting from the erroneous jury instruction is the cornerstone of my view of the case.Â  Since I believe the general defense verdict may be sustained on the negligence cause of action, I would affirm.\r\n\r\n[1] Although we do not believe a special verdict form was necessary to preserve the Colesâ€™ objection to the charge on assumption of risk, we note that Raut had already requested a special verdict form, which was specifically rejected by the trial judge. Â To say that the Coles needed to also request a special verdict form to protect their objection to the jury instruction would be to require an exercise in futility.Â Â  This court does not require parties to engage in futile actions in order to protect their interests on appellate review.Â  See generally Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 415, 529 S.E.2d 543, 547 (2000); Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, 426 S.E.2d 756; Carter v. Peace, 229 S.C. 346, 93 S.E.2d 113 (1956).Â  \r\n[2] The doctrine of assumption of risk was largely subsumed by the law of comparative negligence in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998).Â  However, the cause of action in the present case arose in February 1997, prior to Davenport.\r\n[3] This factorâ€”invoking the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule only at the appellate levelâ€”illustrates the undesirable consequences of this courtâ€™s short-lived holding in Anderson.Â  This court in Anderson essentially mandated that a trial court apply the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule to sustain a general verdict even if the trial court found error in its own rulings.Â  This courtâ€™s ruling in Anderson was nothing short of a direct intrusion on a trial courtâ€™s ability to alter, amend or set aside a verdict or judgment.Â  In the case before us, application of the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule constitutes no such intrusion.Â  \r\n[4] The majority advances the argument that the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule will discourage trial courts from correcting errors.Â  This argument is premised on the notion that the â€œtrial judge had an opportunity to correct the error by granting the Colesâ€™ motion for a new trial . . . [and] [h]e did not do so, ostensibly becauseâ€ he believed his ruling to be the correct one.Â  I find nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court somehow realized its error.Â  Absent evidence to the contrary, I believe we must assume that a trial judge makes a ruling because he or she believes the ruling is the correct one.Â  The trial court in Anderson, for example, granted a new trial and did not seek cover behind the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â  I believe our fine trial judges are entitled to the presumption that their rulingsâ€”even if determined to be in errorâ€”are the result of a well-intentioned desire to render correct rulings.Â Â  \r\n[5] \r\nThe uncertainty concerning prejudice is, in my judgment, the critical feature in the proper resolution of this appeal.Â  The majority and I agree that the Coles might have been prejudiced.Â  As stated at the outset, I part company with the majority in their leap from the â€œpotentialâ€ for prejudice to an absolute, affirmative finding of prejudice.Â  The bottom line is that we do not know whether the Coles were prejudiced by the erroneous jury instruction.Â  If the possibility of prejudice arising from an erroneous jury instruction is sufficient to warrant reversal, the majority reaches the correct result.Â Â Â  \r\n[6]\r\nThe Coles, to their credit, make no attempt to bootstrap Dr. Rautâ€™s request for a special verdict form to their advantage.Â  See Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 324, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997) (stating an appellant may not preserve an issue for appeal by way of another partyâ€™s objection or challenge).Â  The majority seeks to avoid this principleâ€”and give the Coles a passâ€”on the basis that a similar motion by the Coles would have been â€œan exercise in futility.â€Â  We do not know what the trial court would have done if the Coles had also requested a special verdict form.Â  Perhaps a request for a special verdict form from both parties would have swayed the trial court to grant the requests.Â  That, of course, is speculation, but I submit it is equally as valid as the majorityâ€™s guesswork. Â My preference is to avoid speculation and apply the rule that one party may not bootstrap or benefit from another partyâ€™s objection or challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
