Wilson, Jr., of Greenville, for appellants.\r\n\r\nRobert L. Widener  and Benjamin E. Nicholson, V, both of McNair Law Firm, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Nan Mayer, Cindy Coleman, and Joe Holland appeal the trial court's order granting summary judgment to M. S.\r\nBailey &amp; Son, Bankers.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970s, Joe S. Holland (\"Mr. Holland\") established his estate plan through the creation of the Joe S. Holland Family\r\nTrust and the corresponding execution of his last will and testament.  Mr. Holland's estate plan included three trusts, Trust A, the\r\nInsurance Trust, and Trust B, for which M. S. Bailey &amp; Son, Bankers (\"Bankers\") was named trustee. (1)  Trust A and the Insurance\r\nTrust were designed to pay Mrs. Holland all the income and, in the trustee's discretion, any principal from the trusts necessary for\r\nher \"medical care, comfortable maintenance, and welfare\" during her lifetime. Upon Mrs. Holland's death, subject to her exercising\r\na power of appointment, the remaining principal was to pass to Mr. Holland's three children, the Appellants.  Mr. Holland died on\r\nNovember 13, 1988, and was survived by his wife and three children. Trust A had initial assets of $4,432.88 and the Insurance\r\nTrust had initial contributions of $126,873.86. (2)      \r\n\r\nSometime prior to 1993, Nan Mayer contacted an attorney and the Laurens County Probate Judge regarding the perceived waste\r\nof trust assets in the form of distributions to her alcoholic mother.  Appellants, however, took no further action to complain of waste\r\nor the management of the trusts at that time. \r\n\r\nDuring its tenure as trustee, Bankers sent Mrs. Holland and Appellants quarterly and year end statements. (3) Appellants do not\r\ndispute that these statements were forwarded to them.  The trial judge found:\r\n\r\n\r\nEach statement received by the [Appellants] detailed the status of each Trust of \"Income Cash\" and \"Principal Cash.\"  Each\r\nwithdrawal from each trust account was also outlined in the statements.  The final statement sent to [Appellants] for Trust A is dated\r\nJanuary 31, 1994 and reflects under the \"Review of Assets\" section a zero balance for \"Total Cash\" and \"Grand Total,\" a \"Total\r\nMarket Value\" of zero, \"Income Cash\" of zero, and \"Principal Cash\" of zero.  This account was closed by [Bankers] and therefore\r\nthis trust terminated on January 10, 1994.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the Insurance Trust account's final statement dated September 30, 1993 reflects a zero balance of Total Cash, Grand\r\nTotal, and Total Market Value.  It shows zero for the Ending Balance of Income Cash and Principal Cash.  This account was\r\nclosed by [Bankers] and this trust terminated on September 15, 1993.   \r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1995, Nan Mayer sent a letter to Bankers inquiring about the status of the trust accounts.  By letter of November\r\n27, 1995, Bankers responded: (4)\r\n\r\n\r\nI regret the delay in responding to your letter of November 5, 1995.  However, as you might recall, three different trusts were\r\nbrought into being by your father's death, and it has taken this length of time to retrieve the data on each of these from our archives. \r\nIn the will of Mr. Holland, two trusts designated Trust \"A\" and Trust \"B\" were established.  Trust \"A\" was for the benefit of Mrs.\r\nHolland and Trust \"B\" was for the benefit of Mr. Holland's mother.  Trust \"B\" was to be distributed to you and your brother and\r\nsister at the death of your grandmother.  This Trust \"B\" was distributed in this manner and closed October 31, 1991.  There was a\r\nthird trust that became operational at the death of Mr. Holland called an Insurance Trust.  Both Trust \"A\" and the Insurance Trust\r\nhad as their terms that you and your brother and sister were to receive any principal remaining in these trusts at the death of your\r\nmother, if she had not directed any different distribution by her last will.  The terms, however, further stipulated that the principal of\r\nboth of these trusts could be used for your \"mother's medical care, comfortable maintenance, and welfare\".  During the period after\r\nyour father's death, your mother's expenses amounted to more than the income available to her and income from both trusts had to\r\nbe supplemented by distributions from the principal of both trusts in the manner prescribed in the legal documents setting up the\r\ntrusts initially.  This resulted, over time, in the depletion of all of the assets in these trusts.\r\n\r\nTrust \"A\" established under the will of Mr. Holland was closed January 10, 1994, and the Insurance Trust was closed September\r\n15, 1993.  I have enclosed a copy of the final report of each of these trusts which reflect their final expenditures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Holland died February 28, 1997. Thereafter, in February 1998, Appellants filed a complaint against Bankers in the court of\r\ncommon pleas.  This action was eventually dismissed without prejudice in October of 1999 for lack of jurisdiction.\r\nAppellants next\r\nfiled the same complaint in the probate court on November 5, 1999, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract in\r\nimplementing the trusts and estate plan; (2) breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act as to Appellants as third-party\r\nbeneficiaries of the trusts; (3) breach of fiduciary duty to the Appellants as third-party beneficiaries; and (4) violation of the South\r\nCarolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. (5)\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1999, Bankers filed a motion for summary judgment asserting as a complete defense to Appellants' complaint\r\nthe statutes of limitation in Title 62 and Title 15 of the South Carolina Code. The trial judge granted summary judgment for Bankers\r\non all causes of action. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.\" George \r\n  v. Fabri, ___ S.C. ___, 548 S.E.2d 868,874 (2001) (citing Bankers Trust of S.C. \r\n  v. Benson, 267 S.C. 152, 155, 226 S.E.2d 703, 704 (1976)). Even if there is \r\n  no dispute as to evidentiary facts, summary judgment is not appropriate where \r\n  there is a dispute as to a conclusion to be drawn from those facts and to clarify \r\n  the application of the law. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, \r\n  487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997). However, summary judgment is appropriate when it \r\n  is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is \r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Mosteller v. County \r\n  of Lexington, 336 S.C. 360, 362, 520 S.E.2d 620, 621 (1999). In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, \r\n  the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998). \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nAppellants contend that in their action the general \r\n  statute of limitations under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2000) is preempted \r\n  by the Probate Code statute of limitations. We agree that actions concerning \r\n  the administration of trust accounts fall squarely within the Probate Code statute \r\n  of limitations. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(3) (Supp. 2000). Appellants \r\n  further argue their action was timely filed because, as contingent remaindermen \r\n  of the trust accounts, they did not have a justiciable interest, and thus no \r\n  standing to initiate a suit against Bankers until their interests became fully \r\n  vested upon the death of Mrs. Holland, the life tenant of the trusts. We disagree. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe probate court, \"except as otherwise specifically \r\n  provided. . . has exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related \r\n  to. . . trusts, inter vivos or testamentary, including the appointment of successor \r\n  trustees.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(3) (Supp. 2000). Further, the probate \r\n  court \"has exclusive original jurisdiction of proceedings initiated by interested \r\n  parties concerning the internal affairs of trusts . . . . administration and \r\n  distribution of trust, the declaration of rights, and the determination of other \r\n  matters involving trustees and beneficiaries of trusts. . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 62-7-201(a) (Supp. 2000) (emphasis added). Under the code, an \"'interested \r\n  person' includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, \r\n  and any others having a property right in or claim against a trust estate. . \r\n  . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(20) (1987). A \"'beneficiary,' as it relates to \r\n  trust beneficiaries, includes a person who has any present or future interest, \r\n  vested or contingent . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(2) (1987) (emphasis added). \r\n  Inasmuch as the Probate Code affords contingent remaindermen standing to pursue \r\n  actions involving \"alleged misconduct of a fiduciary, in connection with the \r\n  creation, administration and depletion of trusts,\" we hold that as a minimum \r\n  the Appellants had both standing and justiciable rights that a court of equity \r\n  could protect. &nbsp;&nbsp;See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-7-201(a), 62-1-201(2) &amp; \r\n  (20) (1987 and Supp. 2000). \r\n\r\nThe administration of trust accounts is controlled \r\n  by Article 7 of the Probate Code. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-7-101 through -709 \r\n  (1987 &amp; Supp. 2000). The code establishes either a one or three year statute \r\n  of limitations, depending on the extent of disclosure, within which a beneficiary \r\n  is required to initiate a lawsuit against the trustee for mismanagement of the \r\n  trust accounts:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent, \r\n    or limitation, any claim against a trustee for breach of trust is barred as \r\n    to any beneficiary who has received a final account or other statement fully \r\n    disclosing the matter and showing termination of the trust relationship between \r\n    the trustee and the beneficiary unless a proceeding to assert the claim is \r\n    commenced within one year after receipt of the final account or statement. \r\n    In any event and notwithstanding lack of full disclosure a trustee who has \r\n    issued a final account or statement received by the beneficiary and has informed \r\n    the beneficiary of the location and availability of records for his examination \r\n    is protected after three years. A beneficiary is deemed to have received a \r\n    final account or statement if, being an adult, it is received by him personally. \r\n    . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-307 (1987) (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nHere, Appellants received a final accounting stating the Insurance Trust was valued at zero and that Bankers considered the trust\r\nrelationship terminated by letter dated September 30, 1993.  Likewise, Appellants received a final accounting and termination\r\nstatement concerning Trust A by letter dated January 31, 1994.  Appellants do not claim they never received these notices; rather,\r\nthey argue the documents were insufficient to commence the one year statute of limitations period.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the trial judge's description of these \r\n  documents, the quarterly and year-end statements \"detailed the status of each \r\n  Trust\" and the final statements showed the balance as zero. Generally, a trust \r\n  can only exist if it has a beneficiary and it is funded. Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Trusts Â§ 66 (1959). Although a trust does not terminate or lapse merely by \r\n  reason of the alleged misconduct or violation of the trust by the trustee, see \r\n  Johnson v. Thornton, 264 S.C. 252, 259, 214 S.E.2d 124, 128 (1975), clearly \r\n  a trust is deemed terminated for the purpose of calculating the limitations \r\n  period when the trust is depleted. Therefore, the limitations period for Appellants' \r\n  action alleging mismanagement of the trust accounts accrued no later than one \r\n  year after their receipt of the final accountings of the trusts. Appellants, \r\n  however, failed to commence their action until November 4, 1999.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Appellants failed to timely file their action after the receipt of the letter from Bankers in November 1995.  This letter\r\nclearly satisfies both the one year and three year contingencies under the Probate Code.  It explained the depletion of the accounts\r\nand that Mrs. Holland's expenses were more than the income of the trusts, thus necessitating an invasion of the principal.  This letter\r\nexpressed the Bank's contrition for its delay after receipt of Nan Mayer's letter of inquiry because the necessary documents had to\r\nbe retrieved from the archives.  Thus, by the November letter, Appellants were given a final accounting of the trusts, and\r\ninferentially informed of the availability and location of the trust records for review.  Under this provision, Appellants were required\r\nto initiate their action no later than the end of November 1998.  Nevertheless, they did not file their action in the probate court until\r\nNovember 4, 1999.  Therefore, their action was not timely filed.    \r\n\r\nThe Appellants also argue that under the common law of South Carolina, the Statute of Limitations did not begin to run against them\r\nas remaindermen until the death of their mother, inasmuch as they did not possess a justiciable right until that time.  They assert that\r\n\"the gravamen of the causes of action asserted by [them] is founded upon the Bank's alleged misconduct as a fiduciary, in\r\nconnection with the creation, administration, and depletion of trusts.\"  They then argue that the Probate Code provides the exclusive\r\nremedy for resolving such disputes.  Having conceded the Probate Code governs this action, they may not now argue the non-expiration of the general statute of limitations under the common law.  Moreover, and in any event, upon the death of their mother,\r\nthe Appellants were no longer contingent remaindermen.  We have been furnished no reason why the one year statute of limitations\r\nin the Probate Code did not run prior to the institution of Appellants' lawsuit.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to Appellants' causes of action for \r\n  breach of contract and unfair trade practices, the trial court implicitly dismissed \r\n  them when it granted summary judgment and there has been no appeal from the \r\n  trial court's order based on that dismissal. See First Union National Bank of \r\n  S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"Failure \r\n  to challenge the ruling is an abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration \r\n  on appeal. The unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and \r\n  requires affirmance.&quot;)\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the order of the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur.  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1.  Only Trust A and the Insurance Trust are subjects of this action, Trust B being satisfactorily distributed to Appellants in 1991.  \r\n2.  The trial judge considered these trusts together, finding \"[a]lthough [Appellants'] Complaint [filed November 5, 1999] references\r\nonly one trust, it appears that they consider Trust A and the Insurance Trust jointly as one.\"\r\n3.  These statements are not included in the record.  Instead, the information regarding these statements comes from the trial court's\r\norder granting summary judgment.\r\n4.   The letter is not included in the record on appeal. The text, republished in full, is from the trial judge's order.\r\n5.  S.C. Code Ann.

Young, Sr. and Eric L. Young, Jr. (the Youngs). We \r\n  reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThis case arose from a car accident between Harvey L. Cooler and the Youngs.  Allstate Insurance\r\nCompany (Allstate) provided primary liability coverage for Cooler, and Farm Bureau provided the\r\nYoungs' underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage.\r\n\r\nCooler's counsel indicated to Farm Bureau in written \r\n  correspondence and answers to interrogatories that Cooler's applicable policy \r\n  limits were $15,000/$30,000. The Youngs' attorney also informed Farm Bureau's \r\n  attorney that Cooler's applicable policy limits were $15,000/$30,000, and that \r\n  the case could be settled for the Youngs' policy limits because Cooler's liability \r\n  limits were significantly lower than the Youngs' damages.\r\n\r\nOn the day before trial, Farm Bureau's attorney \r\n  informed the Youngs' attorney that Farm Bureau would pay $7,000 for Eric Young, \r\n  Jr.'s claim and $8,000 for Eric Young, Sr.'s claim ($15,000 total). His letter \r\n  stated \"this would be paid regardless of the outcome of your settlement negotiations \r\n  or trial\" and further stated that he would order the drafts and prepare a UIM \r\n  release. No evidence in the record indicates that the Youngs' counsel accepted \r\n  any perceived offer made by Farm Bureau.\r\n\r\nLater that afternoon, Cooler's attorney discovered \r\n  he was mistaken and that Allstate's coverage limits were $50,000/$100,000 instead \r\n  of $15,000/$30,000. He informed Farm Bureau's attorney of the mistake, who then \r\n  contacted the Youngs' attorney and verbally withdrew the $15,000 offer. On the \r\n  morning of trial, he sent a fax indicating that Farm Bureau withdrew its offer \r\n  because he was \"misinformed and did not have the correct facts\" regarding Allstate's \r\n  coverage limits.\r\n\r\nThe case proceeded to trial resulting in a jury \r\n  verdict of $20,000 for Eric Young, Sr. and $15,000 for Eric Young, Jr. The trial \r\n  judge subsequently granted the Youngs' motion to enforce the alleged settlement \r\n  between themselves and Farm Bureau. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFarm Bureau argues the trial judge erred in enforcing \r\n  the alleged settlement agreement. We agree.\r\n\r\nAn agreement between counsel affecting the proceedings \r\n  in an action is not binding unless a consent order or written stipulation is \r\n  signed by counsel and entered in the record or the agreement is made in open \r\n  court and noted for the record. Rule 43(k), SCRCP. This rule applies to settlement \r\n  agreements. Ashfort Corp. v. Palmetto Constr. Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 494, \r\n  458 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1995). In Ashfort, the court held that the purpose of rules \r\n  like Rule 43(k) is to prevent disputes concerning the existence and terms of \r\n  agreements and to relieve the court of the necessity of determining such disputes. \r\n  Id. at 495, 458 S.E.2d at 535 (quoting 83 C.J.S. Stipulations Â§ 4 (1953)); see \r\n  also Reed v. Associated Investors of Edisto Island, Inc., 339 S.C. 148, 152, \r\n  528 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nThe requirements of Rule 43(k) were not met here. \r\n  The record contains no evidence of a consent order, written stipulation, or \r\n  agreement made in open court and noted on the record.\r\n\r\nThe Youngs argue that the letter from Farm Bureau's \r\n  attorney confirmed the settlement and how it would be executed. We disagree. \r\n  The letter is more in the nature of an offer or preliminary settlement negotiations \r\n  than an agreement. In it, Farm Bureau's attorney said that he had been able \r\n  to convince his client to pay $7,000 for Eric Young, Sr. and $8,000 for Eric \r\n  Young, Jr. Furthermore, he indicated he would \"go ahead and order the drafts \r\n  and prepare a UIM release.\" This language indicates that the letter was not \r\n  intended to be the final written documentation of any agreement, but instead \r\n  that further paperwork was needed to finalize an agreement.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge's order references the Youngs' \r\n  intent to enforce the agreement pursuant to 43(k) and that they intended to \r\n  be bound regardless of the trial outcome. However, even if the Youngs intended \r\n  to be bound and attempted to announce to the court that a settlement had been \r\n  reached, the requirements of 43(k) were not met. In Widewater Square Associates \r\n  v. Opening Break of America, Inc., 319 S.C. 243, 344, 460 S.E.2d 396, 396 (1995), \r\n  the parties told the judge they reached a settlement and the judge signed a \r\n  form order indicating a settlement had been reached. On appeal, the court held, \r\n  \"Even if we were to find that the form order at issue here reflected a settlement, \r\n  such settlement would not be enforceable since it is neither admitted by respondents \r\n  nor has it been executed.\" Id. at 245, 460 S.E.2d at 397. Here, Farm Bureau \r\n  objected to the Youngs' motion to enforce the purported settlement. Thus, the \r\n  trial judge erred in granting the motion.\r\n\r\nWe need not reach the question of whether the agreement \r\n  is subject to rescission based on mutual mistake because we do not find an enforceable \r\n  agreement. Contracts may be rescinded based upon mutual mistake of fact upon \r\n  which the contract is based. Truck South, Inc. v. Patel, 339 S.C. 40, 50, 528 \r\n  S.E.2d 424, 429 (2000). The mistake must be common to both parties and cause \r\n  each to do what neither intended. Id.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, there was a mutual mistake \r\n  because both parties believed the primary carrier had limits of $15,000/$30,000. \r\n  The trial judge found in his order that \"all parties were laboring under the \r\n  mistaken belief that the Defendant's primary coverage was only $15,000/$30,000.\" \r\n  Furthermore, both parties acted based on these limits. The Youngs' attorney \r\n  indicated this in a letter to Farm Bureau's attorney stating: \"[t]aking into \r\n  consideration that the liability policy limit is so low, the above-referenced \r\n  case can be settled with the Youngs' underinsurance carrier for the Young's \r\n  policy limit.\" Moreover, the UIM carrier's withdrawal of its offer on learning \r\n  the correct policy limits shows it based its offer on the incorrect information. \r\n  Thus, if an agreement had existed, we believe it would have been subject to \r\n  recission.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's enforcement of the \r\n  settlement agreement is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3401","title":"Eubank v.

We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties divorced on November 12, 1991. In its \r\n  decree, the family court approved and adopted the parties' separation agreement, \r\n  including the following language:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he Wife's present support needs are $1,100 \r\n    per month from the Husband. . . .[T]he parties agree that for six years following \r\n    the entering into of this agreement, the Wife's alimony shall be paid by the \r\n    Husband's assignment of his one-half interest in two notes payable to the \r\n    parties from Precision Tune. . . . Beginning January 1, 1998, if the wife \r\n    is still living and has not remarried the Husband shall resume the direct \r\n    payment to the Wife of alimony in the amount of $1,100 per month. . . . The \r\n    parties further agree that should Precision Tune ever default on its payment \r\n    of these notes or due to any other change of circumstances, either party may \r\n    petition the Court for modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nPrecision Tune made payments on the notes for approximately \r\n  eighteen months and then defaulted in April 1993. Wife contacted Husband about \r\n  the default, and he discovered the franchise was bankrupt. Wife then filed a \r\n  \"Motion for Clarification of Terms of Spousal Support in Final Order and Decree \r\n  of Divorce.\" In her motion and supporting affidavit, Wife alleged she had not \r\n  received support payments since the default and asked the family court to order \r\n  Husband to pay her $1,100 per month in alimony.\r\n\r\nIn December 1995, the family court heard Wife's \r\n  motion. Neither party attended the hearing, but both were represented by counsel. \r\n  The family court issued an Amended Temporary Order on April 11, 1996, providing \r\n  in its entirety as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This matter came before me on post trial motion. \r\n    Attorneys for the parties presented an agreement when the case was called. \r\n    I have reviewed the agreement and find it fair to all involved.\r\n\r\n  It is, therefore,\r\n\r\n  Ordered that beginning January 1, 1996, the [Husband] \r\n    shall pay the [Wife] the sum of $600.00 per month in spousal support on the \r\n    first of each month. This sum shall be paid without prejudice to either parties \r\n    [sic]. It is further\r\n\r\n  Ordered that the parties shall attempt to negotiate \r\n    a settlement of all of the issues which need resolution within thirty days \r\n    of the issuance of this order. If an agreement is not reached within that \r\n    time period, either party may, by summons and complaint, initiate an action \r\n    to resolve all remaining issues, including but not limited to, the issue of \r\n    how much, if any, spousal support is past due to [Wife].\r\n\r\n  This Amended Order issues because of a clerical \r\n    error in the prior Temporary Order.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Wife commenced this action seeking an \r\n  order holding Husband in contempt for failure to make alimony payments and an \r\n  award of attorney fees and costs. (1) \r\n   Husband answered and counterclaimed for a reduction or termination \r\n  of his alimony obligation, prospectively and retrospectively, based on changed \r\n  circumstances. Specifically, Husband asserts he is entitled to relief from his \r\n  alimony obligation due to substantial inheritances received by Wife after the \r\n  Final Order and Amended Temporary order were issued and his own diminished financial \r\n  circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe family court found Husband in contempt for \r\n  failure to pay alimony, established his alimony arrearage at $18,277.24, and \r\n  awarded Wife $5,000 in attorney fees and costs. The family court further found \r\n  husband's alimony obligation to be $600 per month as set in the Amended Temporary \r\n  Order and declined to modify or terminate this amount. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may \r\n  find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  The question of whether to increase or decrease support due to changed circumstances \r\n  is within the sound discretion of the family court and such conclusions will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Brunner v. Brunner, \r\n  296 S.C. 60, 64, 370 S.E.2d 614, 617 (Ct. App. 1988). \"An abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded \r\n  in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.\" Clark v. Cantrell, \r\n  339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000). \r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in concluding \r\n  that a downward modification or termination of his alimony obligation is unwarranted. \r\n  We agree. \r\n\r\nAn award of periodic alimony may be modified pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code Annotated section 20-3-170 (1985). That statute provides: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Whenever [a spouse] . . . has been required to \r\n    make his or her spouse any periodic payments of alimony and the circumstances \r\n    of the parties or the financial ability of the spouse making the periodic \r\n    payments shall have changed since the rendition of such judgment, either party \r\n    may apply to the court which rendered the judgment for an order and judgment \r\n    decreasing or increasing the amount of such alimony payments or terminating \r\n    such payments. . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo justify modification or termination of an alimony \r\n  award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material. Thornton \r\n  v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997). \r\n\r\nHere, Wife's net worth greatly exceeded Husband's \r\n  at the time of the final hearing due to post-divorce inheritances. On the deaths \r\n  of her mother in 1994 and her aunt in 1996, Wife received substantial assets. \r\n  Wife testified she received a $100,000 distribution from her mother's estate \r\n  \"within a month or so after her death.\" Later, Wife received additional disbursements, \r\n  including a $350,000 distribution from her aunt's estate in 1996. The parties \r\n  stipulated that Wife's estimated net worth at the time of trial was approximately \r\n  $1.3 million, including: (1) a home with an estimated fair market value of $700,000; \r\n  (2) securities valued at $329,800; (3) \"other property\" valued at $163,000; \r\n  and (4) $61,000 in savings. According to her financial declaration, Wife receives \r\n  an average monthly income ranging from $2,196.78 to $2,496.00 in dividends and \r\n  interest and rents of $300. At the time of trial, Husband's assets totaled approximately \r\n  $13,500, and he earned an annual income of $60,000. \r\n\r\nIn determining Wife's post-divorce inheritances \r\n  did not entitle Husband to a reduction or termination of his alimony obligation, \r\n  the family court reasoned that at the time of the Amended Temporary Order, \"[Wife] \r\n  had already received the substantial real property she now owns and had already \r\n  received personal property in cash from her mother. Husband was aware at the \r\n  time of the 1996 agreement of the majority of the substantial inheritance now \r\n  possessed by [Wife].\" \r\n\r\nOur own review of the record and applicable case \r\n  law convinces us the family court erred in limiting its consideration of changed \r\n  circumstances to events occurring after 1996. (2) \r\n  The Amended Temporary Order was simply that, a temporary agreement reached in \r\n  contemplation of further negotiations and/or judicial proceedings. Because the \r\n  parties did not intend for the 1996 order to serve as a final adjudication of \r\n  their rights and responsibilities, we hold the family court erred in treating \r\n  it as such for purposes of determining whether Husband was entitled to modification \r\n  or termination of his support obligation. We believe the family court should \r\n  have considered changes in the parties' circumstances occurring after the 1991 \r\n  divorce decree.\r\n\r\nWife argues Husband is not entitled to a reduction \r\n  or termination of his alimony obligation because he knew that her family had \r\n  substantial assets and she would eventually receive an inheritance. We disagree. \r\n  \"Generally, changes in circumstances within the contemplation of the parties \r\n  at the time the decree was entered do not provide a basis for modifying either \r\n  an alimony allowance or a child support award.\" Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. \r\n  130, 139, 336 S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App. 1985). However, in applying this general \r\n  rule, the family court should look not only at whether the parties contemplated \r\n  the change, but also \"most importantly whether the amount of alimony in the \r\n  original decree reflects the expectation of that future occurrence.\" Sharps \r\n  v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 78, 535 S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000).\r\n\r\nHere, even if Husband knew before the parties' divorce that Wife would likely receive an\r\ninheritance on the deaths of her mother and aunt, the parties could not have ascertained the amount\r\nof Wife's inheritances or when she would receive them.  The parties' settlement agreement as\r\napproved by the family court clearly states that the alimony award is modifiable.  The only mention\r\nof family property is contained in a separate paragraph in which the parties waive all interest in\r\n\"trusts established by each parties' [sic] family.\"  Here, Husband has never claimed an interest in\r\nWife's family trusts, but has rather asserted that Wife's inheritance has resulted in a change of\r\ncircumstances sufficient to merit a reconsideration of her alimony award.  Accordingly, we find that\r\nthe original decree does not reflect the expectation of Wife's inheritance and that the family court\r\nshould have considered it in making his determination on Husband's counterclaim for reduction or\r\ntermination of alimony.  \r\n\r\nWe further agree with Husband that the family court erred in finding sua sponte that Husband was\r\nnot entitled to a modification of his alimony obligation due to the doctrine of unclean hands. (3)  The\r\nfamily court found that although Husband's income had decreased, Husband changed jobs several\r\ntimes, remarried, and could invest $433.33 per month into his retirement account.  Based on these\r\nfindings, the family court concluded Husband's precarious financial status was due to his own\r\nactions and \"[i]t would be inequitable to grant [modification of Husband's alimony obligation]\r\ninasmuch as [Husband] comes before the court with unclean hands.\"\r\n\r\nIn our view, this finding is dicta and not \r\n  an additional sustaining ground for the court's decision as urged by Wife. Moreover, \r\n  we find the family court's legal reasoning unsound on this issue. The relevant \r\n  inquiry before the court was whether there had been a material change in either \r\n  party's financial circumstances. Even if Husband's own actions or inactions \r\n  resulted in his financial misfortune, section 20-3-170 requires consideration \r\n  of changes in both parties' economic circumstances. Thus, the family court was \r\n  statutorily obliged to consider Wife's changed circumstances as well. Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse and remand this matter for the family court to determine any modification \r\n  or termination of Husband's alimony obligation.  \r\n   (4)  \r\n\r\nFinally, Husband asserts the family court erred \r\n  in failing to award him attorney fees and costs on his counterclaim. \r\n  (5) In light of our disposition on the alimony issue, we remand this \r\n  issue for reconsideration. See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d \r\n  665, 666 (1993) (reversing and remanding issue of attorney fees for reconsideration \r\n  where the substantive results achieved by trial counsel were reversed on appeal). \r\n  (6)\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, we reverse the family court's order and remand the case for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1.   \r\n  Wife also alleged husband failed to make court ordered child support payments; \r\n  however, the court's ultimate decision regarding Husband's child support arrearage \r\n  and prospective obligation is not at issue in this appeal.\r\n2.   \r\n  Wife asserts Husband failed to properly preserve this issue through a post-trial \r\n  motion made pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP. We disagree. Both parties entered \r\n  evidence at trial, without objection, regarding their respective financial circumstances \r\n  both before and after the 1996 order, and the family court made specific findings \r\n  regarding the effect of the order on the viability of Husband's counterclaim. \r\n  Thus, the issue was raised to and ruled on by the family court. The \"raised \r\n  to and ruled on\" rule of error preservation requires only a ruling, not necessarily \r\n  a favorable one. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, \r\n  734 (1998) (\"Post-trial motions are not necessary to preserve issues that have \r\n  been ruled upon at trial; they are used to preserve those that have been raised \r\n  to the trial court but not yet ruled upon by it.\").\r\n\r\nWife further asserts the issue is not properly \r\n  presented on appeal because it is not set forth in the statement of the issues \r\n  on appeal. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no point will be considered \r\n  which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.\"). Husband's \r\n  statement of the issues on appeal includes the following language, \"Wife's Inheritance \r\n  of Over One Million Dollars Constituted A Substantial and Material Change of \r\n  Circumstances Warranting The Termination Of Husband's Alimony Obligation.\" We \r\n  hold this statement when read in conjunction with Husband's argument adequately \r\n  raised the issue. \r\n3.    \r\n  Wife at no point raised this equitable defense. \r\n 4.   \r\n  Husband also asserts the family court should have considered Wife's earning \r\n  capacity as a licensed professional counselor in determining her need for continued \r\n  support. Because we find the family court erred in failing to modify or terminate \r\n  Husband's support obligation, we need not address whether this particular factor \r\n  compounded the error. On remand, the family court should consider Wife's earning \r\n  capacity in assessing the parties' changed circumstances. \r\n5.   \r\n  With respect to Wife's contention this argument is not preserved, we find Husband \r\n  raised this issue in his answer and at the hearing and the trial judge ruled \r\n  against him. Thus, no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was necessary to preserve the \r\n  issue. \r\n6.    \r\n  The award of attorney fees to Wife in the contempt action was not appealed. \r\n  It is therefore the law of the case and must be affirmed. See Buckner v. Preferred \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (holding an unchallenged \r\n  ruling right or wrong is the law of the case and requires affirmance). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3402","title":"State v.

Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:  Donald Ray Wimbush was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of possession of a weapon during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime.  Wimbush appeals, arguing the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict and in\r\nallowing the testimony of a State's witness.  We affirm. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a circumstantial evidence case.  The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, is as follows.  The two victims,\r\nElijah Hunt and Kevin White, were found shot to death at the T&amp;T nightclub by a passerby around noon on November 17, 1995.  \r\nWhen the police arrived at the scene they found Hunt on the floor near a door entering the pool table area and Kevin White lying on\r\nthe floor near the pool table.   Police recovered ten beer cans in the pool table area.  Seven empty beer cans were found on the\r\ntable near White, two opened beer cans were on a chair in the pool table area next to White, and one unopened can was on the\r\nfloor.  A black Nike cap was found lying on top of White's left arm.  A Dallas Cowboys blue knit cap was found near White's\r\nbody.  The door to the premises was unlocked, but the keys were found at the scene.\r\n\r\nA SLED expert in fingerprint analysis tested forty-four latent fingerprints taken from the ten beer cans and found six prints matched\r\nthe appellant Wimbush and three matched the victim Hunt.  A ballistics expert found that Hunt was shot with a .357 magnum or a\r\n.38 caliber handgun.  The bullet fragments taken from White were unsuitable for identification.\r\n\r\nPeggy Nelson, Hunt's niece, stated she ran the T&amp;T nightclub and that she closed it between 8:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on\r\nNovember 16, 1995 because they had no customers.  She lived five doors down from the club on Pelfrey Road, and Hunt had\r\nbeen living with her for about a month.  Nelson stated that before she left the club, she locked the doors and cleaned up, throwing\r\naway all the beer cans she could find.   Nelson stated she was certain she had picked up every can that was in plain view.\r\n\r\nNelson testified the last time she saw her uncle alive was when he was standing in her kitchen sometime between 12:30 a.m. and\r\n1:30 a.m. in the early morning hours of November 17th.  Nelson stated Hunt had access to the keys to the T&amp;T nightclub, which\r\nwere found at the scene, because he would sometimes go down to the club in the afternoon to get a fire started in order to warm\r\nthe building before she arrived.   She noted Wimbush had previously been to the club, but she could not recall how often.\r\n\r\nDaphne Nelson called Hunt, her uncle, at her mother's (Nelson's) house and spoke to him for about five minutes around 12:30\r\na.m. on November 17th.  Hunt was to bring her daughter's clothes over to her home, but Hunt never made it to her house.\r\n\r\nWadell Mack stated he saw the victim Kevin White with Wimbush around 11:00 p.m. on November 16, 1995, when White and\r\nWimbush were standing in the road in front of his home.  Wadell confirmed he sold Wimbush a .357 magnum handgun for $100 in\r\nApril of 1995.\r\n\r\nTravis Mack, whose sister was dating White, testified he saw Wimbush and White together, on the night of November 16, 1995,\r\nwhile they were all standing around a fire in his yard, and he noticed Wimbush was carrying a .357 handgun.  According to Mack,\r\nthe next time he saw Wimbush was around 3:30 a.m. on the morning of November 17th when Wimbush came over and asked\r\nWhite to go with him to get a drink.  Mack stated White refused at first, telling Wimbush, \"I'm not f***ing with you.\"  Wimbush left\r\nthe room and came back, telling White he had some liquor.  White then dressed and left with Wimbush.  Before he left, White told\r\nMack that he \"was going to Elijah's [Hunt's] house to get a beer\" and that he would \"be right back.\"   However, White never\r\nreturned home, and Mack never saw Wimbush again.\r\n\r\nMack stated when Wimbush left he was wearing blue jeans, a black Nike cap, and a FILA jacket.   Mack positively identified the\r\nhat retrieved at the scene as being the one Wimbush was wearing when he left with White.  Mack stated White was wearing a\r\nDallas Cowboys blue knit cap with a star on the front.\r\n\r\nAround 6:00 a.m. on November 17th, Wimbush arrived at Victoria Delay's house.  Delay had met Wimbush before but they were\r\nnot friends.  Delay testified that when she opened the door, \"He [Wimbush] said he didn't want to hurt anybody.  He just needed a\r\nride home, because his girlfriend had left him back there in the projects.\"   Delay told Wimbush to wait in her car while she got\r\nready for work, and he came back to her door twice, at one point asking her if she had any company at her home.  When she came\r\nout to leave, Wimbush was gone.  As she drove down the street, Delay saw Wimbush walking and gave him a ride to his\r\ngirlfriend's house.   Wimbush told Delay that he needed to go home to get some sleep.   Wadell Mack, who left for work each\r\nmorning at 6:30 a.m., confirmed that he saw Wimbush walking along the road around 6:35 a.m. on November 17, 1995.\r\n\r\nMary Mack, who at the time of the murders had been Wimbush's girlfriend for a year and a half, testified that Wimbush arrived at\r\nher home around 6:45 a.m. on November 17th.  Mary had given Wimbush a ride out to \"the country,\" as she called it, the evening\r\nbefore.  Wimbush told Mary that he had just talked to his mother and that he needed a ride to the bus station so he could go to\r\nNew York because his sister was sick.   Mary dropped Wimbush off at the bus station but did not see him enter.  Wimbush told\r\nher he would be back the following Thursday in order to go to a wedding they had planned to attend together on Saturday.  \r\nHowever, Wimbush did not return, and Mary never heard from him again until nearly a year later when he was in the Sumter\r\nCounty Jail.  Notably, Wimbush's mother and the purportedly sick sister did attend the wedding on Saturday as scheduled.\r\n\r\nAfter the State rested, Wimbush moved for a directed verdict.  The trial court denied the motion, finding there was sufficient\r\ncircumstantial evidence presented to create a question of fact for the jury as to Wimbush's guilt. (2)  The jury convicted Wimbush of\r\ntwo counts of murder and one count of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.  He received concurrent\r\nsentences of life in prison on each murder conviction and five years for possession of a weapon.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Directed Verdict Motion\r\n\r\nWimbush first contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to present\r\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence of his guilt.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 \r\n  (2001), our supreme court recently reiterated the standard for reviewing the \r\n  denial of a directed verdict motion:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict \r\n    when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged. State v. \r\n    Brown, 103 S.C. 437, 88 S.E. 21 (1916). In reviewing a motion for directed \r\n    verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, \r\n    not with its weight. State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 535 S.E.2d 126 (2000). \r\n    On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view \r\n    the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Burdette, \r\n    335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d \r\n    63 (1998). If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n    reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case \r\n    was properly submitted to the jury. State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d \r\n    526 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 97, 544 S.E.2d at 36.\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find the State presented substantial circumstantial evidence to\r\nsurvive a motion for directed verdict.  Witnesses testified that Wimbush had purchased a .357 handgun and that he had this gun\r\nwith him shortly before the murders.  The police confirmed that at least one of the victims was shot with a .357 handgun or a .38\r\npistol.  Further, Wimbush was last seen with White around 3:30 a.m. the morning of November 17th, when he reluctantly left with\r\nWimbush to get some beer from Hunt.  The door to the T&amp;T nightclub was unlocked, not broken, and Hunt was known to have\r\naccess to the keys, which were also found at the scene.\r\n\r\nThere was also physical evidence placing Wimbush at the scene of the murders because his fingerprints were found on several of\r\nthe beer cans located in open view near the bodies.  In addition, a black Nike cap lying on top of  White's body was positively\r\nidentified as belonging to Wimbush and as being the hat Wimbush was wearing when he left with White shortly before the murders.  \r\n\r\nThere were also inconsistent statements and evidence \r\n  of flight from which inferences of guilty knowledge or intent may be drawn. \r\n  Wimbush asked someone he hardly knew, Delay, for a ride around 6:00 a.m., saying \r\n  he wasn't there to \"hurt\" anybody, and telling her he wanted to go home to sleep. \r\n  However, his subsequent statement to his girlfriend only minutes later was that \r\n  he had just spoken to his mother and had to leave town immediately. Further, \r\n  his action in immediately leaving town the morning of the murders without contacting \r\n  his girlfriend until nearly a year later is inconsistent with his statement \r\n  that he would be returning the following week to attend a wedding. Cf., e.g., \r\n  State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 200, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (reversing \r\n  the Court of Appeals and finding a directed verdict was properly denied by the \r\n  trial court in a case involving possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, \r\n  stating although no drugs were found in the defendant's possession when he was \r\n  caught, evidence of the defendant's flight was \"at least some evidence of guilt\" \r\n  that should have been considered by the reviewing court); State v. Scott, 330 \r\n  S.C. 125, 131, 497 S.E.2d 735, 738 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding the defendant's \r\n  failure to return to his employer's premises after a routine audit \"is, in essence, \r\n  evidence of flight, which can be considered evidence of guilty knowledge and \r\n  intent\").\r\n\r\nWe find the evidence, though circumstantial, was sufficient to present a question of fact for the jury's determination as to\r\nWimbush's guilt.  Accordingly, we find the trial court correctly denied Wimbush's motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nII.  Testimony of State's Witness\r\n\r\nWimbush next asserts he is entitled to a reversal because the trial court  allowed a State's witness to testify that he saw Wimbush\r\nand one of the victims selling drugs prior to the murders.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe first witness at trial, Wadell Mack, testified that he last saw Wimbush with Kevin White when they were standing in the street in\r\nfront of his (Wadell's) house selling drugs around 11:00 p.m. on November 16, 1995.  Defense counsel objected to Mack's\r\nstatement that Wimbush was selling drugs, stating, \"I don't know where this is going.\"  Upon questioning, counsel stated, \"[M]y\r\nclient is not accused of selling drugs.\"   When the trial court again asked for the specific grounds for his objection, counsel did not\r\noffer anything further, and the court overruled the objection.   After this brief reference, the questioning of the witness proceeded\r\nwith no further testimony on this point, nor further objection from the defense.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Wimbush contends the trial court committed \r\n  reversible error in allowing the testimony that he was selling drugs. Wimbush \r\n  asserts \"[t]he evidence was inadmissible under any theory permitting character \r\n  evidence pursuant to Rule 404, SCRE [and] State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. \r\n  803 (1923).\" We find this issue is not preserved for our review as Wimbush did \r\n  not articulate the grounds for objection that he now argues on appeal. State \r\n  v. Gardner, 332 S.C. 389, 393-94, 505 S.E.2d 338, 340 (1998) (precluding issued \r\n  from appellate review where appellant objected but failed to articulate any \r\n  meaningful grounds for the trial court's consideration); State v. Hamilton, \r\n  344 S.C. 344, 361, 543 S.E.2d 586, 595 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"In order to preserve \r\n  for review an alleged error, the objection should be sufficiently specific to \r\n  bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error so it can be reasonably \r\n  understood by the trial judge.\"). \r\n\r\nAlthough Wimbush contends, citing Rule 103(a)(1), \r\n  SCRE, his objection was apparent from the context so that no specific objection \r\n  was necessary, we do not agree, observing the trial court was not aware of the \r\n  specific grounds for his objection. (3) Despite \r\n  repeated requests by the trial judge, defense counsel failed to mention the \r\n  words 'prior bad acts', 'Rule 404', 'State v. Lyle', or 'character evidence'. \r\n  Further, Wimbush makes no argument on appeal that defense counsel was prohibited \r\n  from making an appropriate objection. Rather, the transcript indicates defense \r\n  counsel's statements trailed off and he failed to answer the trial court's final \r\n  inquiry regarding the grounds for his objection. (4) \r\n  Accordingly, we find no ground for reversal in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the conviction and sentence of Wimbush is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J. and HOWARD, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.    Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument\r\npursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2.   Wimbush did not testify and presented no evidence at trial.\r\n3.    \r\n\r\n\r\nQ. [    ]  Let me ask you this, on November 16th, did you see him\r\n[Wimbush]?\r\nA. Yeah, about 11 o'clock.\r\nQ. At night or during the day?\r\nA. I saw him a little bit during the day.  And the last time I saw him was about 11 o'clock that night.\r\nQ. 11 o'clock that night.  Tell us where you saw him, who he was with, and what he was doing.\r\nA. Well to him it's a day, they were selling drugs.  And they stayed at the road for cars to come through.  And they be out there all\r\ntime of night.  And my wife is---\r\n    MR. SPIGNER: Your Honor, I object. I don't know where this is going.\r\nTHE COURT:  What's the objection?  Just give me the grounds.\r\nMR. SPIGNER:  Your Honor, the defendant hasn't----\r\nTHE COURT:  Just give me grounds, Mr. Spigner.\r\n    MR. SPIGNER: He's mentioned him selling drugs. I mean, my client is not accused \r\n    of selling drugs.\r\n    THE COURT: You still haven't given me the grounds for your objection, Mr. \r\n    Spigner.\r\nMR. SPIGNER:  Your Honor, I mean . . . .\r\nTHE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  Proceed.  [Emphasis added.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

See Rule 63, SCRCP. We vacate the orders on appeal and remand \r\n  the action to the family court.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Procedural Background \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJames Christy (the husband) and Vida Christy (the \r\n  wife) were divorced by order of the family court dated August 2, 1989. Pursuant \r\n  to the divorce decree, the wife was awarded $2,500 per month in alimony. On \r\n  appeal, the alimony was reduced by this court to $1,750 per month terminable \r\n  on the death or remarriage of the wife. Later, these parties again appeared \r\n  before this court to litigate the effective date for the reduction of the alimony. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe husband filed this third action in June of \r\n  1997 requesting termination or reduction of alimony based on the wife's alleged \r\n  \"long-term, monogamous relationship with a paramour, which is tantamount to \r\n  a common law marriage\" and changes in his own financial circumstances. The wife \r\n  answered and counterclaimed seeking an increase in alimony. \r\n\r\nThe Honorable Tommy B. Edwards bifurcated the issues. \r\n  The issue of termination of alimony based on the wife's alleged common law marriage \r\n  was tried first on September 16, 17, 25, 26, and November 4 of 1996 by the Honorable \r\n  John T. Black. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Black made no oral factual \r\n  or legal findings on the record. However, according to Mr. Rosen, the wife's \r\n  attorney, Judge Black stated in a side bar conference that he was not going \r\n  to terminate the wife's alimony. \r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1997, Mr. Rosen sent Judge Black a proposed \r\n  order containing findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of the proposed \r\n  order was sent to the husband's counsel, Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Goldstein objected \r\n  in writing to certain portions of the proposed order in a letter dated July \r\n  15, 1997. Mr. Rosen's legal assistant made Mr. Goldstein's requested changes \r\n  pursuant to Judge Black's telephonic instructions to the assistant. On August \r\n  26, 1997, the assistant sent the revised order to Judge Black and Mr. Goldstein. \r\n  Months thereafter, Judge Black suffered a stroke without having signed any order. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe husband filed a notice of appeal from the unsigned \r\n  order. This court dismissed the action because there was no signed order. The \r\n  husband filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the supreme court requesting \r\n  the court take the action in its original jurisdiction. The supreme court denied \r\n  the petition. \r\n\r\nThe Honorable F.P. Segars-Andrews succeeded Judge \r\n  Black as the presiding judge in this action. The husband filed a motion for \r\n  a new trial pursuant to Rule 63, SCRCP. On January 14, 1998, Judge Segars-Andrews \r\n  denied the motion finding Judge Black made:\r\n\r\n\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law in this \r\n    case. Therefore, Rule 63 applies. While Judge Black's findings of fact and \r\n    conclusions of law were not \"filed,\" as Rule 63 literally requires, no case \r\n    presented to the Court by either party interpreting Rule 63 requires such \r\n    a filing or even defines what constitutes filing in this context.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Segars-Andrews also found the husband should \r\n  be equitably estopped from obtaining a new trial due to his request to the clerk \r\n  of court for a trial date for the second portion of the bifurcated trial. Judge \r\n  Segars-Andrews further concluded \"a review of the transcript is not necessary \r\n  in this matter and . . . the order may be signed by the successor judge without \r\n  any further proceedings.\" Also on January 14, 1998, Judge Segars-Andrews signed \r\n  the wife's original proposed order, without the husband's requested changes, \r\n  refusing to terminate alimony. (1) On June 15, \r\n  1998, the wife filed a motion, pursuant to Rule 60(a), SCRCP, to correct clerical \r\n  errors on the ground the wrong final order was submitted to Judge Segars-Andrews. \r\n  The husband objected on the ground the motion was filed in an attempt \"to make \r\n  the final order less assailable on appeal.\" Judge Segars-Andrews denied the \r\n  motion. \r\n\r\nThe second portion of the case was heard by the \r\n  Honorable Alvin C. Biggs on January 14, 15, and February 10, 1998. On April \r\n  6, 1998, Judge Biggs dismissed the husband's request for termination or modification \r\n  of alimony based on a financial change of circumstances. Judge Biggs also dismissed \r\n  the wife's counterclaim for an increase in alimony and awarded the wife costs. \r\n  In a separate order dated June 30, 1998, Judge Biggs awarded the wife attorney \r\n  fees and costs totaling $100,761.44. \r\n\r\nBoth parties appealed. The husband filed a motion \r\n  in this court to remand to reconstruct the record or, in the alternative, for \r\n  a new trial. As to the motion to remand, the husband argued that because the \r\n  court reporter's tapes for one of the dates of trial were lost, the action should \r\n  be remanded for reconstruction of the record or to take new testimony. As to \r\n  the motion for a new trial, the husband cited Rule 63 and argued \"the conduct \r\n  of the case has been plagued with severe irregularities\" entitling him to a \r\n  new trial. (2) By order dated November 30, 1998, \r\n  this court remanded for the sole purpose of supplying the missing testimony. \r\n  Both parties appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Law/Analysis \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe husband argues Judge Segars-Andrews erred in \r\n  failing to order a new trial and in signing the proposed order under Rule 63, \r\n  SCRCP. Rule 63 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n  If by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, \r\n    a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties \r\n    to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned \r\n    or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then the resident judge \r\n    of the circuit or any other judge having jurisdiction in the court in which \r\n    the action was tried may perform those duties; but if such other judge is \r\n    satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at \r\n    the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rule is identical to the pre-1991 federal \r\n  Rule 63 except it makes allowances for our circuit court system. \r\n  (3) It supplements South Carolina Code Section 14-5-370, which permits \r\n  the judge of an adjoining circuit to act if there is a circuit without a resident \r\n  judge, and no other special or regular judge is presiding therein, and applies \r\n  to South Carolina family courts. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-5-370 (1977); Rule 2, SCRFC; \r\n  Rule 81, SCRCP. \r\n\r\nThere are no reported South Carolina cases applying \r\n  Rule 63, SCRCP, under facts similar to those presented in this case. Cf. Charleston \r\n  County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Father, 317 S.C. 283, 288, 454 S.E.2d 307, 310 \r\n  (1995) (discussing the authority of a successor judge to rule on a motion for \r\n  reconsideration where the previous trial judge signed and filed an order). Accordingly, \r\n  we look to other jurisdictions and the federal courts for interpretation of \r\n  the pre-1991 federal rule. See Gardner v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, 304 S.C. \r\n  328, 330, 404 S.E.2d 200, 201 (1991) (\"Since our Rules of Procedure are based \r\n  on the Federal Rules, where there is no South Carolina law, we look to the construction \r\n  placed on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\").&nbsp;\r\n  Rule 63 does not explicitly address instances where, as here, the presiding \r\n  judge becomes disabled before he files his findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law. See H. Lightsey, Jr. &amp; J. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure \r\n  499 (2d ed. 1996) (\"The disability of a judge prior to [accepting a verdict \r\n  or filing findings of fact and conclusions of law] is not governed by the rule. \r\n  . . .\"). Federal courts, however, have read into the pre-1991 Rule 63 the negative \r\n  inference that if the presiding judge in a civil case dies or becomes disabled \r\n  before the rendering of a verdict or before the judge issues his findings of \r\n  fact and conclusions of law, a successor judge must retry the case. See Townsend \r\n  v. Gray Line Bus Co., 767 F.2d 11, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1985); Arrow-Hart, Inc. v. \r\n  Philip Carey Co., 552 F.2d 711, 713 (6th Cir. 1977); Emerson Elec. Co. v. Gen. \r\n  Elec. Co., 846 F.2d 1324, 1325-26 (11th Cir. 1988). \"The federal cases which \r\n  have been found construing federal Rule 63 . . . are unanimous in their holding \r\n  that a trial de novo is required where the trial judge dies [or becomes disabled] \r\n  before signing findings and conclusions or a jury verdict [is] returned.\" Estate \r\n  of Ed Cassity, 656 P.2d 1023, 1024 (Utah 1982).\r\n\r\nIn Girard Trust Bank v. Easton, the North Carolina \r\n  Court of Appeals interpreted North Carolina's Rule 63. \r\n  (4) Girard, 182 S.E.2d 645, 646 (N.C. Ct. App. 1971). The trial judge \r\n  in Girard issued an oral ruling in favor of the plaintiff at the conclusion \r\n  of the bench trial and directed the plaintiff's counsel to submit a proposed \r\n  order containing appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. The judge \r\n  then died without having signed the proposed order. The court concluded the \r\n  oral ruling and directive did not constitute sufficient findings of fact to \r\n  proceed under Rule 63. Id. at 645-46.\r\n\r\nEven if we construe Judge Black's directive to \r\n  draft a proposed order as his findings of fact and conclusions of law, these \r\n  findings and conclusions were neither signed nor filed before the onset of his \r\n  disability, as required by Rule 63. Judge Black remained free to adopt or reject \r\n  any or all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the proposed \r\n  order. See Bowman v. Richland Mem'l Hosp., 335 S.C. 88, 91, 515 S.E.2d 259, \r\n  260 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"An order is not final until it is written and entered \r\n  by the clerk of court. Until an order is written and entered by the clerk of \r\n  court, the judge retains discretion to change his mind and amend his ruling \r\n  accordingly.\") (citations omitted). Thus, Judge Black did not, prior to his \r\n  disability, make findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to allow \r\n  Judge Segars-Andrews to conclude the case by simply signing a proposed order \r\n  that he had instructed be modified.\r\n\r\nJudge Segars-Andrews relied in part on Rex Oil, \r\n  Ltd. v. M/V Jacinth, 873 F.2d 82 (5th Cir. 1989) and The Del-Mar-Va, 56 F. Supp. \r\n  743 (D. Va. 1944). The successor judges in these cases did not strictly comply \r\n  with the requirement in Rule 63 that findings of fact and conclusions of law \r\n  be filed by the presiding judges prior to their disabilities. We find these \r\n  cases distinguishable from the case at hand.\r\n\r\nIn Rex Oil, the case was tried before a judge of \r\n  the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas over two \r\n  days in April, 1987. Rex Oil, 873 F.2d at 83. The judge \"gave a fairly extensive \r\n  oral exposition of his perceptions about the case[,] . . . stated his intention \r\n  to enter final judgment in favor of Rex/Empire[, and] . . . related his basic \r\n  reasoning for entering such a judgment.\" Id. at 85. The judge also indicated \r\n  he intended to file extensive findings and conclusions. Eight months later, \r\n  before a final judgment was entered, the judge passed away. A successor judge \r\n  entered judgment pursuant to Rule 63. Id. \r\n\r\nIn affirming the successor judge's conclusion that \r\n  a new trial was not required under Rule 63, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  agreed that a successor judge acquires discretionary authority to grant or deny \r\n  a new trial only after a final verdict is returned or findings of fact or conclusions \r\n  of law are filed. The court concluded, however, that the judge's oral pronouncements, \r\n  on the record, constituted sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law. \r\n  Id. at 87-88.\r\n\r\nIn The Del-Mar-Va, Judge Way held a three-day trial \r\n  in July of 1943. At the conclusion of the evidence and oral arguments, Judge \r\n  Way, on the record, orally decided the fault of the parties. He then requested \r\n  the parties (5) brief the issue of a defense \r\n  raised by one of the parties. Briefs were filed and on September 14, 1943, Judge \r\n  Way, supplementing his oral decision, filed an \"informal memorandum\" determining \r\n  the ultimate fault of the parties and holding each liable for half of the damages. \r\n  On September 16, 1943, counsel for The Del-Mar-Va submitted proposed findings \r\n  of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Judge Way's oral rulings. \r\n  At the request of the United States, Judge Way decided to allow another witness \r\n  to testify and the parties to reargue the issues. The Del-Mar-Va, 56 F. Supp. \r\n  at 744-47.\r\n\r\nCounsel for The Del-Mar-Va died prior to the new \r\n  hearing. Judge Way restated his decision to permit new testimony. The Del-Mar-Va \r\n  submitted a memorandum opposing entry of the proposed order. Judge Way died \r\n  soon thereafter without considering the memo or signing the proposed order. \r\n  Id. at 747.\r\n\r\nThe successor judge first concluded the United \r\n  States was not entitled, on the merits, to reopen the case to add the omitted \r\n  witness's testimony, and that in any event, the testimony would merely be cumulative \r\n  evidence. Thus, he denied the motion to reopen the case. Id. at 749-51. He then \r\n  concluded Judge Way's informal memorandum \"embodied specific findings on all \r\n  the material facts in the cases, and set out adequate conclusions on all the \r\n  important questions of law involved therein.\" Id. at 748. The successor judge \r\n  then designated Judge Way's informal findings of fact and conclusions of law \r\n  as his own. Id. at 751.\r\n\r\nIn both Rex Oil and The Del-Mar-Va, although not \r\n  filed, extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law were made on the record. \r\n  In this action, although Judge Black allegedly indicated in a side-bar conference \r\n  that he would not terminate the wife's alimony, he made no findings of fact \r\n  to support the decision. Thus, we find reliance on Rex Oil and The Del-Mar-Va \r\n  is misplaced.\r\n\r\nTwo exceptions have developed to the general operation \r\n  of Rule 63. First, if all parties consent, a successor judge may make findings \r\n  of fact and conclusions of law based on the trial transcript. Second, the successor \r\n  judge may consider the trial transcript as akin to \"supporting affidavits\" for \r\n  summary judgment purposes and render judgment if no credibility determinations \r\n  are required. Emerson Elec. Co. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 846 F.2d 1324, 1326 (11th \r\n  Cir. 1988). Absent consent of the parties, a successor judge cannot make credibility \r\n  determinations. Id.; see also Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 684 F.2d 272, \r\n  274 (4th Cir. 1982) (finding Rule 63 communicates a positive prohibition on \r\n  substitution of a judge prior to verdict where all parties have not stipulated \r\n  their consent).\r\n\r\nThis case does not fall within one of these exceptions. \r\n  The parties did not consent to allow Judge Segars-Andrews to make findings of \r\n  fact and conclusions of law based on the trial transcript. In fact, Judge Segars-Andrews \r\n  specifically declined to review the transcript and make her own findings of \r\n  fact and conclusions of law. Both exceptions require the successor judge to \r\n  review the transcript. As this was not done, neither exception applies.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we are constrained to hold that Judge \r\n  Segars-Andrews, in applying Rule 63, erred in concluding it was not necessary \r\n  for her to review the transcript of the record before entering a final order. \r\n  The order, in conflict with the law interpreting Rule 63, necessarily relies \r\n  on credibility determinations which are prohibited by a successor judge unless \r\n  the parties stipulate to the record and consent to have the successor judge \r\n  make determinations based on a review of the transcript. Therefore, we vacate \r\n  Judge Segars-Andrews' order and remand to the family court. \r\n\r\nFurther, in light of our disposition as to Judge \r\n  Segars-Andrews' order, we also vacate Judge Biggs' order addressing the second \r\n  portion of the bifurcated trial. To the extent Judge Biggs relied on the findings \r\n  contained in Judge Segars-Andrews' order in reaching his decision, the issue \r\n  of whether the alimony award should be adjusted based on changed circumstances \r\n  must be revisited. Further, Judge Biggs' order determines the award of attorney \r\n  fees to the wife from both portions of the trial. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the orders of the family court are \r\n  vacated and the case remanded to the family court. (6) \r\n  We note, however, the parties may avoid a new trial by consenting on remand \r\n  to a final order by the family court after review of the trial transcript. \r\n\r\nVACATED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n 1.    \r\n  The order also included the issues surrounding Judge Black's disability. \r\n   \r\n 2.  The husband argues on appeal \r\n  that either the original proposed order was unsolicited or it was the result \r\n  of ex parte communications between Judge Black and Mr. Rosen.  \r\n3.  Federal Rule 63 was amended \r\n  in 1991. The revised federal Rule 63, unlike the prior rule, is not limited \r\n  to cases in which a judge's disability manifests itself after completion of \r\n  the trial or hearing. All that is required is that the trial or hearing shall \r\n  have commenced. Case law interpreted the pre-1991 Rule 63 to limit a successor \r\n  judge to preside only after the trial was completed. The amendment expanded \r\n  Rule 63 to allow a successor judge to complete an incomplete trial. See Canseco \r\n  v. United States, 97 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 1996) (discussing the 1991 \r\n  amendment). The revised rule also permits a successor judge to proceed with \r\n  a trial \"upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the \r\n  proceedings in the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties.\" \r\n  Rule 63, Fed. R. Civ. P. In a hearing without a jury, the revised rule provides \r\n  that the successor judge shall, at the request of a party, recall any witness \r\n  whose testimony is material and disputed . . . . The successor judge may also \r\n  recall any other witness.\" Id.  \r\n4.  The rule considered by the \r\n  North Carolina Court of Appeals is identical to South Carolina's rule.  \r\n5.  The Del-Mar-Va and the United \r\n  States.  \r\n6.

Dudek, of \r\n          SC Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy \r\n          Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General \r\n          Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all \r\n          of Columbia; and Solicitor Jay E. Hodge, Jr., of Darlington, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: In this consolidated \r\n  appeal, Charles \"Rickey\" Stuckey, Jeffery Walls, Martin McIntosh, and Leroy \r\n  Staton appeal their convictions for murder, kidnapping, first degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct (CSC), and criminal conspiracy, and Alfonzo Staton appeals his \r\n  convictions for murder, kidnapping, and criminal conspiracy. Each appellant \r\n  challenges the trial court's denial of his severance and directed verdict motions. \r\n  Additionally, McIntosh argues the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor \r\n  to improperly comment on his silence during police questioning. In this opinion, \r\n  we affirm the trial court's decision to try appellants jointly and affirm its \r\n  denial of Stuckey's directed verdict motions. (1) \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\nStuckey and his co-appellants were each indicted \r\n  on charges of murder, kidnapping, first degree CSC, and criminal conspiracy. \r\n  Appellants were tried jointly with Robert Graham, who was indicted for the same \r\n  charges with the exception of murder. (2) The \r\n  State presented the following evidence at trial.\r\n\r\nState's Case\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 12, 1994, Victim's sister \r\n  picked her up to go shopping. Victim's car was inoperable, and she had hired \r\n  Ringo Pearson to repair it. Victim and Pearson were outside Victim's home talking \r\n  when the sister arrived. Sister brought Victim home an hour or so later. The \r\n  two were supposed to talk on the telephone at 10:00 p.m., but Victim never called \r\n  and Sister's calls went unanswered. Victim's family attempted unsuccessfully \r\n  to reach her throughout the evening, and after Victim failed to attend a planned \r\n  event the next day, Sister called the police and filed a missing person's report. \r\n  \r\n\r\nPolice discovered Victim's body floating in a creek \r\n  near Burnt Factory Road on November 24, 1994. Her wrists and ankles were bound \r\n  together behind her back with duct tape. With the exception of her forehead, \r\n  part of her chin, and a small area at the tip of her nose, her face was entirely \r\n  covered with duct tape which was wrapped around her head. Her pants were pulled \r\n  down below her knees. Her body was bloated and in a state of decomposition. \r\n  A preliminary identification was made based on the clothing Victim was last \r\n  seen wearing, but the condition of the body prevented further visual identification. \r\n  Police used fingerprints and palm prints to positively identify the body. \r\n\r\nDoctor Sandra Conradi, who performed Victim's autopsy, \r\n  concluded the cause of death was asphyxiation caused by encasement of Victim's \r\n  head with duct tape. Victim could not breathe enough to remain alive despite \r\n  a small opening in the duct tape near the tip of her nose because the tape was \r\n  applied to her face so tightly that it severely compressed her nose. Doctor \r\n  Conradi opined Victim died within minutes of having her face bound with duct \r\n  tape, but could not completely rule out the possibility that she drowned because \r\n  drowning is a difficult diagnosis to eliminate. Doctor Conradi testified she \r\n  believed Victim died before she was placed in the creek, but did not offer any \r\n  opinion as to how long she had been dead at that time. She did conclude, however, \r\n  that Victim died several days before her autopsy and may have died as early \r\n  as November&nbsp;12. Doctor Conradi found no seminal fluid or injury in the \r\n  genital area but explained the water and decomposition may have affected those \r\n  findings.\r\n\r\nThe investigation led police to an abandoned house \r\n  where Stuckey formerly lived. There officers discovered duct tape, Victim's \r\n  prescription safety eyeglasses, and an earring matching one found on her body. \r\n  \r\n\r\nOfficers approached Jeffery Walls' brother, Sam, \r\n  asking him about duct tape. Sam told them he had a partial roll of duct tape \r\n  underneath his car seat and, at their request, turned it over to them. At trial, \r\n  Sam explained he obtained the tape from his mother's home, where Jeffery lived, \r\n  to use on some electrical wires in the car. He testified that at the time of \r\n  Victim's disappearance, Pearson was performing body work on his car. On cross-examination, \r\n  however, Sam stated he did not take the tape out of his mother's home until \r\n  after Pearson finished working on his car in late October or early November. \r\n  \r\n\r\nJohn Barron, a SLED expert in trace evidence analysis, \r\n  testified the duct tape Sam Walls provided was identical in structure and composition \r\n  to the tape removed from Victim's body and the tape discovered at the abandoned \r\n  house. Upon further investigation, Barron discovered the tape was manufactured \r\n  by an English company which does not directly market or sell it in the United \r\n  States. The company sells the tape primarily in England, exporting only one \r\n  percent of the total production to other European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Dwayne Sloan's Testimony \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDwayne Sloan testified he spent the evening of \r\n  November 11 and the morning of November 12 with his brother, Lee, and Ringo \r\n  Pearson, Jeffery Walls, and Alfonzo Staton. Sloan left the group on the afternoon \r\n  of the 12th to go to work at Burger King. He arrived early for his 4:00 p.m. \r\n  shift. During Sloan's break, Jeffery Walls, Pearson, and Alfonzo came to the \r\n  Burger King, Walls and Pearson arriving together and Alfonzo by himself. The \r\n  group stood outside and talked for a few minutes. When Pearson decided to leave, \r\n  Sloan and Alfonzo asked him where he and Walls were going. Pearson responded \r\n  he was \"going to get [Victim (3)] to suck his \r\n  d**k.\" Pearson and Walls then left together and Alfonzo left alone five or ten \r\n  minutes later. \r\n\r\nSloan also testified that during a trip to North \r\n  Carolina on November 29, Pearson confessed to killing Victim. On the trip, Pearson \r\n  asked Sloan and Alfonzo whether the police had questioned either of them about \r\n  a murder. When they both said they had not been questioned, Pearson stated the \r\n  police did not have enough evidence to prove he committed the crime. He then \r\n  recounted to them the following events: He and Victim, whose car he had worked \r\n  on, had pulled alongside a dirt road and began having sex in the back seat. \r\n  When Victim pulled away, Pearson slapped her and yelled at her. When she continued \r\n  to resist, he tied her hands behind her back. Despite her pleas, Pearson drove \r\n  down Burnt Factory Road and pushed her in the water. \r\n\r\nJeffrey Graham's Testimony\r\n\r\nJeffrey Graham testified about a visit Leroy Staton \r\n  and Pearson made to the home he shared with his sister and father in November \r\n  1994. They wanted to see Jeffrey's sister and spoke with her in another room. \r\n  Afterward, they invited Jeffrey to a party. In a statement to police, Jeffrey \r\n  said Leroy and Pearson said somebody had a woman at the party and Leroy asked \r\n  if he wanted to ride with them and \"get a piece.\" (4) \r\n  Jeffrey told Leroy and Pearson he was not going to the party. At a federal grand \r\n  jury proceeding, Jeffrey explained when he was invited to come \"get a piece,\" \r\n  he understood that \"they had a woman that everybody was going to do something \r\n  [to].\" \r\n\r\n Jeffrey and Stuckey worked at a garage for Stuckey's \r\n  dad, Mack Stuckey. Jeffrey told police that the day after he was invited to \r\n  the party, he overheard Stuckey tell Mack and Joe Stuckey at the garage, \"I \r\n  want that bitch out of my trailer.\" Mike Spears and Leroy were also there. Martin \r\n  McIntosh was also present, but Jeffrey did not believe Martin could hear the \r\n  conversation because he was outside at the time. The same day, Jeffrey rode \r\n  with his cousin, Robert Graham (\"Graham\"), to the trailer where Graham and Stuckey \r\n  lived. Jeffrey did not go inside, but saw Stuckey, Leroy, Alfonzo, and others \r\n  in the yard drinking. \r\n\r\nDanny Davis' Testimony\r\n\r\nDanny Davis testified he went to a cookout at Graham \r\n  and Stuckey's. Leroy, Stuckey, Graham, and others were present. When he went \r\n  inside to get a beer he saw Victim lying on the couch. Her ankles and mouth \r\n  were taped and her wrists were taped behind her back. He then returned to the \r\n  cookout. When asked why he did not say anything about the woman to the others, \r\n  Davis replied: \"Because I didn't know what to think. I didn't know if it was \r\n  a game or what was going on.\" After the food was cooked, Davis went home some \r\n  seventy-five yards away while the others remained. \r\n\r\nDavis returned to the trailer about dusk at Stuckey's \r\n  invitation. Leroy, Alfonzo, Walls, McIntosh, and Pearson were at the party. \r\n  Leroy, Stuckey, and Graham were inside the trailer. When he went to the bathroom, \r\n  Davis saw Victim in the bedroom. She was on the bed and tied up in the same \r\n  manner as before. About thirty minutes after Davis arrived, he and Robert Ransom, \r\n  who also lived nearby and is disabled, asked Pearson for a ride home. Ransom \r\n  and Davis were told to get in Pearson's car. Pearson and Stuckey then came from \r\n  around the trailer with Victim, whose mouth, legs, and hands were still taped, \r\n  and put her in the car. Walls also got in the car, and the group left. Instead \r\n  of taking Ransom and Davis home, Pearson drove to an old abandoned house in \r\n  the country where Stuckey previously lived. Stuckey and Pearson carried Victim \r\n  onto the porch and placed her on a couch which they then carried inside the \r\n  house. Ransom and Davis were then driven home. \r\n\r\nThe next evening, Davis met Stuckey and Pearson \r\n  at Ransom's home. Stuckey said \"we've got that girl and we've got to do something \r\n  with her or all of us are going to be in trouble.\" Ransom asked if Stuckey and \r\n  Pearson would take him and Davis to get something to drink, and they agreed. \r\n  Pearson left to get his car and returned a few minutes later with Leroy and \r\n  Alfonzo. Stuckey, Davis, and Ransom got in the car and Pearson drove to an abandoned \r\n  house. McIntosh and Walls were standing outside the house. Stuckey and Pearson \r\n  went inside and brought Victim out. Her ankles were taped as before, but Davis \r\n  noticed that instead of tape over only her mouth, \"just about her whole head \r\n  was taped up.\" Stuckey and Pearson \"tote[d]\" her to the car and placed her in \r\n  the back seat with Ransom, Davis, Alfonzo, and Leroy. Walls also climbed in \r\n  the back seat, and Pearson, Stuckey, and McIntosh sat in the front seat. \r\n\r\nDavis testified Victim fell over on Ransom when \r\n  she was placed in the car. Ransom asked Davis to pull her off him and Stuckey \r\n  responded, \"Bobby, you don't have to worry about her bothering you because she's \r\n  already dead.\" (5) With everyone in the car, \r\n  they drove to Burnt Factory Road. When they arrived at the creek, Victim was \r\n  thrown in the water. Davis did not see who threw her in the water; he just heard \r\n  a big splash. \r\n\r\nBobby Ransom's Testimony\r\n\r\nBobby Ransom testified Davis and Stuckey invited \r\n  him to the cookout and pushed him to the trailer in his wheelchair. Graham, \r\n  Pearson, Walls, Alfonzo, Leroy, and Betty Lou Caulder were outside the trailer \r\n  cooking, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana and crack cocaine. When Ransom \r\n  approached the others, Stuckey asked if he wanted to see \"that 'ol gal\" they \r\n  had inside the trailer. Caulder and Stuckey helped Ransom into the trailer, \r\n  where he saw Victim on the couch opposite the front door, bound with tape on \r\n  her face and hands. She was alive and her eyes were open. Ransom recalled, \"then \r\n  I spoke up and told them that they needed to move that girl laying on that couch \r\n  like that. And I was implicating it to Ricky Stuckey, but there was three or \r\n  four in there like I named while ago.\" Stuckey asked for and received help to \r\n  move Victim to the back of the trailer. \r\n\r\nRansom eventually went home but returned later, \r\n  at Stuckey and Davis' invitation, for a party. In addition to Davis and Stuckey, \r\n  he saw Leroy, McIntosh, Walls, Pearson, Graham, and Caulder there. He was asked \r\n  if he wanted to see Victim again. Several of the others helped him to the bedroom \r\n  door. He saw Victim on the bed, bound as before. Then someone in the group touched \r\n  Ransom and asked if he wanted \"some,\" indicating he could have sex with her. \r\n  Ransom began \"shaking and bouncing\" and asked to be taken back to his wheelchair. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRansom returned to the party and later asked if \r\n  someone could give him a ride home. When asked why he wanted to go home, he \r\n  said \"because everybody here is going to be in trouble with that girl there \r\n  like that.\" He was then told to get in Pearson's car. Stuckey and some others \r\n  were talking when Ransom added that Victim should never have been brought to \r\n  the trailer and repeated his belief that all of the partygoers were going to \r\n  be in trouble. He overheard Stuckey and two others talking about taking Victim \r\n  to a house where Stuckey formerly lived. Davis agreed to go with Ransom to help \r\n  him back inside his home and the two got in the car. Then two men walked Victim \r\n  out of the trailer and put her in the car. Pearson, Stuckey, and Walls got in \r\n  the car. Instead of taking Ransom home, they drove to an abandoned house where \r\n  two of them placed Victim on a couch on the porch and carried her inside. Pearson, \r\n  Stuckey, Walls, and Davis left her there alive, took Ransom home, and returned \r\n  to the party. \r\n\r\nThe next night, Davis, Pearson, and Stuckey came \r\n  to Ransom's home. Stuckey mentioned they still had Victim. Ransom suggested \r\n  they turn her loose out in the country somewhere, maybe on Burnt Factory Road. \r\n  Stuckey asked what they were going to do about her and then asked Pearson to \r\n  go get the car. Ransom told Stuckey and Davis he thought they \"were in a mess.\" \r\n  Stuckey asked Ransom and Davis to ride with him and they got in the car with \r\n  Pearson, who was driving, Alfonzo, and Leroy. \r\n\r\nPearson drove the group to the abandoned house \r\n  where Victim was left the evening before. Ransom saw Walls and McIntosh coming \r\n  out of the house onto the porch as they arrived. Some of the men got out of \r\n  the car, had a discussion on the steps, and went inside the house. They emerged \r\n  shortly thereafter, \"toting\" Victim, and put her in the backseat between Ransom \r\n  and Davis. Everyone else got in the car and someone said they should go to Burnt \r\n  Factory Road. Ransom would not look at Victim but at one point became agitated \r\n  and exclaimed, \"someone get this bitch from crying all over on me; I can't take \r\n  it.\" Some of the others laughed at Ransom when Stuckey repeated his request. \r\n  Stuckey told Davis to move Victim's head off Ransom, and he did. At trial, Ransom \r\n  testified he thought at the time she was crying and talking. In retrospect he \r\n  believed she was not, but that he \"was just out of it.\" \r\n\r\nPearson drove them to a bridge by the creek. When \r\n  they stopped, someone said \"everybody get out.\" Ransom was the last one out, \r\n  getting out of the car only after someone dragged Victim out by her feet. As \r\n  he pulled himself up out of the car, he saw something hitting the water. He \r\n  looked to see where everybody was and then realized it must have been Victim \r\n  in the water. \r\n\r\nJerry Ward's Testimony\r\n\r\nFinally, the State called Jerry Ward, who was in \r\n  jail with Pearson and several of his co-defendants while they awaited trial. \r\n  Ward testified he overheard Walls and Pearson arguing over which one of them \r\n  had sex with Victim first. Stuckey, on the other hand, claimed he did not have \r\n  sex with her but said he watched while Pearson did. When asked whether Stuckey \r\n  and Walls ever told him how Victim \"got tied up,\" Ward stated they told him \r\n  that after Victim was taken to the abandoned house they returned with Pearson, \r\n  who went inside and taped Victim up while they waited outside in the car. They \r\n  said Pearson taped her up because she was making noises. Eventually, Victim's \r\n  face was taped up, although Ward did not know when. \r\n   (6) \r\n\r\nAfter the State rested, appellants and Graham moved \r\n  for directed verdicts. The trial court denied each directed verdict motion. \r\n  \r\n\r\nDefense Cases\r\n\r\nStuckey called his girlfriend, Myra Bennett, who \r\n  testified she never saw any girl tied up at his trailer. Stuckey testified he \r\n  spent every day or every other night with Bennett in November of 1994. He further \r\n  testified he and Pearson did not \"hang out\" after a falling out they had in \r\n  late 1993 or early 1994. Stuckey admitted to having a cookout at his trailer. \r\n  He denied having a girl taped up inside, however, and claimed he did not hear \r\n  about Victim's murder until Pearson's arrest. Martin McIntosh, Leroy Staton, \r\n  and Robert Graham also testified and offered witnesses in their defense. Jeffery \r\n  Walls and Alfonzo Staton presented no evidence. \r\n\r\nThe jury found Leroy, Stuckey, Walls, and McIntosh \r\n  guilty as charged; Alfonzo not guilty of CSC but guilty on the remaining charges; \r\n  and Graham guilty only of criminal conspiracy. The trial court sentenced each \r\n  to life imprisonment for murder and five concurrent years for conspiracy. Graham \r\n  also received a five year sentence for conspiracy. Each appellant convicted \r\n  of CSC received a consecutive thirty year sentence. Because each appellant was \r\n  convicted and sentenced for murder, the trial court declined to impose any sentence \r\n  for the kidnapping conviction in compliance with South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-3-910 (Supp. 2000). This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in refusing their requests for separate trials. We find no error. \r\n\r\nI. Severance\r\n\r\n Motions for severance are addressed to the discretion \r\n  of the trial court. State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 122, 481 S.E.2d 118, 124 \r\n  (1997). \"A severance should be granted only when there is a serious risk that \r\n  a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of a co-defendant or prevent \r\n  the jury from making a reliable judgment about a co-defendant's guilt.\" Hughes \r\n  v. State, Op.&nbsp;No. 25348 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Aug. 27, 2001) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 39, 42) (emphasis removed). \"A proper cautionary instruction \r\n  may help protect the individual rights of each defendant and ensure that no \r\n  prejudice results from a joint trial.\" Id. \"An appellate court should not reverse \r\n  a conviction achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a reasonable probability \r\n  that the defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate \r\n  trial.\" Id. (citing People v. Greenberger, 68 Cal. Rptr. 2d 61, 86 (Cal. App. \r\n  1997)); see also State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 281-82, 523 S.E.2d 173, 176 \r\n  (1999) (the denial of a severance motion will not be reversed absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion and a showing of resulting prejudice). Furthermore, as murder \r\n  co-defendants, appellants were not entitled to separate trials by right. State \r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 73, 502 S.E.2d 63, 75 (1998).\r\n\r\nFirst, we reject the argument asserted by several \r\n  of the appellants that the joint trial resulted in a \"spill-over effect\" from \r\n  evidence admitted against other co-defendants. Because the State alleged the \r\n  men conspired and acted in concert to commit the substantive crimes charged, \r\n  all of the State's evidence admitted in their joint trial would have been admissible \r\n  against each of them if they had been granted separate trials. See State v. \r\n  Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1993) (noting the State is granted \r\n  great latitude in introducing circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy from its \r\n  commencement to its conclusion and that substantive crimes committed in furtherance \r\n  of the conspiracy constitute circumstantial evidence of the conspiracy's existence, \r\n  object, and scope); State v. Mikell, 257 S.C. 315, 324, 185 S.E.2d 814, 817-18 \r\n  (1971) (acts and statements of a co-conspirator made in furtherance and during \r\n  a conspiracy are admissible to prove the existence of a conspiracy); Rule 801(d)(2)(E), \r\n  SCRE (statements of a co-conspirator during the course of and in furtherance \r\n  of the conspiracy are by definition not hearsay). Indeed, had the court granted \r\n  the motions, the result would have been multiple presentations of the State's \r\n  entire case, including the lengthy testimony of the two primary witnesses, Davis \r\n  and Ransom.\r\n\r\nAppellants also contend their joint trial caused \r\n  confusion and permitted the jury to consider the guilt of each individual in \r\n  a vague way. Essentially, appellants argue the jury could not distinguish between \r\n  the individual defendants in reaching its numerous verdicts. However, the trial \r\n  court repeatedly instructed the jury to consider the evidence separately as \r\n  to each defendant. Our supreme court has previously held such cautionary instructions \r\n  \"may help protect the individual rights of each defendant and ensure that no \r\n  prejudice results from a joint trial.\" State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. at 280, 523 \r\n  S.E.2d at 176; see also State v. Holland, 261 S.C. 488, 494, 201 S.E.2d 118, \r\n  121 (1973) (holding trial court's cautionary instructions to the jury in a joint \r\n  trial \"protected the rights of each individual appellant . . . .\"). The jury \r\n  obviously followed these instructions, as its return of twenty guilty verdicts \r\n  and three not guilty verdicts demonstrates it was able to make the very distinctions \r\n  appellants claim impossible.\r\n\r\nIn summary, no appellant points to a specific trial \r\n  right which was violated by the joint trial. The appellants have also failed \r\n  to demonstrate their joint trial prevented the jury from making a reliable judgment \r\n  on any one defendant's guilt. Thus, because none of the appellants have shown \r\n  that a separate trial would have resulted in a more favorable result, we affirm \r\n  the trial court's decision to proceed with a joint trial. \r\n\r\nII. Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nStuckey contends the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to grant a directed verdict in his favor on each of the charges against him. \r\n  As to the substantive charges, Stuckey does not dispute that these crimes occurred, \r\n  but rather that the State failed to establish his legal culpability in them. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the \r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not \r\n  with its weight. State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 270, 531 S.E.2d 512, 514 (2000). \r\n  The court should grant the motion if the evidence \"merely raises a suspicion \r\n  that the accused is guilty.\" State v. Ballington, 346 S.C. 262, ___, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  280, 285 (Ct. App. 2001), petition for cert. filed (Sept. 21, 2001); see also \r\n  State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 132, 322 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1984). However, the \r\n  court should deny the motion and submit the case to the jury if there is \"any \r\n  direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends \r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly or \r\n  logically deduced.\" Fennell, 340 S.C. at 270, 531 S.E.2d at 514. On review of \r\n  the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, this court must view the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to the State and if there is any direct evidence \r\n  or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the accused's \r\n  guilt, we must find the trial court properly submitted the case to the jury. \r\n  Id.\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State, and without passing on its weight, we find no error in the trial \r\n  court's decision to submit Stuckey's entire case to the jury. \r\n   (7)\r\n\r\nA. Kidnapping  \r\n\r\n\r\nKidnapping occurs when a person unlawfully seizes, \r\n  confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away any other person \r\n  by any means without authority of the law. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (Supp. \r\n  2000). Kidnapping is a continuing offense, which \"commences when one is wrongfully \r\n  deprived of freedom and continues until freedom is restored.\" State v. Tucker, \r\n  334 S.C. 1, 13, 512 S.E.2d 99, 105 (1999).\r\n\r\nAlthough the evidence presented does not establish \r\n  whether Stuckey participated in Victim's initial seizure or confinement, the \r\n  State offered ample evidence that he participated in her ongoing kidnapping, \r\n  which lasted until the time of her death. State v. Jefferies, 316 S.C. 13, 23 \r\n  n.12, 446 S.E.2d 427, 433 n.12 (1994) (noting \"'kidnapping is a continuing offense \r\n  as long as the kidnapped person is deprived of his freedom'\") (citation omitted). \r\n  Ward, Stuckey's fellow inmate, testified Stuckey admitted watching Pearson have \r\n  sex with Victim while she was kidnapped. At some point after she was initially \r\n  abducted, Victim was taken to Stuckey's trailer, where she was held bound and \r\n  gagged. Stuckey held a cookout and party while she was held there and invited \r\n  Ransom to come inside and look at her. When Ransom expressed concern about her \r\n  being on the couch directly across from the front door, Stuckey instructed others \r\n  to move her to the bedroom, which was better hidden from view. Davis testified \r\n  Stuckey, along with Pearson, moved her from the trailer to the abandoned house, \r\n  where she was left. While in jail awaiting trial, Stuckey and Walls admitted \r\n  to Ward they later returned to the house with Pearson and waited while he taped \r\n  Victim up some more to prevent her from making noises. Finally, Stuckey returned \r\n  to the house with the others and, together with Pearson, personally went inside \r\n  and retrieved Victim. They then laid her in the car and drove her to the creek.\r\n\r\nThough it is contradicted by other evidence, Ransom's \r\n  statement about Victim crying on him during the car ride to the creek constitutes \r\n  direct evidence she was alive during at least part of that journey. \r\n   (8) \r\nBecause this evidence reasonably tends to prove \r\n  Stuckey actively participated in Victim's ongoing kidnapping, the trial court \r\n  properly denied his directed verdict motion on this charge. \r\n\r\nFirst Degree Criminal Sexual \r\n  Conduct\r\n\r\nAny person who commits a sexual battery upon a \r\n  victim is guilty of criminal sexual conduct if one or more of the following \r\n  circumstances are present:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (a) The actor uses aggravated force to accomplish \r\n    sexual battery.\r\n\r\n  (b) The victim submits to sexual battery by the \r\n    actor under circumstances where the victim is also the victim of forcible \r\n    confinement, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, burglary, housebreaking, or any \r\n    other similar offense or act.\r\n\r\n  (c) The actor causes the victim, without the victim's \r\n    consent, to become mentally incapacitated or physically helpless by administering, \r\n    distributing, dispensing, delivering, or causing to be administered, distributed, \r\n    dispensed, or delivered a controlled substance, a controlled substance analogue, \r\n    or any intoxicating substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652(1) (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nThe evidence also supports the trial court's refusal \r\n  to grant Stuckey a directed verdict on the CSC charge. According to Ward's testimony, \r\n  Stuckey admitted he watched Pearson sexually assault Victim while she was kidnapped. \r\n  Stuckey held a party at his home where Victim was being held and at least once \r\n  invited Ransom to come look at her. Later, he either invited Ransom to have \r\n  sex with her or stood by as others did. The evidence reveals Stuckey orchestrated \r\n  or at minimum permitted others to hold Victim at his home as a sex-slave to \r\n  partygoers and friends. Although the State presented no evidence Stuckey personally \r\n  sexually assaulted Victim, the trial court properly submitted this charge to \r\n  the jury because the State introduced sufficient evidence he either aided and \r\n  abetted others in sexually assaulting Victim or that he joined with others to \r\n  commit the same. See State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 45, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 \r\n  (1999) (holding that any person, who aids, abets, and encourages another in \r\n  and is present during the commission of a crime is guilty as a principal); S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-40 (Supp. 2000) (\"A person who aids in the commission of a \r\n  felony or is an accessory before the fact in the commission of a felony by counseling, \r\n  hiring, or otherwise procuring the felony to be committed is guilty of a felony \r\n  and upon conviction, must be punished in the manner prescribed for the punishment \r\n  of the principal felon.\"); State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 648, 515 S.E.2d 98, \r\n  101 (1999) (holding that under the \"hand of one, the hand of all\" theory, \"one \r\n  who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally \r\n  for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common \r\n  design and purpose.\"). \r\n\r\nMurder \r\n\"'Murder' is the killing of any person with malice \r\n  aforethought, either express or implied.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (1985). \"'Malice' \r\n  is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved \r\n  spirit intent on doing wrong.\" State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d \r\n  63, 69 (1998). \r\n\r\nThe State also presented sufficient evidence to \r\n  allow Stuckey's murder charge to go to the jury. Stuckey told others at the \r\n  garage he wanted \"that bitch\" out of his trailer. The evening after he and Pearson \r\n  took Victim, alive, to the abandoned house, Stuckey told Ransom and Davis that \r\n  they still had Victim and needed to do something with her or they were all \"going \r\n  to be in trouble.\" When they returned to the house that evening, Pearson and \r\n  Stuckey went inside. When they brought her out, her face was completely bound \r\n  with duct tape. Stuckey's statement to Ransom that he did not have to worry \r\n  about Victim bothering him because she was already dead indicates he knew she \r\n  could not breathe with the duct tape applied so tightly to her face. The evidence \r\n  concerning Stuckey's actions and words constitutes substantial evidence that \r\n  he participated in Victim's murder, combined with others to murder her, or aided \r\n  and abetted one or more persons in murdering her. See Burdette, 335 S.C. at \r\n  45, 515 S.E.2d at 531(aiding and abetting); Langley, 334 S.C. at 548, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  at 101 (hand of one, the hand of all). The trial court properly denied Stuckey's \r\n  motion for a directed verdict on this charge. \r\n\r\nCriminal Conspiracy\r\n\r\nConspiracy is the \"combination between two or more \r\n  persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or lawful object \r\n  by unlawful means.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (Supp. 2000); see also State \r\n  v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 133-34, 437 S.E.2d 75, 80 (1993). The gravamen of conspiracy \r\n  is an agreement or combination. Id. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80. However, a formal \r\n  agreement is not necessary to establish a conspiracy, as the conspiracy may \r\n  be proven by \"circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the parties.\" State \r\n  v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 334, 457 S.E.2d 616, 622 (Ct. App. 1995); see State \r\n  v. Mouzon, 321 S.C. 27, 32, 467 S.E.2d 122, 125 (Ct. App. 1995) (the substantive \r\n  crimes themselves constitute circumstantial evidence of the existence, scope, \r\n  and object of the conspiracy). \"'What is needed is proof they intended to act \r\n  together for their shared mutual benefit within the scope of the conspiracy \r\n  charged.'\" Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80-81 (quoting United States&nbsp;v. \r\n  Evans, 970 F.2d 663 (10th Cir. 1992)). \r\n\r\nThe evidence of Stuckey's participation in these \r\n  substantive crimes with Pearson, the other appellants, and others, combined \r\n  with his own words about Victim, are more than sufficient evidence of his guilt \r\n  on the conspiracy charge. State&nbsp;v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  864, 868 (1993) (conspiracy does not require overt acts but may be proven by \r\n  overt acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, including commission of the \r\n  substantive crimes). \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in \r\n  refusing to grant appellants' motions for separate trials. The court also properly \r\n  refused to grant Stuckey's directed verdict motions. Accordingly, his convictions \r\n  are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  We address the severance \r\n  issue as it applies to all appellants in this opinion. Each of Stuckey's co-appellant's \r\n  other issues are addressed in separate opinions.  \r\n2.  A number of other people \r\n  were charged in connection with these crimes, including Ringo Pearson. Some \r\n  of the other people charged, including certain State witnesses, pled guilty \r\n  to various offenses.  \r\n3.  Pearson referred to Victim \r\n  by her first name.  \r\n4.  Jeffrey denied telling police \r\n  that Leroy invited him to \"get a piece,\" but admitted the comments were included \r\n  in his statement.  \r\n5.  Davis testified at a prior \r\n  hearing that Victim was not moving or breathing in the car.  \r\n6.  Ward's testimony is also \r\n  unclear as to who taped Victim's face.  \r\n7.  Stuckey and his co-defendants \r\n  challenged Davis' and Ransom's credibility as well as the accuracy of their \r\n  accounts. The appellants, including Stuckey, have maintained this challenge \r\n  to this court. Because we consider only the existence of evidence in reviewing \r\n  the denial of a directed verdict, however, witness credibility is not a proper \r\n  inquiry for our consideration. Id. (upon review of the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict, the appellate court must consider the existence of evidence rather \r\n  than its weight); State v. Scott, 330 S.C. 125, 131 n.4, 497 S.E.2d 735, 738 \r\n  n.4 (Ct. App. 1998) (on appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, issues \r\n  of witness credibility are solely for the jury, not the appellate court).  \r\n8.  Direct evidence is \"evidence \r\n  based on actual knowledge and proves a fact without inference or presumption.\" \r\n  State v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520, 524 n.1, 541 S.E.2d 247, 248-49 n.1 (2001). \r\n  Circumstantial evidence \"immediately establishes collateral facts from which \r\n  the main fact may be inferred, and is typically characterized by inference or \r\n  presumption.\" Id. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3405","title":"State v.

Martin claims the \r\n  trial court erred in admitting evidence seized in the execution of a search \r\n  warrant that he contends lacked sufficient probable cause to support issuance. \r\n  He further contends the trial court erred in allowing the admission of his prior \r\n  drug offenses and in allowing the solicitor to cross- examine him as to his \r\n  marijuana use. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nBased on information from a confidential informant, the \r\n  Gaffney City Police Department executed a search warrant on Martin's home on \r\n  February 4, 1999. One of the police officers found marijuana in Martin's pants \r\n  pocket. Martin went to trial on January 18, 2000. At trial, he sought to suppress \r\n  the marijuana seized, asserting a deficiency in the search warrant affidavit \r\n  as to the informant's credibility and reliability. He further sought to exclude \r\n  evidence of his prior convictions pursuant to Rule 609, SCRE, as well as evidence \r\n  of his prior drug use. The trial judge ruled against Martin on all three issues, \r\n  and Martin was convicted of possession of marijuana and sentenced to one year \r\n  imprisonment.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Validity of Search Warrant\r\n\r\nMartin argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion \r\n  to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the February 4, 1999 search. Specifically, \r\n  Martin asserts the search warrant affidavit was insufficient on its face to \r\n  establish probable cause inasmuch as it failed to establish the credibility \r\n  or reliability of the confidential informant. He further contends the affidavit \r\n  was not properly supplemented by sworn oral testimony. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on the motion to suppress, Detective Sergeant \r\n  Billy Gene Odom of the Gaffney City Police Department testified he appeared \r\n  before Magistrate Robert B. Howell on February 1, 1999, and presented an affidavit \r\n  to obtain a search warrant for Martin's residence. The affidavit provided, in \r\n  pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\nREASON FOR AFFIANT'S BELIEF THAT THE PROPERTY \r\n  SOUGHT IS ON THE SUBJECT PREMISES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Affiant's belief is based upon information received from \r\n    a Confidential Reliable Informant who has provided information in the past \r\n    that has proven true and correct. This C.R.I. states that he/she has seen \r\n    a quantity of marijuana at the above described location within the past 72 \r\n    hours. Affiant knows this C.R.I. to know marijuana when seen by past information \r\n    received from this C.R.I. \r\n\r\n\r\nA search warrant may be issued only upon a finding of probable \r\n  cause. State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999). \r\n  Great deference must be given to a magistrate's conclusions as to whether probable \r\n  cause exists to issue a search warrant. State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, \r\n  290, 494 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1997). Nonetheless, the magistrate may issue the warrant \r\n  \"only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate . . . establishing the grounds \r\n  for the warrant.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985).\r\n\r\n\"[A] warrant based solely on information provided by a confidential \r\n  informant must contain information supporting the credibility of the informant \r\n  and the basis of his knowledge.\" State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, \r\n  338 S.C. 176, 192, 525 S.E.2d 872, 881 (2000). In determining the validity of \r\n  the warrant, a reviewing court may consider only information brought to the \r\n  magistrate's attention. State v. Owen, 275 S.C. 586, 588, 274 S.E.2d \r\n  510, 511 (1981).\r\n\r\nA \"totality of the circumstances\" test is applicable in \r\n  determining whether sufficient probable cause exists to issue a search warrant: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, \r\n    common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the \r\n    affidavit before him, including the \"veracity\" and \"basis of knowledge\" of \r\n    persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband \r\n    or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\r\n\r\n\r\nBellamy, 336 S.C. at 143, 519 S.E.2d at 348 (quoting \r\n  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)). \"Under the 'totality of \r\n  the circumstances' test, a reviewing court considers all circumstances, including \r\n  the status, the basis of knowledge, and the veracity of the informant, when \r\n  determining whether or not probable cause existed to issue a search warrant.\" \r\n  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 679 (2000). \"[A] deficiency \r\n  in one of the elements [of veracity and reliability] may be compensated for, \r\n  in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to the \r\n  other, or by some other indicia of reliability.\" Bellamy, 336 S.C. at \r\n  144, 519 S.E.2d at 349.\r\n\r\nHere, the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding \r\n  marijuana would be discovered in a search of appellant's home. The affidavit \r\n  advised the magistrate that the confidential informant previously provided Odom \r\n  with true and correct information, thus establishing the informant's veracity \r\n  and reliability. The affidavit also specifically set forth the informant's firsthand \r\n  knowledge of the marijuana in Martin's home, as well as indicated the affiant \r\n  knew the informant to know marijuana, based on information previously received \r\n  from the informant. Although Martin correctly notes the affidavit does not specify \r\n  what reliable information the informant had provided in the past, and the affidavit \r\n  does not indicate the informant's prior information had led to arrests or convictions, \r\n  the affidavit does specifically indicate the informant's past information proved \r\n  to be true. (1) We therefore conclude, under \r\n  the totality of the circumstances test, the affidavit provided the magistrate \r\n  with information sufficient to make a probable cause determination.\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, the search warrant affidavit was insufficient \r\n  on its face to establish probable cause, we nonetheless find the affidavit was \r\n  properly supplemented by sworn oral testimony. See State v. Jones, 342 \r\n  S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678-679 (2000) (\"Oral testimony may also be used \r\n  in this state to supplement search warrant affidavits which are facially insufficient \r\n  to establish probable cause.\"). The record indicates Detective Odom provided \r\n  the magistrate with oral testimony as to the reliability and veracity of the \r\n  confidential informant. Detective Odom testified that whenever he appears before \r\n  Magistrate Howell to obtain a search warrant based on information from an informant, \r\n  the magistrate has the practice of asking a certain group of questions, including \r\n  whether the police have used the informant before and, if so, whether use of \r\n  the informant was successful. He also asks when drugs were last seen in, or \r\n  purchased from, the particular residence. He further testified this informant \r\n  had gone to the residence on two occasions to make a controlled buy while wearing \r\n  a wire, the first time being a week prior to issuance of the search warrant \r\n  and the second time within seventy-two hours before signing of the search warrant. \r\n  Detective Odom knew the informant was able to identify marijuana, in part, because \r\n  when he sent the informant in on a controlled buy, the informant brought back \r\n  marijuana. His response to Magistrate Howell's questions would have been to \r\n  state that, within the past seventy-two hours, marijuana had been seen and purchased \r\n  from the residence.\r\n\r\nMagistrate Howell confirmed he asks four standard questions \r\n  whenever a police officer presents a search warrant for his signature: (1) whether \r\n  the police have used the informant before; (2) whether use of the informant \r\n  has been productive in the past; (3) when narcotics were last seen in the residence; \r\n  and (4) when a purchase of narcotics was last made at the residence. Although \r\n  neither Detective Odom nor Magistrate Howell was able to recall the specifics \r\n  of Odom's appearance before the magistrate in this specific case, Magistrate \r\n  Howell stated he would not have signed the search warrant had he not been satisfied \r\n  with Detective Odom's answers to his four standard questions. He further stated \r\n  he asks those \"same four questions on every search warrant\" he executes, and \r\n  he could state with \"absolute certainty\" that he did so on this particular occasion.\r\n\r\nBased on our review of the record, we are convinced the \r\n  sworn oral testimony before the magistrate sufficiently supplemented the search \r\n  warrant affidavit to establish any deficiency that might exist in the affidavit \r\n  as to the veracity and reliability of the informant. Accordingly, we find no \r\n  error in the admission of the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant. \r\n  \r\n\r\nII. Evidence of Prior Convictions\r\n\r\nMartin next asserts the trial court erred in ruling evidence \r\n  of his prior convictions could be used to impeach his testimony because the \r\n  court failed to properly weigh the probative value of his prior convictions \r\n  against the prejudicial effect of the evidence. We agree.\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, evidence that an accused has \r\n  been convicted of a crime, which was punishable by death or imprisonment in \r\n  excess of one year, is admissible for impeachment if the court determines the \r\n  probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect \r\n  to the accused. The party attempting to introduce the prior conviction for impeachment \r\n  purposes has the initial burden of establishing the basis for its admission. \r\n  State v. Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 340, 529 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n  Rule 609(a)(1) requires the trial judge to balance the probative value of the \r\n  evidence for impeachment purposes against the prejudice to the accused. Id. \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 627, 525 S.E.2d 246, \r\n  248 (2000), our Supreme Court expressly approved the five-factor analysis generally \r\n  employed by federal courts for weighing the probative value for impeachment \r\n  of prior convictions against the prejudice to the accused, but recognized there \r\n  may be other factors which a trial judge should, in the exercise of discretion, \r\n  consider under the facts and circumstances of each particular case. These factors \r\n  include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The impeachment value of the prior crime. \r\n\r\n   2. The point in time of the conviction and the witness's \r\n    subsequent history. \r\n\r\n   3. The similarity between the past crime and the charged \r\n    crime. \r\n\r\n   4. The importance of the defendant's testimony. \r\n\r\n   5. The centrality of the credibility issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. While Colf involved the admission of prior \r\n  convictions more than ten years old under Rule 609(b), SCRE, this court has \r\n  implicitly recognized the value of these factors in making such a determination \r\n  under Rule 609(a)(1), and urged the trial bench to not only articulate its ruling, \r\n  but also provide \"the basis for it, thereby clearly and easily informing the \r\n  appellate courts that a meaningful balancing of the probative value and the \r\n  prejudicial effect has taken place as required by Rule 609(a)(1).\" Scriven, \r\n  339 S.C. at 342, 529 S.E.2d at 75-76. Further, our Supreme Court has expressly \r\n  recognized the importance of the factors in a Rule 609(a)(1) analysis. In Green \r\n  v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433-34, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000), the court stated \r\n  that the above five factors, \"along with any other relevant factors, should \r\n  be considered\" when the trial courts \"weigh the probative value of the prior \r\n  convictions against their prejudicial effect to the accused and determine, in \r\n  their discretion, whether to admit the evidence.\"\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the State sought to introduce Martin's \r\n  prior convictions which were less than ten years old. The record shows Martin \r\n  was convicted of PWID Valium on January 29, 1990, PWID Xanax and felony DUI \r\n  in September of 1991, and possession of crack cocaine in 1995. He also had two \r\n  convictions for possession of marijuana, one of which occurred in 1995. The \r\n  trial court ruled the possession of marijuana charges were inadmissible, finding \r\n  they carried a sentence of one year or less, and that their prejudicial effect \r\n  would outweigh any probative value. The court determined the State could, however, \r\n  introduce evidence of Martin's convictions for PWID Valium, possession of crack \r\n  cocaine, and felony DUI if Martin took the stand. The court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The concern I have is if he's going to take the stand and \r\n    tell his story, give his side of the thing, the jury's entitled to know. Otherwise, \r\n    if they're not able to present any prior offenses in the past, then they have \r\n    a right to assume that he has no prior record whatsoever and that he has a \r\n    clean record and that concerns the court, because that would not be - - you \r\n    know, I think they're entitled to know if he has these other charges, you \r\n    know, which might effect his propensity for truth telling.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin took the stand and defense counsel, based on the \r\n  trial court's ruling, brought out Martin's convictions for PWID Valium, PWID \r\n  Xanax, felony DUI, and possession of crack.\r\n\r\nMartin asserts the trial court reached its ruling on this \r\n  issue without articulating the required balancing test to determine whether \r\n  the probative value of the convictions would outweigh their prejudicial effect. \r\n  We agree. \r\n\r\nAlthough the trial judge specifically stated he would not \r\n  allow admission of Martin's prior marijuana convictions because the prejudicial \r\n  value would outweigh any probative value, he made no meaningful analysis of \r\n  the other convictions he allowed before the jury. The only basis the trial judge \r\n  provided for his ruling was that Martin's convictions \"might effect his propensity \r\n  for truth telling.\" However, this is not necessarily so. See State \r\n  v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 34, 538 S.E.2d 248, 255 (2000) (\"Narcotics offenses \r\n  are generally not considered probative of truthfulness.\"). Further, at least \r\n  three of the convictions were for crimes similar to that for which Martin stood \r\n  trial, and three were fairly remote in time, two of the convictions being more \r\n  than eight and a half years old, and one conviction being just weeks shy of \r\n  falling under the ten-year time limit imposed by Rule 609(b), SCRE. Indeed, \r\n  in reviewing the court's ruling on the matter, it appears the fact that Martin \r\n  had prior convictions which fell within a ten-year time period simply satisfied \r\n  the trial judge that the convictions should be admitted.\r\n\r\nFinally, as in Scriven, 339 S.C. at 342-43, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  at 76, we note the State made no presentation as to the probative value of the \r\n  convictions in support of their admission, and it does not appear the court \r\n  properly applied the burden of establishing a basis for their admission. Based \r\n  on the record before us, we cannot conclude any meaningful balancing of the \r\n  probative value and prejudicial effect of these convictions has taken place \r\n  as required by Rule 609(a)(1). (2) Further, given \r\n  the remoteness of the convictions and the similarity between the prior convictions \r\n  and the crime charged, we cannot conclude the admission of these convictions \r\n  was harmless error. We therefore remand this issue to the trial court for a \r\n  hearing on the admissibility of each of Martin's prior convictions, with instructions \r\n  for the trial judge to apply the proper burden of establishing admissibility, \r\n  and carefully weigh the probative value of the prior convictions for impeachment \r\n  purposes against their prejudicial effect. See Colf, 337 S.C. \r\n  622, 629, 525 S.E.2d 246, 249 (2000); Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 344, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 71, 77 (2000) (appellate court should not undertake a rule 609 balancing \r\n  test, but should remand the issue to the trial court).\r\n\r\nIII. Evidence of Marijuana Use\r\n\r\nMartin also contends the trial court erred in allowing the \r\n  State to cross-examine him on his use of marijuana because he did not place \r\n  his character into issue. We find no error.\r\n\r\nPrior to Martin's testimony in his own defense, his attorney \r\n  moved in limine  to preclude the State from introducing evidence of his \r\n  marijuana use. The court ruled the State could cross-examine Martin about his \r\n  marijuana use if he denied being in possession of marijuana on the night of \r\n  his arrest. The court found Martin's denial of possession of marijuana would \r\n  open the door to testimony about his marijuana use and that such evidence would \r\n  be relevant, with the probative value outweighing any prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\nDuring his direct examination, Martin testified, when officers \r\n  came to his residence on February 4, he was present along with three other people. \r\n  At the time, he was sitting on a couch with another person whom he really did \r\n  not know. He denied that the marijuana found by the police \r\n  was his, or that it was found on his person, claiming the marijuana was actually \r\n  found \"under the couch.\" On cross examination, Martin admitted to smoking marijuana \r\n  on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nGenerally, evidence is relevant and admissible if it has \r\n  any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the \r\n  determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be \r\n  without the evidence. Rules 401, 402, SCRE. Even if evidence is relevant, it \r\n  may be excluded if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its \r\n  probative value. Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 35, 538 \r\n  S.E.2d 248, 256 (2000). Although evidence of other bad acts is inadmissible \r\n  to demonstrate a person's character in order to show action in conformity with \r\n  that character, such evidence is admissible to show motive, identity, the existence \r\n  of a common scheme or plan, absence of accident or mistake, or intent. Rule \r\n  404(b), SCRE; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923). A trial \r\n  judge has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and \r\n  his decision will not be disturbed absent prejudicial abuse of discretion. State \r\n  v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, we find evidence of Martin's marijuana \r\n  use was logically relevant and admissible, not to impugn his character, but \r\n  rather to establish his motive, as well as his intent for possessing marijuana. \r\n  See State v. Gilchrist, 329 S.C. 621, 626, 496 S.E.2d 424, 427 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998) (\"Evidence of prior drug use is competent to establish motive \r\n  for a crime where the record supports a logical relevance between the drug use \r\n  and crime for which the defendant is accused.\"); State v. Gore, 299 S.C. \r\n  368, 370, 384 S.E.2d 750, 751 (1989) (evidence that appellant sold cocaine from \r\n  the same trailer on two prior occasions only one month earlier was admissible \r\n  to establish his intent regarding his possession of cocaine at the time in question).\r\n\r\nMartin admitted the marijuana was found in his residence, \r\n  but maintained that it was not found on his person and did not belong to him. \r\n  Accordingly, the State responded with evidence as to Martin's motive and intent \r\n  in regard to the marijuana found in his residence. Conviction of possession \r\n  requires proof of possession, either actual or constructive, coupled with knowledge \r\n  of the drug's presence. State v. Hudson, 277 S.C. 200, 284 S.E.2d 773 \r\n  (1981). \"Possession requires more than mere presence. The State must show the \r\n  defendant had dominion or control over the thing allegedly possessed or had \r\n  the right to exercise dominion or control over it.\" State v. Muhammed, \r\n  338 S.C. 22, 27, 524 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 1999). Here, the State was required \r\n  to establish Martin either had, or at least had the right to exercise, dominion \r\n  and control over the marijuana discovered in his home, and that he had knowledge \r\n  of the presence of the marijuana. The jury could have believed that Martin did \r\n  not have knowledge and/or possession of the drug, but that it was actually possessed \r\n  by someone else present at the scene. Under these circumstances, the evidence \r\n  of Martin's prior use of marijuana was relevant and admissible to show his knowledge \r\n  of the presence of the drug, and his intent to possess it. See State \r\n  v. Moseley, 119 Ariz. 393, 581 P.2d 238 (1978) (wherein Supreme Court of \r\n  Arizona held, in face of prior bad act challenge, evidence of \"track marks\" \r\n  on defendants' arms, and resulting inference of prior narcotic use by injection, \r\n  was admissible where defense advanced theory that drugs found in defendant's \r\n  presence were under the dominion and control of another, as the evidence was \r\n  relevant and admissible to show defendant's knowledge, as well as his intent \r\n  to possess the drugs). Accordingly, we find no error in the admission of this \r\n  evidence.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Cherry raises six issues \r\non appeal. A three-judge panel of this court was unanimous in rejecting four of \r\nthe six issues raised by Cherry, but was divided on the remaining two. One judge \r\nvoted to affirm the conviction, one voted to reverse based on Cherry's entitlement \r\nto a directed verdict, and the third voted to reverse and grant a new trial based \r\non the inadequacy of the jury charge. See State v. Cherry, Op. No. 3296 \r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 12, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 72). Because \r\nat least two judges of the panel voted to affirm with respect to each issue, this \r\ndivision effectively resulted in an affirmance of Cherry's conviction. \r\nThis court granted en banc review, limited to reconsideration \r\n  of whether the State presented any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n  to establish Cherry's intent to distribute crack cocaine and whether the trial \r\n  court erred by failing to give a complete jury charge on circumstantial evidence. \r\n  As to the four issues about which there was no dispute on the three-judge panel, \r\n  that initial panel decision remains unmodified. The opinions of the three-judge \r\n  panel on the directed verdict and jury charge issues are hereby vacated by this \r\n  en banc disposition. The result of the en banc reconsideration is once again \r\n  a divided court, with three of our members believing the conviction should be \r\n  affirmed on both issues, four believing that Cherry was entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict of not guilty, and three convinced that the circumstantial evidence charge \r\n  was insufficient. Thus, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-90 (Supp. 2000), this \r\n  division results in an affirmance of Cherry's conviction. Â§ 14-8-90 (When the \r\n  Court of Appeals sits en banc, \"a concurrence of six of the judges is necessary \r\n  for a reversal of the judgment below.\").\r\n\r\nThis author's original opinion on the two issues upon which \r\n  en banc reconsideration was granted remains unchanged and, with minor modifications, \r\n  is repeated herein. \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nJust before midnight on July 31, 1998, Officer Steven Parker \r\n  of the Rock Hill Police Department stopped a car driven by Cherry's sister for \r\n  two traffic violations. Cherry was a passenger in the back seat. While Officer \r\n  Parker sat in his patrol car writing citations, a backup officer arrived and \r\n  saw Cherry's sister stuff a pistol into a diaper bag. After arresting her, the \r\n  officers ordered the passengers out of the car to check for additional weapons. \r\n  Cherry had no weapons, but Officer Parker discovered a small bag containing \r\n  approximately eight rocks of crack cocaine in his watch pocket. He also seized \r\n  $322 in cash from Cherry. \r\n\r\nCherry was indicted for possession of crack cocaine with \r\n  intent to distribute and possession of crack cocaine within proximity of a public \r\n  park. At the conclusion of the State's case, the trial court granted Cherry's \r\n  motion for a directed verdict on the charge of possession within proximity of \r\n  a public park. The court denied his motion for a directed verdict on the charge \r\n  of possession with intent to distribute and the jury found him guilty. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directed Verdict  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCherry argues the trial court improperly refused his motion \r\n  for a directed verdict on the charge of possession with intent to distribute \r\n  because there was no evidence he intended to distribute the crack cocaine. We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\nWhen considering a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal \r\n  case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight. State&nbsp;v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, \r\n  531 (1999); State&nbsp;v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 411, 319 S.E.2d 335, \r\n  336 (1984). It has been recently held that this remains true even when the State \r\n  relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence. State v. Mitchell, 341 \r\n  S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000). Some cases have held that if the \r\n  State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendant's \r\n  guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, \r\n  the case must go to the jury. Burdette, 335 S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at \r\n  531; State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 493, 431 S.E.2d 254, 255-56 (1993). \r\n  Other cases indicate that where the evidence is circumstantial, there must be \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the \r\n  guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced. \r\n  State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 602, 533 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2000) (citing \r\n  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996)). Still other \r\n  cases indicate some distinction between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence \r\n  in considering whether a directed verdict should be granted. State v. Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. 215, 232, 522 S.E.2d 845, 853 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"If there is any \r\n  direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably \r\n  tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and \r\n  logically deduced, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted \r\n  to the jury.\" (emphasis added)) (citing State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, \r\n  512 S.E.2d 795 (1999)). If the trial court must make a determination that the \r\n  circumstantial evidence is substantial, that would seem to require a weighing \r\n  of the evidence which, of course, all cases agree, is forbidden.\r\n\r\nClearly, the trial judge should grant a directed verdict \r\n  motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty. \r\n  Martin, 340 S.C. at 602, 533 S.E.2d at 574 (citing State v. Irvin, \r\n  270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978)). It is equally clear, however, that on \r\n  appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this court must view \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. Burdette, 335 \r\n  S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at 531.\r\n\r\nThe State submitted testimony that Cherry's arrest occurred \r\n  in a high crime area known for violence and drug activity. Cherry had a small \r\n  bag containing approximately eight rocks of crack cocaine on his person. He \r\n  had no crack pipe or other drug paraphernalia with him indicating the crack \r\n  cocaine was for his personal consumption. He did, however, have $322 cash on \r\n  his person in mostly twenty dollar bills. Officer Parker testified a single \r\n  rock of crack cocaine is typically sold for twenty dollars. Viewing this evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to the State, as we must, and without passing on \r\n  the weight of the evidence, the combination of these factors constitute evidence \r\n  which would reasonably tend to prove Cherry intended to distribute the crack \r\n  cocaine and, thus, justifies the trial court's decision to submit the case to \r\n  the jury for its determination.   \r\n  (1)  \r\n\r\n\r\n    Circumstantial Evidence Instruction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring its jury charge, the trial court issued the circumstantial \r\n  evidence instruction recently approved and recommended by our supreme court \r\n  in State&nbsp;v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997). After the \r\n  jury was charged, defense counsel requested the court issue Judge Ervin's charge \r\n  on the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. Tom J. Ervin, \r\n  Ervin's South Carolina Requests to Charge-Criminal Â§ 3-4 (1994). The \r\n  court refused to re-charge the jury as requested.\r\n\r\nWe note that Judge Ervin's model charge on circumstantial \r\n  evidence is similar to the traditional language our supreme court approved in \r\n  State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989). The traditional \r\n  charge distinguishes between direct and circumstantial evidence, whereas the \r\n  new charge adopted in Grippon specifically states there is no legal distinction \r\n  between the two types of evidence. Compare Edwards, 298 S.C. at \r\n  275, 379 S.E.2d at 889 (\"'[E]very circumstance relied upon by the State [must] \r\n  be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and . . . all of the circumstances so proven \r\n  be consistent with each other and taken together, point conclusively to the \r\n  guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.'\") \r\n  (quoting State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 328, 89 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1955)), \r\n  with Grippon, 327 S.C. at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464 (\"The law makes absolutely \r\n  no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial \r\n  evidence. Nor is a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence \r\n  than of direct evidence.\"). Although the supreme court noted in Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. at 82, 489 S.E.2d at 463, and reiterated in State v. Needs, \r\n  333 S.C. 134, 156 n.13, 508 S.E.2d 857, 868 n.13 (1998) and State v. Graddick, \r\n  345 S.C. 383, ___, 548 S.E.2d 210, 212 (2001), that the traditional Edwards \r\n  charge is still a legally correct and appropriate jury instruction, we cannot \r\n  fault the trial court for utilizing a charge recently specifically approved \r\n  by the supreme court. It obviously is a correct statement of the law of circumstantial \r\n  evidence. \"The judge properly instructs the jury if he adequately states the \r\n  applicable law. A jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the \r\n  law does not require reversal.\" State v. Ezell, 321 S.C. 421, 425, 468 \r\n  S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted). We find no error.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe conclude the trial court properly submitted Cherry's \r\n  charge to the jury and committed no error in instructing the jury on the law \r\n  of circumstantial evidence. Thus Cherry's conviction for possession with intent \r\n  to distribute crack cocaine is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs and dissents in a separate \r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs and dissents in a separate opinion \r\n  in which HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurs and dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCONNOR., J., dissents and joins in the dissents \r\n  of Howard, J., and Shuler, J.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (concurring):\r\n\r\nI concur fully in Judge Stilwell's opinion. \r\n\r\nWhat Judge Howard's opinion would have us do is weigh the \r\n  evidence, and this the court of appeals cannot do in a criminal case any more \r\n  than it can make a \"crab walk straight\" or \"smooth the rough spikes of the hedgehog.\" \r\n  Aristophanes, Peace (Anon. trans.) (420 B.C.), at http://www.vt.edu/vt98/academics/books/aristophanes/peace; \r\n  see State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 535 S.E.2d 126 (2000) (stating the \r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence and \r\n  not its weight even when the prosecution relies exclusively on circumstantial \r\n  evidence); State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999) \r\n  (\"On a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal case, the trial court is \r\n  concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight.\"). \r\n  The question of whether the crack cocaine found on Cherry's person was for his \r\n  own personal use or for distribution to others was singularly for the jury.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of crack cocaine in this case was not \r\n  sufficient to apply the statutory inference of intent to distribute, there is \r\n  no question that the State presented direct evidence of possession. Furthermore, \r\n  in discrediting the evidence of Cherry's intent as circumstantial rather than \r\n  direct, Judge Howard's opinion fails to recognize that \"[i]ntent is seldom susceptible \r\n  to proof by direct evidence and must ordinarily be proven by circumstantial \r\n  evidence, that is, by facts and circumstances from which intent may be inferred.\" \r\n  State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295, 299, 185 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971); see \r\n  also 29A Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 1469 at 849-50 (1994) (\"Circumstantial \r\n  evidence alone is often sufficient to show criminal intent because the element \r\n  of intent, being a state of mind or mental purpose, is usually incapable of \r\n  direct proof.\").\r\n\r\nWhat gives me additional concern is the reason Judge Howard \r\ncharacterizes the evidence of Cherry's intent as \"not substantial.\" In dismissing \r\nthis evidence because it could have supported the inference that Cherry intended \r\nto use rather than distribute the crack cocaine in his possession, he appears \r\nto follow the directive in State v. Manis, 214 S.C. 99, 51 S.E.2d 370 (1949), \r\nthat when the prosecution attempts to prove guilt by circumstantial evidence, \r\nan acquittal is warranted unless the circumstances \"point conclusively-that is, \r\nto a moral certainty-to the guilt of the accused; . . . and they must further \r\nbe absolutely inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis than the guilt \r\nof the accused.\" Id. at 101, 51 S.E.2d at 371 (citations omitted). The \r\nsupreme court, however, has since overruled Manis and its progeny on this \r\nvery issue. State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888, cert. denied, \r\n493 U.S. 895 (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J. (concurring and dissenting): \r\n   Within recent years, the rule of circumstantial evidence \r\n  in the criminal trial venue has evoked more etymological responses by academics, \r\n  commentators, and judges than any other criminal trial principle.\r\n\r\nThe most common error found in the literature and case law \r\n  is the tendency to isolate circumstantial evidence from its utilitarian aspect \r\n  in regard to the trial jury (i.e., fact finders) into an academic vacuum \r\n  analysis by legal scholars.\r\n\r\nIn the criminal trial arena, the \"circumstantial evidence\" \r\n  principle juxtaposes the trial judge and jury in reference to their duties and \r\n  function. Initially, a trifurcated review must be undertaken:\r\n\r\n\r\n  What is the correct articulation of the rule as to verbiage \r\n    and language?\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  \r\n  What is the functional and analytical role of the judge \r\n    in applying the circumstantial evidence rule when a motion for directed verdict \r\n    is presented to the court? \r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  \r\n  What is the proper jury charge on circumstantial evidence?\r\n\r\nI. The Rule\r\n\r\nDue process requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged. E.g., S.C. Const. \r\n  art. I, Â§ 3; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d \r\n  368 (1970). It is an axiomatic and elementary principle that guilt can be proven \r\n  through the State's introduction of direct or circumstantial evidence or both.\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court defined \"direct evidence\" and \"circumstantial \r\n  evidence\" in State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 508 S.E.2d 857 (1998):\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect evidence is the testimony of a person who asserts or claims to have actual knowledge of a\r\nfact, such as an eyewitness.  Circumstantial evidence is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances\r\nindicating the existence of a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 156 n.13, 508 S.E.2d at 868 n.13; see also \r\n  State v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520, 524 n.1, 541 S.E.2d 247, 248-49 n.1 (2001) \r\n  (\"Evidence can be divided into two basic categories: direct and circumstantial. \r\n  Direct evidence is evidence based on actual knowledge and proves a fact without \r\n  inference or presumption. Direct evidence immediately establishes the main fact \r\n  to be proved. Circumstantial evidence immediately establishes collateral facts \r\n  from which the main fact may be inferred, and is typically characterized by \r\n  inference or presumption.\") (citations omitted); State v. Nesmith, 213 \r\n  S.C. 60, 67, 48 S.E.2d 595, 598 (1948) (\"Direct evidence is testimony, which \r\n  if believed, tends directly to prove a fact in issue. Circumstantial evidence \r\n  on the other hand, while not tending directly to prove a fact in issue gives \r\n  rise to a legal inference that such fact does exist.\") (quoting the jury charge \r\n  given by the trial court, which the Supreme Court held was a correct statement \r\n  of the law); Underhill's Criminal Evidence Â§ 15 (6th ed. 1973) (stating \r\n  direct evidence immediately establishes the main fact to be proved, while circumstantial \r\n  evidence immediately establishes collateral facts from which the main fact may \r\n  be inferred).\r\n\r\nII. Role of the Court \r\n\r\nRule 19(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure \r\n  permits a criminal defendant to move for directed verdict:\r\n\r\n\r\n  On motion of the defendant or on its own motion, the [trial] \r\n    court shall direct a verdict in the defendant's favor on any offense charged \r\n    in the indictment after the evidence on either side is closed, if there is \r\n    a failure of competent evidence tending to prove the charge in the indictment. \r\n    In ruling on the motion, the trial judge shall consider only the existence \r\n    or non-existence of the evidence and not its weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge assesses the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the parameters of the appellate court's review \r\n  are identical to the analytical method applied by the trial judge. See, e.g., \r\n  State v. Horne, 324 S.C. 372, 478 S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. 1996); In the \r\n  Interest of Bruce O., 311 S.C. 514, 429 S.E.2d 858 (Ct. App. 1993). As at \r\n  the trial level, the appellate tribunal views the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to the prosecution. E.g., State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 \r\n  S.E.2d 63 (1998).\r\n\r\nA. The \"Any Evidence\" Standard\r\n\r\nIn State v. Rush, 129&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;43, 123 S.E. \r\n  765 (1924), the Supreme Court heard the appeal of several persons convicted \r\n  for illegally manufacturing whisky in Greenwood County. Among the exceptions \r\n  presented was whether the trial court erred by not directing a verdict in favor \r\n  of the defendants:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposition most strenuously advanced [by the appellants] is that the trial judge committed\r\nerror of law in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal â€¦ upon the ground that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to support a conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 45, 123 S.E. at 765.\r\n\r\nThe Court applied the following standard of review in considering the appellants' argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If there was any evidence adduced tending to \r\n    establish the guilt of the accused upon the charge laid, neither of the rulings \r\n    of the trial Judge complained of can, of course, be imputed to him as error \r\n    of law. Our only legitimate inquiry, therefore, is whether there \r\n    was any competent evidence properly submissible to the jury. If there was, \r\n    its weight and sufficiency were for the jury â€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThough previous South Carolina courts had recognized the \r\n  \"any evidence\" standard, (2) its application \r\n  in Rush was arguably the fountainhead for the modern-day employment of \r\n  this rule. See, e.g., State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  525 (1999); State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 431 S.E.2d 254 (1993); \r\n  State v. Davis, 278 S.C. 544, 298 S.E.2d 778 (1983); State v. Pauling, \r\n  264&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;275, 214 S.E.2d 326 (1975); State v. Clamp, 225&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;89, \r\n  80 S.E.2d 918 (1954).\r\n\r\nSeveral opinions, beginning with the decision in State \r\n  v. Matarazzo, 262&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;662, 207 S.E.2d 93 (1974), provided a variation \r\n  of this standard:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is elementary that in deciding whether the court erred \r\n    in failing to direct a verdict in favor of a defendant in a criminal case \r\n    the appellate court is required to view the testimony in the light most favorable \r\n    to the State. When a motion for a directed verdict is made the trial judge \r\n    is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not with its \r\n    weight, and although he should not refuse to grant such motion where the evidence \r\n    merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty, it is his duty to submit \r\n    the case to the jury, if there is any evidence, either direct or \r\n    circumstantial, which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of \r\n    the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 665-66, 207 S.E.2d at 94-95 (emphasis added) \r\n  (citation omitted); see also State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 372 S.E.2d \r\n  587 (1988); State v. Kimbrell, 294 S.C. 51, 362 S.E.2d 630 (1987); State \r\n  v. Owens, 291 S.C. 116, 352 S.E.2d 474 (1987); State v. Mathis, 287 \r\n  S.C. 589, 340 S.E.2d 538 (1986); State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d \r\n  195 (1978); State v. Massey, 267&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;432, 229 S.E.2d 332 (1976).\r\n\r\nB.  The \"Substantial Evidence\" Standard\r\n\r\nIn State v. Littlejohn, 228&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;324, 89 \r\n  S.E.2d 924 (1955), the defendant owned an Upstate restaurant, which contained \r\n  a second floor. An employee of the defendant lived in a room on the second floor. \r\n  The police, suspecting violations of the state's alcohol control laws, executed \r\n  a search of the defendant's premises. Their search included the employee's room. \r\n  While in the employee's room, the police uncovered four pint bottles and seventeen \r\n  half-pint bottles of assorted bourbon and blended whiskey. At the time, it was \r\n  illegal for a person to store or have in his possession, any alcohol in his \r\n  place of business other than a licensed liquor store. 1952 Code Â§ 4-95. The \r\n  defendant was charged with violation of the statute and convicted. On appeal, \r\n  the Supreme Court reviewed the trial judge's denial of the defendant's directed \r\n  verdict motion:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [O]n a motion for direction of verdict, the trial judge \r\n    is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not with its \r\n    weight; and, although he should not refuse to grant the motion where the evidence \r\n    merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty, it is his duty to submit \r\n    the case to the jury if there be any substantial evidence \r\n    which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his \r\n    guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 329, 89 S.E.2d at 926 (emphasis added) (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nApplying this standard, the Court determined the trial court erred by denying the defendant's\r\nmotion:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere being no direct evidence of appellant's guilt, the trial judge should have granted his motion\r\nfor a directed verdict unless the facts and circumstances testified to by the state's witnesses were\r\nsuch that from them his guilt might have been fairly and logically deduced, not merely suspected.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 329-30, 89 S.E.2d at 926.\r\n\r\nLittlejohn was the first reported case in South Carolina \r\n  that announced the \"substantial\" standard in relation \r\n  to the quantum of circumstantial evidence required at the directed verdict stage. \r\n  Thirty-four years later, Littlejohn continued to enjoy the Supreme Court's \r\n  approbation when it decided State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d \r\n  888 (1989).\r\n\r\nIn Edwards, the appellant had been convicted for \r\n  participating in the armed robbery of a car rental agency. The evidence used \r\n  to convict him was circumstantial. The evidence included, inter alia: \r\n  the appellant was a brother-in-law and known associate of one of the robbers; \r\n  hairs recovered from a stocking cap discarded by one of the robbers were determined \r\n  to have originated from the appellant or \"from some other Caucasian\"; \r\n  (3) a South Carolina license plate, which was placed by the robbers \r\n  on a car stolen from the agency contained the appellant's fingerprints; and \r\n  the stolen car's proper license plates were found in the trunk of a car belonging \r\n  to the appellant.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the appellant sought a directed verdict. The trial \r\n  judge denied the motion and sent the case to the jury. The appellant contended \r\n  on appeal that the judge's denial of the directed verdict motion was erroneous. \r\n  The Court, when examining this issue, recalled the previous holding in Littlejohn:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether to send the case to the jury on circumstantial evidence, the proper standard\r\nto be applied by the [trial] judge is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    [T]he [trial] judge is concerned with the existence or non-existence \r\n      of evidence, not its weight; and although he should not refuse to grant \r\n      the motion where the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused \r\n      is guilty, it is his duty to submit the case to the jury if there \r\n      be any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of \r\n      the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced. \r\n      [emphasis added].\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLittlejohn, 89 S.E.2d at 926.\r\n\r\nId. at 275, 379 S.E.2d at 889.\r\n\r\nThe Court determined the accumulated circumstantial evidence was \"substantial.\"  The appellant's\r\nconviction was affirmed.\r\n\r\nOur appellate entities have time and again bottomed and \r\n  premised their holdings by employing the Littlejohn rule, as restated \r\n  by Edwards. See, e.g., State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, \r\n  535 S.E.2d 126 (2000); State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 \r\n  (2000); State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 447 S.E.2d 177 (1993); Brown \r\n  v. State, 307 S.C. 465, 415 S.E.2d 811 (1992); State v. Williams, \r\n  303 S.C. 274, 400 S.E.2d 131 (1991); State v. Stokes, 299 S.C. 483, 386 \r\n  S.E.2d 241 (1989); State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 473 S.E.2d 831 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).\r\n\r\nC.  The \"Any Direct Evidence or Substantial \r\n\r\nCircumstantial Evidence\" Standard\r\n\r\nIn articulating its scope of review in State v. Venters, \r\n  300 S.C. 260, 387 S.E.2d 270 (1990), the Supreme Court amalgamated the language \r\n  of the various standards present in the case law:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In reviewing a denial of a motion for a directed verdict, \r\n    the evidence must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the State and \r\n    if there is any direct or any substantial circumstantial evidence, \r\n    reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find that such \r\n    issues were properly to be decided by the jury. State v. Stokes, 299 \r\n    S.C. 483, 386 S.E.2d 241 (S.C.1989); State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, \r\n    379 S.E.2d 888 (1989); State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 \r\n    (1978).\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 264, 387 S.E.2d at 272-73 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSubsequent courts have adopted this language. See, e.g., \r\n  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001); State v. Lollis, \r\n  343&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001); State v. Pinckney, 339 \r\n  S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000); State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d \r\n  795 (1999); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).\r\n\r\nD.  Survey of Other Jurisdictions Relating\r\n  to the Definition of \"Substantial\"\r\n\r\nA conundrum exists in the criminal case law of South Carolina: \r\n  the term \"substantial\" -- as it relates to the scope of review for directed \r\n  verdict motions -- has never been defined. As a result, judges at both the trial \r\n  and appellate levels have created their own definitions when addressing a directed \r\n  verdict motion. Courts in other jurisdictions have extensively addressed the \r\n  subject of directed verdict motions and the \"substantial\" \r\n  evidence requirement.\r\n\r\nArizona\r\n\r\n The trial court shall enter a judgment of acquittal (i.e., \r\n  directed verdict) if there is no substantial evidence to warrant a conviction. \r\n  Arizona v. Ritacca, 819 P.2d 987 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1991). \"'Substantial \r\n  evidence' is 'evidence that would convince an unprejudiced thinking mind of \r\n  the truth of the fact to which the evidence is presented.'\" Arizona \r\n  v. Rodriquez, 921 P.2d 643, 648 (Ariz. 1996) (citation omitted) (emphasis \r\n  added). \"If reasonable [persons] may fairly differ as to whether certain evidence \r\n  establishes a fact in issue, then such evidence must be considered as substantial.\" \r\n  Arizona v. Tison, 633 P.2d 355, 362 (Ariz. 1981) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nArkansas\r\n\r\nA motion for directed verdict in the criminal trial setting \r\n  is a challenge to the sufficiency of the state's evidence against the accused. \r\n  Smith v. Arkansas, 3 S.W.3d 712 (Ark. 1999). The test is whether there \r\n  was substantial evidence to support the verdict. Pettigrew v. Arkansas, \r\n  984 S.W.2d 72 (Ark. Ct. App. 1998). \"Substantial evidence is evidence \r\n  that is of sufficient certainty and precision that is compels a conclusion one \r\n  way or another.\" Cox v. Arkansas, 47 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Ark. \r\n  2001) (emphasis added) (citation omitted); see also Mulkey v. Arkansas, \r\n  952 S.W.2d 149, 151 (Ark. 1997) (stating \"[S]ubstantial evidence \r\n  must be forceful enough to compel a conclusion one way or the other beyond suspicion \r\n  and conjecture.\") (quoting Williams v. Arkansas, 930 S.W.2d \r\n  297, 299 (Ark. 1996)) (emphasis added). The appellate tribunal does not weigh \r\n  the evidence presented at trial. Wilson v. Arkansas, 962 S.W.2d 805 (Ark. \r\n  1998). In determining whether the evidence is substantial to support a conviction, \r\n  the reviewing court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. \r\n  Akins v. Arkansas, 955 S.W.2d 483 (Ark. 1997).\r\n\r\nMississippi\r\n\r\nWeeks v. Mississippi, 493 So.2d 1280 (Miss. 1986), \r\n  outlines the standard in the Magnolia State for determining whether a directed \r\n  verdict should have been granted to the defendant:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the facts and inferences so considered point in favor \r\n    of the defendant with sufficient force that reasonable men could not have \r\n    found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, granting the \r\n    [dismissal motion] is required. On the other hand, if there is \r\n    substantial evidence opposed to the request or motion--that is, evidence of \r\n    such quality and weight that, having in mind the beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n    burden of proof standard, reasonable fair minded men in the exercise of impartial \r\n    judgment might reach different conclusions--the request or motion should be \r\n    denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 1282 (emphasis added) (citation omitted), \r\n  quoted in Turner v. Mississippi, 726 So.2d 117, 124-25 (Miss. 1999).\r\n\r\nNew Mexico\r\n\r\nThe question presented by a directed verdict motion is whether \r\n  there was substantial evidence to support the charge. New Mexico v. Maestas, \r\n  584 P.2d 182 (N.M. Ct. App. 1978). \"Substantial evidence â€¦ is defined \r\n  as that evidence which is acceptable to a reasonable mind as adequate support \r\n  for a conclusion.\" New Mexico v. Sparks, 694 P.2d 1382, \r\n  1385 (N.M. Ct. App. 1985) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Evidence supporting \r\n  a conviction may be direct or circumstantial. State v. Sutphin, 753 P.2d \r\n  1314 (N.M. 1988). The appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State, resolving all conflicts in the evidence and indulging all permissible \r\n  inferences to be drawn from it in favor of the verdict. New Mexico v. Dominquez, \r\n  853 P.2d 147 (N.M. Ct. App. 1993). The reviewing tribunal does not weigh \r\n  the evidence. Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nE.  Weighing Evidence or Determining the Existence of Evidence\r\n\r\n As a rule, the trial court is concerned with \r\n  the existence of evidence rather than its weight in ruling on a motion for a \r\n  directed verdict. E.g., State v. Spann, 279 S.C. \r\n  399, 308 S.E.2d 518 (1983). There is a marked distinction, however, between \r\n  the jury's \"weighing of the evidence\" and a trial court's establishing whether \r\n  the State's evidence is sufficient to send the case to the jury. The concurring \r\n  opinion in Utah v. Thatcher, 157 P.2d 258 (Utah 1945), clearly explains \r\n  the difference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is common place in our system of jurisprudence that \r\n    the court decides only questions of law and the jury questions of fact. Each \r\n    has its judging functions and each is an equally important department of the \r\n    judicial institution we call the court. Neither is supposed to trespass in \r\n    the province of the other. This is so fundamental that no authority need be \r\n    cited for it. In this case[,] it is requisite that we determine the line separating \r\n    the functions of each. Ordinarily we say that it is for the jury and not the \r\n    court to 'weigh' the evidence. That means that where there is any \r\n    substantial evidence to go to the jury in favor of both sides it must go to \r\n    the jury so that the jury may put all the evidence for one party on one scale \r\n    and balance it against the evidence for the other party placed on the other \r\n    scale.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  The judge has very little to do with this process. He \r\n    determines whether offered testimony has any probative force, i.e., whether \r\n    it tends to prove or disprove an element of the case and according to that \r\n    judgment he admits or rejects it. Once admitted[,] it is for \r\n    the jury.\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n   There are, of course, situations under which the case should \r\n    not be submitted to a jury. One of these would be where there was no substantial \r\n    evidence (and that does not mean a substantial amount of evidence but substantial \r\n    in the sense of having substance). Perhaps also in the rare case where there \r\n    can be no doubt that testimony of all witnesses as to one or more essential \r\n    elements in the case appears from the record to be so inherently improbable \r\n    that no reasonable man could give weight to it the case could be taken from \r\n    the jury. But 'mere contradictions of the testimony of a witness will not \r\n    suffice to constitute inherent improbability or to destroy its weight' so \r\n    as to justify a court in disregarding such testimony. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 263-64 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nWhen faced with a directed verdict motion concerning circumstantial \r\n  evidence, our trial judges have been guided by the \"substantial\" standard, in \r\n  one form or the other, for decades. Proper application of this standard requires \r\n  a determination of whether the state has presented evidence that reasonably \r\n  supports every element of a charged crime. This determination does \r\n  not constitute a \"weighing of the evidence.\" To state that it does \r\n  or otherwise articulate a standard that invokes a deviation from the well-established \r\n  roles and responsibilities of the trial judge and jury in the criminal setting \r\n  fosters an unnecessary imbroglio for the bench and bar.\r\n\r\nIII. Circumstantial Evidence Jury \r\n  Charge\r\n\r\nA. Etymology of the Application of \r\n  Circumstantial Evidence in the Criminal Trial Setting: From Webster to Holland \r\n  to Grippon \r\n\r\n1. Massachusetts v. Webster \r\n\r\nIn late 1849, Dr. George Parkman, a professor of medicine \r\n  at Harvard, vanished mysteriously from his home. A week after his disappearance, \r\n  his dismembered body was found. No one witnessed the killing; however, numerous \r\n  circumstances led the authorities to arrest Dr. John W. Webster, a colleague \r\n  of Dr. Parkman. Dr. Webster was tried by a jury before the Supreme Judicial \r\n  Court of Massachusetts. Using the circumstantial evidence as the sole proof \r\n  of Dr. Webster's involvement, the prosecution secured the defendant's conviction. \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn his opinion on behalf of the court, Chief Justice Shaw \r\n  penned what would become an enduring elucidation on the treatment of circumstantial \r\n  evidence by a jury in the criminal trial setting:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This case is to be proved, if proved at all, by circumstantial \r\n    evidence â€¦. It becomes important, therefore, to state what circumstantial \r\n    evidence is; to point out the distinction between that and positive or direct \r\n    evidence â€¦.\r\n\r\n   The distinction â€¦ between direct and circumstantial evidence, \r\n    is this. Direct or positive evidence is when a witness can be called to testify \r\n    to the precise fact which is the subject of the issue on trial; that is, â€¦ \r\n    that the party accused did [commit the crime charged]. Whatever may be the \r\n    kind or force of the evidence, this is the fact to be proved. But suppose \r\n    no person was present on the occasion of the [crime], and of course that no \r\n    one can be called to testify to it; is it wholly unsusceptible of legal proof? \r\n    Experience has shown that circumstantial evidence may be offered â€¦ that is, \r\n    that a body of facts may be proved of so conclusive a character, as to warrant \r\n    a firm belief of the fact, quite as strong and certain as that on which discreet \r\n    men are accustomed to act, in relation to their most important concerns. It \r\n    would be injurious to the best interests of society, if such proof could not \r\n    avail in judicial proceedings. \r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  â€¦[I]n a case of circumstantial evidence where no witness \r\n    can testify directly to the fact to be proved, it is arrived at by a series \r\n    of other facts, which by experience have been found so associated with the \r\n    fact in question, that in the relation of cause and effect, they lead to a \r\n    satisfactory and certain conclusion â€¦. Circumstantial evidence, therefore, \r\n    is founded on experience and observed facts and coincidences, establishing \r\n    a connection between the known and proved facts and the fact sought to be \r\n    proved. The advantages are, that, as the evidence commonly comes from several \r\n    witnesses and different sources, a chain of circumstances is less likely to \r\n    be falsely prepared and arranged, and falsehood and perjury are more likely \r\n    to be detected and fail of their purpose. The disadvantages are, that a jury \r\n    has not only to weigh the evidence of facts, but to draw just conclusions \r\n    from them; in doing which, they may be led by prejudice or partiality, or \r\n    by want of due deliberation and sobriety of judgment, to make hasty and false \r\n    deductions; a source of error not existing in the consideration of positive \r\n    evidence.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  Another rule is, that the circumstances taken together \r\n    should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, leading on the whole to a satisfactory \r\n    conclusion, and producing in effect a reasonable and moral certainty, that \r\n    the accused, and no one else, committed the offence charged. It is not sufficient \r\n    that they create a probability, though a strong one; and if, therefore, assuming \r\n    all the facts to be true which the evidence tends to establish, they may yet \r\n    be accounted for upon any hypothesis which does not include the guilt of the \r\n    accused, the proof fails. It is essential, therefore, that the \r\n    circumstances taken as a whole, and giving them their reasonable and just \r\n    weight, and no more, should to a moral certainty exclude every other hypothesis. \r\n    The evidence must establish the corpus delicti, as it is termed, or \r\n    the offence committed as charged â€¦. This is to be proved beyond reasonable \r\n    doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nMassachusetts v. Webster, 59 Mass. 295, 310-20 (Mass. \r\n  1850) (emphasis added); see also Alexander M. Burrill, A Treatise \r\n  on the Nature, Principles and Rules of Circumstantial Evidence 737 (1856) \r\n  (presenting the rule for the \"More Certain Attainment of Truth in the Conclusion \r\n  or Verdict, and for the Avoidance of Error and Consequent Injustice to the Accused\": \r\n  \"Rule I. The evidence against the accused must be such as to exclude to \r\n  a moral certainty, every hypothesis but that of his guilt of the offence imputed \r\n  to him.\"); William Wills, An Essay on the Principles of Circumstantial Evidence \r\n  189(Fred B. Rothman &amp; Co. ed. 1981) (defining the \"Rules of Induction Specially \r\n  Applicable to Circumstantial Evidence\": \"Rule 4-- In order to justify the inference \r\n  of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the \r\n  accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis other \r\n  than that of his guilt.\").\r\n\r\nCourts throughout the republic, both federal and state, \r\n  adopted the view expounded within Webster that juries be instructed -- \r\n  when applicable -- that circumstantial evidence must exclude every \"reasonable \r\n  hypothesis\" other than that of guilt. Irene Merker Rosenberg &amp; Yale L. Rosenberg, \r\n  \"Perhaps What Ye Say is Based only on Conjecture\" - - Circumstantial Evidence, \r\n  Then and Now, 31 Hous. L. Rev. 1371 (1995).\r\n\r\nExamination of the case law published in South Carolina \r\n  in the years following Webster reveals the acceptance and continual application \r\n  of the \"reasonable hypothesis\" rule. See, e.g., State v. Kimbrell, \r\n  191&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;238, 4 S.E.2d 121 (1939); State v. Langford, 74 S.C. \r\n  460, 55 S.E. 120 (1906); State v. Hudson, 66 S.C. 394, 44 S.E. 968 (1903); \r\n  State v. Cannon, 49 S.C. 550, 27 S.E. 526 (1897); State v. Aughtry, \r\n  49 S.C. 285, 26 S.E. 19 (1897); State v. Atkinson, 40 S.C. 363, 18 S.E. \r\n  1021 (1894); State v. Haines, 36 S.C. 504, 15 S.E. 555 (1892); State \r\n  v. Milling, 35 S.C. 16, 14 S.E. 284 (1892); State v. Stewart, 26 \r\n  S.C. 125, 1 S.E. 468 (1887); State v. Anderson, 20 S.C. 581 (1884).\r\n\r\nIn the modern era, the leading case that guided trial judges \r\n  for years in this state was State v. Littlejohn, 228&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;324, \r\n  89 S.E.2d 924 (1955). In addition to its holding concerning the proper standard \r\n  for review of a directed verdict motion in a circumstantial evidence case, the \r\n  Littlejohn Court additionally annunciated the rule governing conviction \r\n  based on circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n\r\n[E]very circumstance relied upon by the State be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and ... all of\r\nthe circumstances so proven be consistent with each other and taken together, point conclusively\r\nto the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.   It is not\r\nsufficient that they create a probability, though a strong one and if, assuming them to be true they\r\nmay be accounted for upon any reasonable hypothesis which does not include the guilt of the\r\naccused, the proof has failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 328, 89 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1955), quoted \r\n  in State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989).\r\n\r\n2. Holland v. United States \r\n  and Its Legacy \r\n\r\nRecognition of the Webster rule in the federal courts, \r\n  however, ended with the United States Supreme Court's decision in United \r\n  States v. Holland, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S. Ct. 127, 99 L. Ed. 150 (1954). In \r\n  Holland, the federal government prosecuted a husband and wife for willful \r\n  evasion of income tax. The government based its case upon the \"net worth\" method \r\n  of proof. The Court had previously approved use of this tactic in cases against \r\n  gangsters and known criminals, thereby allowing the government to establish \r\n  \"taxable income from undisclosed sources when all other efforts failed.\" Irene \r\n  Merker Rosenberg &amp; Yale L. Rosenberg, \"Perhaps What Ye Say is Based only \r\n  on Conjecture\" - - Circumstantial Evidence, Then and Now, 31 Hous. L. Rev. \r\n  1371, 1392-93 (1995). Use of this method at trial involved the introduction \r\n  of circumstantial evidence.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the husband and wife averred, inter alia, \r\n  the federal district court erred when it did not give the \"reasonable hypothesis\" \r\n  instruction when the jury was charged. The Supreme Court, however, did not agree:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [The husband and wife] press upon us, finally, the contention \r\n    that the instructions of the trial court were so erroneous and misleading \r\n    as to constitute grounds for reversal. We have carefully reviewed the instructions \r\n    and cannot agree. But some require comment. The petitioners assail the refusal \r\n    of the trial judge to instruct that where the Government's evidence is circumstantial \r\n    it must be such as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that \r\n    of guilt. There is some support for this type of instruction in the lower \r\n    court decisions â€¦ but the better rule is that where the jury is \r\n    properly instructed on the standards for reasonable doubt, such an additional \r\n    instruction on circumstantial evidence is confusing and incorrect â€¦.\r\n\r\n   Circumstantial evidence in this respect is intrinsically \r\n    no different from testimonial evidence. Admittedly, circumstantial evidence \r\n    may in some cases point to a wholly incorrect result. Yet this is equally \r\n    true of testimonial evidence. In both instances, a jury is asked to weigh \r\n    the chances that the evidence correctly points to guilt against the possibility \r\n    of inaccuracy or ambiguous inference. In both, the jury must use its experience \r\n    with people and events in weighing the probabilities. If the jury \r\n    is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, we can require no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 139-40, 75 S. Ct. at 137-38.\r\n\r\nBy and large, the states did not follow the precedent established \r\n  by Holland until the Supreme Court \"constitutionalized\" the reasonable \r\n  doubt standard in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. \r\n  Ed. 2d 368 (1970). (4) Rosenberg &amp; Rosenberg, \r\n  supra, at 1397. In essence, In re Winship articulated the constitutional \r\n  parameters for the protection of defendants with respect to the sufficiency \r\n  of the evidence. Id. Consequently, many states began to abandon the \"reasonable \r\n  hypothesis\" instruction. Id. Today, a majority of states recognize the \r\n  Holland rule. Id. at 1400; Carol J. Miller, Annotation, Modern \r\n  Status of Rule Regarding the Necessity of Instruction on Circumstantial Evidence \r\n  in Criminal Trial -- State Cases, 36 A.L.R.4th 1046 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\n3. State v. Grippon: South \r\n  Carolina Embraces the Holland Rule \r\n\r\nWith the filing of State v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, \r\n  489 S.E.2d 462 (1997), South Carolina joined the legion of jurisdictions that \r\n  have adopted the holding in Holland relating to the handling of circumstantial \r\n  evidence at the jury charge stage.\r\n\r\nGrippon asked the trial court to instruct the jury on circumstantial \r\n  evidence. During his charge, the judge omitted the phrase \"to the exclusion \r\n  of every other reasonable hypothesis.\" The court determined this phrase impermissibly \r\n  shifted the burden of proof from the State to the accused. The judge did, however, \r\n  define \"reasonable doubt\" and repeated throughout his charge that reasonable \r\n  doubt was the required standard of proof.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Grippon asserted the trial court erred by deleting \r\n  the phrase \"to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.\" The Supreme \r\n  Court held the trial judge's instructions as a whole adequately conveyed the \r\n  level of proof required to find Grippon guilty. Further, and more significantly, \r\n  the Grippon Court stated the better rule regarding the jury charge in \r\n  a circumstantial evidence case was the one posited in Holland:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In Holland, the Court held, if a proper reasonable \r\n    doubt instruction is given, a jury need not be instructed that the circumstantial \r\n    evidence must be so strong as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other \r\n    than guilt.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  Therefore, in a criminal case relying in whole or in part \r\n    on circumstantial evidence, once a proper reasonable doubt instruction is \r\n    given, we recommend the jury be instructed as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere are two types of evidence which are generally presented during a trial -- direct evidence\r\nand circumstantial evidence.  Direct evidence is the testimony of a person who asserts or claims to\r\nhave actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness.  Circumstantial evidence is proof of a\r\nchain of facts and circumstances indicating the existence of a fact.  The law makes absolutely no\r\ndistinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. \r\nNor is a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence. \r\nYou should weigh all the evidence in the case.  After weighing all the evidence, if you are not\r\nconvinced of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find [the defendant]\r\nnot guilty.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464 (emphasis added) \r\n  (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the Grippon Court's adoption of the \r\n  Holland rule, the \"reasonable hypothesis\" instruction remains proper. \r\n  State v. Graddick, __ S.C. __, 548 S.E.2d 210, 212 (2001) \r\n  (\"Grippon did not invalidate the traditional circumstantial evidence \r\n  charge.\") (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nB. Defenses of the \"Reasonable Hypothesis\" \r\n  Instruction\r\n\r\n1. The \"Bandwagon Effect\"\r\n\r\nIn the concurring opinion in Grippon, Chief Justice \r\n  Toal, then an Associate Justice, strenuously disagreed with the majority's adoption \r\n  of Holland. While recognizing amendments to the language of the traditional \r\n  \"circumstantial evidence\" jury charge had occurred within recent years, \r\n  (5) she contended the Supreme Court never concluded the phrase \"to \r\n  the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis\" was unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe concurring opinion based its support for the continuation \r\n  of the \"reasonable hypothesis\" language as a required instruction in circumstantial \r\n  evidence cases, in large part, upon the analysis of Professors Irene and Yale \r\n  Rosenburg in their 1995 Houston Law Review article, \"Perhaps What Ye Say \r\n  is Based only on Conjecture\" - - Circumstantial Evidence, Then &amp; Now. \r\n  (6) As related within the concurring opinion, the Rosenbergs intensely \r\n  criticized the interpretation of the Holland opinion by the states and \r\n  the federal circuits. According to the authors, the adoption of Holland \r\n  by many jurisdictions is the product of a \"bandwagon effect.\" In other words, \r\n  courts have drastically altered the laws regarding the treatment of circumstantial \r\n  evidence in the criminal trial setting with little or no meaningful analysis \r\n  or discussion. They have, in essence, joined the pack because everyone else \r\n  has.\r\n\r\n2. Interpreting Holland in \r\n  a Vacuum \r\n\r\n A careful reading of Holland, in its \r\n  entirety, reveals there are a great many facts and difficult legal \r\n  principles involved that make it a unique case. Consequently, the argument exists \r\n  that the broad interpretation and application of the Holland rule by \r\n  the states and federal circuits oversteps the intentions of the Supreme Court \r\n  (i.e., the Court intended the holding to be applied in a limited manner):\r\n\r\n\r\n  Although Holland is usually cited broadly for the \r\n    proposition that a reasonable doubt instruction obviates the need to give \r\n    the jury a cautionary circumstantial evidence charge, those relying on it \r\n    often fail to discuss other significant aspects of the Court's opinion, including \r\n    the Justices' declaration that the net worth method \"involve(s) something \r\n    more than the ordinary use of circumstantial evidence in the usual criminal \r\n    case\" and \"is so fraught with danger for the innocent that the courts must \r\n    closely scrutinize its use.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosenberg &amp; Rosenberg, supra, at 1393 (footnotes \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nThe Rosenbergs continue with the suggestion that the Supreme \r\n  Court never intended its holding in Holland to have such a pervasive \r\n  effect on criminal trials involving circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he Court believed that proof under the net worth method \r\n    was far more dangerous than most circumstantial evidence, and because of these \r\n    risks, the Justices placed strict limitations on net worth prosecutions. At \r\n    the same time, despite these dangers, the Court eliminated the cautionary \r\n    instruction. That being the case, it may be argued that if the Court was willing \r\n    to reject a demand for the cautionary charge in a class of prosecutions in \r\n    which the use of such evidence posed special dangers to defendants who might \r\n    be innocent, a fortiori such instructions are unnecessary with respect to \r\n    garden variety common law crimes in which such dangers are less acute or nonexistent. \r\n    Moreover, it may be contended that the limitations imposed on the use of circumstantial \r\n    evidence relate only to net worth determinations in willful tax evasion actions, \r\n    and therefore it is appropriate to apply them only in such cases. Given the \r\n    broad language used by the Court in establishing parity between direct and \r\n    circumstantial evidence and in abolishing the cautionary instruction even \r\n    in extreme situations, and given its largely fact specific limitations, this \r\n    may be the more likely, or at least a more straightforward, reading of the \r\n    Holland opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 1395 (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nC.  The Calculus of a Jury Verdict \r\n  and the Necessity for the\"Reasonable Hypothesis\" Instruction\r\n\r\nIf jurors are to decide cases according to law, then the \r\n  instructions they are given become critical to justice.  Amiram Elkwork et \r\n  al., \"Toward Understandable Jury Instructions,\" in In the Jury Box \r\n  162 (Lawrence Wrightman et al. eds., 1987). While neither circumstantial \r\n  nor direct evidence is recognized as better or more credible, they are indisputably \r\n  different animals; therefore, the necessity for particularized instruction regarding \r\n  each principle during the jury charge is obvious. Courts in other jurisdictions \r\n  have concluded as such.\r\n\r\nIn New York v. Kennedy, 391 N.E.2d 288 (N.Y. 1979), \r\n  the Court of Appeals considered whether the evidence sufficiently supported \r\n  Kennedy's conviction. In reaching its decision, the court discussed the entanglements \r\n  in logic and reason that circumstantial evidence may create for criminal trial \r\n  juries:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It has long been the law in this State that a criminal \r\n    conviction based upon circumstantial evidence is subject to strict judicial \r\n    scrutiny. This is so not because circumstantial evidence is any less reliable \r\n    than direct evidence, for each of the two types of evidence is subject to \r\n    certain inherent weaknesses. Indeed, there is much to be said for the argument \r\n    that direct testimony may often be of more dubious value, as is indicated \r\n    by the extensive literature on the lack of reliability of eyewitness testimony \r\n    as well as the often expressed judicial concern with the problem of impermissibly \r\n    suggestive identification procedures. Rather, cases involving circumstantial \r\n    evidence must be closely reviewed because they often require the jury to undertake \r\n    a more complex and problematical reasoning process than do cases based on \r\n    direct evidence. In the latter situation, the jury is normally \r\n    concerned primarily with assessing the credibility of witnesses, a role for \r\n    which the jury is superbly suited. Where, however, the defendant's \r\n    guilt is to be proven, if at all, by circumstantial evidence only, the jury \r\n    must attempt a careful and close analysis of the evidence and determine what \r\n    inferences can and should be drawn not merely from each separate piece of \r\n    evidence, but from the whole complex of interrelated information which is \r\n    presented in evidence. This is not to suggest, of course, that \r\n    a jury need not carefully analyze the evidence in a case based on direct evidence. \r\n    However, in such a case, the jury has less need to depend on inference, and \r\n    is more likely to be faced with the relatively less complex, although no less \r\n    difficult task of determining which witnesses are telling the truth. In \r\n    a circumstantial evidence case, in contradistinction, the reasoning process \r\n    tends to be more complex, and is thus more subject to error. Hence, \r\n    close judicial supervision is necessary to ensure that the jury does not make \r\n    inferences which are based not on the evidence presented, but rather on unsupported \r\n    assumptions drawn from evidence equivocal at best. Careful \r\n    review of such cases is needed to decrease \"a danger legitimately associated \r\n    with circumstantial evidence that the trier of facts may leap logical gaps \r\n    in the proof offered and draw unwarranted conclusions based on probabilities \r\n    of low degree.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 290-91 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn New York v. Ford, 488 N.E.2d 458 (N.Y. 1985), \r\n  the Court of Appeals edified:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [In the instant case,] although the charge informed the \r\n    jury that as between two permissible inferences defendants were entitled to \r\n    the one consistent with innocence and that the People must prove every element \r\n    of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, the former was part of the general introductory \r\n    portion of the charge concerning inferences and the latter was given in a \r\n    discussion of weighing proof. Neither was directly related, as \r\n    it should have been, to the \"complex and problematical reasoning process necessarily \r\n    undertaken in cases of purely circumstantial evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 465 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn Idaho v. Holman, 707 P.2d 493 (Idaho Ct. App. \r\n  1985), the trial court refused to give a \"reasonable hypothesis\" instruction \r\n  in its charge to the jury. The appellate court reversed, holding Idaho precedent \r\n  mandated the trial court's issuance of the requested charge:\r\n\r\n\r\n  As [State v.] Holder[,100 Idaho 129, 594 \r\n    P.2d 639 (Idaho 1979),] â€¦ [makes] clear, failure to give a \"reasonable hypothesis\" \r\n    instruction, when warranted by the evidence, is reversible error. Here, the \r\n    evidence of Holman's burglary of the Moyie store was wholly circumstantial. \r\n    None of the trial court's instructions on reasonable doubt explicitly informed \r\n    the jury that the evidence must exclude every \"reasonable hypothesis\" other \r\n    than guilt. Consequently, the case law impels us to hold that the jury was \r\n    not adequately instructed.\r\n\r\n   The state does not dispute the clear message of the case \r\n    law. Rather, the state asks us -- and ultimately may ask the Supreme Court \r\n    -- to reverse the trend of these cases. The state would have us hold that \r\n    a \"reasonable hypothesis\" instruction violates the equal dignity of direct \r\n    and circumstantial evidence, and that it constitutes an improper judicial \r\n    comment upon the weight of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 501.\r\n\r\nThe court concluded its analysis of the issue with its affirmation \r\n  of the significance of the \"reasonable hypothesis\" instruction:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [W]e are not persuaded [by the State's argument]. \r\n    A \"reasonable hypothesis\" instruction imparts specific meaning to the concept \r\n    of reasonable doubt, when applied to circumstantial evidence. It does not \r\n    increase the state's burden of proof; it simply makes the burden clearer. \r\n    This sharpened clarity does not strike us as inappropriate when the difference \r\n    between conviction or acquittal turns upon the inferences a jury chooses to \r\n    draw. \r\n\r\n\r\nId.  \r\n  (7)\r\n\r\nD. A Suggested Circumstantial Evidence \r\n  Jury Charge\r\n\r\nFor seventeen years as a circuit judge, I instructed \r\n  juries on the law of the case. As a matter of conscience, I feel the trial jury \r\n  should be given a full and complete statement of the principles of law or procedure \r\n  involved in the case. Circumstantial evidence cries out for a broad presentation \r\n  to the fact finder. I do not believe justice is served by truncating the instruction. \r\n  Understanding full well that my writing has little or no efficacy, I respectfully \r\n  suggest a circumstantial evidence charge:\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of evidence: direct evidence and circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n\"Direct evidence\" is the testimony of a person who claims to have actual knowledge of a fact. It is\r\nevidence based on actual knowledge and proves a fact without inference or presumption.\r\nIt is\r\nwhen a witness can be called to testify to the precise fact that is the subject of the issue on trial. \r\nDirect evidence immediately establishes the main fact to be proved. It is essentially evidence you\r\ncould see, observe, or hear with your senses.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstantial evidence\" does not tend to immediately prove a fact in issue; however, it does\r\ngive rise to a legal inference that such a fact does exist.  It means the proof of a chain of facts and\r\ncircumstances indicating the existence of a fact that demonstrates an element of the crime charged. \r\nCircumstantial evidence immediately establishes secondary facts from which the main fact may be\r\ninferred, and is typically characterized by inference or presumption. It is not something that one\r\nobserves; but from facts one can draw a conclusion.  Circumstantial evidence is just as competent\r\nor capable of proving a fact in issue as is direct evidence.\r\n\r\nViolation of the law may be proved by: direct evidence; circumstantial evidence; or a combination\r\nof direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.\r\n\r\nCircumstantial evidence is permissible, provided \r\n  it meets the legal test. To the extent that the state relies on circumstantial \r\n  evidence, the state must prove all the circumstances relied upon beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt. The circumstances relied upon by the state must be wholly and in every \r\n  particular perfectly consistent with one another. The circumstances must point \r\n  conclusively -- that is, to a moral certainty -- to the guilt of the accused \r\n  to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis. In other words, the circumstances \r\n  relied upon by the state must be absolutely inconsistent with any other reasonable \r\n  hypothesis than the guilt of the accused.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the preceding principle is that \r\n  all presumptions of law, independent of evidence, are in favor of innocence. \r\n  Every person is presumed innocent until he is proved guilty beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt. One cannot be convicted on suspicion, however strong that suspicion may \r\n  be.\r\n\r\nThe law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight \r\n  or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial \r\n  evidence. Nor is a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence \r\n  than of direct evidence. You should weigh all the evidence in the case. After \r\n  weighing all the evidence, if you are not convinced of the guilt of the defendant \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant not guilty.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, I vote to AFFIRM \r\n  the trial judge's denial of the defendant's motion for directed verdict.\r\n\r\nI vote to REVERSE the trial judge \r\n  on the issue of the circumstantial evidence charge. I hold the defendant is \r\n  entitled to a jury charge on circumstantial evidence as proposed herein.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I vote to REVERSE AND REMAND \r\n  for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., (concurring and dissenting):  \r\n  Judge Stilwell's opinion concludes the circumstantial evidence reasonably tended \r\n  to prove Cherry's intent to distribute, and the trial judge properly denied \r\n  the motion for directed verdict. I respectfully disagree and would reverse the \r\n  conviction. Judge Stilwell's opinion also concludes the recommended jury charge \r\n  from State v. Grippon (8) was legally \r\n  sufficient, and the trial judge did not err in refusing the more extensive circumstantial \r\n  evidence charge approved in State v. Edwards. (9) \r\n  I agree with Judge Stilwell on this point and concur in that portion of his \r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nDirected Verdict \r\n\r\nCherry asserts the State failed to present any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence to\r\nestablish that he intended to distribute the crack cocaine.  I agree.\r\n\r\nWhen construing a motion for directed verdict in a criminal \r\n  case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, \r\n  and not its weight. State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  126, 127 (2000). A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State \r\n  fails to produce evidence of the charged offense. State v. Lollis, 343 \r\n  S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001). \"On appeal from the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State.\" Id. at 583, 541 S.E.2d at 256.\r\n\r\nIf the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence \r\n  to prove the offense, \"[t]he trial judge is required to submit the case to the \r\n  jury if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the \r\n  guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.\" \r\n  Id., at 584, 541 S.E.2d at 256 (quoting Mitchell, 341 S.C. at \r\n  409, 535 S.E.2d at 127). Evidence which merely raises a suspicion of guilt is \r\n  not sufficient to survive a motion for directed verdict. State v. Martin, \r\n  340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000). \"'Suspicion' implies a belief or opinion \r\n  as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.\" \r\n  Lollis, 343 S.C. at 584, 541 S.E.2d at 256.\r\n\r\nThe State's case depended entirely upon circumstantial evidence. This evidence (10) included the\r\nfollowing: 1) Cherry's arrest occurred late at night; 2) Cherry had a small bag containing\r\napproximately eight rocks of crack cocaine; 3) Cherry had no pipe or other drug paraphernalia\r\nwhich would indicate the crack cocaine was for his personal use; 4) Cherry had $322 in cash,\r\nmostly in twenty dollar bills; and 5) The arresting officer testified a single rock of crack cocaine is\r\ntypically sold for twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the defendant possesses more than one gram \r\n  of crack cocaine, there is a permissible statutory inference of intent to distribute. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (Supp. 2000). In the present case, the State could \r\n  not rely on this statutory inference. See State v. Simpson, 275 S.C. \r\n  426, 272 S.E.2d 431 (1980). However, \"[p]ossession of any amount of \r\n  controlled substance when coupled with sufficient indicium of intent to distribute \r\n  will support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute.\" State \r\n  v. Goldsmith, 301 S.C. 463, 466, 392 S.E.2d 787, 788 (1990) (stating that \r\n  \"[p]roof of possession of drug paraphernalia is sufficient indicia of intent \r\n  to distribute\" where marijuana, cocaine, mairjuana seeds, scales and other drug \r\n  paraphernalia were found by police); State v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 134, \r\n  352 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1987) (stating \"that evidence of various drug paraphernalia \r\n  and residue of controlled substances was sufficient to submit the case to the \r\n  jury\").\r\n\r\nThe circumstantial evidence in this case is not substantial and merely raises a suspicion of guilt. \r\nThe crack cocaine was not packaged in individual bags.  The police found no scales or other drug\r\nparaphernalia used for distribution.  There was no testimony to establish that eight rocks of crack\r\ncocaine weighing less than one gram are more than a user would likely purchase and possess at\r\none time.  In short, the evidence does not reasonably tend to prove Cherry intended to distribute\r\ncrack cocaine.  It merely raises a suspicion of such an intent.  For this reason, I would rule that the\r\ntrial judge erred in failing to grant a directed verdict of acquittal on the possession of crack\r\ncocaine with the intent to distribute charge. (11)\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstantial Evidence Instruction\r\nCherry also argues that the Edwards charge, which \r\n  includes an instruction that the circumstantial evidence in a case of this type \r\n  must exclude every other reasonable hypothesis but guilt, is still a proper \r\n  statement of the law. He contends it was reversible error to refuse the charge \r\n  because he specifically requested it.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for this argument is that the Grippon \r\n  charge, which does not include the \"exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis\" \r\n  language of Edwards, is not functionally equivalent to the Edwards \r\n  charge. This foundation is a necessary linchpin for Cherry's position because \r\n  a charge must be read as a whole, and if it adequately expresses the required \r\n  principles, there is no harm by the failure to include the\r\n\r\nspecific language requested. State v. Hughey, 339 \r\n  S.C. 439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 946 \r\n  (2000). \"The substance of the law must be charged to the jury, not particular \r\n  verbiage.\" Id. A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct definition \r\n  and adequately covers the law when the charge is read as a whole. Id. \r\n  \"To warrant reversal, a trial judge's refusal to give a requested jury charge \r\n  must be both erroneous and prejudicial.\" Id.; see also State \r\n  v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 508 S.E.2d 857 (1998).\r\n\r\nI agree with Judge Stilwell's conclusion that this argument \r\n  misconstrues the holding in Grippon. In that case, the defendant also \r\n  requested the Edwards \"exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis\" \r\n  language sought by Cherry. As in this case, the trial judge refused the request. \r\n  Our supreme court affirmed, finding the charge, when taken as a whole, adequately \r\n  conveyed the level of proof necessary to find the defendant guilty. Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. at 82, 489 S.E.2d at 463. Furthermore, the court recommended a circumstantial \r\n  evidence jury charge which does not contain the requested language. \r\n  See Id., at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Needs, the supreme court described this \r\n  recommended charge as one which \"makes no distinction between circumstantial \r\n  and direct evidence.\" 333 S.C. at 156, n.13, 508 S.E.2d at 868, n.13. \r\n  (12) To accept Cherry's argument, one must conclude that our supreme \r\n  court, in Grippon, recommended as a complete circumstantial evidence \r\n  charge an instruction which makes no distinction between circumstantial and \r\n  direct evidence, knowing it to be an inadequate explanation of the law. This \r\n  conclusion is implausible. Therefore, even though the inclusion of the \"reasonable \r\n  hypothesis language\" is not harmful error, under the authority of Grippon \r\n  and Needs, the failure to include it cannot be reversible error \r\n  either.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree with Judge Stilwell's determination \r\n  that the jury charge fully complied with the requirements of South Carolina \r\n  law, as set forth in Grippon. However, there is an absence of any direct \r\n  or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove an intent \r\n  to distribute, or from which the intent to distribute crack cocaine can fairly \r\n  and logically be deduced. For this reason, I would reverse the conviction for \r\n  possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., (concurring in part and dissenting \r\nin part):   While I concur in Judge Stilwell's \r\nopinion to the extent it finds the trial court properly submitted the case to \r\nthe jury, I disagree with the conclusion reached regarding the circumstantial \r\nevidence charge and, with responsive changes, respectfully adhere to my original \r\ndissent. \r\nThe trial court instructed the jury pursuant to State \r\n  v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 84, 489 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1997) (\"The law makes \r\n  absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either \r\n  direct or circumstantial evidence. Nor is a greater degree of certainty required \r\n  of circumstantial evidence . . . .\"). Upon realizing the court failed to give \r\n  the conventional charge on circumstantial evidence, Cherry's counsel, noting \r\n  that Grippon \"does not preclude a more thorough charge,\" requested further \r\n  instructions. As Judge Stilwell correctly observes, the charge requested is \r\n  comparable to the traditional language enunciated by our supreme court in State \r\n  v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955) and later quoted with \r\n  approval in State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 \r\n  (1989) (\"[E]very circumstance relied upon by the State [must] be proven beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt . . . and taken together, point conclusively to the guilt \r\n  of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.\"). Because \r\n  I agree that a fuller Edwards-type instruction was both appropriate and \r\n  warranted under the circumstances, I would find the court's failure to further \r\n  instruct the jury was error.\r\n\r\nThere is no question the charging language set forth in \r\n  both Grippon and Edwards is valid. See State v. Needs, \r\n  333 S.C. 134, 159 n.13, 508 S.E.2d 857, 870 n.13 (1998) (reaffirming the \"well \r\n  established\" Edwards charge and stating that the court recently approved \r\n  a charge in Grippon \"that makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial \r\n  evidence\"). However, while I concur in the view that the law does not discriminate \r\n  between the relative weight or probative value of direct versus circumstantial \r\n  evidence, I must disagree with Judge Stilwell's assertion that the traditional \r\n  Edwards instruction \"distinguishes\" between the two. Edwards, \r\n  in fact, makes no mention of direct evidence; it merely outlines the test \r\n  which the jury should use in evaluating circumstantial evidence. See \r\n  Littlejohn, 228 S.C. at 328, 89 S.E.2d at 926 (describing the charge as \r\n  the \"test by which circumstantial evidence is to be measured by the jury in \r\n  its deliberations\"). The question, then, is not whether both charges are legally \r\n  correct, but, as Judge Howard notes, whether they are \"functionally equivalent.\" \r\n  I do not believe they are.\r\n\r\nIn a criminal case, the test set forth in Edwards \r\n  may be critical to a just resolution because of the nature of circumstantial \r\n  evidence. See Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, \r\n  338 n.6, 534 S.E.2d 672, 681 n.6 (2000) (wherein the court, while concluding \r\n  circumstantial and direct evidence are equally valid and convincing, recognized \r\n  that Edwards \"indicates circumstantial evidence requires greater scrutiny \r\n  than direct evidence in a criminal proceeding\"). Unlike direct evidence, which \r\n  the jury may accept or reject on its face, a proper assessment of circumstantial \r\n  evidence requires the jury to decide not only whether the facts and circumstances \r\n  presented are true, but also whether the defendant's guilt logically can be \r\n  inferred. See State v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520, 525 n.1, 541 S.E.2d 247, \r\n  249 n.1 (2001) (\"Direct evidence immediately establishes the main fact to be \r\n  proved. Circumstantial evidence immediately establishes collateral facts from \r\n  which the main fact may be inferred, and is typically characterized by inference \r\n  or presumption.\") (citations omitted); People v. Wachowicz, 239 N.E.2d \r\n  620, 622 (N.Y. 1968) (\"In the end, it is a question whether common human experience \r\n  would lead a reasonable man, putting his mind to it, to reject or accept the \r\n  inferences asserted for the established facts.\").\r\n\r\nThus, the use of circumstantial evidence asks the jury to \r\n  employ analytical tools in a complex reasoning process not otherwise needed \r\n  when reviewing direct evidence alone. Unfortunately, in so doing it also invites \r\n  the danger of \"logical gaps\" legitimately associated with circumstantial evidence \r\n  -- that the jury may surmise guilt from \"subjective inferential links based \r\n  on probabilities\" and thereby elevate coincidence or suspicion into permissible \r\n  inference. People v. Cleague, 239 N.E.2d 617, 619 (N.Y. 1968).\r\n\r\nIn my view, the traditional Edwards charge provides \r\n  the appropriate analytical framework for focusing the jury's deliberative process \r\n  in a case such as this, where the State relies solely on circumstantial evidence \r\n  to prove an element of the crime. The charge recommended in Grippon, \r\n  on the other hand, unquestionably fails to alert the jury to the unique nature \r\n  of circumstantial evidence. (13) Surely, if \r\n  Grippon stands for anything it is the proposition that circumstantial \r\n  and direct evidence are equally valid methods of proving guilt, not that they \r\n  are identical methods of doing so. See State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, \r\n  ___, 548 S.E.2d 210, 212 (2001) (finding Grippon's recommended charge \r\n  \"emphasizes the lack of distinction between the weight to be given \r\n  to direct and circumstantial evidence\" and therefore approving the trial court's \r\n  use of an instruction stating that \"circumstantial evidence is just as competent \r\n  or capable of proving a fact in issue as is direct evidence\") (emphasis added); \r\n  Salisbury, 343 S.C. at 525 n.1, 541 S.E.2d at 249 n.1 (discussing difference \r\n  between direct and circumstantial evidence).\r\n\r\nWithout question, the law to be charged in a particular \r\n  case is determined by the evidence presented at trial. State v. Long, \r\n  325 S.C. 59, 480 S.E.2d 62 (1997); State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 472 \r\n  S.E.2d 241 (1996). Accordingly, it is well settled that a trial court commits \r\n  reversible error when it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised \r\n  by the evidence. See State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999); \r\n  State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993). As our \r\n  supreme court has stated, \"[a] request to charge a correct statement of the \r\n  law on an issue raised by the indictment and the evidence presented at trial \r\n  should not be refused.\" State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830, \r\n  831 (1989); see also State v. Addison, 343 S.C. 290, 540 S.E.2d 449 (2000); \r\n  State v. Kimbrell, 294 S.C. 51, 362 S.E.2d 630 (1987).\r\n\r\nAlthough the refusal to give a specific charge may not be \r\n  error \"when the given instructions use the proper test for determining the \r\n  issues before the jury,\" State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 452, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 721, 728 (2000), such is not the case when the charge as given fails \r\n  to cover the substance of the request. See State v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, \r\n  535 S.E.2d 431 (2000) (failure to tailor jury instructions to adequately reflect \r\n  facts and theories presented by the defendant constituted reversible error); \r\n  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000) (court must fashion \r\n  an appropriate charge when defendant requests more than the standard self-defense \r\n  charge and the evidence supports the request); Battle v. State, 305 S.C. \r\n  460, 409 S.E.2d 400 (1991) (counsel was ineffective in failing to request additional \r\n  jury instructions on self-defense when warranted by the evidence, despite fact \r\n  that judge had instructed jury in accordance with prior court-approved self-defense \r\n  charge); State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 377 S.E.2d 328 (1989) (court \r\n  erred in giving a prior-approved charge exclusively without considering the \r\n  facts and circumstances of the particular case when defense counsel repeatedly \r\n  requested additional charges based in common law); Kimbrell, 294 S.C. \r\n  at 56, 362 S.E.2d at 632 (reversing conviction for cocaine trafficking where \r\n  the charge requested was a correct statement of the law but charge given did \r\n  not adequately cover the substance of the request); State v. Brownlee, \r\n  318 S.C. 34, 38, 455 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 1995) (reversing conviction for \r\n  possession with intent to distribute because, \"although the charge as given \r\n  correctly stated the elements of the offense, it did not adequately cover the \r\n  substance of [the defendant's] request\").\r\n\r\nThe charge requested by Cherry is a correct statement of \r\n  the law on circumstantial evidence. See Needs, 333 S.C. at 159 n.13, \r\n  508 S.E.2d at 870 n.13; Edwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 S.E.2d at 889. \r\n  From Cherry's perspective, because the jury could have found the sum of the \r\n  circumstantial facts asserted by the State to be as consistent with innocence \r\n  of distribution as with guilt, a charge that these facts, taken together, \r\n  must point conclusively to his guilt to the exclusion of every other reasonable \r\n  hypothesis before a conviction could stand was imperative. Hence, I would find \r\n  the inferential nature of the circumstances presented in this case justified \r\n  additional instructions to guide the jury in making appropriate logical inferences \r\n  and thus deny a finding of guilt based on mere probability. \r\n  (14) See Grippon, 327 S.C. at 87-88, 489 S.E.2d at 466-67 (Toal, \r\n  J., concurring in result only) (In \"clarif[ying] the jury's responsibility to \r\n  evaluate circumstantial evidence carefully,\" the Edwards charge forecloses \r\n  the possibility that the jury \"'may leap logical gaps in the proof offered and \r\n  draw unwarranted conclusions based on probabilities of low degree.'\") (quoting \r\n  People v. Ford, 488 N.E.2d 458, 465 (N.Y. 1985)).\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be noted that nothing in Grippon \r\n  or Needs precludes a trial court from giving the more detailed Edwards \r\n  charge, including the language that all of the circumstances proffered by the \r\n  State must \"point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion \r\n  of every other reasonable hypothesis.\" Edwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 \r\n  S.E.2d at 889; see Grippon, 327 S.C. at 82, 489 S.E.2d at 462 (reiterating \r\n  the supreme court has \"never rejected the 'reasonable hypothesis' phrase or \r\n  found [that it] shifted the burden of proof\" from the State). To the contrary, \r\n  because the charges outlined in Grippon and Edwards serve different \r\n  purposes, they are inherently complementary, not mutually exclusive. Indeed, \r\n  in State v. Graddick our supreme court recently affirmed an instruction \r\n  that \"was a hybrid of the traditional [Edwards] circumstantial evidence charge \r\n  and the charge approved in Grippon.\" Graddick, 345 S.C. at ___, \r\n  548 S.E.2d at 212.\r\n\r\nAs our supreme court has said, \"[t]he purpose of a charge \r\n  is to enlighten the jury. This purpose is accomplished by a statement of the \r\n  law which fits the concrete case . . . .\" State v. Fair, 209 S.C. 439, \r\n  445, 40 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1946) (quoting State v. DuRant, 87 S.C. 532, \r\n  534, 70 S.E. 306, 307 (1911)). In my view, while the Grippon charge \"obviously \r\n  is a correct statement of the law,\" it does not cover the substance of Cherry's \r\n  requested instruction. It was therefore error to refuse the request.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the court's failure to give the additional \r\n  instruction cannot be considered harmless, because there exists a reasonable \r\n  likelihood the jury was unaware it should acquit if it found the combined circumstances \r\n  relied upon by the State equally susceptible of an inference inconsistent with \r\n  guilt of the crime charged. See, e.g., State v. Jefferies, 316 \r\n  S.C. 13, 22, 446 S.E.2d 427, 432 (1994) (\"In making a harmless error analysis, \r\n  our inquiry is not what would the verdict have been had the jury been given \r\n  the correct charge, but rather did the erroneous charge contribute to the verdict \r\n  rendered.\"). In my opinion, Cherry was prejudiced by the court's refusal to \r\n  give the requested charge, particularly in light of a clearly impermissible \r\n  closing argument wherein the solicitor stated there was evidence Cherry \"had \r\n  already distributed some crack,\" and that there was \"no evidence that he was \r\n  going to use [the crack] personally for himself.\" Accordingly, I would reverse \r\n  the conviction and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.: (joining in the dissents \r\n  of Judge Howard and Judge Shuler) I respectfully dissent from Judge \r\n  Stilwell's opinion. I agree in part with Judge Howard's dissent. I also believe \r\n  Cherry should have been granted a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nI also agree with Judge Shuler's opinion that the circumstantial \r\n  evidence charge was insufficient, and therefore Cherry should receive a new \r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  We have not factored in nor considered \r\n  the presence of the pistol in the vehicle because the trial judge, in analyzing \r\n  whether to submit the case to the jury, specifically stated that he did not \r\n  consider it in his deliberations.  \r\n 2.  See, e.g., State v. Williams, \r\n  35 S.C. 344, 14 S.E. 819 (1892).  \r\n3.    298 S.C. \r\n  at 274, 379 S.E.2d at 888. \r\n4.  See 397 U.S. at 361-64, 90 \r\n  S. Ct. at 1071-73 for the Court's analysis of the constitutionality of the reasonable \r\n  doubt standard:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The requirement that guilt of a criminal charge be established \r\n    by proof beyond a reasonable doubt dates at least from our early years as \r\n    a Nation.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  Expressions in many opinions of this Court indicate that \r\n    it has long been assumed that proof of a charge beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n    is constitutionally required. See, for example, â€¦ Holland v. United \r\n    States [citation omitted] â€¦.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  Lest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature \r\n    of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the Due Process \r\n    Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a \r\n    reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which \r\n    he is charged.  \r\n\r\n5.  See id.  at 84, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  at 465 (citing State v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995) \r\n  and State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d 372 (1991), impliedly \r\n  overruled on other grounds by State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  248 (2000)). In Raffaldt and Manning, the Supreme Court disapproved \r\n  of circumstantial evidence charges that required the jury \"to seek\" explanations \r\n  for the circumstantial evidence.  \r\n6.    31 Hous. \r\n  L.

Holder was recently overruled \r\n  in Idaho v. Humpherys, 8 P.3d 652 (Idaho 2000). Idaho became a jurisdiction \r\n  that recognizes the Holland rule. Notwithstanding the demise of Holder, \r\n  Judge Burnett's writing in Holman remains an eloquent and forceful defense \r\n  of the proposition that the \"reasonable hypothesis\" instruction is a necessary \r\n  additive to the circumstantial evidence charge.  \r\n8.  327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997). \r\n   \r\n9.  298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989). \r\n10.  This evidence does not include \r\n  the handgun. The trial judge ruled the handgun was not attributable to Cherry \r\n  and specifically excluded it from consideration during the directed verdict \r\n  motion. Furthermore, even if the judge had considered it, no evidence was presented \r\n  from which the jury could infer an intent to distribute the crack cocaine, as \r\n  opposed to simply possessing it for personal use. See State v. Kimbrell, \r\n  294 S.C. 51, 55, 362 S.E.2d 630, 632 (1987) (ruling presence of handgun relevant \r\n  and admissible to establish possession of cocaine, because a jury \"could well \r\n  have inferred that [defendant] was using the pistol for protection of the cocaine\"). \r\n11.  In his concurring opinion, Judge \r\n  Goolsby incorrectly characterizes my analysis as 'weighing\" the evidence. This \r\n  is the standard criticism of those who would surrender the obligation of the \r\n  court to make the threshold determination that the evidence is sufficient to \r\n  support a conviction and would take refuge, instead, in the \"good common sense\" \r\n  of jurors. Unfortunately, jurors are only human, and are subject to the normal \r\n  vagaries of life, including basing decisions on emotion and preconceived ideas. \r\n  As our Supreme Court noted, properly instructing the jury is not a sufficient \r\n  procedural safeguard against improper verdicts based upon matters outside of \r\n  the evidence. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318 (1979) (\"After \r\n  Winship the critical inquiry on review of sufficiency of the evidence \r\n  to support a criminal conviction must be not simply to determine whether the \r\n  jury was properly instructed, but to determine whether the record evidence could \r\n  reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\").\r\n\r\nThe question presented is whether the evidence is capable \r\n  of supporting the conviction, employing reason and logic, should the jury choose \r\n  to believe all or a portion of it. There is no \"weighing\" of the evidence involved. \r\n  Indeed, the evidence and all inferences must be viewed in a light most favorable \r\n  to the State. But if the court determines that the circumstances, alone and \r\n  in combination, are equally consistent with innocence as with guilt, then the \r\n  court has necessarily concluded that the evidence is incapable of providing \r\n  a reasonable and logical basis for determining guilt. It is the obligation of \r\n  the court in that instance to direct a verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\n12. In Needs, our supreme court \r\n  stated \"[w]e have identified two appropriate ways to define reasonable doubt \r\n  and two appropriate ways to charge circumstantial evidence. Trial courts \r\n  should rarely find it necessary to deviate from those approved charges.\" \r\n  333 S.C. at 155-156, 508 S.E.2d at 868 (emphasis added). This latter sentence \r\n  should not be misconstrued to suggest that the \"exclusion of every other reasonable \r\n  hypothesis\" language could be required, if requested, in a purely circumstantial \r\n  or factually close case. Such an approach would impermissibly require weighing \r\n  the evidence by the trial court, and implies that a greater explanation of the \r\n  burden of proof is necessary when the judge believes the case is a close one. \r\n  Such a subjective rule would not meet the requirements of Due Process. See \r\n  Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993). \r\n13.  Interestingly, the Grippon \r\n  charge stems from the Supreme Court's decision in Holland v. United States, \r\n  348 U.S. 121 (1954). While it is true that Holland, a tax evasion case \r\n  involving the \"net worth\" method of circumstantial proof, proposed as the \"better \r\n  rule\" the charging language later articulated in Grippon, it was not \r\n  without qualification. Id. at 139. To the contrary, the Holland \r\n  Court referenced the \"great danger\" associated with equivocal circumstantial \r\n  evidence -- that once the prosecution established the necessary circumstances \r\n  a jury might assume the inferential crime automatically followed, despite reasonable \r\n  explanations offered by the defense. Id. at 127-28. Accordingly, the \r\n  Court warned that jury charges in such cases \"should be especially clear, including, \r\n  in addition to the formal instructions, a summary of the nature of the [circumstantial \r\n  evidence] method . . . and the inferences available both for and against \r\n  the accused.\" Id. at 129.  \r\n14.  I disagree with Judge Howard that \r\n  this approach would \"impermissibly require weighing the evidence.\" To me, the \r\n  trial court's decision on whether to give additional guidance would be the same \r\n  as in any case where the court must determine whether the evidence supports \r\n  a particular charge. Nor do I agree that it \"implies that a greater explanation \r\n  of the burden of proof is necessary when the judge believes the case is a close \r\n  one.\" What Edwards offers is not a superior explanation of the burden \r\n  of proof; rather, it is at least some explanation of how the jury should analyze \r\n  circumstantial evidence in order to employ it appropriately in deciding if the \r\n  State has met that burden. Furthermore, in my opinion, continued approval of \r\n  the Edwards language is rendered superfluous if the charge is not given \r\n  when warranted by the facts and circumstances of a particular case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3407","title":"Jones v.

The master-in-equity granted Equicredit summary judgment on all causes \r\nof action. Jones appeals. We affirm. \r\n\r\n    FACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1984 Mr. Jones borrowed $14,981.52 from Freedlander \r\n  Inc., The Mortgage People, securing the loan with a second mortgage on his house. \r\n  In October 1987 Freedlander assigned Jones's note and mortgage to the Federal \r\n  National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). Fannie Mae contracted with Old Stone \r\n  Credit Corporation (OSCC), Equicredit's predecessor in interest, to service \r\n  the loan. (2)\r\n\r\n By August 1990 Jones's mortgage was delinquent. In a modification \r\n  agreement, Jones and Fannie Mae increased the loan's principal balance by all \r\n  past due amounts, extended the term of the loan, reduced the interest rate, \r\n  and established a new monthly payment amount.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 OSCC filed a foreclosure action. No deficiency judgment \r\n  was requested in the foreclosure complaint. Jones defaulted. The master issued \r\n  a foreclosure decree on January 13, 1993. On January 27, 1993, Jones filed for \r\n  bankruptcy, staying the foreclosure sale. In April 1994 Fannie Mae and Jones \r\n  again restructured the debt. The principal balance on the loan was increased \r\n  to $32,589.32 to include past due amounts, the term of the loan was further \r\n  extended, and the monthly payments were lowered. Jones immediately failed to \r\n  make payments under the restructured agreement.\r\n\r\nIn June 1994 Jones received a discharge of debts in bankruptcy. \r\n  In August 1994 the master entered an Order to Restore and Proceed with Foreclosure. \r\n  In addition, the master entered a supplemental order finding Jones's debt after \r\n  the bankruptcy totaled $35,437.36. Jones filed a second bankruptcy action, again \r\n  staying the foreclosure sale. Equicredit obtained relief from the stay. In January \r\n  1996 a second Order to Restore and Proceed with Foreclosure was entered. Jones \r\n  filed a third bankruptcy, once again staying the foreclosure sale.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1996, fire damaged the house on the mortgaged \r\n  property. The house was insured under two policies: one associated with the \r\n  first mortgage and the other associated with the second mortgage. The damage \r\n  was appraised for insurance purposes at approximately $41,000. Each of the insurance \r\n  companies assumed responsibility for payment of one-half of the damage.\r\n\r\nWith the insurance proceeds of approximately $21,000, the \r\n  first mortgage lien-holder retired the first mortgage debt of approximately \r\n  $5,000 and distributed the remaining proceeds to Jones. TIG, the insurer connected \r\n  with the second mortgage, tendered payment of approximately $21,000 in the form \r\n  of a check payable to Equicredit and Jones as co-payees. TIG mailed the check \r\n  to Equicredit. Equicredit claimed entitlement to the entire proceeds to apply \r\n  against Jones's remaining balance on the Fannie Mae judgment.\r\n\r\nOn December 12, 1996, Jones's third bankruptcy action was \r\n  dismissed. On March 7, 1997, the property was sold at a foreclosure sale for \r\n  a bid of $500 made by Equicredit on behalf of Fannie Mae. \r\n  (3) Jones's debt to Fannie Mae at the time exceeded $46,800. In July \r\n  or August of 1997, Fannie Mae sold the property to a third party for $12,500.\r\n\r\nJones instituted this action seeking recovery of the insurance \r\n  proceeds and alleging conversion, breach of contract, and bad faith refusal \r\n  to pay insurance benefits. Equicredit moved for summary judgment. After a hearing, \r\n  the master determined Equicredit was entitled to the insurance proceeds and \r\n  granted Equicredit summary judgment on all of Jones's causes of action. Jones \r\n  appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, \r\n  301 S.C. 493, 497, 392 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1990). In determining whether any triable \r\n  issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the evidence and \r\n  all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party. Id. An appellate court reviews the trial court's \r\n  order granting summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial \r\n  court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP. Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 \r\n  S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Insurable Interest\r\nJones argues the master erred in ruling that Equicredit \r\n  was entitled to retain the insurance proceeds. Jones contends Equicredit did \r\n  not have an insurable interest in the property after the foreclosure sale. Jones \r\n  avers Equicredit was an assignee of Fannie Mae and thus had only a mortgagee's \r\n  insurable interest. Jones argues Fannie Mae's interest in the insurance proceeds \r\n  terminated when the property was sold at the foreclosure sale without the right \r\n  to a deficiency judgment, and Equicredit's insurable interest as an assignee \r\n  likewise terminated. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Benton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Boden, this court \r\n  defined an insurable interest:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It may be said, generally, that any one has an insurable \r\n    interest in property who derives a benefit from its existence or would suffer \r\n    loss from its destruction. An insurable interest in property is any right, \r\n    benefit or advantage arising out of or dependent thereon, or any liability \r\n    in respect thereof, or any relation to or concern therein of such a nature \r\n    that it might be so affected by the contemplated peril as to directly damnify \r\n    the insured.\r\n\r\n   . . . The term 'interest,' as used in the phrase 'insurable \r\n    interest,' is not limited to property or ownership in the subject matter of \r\n    the insurance . . . . [A]n insurable interest in property may arise from some \r\n    liability which insured incurs with relation thereto . . . . Such liability \r\n    may arise by force of statute or by contract, or may be fixed by law from \r\n    the obligations which insured assumes.\r\n\r\n  . . . Moreover, an insurable interest in property does not \r\n    necessarily imply a property interest in, or a lien upon, or possession of, \r\n    the subject matter of the insurance, and neither the title nor a beneficial \r\n    interest is requisite to the existence of such an interest, it is sufficient \r\n    that the insured is so situated with reference to the property that he would \r\n    be liable to loss should it be injured or destroyed by the peril against which \r\n    it is insured. For instance, although a person has no title, legal or equitable, \r\n    in the property, and neither possession nor right to possession, yet he has \r\n    an insurable interest therein if it is primarily charged in either law or \r\n    equity with a debt or obligation for which he is secondarily liable. \r\n\r\n\r\n310 S.C. 400, 403-04, 426 S.E.2d 823, 825-26 (Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (internal citations omitted). \r\n\r\nJones argues Equicredit was Fannie Mae's assignee for purposes \r\n  of determining Equicredit's insurable interest. We disagree. As found by the \r\n  master, Equicredit was Fannie Mae's servicing agent and, as such, possessed \r\n  an insurable interest separate and distinct from Fannie Mae's interest by virtue \r\n  of its contract with Fannie Mae. \r\n\r\nThe terms of Equicredit's contract with Fannie Mae support \r\n  the master's conclusion that Equicredit has an insurable interest distinct from \r\n  Fannie Mae's interest. The contract states Equicredit is guilty of a breach \r\n  in the event it fails \"to renew or ensure renewal of any required insurance \r\n  policy on any mortgage (including mortgaged property) serviced under this Contract.\" \r\n  The agreement also defines as a breach \"failure to take prompt and diligent \r\n  action under applicable law or regulation to collect past due sums on mortgages, \r\n  or to take any other diligent action described in our Guides that we reasonably \r\n  require for mortgages in default.\" Further, the servicing agreement obligated \r\n  Equicredit to indemnify and hold Fannie Mae harmless \"from any losses [Fannie \r\n  Mae] may suffer as a result of [Equicredit's] negligence.\" \r\n\r\nThe terms of Equicredit's insurance policy with TIG also \r\n  support the master's conclusion that Equicredit had an individual insurable \r\n  interest in the property. The policy consists of two parts, the Master Policy \r\n  and the Standard Fire Policy. By its terms, the Master Policy controls in the \r\n  event of any conflict between the terms and conditions contained therein and \r\n  those contained in the Standard Fire Policy \"unless the coverages and conditions \r\n  . . . are more restrictive than the Standard Fire Policy in which case the Standard \r\n  Fire Policy provisions prevail.\" Equicredit is listed as \"Named Insured\" on \r\n  two endorsements to the Master Policy. Jones, as mortgagor, is referred to separately \r\n  as \"Borrower\" and as an \"additional insured.\" The declarations page on the Standard \r\n  Fire Policy lists Jones as the insured and Equicredit as the mortgagee, but \r\n  provides: \"loss, if any, on building items, shall be payable to [Equicredit].\" \r\n  The Master Policy expressly limits Jones's right to recover to \"residual amounts \r\n  of insurance over and above\" Equicredit's \"insurable interest.\" Moreover, under \r\n  its \"Coverage\" heading, the Master Policy expressly recognizes Equicredit's \r\n  insurable interest as a servicing agent rather than as a mortgagee:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This Agreement applies to direct physical loss or damage \r\n    by the perils insured against to all real property (buildings) in which the \r\n    Insured has an interest as mortgagee, as servicing agent by written agreement, \r\n    or as owner through foreclosure . . . . (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no South Carolina case expressly considering the \r\n  insurable interest of a mortgagee's servicing agent. When there is no South \r\n  Carolina case directly on point, our court may look to other jurisdictions for \r\n  persuasive authority. See Williams v. Morris, 320 S.C. 196, 200, 464 \r\n  S.E.2d 97, 99 (1995) (applying the law of foreign jurisdictions in the absence \r\n  of governing South Carolina law). The Michigan Court of Appeals recognized the \r\n  insurable interest of a mortgagee's servicing agent who contracted to maintain \r\n  insurance on the mortgaged property:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The contractual duty to procure insurance gives rise to \r\n    an insurable interest, as the party bound to obtain insurance will suffer \r\n    a pecuniary loss on destruction of the property in the absence of insurance. \r\n    \r\n\r\n  . . .[The servicing agent] was contractually bound to procure \r\n    insurance on the property in question. If it had failed to do so, it would \r\n    have been liable . . . for the loss under the servicing agreement. Absent \r\n    insurance, [the servicing agent] would suffer a pecuniary loss on the destruction \r\n    of the premises. \r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Mortgage Corp. v. Michigan Basic Prop. Ins. Ass'n., \r\n  261 N.W.2d 5, 8 (Mich. Ct. App. 1977).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the master's analysis as to the unique insurable \r\n  interest a servicing agent holds as opposed to a mortgagee. Equicredit's insurable \r\n  interest stems from its potential liability to Fannie Mae pursuant to its obligations \r\n  under the servicing agreement to protect Fannie Mae from loss and to maintain \r\n  proper insurance on the property. More specifically, as noted in the order granting \r\n  summary judgment, \"[f]ailure to obtain the insurance proceeds at issue could \r\n  trigger contractual liability under the Servicing Agreement.\" Because Equicredit \r\n  is exposed to potential liability to Fannie Mae for any losses incurred on Jones's \r\n  mortgage, Equicredit had an insurable interest in the property. Unlike a mortgagee's \r\n  insurable interest, which is extinguished when the note underlying the mortgage \r\n  is satisfied (which is not the case here), Equicredit's insurable interest is \r\n  based on its potential liability under the servicing agreement, and would not \r\n  be extinguished even if the mortgage indebtedness is satisfied. Cf. Singletary \r\n  v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 316 S.C. 199, 447 S.E.2d 869 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n   (4)\r\n\r\nWere we to agree with Jones's argument that Equicredit was \r\n  an assignee of Fannie Mae's interest in the insurance proceeds, Equicredit would \r\n  still be entitled to the proceeds because Fannie Mae did not waive its right \r\n  to the proceeds, as argued by Jones, with its waiver of a deficiency judgment \r\n  in the foreclosure action.\r\n\r\nA mortgagor and a mortgagee have independent insurable interests \r\n  in the property covered by the mortgage. Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, \r\n  3 Couch on Insurance 3d Â§ 42:28, at 42-35 (1997). Ordinarily, the rights \r\n  of a mortgagee to insurance proceeds are determined at the time of a fire loss. \r\n  Singletary, 316 S.C. at 201, 447 S.E.2d at 870. However, a mortgagee's \r\n  rights under an insurance policy are terminated if, after a fire loss, the underlying \r\n  debt is satisfied by a purchaser at a foreclosure sale. Id.  at 200-01, \r\n  447 S.E.2d at 870. \r\n\r\nIn Singletary, a mortgagee assigned its rights to \r\n  insurance proceeds to the purchaser at a foreclosure sale after the sale satisfied \r\n  the mortgage indebtedness. Id. at 200, 447 S.E.2d at 869. This court \r\n  held that the assignment of rights transferred no interest in the insurance \r\n  proceeds to the purchaser. The court reasoned that as assignee of the mortgagee's \r\n  interest, the purchaser could claim no higher rights than the mortgagee had \r\n  at the time of assignment. Because a party cannot claim insurance proceeds in \r\n  excess of his interest in the insured property, and the mortgage indebtedness \r\n  was fully satisfied at the time of assignment, the mortgagee had no interest \r\n  in the insurance proceeds to convey at the time of assignment. Id. at \r\n  201-02, 447 S.E.2d at 870-71.\r\n\r\nIn this action, unlike in Singletary, the foreclosure \r\n  sale did not satisfy Jones's mortgage indebtedness to Fannie Mae. Thus, Jones's \r\n  reliance on Singletary is misplaced.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the waiver of deficiency in the foreclosure \r\n  action would not have prevented Fannie Mae from pursuing the insurance proceeds. \r\n  A mortgagee who waives deficiency \"simply elects to rely solely on the mortgage \r\n  security for satisfaction of his debt. . . .\" Sellars v. First Colonial Corp., \r\n  276 S.C. 548, 551, 280 S.E.2d 805, 806 (1981). By waiving deficiency, a mortgagee \r\n  relinquishes only the right to pursue assets of the mortgagor over and above \r\n  those covered by the mortgage. Id. We find Fannie Mae's waiver of deficiency \r\n  would not have extinguished its right to the insurance proceeds resulting from \r\n  damage to the property prior to its sale. See 46A C.J.S. Insurance \r\n  Â§ 1403 (1993) (Where insurance is made payable to a mortgagee as his interest \r\n  may appear, the mortgagee has a superior right to the proceeds of the policy. \r\n  However, it may hold any residue over the amount of the mortgage debt for the \r\n  mortgagor.); 46 C.J.S. Insurance Â§ 1113 (1993) (A mortgagee is entitled \r\n  to the full amount of the insurance proceeds, where insurance is payable as \r\n  his interest may appear, if the unpaid amount of the mortgage is in excess of \r\n  the insurance proceeds.).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Conversion\r\n\r\n\r\nJones further asserts the master erred in granting Equicredit \r\n  summary judgment on his conversion claim because at the time of the fire loss, \r\n  he was the lawful and rightful owner of the fire insurance policy. We find no \r\n  error.\r\n\r\n\"Conversion is the unauthorized assumption and exercise \r\n  of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another. \r\n  . . . To establish the tort of conversion, it is essential that the plaintiff \r\n  establish either title to or right to the possession of the personal property.\" \r\n  Crane v. Citicorp Nat'l Servs., Inc., 313 S.C. 70,73, 437 S.E.2d 50, \r\n  52 (1993) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nThe policy expressly limited Jones's right to recover to \r\n  \"residual amounts of insurance over and above\" the Insured's \"insurable interest.\" \r\n  Most importantly, the insurance contract provides: \"Loss, if any, shall be adjusted \r\n  with and made payable to the Insured and/or the Borrower[ ] as their interests \r\n  may appear.\" At the time of the loss, Jones was indebted to Fannie Mae for more \r\n  than twice the amount of the insurance proceeds. As the agent for Fannie Mae, \r\n  Equicredit's interest in the insurance proceeds was unquestionably superior \r\n  to Jones's interest at the time the house was damaged. Accordingly, Equicredit \r\n  was the rightful recipient of the insurance proceeds. As Jones cannot establish \r\n  entitlement to the insurance proceeds, his action for conversion fails.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the grant of summary judgment \r\n  is\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n1.    Although \r\n  TIG is named as a party to the action and as a respondent in this appeal, the \r\n  company did not make a formal appearance in the action. \r\n2.    Equicredit \r\n  succeeded to the interest of OSCC in 1993 and thereafter became the servicing \r\n  agent for Fannie Mae. \r\n 3.    On June \r\n  3, 1997, the property was deeded to Equicredit. Equicredit asserts its name \r\n  on the deed was a scrivener's error, and on July 25, 1997, Equicredit deeded \r\n  the property to Fannie Mae. \r\n 4.    We note \r\n  that Equicredit's counsel indicated to this court at oral argument that the \r\n  proceeds it received were transmitted to Fannie Mae for application against \r\n  the mortgage balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3408","title":"Brown v.

Brown, III brought this action against John M. Stewart and J. David \r\n  Gibson (collectively, Appellants) alleging they made misrepresentations in securing \r\n  his investment in Mid-Atlantic Administrators, Inc. and managed the corporation \r\n  for their own benefit. Brown also sought an injunction to prevent the proposed \r\n  sale of Mid-Atlantic's assets. Appellants appeal from a jury verdict in favor \r\n  of Brown. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nMid-Atlantic was a South Carolina corporation formed in \r\n  1995 by Frank Altier (President), J. David Gibson (Vice President), John M. \r\n  Stewart (Secretary/Treasurer), and John Silvers, with each holding a 25% ownership \r\n  interest. The corporation operated as a third-party health insurance administrator \r\n  (TPA).\r\n\r\nIn April 1996, Brown purchased a 20% interest in Mid-Atlantic, \r\n  a total of seventy-five shares, for $100,000. Altier, Gibson, Stewart, and Silvers \r\n  each retained a 20% interest in the corporation.\r\n\r\nIn a Letter of Intent dated December 5, 1997, Carolina Benefit \r\n  Administrators, Inc. (CBA) offered to purchase the assets of Mid-Atlantic for \r\n  $1,000,000, of which $300,000 was to be paid as consulting fees to Gibson, Silvers \r\n  and Stewart, \"the three principal producers.\" In a subsequent Letter of Intent \r\n  dated January 12, 1998, CBA offered to purchase the assets of Mid-Atlantic for \r\n  $725,000 including the consulting fees of $300,000 to be paid to Gibson, Silvers, \r\n  and Stewart. The proposed sale was scheduled to take place on January 22, 1998. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the terms of the proposed sale, Brown concluded \r\n  Appellants had used his money to cash out their own investments and they were \r\n  receiving excessive consulting fees. Brown instituted this lawsuit in January \r\n  1998 to recover the full value of his shares plus a return on his investment, \r\n  alleging numerous misrepresentations had been made to him regarding Mid-Atlantic. \r\n  He further alleged he relied on the representations in deciding to make his \r\n  investment. Brown asserted claims for, among other things, fraud, negligent \r\n  misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty. He also sought a temporary \r\n  restraining order (TRO) to prevent the proposed sale of Mid-Atlantic's assets. \r\n  Appellants answered and counterclaimed for tortious interference with prospective \r\n  contractual relations and sought actual damages of at least $555,000, as well \r\n  as punitive damages. \r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1998, the trial court granted Brown's request \r\n  for a TRO until a hearing could be held. The order provided, among other things, \r\n  that Appellants were enjoined from individually collecting any funds for the \r\n  sale of Mid-Atlantic but that \"the corporation may collect the sales \r\n  proceeds and deposit them in its account to be later distributed in accordance \r\n  with orders of this court[.]\" [Emphasis added.] On February 13, 1998, the court, \r\n  with the consent of Appellants' counsel, continued the provisions of the TRO \r\n  until further order.\r\n\r\nAt trial in October 1999, the court granted Brown's motion \r\n  for a directed verdict on Appellants' counterclaim. The jury returned a verdict \r\n  for Brown jointly and severally against Appellants for $50,000 actual damages \r\n  on each of the three remaining causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  and breach of fiduciary duty.   \r\n  (1)  \r\n\r\nAppellants filed motions for (1) a JNOV or new trial, and \r\n  (2) election of remedies. The trial judge denied the motion for a JNOV or new \r\n  trial. By separate order, the court granted Appellants' motion for an election \r\n  of remedies, ruling Brown \"is entitled to recovery on the breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty verdict and either the fraud or the negligent misrepresentation verdict.\" \r\n  The court stated Brown \"must elect between remedies on the fraud and negligent \r\n  misrepresentation awards, choosing to recover $50,000 in damages on only one \r\n  of those verdicts. The court noted Brown's \"recovery of damages on the breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty verdict is unaffected by his election of remedies regarding \r\n  the other verdicts.\" This appeal followed. (2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n    (3) \r\n  \r\n\r\nI. Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation\r\n\r\nAppellants first contend the trial court erred in denying \r\n  their motions for a directed verdict, JNOV, or new trial on Brown's claims for \r\n  fraud and negligent misrepresentation. We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe trial court, in ruling on motions for directed verdict \r\n  and JNOV, is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motions and deny the motions where either the evidence yields more than one \r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt. Strange v. S.C. Dep't of Highways \r\n  &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994). \"The \r\n  trial court can only be reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to \r\n  support the ruling below.\" Id. at 430, 445 S.E.2d at 440.\r\n\r\n\"A motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable \r\n  jury could have reached the challenged verdict.\" Gastineau v. Murphy, \r\n  331 S.C. 565, 568, 503 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1998). If more than one inference can \r\n  be drawn from the evidence, the grant of a JNOV is improper and the case must \r\n  be left to the jury's determination. Id. \"The verdict will be upheld if there \r\n  is any evidence to sustain the factual findings implicit in the jury's verdict.\" \r\n  Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 515, 445 S.E.2d 651, 654 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\nA party asserting a claim for fraud in the inducement to \r\n  enter into a contract must establish \"(1) a representation, (2) its falsity, \r\n  (3) its materiality, (4)&nbsp;knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard \r\n  of its truth or falsity, (5) intent that the representation be acted upon, (6) \r\n  the hearer's ignorance of its falsity, (7)&nbsp;the hearer's reliance on its \r\n  truth, (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon, and (9)&nbsp;the hearer's consequent \r\n  and proximate injury.\" Parker v. Shecut, 340 S.C. 460, 482, 531 S.E.2d \r\n  546, 558 (Ct. App. 2000). As noted in Parker:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The failure to prove any one of these elements is fatal \r\n    to the claim. Generally, the representation must relate to a present or pre-existing \r\n    fact rather than a statement of future events or an unfulfilled promise. An \r\n    exception to the general rule is recognized for unfulfilled promises which \r\n    were made by a party who never intended to fulfill the promise and only made \r\n    it to induce the performance of another party.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted). \"Fraud is not presumed, \r\n  but must be shown by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\" Ardis v. Cox, \r\n  314 S.C. 512, 515, 431 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nA plaintiff in a negligent misrepresentation action, must \r\n  prove (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff, (2) the \r\n  defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the statement, (3) the defendant \r\n  owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information to the \r\n  plaintiff, (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care, \r\n  (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation, and (6) the plaintiff \r\n  suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance on the representation. \r\n  Hurst v. Sandy, 329 S.C. 471, 481, 494 S.E.2d 847, 852 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nThus, a key difference between fraud and negligent misrepresentation \r\n  is that fraud requires the conveyance of a known falsity, while negligent misrepresentation \r\n  is predicated upon transmission of a negligently made false statement. Gruber \r\n  v. Santee Frozen Foods, Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 20, 419 S.E.2d 795, 799 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992) (\"Recovery in negligent misrepresentation cases is based upon negligent \r\n  conduct and predicated upon a negligently made false statement where a party \r\n  suffers either injury or loss as a consequence of relying upon the misrepresentation. \r\n  It is not a fraud and deceit action; it is a negligence action . . . .\") (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nTo support his claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  Brown alleges the following misrepresentations were made to him to induce him \r\n  to invest $100,000 in Mid-Atlantic. First, Appellants told him that they (Gibson \r\n  and Stewart) along with Silvers had each \"invested\" approximately $25,000 in \r\n  the company and were given equal shares (25%) of the stock, and that Altier \r\n  was given an equal amount of stock (25%) as \"sweat equity\" based on his expertise \r\n  in running TPAs. However, Brown later discovered that Appellants had characterized \r\n  their funds as \"loans\" instead of stock equity, and they had used his investment \r\n  to repay the loans to themselves with interest of nearly 16%. Second, Appellants \r\n  falsely represented to him that his investment would be used for computers, \r\n  computer software, marketing, and additional personnel. However, as noted above, \r\n  Brown's invested capital went instead to pay back the \"loans\" from Appellants. \r\n  Third, appellant Gibson gave Brown a letter dated February 20, 1996 from Altier, \r\n  Mid-Atlantic's president, which made specific representations about the number \r\n  of employee lives and groups that were currently covered by Mid-Atlantic and \r\n  its plans for acquiring certain other groups. The letter also stated that Mid-Atlantic \r\n  was \"in the final stages of linking our computers and expect[ed] to be operational \r\n  by April 1, 1996.\" \r\n\r\nAs additional examples of Appellants' misrepresentations, \r\n  Brown testified that when he asked Gibson for additional financial information \r\n  after receiving the Altier letter, Gibson took Brown down the hall to see Stewart, \r\n  who gave him a balance sheet. According to Brown, Stewart told him Mid-Atlantic \r\n  was having cash flow problems, Appellants had invested as much as they could, \r\n  and Appellants needed additional capital to finance their growth. Brown testified \r\n  that he never would have invested $100,000 in the corporation if he had known \r\n  Appellants had no equity interest or investment in the corporation. Brown stated \r\n  he was never told Appellants had only made loans to the corporation and would \r\n  be using his investment to repay themselves instead of purchasing computers \r\n  and hiring additional staff as was represented to him. \r\n\r\nBrown asserted Appellants also told him \"they were [going \r\n  to] be in Mid-Atlantic for the long haul . . . and pay out some dividends to \r\n  . . . shareholders eventually.\" Brown testified that despite this representation, \r\n  he never received dividends from the corporation; rather, the corporation did \r\n  not show a profit and \"[e]verything [he] could determine [that] should be profits \r\n  were going into David Gibson, John Stewart's and John Silvers' pockets.\" Moreover, \r\n  Brown alleged Appellants abused their positions as officers and directors of \r\n  the corporation to orchestrate the sale of Mid-Atlantic's assets in a way that \r\n  was unduly favorable to themselves.\r\n\r\nAppellants argue they were entitled to a directed verdict, \r\n  JNOV, or new trial on both the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. \r\n  Appellants contend there was no misrepresentation in any of their statements. \r\n  They particularly assert that their statement alleging they had each \"invested\" \r\n  $25,000 in Mid-Atlantic was not misleading as \"invested\" can also mean \"loaned.\" \r\n  They further argue there was no evidence Brown ever relied on any of the alleged \r\n  misrepresentations. \r\n\r\nWe find the evidence presented by Brown created a question \r\n  of fact for the jury as to whether any of the alleged statements could be deemed \r\n  misleading. We note that, as to the meaning of \"invested,\" the evidence showed \r\n  Brown was told all of the other shareholders, except Silvers, had \"invested\" \r\n  approximately $25,000 in return for their stock, so a reasonable inference is \r\n  they maintained an equity interest in the corporation. As to the February 1996 \r\n  letter, Altier testified that at the time he wrote the letter, he was attempting \r\n  to describe the business and \"the fact that we were acquiring enough business \r\n  at such a fast pace that there was a need for additional capitalization of the \r\n  company so that we could basically lease more space, we could hire some more \r\n  personnel and all of the things that we needed including computers and so forth.\" \r\n  Further, Brown testified repeatedly as to his reliance, asserting he never would \r\n  have invested in Mid-Atlantic had he known Appellants had virtually no capital \r\n  investment in the corporation and that they were going to use his investment \r\n  to repay themselves instead of purchasing computers, computer software, marketing, \r\n  and additional personnel as had been represented to him at the time of his investment. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAppellants further argue Brown had no right to rely upon \r\n  the alleged misrepresentations and failed to exercise due diligence. They contend \r\n  the balance sheet given to Brown showed loans made to the corporation, and that \r\n  they did not have a confidential relationship with Brown to justify his reliance. \r\n  Appellants also argue \"Brown's cause of action for negligent misrepresentation \r\n  is barred because his losses were caused by his own negligence.\" They assert, \r\n  \"[t]he failure to exercise due diligence is as much a defense to negligent misrepresentation \r\n  as it is to fraud.\" \r\n\r\nWe find there is a jury question presented as to the legitimacy \r\n  of Brown's right of reliance in this case. Although Appellants apparently presented \r\n  one balance sheet to Brown which indicated some loans had been made to the corporation, \r\n  they simultaneously told him that they had each invested $25,000 in the corporation \r\n  and were seeking additional capital to finance their expansion. In addition, \r\n  when Altier was asked whether the money was a loan or capital investment, he \r\n  testified as follows: \"It was my understanding at the time that the money basically \r\n  would be capital into the company that would set up to get the company going \r\n  and it would be basically set up through stock issuance on an equal basis.\" \r\n  Altier asserted, \"It was not my understanding it was a loan[.]\" Altier conceded \r\n  that he did not believe Appellants or any of the other shareholders would be \r\n  entitled to take out any of the money contributed unless the corporation succeeded \r\n  and made a profit. \r\n\r\nBrown testified that he believed he had a right to rely \r\n  on Appellants as they controlled all of the information about Mid-Atlantic and \r\n  he could not obtain it from any other source. He stated Appellants \"were upstanding \r\n  citizens in the community and had been in the insurance business for a number \r\n  of years.\" Brown testified he had known Gibson casually \"for a number of years.\" \r\n  We find that Brown's right to rely was a matter to be resolved by the jury after \r\n  considering the conflicting evidence in this regard. See ML-Lee Acquisition \r\n  Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 240-41 nn.2 &amp; 3, \r\n  489 S.E.2d 470, 471 nn.2 &amp; 3 (1997) (adopting section 552 of the Restatement \r\n  (2d) of Torts (1977), which provides: \"One who, in the course of his business, \r\n  profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary \r\n  interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business \r\n  transaction, is subject to liability . . . .\").\r\n\r\nAppellants also contend there is insufficient evidence of \r\n  damages to support Brown's claims. Brown testified that he lost his initial \r\n  investment of $100,000 plus the amount of interest or gain he would have earned \r\n  on this money had the corporation operated properly. Brown stated if his money \r\n  had been placed in a savings account at 5% annually instead of Mid-Atlantic \r\n  it would have been worth $120,000. Moreover, he testified that if Appellants \r\n  had sold the assets and properly distributed the proceeds, he would have received \r\n  approximately $140,000. (4) Reviewing all of \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Brown, as we are required to do, \r\n  we find there is evidence to support the trial court's decision to deny Appellants' \r\n  motions. There was more than one reasonable inference arising from the evidence \r\n  as to whether Appellants either knowingly or negligently made false representations \r\n  to Brown to induce his investment in Mid-Atlantic. Further, the evaluation of \r\n  the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses were matters for the jury \r\n  to determine. See Doe v. Asbury, 281 S.C. 191, 194, 314 S.E.2d 849, 850 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (\"Judging the credibility of the testimony of witnesses is a \r\n  function of the jury, not the court, as is the weight to be given to such testimony.\").\r\n\r\nII. Breach of Fiduciary Duty \r\n\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in denying their \r\n  motions for directed verdict, JNOV, or new trial on Brown's claim for breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty. In their brief, Appellants initially argue there was no evidence \r\n  to support the claim for breach of fiduciary duty because Brown lacks standing \r\n  to seek damages for injuries allegedly suffered by Mid-Atlantic. We agree. \r\n   (5)\r\n\r\nIn his complaint, Brown alleged that Appellants \"owed plaintiff \r\n  [Brown] a fiduciary duty to operate the corporation in accordance with all applicable \r\n  laws and in a proper business manner and to act in good faith and with due regard \r\n  to [his] interest as a minority shareholder.\" [Emphasis added.] In addition \r\n  to the two grounds urged on appeal, Brown enumerated other acts of self-dealing \r\n  he alleged constituted a breach of fiduciary duty, stating \"the corporation \r\n  has been damaged and is entitled to judgment against the defendants for actual \r\n  damages suffered and for other such relief as the court deems just and proper.\" \r\n  [Emphasis added.] At the start of trial, the court granted Brown's oral motion \r\n  to amend his complaint to include the allegation that Appellants' failure to \r\n  go forward with the offer to purchase Mid-Atlantic's assets constituted a breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty and that he suffered individual damages separate from that \r\n  of the corporation. The trial court dismissed Brown's derivative claim on behalf \r\n  of the corporation for failure to assert damages suffered by the corporation.\r\n\r\nBrown did not appeal the dismissal of his derivative claim. \r\n  On appeal, Brown asserts two factors giving rise to his individual claim for \r\n  breach of fiduciary duty. First, he alleges Appellants participated in the structure \r\n  of the proposed sale agreement which directed a large portion of the proceeds \r\n  to Appellants in the form of consulting fees. Second, he alleges Appellants' \r\n  failure to consummate the transaction in accordance with the TRO resulted in \r\n  the ultimate loss of the entire proceeds to Brown. Appellants argue Brown's \r\n  assertion of damages essentially are limited to the reduction in the value of \r\n  his stock and nonpayment of dividends.\r\n\r\nBrown testified that the December 5, 1997 Letter of Intent \r\n  from CBA offered $1,000,000 to purchase \"the stock and assets of\" Mid-Atlantic, \r\n  of which $300,000 represented consulting fees payable to Appellants and Silver \r\n  as \"the three principal producers.\" A second letter dated December 30, 1997 \r\n  characterized the transaction as an asset purchase. On January 12, 1998, CBA \r\n  sent a Letter of Intent to purchase the assets for $425,000 plus $300,000 to \r\n  be paid in consulting fees to Appellants and Silvers. \r\n\r\nBrown testified that with the first offer on December 5, \r\n  1997, he would have received 20% of the $700,000, or $140,000. He stated he \r\n  was not happy about the large percentage of the proceeds going to pay consulting \r\n  fees, but he would have recouped his investment in the sale and made an additional \r\n  $40,000, and thus he was in favor of proceeding with the transaction. However, \r\n  by the time of the January 12, 1998 letter, Brown stated he voiced his displeasure \r\n  with the arrangement because he noticed that \"[t]he purchase price had been \r\n  reduced but the consulting fees had not.\" Brown stated he \"wanted to have fair \r\n  treatment for all five shareholders.\" Brown testified, \"I realize[d] that some \r\n  people had put some effort in but I had put a hundred thousand dollars in this \r\n  company and for somebody that had put what I later found out was seventy-five \r\n  dollars to come away with a hundred and forty thousand dollars and I put in \r\n  a hundred thousand and I was going to come away with maybe forty thousand just \r\n  didn't seem right to me.\" Brown stated he paid $100,000 essentially \"to finance \r\n  their operation and they are lining their pockets with special deals[.]\" \r\n\r\nBrown also alleged Appellants breached a fiduciary duty \r\n  by failing to consummate the purchase in accordance with the provisions of the \r\n  TRO, which called for any proceeds to be paid into the corporation's account, \r\n  not to the shareholders individually, to be later distributed according to the \r\n  court's order. \r\n\r\nWilliam Worthy testified that he initially spoke to Altier, \r\n  Mid-Atlantic's president, to inquire about purchasing the corporation's assets \r\n  for CBA. Worthy stated he met with Altier, Appellants, and Silvers to negotiate \r\n  a purchase price. Worthy said he was surprised to learn that Appellants had \r\n  already formed another TPA called Preferred Group Administrators (PGA). Brown \r\n  was apparently unaware of the new TPA and was not a participant. In their discussions, \r\n  Worthy stated that he was planning to pay 70% for the assets and 30% in consulting \r\n  fees for Mid-Atlantic, regardless of the total purchase price. Worthy testified, \r\n  however, that Appellants \"were more eager to sell Preferred Group Administrators \r\n  first because of some claims problems,\" so he acquiesced and purchased PGA instead \r\n  of Mid-Atlantic around February 1st and paid the proceeds directly to Appellants. \r\n  \r\n\r\nWorthy stated thereafter \"there were many negotiations\" \r\n  with Appellants regarding the offer to purchase Mid-Atlantic's assets. Worthy \r\n  stated that in the months after he purchased PGA, Mid-Atlantic's employees started \r\n  leaving when they heard of the impending sale, and they began having problems \r\n  with claims not being processed. Finally, in May 1998 his offer (based on the \r\n  expected revenue then) was for \"roughly three hundred fifty thousand dollars \r\n  and we were going to buy the balance of that revenue basically [using] sort \r\n  of the same formula and with an earn-out based on retention [of employee groups].\" \r\n  When he met with Appellants at closing, however, Worthy discovered that Appellants \r\n  had not told him that many of the groups he was purportedly purchasing had already \r\n  signed on with other companies. Worthy stated Appellants would have had to know \r\n  the groups were not coming to him because there was a sixty-day notice period \r\n  in the contracts used by Mid-Atlantic. Worthy stated he gave a check for $50,000 \r\n  to Silvers and/or Gibson, which they cashed within fifteen minutes, but he did \r\n  not receive all of the accounts he expected. \r\n\r\n\"The fiduciary obligation of dominant or controlling stockholders \r\n  or directors is ordinarily enforceable through a stockholder's derivative action \r\n  . . . .\" 19 Am. Jur. 2d Corporations Â§ 2268, at 166 (1986). An action \r\n  seeking to remedy a loss to the corporation is generally a derivative one. Hite \r\n  v. Thomas &amp; Howard Co., 305 S.C. 358, 361, 409 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1991) \r\n  (citations omitted), overruled on other grounds by Huntley v. Young, \r\n  319 S.C. 559, 560, 462 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1995). \"A shareholder may maintain an \r\n  individual action only if his loss is separate and distinct from that of the \r\n  corporation. A shareholder's suit is derivative if the gravamen of his complaint \r\n  is an injury to the corporation and not to the individual interest of the shareholder.\" \r\n  Id.; see also Todd v. Zaldo, 304 S.C. 275, 278, 403 S.E.2d 666, \r\n  668 (Ct. App. 1991) (\"If an individual stockholder has suffered a particular \r\n  loss due to mismanagement of a corporation then the stockholder may bring an \r\n  action for his loss since it is his personal asset. But, this loss must be personal \r\n  and not a loss of the corporation.\").\r\n\r\n\"If misconduct by the management of a corporation has caused \r\n  a particular loss to an individual stockholder, the liability for the mismanagement \r\n  is an asset of the individual stockholder. Of course, a suit based on the misconduct \r\n  can be brought by the individual stockholder.\" Ward v. Griffin, 295 S.C. \r\n  219, 221, 367 S.E.2d 703, 703-04 (Ct. App. 1988). \"It becomes material, therefore, \r\n  to inquire whether the acts of mismanagement charged to the directors affected \r\n  the plaintiffs directly, or as their interests were submerged in the \r\n  corporation whose assets were thus dissipated.\" Stewart v. Ficken, 151 \r\n  S.C. 424, 427, 149 S.E. 164, 165 (1929).\r\n\r\nAn individual action is also allowed if the alleged wrongdoers \r\n  owe a fiduciary relationship to the stockholder and full relief to the stockholder \r\n  cannot be had through a recovery by the corporation. 19 Am. Jur. 2d Corporations \r\n  Â§ 2268, at 167 (1986). In Babb v. Rothrock, our supreme court discussed \r\n  an exception to the general rule that individual stockholders may not sue corporate \r\n  directors for losses suffered by the corporation. 303 S.C. 462, 464-65, 401 \r\n  S.E.2d 418, 419-20 (1991) (discussing exception relied on by the defendants \r\n  found in Thomas v. Dickson, 301 S.E.2d 49 (Ga. 1983)). The exception \r\n  permits a stockholder to file an individual action for losses suffered by the \r\n  corporation if the underlying reasons for requiring a derivative action are \r\n  absent. Id. In Thomas, the Georgia Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The reasons underlying the general rule [that shareholders \r\n    must file derivative actions for losses suffered by the corporation] are that \r\n    1) it prevents a multiplicity of lawsuits by shareholders; 2) it protects \r\n    corporate creditors by putting the proceeds of the recovery back in the corporations; \r\n    3) it protects the interests of all shareholders by increasing the value of \r\n    their shares, instead of allowing a recovery by one shareholder to prejudice \r\n    the rights of others not a party to the suit; and 4) it adequately compensates \r\n    the injured shareholder by increasing the value of his shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n 301 S.E.2d at 51. Our court in Babb declined to \r\n  adopt the Thomas exception finding that even if it were adopted, the \r\n  parties in Babb could not maintain the action as an individual action \r\n  because at least one of the reasons for the general rule was not absent. Babb, \r\n  303 S.C. at 464-65, 401 S.E.2d at 419-20 (finding the claims of corporate creditors \r\n  would be jeopardized).\r\n\r\nIn this action, Brown alleged damages arising from the proposed \r\n  sale which would divert $300,000 of the sales proceeds as consulting fees from \r\n  the corporation to Stewart, Gibson, and Silvers. Brown further alleged damages \r\n  arising from Appellants' failure to consummate the transaction in accordance \r\n  with the TRO resulting in a greatly reduced sales price to the corporation. \r\n  We find Brown's assertions are limited to damage to the corporation. Thus, Brown \r\n  did not suffer individual damages, apart from the damage to the corporation. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Brown may not rely on the Thomas exception. \r\n  As a result of the damage to the corporation, Brown suffered a reduction in \r\n  the value of his stock. The damage to Brown as a stockholder, however, was shared \r\n  by all of the stockholders including Silvers and Altier, who were dismissed \r\n  from this action. Permitting Brown to maintain his action as an individual action \r\n  would not protect the interests of all stockholders because the diminution in \r\n  the value of the stock was suffered by all of the stockholders. Thus, the reasons \r\n  for requiring a derivative action described in Thomas were not absent. \r\n  Pursuant to Babb, where the reasons are not absent, we must rely on the \r\n  general rule that individuals may not sue corporate directors or officers for \r\n  losses suffered by the corporation. Babb, 303 S.C. at 464-65, 401 S.E.2d \r\n  at 419-20. Cf. Hite, 305 S.C. at 361-62, 409 S.E.2d at 342 (holding a \r\n  minority shareholder's causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and negligent \r\n  mismanagement did not have to be brought in a shareholder's derivative suit \r\n  because the alleged reduction in the minority shareholder's percentage of corporate \r\n  control was separate and distinct from any general diminution in value of corporate \r\n  stock).\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial court erred in denying Appellants' motion \r\n  for a directed verdict as to Brown's claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Accordingly, \r\n  the verdict on the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action is reversed. \r\n\r\nIII. Evidentiary Rulings\r\n\r\nAppellants next argue the trial court made numerous incorrect \r\n  rulings regarding their objections to the evidence and the questions propounded \r\n  by opposing counsel. They maintain the court's rulings constitute an abuse of \r\n  discretion entitling them to a new trial on all causes of action. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not be \r\n  disturbed on appeal.\" Gamble v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, \r\n  373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996). To warrant reversal, the appellant \"must show \r\n  both the error of the ruling and resulting prejudice.\" Recco Tape &amp; Label \r\n  Co. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1994).\r\n\r\nAppellants point to numerous instances in the transcript \r\n  where they contend testimony was improperly admitted because it was either irrelevant, \r\n  without proper foundation, dealt with matters of law, was hearsay, or was in \r\n  response to leading questions by opposing counsel. We have examined each of \r\n  Appellants' alleged errors in turn and find no error warranting reversal as \r\n  the court's rulings were either properly made or resulted in no prejudice to \r\n  Appellants.\r\n\r\nWe note that among these alleged errors is Appellants' assertion \r\n  that Brown's attorney improperly expressed his personal opinion about the credibility \r\n  of Appellants' testimony during closing argument. Appellants contend that after \r\n  they objected to the remark, the trial court failed to give the jury a curative \r\n  instruction. We find no error preserved for our review in this regard. The trial \r\n  court sustained Appellants' objection to the remarks, and Appellants did not \r\n  thereafter move to strike or ask for a curative instruction. See Wilder Corp. \r\n  v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic \r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been \r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\"); \r\n  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 18, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997) (holding \r\n  the alleged impropriety of closing argument was not preserved for review where \r\n  the trial court sustained an objection by opposing counsel, but counsel did \r\n  not move to strike or request a curative instruction). Accordingly, we hold \r\n  Appellants are not entitled to a new trial based on any of the trial court's \r\n  evidentiary rulings.\r\n\r\nIV. Jury Instructions\r\n\r\nThroughout their brief, Appellants argue numerous errors \r\n  allegedly committed by the trial court concerning the jury charge on Brown's \r\n  causes of actions. Appellants contend that each of the individual errors as \r\n  well as their cumulative effect entitle them to a reversal on all causes of \r\n  action. They further assert the trial court committed reversible error by violating \r\n  the provisions of Rule 51, SCRCP, by failing to adequately reveal the contents \r\n  of her contemplated jury charge prior to closing arguments. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIt is not error to refuse a request to charge when the substance \r\n  of the request is included in the general instructions. Varnadore v. Nationwide \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. 155, 160, 345 S.E.2d 711, 715 (1986). In reviewing \r\n  jury charges for error, we construe the court's charge as a whole in light of \r\n  the evidence and issues presented at trial. Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville \r\n  Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999). If the instructions \r\n  of the trial court, construed as a whole, correctly state the law, there is \r\n  no reversible error. Marks v. I. M. Pearlstine &amp; Sons, 203 S.C. 318, \r\n  330, 26 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1943). To entitle an appellant to reversal, the trial \r\n  court's instructions must be not only erroneous, but also prejudicial, and the \r\n  enumeration of hypercritical exceptions will not suffice to overthrow a jury's \r\n  verdict. Arkwright Mills v. Clearwater Mfg. Co., 217 S.C. 530, 553, 61 \r\n  S.E.2d 165, 175 (1950).\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed each of Appellants' allegations and find \r\n  no reversible error in the trial court's charge to the jury. We conclude the \r\n  court's instructions fairly set forth the applicable law in South Carolina. \r\n  The charge as a whole was reasonably free from error and we discern no prejudice \r\n  suffered by Appellants. We particularly note that, as to Appellants' arguments \r\n  that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on its proposed charges \r\n  Nos. 4, 7, 9B, and 12, we find no error as the requested instructions were either \r\n  unnecessary or already fairly covered in the trial court's general charge.\r\n\r\nTo the extent Appellants assert the trial court violated \r\n  Rule 51 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure because she failed to \r\n  properly advise counsel of the substance of her charge, we find this argument \r\n  unavailing. \r\n\r\nRule 51, SCRCP provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during \r\n    the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests \r\n    that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests. \r\n    The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior \r\n    to their arguments to the jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after \r\n    the arguments are completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Appellants contend that during the initial charging \r\n  conference, the trial court postponed her decision on their requests to charge \r\n  No. 2 (Breach of Fiduciary Duty -- Permitted Activities), No. 2A (Employing \r\n  Relatives), No.&nbsp;4A (Shareholder's Right to Inspection), and No. 12 (Plaintiff's \r\n  Negligence as a Defense), as well as its requests to charge the jury on nondisclosure \r\n  and conflict of interest transactions. (6) Appellants \r\n  state when court convened the next day, the trial court failed to advise them \r\n  of the substance of the instructions to be given. \r\n\r\nOur review of the record indicates that during the initial \r\n  conference, the trial court stated she was not inclined to charge the jury on \r\n  Appellants' requests to charge Nos. 2 &amp; 2A, but that if she did it would \r\n  be in another form. As to No. 4A, the court stated if she charged it, it would \r\n  be from the Code section. The court extensively discussed No. 12 with counsel, \r\n  stating she disagreed with counsel's characterization of the evidence and whether \r\n  the charge was appropriate, but that she would review it further. The trial \r\n  court stated she would \"charge nondisclosure as a representation, but not necessarily \r\n  in that form.\" When court convened the next day, Appellants' counsel asked the \r\n  trial court whether she was going to charge nondisclosure as fraud, and that \r\n  he had some proposed jury instructions if it was to be charged. The trial court \r\n  informed counsel that she was still completing work on the charge, but believed \r\n  she had sufficiently advised counsel of the proposed charge and had satisfied \r\n  the requirements of Rule 51. Appellants' counsel did not specifically request \r\n  a ruling on the other requests to charge that are now urged on appeal.\r\n\r\nWe find that, under the circumstances, the trial court adequately \r\n  apprised the parties of the substance of her intended charge, and we discern \r\n  no prejudice to Appellants in this regard. During the initial charging conference, \r\n  the trial court reviewed each of the proposed instructions seriatim and discussed \r\n  her thoughts as to each one. The court additionally advised the parties that \r\n  she planned to charge the jury on the elements of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  and breach of fiduciary duty; the definitions appropriate to the elements of \r\n  fraud; and that the burden of proof for fraud was clear and convincing evidence. \r\n  She advised the parties her standard charge included the burden of proof, evidence, \r\n  weighing the credibility of witnesses, and the use of a deposition or prior \r\n  inconsistent statement to impeach a witness. She also discussed the verdict \r\n  form to be used. Accordingly, we find no reversible error in either the court's \r\n  instructions to the jury or in the court's discussion of the charge with counsel \r\n  prior to closing arguments. \r\n\r\nV. Election of Remedies\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the trial court erred in permitting Brown \r\n  to retain a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty in addition to an election for \r\n  either fraud or negligent misrepresentation. In light of our reversal of the \r\n  trial court's denial of the motion for a directed verdict on the breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty cause of action, we decline to address this issue.\r\n\r\nVI. Appellants' Counterclaim  \r\n\r\nAppellants asserted a counterclaim against Brown for tortious \r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations. They alleged Brown \"filed \r\n  this lawsuit and obtained the injunction with the purpose and intent of causing \r\n  CBA's offer to be withdrawn.\" Appellants asserted that \"[a]s a proximate and \r\n  consequent result of [Brown's] interference,\" they lost the benefits of CBA's \r\n  offer. They sought actual damages of \"at least\" $555,000 as well as punitive \r\n  damages.\r\n\r\nThe elements of this cause of action are (1) intentional \r\n  interference with prospective contractual relations, (2) for an improper purpose \r\n  or by improper methods, and (3) resulting injury. Crandall Corp. v. Navistar \r\n  Int'l Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 266, 395 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1990). The \r\n  trial court granted Brown's motion for a directed verdict on the basis that \r\n  a party's exercise of a legal right does not constitute an improper motive or \r\n  an improper purpose. The court found Brown's institution of this lawsuit and \r\n  the securing of a TRO was an attempt to protect his rights as an investor and \r\n  shareholder and did not constitute an improper motive or an improper purpose.\r\n\r\nWe find no error as there is no evidence to suggest any \r\n  purpose or motive by Brown other than the pursuit of the protection of his rights \r\n  as a minority shareholder and investor in Mid-Atlantic. As to the TRO, we note \r\n  that Appellants consented to its continuance when given the opportunity to challenge \r\n  the initial TRO. In addition, the order provided that any party could move to \r\n  amend, modify, or vacate the TRO with ten days notice, and there is no indication \r\n  in the record that any such motion was thereafter made or denied by the trial \r\n  court. See, e.g., Webb v. Elrod, 308 S.C. 445, 448, 418 S.E.2d 559, 561 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1992) (\"The exercise in good faith of a legal right by a party to \r\n  a contract affords no basis for an action by the second party for intentional \r\n  interference with a contract even though the consequence of the exercise of \r\n  the legal right by the first party is to cause a third party not to perform \r\n  another contract with the second party.\"). Accordingly, we affirm the court's \r\n  grant of a directed verdict on Appellants' counterclaim.\r\n\r\nVII. Cumulative Error  \r\n\r\nAppellants finally maintain that the errors described above \r\n  require a new trial. Alternatively, they argue that if the individual errors \r\n  identified by Gibson and Stewart are insufficient to warrant a new trial, then \r\n  the cumulative effect of the many trial errors justifies reversal. In rebuttal, \r\n  Brown asserts that \"the number and sheer repetitiveness of [Appellants'] 64 \r\n  cited errors does not equate to a cumulative effect that worked to deny them \r\n  a fair trial and/or taint the jury's verdict in this case.\" \r\n\r\nWe note that Appellants previously filed a motion with this \r\n  Court for an enlargement of the time in which to serve and file their initial \r\n  brief and \"for permission to exceed the length limitation in their [brief] by \r\n  25 pages.\" This Court granted the motion for additional time and to exceed the \r\n  page limitation. Upon reviewing Appellants' brief, however, we agree with Brown's \r\n  observation that \"an appeal is not an open invitation for factual interpretation, \r\n  but rather a venue for review of real errors in legal judgment that can be deemed \r\n  to cause prejudice to a party to the extent that they rise to the level of reversible \r\n  error.\" Although we do not condone this exhaustive, shotgun approach to pursuing \r\n  an appeal, we have individually and collectively reviewed all of Appellants' \r\n  errors. See Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 536 (1986) (stating \"the process \r\n  of 'winnowing out weaker claims on appeal and focusing on' those more likely \r\n  to prevail, far from being evidence of incompetence, is the hallmark of effective \r\n  appellate advocacy.\") (quoting Jones v.

We reverse the trial court's \r\n  denial of a directed verdict on Brown's breach of fiduciary duty cause of action \r\n  and therefore set aside the jury verdict on that cause of action. Finally, we \r\n  affirm the trial court's granting of a directed verdict on Appellants' counterclaim.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J., concur.  \r\n1.    Silvers \r\n  and Altier were originally named as defendants but were dismissed prior to trial. \r\n  Mid-Atlantic was dismissed as a defendant at trial. \r\n2.    Brown \r\n  passed away during the pendency of this appeal and his wife, as personal representative \r\n  of his estate, has been substituted for him as a party for this appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.    Appellants \r\n  allege over sixty errors on appeal. We have consolidated the allegations where \r\n  possible. \r\n4.    This \r\n  represents Brown's share of the proceeds if Mid-Atlantic had been sold according \r\n  to the December 5, 1997 Letter of Intent. \r\n5.    Because \r\n  we agree with Appellants' argument that any damages arising from a breach of \r\n  fiduciary duty accrue to the corporation rather than to Brown individually, \r\n  we need not address Appellants' other issues in support of their argument that \r\n  the trial court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict on Brown's \r\n  breach of fiduciary duty claim. \r\n6.    In view \r\n  of our reversal of the trial court's denial of Appellants' motion for directed \r\n  verdict on the breach of fiduciary duty claim, the charges relating to that \r\n  cause of action are moot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3409","title":"Rorrer v.

Welsh, of Wheless &amp; McInnis, of North Myrtle \r\n          Beach, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        L. Sidney Connor, IV, of Kelaher, Connell &amp; Connor, \r\n          of Surfside Beach, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.: Robert \r\n  Rorrer brought this action pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated Section \r\n  32-1-20 (1) to recover the excessive gambling \r\n  losses sustained by his wife while playing video poker at a nightclub called \r\n  Jamaica Joe's. A jury awarded Rorrer $21,320, which the trial court trebled \r\n  in accordance with the statute. (2) On appeal, \r\n  Jamaica Joe's raises the following two arguments: (1) the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to grant its motions for a directed verdict and a judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict (JNOV); and (2) damages under section 32-1-20 are punitive in nature, \r\n  and the trial court erred in failing to apply a clear and convincing burden \r\n  of proof. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n Jamaica Joe's operated video poker machines in Myrtle Beach, \r\n  South Carolina in 1996 and 1997. Rorrer's wife played video poker at Jamaica \r\n  Joe's three or four nights per week from December 1996 through March 1997. At \r\n  trial, Rorrer introduced credit card receipts showing dates and amounts charged \r\n  by his wife at Jamaica Joe's and bank statements showing dates and amounts withdrawn. \r\n  According to Rorrer's wife, her net losses at Jamaica Joe's ranged from a low \r\n  at one sitting of $200 to a high of $8,600. Rorrer contends the combined net \r\n  loss was in excess of $100,000.\r\n\r\nRobbie Singleton, one of the owners of Jamaica Joe's, corroborated \r\n  some aspects of Rorrer's claim. Singleton confirmed Rorrer's wife lost money \r\n  while gambling at Jamaica Joe's on a regular basis from December 1996 until \r\n  March 1997 and that she used her American Express card to get cash for gambling. \r\n  \r\n\r\nJamaica Joe's moved for a directed verdict and, following \r\n  the verdict, for a JNOV, arguing Rorrer had failed to present evidence of his \r\n  wife's net losses. The trial court denied both motions.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, Jamaica Joe's asked the \r\n  trial court to charge the jury that Rorrer had the burden of proving his wife's \r\n  gambling losses by clear and convincing evidence, arguing damages recoverable \r\n  under section 32-1-20 are punitive in nature. The trial court declined to do \r\n  so, charging the preponderance of the evidence standard. The jury returned a \r\n  verdict for Rorrer, making specific findings as to the dates and amounts of \r\n  each loss. The award totaled $21,320, which the trial court trebled. Jamaica \r\n  Joe's appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Construction of Statute\r\n\r\nRorrer filed this action pursuant to section 32-1-20 which \r\n  is penal in nature. See Trumbo v. Finley, 18 S.C. 305 (1882). Recently, \r\n  while construing section 32-1-20, our supreme court reiterated the following \r\n  pertinent rules of statutory construction:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The principle is well established that penal statutes are \r\n    strictly construed, and one who seeks to recover a penalty for the failure \r\n    on the part of the defendant to discharge some duty imposed by law, must bring \r\n    his case clearly within the language and meaning of the statute awarding the \r\n    penalty. Such laws are to be expounded strictly against the offender and liberally \r\n    in his favor. And it is immaterial, for the purpose of the application of \r\n    the rule of strict construction whether the proceedings for the enforcement \r\n    of the penal law, be criminal or civil. \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Dep't of Revenue v. Collins Entm't Corp., 340 \r\n  S.C. 77, 79, 530 S.E.2d 635, 636 (2000) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\na. Burden of Proof  \r\n\r\n\r\nJamaica Joe's contends section 32-1-20 should be strictly \r\n  construed and Rorrer had the burden of bringing his claim clearly within the \r\n  language and meaning of the statute. Specifically, Jamaica Joe's contends throughout \r\n  its argument the trial court should have imposed a heightened burden of proof \r\n  upon Rorrer due to the penal nature of the statute. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe statutory scheme establishing a private right to recover \r\n  excessive gambling losses is found in sections 32-1-10 \r\n  (3) and 32-1-20. While our supreme court has determined that section \r\n  32-1-10 is remedial in nature, it has reaffirmed that section 32-1-20 is penal \r\n  in nature and must be strictly construed. See Francis v. Mauldin, 215 \r\n  S.C. 374, 381, 55 S.E.2d 337, 340 (1949). In first construing section 32-1-20, \r\n  our supreme court noted that \"[t]he object of the statute was manifestly to \r\n  punish excessive gaming.\" Trumbo, 18 S.C. at 310. Consequently, the statutory \r\n  scheme is part remedial and part penal. See Francis, 215 S.C. at 381, \r\n  55 S.E.2d at 340; see also Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 55, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  760, 763 (1993) (stating the legislature contemplated a policy which prevents \r\n  a gambler from allowing his vice to overcome his ability to pay).\r\n\r\nHowever, contrary to Jamaica Joe's argument, rules of statutory \r\n  construction do not increase the burden of proof. \r\n\r\n\r\n  The rule that penal statutes, as contradistinguished from \r\n    remedial statutes, must be construed strictly, is but a means of arriving \r\n    at the intention. When a law imposes a punishment which acts upon the offender \r\n    alone, and not as a reparation to the party injured, and when it is entirely \r\n    within the discretion of the lawgiver, it will not be presumed that he intended \r\n    it should be extended further than is expressed; and humanity would require \r\n    that it should be so limited in the construction as to be certain not to exceed \r\n    the intention.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaufman v. Carter, 67 S.C. 312, 320, 45 S.E. 211, \r\n  214-15 (1903) (quoting State v. Stephenson, 18 S.C.L. (2 Bail.) 156, \r\n  156 (1831)); see State v. Lewis, 141 S.C. 207, 139 S.E. 386 (1927).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our supreme court has declined to require an \r\n  increased burden of proof merely because a statute is penal in nature. See \r\n  Ford v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 169 S.C. 41, 168 S.E. 143 (1932). \r\n  (4) \r\n\r\nb. Jury Charge \r\n\r\nJamaica Joe's asserts that the trial court erred when it \r\n  instructed the jury Rorrer had the burden of proving each gambling loss by a \r\n  preponderance of the evidence because damages recoverable pursuant to section \r\n  32-1-20 are punitive in nature and the correct burden of proof is by clear and \r\n  convincing evidence. We disagree. \r\n\r\nSection 15-33-135 (5) states \r\n  that in a civil action where punitive damages are claimed, the burden of proof \r\n  is by clear and convincing evidence. Jamaica Joe's contends this statute is \r\n  applicable. In support of its proposition, Jamaica Joe's cites Adamson v. \r\n  Marianne Fabrics, Inc., 301 S.C. 204, 391 S.E.2d 249 (1990). In Adamson, \r\n  the verdict of the trial court included both punitive damages and statutorily \r\n  imposed multiple damages. On appeal, our supreme court reversed the award of \r\n  punitive damages, concluding that to allow both would impermissibly allow a \r\n  double recovery. Adamson, 301 S.C. at 208, 391 S.E.2d at 251. Jamaica \r\n  Joe's incorrectly construes this ruling to mean multiple damages are punitive \r\n  damages.\r\n\r\nWe look first to the wording of sections 32-1-10 and 32-1-20. \r\n  The following rule of statutory construction is firmly established in South \r\n  Carolina:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The primary rule of statutory construction requires that \r\n    legislative intent prevail if it can reasonably be discovered in language \r\n    used construed in light of intended purpose. The legislature's intent should \r\n    be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute. If a statute's \r\n    language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, \r\n    there is no need to employ rules of statutory interpretation, and the court \r\n    has no right to look for or impose another meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichland County Sch. Dist. Two v. S.C. Dep't of Educ., \r\n  335 S.C. 491, 496, 517 S.E.2d 444, 447 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, even though penal statutes are to be strictly \r\n  construed, \"the canons of construction certainly allow the court to consider \r\n  the statute as a whole and to interpret its words in the light of the context.\" \r\n  State v. Standard Oil Co. of N.J., 195 S.C. 267, 288, 10 S.E.2d 778, \r\n  788 (1940). We should consider not merely the language of the particular clause \r\n  being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose \r\n  of the whole statute and the policy of the law. See S.C. Coastal Council \r\n  v. S.C. State Ethics Comm'n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, 410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991).\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the plain meaning of the words used in \r\n  sections 32-1-10 and 32-1-20 that the measure of damages is the actual loss \r\n  sustained by the gambler at one sitting. \"Courts begin with the assumption that \r\n  compensatory damages compensate for those pecuniary losses which resulted from \r\n  the defendant's wrong.\" 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§ 28 (1988); see Bowers \r\n  v. Charleston &amp; W. Carolina Ry. Co., 210 S.C. 367, 378, 42 S.E.2d 705, \r\n  709 (1947) (Oxner, J., concurring) (\"Actual or compensatory damages are damages \r\n  in satisfaction of, or in recompense for, loss or injury sustained.\"); Johnson \r\n  v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 142 S.C. 125, 138, 140 S.E. 443, 447 (1927) \r\n  (stating that compensatory damages relate mainly to the injured party).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the treble damage award under section 32-1-20 \r\n  is not denominated by the legislature as punitive damages, and the statute does \r\n  not delineate a greater burden of proof. The legislature is presumed to have \r\n  fully understood the meaning of the words it used in a statute, and unless this \r\n  meaning is vague or indefinite, we presume that it intended to use them in their \r\n  ordinary and common meaning or in their well defined legal sense. See Powers \r\n  v. Fid. &amp; Deposit Co., 180 S.C. 501, 186 S.E. 523 (1936). \r\n  (6) As our supreme court recently stated in construing this same statute, \r\n  \"[a]lthough not a criminal statute, it would be equally improvident to judicially \r\n  engraft extra requirements to legislation which is clear on its face.\" Berkebile, \r\n  311 S.C. at 55-56, 426 S.E.2d at 763.\r\n\r\nEven though the damages allowed under section 32-1-20 may \r\n  not be compensatory because recovery is not allocated to the person who actually \r\n  suffered the loss, the measure of such damages is the actual pecuniary loss \r\n  suffered from the defendant's wrong. As our courts have recognized, generally \r\n  it is the spouse and family of the gambler who are thus protected. See Id. \r\n   at 55, 426 S.E.2d at 763 (\"The legislature adopted a policy to protect \r\n  a citizen and his family from the gambler's uncontrollable impulses.\").\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the statutory construction analysis, a \r\n  firmly established rule of law in South Carolina is that there can be no recovery \r\n  of punitive damages without a finding of actual damages. See Gamble v. Stevenson, \r\n  305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991). Section 32-1-20 mandates the automatic \r\n  addition of treble damages, without mandating a higher degree of culpability \r\n  through proof of wilful or intentional conduct. Therefore, requiring clear and \r\n  convincing proof would necessitate that the entire award be considered punitive \r\n  damages. If we were to agree with this argument, there would be no actual damage \r\n  award, and the verdict could not stand under the firmly established rule stated \r\n  above.\r\n\r\n   For all of the above reasons, we conclude section 32-1-20 provides a measure of actual damages\r\nequal to the actual loss sustained by the gambler at one sitting.  The burden of proof is by the\r\npreponderance of the evidence, and the trial court properly charged the jury.\r\n\r\nII. Directed Verdict/ JNOV\r\n\r\nJamaica Joe's contends the trial court erred in failing to grant its motions for a directed verdict and\r\na JNOV because Rorrer failed to prove damages.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe have concluded that the appropriate burden of proof is \r\n  by the preponderance of the evidence. Furthermore, the appropriate standard \r\n  of review by this Court is whether there is any evidence to support the verdict. \r\n  Collins v. Doe, 343 S.C. 119, 125, 539 S.E.2d 62, 64 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (finding that when considering a directed verdict motion, neither this Court \r\n  nor the trial court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve \r\n  conflicts in the testimony and evidence); see also Madden v. Cox, 284 \r\n  S.C. 574, 328 S.E.2d 108 (Ct. App. 1985) (concluding that where an appeal is \r\n  taken from a jury verdict on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, the \r\n  reviewing court must sustain the verdict if there is any evidence to support \r\n  the verdict).\r\n\r\nIn ruling on motions for a directed verdict and a JNOV, \r\n  the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motions and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields more than one \r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt. Creech v. S.C. Wildlife &amp; Marine \r\n  Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997). The trial court \r\n  can only be reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to support the \r\n  ruling below. Id.\r\n\r\nJamaica Joe's contends the testimony of Rorrer's wife regarding \r\n  her losses was insufficient because there was evidence she also won money on \r\n  many occasions and because Rorrer was unable to demonstrate that his wife's \r\n  losses directly resulted from gambling at Jamaica Joe's. However, Rorrer's wife \r\n  testified with specificity as to each loss she sustained at Jamaica Joe's, referring \r\n  to the credit card and bank records as corroboration. Each of these losses was \r\n  for amounts in excess of fifty dollars, and, according to her testimony, each \r\n  was a net loss at that particular sitting. These losses exceeded the amount \r\n  awarded by the jury. Furthermore, while she acknowledged that she had gambled \r\n  at two other establishments, she claimed she did not lose any money on those \r\n  rare occasions.\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Rorrer, \r\n  we conclude the testimony was sufficient to raise a factual issue which the \r\n  trial court properly submitted to the jury.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err in refusing to grant motions \r\n  for a directed verdict or a JNOV, and it properly instructed the jury that Rorrer \r\n  had the burden of proving his damages by the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  Therefore, the decision of the trial court is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  (7)\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J. and CURETON, J., concur.  \r\n1.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-1-20 (1991) (providing \r\n  that any person may recover the gambling losses of another only after the three \r\n  month period during which the gambler himself may seek recovery).  \r\n2.  Section 32-1-20 allows recovery of \r\n  the gambling losses and treble the value thereof.  \r\n3.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-1-10 (1991) (allowing \r\n  gambler who loses fifty dollars at any sitting to recover within three months). \r\n   \r\n4.  Imposing a higher degree of proof \r\n  in a civil action based upon a penal statute is not a novel concept. See \r\n  Gill v. Ruggles, 95 S.C. 90, 78 S.E. 536 (1913); Burckhalter v. Coward, \r\n  16 S.C. 435 (1882); Cf. Ford, 169 S.C. at 88-89, 168 S.E. at 160 (stating \r\n  that the \"only 'possible exception to the general civil rule that a plaintiff \r\n  is required to prove the allegations of the complaint by the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence, or the defendant his defense by a like degree of proof' is in \r\n  support of a plea of justification where the action is one based on slander \r\n  or libel in which a crime is therein charged against the plaintiff\") (quoting \r\n  Kirven v.

Indeed, the instances in which our legislature has \r\n  specifically allowed or disallowed punitive damages by name are too numerous \r\n  to mention. \r\n7.

We affirm. \r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1988, 67-year-old Clyde Myers, a resident of \r\n  Branchville, drove a truck loaded with drums containing 500 gallons of gasoline \r\n  through the doors of the Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement Complex (\"LEC\"), \r\n  flooded the floor with gasoline, ignited it, and then engaged in a twenty-minute \r\n  gun battle that wounded four officers. The LEC was nearly destroyed in the attack. \r\n  Myers had purchased a bulletproof vest, steel helmet, and gas mask in preparation \r\n  for the incident. (1) Charges against Myers were \r\n  nolle prossed in May 1989 when he was declared unable to assist in his own defense. \r\n  In July 1997, Myers, then 76-years-old, was re-indicted for the attack by the \r\n  Orangeburg County grand jury.\r\n\r\nThis litigation arises out of Sunbelt's publication of an \r\n  article in the August 3, 1997, edition of its newspaper, The Times and Democrat, \r\n  in which Sunbelt employees interviewed Myers and published his account of the \r\n  events that precipitated the attack and explanation for attempting to burn down \r\n  the LEC. (2) The publication coincided with the \r\n  re-indictment of Myers and was headlined on page 1A as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe headline on the jump page (at page 10A) proclaimed: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    Myers' hate aimed at one deputy but\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n    another deputy says he made arrest \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe article stated, \"For nine years, Clyde Burdell Myers, \r\n  76, has been mum about why it happened. On Thursday, he told his story to The \r\n  Times and Democrat.\" \r\n\r\nMyers' account of the events described a dispute in 1988 \r\n  with the Orangeburg County Council over a road adjoining his property and Myers' \r\n  belief that he had been treated improperly when arrested for malicious injury \r\n  to county property in connection with the road dispute. Myers stated his attack \r\n  on the LEC was in retaliation for this arrest, and that he was \"standing up \r\n  for [his] civil rights.\" The article declared: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Ironically, the one man Myers continues to \r\n    hate to this day for hurting him during that arrest isn't even the man who \r\n    arrested him. \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nAccording to Myers, when County Council did not respond \r\n  to a 10-day deadline he had imposed for a response to his inquiry about who \r\n  owned a local road, Myers proceeded on the morning of the 10th day to plow up \r\n  half the road adjacent to his property and place barricades on each end of the \r\n  road. Myers then drove to a local store to purchase \"No Trespassing\" signs. \r\n  Upon his return, he encountered two Orangeburg County sheriff's deputies on \r\n  the highway. Myers got out of his vehicle, took some tacks and a claw hammer, \r\n  and began placing the signs on the barricades. The article stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  He claims it was then-Deputy Marvin Boone who told him he \r\n    had an arrest warrant for him for damaging the county roadway. \r\n\r\n\r\nMyers asserted Boone placed the handcuffs too tightly on \r\n  his left wrist and repeatedly \"jerked down\" on the handcuffs, injuring his hand. \r\n  The article explained Myers' apparent mistaken identification of Boone as the \r\n  arresting officer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Arrest sparked hatred for wrong officer  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Claiming that the deputy \"treated me like a mad dog\" during \r\n    the arrest, Myers said he developed a hatred for the officer that set the \r\n    wheels of revenge in motion -- a hatred so intense that Myers admitted he \r\n    had even considered crashing a truck loaded with gasoline into Boone's home.\r\n\r\n  \"Marvin Boone was the main one. In my mind one time I had \r\n    sort of halfway planned [on] attacking his home in Rowesville, but I overruled \r\n    attacking his home and family and children, because I didn't know how many \r\n    children were in the neighborhood,\" Myers said. \"If I'd of run that sucker \r\n    up against that house and torched it like I did that complex, a lot of people \r\n    would have been hurt.\"\r\n\r\n  That revelation became even more chilling Friday when Boone, \r\n    the son of then-Sheriff Vance Boone who is now a lance corporal in the State \r\n    Transport Police, said he was not the officer who arrested Myers -- insisting \r\n    he doesn't remember ever meeting the [sic] Myers, much less arresting him.\r\n\r\n  The Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office backed up Boone's \r\n    assertion Friday, stating it was former deputy Johnny Haddock who, along with \r\n    Larry Williams, arrested Myers for damaging the county roadway.\r\n\r\n  \"Yeah. Larry and I arrested him for damaging county property,\" \r\n    Haddock said Saturday. \"He claimed we broke his wrist and later filed a civil \r\n    rights complaint with the FBI. FBI agent Bill Daniels came down to investigate \r\n    the complaint. After checking into it, Daniels cleared us of any wrongdoing. \r\n    He told me it appeared Myers made the complaint just out of spite.\"\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  [Haddock] said he never jerked down on the handcuffs as \r\n    Myers claimed.\r\n\r\n  \"Myers was 67 years old at the time. We didn't need to use \r\n    any force, especially having a fella Larry Williams' size there. He didn't \r\n    try to fight us during the arrest. He just stood there with that off-in-the-west \r\n    look,\" Haddock said.\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  \"I've always felt like when he came up there and burned \r\n    that complex he came looking for me and Larry,\" Haddock said.\r\n\r\n  Why Myers continues to insist it was Marvin Boone who arrested \r\n    him during the road incident is a mystery, Haddock said.\r\n\r\n  \"Marvin and I looked enough alike, I reckon. We were both \r\n    the same height and size and both of us had dark hair. I had a moustache and \r\n    Marvin didn't,\" he said. \"But Myers' bread ain't exactly done, either. That's \r\n    got a lot to do with it.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe article stated when Sunbelt's reporters confronted Myers \r\n  with evidence that Boone was not the arresting officer and asked if it were \r\n  possible he had confused Boone with Haddock all these years, Myers insisted \r\n  he knew without a doubt the arresting officer was Boone. Myers contended the \r\n  reason \"[his] arm was about tore off\" was because Boone was upset with him for \r\n  reporting to the FBI an illegal drug operation from which Myers said law officers \r\n  were profiting. Myers maintained he had reported to the FBI that a patrol car \r\n  regularly visited a nearby home and the deputy would \"exchange something\" with \r\n  the occupant, and he was suspicious. The article stated: \"Myers said he would \r\n  not identify by name the officer who was going to the residence, but he insinuated \r\n  Boone and others in the sheriff's office may have been involved.\" \r\n\r\nThe paper contacted Boone for his response to Myers' allegations \r\n  and duly reported that Boone found them \"groundless\":\r\n\r\n\r\n  Boone, saying he cannot talk further about Myers because \r\n    he may be called to testify if Myers is brought to trial, did say that such \r\n    an allegation about drugs is completely groundless. \"I never have done anything \r\n    like that and I never would.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the article noted: \"Adding a final ironic twist \r\n  to his story, Myers said the letter he had been waiting for from [the Orangeburg \r\n  County Attorney] informing him who owned Sub Road actually did arrive on the \r\n  10th day of the 10-day deadline he gave the county. The problem was it arrived \r\n  at 3 p.m. that afternoon, after he had plowed up the road.\" When asked if he \r\n  had any regrets about the incident, Myers said, \"No,\" and asserted, \"Ain't nobody \r\n  going to deny me of my civil rights. I'd die first â€¦ anytime, anywhere!\" The \r\n  article concluded with Myers' explanation that he \"just wanted the public to \r\n  know what happened.\"\r\n\r\nBoone brought this action for libel against Sunbelt in 1998, \r\n  alleging he was a public official and Sunbelt published the allegations concerning \r\n  the alleged use of excessive force and his purported illegal drug activity with \r\n  actual malice. Boone averred the statements were \"false, defamatory, and beyond \r\n  any qualified privilege.\" He sought both actual and punitive damages, claiming \r\n  the article injured his reputation and caused him severe physical and mental \r\n  suffering.\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted Sunbelt's motion for summary judgment, \r\n  ruling the article could not reasonably be read to make a false statement of \r\n  fact with a defamatory meaning of and concerning Boone. In the alternative, \r\n  the court concluded as a matter of law that, even if the statements were false, \r\n  they were privileged under the \"neutral reportage doctrine\" because they concerned \r\n  a matter of public interest. Boone appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Bayle v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., \r\n  344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. denied; Olson \r\n  v.

Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, \r\n  Licensing, and Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  Once the moving party meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary \r\n  support for the opponent's case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations \r\n  or denials contained in the pleadings; rather, the non-moving party must come \r\n  forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rule \r\n  56(e), SCRCP; Peterson v. West Am. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  608 (Ct. App. 1999). In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, \r\n  the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.

Absence of False Statement of \r\n  Fact and Defamatory Meaning\r\n\r\nBoone contends the trial court erred in granting summary \r\n  judgment to Sunbelt on the basis the article, when considered as a whole, did \r\n  not make false statements about him and was not defamatory as a matter of law. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The tort of defamation allows a plaintiff to recover for \r\n  injury to his or her reputation as the result of the defendant's communications \r\n  to others of a false message about the plaintiff.\" Swinton Creek Nursery \r\n  v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 484, 514 S.E.2d 126, 133 (1999) \r\n  (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nThe elements of a cause of action for defamation include: \r\n  (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning another, (2) an unprivileged \r\n  publication to a third party, (3) fault on the part of the publisher, and (4) \r\n  either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence \r\n  of special harm caused by the publication. Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, \r\n  Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (1998) (Holtzscheiter II) (Toal, \r\n  J., concurring), recited in Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 743 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n\r\n  In addition to being defamatory, the statement must be \r\n    false. Under the common law, a defamatory communication was presumed to be \r\n    false. However, truth could be asserted as an affirmative defense. The Supreme \r\n    Court's holding in Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. \r\n    767, 768-69, 106 S. Ct. 1558, 1559, 89 L. Ed. 2d 783, 787 (1986), modified \r\n    the common law rule: \"[A]t least where a newspaper publishes speech of public \r\n    concern, a private figure plaintiff cannot recover damages without also showing \r\n    that the statements at issue are false.\" Thus, an initial question that must \r\n    be answered is whether the speech is of public concern. If it is a matter \r\n    of public concern (at least where a media defendant is involved), the plaintiff \r\n    must also prove its falsity. If it is a matter of private concern, the plaintiff \r\n    does not have to prove falsity. \"The publisher may avoid liability if it successfully \r\n    proves the statement is true (i.e. the affirmative defense of truth is available \r\n    to the publisher in any type of case).\" Whether a communication is reasonably \r\n    capable of conveying a defamatory meaning is a question of law for the trial \r\n    court to determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFleming v.

Constitutional \r\n  actual malice required in defamation actions involving public officials is distinguishable \r\n  from common law malice, which refers to feelings of ill-will, spite, or desire \r\n  to injure. Sanders v.

Id. at 183-84, 493 S.E.2d at 347. \r\n\r\nIn the current appeal, the trial court found when the article \r\n  was considered in its entirety, \"it is clear as a matter of law that the article \r\n  does not have a defamatory meaning with respect to [Boone].\" The court observed: \r\n  \"Since the allegations by Myers against [Boone] hinged entirely on the accuracy \r\n  of Myers' identification of [Boone] as his arresting officer, and the article \r\n  refuted Myers' identification of [Boone], the article in its entirety rendered \r\n  innocuous the allegations by Myers against [Boone].\" The court concluded: \"The \r\n  only reasonable interpretation of the article complained of by the plaintiff \r\n  is that it does not state actual facts with respect to the plaintiff as the \r\n  person identified by Myers as his arresting officer or the person involved in \r\n  suspicious activity. Myers' identification of plaintiff was refuted throughout \r\n  the article.\" \r\n\r\n Boone argues the trial court erred in ruling this case \r\n  was distinguishable from Stevens v. Sun Publishing Company, 270 S.C. \r\n  65, 240 S.E.2d 812 (1978). Sun Publishing published two newspapers containing \r\n  allegedly libelous articles regarding the plaintiff, a state senator. The article \r\n  implied the plaintiff was being manipulated by his brother and incorrectly stated \r\n  he was being sued for abuse of political power. Sun Publishing appealed the \r\n  denial of its JNOV motion, asserting the articles were not defamatory, but the \r\n  Supreme Court affirmed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The Court found \r\n  the articles contained blatantly false statements and opinions by a biased informant \r\n  that implied improper conduct by a public official. \r\n\r\n Boone asserts that, as in Stevens, the informant \r\n  in this case, Myers, was clearly biased against him and the newspaper was aware \r\n  of the bias and yet reported blatantly false statements about him. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n\r\n The trial court stated \"Stevens is fully distinguishable \r\n  from the case at hand. In Stevens, the newspaper adopted as the basis \r\n  of its news story statements which it knew to be from a biased source. The paper \r\n  made no additional investigation of the potential falsity of the information \r\n  from the source, and the reporter acknowledged an animus against the plaintiff. \r\n  None of these factors have been shown to exist in this case.\" We agree with \r\n  the trial court's analysis in this regard and find Stevens does not afford \r\n  a basis for relief.   (4) \r\n  \r\n\r\n In presenting Myers' explanation of his actions some nine \r\n  years before, the article clearly stated in the text at the outset: \"Ironically, \r\n  the one man Myers continues to hate to this day for hurting him during that \r\n  arrest isn't even the man who arrested him.\" Further, the article's heading \r\n  on the article's jump page on page 10A stated: \"Myers' hate aimed at one deputy \r\n  but another deputy says he made arrest\"; a subheading in the text also proclaimed: \r\n  \"Arrest sparked hatred for wrong officer.\" See Ross v. Columbia Newspapers, \r\n  Inc., 266 S.C. 75, 81, 221 S.E.2d 770, 773 (1976) (\"As a general rule, both \r\n  the headline and the article following it must be considered as one document \r\n  in determining whether it is defamatory.\") (citations omitted). \r\n\r\n The article is a first-person account from a citizen who \r\n  took extreme steps to seek revenge against a law enforcement officer he believed \r\n  had mistreated him during an arrest. A review of the article reveals that Myers \r\n  was mistaken in his identification, thus casting doubt on his explanation of \r\n  the events. The article reported Boone's statement that he was not the arresting \r\n  officer; moreover, the newspaper identified the deputies who actually made the \r\n  arrest, Haddock and Williams, and included its interview with Haddock, who acknowledged \r\n  he was in fact one of the arresting officers. Contrary to the circumstances \r\n  in Stevens, Sunbelt's newspaper did not adopt the version of events propounded \r\n  by Myers. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the article included background information about Myers' treatment for emotional\r\nproblems, which further cast doubt on any identification of Boone.  For example, the article noted\r\nMyers had been treated at the South Carolina Department of Mental Health after this incident  and\r\nincluded Myers' description of his purported instructions upon discharge:  \"He [Myers] said a\r\ndoctor at the mental institution told him and his wife that 'I cannot come to Orangeburg County\r\nagain.  I can go anywhere else in the state or nation but not Orangeburg County.'\"  A photograph\r\nof Myers chained to a chair accompanied the article and the caption read:  \"Clyde Myers, now 76,\r\nhad a history of protest against county government.  In 1985, amid warnings that he would be\r\nejected from County Council meetings, Myers chained himself to a chair in council chambers.\"\r\n\r\n Thus, we agree with the trial court that, when considering \r\n  the article as a whole, it could not reasonably be interpreted as stating false \r\n  statements with a defamatory meaning of and concerning Boone. See, e.g., \r\n  Early v. Toledo Blade, 720 N.E.2d 107 (Ohio Ct. App. 1998) (stating the \r\n  trial court must read the statements at issue in the context of the entire article \r\n  to determine whether a reader would interpret them as defamatory and finding \r\n  a police officer plaintiff had failed to establish a newspaper article regarding \r\n  police brutality and misconduct was personally defamatory); cf. Sweeney v. \r\n  Sengstacke Enters., Inc., 536 N.E.2d 823, 826 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989) (holding \r\n  newspaper's article reporting that police officer had stated he and others planned \r\n  to kill the city mayor was not capable of an innocent construction so as to \r\n  be nonactionable, whether read alone or in the context of the entire article, \r\n  the court rejecting the defendants' assertion that the remainder of the article \r\n  gave it a different, innocent meaning, and finding \"[t]he entire focus of the \r\n  article is the threat by a police officer on the life of the mayor\" and noting \r\n  the headline announced \"policeman threatened mayor\"). Accordingly, we affirm \r\n  the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Sunbelt based on the court's \r\n  finding the newspaper article did not contain false statements with a defamatory \r\n  meaning of and concerning Boone. \r\n\r\nII.  Neutral Reportage Privilege\r\n\r\nBoone next challenges the trial court's alternative finding that the statements published by\r\nSunbelt, even if false, were not actionable because they were privileged.\r\n\r\n The trial court, citing Sunshine Sportswear &amp; Electronics, \r\n  Inc. v. WSOC Television, Inc., 738 F. Supp. 1499 (D.S.C. 1989), alternatively \r\n  found Sunbelt was insulated from liability under the \"neutral reportage doctrine.\" \r\n  The court explained: \r\n\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the protection for criticism of public officials as a protected practice in a\r\ndemocracy, the reporting of the criticism is also protected under the doctrine of \"neutral\r\nreportage.\"  This doctrine insulated from liability the reporting of defamatory statements made\r\nagainst public figures when the republication does not adopt, espouse or concur in the charges.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court further found that, \"rather than rely[ing] on this protection alone, [Sunbelt] went\r\nbeyond the reporting of the charges and exposed the misidentification of the plaintiff by Myers,\r\nand thereby established that [Boone] could not have been guilty of the misconduct alleged by\r\nMyers.\"\r\n\r\nBoone contends the trial court erred in finding the neutral reportage privilege and its exposure of\r\nMyers's misidentification insulated Sunbelt from liability.  Boone contends there is a factual issue\r\nregarding whether Sunbelt \"accurately and disinterestingly\" reported the statements Myers made\r\nagainst him.  Boone asserts: \"Viewing the article as a whole, a jury could find the manner in\r\nwhich the Defendant reported Myers' accusations against Plaintiff left a reasonable reader with\r\nthe impression that the story Myers told had some validity.\"\r\n\r\n The trial court's reliance on the neutral reportage privilege \r\n  assumes the challenged statements were false. It is a doctrine that provides \r\n  an exception to liability for what could otherwise be a defamatory statement. \r\n  Since we have affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Sunbelt \r\n  based on its finding the newspaper article did not contain false and defamatory \r\n  statements about the plaintiff, we need not reach this alternative ground in \r\n  support of summary judgment. See, e.g., Ross, 266 S.C. at 80, \r\n  221 S.E.2d at 772 (\"Since we agree with the trial judge's determination that \r\n  the [newspaper] articles were clearly not false or defamatory, we need not reach \r\n  the question of qualified privilege.\"); Fuller-Ahrens Partnership v. S.C. \r\n  Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. 177, 427 S.E.2d 920 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993) (holding where an appellate court affirms trial court's grant of \r\n  summary judgment on a particular ground, the appellate court need not discuss \r\n  the remaining grounds); Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d \r\n  289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"Where a decision is based on alternative grounds, \r\n  either of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision \r\n  will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.\") (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold that a cause of action for defamation fails when there is an absence of false statement and\r\ndefamatory meaning.  Based on the foregoing, the trial court's order granting summary judgment to Sunbelt is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.  \r\n1.   Myers \r\n  was also injured. He claimed his thumb was shot off so he \"couldn't hold the \r\n  gun no more,\" and his foot had to be amputated after it became infected from \r\n  his injuries. Myers was hospitalized and later spent time at the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Mental Health. Myers stated he was so medicated that he \"didn't \r\n  know nothing for about two or three years.\"  \r\n2.   It was \r\n  accompanied by another article, \"Grand jury revives case against Myers.\"  \r\n3.    The parties \r\n  agree that, in his capacity as a law enforcement officer, Boone is a public \r\n  official for purposes of this defamation action. See McClain v. Arnold, \r\n  275 S.C. 282, 270 S.E.2d 124 (1980) (joining the majority of jurisdictions in \r\n  holding that a police officer is a public official for defamation actions, thereby \r\n  requiring the plaintiff's proof of actual malice); see also Botchie v. O'Dowd, \r\n  315 S.C. 126, 432 S.E.2d 458 (1993) (applying actual malice standard to deputy \r\n  sheriff's defamation action); Gause v. Doe, 317 S.C. 39, 451 S.E.2d 408 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994) (public officials such as police officers must establish actual \r\n  malice). \r\n\r\n 4.  Further, in Stevens, the \r\n  Court focused on the issue of actual malice as the statements were shown to \r\n  be false. In the current appeal, because we find the disputed statements were \r\n  not false statements of fact susceptible of a defamatory meaning of and concerning \r\n  Boone, we need not address whether the statements were made with actual malice. \r\n  Cf. Botchie v. O'Dowd, 315 S.C. 126, 130, 432 S.E.2d 458, 460-61 (1993) \r\n  (stating \"[w]e need not determine the truthfulness of the statement as we find \r\n  in the record no evidence that it was made with malice\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3411","title":"Binkley v.

Burry (Binkley II) and the other present actions. \r\nRabon Creek further appeals, inter alia, the trial \r\n  court's ruling in the consolidated case that it was equitably estopped from \r\n  enforcing an easement against Respondents Robert and Susan Binkley, David and \r\n  Debbie Hearn, John and Janice LoPresti, Steven McConnell, Mitchell and Rebecca \r\n  King, and Arlin and Maxine Verley (referred to collectively as the Homeowners). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe secondary Appellant, John Burry, appeals the trial court's findings: 1) the easement extended\r\nto the top of the dam; 2) the Homeowners did not have notice of the easement; and 3) Rabon\r\nCreek may enforce the easement against  Burry but not against the Homeowners. We affirm in\r\npart and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1976 John Burry bought 172 acres of land \r\n  from the Gray family. Burry paid $650 an acre for the land known as tract 34. \r\n  Two months later three men representing the Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation \r\n  District asked Burry if he would sign an easement for the construction of a \r\n  dam and the impoundment of water to create Lake Beulah. Burry signed the agreement \r\n  in October 1976. Rabon Creek duly recorded the easement.\r\n\r\nAfter the dam was built, the resulting lake covered part of tract 34.  Burry subdivided the\r\nremaining property into lots and sold lakefront lots for approximately $20,000 an acre.\r\n\r\nThe Homeowners all purchased or constructed residences on lots  previously owned by Burry and\r\nwithin the easement claimed by Rabon Creek. (2) \r\n\r\nOn Friday, August 25, 1995, it began to rain.  Homeowner Steve McConnell awoke  around 4:00\r\na.m. to discover the LoPresti's home next door was flooding.\r\n\r\nThe water reached McConnell's home around 5:30 a.m. McConnell ultimately had five feet of\r\nwater on his first floor.  Like McConnell and the LoPrestis, the other Homeowners in this action\r\nall experienced flooding from this storm.\r\n\r\nAfter the flood, the Homeowners filed individual actions against parties including: John Burry,\r\nRabon Creek, land surveyors, and their respective closing attorneys. (3)\r\n\r\nIn June 1996 the Binkleys filed an action against Rabon \r\n  Creek alleging the easement did not give Rabon Creek the right to flood their \r\n  property and seeking, inter alia, declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent \r\n  Rabon Creek from flooding the property in the future.\r\n\r\nRabon Creek and the Binkleys moved for summary judgment on the interpretation of the\r\neasement.  In December 1996 Judge Kittredge granted summary judgment to Rabon Creek,\r\nfinding it held an easement extending to the top of the dam.  Judge Kittredge's order stated the\r\nparties consented to dismiss all remaining claims and defenses with prejudice and to waive the\r\nright to appeal the order.\r\n\r\nThe Binkleys subsequently filed Binkley II in which \r\n  they named John Burry, Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Guerard (Haynsworth Marion), \r\n  Donald Harper, Greenville County, and Fant Engineering &amp; Surveying as defendants. \r\n  Haynsworth Marion impled Rabon Creek as a third-party defendant. The court consolidated \r\n  Binkley II with the actions of the other Homeowners.\r\n\r\nIn August 1997 the Binkleys moved to set aside Judge Kittredge's \r\n  order in Binkley I pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5), SCRCP, arguing it was no \r\n  longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application and inconsistent \r\n  and inequitable results and consequences could occur if they were not granted \r\n  relief. Judge Kittredge denied the motion.\r\n\r\nIn December 1997 the Binkleys moved for reconsideration. \r\n  On October 2, 1998, Judge Kittredge granted the motion. He set aside the judgment \r\n  in Binkley I and consolidated Binkley I with Binkley II. \r\n  Rabon Creek appeals this order.\r\n\r\nIn the combined actions, Judge Kittredge granted summary judgment regarding the existence of an\r\neasement but denied summary judgment regarding the scope of the easement and the affirmative\r\ndefenses to its enforcement, including equitable estoppel.\r\n\r\nFollowing a non-jury trial solely on the extent and enforceability \r\n  of the easement, the trial court held: 1) the language of the easement was ambiguous, \r\n  but other evidence demonstrated the parties intended for the easement to extend \r\n  to the top of the dam; 2) the Homeowners did not have actual or constructive \r\n  knowledge that Rabon Creek claimed an easement to the top of the dam; and 3) \r\n  Rabon Creek was equitably estopped from enforcing the easement against the Homeowners. \r\n  The trial court found the Homeowners relied upon Rabon Creek's silence in purchasing \r\n  or constructing homes within the flood plain and Rabon Creek \"acted recklessly \r\n  in willfully failing to conduct the mandated inspections.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court, however, permitted Rabon Creek to enforce the easement against Burry finding\r\n\"[Burry's] testimony was not credible, and it conflicted with the credible evidence regarding the\r\npurpose of Lake Beulah in the overall project.\"  Rabon Creek and Burry appeal.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nRabon Creek contends the language of the recorded document creating the easement clearly and\r\nunambiguously extends the easement to the top of the dam.  Burry argues the easement only\r\nextended to a fifteen-foot buffer area around the lake and did not extend to the top of the dam.\r\n\r\n  The scope of an easement is an equitable matter in which \r\n  a reviewing court may take its own view of a preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  (4) The language of an easement determines its extent. \r\n  (5) \"Clear and unambiguous language in grants of easement must be \r\n  construed according to terms which parties have used, taken, and understood \r\n  in [the] plain, ordinary, and popular sense.\" (6) \r\n  We must first decide if the language used by the grant here is plain and unambiguous \r\n  and, if so, what does that language mean. \r\nWe agree with Rabon Creek.  The language in question is clear and unambiguous.  But does that\r\nlanguage extend the easement to the top of the dam as Rabon Creek claims?\r\n\r\nThe recorded document states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. John Burry . . . does hereby grant, bargain, sell, convey, and release unto the Rabon Creek\r\nWatershed Conservation District . . . an easement in, over, and upon the following described land .\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe approximate location of the area involved in the easement herein conveyed as Tract No. 34\r\nshown on a Sketch Map of Rabon Creek Watershed (Project) . . . which Sketch Map is, by\r\nreference, incorporated in and made a part of this instrument.\r\n\r\n  For or in connection with the construction, operation, \r\n    maintenance, and inspection of a floodwater retarding structure . . . for \r\n    the flowage of any waters in, over, upon, or through such structure; and for \r\n    the permanent storage and temporary detention, either or both, of any waters \r\n    that are impounded, stored, or detained by such structure. \r\n    (7) (Emphases added).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language of the easement clearly grants \"flowage rights\" to Rabon Creek.  \"Flowage rights\"\r\nhave been defined as \"the 'private right to operate a dam and flood [flow] the property of\r\nupstream waterfront landowners'\"  (8)  and the right to set \"water back against the up stream river\r\nbanks and over them to at least the level that the surface of the water is maintained at the dam.\" \r\n(9) \r\n\r\nThese flowage rights permit Rabon Creek to flow water \"in, over, upon, or through\" the dam. \r\nObviously, if water may flow \"over or upon\" the dam, the easement necessarily extends at least to\r\nthe top of the dam.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Sketch Map, incorporated by reference into \r\n  the easement, explicitly refers to the \"top of the dam elevation\" and includes \r\n  a contour line on the map corresponding to this elevation. Although water in \r\n  the lake is usually at an elevation of 700.5 feet, under the unambiguous language \r\n  of the flowage easement, Rabon Creek has the right to flood land surrounding \r\n  the lake up to the 724.5 foot contour line, i.e., the top of the dam. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Sketch Map contains a table listing the number of acres of Tract 34 affected by the\r\neasement.  The table states 56.7 acres of Tract 34 are within the contour line corresponding to the\r\ntop of dam elevation and thus encumbered by the easement.  The only possible reason to include\r\nthis information in the recorded document is to describe the extent of the easement.\r\n\r\nIndeed, easements for flowage are customarily described in terms of elevation, contour lines,\r\nand/or acreage.  (10)  The trial court thus erred in finding the language of the easement was vague\r\nand ambiguous.  Although, as Rabon Creek argues, it was unnecessary, and in fact improper, for\r\nthe trial court to take further evidence regarding the intent of the parties to the easement, the trial\r\ncourt correctly found the easement extended to the top of the dam. \r\n(11)  Given the clear and\r\nunambiguous language granting Rabon Creek flowage rights over the dam,  the easement without\r\ndoubt extends to the top of the dam.\r\n\r\nBurry's argument that the easement only extended to fifteen feet around the lake is not supported\r\nby the language of the easement itself.  Also, the trial court found Burry's testimony regarding the\r\nextent of the easement was not credible.  (12)  Our broad scope of review in equitable actions does\r\nnot require this court to disregard the trial court's credibility findings. \r\n(13) \r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nRabon Creek next argues the trial court erred in finding it was equitably estopped from enforcing\r\nthe easement against the Homeowners. Burry appeals the portion of the trial court's ruling finding\r\nRabon Creek is not estopped as to him.  (14)\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the recorded documents failed to provide notice to the Homeowners.  The\r\nissue of notice to the Homeowners of the scope of the easement lies at the very heart of this case. \r\nThe first element that a party seeking to assert equitable estoppel must prove is a lack of\r\nknowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth regarding the facts in question. \r\n(15)  If the\r\nHomeowners had actual or constructive notice of the easement, they may not equitably estop\r\nRabon Creek.  (16)\r\n\r\n  Rabon Creek contends the recording of the easement gave actual or constructive notice to the\r\nHomeowners requiring them to make inquiries about the scope of the easement.  Having already\r\ndetermined the language of the easement was clear and unambiguous, we agree.\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed the easement was properly recorded in each \r\n  Homeowner's chain of title. \"A grant of an easement is to be construed in accordance \r\n  with the rules applied to deeds and other written instruments.\" \r\n  (17) \"Notice of a deed is notice of its whole contents . . . and it \r\n  is also notice of whatever matters one would have learned by any inquiry which \r\n  the recitals of the instrument made it one's duty to pursue.\" \r\n  (18) Property owners are charged with constructive notice of instruments \r\n  recorded in their chain of title. (19) \"A properly \r\n  recorded title normally precludes an equitable estoppel against assertion of \r\n  that title due to the requirement that the party raising the estoppel be ignorant \r\n  of the true state of title or reasonable means of discovering it.\" \r\n  (20)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo afford notice of a provision in a recorded instrument, the language must be so intelligible and\r\nsignificant that it would naturally raise a well-grounded suspicion in the mind of a reasonably\r\nprudent person, or a person of ordinary diligence and understanding, sufficient to suggest an\r\ninquiry that would lead to a knowledge of the facts.  (21)\r\n\r\n\r\nA description of an easement in a recorded document is sufficient when it contains language that\r\nacts as a guide to the location of the easement on the land such that the easement is \"capable of\r\nbeing rendered to a certainty [by reference] to something extrinsic . . . to which it refer[s].\" \r\n(22)  As\r\ndiscussed above, the Sketch Map included the elevation of the dam, a map showing the\r\napproximate location of a contour line corresponding to the elevation of the dam, and an acreage\r\ntable listing the number of acres affected by the easement.\r\n\r\n  A surveyor armed with this information could have located the easement on a homeowner's\r\nproperty.  \"It is not essential to the validity of a grant of an easement that it be described by metes\r\nand bounds or by figures giving definite dimensions of the easement.\" \r\n(23)  This is particularly true\r\nof flowage easements.\r\n\r\nThe facts of this case do not justify a finding of equitable estoppel. The description in the\r\neasement was sufficient to place the Homeowners at the very least on constructive notice of its\r\nextent.  We conclude, therefore, that the Homeowners failed to meet the first element of equitable\r\nestoppel - lack of knowledge of the extent of the easement and of the means by which to obtain \r\nknowledge.  \"One with knowledge of the truth or the means by which with reasonable diligence\r\nhe could acquire knowledge cannot claim to have been mis[led].\" \r\n(24)\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nThe Homeowners argue also that Rabon Creek's silence during the construction of their homes\r\namounted to a misrepresentation.  The Homeowners contend contracts between Rabon Creek, the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, Greenville County Soil and Conservation District, and\r\nLaurens County Water and Soil Conservation District for periodic inspections of the dam\r\nestablished a duty on the part of Rabon Creek to inform the Homeowners that they were building\r\nhomes within the flood plain.  (25)  The trial court agreed.\r\n\r\nIn support of their argument, the Homeowners cite Southern \r\n  Development Land and Golf Company v. South Carolina Public Service Authority \r\n  for the proposition that \"[s]ilence, when it is intended, or when it has the \r\n  effect of misleading a party, may operate as equitable estoppel.\" \r\n  (26) Their reliance on  Southern, however, is misplaced. Southern \r\n  did not address estoppel asserted by a party with actual or constructive notice \r\n  from a properly recorded instrument. Our supreme court addressed that situation \r\n  in South Carolina State Highway Department v. Metts. \r\n  (27)\r\n\r\nIn Metts, landowners claimed the Highway Department's \r\n  failure to object and inform them that a service station island and gas pumps \r\n  lay within the Highway Department's easement estopped the Department from asserting \r\n  any right to the easement.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court disagreed, finding the Department properly \r\n  recorded the easement and the landowners were charged with constructive knowledge \r\n  of its existence. The court noted there was no \"action [by the Department] tending \r\n  to misrepresent the actual state of facts to appellants or evidencing an intent \r\n  to abandon a portion of [the easement].\" (28) \r\n  The court also stated \"[t]he record conclusively shows that appellants had ample \r\n  opportunity to ascertain what, if any, right of way had been conveyed over the \r\n  property for highway purposes.\" (29) \r\n\r\n\r\nThis holding is in accord with the rule that silence after \r\n  properly recording an instrument is not usually conduct justifying the imposition \r\n  of equitable estoppel. \"As a 'general rule . . . mere silence or acquiescence \r\n  will not operate to work an estoppel where the other party has constructive \r\n  notice of public records which disclose the true facts.'\" \r\n  (30) \"Because of the doctrine of constructive notice, there is little \r\n  duty, outside the avoidance of affirmative misleading acts, which is \r\n  imposed upon the holder of an interest in property, where his or her interest \r\n  in the land is disclosed by the public records.\" (31) \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, there is no evidence Rabon Creek committed \r\n  any affirmative or misleading act or concealed the true scope of the easement. \r\n  In contrast to the facts in Southern, none of the Homeowners contacted \r\n  Rabon Creek to inquire about the scope of the easement or received assurances \r\n  that the homes in question were not in the flood plain. \r\n  (32) Although reliance is also an element of equitable estoppel, the \r\n  record contains no evidence that the Homeowners relied on Rabon Creek's contracts \r\n  to inspect the dam in deciding to purchase or construct homes or that the contracts \r\n  somehow induced the Homeowners to do so. (33) \r\n  Not a single Homeowner testified he or she even knew of Rabon Creek's contracts. \r\n  At oral argument, counsel for the Homeowners conceded none of the Homeowners \r\n  knew of the contracts when they purchased lakefront property.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  Rabon Creek's silence did not discourage the Homeowners from conducting a title\r\nsearch to locate the easement or from hiring a surveyor to determine where the easement fell on\r\neach property. \"When a landowner has actual or constructive notice of a matter, and does not\r\nshow any misrepresentation or concealment by the government, estoppel will not lie against the\r\ngovernment.\"  (34) \r\n\r\nAlthough it is regrettable that the Homeowners suffered property damage because their homes\r\nwere located within a flood easement, the trial court erred in finding Rabon Creek was equitably\r\nestopped from enforcing the easement against the Homeowners. \r\n(35)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nTo summarize,  we reverse the trial court's findings that the recorded easement was ambiguous\r\nand Rabon Creek was equitably estopped from enforcing the easement against the Homeowners. \r\nWe affirm the trial court's findings that the easement extends to the top of the dam and that Rabon\r\nCreek may enforce the easement against Burry.\r\n\r\nBecause we reverse the trial court's findings regarding \r\n  equitable estoppel, it is unnecessary for us to further address Rabon Creek's \r\n  argument that the court decided issues of negligence not properly before it, \r\n  and we make no findings as to whether Rabon Creek breached contracts with the \r\n  United States Department of Agriculture and others. (36) \r\n  It is also unnecessary for us to review the propriety of the grant of the Rule \r\n  60(b) motion in Binkley I. (37)\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation \r\n  District is a governmental subdivision pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 48-11-10(1) \r\n  (Supp. 2000). \r\n2.  Not all Homeowners purchased directly \r\n  from Burry. \r\n\r\nThe Binkleys purchased three lots in 1991 and constructed \r\n  a lakefront home. The Hearns also built a lakefront home. The LoPrestis purchased \r\n  an already-completed lakefront residence in 1994. The McConnells purchased a \r\n  lakefront lot in 1992 and constructed a residence. They moved into their home \r\n  in January 1995.\r\n\r\nThe Kings and the Verleys purchased lots and constructed \r\n  residences. Mitchell King's father, an attorney, performed a title check for \r\n  his son and discovered the easement but concluded it only burdened the edge \r\n  of his son's property. \r\n3.  John and Janice LoPresti filed an \r\n  action against Rabon Creek and others in February 1996. Steven McConnell filed \r\n  an action in December 1995. The Hearns filed an action in December 1996. The \r\n  Kings and the Verleys filed an action in August 1997. \r\n 4.  Tupper v. Dorchester County, \r\n  326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997) (citations omitted); Eldridge \r\n  v.

Ramaker, 542 S.E.2d \r\n  392, 394 (Va. 2001). \r\n11. Nonetheless, this evidence also \r\n  supports the conclusion the easement extends to the top of the dam. Numerous \r\n  witnesses, such as Lesley Morgan of the South Carolina Department of Natural \r\n  Resources, Bill Earle, retired Soil Conservation District Manager for the Greenville \r\n  County Soil and Water Conservation District, and Albert McAlister, an attorney \r\n  for the Laurens County Water Resources Commission, testified the easement extended \r\n  to the top of the dam.\r\n\r\nNRCS employee Grady Adkins testified the Watershed Work \r\n  Plan for the construction of the dam stated: \"[e]asements will be obtained to \r\n  the top of dam elevation at sites 20 and 21 and will include 715 acres.\" \r\n12. In 1984 Burry challenged the extent \r\n  of the area from which the NRCS could remove soil from his property for use \r\n  in the construction of the dam. Burry then argued the NRCS could not remove \r\n  any soil above the 724.5 foot contour line. There was testimony that Dr. Burry \r\n  premised this argument on the idea the easement extended to 724.5 feet and no \r\n  further. \r\n13. See Pinckney v. Warren, 344 \r\n  S.C. 382, 544 S.E.2d 620 (2001). \r\n 14. In the alternative, Burry argues \r\n  the Homeowners had notice of the easement. \r\n15. Southern Dev. Land and Golf Co. \r\n  v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., 311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1993). \r\n  The remaining elements are a reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped \r\n  and a prejudicial change in position. The elements of equitable estoppel with \r\n  respect to the party estopped are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) conduct which amounts to a false representation or \r\n    concealment of material facts, or at least, which is calculated to convey \r\n    the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those \r\n    which the party subsequently attempts to assert;\r\n\r\n  2) intention, or at least expectation, that such conduct \r\n    shall be acted upon by the other party;\r\n\r\n  3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. \r\n16.  We note that because Rabon Creek \r\n  is a governmental entity, it is even more difficult for the Homeowners to demonstrate \r\n  they are entitled to an equitable estoppel against it than it would be against \r\n  a non-governmental party. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  As a general rule, estoppel does not lie against the government \r\n    to prevent the due exercise of its police power or to thwart the application \r\n    of public policy. The acts of government agents acting within the scope of \r\n    their authority can give rise to estoppel against the government, but unauthorized \r\n    conduct or statements do not give rise to estoppel. \r\n\r\n\r\nTown of Sullivans Island v.

Prior to purchasing property for \r\n  development, Southern contacted Santee Cooper and received assurances that no \r\n  exposed power lines would be on the property. This information was incorrect \r\n  as Santee Cooper had already finalized plans to construct overhead high voltage, \r\n  transmission towers and lines on the property. Significantly, these plans were \r\n  not matters of public record. Southern filed suit claiming it relied on Santee \r\n  Cooper's assurances in deciding to purchase the property. \r\n33.

(\"Contractor\") were found 20% and 80% liable, respectively, for the diminution in value of a building\r\nowned and subsequently sold by Commerce Center of Greenville, Inc. (\"Commerce Center\").  Contractor filed post-trial\r\nmotions challenging various evidentiary rulings.  These motions were denied.  Contractor appeals.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn April 1997, Commerce Center acquired by assignment all of the partnership interests of Park Place Associates\r\n(\"Associates\").  Associates' interests included a five-story building known as the Park Place located in West Columbia.  At\r\nthe time of this transaction, Associates had two separate actions pending against Architect (1) and Contractor (2)\r\nfor recovery\r\nof damages for certain defects in the design and construction of Park Place. Specifically, Associates complained that the\r\nwindows on all but the first floor of the building leaked.\r\nIt was undisputed that an improperly constructed joint will \r\n  fail prematurely and start leaking. The parties also agreed the windows leaked \r\n  because of defective design and the poor workmanship of Contractor's window \r\n  installation subcontractor. Contractor, however, maintained that the design \r\n  defects, not Contractor's construction defects, were the greater \r\n  cause of Commerce Center's damages.\r\n\r\nThe windows were sealed with a \"conventional caulk joint.\"  A conventional caulk joint is an industry term which\r\ndescribes a standard method of construction and type of seal used around windows.  When a window is placed in its\r\nrespective opening, it is positioned and held in place with plastic, horseshoe-shaped shims so that a space or gap of not less\r\nthan one-quarter of an inch and not more than three-quarters of an inch is left between the cladding material, which is the\r\nmaterial on the building's exterior, and the top edge or the bottom edge of the window system.\r\nNext, a foam material\r\ncalled backer rod is inserted into the gap.  A sealant-like caulk is then pressed into the gap on top of the backer rod.  The\r\nbacker rod limits the depth of the sealant joint (which is the in-and-out dimension of the joint) and allows the caulk to be\r\npressed into its proper one-to-one ratio of depth to width. A proper ratio ensures a water-tight and lasting joint.\r\n\r\nApproximately two weeks after acquiring the building, Commerce Center sold Park Place to Liberty Property Limited\r\nPartnership (&quot;LPLP&quot;).  Commerce Center continued the actions initiated by Associates.\r\nIn its pleadings, Commerce Center\r\nalleged that it was required to discount the sale price by $175,000 because of the building's defects. (3)\r\n\r\nAt trial, Commerce Center elicited testimony that Contractor did not install the windows properly in that almost no backer\r\nrod was used, the joint spacing was inconsistent and frequently of improper width and depth, the fiberglass mesh under the\r\ncladding system was exposed in parts, and the shims were the improper size, misplaced, and often protruding into the\r\ncaulking compound.  Contractor acknowledged that essentially no backer rod was used on the building.\r\nL.G. Lewis, Jr., an\r\nexpert called by Commerce Center, testified that the design of the windows did not deviate from accepted architectural\r\npractice and it would have performed \"satisfactory\" if properly executed.\r\n\r\nOn cross examination, Robert T. Coleman, III, Commerce Center's president, acknowledged that in 1996, Commerce\r\nCenter believed a cause of the leaks, but not the exclusive cause, was a design defect.  He also admitted that Commerce\r\nCenter would have performed repairs to the building to change the design configuration of the window head even if backer\r\nrod had been installed by Contractor.\r\n\r\nCommerce Center additionally proffered testimony of necessary remedial remedies to correct the window leaks.  Simply\r\nadding new caulk would not act as a permanent fix to the leaking problem. Instead, the better, long-term solution was to\r\ninstall flashing across the top of the windows. Mark F. Williams, an expert retained by Commerce Center to design a\r\nsolution for the leaks, testified about a remedial flashing design he devised.  Williams testified his solution did not modify\r\nthe window design; rather, it involved cutting an approximate eight-inch portion of the cladding away from above the\r\nwindows and installing a metal flashing or drip edge around the entire building.\r\nThis solution was considered the most\r\ncost-effective because it did not involve removing, repositioning, and reinstalling every window in the building.\r\nLewis\r\nopined Williams' remedial solution was \"reasonable.\" Although Commerce Center did not implement these design\r\nchanges, LPLP did.  There is no indication in the record that the building has leaked since renovation.\r\n\r\nAs part of its pre-trial discovery, in December 1997, Contractor submitted five questions to Associates in a Rule 36,\r\nSCRCP request to admit.  Commerce Center, answering as assignee of Associates' interests, admitted the construction\r\ndefects complained of consisted of only the omission of backer rod and improper joint size at the window head. (4)  However, Commerce Center specifically reserved its right \"to supplement this\r\nresponse to the extent further deficiencies are discovered.\"  Commerce Center further admitted it had turned down\r\nContractor's offer to pay for recaulking the building and that it would have performed repairs to the building and changed\r\nthe design configuration of the window head even if backer rod had been present. (5)\r\n\r\nContractor argued the substance of Commerce Center's admissions to the jury.\r\nIt used a blow-up of admission number\r\nfour as demonstrative evidence during its opening arguments and it published in part and argued the substance of the\r\nremaining admissions, particularly admission number two, during cross examination of Lewis.  Additionally, Contractor\r\nreferenced the admissions during its closing argument.\r\n\r\nContractor sought on at least three occasions to introduce the admissions into evidence.  At the close of Commerce\r\nCenter's case, Contractor also moved for a directed verdict based upon admission number two because the admission did\r\nnot acknowledge any construction deficiencies other than the lack of backer rod and improper joint spacing.\r\nThe court\r\ndenied Contractor's motion. Concurrently, however, the trial judge granted Commerce Center's oral motion to amend its\r\nadmissions to comport with the additional testimony of construction defects involving the shims.\r\nOver Contractor's\r\nobjections, the trial judge found no prejudice in allowing this amendment.\r\n\r\nContractor also attempted to introduce two letters sent from Commerce Center's attorney to Contractor and Architect dated\r\nJune 25 and July 25, 1996, respectively, into evidence.  The trial judge did not admit either letter, finding both documents\r\nrelated to settlement negotiations. The first letter explained Commerce Center had discovered the cause of the water leaks:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal problem relates to the configuration of the window heads, particularly at the curved wall and the placement\r\nof the sealing joint flush with the exterior surface â€¦. It is apparent, therefore, that in order to produce a water tight building\r\nthat will allow sealant joints to last the industry period of time, that the window heads need to be reconfigured.\r\n\r\nThe second letter reiterated Commerce Center's initial findings:\r\n\r\nThe revision of the window head detail is necessary to ensure the long term water tightness of the building.  Periodic\r\ncaulking is not going to be sufficient to maintain the integrity of the exterior skin of the building.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of Commerce Center for the entire $175,000 requested for its breach of warranty and\r\nbreach of contract claims.  The jury found Architect liable in the amount of $35,000 (20% at fault) and Contractor liable in\r\nthe amount of $140,000 (80% at fault).  Contractor filed post-trial motions for directed verdict, JNOV, reconsideration, and\r\nnew trial. The trial court denied these motions.  Contractor appeals.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nContractor states in its brief that \"[t]he overriding question in this appeal is whether the trial court's exclusion of evidence,\r\nallowance of an amendment to a request to admit, and refusal to charge the jury on requests to admit deprived Contractor of\r\na fair trial on the question of causation and apportionment of damages as between Contractor and Architect.\"  Essentially,\r\nContractor argues the trial court's alleged improper evidentiary restrictions in this document-intensive case caused the jury\r\nto reach an improper allocation of fault between Contractor and Architect.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nI.  Requests to Admit\r\n\r\nA.  Judicial Treatment of Admissions Made Pursuant\r\nto Rule 36, SCRCP \r\n\r\nA party may serve upon any other party a written request \r\n  for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of \r\n  any matters within the general rules of discovery that relate to statements \r\n  or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness \r\n  of any documents described in the request. Rule 36(a), SCRCP. The efficacy of \r\n  these admissions is akin to the doctrine of judicial estoppel: \r\n  (6) an admission precludes the admitting party from arguing facts \r\n  at trial contrary to its responses to a request to admit, absent an amendment \r\n  to or revocation of the admission as allowed under the rules. See Rule 36(b), \r\n  SCRCP (\"Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless \r\n  the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.\"); cf. \r\n  Adams v. Orr, 260 S.C. 92, 194 S.E.2d 232, (1973) (affirming trial judge's \r\n  refusal to hold that plaintiff's lack of responses to several of defendant's \r\n  requests to admit were admitted as binding fact because the requests to admit, \r\n  as worded, were ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation).\r\n\r\nAdmissions under Rule 36 are treated as admissions in pleadings. \r\n  Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  430 (Ct. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. \r\n  v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000); see also \r\n  James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 304 (1996) (\"Admissions \r\n  are similar to pleadings.\"); Pulte Home Corp. v. Woodland Nursery &amp; Landscapes, \r\n  Inc., 496 S.E.2d 546, 548 (Ga. App. 1998) (\"In form and substance [a response \r\n  to a request to admit] is comparable to an admission in pleadings or stipulation \r\n  of facts and as such is generally regarded as a judicial admission rather than \r\n  evidentiary admission of a party.\").\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's Rule 36 is substantively similar to the \r\n  federal rule. However, Rule 43, unlike its federal counterpart, specifically \r\n  states that \"pleadings shall not be submitted to the jury for its deliberations.\" \r\n  Rule 43(g), SCRCP. Thus, in our state, requests to admit are not submitted to \r\n  the jury; rather, the proper course of action is to publish the admissions to \r\n  the jury. Id.  (\"Counsel for a party may read his pleadings to the jury \r\n  or make a statement to the jury of the facts alleged in the pleadings and the \r\n  theory of his case.\") cf. Tuomey Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. McIntosh, 315 S.C. \r\n  189, 191, 432 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1985) (\"Rule 36 SCRCP allows amendment of an \r\n  admission in the discretion of the court when 'the merits of the action will \r\n  be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admissions fails to satisfy \r\n  the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him....' Once an answer \r\n  to a Request for Admissions is amended under Rule 36, both the initial answer \r\n  and the amended answer may be published to the jury. The jury may consider the \r\n  initial answers as evidence, while the party who made such answers 'is free \r\n  to explain why it was made and [amended].'\").\r\n\r\nHere, Contractor did not request to publish Commerce Center's admissions to the jury.  Instead, it sought to enter the\r\nadmissions into evidence. (7)  Despite the absence of a request to publish, the trial judge allowed Contractor to argue the\r\nadmissions to the jury.  Contractor capitalized on this ruling by arguing the substance of the admissions to the jury and\r\npresenting the answer to admission number four during both its opening and closing arguments.\r\nWe find no error.\r\n\r\nB.  Jury Charge\r\n\r\nContractor argues the trial judge denied its alternative request that the jury be instructed that the responses to the requests to\r\nadmit were conclusive facts in the case.  We find no merit in this contention.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a party is entitled to a jury charge regarding \r\n  requests to admit which were published to the jury. See McIntosh, 315 \r\n  S.C. at 192, 432 S.E.2d at 487 (holding trial court's general charge concerning \r\n  requests for admissions was a correct statement of law). Here, Contractor argued \r\n  at trial that \"either I can introduce [the requests to admit] as an exhibit \r\n  or you can tell the jury that it's like a fact.\" Contractor, however, did not \r\n  expand on this statement. The record does not contain the full charge to the \r\n  jury nor does it show that the trial judge refused to present any requested \r\n  charges to the jury. In fact, there is no indication in the record that the \r\n  jury was charged with an incorrect expression of the law. See State v. Buckner, \r\n  341 S.C. 241, 534 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. denied (holding jury \r\n  charge is proper if, as a whole, it is free from error and reflects the current \r\n  and correct law of South Carolina). Since the record does not contain any proposed \r\n  jury charges and since the record does not reflect that Contractor proffered \r\n  any proposed charges for the jury, this issue is not preserved. See Wells \r\n  v. Halyard, 341 S.C. 234, 533 S.E.2d 341 (Ct. App. 2000) (upholding jury \r\n  charge given by trial judge where record was devoid of appellant's request for \r\n  a particular charge or the language of the proposed charge that appellant contended \r\n  judge refused to give); see also McIntosh, 315 S.C. at 192, 432 S.E.2d \r\n  at 487 (\"The court gave a general charge concerning requests for admissions, \r\n  which was a correct statement of law. If [defendant] wanted a further charge \r\n  as to the effect of the amended answers, it was incumbent upon it to specifically \r\n  proffer such a charge. However, [defendant] failed to proffer an additional \r\n  charge, either at trial or on appeal.\") (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nC.  Amendment of Requests to Admit\r\n\r\nFinally, Contractor argues the trial judge erred in allowing Commerce Center to amend its answers to the requests to admit. \r\nThat is, Contractor argues Commerce Center should be estopped from asserting any breaches other than the two defects\r\nasserted in admission number two which acknowledges \"only\" the backer rod and caulking were defective.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe trial court may allow a party to amend or withdraw its \r\n  answers to a request to admit when: (1) the presentation of the merits is furthered \r\n  by the amendment; and (2) the party who obtained the admission cannot demonstrate \r\n  prejudice because of the amendment. Rule 36(b), SCRCP, cited in Barber v. \r\n  Hobbs, 313 S.C. 319, 437 S.E.2d 409 (Ct. App. 1993). Prior to the oral amendment \r\n  of Commerce Center's admissions, Commerce Center proffered testimony, without \r\n  objection, that the shims were both the wrong size and were improperly positioned. \r\n  Williams testified that he observed shims that protruded into the sealant. Bob \r\n  Broom, assistant vice-president and project manager for Architect, and Lewis \r\n  both averred that the shims used by Contractor were too long. Moreover, the \r\n  testimony at the trial was detailed, specific, and voluminous as to the proper \r\n  method for installing the windows. Clearly the positioning of the windows with \r\n  the shims affects the spacing of the joints. The window installation required \r\n  more than just caulk and backer rod. In fact, the windows, backer rod, shims, \r\n  and sealant are used in conjunction to install the windows. The amendment of \r\n  Commerce Center's admissions did nothing more than conform the admissions to \r\n  the consistent testimony offered at trial.\r\n\r\nNor was Contractor prejudiced by this amendment.  The use of shims is clearly part and parcel with the installation of the\r\nwindows.  Michael S. McMillon, project superintendent for Contractor, agreed that the backer rod's absence and protruding\r\nshims would be clear errors in construction which would likely contribute to the sealant joints' failure.  Moreover,\r\nContractor admits it received an inspection report in 1994 prepared by its own expert, George W. McGee, who was hired\r\nby Contractor to investigate the window leaks.  Jack W. Long, a senior vice-president of Contractor, stated Contractor had\r\nunderstood since at least 1994 that its workmanship was at issue as a cause of leaks.\r\nGiven Commerce Center's reservation\r\nto amend its answer and because Contractor was on notice before the action against it was initiated that the quality of its\r\nwork was called into question, we find no prejudice in the trial judge's ruling.\r\n\r\nContractor cites Sunvillas Homeowners Association v. \r\n  Square D Company, 301 S.C. 330, 391 S.E.2d 868 (Ct. App. 1990), for the \r\n  proposition that any amendment to the requests to admit was invalid without \r\n  Contractor's consent. This case is clearly distinguishable because it involves \r\n  an attempt to add a new theory of recovery to the complaint after plaintiff \r\n  rested his case. In the case sub judice, Commerce Center has maintained \r\n  throughout the proceedings that the various construction defects by Contractor \r\n  contributed to the leaks. Commerce Center did not allege a new cause of action \r\n  nor did it present an unforseen argument late in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nII.  Admissibility of Commerce Center's June 25 and\r\nJuly 26, 1996, Letters \r\n\r\nThe courts favor compromise; accordingly, evidence relating \r\n  to settlements is generally not admissible to prove liability. Rule 408, SCRE; \r\n  Hunter v. Hyder, 236 S.C. 378, 114 S.E.2d 493 (1960); Hall v. Palmetto \r\n  Enterprises II, Inc., of Clinton, 282 S.C. 87, 317 S.E.2d 140 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984) (holding that an offer to compromise is generally not admissible \r\n  as an admission).\r\n\r\nThe June 25, 1996, letter from Commerce Center's counsel to Contractor and Architect concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to schedule a meeting with everyone involved as soon as possible â€¦ so that we can discuss this proposed\r\nrepair and determine how it should be implemented between [Architect] and [Contractor].\r\n\r\nLikewise, the July 25, 1996, letter reiterated the request to negotiate:\r\n\r\nI suggested a meeting in my prior letter to discuss this problem and see if a resolution can be reached â€¦. I would be most\r\nappreciative if you would check your calendars and find a mutually agreeable day that is suitable to meet in Columbia to\r\ndiscuss this repair and resolution without the necessity of continued litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese letters reference an attempt to schedule a meeting to resolve the case.  Thus, on their face, these letters present an\r\nattempt to curb further litigation.  Clearly, the verbiage of the letters relates to actual settlement negotiations or, at the least,\r\nto a settlement relationship between the parties.  Simply because the letters were sent by Commerce Center's predecessor in\r\ninterest does not remove the essential tone for settlement from the letters.\r\n\r\nEven assuming, arguendo, that redacted versions of the letters \r\n  should have been admitted by the trial judge, we find no prejudice. It is well \r\n  settled that the admission and rejection of testimony are matters largely within \r\n  the trial court's sound discretion, the exercise of which will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Pike v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000); see also R &amp; G Constr., \r\n  Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 540 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000), cert. granted (holding the court's ruling to admit or exclude \r\n  evidence will only be reversed if it constituted an abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law). In order for this Court to reverse a case based on the \r\n  erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence, prejudice must be shown. Hanahan \r\n  v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe purported admissions in the letters are merely cumulative \r\n  of the testimony at trial. Generally, there is no abuse of discretion where \r\n  the excluded testimony is merely cumulative of other evidence proffered to the \r\n  jury. See Ott v. Pitman, 320 S.C. 72, 79, 463 S.E.2d 101, 105 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995) (upholding trial judge's decision to exclude particular witness testimony, \r\n  which the Court of Appeals characterized \"cumulative to that of other witnesses\"). \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error. Here, Williams, Lewis and McGee all testified \r\n  that merely recaulking the joints would not be enough. Instead, they declared \r\n  that the window head design required some revisions or reworking. Williams and \r\n  McGee further opined that the poor design and workmanship mandated some form \r\n  of revision of the window heads. Lewis opined that the construction defects \r\n  alone required a revision. Thus, the jury heard ample evidence that the window \r\n  heads had to be reconfigured to solve the leaking problem. Moreover, although \r\n  the trial judge did not allow the letters into evidence, he allowed Contractor \r\n  to use them to refresh the memories of Commerce Center's witnesses. We find \r\n  no abuse of discretion and no prejudice arising from denying the admission of \r\n  these letters into evidence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial judge is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.  \r\n1.   The complaint \r\n  for Associates vs. Architect was filed July 25, 1994.  \r\n2.   The complaint \r\n  for Associates vs. Contractor was filed December 10, 1996. Contractor subsequently \r\n  initiated a third party complaint against its window installation subcontractor. \r\n  This third party defendant was not a party to the litigation brought by Associates \r\n  nor is it a party to this appeal. \r\n\r\n Commerce Center, as the assignee of Associates' interests, \r\n  later moved to consolidate Associates' two actions. On February \r\n  5, 1998, Commerce Center's motion was granted. \r\n\r\n3.  Commerce Center entered into its \r\n  contract to sell Park Place to LPLP on March 5, 1997. On its schedules, the \r\n  property was valued at $3,992,000. Upon notice of the construction defects, \r\n  because LPLP did not want to buy a leaking building, subsequent negotiations \r\n  reduced the selling price by $175,000. \r\n4.    Request \r\n  to admit numbers one and two read, in part:\r\n\r\n1. Admit that Park Place Associates contends that the Problem is a design defect which Park Place Associates contends is\r\nthe responsibility of [Architect].\r\nANSWER:\r\nThis Request is admitted in part.  Commerce Center [as assignee of all of the partnership interest of Park Place Associates]\r\ncontends that the problem is in part caused by a design defect.  Commerce Center contends that construction defects,\r\nconsisting of omission of a backer rod and improper joint size at the window head to accommodate sealant and backer rod\r\ncontributed to the leaking problems.\r\n\r\n2. Admit that the only contention of a breach of contract by the Park Place Associates' agent, [Contractor], is the alleged\r\nfailure by [Contractor] to install a backer rod and caulk joints between the windows and the building skin.\r\n\r\nANSWER:\r\n\r\nCommerce Center admits request number 2 to the extent that it [sic] a breach of contract occurred by omission of backer\r\nrod, and failure to create joint width for the installation of a backer rod and sealant.  This was the responsibility of\r\n[Contractor] pursuant to its contract. [Commerce Center] reserves the right to supplement this response to the extent further\r\ndeficiencies are discovered.\r\n5.   Request to admit number four reads, in part:\r\n\r\n4. Admit that even if [Contractor] had recaulked the building using the appropriate backer rod, the redesign and repairs\r\nbeing performed by Park Place Associates to correct the problem would have still been necessary.\r\n\r\nANSWER:\r\n\r\n[Commerce Center] admits that it would have performed repairs to the building to change the design configuration of the\r\nwindow head even if backer rod had been present.\r\n6.  Judicial estoppel precludes a party \r\n  from adopting a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same litigation. \r\n  The doctrine's function is to protect the integrity of the judicial process \r\n  or the integrity of the courts rather than to protect litigants from allegedly \r\n  improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries. The doctrine generally applies \r\n  only to inconsistent statements of fact. Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, \r\n  327 S.C. 242, 489 S.E.2d 472 (1997) (adopting the doctrine of judicial estoppel \r\n  as it relates to matters of fact in South Carolina); Quinn v. The Sharon \r\n  Corporation, 343 S.C. 411, 416, 540 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 2000) (Anderson, \r\n  J., concurring) (\"A court must be able to rely on the statements made by the \r\n  parties because truth is the bedrock of justice. Therefore, a litigant cannot \r\n  'blow both hot and cold.' Under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, a party that \r\n  has assumed a particular position in a judicial proceeding, via its pleadings, \r\n  statements, or contentions made under oath, is prohibited from adopting an inconsistent \r\n  posture in subsequent proceedings.\") (citations omitted). \r\n7.   Contractor reiterates this desire in its brief wherein its states: \"When Contractor sought to introduce the Requests to\r\nAdmit into evidence .â€¦\" and \"Contractor renewed its request to introduce these matters into evidence â€¦.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
