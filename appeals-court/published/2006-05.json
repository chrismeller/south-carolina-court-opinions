Greene, of Charleston, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n        Stanford E. Lacy and Suzanne C. Boulware, both of Columbia, for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.: We are presented with cross-appeals from a workersâ€™ compensation claim filed by Samuel Clint Thompson against his employer, South Carolina Steel Erectors and its insurance carrier, American Interstate Insurance (collectively referred to as American Interstate).[1]Â  Thompson was paralyzed in a work-related accident and awarded benefits.Â  Thompson sought a partial lump sum payment from his lifetime benefits to construct a house, as well as additional payments for exercise equipment and modifications to this house necessitated by his injuries.Â  The modifications would make the proposed home habitable for a paraplegic.Â  The single commissioner awarded Thompson relief on all counts.Â  An appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Commission) affirmed the award of the partial lump sum payment and the funds for exercise equipment but denied the payment for the modifications.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Commission.Â  Both parties appeal.Â  We affirm the Commission to the extent it awarded Thompson relief, and we reverse the Commissionâ€™s denial of Thompsonâ€™s request for funds to modify the house to accommodate his paraplegia. \r\nFACTS\r\nThompson worked as a welder with Steel Erectors.Â  While Thompson was hanging a 3000 pound beam, its rigging broke.Â  The beam hit Thompson, knocking him to the concrete floor 30 feet below.Â  Thompson suffered a spinal cord injury resulting in paraplegia.Â  Steel Erectors admitted liability for the accident and American Interstate began paying weekly benefits of $507.34, as well as $1,000 per month to Thompsonâ€™s wife to aid with his care.Â  \r\nThompson is married with two children, ages five and six.Â  At the time of the accident, the Thompson family rented a home from Thompsonâ€™s uncle for $200.00 per month, well below the monthly market rate of approximately $600.00.Â  American Interstate paid approximately $35,000 for modifications to the rental home to accommodate Thompsonâ€™s special needs. \r\nThompson filed a claim with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission for total general disability with lifetime benefits based upon his paraplegia pursuant to section 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  He also requested a partial lump sum payment from his lifetime benefits for the construction of a new home for the family.Â  Thompson sought additional money to upfit the new home to render it habitable for a paraplegic.Â  \r\nAmerican Interstate admitted the facts of Thompsonâ€™s injury and his disability, but opposed the requests for a partial lump sum payment and other funds.Â  As the hearing commenced, American Interstate stipulated to Thompsonâ€™s entitlement to lifetime benefits under section 42-9-10.Â  \r\n The single commissioner awarded Thompson lifetime benefits of $507.34 per week.Â  The commissioner also ordered American Interstate to pay $150,300 as a lump sum for the new home, to be deducted from the â€œback endâ€ of Thompsonâ€™s future benefits.Â  The commissioner found he was empowered to make an award of a partial lump sum pursuant to Glover v. Suitt Construction Company, 318 S.C. 465, 458 S.E.2d 535 (1995), and Cox v. BellSouth Telecommunications, 356 S.C. 468, 589 S.E.2d 766 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, (Apr. 7, 2005).Â  Next, the commissioner awarded Thompson $83,700.00 for upfitting the new home to accommodate his special needs.Â  Finally, the commissioner ordered American Interstate to provide therapeutic and exercise equipment prescribed by Thompsonâ€™s neurologist.[2]Â  \r\nThe Commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s partial lump sum payment award, and also found that the amount should be deducted â€œfrom the â€˜back endâ€™ of Claimantâ€™s lifetime monetary benefits.â€Â  Specifically, the Commission found the award: (1) was in the best interest of Thompson and his family; (2) represented approximately 13% of his future benefits given his life expectancy according to the South Carolina mortality tables; (3) did not constitute a hardship to American Interstate; and (4) was a reasonable amount. The Commission also affirmed the award requiring American Interstate to provide the equipment as prescribed. \r\nThe Commission, however, reversed the single commissionerâ€™s award of $83,700 for modifications.Â  The Commission found that because American Interstate previously spent $35,000 to upfit Thompsonâ€™s rented residence, â€œ[u]p-fitting a new residence would be duplication and an abuse of discretion on the part of this Commission.â€Â  \r\nThe circuit court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s order.Â  On appeal, Thompson challenges the Commissionâ€™s denial of his request for funds for upfitting the new home, while American Interstate challenges the partial lump sum payment award.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  In a typical appeal from the Commission, we review facts based on the substantial evidence standard.Â  Under this approach, the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  The appellate court may reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act sets forth a special standard for review of lump sum payments:Â  â€œUpon a finding by the commission that a lump sum payment should be made, the burden of proof as to the abuse of discretion in such finding shall be upon the employer or carrier in any appeal proceedings.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-301 (1985).Â  Therefore, we review the partial lump sum award for an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs if the Commissionâ€™s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law.Â  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation,&nbsp;336 S.C. 373, 398, 520 S.E.2d 142, 155&nbsp;(1999).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThompson appeals the Commissionâ€™s denial of his request for the funds needed to upfit the new home to accommodate his paraplegia.Â  American Interstateâ€™s cross-appeal raises numerous issues challenging the partial lump sum payment award, payment for the prescribed equipment, and the requirement that the lump sum payment be deducted from the â€œback endâ€ of Thompsonâ€™s lifetime benefits.Â  We first consider American Interstateâ€™s appeal.\r\nI.\r\nAmerican Interstateâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â Partial Lump Sum Award \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  American Interstate contends the Commission erred in awarding Thompson a partial lump sum payment from his lifetime benefits.Â  It maintains the award: (1) should not be permitted until Thompson has been conclusively determined to be totally and permanently disabled; (2) is prohibited by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act; and (3) is not in Thompsonâ€™s best interest.Â  \r\n1.Â Â Finding of Disability\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Section 42-9-10 governs the payment of workersâ€™ compensation benefits for total disability.Â  It allows â€œany person determined to be totally and permanently disabled who as a result of a compensable injury is a paraplegic, . . . [to] receive the benefits for life.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\nAmerican Interstate contends the Commission erred in awarding a partial lump sum from Thompsonâ€™s lifetime benefits when it has not been conclusively proven that Thompson is entitled to lifetime benefits.Â  This issue is not preserved for review on appeal, as it was not raised before the Commission or the circuit court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  Not only did American Interstate fail to challenge Thompsonâ€™s entitlement to lifetime benefits, American Interstate stipulated to Thompsonâ€™s entitlement to the lifetime benefits award at the hearing before the single commissioner:\r\n\r\n  Thompsonâ€™s Counsel:Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  First of all, since . . . thereâ€™s not a contest about this Iâ€™m sure, but since thereâ€™s no order in place confirming Mr. Thompsonâ€™s entitlement to lifetime benefits under [42-9-10] by reason of the fact that he is a paraplegic as a result of his job accident, Iâ€™d like any order . . . to establish that for the record . . . . \r\n  American Interstateâ€™s Counsel:Â Â Â  We can address that now.Â  We wonâ€™t have an objection to that.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  American Interstateâ€™s Counsel:Â Â Â  Weâ€™ll stipulate to that.\r\n  Commissioner:Â Â  So stipulated.Â  \r\n\r\nBecause American Interstate stipulated to the award of lifetime benefits under section 42-9-10, it may not complain about the award on appeal.Â  â€œA stipulation is an agreement, admission or concession made in judicial proceedings by the parties thereto or their attorneys.Â  Stipulations, of course, are binding upon those who make them.â€Â  Kirkland v. Allcraft Steel Co., Inc., 329 S.C. 389, 392, 496 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1998) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n2.Â  Partial Lump Sum Payment from Lifetime Benefits\r\nAmerican Interstate next maintains the payment of a partial lump sum from Thompsonâ€™s lifetime benefits award violates section 42-9-10 and is impossible to calculate or liquidate because it is contingent upon his survival.Â  \r\nSection 42-9-301 empowers the Commission to order lump sum payments:\r\n\r\n  Whenever any weekly payment has been continued for not less than six weeks, the liability therefor may, when the employee so requests and the commission deems it not to be contrary to the best interest of the employee or his dependents, or when it will prevent undue hardship on the employer or his insurance carrier, without prejudicing the interest of the employee or his dependents, be redeemed, in whole or in part, by the payment by the employer of a lump sum which shall be fixed by the commission . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-301 (1985).Â  However, section 42-9-10 provides:Â  â€œNotwithstanding the provisions of Â§ 42-9-301, no total lump sum payment may be ordered by the commission in any case under this section where the injured person is entitled to lifetime benefits.â€ (Emphasis added).\r\nIn Glover v. Suitt Construction Company, our supreme court determined that section 42-9-10 does not prohibit recovery of attorneyâ€™s fees in a partial lump sum payment from a claimantâ€™s lifetime benefits.Â  318 S.C. 465, 469-70, 458 S.E.2d 535, 538 (1995).Â  The court noted:Â  \r\n\r\n  Employer contends our interpretation of Â§ 42-9-10 will permit the Commission to order partial lump sum benefits to a claimant awarded lifetime benefits, a result clearly not intended by the legislature.Â  The sole issue presently before this Court is lump sum payment of attorneyâ€™s fees and, accordingly, we decline to address Employerâ€™s contention.Â  In any event, if, as Employer suggests, the statute and Regulation may be so construed, the matter is one for the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nId. at 470 n.4, 458 S.E.2d at 538 n.4 (emphasis in original). \r\nThe court in Glover reasoned that the contingent nature of lifetime benefitsâ€”the fact they are only paid during the life of the claimantâ€”should not prohibit the award of a partial lump sum for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Id. at 469-70, 458 S.E.2d at 538.Â  The court explained that â€œthe mortality tables provide an adequate basis upon which to determine the present day value.â€Â  Id. at 467 n.3, 458 S.E.2d at 537 n.3.\r\nThis court had occasion to specifically address the question before us today, that is, whether section 42-9-10â€™s prohibition against a â€œtotal lump paymentâ€ from the injured personâ€™s lifetime benefits precludes partial lump sum payments of lifetime benefits.Â  Cox v. Bellsouth Telecomms., 356 S.C. 468, 589 S.E.2d 766 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, (Apr. 7, 2005).Â  In Cox, we held this provision was â€œnot intend[ed] to prohibit partial lump sum payments of lifetime benefits.â€Â Â  Cox, 356 S.C. at 472, 589 S.E.2d at 768 (emphasis in original).Â  We stated that â€œ[p]ermitting partial lump sum payments provides the commission needed flexibility in lifetime benefits cases, flexibility it regularly exercises with respect to all other compensation awards, to ensure the best interests of the injured worker are protected.â€Â  Id. at 472-73, 589 S.E.2d at 768-69.\r\nWe discern no reason to deviate from this courtâ€™s prior holding allowing partial lump sum payments to lifetime benefits recipients.Â  As found in Cox:Â  â€œHad the General Assembly desired to eliminate all lump sum payments in lifetime benefits cases, it could have omitted the word â€˜totalâ€™ from the provision, or it could have specifically provided that â€˜allâ€™ lump sum payments were prohibited.â€Â  Id. at 472, 589 S.E.2d at 768.[3]\r\nWe hold the Commission was empowered to award a partial lump sum payment from Thompsonâ€™s lifetime monetary benefits award.[4]Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n3.Â Â Best Interest of Thompson\r\nAmerican Interstate next contends the payment of the lump sum award is not in the best interest of Thompson or his family.Â  We find the Commission did not abuse its discretion in making the award to Thompson.\r\nIn determining whether to award a lump sum payment to a claimant, the Commission must consider whether the award will cause a hardship to the employer or carrier and whether the payment would be in the best interest of the claimant and his family.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-301 (1985).Â  â€œUpon a finding by the commission that a lump sum payment should be made, the burden of proof as to the abuse of discretion in such finding shall be upon the employer or carrier in any appeal proceedings.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe Thompsons were living in the uncleâ€™s rental home to save money, in hopes of ultimately purchasing their own home.Â  The rental home was not intended to be a permanent home for the Thompsons.Â  The Thompsons had saved approximately $8,000 at the time of the accident.Â  Further, there is evidence supporting the view that by moving to an adjoining county, the Thompson children would attend better schools.Â  American Interstate provides no evidence indicating the award would be detrimental to Thompson or his family.Â  \r\nWe find the record supports the Commissionâ€™s determination that American Interstate failed to provide credible evidence to show the funds would be squandered or that the purpose for which Thompson sought the funds was wasteful or unreasonable.Â  We conclude there is ample evidence to support the finding that a partial lump sum award is in Thompsonâ€™s best interest.Â  We affirm the finding that Thompson is entitled to lifetime benefits, that the Commission has authority to order the partial lump sum from this award for construction of the new home, and that American Interstate has failed to demonstrate that the Commission abused its discretion.Â Â  \r\nB.Â Â Deduction from the â€œBack Endâ€ \r\nAmerican Interstate contends the Commission erred in finding the partial lump sum payment should be deducted from the â€œback endâ€ of Thompsonâ€™s lifetime monetary benefits award.Â  This issue is not properly preserved for review on appeal.Â  \r\nAmerican Interstate raised the issue as an exception to the Commission in its appeal from the single commissionerâ€™s ruling.Â  However, the Commission never specifically addressed the issue of â€œhow . . . payments are to be â€˜deducted from the back endâ€™ as stated in the single commissionerâ€™s order.â€Â  The Commission simply reiterated the requirement that the partial lump sum be deducted from the â€œback endâ€ of Thompsonâ€™s lifetime benefits.Â  This reference fails to show that the Commission made a ruling sufficient for preservation.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding an issue was not preserved for appellate review when the trial court did not explicitly rule on the appellantâ€™s argument).Â  Beyond this, nothing in the record demonstrates the issue was raised to the circuit court on appeal.Â  See, e.g., United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 107, 413 S.E.2d 866, 869 (Ct. App. 1992) (finding that when the circuit court sitting in an appellate capacity does not address an issue and the party makes no motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the alleged error is not preserved for further appellate review).Â Â  \r\nC.Â Â Exercise and Therapeutic Equipment\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  American Interstateâ€™s final contention is that the Commission erred in requiring it to provide the equipment prescribed by Thompsonâ€™s doctor.Â  This issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  The circuit court found the award to be law of the case, specifically stating:\r\n\r\n  The Single Commissioner ordered, [and] the Commission on Appeal sustained[,] [the finding that] â€œ[t]he Employer shall provide or cause to be provided the exercise equipment and aquatic therapy prescribed by Dr. Bailey[.]â€Â  The Full Commission upheld this provision of [the single commissionerâ€™s] order.Â  [American Interstateâ€™s] Specifications of Error do not take exception to this portion of the Order and, therefore, it is the law of the case.Â  [American Interstate] must provide this equipment.Â  \r\n\r\nFinding nothing in the record to the contrary, we affirm this portion of the circuit courtâ€™s order pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR.\r\nII.\r\nThompsonâ€™s AppealÂ Â  \r\nA.Â Â Refusal to Award Modifications to New Home\r\nThompson asserts the Commission erred in denying his request for the funds needed to upfit the new home to accommodate his special needs.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially, we address the applicable standard of review for this award. The initial award by the single commissioner for the upfit to the new home expressly provided that the â€œcost of these construction features shall not be deducted from Claimantâ€™s monetary benefits.â€Â  Because the Commission cited an abuse of discretion standard when addressing the request for funds to upfit the home, it appears the Commission considered this request as one for a partial lump sum award.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-301.Â  Here, however, the amount for the upfit, while a lump sum in common parlance, is not part of (and is not to be deducted from) the benefits award.Â  The statutory abuse of discretion standard, therefore, may not be applicable on this issue.Â  Review of the Commissionâ€™s decision here may fall under the general substantial evidence standard.Â  We need not resolve this standard of review question, for we find the Commission committed legal errorâ€”the Commissionâ€™s decision may not be sustained under either standard of review.Â  We conclude that the Commission erred as a matter of law in awarding the lump sum payment for construction of the home, yet refusing to award funds sufficient to upfit the home to meet Thompsonâ€™s special needs resulting from his paraplegia.Â  See Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation,&nbsp;336 S.C. 373, 398, 520 S.E.2d 142, 155&nbsp;(1999) (holding that an abuse of discretion occurs if the trial courtâ€™s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or its conclusions are controlled by an error of law); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co.,&nbsp;324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (â€œOn appeal from the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.â€).Â  \r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act authorizes the Commission to order an employer to pay for reasonably necessary medical costs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985).Â  The contractorâ€™s estimate specifies that the $83,700 includes the cost of necessary accommodations such as a handicapped-accessible shower and bath, wider halls and door openings, and handicap ramps.Â  Additionally, it includes building modifications necessary for the exercise and therapeutic equipment.Â  The modifications are necessitated solely by Thompsonâ€™s admittedly compensable injury.Â  The bottom line is that Thompson cannot live in the proposed home without the modifications to accommodate his paraplegia.Â  Under these circumstances, the effort by the Commission to â€œsplit the babyâ€ cannot stand.Â  Because neither the new home nor the exercise equipment would benefit Thompson without these additional modifications, we hold the Commission erred in denying the award to modify and upfit the proposed home.\r\nWe are not unmindful that this award may involve some duplication of the previous upfit of the rental home, but this fact, standing alone, is not dispositive.Â  Moreover, while we acknowledge the understandable opposition of an employer or insurance carrier to the prospect of paying for multiple moves, the present posture of this case does not warrant those concerns.Â  The result we reach today is influenced by two factors.Â  \r\nFirst, the Thompsons never intended to reside permanently in the uncleâ€™s rental home.Â  Prior to Thompsonâ€™s disabling injury, the family planned to move to a permanent home, a move that would be in response to the best interests of the Thompson children, particularly their education.Â  That move was to be accomplished through Thompsonâ€™s income from work and family savings, as evidenced by the $8,000 saved as of the time of the accident.Â  The devastating blow of Thompsonâ€™s paraplegia should not be compounded by a legal decree that would effectively preclude the dream of home ownership.Â  It would be unreasonable to expect the Thompsons to live permanently in the uncleâ€™s rental home and completely abandon their hopes for some semblance of a normal life.Â  \r\nSecond, American Interstateâ€™s claim of â€œduplicationâ€ is only partially true, for substantial additional modifications to the uncleâ€™s rental home would be required were the Thompsons to remain there.Â  The contractor who performed the original modifications to the Thompsonsâ€™ rental home indicated that between $37,750 and $39,250 in further modifications would be necessary for the installation and use of the prescribed exercise and therapy equipment.Â  American Interstate knew at the time of the prior upfit to the rental home that the Thompsons could not be expected to remain there for the rest of their lives.Â  Accordingly, we reverse this portion of the Commissionâ€™s order and reinstate the award of $83,700 for upfitting the new home. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the Commission did not abuse its discretion in awarding Thompson a partial lump sum payment from his lifetime benefits award.Â  We additionally affirm the Commissionâ€™s award of the exercise equipment and therapy equipment.Â  We reverse the Commissionâ€™s denial of Thompsonâ€™s request for the funds necessary to upfit the new home.Â  The decision of the Commission is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Appellate counsel for South Carolina Steel Erectors and American Interstate did not represent Respondents-Appellants before the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission or in the circuit court.\r\n[2] Â Neither the upfitting award nor the funds for the therapeutic and exercise equipment are to be deducted from Thompsonâ€™s lifetime benefits. \r\n[3] Â American Interstate argues that the supreme court has effectively reversed our Cox precedent in Stone v. Roadway Express, 367 S.C. 575, 627 S.E.2d 695 (2006).Â  In Stone, the court held that an employeeâ€™s widow is not entitled to continue receiving benefits after the employeeâ€™s death when the employee was receiving compensation under the first paragraph of section 42-9-10.Â  Id. at 586, 627 S.E.2d at 700.Â  The holding in Stone is grounded in a statute that governs the â€œpayment of the unpaid balance of compensationâ€ when the employee dies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-280 (1985).Â  Section 42-9-280 permits the payment of the unpaid balance of compensation to the â€œnext of kin dependentâ€ when the compensation was â€œfor an injury covered by the second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-30.â€Â  Stone has no application here, for Thompson is receiving lifetime benefits, and there is no claim of entitlement by a third party to Thompsonâ€™s benefits.Â  We believe the holding in Coxâ€”authorizing the Commission under Â§ 42-9-10 to award partial lump sum payments of lifetime benefitsâ€”remains binding precedent on this court.Â  \r\n[4] Â American Interstateâ€™s policy argumentsâ€”that allowing a partial lump sum payment is tantamount to creating a life insurance account or a savings account for the claimantâ€”were not specifically raised to nor ruled on by the Commission and are not preserved for our review on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4110","title":"Fast Photo v.

Holdings, Inc., obtained a personal judgment against Jay and Barbara Specter for $62,730, and a writ of execution was filed on March 20, 1996.Â  An attempt was made to execute the judgment, but the sheriffâ€™s office returned the execution against property to the clerk marked â€œnulla bonaâ€ on August 14, 1996.Â  M.P.H. Holdings dissolved in 2002, and it surrendered its authority to do business in South Carolina.Â  \r\nIn the summer of 2002, Jay Specter inherited one-fifth of the personal property from his fatherâ€™s estate, and his portion of the personal property was valued at $31,000.[3]Â  On August 25, 2004, the attorney for M.P.H. Holdings petitioned the master for a supplemental proceeding in an attempt to execute the judgment.Â  Accompanying the petition was an affidavit from the attorney alleging that she was the attorney for petitioner M.P.H. Holdings.Â  The master issued a rule to show cause and scheduled a hearing. \r\nA hearing was held on September 23, 2004, to determine whether the Specters had any assets that could be used to satisfy the judgment.Â  Jay Specter initially appeared with counsel, but counsel was relieved during the hearing after revealing a conflict of interest.Â  The attorney who had filed the request for supplemental proceedings on behalf of M.P.H. Holdings informed the court that the corporationâ€™s assets were transferred to its successor in interest, Bank One, and she was authorized to execute the judgment on behalf of Bank One.[4]Â  During the hearing, Jay Specter asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to every question asked of him, and he requested a continuance in order to obtain new counsel.Â  M.P.H. Holdings provided evidence of the $31,000 in assets Specter inherited from his fatherâ€™s estate.Â Â Â  \r\nThe master granted M.P.H. Holdingsâ€™ request to execute judgment as to the $31,000 Specter inherited, and he also granted Specterâ€™s request for a continuance.Â  An order was signed by the master and filed on September 23, 2004, directing the personal representative of Specterâ€™s fatherâ€™s estate to distribute Jay Specterâ€™s interest in the personal property to M.P.H. Holdings.Â  The order further directed that any property owned by the Specters, above any homestead exemption, should be transferred.Â  The Specters filed a notice of appeal from the September 23, 2004 order on September 27, 2004.Â  \r\nOn September 28, 2004, the continued matter was heard before the master, and the Specters appeared pro se.Â  The attorneys for M.P.H. Holdings requested that the master issue a supplemental order transferring title of two cars in the Spectersâ€™ possession.Â  The master declined to issue an order transferring title of the two cars pending disposition of the appeal.Â  However, the master restrained the Specters from disposing of the cars.Â  The written order, entitled â€œOrder Restraining Damage, Concealment, Transfer, or Removal of Property,â€ was filed November 3, 2004.Â  The Specters filed a motion to reconsider this order on November 8, 2004.Â  Nothing in the record indicates this motion has ever been heard or ruled upon.Â  Further, the Specters have not filed a notice of appeal from the November 3, 2004 restraining order.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSupplementary proceedings are equitable in nature.â€Â  Ag-Chem Equip. Co. v. Daggerhart, 281 S.C. 380, 383, 315 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In an equitable matter referred to a master for final judgment with direct appeal to the supreme court, the appellate court may determine the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Friarsgate, Inc., v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 452, 456, 454 S.E.2d 901, 904 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The appellate court is not required, however, to disregard the findings of the master.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Preservation (Issues 2, 3, and 4)\r\nThe Specters argue the master erred in ordering the transfer of Jay Specterâ€™s interest in his fatherâ€™s estate because:Â  (1) M.P.H. Holdings should not have been allowed to bring the action to examine the Specters if it sold or transferred its interest in the judgment; (2) M.P.H. Holdings failed to take possession of Jay Specterâ€™s interest in his fatherâ€™s estate prior to the September 30, 2004 expiration of the judgment; and (3) it was error for the master to issue the November 8, 2004 restraining order more than thirty days after the expiration of the judgment as an attempt to extend the judgment past the ten-year deadline.Â  These arguments are not preserved for appellate review.Â Â  \r\n A.Â  Transfer of M.P.H. Holdingsâ€™ Interest\r\nThe Specters argue that it was error for the master to allow M.P.H. Holdings to bring an action to examine them if it transferred its interest in the judgment to Bank One.\r\nBefore he was relieved due to a conflict of interest, the Spectersâ€™ attorney argued at the September 23, 2004 hearing that the action could not properly be brought because it was not clear who was bringing the action, there was a question concerning whether M.P.H. Holdings had standing to bring the action as a dissolved corporation, and there was a question concerning whether the action had been authorized.Â  The master overruled the objection.Â  No arguments were raised concerning whether M.P.H. Holdings could still maintain an action in its name after transferring its assets, and the master did not address this question in his order.Â  Further, the Specters failed to raise this issue in a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Because this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the master, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (noting that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).\r\n B. Failure to take possession prior to expiration of the judgment\r\nThe Specters assert the judgment against them has now expired, and thus, M.P.H. Holdings is not now entitled to distribution of the proceeds from Jay Specterâ€™s fatherâ€™s estate.\r\nJudgments are enforced through writs of execution.Â  Rule 69, SCRCP.Â  Executions may issue upon a final judgment â€œat any time within ten years from the date of the original entry thereof.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-30 (2005); see Home Port Rentals, Inc. v. Moore, 359 S.C. 230, 234, 597 S.E.2d 810, 812 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting that the statutory ten-year enforcement period cannot be tolled, and thus the judgment is â€œutterly extinguishedâ€ ten years from the date of the entry of judgment), cert. granted (Sept. 22, 2005). \r\nThe Specters are correct in asserting that the ten-year enforcement period expired on September 30, 2004.Â  However, the master issued an order on September 23, 2004, directing the personal representative of Paul Specterâ€™s estate to distribute Jay Specterâ€™s interest to M.P.H. Holdings.Â  The Specters filed their notice of appeal on September 27, 2004.Â  Thus, the order transferring Specterâ€™s inheritance and the Spectersâ€™ notice of appeal were both filed prior to the expiration of the judgment.Â  The issue of whether the judgment had expired was never raised to the master prior to the filing of the Spectersâ€™ appeal.Â  Thus, this matter is being raised for the first time on appeal.Â  Because the issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the master, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546.\r\n C. November 8, 2004 restraining order\r\nThe Specters argue the duration of the judgment could not have been extended by the November 8, 2004 restraining order because it was filed over thirty days after the September 30, 2004 expiration of the judgment.Â  Thus, they argue, it was error for the master to issue the restraining order, and the order should be â€œcancelled.â€Â  \r\nThe Spectersâ€™ notice of appeal, filed September 27, 2004, indicates they were only appealing from the masterâ€™s September 23, 2004 order.Â  Therefore, any concerns regarding the November 8, 2004 restraining order are not before this court.Â  Further, the record does not indicate that the issue of whether the restraining order would improperly extend the duration of the judgment was ever raised before or ruled upon by the master.Â  Because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, it is not properly preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546.\r\nII. Standing (Issue 1)\r\nThe Specters argue it was improper for M.P.H. Holdings, a dissolved corporation, to maintain the supplemental action in South Carolina against them because it no longer had a certificate of authority from the Secretary of State.Â  \r\nForeign corporations seeking to conduct business in this state must obtain a certificate of authority from the Secretary of State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-15-103 (1990 &amp; Supp. 2004) (outlining the procedures for obtaining a certificate of authority); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-15-105(a) (1990) (noting that a certificate of authority allows a foreign corporation to transact business in this state).Â  A foreign corporation may withdraw from conducting business in this state by obtaining a certificate of withdrawal from the Secretary of State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-15-200 (1990).Â  However, corporations that do not have a certificate of authority may not initiate proceedings in the courts of this state until a certificate of authority is obtained.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-15-102(a), (e) (1990) (noting that a foreign corporation may not initiate a judicial proceeding in this state without a certificate of authority, but this requirement does not prevent a foreign corporation from defending an action in this state).Â  Nevertheless, a dissolved corporation may continue to conduct limited business as necessary to collect its assets.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-105(a)(1) (1990) (â€œA dissolved corporation continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business affairs, including . . . collecting its assets . . . .â€).Â  Dissolved corporations must wind up business affairs as â€œexpeditiously as possible.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-105 (b) (1990).\r\nM.P.H. Holdings applied to surrender its authority to do business in South Carolina on June 28, 2002.Â  The corporation also issued its certificate of dissolution on July 30, 2002.Â  M.P.H. initiated the supplemental proceeding on August 25, 2004, two years after dissolution.Â  Nothing in the record indicates that M.P.H. Holdings applied for another certificate of authority.Â  \r\nAt the September 23rd hearing, the Spectersâ€™ attorney raised issues before the master concerning:Â  (1) whether the supplemental proceeding could be properly brought by M.P.H. Holdings, a dissolved corporation; (2) whether Bank One had standing where there was no indication that it was assigned M.P.H. Holdingsâ€™ assets; or (3) whether the filing attorney had any authority to bring the supplemental action.Â  In arguing the issue of whether M.P.H. Holdings had standing as a dissolved corporation to bring the action, the Spectersâ€™ attorney noted that South Carolina law provides dissolved corporations cannot bring actions in the state.Â  The attorney submitted copies of the surrender of authority, and he noted that no one had made an application for a certificate of authority.Â  The master noted that dissolved corporations could conduct business to collect their assets.Â  The master later overruled the attorneyâ€™s objections just prior to relieving him from his representation of the Specters due to a conflict.Â  The master did not address whether M.P.H. Holdings had standing to bring the supplemental action or whether M.P.H. Holdings could maintain the action without a certificate of authority in the September 23, 2004 written order.\r\nInitially, we note this issue appears to be preserved.Â  Although the master referred to section 33-14-105 in his discussions with the attorneys, the Spectersâ€™ attorney continued to argue the standing issue and specifically noted that no one had made an application for a certificate of authority.Â  The master overruled the objections.Â  Thus, despite the fact that the issue was not addressed by the written order, the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the master.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546 (noting that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review). \r\nAs to the merits, we are troubled by the lack of evidence in the record regarding the authority of M.P.H. Holdings to initiate the supplemental proceedings.Â  A plain reading of section 33-15-102(a) requires a foreign corporation to have a certificate of authority prior to initiating any action in this state.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€); see also Chet Adams Co. v. James F. Pederson Co., 307 S.C. 33, 37, 413 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1992) (holding the failure of a foreign corporation to obtain a certificate of authority prior to bringing an action to recover monies owed on an account affected the corporationâ€™s capacity to sue but did not affect the courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction).Â  Although the master referred to section 33-14-105 as allowing a dissolved corporation to pursue its assets, nothing in that section appears to indefinitely relieve a dissolved foreign corporation from obtaining a certificate of authority prior to bringing actions in South Carolina courts pursuant to section 33-15-102(a).Â  Because there was no evidence in the record that M.P.H. Holdings applied for another certificate of authority in order to initiate the supplemental proceedings, we agree with the Specters that the master erred in failing to find M.P.H. Holdings did not have standing to bring the underlying action.[5]\r\nFurther, we do not believe the action could have been properly maintained by Bank One, the alleged successor in interest.Â  Certainly, a successor in interest may maintain a supplemental action to examine a judgment debtor in order to execute a judgment.Â  See Rule 69, SCRCP (allowing a judgment creditor, or the â€œsuccessor in interest when that interest appears of record,â€ to examine judgment debtors in aid of execution of a judgment).Â  However, the supplemental proceeding below was filed in the name of M.P.H. Holdings, not Bank One, no documents were produced evidencing that Bank One was the successor in interest, and nothing was produced to show that Bank One had a certificate of authority to bring an action in South Carolina.Â  Moreover, section 33-15-102(a) would prohibit a successor in interest from maintaining an action without obtaining a certificate of authority.Â  \r\nAlthough M.P.H. Holdingsâ€™ attorney asserted to the master that Bank One was the successor in interest, was the real entity bringing the action, and had a certificate of authority, there was no evidence presented to support these assertions.Â  We find there was no evidence of record to support a finding that Bank One was the successor in interest with authority to initiate the supplemental proceedings below.Â  Accordingly, the master erred in issuing the September 24, 2004 order.\r\nIII.Â  Attorney Authority (Issue 5)\r\nThe Specters argue that a law firm or its associates may not â€œbring an action . . . on behalf of a dissolved corporation that they knew was dissolved and then at trial claim that they . . . were representing a third party not mentioned or referenced in the Petition or accompanying Affidavit . . . .â€Â Â  \r\nAs discussed above, the attorneyâ€™s affidavit filed in support of the underlying action alleged that she was the attorney for M.P.H. Holdings, the petitioner, in the request for the supplemental proceedings.Â  Prior to being relieved, the Spectersâ€™ attorney objected to going forward with the action merely on the representation of an attorney that there was an assignment of the judgment to Bank One.Â  The Spectersâ€™ attorney argued the action could not go forward because M.P.H. Holdings was a dissolved corporation and there was no evidence of an assignment.Â  The master overruled the objection.Â Â Â  \r\nThere is nothing in the record showing that Bank One was a successor in interest to this action or that the attorney represented Bank One.Â  Thus, the record before us would indicate that the attorney filed the matter without authority from a client.Â  See Dunkley v. Shoemate, 515 S.E.2d 442, 445 (N.C. 1999) (finding the trial court erred in allowing a law firm to represent a client in a matter where the firm had no contact with the client and had not been authorized by the client to act on his behalf).Â  Accordingly, we find the master erred in issuing the September 24, 2004 order when there was no indication that the moving attorney had proper authority to bring the action. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere is no evidence in the record before us showing that M.P.H. Holdings had a certificate of authority to bring the underlying supplemental action, no evidence showing that Bank One was the successor in interest to M.P.H. Holdings with a certificate of authority to bring the action, and no evidence that the attorney was authorized to bring the supplemental proceedings.Â  Accordingly, the master erred in issuing the September 24, 2004 order.Â  The masterâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent M.P.H. Holdings has not filed a final brief in this case. \r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  The will further instructed that the house in which Jay and Barbara lived, valued at over $200,000, and any remainder of the $1,000,000 estate should be placed in the â€œJay M. Specter Trust.â€Â  \r\n[4]Â  The master overruled Specterâ€™s objection that Bank One did not have standing to file the supplemental proceedings to enforce M.P.H. Holdingsâ€™ judgment.Â  Because the standing question is also an issue on appeal, we will continue to refer to the moving party in the underlying supplemental proceedings as â€œM.P.H. Holdingsâ€ in accordance with the caption.Â Â  \r\n[5] Despite the masterâ€™s reliance on section 33-14-105(a) as allowing a dissolved corporation to wind up its affairs, we note that the two year delay before M.P.H. Holdings brought the underlying action does not comport with the statutory mandate that winding up shall be accomplished as â€œexpeditiously as possible.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-105(b) (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4111","title":"LandBank Fund VII, LLC v.

Dickerson, Dickerson &amp; Sons, Inc., and Phoenix Land and Development Company, LLC,[1] appeal a decision of the Horry County Master-in-Equity concluding Dickerson was not entitled to additional compensation for certain work performed on behalf of LandBank Fund VII, LLC.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1995, Joe C. Garrell, a Myrtle Beach resident and licensed realtor, recruited investors from among his family and friends for the purpose of acquiring and reselling a large tract of land in Horry County.Â  The group of investors formed LandBank, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company, to facilitate the transaction.Â  Garrell received a real estate commission on the land sale and a membership interest in the company for his efforts in forming the entity and acquiring the land.\r\n The initial LandBank transaction proceeded smoothly and was financially beneficial to the company and its members.Â  Accordingly, the transaction was followed by several other purchases, most from the same seller as the initial transaction, International Paper. To facilitate these subsequent purchases, four additional limited liability companies were formed.Â  The companies were ultimately dubbed Landbank II, LandBank Fund III, LandBank Fund IV, and Landbank Fund V.Â  LandBank entities II through V were each concerned with separate purchases, and the subsequent sale of, different tracts of land, but were virtually identical in membership and operation to the original LandBank, LLC.\r\nIn 1999, LandBank Resource Management, LLC, (â€œLRMâ€) was formed to provide management services to all the LandBank entities.Â  According to the respondent, LRM was a board managed entity owning no property.Â  Its function was to manage the LandBank entities, review and consider additional LandBank investor opportunities, and meet the service needs of the various LandBank entities, including the procurement of surveying, engineering, land planning, legal, zoning, utilities, and environmental services.Â  LRMâ€™s operational funds came from reimbursements by the other LandBank entities.Â  Though under the direction of the LRM board, Garrell handled the day-to-day management of LRM.\r\nIn 2000, Garrell began feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the extent of his LandBank responsibilities and requested that the LRM board allow him to seek professional assistance.Â  In March 2000, Garrell engaged the professional consulting services of Dickerson, a non-practicing attorney from Arizona who was knowledgeable and experienced in the acquisition and marketing of real estate.Â  These services were initially intended to be temporary and Dickersonâ€™s agreement with LandBank anticipated completion by around September 2000.\r\nLRM was pleased with the initial services provided by Dickerson.Â  In April 2001, Garrell, after again receiving the full consent of the LRM board, entered into a modification of Dickersonâ€™s consulting agreement.Â  In addition to the compensation called for in Dickersonâ€™s initial agreement, the modification called for a $30,000 â€œperformance based feeâ€ to be paid to Dickerson in appreciation of his prior efforts.Â  The modification also secured Dickersonâ€™s future services for an indefinite period of time, terminable upon six months notice by either party.Â  As compensation for his continued non-exclusive services, the modification called for Dickerson to receive $15,000 per month, $2,000 per month in home rental expenses, a sport utility vehicle, cell phone, computer, office, and company credit card.Â  The modification agreement also called for future â€œtransaction/performance-based compensation when justified and agreed to in advance.â€\r\nIn February 2002, Dickerson proposed a venture to the LRM board that was substantially different than LandBankâ€™s prior business activities.Â  Dickerson envisioned a â€œbeach clubâ€ concept for the benefit of the end purchasers of all the LandBank properties.Â  Because the properties were landlocked, he felt the purchase and development of a beachfront club and restaurant could be used to enhance the marketability of the LandBank properties.Â  The proposed beach club was to be acquired and developed by a separate LandBank entity, LandBank Fund VI.Â  This proposal was different from the previous LandBank entities in that it contemplated continued ownership and operation of a facility, rather than the simple acquisition, marketing, and sale of a tract of undeveloped land.\r\nDickerson pitched this new business concept to the LRM board on several occasions and submitted an official â€œsummary proposalâ€ in July 2002.Â  Due to the higher risk involved in this sort of business venture, the proposal was not as well received by the LandBank members as prior business opportunities.Â  In order to make LandBank Fund VI a more attractive investment for the members of the previous LandBank entities, the beach club plan (LandBank Fund VI) was coupled with a low-risk investment with a promising possibility of quick profit.Â  Named LandBank Fund VII, LLC, this business proposal was to fit the traditional mold of the LandBank through LandBank V entities.Â  It involved another purchase of a large tract of land from International Paper at $15,000 an acre and a potentially quick resell to homebuilder D.R. Horton for $20,000 an acre.Â  It was understood among the members of the prior LandBank entities that LandBank Fund VI and VII were a â€œpackage dealâ€ and membership in the lower risk LandBank Fund VII meant membership in the higher risk LandBank Fund VI.Â  Ultimately, about sixty-five percent of the LandBank members joined LandBank Fund VI and VII.\r\nBy September 2002, LandBank Fund VIIâ€™s purchase of the International Paper (â€œIPâ€) tract was under contract with Garrell.Â  The sales agreement with IP provided for the assignment of Garrellâ€™s contract rights to LandBank Fund VII prior to closing.Â  On December 6, 2002, LandBank Fund VII purchased the IP property.Â  Due largely to complications concerning environmental issues, the desired simultaneous sale to D.R. Horton was delayed.\r\n During several meetings leading up to the purchase of the IP tract, Dickerson did not disclose to the LRM board that, beginning as early as September 2002, he was attempting to obtain a very large â€œasset placement feeâ€ of three and one-half percent of the total D.R. Horton sales price payable to him by LandBank Fund VII upon closing.Â  According to Dickerson, this fee was openly discussed and fully approved by Garrell as early as the summer of 2002.Â  Richard Lovelace, an attorney for the LandBank entities who performed a substantial amount of work on the LandBank Fund VII transaction, supports Dickersonâ€™s claims regarding the fee, at least to the extent that the fee was discussed among Dickerson, Garrell, and himself.\r\nGarrell does not dispute the fact that Dickersonâ€™s fee was discussed between them.Â  According to Garrell, however, he made it very clear to Dickerson that he did not have the authority to approve such a large payment and the matter would first have to be approved of by the LRM board.Â  To this end, Garrell entered Dickersonâ€™s fee by hand on a draft closing statement just before a meeting between board chairman Lyle Ray King, Dickerson and himself on January 12, 2003.Â  According to both Garrell and King, the fee was unequivocally discussed at this meeting and King told Dickerson in unmistakable terms that the proposed fee was not acceptable and would not be approved by the board.\r\n Dickerson claims that the fee discussions with King were â€œnon-committalâ€ and that he left the meeting believing he still had a binding agreement regarding his additional fee due to his prior discussions with Garrell.Â  Nevertheless, two days after the meeting with King, Dickerson instructed attorney Lovelaceâ€™s staff to change the signature block on all future proposed contracts with D.R. Horton to reflect that it would be signed on behalf of LandBank Fund VII by â€œKent D. Dickerson, its Representative.â€Â  Dickersonâ€™s specific written instructions concerning the signature page included the phrase â€œNo Joe Garrell or Lyle Ray King.â€\r\nOn January 20, 2003, Dickerson signed and delivered (as LandBank Fund VIIâ€™s â€œRepresentativeâ€) to D.R. Horton a contract which included the payment of the â€œasset placement and assignment feeâ€ by LandBank Fund VII to Dickerson.Â  The negotiations with D.R. Horton concerning the contractâ€™s terms were handled exclusively by Dickerson and Lovelace and finalized on January 30, 2003.Â  There is a factual dispute between the parties as to the extent Garrell was kept abreast of these negotiations, including a heated disagreement as to when he first received a draft of the contract including Dickersonâ€™s disputed fee.Â  Garrell claims he was kept in the dark as to the specific terms of the contract drafts passing between Dickerson and D.R. Horton.\r\nOn February 21, 2003, Dickerson attended a meeting of the LandBank VI and VII Board of Managers.Â  At this meeting, Dickerson discussed the imminent closing of the D.R. Horton transaction and the board reviewed a sales and cash flow analysis for the upcoming sale.Â  Conspicuously absent from this presentation was any mention of the fee sought by Dickerson.Â  \r\nThe closing of LandBank Fund VIIâ€™s sale to D.R. Horton took place on March 13, 2003.Â  According to Garrell, he received a copy of the proposed final contract approximately ten days prior to the closing date.[2]Â  Upon noticing Dickersonâ€™s fee was included in this draft, Garrell told Dickerson the fee had not been approved by the board and must be removed from the final closing statement.Â  Nevertheless, Dickersonâ€™s desired fee appeared on the closing statement prepared by Lovelace on the day of closing.Â  When Garrell noticed the fee remained in the documents, he struck Dickersonâ€™s fee from the closing statement and refused to sign until a new closing statement was prepared that did not call for the payment of Dickersonâ€™s â€œasset placement fee.â€Â  The revised closing statements were prepared and the LandBank Fund VII sale to D.R. Horton was finalized.\r\nDickerson continued to claim entitlement to the $373,998 fee in conjunction with the 445-acre land sale to D.R. Horton.Â  LandBank Fund VII filed a complaint on May 2, 2003, seeking a declaratory judgment that Dickerson was not owed the disputed fee.Â  Dickerson counterclaimed, asserting he was entitled to the fee based on breach of contract or, alternatively, in quantum meruit for services provided.Â  The mater was referred by consent to the Horry County Master-in-Equity.Â  By order filed July 14, 2004, the Master-in-Equity granted LandBank Fund VIIâ€™s requested relief and dismissed Dickersonâ€™s counterclaims with prejudice.Â  Dickersonâ€™s motion to alter or amend the order was denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Breach of Contract\r\n An action alleging breach of contract is an action at law.Â  Airfare, Inc. v. Greenville Airport Commâ€™n, 249 S.C. 265, 269, 153 S.E.2d 846, 848 (1967); Foxfire Village, Inc. v. Black &amp; Veatch, Inc., 304 S.C. 366, 369, 404 S.E.2d 912, 914 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œIn an action at law, an appellate court will correct errors of law but must defer to the trial courtâ€™s factual findings and affirm unless there is no evidence reasonably supporting those findings.â€ Crafton v. Brown, 346 S.C. 347, 351, 550 S.E.2d 904, 905-906 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n In the present case, the Master-in-Equity, after reviewing the evidence presented and considering the testimony and credibility of the witnesses, found that Dickerson â€œfailed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a meeting of the minds as to the payment of a fee or commission . . . in connection with the sale of land to D.R. Horton.â€Â  Upon review of the record on appeal, we conclude the Masterâ€™s finding is supported by the evidence.\r\nThe burden of establishing the existence of an oral contract and its terms between Dickerson and LandBank Fund VII rests upon Dickerson.Â  See Jackson v. Frier, 146 S.C. 322, 329, 144 S.E. 66, 68 (1928) (â€œThe burden is on a party pleading a fact to prove it.â€)Â  In order to establish the existence of an oral fee agreement, Dickerson must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a meeting of the minds as to all of the essential and material terms of the alleged agreement.Â  See Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 104-105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893-894 (1989).\r\nDespite Dickersonâ€™s relative sophistication in business and legal matters, no written agreement to pay the fee signed by LandBank Fund VII was ever obtained (excluding the D.R. Horton contract signed only by Dickerson as a â€œRepresentativeâ€ of LandBank Fund VII).Â  Accordingly, the Master was confronted with highly conflicting testimony and evidence concerning the presence or absence of a verbal agreement.Â  Although Garrell does not dispute the fact that he discussed payment of the disputed fee with Dickerson as early as the summer of 2002, he maintains, and the Master-in-Equity agreed, that he made clear to Dickerson any compensation in addition to that called for in his lucrative consulting agreement with LRM could only be obtained with board approval.Â  This understanding between LandBank Fund VII and Dickerson is further bolstered by the testimony of King, the board chairman, concerning the meeting of January 12, 2003, during which King explained to Dickerson the board would not approve such a large payment.Â  Dickerson was aware Garrell first sought and received board approval in every prior dealing concerning his compensation.\r\nConversely, Dickersonâ€™s own evidence and testimony tend to reflect the fluid nature of his alleged â€œasset placement feeâ€ agreement.Â  In several contract drafts present in the record on appeal, the percentage fee first appears in a document dated January 13, 2003, the day after Dickerson was told of the boardâ€™s probable denial of the proposed fee.Â  All previous drafts call for either no fee, a fee paid by D.R. Horton, a fee of $2000 per acre, or a fee of an indeterminate amount.Â  The testimony of Lovelace, LandBank Fund VIIâ€™s attorney, supporting Dickersonâ€™s claims goes only as far as to back up that Dickersonâ€™s fee was, in fact, discussed among Garrell, Dickerson, and Lovelace.Â  It does not refute Garrellâ€™s claims that Dickerson was made well aware of the need for board approval before any agreement concerning additional compensation would be binding on LandBank Fund VII.Â  \r\nIf Garrell made clear to Dickerson that any fee agreement was not valid until approved by the board, then clearly no meeting of the minds occurred between Garrell and Dickerson regarding the finality of Dickersonâ€™s fee agreement, regardless of Garellâ€™s actual or apparent authority to bind LandBank Fund VII.Â  The Master-in-Equity, considering conflicting evidence, determined that Dickerson was, in fact, made aware of the necessity for board approval.Â  Accordingly, he concluded Dickerson failed to carry his burden of proof establishing a binding fee agreement between the parties.Â  Because there is evidence reasonably supporting his conclusion, we affirm the Master on this basis.[3] [4]\r\nII. Quantum Meruit\r\nDickerson argues on appeal that the Master-in-Equity erred in dismissing his counterclaim for quantum meruit recovery based on Dickersonâ€™s receipt of compensation under his consulting agreement with LRM.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn action based on a theory of quantum meruit recovery sounds in equity.Â  Columbia Wholesale v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994).Â  When reviewing an action in equity, an appellate court â€œreviews the evidence to determine facts in accordance with [its] own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).\r\nIn order to establish a valid claim for recovery in quantum meruit, the plaintiff must establish â€œ(1) benefit conferred by [the] plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying it value.â€Â  Myrtle Beach Hospital, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000) (emphasis added).Â  Under his modified consulting agreement, Dickerson was compensated at over $250,000 per year by LRM, the managing entity of all the LandBank companies.Â  The modified agreement secured Dickersonâ€™s service to LRM, an entity with the stated goal of considering additional LandBank investor opportunities, for an indefinite period of time.Â  Furthermore, Dickersonâ€™s consulting agreement expressly states that future â€œ[t]ransaction/performance based compensationâ€ will be granted only â€œwhen justified and agreed to in advance.â€\r\nConsidering Dickersonâ€™s lucrative contract with LRM, we agree with the Master-in-Equityâ€™s conclusions on this matter.Â  We find nothing in the record on appeal that would make recovery by Dickerson on his quantum meruit claims appropriate or equitable.Â  The fact that LandBank Fund VI and VII were not in existence when Dickerson entered his consulting contract with LRM does not persuade this court such ventures were not contemplated when Dickersonâ€™s future services were secured.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Master-in-Equityâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This appeal and the underlying action involve the employment of Kent D. Dickerson, acting both individually and, in some instances, on behalf of the aforementioned companies.Â  Because the differing roles of Dickerson as both individual and head of these companies are not at issue, this opinion will collectively refer to all appealing entities as â€œDickersonâ€ for the remainder of this opinion.\r\n[2] There is a factual dispute between the parties as to when Garrell actually received this draft of the â€œfinalâ€ contract.\r\n[3] Because we affirm the Masterâ€™s finding that there was no meeting of the minds between Garrell and/or LandBank Fund VII and Dickerson concerning Dickersonâ€™s fee agreement, we need not address Dickersonâ€™s arguments regarding Garrellâ€™s presumptive authority to bind LandBank Fund VII.\r\n[4] Dickerson also argues that the ultimate closing of the D.R. Horton deal by LandBank VII amounts to a ratification of the contract and, with it, Dickersonâ€™s fee.Â  This issue is wholly without merit.Â  The present appeal concerns an alleged fee agreement between Dickerson and LandBank VII, not a material term of the contract between LandBank VII and D.R. Horton.Â  It would be a gross misapplication of the ratification doctrine to conclude that Dickerson, acting unilaterally as the â€œrepresentativeâ€ of LandBank VII, is entitled to the fee because he inserted it into a contract between two other parties, notwithstanding the fact that the land sale contract was ultimately consummated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4112","title":"Douan v.

Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987).Â  â€œThe question is whether in the light most favorable to plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief.â€Â  Id.\r\nII.&nbsp; \r\nIn 1995, the General Assembly enacted section 4-37-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  Section 4-37-10 authorizes a county to establish a transportation authority to oversee transportation-related projects funded through sales and use taxes or tolls.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 4-37-10 &amp; -30 (Supp. 2005).Â  If a county chooses to impose a sales and use tax, the county must enact an ordinance, and the ordinance must be accepted by the county citizenry through a referendum.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-37-30(A).Â  The question posed on the referendum ballot must substantially adhere to the model question set forth in section 4-37-30(A)(3).Â  If a majority of qualified electors answer the question in the affirmative, the sales and use tax is imposed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-37-30(A)(4).\r\nThe underlying dispute in this case arose from the Councilâ€™s enactment of an ordinance imposing a one-half percent sales and use tax to fund transportation-related projects within Charleston County.Â  To effectuate the ordinance, the Council planned to hold a referendum on November 5, 2002.Â  On October 7, Douan brought an action against the Council alleging the proposed ordinance exceeded the scope of section 4-37-30, which requires the ordinance be transportation-related.Â  Douan further alleged the proposed referendum question violated section 4-37-30(A)(3), which provides the form the question presented to the voters must take.Â  He sought a declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus, and injunctive relief.Â  Douan further sought attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-77-300, which allows the â€œprevailing partyâ€ of a â€œcivil actionâ€ against a State political subdivision to recover attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nOn October 24, the circuit court denied Douanâ€™s requests for a writ of mandamus and injunctive relief.Â  The court also declined to determine the legitimacy of the proposed referendum question, finding the issue rested in the supreme courtâ€™s exclusive jurisdiction.Â  Douan followed the lead of the circuit court and petitioned the supreme court.Â  The supreme court, however, denied his petition, rejecting the view of the circuit court that the supreme court had exclusive jurisdiction over questions prepared by the Council.Â  The exclusive jurisdiction of the supreme court is limited to questions prepared by the Ballot Commission.Â  On November 1, Douan filed a motion for reconsideration, which the circuit court summarily denied.Â  \r\nOn November 5, the referendum took place, and the proposed sales and use tax passed.Â  The next day, Douan challenged the referendum through the administrative process provided by statutory election law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-17-10 to -340 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Douan filed an election protest with the Charleston County Election Commission (the Commission) advancing the same grounds set forth in his civil action.Â  The Commission rejected the election protest, and Douan appealed to the State Election Commission (the State Commission).Â  The State Commission deadlocked, thus affirming the Commissionâ€™s decision.\r\nDouan appealed to the South Carolina Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor.Â  Douan v. Charleston County Council, 357 S.C. 601, 612-13, 594 S.E.2d 261, 266-67 (2003).Â  The supreme court voided the referendum results.\r\nIn the wake of the supreme court opinion, the previously filed civil action was called for trial in the Charleston County court of common pleas.Â  Douan moved the circuit court for summary judgment on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-7-300.Â  The Council moved to dismiss the civil action on the ground of mootness pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  The circuit court denied Douanâ€™s motion, and granted the Councilâ€™s motion to dismiss, holding that the supreme court opinion ended the case in Douanâ€™s favor, rendering the claim for attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-77-300 moot.Â  Douan appealed. \r\n&nbsp;III.\r\nDouan argues the circuit court erred in finding he was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-77-300 of the South Carolina Code because his civil action was moot.Â  We agree with Douan and hold that his claim for attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-77-300 should not have been dismissed based on the doctrine of\r\nmootness. \r\nSection 15-77-300 provides:\r\n\r\nIn any civil action brought by the State, any political subdivision of the State or any party who is contesting state action, unless the prevailing party is the State or any political subdivision of the State, the court may allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if:\r\n(1) The court finds that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and\r\n(2) The court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.\r\n\r\nThe statute clearly provides that certain elements must be met to recover attorneyâ€™s fees: (1) the party seeking attorneyâ€™s fees must be the prevailing party; (2) the unsuccessful agency must have acted without substantial justification in pressing the claim against the party; and (3) there must not be special circumstances that would make an award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.Â  City of Charleston v. Masi, 362 S.C. 505, 510, 609 S.E.2d 301, 304 (2005).Â  A â€œprevailing partyâ€ is a party who successfully prosecutes the action by prevailing on the main issue and â€œin whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.â€Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182-83, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990) (citing Buza v. Columbia Lumber Co., 395 P.2d 511, 514 (Alaska 1964)).Â  The key factor in determining whether a party is a prevailing party is the degree of success obtained by the party seeking attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Id. at 183, 394 S.E.2d at 711.Â  Additionally, â€œa party need not be successful as to all issues in order to be found to be a prevailing party.â€Â \r\nId. at 182, 394 S.E.2d at 711; Seckinger v. The Vessel, Excalibur, 326 S.C. 382, 388, 483 S.E.2d 775, 778 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nâ€œA matter becomes moot â€˜when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€™â€Â  Collins Music Co., Inc. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 549, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567-68, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001) (alterations in original)).[1]  \r\nIn our view, dismissal of Douanâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees, based on the doctrine of mootness, was improper.Â  The Council contended at oral argument that Douanâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees is essentially premature since the underlying merits of the civil action have yet to be adjudicated, a view at odds with the doctrine of mootness.Â  Indeed, Douanâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees may be addressed only after the underlying merits have been adjudicated.\r\nAlthough Douan prevailed in the related administrative proceeding, we make no finding as to the preclusive effect of the supreme court opinion in this action.Â  We further make no finding as to Douanâ€™s entitlement to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-77-300.Â  We simply hold that Douanâ€™s claim is not moot, and he is entitled to pursue his claim for relief in the civil action, specifically the request for attorneyâ€™s fees.[2]Â  \r\nIV.\r\nThe order of the circuit court dismissing as moot Douanâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees under section 15-77-300 isÂ  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; In civil cases, there are three exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) an appellate court can retain jurisdiction if the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review; (2) an appellate court can decide cases of urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest; and (3) if the decision by the trial court can affect future events or have collateral consequences to the parties, the appellate court can take jurisdiction.Â  Collins Music, 365 S.C. at 549, 619 S.E.2d at 3.Â  In this appeal, we do not reach an exception to the mootness doctrine, for Douanâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees is not moot.\r\n[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel for Douan stipulated at oral argument that the claim for attorneyâ€™s fees is limited to the civil action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4113","title":"Pirri v.

Anderson, Jr., of Greenwood; for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In this domestic cross-appeal, John Pirri (â€œHusbandâ€) argues the court erred in valuing marital property and in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Roberta Pirri (â€œWifeâ€).Â  Wife argues the court erred in failing to award her alimony, failing to find certain property was marital, and failing to find certain property was transmuted into marital property.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife began living together in Connecticut in 1971.Â  They never had a ceremonial wedding.Â  However, Wife began using â€œPirriâ€ as her last name sometime in the 1970s, and the parties filed joint income tax returns from the 1970s on.Â  Husband adopted Wifeâ€™s then nineteen-year-old daughter, Julia, in 1981, and changed her name to Julia Pirri.Â  The parties referred to each other as â€œhusbandâ€ and â€œwife,â€ and Husbandâ€™s will left his estate to â€œMrs. Pirri.â€Â  \r\nHusband was a successful veterinarian, and Wife worked in the clinic he owned from 1971 until 1978.Â  In 1978, the parties closed the veterinary clinic and converted the property to an indoor shooting range.Â  Husband and Wife continued to work at the shooting range until 1994.Â  Husband later leased the property to the Widewater hotel development corporation in 1998.Â  The parties maintained an affluent lifestyle, with joint checking accounts and investments, although Husband also had substantial investments in his own name.Â  \r\nIn 1990, the parties purchased 216 acres in Abbeville County, South Carolina, titled the property in both of their names, and built a large house upon the land.Â  They moved to South Carolina in 1996.Â  In addition to the house and acreage, Husband purchased an airplane after the parties moved to South Carolina.Â  The parties did not have any debt on these assets.Â  \r\nThe parties separated in 2002 when Wife discovered sexually explicit emails between Husband and other men.Â  Although Husband testified he was only having â€œcybersexâ€ and not actual physical encounters, Wife and the partiesâ€™ daughter, Julia, testified that Husband admitted having sexual encounters with two individuals with whom he was exchanging e-mails.Â  Wife left the home and filed the underlying action seeking:Â  a finding by the family court of a common law marriage; a divorce on the ground of adultery; equitable division of all of the marital estate; alimony; and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband counterclaimed, denying the existence of a marriage and requesting certain property and an accounting in the event the court found a marriage existed.Â  \r\nAt the beginning of the final hearing, the parties stipulated that a common law marriage existed in South Carolina.Â  Husband was also allowed to amend his pleadings to include a claim for divorce based on one year of continuous separation.Â  After hearing the evidence, the family court issued a final order declaring a common law marriage came into existence between the parties in 1996, when they moved to South Carolina.Â  The court granted Husband a divorce based upon one year of continuous separation, divided the partiesâ€™ property that was either jointly titled or obtained after 1996, denied Wifeâ€™s request for alimony, granted Wifeâ€™s request to return to the use of her maiden name, and awarded Wife $15,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The court denied the motion to alter or amend the judgment, and both Husband and Wife appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n A. Valuation of the Marital Home\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court abused its discretion in adopting Wifeâ€™s valuation of the marital home and acreage over his valuation.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must identify real and personal marital property and determine the propertyâ€™s fair market value.Â  Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996); Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 192, 375 S.E.2d 338, 340 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œIn the absence of contrary evidence, the court should accept the value the parties assign to a marital asset.â€Â  Noll, 297 S.C. at 194, 375 S.E.2d at 340-41.Â  The family court has broad discretion in valuing the marital property.Â  Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 478, 429 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  A family court may accept the valuation of one party over another, and the courtâ€™s valuation of marital property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented.Â  Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987) (affirming the family courtâ€™s valuation of property that was within the range of evidence presented); Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting that the family court is within its discretion to accept one partyâ€™s valuation over the other partyâ€™s).\r\nThere was evidence in the record to support the family courtâ€™s valuation of the marital home.Â  Both parties presented evidence regarding the value of the Abbeville County acreage and house.Â  Wife had the acreage and 4,500 square foot house appraised by Robert J. Deering.Â  According to the Deering appraisal, the house and land were valued at $725,000 as of September 26, 2002.Â  Husband had the land and house appraised by Keith Ridgeway, who valued the property at $567,400. Â Although the final divorce decree had â€œ$567,400â€ typed as the value adopted by the court, the family court judge crossed through this amount, wrote â€œ$725,000â€ as the value, and initialed the change.Â  Thus, the final written order adopted Wifeâ€™s value for the acreage and home.Â  \r\nBecause the family court was free to accept Wifeâ€™s valuation over Husbandâ€™s, we find no abuse of discretion in the valuation of the marital home.Â  \r\n\r\nB.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\n\r\nNoting that Wife did not receive a divorce based on adultery, alimony, or transmutation of property, Husband argues Wifeâ€™s attorney did not obtain a beneficial result and, thus, the family court erred in awarding her $15,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court may order payment of attorneyâ€™s fees to a party pursuant to statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2004).Â  Whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 633-34, 576 S.E.2d 156, 167 (2003).Â  In determining whether an award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be granted, the family court should consider:Â  the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee; the beneficial results obtained by counsel; the financial conditions of the parties; and the effect of the fee on each partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  To determine the amount of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider:Â  the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; counselâ€™s professional standing; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nIn awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife, the family court noted it had considered all of the factors in determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees and the appropriate amount of fees.Â  The family court noted that the case involved many issues, including novel issues of law, and that Wifeâ€™s attorney devoted a great deal of time to the case.Â  The court specifically stated that although â€œthe court was not persuaded as to all the relief sought by [Wifeâ€™s] attorney, beneficial results were clearly obtained.â€ \r\nWe agree with the family court.Â  Although Wife was unsuccessful in her attempt to use Connecticut law to obtain property purchased prior to 1996 and to receive a finding that property had been transmuted, she was successful in obtaining a finding that the parties were common law married, she received half of the post-1996 marital estate, and she was allowed to resume her pre-marital name.Â  The family court adequately considered the factors, and we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nII. Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Alimony\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in denying her alimony because the court failed to give adequate weight to the statutory factors by placing too much emphasis on the length of the marriage.[1]Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005).Â  The purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse in the position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  \r\nFactors to be considered in making an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œOur inquiry on appeal is not whether the family court gave the same weight to particular factors as this court would have; rather, our inquiry extends only to whether the family court abused its considerable discretion in assigning weight to the applicable factors.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 186, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œNo one factor is dispositive.â€Â  Id. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 425; Nienow v. Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 171, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977) (holding that in alimony considerations, â€œall of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record should be considered; no one factor should be determined dispositiveâ€). \r\nAt the time of trial, Wife was sixty-seven years old and Husband was seventy-five years old.Â  The parties lived together from 1971 until 2002.Â  Their common law marriage came into existence when the couple moved to South Carolina in 1996, and the marriage lasted until the parties divorced nearly eight years later in 2004.Â  Nothing in the record indicated that either party suffered from ill health other than â€œinfirmities of age.â€Â  Husband was a retired veterinarian while Wife only had a high school education.Â  Wife received $415 a month in social security income.Â  Husband admitted he had â€œvastly moreâ€ income and resources than Wife, grossing more than $99,000 in 2002 from social security, retirement accounts, investment income, and $8,000 per month from the Connecticut rental property. \r\nThe parties maintained a high standard of living, living in a large house with no debt.Â  Wife was awarded fifty percent of the marital property, minus amounts she withdrew during the litigation, for a total award of $464,850.Â  In addition to his award of fifty percent of the marital estate, Husband had access to substantial property, including:Â  a gun collection valued at $200,000; rental property in Connecticut; and separate Fidelity accounts valued at $159,000.Â  There was a specific finding by the family court in apportioning the marital property that there was â€œmarital misconduct on the part of [Husband] which the court believes contributed significantly to the breakup of the marriage.â€Â  \r\nAlthough the family court indicated that it considered the appropriate factors in denying Wife alimony, the family court focused primarily on the length of the partiesâ€™ marriage, stating as follows:\r\n\r\nThe court denies [Wifeâ€™s] application for alimony and finds that the duration of the marriage, from 1996 forward, with the final separation of the parties occurring in 2002, to be the conclusive factor.Â  While the court recognizes that the other factors including financial conditions of the parties, needs of the party seeking alimony, respective earning capacities and individual wealth, conduct of the [Husband], ability to pay alimony, and actual income of the parties would militate in favor of [Wife], the court feels these do not outweigh the factor of the duration of the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe court denied Wifeâ€™s argument on reconsideration that the court should have awarded alimony considering the statutory factors and â€œabundant caselaw.â€Â  \r\nWe agree with Wife that the family court abused its discretion in denying alimony.Â  Despite language in the order stating the family court had considered all the statutory factors and they militated in favor of Wife receiving alimony, the entire decision hinged on the length of the marriage.[2]Â  Our courts have not determined that a relatively short marriage is the single determinative factor in denying alimony; alimony has been found proper in some cases where the marriage was of a much shorter duration than that in the present case.Â  See Nienow, 268 S.C. at 172, 232 S.E.2d at 510 (remanding the issue of alimony for the family court to consider permanent periodic alimony to the wife in a fourteen-month marriage in light of â€œwifeâ€™s accustomed standard of living, the disparity between the partiesâ€™ wealth, and their respective earning capacitiesâ€); McDowell v. McDowell, 300 S.C. 96, 100, 386 S.E.2d 468, 470 (Ct. App. 1989) (affirming an award of alimony to the wife in a marriage of less than three years duration, despite the â€œrelatively shortâ€ length of the marriage, after considering the other factors relevant to an alimony award); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 301-03, 372 S.E.2d 107, 114-15 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding the family court erred in not awarding permanent periodic alimony in a fourteen-month marriage where the factors favored alimony).Â  Further, Husbandâ€™s fault led to the breakup of the marriage, and he should not be rewarded in the consideration of alimony based upon the marriageâ€™s length.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 302-03, 372 S.E.2d at 115 (â€œAn at fault spouse cannot destroy a marriage and then claim its short duration entitles him to more favorable consideration when economic adjustments attendant to divorce are made.â€).Â  \r\nConsidering all the factors militating in favor of an award of alimony to Wife, especially the partiesâ€™ standard of living, their relative incomes, and Husbandâ€™s fault in the breakup of the marriage, the family court abused its discretion in only considering the length of the marriage.Â  Wife is entitled to alimony.Â  We remand this matter to the family court for a determination of the proper amount of alimony. \r\n\r\n B. Nonmarital property\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in failing to find that property obtained in Husbandâ€™s name prior to the move to South Carolina was transmuted into marital property. [3] Â  We disagree.\r\nProperty acquired prior to the marriage is generally considered nonmarital.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2004).Â  Nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property.Â  In determining whether property has been transmuted, courts must consider whether the property:Â  (1) â€œbecomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable;â€ (2) is titled jointly; or (3) â€œis utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œTransmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.â€Â  Id.Â  The burden is on the spouse claiming transmutation to produce objective evidence that the parties considered the property to be marital during the marriage.Â  Id.\r\nIn 1958, Husband purchased the property that housed his veterinary clinic, then became the shooting range, and later was leased in 1998 to Widewater for hotel development.Â  Wife did not draw a salary after 1973, and her support was always from Husbandâ€™s income from the clinic and shooting range.Â  Wife testified at the final hearing that she did not have control over the money from the lease of the Connecticut property and that sometimes the money was placed in the partiesâ€™ joint account while it went â€œother placesâ€ at times.Â  Husband testified at the hearing that he used money from the rental property to purchase equipment for the farm.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court determined that any transmutation must have occurred, if at all, after the 1996 date of the common law marriage.Â  Reviewing the evidence, the court determined that Wife failed to meet her burden of proving transmutation of the Fidelity Investment account and the profits of the Connecticut property.Â  \r\nWe agree with the family court.Â  Although money from Husbandâ€™s separate property was used to purchase items for the farm or to benefit the parties, nothing in the record shows Husbandâ€™s intent to transmute the property or that the proceeds from the lease became commingled with marital property.Â  Further, mere use of the income from Husbandâ€™s separate property in support of the marriage does not transmute them into marital property.Â  Peterkin v. Peterkin, 293 S.C. 311, 313, 360 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1987) (noting that Husbandâ€™s separate property inherited or given to him was not transmuted into marital property merely by the use of income derived from this property in furtherance of the marriage).Â  Accordingly, Wife failed to prove transmutation of Husbandâ€™s separate property acquired prior the 1996 marriage.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court did not err in determining the value of the marital home, awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees, and in determining certain property acquired in Husbandâ€™s name prior to the 1996 common law marriage was nonmarital and not transmuted.Â  However, we find the court abused its discretion in considering only the length of the marriage to the exclusion of all of the other statutory factors in denying Wife alimony.Â  We find Wife was entitled to alimony and remand the matter to the family court for a determination of the appropriate amount.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND\r\nREMANDED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Wife also argues the court erred by failing to require security for the payment of support.Â  It does not appear that this issue has been raised below.Â  Thus, it is not preserved for appeal.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge are not preserved for appellate review). Â Â \r\n[2]Â  It appears the family court found the length of the common law marriage was to be measured only by the six years the parties lived together in South Carolina.Â  However, the marriage lasted nearly eight years until the partiesâ€™ divorce was final in 2004.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Wife further argued in her brief that the property obtained while the parties lived in Connecticut should be considered marital property by this court because the parties considered themselves married while they lived there.Â  Wifeâ€™s counsel abandoned this argument at oral argument.Â  We therefore decline to address it.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4114","title":"Martin v.

Wyman, both of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nStephen B. Samuels, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â In this workersâ€™ compensation case, Rapid Plumbing contends the circuit court erred in (1) affirming the appellate panelâ€™s order denying the motion to admit evidence; (2) determining that Ronald Edward Martin was not at maximum medical improvement (MMI); (3) finding Rapid Plumbing improperly terminated temporary total disability benefits; (4) affirming and extending the assessment of penalties; and (5) affirming the commissionâ€™s determination of the authorized treating physician.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMartin was a plumberâ€™s helper who had been employed by Rapid Plumbing for two months when he sustained a back injury while moving a fiberglass bathtub on May 28, 2002.Â  Martin filed for workersâ€™ compensation benefits and Rapid Plumbing began providing medical treatment.Â  Because Martin was unable to work, he was paid temporary total disability compensation starting on June 2, 2002.Â  \r\nMartin visited Doctorâ€™s Care on June 2, 2002. Â An MRI showed bulging discs and an annular tear.Â  He received physical therapy, but after three sessions of physical therapy, he had not improved.Â  Martin returned to Doctorâ€™s Care on July 24, 2002. Â The doctor determined physical therapy should be discontinued and referred Martin to an orthopedic surgeon.Â  On August 7, 2002, Dr. William Felmly, an orthopedic surgeon, saw Martin.Â  Martin complained of numbness, weakness, and leg swelling.Â  Dr. Felmly noted, â€œThe left lower extremity shows a bit of weakness in plantar flexion, a little bit of weakness of EHL, half grade on the peroneal . . . .Â  The patient appears to have increased pain and discomfort on pinch test and rotation.â€Â  Notwithstanding these findings, Dr. Felmly discharged Martin and returned him to full duty work.Â  The return to work statement was faxed to Rapid Plumbing at Martinâ€™s request on August 10, 2002, and Martin returned to work on August 12, 2002.Â Â Â  \r\nOn the day he returned to work, Martin worked with two plumbers installing bathtubs.Â  He worked one full day cutting pipe, going up and down steps, lifting bathtubs, and unloading a truck.Â  By the end of the day, Martin was â€œcrawling around on [his] kneesâ€ and his â€œlegs and back were hurting real bad.â€Â  The next day, Martin advised Rapid Plumbing of his condition and was told to return to Doctorâ€™s Care.Â  When Martin returned to Doctorâ€™s Care, they would not see him and the carrier refused to authorize the visit.Â  At his own expense, Martin saw Dr. Donald Johnson at Carolina Spine Institute on September 11, 2002.Â  Dr. Johnson noted an â€œeasy to seeâ€ annular tear on Martinâ€™s MRI and found his symptoms to be consistent with that injury.Â  Dr. Johnson recommended further treatment, and Martin was taken out of work.\r\nRapid Plumbing terminated Martinâ€™s temporary compensation on August 10, 2002.Â  Rapid Plumbing served a Form 15 on Martinâ€™s attorney sometime between August 28, 2002 and September 9, 2002.Â  The Form 15 alleged compensation had been stopped on August 10, 2002 because â€œclaimant has been released to return to work without restrictions and employment has been offered.â€Â  No supporting documentation was attached.Â  Martinâ€™s attorney signed the Form 15 and requested a hearing to determine whether Rapid Plumbing legally terminated temporary compensation.Â  \r\nA single commissioner heard the case on December 19, 2002.Â  During cross-examination of Martin, defense counsel introduced a surveillance videotape taken around December 10, 2002.Â  The videotape showed Martin unloading wood from a pickup truck and using a log splitter to split the wood into firewood.Â  Notwithstanding the video, the single commissioner issued a decision on February 20, 2003 finding Rapid Plumbing had illegally terminated Martinâ€™s temporary compensation and Martin was not at MMI. Â Rapid Plumbing was ordered to reinstate compensation and pay a 25% penalty to Martin.Â  The commissioner designated Dr. Johnson as the authorized treating physician and ordered Rapid Plumbing to provide additional medical treatment as directed by Dr. Johnson.Â Â Â  \r\nRapid Plumbing appealed to the appellate panel of the workersâ€™ compensation commission.Â  The appellate panel heard the matter, and on October 29, 2003 one of the commissionerâ€™s wrote the parties advising them of the panelâ€™s decision.Â  The commission noted it was affirming, but authorized Rapid Plumbingâ€™s counsel â€œto send Dr. Johnson a letter, with the videotape enclosed, simply stating whether or not, based on his viewing of the videotape, he still believes that the Claimant is not at MMI.â€Â  The letter stated that in the event Dr. Johnson changed his opinion regarding MMI and medical treatment, â€œit would be appropriate for the Defendants to then file a Form 21, Stop Pay.â€Â  \r\nOn February 23, 2004, Dr. Johnson wrote a letter stating, â€œAfter reviewing Mr. Martinâ€™s videotape, I do believe that he is at maximum medical improvement.â€Â  Dr. Johnson opined, â€œI would assign him an eight percent (8%) impairment to the whole person.Â  I would place no particular restrictions on him at this time.â€Â  Rapid Plumbing sought to reopen the record and obtain a reversal based on the Johnson letter.Â  The panel heard arguments and concluded Rapid Plumbing had raised no new issues.Â  On June 10, 2004, the appellate panel issued an order affirming in part and reversing in part the single commissioner.Â  The appellate panel reduced the penalty period to August 10, 2002 through December 19, 2002.Â  Rapid Plumbing appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the appellate panel, but applied the penalty to the period from August 10, 2002 to July 9, 2004â€”the date when Rapid Plumbing resumed payment of temporary total disability.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the workersâ€™ compensation commission.Â  Lark v.

Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 457, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005); Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â Â  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527,Â  593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005).\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â Â  Anderson v.\r\nBaptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 492, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 48, 515 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1999); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â \r\nAccordingly, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions\r\nof fact. Stephen, 324 S.C. at 337, 478 S.E.2d at 76.Â  Instead, review of issues of fact is limited to determining whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 289, 599 S.E.2d at 610-11.Â  â€œOn appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports the findings.â€Â  Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.â€Â  Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Failure to Admit Evidence\r\nRapid Plumbing contends the appellate panel erred in failing to admit what it alleges was newly-discovered evidence, specifically the letter of Dr. Johnson dated February 23, 2004.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRapid Plumbing asseverates the Johnson letter should come in pursuant to 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-707 (1997) which allows for the admission of newly-discovered evidence.Â  The evidence sought to be admitted does not meet the standard for newly-discovered evidence.Â Â  Regulation 67-707 (1997) provides that in order to introduce new evidence into the record on a case on review: \r\n\r\n  C.Â  The moving party must establish that the new evidence is of the same nature and character required for granting a new trial and show: (1) The evidence sought to be introduced is not evidence of a cumulative or impeaching character but would likely have produced a different result had the evidence been procurable at the first hearing; and (2) The evidence was not known to the moving party at the time of the first hearing, by reasonable diligence the new evidence could not have been secured, and the discovery of the new evidence is being brought to the attention of the Commission immediately upon its discovery.\r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-707 (1997)\r\nThe requirements that the evidence must not be known to the party and could not have been secured by reasonable diligence have not been satisfied.Â  The Johnson letter or its equivalent could have been secured at the first hearing by reasonable diligence.Â  Rapid Plumbing had possession of the tape, yet failed to have a doctor review it.Â  Additionally, Rapid Plumbing did not make a motion to adjourn or leave the record open to develop the evidence.Â Â Â  \r\nA conflicting doctorâ€™s report created after a hearing does not mandate a new trial.Â  See Ancrum v. Low Country Steaks, 317 S.C. 188, 193, 452 S.E.2d 609, 612 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting that even if physicianâ€™s reports, indicating that workersâ€™ compensation claimant possibly suffered from a herniated disc, were of same nature and character as that required for granting new trial, claimant failed to establish that, by reasonable diligence, such evidence could not have previously been secured and, thus, claimant was not entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence).Â  Rapid Plumbing could have obtained a letter or testimony from Dr. Johnson regarding MMI and provided the evidence at the initial hearing.Â  Because it failed to do so, Rapid Plumbing cannot now argue it deserves a new trial.Â  The appellate panel merely allowed Rapid Plumbing to develop the record for a future Form 21 hearing by permitting it to communicate directly with Dr. Johnson.Â Â  In no way did the appellate panel state it would allow Rapid Plumbing to admit a letter by Dr. Johnson.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in finding the Johnson letter should not be admitted.Â  \r\nII. MMI\r\nRapid Plumbing argues the circuit court erred in finding Martin was not at MMI, when there was no evidence to support that conclusion.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe appellate panelâ€™s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.Â Â  â€œMaximum medical improvement is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.â€Â  Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp, 319 S.C. 24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Rapid Plumbing contends the circuit court erred in finding Martin was not at MMI because (1) Dr. Felmly returned Martin to work with no restrictions; (2) Martin returned to work on August 12, 2002; and (3) â€œthe record reflects that the Claimant never presented an out of work excuse from any doctor to the employer or any conflicting doctorâ€™s opinions.â€ Â Rapid Plumbing argues this Court should rely on Dr. Felmlyâ€™s reports and Dr. Johnsonâ€™s letter to reverse the appellate panel.Â  \r\nThis Courtâ€™s review is restricted to the evidence considered by the appellate panel in reaching its decision.Â  The Johnson letter was not part of the record before the appellate panel and cannot be used to support Rapid Plumbingâ€™s argument.Â  Although the appellate panel could have conceivably found otherwise based on Dr. Felmlyâ€™s report, it weighed the conflicting opinions of the doctors and gave greater weight to Dr. Johnsonâ€™s report.Â  Any disagreements in the evidence are to be resolved exclusively by the appellate panel.Â  See Tiller v. National Health Care Center of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999) (stating that where there is a conflict in the evidence, either by different witnesses or by the same witness, the appellateÂ  panelâ€™s findings of fact are conclusive).Â  Dr. Johnson noted an â€œeasy to seeâ€ annular tear on Martinâ€™s MRI and found his symptoms to be consistent with that injury.Â  Further treatment was recommended and Martin was taken out of work.Â  Dr. Johnsonâ€™s report, combined with Martinâ€™s testimony, is sufficient evidence to affirm the appellate panelâ€™s findings.Â Â  \r\nIII. Termination of Temporary Total Disability Benefits\r\nRapid Plumbing contends the circuit court erred in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Rapid Plumbing was barred from stopping payment of temporary total disability benefits on the grounds of a perceived deficiency in the Form 15.Â Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe reason given on the Form 15 for the termination was because â€œClaimant has returned to work without restrictions and employment has been offered.â€Â  However, the statute is explicit that even under a Form 15, an employer can only terminate or suspend temporary compensation if one of the specified conditions is met.Â  The applicable condition in this case allows termination or suspension if â€œthe employee has returned to work; however, if the employee does not remain at work for a minimum of fifteen days, temporary disability payments must be resumed immediately[.]â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260(B)(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  Because Martin did not remain at work for fifteen days, Rapid Plumbing was required to resume payments immediately after he left work on August 13, 2002.Â  \r\nThe rationale given by Rapid Plumbing is only applicable when suitable employment is offered but not accepted.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-190 (1985) (â€œIf an injured employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity and approved by the Commission he shall not be entitled to any compensation at any time during the continuance of such refusal.â€).Â  Thus, had Martin refused to return to work, Rapid Plumbing would have had legal justification to terminate his temporary compensation.Â  Because Martin willingly returned to work, but was unable to continue work after one day, the reason given by Rapid Plumbing did not apply.Â  \r\nEven if Rapid Plumbing could have stopped temporary total disability benefits, it failed to follow the proper procedure for doing so as outlined by section 42-9-260 and regulation 67-504.Â  Rapid Plumbing terminated the compensation on August 10, 2002, but failed to file and serve the Form 15 until at least August 28, 2002, and failed to attach the supporting documentation as required by section 42-9-260.Â  These deficiencies are not mere technicalities, but are substantial deviations from the statutory procedure.Â Â  The circuit court was correct in finding Rapid Plumbing wrongfully terminated temporary benefits.Â  \r\nIV. Penalty Period\r\nThe appellate panel affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s imposition of a 25% penalty on Rapid Plumbing on the overdue payments for temporary total disability benefits.Â  However, the single commissioner set the time for assessment of the penalty starting August 10, 2002 and continuing until Rapid Plumbing resumed paying the benefitsâ€”a time which had yet to occur.Â  The appellate panel reversed the commissioner in this aspect by limiting the penalty period to August 10, 2002 through December 19, 2002, the date of the hearing before the single commissioner.Â  The circuit court set the penalty period as August 10, 2002 through July 9, 2004â€”the date when Rapid Plumbing resumed payment of benefits.Â  Rapid Plumbing contends the court erred in increasing the penalty period.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 42-9-260(G) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) requires employers to pay temporary total disability to an employee who has â€œbeen out of work due to a reported work related injuryâ€ for eight days.Â  The penalty language of section 42-9-260 provides:\r\n\r\n(G)Â  Failure to comply with this section shall result in a twenty-five percent penalty imposed upon the carrier or employer computed on the amount of benefits withheld in violation of this section, and the amount of the penalty must be paid to the employee in addition to the amount of benefits withheld. Â However, the penalty does not apply if the employer or carrier has terminated or suspended benefits when the employee has returned to any employment at the same or similar wage.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nThe language of section 42-9-260(G) is mandatory.Â  The statute sets the time of the penalty as beginning with the failure to comply with section 42-9-260 and continuing for as long as the benefits are wrongfully withheld.Â  The appellate panel did not have discretion to limit the duration of the penalty to a time other than the date when payment of benefits was resumed.Â  By the time the circuit court heard the case, the statutory penalty period had ended as Rapid Plumbing had resumed paying benefits to Martin.Â  Therefore, the circuit court correctly set the penalty period as beginning on August 10, 2002 and continuing through the date Rapid Pluming resumed payments to Martinâ€”i.e., July 9, 2004.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Rapid Plumbing complains of the compensation rate upon which the penalty was assessed.Â  However, Rapid Plumbing simply states the compensation rate should have been lower and fails to make an argument explaining its position.Â  â€œConclusory arguments constitute an abandonment of the issue on appeal.â€Â \r\nCivil Action No.: 2001-CP-32-0711 Carolina Water Serv., Inc. v. Lexington County Joint Mun. Water and Sewer Commâ€™n, 367 S.C. 141, 149, 625 S.E.2d 227, 231 (Ct. App. 2006); see also Houck v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 17 n.5, 620 S.E.2d 326, 332 n.5 (2005) (noting an issue is abandoned if the appellantâ€™s brief treats it in a conclusory manner).Â  The single commissioner made the finding that the rate should be $230.12, and absent an argument as to why that calculation is wrong, we cannot reverse.Â  \r\nV. Authorized Treating Physician\r\nRapid Plumbing argues the circuit court erred in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s order that Dr. Johnson be the authorized treating physician.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs a preliminary matter, this issue has not been preserved for our review.Â  Rapid Plumbing failed to object and have the issue ruled on by the circuit court and did not file a timely motion for reconsideration.Â  See Talley v. S.C. Higher Ed. Tuition Grants Committee, 289 S.C. 483, 487, 347 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1986) (stating an issue raised in trial court but not ruled on by the trial court is not preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nEven had this issue been preserved for our review, it fails on the merits.Â  Regulation 67-509 states that while a claimant is receiving temporary compensation benefits, â€œ[t]he employerâ€™s representative chooses an authorized health care provider and pays for authorized treatment.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-509(A) (1990). However, section 42-15-60 of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act\r\nprovides: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Medical . . . treatment . . . shall be provided by the employer. In case of a controversy arising between employer and employee, the Commission may order such further medical, surgical, hospital or other treatment as may in the discretion of the Commission be necessary. . . . [T]he employer may, at his own option, continue to furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the employee, and the employee shall accept an attending physician, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. . . .Â  The refusal of an employee to accept any medical, hospital, surgical or other treatment when provided by the employer or ordered by the Commission shall bar such employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases and no compensation shall at any time be paid for the period of suspension unless in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances justified the refusal, in which case the Commission may order a change in the medical or hospital service.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985); See also Grattis v. Murells Inlet VFW #10420, 353 S.C. 100, 113-14, 576 S.E.2d 191, 197-98 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that where it deems it necessary, the appellateÂ  panel may override an employerâ€™s choice of medical provider and may excuse a workersâ€™ compensation claimantâ€™s justified refusal to seek treatment from employerâ€™s provider, in these circumstances, the appellateÂ  panel may order a change in the medical or hospital service provided by employer to the claimant).Â Â Â  \r\nThe appellate panel is afforded discretion to order medical treatment under section 42-15-60 when a controversy such as the one in the instant case arises.Â  The designation of Dr. Johnson was consistent with the factual finding that additional treatment would lessen Martinâ€™s disability.Â  The refusal by Doctorâ€™s Care to see Martin and Dr. Johnsonâ€™s subsequent diagnosis created the controversy contemplated by the statute.Â  This is not a case where an employee is refusing treatment offered by an employer.Â  Rather, this is a situation where the employee feels he still needs treatment and the employer fails to provide it.Â  The appellate panel acted within its discretion and the circuit court was correct in affirming the order confirming Dr. Johnson as the authorized treating physician.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4115","title":"Smith v.

(2) Smithâ€™s physical injury to his back arose out of and in the course of employment with NCCI; (3) Smithâ€™s injuries were aggravated by his employment with NCCI; (4) Smith was entitled to disability benefits beginning March 19, 1999; (5) NCCI was not entitled to credit for short- and long-term disability benefits received by Smith; and (6) Smithâ€™s claim was not barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn April 1991, Smith began working with NCCI as a supervisor for the Test Audit Department of NCCIâ€™s Atlantic Division.Â  Before working with NCCI, Smith worked as auditor with two other companies for a total of thirteen years.Â  Smith commuted from Tampa to Boca Raton during his time as a supervisor.Â  In 1993, Smith voluntarily stepped down from his supervisor position and became a senior auditor in Tampa.\r\nAs an auditor in Florida, Smith conducted test audits of insurance policies from both the voluntary market and the assigned risk market.Â  A test audit is a process in which an insurance companyâ€™s audits are checked to determine whether the premiums being charged are sufficient for the coverage being provided.Â  Smith primarily worked in the area around Tampa and generally worked between forty and fifty hours a week.Â  Smith usually met NCCIâ€™s weekly production requirements of nine audits.Â  During this time, NCCI recognized Smith as one of its best test auditors in Tampa.Â  In fact, Smith received a couple of awards in recognition of his production and work quality.\r\nAt some point, NCCI made various operational changes.Â  First, NCCI changed its fee structure.Â  NCCI changed from an assessment-based system, wherein NCCI would simply assess the insurance companies for all of the services the company requested and the various insurance commissions required, to a fee-for-services-based system, wherein NCCI charged an individual fee for the services performed.Â  In addition, NCCI had a change in management.Â  The new management heavily focused on production and meeting production goals.Â  As part of the change in management, NCCI placed a new vice-president, Steve Axleray, in charge of its auditing divisions.Â  In the summer of 1995, Axleray met with NCCIâ€™s auditors, chastised them for their lack of production, and informed them the new management expected increased production.Â  Axleray informed the auditors that a voluntary severance package could be taken by anyone that did not wish to continue working with the newly-structured NCCI.\r\nIn June 1995, shortly after NCCIâ€™s operational changes went into effect, NCCI asked Smith to move to South Carolina and continue working as a test auditor.Â  Smith had extensive knowledge of the South Carolina Test Audit Program because he authored the program.Â  Based on this knowledge and his understanding that the program focused on quality audits as opposed to production, Smith decided to stay with NCCI and turn down the severance package.Â  Smith replaced NCCIâ€™s sole auditor in South Carolina, Elizabeth Crosby, whom he had hired to start the program.\r\nThe South Carolina test audit program was unique.Â  The program focused specifically on the assigned risk market.Â  Test audits on the assigned risk market are generally more time consuming and difficult than audits on the voluntary market.Â  The assigned risk market, unlike the voluntary market, typically consists of smaller and newer companies that have disorganized or incomplete records.Â  In addition, companies in the assigned risk market are usually in hard-to-find locations.\r\nWhen Smith arrived in South Carolina, his job as a test auditor was very different from both his Florida job and from what he had envisioned and designed.Â  First, Smithâ€™s work was dispersed across the entire state and consisted of very few local assignments.Â  As a result, Smith was consistently driving six hundred miles or greater every week even though the job description called for driving only two to three hundred miles per week.Â  Second, despite the programâ€™s design, Smith discovered NCCI management was more concerned with the quantity of the audits conducted than quality of the audits.Â  Throughout Smithâ€™s time in South Carolina, NCCI constantly pressured Smith about meeting production goals.Â  Third, although the job description provided for a forty-hour work week, Smith routinely worked over seventy hours per week and habitually worked on weekends.Â  Further, Smith regularly stayed in hotels two to four nights a week when the job description provided that overnight stays should average one to two nights per week.\r\nIn October 1995 Smith took medical leave from work.Â  Smith testified he took leave because the demands of the South Carolina job were â€œjust nothing close to what [Smith] was told it was going to be.â€Â  During this period, Smith was treated by Dr. Roger Deal.Â  Dealâ€™s records indicate Smith had been demonstrating symptoms of depression, bi-polar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in the year preceding July 1995, and Smith was still dealing with OCD and depression at the time of their initial visit. Â Dealâ€™s notes indicate Smith was taking assorted prescription drugs when they first met.Â  Deal prescribed various medicines to assist Smith in his recovery.Â  In March 1996, Smith was able to return to work.\r\nIn February 1999, NCCI changed Smithâ€™s company car from a full-size Ford Taurus to a smaller, subcompact Saturn.Â  Smith began complaining of back pains immediately thereafter.Â  Within a couple of months NCCI provided Smith with a raise to allow him to purchase a new, bigger car.\r\nSmith visited Dr. Eleanay Ogburu-Ognonnaya for treatment of his back pain in March 1999.Â  Ogburu-Ognonnayaâ€™s records from March 1999 indicate Smith specifically noted his new company car had no lumbar support, was very uncomfortable, and limited leg movement.Â  Smith averred Ogburu-Ognonnaya advised him to reduce his driving and that the kind of driving required for Smithâ€™s work would make Smithâ€™s back worse.\r\nIn May 1999, Smith took leave from work and filed for short-term disability benefits.Â  In his request for short-term disability, Smith stated his last day of work was May 26, 1999.Â  Smith noted the symptoms that led him to cease working were (1) excessive stress and fatigue, which he listed as an illness, and (2) an injury to his lower back.Â  Smith provided March 8, 1999 as the date of onset of the symptoms for excessive fatigue, and the week of February 15-19, 1999 as the first onset of symptoms for the back injury.\r\nOn June 1, 2000, Smith filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim alleging injuries to the â€œback, legs, psychological/whole personâ€ culminating on May 27, 1999.Â  Hearings were conducted in this matter on August 23, 2001; February 28, 2002; and March 11, 2002.Â  NCCI alleges Smith withdrew his original claim after NCCI filed a Form 51 and filed another claim raising the same allegations on November 11, 2000, which was again withdrawn without prejudice by consent on March 13, 2001.Â  NCCI asserts Smith refiled his claim on March 19, 2001, making identical assertions.Â  The record evidences neither Smithâ€™s withdrawal of the original claim nor the filing of subsequent claims.Â  Nevertheless, whether Smith filed in June 2000 or in March 2001 is irrelevant because the allegations and issues are the same.\r\nThe hearing commissioner found Smith suffered a compensable mental or psychological injury due to unusual and extraordinary conditions of his employment.Â  The commissioner further found Smith sustained a compensable back injury as a result of his work activity requiring Smith to drive extremely long distances in a subcompact vehicle.Â  The commissioner awarded Smith temporary total disability compensation benefits and medical benefits.Â  The commissioner denied NCCI credit for short- and long-term disability benefits paid to Smith.\r\nNCCI appealed the commissionerâ€™s decision to the appellate panel.Â  The appellate panel determined that all of the commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of law were correct and adopted the commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.Â  NCCI appealed to the circuit court, and the circuit court affirmed the appellate panel.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.â€Â  Clark v. Aiken County Govâ€™t, 366 S.C. 102, 107, 620 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (2005) establishes the substantial evidence rule as the standard of review.Â  See also Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 133, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) and (e) (2005).\r\nâ€œOn appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workers Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports its findings.â€Â \r\nPeoples v. Henry Co., 364 S.C. 123, 127, 611 S.E.2d 527, 528-29 (Ct. App. 2005); see also \r\nFrame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 528, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIt is not within our province to reverse\r\nfindings of the Commission which are supported by substantial evidence.â€).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.â€Â \r\nBaggott v. S. Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 5, 496 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998).Â  â€œQuantitatively, substantial evidence is something less than the weight of the evidence.â€Â \r\nHowell v. Pac. Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).Â  â€œThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the commissionâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â \r\nSellers v.

Preservation\r\nInitially, Smith argues each of NCCIâ€™s issues are not preserved for review. Â When a trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument raised, and the appellant makes no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to obtain a ruling, the appellate court may not address the issue.Â  Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).\r\nThe circuit court considered all of the issues raised and affirmed the appellate panelâ€™s order.Â  NCCIâ€™s Notice of Intent to Appeal to Circuit Court specifically raises each of the issues presented for appeal to this Court.Â  Accordingly, we find each of the issues presented for appeal was properly preserved for our review.\r\nII. Mental Injury\r\nNCCI contends the appellate panel erred in finding Smith suffered a compensable mental injury under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because Smithâ€™s employment conditions were not extraordinary and unusual and did not cause Smithâ€™s mental injury.Â  We disagree.\r\nA compensable injury under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is defined by section 42-1-160, which states:\r\n\r\nâ€œInjuryâ€ and â€œpersonal injuryâ€ shall mean only injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment . . .\r\n\r\n  Stress arising out of and in the course of employment unaccompanied by physical injury and resulting in mental illness or injury is not a personal injury\r\nunless it is established that the stressful employment conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the normal conditions of the employment.\r\n\r\n  Stress arising out of and in the course of employment unaccompanied by physical injury is not considered compensable if it results from any event or series of events which is incidental to normal employer/employee relations including, but not limited to, personnel actions by the employer such as disciplinary actions, work evaluations, transfers, promotions, demotions, salary reviews, or terminations, except when these actions are taken in an extraordinary and unusual manner.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).\r\nIn order to recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits for a mental injury, the claimant must prove both: (1) that he was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in his employment; and (2) that these unusual and extraordinary conditions were the proximate cause of his mental breakdown.Â \r\nDoe v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Disabilities and Special Needs, 364 S.C. 411, 418, 613 S.E.2d 785, 789 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The requirement of â€œunusual or extraordinary conditions in employmentâ€ refers to conditions to the particular job in which the injury occurs, not to conditions of employment in general. Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 457, 535 S.E.2d 438, 443 (2000).\r\nAs the finder of fact, the appellate panel found the conditions of Smithâ€™s employment were extraordinary and unusual for a test auditor.Â  The panel specifically found the unique requirements of conducting the South Carolina test audit program made the application of the general standards for a test auditor â€œunattainable, unreasonable, and unusual.â€Â  The appellate panel further found NCCIâ€™s unreasonable expectations and production goals, the continual and unrelenting criticism and pressure to meet these unattainable production goals, and Smithâ€™s extremely long work hours all contributed to cause Smithâ€™s mental injury.\r\nA. Extraordinary and Unusual Conditions\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record to support the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Smith, as a test auditor in South Carolina, was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in his employment.\r\nFirst, experts in the auditing industry opined that Smithâ€™s employment conditions were extraordinary and unusual.\r\nSecond, Smith worked in the South Carolina test audit program, a unique program that focused specifically on the assigned risk market.Â  As a result, meeting production goals in South Carolina was more difficult than meeting production goals in other states that tested both the assigned risk market and the voluntary market.\r\nThird, Smith was unlike other auditors with NCCI in that he mainly conducted test audits.Â  NCCI guidelines allowed test auditors to conduct some variation of inspections to help satisfy the production requirement of nine test audits per week.Â  Bowles, a test auditor with NCCI in South Carolina from 1995 through 1999, testified his job involved conducting test audits and less time consuming inspections while Smith focused â€œjust about 100% on the test audits.â€\r\nFourth, Smithâ€™s employment conditions in South Carolina were unusual because his assignments were dispersed throughout South Carolina and required significant amounts of driving.Â  Smith testified he typically drove in excess of six hundred miles per week despite the job description calling for only two to three hundred miles per week.Â  Other NCCI test auditors averaged well below six hundred miles of driving per week.\r\nFinally, NCCI constantly and continuously harassed Smith about production. Â Smith testified he received a â€œsteady flowâ€ of memos, â€œat times every day,â€ informing him NCCI needed more production.Â  While the record indicates NCCI pressured all of its auditors, the pressure on Smith was exacerbated because the constant demands were being made despite Smithâ€™s unique situation.Â  In addition, the testimony provides that other companies did not pressure auditors to the extent NCCI did.Â  The pressure imposed on Smith was not â€œincidental to normal employer/employee relationsâ€ because of the constant and continuous nature of the demands and because of Smithâ€™s unique position.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).\r\nSubstantial evidence in the record supports a finding that Smithâ€™s employment conditions were extraordinary and unusual.\r\nB. Cause of Mental Injury\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record supporting the appellate panelâ€™s finding that the extraordinary and unusual conditions of Smithâ€™s employment caused his mental injury.\r\nFirst, doctorsâ€™ opinions and records indicate Smithâ€™s condition was linked to stress from his job.Â  Dr. Franklin J. Klohn, Jr., in an answer to an interrogatory, opined that Smithâ€™s psychological condition was most probably caused by the stressors of his job.Â  In late February 1999, Smith visited Dr. Rex Rawls and complained of â€œChronic fatigue syndrome, worsening over the last eight years.â€Â  Rawls provided Smith with a note stating that he may need a week off to try to recover from the excessive fatigue.Â  Rawlsâ€™ notes from a visit in May 1999 provide that Smith was requesting disability â€œso he wonâ€™t have to continue with his high stress job.â€\r\nSecond, Smithâ€™s testimony and actions lend further support to the finding that Smithâ€™s employment conditions caused his mental injury.Â  Smith testified that he took medical leave from work from October 1995 through March 1996 because the demands of the South Carolina job were â€œjust nothing close to what [Smith] was told it was going to be.â€Â  Further, when Smith filed for short-term disability in May 1999 he cited excessive stress and fatigue as one of the reasons for the request and listed March 8, 1999 as the date of the onset of the symptoms.\r\nThird, another auditor, Chris Bowles, testified he developed health problems as a result of the stresses accompanied by working with NCCI.Â  Specifically, Bowles testified he was diagnosed with Barrettâ€™s esophagus (a pre-cancerous condition) and ulcers of the esophagus, which he attributed to the employment conditions with NCCI.\r\nThe record provides substantial evidence to support a finding that NCCIâ€™s employment conditions caused Smithâ€™s injury.\r\nAdmittedly, the record indicates Smith had numerous non-employment stressors that may have contributed to or caused his mental injury.Â  The record provides that during the course of Smithâ€™s employment (1) he had trouble selling his home; (2) he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and depression prior to moving to South Carolina; (3) he was involved in a lawsuit regarding the construction of his South Carolina home; (4) he received a couple of speeding tickets; (5) his daughter had numerous medical problems; (6) he was involved in a lawsuit stemming from a 1995 motor vehicle accident; and (7) he had various medical problems including an esophagus problem and two angioplasty surgeries or treatments.Â  However, â€œ[t]he findings of the agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.â€ Â Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995).Â  Moreover, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338-39, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).Â  Thus, because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of the appellate panel, the contrary evidence is inconsequential.\r\nC. Proximate Cause\r\nNCCI next asserts the appellate panelâ€™s order failed to address the issue of proximate cause of Smithâ€™s mental injury, and therefore, this Court should remand the case and allow the appellate panel the opportunity to make a finding of cause.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 1-23-350 (2005) provides, in relevant part, that â€œ[i]f . . . a party submitted proposed findings of fact, [an agency] decision shall include a ruling upon each proposed finding.â€Â  The findings of fact made by the appellate panel must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the evidence supports the findings.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 531, 593 S.E.2d 491, 497 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When an administrative agency acts without first making the proper factual findings required by law, the proper procedure is to remand the case and allow the agency the opportunity to make those findings. Fox v. Newberry County Memâ€™l Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 282, 461 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1995).\r\nThe appellate panel made sufficient findings of fact regarding the proximate cause of Smithâ€™s mental injury.Â  The appellate panel adopted the commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.Â  The commissionerâ€™s order specifically states:\r\n\r\n[Smithâ€™s] psychological condition was as a result of unusual and/or extraordinary conditions in [Smithâ€™s] employment specifically unreasonable expectations and production goals from his employer, continual and unrelenting stress on [Smith] including criticism and pressure to meet those unattainable goals and extremely long hours in excess of 70 hours per week put in by [Smith] in an effort to try to reach those goals.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the appellate panelâ€™s findings of fact are sufficiently detailed regarding the proximate cause of Smithâ€™s mental injury.\r\nIII. Physical Injury\r\nNCCI alleges the appellate panel erred in finding Smith suffered a compensable injury to his back.Â  Specifically, NCCI argues the appellate panel committed error in disregarding the report of ergonomist Elizabeth Neal Miall and in finding Smithâ€™s excessive driving led to his injury because he had been driving long distances for years.Â  We disagree.\r\nFor an injury to be compensable, it must arise out of and in the course of employment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œThe phrase â€˜arising out ofâ€™ refers to the origin of the cause of the accident.â€Â \r\nClade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 10, 496 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998).Â  â€œâ€˜An injury arises out of employment when there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal relationship between the conditions under which the work is to be performed and the resulting injury.â€™â€Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 518, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996) (quoting Owings v. Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 315 S.C. 297, 299, 433 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1993)).\r\nâ€œThe claimant has the burden of proving facts that will bring the injury within the workersâ€™ compensation law, and such award must not be based on surmise, conjecture or speculation.â€\r\nClade, 330 S.C. at 11, 496 S.E.2d at 857.Â  However, injured employees are not required to prove their injuries were caused by specific events in order to recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Id. at 12, 496 S.E.2d at 858.\r\nThe appellate panel found Smithâ€™s back injury arose out of and in the course of his employment with NCCI.Â  There is substantial evidence in the record to support this finding.Â  First, Smith complained of neck and lower back pain immediately after receiving the smaller company car.Â  Smith testified that his back began hurting him the very first day he drove the subcompact Saturn.Â  Smith further professed his doctor instructed him to take time off from work because the extensive driving required by Smithâ€™s job made his back injury worse.Â  In addition, the record provides that in June 1999, Dr. Donald Johnson, with the Carolina Spine Institute, opined Smith â€œneeds to be out of the work placeâ€ because driving exacerbates Smithâ€™s lower back pain.Â  Further, Dr. Ogburu-Ognonnayaâ€™s records indicate that in March 1999, Smith specifically noted his new company car had no lumbar support, was very uncomfortable, and limited his leg movement.Â  Finally, a memo from Bailey to NCCI indicates Bailey experienced similar discomforts with the smaller company car.\r\nThe record contains evidence suggesting Smithâ€™s back injury may not have been caused by his employment conditions.Â  In 1995 Smithâ€™s back and neck were injured in a car accident, and, over the years, Smith sometimes informed various doctors of minor back pains and persistent headaches.Â  NCCI presented an ergonomic analysis from Miall stating there were no appreciable differences between the ride, suspension, and measurements of the two cars, and â€œyou could determine [Smithâ€™s] back pain was not caused by the use of the Saturn SL 2.â€Â  However, when a conflict in the evidence exists, the findings of fact of the administrative agency are conclusive.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338-39, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).Â  The final\r\ndetermination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the appellate panel. Â Cf. \r\nRoss v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989).\r\nBecause there is substantial evidence in the record to support the appellate panelâ€™s findings, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision.\r\nIV. Aggravation of Injuries\r\nNCCI next argues the appellate panel did not make sufficient findings of fact to support its ruling that Smithâ€™s employment conditions aggravated Smithâ€™s mental and physical injuries.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe right of a claimant to compensation for aggravation of a pre-existing condition arises only where there is a dormant condition which has produced no disability but which becomes disabling by reason of the aggravating injury.â€Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 SC 487, 493, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001).Â  â€œAggravation of pre-existing psychiatric problems is compensable if that aggravation is caused by a work-related physical injury.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe appellate panelâ€™s ruling on this issue is insufficient.Â  The findings of fact made by the appellate panel must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the evidence supports the findings. Â Cf. Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 531, 593 S.E.2d 491, 497 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When an administrative agency acts without first making the proper factual findings required by law, the proper procedure is to remand the case and allow the agency the opportunity to make those findings.Â  Fox v. Newberry County Memâ€™l Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 282, 461 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1995).Â  The appellant panelâ€™s order makes no specific finding that Smithâ€™s injuries were aggravated by his employment conditions; the only reference to the aggravation of a pre-existing condition is that one of the cases that specifically controls this case is Anderson, 343 SC 487, 541 S.E.2d 526.Â  The appellate panelâ€™s order is not sufficiently detailed to enable a review by this Court; nevertheless, because we affirm on other grounds we do not need to remand for a proper finding of fact on this issue.\r\nV. Payment of Benefits\r\nNCCI asserts the appellate panel erred in awarding disability benefits and medical treatment beginning on March 19, 1999, prior to the date of the alleged accident and disability.Â  We disagree.\r\nSections 42-9-200 and -230 of the South Carolina Code Annotated (1985 and Supp. 2005) provide that compensation for disability shall be allowed from the date of disability.Â  Section 42-15-60 states that medical benefits shall be provided â€œfor a period not exceeding ten weeks from the date of injury . . . and for such additional time as in the judgment of the Commission will tend to lessen the period of disability[.]â€Â  Essentially, workersâ€™ compensation benefits accrue along a time continuum: temporary total disability benefits are available from the date\r\nof injury through the date of maximum medical improvement (MMI) and post-MMI benefits may be awarded either as a permanent total or partial disability, or as a percentage of impairment to a scheduled member.Â \r\nHendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 414 n.2, 517 S.E.2d 698, 703 n.2 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe record indicates Smithâ€™s injury began prior to the date the commission awarded medical benefits.Â  When Smith filed for short-term disability, he listed March 8, 1999 as the date of onset of the symptoms for excessive fatigue and the week of February 15-19, 1999 as the first onset of symptoms for the back injury.Â  Thus, the circuit court did not err in affirming the award of medical benefits commencing March 19, 1999.\r\nVI. Credit\r\nNCCI next contends the appellate panel erred in finding NCCI is not entitled to a credit for payment of short- and long-term disability benefits received by Smith.Â  Specifically, NCCI asserts it is entitled to a credit for benefits paid because Smith received short-term disability benefits from October 1995 through March 1996 and was awarded long-term disability benefits prior to May 27, 1999, the date Smithâ€™s injury admittedly culminated.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially we note this issue may not be preserved for our review.Â  Only issues raised and ruled upon by the commission are cognizable on appeal. See e.g., TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Rev., 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998).Â  The appellate panelâ€™s order does not specifically address this issue.\r\nAlthough we find preservation tenuous at best, we nevertheless proceed to the merits.Â  Section 42-9-210 provides:\r\n\r\nAny payments made by an employer to an injured employee during the period of his disability, or to his dependents, which by the terms of this Title were not due and payable when made may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation; provided, that in the case of disability such deductions shall be made by shortening the period during which compensation must be paid and not by reducing the amount of the weekly payment.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-210 (1985).Â  â€œIn order for payments to be deductible, they must have been made with reference to liability under the provisions of the Act and intended to be in lieu of compensation.â€Â \r\nMuir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 298, 519 S.E.2d 583, 599 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe record is devoid of evidence suggesting any short-term or long-term disability benefits received by Smith were made with reference to liability under the Act and in lieu of compensation.Â  Accordingly, we find the appellate panel did not err in finding that NCCI is not entitled to a credit for any short-term or long-term benefits paid to Smith.\r\nVII. Statute of Limitations\r\nFinally, NCCI alleges Smithâ€™s claim is barred by the statute of limitations prescribed in section 42-15-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  We find this argument manifestly without merit.\r\nSection 42-15-40 provides â€œ[t]he right to compensation . . . is barred unless a claim is filed with the commission within two years after an accident[.]â€Â  Smithâ€™s mental and physical injury culminated in disability on May 27, 1999.Â  Smith filed his original Form 50 to initiate this claim on June 1, 2000.Â  Accordingly, we find Smithâ€™s claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Even if Smith filed on March 19, 2001, as asserted by NCCI, his claim still falls inside the two-year statute of limitations.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude substantial evidence in the record supports the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Smith suffered a mental injury caused by unusual and extraordinary employment conditions with NCCI, and that Smith suffered a physical injury to his back arising out of and in the course of his employment with NCCI.Â  The appellate panel did not err in awarding benefits commencing March 19, 1999, and in denying NCCI a credit for benefits received by Smith.Â  We hold Smithâ€™s claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â Â  We reverse because the trial court failed to adhere to the mandated process for the handling of a Batson motion, and the jury that convicted Appellants was comprised of jurors whom the trial court erroneously prohibited Appellants from striking. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn the typical appeal from the granting or denial of a Batson motion, the appellate courts give deference to the findings of the trial court and apply a clearly erroneous standard.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001). Â This standard of review, however, is premised on the trial court following the mandated procedure for a Batson hearing.Â  Here, where the assignment of error is the failure to follow the Batson hearing procedure, we must answer a question of law.Â  When a question of law is presented, our standard of review is plenary.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (Supp. 2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2005) (Supreme Court and Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to correct errors of law). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nWe begin our discussion mindful of the difficult task our trial judges encounter in evaluating the propriety of the wide-ranging reasons given for the exercise of peremptory challenges.Â  At the appellate level, we view issues like a Batson challenge through the lens of hindsight, and from that perspective, we must remain sensitive to the vagaries and burdens facing trial judges.Â  Accordingly, we are not easily persuaded to second-guess a trial courtâ€™s discretionary calls.Â  By design, the clearly erroneous standard of review (applicable in the typical Batson appellate setting) follows suit by placing constraints on the appellate court.Â  The reversal here comes not from second-guessing, but as a result of a legal error in not adhering to the mandated Batson procedure, specifically the failure to require the opponent of the strike to prove purposeful discrimination.Â  Even so, we recognize the experienced and able trial judge was presented with a problematic Batson motion.Â  We now proceed to the case at hand.\r\n II. \r\nDuring jury selection, Appellants, who are black, exercised ten of their twenty peremptory challenges, striking two black women, three white men, and five white women.[2]Â  The State opposed Appellantsâ€™ strikes and requested a Batson hearing.Â  \r\nIn Batson, the Supreme Court held the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the prosecution from striking potential jurors on the basis of race.Â  476 U.S. at 89.Â  In Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 59 (1992), the Supreme Court expanded Batson, holding â€œthe Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the ground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges.â€Â  Thus, during jury selection, either the defendant or the State may oppose the peremptory challenge of a juror who is a member of a cognizable racial group.[3]Â  Once a peremptory challenge is opposed, the trial court must, upon request, conduct a Batson hearing and adhere to the procedures set forth in Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767 (1995), and adopted by our supreme court in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 124, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996).\r\nIn Purkett, the Supreme Court announced:\r\n\r\nUnder our Batson jurisprudence, once the opponent of a peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race-neutral explanation (step two).Â  If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination. \r\n\r\n514 U.S. at 767.Â  The Supreme Court observed â€œ[t]he second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible.â€Â  Id. at 767-68.Â  At step two, therefore, the proponent of the strike does not carry â€œany burden of presenting reasonably specific, legitimate explanations for the strikes.â€Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 123, 470 S.E.2d at 371.Â  Therefore, â€œ[u]nless a discriminatory intent is inherentâ€ in the explanation provided by the proponent of the strike, â€œthe reason offered will be deemed race neutralâ€ and the trial court must proceed to the third step of the Batson process.Â  Purkett, 514 U.S. at 768; see e.g., Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 56, 495 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1998) (striking a juror because she was a â€œredneckâ€ evinces a discriminatory intent and is therefore not facially race-neutral).Â  \r\nAt step three, the opponent of the strike must show the reason offered, though facially race-neutral, was actually mere pretext to engage in purposeful racial discrimination.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372.Â  The opponent of the strike carries â€œthe ultimate burden of showing purposeful discriminationâ€ and must demonstrate the pretextual nature of the stated reason for the strike.Â  Id. This burden is generally established by showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury.Â  Id. at 123, 470 S.E.2d at 371.\r\nAs our case law illustrates, unless the discriminatory intent is inherent in a fundamentally implausible explanation, the opponent of the strike must make a bona fide showing that the proponent of the strike seated a juror who shared nearly every quality with the struck juror other than race to establish pretext.Â  When the opponent of the strike proves the proponent of the strike practiced purposeful racial discrimination, the trial court must quash the entire jury panel and initiate another jury selection de novo.Â  See State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 58, 358 S.E.2d 701, 704 (1987), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 306, 454 S.E.2d 317, 320 (1995); see also State v. Heyward, 357 S.C. 577, 580, 594 S.E.2d 168, 169 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n III.Â  \r\nWe now turn to the first jury selection and ensuing Batson motion.Â  Initially, we note the first jury was diverse.Â  It was comprised of one white woman, three black men, four white men, and four black women.Â  Thus, the composition of the first jury does not indicate Appellants engaged in purposeful racial discrimination.Â  See State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 621, 545 S.E.2d 805, 813 (2001) (â€œ[T]he composition of the jury panel is a factor that may be considered when determining whether a party engaged in purposeful discrimination pursuant to a Batson challenge.â€).Â  \r\nAdditionally, we disagree with the Stateâ€™s argument that Appellants embarked on a â€œpatternâ€ of striking jurors because of their race.Â  Appellants did not use their peremptory challenges solely on jurors from a single racial group.Â  They selected a white male as their first juror, and first struck a black female.Â  Further, although Appellants ultimately struck five white women, they also struck two black women, and seated one white woman and four white men.Â  See State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 66, 512 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1999) (â€œAlthough appellant exercised most of his strikes against white jurors, he did not strike every white juror. . . .Â  [T]he fact that appellant used most of his challenges to strike white jurors is not sufficient, in itself, to establish purposeful discrimination.â€).Â  Appellants used only ten of their twenty allotted peremptory challenges.Â  If they intended to discriminate against white jurors, they certainly would have exercised their peremptory challenges more liberally.Â  Instead, Appellants seated five white jurors.\r\nDespite the diversity of the first jury and the fact that Appellants did not appear to engage in a pattern of purposeful racial discrimination, the State opposed Appellantsâ€™ strikes and requested a Batson hearing.Â  We now examine the first Batson hearing, which in our view demonstrates the trial courtâ€™s failure to follow the mandated Batson procedure.Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel first explained that he struck Juror 87, a black woman, because she gave an indignant and outraged expression.Â  The record reveals that the State had no interest in challenging the striking of black jurors, and the matter was not pursued.Â  Â Â \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel next explained that he struck Juror 63, a white woman, because she shared the last name of a local Deputy Sheriff.Â  Because this reason was facially race-neutral, Appellants satisfied step two, and the State was required to prove Appellants engaged in purposeful racial discrimination to satisfy step three.Â  Purkett, 514 U.S. at 767-68 (holding that at the second step of the Batson process the proponent of the strike does not have to present a persuasive or even a plausible reason, only a race-neutral one).Â  The State merely countered that neither Appellants nor their counsel knew for sure whether Juror 63 was related to the Deputy Sheriff with the same last name.Â  The trial court was persuaded by the Stateâ€™s argument and found pretext.Â  This was error.Â  The reason for striking Juror 63 was race-neutral, and the State failed to carry its burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel next explained that he struck Juror 52, a white woman, because she gave an â€œindignantâ€ and â€œshockedâ€ look.Â  The trial judge preempted the Stateâ€™s response, noting that he did not observe any such indignant or shocked expression from Juror 52.Â  The trial court pronounced Appellantsâ€™ reason as pretextual.Â  The demeanor of a prospective juror is generally a race-neutral reason for employing a peremptory challenge.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 8, 512 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1999) (â€œ[C]ounsel may strike venire persons based on their demeanor and disposition.â€).Â  We hold, however, that where a strike is based solely on a purported specific demeanor and disposition, and the trial judge makes an express and contrary finding, the deferential clearly erroneous standard of review applies.\r\nAn express finding by the trial court will, unless clearly erroneous, trump counselâ€™s stated perception of a prospective jurorâ€™s demeanor and disposition.Â  In this situation, the trial court determines counselâ€™s credibility.Â  See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 339 (2003) (â€œDeference is necessary because a reviewing court, which analyzes only the transcripts from voir dire, is not as well positioned as the trial court is to make credibility determinations.â€); Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 364-66 (1991) (holding that evaluation of a prosecutorâ€™s credibility â€œlies â€˜peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s provinceâ€™â€); State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615-16, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810-11 (2001) (â€œOften the demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination, and â€˜evaluation of the prosecutorâ€™s mind lies peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s province.â€™â€) (quoting Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 364-66); State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 454, 481 S.E.2d 169, 173 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œThe trial court must often base its decision on credibility determinations, and its rulings on discrimination are accorded great deference on appeal.â€); State v. Guess, 318 S.C. 269, 272-73, 457 S.E.2d 6, 8 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œTypically, the decisive question becomes whether [counselâ€™s] race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed. . . . [T]here is seldom much evidence in the record bearing on that issue, and the trial courtâ€™s findings regarding purposeful discrimination necessarily will rest largely on the evaluation of demeanor and credibility of counsel.Â  Therefore, those findings are given great deference and will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.â€) (citations omitted).\r\nThe ruleâ€”extending considerable deference to a trial judgeâ€™s credibility determinationsâ€”could not be otherwise without undermining the remaining remnants of Batson.Â  For example, if a party were able to overcome every Batson challenge by merely claiming that a prospective jurorâ€™s demeanor and disposition were somehow inappropriate, the equal protection principles underlying Batson would be weakened.Â  The trial court serves an important gatekeeping role in this regard.Â  Our decision today in no manner diminishes the continuing critical role of counselâ€™s (or a partyâ€™s) perception of a prospective jurorâ€™s demeanor and disposition in the exercise of peremptory challenges.Â  In the absence of an express and contrary finding by the trial court, a partyâ€™s striking of a juror based on demeanor and disposition should be upheld by the trial court.Â  As for Juror 52, because of the express findings of the trial court, the finding of pretext is not clearly erroneous. \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel then explained he struck Juror 78, a white woman, because she is the wife and office manager of a prominent dentist in the community.Â  The employment status of a prospective juror is a race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 632, 515 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1999) (unemployment is a race-neutral reason for strike); Ford, 334 S.C. at 65, 512 S.E.2d at 504 (place of employment is a race-neutral reason for strike); see Adams, 322 S.C. at 125, 470 S.E.2d at 372 (type of employment is a race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Flynn, Op. No. 4087 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed February 27, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 51) (Stateâ€™s categorization of a Head Start director as â€œa very liberal jobâ€ was a race-neutral reason for striking the juror).Â  Because Appellants offered a race-neutral reason for striking Juror 78, the burden shifted to the State to show purposeful racial discrimination.Â  Before the State had an opportunity to carry its burden, the trial court asked Appellantsâ€™ counsel if he knew Juror 78.Â  \r\nCounsel responded that he did not know Juror 78 but that he knew her husband.Â  The court responded:\r\n\r\nThe Court:Â  Well, . . . my thinking is if you try to prejudice somebody by their position, I mean as long as itâ€™s not law enforcement or something like that, I think that you donâ€™t know what her thinking is if you donâ€™t know her. \r\n\r\nThe trial court then found the striking of Juror 78 violated Batson.Â  As noted, unless discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanation provided by the proponent of the strike, the standard announced in Purkett and Adams does not require the proponent of the strike to carry any burden once a race-neutral reason is offered for the strike.Â  The burden is on the opponent of the strike to show purposeful racial discrimination.Â  The trial court erred when it, in effect, placed the burden on Appellants to disprove racial discrimination.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCounsel for Appellants next explained that he struck Juror 90, a white man, because he was a retired farmer.Â  The employment status of a prospective juror is a race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge.Â  Ford, 334 S.C. at 65, 512 S.E.2d at 504.Â  Here again, the trial court found Appellantsâ€™ counselâ€™s reason for striking Juror 90 pretextual without requiring the State to say a word, much less prove purposeful racial discrimination.Â Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel next explained he struck Juror 15, a black woman.Â  No reason for the strike was sought, as neither the court nor the State was concerned with the Appellantsâ€™ striking of black jurors.Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel then stated he struck Juror 25, a white woman, because she worked as a magistrate judgeâ€™s secretary.Â  The trial court found this reason was not pretextual, presumably because her employment was law-related.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel then explained he struck Juror 41, a white man, because he gave â€œa more outraged look than the others.â€Â  The trial court, without hearing from the State and without making a finding on the jurorâ€™s demeanor, simply declared the reason pretextual: \r\n\r\nThe Court:Â  Okay.Â  I find that thatâ€™s pretextual.Â  The next one. \r\n\r\nThe trial court failed to follow the proper Batson procedure, and this was error.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel next explained that Juror 7, a white man, was struck, because â€œ[h]eâ€™s an insurance agent and his wife is a bank teller.â€Â  Counsel also informed the court that the juror â€œsaid something about working for the sheriffâ€™s department.â€Â  The trial court found the strike proper and not pretextual because counsel â€œthought that [Juror 7] was doing work for the sheriffâ€™s department.â€Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counsel shared with the court his concern and experience with jurors (or spouses of jurors) employed in certain jobs, such as insurance agents:\r\n\r\nCounsel for Appellants:Â  Your Honor, I never put the relatives [sic] bank tellers and insurance agents[] [o]n my juries[.] . . . If youâ€™re an insurance agent. Or if youâ€™re married to an insurance agent.Â  Or if theyâ€™re a bank teller or married to a bank teller.Â  These are the most straight-laced, conservation [sic] people that, that you could find, in my opinion.Â  And they will . . . always convict your client.\r\n\r\nFinally, Appellantsâ€™s counsel explained he struck Juror 93, a white woman, for two reasons.Â  First, according to counsel, Juror 93 taught at a school that used to segregate students on the basis of race.Â  Second, the jurorâ€™s husband is an insurance agent.Â  As the following exchange reveals, the trial court did not consult the State before finding Appellantsâ€™ reason was pretextual:\r\n\r\nCounsel for Appellants:Â  [Juror 93 is] a teacher at Patrick Henry [School], Your Honor, which was predominately â€“ I think they allow black people to go there now but it was started as a racist response to desegregation, Patrick Henry was.Â  It was an all white school which has recently â€“ [t]hey allow black students there now.Â  But itâ€™s generally not something â€“ somebody I want.Â  And on top of that, they have â€“ \r\nThe Court:Â  Thatâ€™s pretextual.Â  Go ahead and put your record on, though.Â  Go ahead.\r\nCounsel for Appellants:Â  Your Honor, I just donâ€™t think that somebody that works for a racist institution thatâ€™s white should be judging my client.Â  I think thatâ€™s just fraught with problems, Judge.Â  And her husbandâ€™s an insurance agent, one, one of the most conservative class of people that I â€“ that I could think of, Judge.\r\nThe Court:Â  Okay.Â  Well, every one of those reasons is a stereotype.Â  And I think if itâ€™s a stereotype itâ€™s pretextual. . . . I find that that was []\r\npretextual.\r\n\r\nThe reason Appellantsâ€™ counsel offered to strike Juror 93 was in part race-neutral.Â  Moreover, it would seem plausible for a black defendant to strike a potential juror who worked at a school that was perceived to be founded in response to desegregation.Â  Although&nbsp;the jurorâ€™s race is tangentially at issue, it is&nbsp;important to realize that the juror was struck, not because of her race, but because of her association with an organization which counsel perceived as having a history of practicing racial discrimination.\r\nRacial prejudice has long been held to be a valid basis for striking a juror for cause.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1020 (Supp. 2005) (requiring the trial judge to ask jurors whether they are related to either party, have any interest in the cause, have expressed or formed an opinion, or know of any bias or prejudice to either party).Â  Beyond a challenge for cause, this court has held that â€œ[t]he principal function of the peremptory strike is to allow for the removal of a juror in whom the challenging party perceives bias or prejudice, even where the juror is not challengeable for cause.â€Â  State v. Short, 327 S.C. 329, 335, 489 S.E.2d 209, 212 (Ct. App. 1997), affâ€™d, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999).Â  It follows, then, that perceived prejudice may serve as a basis for exercising a peremptory challenge.Â  Because a jurorâ€™s perceived bias (for whatever reason) lies at the core of virtually every peremptory challenge, courts should intervene only when it is demonstrated that the strike runs afoul of the Constitution.\r\nIn our judgment, neither of Appellantsâ€™ explanations here was pretextual.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,&nbsp;after counsel offered seemingly valid reasons for striking Juror 93, the trial court did not require the State to prove purposeful racial discrimination.Â  Rather, the trial court required Appellantsâ€™ counsel to prove that he did not purposefully discriminate on the basis of race.Â  This was error.[4]Â  Furthermore, just because the reason given for striking a juror may fit a stereotype does not necessarily mean the reason is pretextual.\r\nIn granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion and quashing the first jury, the trial court erred.\r\n IV.\r\nEarly on, the trial court abandoned the Purkett-Adams procedure for a Batson motion.Â  The trial court failed to require the State to carry its burden of establishing purposeful racial discrimination in the third step of the Batson procedure.Â  The State urges us to excuse noncompliance with the third step of the Batson procedure because of Appellantsâ€™ â€œpatternâ€ of striking white jurors.Â  As noted, we find no such pattern, and the trial court made no such finding.Â  \r\nAppellants exercised only half of their allotted strikes.Â  Appellantsâ€™ first and sixth strikes were exercised against black women.Â  In any event, the mere presence of a pattern would not justify a departure from the Purkett-Adams procedure.Â  See State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 66, 512 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1999) (â€œAlthough appellant exercised most of his strikes against white jurors, he did not strike every white juror. . . .Â  [T]he fact that appellant used most of his challenges to strike white jurors is not sufficient, in itself, to establish purposeful discrimination.â€).Â  Even the trial court acknowledged as much midway through the process.Â  When the State argued that a strike by defense counsel was â€œin that same class of white persons who have been struck,â€ the trial court correctly observed that a juror â€œcan be in that class . . . and [Appellants can] still have a valid reason for striking [that juror].â€Â  Nevertheless, the trial court found many race-neutral reasons advanced by Appellants pretextual without resorting to the third and final step where the ultimate burden of persuasion would have been imposed on the State.\r\nTo be sure, a trial courtâ€™s finding of a suspect pattern of peremptory challenges may carry weight in the ultimate disposition of a Batson motion.Â  But the mere claim or appearance that peremptory challenges fit into a pattern does not excuse the failure to follow the mandated three-step Purkett-Adams procedure.Â  \r\nThis is illustrated by the Stateâ€™s use of peremptory challenges in the selection of the second jury.Â  The State used four strikes, all against blacks.Â  Appellants moved under Batson to quash the jury.Â  Under the Stateâ€™s â€œpatternâ€ theory, the trial court presumably would have been justified in dispensing with the third and final step (requiring Appellants to prove purposeful discrimination) and allowing the mere pattern of striking blacks to establish pretext and carry the motion in Appellantsâ€™ favor.Â  The State, however, provided specific race-neutral reasons for its strikes, and the trial court proceeded to the final step, requiring Appellants to prove purposeful discrimination.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor a Batson motion, the trial court must follow the procedure outlined in Purkett and Adams.Â  We find our opinion in State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 307, 519 S.E.2d 793, 796 (Ct. App. 1999) instructive.Â  In Smalls, the defendant used nine of his ten peremptory challenges on white jurors.Â  The State opposed these strikes and requested a Batson hearing.Â  At the Batson hearing, the defendant argued he struck the white jurors because they looked at him in a mean, stern, and accusatory manner.Â  Although the trial court admitted these reasons might be reasonable, it nevertheless determined they were pretextual.Â  Importantly, it made this determination without requiring the State to prove the defendant engaged in purposeful racial discrimination.Â  This court reversed the trial courtâ€™s finding because it failed â€œto require the State to carry its burden to present evidence of pretext as prescribed by step three of the Adams/Purkett analysis.â€Â  Id. at 309, 519 S.E.2d at 797.Â  We similarly conclude the trial court erred when it abandoned the process mandated by Purkett and Adams and effectively placed a burden of disproving pretext and purposeful discrimination on Appellants. \r\n V. \r\nThe second jury was comprised of two black men, two white men, three black women, and five white women.Â  Appellants did not use any of their peremptory challenges, and the court forbade Appellants from striking those jurors it determined were improperly struck during the first jury selection.Â  Conversely, the State used four peremptory challenges, all on black jurors.Â  Appellants opposed the Stateâ€™s strikes and requested a Batson hearing.Â  At the second Batson hearing, the trial court scrupulously adhered to the mandated Batson process and required Appellants to show purposeful racial discrimination after the State offered race-neutral explanations. \r\nFor example, the State stated it struck Juror 76, a black woman, because she has a brother who served time in prison.Â  After hearing this explanation, which was race-neutral, the trial court followed the Batson process and required Appellants to show purposeful racial discrimination.Â  Yet the strike was nothing more than a stereotype that those with family members who have served prison sentences are also unsavoryâ€”a guilt-by-association stereotype.Â  Had the trial court held to the approach it took during the first Batson hearing, the Stateâ€™s strike would have been decreed â€œpretextualâ€ and that would have been the end of it.\r\n VI.Â  \r\nWe now address whether the error is reversible.Â  Our case law dictates that even if the trial court commits error in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, the error is reversible only if the second jury is comprised of jurors whom the trial court erroneously prohibited the defendant from striking based on Batson.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 126, 470 S.E.2d at 373; State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 504, 593 S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Mar. 3, 2005).Â  A defendant has no right to a particular jury.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 126, 470 S.E.2d at 373.\r\nIn State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999), our supreme court held that no actual prejudice need be shown to establish reversible error for the deprivation of a peremptory strike where properly struck jurors are seated on the second jury.Â  See also Ford, 334 S.C. at 66, 512 S.E.2d at 504 (holding that reversal and granting of a new trial is a proper remedy where the trial court erred in finding defendant violated Batson in striking\r\ncertain jurors and any challenged juror was seated on the second jury).\r\nThree of the six jurors Appellants properly struck from the first jury were seated on the second jury.Â  Appellants should have been permitted to strike all three of these jurors.Â  One of these three served as an alternate and did not participate in the deliberations.Â  Any error with regard to this juror was harmless.Â  State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 444, 449, 513 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œAny Batson violation in regards to a possible alternate juror is harmless where an alternate was not needed for deliberations.â€).Â  The remaining jurors, Jurors 78 and 93, were seated as regular members on the second jury.Â  Because both jurors were seated on the second jury and participated in the deliberations that determined Appellantsâ€™ guilt, the error is reversible.[5]  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court committed legal error.Â  The trial courtâ€™s handling of the first Batson hearing in effect placed the burden on Appellants to prove the absence of purposeful discrimination even after Appellants articulated race-neutral reasons for their strikes.Â  Because jurors properly struck were seated on the second jury, which found Appellants guilty, the error is reversible.Â Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs. \r\n ANDERSON, J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion.\r\n ANDERSON, J. (concurring in result only in a separate opinion):Â  I VOTE to REVERSE the convictions and sentences of Willie Cochran and Reggie James (collectively, Appellants) because of the error committed by the circuit judge in violating Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\nThe Appellants were convicted of first degree burglary.Â  Additionally, Appellant James was convicted of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Appellants appeal from the trial courtâ€™s finding that six of their ten peremptory challenges violated Batson v. Kentucky.Â  Although Appellants offered race-neutral reasons for their peremptory challenges, the trial judge found their reasons were mere pretext to engage in purposeful racial discrimination.Â  Appellants claim the trial judge erred in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion.\r\nThe conduct of a Batson hearing by a circuit judge is an intricate and labyrinthine trial procedure.Â  Ofttimes, the circuit judge is presented with evidentiary conundrums emanating from the analysis of the factual and legal posture of the prospective juror.Â  The body of law extant in regard to rulings made by a trial judge in a Batson hearing reveals luculently that the appellate court must give deferential treatment to the trial judge on review.Â  The appellate court has the luxury of lengthy cogitation and rumination whereas the circuit judge rules in a trial setting not allowing for lengthy deliberation and delay.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDuring jury selection, Appellants, African-American men, used ten of their twenty peremptory challenges on two black women, three white men, and five white women.Â  The State opposed Appellantsâ€™ strikes and requested a Batson hearing.Â  At the Batson hearing, the trial judge found the race-neutral reasons offered by Appellants for their peremptory challenges were mere pretext to exclude jurors on the basis of race.Â  The judge granted the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, quashed the first jury, and drew a second one.\r\nDuring the second jury selection, the State used four of its five peremptory challenges on a black man and three black women.Â  Appellants opposed all four of the Stateâ€™s strikes and requested a Batson hearing.Â  At this Batson hearing, the State offered race-neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges and the trial judge found the Stateâ€™s reasons were not pretextual.Â  The trial judge denied Appellantsâ€™ Batson motion and impaneled the jury.Â  The second jury was comprised of two of the six jurors Appellants struck from the first jury, which the trial judge found violated Batson.Â  These two jurors participated in the deliberations and verdict.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn determining whether a party exercised strikes in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), the appellate court must examine the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record surrounding the strikes.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings regarding purposeful discrimination in the exercise of peremptory strikes rest largely on evaluation of demeanor and credibility.Â  Southerland v. State, 337 S.C. 610, 524 S.E.2d 833 (1999); State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999).Â  Often the demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination. Â Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991); Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615-16, 545 S.E.2d at 810.Â  Furthermore, a strike must be examined in light of the circumstances under which it is exercised, including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes.Â  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 616, 545 S.E.2d at 810-11.\r\nThe judgeâ€™s findings as to purposeful discrimination are entitled to great deference and will be set aside on appeal only if clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by the record.Â  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 619, 545 S.E.2d at 813.Â  Where the record does not support the trial courtâ€™s findings, the findings must be overturned.Â  State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the trial judge erred in finding their peremptory challenges violated Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\nBATSON HEARING\r\nThe purposes of Batson v. Kentucky and its progeny are to protect the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a jury of his peers, protect each venirepersonâ€™s right not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory reasons, and preserve public confidence in the fairness of the justice system by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection process.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); State v. Flynn, Op. No. 4087 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 27, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 48).Â  It is unconstitutional to strike a juror on the basis of race or gender.Â  See J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994).Â  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venireperson on the basis of race.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001); Haigler, 334 S.C. at 628, 515 S.E.2d at 90.Â  â€œPurposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire violates a defendantâ€™s right to equal protection because it denies him the protection that a trial by jury is intended to secure.â€Â  Batson, 476 U.S. at 86.Â  A criminal defendant may object to race-based peremptory challenges on equal protection grounds regardless of whether the defendant and potential juror share the same race.Â  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991); Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998).Â  Both the State and defendants are prohibited from discriminatorily exercising a peremptory challenge of a prospective juror.Â  Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992).\r\nA hearing held pursuant to Batson v. Kentucky is trifurcated.Â  First, when one party strikes a member of a cognizable racial group, the circuit court must hold a Batson hearing if the opposing party requests one.Â  Shuler, 344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810; Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 90.Â  In order to raise and preserve a Batson issue, the opposing party must move for the hearing after the jury is selected but before it is sworn.Â  State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987).Â  This hearing must be held out of the presence of the jury panel and the jury venire.Â  Id.Â  Second, the proponent of the strike, to successfully rebut the presumption of a Batson violation, must then offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike.Â  Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 90-91.Â  Third, the opponent of the strike must show that the race-neutral explanation given was mere pretext.Â  Id. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91; State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).\r\nI.Â  The Strike &amp; Batson Request\r\nThe trial judge must hold a Batson hearing when members of a cognizable racial group are struck and the opposing party requests a hearing.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999); State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987).Â  Any person, regardless of race, may set forth a Batson claim.Â  State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995).Â  Both the defendant and the State can make a Batson motion.Â  See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998).\r\n Batson requires a hearing to allow a party the opportunity to make a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination by challenging the other partyâ€™s use of a peremptory strike, and if such discrimination is found, the proponent of the strike has the opportunity to present a neutral explanation for the strike.Â  Jones, 293 S.C. at 56-57, 358 S.E.2d at 702-03.\r\nII.Â  Explanation for the Strike\r\nThe proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372; State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 519 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The explanation need not be clear, reasonably specific, or legitimate; it only needs to be race-neutral.Â  State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 471 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997).Â  The reason is not required to be persuasive or plausible and may even be silly or superstitious.Â  Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995); State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  While merely denying a discriminatory motive is insufficient, the proponent of the strike need only present race-neutral reasons.Â  Casey, 325 S.C. at 451-52, 481 S.E.2d at 171-72.Â  At this stage of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the explanation.Â  In State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996), our supreme court adopted the procedure for the second step of the Batson analysis delineated in Purkett v. Elem:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. . . . It is not until the third step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevantâ€”the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.Â  At that stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination. But to say that a trial judge may choose to disbelieve a silly or superstitious reason at step 3 is quite different from saying that a trial judge must terminate the inquiry at step 2 when the race-neutral reason is silly or superstitious. The latter violates the principle that the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.â€\r\n\r\nAdams, 322 S.C. at 123-24, 470 S.E.2d at 371-72.Â  Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the proponentâ€™s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race-neutral.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999); Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998).\r\nSouth Carolina rejected the dual motivation doctrine in the Batson context.Â  Payton, 329 S.C. at 59-60, 495 S.E.2d at 210.Â  We adopted the â€œtaintedâ€ approach whereby a discriminatory explanation for the exercise of a peremptory challenge will vitiate other nondiscriminatory explanations for the strike.Â  Id.\r\nA.Â  Examplesâ€”Valid Reasons for Strike\r\n1.Â  Demeanor.Â  Demeanor can be considered a racially neutral explanation.Â  Counsel may strike venirepersons based on their demeanor and disposition.Â  See Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d 907 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding the State is allowed to consider tone, demeanor, facial expression, and any other race-neutral factors when striking jurors); State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 413 S.E.2d 323 (1991) (two black males struck because they were late); State v. Wright, 304 S.C. 529, 405 S.E.2d 825 (1991) (stricken juror had disinterested attitude and demeanor); State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 309, 519 S.E.2d 793, 797 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding no discriminatory intent inherent in defense counselâ€™s explanation for striking jurors who appeared to counsel as â€œlooking in a â€˜mean,â€™ â€˜sternâ€™ or â€˜accusatoryâ€™ mannerâ€); State v. Guess, 318 S.C. 269, 457 S.E.2d 6 (Ct. App. 1995) (declaring solicitor could strike venireperson because of demeanor observed during qualification; juror appeared to be â€œslowâ€).\r\n2.Â  Recipient of prior strike.Â  See Sumpter v. State, 312 S.C. 221, 439 S.E.2d 842 (1994) (â€œwe find the solicitorâ€™s additional explanation that he struck Mr. Wright because he had struck him earlier in the week is also race neutralâ€); Feddiman v. State, 558 A.2d 278 (Del. 1989) (determining solicitorâ€™s explanation was race-neutral where she struck a male juror and later struck a female juror with the same last name who lived at the same address because she was concerned that there would be some feeling against the State for striking the male juror).\r\n3.Â  Prior jury service.Â  Recent prior jury service is a facially neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike.Â  State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n4.Â  Prior criminal conviction.Â  A prior criminal conviction is a neutral reason to strike.Â  Casey, 325 S.C. at 453 n.2, 481 S.E.2d at 172 n.2; see also Sumpter, 312 S.C. at 223-24, 439 S.E.2d at 844 (ruling solicitorâ€™s explanation for striking a black venireperson was racially neutral where prospective juror had a prior DUI involvement).\r\n5.Â  Possible criminal record.Â  State v. Martinez, 294 S.C. 72, 362 S.E.2d 641 (1987).\r\n6.Â  Prior prosecution by that particular Solicitorâ€™s office.Â  State v. Dyar, 317 S.C. 77, 452 S.E.2d 603 (1994); Sumpter, 312 S.C. at 223-24, 439 S.E.2d at 844.\r\n7.Â  Acquaintance with the trial judge.Â  See State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (noting a potential jurorâ€™s acquaintance with the trial judge is a valid reason for exercising a peremptory strike).\r\n8.Â  Relationship with attorney.Â  An attorneyâ€™s personal knowledge of and relationship with a prospective juror is a race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike.Â  State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999).\r\n9.Â  Relationship with law enforcement or pro-law enforcement attitude.Â  A potential jurorâ€™s relationship with a law enforcement official, or a potential jurorâ€™s pro-law enforcement attitude, is a race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike.Â  Ford, 334 S.C. at 65, 512 S.E.2d at 504; cf. State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (noting Stateâ€™s explanation that juror was anti-law enforcement was race-neutral).\r\n10.Â  Knowledge of and association with defendant.Â  State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990).\r\n11.Â  Unemployment.Â  Unemployment is a race-neutral reason for a strike.Â  State v. Green, 306 S.C. 94, 409 S.E.2d 785 (1991).\r\n12.Â  Place or type of employment.Â  It is legitimate to strike potential jurors because of their employment.Â  Ford, 334 S.C. at 65, 512 S.E.2d at 504; see also Adams, 322 S.C. at 125, 470 S.E.2d at 372 (finding potential jurorâ€™s employment as a court reporter is a valid reason for exercising a peremptory strike).\r\n13.Â  â€œGeneral instabilityâ€.Â  See State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991)(indicating that Solicitorâ€™s reasons for striking black juror were racially neutral and were not pretext for discrimination where Solicitor stated he struck juror because of her â€œgeneral instability,â€ in that she had changed employment several times after relatively short periods of employment, was unmarried mother of two-year-old, and was still living at her parentsâ€™ home, and juror admitted on voir dire that she had seen outspoken advocate of defendant discussing his case on television).\r\nB.Â  Examplesâ€”Invalid Reasons for Strike\r\n1.Â  Desire to seat other venirepersons who have not yet been presented.Â  See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 210, 499 S.E.2d 209, 211 (1998) (stating black murder defendant who exercised nine of his peremptory strikes to remove white prospective jurors and one peremptory strike to remove black prospective juror from panel failed to satisfy requirement of Batson that he offer race-neutral explanation for his exercise of strikes against two of those white prospective jurors; defendant explained he struck those jurors â€œto reach some jurors further down the list,â€ but he offered no explanation as to which jurors he was attempting to seat or why other jurors were more desirable than the two in question); State v. Grandy, 306 S.C. 224, 411 S.E.2d 207 (1991) (emphasizing that solicitor failed to articulate racially neutral explanation in his assertion he excluded prospective black juror because he wanted to seat other venirepersons; solicitor gave no reason why it was desirable to have other venirepersons seated, as opposed to the black juror; effect was same as if no reason was given for striking black juror).\r\n2.&nbsp; Generalization about an entire group.Â  See Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (ruling that striking white juror because she was a â€œredneckâ€ was not valid race-neutral reason on its face; thus, strike was facially discriminatory and violated Batson; term â€œredneckâ€ was racially derogatory term applied exclusively to members of white race, and term stereotyped subgroup of white race without any evidence that each member of group was actually possessed of bias or prejudice).\r\n3.Â  Potential juror who â€œshucked and jivedâ€ to the microphone.Â  See State v. Tomlin, 299 S.C. 294, 299, 384 S.E.2d 707, 710 (1989) (â€œThe trial court failed to inquire into or comment on the prosecutorâ€™s explanation that the juror was struck because he â€˜shucked and jived.â€™ The use of this racial stereotype is evidence of the prosecutorâ€™s subjective intent to discriminate and clearly violates the mandates of Batson.â€).\r\n4.Â  Racial stereotypes.Â  See Tomlin, 299 S.C. at 298-99, 384 S.E.2d at 710 (noting prosecutor stated he struck Juror, a forty-three-year-old black woman, because she walked slow, talked low and might not be able to withstand trial; rather than inquiring into legitimacy of this explanation, trial court suggested juror had lack of education, was extremely sluggish and would be a â€œfillerâ€ if seated on the jury; supreme court concluded use of such racial stereotypes violates Batson).\r\nIII.Â  Argument of Mere Pretext\r\nOnce a race-neutral explanation is given, the opponent of the strike must show the explanation was mere pretext to engage in purposeful racial discrimination.Â  State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999); State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  Pretext generally will be established by demonstrating that a similarly situated member of another race was seated on the jury.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999); Adams, 322 S.C. at 123, 470 S.E.2d at 371.Â  Under some circumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible that the judge may determine, at this third step of the analysis, that the explanation was mere pretext even without a showing of disparate treatment.Â  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998).\r\nThe uneven application of a neutral reason does not automatically result in a finding of invidious discrimination if the strikeâ€™s proponent provides a race-neutral explanation for the inconsistency.Â  See State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (finding State provided a racially neutral explanation for why Solicitor did not strike juror with similar characteristics to one previously stricken).Â  Under this prong, persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant.Â  Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995).Â  The opponent of the strike carries the burden of persuading the circuit court the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372; see also Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91 (stating burden of persuading court a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on opponent of strike); ); State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 308, 519 S.E.2d 793, 796 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œAt this third step, the burden returns to the party challenging the strike to establish that the explanation is mere pretext.â€).Â  The ultimate question the trial court resolves under this prong is whether the movant has met his burden in demonstrating purposeful discrimination.Â  State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nA racially neutral reason can be negated by showing that the party created a pretext for purposeful discrimination by applying his allegedly racially neutral standard in a discriminatory manner.Â  State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 471 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997).Â  In State v. Oglesby, 298 S.C. 279, 379 S.E.2d 891 (1989), the supreme court found a Batson violation when the State struck three black women because they were patients of a doctor who was a defense witness, but seated a white woman who was a patient of the same doctor.Â  The court held the Stateâ€™s race-neutral reason for striking the three black women was mere pretext in light of the fact that it seated a similarly situated white woman.Â  Id.\r\nThe determination of whether the minimum quantum of evidence has been produced under this prong is flexible, for the trial courtâ€™s ruling turns on an examination of the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record, including the credibility and demeanor of the strikeâ€™s proponent, and the plausibility of a neutral, but otherwise unpersuasive, reason.Â  Casey, 325 S.C. at 452, 481 S.E.2d at 172.\r\nIn deciding whether the opponent of a strike has carried the burden of persuasion, a court must undertake a sensitive inquiry into the circumstantial and direct evidence of intent.Â  Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91.Â  A strike must be examined in light of the circumstances under which it is exercised, including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes.Â  Id.\r\nIV.Â  After Batson Motion is Granted\r\nIf the trial judge finds the opposing party has established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and that the proponent of the strike has failed to give race-neutral reasons for the contested strikes, the process of selecting a jury shall start over.Â  See State v. Jones, 293 S.C. 54, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987).Â  Thus, â€œif the circuit court finds a juror has been struck in violation of Batson, our supreme court has mandated that the circuit court strike the entire jury and begin the jury selection process de novo.â€Â  State v. Heyward, 357 S.C. 577, 580, 594 S.E.2d 168, 169 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Members of the tainted jury and all persons who were struck may be placed back in the jury venire.Â  Jones, 293 S.C. at 58, 358 S.E.2d at 704.\r\nOnce a juror has been unconstitutionally stricken, the jury selection process relative to that juror is tainted.Â  State v. Lewis, 363 S.C. 37, 609 S.E.2d 515 (2005).Â  If the trial court chooses to reseat the improperly stricken juror, the striking party may not use a peremptory strike to remove that juror from the panel a second time.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, during the subsequent jury selection, the trial judge may prohibit the party who violated Batson from striking a juror who was improperly struck during the previous jury selection.Â  Id.; State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357 (1995).\r\nV.Â  State v. Adams and its Progeny\r\nIn State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996), during voir dire, the defense exercised its peremptory challenges upon seven Caucasians.Â  The prosecution requested a Batson hearing.Â  The trial judge found a Batson violation based on his conclusion that defense counselâ€™s explanations for two of the strikesâ€”that one of the prospective jurors was a court reporter, knew too much about the process, and looked â€œtoo intelligent,â€ and that another prospective juror knew the trial judgeâ€”were not racially neutral.Â  On appeal, our supreme court ruled the trial judge erred in finding a Batson violation.Â  The court concluded:\r\n\r\nThese explanations are racially neutral, legitimate reasons for exercising peremptory strikes. A potential jurorâ€™s acquaintance with the trial judge is a perfectly valid explanation for the exercise of a peremptory\r\nstrike. The explanation that one juror looked â€œtoo intelligentâ€ could be viewed as suspect but for the fact that the primary explanation given for the strike was that the potential juror was employed as a court reporter and may have known â€œtoo muchâ€ about the judicial process. Under our past precedents, the judge should have found these reasons racially neutral and legitimate and allowed the prosecution an opportunity to show that the explanations were pretextual.Â  Under the new Purkett standard, the judge also should have allowed the inquiry to proceed to the third step, because the explanations given were facially race-neutral.\r\nThe Record contains very little information that would allow this Court to determine whether defense counsel allowed to be seated black jurors who were similarly situated to the white jurors who were struck. The Record lacks this information because the trial judge did not allow the Batson hearing to proceed to the third stage. Without more information in the Record, we conclude that the trial court erred in finding a Batson violation and in quashing the original jury.\r\n\r\nId. at 125, 470 S.E.2d at 372.\r\nThe court of appeals, in State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 471 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997), found a Batson violation when the defendant struck a black man because of his age, but seated a white man within the same age bracket. This court held the defendantâ€™s race-neutral reason for striking the black man was negated by the fact he seated several white venirepersons in the same age bracket.Â  Id.\r\nIn Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998), respondent exercised all of his peremptory strikes to remove prospective white jurors.Â  Petitioner requested a Batson hearing.Â  Respondentâ€™s counsel offered the following reason for striking Juror 18:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe juror number 18, she is known as [a] very opinionated person, your Honor, who expresses herself.Â  We knew if she got on that jury she was not gone [sic] budge one way or the other, that she was gone [sic] get her way or no way.Â  That was our opinion from what we had learned.Â  Her family has--Mr. Lanier has talked about the number of people in trouble.Â  She herself has not had any problems but she comes from a family thatâ€™s had some problems with the law and sheâ€™s kind of what we refer to as a redneck variety, so to speak, and that was the reason we struck her and, as you know, your Honor, I was concerned with her family, whether she had any problems with me or the law because some members of her family might have problems with the law.â€\r\n\r\nId. at 55, 495 S.E.2d at 208.Â  After hearing respondentâ€™s reason for striking the juror, the trial court declared the reason race-neutral and found respondent had not violated Batson.Â  On appeal, the supreme court ruled the trial court erred in finding the reason offered to strike Juror 18 to be race-neutral on its face.Â  The court explicated: â€œThe term â€˜redneckâ€™ is a racially derogatory term applied exclusively to members of the white race. Â The use of the term â€˜redneckâ€™ is not a valid race-neutral reason to strike a potential juror, and therefore, the strike is facially discriminatory and violates Batson.â€Â  Id. at 55-56, 495 S.E.2d 208 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn State v. McCray, 332 S.C. 536, 506 S.E.2d 301 (1998), appellant, who is black, was tried with two co-defendants, Roger Dewitt (Bill) Prince and Charlie Dorn Smith, who are white.Â  Appellant argued his co-defendants violated Batson by excluding black jurors from the venire because of their race.Â  The judge denied appellantâ€™s Batson motion.Â  The supreme court remanded the matter to the trial court for the purpose of conducting a Batson hearing.Â  On remand, co-defendant Prince candidly stated, due to the passage of time, he did not remember exactly why he had struck the black jurors at issue but, referring to his notes, thought he struck Juror #112 because she had two cousins who were sheriffs in New York and Juror #26 because he had a friend who worked for the sheriffâ€™s department.Â  Co-defendant Smith stated he did not want anyone with connection to law enforcement on the jury.Â  Consequently, he struck Juror #9, whose friend worked for SLED, and Juror #61, whose cousin worked for the sheriffâ€™s department.\r\nAppellant argued the stated reasons for striking the four black jurors were pretextual because the co-defendants did not strike three white jurors who had similar connections to law enforcement.Â  The trial judge concluded the stated reasons for striking the four black jurors were not pretextual.Â  The supreme court agreed finding the record from the jury voir dire indicated the three white jurors who were seated on the jury were not similarly situated to the four black jurors who were struck from the jury.Â  While the black jurors had relatives or friends who, at the time of trial, were employed in law enforcement, the relatives or friends of the white jurors were no longer employed in law enforcement.Â  The white jurors did not have the same relationship to law enforcement as the black jurors.Â  The court determined appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing the co-defendantsâ€™ stated reasons for striking the black jurors were pretextual.Â  Thus, the court ruled the trial judgeâ€™s findings were supported by the evidence and should be affirmed.\r\nIn State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999), all of the six peremptory strikes used by the State were used against blacks.Â  Appellant contended that similarly situated white jurors were not struck.Â  Specifically, appellant questioned the striking of Juror Bonaparte.Â  On appeal, the supreme court articulated:\r\n\r\nThe solicitor stated he struck Juror Bonaparte because he was argumentative and his answers were â€œdogmatic.â€Â  Further, Juror Bonaparte had referred to his brotherâ€™s murder and the former solicitorâ€™s refusal to prosecute.Â  The solicitor stated he was afraid this juror harbored some resentment against the solicitorâ€™s office which might affect his deliberations.Â  The trial court agreed that Juror Bonaparte was argumentative.Â  The trial judge even pointed out how the juror had been argumentative with him.Â  Appellant has failed to point out a white juror similarly situated to Juror Bonaparte who was not struck.Â  Furthermore, counsel may strike venirepersons based on their demeanor and disposition.Â  State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 413 S.E.2d 323 (1991).\r\n\r\nId. at 8, 512 S.E.2d at 102.\r\nIn State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999), the defense, during jury selection, used eight peremptory challenges, all against white venirepersons.Â  On the Stateâ€™s motion, the trial judge conducted a Batson hearing.Â  The judge ruled two of Shortâ€™s challenges were racially motivated and, thus, violative of Batson.Â  The two contested strikes were exercised against Jurors #39 and #13.Â  Defense counsel explained he challenged #39 because her husband was an assistant manager at â€œCarlâ€™sâ€ and â€œjust about every term of court, Carlâ€™s has a case in court, either somebody shooting in the parking lot, bad checks, one thing and another.â€Â  Id. at 476, 511 S.E.2d at 359.Â  As to #13, counsel explained the juror was employed at the same business where counselâ€™s brother was the manager and â€œmaybe because heâ€™s a manager, heâ€™s made somebody mad and they would hold it against my client.â€Â  Id. at 476, 511 S.E.2d at 359-60.Â  The trial court found the defenseâ€™s explanations for its exercise of peremptory strikes were not racially neutral absent a showing of actual bias or prejudice on the part of Jurors 39 and 13.Â  The trial court set aside the jury panel.Â  The judge then directed that the jury be re-struck and that Short would not be permitted to challenge the two venirepersons previously stricken in violation of Batson.Â  During the second jury selection, both Jurors 39 and 13 were seated.Â  Short requested a bench conference immediately after the jury selection and thereafter objected to the seating of the two jurors.Â  On appeal, the supreme court concluded Shortâ€™s explanations were facially race-neutral and the State failed to show mere pretext.Â  Thus, the trial judge erred in ruling the strikes violated Batson.\r\nIn State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999), during jury selection, appellant exercised thirteen peremptory challenges when selecting the jury and the two alternates.Â  Twelve of the thirteen jurors struck were white.Â  On the Stateâ€™s motion, the trial court conducted a Batson hearing.Â  The trial judge noted he was most concerned with the strikes exercised against Jurors #95 and #126.Â  Defense counsel claimed he struck Juror #95 â€œbecause she works at a local hardware store which is owned by a former longtime Dillon County Magistrate and his employees are exposed to pro-prosecution ideas since many law enforcement personnel regularly visit the store.â€Â  Id. at 62, 512 S.E.2d at 502.Â  He struck Juror #126 for the following reason:\r\n\r\nâ€œ[W]e did not feel comfortable. . . . Heâ€™s assistant manager of Tomlinsons on Main Street.Â  My wife helped me select the juror and as a teenager she worked there and he worked there at the time.Â  And we feel that he would feel uncomfortable. And, in fact, last September, when I had a death penalty case, he sold me a pair of shoes to wear in court for that trial.Â  So we thought he would be uncomfortable sitting on the jury.Â  We didnâ€™t know which way he might go.Â  But it could certainly have a bearing on that.Â  And whenever I go into Tomlinsons we all joke and talk.Â  Of course, we have not talked about this particular trial, but every time I go in there heâ€™s asking me about court, different cases going on.Â  And I, certainly, would not want him to be on one of my juries because I wouldnâ€™t feel comfortable.â€\r\n\r\nId. at 62-63, 512 S.E.2d at 502.Â  The trial judge ruled appellant had violated Batson.Â  According to the judge, because appellant exercised all but one of his strikes against prospective white jurors, â€œâ€˜[t]he cumulative effect is a lot worse picture than looking at it on an individual basis.â€™â€Â  Id. at 63, 512 S.E.2d at 503.Â  The trial judge quashed the jury and ordered selection of a new jury.Â  Further, the judge ruled appellant could not strike Juror #126 during the second jury selection. Both Jurors #95 and #126 were seated on the second jury.\r\nOn appeal, appellant alleged the judge erred in finding his strikes violated Batson.Â  The supreme court illuminated:\r\n\r\nIn this case, appellantâ€™s explanations were facially race-neutral.Â  In particular, with regard to Juror #126, an attorneyâ€™s personal knowledge of and relationship with a prospective juror is a race-neutral reason.Â  See State v. Adams, [322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996)] (a potential jurorâ€™s acquaintance with the trial judge is a valid reason for exercising a peremptory strike).Â  With regard to Juror #95, a prospective jurorâ€™s employment in a hardware store owned by a longtime magistrate where local law enforcement officials gather is a race-neutral reason.Â  State v. Adams, supra (a potential jurorâ€™s employment as a court reporter is a valid reason for exercising a peremptory strike); State v. Green, [306 S.C. 94, 409 S.E.2d 785 (1991)] (unemployment is a race-neutral reason).Â  Further, it is legitimate to strike potential jurors because of their employment. Â State v. Adams, supra; State v. Green, supra.Â  Also, it is legitimate to strike a potential juror because she or he has a relationship with a law enforcement official or because she or he is pro-law enforcement.Â  Compare with State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (Stateâ€™s explanation that juror was anti-law enforcement was race-neutral).\r\nFurther, these explanations are not so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext without some showing of disparate treatment.Â  The State offered no evidence of pretext, as required by step three of the Adams/Purkett analysis.Â  Although appellant exercised most of his strikes against white jurors, he did not strike every white juror.Â  Instead, some white jurors were accepted by appellant and were placed on the first jury.Â  Further, the fact that appellant used most of his challenges to strike white jurors is not sufficient, in itself, to establish purposeful discrimination.Â  See State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1998) (no Batson violation where the State exercised all six of its peremptory strikes against blacks because the explanations were race-neutral); State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1997) (no Batson violation where solicitor had neutral reasons for all five strikes used against males).Â  Thus, this record fails to support the trial judgeâ€™s finding of a Batson violation.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge erred in ruling these strikes violated Batson, and appellant was denied his right to exercise his peremptory challenges.\r\n\r\nId. at 65-66, 512 S.E.2d at 503-04.\r\nIn State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999), the jurors seated in appellantâ€™s case included three white men, five white women, one black man, and three black women.Â  The two alternate jurors, who did not participate in deliberations, were black men.Â  The prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against four black women and one white man.Â  Appellant is a black man.Â  Appellant raised a Batson challenge to the prosecutorâ€™s decision to strike the black women as prospective jurors.Â  The prosecutor stated he struck the first black woman because she was very young and had gone to school with appellant.Â  He struck the second black woman because she had a shoplifting conviction.Â  He struck the fourth black woman because she was unemployed, which meant she had an insufficient stake in the community.Â  The trial judge ruled all those were race-neutral reasons for the\r\nstrikes. The prosecutor declared he struck the third black woman, Tammy Berry, for two reasons: â€œOne reason is that she had prior jury service on a criminal sexual conduct and came back with a not guilty verdict.Â  That wasnâ€™t the main reason.Â  The main reason was that Larry Smith who is a key witness here knows this person, says she is a good person but she is very high strung, a critical type person, opinionated and he didnâ€™t feel like she could deliberate well with the other jurors, would be a polarizing individual.â€Â  Id. at 627, 515 S.E.2d at 90 (footnote omitted).\r\nAppellant argued the first reason given by the prosecutor was pretextual because the prosecutor had accepted Gerald Smith, a white man, who also had returned a not guilty verdict in a criminal case.Â  Smith had sat on a criminal jury eighteen to twenty years earlier, and he thought he remembered that the verdict in the domestic shooting case was not guilty.Â  Berry had sat on a criminal jury five years earlier, and definitely remembered that the verdict in the rape case was not guilty.Â  Appellant argued the second reason given by the prosecutor was pretextual because Berry did not stand up during voir dire to say she knew Larry Williams when venire members were asked whether they knew law enforcement officers involved in the case.Â  The trial judge denied the Batson motion, ruling both the prosecutorâ€™s reasons were racially neutral and not pretextual.\r\nOn appeal, the supreme court concluded appellant did not carry his burden in proving the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination during the jury selection process.Â  The court found:\r\n\r\n[T]he prosecutorâ€™s primary reason for striking Berry was because the lead detective in appellantâ€™s case knew her to be a high-strung, critical person who would be a polarizing force on the jury.Â  That was a race-neutral reason for the strike.Â  Cf. State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (officerâ€™s apparent knowledge that venireperson had anti-law enforcement bias may be race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Smith, 321 S.C. 471, 469 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1996) (trooperâ€™s personal contact with venirepersons and belief they may hold anti-law enforcement bias may be race-neutral reason for strike).Â  Berryâ€™s failure to reveal during voir dire that she was acquainted with the lead detective is irrelevant to the Batson analysis, which focuses upon a partyâ€™s knowledge of a potential juror and reason for exercising a peremptory challenge.\r\n. . . .\r\n. . . [W]e do not believe the prosecutorâ€™s second reason was fundamentally implausible or pretextual.Â  First, Berry and Smith were not similarly situated in that Berry had served on a criminal jury five years earlier and definitely remembered the verdict, while Smith had served on a criminal jury some twenty years earlier and was unsure of the verdict.Â  Second, and more importantly, the circumstances of the jury selection process indicate the prosecutor did not strike potential jurors for racially motivated reasons.Â  While the prosecutor struck four black prospective jurors, he seated four black people on the regular jury and two black alternate jurors.Â  See State v. Dyar, [317 S.C. 77, 452 S.E.2d 603 (1994)] (composition of jury panel is one factor to consider in Batson analysis); State v. Guess, 318 S.C. 269, 457 S.E.2d 6 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding no purposeful discrimination, in part because jury included six members of the minority allegedly offended); State v. Watts, 320 S.C. 377, 465 S.E.2d 359 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding no purposeful discrimination, in part because jury was composed of eight white people and four black people, and prosecutor had struck two white people).\r\nSimilarly, the record contains no indication the prosecutorâ€™s stated reasons for striking the other three black womenâ€”that one was too young and knew appellant, one had a criminal conviction, and one was unemployedâ€”were motivated by purposeful discrimination.Â  See State v. Ford, [334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999)] (lack of employment or place or type of employment may be race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990) (potential jurorâ€™s knowledge of and association with defendant may be race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Dyar, supra (past prosecution of potential juror by particular solicitorâ€™s office may be race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Green, 306 S.C. 94, 409 S.E.2d 785 (1991) (unemployment may be race-neutral reason for a strike); State v. Martinez, 294 S.C. 72, 362 S.E.2d 641 (1987) (unemployment and possible criminal records may be race-neutral reasons for a strike).\r\n\r\nId. at 630-32, 515 S.E.2d at 91.\r\nIn State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 519 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App. 1999), the appellant used nine of ten peremptory strikes to remove white jurors from the venire.Â  The State posited a Batson objection, alleging the defense utilized the strikes in an intentionally discriminatory manner.Â  The trial court then asked defense counsel to give race-neutral reasons for the strikes, to which she responded, â€œA lot of this was just looking at the potential jurors and seeingâ€”if they donâ€™t look at me or if they look with a mean, stern look.â€Â  Id. at 304, 519 S.E.2d at 794.Â  She further explained that she believed those persons who tended to look away or glare were not open-minded, and stated that such veniremen â€œhave already made their minds up, and I donâ€™t want them on the jury.â€Â  Id.Â  While the trial judge admitted counselâ€™s stated explanation â€œpossibly could be reasonable,â€ he determined it was not sufficiently race-neutral.Â  Id.Â  As a result, the court returned the jury panel to the pool, and a new jury was drawn and sworn.Â  The new panel contained four members originally struck by the defense.\r\nOn appeal, the court of appeals determined:\r\n\r\nWe discern no discriminatory intent inherent in the defendantâ€™s explanation.Â  We therefore find the reason asserted by Smalls for his peremptory strikes, that the jurors were either refusing to look or looking in a â€œmean,â€ â€œsternâ€ or â€œaccusatoryâ€ manner, was facially race-neutral, even if perhaps suspect.Â  See State v. Tucker, [334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999)]; State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 413 S.E.2d 323 (1991) (counsel may strike venire persons based on their demeanor and disposition).Â  The trial court erred, therefore, in failing to require the State to carry its burden to present evidence of pretext as prescribed by step three of the Adams/Purkett analysis.Â  See Ford at 66, 512 S.E.2d at 504 (finding opponent of strikes failed to offer evidence of pretext as required by step three of the analysis); Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372 (stating that â€œ[u]nder some circumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible that the judge may determine, at the third step of the analysis, that the explanation was mere pretextâ€) (emphasis added); Purkett, 514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771 (opponent of strike bears ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation); cf. Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. at 55-56, 495 S.E.2d at 208 (â€œredneckâ€ is not race-neutral on its face so there is no need to reach the third step of the analysis).\r\n\r\nId. at 309, 519 S.E.2d at 797.\r\nIn State v. Wright, 354 S.C. 48, 579 S.E.2d 538 (Ct. App. 2003), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), the State exercised peremptory challenges to strike three black jurors.Â  Wright objected and requested a Batson hearing.Â  Specifically, as to Juror 29, the State explained that although she was a bilingual translator, she had a heavy accent, and the State was unsure as to her command of the English language.Â  Wright then responded the State did not strike Juror 123, a white German woman who had a â€œhuge accent.â€Â  Id. at 51, 579 S.E.2d at 540.Â  The State countered that it was under the impression Juror 123 worked in communications at the fire department and would thus have a better grasp of the English language.Â  Based on this dialogue, the circuit court found the Stateâ€™s peremptory strike did not violate Batson, and the jury was seated and sworn.\r\nOn appeal, Wright claimed the circuit court erred by allowing the State to exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of Batson.Â  The court of appeals held:\r\n\r\nViewing the record in light of our standard of review, the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion was not clearly erroneous.Â  Although we recognize Juror 29 and Juror 123 are similarly situated in that they both have foreign accents, the State distinguished them by their observable command of the English language, as well as what the State perceived their occupations to be.Â  These were proper race-neutral considerations.Â  See Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d 907, 918 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding the State is allowed to consider tone, demeanor, facial expression, and any other race-neutral factors when striking jurors).Â  Thus, the circuit court did not err.\r\n\r\nId. at 56, 579 S.E.2d at 542.\r\nIn State v. Flynn, Op. No. 4087 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 27, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 48), after the jury was qualified, defense counsel raised a Batson challenge based on the fact that the State used all its strikes to remove black females from the jury.Â  The State presented its explanations for the strikes.Â  As to Juror 21, the State asserted: â€œâ€˜[She] is a Head Start director. I view that as a very liberal job and thatâ€™s the reason why I struck her.â€™â€Â  Id. at 49.Â  Defense counsel took exception to the Stateâ€™s reasons for striking Juror 21. The State then expounded on its reasons for striking her: â€œâ€˜Your Honor, I believe that is a social welfare kind of program, and as director she is liberal in nature. Itâ€™s a liberal type of attitude and job, and that is why I struck her.â€™â€Â  Id. at 50.Â  The trial court ruled that, given the nature of the case and progress of the trial to that point, it would be possible to consider a Head Start director as an improper juror.Â  The court stated: â€œâ€˜Iâ€™m going to conclude that itâ€™s race neutral, particularly in view of the fact that the Defendant is a young white Caucasian. That particular juror is female, African-American. I conclude thatâ€™s race-neutral.â€™â€Â  Id. at 50.\r\nOn appeal, Flynn argued the trial court erred in not finding the State violated Batson in regard to its treatment of Juror 21. He asserts the State advanced a racial stereotype to justify striking Juror 21.Â  The court of appeals determined: â€œ[T]he State asserted that due to her employment, it believed Juror 21 was â€˜liberal.â€™ As Flynn has offered no evidence other than a conclusory assertion of racial motivation, we find the trial court did not err in failing to find a Batson violation.â€Â  Id. at 51.\r\nVI.Â  Batson Violation/Remedy\r\nAny deviation from the mandated and recognized Batson procedure is NOT a mere peccadillo, but is an egregious judicial corrigendum.Â  Notwithstanding error, the more pertinent query is whether reversal is obligatory.\r\n State v. Adams edifies in regard to the remedy for a Batson violation:\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we do not reverse based on this error. We have not yet ruled on the proper remedy for a trial judgeâ€™s error in finding a Batson violation and quashing the jury.Â  This situation is fundamentally different from one in which the trial judge improperly upholds racially discriminatory peremptory challenges. When the trial court improperly upholds\r\nsuch challenges, there has been a violation of the stricken jurorsâ€™ Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights. Additionally, if the prosecution is the party improperly exercising peremptory challenges that the trial judge upholds, the defendant has been denied a right to a fair and impartial jury of his peers.\r\n  However, where, as here, the trial judge improperly quashes a jury panel, no jurorâ€™s equal protection rights have been violated. An appellate determination that a judge erred in finding a Batson violation means the obvious: No Batson violation occurred, and there was, therefore, no denial of anyoneâ€™s equal protection rights. Moreover, we see no way in which the defendantâ€™s fair trial rights were violated.Â  A defendant has no right to trial by any particular jury.Â  E.g., State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990). When the trial judge quashed the first jury panel, the parties selected a new jury.Â  Adams has voiced no complaints about the new jury.Â  We find that no prejudice resulted from the judgeâ€™s error.\r\n\r\nId. at 125-26, 470 S.E.2d at 372-73.\r\nUnlike in Adams, the Appellants in the instant case have complained about the new jury.\r\nIn State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999), after ruling the trial court erred in finding a Batson violation and quashing the first jury, the supreme court inculcated:\r\n\r\nAfter finding error in the trial judgeâ€™s Batson ruling, the Court of Appeals went on to find reversible error because Shortâ€™s right to exercise peremptory challenges against the two jurors was denied him.Â  The Court of Appeals found no showing of prejudice was required because there was no way to determine with any degree of certainty whether Shortâ€™s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury was abridged.Â  327 S.C. at 335, 489 S.E.2d at 212.\r\nIn finding reversible error, the Court of Appeals adopted the analysis of United States v. Annigoni, 96 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir. 1996), requiring no showing of actual prejudice to reverse for infringement of the federal statutory right to exercise a peremptory challenge.Â  This rule is consistent with that of a clear majority of state courts as well.Â  See, e.g., Mason v. State, 536 So. 2d 127 (Ala. Crim. App. 1988); State v. Huerta, 175 Ariz. 262, 855 P.2d 776 (1993); Hagerman v. State, 613 So. 2d 552 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993); People v. Bennett, 282 Ill.App.3d 975, 218 Ill.Dec. 574, 669 N.E.2d 717 (1996); State v. Kauhi, 86 Hawaiâ€™i 195, 948 P.2d 1036 (1997); Spencer v. State, 20 Md.App. 201, 314 A.2d 727 (1974); Commonwealth v. Roche, 44 Mass.App. 372, 691 N.E.2d 946 (1998); People v. Schmitz, 231 Mich.App. 521, 586 N.W.2d 766 (1998); Arenas v. Gari, 309 N.J.Super. 1, 706 A.2d 736 (1998); Fuson v. State, 105 N.M. 632, 735 P.2d 1138 (1987); City of Dickinson v. Lindstrom, 575 N.W.2d 440 (N.D. 1998); Baker v. English, 324 Or. 585, 932 P.2d 57 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ingber, 516 Pa. 2, 531 A.2d 1101 (1987); Nunfio v. State, 808 S.W.2d 482 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991); State v. Ramos, 211 Wis.2d 12, 564 N.W.2d 328 (1997); Westcom v. Meunier, 164 Vt. 536, 674 A.2d 1267 (1996); Wardell v. McMillan, 844 P.2d 1052 (Wyo. 1992).\r\nTo the contrary, however, there is precedent of this Court indicating a showing of actual prejudice is required to find reversible error in the denial of the right to exercise a peremptory challenge.Â  In State v. Plath, 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981), overruled on other grounds, State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998), we concluded the defendant failed to show prejudice from the denial of a peremptory challenge where there was ample opportunity to examine the juror on voir dire and there was no showing of any bias or lack of impartiality on the part of the juror.Â  Accordingly, we found no reversible error.\r\nWe now overrule Plath and adopt the majority rule that no showing of actual prejudice is required to find reversible error for the denial or impairment of the right to a peremptory challenge.Â  We note that Plath is distinguishable from our other decisions discussing â€œprejudiceâ€ in the denial of a peremptory challenge where the issue actually turned on whether the complaining party had established he was denied the right to exercise a peremptory challenge.Â  Where such a denial was established, we implicitly applied the majority rule discussed above and reversed without a showing of actual prejudice.Â  See State v. Anderson, 276 S.C. 578, 281 S.E.2d 111 (1981) (prejudice in wrongfully limiting number of peremptory challenges where defendant exercised all permitted); Moore v. Jenkins, 304 S.C. 544, 405 S.E.2d 833 (1991) (failure to use side-to-side procedure in allowing peremptory challenges in a case with multiple defendants prejudiced the plaintiff as a matter of law).Â  In cases finding no prejudice, on the other hand, we actually determined the complaining party had not established the denial of a peremptory challenge.Â  See Laury v. Hamilton, 317 S.C. 503, 455 S.E.2d 173 (1995) (no prejudice where party received greater number of strikes than that to which he was entitled under side-to-side method); State v. Holland, 261 S.C. 488, 201 S.E.2d 118 (1973) (no prejudice in limiting number of peremptory challenges where defendants used fewer than allowed).Â  Before reversible error can be found, the complaining party must of course establish the denial of his right to exercise a peremptory challenge.\r\n\r\nShort, 333 S.C. at 476-78, 511 S.E.2d at 360-61 (footnote omitted).\r\nThereafter, in State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500 (1999), the supreme court explicated:\r\n\r\nThe State argues, even if the trial judge erred in finding a Batson violation, the error was harmless because appellant failed to show the second jury was not impartial.Â  This Court recently addressed this precise issue.Â  See State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 511 S.E.2d 358 (1999) (announcing the appropriate remedy for the denial of the right to exercise a peremptory challenge).Â  Where such a denial is established, no showing of actual prejudice is required to find reversible error.Â  Id. Â Therefore, because appellant established he was wrongfully denied the right to exercise a peremptory challenge, we reverse his conviction.\r\n\r\nId. at 66, 512 S.E.2d at 504; see also State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 309, 519 S.E.2d 793, 797 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œno showing of actual prejudice is required to find reversible error for the denial or impairment of the right to a peremptory challenge.â€); cf. State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 444, 513 S.E.2d 385 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting that any Batson violation in regards to a possible alternate juror is harmless where an alternate was not needed for deliberations).\r\n\r\n State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 593 S.E.2d 486 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (March 3, 2005), is instructive.Â  After the initial jury selection, the State moved for a Batson hearing.Â  The trial court found a Batson violation.Â  The first jury was quashed and a redraw of the jury followed.Â  The ensuing redraw resulted in no Batson challenge, and significantly, none of the jurors struck by defense counsel during the initial jury selection were seated on the second jury.Â  On appeal, Rayfield argued the trial court erred in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion.Â  The court of appeals held:\r\nWe agree, but we are constrained to conclude that Rayfield ultimately was not legally prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s error.\r\n. . . .\r\n. . . It was error for the trial court to grant the Stateâ€™s Batson motion.\r\nWe nevertheless find no reversible error pursuant to the supreme court precedent of State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  In Adams, the trial court erred in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion and quashing the jury.Â  Because the jury ultimately selected had none of the persons defense counsel struck from the first jury panel, the supreme court found â€œno prejudice resulted from the judgeâ€™s errorâ€ and affirmed Adamsâ€™ convictions.Â  Id. at 126, 470 S.E.2d at 373.Â  In so holding, the court in Adams recognized that no jurorâ€™s equal protection rights are violated where the trial court improperly quashes a jury panel.Â  In addition, the court in Adams referenced the settled principle that â€œ[a] defendant has no right to trial by any particular jury.â€Â  Id. Â But cf. Ford, 334 S.C. at 66, 512 S.E.2d at 504 (holding that reversal and granting of a new trial is a proper remedy where the trial court erred in finding defendant violated Batson in striking certain jurors and any challenged juror was seated on the second jury).\r\n\r\nId. at 500-04, 593 S.E.2d at 488-90.\r\nVII.Â  The Extant Record\r\nAnalyzing the first jury and the composition and pattern of strikes, I come to the ineluctable conclusion that the trial judge did not properly conduct the Batson hearing.Â  The erroneous procedure utilized in the first Batson hearing was exacerbated in the selection of the second jury, thereby mandating a reversal.\r\nThe record is devoid of any palliative factor mitigating against reversal.\r\nI VOTE to REVERSE.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appellant Reggie James was also found guilty of malicious injury to personal property; however, after the verdict, and despite appropriate motions made during the course of the trial, the trial court decided to revisit this issue and found â€œno testimonyâ€ of vandalism.Â  Accordingly, the court directed a verdict of acquittal as to this charge.\r\n[2]Â  Â Â Â Â Â  A defendant charged with burglary is entitled to ten peremptory challenges and the State is entitled to five.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1110 (Supp. 2005).Â  Codefendants, tried jointly, are entitled to twenty peremptory challenges.Â  Id.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  See also J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127, 146 (1994) (recognizing the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a juror on the basis of gender).Â Â  \r\n[4]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We do not suggest that counselâ€™s perception of the Patrick Henry School has any validity.Â  Perceptions and perceived biasesâ€”whether true or notâ€”are at the heart of virtually every peremptory challenge.Â  The striking of a juror based on perceptions of bias will generally be upheld unless it is established that the reason for the strike is impermissibly based on race or gender.Â  The Batson burden of proof framework as set forth in Pukett-AdamsÂ  seeks to achieve a proper balance between a partyâ€™s ability to peremptorily strike a potential juror while allowing the opponent of the strike to prove purposeful racial or gender discrimination. \r\n[5] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Although we need not find prejudice to reverse this error, prejudice may be found in juryâ€™s guilty verdict against Appellant James for the offense of malicious injury to personal property.Â  The trial court set aside the guilty verdict, finding â€œno testimonyâ€ of vandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4117","title":"Williams v.

Jordan and John Taylor (Respondents) on their claims for slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, intentional interference with contractual relations, and loss of consortium.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis matter revolves around three incidents at Buford High School involving Philip Williams and his wife, Barbara, and their children, LeAnn and Clark.Â  Both Philip and Barbara were employed by the Lancaster County School District during the 2000-2001 school year.Â  Philip was employed as the head football coach and athletic director, as well as a teacher at Buford High School (Buford).Â  Barbara was a teacher at Buford.Â  LeAnn and Clark attended Buford.Â  Dr. James Jordan was the principal of Buford, Mr. John Hardin was an assistant principal at Buford, and Mr. John Taylor was the Superintendent of the Lancaster County School District (District)Â  The incidents involve LeAnnâ€™s class ranking, a situation involving rumors that circulated after Philip was discovered in a locked bathroom with a school secretary, and a test grade initially given to Clark.\r\nDuring the 2000-2001 school year, the State Department of Education (Department) implemented a uniform grading system.Â  So that no student in that yearâ€™s senior class would be damaged by the implementation of the new system, principals were given flexibility and allowed to use a dual system with that class in ranking them.Â  Apparently, the staff at Buford had been working to insure that both LeAnn and another student remained tied for the number one spot, which would result in significant scholarship monies.Â  However, with the implementation of the new uniform system, LeAnn was not ranked number one.Â  Further, although LeAnn had been ranked number one along with the other student under the old system, LeAnn dropped a course during the school year and was no longer tied with the other student under the old system.Â  LeAnn had dropped one of her courses because she was enrolled in two different weightlifting classes during the same semester, which was a violation of Department regulations that prohibited students from receiving dual credit.Â  \r\nAround February 2001, the Williamses learned LeAnn slipped to number two in her class.Â  Philip went to LeAnnâ€™s guidance counselor, who told him he would have to speak with the principal, Dr. Jordan.Â  Because Philip was not getting along with Dr. Jordan at that time, Barbara approached Dr. Jordan about the matter, which resulted in some heated words between the two.Â  Thereafter, LeAnnâ€™s guidance counselor, Mr. Hudson, was instructed by Assistant Principal Hardin or Dr. Jordan to not discuss LeAnnâ€™s situation with the Williamses unless Mr. Hardin or Dr. Jordan was present.Â  Subsequently, the Williamses made three trips to the Superintendentâ€™s office to look into the matter and called multiple times.Â  According to the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction, Dr. Burns, she told the Williamses they would work with them to insure LeAnn would have every opportunity to earn credit and have a full schedule.Â  Dr. Jordan contacted Dr. Burns and asked that LeAnn be allowed to take a course in service learning that would grant her credit and place her back in a tie with the other student.Â  He also contacted the middle school principal to arrange for LeAnn to perform community service and obtain the necessary credit.Â  While the Williamses were still not sure of LeAnnâ€™s standing up to the week of graduation, LeAnn was afforded the opportunity to do the extra work, received the necessary credit, and ultimately graduated number one and was co-valedictorian of her senior class.Â  \r\nPrior to May 16, 2001, Mr. Hardin had warned Philip that that there were rumors circulating around the school about Philip and Cheryl Blackwell, a secretary at Buford, spending an inordinate amount of time together behind closed doors.Â  Mr. Hardin told Philip the women in the office thought â€œthere was something going on betweenâ€ him and Cheryl, and instructed both Philip and Cheryl to avoid this apparently compromising situation.Â  Around May 15 or 16, 2001, the Williamses were informed by one of LeAnnâ€™s teacherâ€™s that her permanent record showed she was ranked as number two in her class.Â  Barbara suggested to Philip that he go see Cheryl to see if they could obtain transcripts or grade printouts to verify where LeAnn stood.Â  \r\nAccording to Philip, when he went to see Cheryl in her office, he found her distraught after a phone argument she had with her soon to be ex-husband.Â  Philip asked Cheryl to go with him to the health room, where he could speak with her in private.Â  He suggested Cheryl go into the bathroom to gain her composure, as he needed her help.Â  While he was standing in the doorway to the bathroom, he heard keys rattling.Â  Because he held documents in his hand that Cheryl had printed out concerning LeAnnâ€™s grade points and he did not want anyone to discover him with the documents, he panicked, stepped inside the bathroom, and shut the door.Â  This occurred around 3:30 or 3:45 in the afternoon when school was out.Â  When Mr. Hardin shook the door, Philip told him he would be out in a minute.Â  Philip walked out into the hall, Mr. Hardin looked up and down the hall, and Cheryl came walking out about two or three minutes later.Â  Mr. Hardin then escorted Cheryl to his office.Â  When Mr. Hardin later asked Philip what was going on in the bathroom, Philip told him he was there going to the bathroom, and may have told Mr. Hardin he had diarrhea.Â  Philip admitted that this was a lie.Â  Philip conceded he did not want to be discovered in the bathroom with Cheryl, or any other female, because he was a married man and it did not look appropriate.Â  \r\nMr. Hardin testified he was looking for some supplies when he went to the health room and, as he got out his keys and opened the door, he heard a lot of noise.Â  After entering the room, he noticed the bathroom door was closed.Â  He reached for the handle and discovered the door was locked.Â  He knocked on the door, and Philip indicated he was in the bathroom.Â  Mr. Hardin walked out into the hallway and Philip then came out saying he did not feel good that day.Â  After Philip began walking away, Mr. Hardin motioned for Dr. Jordan to come to him.Â  He believed there was more than one person in the bathroom because of all the noise he had heard. Mr. Hardin then opened the door to the health room and knocked on the bathroom door, at which time Cheryl walked out.Â  \r\nPhilip met with Dr. Jordan and Mr. Hardin later that afternoon in Dr. Jordanâ€™s office. Â Philip stated the two men â€œwere screaming and holleringâ€ at him saying they knew about him and Cheryl all along.Â  Mr. Hardin testified that when confronted about what he was doing in the bathroom with Cheryl, Philip stated Cheryl had emotional problems and was upset and that he was trying to console her.Â  Based on this incident, as well as Philipâ€™s previous record at the school, Dr. Jordan informed Philip he would â€œprobably recommend that [Philip] be terminated.â€Â  Dr. Jordan testified that after his meetings with Mr. Hardin and Cheryl and Mr. Hardin and Philip that afternoon, he discussed the matter with Superintendent Taylor.Â  \r\nShortly after this incident, while Cheryl was away from work, a school secretary was looking for something relating to Cherylâ€™s job responsibilities when she found a letter in Cherylâ€™s desk that alluded to a romantic relationship with a co-employee.Â  Although the letter was not signed, there were references in the letter that led Dr. Jordan to believe that it was authored by Philip.Â  Dr. Jordan delivered a copy of the letter to Superintendent Taylor and discussed it with him and Mr. Hardin.\r\nOn June 22, 2001, before any action was taken by the school district on Philipâ€™s employment, Philip submitted a letter of resignation.Â  Philip informed the district he had accepted a teaching and coaching position at a high school in Charlotte, North Carolina.Â  He started his job with that high school in mid-August of that year.Â  \r\nDuring the next school year, the Williamsesâ€™ son, Clark, experienced a problem at Buford.Â  One day, Clark became ill during school.Â  He was given some medicine and went to the health room.Â  During this time, Clark missed a Spanish test.Â  That day was a pep rally day.Â  Clark went to see about retrieving his book bag, and as he was returning to the health room, one of the office staff instructed him to go to the gym.Â  While in the gym, Clark was asked to participate in a slam-dunk contest by standing on the court while another attempted to dunk the ball.Â  After doing this, he was confronted by his Spanish teacher about missing the test but participating in the rally.Â  Clark was initially given a zero on the test.Â  Philip maintained that Dr. Jordan and Mr. Hardin instructed the teacher to give Clark a zero.Â  However, Clark subsequently was able to convince his teacher he was ill that day and he was allowed to take the test, ultimately making a one hundred on it.Â  \r\nPhilip and Barbara individually filed suit against the school district, Dr. Jordan, and Mr. Taylor, and their actions were subsequently consolidated.Â  The Williamsesâ€™ complaints loosely allege causes of action for slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, and loss of consortium.Â  \r\nRespondents moved for summary judgment as to all of the claims.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion, finding, among other things, (1) there was no evidence of any publication by any of the respondents alleging Philip committed adultery, (2) the Williamses offered insufficient evidentiary support for their allegation that the respondents acted intentionally or recklessly to inflict severe emotional distress upon them, the record was devoid of any evidence the Respondentsâ€™ actions were so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society, and there was no evidence of record the Williamses suffered emotional distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it, (3) the claims for breach of contract and intentional interference with contractual relations failed as a matter of law as the record demonstrates Philip voluntarily resigned and he failed to pursue and exhaust his administrative remedies,[2] (4) Barbaraâ€™s loss of consortium claim was derivative and failed since Philip had no claim against Respondents, and (5) Barbaraâ€™s claim for slander was similarly barred as she offered no evidence of the publication of a slanderous statement about her by the Respondents.Â  \r\nThe only issue raised on appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to the Williamsesâ€™ causes of action for slander, outrage, and loss of consortium against Dr. Jordan.Â  Thus, the Williamses do not appeal from the granting of summary judgment to Superintendent John Taylor and the Lancaster County School District as to any of their claims.Â  Nor do they appeal the dismissal of all the contract-related claims.Â  Accordingly, the only issues remaining on appeal involve the Williamsesâ€™ claims for slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium against Dr. Jordan alone. Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  â€œA motion for summary judgment shall be granted â€˜if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Slander\r\nThe Williamses contend the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on their claim of slander against Dr. Jordan.Â  They contend there is evidence in the record that Dr. Jordan and John Hardin accused Philip of committing adultery with Cheryl in separate meetings they had with Philip and Cheryl on the afternoon of the incident.Â  They contend the meetings occurred after school had ended for the day, no other persons were present at the meetings, and no other persons were in the area of the meetings.Â  They further maintain the record shows rumors of adultery on the part of Philip were immediately spread throughout the community.Â  Accordingly, they argue the only individuals who had knowledge of the bathroom incident were Dr. Jordan and Mr. Hardin, and this is indirect evidence of publication of a slanderous statement.Â  They further assert that the unsigned letter found in Cherylâ€™s desk was â€œpublished to person or persons known and unknown to [the Williamses],â€ the â€œ[p]ublication was accomplished by transmitting the â€˜letterâ€™ by tele-facsimile,â€ and the letter was discussed between John Taylor and Dr. Jordan.Â  The Williamses thus contend there is evidence of record to show Dr. Jordan published defamatory and slanderous communications about them.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe tort of defamation allows a complaining party to recover for injury to his reputation as the result of a false communication to others about him, made by the defendant.Â  Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 508, 506 S.E.2d 497, 501 (1998).Â  â€œSlander is a spoken defamation, while libel is a written defamation or one accomplished through actions or conduct.â€Â  Id.Â  In order to prove defamation, a party must show:Â  (1) a false and defamatory statement was made; (2) the unprivileged publication of the statement to a third party; (3) the publisher was at fault; and (4) either the statement was actionable irrespective of harm or the publication of the statement caused special harm.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the record is devoid of any evidence of any publication of a slanderous statement made by Dr. Jordan as to either Philip or Barbara Williams.[3]Â  When asked if he knew whether Dr. Jordan had ever discussed a purported affair between him and Cheryl, other than with Philip in Dr. Jordanâ€™s office, Philip responded, â€œI have no knowledge of that.â€Â  Further, in referring to the rumors concerning him and Cheryl, Philip stated, â€œI donâ€™t know how it got on the street, but itâ€™s out there.â€Â  When asked if he could name any person that would testify to any employee of the District telling them that he was having an affair with Cheryl, Philip indicated he knew of a Board member who referenced the alleged affair in a poem, but other than that, he could not say any employee of the District had said he was having an affair with Cheryl.Â  \r\nAlso, there is evidence of record that numerous other employees, as well as possibly a parent and some students, were in the office area right after Philip and Cheryl were discovered locked in the bathroom and Cheryl was escorted to the office.Â  These individuals at least had an opportunity to gain knowledge of the incident at that time.Â  Further, at least two other office personnel became aware of the bathroom incident when one of the employees came back into the school looking for Cheryl and saw Cheryl walking down the hall with Mr. Hardin and Dr. Jordan, and the next day told the other employee that Cheryl and Philip had been found in the health room bathroom together.Â  There is also evidence Superintendent Taylor was informed of the bathroom incident that afternoon.Â  Finally, Philip acknowledged that Mr. Hardin informed him at some time prior to the bathroom incident that others in the school office thought there was something going on between Cheryl and Philip and these employees had been talking about it.Â  Deposition testimony from other school employees confirmed that rumors had circulated among staff as well as students at the high school about a possible romantic relationship between Philip and Cheryl prior to the bathroom incident.Â  \r\nAs noted, the Williamses only challenge the granting of summary judgment to Dr. Jordan. Based on the evidence of record, there were numerous individuals who were aware of the bathroom incident besides Dr. Jordan.Â  Any one of those people could have been responsible for the rumor of an illicit relationship between Philip and Cheryl.Â  The record simply does not support the Williamsesâ€™ assertion that the only individuals who had knowledge of the incident were Dr. Jordan and John Hardin.Â Â  Further, the Williamses have conceded that John Hardin had knowledge of the incident. Thus, the rumors cannot be said to have only been possibly attributable to Dr. Jordan, and the Williamsesâ€™ argument concerning indirect evidence fails.Â  \r\nThe Williamses also appear to argue Dr. Jordan was responsible for the publication of the letter found in Cherylâ€™s desk because the evidence shows this letter was faxed â€œto person or persons known and unknown,â€ and publication was thus accomplished by tele-facsimile.Â  However, the Williamses failed to point to any evidence establishing that Dr. Jordan was responsible for faxing the letter.Â  The Williamses also fail to name anyone to whom the letter was faxed.Â  Without an unprivileged publication to a third party, the Williamsesâ€™ claim for slander fails.\r\nAccordingly, we find the Williamsesâ€™ claim for slander fails as a matter of law, as they cannot establish a defamatory statement published by Dr. Jordan to a third party.Â  See Moody v. McLellan, 295 S.C. 157, 163-64, 367 S.E.2d 449, 453 (Ct. App. 1988) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment for defamation claim due to appellantâ€™s failure to come forward with evidence respondent actually made the alleged statements).Â  Because the Williamses cannot show the publication of a defamatory statement by Dr. Jordan, we decline to address the rest of the elements for defamation, including whether Philip Williams, as athletic director, teacher, and head football coach, is a public figure required to establish constitutional malice.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nNext, the Williamses maintain the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  They point to the incidents involving LeAnn and Clark in contending Dr. Jordanâ€™s conduct amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes that â€œoneâ€™s wilful, malicious conduct proximately causing anotherâ€™s emotional distress may be actionableâ€ as intentional infliction of emotional distress or the tort of outrage.Â  Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 161, 276 S.E.2d 776, 778 (1981).Â  In order to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a party must establish (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress, or was certain or substantially certain such distress would result from his conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions of defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.Â  Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, 401, 596 S.E.2d 42, 48 (2004).Â  Initially, it is for the trial court to determine whether the defendantâ€™s conduct may be considered so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery, and only where reasonable minds might differ should the issue be submitted to the jury.Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Intâ€™l, Inc., 320 S.C. 316, 324, 465 S.E.2d 112, 117 (Ct. App. 1995), affâ€™d as modified, 328 S.C. 128, 492 S.E.2d 103 (1997). \r\nWe find the Williamses have failed to present any factual allegations to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  As far as the situation with LeAnnâ€™s class ranking, we find no merit to the Williamsesâ€™ claim. While both Philip and Barbara testified to problems in dealing with Dr. Jordan on the matter, Dr. Jordan testified, and there is no evidence to the contrary, that he contacted the District office requesting LeAnn be allowed to take the service-learning course that would grant her credit and place her back in a tie with the other student.Â  He also contacted the middle school principal to arrange for LeAnn to perform work to obtain the necessary credit for the service-learning course.Â  Additionally, it is undisputed that when LeAnn graduated she was ranked first in her class and was co-valedictorian.Â  As to the incident involving Clark, the record shows, once Clark explained the matter to his teacher, he was allowed to take the test and ultimately made a one hundred on it.Â  We agree with the trial judge that (1) there is insufficient evidence of an intentional or reckless act by Dr. Jordan which inflicted severe emotional distress, (2) the record is devoid of evidence of extreme or outrageous conduct by Dr. Jordan exceeding all possible bounds of decency and atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community, and (3) there is no evidence the Williamses suffered emotional distress so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.Â  There is simply nothing in Dr. Jordanâ€™s actions that could be characterized as extreme and outrageous; as exceeding possible bounds of decency; or which might be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Loss of Consortium \r\nFinally, the Williamses maintain the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to their respective claims for loss of consortium.Â  They allege Dr. Jordanâ€™s actions caused them emotional strain and disrupted their marital life.Â  We find no error.\r\nAlthough Philip brought a claim for loss of consortium in his complaint, the trial court did not rule on the issue and Philip failed to make a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP to alter or amend the judgment on that ground.Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 620, 533 S.E.2d 886, 893 (2000) (stating an issue must have been ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding an issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on a question and the appellant fails to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment on that ground). Â Â \r\nAs to Barbaraâ€™s claim, while her action for loss of consortium is not derivative, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this claim as well.Â  Our supreme court has recognized that a loss of consortium claim is not derivative, but is a distinct, independent cause of action.Â  Barnette v. Adams Bros. Logging, Inc., 355 S.C. 588, 595 n.4, 586 S.E.2d 572, 576 n.4 (2003) (citing Preer v. Mims, 323 S.C. 516, 521, 476 S.E.2d 472, 474 (1996).Â  However, there must be some intentional or tortious conduct for a loss of consortium claim to stand.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (2005) (providing â€œ[a]ny person may maintain an action for damages arising from an intentional or tortious violation of the right to companionship, aid, society, and services of his or her spouseâ€).Â  Barbaraâ€™s claim for loss of consortium fails for the same reason the claims for slander and outrage fail, namely, her inability to establish evidence to support the elements required under the claim.Â  First, Barbara fails to delineate any specific actions by Dr. Jordan amounting to an intentional or tortious violation of her rights.Â  Even if we were to assume she is relying on the acts complained of in the Williamsesâ€™ slander and outrage claims, we have already determined there is insufficient evidence of any slanderous or outrageous conduct by Dr. Jordan in these matters.Â  We simply find no evidence of record to support Barbaraâ€™s assertion that Dr. Jordan committed an intentional or tortious injury to her right to the companionship, aid, society, and services of her husband.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nViewing the evidence and all factual inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the Williamses, we find there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and Dr. Jordan is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on the slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium claims.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Barbara Williams withdrew her contract claims at the summary judgment hearing.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; The Williamses have failed to allege any slanderous statement concerning Mrs. Williams and the record is devoid of any such statement.Â  See Burns v. Gardner, 328 S.C. 608, 615, 493 S.E.2d 356, 359-60 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding defamatory statement must be shown to be about the plaintiff or be such that the person hearing it will be able to understand the statement refers to the plaintiff).Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4118","title":"Richardson v.

Young, Jr., of Sumter, for Appellants.\r\nSteven Smith McKenzie, of Manning, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Donald Hawkins Construction, Inc., and Donald Hawkins (Appellants) appeal a jury verdict, arguing the trial court erred in excluding statements by a deceased co-defendant as hearsay after admitting other statements, unfavorable to their case, by the same co-defendant.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nJames and Karolina Richardson purchased a home from Appellants in 1999.Â  After moving in, the Richardsons noticed several cosmetic and structural problems with the home, especially regarding some tile flooring that was continually cracking.Â  Initially, Appellants responded to the Richardsonsâ€™ complaints by sending someone to repair the problems.Â  As the problems continued, however, Appellants ceased responding to the Richardsonsâ€™ service requests.Â  In early 2001, the Richardsons retained legal counsel who contacted Appellants by letter asking that the home repairs be completed.Â  Appellants did not respond.\r\nOn March 12, 2001, the Richardsonsâ€™ residence was severely damaged by fire.Â  Investigators concluded the fire was caused by arson.Â  After a year of investigation, a break in the case led the police to Joseph Taylor, an employee of Appellants.Â  On May 21, 2002, the police questioned Taylor about the arson.Â  Following questioning, Taylor gave the police a written statement (Statement One) in which he claimed to have overheard his employer, Donald Hawkins, offer a coworker, James Hodge, $2000 to burn down the Richardsonsâ€™ home.Â  According to Statement One, subsequent conversations between Taylor and Hodge confirmed that Hodge carried out the plan to some degree of success.\r\nDue to investigatorsâ€™ suspicions that Taylor was more involved in the arson than he revealed in Statement One, he was interviewed again later that afternoon.Â  Following this interview, Taylor submitted another written statement to the police (Statement Two).Â  In Statement Two, Taylor admitted Hawkins approached both him and Hodge and offered them $2,000 to burn down the Richardsonsâ€™ home.Â  Together, they decided the best time to commit the arson.Â  While Taylor acted as lookout, Hodge entered the crawl space of the home and ignited a jug filled with flammable liquid.Â  The following day, Hodge told Taylor that, because the house was not completely destroyed, Hawkins gave him only half of the promised $2000.Â  Taylor claimed he never received compensation from Hodge or Hawkins for his help in committing the arson.\r\nTwo days after giving the police the written statements, Taylor wrote and signed the following statement (Statement Three) before two witnesses and a notary:\r\n\r\nI Joseph Taylor has [sic] never been paid by Donnie Hawkins for doing anything illeagle [sic].Â  Donnie paided [sic] me for subcontracting carpentry work only.Â  I have never heard or seen him pay anyone to do anything illeagle [sic]!\r\n\r\nAccording to Taylorâ€™s mother, Sharon Preu, Taylor visited her shortly after being questioned by the police.Â  Preu claims Taylor told her the police â€œhad him in Sumter all day long and . . . cussed at him.â€Â  Preu contends that Taylor stated he was promised leniency and no jail time if he confessed to the arson, so he â€œstated that him and Mr. Hodge had done it . . . [but] that it was all a lie, [he stated] they had offered him two years probation if he was to go along with itâ€ (Statement Four).Â  After discussing the events with Preu, Taylor spoke to an attorney, turned himself in to the police, and was released on a personal recognizance bond.\r\nThe Richardsons consented to having all criminal charges regarding the arson dropped in order to pursue civil charges against those allegedly involved.Â  A civil suit was filed against Taylor, Hodge, Hawkins, and Donald Hawkins Construction, Inc.Â  Taylor was served a summons and complaint, but failed to file an answer.Â  In May 2003, the Richardsons filed an affidavit of default as to defendant Taylor.Â  In January 2004, before the Richardsonsâ€™ case went to trial, Taylor died in an automobile accident.\r\nIn September 2004, the circuit court ruled on several pre-trial matters, including the admissibility of Statements One, Two, and Three.Â  The court first ruled on the status of the Richardsonsâ€™ case against Taylorâ€™s estate, represented after his death by Preu.Â  The court found that Taylorâ€™s failure to answer the Richardsonsâ€™ complaint prior to his death put his estate in the procedural posture of having admitted all of the allegations contained in the complaint.Â  As to Statements One and Two, the court found them admissible against the remaining defendants under the statements against interest exception to hearsay described in Rule 804 (b)(3), SCRE.Â  The circuit court, however, excluded Statement Three under a Rule 403, SCRE, analysis, concluding that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice because, due to his default, Taylor was deemed to have admitted all allegations in the complaint.\r\nUpon a contemporaneous objection by the defense at trial, the circuit revised its basis for the admission of Statement One.Â  The circuit court found Statement One admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and furtherance of a conspiracy pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E), SCRE.Â  The circuit court upheld its ruling in limine on Statement Two, admitting the statement under the statement against interest exception to hearsay.Â  During the course of trial, the defense also sought to present the testimony of Preu concerning Taylorâ€™s Statement Four.Â  The circuit court found that Statement Four was classic hearsay and did not fall within an established exception to the hearsay rule; thus, it was inadmissible.\r\nAt the conclusion of trial, the jury found the defendants liable and awarded the Richardsons $84,758 in actual damages and $150,000 in punitive damages against Hawkins Construction; $5,500 in actual damages and $5,000 in punitive damages against Hodge; and $5,500 in actual damages and $250,000 in punitive damages against Hawkins.Â  The jury did not award the Richardsons any damages against Taylorâ€™s estate.Â  Hawkins Construction and Hawkins appeal the verdict.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and absent a clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Peterson v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in excluding Taylorâ€™s arguable recantations of his confession, while admitting those statements which address the defendantsâ€™ culpability.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough the rule is rarely addressed in South Carolina case law, we conclude these statements fall soundly within Rule 806, SCRE, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\nRULE 806.Â  ATTACKING AND SUPPORTING CREDIBILITY OF DECLARANT\r\nWhen a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E) has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.Â  Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the declarantâ€™s hearsay statement, is not subject to any requirement that the declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to deny or explain.\r\n\r\nWe believe Taylorâ€™s Statements Three and Four fit squarely within the mandates of Rule 806.Â  Statements One and Two were first admitted into evidence under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) and as an exception to the hearsay rule under Rule 804(b)(3).Â  Pursuant to Rule 806 and basic concepts of fairness, the defense should have then been allowed to impeach the unavailable declarant with evidence of his statements that were inconsistent with Statements One and Two (evidence which would have certainly been explored for impeachment purposes had Taylor testified as a witness).\r\nFurthermore, we do not believe Taylorâ€™s status as a defaulting party should bear so heavily on his co-defendants as to warrant the exclusion of all evidence favorable to their defense.Â  Generally, an admission by a party, procedurally or otherwise, applies only to the admitting party.Â  See, e.g., Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 81, 552 S.E.2d 767, 770 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œDue process concerns prohibit estopping litigants who never had a chance to present their evidence and arguments on a claim . . . .â€).Â  Although Taylor defaulted in failing to timely answer the Richardsonsâ€™ complaint and was thus procedurally deemed to have admitted its allegations, defendants Hawkins Construction, Hawkins, and Hodge have not had an opportunity to present their evidence inconsistent with Taylorâ€™s admissions.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s ruling excluding Taylorâ€™s inconsistent statements on the basis of his default essentially bars Taylorâ€™s co-defendants from rebutting the case against them which relied so heavily on Taylorâ€™s inculpatory statements.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the jury verdict in favor of the Richardsons is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for a new trial.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
