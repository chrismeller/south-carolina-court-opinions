C. Buddy Nicholson, Jr., Circuit \r\n  Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3574\r\nSubmitted November 4, 2002 â€“ Filed December \r\n  9, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDarryl D. Smalls, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\nS. Kirkpatrick Morgan, Jr. of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Knight Textiles appeals an \r\n  order of the circuit court requiring it to provide certain medical treatment \r\n  recommended by Billy Risingerâ€™s physician for work-related injuries.Â  Knight \r\n  argues the commission erred in finding that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-80 does not \r\n  allow an employer to request an independent medical examination of an injured \r\n  employee when a final order of the commission has been issued and the employer \r\n  is paying benefits pursuant to the final order.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nRisinger sustained a severe injury to his lower \r\n  back and spine when he slipped and fell off a dock area and landed on a metal \r\n  ramp while working for Knight.Â  Risinger was referred to Dr. Talley Parrott, \r\n  an orthopedic surgeon, in January 1998 for treatment.Â  Dr. Parrott recommended \r\n  surgical intervention for Risingerâ€™s right radicular pain and right disc herniation.Â  \r\n  Knight, however, requested a second opinion from a neurosurgeon, Dr. Franklin \r\n  Epstein.Â  Dr. Epstein opined that Risingerâ€™s pain was â€œincapacitatingâ€ and recommended \r\n  a disc excision â€œin association with an interbody fusion.â€Â  Dr. Epstein performed \r\n  surgery in April 1998.Â  \r\nIn August 1999, the single commissioner determined that Risinger \r\n  was totally and permanently disabled.Â  The commissionerâ€™s order required that \r\n  Knight be â€œfinancially responsible for . . . lifetime medical benefits for [Risingerâ€™s] \r\n  compensable injury components per South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60.â€Â  At \r\n  the time the order was issued, Dr. Epstein was Risingerâ€™s authorized treating \r\n  physician.Â  Subsequent to the order, Dr. Epstein prescribed certain medications \r\n  and referred Risinger to Dr. David Steiner for chronic pain and depression.Â  \r\n  Knight, however, refused to provide the medical treatment as recommended by \r\n  Dr. Epstein and Dr. Steiner.Â  \r\nIn February 2000, Risinger filed a Form 50 requesting payment \r\n  for the additional medical treatment.Â  Knight filed a Form 51 denying the additional \r\n  treatment and requesting an independent medical evaluation.Â  The single commissioner \r\n  found Knight was financially responsible for the medical treatment recommended \r\n  by Dr. Epstein and Dr. Steiner.Â  The commissioner also found S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-15-80 inapplicable when a final order of the commission has been issued \r\n  and the carrier is paying benefits pursuant to that order.Â  The full commission \r\n  affirmed the single commissioner.Â  Knight then appealed to the circuit court, \r\n  which affirmed the full commission.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œJudicial review of a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision \r\n  is governed by the substantial evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act.â€Â  Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 246, 498 S.E.2d 650, \r\n  653 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, \r\n  447 S.E.2d 841 (1994)).Â  â€œWe may not substitute our judgment for that of the \r\n  commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse \r\n  if the decision is affected by an error of law.â€Â  Brown v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  341 S.C. 611, 614, 535 S.E.2d 445, 447 (Ct. App. 2000) (cert. granted \r\n  May 23, 2001)(citation omitted).Â  â€œWe may reverse or modify a decision if the \r\n  findings and conclusions of the agency are affected by error of law, clearly \r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the \r\n  whole record, or arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion \r\n  or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nKnight first contends the circuit court erred in \r\n  finding that it was not entitled to an independent medical evaluation of Risinger.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Knight argues that the circuit court and the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  commission erred in finding that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-80 \r\n  [2]  does not provide for an independent medical evaluation when a final \r\n  order has been issued and the employer/carrier is paying benefits pursuant to \r\n  a final order of the commission.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn this case, the workersâ€™ compensation commission \r\n  affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s finding that section 42-15-80 does not apply \r\n  when a final order has been issued and the carrier is paying benefitsÂ  pursuant \r\n  to a final order.Â  In this state, â€œ[t]he construction of a statute by the agency \r\n  charged with its administration should be accorded great deference and will \r\n  not be overruled without a compelling reason.â€Â  Vulcan Materials Co. v. Greenville \r\n  County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 342 S.C. 480, 496, 536 S.E.2d 892, 900 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000) (citations omitted).Â  We do not find that this case presents a compelling \r\n  reason to ignore the commissionâ€™s interpretation of the statute.Â  Moreover, \r\n  Knight chose Dr. Epstein to provide a second opinion concerning Risingerâ€™s condition. \r\n  Knight now refuses to pay for Dr. Epsteinâ€™s treatment and referral treatment \r\n  arguing it is entitled to yet another â€œsecondâ€ opinion.Â Â  Because we believe \r\n  Knight has already received the very relief it seeks, i.e., a second \r\n  opinion regarding Risingerâ€™s treatment, we find no merit to the argument that \r\n  it is entitled to what would effectively be a third opinion.\r\nFinally, we believe Knightâ€™s interpretation of section 42-15-80 \r\n  would lead to an absurd result.Â  See Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle \r\n  Beach Election Commâ€™n, 342 S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œ[H]owever \r\n  plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts \r\n  will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly \r\n  absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would \r\n  defeat the plain legislative intention.â€) (citation omitted).Â  Under Knightâ€™s \r\n  interpretation of the statute, the employer/carrier would be able to continue \r\n  to seek a new doctorâ€™s opinion each time it did not like the opinion of the \r\n  claimantâ€™s doctor.Â  This would allow the employer/carrier to â€œshop aroundâ€ indefinitely \r\n  until it found a favorable opinion, often sacrificing much needed treatment.Â  \r\n  We do not believe this result was intended by the legislature.Â  See id.Â  \r\n\r\nKnight also argues the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  it was no longer entitled to control Risingerâ€™s medical treatment pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985).Â  We disagree.\r\nKnight argues that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 obligates \r\n  Risinger to accept treatment from a treating physician of its choice.Â  Section \r\n  42-15-60 states in part:\r\n\r\nIn cases in which total and permanent disability results, \r\n  reasonable and necessary nursing services, medicines, prosthetic devices, sick \r\n  travel, medical, hospital and other treatment or care shall be paid during the \r\n  life of the injured employee, without regard to any limitation in this title \r\n  including the maximum compensation limit.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985).\r\nInitially, we note that Dr. \r\n  Epsteinâ€™s first examination of Risinger was an independent evaluation performed \r\n  at Knightâ€™s request.Â  Because Risinger is receiving treatment from the physician \r\n  chosen by Knight; this argument is without merit.Â  Furthermore, the language \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 does not allow an employer to dictate the medical \r\n  treatment of injured employees.Â  Our reading of the statute reveals that it \r\n  requires only that the employer/carrier pay for treatment during the life of \r\n  the injured employee.\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] \r\n     Section 42-15-80 states, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n  \r\n  After an injury and so long as he claims compensation, \r\n    the employee, if so requested by his employer or ordered by the Commission, \r\n    shall submit himself to examination, at reasonable times and places, by a \r\n    duly qualified physician or surgeon designated and paid by the employer or \r\n    the Commission. Â The employee shall have the right to have present at such \r\n    examination any duly qualified physician or surgeon provided and paid by him. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.

Michael Brackett, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nMichael H. Quinn, of Columbia; \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â Â  South Carolina Department \r\n  of Transportation (SCDOT) condemned property owned by Burroughs &amp; Chapin \r\n  Company (B&amp;C) in Horry County.Â  A jury trial was held to determine the amount \r\n  of just compensation owed to B&amp;C for the property taken as well as for any \r\n  diminution of value in the remaining property.Â  SCDOT appeals the juryâ€™sÂ  verdict \r\n  of $87,510.63, arguing the trial judge erred in the admission of expert witness \r\n  testimony and in charging the jury in violation of the â€œunit rule.â€Â  Because \r\n  we find the trial judge erred in charging the jury, we reverse and remand for \r\n  a new trial.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSCDOT condemned \r\n  property owned by B&amp;C to complete the construction of the Conway Bypass \r\n  pursuant to its power of eminent domain under the South Carolina Eminent Domain \r\n  Procedure Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-10, et seq. (Supp. 2001).Â Â  SCDOT calculated \r\n  just compensation for the property at $15,975.00.Â  The condemnation resulted \r\n  in an acquisition of 10.8 acres; however, another 6.9 acres of B&amp;Câ€™s property \r\n  were left landlocked.Â  Both tracts were heavily timbered.\r\nAt trial, \r\n  B&amp;C presented two expert witnesses whose testimony was used as evidence \r\n  of the value of the property.Â  Tracey Knight, a registered forester, testified \r\n  as an expert in the field of timber appraisal.Â  He stated that his appraisals \r\n  are often used for the purpose of valuing property to be sold.Â  He also stated \r\n  that his appraisal was the â€œmarketâ€ value of the timber as of September 1998.Â  \r\n  He testified that the condemned land had 7.8 acres of merchantable timber valued \r\n  at $30,281.00 and the landlocked portion of the remaining property had timber \r\n  valued at $28,993.00.Â  Knight testified, however, that it would not be economically \r\n  feasible to harvest the timber from the landlocked tract of land. \r\nSCDOT moved \r\n  [1]  to strike Knightâ€™s testimony on the grounds that it violated the unit \r\n  rule, [2]  failed to relate the \r\n  value of the timber to the value of the property, and was based on lost gross \r\n  revenue or gross profits.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  \r\nAfter Knightâ€™s testimony, the trial judge gave a cautionary \r\n  instruction to the jury regarding the value of the timber on B&amp;Câ€™s property.Â  \r\n  The trial judge defined the term â€œfair market valueâ€ and stated that the value \r\n  of the timber was one component of the property which the jury could use in \r\n  determining the fair market value of the property.Â  However, he further instructed \r\n  the jury that: \r\n\r\n. . . if you feel that it is fair and just under the \r\n  circumstances of this case to add the specific value of a component part of \r\n  a property, or a portion of that value, such as the timber, you may do so in \r\n  your calculations, or you may consider the timber value generally in reaching \r\n  a fair market value determination of the property.Â  This ultimately is your \r\n  decision to make . . . . \r\n\r\nSCDOT objected to the cautionary instruction on \r\n  the basis that it allowed the jury to â€œadd these components together.â€Â  \r\nNext, Joe Rosen, a real estate \r\n  appraiser, testified that the market value of B&amp;Câ€™s land prior to condemnation \r\n  was $222,050.00, and after condemnation the value of the remaining property \r\n  was $99,850.00.Â  He testified that just compensation to B&amp;C would be $122,200.00.Â  \r\n\r\nIn explaining his methodology \r\n  for the appraisal, Rosen testified that he valued the land as if it had no timber \r\n  and then added the appraised value of the timber as calculated by Knight.Â  He \r\n  stated that he found comparable pieces of property, made customary adjustments \r\n  for the location, size, utilities, land type, etc., and then adjusted each piece \r\n  by deducting any value of timber on the property.Â  He used the same methodology \r\n  for appraising the before-condemnation and after-condemnation values of the \r\n  property.Â  SCDOT moved to strike Rosenâ€™s testimony as violating the unit rule.Â  \r\n  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  \r\nSCDOTâ€™s expert appraised the \r\n  land at $16,000.00.Â  He testified that he compared the per acre values of several \r\n  other tracts and made adjustments prior to arriving at that figure.Â  He further \r\n  stated that he did not do â€œbefore and afterâ€ valuations of B&amp;Câ€™s property \r\n  because the valuation arrived at for the condemned piece was less than $30,000.00.Â  \r\n  He stated that he did not value the timber separately because the comparable \r\n  sales all had timber which was considered as part of the value of the property.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge gave a jury charge very similar to \r\n  his prior cautionary instruction.Â  He explained the general definition of fair \r\n  market value and also told the jury on several occasions that it was valuing \r\n  the property as a whole.Â  However, he again indicated that the jury was free \r\n  to add the value of the timber to the value of the land to arrive at its decision \r\n  on just compensation.Â  He also explained that the jury was free to consider \r\n  the testimony presented, but did not have to rely upon it for making a determination.Â  \r\n  SCDOTâ€™s objection to the charge was overruled.Â  The jury returned a verdict \r\n  in favor of B&amp;C in the amount of $87,510.63.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAdmission of Evidence\r\nSCDOT contends the trial \r\n  judge erred in admitting the testimony of Knight and Rosen.Â  SCDOT asserts the \r\n  testimony violated the unit rule and that Knightâ€™s testimony made no attempt \r\n  to equate the value of the timber with the value of the property as a whole.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission or exclusion \r\n  of expert testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. \r\n  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 60-61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211 (1998).Â  Absent \r\n  a clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial court's \r\n  ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. \r\n  503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 (1989).Â  \r\nThe unit rule states that an award of just compensation \r\n  may not be reached by assigning separate values to component parts of the property, \r\n  including separating timber from the land, and requires that improved property \r\n  be valued as a whole.Â  See 4 Julius Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain \r\n  Â§ 13.09[5] (Rev. 3d ed. 1997); 26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain Â§ 338 (1996).Â  \r\n  The trial judge relied on the case of City of Hillsborough v. Hughes, \r\n  538 S.E.2d 586 (N.C. App. 2001), in determining that the admission of B&amp;Câ€™s \r\n  expertsâ€™ testimony was proper.Â  In Hughes, the North Carolina Court of \r\n  Appeals found that testimony of the value of timber on condemned property was \r\n  proper evidence for consideration by the jury.Â  Id. at 589.Â  The court \r\n  opined that the average person would consider the value of the timber in reaching \r\n  a decision regarding the value of the property, and, therefore, the value was \r\n  an appropriate consideration for the jury in determining just compensation for \r\n  the condemned property.Â  Id. at 588-89.\r\nThe Hughes court also cited Cade v. United \r\n  States, 213 F.2d 138 (4th Cir. 1954), in which the Fourth Circuit Court \r\n  of Appeals addressed the issue of assigning separate valuations.Â  The court \r\n  in Cade refused to prohibit testimony as to the separate valuation of \r\n  enhancing components of the land. The Cade court upheld the expertâ€™s \r\n  method of valuation.Â  The court reasoned:Â  \r\nThe trial judge was correct in thinking that the property \r\n  should be valued as a whole for the purpose of assessing compensation for the \r\n  taking; but this does not preclude the admission of testimony showing particular \r\n  elements of value for consideration by the jury in arriving at the overall value \r\n  which they are required to find as the basis for compensation.Â  \r\nId. at 142.Â  While South Carolina has never \r\n  expressly adopted the unit rule, our supreme court has addressed the admission \r\n  of testimony regarding the value of mineral deposits on condemned land.Â  In \r\n  Seaboard Coast Line R.R. v. Harrelson, 262 S.C. 38, 42, 202 S.E.2d 1, \r\n  3 (1974), the court stated:Â  \r\n\r\nThe existence of valuable mineral \r\n  deposits is a proper consideration in ascertaining the value of land taken in \r\n  an eminent domain proceeding insofar as it influences the market value of the \r\n  land.Â  This rule, expressed in a great number of decisions and recognized by \r\n  all the leading textwriters on this subject, has been applied indiscriminately \r\n  to all forms of mineral deposits, including sand and gravel and limestone.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe see no reason why the same logic would not apply \r\n  to the admission of evidence of the value of timber in this case.Â  Although \r\n  SCDOT argues the evidence is barred by the unit rule, we believe the better \r\n  solution is to allow the presentation to the jury of all evidence that bears \r\n  upon its ultimate responsibility in deciding the fair market value of the property.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§28-2-340 (Rev. 1991) (stating evidence which is relevant, \r\n  material, and competent may be admitted as evidence and considered by the judge \r\n  or the jury for the purpose of determining the value of the land sought to be \r\n  condemned and fixing just compensation); Cade, 213 F.2d at 142.Â  While \r\n  the unit rule precludes the jury from valuing the property as separate units, \r\n  the value of those units may enhance the fair market value of the property as \r\n  a whole.Â  Thus, while the property is to be valued as a whole, we do not find \r\n  that this precludes the admission of testimony showing the separate value of \r\n  individual elements for consideration by the jury in arriving at the overall \r\n  value, which is the basis for compensation.\r\nSCDOT further argues the valuation was based on \r\n  lost gross profits from B&amp;Câ€™s business operations, without accounting for \r\n  the expenses required to cultivate and harvest the timber.Â  After reviewing \r\n  the record, we agree that Knightâ€™s testimony failed to account for any expenses \r\n  associated with planting or cutting the timber.Â  However, this same argument \r\n  was made in Seaboard and in that case the supreme court noted: â€œWhile \r\n  this contention is not without some appeal, we think the same is addressed to \r\n  the weight of the evidence, which was a jury matter, and not to its admissibility.â€Â  \r\n  262 S.C. at 41-42, 202 S.E.2d at 3.Â  We agree that the evidence in this case \r\n  was for the jury to consider.Â  Accordingly, we find the evidence was properly \r\n  admitted.\r\nJury Charge\r\nSCDOT next argues the jury \r\n  charge was erroneous because it allowed the jury the opportunity to add the \r\n  value of the timber to the value of the underlying land to reach its decision \r\n  as to the value of the property as a whole.Â  We agree.\r\nA trial court must charge the current and correct \r\n  law.Â  McCourt ex rel. McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d \r\n  603, 606 (1995).Â  â€œIn reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the \r\n  courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented \r\n  at trial.Â  If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated \r\n  portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Keaton \r\n  ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, \r\n  575 (1999) (quoting Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 546, 462 \r\n  S.E.2d 321, 330 (Ct. App. 1995)); see also Waldrup v. Metropolitan \r\n  Life Ins. Co., 274 S.C. 344, 346, 263 S.E.2d 652, 654 (1980) (stating an \r\n  appellate court must view the jury charge as a whole before assigning prejudicial \r\n  error to a discrete portion of the charge).\r\nHere, the trial judge began his charge \r\n  by defining just compensation and fair market value.Â  He also stated that the \r\n  jury was not to consider speculative damages, but must â€œconfine your consideration \r\n  only to those elements which actually affect the propertyâ€™s market value.â€Â  \r\n  The trial judge then explained two methods for computing just compensation; \r\n  first, by â€œadding to the fair market value of the condemned property . . . an \r\n  amount which represents the decrease in value of the remaining land,â€ and second, \r\n  to determine â€œthe fair market value of the landownerâ€™s entire property before \r\n  the condemnation and subtracting from this amount the fair market value of the \r\n  property which remained after the taking.â€Â  \r\nThe trial judge again explained \r\n  the definition of fair market value and the fact that compensation to the landowner \r\n  was the fair market value of the land taken plus any decrease in the value of \r\n  the land remaining.Â  The trial judge instructed the jury that any damages arising \r\n  to the remaining land as a result of the condemnation were to be considered \r\n  in determining just compensation.Â  \r\nFinally, the trial judge again gave an instruction \r\n  relating to Knightâ€™s and Rosenâ€™s testimony:\r\n\r\nYesterday, you heard testimony about one component of that \r\n  property, the timber value.Â  I tell you that this information is given to you \r\n  for your consideration in determining fair market value and you may give it \r\n  such weight and effect as you, the jury, deem appropriate.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\nIn valuing a piece of property, and this is the example I \r\n  gave you this morning, if I was selling my home, I would not calculate the value \r\n  by taking a figure that the property is worth and then add to it certain components, \r\n  such as the fig tree in the back yard, corn which may be in my garden, or a \r\n  collection of stones which may be in the yard.Â  \r\n\r\nThese factors may be generally considered in determining a \r\n  value, but are not usually added one by one.Â  However, if you feel that it \r\n  is fair and just under the circumstances of this case to add the specific value \r\n  of a component part of the property, such as the timber, you may do so in your \r\n  calculations, in whole or in part, or you may consider the timber value \r\n  generally in reaching a fair market value of the property.Â  This is your decision.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nWe have found the North \r\n  Carolina opinion in City of Hillsborough instructive regarding the application \r\n  of the unit rule.Â  The Hillsborough court concluded that it was proper \r\n  to allow the jury to consider the value of the timber in reaching its decision \r\n  regarding the fair market value of the property for just compensation.Â  City \r\n  of Hillsborough v. Hughes, 538 S.E.2d 586 (N.C. App. 2001). However, the \r\n  court made it clear that the separate value of the timber was not to be added \r\n  to the value of the property.Â  Id.Â  The trial judge expressly prohibited \r\n  the jury from adding the value of the timber which may have been removed from \r\n  the property.Â  The North Carolina Court of Appeals stated the timber was one \r\n  â€œfactorâ€ to consider in determining the fair market value.Â  See Hughes, \r\n  538 S.E.2d at 589.\r\nWe agree that the jury is allowed to consider the \r\n  value of the timber in reaching its decision regarding fair market value of \r\n  the property.Â  According to section 28-2-370, the jury is to value just compensation \r\n  as the value of the property taken and the diminution in value of the remaining \r\n  property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-370 (Supp. 2001).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s charge \r\n  was correct to the extent that it stated the jury must find the fair market \r\n  value of the property, which is what a willing buyer will pay a willing seller.Â  \r\n  The trial judge was also correct in allowing the jury to consider the testimony \r\n  regarding the value of the timber.Â  However, in this case, the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  charge went beyond the charge affirmed in the Hughes decision.Â  The trial \r\n  judge erred by specifically stating the jury may add the value of the timber \r\n  to the value of the land if it so chose.Â  This is not the proper method for \r\n  reaching a decision regarding just compensation under section 28-2-370.Â  While \r\n  it is clear that the jury did not add the full value of the timber to the land \r\n  value as testified to by Rosen, we cannot say that the erroneous charge did \r\n  not affect the amount of the verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Rosenâ€™s and Knightâ€™s \r\n  testimony was probative and relevant to the juryâ€™s ultimate purpose of determining \r\n  the market value of the property as a whole.Â  However, it was improper to charge \r\n  the jury that values of the separate elements of the property can be added together \r\n  to determine the value of the property as a whole.Â  Accordingly, the judgment \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART &amp; REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Prior to trial, SCDOT filed a motion in limine to exclude \r\n    the testimony of B&amp;Câ€™s expert witnesses claiming both expertsâ€™ testimony \r\n    violated the unit rule.Â  SCDOT also sought to exclude Knightâ€™s testimony because \r\n    it was a calculation of lost gross profits and unrelated to the market value \r\n    of the land.Â  The trial judge denied SCDOTâ€™s motions.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] The unit rule prohibits an award of compensation by assigning separate \r\n    values to component parts of the property and then adding them together to \r\n    reach the value of the whole property.

Worsham \r\n  and Fairview Family Practice (collectively referred to as â€œAppellantsâ€) for \r\n  medical malpractice.Â  She alleged causes of action for wrongful death, survival, \r\n  and loss of consortium.Â  The jury awarded $3,500,000 each for the survival and \r\n  wrongful death actions.Â  The jury determined the decedent and Appellants were \r\n  each fifty percent at fault.Â  The jury found for Appellants on the loss of consortium \r\n  claim.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBurroughs received a bachelorâ€™s degree, masterâ€™s degree, and doctorate in theology.Â  \r\n  While serving as a missionary in Mexico, Burroughs met Yolanda, whom he married \r\n  in 1984.Â  They later had two children.Â  After marrying, the couple moved back \r\n  to the United States, and eventually settled in Greenville to be close to Burroughsâ€™ \r\n  ill father.\r\nBurroughs began working for the Hyatt Corporation as a night audit \r\n  supervisor for $6.50 an hour.Â  He was subsequently promoted to income auditor, \r\n  to paymaster, to general cashier, to systems administrator, to systems specialist, \r\n  and then to systems analyst.Â  Burroughs was promoted in 1996 to Management Information \r\n  Systems Manager.Â  Finally, in May 1997, he was transferred to the corporate \r\n  headquarters in Chicago, where he became an analyst on special programs and \r\n  applications making $38,000.00 per year.\r\nWhile residing in Greenville, Burroughs was a patient at Fairview \r\n  Family Practice, which was owned by Dr. Worsham and Dr. Terrell T. Leeke.Â  In \r\n  1990, Burroughs went to Dr. Leeke, who referred him to a gastroenterologist.Â  \r\n  Burroughs was diagnosed with a bleeding ulcer.Â  Burroughsâ€™ first visit to Dr. \r\n  Worsham was in 1992 for treatment of poison ivy.Â  In 1993, Burroughs went back \r\n  to the gastroenterologist and was diagnosed as having a propensity for ulcers \r\n  and suffering from gastritis and duodenitis.\r\n Burroughs was next seen by Dr. Worsham on April 12, 1995, to determine \r\n  the cause of his lower abdominal pain.Â  A hemoglobin test was performed and \r\n  it indicated that Burroughs had a low hemoglobin count.Â  Dr. Worsham prescribed \r\n  ulcer medication, but provided no further treatment nor did he follow up on \r\n  the hemoglobin count.\r\n In August 1995, Burroughs returned to Fairview with abdominal pain.Â  \r\n  He was examined by Dr. Worsham and was diagnosed with acute bacterial prostatitis, \r\n  for which an antibiotic was prescribed.Â  Burroughs failed to follow-up for re-examination.\r\n Dr. Worsham gave Burroughs a physical examination in February 1996.Â  \r\n  Burroughs continued having abdominal pain.Â  Dr. Worsham informedÂ  Burroughs \r\n  that he did not have any significant medical problems, but was anemic.Â  Burroughs \r\n  was prescribed iron and Citrucel.Â  Dr. Worsham instructed Burroughs to return \r\n  for a complete blood count in four weeks.Â  According to Dr. Worsham, Burroughs \r\n  did not go back for the four-week follow-up appointment.\r\n Five months later, Burroughs returned with severe abdominal pain.Â  \r\n  Dr. Worsham did another blood test and again diagnosed Burroughs as having acute \r\n  bacterial prostatitis.Â  In his medical note, Dr. Worsham wrote: â€œ[Burroughs] \r\n  has a deep seeded [sic] fear of either prostate or stomach cancer . . . .â€Â  \r\n  Dr. Worsham additionally diagnosed Burroughs with â€œcancer phobia.â€Â  Dr. Worsham \r\n  directed Burroughs to call the next day for his lab results and to make an appointment \r\n  to see Dr. Worsham in two weeks.Â  Neither Dr. Worsham nor Burroughs followed \r\n  up on the lab results.\r\nBurroughs subsequently saw Dr. Worsham in October 1996.Â  He complained \r\n  of right side abdominal pain, dizziness, and weakness.Â  Dr. Worsham believed \r\n  Burroughs had a kidney stone and tests were performed which came back normal.Â  \r\n  Burroughs returned the following day with continued pain.Â  Dr. Worsham felt \r\n  a bulge in Burroughsâ€™ lower right abdomen.Â  He concluded Burroughs had an incisional \r\n  hernia over an old appendectomy scar.\r\nBurroughs was referred to Dr. Joseph C. McAlhany, \r\n  a general surgeon, for evaluation of his condition.Â  Dr. McAlhany noted the \r\n  pain was â€œjust some strain secondary to the previous appendectomy scar.â€Â  He \r\n  prescribed anti-inflammatory agents and heat.Â  Further, he instructed Burroughs \r\n  to return for a recheck in two to three weeks.Â  Burroughs failed to show up \r\n  for the follow-up office appointment with Dr. McAlhany.\r\nIn April 1997, Burroughs returned to Fairview with abdominal pain.Â  \r\n  Because Dr. Worsham was no longer with the practice, Dr. Leeke treated Burroughs.Â  \r\n  Dr. Leeke determined Burroughs was suffering from abdominal pain and chronic \r\n  anemia.Â  He prescribed Burroughsâ€™ usual ulcer medications.\r\nApproximately two weeks later, Burroughs moved to Chicago for his \r\n  promotion with Hyatt Hotels Corporation.Â  On November 3, 1997, Burroughs sought \r\n  treatment in the emergency room of Edward Hospital for severe lower abdominal \r\n  pain, dizziness, and diarrhea.Â  He was admitted to the hospital.Â  A CT scan \r\n  showed a mass in the lower abdomen.Â  Burroughs was diagnosed as having colon \r\n  cancer.\r\n Several surgeries were performed in an attempt to remove much of \r\n  the cancer.Â  However, by the time it was diagnosed, the cancer had spread throughout \r\n  the abdomen.Â  Burroughsâ€™ cancer was incurable.Â  He and his family returned to \r\n  Ware Shoals, where Burroughs received treatment and hospice care.Â  Burroughs \r\n  died in May 1999.\r\n Yolanda originally brought this action against Fairview, Dr. Worsham, \r\n  and Dr. Leeke.Â  Dr. Leeke was dismissed by a directed verdict, and the initial \r\n  trial ended in a mistrial.Â  The case was retried against Appellants.Â  The jury \r\n  determined Appellants and Burroughs were each fifty percent liable.Â  The jury \r\n  awarded $3,500,000 on both the survival and wrongful death actions.Â  The jury \r\n  found for Appellants on the loss of consortium claim.Â  Appellantsâ€™ motions for \r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial absolute were denied.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial judge err in admitting Dr. Bart Greenâ€™s \r\n  testimony over Worshamâ€™s objection because South Carolina does not recognize \r\n  the â€œloss of chance of survivalâ€ doctrine?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in admitting testimony \r\n  from Burroughsâ€™ employer regarding possible future promotions and salary ranges, \r\n  and in allowing testimony by an economist, who relied on these figures for calculation \r\n  of future damages?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in refusing to allow Worsham, \r\n  as referring doctor, to testify as to what he expected Dr. McAlhany to do in \r\n  evaluating and diagnosing Burroughsâ€™ condition pursuant to the referral?\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in refusing to permit Worsham \r\n  to testify that his review of Dr. McAlhanyâ€™s chart showed no entry indicating \r\n  Burroughs returned for a follow-up visit?\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in failing to properly charge \r\n  the jury regarding the standard of care to which Worsham should be held? \r\nVI.Â Â Â Â  Were the jury verdicts in this case inconsistent, \r\n  where the jury found damages for wrongful death but no damages for loss of consortium?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nI.Â  Admission of \r\n  Expert Testimony\r\nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony is \r\n  a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Payton v. Kearse, \r\n  329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998); Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 558 \r\n  S.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling to exclude or admit expert \r\n  testimony will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Mizell v. Glover, ___S.C.Â Â  , 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002); Means, \r\n  348 S.C. at 166, 558 S.E.2d at 923; see also Lee v. Seuss, 318 \r\n  S.C. 283, 457 S.E.2d 344 (1995) (admission of expert testimony is within sound \r\n  discretion of trial judge and will not be overruled absent finding of abuse \r\n  of discretion and prejudice to complaining party).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when there is an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary \r\n  support.Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nII.Â  Exclusion of \r\n  Testimony\r\nIt is well settled that the admission and rejection \r\n  of testimony are matters largely within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion, \r\n  the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that \r\n  discretion.Â  Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t ofÂ  Transp., 343 S.C. 224, \r\n  540 S.E.2d 87 (2000); Commerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen \r\n  &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 556 S.E.2d 718 (Ct. App. 2001); see \r\n  also Gamble v. International Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 \r\n  S.E.2d 438 (1996) (admission or exclusion of evidence is matter within sound \r\n  discretion of trial court and, absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on \r\n  appeal). To warrant reversal, the appellant â€œmust show both the error of the \r\n  ruling and resulting prejudice.â€Â  Recco Tape and Label Co. v. Barfield, \r\n  312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1994); see also Carlyle v. \r\n  Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 407 S.E.2d 630 (1991) (proof that an error caused \r\n  the appellant prejudice is a prerequisite to reversal based on error where the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s discretion is involved).Â  In order for this Court to reverse a \r\n  case based on the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence, prejudice must \r\n  be shown.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997); Commerce \r\n  Ctr., 347 S.C. at 559, 556 S.E.2d at 726; see also Potomac Leasing \r\n  Co. v. Bone, 294 S.C. 494, 497, 366 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œBefore \r\n  the Court of Appeals will reverse a judgment for an alleged error in the exclusion \r\n  of evidence, the appellant must show prejudice.â€).\r\nIII.Â  Jury Charge\r\nIt is not error for the trial judge to refuse a specific request to charge \r\n  when the substance of the request is included in the general instructions.Â  \r\n  Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. 155, 345 S.E.2d 711 (1986); \r\n  Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 557 S.E.2d 676 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In reviewing \r\n  a jury charge for alleged error, this Court must consider the charge as a whole, \r\n  in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster \r\n  v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999).\r\nA trial court must charge the current and correct law.Â  Welch v. Epstein, \r\n  342 S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Brown v. Smalls, \r\n  325 S.C. 547, 481 S.E.2d 444 (Ct.

Mobley, 253 S.C. 103, 109, 169 S.E.2d 278, 281 (1969) (â€œThe fact that \r\n  the doctor had not had opportunity to consider whether the plaintiffâ€™s permanent \r\n  disability was more or less than that which generally followed such a condition \r\n  and operation affected, we think, only the weight and not the admissibility \r\n  of the proffered evidence.â€).Â  Additionally, there was sufficient evidence to \r\n  support the juryâ€™s verdict that Burroughsâ€™ death was â€œmost probablyâ€ the result \r\n  of the failure to diagnose his cancer earlier and not merely a â€œloss of chance \r\n  of survival.â€\r\nOur Supreme Court specifically rejected the â€œloss of \r\n  chanceâ€ doctrine in Jones v. Owings, 318 S.C. 72, 456 S.E.2d 371 (1995).Â  \r\n  The Jones Court concluded:\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough review of the â€œloss of chanceâ€ \r\n  doctrine, we decline to adopt the doctrine and maintain our traditional approach.Â  \r\n  We are persuaded that â€œthe loss of chance doctrine is fundamentally at odds \r\n  with the requisite degree of medical certitude necessary to establish a causal \r\n  link between the injury of a patient and the tortious conduct of a physician.â€Â  \r\n  Legal responsibility in this approach is in reality assigned based on the mere \r\n  possibility that a tortfeasorâ€™s negligence was a cause of the ultimate \r\n  harm.Â  This formula is contrary to the most basic standards of proof which undergird \r\n  the tort system.\r\n\r\nId. at 77, 456 S.E.2d at 374 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\r\nThe â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine, in the context of medical \r\n  malpractice, â€œpermits a recovery when the delay in proper diagnosis or treatment \r\n  of a medical condition results in the patient being deprived of a less [than] \r\n  even chance of surviving or recovering.â€Â  Id. at 75, 456 S.E.2d at 373.Â  \r\n  The Court noted that the decedentâ€™s chance of survival was never above fifty \r\n  percent, even if his lung cancer had been diagnosed earlier.Â  Id. at \r\n  74, 456 S.E.2d at 372.Â  The Court maintained South Carolinaâ€™s traditional approach \r\n  that, in order to recover based on medical malpractice, the plaintiff must show \r\n  the negligence of the physician â€œmost probablyâ€ caused the injury or death.Â  \r\n  Id. (citing Sherer v. James, 290 S.C. 404, 351 S.E.2d 148 (1986)).\r\nIn Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 534 S.E.2d 295 (Ct. App. 2000), \r\n  cert. granted (January 11, 2001), this Court had the opportunity to determine \r\n  whether evidence which demonstrates the negligence of a physician in failing \r\n  to diagnose the decedent, who would have had a greater than fifty percent chance \r\n  of survival except for the negligence of the doctor, satisfies the â€œmost probableâ€ \r\n  standard.Â  We concluded that, when an individual would have had a greater than \r\n  fifty percent chance of survival if the physician had properly advised the decedent \r\n  at an earlier time, evidence of the failure to do so satisfies the â€œmost probablyâ€ \r\n  requirement for causation.Â  Id. at 495, 534 S.E.2d at 300.\r\nIn the instant case, Dr. Randolph Baily testified \r\n  regarding Burroughsâ€™ chance of survival had the cancer been diagnosed earlier.Â  \r\n  The following colloquy is demonstrative of his opinions:\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Doctor, in February of 1996, when he had that physical \r\n  exam, do you have an opinion, based upon a reasonable degree of certainty, as \r\n  to whether or not Jim Burroughs would have survived if he was diagnosed and \r\n  properly treated on that date?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir, I believe he would have.\r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Doctor, do you have an opinion if that was diagnosed, \r\n  the colon cancer, in February of 1996, if Jim Burroughs would have had a normal \r\n  life expectancy?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I believe he would have.Â  Had the tumor been removed, \r\n  then he could have had a normal life expectancy, yes.\r\n\r\nDr. Baily was asked the question regarding whether Burroughs would have survived \r\n  and had a normal life expectancy if the cancer had been diagnosed in July of \r\n  1996, and October of 1996.Â  In both cases, he responded that Burroughs would \r\n  have likely survived and would have enjoyed a normal life expectancy.\r\nDuring redirect examination, the following exchange \r\n  took place:\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Is it your opinion that in February, July and October, \r\n  Mr. Burroughsâ€™ condition was more likely than not curable?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Absolutely.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  And Doctor, do you have an opinion during those \r\n  relevant time periods if it was diagnosed and treated would he have survived \r\n  and lived a normal life?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I believe itâ€™s more likely than not that he would \r\n  have, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe above testimony demonstrates that Burroughs would have had a \r\n  greater than fifty percent chance of survival if the colon cancer had been diagnosed \r\n  in February 1996, July 1996, or October 1996.Â  Therefore, the evidence supports \r\n  the inference that the failure by Dr. Worsham to diagnose Burroughsâ€™ condition \r\n  â€œmost probablyâ€ resulted in his death and not merely in a â€œloss of chance of \r\n  survival.â€\r\nWe note the trial judge properly charged the jury regarding the appropriate \r\n  standard of proof that must be met by Burroughs in order for the jury to award \r\n  damages.Â  The trial judge instructed:\r\n\r\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, when the opinions of a medical \r\n  expert are relied upon to establish a causal connection between negligence and \r\n  an injury, the expert must state with reasonable certainty that in his professional \r\n  opinion the injuries most probably resulted, or the death most probably resulted \r\n  from the alleged negligence of the defendant.Â  Or that expert must use words \r\n  that would mean to you the same thing, that the death most probably resulted \r\n  as the alleged negligence of the defendant.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge properly admitted the testimony of Dr. Green.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  there was sufficient evidence to support the juryâ€™s determination that Worshamâ€™s \r\n  diagnosis was â€œmost probablyâ€ the proximate cause of Burroughsâ€™ death.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Future Damages/Future \r\n  Salary\r\nWorsham argues the trial court erred in admitting testimony of Burroughsâ€™ possible \r\n  future salary, which included several promotions and salary increases, as being \r\n  too speculative.Â  We find the testimony was properly admitted for consideration \r\n  by the jury.\r\nâ€œUnder current South Carolina law, the standard of admissibility for evidence \r\n  of future damages is â€˜any evidence which tends to establish the nature, character, \r\n  and extent of injuries which are the natural and proximate consequences of the \r\n  defendantâ€™s acts . . . if otherwise competent.â€™â€Â  Pearson v. Bridges, \r\n  344 S.C. 366, 372, 544 S.E.2d 617, 620 (2001) (quoting Martin v. Mobley, \r\n  253 S.C. 103, 109, 169 S.E.2d 278, 281-82 (1969)).Â  The â€œmost probableâ€ standard \r\n  required to prove causation is not the standard to be applied in determining \r\n  the admissibility of evidence of future damages.Â  Id. at 371, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  at 619.Â  Furthermore, â€œwhether future medical expenses are â€˜reasonably certainâ€™ \r\n  to occur is also the incorrect standard to use in determining admissibility.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  â€œWhether future damages are â€˜reasonably certainâ€™ to occur is the \r\n  standard of proof for future damages, not the standard of admissibility.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 371-72, 544 S.E.2d at 619 (italics in original).\r\nIn Pearson, the medical expert testified that four possible scenarios \r\n  could result from the alleged malpractice.Â  For each scenario, he presented \r\n  a declining statistical chance of occurrence and the possible damages which \r\n  could result.Â  The Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the medical expenses of scenarios two, three, \r\n  and four was admissible.Â  These scenarios tended to establish the extent of \r\n  Pearsonâ€™s injuries.Â  The fact that Pearsonâ€™s experts testified that the possibilities \r\n  of scenarios two, three, and four occurring were 30 percent or less went to \r\n  the weight of the evidence not its admissibility.Â  Whether Pearson proved the \r\n  expenses were â€œreasonably certainâ€ to occur so she would be entitled to an award \r\n  of future damages was a question for the jury to determine.\r\n\r\nPearson, 344 S.C. at 373, 544 S.E.2d at 620 (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn the instant case, the testimony provided a possible scenario for future \r\n  advancement and income for Burroughs.Â  James Barnish, the Assistant Vice-President \r\n  of hotel accounting for the Hyatt, chronicled the possible path of advancement \r\n  within Hyatt.Â  He stated:\r\n\r\nJames had a good career up to the time that he moved to \r\n  the â€“ to the corporate office, and what I personally had thought would be his \r\n  next logical step would be to work for me in one of my other areas of responsibility \r\n  for the IT department in the corporate office, and James had â€“ I knew James \r\n  had a real interest in the IT side, or the computer side of the business, and \r\n  he preferred to go that route than the hotel accounting route, and itâ€™s difficult \r\n  to hang onto people in that area, and I would have seen him progressing within \r\n  the organization as long as he wanted to stay with the company, that he would \r\n  have made it to a manger [sic], director and eventually an officer type level \r\n  position, because he had the years of service, and Hyatt is very, very big on \r\n  promoting from within.\r\n\r\nBarnish was asked: â€œWere the promotions outlined with what \r\n  you believed most probably would have happened for James Burroughs had he not \r\n  left?â€Â  Barnish answered, â€œYes.â€Â  Barnish declared that the positions and salaries \r\n  presented to Burroughsâ€™ economist for use in determining lost future wages were \r\n  correct.Â  Dr. Charles Alford, an economist, opined that, given the promotion \r\n  track provided by Barnish, the present value of Burroughsâ€™ future wages was \r\n  $1,558,749.\r\nAs in Pearson, whether the future damages in the case sub judice \r\n  were established with â€œreasonable certaintyâ€ was a decision for the jury and \r\n  did not impact the admissibility of the evidence.Â  We iterate for the edification \r\n  of the Bench and Bar that the standard for the admission of evidence is different \r\n  from the standard of proof to be used by the jury in determining whether to \r\n  assess damages.Â  The question in this case, as in Pearson, is whether \r\n  the evidence was properly admitted, not whether the evidence was sufficient \r\n  to support a verdict including future damages.Â  We conclude the evidence was \r\n  properly admitted, and whether the damages were â€œreasonably certainâ€ to occur \r\n  was a decision for the jury.\r\nII.Â  FAILURE TO ALLOW \r\n  WORSHAMâ€™S TESTIMONY\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Expectations Regarding Referral\r\nDr. Worsham claims the trial judge erred by refusing to allow him \r\n  to testify as to what he expected Dr. McAlhany to do in evaluating and diagnosing \r\n  Burroughs pursuant to Worshamâ€™s referral.Â  We find no prejudicial error by the \r\n  trial judge.\r\nWorsham sought to introduce testimony regarding his expectations \r\n  of what Dr. McAlhany would do to diagnose Burroughsâ€™ condition after Worshamâ€™s \r\n  referral.Â  The testimony excluded was never proffered to the court.Â  As there \r\n  was no proffer, Worsham cannot demonstrate how he was prejudiced by its exclusion.Â  \r\n  See Baber v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. 31, 41, 488 S.E.2d 314, \r\n  319 (1997) (â€œAbsent a proffer, it is impossible for this Court to determine \r\n  the effect of the excluded testimony.â€).\r\nMoreover, on direct examination during the plaintiffâ€™s case-in-chief, \r\n  Dr. Worsham testified:\r\n\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  I did not remember James Burroughs until I saw his \r\n  deposition and I recognized his face, but as far as remembering him specifically, \r\n  had we run into each other somewhere, no, I canâ€™t say that I truly remembered \r\n  him.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And just so weâ€™re clear, you were his main treating \r\n  doctor, correct?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Thatâ€™s correct.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  You did not remember him?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I did not remember him specifically, no.\r\n\r\nThis testimony demonstrates with remarkable clarity the inability of Dr. Worsham \r\n  to testify personally about his expectations in regard to the referral of Burroughs \r\n  to Dr. McAlhany.\r\nIn an action for medical malpractice, the fact that a family practitioner \r\n  referred the patient to a specialist does not, in and of itself, establish due \r\n  care.Â Â Â  See Marchese v. Monaco, 145 A.2d 809 (N.J. Super. Ct. \r\n  App. Div. 1958).Â  In spite of referral, a family practitioner still owes the \r\n  patient the duty to exercise that degree of knowledge, care, skill, and learning \r\n  possessed and exercised under the same or similar circumstances by a competent \r\n  family practitioner.Â  Id.\r\nThe mere fact that a family practitioner acts on the advice of another \r\n  physician, even though a specialist, does not constitute a defense to an action \r\n  based on unskilled treatment.Â  Id.Â  This record is replete with testimony \r\n  emanating from various physicians concluding that Dr. Worsham, in diagnosing \r\n  and treating the medical condition of Burroughs, failed to exercise that degree \r\n  of knowledge, care, skill, and learning possessed and exercised by an ordinary, \r\n  careful, and prudent family practitioner under the same or similar circumstances.\r\nOn the merits, the testimony elicited from Dr. McAlhany demonstrated \r\n  that Burroughs was referred to him for treatment of an incisional hernia, and \r\n  that he examined Burroughs consistent with that referral.Â  Dr. McAlhany testified \r\n  he would do further testing in the event the reason for the referral was not \r\n  proper or if he was asked.Â  He professed that he was not informed of the patientâ€™s \r\n  history of abdominal pain nor was he informed of Burroughsâ€™ anemia at the time \r\n  of the referral.\r\nDr. Worsham had ample opportunity to cross-examine Dr. McAlhany regarding whether \r\n  he did further examination and whether it was something he was expected to do \r\n  when a patient was referred to him.Â  Based on the testimony presented, we find \r\n  Worsham was not prejudiced by the exclusion of testimony regarding his expectations \r\n  as to Dr. McAlhany.Â  See Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 166, 558 \r\n  S.E.2d 921, 924 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œBefore the Court of Appeals will reverse a \r\n  judgment for an alleged error in the exclusion of evidence, the appellant must \r\n  show prejudice.â€).Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding \r\n  Worshamâ€™s testimony regarding his expectations of Dr. McAlhanyâ€™s examination.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Burroughsâ€™ Failure to Follow-Up\r\nWorsham maintains the judge erred in refusing to allow him to testify \r\n  that his review of Dr. McAlhanyâ€™s chart indicated Burroughs never returned for \r\n  a follow-up visit.Â  We determine the exclusion of this testimony was harmless \r\n  as it would have been cumulative to other testimony in the record.\r\nWorsham sought to testify, based on his reading of Dr. McAlhanyâ€™s \r\n  report, that Burroughs never returned for a follow-up visit.Â  The trial court \r\n  refused to allow Worsham to interpret Dr. McAlhanyâ€™s records when Dr. McAlhany \r\n  had already testified.\r\nWhen Dr. McAlhany was asked whether Burroughs returned \r\n  for a follow-up visit, he testified that Burroughs never returned.Â  This point \r\n  was brought out several times by Worshamâ€™s counsel during cross-examination.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the excluded testimony would have been merely cumulative to testimony \r\n  already in the record.Â  â€œGenerally, there is no abuse of discretion where the \r\n  excluded testimony is merely cumulative of other evidence proffered to the jury.â€Â  \r\n  Commerce Center of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., \r\n  Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App. 2001); see also \r\n  Ott v. Pittman, 320 S.C. 72, 463 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995) (upholding \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s decision to exclude particular witnessâ€™s testimony, which the \r\n  Court of Appeals characterized as â€œcumulative to that of other witnessesâ€).\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Worshamâ€™s \r\n  testimony that Burroughs missed his follow-up appointment with Dr. McAlhany.\r\nIII.Â  JURY CHARGE\r\nWorsham asserts the trial court erred in failing to specifically \r\n  charge that the standard of care his actions must be measured against was that \r\n  of an ordinary, careful, and prudent physician â€œin his specialtyâ€ under the \r\n  same or similar circumstances.Â  We find that when the jury charges, including \r\n  the two clarifying charges, are read as a whole, the trial judge properly enounced \r\n  the standard of review by which Worshamâ€™s actions should be measured.\r\nThe trial judge originally charged the jury regarding \r\n  the standard of care as follows:\r\n\r\nNow, in this case I will charge you that the law in regard \r\n  to diagnosing a patient is that the degree of skill and care a physician must \r\n  use in diagnosing a condition is that which would be exercised by a competent \r\n  practitioner in the defendant doctorâ€™s field of medicine.Â  And I will charge \r\n  you that in this case the question is whether Dr. Worsham, in making a diagnosis, \r\n  deviated from the applicable standard of care, either by not employing a particular \r\n  procedure or by not ordering a particular test.Â  And that is to be determined \r\n  by what an ordinary, careful, and prudent physician would have done under the \r\n  same or similar circumstances in this case.\r\n. . . What the law does require of a physician is this, \r\n  that in the practice of -- he shall exercise that degree of knowledge, care \r\n  and skill ordinarily possessed by members of his profession in good standing \r\n  under the same or similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Appellants did not object to the charge \r\n  as given.\r\nThe jury submitted a question to the judge which read: â€œWe \r\n  are confused about what the law states the M.D. must do, as a minimum, to meet \r\n  the standards of care.â€Â  Appellantsâ€™ attorneys then requested a charge to the \r\n  jury â€œadd[ing] the defendant doctorâ€™s field of medicine.â€Â  The trial judge gave \r\n  the following clarifying charge:\r\nIn this case, the law in South Carolina is, the question \r\n  of whether a physician in making a diagnosis deviated from the applicable standard \r\n  of care, either by not employing a particular procedure or by not administering \r\n  a particular test, is to be determined by what an ordinary, careful and prudent \r\n  physician would have done under the same or similar circumstances.\r\nThe jury submitted a second question requesting further clarification \r\n  of the standard of care and its application in this case.Â  The judge charged \r\n  the jury:\r\n\r\nNow, doctors must do what an ordinary, reasonable, prudent doctor would do under \r\n  the same or similar circumstances.Â  If a doctor does something or fails to do \r\n  something that an ordinary, reasonable doctor should have done under the -- \r\n  under those circumstances then it would be negligence.Â  Okay.\r\nAs a general rule, you and I do not know what the standards of care are.Â  Therefore \r\n  we have to learn or hear what the standards of care are through expert witnesses, \r\n  or expert testimony what are generally recognized and accepted practices and \r\n  procedures which should be followed by the average, competent doctor in the \r\n  defendantâ€™s profession, under the same or similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Appellants did not object to this charge \r\n  as given.\r\nIn King v. Williams, 276 S.C. 478, 482, 279 \r\n  S.E.2d 618, 620 (1981), the Supreme Court held: â€œThe degree of care which must \r\n  be observed is, of course, that of an average, competent practitioner acting \r\n  in the same or similar circumstances.â€Â  Since the King decision, this \r\n  Court has defined medical malpractice as â€œthe failure of a physician to exercise \r\n  that degree of care and skill which is ordinarily employed by the profession \r\n  generally, under similar conditions and in like surrounding circumstances.â€Â  \r\n  Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 333, 440 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  â€œThe standard for recovery has been summarized, â€˜To recover for medical malpractice, \r\n  a plaintiff must show failure by a physician to exercise that degree of care \r\n  and skill which is ordinarily employed by the profession under similar conditions \r\n  and in like circumstances.â€™â€Â  Keaton ex rel.

App. 1987)) (emphasis \r\n  in original).\r\nWhile the first clarifying charge fails to specifically \r\n  state that the standard of care is based on a doctor in the same field of medicine, \r\n  both the main charge and the second clarifying charge elucidate the jury as \r\n  to the requirement that Worshamâ€™s actions are to be juxtaposed to those of a \r\n  doctor in the same field of medicine.Â  In looking at the charges given as a \r\n  whole, we find no prejudicial error in the clarifying chargeâ€™s failure to indicate \r\n  that the standard of care is compared to doctors in the same field of medicine.Â  \r\n  See Keaton, 334 S.C. at 497, 514 S.E.2d at 575.\r\nWorsham complains that the testimony establishing the standard of \r\n  care was not by a medical professional in the area of family medicine, but was \r\n  explained by an internal medicine specialist and a surgeon.Â  We rule the experts \r\n  who testified properly detailed the standard of care for a family practitioner \r\n  based on their knowledge and experiences.\r\nDr. Daniel Derman is board certified in internal medicine.Â  He testified \r\n  the standard of care for a family practitioner diagnosing and treating a patient \r\n  with symptoms of colon cancer is the same as the standard in internal medicine.Â  \r\n  Specifically, he stated: â€œ[F]or primary care in terms of being the first one \r\n  on the front line, so to speak, who might see a colon cancer, it would not only \r\n  be the same for family practice as internal medicine, but itâ€™s going to be the \r\n  same all over the country as well.â€\r\nDr. Randolph Baily, a colorectal surgeon, detailed his background \r\n  and how he was qualified to establish the standard of care for family practitioners.Â  \r\n  He testified that he has taught diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer to students \r\n  and residents in family practice at Baylor College of Medicine and the University \r\n  of Texas Medical School in Houston.Â  In addition, he declared that diagnosing \r\n  colon cancer is something taught in medical school to all students regardless \r\n  of their specialties.Â  According to Dr. Baily, Worshamâ€™s actions failed to meet \r\n  the appropriate standard of care for diagnosing and treating colon cancer.\r\nFinally, Dr. Meher Medavaram, Burroughsâ€™ family practice doctor in \r\n  Chicago, testified that the standard of care for family practitioners was consistent \r\n  throughout the United States.Â  She asserted Worsham failed to properly perform \r\n  tests to determine the cause of Burroughsâ€™ anemia.Â  She professed the standard \r\n  of care required the performance of additional tests to rule out colon cancer.\r\nThe testimony presented by Burroughsâ€™ expert witnesses \r\n  established the standard of care for a doctor in family practice.Â  The experts \r\n  were each qualified to detail the standard of care in family practice.Â  Thus, \r\n  the testimony was properly admitted.Â  See Means v. Gates, 348 \r\n  S.C. 161, 558 S.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 2001) (admission or exclusion of expert testimony \r\n  is matter within sound discretion of trial court, whose decision will not be \r\n  disturbed on appeal absent abuse of discretion).\r\nWe find no error in the jury charge or the testimony by \r\n  Burroughsâ€™ experts used to establish and clarify the standard of care.\r\nIV.Â  INCONSISTENT \r\n  VERDICTS\r\nAppellants allege the juryâ€™s verdicts finding \r\n  them liable for the wrongful death cause of action, but finding no liability \r\n  for loss of consortium were inconsistent, and, therefore, a new trial should \r\n  have been ordered.Â  We find the argument raised is not properly preserved.Â  \r\n  Moreover, the assertion fails on the merits, as the causes of action are separate \r\n  and distinct, and the verdicts were entirely consistent.\r\nThe reading of the verdict by the trial judge and any subsequent \r\n  objections are not included in the Record on Appeal.Â  It is impossible for us \r\n  to determine whether Appellants raised timely objections to the issue of the \r\n  inconsistent verdicts.Â  As such, the issue is not properly preserved for review \r\n  on appeal.Â  See Smith v. Phillips, 318 S.C. 453, 458 S.E.2d 427 \r\n  (1995) (noting appellate court could not consider propriety of juryâ€™s verdict \r\n  which found neighbor liable for nuisance but awarded no damages, where there \r\n  was no objection at trial by neighbor or landowner which brought nuisance action, \r\n  and neither party raised issue on appeal); Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. \r\n  439, 520 S.E.2d 625 (Ct. App. 1999), affâ€™d, 342 S.C. 47, 536 S.E.2d 663 \r\n  (2000) (holding there is no duty imposed on trial judge to question juryâ€™s verdict \r\n  of liability, but no damages, unless requested to by a party).\r\nThe order denying Appellantsâ€™ motions for judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict and for a new trial absolute is in the Record on Appeal.Â  However, \r\n  the motions themselves are not.Â  The order incorporates by reference the post-trial \r\n  motions made during the hearing.Â  Yet, the portion of the hearing in which the \r\n  motions were made is not included in the Record on Appeal.Â  The order finds \r\n  the motions not preserved.Â  The only possible reference to this issue is where \r\n  the judge notes: â€œ[T]he Defendants failed to make a timely objection to the \r\n  form of the jury verdict thereby waiving same.â€Â  The Record on Appeal does not \r\n  allow us to determine whether a proper objection or motion for a new trial was \r\n  made based on this specific issue.Â  Appellants had the burden to furnish a sufficient \r\n  record from which an intelligent review could be conducted.Â  See D \r\n  &amp; D Leasing Co. v. Gentry, 298 S.C. 342, 380 S.E.2d 823 (1989) (emphasizing \r\n  that burden is on appellant to furnish a sufficient record from which an intelligent \r\n  review can be conducted and finding that appellant did not meet this burden; \r\n  thus, the appellate court properly dismissed the appeal).\r\nIn addition, Appellantsâ€™ claims fail on the merits.Â  \r\n  Under South Carolina law, unlike that of some other states, loss of consortium \r\n  is an independent action, not derivative.Â  Preer v. Mims, 323 S.C. 516, \r\n  476 S.E.2d 472 (1996); Stewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 341 \r\n  S.C. 143, 533 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œAlthough loss of consortium is an \r\n  independent action, case law has held the right of action does not accrue until \r\n  the loss of the services, society and companionship of the spouse has actually \r\n  occurred, which has been defined as the point when the spouse sustained the \r\n  injuries.â€Â  Stewart, 341 S.C. at 156, 533 S.E.2d at 604.Â  â€œLoss of consortium \r\n  arises out of the special relationship between a husband and wife.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œAny person may maintain an action for damages arising from an intentional or \r\n  tortious violation of the right to the companionship, aid, society and services \r\n  of his or her spouse.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (1977).\r\nAccording to the Wrongful Death Act: â€œWhenever the \r\n  death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of \r\n  another and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, \r\n  have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in \r\n  respect thereof, the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, \r\n  shall be liable to an action for damages.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-10 (1977).Â  \r\n  â€œEvery such action shall be for the benefit of the wife or husband and child \r\n  or children of the person whose death shall have been so caused, and, if there \r\n  be no such wife, husband, child or children, then for the benefit of the parent \r\n  or parents, and if there be none such, then for the benefit of the heirs of \r\n  the person whose death shall have been so caused.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-20 \r\n  (Supp. 2001).\r\nThis Court has identified factors to be considered \r\n  in assessing damages under the Wrongful Death Act.Â  â€œThe general elements of \r\n  damages recoverable are: (1) pecuniary loss, (2) mental shock and suffering, \r\n  (3) wounded feelings, (4) grief and sorrow, (5) loss of companionship, and (6) \r\n  deprivation of the use and comfort of the intestateâ€™s society, including the \r\n  loss of his experience, knowledge, and judgment in managing the affairs of himself \r\n  and of his beneficiaries.â€Â  Self v. Goodrich, 300 S.C. 349, 351, 387 \r\n  S.E.2d 713, 714 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nWhile the factors to consider for damages in a wrongful \r\n  death action include loss of consortium, we find this is not sufficient to say \r\n  that a plaintiffâ€™s verdict on wrongful death and a defense verdict on loss of \r\n  consortium are inconsistent.Â  First, the parties benefiting from the actions \r\n  may be separate and distinct.Â  Only the spouse may bring a loss of consortium \r\n  claim.Â  However, the spouse, children, parents, or other heirs may be the beneficiaries \r\n  of the wrongful death award.\r\nAdditionally, the statute establishes that the claim \r\n  for loss of consortium is to compensate the spouse for â€œtortious violation of \r\n  the right to the companionship, aid, society and services of his or her spouse.â€Â  \r\n  Â§ 15-75-20.Â  In contrast, a wrongful death claim is to compensate the heirs \r\n  of a decedent, who, if he had survived, could have brought a personal injury \r\n  action.Â  Â§ 15-51-10.Â  This Court, as well as the South Carolina Supreme Court, \r\n  has ruled claims for personal injury and loss of consortium are separate and \r\n  distinct claims, and a ruling on one does not bar, nor entitle, recovery on \r\n  the other claim.Â  See, e.g., Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. \r\n  393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984); Page v. Crisp, 303 S.C. 117, 399 S.E.2d 161 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nWe find that, as a wrongful death claim is premised on the decedentâ€™s ability \r\n  to have brought a personal injury claim if he had survived, the rulings in the \r\n  cases of Graham and Page are apposite and analogous to the present \r\n  case.Â  Verdicts awarding damages for wrongful death, but finding for the defense \r\n  on loss of consortium, are not inconsistent.Â  We hold the two claims are separate \r\n  and distinct, and, as pronounced in Page, â€œ[e]ach litigant was entitled \r\n  to a verdict based on the law and the evidence.â€Â  Page, 303 S.C. at 119, \r\n  399 S.E.2d at 162.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the testimony of Dr. Green was properly admitted \r\n  because it did not violate the â€œloss of chance of survivalâ€ doctrine.Â  We find \r\n  that the testimony regarding Burroughsâ€™ future promotion opportunities and possible \r\n  salaries was admissible as it explained the extent and nature of Burroughsâ€™ \r\n  injuries.Â  We further remind the Bench and Bar that the standard of admissibility \r\n  is different from the standard of proof for evidence of future damages.Â  We \r\n  hold the trial judge did not err in excluding Worshamâ€™s testimony regarding \r\n  his expectations of Dr. McAlhanyâ€™s care or Burroughsâ€™ failure to follow up with \r\n  Dr. McAlhany.Â  Testimony was already in the record, making Worshamâ€™s testimony \r\n  cumulative and unnecessary.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s charges, when viewed as a whole, \r\n  were proper and adequate statements of the law of South Carolina regarding the \r\n  standard of care for a family practitioner.Â  We determine the claims of wrongful \r\n  death and loss of consortium are separate and distinct causes of action.Â  Apodictically, \r\n  we conclude the juryâ€™s verdicts, one awarding damages for wrongful death and \r\n  the other denying damages for loss of consortium, were not inconsistent.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the judgment of the Circuit Court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3580","title":"FOC Lawshe v.

Doar, Jr., of Georgetown; for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  FOC \r\n  Lawshe Limited Partnership, et al, (collectively FOC Lawshe), brought suit seeking \r\n  injunctive relief and damages against International Paper Company.Â  FOC Lawshe \r\n  appeals the trial judgeâ€™s denial of its motion for temporary injunctive relief.Â  \r\n  International Paper appeals the denial of its motion to dismiss pursuant to \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We affirm the denial of both motions.\r\nFACTS\r\nFOC Lawshe is the \r\n  owner of a plantation consisting of approximately 841 acres.Â  The Black River \r\n  bounds FOC Lawsheâ€™s land to the north.Â  International Paper owns large tracts \r\n  of land, which surround FOC Lawsheâ€™s land to the east, south, and west.Â  FOC \r\n  Lawshe purchased its land primarily for the purpose of hunting deer and quail.Â  \r\n  FOC Lawshe invested time and money to improve the land to be used for hunting \r\n  and to stock the property with wildlife.Â  International Paper primarily utilizes \r\n  its land for growing timber for use in its paper products.Â  However, International \r\n  Paper leases its property to several hunt clubs to use for hunting deer.Â  During \r\n  hunting season, the hunt clubs commonly hunt deer on Wednesdays and Saturdays, \r\n  the same days that FOC Lawshe hunts deer and quail on its plantation.\r\nThe hunt clubs that lease the land from \r\n  International Paper utilize dogs while they are hunting.Â  The dogs are released \r\n  to chase deer in the direction of the waiting hunters.Â  FOC Lawsheâ€™s hunters \r\n  are â€œstillâ€ hunters, meaning they set out corn, climb deer stands, and wait \r\n  for a passing deer.Â  The dogs released by the hunt clubs frequently cross over \r\n  from International Paperâ€™s lands onto FOC Lawsheâ€™s property and disrupt the \r\n  hunting by FOC Lawsheâ€™s members and guests.Â  Deer and other wildlife are chased \r\n  off FOC Lawsheâ€™s property toward the hunt clubs on International Paperâ€™s land.Â  \r\n  The dogs have also raided quail pens on FOC Lawsheâ€™s property, destroying the \r\n  pens and the animals. \r\nFOC Lawshe attempted \r\n  to settle the dispute with the hunt clubs without success.Â  When members of \r\n  FOC Lawshe contacted individuals at International Paper, they were told that \r\n  buffer areas were established between the adjoining lands and that the problem \r\n  would be corrected.Â  However, the use of dogs continued, and the buffer zones \r\n  proved ineffective.Â  Ruskin Dowdy, an employee of International Paper, told \r\n  the members of FOC Lawshe the trespassing dogs may be coming from other groups \r\n  and not the hunt clubs.Â  However, FOC Lawsheâ€™s members collected the collars \r\n  of nine dogs they found on their property, and believe the collars were from \r\n  dogs owned by members of the hunt clubs that lease International Paperâ€™s land. \r\n\r\n FOC Lawshe brought \r\n  suit against International Paper seeking a temporary restraining order and damages.Â  \r\n  FOC Lawshe based its claim on a theory of nuisance arising from the disruption \r\n  caused by the trespassing dogs.Â  Neither the hunt clubs nor their members were \r\n  named as defendants in the action.Â  FOC Lawshe moved for the temporary restraining \r\n  order when it filed its complaint.Â  International Paper moved to dismiss the \r\n  action for failing to state a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, \r\n  and for failing to join a necessary party under Rule 19, SCRCP. \r\nThe trial court \r\n  found FOC Lawshe failed to establish the requirements necessary for issuing \r\n  a temporary restraining order, and denied its motion.Â  In a separate order, \r\n  the trial court found the complaint stated a cause of action in nuisance against \r\n  International Paper and that all necessary parties were joined in the action.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the court denied International Paperâ€™s motions to dismiss the case. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nA.Â  Motion to Dismiss\r\nA trial judge may \r\n  dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiffâ€™s â€œfailure to \r\n  state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of actionâ€ in the pleadings filed \r\n  with the court.Â  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. â€œThe trial court must dispose of a motion \r\n  for failure to state a cause of action based solely upon the allegations set \r\n  forth on the face of the complaint.â€Â Â  Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, \r\n  366, 353 S.E.2d 697, 698 (1987).Â  â€œThe motion cannot be sustained if facts alleged \r\n  in the complaint and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle \r\n  plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.â€Â  Id.Â  All properly \r\n  pleaded factual allegations are deemed admitted for the purposes of considering \r\n  a motion for judgment on the pleadings.Â  Russell v. Columbia, 305 S.C. \r\n  86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991).Â  \r\nB.Â  Temporary Injunction\r\nThe decision to grant or \r\n  deny temporary injunctive relief is within the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  City of \r\n  Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., 340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518, \r\n  520 (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's decision is \r\n  unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Zabinski v. \r\n  Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 601, 553 S.E.2d 110, 121 (2001).Â  â€œThe \r\n  sole purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo and thus \r\n  avoid possible irreparable injury to a party pending litigation.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Motion to Dismiss\r\nInternational Paper \r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss pursuant to \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. [1] Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œThe traditional concept of a nuisance requires a landowner \r\n  to demonstrate that the defendant unreasonably interfered with his ownership \r\n  or possession of the land.â€Â  Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, \r\n  344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Nuisance is a substantial \r\n  and unreasonable interference with the plaintiffâ€™s use and enjoyment of his \r\n  land.Â  Id.Â  â€œNuisance law is based on the premise that â€˜[e]very citizen \r\n  holds his property subject to the implied obligation that he will use it in \r\n  such a way as not to prevent others from enjoying the use of their property.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Clark v. Greenville County, 313 S.C. 205, 209, 437 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1993) \r\n  (citations omitted).Â  In South Carolina, a landlord cannot be held liable for \r\n  a nuisance arising from the use of his land when the landlord has no control \r\n  over the property at the time of the alleged nuisance.Â  See id. \r\n  at 210, 437 S.E.2d at 119.Â  Conversely, if the landowner maintains complete \r\n  control of the leased property, he may be liable for the nuisance created \r\n  by the use of the land.Â  See Peden v. Furman University, 155 S.C. \r\n  1, 19, 151 S.E. 907, 913 (1930).Â  \r\nIn Peden, Furman University leased its baseball field \r\n  to the Greenville Baseball Association.Â  Frequently, baseballs were batted over \r\n  the fence surrounding the ball field onto other landownersâ€™ property.Â  When \r\n  a neighboring landowner sued, the University claimed it had no control over \r\n  the ball field and, therefore, could not be held liable for any nuisance caused \r\n  by its use.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court found the University had â€œcomplete \r\n  controlâ€ of the property under terms of the lease, and concluded the University \r\n  could be held liable.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, the court stated, â€œIn order \r\n  to charge the landlord, the nuisance must necessarily result from the ordinary \r\n  use of the premises by the tenant, or for the purpose for which they were let \r\n  . . . .â€ Id.Â  \r\nInternational Paper argues it cannot be liable for a nuisance \r\n  arising from its tenantsâ€™ use of the land in light of recent South Carolina \r\n  decisions that hold landlords are not liable for the actions of dogs belonging \r\n  to their tenants, even in cases where the landlord knew of the danger of a foreseeable \r\n  harm.Â  See Mitchell v. Bazzle, 304 S.C. 402, 404 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1991).Â  In Mitchell, this court found that even though the landlord \r\n  knew of the dogâ€™s viciousness, had adequate time to terminate the tenantâ€™s lease, \r\n  and failed to terminate the tenantâ€™s lease, the landlord was not liable for \r\n  the acts of the tenantâ€™s dog over, which the landlord had no control.Â  Id., \r\n  at 405, 404 S.E.2d at 911-12. Also, in Fair v. United States, 334 S.C. \r\n  321, 513 S.E.2d 616 (1999), the supreme court held a landlord was not liable \r\n  to a tenantâ€™s invitee for harm caused by the tenantâ€™s dog.Â  International Paper \r\n  argues that if a landowner cannot be held liable for damages based on the facts \r\n  in these cases, it would be inappropriate to hold the landowner responsible \r\n  for the actions of its tenantsâ€™ dogs in the instant action.Â  \r\nBecause Mitchell and Fair were actions in tort \r\n  based on negligence and premises liability, we find these cases are inapplicable.Â  \r\n  FOC Lawsheâ€™s cause of action is based on nuisance.Â  Negligence is not an element \r\n  of nuisance, and an action for nuisance may lie even though there has been no \r\n  negligence on the part of the landlord.Â  See Peden, 155 S.C. at \r\n  17-18, 151 S.E. 912 (stating a landlord can be found liable for a nuisance even \r\n  though he may have exercised reasonable care).Â  Moreover, the mere fact that \r\n  dogs are the relevant subjects of the alleged nuisance does not in itself place \r\n  the action in any particular category of cases.Â  We see no rationale for distinguishing \r\n  a nuisance caused by dogs from a nuisance caused by baseballs where both enter \r\n  upon a neighborâ€™s land disrupting the use and enjoyment of the property. Accordingly, \r\n  Peden is controlling.Â  Under Peden, the appropriate analysis is \r\n  whether International Paper had complete control over the land and whether the \r\n  alleged nuisance necessarily results from the ordinary use of the lands by International \r\n  Paperâ€™s tenants or for the purpose for which the lands were let.Â  155 S.C. at \r\n  19, 151 S.E. at 913.Â  Applying Peden, we find FOC Lawshe alleged sufficient \r\n  facts to state a cause of action against International Paper.\r\nIn its complaint, \r\n  FOC Lawshe alleges that despite the leases to the hunt clubs, International \r\n  Paper reserved the right to and does control the premises and the activities \r\n  on the land.Â  The complaint alleges that International Paper allows the use \r\n  of its lands for the type of deer hunting which uses dogs to drive the deer.Â  \r\n  Moreover, the complaint alleges the dogs used by the hunt clubs will continue \r\n  to trespass onto FOC Lawsheâ€™s lands.Â  FOC Lawshe alleges this continuing trespass \r\n  prevents it using its property for the purpose for which it was purchased. \r\nIn reviewing a \r\n  motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we look only to the pleadings to \r\n  determine whether sufficient facts are alleged to establish a cause of action.Â  \r\n  See Brown, 291 S.C. at 366, 353 S.E.2d at 698.Â  In viewing the \r\n  face of the complaint, we find the allegation that International Paper retained \r\n  control over the property and activities thereon sufficiently satisfies the \r\n  control element of Peden.Â  155 S.C. at 19, 151 S.E. at 913.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the allegation that International Paper permits the use of its lands for the \r\n  type of deer hunting utilizing dogs and that the dogs will continue to enter \r\n  onto FOC Lawsheâ€™s land satisfies the requirement that the nuisance must necessarily \r\n  result from the ordinary use of the premises by the tenant, or for the purpose \r\n  for which they were let.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial judge was \r\n  correct in denying International Paperâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \r\n  12(b)(6).\r\nB.Â  Temporary Injunction\r\nFOC Lawshe asserts \r\n  the trial court erred in denying its motion for a temporary injunction prohibiting \r\n  International Paper from allowing the use of dogs for hunting on its land.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff's entitlement \r\n  to an injunction requires the complaint to allege facts sufficient to constitute \r\n  a cause of action for an injunction while establishing that an injunction is \r\n  reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights of the plaintiff during the \r\n  litigation.Â  Transcontâ€™l Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, \r\n  480-81, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969).Â  Generally, to obtain an injunction, a party \r\n  must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and \r\n  an inadequate remedy at law.Â  Roach v. Combined Util. Commâ€™n, 290 S.C. \r\n  437, 442, 351 S.E.2d 168, 170 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nWhile the harm \r\n  caused by the dogs invading FOC Lawsheâ€™s property is likely to continue, we \r\n  believe the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant the \r\n  temporary injunction.Â  A requisite level of control must be shown in order to \r\n  find an owner liable for the actions of a lessee who causes a nuisance to an \r\n  adjoining property owner.Â Â  Peden, 155 S.C at 19, 151 S.E. at 912.Â  In \r\n  Peden, the lease provided that the landowner maintained control of the \r\n  maintenance of the baseball park.Â  Moreover, the court found the lease gave \r\n  the landowner control over the height of the fence, and the landowner could \r\n  have taken several steps to prevent baseballs from traveling into the neighboring \r\n  property.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLooking beyond the face of the complaint, we find conflicting \r\n  evidence in the record concerning whether International Paper maintained complete \r\n  control over the activities taking place on its lands.Â  FOC Lawshe alleges that \r\n  International Paper maintained control over its lands and the activities thereon.Â  \r\n  In support of this allegation, the record indicates that International Paper \r\n  created buffer zones between its lands and FOC Lawsheâ€™s lands in an attempt \r\n  to limit the trespassing by the dogs.Â  However, FOC Lawsheâ€™s own affidavits, \r\n  as well as one submitted by International Paper, suggest International Paper \r\n  may not have control over its lesseesâ€™ hunting activities.Â  The affidavit by \r\n  Steven Fisher, president of FOC Lawshe, states: \r\n\r\nI am informed and believe that [International Paper] has \r\n  agreed with the Sand Hill Hunting Club and the Pine Island Hunting Club to allow \r\n  each club to have the right to hunt deer on certain areas, assigned to each \r\n  club, on the lands owned by it.Â  Except for the permitted hunting thereon, \r\n  I am informed and believe that [International Paper] retains the right to and \r\n  does control the premises and activities thereon.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nPeden requires a \r\n  finding of complete control before the landlord may be held liable.Â  At this \r\n  point in the action, the issue of complete control remains unadjudicated.Â  See \r\n  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 670, 560 S.E.2d 902, 905 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Whether International Paper retained complete control over \r\n  its lands is a question of fact, and it is for the finder of fact to weigh the \r\n  conflicting evidence in the record.Â  The fact finder must first decide whether \r\n  International Paper retained complete control before the court can justify imposing \r\n  an injunction prohibiting the use of hunting dogs on International Paperâ€™s property.Â  \r\n  Because the issue of control has not been adjudicated, no injunction is needed, \r\n  at this time, to preserve the status quo.Â  Id. at 671, 560 S.E.2d at \r\n  906 (finding the operation of an alleged sexually oriented business could not \r\n  be enjoined without first adjudicating whether the business had actually violated \r\n  an ordinance because to do so would not preserve the partiesâ€™ positions pending \r\n  a decision on the merits).Â  Because there is conflicting evidence in the record, \r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying FOC Lawsheâ€™s motion \r\n  for a temporary injunction.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 601, 553 S.E.2d at \r\n  121. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial \r\n  judge correctly denied International Paperâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The complaint alleges facts sufficient to support a cause \r\n  of action in nuisance.Â  Additionally, we find the trial judge did not abuse \r\n  his discretion in denying FOC Lawsheâ€™s motion for a temporary injunction.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decisions of the trial judge are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] We note the denial of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n    is generally not immediately appealable.Â  However, an order that is not directly \r\n    appealable can be considered if there is an appealable issue before the court.Â  \r\n    See Cox v. Woodman of World Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 460, 469, 556 \r\n    S.E.2d 397, 402 (Ct.

Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion \r\n  No. 3581\r\nHeard \r\n  November 5, 2002 â€“ Filed December 19, 2002Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMichael G. Nettles, of Lake City; \r\n  for Appellants.\r\nJeffrey L. Payne, \r\n  James D. Smith, Jr., of Florence; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, \r\n  J.: David Nexsen brought this action seeking a declaration that the sublease \r\n  between Kenneth E. McClary, James G. Lifrage and Marion Driggers is a nullity \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-60 (1976, as amended). The trial judge found \r\n  the sublease to be invalid.Â  Lifrage and Driggers appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1996, David Nexsen purchased a tract of land on the Black River in Williamsburg \r\n  County, South Carolina. At the time the property was purchased, the tract had \r\n  been divided into three lots, with each lot being subject to a lease.Â Â  Kenneth \r\n  E. McClary was a tenant on lot 2 and a party to one of the leases.Â  McClaryâ€™s \r\n  lease allowed for the use and occupancy of the premises as the tenant â€œdesired.â€ \r\n  The terms of the lease did not prohibit the subleasing of the property. Â \r\nIn July, \r\n  2000, McClary entered into a sublease with James G. Lifrage and Marion Driggers \r\n  (Appellants).Â  This lease was recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Court for \r\n  Williamsburg County. Neither McClary, nor Appellants, asked Nexsenâ€™s permission \r\n  prior to entering into the sublease.Â  \r\nNexsen brought \r\n  this action seeking to have the lease between McClary and Appellants declared \r\n  a nullity.Â  Following a hearing on both partiesâ€™ motions for summary judgment, \r\n  the trial judge held that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-60 prohibits the sublease of \r\n  property without the written consent of the landlord, and as a result, the sublease \r\n  between the Appellants and McClary was invalid.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants \r\n  aver the trial court erred in finding that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-60 prohibits \r\n  the sublease of property without the written consent of the landlord under the \r\n  facts of this case.Â  Appellants contend that the terms of the lease agreement \r\n  control the issue of whether McClary was able to sublease the property.Â  Appellants \r\n  argue that because the lease contains language to the effect that the tenant \r\n  may use the property â€œas desiredâ€, and because the original owner testified \r\n  he had no intention of limiting McClaryâ€™s ability to sublease the property, \r\n  that under the terms of the lease, McClary had the right to sublease the property. \r\n  \r\nWhen Nexsen purchased \r\n  the tract of land in question, the property continued to be burdened with the \r\n  lease entered into between McClary and the previous owner of the tract.Â Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-50 (1976): \r\n\r\n When real estate is \r\n  sold while under lease, the relationship of landlord and tenant is created ipso \r\n  facto as between the purchaser and the tenant as if the purchaser had been the \r\n  landlord in the first instance and the purchaser shall be entitled to all the \r\n  benefits and rights under such lease as if he had been the lessor from the date \r\n  of the purchase.\r\n\r\nNexsen contends, however, \r\n  that because the lease is silent as to whether or not the property may beÂ  subleased, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-60 controls.Â  The statute states:\r\n\r\n A sublease by a tenant \r\n  without written consent of the landlord is a nullity insofar as the rights of \r\n  the landlord are concerned, except that rent collected by a tenant from a subtenant \r\n  shall be deemed to be held in trust by the tenant for the benefit of the landlord \r\n  until the payment of the landlordâ€™s claim for rent.Â  But when the premises have \r\n  been sublet the sublessor, as between himself and the subtenant or sublessee, \r\n  shall be deemed the landlord and the sublessee the tenant under him . . .Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-60 \r\n  (1976).Â Â  Nexsen argues Â§ 27-35-60 prohibits McClary from subleasing the property. \r\n  \r\nâ€œIn reviewing \r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, we apply the same standard which governs \r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Summary judgment is proper when there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . .Â  the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.â€ Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., \r\n  306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991) (citations omitted). â€œWhen \r\n  an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free \r\n  to review whether the trial court properly applied the law to those facts.â€ \r\n  WDW Prop. v. City of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000). \r\n  \r\nâ€œThe \r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is that we are to ascertain and effectuate \r\n  the actual intent of the legislature.â€Â  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \r\n  Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989).Â  â€œ[W]ords used therein \r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced \r\n  construction to limit or expand its operation.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. \r\n  v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â Â  â€œThe language \r\n  must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords \r\n  with its general purpose.â€Â  Id.\r\nExamining \r\n  the terms of the lease, we find the language in the lease agreement that the \r\n  tenant shall â€œuse and occupy the premises as desired, including the construction \r\n  of a dwelling, etc., thereonâ€ is not sufficient to convey to McClary the right \r\n  to sublease the property.Â  Therefore, applying the plain meaning of S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-35-60 to the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that absent \r\n  Nexsenâ€™s written consent, the sublease between McClary and Appellants is a nullity. \r\n  See Dobyns v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation and Tourisim, 252 \r\n  S.C. 97, 103, 480 S.E.2d 81, 84 (1997) (where our supreme court refused to adopt \r\n  a reasonableness requirement into a lease that permitted subleasing â€œupon the \r\n  consent of the leasorâ€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
