Fuller (Husband) appeals the awards of equitable distribution, alimony, and expert fees to his former wife, Elaine M. Fuller (Wife).Â  Husband also appeals the finding that a real estate holding company was a marital asset.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married in 1980, and two children were born of the marriage:Â  William in 1982, and Brittany in 1985.Â  When the couple first married, Wife was employed at South Carolina National Bank.Â  Later, the couple moved to Charlotte and Wife began working in a clothing boutique.Â  During this time, Husband worked at Owens Corning.Â  While Husband and Wife lived in Charlotte, they became interested in selling real estate and attended classes.Â  Upon finishing, they relocated to Greenville, where both still reside.Â  Wife continued to work in real estate until the birth of the coupleâ€™s children.Â  At that point, Wife became the party primarily responsible for caring for the children and taking care of the home.Â  The couple and their children lived an affluent lifestyle.Â  The parties had a large home in an exclusive area of Greenville, belonged to a country club, and took numerous family vacations.Â  Wife stated that she did not really think about money and bought whatever she wanted for herself and the children.Â  \r\nEarly in the marriage, Husband began to work at American Federal Bank and simultaneously began a residential construction company, Fulco Homes (Fulco).Â  Husband and Wife were each fifty percent shareholders in the company.Â  After eight years, Husband was able to pursue Fulco full-time.Â  In exchange for periodically working as a decorator and doing whatever else needed to be done for Fulco, Wife received a salary of $18,000 from Fulco.Â  Husband began Fulco with a loan from his aunt that he repaid in monthly installments with interest.Â  When Husbandâ€™s aunt died, the unpaid balance of the loan amounted to over $200,000.Â  However, Husband was the beneficiary of auntâ€™s estate, and the debt was forgiven.Â  Â \r\nHusband and Wife each had interests in numerous companies.Â  In 1989, Husband formed CF Enterprises, a real estate holding company, with his cousin, Ben Crumpler.Â  Wifeâ€™s father started Maxwell Family, LLC, (Maxwell Family), which owned a one-third interest in Stonehaven Subdivision Development and various other properties held just for investment purposes.Â  Wifeâ€™s father gave a fifteen point ninety-four percent interest in Maxwell Family to Wife and a five percent interest to Husband.Â  Both of these interests were gifts, and it is undisputed they are nonmarital.Â  In 2002, Wife received $74,000 from Maxwell Family and Husband received $26,000.Â  In 2003, by the time of the final hearing, Wife received $38,000 and expected to receive around $4,000 more.Â  Because the neighborhood was being â€œdeveloped out,â€ there were fewer lots remaining and eventually the income from Maxwell Family would dissipate.Â  Additionally, the partiesâ€™ company, Fulco, did most of its building in the Stonehaven Subdivision.Â  \r\nWife had interests in other family enterprises, including Maxwell Road Developers[1] and the Maxwell Family Trust.Â  Wifeâ€™s father also conveyed to Wife a one-ninth interest in Kensington Apartments, LLC (Kensington), which owned and managed one hundred sixty-eight apartment units.Â  Wife received an income from Kensington of $2,500 per month.Â  Â \r\nIn March 2002, Wife discovered Husband was having an affair, and she and Brittany moved to one of the apartment units at Kensington.Â  On April 4, 2002, Wife filed the underlying action, seeking divorce on the ground of adultery, custody of Brittany, child support, alimony, and equitable division of the marital estate.Â  Husband admitted his misconduct and also requested equitable division of the marital estate.Â  At the temporary hearing, the family court awarded Wife custody of Brittany and ordered Husband to pay $1,800 a month in unallocated support.Â  \r\nThe final hearing was held in October 2003. Â Husband and Wife agreed that the assets should, for the most part, be split evenly between the two.Â  Although Wife blamed the breakup of the marriage on Husbandâ€™s adultery, Husband blamed Wifeâ€™s overspending and the partiesâ€™ disagreements on rearing the children.Â  After hearing testimony from both Husband and Wife, the family court granted Wife a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  The family court found custody was not an issue because both children were over the age of eighteen, but the court ordered child support of $583 per month to support Brittany throughout her senior year of high school.Â  The court also ordered Husband to pay Wife periodic alimony in the amount of $1,200 per month.Â  \r\nThe court ordered a split of the remaining marital assets with forty-nine percent going to Husband and fifty-one percent going to Wife.Â  This included CF Enterprises, which Husband maintained was nonmarital.Â  The court ordered Husband to sell the marital home and awarded him eighty-five percent of the houseâ€™s proceeds after the mortgage was fully paid.Â  The court used the appraisal commissioned by Husband in assessing the value of the home for $650,000. Â Wife received several bank accounts and an IRA worth $250,000.Â  Finally, the court ordered Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and various fees for experts used in assessing the value of the marital property.Â  \r\nHusband filed a timely motion to reconsider and argued, inter alia, that the marital home sold for $615,000 after the final hearing rather than the appraised value of $650,000.Â  Husband asserted that because the court awarded him eighty-five percent of the proceeds of the house, his share of the marital assets was substantially reduced and he received closer to forty percent rather than the fifty percent envisioned by the parties.Â  Further, Husband contended he was further prejudiced because the IRA, which the court awarded Wife, substantially increased after the final hearing.Â  On reconsideration, the court adjusted the distribution to account for the inadvertent double counting of the value of a life insurance policy and likewise reduced Wifeâ€™s interest in Husbandâ€™s 401k to effectuate a fifty-one/forty-nine split.Â  The court denied Husbandâ€™s requests to consider the post-hearing increase in the value of the IRA and the actual sales price of the marital home in adjusting the marital distribution. Â This appeal followed. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact the family court, who saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Â Â Â Â  Equitable Division\r\nWe first consider the equitable distribution award.Â  Husband argues the family courtâ€™s error in using the value of the marital home and the IRA provided at the time of the final hearing resulted in Husband receiving only a forty-two percent distribution of the marital assets.Â  Specifically, Husband contends that in the six months between the time of the final hearing and when the family court issued the divorce decree, the marital home sold for $35,000 less than the appraisal and the IRA that was awarded to Wife increased in value by $40,000.Â  Therefore, Husband maintains the family courtâ€™s error resulted in his distribution of the marital estate being only forty-two percent rather than the fifty percent the parties agreed to.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Time of Valuation \r\nGenerally, in South Carolina marital property subject to equitable distribution is valued as of the date marital litigation is commenced.Â  Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 186, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686 (Ct. App. 2000); see Jamar v. Jamar, 308 S.C. 265, 267, 417 S.E.2d 615, 616 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œThe proper date to value marital property is the time the marital litigation is filed or commenced.â€). Â Â However, â€œthe parties may be entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation but before divorce.â€Â  Fields, 342 S.C. at 186, 536 S.E.2d at 686 (emphasis added); Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[G]iven the volume of cases handled by our family courts, there often is a substantial delay between commencement of an action and its ultimate resolution.Â  Thus, it is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change, sometimes substantially, between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution.Â  In such a case, the family court has the ability to consider the post-filing appreciation or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.â€).\r\nIn the present case, Husband argues the family court erred in the date on which it valued the marital home and the IRA.Â  Initially, we note that the family court valued the IRA at $250,798.Â  The family court used the IRAâ€™s value on the date the final hearing was held rather than the value on the date litigation was commenced.Â  Although the family court did not specify a reason for departing from the general rule that the valuation occurs the date litigation begins, we find the departure benefited Husband.Â  The family court awarded Wife the IRA and any increase in value was taken into account because the family court gave each party nearly fifty percent of the marital estate.Â  \r\nHusband cites Mallet v. Mallet, 323 S.C. 141, 473 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. 1996), for the proposition that when marital property depreciates or appreciates through no fault of either party, it would be â€œgrossly unfairâ€ not to adjust the value.Â  Mallet, 323 S.C. at 151, 473 S.E.2d at 810.Â  Husband fails to realize, however, that Mallet affirmed valuation of a spouseâ€™s business at the time of the final hearing where the business had declined in value since commencement of the divorce action.Â  Id.Â  We are aware of no case law, and Husband points to none, that requires the family court to reassess any increase in value that occurs after the final hearing.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err by failing to consider the IRAâ€™s increase after the final hearing.Â  \r\nA real estate appraiser, hired by Husband, testified at the final hearing that the value of the marital home was $650,000.[2]Â  The final hearing occurred in October 2003, the family court issued the divorce decree on April 2, 2004, and the house sold on May 12, 2004, for $615,000.Â  Because the house sold after the family court issued the divorce decree, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s failure to reconsider the valuation of the house.Â  Further, the family court has broad discretion in valuing marital property, and we discern no error in the courtâ€™s reliance on the value presented by Husbandâ€™s expert.Â  See Fields, 342 S.C. at 187, 536 S.E.2d at 686 (â€œThe family court has broad discretion in valuing marital property such that this Court will affirm when the findings below are supported by the evidence.â€).\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Distribution\r\nHusband argues the distribution of the partiesâ€™ assets and debts were unfair to him because the family courtâ€™s valuation of the house and IRA resulted in Husband receiving only forty-two percent of the marital assets.Â  We disagree.\r\nAbsent an abuse of discretion, the apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  On appeal, we look to the overall fairness of the apportionment and if the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant if we would have arrived at a different apportionment.Â  Id.  \r\nIn determining an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must identify, value, and then equitably apportion the property.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 288 S.C. 270, 276, 341 S.E.2d 811, 815 (Ct. App. 1986).Â Â  The court must consider several factors in making an equitable distribution.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2005) (outlining fifteen factors for the family court to consider in equitable distribution).Â  Included in those factors is the marital misconduct of either party.Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 20-7-472(2) (Supp. 2005) (noting that marital fault is one of the factors to be considered). \r\nAt the final hearing, both parties indicated they believed a fifty-fifty split of the marital assets would be fair.Â  In equitably dividing the marital estate, the family court relied on the values of the assets presented at trial, including the $650,000 value of the marital home and the then-current value of the IRA. Â The award to Wife amounted to fifty-one percent of the marital estate, while the Husbandâ€™s award was forty-nine percent.Â  At the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, the family court realized that one asset was counted twice.Â  The court requested assistance from the partiesâ€™ attorneys on how best to recalculate the distribution to stay within the â€œ49/51 split.â€Â  The order on reconsideration adjusted the distribution to stay within those percentages.Â Â  Â \r\nAs previously addressed, we believe the family court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the values of the home and the IRA at the time of the final hearing.Â  Although the marital home was still for sale at the time of the final hearing, thus the final value was uncertain, Husbandâ€™s appraisal valued the home at $650,000.Â  The court awarded Husband eighty-five percent of the houseâ€™s proceeds.Â  In light of the fact the court attributed the break-up of the marriage to Husbandâ€™s infidelity, it was not unfair that Husband should be the bearer of the risk that the house should sell for less than the appraisal.Â  Likewise, the increase or decrease in the value of the IRA after the final hearing was uncertain and subject to fluctuating market conditions.Â  We find no error with the courtâ€™s failure to predict the uncertainties of the market in making a final distribution.Â  \r\nThe family court effectuated a nearly even split of the marital assets given the definite values presented at the final hearing.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court.[3]Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in ordering him to pay Wife permanent periodic alimony in the amount of $1,200 per month.Â  Husband contends the family court failed to take into account Wifeâ€™s considerable nonmarital assets.Â  We agree.\r\nAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship, and its purpose is to place the supported spouse as close to the position of support enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The decision to grant or deny alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Williams v. Williams, 297 S.C. 208, 210, 375 S.E.2d 349, 350 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œAlimony should not dissuade a spouse, to the extent possible, from becoming self-supporting.â€ Â Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 525, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004). Â There are several factors the family court must consider in deciding whether to award alimony: \r\n\r\n(1) the duration of the marriage and the ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at separation; (2) the physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse and the need for additional education; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated income of each spouse; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses of each spouse; (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) the custody of any children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) the tax consequences of the award; (12) the existence of support obligations to a former spouse; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005); Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1994) (noting the statute â€œsets forth 12 factors which must be weighed when determining alimonyâ€).Â  The family court may weigh these factors as it finds appropriate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005) (â€œIn making an award of alimony . . . the court must consider and give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors.â€).\r\nAt the temporary hearing, Wife submitted a financial declaration showing expenses for herself and Brittany, then eighteen, of $4,358 per month.Â  Without explanation, Wifeâ€™s financial declaration at the final hearing showed expenses of $9,243 per month.Â  After Husband and Wife separated, Wife purchased a home for herself from Kensington for $200,000[4] and extensively remodeled the home for an additional $100,000.Â  Wife also managed to save $50,000, and her nonmarital assets were valued at $603,901.Â  Â \r\nIn the final order, the family court found Wife had primarily been a homemaker and mother.Â  The court found that Wife had an income of $2,500 per month from Kensington and then imputed to her an additional earning capacity of $1,200.Â  In assessing Wifeâ€™s income, the court did not include any future payments from Maxwell Family because the amount Wife would receive in the future was too uncertain.Â  The court reasoned that Wife would no longer have income from Fulco, which was awarded to Husband, and that her employment decisions changed as a result of her role as homemaker and mother.Â  The court found that even though Husbandâ€™s financial declaration showed a monthly deficit, with expenses of $7,795.18 and a net income of only $4,986, he had been able to pay the $1,800 a month of unallocated support to Wife that was granted at the temporary hearing, stating â€œ[a]lthough [Husband] shows a monthly deficit it is obvious . . . he has the ability to make the alimony payment out of his income as he has done so . . . and . . . the most recent financial declaration does not reflect [Husband] has incurred an additional indebtedness nor invaded any assets to meet his monthly deficit.â€Â  In the portion of the order addressing Wifeâ€™s entitlement to alimony, the court merely stated that Wife had â€œdemonstrated a need and [Husband] has shown an ability to pay alimony.â€Â Â  \r\nIt is difficult for this court to discern what factors the family court considered in awarding Wife alimony.Â  The family court only cited Husbandâ€™s ability to pay and Wifeâ€™s â€œneedâ€ in awarding alimony.Â  It is unclear which of Wifeâ€™s financial declarations the court relied upon in determining Wifeâ€™s â€œneed.â€Â  It does not appear the court considered that Wifeâ€™s expenses nearly doubled from the time between the temporary and final hearing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(7) (Supp. 2005) (stating that court must consider â€œthe current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spousesâ€).[5]Â  It is also unclear whether the court considered Wifeâ€™s substantial nonmarital assets in determining her â€œneed.â€Â  Moreover, the family courtâ€™s order did not state how it arrived at Wifeâ€™s imputed income nor did it consider the fact that Husbandâ€™s testimony revealed that he incurred approximately $49,000 to $50,000 worth of debt since the couple separated.Â  \r\nWe recognize that the family court could weigh the statutory factors as it deemed appropriate.Â  Because the court relied only on Wifeâ€™s need and Husbandâ€™s ability to pay alimony in making its determination, we believe the court erred by not also considering Wifeâ€™s nonmarital assets.Â  Further, although different portions of the order note the length of the marriage, the partiesâ€™ health, Husbandâ€™s infidelity, and Wifeâ€™s income potential, it does not appear from the order that the court considered these matters in awarding alimony.Â  We agree with Husband that the family court failed to consider all the statutory factors in awarding Wife alimony.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the alimony award and remand the matter for a hearing to determine Wifeâ€™s entitlement to alimony based upon a consideration of all the statutory factors.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  CF Enterprises\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in finding CF Enterprises was a marital asset.Â  He argues the money used to start the company was a gift from his aunt and is a nonmarital asset.Â  We disagree.\r\nMarital property is generally defined as all real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation, regardless of how legal title is held.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005).Â  However, property is considered nonmarital if it is acquired by gift or inheritance. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1) (Supp. 2005).Â  Because of the general presumption that property acquired during the marriage is an asset of the marriage, the burden to show an asset is nonmarital is upon the party claiming the nonmarital status.Â  Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 356, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nCF Enterprises had two stockholders, Husband and his cousin, and they started it with an initial investment of $15,000 each.Â  Husband maintains no marital money was used to start or finance the company and that the money he used was a gift from his aunt.Â  Wife contends the money Husband used was a loan from his aunt.Â  During the hearing, Husband offered no proof by way of check or testimony that CF Enterprises was nonmarital.Â  Additionally, his financial declaration stated the source of the company was a â€œloan.â€Â  Because Husband did not produce evidence to rebut the presumption that CF Enterprises was marital, we find the family court did not err.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that CF Enterprises was an asset of the marriage.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Expert Fees\r\nFinally, the Husband contests the award of expert fees to Wife.Â  He maintains Wife failed to produce evidence to support the award.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough alimony and suit money is provided for by statute, â€œthe claim must be â€˜well foundedâ€™ [and the] burden of proving that a claim is well founded is on the party seeking suit money.â€ Â Taylor v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 209, 220, 508 S.E.2d 50, 56 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-120); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-120 (Supp. 2005) (noting that a party in a divorce action may request attorneyâ€™s fees and costs and the court shall grant a reasonable sum if the claim appears â€œwell-foundedâ€).\r\nThe family court ordered Husband to pay $2,222 for Wifeâ€™s forensic economist and $682 for copies of documents Wife made for the C.P.A.Â  Wife testified that forensic economist Dr. Charles Alford gave her â€œa wonderful three or four page sheet with the little details that [she] needed to think of what [she] would spend.â€Â  Dr. Alford did not testify nor did Wife affirmatively establish what services he performed.Â  Further, Wife testified that she paid for $682 worth of copies from the C.P.A. but produced no receipt.Â  Wife had the burden to establish her claim was well-founded.Â  Because she produced no evidence supporting the award of fees other than her brief reference to their existence, we find the family court abused its discretion in ordering Husband to pay these fees.Â  Accordingly, we reverse these awards.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Maxwell Family has a one-third interest in Maxwell Road Developers.\r\n[2] Despite the appraisal, Husband listed the house for $669,000 and the house remained on the market for over a year before selling.Â  \r\n[3] Â Husband also argues that the family court erred in awarding him the Thornblade Country Club membership because neither party would benefit from it once the house in the Thornblade community was sold.Â  However, in his motion for reconsideration and in his arguments at the motion hearing, Husband argued the family court erred in the value assigned to the membership because he would be unable to sell it.Â  Because Husband did not raise the lack of â€œbenefitâ€ argument before the family court below, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that an issue not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge is not preserved for appellate review).Â  Similarly, Husbandâ€™s argument that the family court unfairly considered his adultery in equitably dividing the property was not raised before the family court and is not preserved.Â  Id.Â  \r\n[4] Kensington bought the house for $269,000 and then Wife bought the house from Kensington for $200,000 with a bank loan.Â  \r\n[5] There was also some evidence Wifeâ€™s financial declaration was inflated.Â  For example, Wifeâ€™s financial declaration shows an expense of $457 per month for Brittanyâ€™s private high school when her testimony revealed a family trust pays for Brittanyâ€™s schooling.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4151","title":"State v.

Â The responding law enforcement officials and emergency medical technicians arrived at the abode to find the nearly seventy-year-old woman recently battered and cut, very frightened and with blood on her face.Â  Geigerâ€™s driverâ€™s license was found on the coffee table and his clothing was discovered in the bathroom. Â Before being sent to the hospital, Annie J. identified Geiger as her assailant.Â  \r\nGeiger was arrested and indicted for ACSC.Â  At trial, Annie J. detailed the eveningâ€™s events, albeit at times she was somewhat difficult to decipher, her speech slurred from an earlier stroke. Â She testified that Geiger was an acquaintance of her sonâ€™s and had been in her house on several previous occasions.Â  Although Geigerâ€™s appearance at her home was uninvited on this particular evening, she had voluntarily allowed him inside.Â  Annie J. averred that, at his request, she provided Geiger with a liquor drink.Â  She did not imbibe.Â  In recounting her attack, Annie J. said after excusing himself to the bathroom, Geiger returned naked and brandishing her pistol.Â  Although at times in her testimony, Annie J. seemed uncertain as to the exact location and chronology of the events, she unequivocally described Geigerâ€™s behavior and acts against her.Â  She stated that Geiger demanded she give him money, slapped her in the head repeatedly, put the gun to her head, put his penis in her mouth, and attempted to force her legs apart to have sexual intercourse with her.Â  She asseverated she was able to prevent him from penetrating her and that, after the physical attack ended, Geiger searched her home for money and then left.\r\nThe emergency personnel responding to Annie J.â€™s telephone call described the victim as being very frightened and upset and recounted that her home was in a state of disarray. Â The sexual assault nurse who treated her at the hospital opined that Annie J.â€™s injuries were consistent with her description of the events.Â  DNA tests conclusively indicated the clothes found in the bathroom had been worn by Geiger. \r\nGeiger did not testify in his own defense.Â  He called no witnesses, but limited his defense to cross-examination of the prosecutionâ€™s witnesses. \r\nAt the close of the evidence, Geigerâ€™s attorney requested a charge of ABHAN. Â The circuit court refused the inclusion of the lesser charge, stating the record was devoid of evidence that Geiger committed ABHAN rather than ACSC. Â The jury found Geiger guilty of ACSC.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. Â State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion. Â State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 600 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004). Â In order for an error of law to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant. Â State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); see State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995).\r\nThis Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); Patterson, 367 S.C. at 224, 625 S.E.2d at 241; State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We do not reassess the facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determine whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003). Â This Court should examine the record to determine whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling. Â See Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 613 S.E.2d 760 (Ct. App. 2005); Mattison, 352 S.C. at 583, 575 S.E.2d at 855.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. ABHAN as a Lesser Included Offense of ACSC\r\nOn appeal, Geiger argues the trial court erred in failing to charge ABHAN as lesser included offense of ACSC.Â  Specifically, Geiger contends the evidence presented at trial supported an inference that he was guilty solely of the lesser included crime.Â  We disagree.\r\nGeiger was convicted of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652 (2003) provides:\r\n\r\n(1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim and if any one or more of the following circumstances are proven:\r\n  \r\n(a) The actor uses aggravated force to accomplish sexual battery.Â  \r\n(b) The victim submits to sexual battery by the actor under circumstances where the victim is also the victim of forcible confinement, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, burglary, housebreaking, or any other similar offense or act.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSexual battery is defined as â€œsexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of a personâ€™s body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another personâ€™s body, except when such intrusion is accomplished for medically recognized treatment or diagnostic purposes.â€ Â S.C. Â Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (2003).\r\nABHAN is â€œan unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.â€ Â State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 580, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002). Â As an element of ABHAN, circumstances of aggravation include, inter alia, the use of a deadly weapon, intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, difference in gender, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, and resistance to lawful authority. Â State v. Frazier, 302 S.C. 500, 397 S.E.2d 93 (1990); State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 21, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999); State v. Murphy, 322 S.C. 321, 471 S.E.2d 739 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nABHAN is a lesser included offense of ACSC, notwithstanding that technically ACSC does not contain all of the elements of ABHAN.Â  State v. Elliot, 346 S.C. 603, 606, 552 S.E.2d 727, 728 (2001), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005); State v. Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 340 S.E.2d 784 (1986).Â  Under the elements test, a crime will only be considered a lesser offense if the greater crime encompasses all of the elements of the lesser.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d. 773, 777 (1998).Â  However, we have recognized limited exceptions where an offense has traditionally been considered a lesser included offense of the greater.Â  Noting that ABHAN was historically considered a lesser included offense to ACSCâ€™s predecessor, assault with intent to ravage, the supreme court has expressly held ABHAN to be a lesser included offense of ACSC.Â  Elliot, 346 S.C at 606, 552 S.E.2d at 728; Drafts, 288 S.C. at 30, 340 S.E.2d at 784.\r\nII. Charging Lesser Included Offenses\r\nWhile upon indictment for a greater offense a trial court has the requisite jurisdiction to charge and convict a defendant of any lesser included offense,Â  see Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 233, 522 S.E.2d 845, 854 (Ct. App. 1999); Tyndall, 336 S.C. at 21, 518 S.E.2d at 285, a lesser included offense instruction is required only when the evidence warrants such an instruction.Â  State v. Mitchell, 362 S.C. 289, 301, 608 S.E.2d 140, 143 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Coleman, 342 S.C. 172, 175 536 S.E.2d 387, 389 (Ct. App. 2000). Â â€œThe law to be charged is determined by the evidence presented at trial.â€ State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241 (1996) (emphasis added); accord, State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Todd; 290 S.C. 212, 214, 349 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1986).Â  To justify charging the lesser crime, the evidence presented must allow a rational inference the defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.Â  See Tyndall, 336 S.C. at 22, 518 S.E.2d at 285.Â  The court looks to the totality of evidence in evaluating whether such an inference has been created.Â  See id. (in deciding whether the evidence tended to show the defendant was guilty of the lesser included offense, the court looked at the â€œreasonable inference[s] to be drawn from the totality of the evidenceâ€).Â  The trial court should refuse to charge the lesser included offense when there has been no evidence tending to show the defendant may have committed solely the lesser offense.Â  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994).\r\nGeiger recites the well established rule that, â€œ[t]he trial judge is to charge a jury on a lesser included offense if there is any evidence from which it could be inferred that the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was committed.â€Â  State v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 375, 563 S.E.2d 336, 337 (2002); Gourdine, 322 S.C. at 398, 472 S.E.2d at 241; accord Brighton v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 350-351, 520 S.E.2d 614 615 (1999); State v. Mathis, 287 S.C. 589, 594, 340 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1986).Â  Conversely, â€œ[a] lesser included offense instruction is required only when the evidence warrants such an instruction, and it is not error to refuse to charge the lesser included offense unless there is evidence tending to show the defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.â€Â  Tyndall, 336 S.C. at Â 21, 518 S.E. 2d 278, 285; accord State v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 543 (2004); State v. Cooney (320 S.C. 107, 112, 463 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1995); Murphy, 322 S.C. at 326, 471 S.E.2d at 741.\r\nIn State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. at 233, 522 S.E.2d at 854, the court edified: â€œ[i]n order to justify a charge of a lesser included offense, the evidence must be capable of sustaining either the greater or the lesser offense, depending on the juryâ€™s view of the facts.â€Â  See Tyndall, 336 S.C. at 21-22, 518 S.E.2d at 285; State v. Small, 307 S.C. 92, 94, 413 S.E.2d 870, 871 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The rule is articulated with exactitude in Dempsey v. State: â€œA judge is required to charge a jury on a lesser-included offense â€˜if there is any evidence from which it could be inferred the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was committed.â€™â€ 363 S.C. 365, 371, 610 S.E.2d 812, 815 (2005) (emphasis omitted from the original) (quoting Gourdine, 322 S.C. at 398, 472 S.E.2d at 242).\r\nIII. Application in the Case Sub Judice\r\nGeiger contends the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support an ABHAN instruction.Â  In furtherance of this position, he professes that the victimâ€™s testimony was â€œcurious,â€ opining it would be unlikely for Annie J. to have invited him into her home for late night â€œBiblical talkâ€ and a drink of vodka.Â  Implicitly, he asserts: (1) her age and medical history may have impaired her ability to recount the events of the evening in question and (2) Annie J.â€™s testimony exposed some confusion as to the chronological order and exact room where certain events during the attack occurred.Â  Geiger admits the state presented considerable evidence showing that he was in Annie J.â€™s home at the time she was assailed; however, he advances the position that no forensic evidence of sexual assault was ever produced.\r\nThe mere contention that the jury might accept the Stateâ€™s evidence in part and reject it in part is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that some evidence tend to show the defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.Â  See State v. Funchess, 267 S.C. 427, 229 S.E.2d 331 (1976) (â€œthe [p]resence of evidence to sustain the crime of a lesser degree determines whether it should be submitted to the jury and the â€˜mere contention that the jury might accept the Stateâ€™s evidence in part and might reject it in part will not suffice.â€™â€) (quoting State v. Hicks, 241 N.C. 156, 159-160, 84 S.E.2d 545, 547 (1954));Â  see also Tyndall, at 22, 518 S.E.2d at 285 (possibility that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s evidence as to the circumstances of aggravation and on the remaining evidence found the defendant guilty of simple assault and battery did not entitle the defendant to have the lesser offense submitted to the jury where there was no evidence tending to show defendant was guilty only of simple assault and battery); State v. Rucker, 319 S.C. 95, 98-99, 459 S.E.2d 858, 860 (Ct. App. 1995) (contention that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s evidence as to the circumstances of aggravation and on the remaining evidence found appellant guilty of the lesser offense of simple assault and battery did not entitle her to have the lesser offense submitted to the jury where appellant presented no evidence she committed some act that could be viewed by the jury as a simple assault); State v. Hartley, 307 S.C. 239, 241-42, 414 S.E.2d 182, 184 (Ct. App. 1992) (where there was no evidence that showed defendant killed victim without malice, trial judge did not err in refusing to charge the jury on the crime of manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of the crime of murder); State v. Foxworth, 269 S.C. 496, 499, 238 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1977) (possibility that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s evidence as to the circumstances of aggravation in ABHAN trial and on the remaining evidence found defendant guilty of the lesser offense of simple assault and battery did not entitle him to have the lesser offense submitted to the jury where all the evidence admitted at trial pointed to the appellantâ€™s guilt of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature).\r\nThe supreme courtâ€™s analysis in Dempsey v. State is particularly instructive.Â  363 S.C. 365, 610 S.E.2d 812 (2005).Â  In appealing his conviction for sexually assaulting his stepson, Dempsey asserted, inter alia, that the evidence warranted having ABHAN charged to the jury.Â  At trial, the victim testified that on multiple occasions Dempsey forced him to perform various sexual acts.Â  Additionally, the victim and his aunt both gave testimony as to occasions when Dempsey acted violently toward the victim.Â  In holding an ABHAN charge was not required, the supreme court found there was no evidence from which it could be inferred that ABHAN rather than ACSC was committed.Â  The court reasoned that while there was evidence of conduct that could be construed as ABHAN, none of the incidents was alleged to have occurred instead of the sexual batteries. Â Id.\r\nIn State v. Fields our court addressed a similar factual and legal scenario with academic precision.Â  356 S.C. 517, 589 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The victim testified that Fields used a combination of trickery, threats, and physical force to get her into an abandoned house, where, once inside, he threw her about the structure, ordered her to perform sexual acts, and forced her to have intercourse.Â  In addition to the victimâ€™s testimony, the prosecution presented expert testimony that her injuries were consistent with someone who had been sexually assaulted and that semen found in her underwear matched that of the defendant.Â  Fields, who did not testify or present any evidence on his own behalf, was convicted of criminal sexual conduct.Â  On appeal he argued the jury could reasonably have found the sex consensual by disbelieving a portion of the victimâ€™s testimony and that he was therefore entitled to jury instructions on ABHAN.Â  The court concluded the mere contention the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s evidence that the sex was forced and on the remaining evidence found him guilty of ABHAN did not entitle Fields to have the lesser charge submitted to the jury.Â  Although recognizing that at trial the defense counsel suggested the sex was willful, the court nonetheless found the record devoid of any evidence tending to show Fields guilty only of ABHAN, noting that both the victimâ€™s testimony of her assault and the attending physicianâ€™s opinion that her injuries indicated nonconsensual sex were uncontested.Â  Id. Â \r\nGeiger relies upon two cases, State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 472 S.E.2d 241 (1996), and State v. Mathis, 287 S.C. 589, 340 S.E.2d 538 (1986), which can be clearly distinguished from the case at hand. Â In Mathis, the defendant was charged with the crime of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the first degree for engaging in sexual battery with a victim less than eleven years old (assault with intent to commit CSC was not charged).Â  At trial, the victim testified the defendant touched her with his penis, but also stated she could not remember if he ever put it inside her.Â  The greater crime, CSC, required some â€œintrusion, however slightâ€ of the victim. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (2003). Â Thus, the victimâ€™s uncertainly on this issue served as evidence on which a jury could find the defendant committed the lesser, rather the greater, offense.Â  In Gourdine, the greater crime at issue, armed robbery, required use of a deadly weapon.Â  At trial, three different witnesses testified that a BB gun, water gun, toy, or fake gun was used in the commission of the robbery, which the court held was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found the lesser crime of strong arm robbery had been committed.\r\nThe trial record in the case at bar contains no evidence tending to show Geiger may have assaulted Annie J. but not attempted a sexual battery.Â  The victimâ€™s undisputed testimony recounting Geigerâ€™s efforts to sexually assault her supports only an ACSC instruction, not one of ABHAN.Â  Barring some confusion as to the precise location where the events transpired, Annie J. consistently reported exactly what occurred.Â  She verified, without contradiction, that Geiger came out of the bathroom naked, put a gun to her head, hit her repeatedly on the head, forced his penis into her mouth, and tried to force her legs open to have intercourse with her.Â  Her testimony was further corroborated by the discovery of Geigerâ€™s clothes in her bathroom, her physical injuries, and the testimony of witnesses as to her mental state and demeanor immediately following the incident.Â  It is inconsequential that there was no forensic evidence of sexual assault.Â  The medical examiner testified that Annie J.â€™s injuries were consistent with the victimâ€™s narrative of the events and that the lack of direct evidence of a sexual assault conformed with Annie J.â€™s testimony that Geiger was never able to penetrate her.\r\nThe trial judge did not err in denying Geigerâ€™s request to charge the lesser included offense of ABHAN. Â There is no evidence tending to show Geiger was guilty solely of the lesser crime. Â The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence was that Geiger either did or did not commit ACSC.Â  The mere contestation that the jury might have disbelieved Annie J.â€™s testimony as to the sexual acts and nature of Geigerâ€™s assault does not entitle him to have the jury charged with the lesser offense of ABHAN.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBecause the record is devoid of evidence that Geiger was guilty only of the lesser included offense, the trial court did not err by refusing to charge the jury with ABHAN.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4152","title":"Bennett v.

Powell, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent CBS Surveying and Mapping, Inc. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this dispute over liability for a surveying error, Kenneth E. Bennett, Richard K. Bennett, James M. Hendershot, and Robert N. Parker, III, (collectively Appellants), appeal the circuit courtâ€™s orders granting summary judgment to Crescent Resources, LLC and Investors Title Insurance Company.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 28, 2001, Crescent conveyed 47.82 acres of real property in Oconee County (the Property) to Bristol, LLC for $2.5 million.Â Â  Crescentâ€™s deed to Bristol (the Deed), entitled â€œSpecial Warranty Deed,â€ contains a granting clause referring to an attached property description, which, in turn, incorporates a plat (the Plat).Â  CBS Surveying and Mapping, Inc. prepared the Plat for Crescent on December 22, 2000.Â  The Plat shows a sixty-six foot right-of-way easement, entitled â€œSC 188 KEOWEE SCHOOL RD (66â€™ R/W),â€ on the western boundary of the Property.Â Â  \r\nThe habendum clause of the Deed reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nTO HAVE AND TO HOLD all and singular the Property, unto the said Grantee and Granteeâ€™s heirs, successors and assigns forever, except:\r\n  \r\nÂ . . . .\r\nÂ (5) matters affecting title to the Property as shown on the Plat or which would be shown on a current and accurate survey of the Property (including any encroachments);\r\n(6) easements, covenants, restrictions and conditions of record, and rights-of-way of public and private streets and roads, including, but not limited to, the road shown on the Plat as â€œold road bedâ€ and the sixty-six (66) foot wide road right-of-way shown on the Plat as â€œSC 188 Keowee School Road (66â€™ R/W)â€ . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Deed further provides that Crescent â€œcovenants to warrant specially the title to the Property against the lawful claims of any person claiming from, through, or under it.â€Â  \r\nLater on the same day, Bristol conveyed the Property by general warranty deed to Appellants.Â  Anticipating this conveyance, Investors issued a title insurance commitment to Executive Properties, LLC.Â  This commitment agreed to provide an ownerâ€™s title insurance policy to Executive.[1]Â  On January 4, 2002, Appellants procured from Investors an ownerâ€™s title insurance policy (the Policy) covering the Property.Â  The Policy expressly â€œdoes not insure against loss or damage (and [Investors] will not pay costs, attorneysâ€™ fees or expenses) which arise by reason of . . . [s]uch state of facts as would be disclosed by a current and accurate survey of said premises.â€Â  Â \r\nSubsequently, Appellants built two brick walls within forty-one feet of the centerline of South Carolina Highway 188.Â  On April 25, 2002, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) wrote Appellants, informing them SCDOT had a 200 foot right-of-way easement over the Property.Â  This right-of-way easement, dated August 1, 1968, and recorded at SCDOT shows Crescent granted the 200 foot right-of-way to SCDOT.[2]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-550 (2006) (directing all rights-of-way for state highways be filed at SCDOT). Â \r\nPresumably, Appellants notified Investors of this problem and demanded payment for their loss.Â  Investors alleged Appellants offered to settle the claim for $85,225.Â  Investors explained Appellants arrived at this number by appraising the Property, dividing that number by the total number of acres included in the Property, and applying that per acre value to the acreage mistakenly assumed to be unencumbered.Â  Investors further claimed it rejected this demand because the eastern portion of the Property bordered a lake, and this acreage would be valued higher than the portion bordering Highway 188.Â  Investors additionally asserted it hired the same appraiser Appellants used to value the specific acreage lost.Â  This appraiser valued the lost acreage at $64,000. \r\nAs a result, Investors sent Appellants a settlement check in the amount of $64,000 and a settlement agreement, which Appellants never executed.Â  Investors explained Appellants hired a different attorney, who rejected the settlement offer and demanded $196,800 to settle the claim, including the â€œvalue of the improvements that were required to be relocated and/or destroyed due to the title defect . . . .â€Â  Investors refused to pay this amount, claiming the title policy excluded consequential damages.Â  Appellants eventually agreed to settle the claim for the lost value of the Property for $64,000 but retained its consequential damages claim. \r\nOn June 26, 2003, Appellants filed a complaint against Investors, alleging breach of the title insurance contract and bad faith.Â  Investors answered and eventually filed an amended answer, including a third-party complaint against Crescent, Bristol, and CBS.Â  Appellants then filed an amended complaint, alleging a breach of deed warranty by Crescent and Bristol and negligence by CBS.Â  Crescent filed separate answers to Appellantsâ€™ amended complaint and Investorsâ€™ third-party complaint.[3]Â  \r\nIn June 2004, Investors moved for summary judgment against Appellants, explaining it attempted to settle the claim and Appellants had not answered its settlement offer.Â  According to Investors, the circuit court held a hearing on this motion, at which the parties discovered they possessed two different title insurance policy jackets with identical policy inserts.Â  The jacket relied upon by Investors excepted claims for consequential damages.Â  The circuit court allowed the parties time to supplement their arguments and Investors time to amend its motion.Â  \r\nIn August, Investors filed an amended motion for summary judgment against Appellants.Â  On January 11, 2005, Crescent moved for summary judgment against both Appellants and Investors.Â  In February 2005, Investors again amended its motion for summary judgment. \r\nThe circuit court granted Crescentâ€™s motion for summary judgment against both Appellants and Investors, holding exceptions (5) and (6) in the Deedâ€™s habendum clause limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court applied this ruling to Investors, finding Investors could not recover more than Appellants could recover.Â  Although not included in the record, Appellants and Investors filed motions to reconsider this order, which the circuit court denied.Â Â  However, the court entered an amended order, correcting minor factual errors.Â  \r\nSummary judgment was granted to Investors with respect to Appellantsâ€™ breach of contract and bad faith claims.Â  The circuit court held the Policy specifically excluded all matters a current and accurate survey would disclose, including the claim asserted here.Â  Appellants appealed both summary judgment orders.[4]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006); Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 219, 616 S.E.2d 722, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006); Eagle Container Co., LLCÂ  v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 620, 622 S.E.2d 733, 737 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go the jury. Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.E.2d 588, 595, 608 S.E.2d 587, 591 (Ct. App. 2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Law, 323 S.C. at 434, 629 S.E.2d at 648; BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 325, 608 S.E.2d 155, 159 (Ct.App.2005). On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below. Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 317, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct.App.2003) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005); Miller, 365 S.C. at 220, 616 S.E.2d at 729; Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004). Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct.App.2004). However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. Rife v. Hitachi Const. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 214, 609 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct. App. 2005); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 228, 612 S.E.2d 719, 722 (Ct. App. 2005). The moving party may discharge the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact by pointing out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partyâ€™s case. Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 349 S.E. 256, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002). Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings. Wogan v. Kunze, 366, S.C. 583, 591, 623, S.E.2d 107, 112 (Ct. App. 2005). The nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder. Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003); Eagle Container, 366 S.C. at 621, 622 S.E.2d at 738; Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 393, 593 S.E.2d 183, 186 (Ct.App.2004). Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues. Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 644, 594 S.E.2d 455, 462 (2004); Wogan, 366, S.C. at 592, 623, S.E.2d at 112; B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Appellants v. Crescent\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in holding exceptions (5) and (6) in the habendum clause of the Deed limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty.Â  Â Appellants argue (1) the granting clause and its incorporation of the Plat created a representation or covenant of the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way;Â  (2) Crescent failed to convey 47.82 acres of real property, as provided in the property description of the Deed; (3) the habendum clause was ambiguous; and (4) the Deedâ€™s special warranty clause automatically protects Bristol and subsequent purchasers against claims created by Crescent; otherwise, the Deed would be a quitclaim deed.Â  We disagree.\r\nA. Construction of the Deed\r\nThe construction of a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of\r\nlaw for the court.Â  Hammond v. Lindsay, 277 S.C. 182, 184, 284 S.E.2d 581, 582&nbsp;(1981); Hunt v. Forestry Commâ€™n,&nbsp;358 S.C. 564, 568, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004); see also Vause v. Mikell, 290 S.C. 65, 68, 348 S.E.2d 187, 189&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986) (â€œThe construction of an unambiguous deed is a question of law, not fact.â€).Â  â€œ â€˜[I]t is the duty of the court to construe deeds and determine their legal effect, where there is no such ambiguity as requires parol proof and submission to the jury.â€™ â€ Hunt, 358 S.C. at 569, 595 S.E.2d at 848 (quoting 26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 168 (2001)).\r\nâ€œOne of the first canons of construction of a deed is that the intention of the grantor must be ascertained and effectuated if no settled rule of law is contravened.â€Â  S. Ry. Co. v. Smoak,&nbsp;243 S.C. 331, 336, 133 S.E.2d 806, 808&nbsp;(1963); Wayburn v. Smith, 270 S.C. 38, 41, 239 S.E.2d 890, 892&nbsp;(1977); Estate of Sherman ex rel. Maddock v. Estate of Sherman ex rel. Snodgrass, 359 S.C. 407, 413, 597 S.E.2d 850, 853&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004); see also McDaniel v. Connor,&nbsp;206 S.C. 96, 100, 33 S.E.2d 75, 76&nbsp;(1945) (â€œAs has many times been said, the governing principle in the construction of deeds is that the intention of the grantor, if consistent with law, shall govern.â€).Â  Moreover, in ascertaining such\r\nintention, the deed must be construed as a whole and effect given to every part thereof, if such can be done consistently with law.Â  Wayburn, 270 S.C. at 42, 239 S.E.2d at 892; Bean v. Bean, 253 S.C. 340, 343, 170 S.E.2d 654, 655&nbsp;(1969); Alexander v. Burnet, 39 S.C.L. (5 Rich.) 189, 196 (1851); see also First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia v. Ford,&nbsp;177 S.C. 40, 46, 180 S.E. 562, 565&nbsp;(1935) (â€œLarger and more sensible rules of construction require that the whole deed should be considered together, and effect be given to every part, if all can stand together consistently with law . . . . â€).\r\nB. Clauses in the Deed\r\nGuided by our mandate to read the Deed as a whole, we examine the specific clauses therein.Â  The term â€œpremisesâ€ is used to refer to â€œall that part of [a] deed preceding the habendum clause, containing generally the names or description of the parties; explanatory recitals, including consideration and its receipt; a description of the realty; the exception, if any; and sometimes a designation of the estate or interest conveyed.â€Â  26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 35 (2001); see also Artis v. Artis, 47 S.E.2d 228, 232&nbsp;(N.C. 1948) (â€œOrdinarily the premises and granting clauses designate the grantee and the thing granted, while the habendum clause relates to the quantum of the estate.â€).Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, the term â€œgranting clauseâ€ is used.Â  This court in Hunt v. Forestry Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564, 566-67, 595 S.E.2d 846, 847&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004), referred to the following language in a deed as the â€œgranting clause:â€\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia . . . [has] granted, bargained, sold and released, and by these presents [does] grant, bargain, sell and release unto the said\r\n[SCFC] and their successors in office all that certain piece . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis removed); see also Estate of Sherman, 359 S.C. at 409, 597 S.E.2d at 850-51 (referring to similar language in another deed as the â€œgranting clauseâ€).Â  The granting clause in the Deed incorporates an attached property description which, in turn, incorporates the Plat.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Latin phrase â€œhabendum et tenendumâ€ means â€œto have and to hold.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 716 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Thus, in Hunt, 358 S.C. at 567, 595 S.E.2d at 847, this court quoted the habendum clause in that deed:Â  â€œTo Have and to Hold all and singular the premises before mentioned unto the said [SCFC] and their successors in office, and assigns forever.â€Â  (emphasis removed); see also Smoak v. McClure,&nbsp;236 S.C. 548, 549, 115 S.E.2d 55, 55&nbsp;(1960) (â€œThe\r\nhabendum clause is regular in form, as follows:\r\nâ€˜To have and to hold, all and singular, the said premises before mentioned unto the said Ben Garris, and his Heirs and Assigns forever.â€™ â€).Â  \r\nThe habendum â€œis the clause usually following the granting part of the premises of a deed, which defines the extent of the ownership in the thing granted to be held and enjoyed by the grantee.â€ 26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 36 (2001).Â  Accordingly, in South Carolina, â€œthe estate conveyed by the deed must be determined from the whole deed including the\r\nhabendum clause.â€Â  Batesburg-Leesville Sch. Dist. No. 3 v. Tarrant, 293 S.C. 442, 445, 361 S.E.2d 343, 345&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â  Luculently, the habendum clause in the Deed is the section beginning â€œTO HAVE AND TO HOLD . . .â€Â  \r\nThe habendum clause in the Deed is followed by Crescentâ€™s covenant to Bristol whereby Crescent â€œcovenants to warrant specially the title to the Property against the lawful claims of any person claiming from, through, or under it.â€Â  â€œThe doctrine of caveat emptor . . . has, in the absence of fraud and misrepresentation long governed the obligations of the parties in the sale of real estate in this State.â€Â  Rutledge v. Dodenhoff, 254 S.C. 407, 412, 175 S.E.2d 792, 794&nbsp;(1970).Â  In South Carolina, the purchaser of unimproved land must covenant to protect whatever special rights or interests he would presume to acquire in the land.Â  Jackson v. River Pines, Inc., 276 S.C. 29, 31, 274 S.E.2d 912, 913&nbsp;(1981); see also 21 C.J.S. Covenants Â§ 14 (1990) (â€œThe only protection of title afforded a purchaser of land is in the covenants contained in the deed.â€).Â  \r\nIn Martin v. Floyd, 282 S.C. 47, 51, 317 S.E.2d 133, 136 (Ct. App. 1984), this court explained:\r\n\r\nA South Carolina general warranty deed embraces all of the following five covenants usually inserted in fee simple conveyances by English conveyors: (1) that the seller is seized in fee; (2) that he has a right to convey; (3) that the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall quietly enjoy the land; (4) that the land is free from all encumbrances; and (5) for further assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\nA grantor seeking to include all the common law covenants of title may use the language in section 27-7-10 of the South Carolina Code to carry out this effect. The statute reads:\r\n\r\nThe following form or purport of a release shall, to all intents and purposes, be valid and effectual to carry from one person to another or others the fee simple of any land or real estate if it shall be executed in the presence of and be subscribed by two or more credible witnesses:\r\n  \r\nThe State of South Carolina.\r\nKnow all men by these presents that I, A B, of __________, in the State aforesaid, in consideration of the sum of ___ dollars, to me in hand paid by C D of __________ County, State of __________, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, have granted, bargained, sold and released and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell and release unto the said C D all that (here describe the premises), together with all and singular the rights, members, hereditaments and appurtenances to said premises belonging or in any wise incident or appertaining; to have and to hold all and singular the premises before mentioned unto said C D, his heirs and assigns, forever. And I do hereby bind myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, to warrant and forever defend all and singular said premises unto said C D, his heirs and assigns, against myself and my heirs and against every person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same, or any part thereof.\r\nWitness my hand and seal this ___ day of __________ in the year of our Lord __________ and in the ___ year of the independence of the United States of America. __________ [L.S.]\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-10 (Supp. 2005); see 17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§ 32 (Supp. 2005).Â  However, section 27-7-10 does not preclude the grantor from using other language of warranty in a deed. \r\n\r\nSection 27-7-10 shall be so construed as not to oblige any person to insert the clause of warranty or to restrain him from inserting any other clause in conveyances, as may be deemed proper and advisable by the purchaser and seller, or to invalidate the forms formerly in use within this State.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-20 (Supp. 2005).\r\nA â€œspecial warrantyâ€ is â€œ[a] warranty against any personâ€™s claim made by, through, or under the grantor or the grantorâ€™s heirs.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1581 (7th ed. 1999).Â  The deed at issue in Knotts v. Joiner,&nbsp;217 S.C. 99, 102, 59 S.E.2d 850, 851&nbsp;(1950), â€œwas a printed form but the warranty clause was so stricken with pen as to change it from the usual general warranty to a special warranty, that is, against the heirs of the grantor only.â€Â  A quitclaim deed, on the other hand, does not convey the fee, but only the right, title, and interest of the grantor.Â  Martin v. Ragsdale,&nbsp;71 S.C. 67, 77, 50 S.E. 671, 674&nbsp;(1905).\r\nC. Incorporation of the Plat\r\nAppellantsâ€™ first contention that the incorporation of the Plat creates a representation or covenant of the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way completely ignores the habendum and warranty clauses in the Deed.\r\nâ€œThe question as to the purpose and effect of a reference to a plat in a deed is ordinarily one as to the intention of the parties to be determined from the whole instrument and the circumstances surrounding its execution.â€Â  Lancaster v. Smithco, Inc., 246 S.C. 464, 468, 144 S.E.2d 209, 211&nbsp;(1965).Â  When a deed describes land as shown on a certain plat, such plat becomes part of the deed for the purpose of showing the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed.Â  Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 397, 252 S.E.2d 133, 136&nbsp;(1979); Carolina Land Co., Inc. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 105, 217 S.E.2d 16, 19&nbsp;(1975); see also Holly Hill Lumber Co. v. Grooms, 198 S.C. 118, 135, 16 S.E.2d 816, 823&nbsp;(1941) (â€œ â€˜As a general rule, when maps, plats, or field notes are referred to in a grant or conveyance they are to be regarded as incorporated into the instrument and are usually held to furnish the true description of the boundaries of the land . . . . â€™ â€) (citation omitted).\r\nIn Blue Ridge Realty Co. v. Williamson, 247 S.C. 112, 118, 145 S.E.2d 922, 925&nbsp;(1965), our Supreme Court stated the general rule that when the owner of land has it subdivided and platted into lots and streets and sells and conveys lots with reference to the plat, he thereby dedicates said streets to the use of such lot owners, their successors in title, and the public.Â  See also Carolina Land Co., 265 S.C. at 105, 217 S.E.2d at 19.Â  Thus, the purchaser of lots with reference to the plat of the subdivision acquires every easement, privilege and advantage shown upon said plat, including the right to the use of all the streets, near or remote, as laid down on the plat by which the lots are purchased.Â  Blue Ridge, 247 S.C. at 119-20, 145 S.E.2d at 925; Carolina Land Co., 265 S.C. at 105, 217 S.E.2d at 19.\r\nIn Lancaster, 246 S.C. at 469, 144 S.E.2d at 211, â€œ[t]he only reference in the deed in th[e] case to the plat was in connection with the description of the lot.â€Â  Therefore, such reference to the recorded plat made it a part of the deed for the purpose of showing the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed.Â  Id.Â  In that case, our Supreme Court edified:\r\n\r\nA plat, however, is not an index to encumbrances, and the mere reference in a deed, as in this case, to a plat for descriptive purposes does not incorporate a notation thereon as to an easement held by a third party so as to exclude such easement from the covenant against encumbrances in the absence of a clear intention that it so operate.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nBoth Blue Ridge and Lancaster look to the intention of the parties in incorporating a plat to determine its effect.Â  In the instant case, a reading of the Deed as a whole reveals the parties used the Plat as a reference to the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed.Â  However, Crescent unambiguously put the burden of obtaining an accurate survey on Appellants and excluded from its grant â€œmatters affecting title to the Property as shown on the Plat,â€ matters â€œwhich would be shown on a current and accurate survey of the Property,â€ and rights-of-way of public streets and roads.Â  Moreover, Appellants do not dispute â€œ[t]he actual dimensions and location of a highway right of way are things that will be revealed by a current and accurate survey of the property prepared by the surveyor.â€ The intention of the parties in incorporating the Plat, when discerned from the Deed as a whole, was to show the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed, not to represent or warranty the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way.\r\nD. Failure to Convey 47.82 Acres\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We observe Appellantsâ€™ second contention that Crescent failed to convey 47.82 acres of property directly contravenes well-established law in South Carolina.Â  Appellants essentially claim SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way, an easement, reduces the fee simple grant by the total acreage of the easement.Â  In Douglas v. Med. Investors, Inc., 256 S.C. 440, 445, 182 S.E.2d 720, 722&nbsp;(1971), respondent contended the reservation of an easement in a deed was â€œrepugnant to the fee simple title granted and is, therefore, ineffective.â€Â  Our Supreme Court noted:\r\n\r\nâ€˜An easement is a right which one person has to use the land of another for a specific purpose.â€™ Steele v. Williams, 204 S.C. 124, 28 S.E.2d 644; and â€˜gives no title to the land on which the servitude is imposed,â€™ Morris v. Townsend, 253 S.C. 628, 172 S.E.2d 819. An easement is therefore not an estate in lands in the usual sense.â€™\r\n\r\nId.Â  Thus, the court held the easement in that case â€œin no way cut down the fee simple estate conveyedâ€ and, therefore, â€œthe reservation of the easement following\r\nthe description in the deed was not repugnant to the fee simple title conveyed in the granting clause.â€Â  Id. at 445-46, 182 S.E.2d at 722.Â  \r\nReading the Deed as a whole, the granting clause conveyed fee simple title in 47.82 acres of property to Bristol. Therefore, Appellantsâ€™ second argument is without merit.\r\nE. The Habendum Clause\r\nAppellants complain the habendum clause is ambiguous.Â  Exception (6) in the habendum clause provides:\r\n\r\n[E]asements, covenants, restrictions and conditions of record, and rights-of-way of public and private streets and roads, including, but not limited to, the road shown on the Plat as â€œold road bedâ€ and the sixty-six (66) foot wide road right-of-way shown on the Plat as â€œSC 188 Keowee School Road (66â€™ R/W)â€ . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Appellants claim the emphasized language warrants the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way.Â  We agree the emphasized language indicates the parties assumed SCDOTâ€™s right of way was sixty-six feet wide.Â  However, all of the language in exception (6), read with the Deed as a whole, clearly and unambiguously placed the liability of error with respect to the Plat on Bristol and subsequent purchasers.Â  Under no possible construction of the habendum clause can Appellants claim they had a right to rely on the Plat and, if the Plat contained an error, seek damages from Crescent.\r\nF. Limitation on Special Warranty\r\nAppellants argue the special warranty clause in the Deed automatically provides protection against prior encumbrances created by Crescent.Â  To hold otherwise allegedly would render it a quitclaim deed.Â  A special warranty binds the grantor and the grantorâ€™s heirs.Â  See Knotts,&nbsp;217 S.C. 99, 102, 59 S.E.2d 850, 851 (1950).Â  However, â€œ[t]he grantor can, and often does, limit [covenants] so as to exclude existing encumbrances.â€Â  G.W. Thompson, Thompson on Real Property Â§ 82.10(c)(3) (Supp. 2005); see Â§ 27-7-20; see also Steele v. McRaney, 855 So. 2d 1114, 1122-23&nbsp;(Ala. Civ. App. 2003) (finding language grantee would take â€œsubject toâ€ matters a survey or inspection of the property would have uncovered prevented grantee from prevailing in breach of deed covenant claim); Kamenar R.R. Salvage, Inc. v. Ohio Edison Co., 607 N.E.2d 1108, 1113&nbsp;(Ohio Ct. App. 1992) (holding when a deed provides grantee would take subject to â€œthe state of facts which a personal inspection or accurate survey would disclose,â€ grantee has no claim against grantor for power line easement). \r\nHere, exceptions (5) and (6) in the habendum clause of the Deed limit Crescentâ€™s special warranty to Bristol.Â  Specifically, the exceptions put Bristol and subsequent purchasers on notice Crescent was not covenanting the Plat, matters which would be uncovered by a current and accurate survey, or public rights-of-way.Â  In this respect, Crescent did not covenant the Property would be free from all encumbrances.Â  Instead, in keeping with section 27-7-20, it limited its covenant to those encumbrances not excepted through the habendum clause. The circuit court did not err in finding exceptions (5) and (6) of the habendum clause limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty. \r\nII. Appellants v. Investors\r\nA. Policy Coverage\r\nAppellants maintain an ownersâ€™ title insurance policy always provides coverage against a surveying error.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œOwnersâ€™ title insurance policies generally exclude coverage for . . . matters which would be disclosed by an accurate survey and inspection of the premises.â€Â  16 Powell on Real Property Â§ 92.12 (2005); see also Stephen A. Spitz, Real Estate Transactions Cases and Materials 498 (2d ed. 1998) (â€œTitle commitments or policies often include an exception to those matters which a survey and examination of the ground would reveal.â€).Â  In Walker Rogge, Inc. v. Chelsea Title &amp; Guar. Co., 562 A.2d 208, 217&nbsp;(N.J. 1989), the Supreme Court of New Jersey explained the rationale behind this rule:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the survey exception is to exclude coverage when the insured fails to provide the insurer with a survey. From a search of relevant public records, a title company cannot ascertain the risks that an accurate survey would disclose. Â It is for this reason that the title company puts that risk on the insured, who\r\ncan control it either by obtaining a survey or arranging for the elimination of the survey exception. Â Thus, the very purpose of a survey exception is to exclude from coverage errors that would be revealed not by a search of public records, but by an accurate survey.\r\n\r\n(citation omitted); see also 16 Powell on Real Property Â§ 92-12[1] (2005) (â€œExtended coverage for survey matters is available upon request.Â  The extra coverage is more expensive than standard coverage and may require the purchase of a property survey.â€).Â  \r\nMoreover, a legion of case law recognizes title insurance policies using survey exceptions.Â  See, e.g., Daniel v. Coastal Bonded Title Co., 539 So. 2d 567, 568&nbsp;(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989); Heyd v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 354 N.W.2d 154, 155&nbsp;(Neb. 1984); U.S. Life Title Ins. Co. v. Hutsell, 296 S.E.2d 760, 763&nbsp;(Ga. Ct. App. 1982); Mims v. Louisville Title Ins. Co., 358 So. 2d 1028, 1028&nbsp;(Ala. 1978); Nautilus, Inc. v. Transam. Title Ins. Co., 534 P.2d 1388, 1391&nbsp;(Wash. Ct. App. 1975); Waterview Assocs., Inc. v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 186 N.W.2d 803, 803-04&nbsp;(Mich. Ct. App. 1971); Kuhlman v. Title Ins. Co., 177 F. Supp. 925, 926&nbsp;(W.D. Mo. 1959).[5]\r\nB. Title Commitment\r\nAppellants assert that Investorsâ€™ failure to put a survey exception in the title commitment rendered the survey exception in the Policy invalid.Â  Appellants did not preserve this issue for our review.Â  The circuit court did not rule on this issue, and Appellants did not seek a ruling on it in their Rule 59, SCRCP, motion.Â  See Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 235, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (â€œAn issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.â€); McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 381, 597 S.E.2d 181, 186&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nAdditionally, Appellants fail to cite any case law for this proposition and make only conclusory arguments in support thereof.Â  Thus, Appellants abandoned this issue on appeal.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (noting when an appellant fails to cite any supporting authority for his position and makes conclusory arguments, the appellant abandons the issue on appeal).Â  Consequently, we decline to address this issue.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s summary judgment order. Crescent did not represent or covenant the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way by incorporating the Plat.Â  Moreover, Crescent coveyed 47.82 acres of real property to Bristol.Â  The habendum clause unambiguously places the burden of a survey defect on Bristol and subsequent purchasers, and the circuit court correctly held exceptions (5) and (6) of the habendum clause limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty.\r\nWe decline to hold a title insurance policy always insures against surveying errors. Appellants failed to preserve the issue of whether the commitment precluded Investors from including the survey exception to the Policy.Â  Alternatively, Appellants offered only conclusory arguments to support this contention on appeal and, therefore, abandoned that argument.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J. and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Investors later referred to this commitment as one made to Appellants.Â  Appellants deeded the Property to Executive on June 10, 2002.Â  During a hearing, Appellantsâ€™ attorney indicated they had formed Executive â€œfor the purposes of developing the Property.â€Â  Executive is not a party to the circuit court proceedings or this appeal.\r\n[2] Crescent Resources, LLC conveyed the Property to Bristol. The Deed indicates Crescent Resources, LLC is â€œa successor by merger and conversion to Crescent Resources, Inc., whose name was changed from Crescent Land and Timber Corp.â€Â  Crescent Land and Timber Corp. granted the easement to SCDOT.Â Â  \r\n[3] Although our case caption lists CBS and Bristol as Respondents, the record does not include any pleadings, motions, or orders from these parties, except the transcript of a motion to compel heard by the circuit court.Â  CBS and Bristol did not submit briefs on appeal and were not parties to the circuit courtâ€™s orders.Â  Additionally, the record does not disclose the procedural position of either party at the time of this appeal.\r\n[4] Investors separately appealed the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Crescent.Â  See Court of Appeals Docket No. 14360, Bennett v. Investors (2).\r\n[5] For further edification, we note Appellants do not contend the loss here arose from a surveying error discoverable through the public records.Â  However, the parties do not dispute SCDOT recorded its right-of-way.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-550 (2006) (directing all rights-of-way for state highways be filed at SCDOT).Â  Furthermore, we recognize â€œ[t]he survey exception is aimed at excluding from coverage certain risks that can be ascertained by a physical inspection of the property.â€Â  G.W. Thompson, Thompson on Real Property Â§ 93.06(c) (2002) (emphasis added). Our Supreme Court, in Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724&nbsp;(2000), provided:\r\n\r\nAn appellate court may not, of course, reverse for any reason appearing in\r\nthe record. Â The losing party must first try to convince the lower court it has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the appellate court that the lower court erred. Â This principle underlies the long-established preservation requirement that the losing party generally must both present his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will review those issues and arguments.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  Accordingly, we refuse to apply a rule of law Appellants failed to point out to this court or the circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4153","title":"Bennett v.

Bennett, Richard K. Bennett, James M. Hendershot, and Robert N. Parker, III, (collectively Plaintiffs), for $2.85 million.Â  On January 4, 2002, Plaintiffs procured from Investors an ownerâ€™s title insurance policy (the Policy) covering the Property.Â Â  \r\nPlaintiffs developed the Property and built two brick walls at the entrance near Highway 188. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) notified Plaintiffs the walls had been built within SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way.Â  The right-of-way easement, dated August 1, 1968, and recorded at SCDOT, shows Crescent granted a 200 foot right-of-way for Highway 188 to SCDOT.[1]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-550 (2006) (directing all rights-of-way for state highways be filed at\r\nSCDOT).&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nAfter Plaintiffs notified Investors of a possible title insurance claim, Investors offered Plaintiffs $64,000 to settle the claim.Â  Plaintiffs accepted the $64,000 in settlement of its claim for actual damages, leaving a claim for consequential damages outstanding.Â  Having failed to fully settle the claim, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Investors on June 26, 2003, alleging breach of the title insurance contract and bad faith.Â  Investors answered the complaint and later filed an amended answer, adding a third-party complaint against Crescent, Bristol, and CBS.Â Â  \r\nIn its third-party complaint, Investors sought indemnity from Crescent, alleging it breached the special warranty clause in the Deed.Â  Moreover, Plaintiffs later amended their complaint to allege a breach of the Deedâ€™s warranty clause by Crescent and Bristol and negligence by CBS.Â  Crescent filed separate answers to Investorsâ€™ third-party complaint and Plaintiffsâ€™ amended complaint.Â Â Â Â  \r\nInvestors moved for summary judgment against Plaintiffs. Subsequently, Crescent moved for summary judgment against Investors and Plaintiffs.[2]Â  The circuit court granted Crescentâ€™s motion for summary judgment against both Plaintiffs and Investors, holding exceptions (5) and (6) in the habendum clause of the Deed limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court applied its ruling to Investors, finding Investors could not recover more than Plaintiffs.Â  \r\nInvestors moved to alter or amend this order.Â  The circuit court denied this motion but made minor factual corrections and entered an amended order.Â  The circuit court also granted summary judgment to Investors against Plaintiffs.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006); Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 219, 616 S.E.2d 722, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006); Eagle Container Co., LLCÂ  v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 620, 622 S.E.2d 733, 737 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go the jury. Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.E.2d 588, 595, 608 S.E.2d 587, 591 (Ct. App. 2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Law, 323 S.C. at 434, 629 S.E.2d at 648; BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 325, 608 S.E.2d 155, 159 (Ct.App.2005). On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below. Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 317, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct.App.2003) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005); Miller, 365 S.C. at 220, 616 S.E.2d at 729; Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004). Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct.App.2004). However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. Rife v. Hitachi Const. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 214, 609 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct. App. 2005); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 228, 612 S.E.2d 719, 722 (Ct. App. 2005). The moving party may discharge the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact by pointing out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partyâ€™s case. Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 349 S.E. 256, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002). Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings. Wogan v. Kunze, 366, S.C. 583, 591, 623, S.E.2d 107, 112 (Ct. App. 2005). The nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder. Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003); Eagle Container, 366 S.C. at 621, 622 S.E.2d at 738; Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 393, 593 S.E.2d 183, 186 (Ct.App.2004). Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues. Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 644, 594 S.E.2d 455, 462 (2004); Wogan, 366, S.C. at 592, 623, S.E.2d at 112; B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInvestors contends the circuit court erred in holding exceptions (5) and (6) in the habendum clause of the Deed limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty.Â  Investors argues: (1) the granting clause and its incorporation of the Plat created a representation or covenant of the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way; Â (2) exceptions (5) and (6) in the Deedâ€™s habendum â€œcuts downâ€ the fee simple estate conveyed in the granting clause, rendering the habendum Â repugnant to the granting clause; (3) the habendum and granting clause are inconsistent, making the Deed ambiguous; and (4) the Deedâ€™s special warranty automatically protects Bristol and subsequent purchasers against claims created by Crescent; otherwise, the Deed would be a quitclaim deed.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Construction of the Deed\r\nThe construction of a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of\r\nlaw for the court.Â  Hammond v. Lindsay, 277 S.C. 182, 184, 284 S.E.2d 581, 582&nbsp;(1981); Hunt v. Forestry Commâ€™n,&nbsp;358 S.C. 564, 568, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004); see also Vause v. Mikell, 290 S.C. 65, 68, 348 S.E.2d 187, 189&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986) (â€œThe construction of an unambiguous deed is a question of law, not fact.â€).Â  â€œ â€˜[I]t is the duty of the court to construe deeds and determine their legal effect, where there is no such ambiguity as requires parol proof and submission to the jury.â€™ â€Â  Hunt, 358 S.C. at 569, 595 S.E.2d at 848 (quoting 26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 168 (2001)).\r\nâ€œOne of the first canons of construction of a deed is that the intention of the grantor must be ascertained and effectuated if no settled rule of law is contravened.â€Â  S. Ry. Co. v. Smoak,&nbsp;243 S.C. 331, 336, 133 S.E.2d 806, 808&nbsp;(1963); Wayburn v. Smith, 270 S.C. 38, 41, 239 S.E.2d 890, 892&nbsp;(1977); Estate of Sherman, 359 S.C. at 413, 597 S.E.2d at 853; see also McDaniel v. Connor,&nbsp;206 S.C. 96, 100, 33 S.E.2d 75, 76&nbsp;(1945) (â€œAs has many times been said, the governing principle in the construction of deeds is that the intention of the grantor, if consistent with law, shall govern.â€).Â  Moreover, in ascertaining such intention the deed must be construed as a whole, and effect given to every part thereof, if such can be done consistently with law.Â  Wayburn, 270 S.C. at 42, 239 S.E.2d at 892; Bean v. Bean, 253 S.C. 340, 343, 170 S.E.2d 654, 655&nbsp;(1969); Alexander v. Burnet, 39 S.C.L. (5 Rich.) 189, 196 (1851); see also First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia v. Ford,&nbsp;177 S.C. 40, 46, 180 S.E. 562, 565&nbsp;(1935) (â€œLarger and more sensible rules of construction require that the whole deed should be considered together, and effect be given to every part, if all can stand together consistently with law . . . . â€).\r\nII. The Deedâ€™s Clauses\r\nInitially, we address the legal effect of the clauses in the Deed.Â  The term â€œpremisesâ€ is used to refer to â€œall that part of [a] deed preceding the habendum clause, containing generally the names or description of the parties; explanatory recitals, including consideration and its receipt; a description of the realty; the exception, if any; and sometimes a designation of the estate or interest conveyed.â€Â  26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 35 (2001); see also Artis v. Artis, 47 S.E.2d 228, 232&nbsp;(N.C. 1948) (â€œOrdinarily the premises and granting clauses designate the grantee and the thing granted, while the habendum clause relates to the quantum of the estate.â€).Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, the term â€œgranting clauseâ€ is used.Â  This court, in Hunt v. Forestry Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564, 566-67, 595 S.E.2d 846, 847&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004), referred to the following language in a deed as the â€œgranting clause:â€\r\n\r\nThe First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia . . . [has] granted, bargained, sold and released, and by these presents [does] grant, bargain, sell and release unto the said\r\n[SCFC] and their successors in office all that certain piece . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis removed); see also Estate of Sherman ex rel. Maddock v. Estate of Sherman ex rel. Snodgrass, 359 S.C. 407, 409, 597 S.E.2d 850, 850-51&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (referring to similar language in another deed as the â€œgranting clauseâ€).Â  The granting clause in Crescentâ€™s deed to Bristol incorporates an attached property description which, in turn, incorporates the Plat.Â Â  \r\nThe Latin phrase â€œhabendum et tenendumâ€ means â€œto have and to hold.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 716 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Thus, in Hunt, 358 S.C. at 567, 595 S.E.2d at 847, this court quoted the habendum clause in that deed:Â  â€œTo Have and to Hold all and singular the premises before mentioned unto the said [SCFC] and their successors in office, and assigns forever.â€Â  (emphasis removed); see also Smoak v. McClure,&nbsp;236 S.C. 548, 549, 115 S.E.2d 55, 55&nbsp;(1960) (â€œThe\r\nhabendum clause is regular in form, as follows:\r\nâ€˜To have and to hold, all and singular, the said premises before mentioned unto the said Ben Garris, and his Heirs and Assigns forever.â€™ â€).Â  \r\nThe habendum â€œis the clause usually following the granting part of the premises of a deed, which defines the extent of the ownership in the thing granted to be held and enjoyed by the grantee.â€ 26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 36 (2001).Â  Accordingly, in South Carolina, â€œthe estate conveyed by the deed must be determined from the whole deed including the\r\nhabendum clause.â€Â  Batesburg-Leesville Sch. Dist. No. 3 v. Tarrant, 293 S.C. 442, 445, 361 S.E.2d 343, 345&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â  Luculently, the habendum in the Deed is the section beginning â€œTO HAVE AND TO HOLD . . .â€ \r\nThe habendum in the Deed to Bristol is followed by Crescentâ€™s covenant to Bristol whereby Crescent â€œcovenants to warrant specially the title to the Property against the lawful claims of any person claiming from, through, or under it.â€Â  â€œThe doctrine of caveat emptor . . . has, in the absence of fraud and misrepresentation long governed the obligations of the parties in the sale of real estate in this State.â€ Rutledge v. Dodenhoff, 254 S.C. 407, 412, 175 S.E.2d 792, 794&nbsp;(1970).Â  In South Carolina, the purchaser of unimproved land must covenant to protect whatever special rights or interests he presumes to acquire in the land.Â  Jackson v. River Pines, Inc., 276 S.C. 29, 31, 274 S.E.2d 912, 913&nbsp;(1981); see also 21 C.J.S. Covenants Â§ 14 (1990) (â€œThe only protection of title afforded a purchaser of land is in the covenants contained in the deed.â€).Â  \r\nIn Martin v. Floyd, 282 S.C. 47, 51, 317 S.E.2d 133, 136 (Ct. App. 1984), this court explained:\r\n\r\nA South Carolina general warranty deed embraces all of the following five covenants usually inserted in fee simple conveyances by English conveyors: (1) that the seller is seized in fee; (2) that he has a right to convey; (3) that the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall quietly enjoy the land; (4) that the land is free from all encumbrances; and (5) for further assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\nA grantor seeking to include all of the common law covenants of title may use the language in section 27-7-10 of the South Carolina Code to carry out this effect. The statute reads:\r\n\r\nThe following form or purport of a release shall, to all intents and purposes, be valid and effectual to carry from one person to another or others the fee simple of any land or real estate if it shall be executed in the presence of and be subscribed by two or more credible witnesses:\r\n  \r\nThe State of South Carolina.\r\nKnow all men by these presents that I, A B, of __________, in the State aforesaid, in consideration of the sum of ___ dollars, to me in hand paid by C D of __________ County, State of __________, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, have granted, bargained, sold and released and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell and release unto the said C D all that (here describe the premises), together with all and singular the rights, members, hereditaments and appurtenances to said premises belonging or in any wise incident or appertaining; to have and to hold all and singular the premises before mentioned unto said C D, his heirs and assigns, forever. And I do hereby bind myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, to warrant and forever defend all and singular said premises unto said C D, his heirs and assigns, against myself and my heirs and against every person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same, or any part thereof.\r\nWitness my hand and seal this ___ day of __________ in the year of our Lord __________ and in the ___ year of the independence of the United States of America. __________ [L.S.]\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C.Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-10 (Supp. 2005); see 17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§ 32 (Supp. 2005).Â  However, section 27-7-10 does not preclude the grantor from using other warranty language in a deed. \r\n\r\nSection 27-7-10 shall be so construed as not to oblige any person to insert the clause of warranty or to restrain him from inserting any other clause in conveyances, as may be deemed proper and advisable by the purchaser and seller, or to invalidate the forms formerly in use within this State.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-20 (Supp. 2005).\r\nA â€œspecial warrantyâ€ is â€œ[a] warranty against any personâ€™s claim made by, through, or under the grantor or the grantorâ€™s heirs.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1581 (7th ed. 1999).Â  For example, the deed at issue in Knotts v. Joiner,&nbsp;217 S.C. 99, 102, 59 S.E.2d 850, 851&nbsp;(1950), â€œwas a printed form but the warranty clause was so stricken with pen as to change it from the usual general warranty to a special warranty, that is, against the heirs of the grantor only.â€Â  A quitclaim deed, on the other hand, does not convey the fee, but only the right, title, and interest of the grantor.Â  Martin v. Ragsdale,&nbsp;71 S.C. 67, 77, 50 S.E. 671, 674&nbsp;(1905).\r\nIII. Incorporation of the Plat\r\nInvestorsâ€™ initial argument that the incorporation of the Plat creates a representation or covenant of the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way completely ignores the habendum and warranty clauses.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nÂ â€œThe question as to the purpose and effect of a reference to a plat in a deed is ordinarily one as to the intention of the parties to be determined from the whole instrument and the circumstances surrounding its execution.â€Â  Lancaster v. Smithco, Inc., 246 S.C. 464, 468, 144 S.E.2d 209, 211&nbsp;(1965).Â  When a deed describes land as shown on a certain plat, such plat becomes part of the deed for the purpose of showing the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed.Â  Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 397, 252 S.E.2d 133, 136&nbsp;(1979); Carolina Land Co., Inc. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 105, 217 S.E.2d 16, 19&nbsp;(1975); see also Holly Hill Lumber Co. v. Grooms, 198 S.C. 118, 135, 16 S.E.2d 816, 823&nbsp;(1941) (â€œ â€˜As a general rule, when maps, plats, or field notes are referred to in a grant or conveyance they are to be regarded as incorporated into the instrument and are usually held to furnish the true description of the boundaries of the land . . . . â€™ â€).\r\nIn Blue Ridge Realty Co. v. Williamson, 247 S.C. 112, 118, 145 S.E.2d 922, 925&nbsp;(1965), our Supreme Court stated the general rule that when the owner of land has it subdivided and platted into lots and streets and sells and conveys lots with reference to the plat, he thereby dedicates said streets to the use of such lot owners, their successors in title and the public. See also Carolina Land Co., 265 S.C. at 105, 217 S.E.2d at 19.Â  Thus, the purchaser of lots with reference to the plat of the subdivision acquired every easement, privilege and advantage shown upon said plat, including the right to the use of all the streets, near or remote, as laid down on the plat by which the lots were purchased.Â  Blue Ridge, 247 S.C. at 119-20, 145 S.E.2d at 925; Carolina Land Co., 265 S.C. at 105, 217 S.E.2d at 19.\r\nIn Lancaster, 246 S.C. at 469, 144 S.E.2d at 211, â€œ[t]he only reference in the deed in th[e] case to the plat was in connection with the description of the lot.â€Â  Therefore, such reference to the recorded plat made it a part of the deed for the purpose of showing the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed. Id.Â  In that case, our Supreme Court edified:\r\n\r\nA plat, however, is not an index to encumbrances, and the mere reference in a deed, as in this case, to a plat for descriptive purposes does not incorporate a notation thereon as to an easement held by a third party so as to exclude such easement from the covenant against encumbrances in the absence of a clear intention that it so operate.\r\n\r\nId.Â  (emphasis added).\r\nBoth Blue Ridge and Lancaster looked to the intention of the parties in incorporating a plat to determine its effect.Â  In the present case, a reading of the Deed as a whole reveals the parties used the Plat as a reference to the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed.Â  Crescent put the burden of obtaining an accurate survey on Plaintiffs and excluded from its grant â€œmatters affecting title to the Property as shown on the Plat,â€ matters â€œwhich would be shown on a current and accurate survey of the Property,â€ and rights-of-way of public streets and roads.Â  Moreover, Investors does not dispute that â€œ[t]he actual dimensions and location of a highway right-of-way are things that will be revealed by a current and accurate survey of the property prepared by the surveyor.â€Â  Accordingly, we hold the intention of the parties in incorporating the Plat, when discerned from the Deed as a whole, was to show the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of the property conveyed, rather than represent or warranty the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way.\r\nIV. The Habendum\r\nInvestorsâ€™ second contention that the habendum of the Deed is repugnant to or inconsistent with its granting clause is without merit.Â  We recognize â€œwhen the estates given in the granting clause and the habendum of a deed are so repugnant to each other as not to be susceptible of any reasonable reconciliation, the granting clause will control and the habendum will be rejected as void.â€Â  Glasgow v. Glasgow,&nbsp;221 S.C. 322, 327, 70 S.E.2d 432, 434&nbsp;(1952).Â  When the granting clause in a deed purports to convey a fee simple absolute title, subsequent provisions of the deed cannot diminish that granted or deprive the grantee of the incidents of ownership in the property.Â  Shealy v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 278 S.C. 132, 135, 293 S.E.2d 306, 308&nbsp;(1982).Â  In Porter v. Ingram, 16 S.C.L. (Harp.) 492, 493-94 (1824), the Constitutional Court of Appeals of South Carolina held â€œwhen the premises are complete and perfect and the habendum is at variance with them, and they cannot stand together, the habendum is void.â€Â  See also Rhodes v. Black,&nbsp;170 S.C. 193, 202, 170 S.E. 158, 161&nbsp;(1933) (â€œWhere the habendum is repugnant to or irreconcilable with the grant, it will be rejected, and the grant will prevail.â€).\r\nInvestors essentially asserts SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way, an easement, reduces the fee simple grant by the total acreage of the easement.Â  This position directly contravenes established law in South Carolina.Â  In Douglas v. Med. Investors, Inc., 256 S.C. 440, 445, 182 S.E.2d 720, 722&nbsp;(1971), respondent contended the reservation of an easement in a deed was â€œrepugnant to the fee simple title granted and is, therefore, ineffective.â€Â  Our Supreme Court noted:\r\n\r\nâ€˜An easement is a right which one person has to use the land of another for a specific purpose.â€™ Steele v. Williams, 204 S.C. 124, 28 S.E.2d 644; and â€˜gives no title to the land on which the servitude is imposed,â€™ Morris v. Townsend, 253 S.C. 628, 172 S.E.2d 819. An easement is therefore not an estate in lands in the usual sense.â€™\r\n\r\nId.Â  Thus, the court held the easement in that case â€œin no way cut down the fee simple estate conveyedâ€ and, therefore, â€œthe reservation of the easement following\r\nthe description in the deed was not repugnant to the fee simple title conveyed in the granting clause.â€Â  Id. at 445-46, 182 S.E.2d at 722.Â  \r\nReading the Deed as a whole, the granting clause conveyed fee simple title in 47.82 acres of property to Bristol.Â  The habendum then defines â€œthe extent of the ownership in the thing granted to be held and enjoyed by the grantee.â€Â  26A C.J.S. Deeds Â§ 36 (2001).Â  In the instant case, the habendum is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the granting clause.Â  Therefore, we conclude the habendum is not void, and the Deed is not ambiguous.\r\nV. Limitation of Special Warranty\r\nInvestors maintains the special warranty clause in the Deed automatically provides protection against prior encumbrances created by Crescent.Â  To hold otherwise allegedly would render it a quitclaim deed.Â  A special warranty binds the grantor and the grantorâ€™s heirs.Â  See Knotts v. Joiner,&nbsp;217 S.C. 99, 102, 59 S.E.2d 850, 851 (1950).Â  However, â€œ[t]he grantor can, and often does, limit [covenants] so as to exclude existing encumbrances.â€Â  G.W. Thompson, Thompson on Real Property Â§ 82.10(c)(3) (Supp. 2005); see Â§ 27-7-20; see also Steele v. McRaney, 855 So. 2d 1114, 1122-23&nbsp;(Ala. Civ. App. 2003) (finding language grantee would take â€œsubject toâ€ matters a survey or inspection of the property would have uncovered prevented grantee from prevailing in breach of deed covenant claim); Kamenar R.R. Salvage, Inc. v. Ohio Edison Co., 607 N.E.2d 1108, 1113&nbsp;(Ohio Ct. App. 1992) (finding when a deed provides grantee would take subject to â€œthe state of facts which a personal inspection or accurate survey would disclose,â€ grantee has no claim against grantor for power line easement). \r\nHere, exceptions (5) and (6) in the habendum clause of the Deed limit Crescentâ€™s special warranty to Bristol.Â  Specifically, the exceptions put Bristol and subsequent purchasers on notice Crescent was not covenanting the Plat, matters which would be uncovered by a current and accurate survey, or public rights-of-way. In this respect, Crescent did not covenant the Property would be free from all encumbrances.Â  Instead, in keeping with section 27-7-20, Crescent limited its covenant to encumbrances not excepted through the habendum clause.Â  The circuit court did not err in finding exceptions (5) and (6) of the habendum clause limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Crescent did not represent or covenant the width of SCDOTâ€™s right-of-way by incorporating the Plat.Â  Moreover, the habendum clause in the Deed is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the grant.Â  Concomitantly, the habendum is not void, and the Deed is not ambiguous.Â  The circuit court correctly held exceptions (5) and (6) of the habendum limited Crescentâ€™s special warranty.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J. and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Crescent Resources, LLC conveyed the Property to Bristol.Â  The Deed indicates Crescent Resources, LLC is â€œa successor by merger and conversion to Crescent Resources, Inc., whose name was changed from Crescent Land and Timber Corp.â€Â  Crescent Land and Timber Corp. granted the easement to SCDOT.Â Â  \r\n[2] This motion is not included in the record.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4154","title":"McEachern v.

McEachern, of Port Royal, pro se Â Appellant.\r\nHarold W. Funderburk, Jr., of the South Carolina Employment Security Commission, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Michael J. McEachern appeals from a circuit court order affirming the denial of his claim for unemployment benefits by the South Carolina Employment Security Commission (the Commission).Â  We affirm, finding substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s ruling.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMcEachern began working in 1991 for the Roof Doctor, a business he formed that provides residential and commercial roofing services.[2]Â  McEachern, the president of the corporation, is responsible for providing job proposals and estimates.Â  He is the only person performing that function.Â  His wife, Marilyn Smith, serves as the office manager.Â  \r\nSince 1991, the Roof Doctor has maintained an average of about twelve employees.Â  When business slumped in 2002, the Roof Doctor laid off some employees, keeping a â€œskeleton crewâ€ of about five or six employees, including McEachern, and sold some equipment.Â  Because of the business downturn, McEachern eventually stopped taking a salary altogether.Â  According to Smith, McEachern drew a salary of only $3,367.68 during the second quarter of 2003, compared with more than $11,000.00 for the previous quarter.Â  Further, for the ten weeks immediately prior to the hearing in this matter, McEachern had not drawn a salary so the company could pay some of its outstanding financial obligations.Â  McEachern continued, however, to work at least sixty hours a week, preparing bids and seeking jobs for the company.Â  Business had been picking up, and the Roof Doctor expected to soon be able to resume paying McEachern a salary.Â  McEachern had no plans to close the business or to look for other employment.Â  Â Â \r\nIn June 2003, McEachern filed a claim for unemployment benefits while he continued to work for his company.Â  On June 17, 2003, the Commissionâ€™s Claims Adjudicator found McEachern did not meet the statutory eligibility requirement of being unemployed through no fault of his own because â€œas an officer of a corporation, [he had] control over [his] unemployment benefits.â€Â  McEachern was deemed ineligible for benefits as of June 1, 2003.Â  \r\nOn July 17, 2003, the Appeal Tribunal of the Commission upheld the Claims Adjudicatorâ€™s determination.Â  The Tribunal noted section 41-35-110 of the South Carolina Code provides a claimant must have unrestricted exposure to the labor market and be unemployed through no fault of his own.Â  The Tribunal stated:\r\n\r\nThe testimony reveals the claimant is a corporate official of an active business.Â  It is unfortunate that the business slowed and has not sufficiently increased in order to allow him to receive pay for his services.Â  However, since the claimant is not actively seeking other employment and is actively involved in the business, he does not meet the eligibility requirements of the law to receive benefits.Â  \r\n\r\nThe full Commission confirmed the decision of the Appeal Tribunal, noting McEachern â€œcontinues to work as much as sixty hours a week for the employer and expects his business to return to profitability.â€Â  The Commission found McEachern â€œis not unemployed since he continues to work in excess of the customary full-time hours for the employer.â€Â  Â Â \r\nMcEachern appealed the Commissionâ€™s ruling.Â  The circuit court affirmed, stating substantial evidence supported the Commissionâ€™s determination that McEachern did not meet the legal definition of â€œunemployed.â€Â  The court found the Commissionâ€™s decision was reasonable and not controlled by an error of law or an abuse of discretion.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Commission is an agency governed by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).[3]Â  Under the APA, a reviewing tribunal may reverse or modify the decision of the agency where it is arbitrary or capricious or constitutes an abuse of discretion.[4]Â  Reviewing courts apply the substantial evidence rule, under which the agencyâ€™s decision is upheld unless it is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€[5]Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached.â€[6]Â  â€œIt is more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but is something less than the weight of\r\nthe evidence.â€[7]Â  &nbsp;â€œFurthermore, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a court from concluding that substantial evidence supports an administrative agencyâ€™s finding.â€[8]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, McEachern argues the Commission erred in denying his claim for benefits.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 41-35-110 of the South Carolina Code governs the requirements for eligibility and provides as follows:\r\n\r\nAn unemployed insured worker shall be eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the Commission finds that:\r\n(1)Â  He has made a claim for benefits . . . .\r\n(2)Â  He has registered for work and thereafter has continued to report at an employment office in accordance with such regulations as the Commission may prescribe, except that the Commission may, by regulation, waive or alter either or both of the requirements of this paragraph as to individuals attached to regular jobs . . . .\r\n(3)Â  He is able to work and is available for work at his usual trade, occupation, or business or in such other trade, occupation, or business as his prior training or experience shows him to be fitted or qualified . . . .\r\n(4)Â  He has been unemployed for a waiting period of one week . . . .\r\n(5)Â  Claimant is separated, through no fault of his own, from his most recent bona fide employer . . . . \r\n(6)Â  He participates in reemployment services . . . .[9]\r\n\r\nA person is deemed â€œunemployed,â€ as used in this context, â€œin any week during which he performs no services and with respect to which no wages are payable to him or in any week of less than full-time work if the wages payable to him with respect to such week are less than his weekly benefit amount.â€[10]Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œThe burden is on a claimant to show compliance with benefit eligibility requirements.â€[11]Â  â€œThis includes a duty to show availability for work and a reasonable effort to obtain employment.â€[12]Â  â€œThe purpose of the availability requirement is to provide a test for determining whether a claimant is actually and currently attached to the labor market.â€[13]Â  \r\nMcEachern contends the Commission erred in finding him ineligible on the basis that he was not seeking other employment and, as an officer of the corporation, he was not in a position to be involuntarily unemployed. Â He notes under section 41-35-110(2) of the South Carolina Code, the Commission may, by regulation, waive the requirement that an individual register for work.Â  Citing Regulation 47-20(B)[14], McEachern argues the Commission should have characterized him as having â€œjob-attached unemployment.â€Â  McEachern states that, because he was job-attached, i.e., he had a regular job to which he could return, he was not required to seek alternative work and could continue working at his own company.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œJob-attached unemploymentâ€ is defined in Regulation 47-20(B) as â€œthe unemployment of any individual who, during any week, earns less than his weekly benefit amount, is employed by a regular employer, and works less than his normal customary full&#8209;time weekly hours because of a lack of full&#8209;time work.â€[15]Â  \r\nWe find there is substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s determination that McEachern was not unemployed because he continued to work in excess of customary full-time hours.Â  At the hearing in this matter, McEachern acknowledged he worked at least sixty hours per week - well in excess of a normal work week - performing essential services for the company in order to meet other expenses, including the salaries of the â€œskeleton crewâ€ he retained.Â  He admittedly was not seeking alternative employment because he expected his business to return to profitability in the near future.[16]Â  Thus, even applying the regulationâ€™s definition of â€œjob-attached unemployment,â€ as urged by McEachern, he was not â€œunemployedâ€ because he was not working fewer hours as required by the regulation.[17]Â  Â Â Â \r\nAlthough it is unfortunate that McEachernâ€™s business suffered a downturn, as the Commission notes in its brief, there is no provision that would allow it to subsidize individuals who choose to operate a business at a loss and continue to work while deferring a salary in order either to pay other employees or to meet other financial obligations.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe unemployment statutes and regulations, as currently written, are not designed to allow a corporate officer to elect to pay himself during profitable months, but then forego pay and receive unemployment benefits during less profitable months, as it would not be feasible for the Commission to sustain private businesses in this manner.[18]Â  \r\nBecause of our narrow scope of review, we must affirm the Commission if there is substantial evidence, which is less than the weight of the evidence, to support the Commissionâ€™s determination.Â  In this case, there is substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  Accordingly, the Commissionâ€™s ruling is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the Court in this appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The business began as a sole proprietorship; McEachern incorporated it several years later.Â  \r\n[3] Â Gibson v.

Types of Unemployment. \r\nA. â€œNon&#8209;Job&#8209;Attached Unemploymentâ€ means the unemployment of any individual in any week during which he performs no services and with respect to which no wages or wages totaling less than his weekly benefit amount are payable to him.Â  Claims for such benefits will be filed directly with the local Commission office by the individual and not an employer.Â  The claimant will register for work with the Commission office and seek full time employment while pursuing such claim for benefits. \r\nB.Â  â€œJob&#8209;Attached Unemploymentâ€ means the unemployment of any individual who, during any week, earns less than his weekly benefit amount, is employed by a regular employer, and works less than his normal customary full&#8209;time weekly hours because of a lack of full&#8209;time work.Â  Any claim for benefits made under this definition will be initiated by the employer and a continuing employer&#8209;employee relationship is understood.Â  In connection with any claim for benefits for job&#8209;attached unemployment, the claimant shall declare the amount of his earnings [from any source] for the seven day period for which he claims job&#8209;attached benefits. \r\n  \r\n\r\n[15]&nbsp; Id. 47-20(B) (emphasis added).\r\n[16]&nbsp; McEachern indicated his business is somewhat seasonal.Â  When talking about the fact that he previously employed nearly a dozen workers and sometimes â€œtwice that,â€ McEachern stated:Â  â€œItâ€™s kind of a seasonal business and we fully expect that it will return to that if we can ride this out.â€Â  \r\n[17]&nbsp; Cf. Rieth v. Admâ€™r, Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs., 539 N.E.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Ohio Ct. App. 1988) (holding a corporate president was unemployed after laying himself off following substantial business losses and that he was â€œavailable for workâ€ where he continued to work for his business only a few hours a week and actively contacted potential employers in search of alternative work).\r\n[18]&nbsp; See, e.g., Alexander v. Walnut Fork Design, 593 S.W.2d 493, 493-94 (Ark. Ct. App. 1980) (finding a corporate president and hourly wage earner was not unemployed within the meaning of the stateâ€™s unemployment security law and not eligible for benefits where he was laid off when the corporation ran out of work, but was expected to return to work with the same corporation within two months and was not seeking alternative employment); Child v. Bd. of Review of Indus. Commâ€™n, 332 P.2d 928, 929 (Utah 1958) (â€œA president of a corporation who is also manager, who has year-round responsibility to operate the business of the corporation and does so, cannot by purportedly laying himself off as manager in those periods when there may be no actual business activity, but when his corporate duties and management activity persist in the pursuit of future or continued business of the company, obtain unemployment benefits. Â He is much in the same position as a man working on a deferred commission payment basis who certainly cannot be said to be unemployed during the time the commission actually is not paid, but earned.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
