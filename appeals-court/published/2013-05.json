Section 401 of\r\nthe Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387 (2010), \"requires States to\r\nprovide a water quality certification [WQC] before a federal license or permit can\r\nbe issued for activities that may result in any discharge into intrastate navigable\r\nwaters.\" PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty. v. Wash. Dep't of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700,\r\n707 (1994); see 33 U.S.C. § 1341 (2010). States \"shall establish procedures for\r\npublic notice in the case of all applications for certification by it and, to the extent\r\nit deems appropriate, procedures for public hearings in connection with specific\r\napplications.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1). Further, section 401 of the CWA provides:\r\n\r\n             If the State . . . fails or refuses to act on a request for\r\n             certification, within a reasonable period of time (which\r\n             shall not exceed one year) after receipt of such request,\r\n             the certification requirements of this subsection shall be\r\n             waived with respect to such Federal application. No\r\n\r\n1 DHEC and the Conservation Groups will be collectively referred to as\r\nAppellants.\r\n\n            license or permit shall be granted until the certification\r\n            required by this section has been obtained or has been\r\n            waived as provided in the preceding sentence.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\n\"The Pollution Control Act [PCA] empowers DHEC to 'take all action necessary or\r\nappropriate to secure to this [s]tate the benefits of the Federal [CWA].'\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 48-1-50(17) (Rev. 2008). Section 48-1-30 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Rev. 2008) authorizes generally that DHEC shall promulgate regulations guiding\r\nthe procedures for permits under the PCA. Regulation 61-101was then\r\npromulgated pursuant to section 48-1-30 to establish procedures and policies for\r\nimplementing the WQC requirements of Section 401 of the CWA. S.C. Code Ann.\r\nRegs. 61-101 (Supp. 2011); S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nHealth and Envtl. Control, 390 S.C. 418, 430, 702 S.E.2d 246, 253 (2010).\r\n\r\nRegulation 61-101 requires that any applicant for a federal license or permit,\r\nincluding those issued by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to\r\nconduct any activity which during construction or operation may result in any\r\ndischarge in navigable waters, must obtain a water quality certification from\r\nDHEC. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101(A)(2). Further, it establishes a time frame\r\nfor review of the applications, stating\r\n\r\n            [DHEC] is required by Federal law to issue, deny, or\r\n            waive certification for Federal licenses or permits within\r\n            one (1) year of acceptance of a completed application\r\n            unless processing of the application is suspended. If the\r\n            Federal permitting or licensing agency suspends\r\n            processing of the application on request of the applicant\r\n            or [DHEC] or of its own volition, suspension of\r\n            processing of application for certification will also occur,\r\n            unless specified otherwise in writing by [DHEC]. Unless\r\n            otherwise suspended or specified in this regulation,\r\n            [DHEC] shall issue a proposed decision on all\r\n            applications within 180 days of acceptance or an\r\n            application.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101(A)(6). Review can begin when an applicant has\r\npresented DHEC with a complete application in the manner specified by\r\n\nRegulation 61-101. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101(C)(1). An application must\r\ncontain the names and addresses of adjacent property owners. S.C. Code Ann.\r\nRegs. 61-101(C)(1)(f).\r\n\r\n      Regulation 61-101(C)(2) states\r\n\r\n            [i]f [DHEC] does not request additional information\r\n            within ten (10) days of receipt of the application or joint\r\n            public notice, the application will be deemed complete\r\n            for processing; however, additional information may still\r\n            be requested of the applicant within sixty (60) days of\r\n            receipt of the application.\r\n\r\n      Moreover, Regulation 61-101(C)(4) provides\r\n\r\n            [w]hen [DHEC] requests additional information it will\r\n            specify a time for submittal of such information. If the\r\n            information is not timely submitted and is necessary for\r\n            reaching a certification decision, certification will be\r\n            denied without prejudice or processing will be suspended\r\n            upon notification to the applicant by [DHEC]. Any\r\n            subsequent resubmittal will be considered a new\r\n            application.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Fund Act (Fund Act), sections 48-2-10 to 48-2-90\r\nof the South Carolina Code (Rev. 2008 & Supp. 2011), was enacted for the\r\npurpose of creating a fund whose \"monies must be used for improved performance\r\nin permitting, certification, licensing, monitoring, investigating, enforcing, and\r\nadministering [DHEC's] functions.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 48-2-40 (Rev. 2008). The\r\nFund Act applies to the processing of all environmental permits, licenses,\r\ncertificates, and registrations authorized by the PCA, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking\r\nWater Act, Hazardous Waste Management Act, Atomic Energy Act, and the Oil\r\nand Gas Act. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-2-30(B) (Rev. 2008 & Supp. 2011). WQCs are\r\nalso covered by the Fund Act. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-2-50(H)(1)(b) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nThe Fund Act contains a provision entitled, \"Processing of permit application;\r\nmaximum time for review,\" which mandates that DHEC promulgate regulations\r\ngoverning the timeliness, thoroughness, and completeness of DHEC's processing\r\n\nof application subject to the Fund Act. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-2-70 (Rev. 2008).\r\nSection 48-2-70 states\r\n\r\n            [u]nder each program for which a permit processing fee\r\n            is established pursuant to this article, the promulgating\r\n            authority also shall establish by regulation a schedule for\r\n            timely action by [DHEC] on permit applications under\r\n            that program. These schedules shall contain criteria for\r\n            determining in a timely manner when an application is\r\n            complete and the maximum length of time necessary and\r\n            appropriate for a thorough and prompt review of each\r\n            category of permit applications and shall take into\r\n            account the nature and complexity of permit application\r\n            review required by the act under which the permit is\r\n            sought. If the department fails to grant or deny the\r\n            permit within the time frame established by regulation,\r\n            the department shall refund the permit processing fee to\r\n            the permit applicant.\r\n\r\n§ 48-2-70. DHEC promulgated the Environmental Protection Fees, S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Regs. 61-30 (2011), in accordance with the Fund Act. Its purpose and scope\r\nis described as follows:\r\n\r\n            This regulation prescribes those fees applicable to\r\n            applicants and holders of permits, licenses, certificates,\r\n            certifications, and registrations (hereinafter, \"permits\")\r\n            and establishes schedules for timely action on permit\r\n            applications. This regulation also establishes procedures\r\n            for the payment of fees, provides for the assessment of\r\n            penalties for nonpayment, and establishes an appeal\r\n            process to contest the calculation or applicability.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30(A). Regulation 61-30 also provides in pertinent part\r\nthat \"[a]pplication fees shall be due when the application is submitted. The\r\nDepartment will not process an application until the application fee is received.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30(C)(1)(b). Further, the regulation maintains that\r\n\r\n            [t]he schedule shall be tolled when the Department\r\n            makes a written request for additional information and\r\n\n             shall resume when the Department receives the requested\r\n             information from the applicant. If an applicant fails to\r\n             respond to such a request within 180 days, the\r\n             Department will consider the application withdrawn and\r\n             the application fee will be forfeited. The Department\r\n             shall notify the applicant no later than 10 days prior to\r\n             expiration of the 180-day period.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30(H)(1)(c).\r\n\r\nOn June 5, 2008, Duke filed an application with DHEC to obtain a WQC for a\r\nFERC license authorizing Duke's continued operation of the Catawba-Wateree\r\nHydroelectric Project in South Carolina. The application was submitted without\r\nthe required names and addresses of the adjacent property owners. Additionally,\r\nDuke did not provide the regulatory application fee.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2008, Duke supplied DHEC with several lists that contained the\r\nnames of interested citizens and stakeholders who had contacted Duke and\r\nrequested notification of matters regarding Duke's FERC application. However,\r\nthe lists still did not contain all the names and addresses of the adjacent property\r\nowners. On July 29, 2008, Duke provided DHEC with a list of the names and\r\naddresses of all the adjacent property owners. In response to Duke's fulfillment of\r\nthat requirement, DHEC notified Duke by email that it was placing Duke's\r\napplication on public notice. However, DHEC also specified it still required an\r\naffidavit of publication and the required application fee from Duke before its\r\nreview would commence and the 180 day clock would start. DHEC placed Duke's\r\napplication on public notice on August 8, 2008.\r\n\r\nDHEC also sent a letter to Duke dated August 19, 2008 (Letter 1), requesting\r\nadditional information regarding the draft Quality Assurance Program Plan\r\n(QAPP) that Duke had submitted with their application. Letter 1 further requested\r\nthat Duke submit the information to DHEC by October 19, 2008, and notified\r\nDuke that pursuant to Regulation 61-30, DHEC had 180 days to issue a decision\r\nonce the application was complete. Letter 1 also stated Duke's application would\r\nnot be complete for processing until the application fee and affidavit of publication\r\nrequested previously was received, and that \"the clock stops when information is\r\nrequested and [DHEC] is waiting on a response.\"\r\n\nDHEC received the affidavit and application fee on August 25, 2008. DHEC then\r\nsent two more letters to Duke requesting additional information needed to process\r\nDuke's application. One letter (Letter 2) was sent to Duke on October 8, 2008,\r\nrequesting the additional information by November 8, 2008. On November 10,\r\n2008, DHEC received the information requested in the October 8 letter. Another\r\nletter (Letter 3) was sent to Duke on October 21, 2008, requesting information to\r\nbe sent to DHEC by November 21, 2008. DHEC received a partial response on the\r\ndue date for the information. The remainder of the information was received by\r\nDHEC on December 12, 2008.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2009, DHEC issued its Notice of Department Decision (Notice),\r\ngranting Duke's WQC. The Conservation Groups appealed the Notice on May 15,\r\n2009, challenging DHEC's proposed WQC on the grounds that it would permit\r\nDuke to operate its project in violation of water quality standards. The South\r\nCarolina Board of Health and Environmental Concern (Board) granted the\r\nConservation Groups' request for a final review conference, which was held on\r\nJuly 9, 2009. On August 6, 2009, the Board issued a final agency decision,\r\noverturning DHEC's issuance of Duke's WQC.\r\n\r\nDuke appealed the Board's decision by filing a request for a contested case\r\nproceeding in the ALC on September 5, 2009. By an order dated November 9,\r\n2009, the ALC admitted the Conservation Groups and the South Carolina Attorney\r\nGeneral as respondent-intervenors.2 On January 21, 2010, Duke filed two motions\r\nwith the ALC, one for summary judgment and the second for declaratory\r\njudgment. Duke based its argument for summary judgment on two grounds: (1)\r\npursuant to regulation 61-101(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011),\r\nDHEC was required to issue a proposed decision on Duke's application for a WQC\r\nwithin 180 days of receiving the application on June 5, 2008, and (2) by operation\r\nof law, the State waived its right to issue certification when DHEC failed to either\r\nissue or deny the WQC on or before December 2, 2008.\r\n\r\nDHEC filed a response on February 12, 2010 in which it argued for denial of\r\nDuke's motions. A hearing was held on May 6, 2010, and on June 10, 2010, the\r\nALC granted Duke's motion for summary judgment, but failed to rule on Duke's\r\n\r\n2 The ALC limited the participation of the South Carolina Attorney General to\r\nissues impacting the State's law suit against the State of North Carolina seeking a\r\nruling from the United States Supreme Court on the proper apportionment of water\r\nfrom the Catawba River.\r\n\nmotion for declaratory judgment. DHEC and the Conservation Groups filed a joint\r\nmotion for reconsideration, which the ALC denied. Both DHEC and the\r\nConservation Groups filed timely appeals from the ALC's decision to grant\r\nsummary judgment to Duke and its denial of their joint motion for reconsideration,\r\nwhich this court has consolidated under this caption.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"Appeals from the ALC are governed by the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA).\" MRI at Belfair, LLC v.

South Carolina Department of\r\n\nHealth and Environmental Control and Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, 371 S.C. 547,\r\n641 S.E.2d 425 (2007) applied to the instant case. Responsible Economic held that\r\nregulations from different enabling acts could not be applied to each other when\r\nthe regulations did not reference each other and there is an absence of statutory\r\nauthorization to apply the two acts and their corresponding regulations to each\r\nother. We agree with the Conservation Groups' contention that the present case is\r\ndistinguishable from Responsible.\r\n\r\nSection 48-2-70, under which Regulation 61-30 is promulgated, explicitly states\r\nDHEC must establish by regulation a schedule for timely action on permit\r\napplications for a WQC. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-2-70 (Rev. 2008). It further states\r\nthe schedule must have criteria for determining in a timely manner when an\r\napplication is complete along with the maximum length of time necessary and\r\nappropriate for a thorough and prompt review required by the act under which the\r\npermit is sought. Id. The statute's plain language indicates the time schedule\r\nprovided in Regulation 61-30, as well as any corresponding explanation of how to\r\ncount the days in that time schedule, would be applicable to any previous\r\nregulation under which the permit is authorized.\r\n\r\nRegulation 61-30 \"prescribes those fees applicable to applicants and holders of\r\npermits, licenses, certificates, certifications, and registrations (hereinafter,\r\n\"permits\") and establishes schedules for timely action on permit applications.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30(A) (emphasis added). The regulation defines \"time\r\nschedule\" as follows:\r\n\r\n            In accordance with S.C. Code Sections 48-2-70 and 48-\r\n            39-150, a \"schedule of timely review\" for purposes of\r\n            this regulation shall begin when the applicant is notified\r\n            that the application is administratively complete or within\r\n            ten days of receipt of the application, whichever comes\r\n            first; and end when a final decision is rendered. It will\r\n            include required technical review, required public notice,\r\n            and end with a final decision by the Department to issue\r\n            or deny the permit. The time schedule may be tolled or\r\n            extended in accordance with the conditions stipulated in\r\n            Section H(1) of this regulation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30(B)(22) (emphasis added). Section H(2)(a)(vii) lists\r\nthe time schedules for environmental permits for water pollution control and\r\n\nallows 180 days for a WQC permit to be processed; this time schedule mirrors\r\nRegulation 61-101's time schedule for permit review. Regulation 61-30 also states\r\nan application is not to be processed until the required processing fee is received.\r\nDuke argues that the 61-30 solely governs the time schedule by which a fee must\r\nbe returned due to untimely action, and has no bearing upon the time schedule of\r\nthe actual substantive decision of whether a permit will be granted. We have\r\ndifficulty understanding how the processing of a permit hinges upon receipt of the\r\nfee, but then once that fee is received, there is a separate time schedule applied to\r\neach. There are multiple references to the substantive permit review process in\r\nRegulation 61-30, and many portions of Regulation 61-30's requirements and\r\nprocedures regarding the application procedure mirror the requirements in\r\nRegulation 61-101. Reading the statutory mandates and regulatory requirements in\r\ntheir plain and ordinary sense indicates that Regulation 61-30 and 61-101 were to\r\nbe read together to provide DHEC more flexibility in the processing of permits.3\r\nBoth of the regulations can exist without one negating the other, as Regulation 61-\r\n30 clarifies how Regulation 61-101's 180-day time period of review will be\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\nSection H(1) of Regulation 61-30 sets the procedure for counting the days in a\r\ngiven time schedule, and allows for tolling as well as suspension of the time\r\nschedule. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30(H)(1)(c)-(d). Because we find Regulation\r\n61-101 and Regulation 61-30 are applicable to each other, we believe that the\r\ntolling provisions of 61-30 are also applicable to Regulation 61-101. Additionally,\r\nDHEC explained its interpretation of the time schedule to Duke Energy in their\r\nletter dated October 19, 2008, as well as in other documents. It cited Regulation\r\n61-30, and stated that while DHEC had 180 days to complete its action on the\r\napplication, only the days on which DHEC was actively reviewing the application\r\nwould be counted. DHEC maintained the clock stopped when information was\r\nrequested and DHEC was awaiting a response. These documents reflect DHEC's\r\nunderstanding of its own regulations, and Duke Energy was made fully aware of\r\nthat understanding. Further, we believe DHEC's interpretation complies with the\r\nregulations' plain language.\r\n\r\n3 We are not encouraging untimely action by state agencies. Further, we make no\r\ndeterminations in the present case as to the reasonableness of DHEC's requests for\r\ninformation, as that is not an issue on appeal. Simply put, we believe that these\r\nregulations recognize the need for some flexibility in making these complex\r\npermitting decisions, such as under these facts, where the applicant is untimely\r\nwith their responses to DHEC's requests.\r\n\nWe find the language of section 48-2-70 provides that the regulations promulgated\r\nunder its authority are to enhance DHEC's review process for any permits which\r\nrequire a processing fee, including a WQC. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-2-70 (Rev.\r\n2008). Accordingly, we hold the ALC erred in finding, as a matter of law, that\r\nRegulation 61-30 had no application to Regulation 61-101. Thus, we reverse the\r\nALC.\r\n\r\nEstoppel\r\n\r\nThe Conservation Groups argue that because Duke had full knowledge that DHEC\r\nwas operating by the full time period provided by reading Regulation 61-101 and\r\nRegulation 61-30 in conjunction, Duke is now estopped from maintaining that\r\nRegulation 61-30 is not applicable to Regulation 61-101. We decline to make a\r\nruling on this issue, as it is moot in light of our above holding. See Byrd v. Irmo\r\nHigh Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (noting an issue\r\nbecomes moot when a decision, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect\r\nupon the existing controversy).\r\n\r\nWaiver of Water Quality Certification\r\n\r\nBecause we reverse and remand the ALC's grant of summary judgment based upon\r\nour finding that Regulation 61-30 does apply to Regulation 61-101, it is\r\nunnecessary for us to determine DHEC's arguments and additional sustaining\r\ngrounds regarding waiver. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that if an appellate court's\r\nruling on a particular issue is dispositive of an appeal, rulings on remaining issues\r\nare unnecessary).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand the ALC's decision to grant\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the order of the\r\nALC.\r\n\r\nAs the majority has stated, Regulation 61-101 was promulgated pursuant to the\r\nSouth Carolina Pollution Control Act, S.C. Code Ann. §§ 48-1-10 through -350.\r\n(2008 and Supp. 2012). This regulation, which is entitled \"Water Quality\r\nCertification,\" \"establishes procedures and policies for implementing State water\r\nquality certification requirements of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.\r\nSection 1341.\" 8A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101.A.1 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\nParagraph A.6 of Regulation 61-101 references the requirement in the Clean Water\r\nAct quoted by the majority that a State must act on a request for water quality\r\ncertification within a reasonable period of time. Under the Federal Clean Water\r\nAct, this period is not to exceed one year after receipt of a certification request\r\nunless processing of the application is suspended. If the deadline is not met, \"the\r\ncertification requirements of this subsection shall be waived with respect to such\r\nFederal application.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1) (2006). Regulation 61-101.A.6\r\nreferences the one-year deadline in the Clean Water Act for a state to act on a\r\nrequest for water quality certification, but imposes a shorter time limit of one\r\nhundred eighty days for DHEC to act on such a request. This regulation further\r\nprovides that \"[u]nless otherwise suspended or specified in this regulation,\r\n[DHEC] shall issue a proposed decision on all applications within 180 days of\r\nacceptance or [sic] an application.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which Regulation 61-101 allows DHEC to suspend\r\nprocessing of application for water quality certification or to delay a decision past\r\none hundred eighty days after it is received by DHEC are explained in paragraphs\r\n2 through 4 of subsection C of the regulation.4 Under paragraph 2, DHEC may\r\nrequest additional information within sixty days after receiving an application even\r\nif the application has already been deemed complete for processing. Paragraph 3\r\nspecifies the type of information that DHEC can request, such as water quality\r\nmonitoring data, water quality modeling results, or other environmental\r\nassessments. Central to this appeal is paragraph 4, which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n4Regulation 61-101.A.6 also provides that the suspension of the application\r\nprocess can occur \"if the Federal permitting or licensing agency suspends\r\nprocessing of the application on request by the applicant or [DHEC] of its own\r\nvolition\"; however, none of these circumstances are present here.\r\n\n            When [DHEC] requests additional information it will\r\n            specify a time for submittal of such information. If the\r\n            information is not timely submitted and is necessary for\r\n            reaching a certification decision, certification will be\r\n            denied without prejudice or processing will be suspended\r\n            upon notification to the applicant by [DHEC]. Any\r\n            subsequent resubmittal will be considered a new\r\n            application.\r\n\r\n8A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101.C.4 (2012) (emphasis added). Under Regulation\r\n61-101.C.4, the processing of an application for water quality certification is\r\nsuspended only after the applicant has failed to meet the given deadline for\r\nsubmitting additional requested information and DHEC has notified the applicant\r\nabout the suspension. Significantly, Regulation 61-101 does not authorize DHEC\r\nto suspend processing during the interval between the time it requests more\r\ninformation and the deadline that it gives the applicant when it makes the request.\r\n\r\nOn August 19, 2008, DHEC sent a letter to Duke requesting additional information\r\nabout the draft Quality Assurance Program Plan that Duke submitted with its\r\napplication. In the letter, DHEC instructed Duke to submit the information by\r\nOctober 19, 2008. DHEC sent two more letters requesting more information, one\r\non October 8, 2008, with a deadline of November 8, 2008, and another on October\r\n21, 2008, with a deadline of November 21, 2008. The ALC found that these\r\nrequests were ineffective to suspend the processing of Duke's application. I agree\r\nwith this finding. Even assuming the information that DHEC requested was both\r\nnecessary to process Duke's application and not provided by the stated deadlines,\r\nDHEC never, as required by Regulation 61-101.C.4, provided Duke with a notice\r\nof suspension after any of the specified due dates. Moreover, as I have explained\r\nin the preceding paragraph, DHEC was not authorized under Regulation 61-101 to\r\nsuspend its processing of Duke's application during the interval between the date of\r\nits request and the date by which Duke was to produce the required information.\r\n\r\nThe majority quotes Regulation 61-101.C.4 and does not appear to question its\r\nrelevance to the processing of applications for water quality certification.\r\nHowever, instead of applying the unambiguous provisions of this paragraph to\r\ndetermine when the processing of an application is suspended, it looks to\r\nRegulation 61-30, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n             The time schedule shall be tolled when [DHEC] makes a\r\n             written request for additional information and shall\r\n             resume when [DHEC] receives the requested information\r\n             from the applicant. If an applicant fails to respond to\r\n             such a request within 180 days, [DHEC] will consider the\r\n             application withdrawn and the application fee will be\r\n             forfeited. [DHEC] shall notify the applicant no later than\r\n             10 days prior to expiration of the 180-day period.\r\n\r\n4 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-30.H.1.c (2011). The tolling provisions in this\r\nregulation are inconsistent with those in Regulation 61-101.C.4. Under Regulation\r\n61-101.C.4, the processing of an application continues after DHEC requests\r\nadditional information from an applicant. The processing is suspended only when\r\nthe applicant misses the deadline to comply with the request and DHEC informs\r\nthe applicant that a suspension is to take place. In contrast, under Regulation 61-\r\n30.H.1.c, the time schedule to process an application is tolled at the time DHEC\r\nmakes a written request for more information and remains tolled until the applicant\r\nsatisfies the request. Furthermore, Regulation 61-30.H.1.c does not require DHEC\r\nto impose any deadline on such a request. DHEC itself has acknowledged these\r\ntwo regulations are inconsistent with each other with regard to the method of\r\ndetermining whether it has acted timely on an application.\r\n\r\nThe ALC held that the issue of whether the processing of Duke's application had\r\nbeen suspended should be analyzed under Regulation 61-101.C.4 and DHEC could\r\nnot invoke Regulation 61-30.H.1.c to support its claim that it issued a timely\r\ndecision. I would affirm these holdings. First, although both regulations purport\r\nto address the issue of when DHEC can suspend processing of an application for\r\nwater quality certification, Regulation 61-101 specifically covers water quality\r\ncertification and was expressly promulgated to fulfill requirements of the Federal\r\nClean Water Act. These requirements include prompt action by state agencies on\r\nrequests for water quality certification, an objective important enough to warrant a\r\nlegislative mandate in the Clean Water Act that unreasonable delay by a state\r\nagency in acting on such a request for water quality certification would be\r\ntantamount to a waiver by the State of its right to deny certification, which in turn\r\nwould delay the applicant's pursuit of any federal license or permit for which state\r\nwater quality certification is a prerequisite. See South Carolina Coastal\r\nConservation League v. South Carolina Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 390 S.C.\r\n418, 430, 702 S.E.2d 246, 253 (2010) (stating Regulation 61-101 \"establishes\r\nprocedures and policies for implementing water quality certification requirements\r\n\nof Section 401 of the Clean Water Act\"). In contrast, Regulation 61-30, which is\r\nentitled \"Environmental Protection Fees,\" covers permitting decisions for all\r\nenvironmental programs administered by DHEC pursuant to federal and state law\r\nand regulation. Although Regulation 61-30 \"establishes schedules for timely\r\naction on permit applications,\" the issue of timeliness is presented in the context of\r\ndetermining when an application fee is deemed to be forfeited by the applicant.\r\nNowhere does Regulation 61-30 reference the Clean Water Act.\r\n\r\nDHEC has argued in its brief, that Regulation 61-30.H.1.c controls here because it\r\nwas enacted later than Regulation 61-101.C.4 and has been amended as late as\r\n2004. Although its provisions apply to requests for water quality certification,\r\nRegulation 61-30, does not further the mandates of the Clean Water Act or the\r\npolicy favoring prompt action by the states on requests for water quality\r\ncertification. Therefore, I would hold that the ALC correctly followed Regulation\r\n61-101.C.4 in concluding that DHEC waived its right to deny certification to Duke.\r\nCf. City of Rock Hill v. South Carolina Dep't of Health & Envt'l Control, 302 S.C.\r\n161, 167-68, 394 S.E.2d 327, 331 (1990) (\"[T]he general rule is that statutes of a\r\nspecific nature . . . are not to be considered as repealed in whole or in part by later\r\ngeneral statutes . . . , unless there is a direct reference to the former statute or the\r\nintent of the legislature to repeal is explicitly implied therein.\").\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as Duke has noted, DHEC issued requests for information on October\r\n8, 2008, and November 8, 2008, while it was awaiting information it requested on\r\nAugust 19, 2008. DHEC's own actions, then, show it did not suspend the\r\nprocessing of Duke's application according to Regulation 61-30.H.1.c; rather, it\r\ncontinued to review it actively after it requested supplemental information.\r\n\r\nI would further reject Appellants' arguments that the doctrines of estoppel and\r\nwaiver preclude Duke from raising the issue of timeliness of DHEC's action on its\r\napplication. DHEC, as the party claiming estoppel, must prove not only reliance\r\non Duke's conduct, but also that \"lack of knowledge and of the means of\r\n[obtaining] knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question.\" Ingram v. Kasey's\r\nAssocs., 340 S.C. 98, 107 n.2, 531 S.E.2d 287, 292 n.2 (2000). Here, DHEC\r\ncannot reasonably claim it lacked knowledge and the means of obtaining\r\nknowledge about its own regulations.\r\n\r\nAs to Appellants' contention that Duke could not raise the issue of timeliness\r\nduring proceedings before the ALC because it did not raise this issue to the DHEC\r\nstaff or board, I note the appealed order resulted from a contested case hearing, not\r\n\na judicial review proceeding. The governing statute does not limit the parties to\r\nasserting only those issues that had been litigated before the administrative agency.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 44-1-60(G) (Supp. 2012) (setting forth procedures for\r\ncontested case proceedings).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would hold that DHEC's processing of Duke's\r\napplication for water quality certification was never suspended pursuant to\r\nRegulation 61-101.C.4. When DHEC issued its staff decision on May 15, 2009, it\r\nhad already waived its right to act on the requirement for the state water quality\r\ncertification that Duke would otherwise have been required to satisfy in order to\r\nobtain a FERC license to continue operating the Catawba-Wateree Hydroelectric\r\nProject. I would therefore affirm the ALC's decision.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5120","title":"Castine v.

We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nFrances and David were previously related by marriage, as father-in-law and\r\ndaughter-in-law. When Frances's husband passed away in 2007, the estate\r\nsettlement caused tension between Frances and David.\r\n\r\nFrances eventually obtained employment with Lexington County (the County) and\r\nhas held her position for over three years. After discovering she had been hired by\r\nthe County, David contacted several members of the Lexington County Council\r\nregarding the County's hiring practices. He stated he was concerned about\r\nFrances's employment with the County because she had a criminal record, was\r\nfired from the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (SCDMV) for\r\nmisconduct, and was a known user of illegal drugs. David was directed by a\r\nCounty councilman to contact the County's human resources manager about the\r\nissue. After contacting the human resources manager, David was told to put the\r\nconcerns in writing and that the matter would be handled confidentially.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 2009, David wrote his concerns were\r\n\r\n            1. [Frances] has a criminal record of several arrests or\r\n            citations for fraudulent checks. As recent as 2007, she\r\n            was arrested on a bench warrant for fraudulent checks.\r\n            She also has been arrested for criminal domestic violence\r\n            twice.\r\n\r\n            2. [Frances] was terminated from her previous employer,\r\n            SC Department of Motor Vehicles for several reasons.\r\n            She used a State credit card for her personal use. She\r\n            would go into the department database and obtain\r\n            personal information of people she did not like and use\r\n            this information to harm these people. Because of her\r\n            actions she caused a long time state employee to lose her\r\n            position as well. A SLED investigation was conducted\r\n            into her actions and found wrongdoing causing her\r\n            termination.\r\n\r\nHe also stated Frances was \"a well-known drug user and has been for over 25\r\nyears. . . . These drugs include marijuana and cocaine.\" David sent a second letter\r\nto Katherine Hubbard, the County administrator on October 23, 2009. In that\r\nletter, he requested to have questions answered, including:\r\n\n             How can a person have a criminal record of writing\r\n             fraudulent checks to Lexington County businesses for\r\n             over twenty years get a job with the county?\r\n\r\n             How can a person that was terminated from a state\r\n             agency after a state agency investigation and a SLED\r\n             investigation were performed and found a person\r\n             violating agency policies get hired by the county?\r\n\r\n             How can the Department of Human Resources and the\r\n             Department of Public Safety ignore these facts when they\r\n             were informed of them over six months ago?\r\n\r\nIn his deposition, David agreed with Frances's counsel that the intent behind his\r\nactions was to hurt Frances and have her fired. However, he later attempted to\r\nclarify his intent by testifying \"every citizen has a right to protect the people that\r\nwork for [the County].\"\r\n\r\nIn a complaint filed in May 2009, Frances asserted causes of action for\r\ndefamation/slander, negligence/recklessness, intentional interference with\r\ncontractual rights, and a preliminary and permanent injunction. In his answer,\r\nDavid admitted he provided information to the County at its request but asserted\r\nthat the information was true and privileged. Prior to trial, Frances filed a motion\r\nfor summary judgment on the issue of liability. During a hearing before the circuit\r\ncourt, David put forth two defenses to preclude summary judgment on his\r\ndefamation charge. First, he asserted an absolute defense of truth. Second, he\r\nasserted a defense of privilege, either qualified or absolute.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court determined Frances was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\r\non the issue of defamation and the matter should proceed to trial on the issue of\r\ndamages. The court found David's statements were defamatory per se. The circuit\r\ncourt also found David made the statements with the express intent of harming\r\nFrances; therefore, malice existed as a matter of law. Additionally, the circuit\r\ncourt determined there was no qualified privilege, noting there \"is no constitutional\r\nright on the part of one citizen to [maliciously] impugn the reputation of another.\"\r\nThe court subsequently denied David's Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the\r\nsame standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; summary\r\njudgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\r\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C.\r\n488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In determining whether a genuine issue of\r\nfact exists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\nAuth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003). \"Once the moving\r\nparty carries its initial burden, the opposing party must come forward with specific\r\nfacts that show there is a genuine issue of fact remaining for trial.\" Sides v.\r\nGreenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 250, 255, 607 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe tort of defamation allows plaintiffs to recover for injuries to their reputation as\r\nthe result of defendants' communications to others of a falsity regarding the\r\nplaintiffs. Boone v. Sunbelt Newspapers, Inc., 347 S.C. 571, 580, 556 S.E.2d 732,\r\n737 (Ct. App. 2001). Defamation does not focus on the hurt to the defamed\r\nparties' feelings, but on the injury to their reputations. Murray v. Holnam, Inc.,\r\n344 S.C. 129, 138, 542 S.E.2d 743, 748 (Ct. App. 2001). \"In order to prove\r\ndefamation, the plaintiff must show (1) a false and defamatory statement was\r\nmade; (2) the unprivileged publication was made to a third party; (3) the publisher\r\nwas at fault; and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special\r\nharm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.\" Erickson v.\r\nJones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 465, 629 S.E.2d 653, 664 (2006). \"A\r\ncommunication is defamatory if it tends to impeach the honesty, integrity, virtue,\r\nor reputation . . . .\" Hubbard and Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 462 (2d.\r\ned. 1997).\r\n\r\nI.    Truth\r\n\r\nDavid argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because\r\nevidence was presented that the statements he made to the County were true. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nRelying on Ross v. Columbia Newspapers, Inc., 266 S.C. 75, 221 S.E.2d 770\r\n(1976), David maintains the defense of truth does not require proof that the\r\nstatements were completely true, but only that the statements were substantially\r\n\ntrue. In Ross, the supreme court held, in the context of a newspaper article, that (1)\r\n\"both the headline and the article following it must be considered as one document\r\nin determining whether it is defamatory,\" and (2) \"a sufficient defense is made out\r\nwhere the evidence establishes that the statement was substantially true.\" 266 S.C.\r\nat 80-81, 221 S.E.2d at 772-73. Here, although the first holding in Ross is not\r\napplicable because the present case does not involve a newspaper article, the\r\nsecond holding still applies.\r\n\r\nIn this case, David admitted that at least one statement he made, the accusation of\r\nimproper credit card use, was not true. On appeal, David contends that because\r\nmost of the statements he made are true, then both letters he sent to the County are\r\nsubstantially true. We find David is not entitled to the truth defense, as a matter of\r\nlaw, because he admitted the statement he made about Frances's improper credit\r\ncard use was false. Substantial truth must be proven as to each individual\r\nstatement David made, not as to the contents of the letters he sent as a whole. In\r\nthat respect, we find Ross distinguishable from this case. Accordingly, we affirm\r\nthe circuit court's ruling as to the falsity of David's statement regarding Frances's\r\ncredit card use because there is no evidence that statement is true. Whether the\r\nother statements were false is a matter for the jury.\r\n\r\nII.   Privilege\r\n\r\nDavid argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because the\r\nstatements he made to the County were privileged. We disagree.\r\n\r\nDavid contends that as a taxpayer and citizen of the County, the statements he\r\nmade to County officials about the suitability of Frances for employment as a\r\ncounty employee are privileged. \"In a defamation action, the defendant may assert\r\nthe affirmative defense of conditional or qualified privilege.\" Swinton Creek\r\nNursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 484, 514 S.E.2d 126, 134\r\n(1999). \"Under this defense, one who publishes defamatory matter concerning\r\nanother is not liable for the publication if (1) the matter is published upon an\r\noccasion that makes it conditionally privileged, and (2) the privilege is not\r\nabused.\" Id. (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 593 (1977); see Bell v. Bank\r\nof Abbeville, 208 S.C. 490, 38 S.E.2d 641 (1946)). In Bell, our supreme court held:\r\n\r\n             In determining whether or not the communication was\r\n             qualifiedly privileged, regard must be had to the occasion\r\n             and to the relationship of the parties. When one has an\r\n             interest in the subject matter of a communication, and the\r\n\n             person (or persons) to whom it is made has a\r\n             corresponding interest, every communication honestly\r\n             made, in order to protect such common interest, is\r\n             privileged by reason of the occasion. The statement,\r\n             however, must be such as the occasion warrants, and\r\n             must be made in good faith to protect the interests of the\r\n             one who makes it and the persons to whom it is\r\n             addressed.\r\n\r\nBell, 208 S.C. at 493-94, 38 S.E.2d at 643.\r\n\r\n\"In general, the question whether an occasion gives rise to a qualified or\r\nconditional privilege is one of law for the court.\" Id. Here, in light of David's\r\nadmission of his intent to harm Frances and get her fired, we find the circuit court\r\ndid not err in finding privilege did not exist. Because privilege is not applicable to\r\nthe specific facts of this case, we affirm the circuit court.\r\n\r\nIII.   Malice\r\n\r\nDavid argues the circuit court erred in finding he acted with malice as a matter of\r\nlaw. We disagree.\r\n\r\nUnder the common law, a defamatory statement may be actionable per se, in which\r\ncase the court presumes a defendant acted with common law malice1 and the\r\nplaintiff suffered general damages. Erickson, 368 S.C. at 465, 629 S.E.2d at 664.\r\nCommon law malice is a presumption of law and \"dispenses with the proof of\r\nmalice when words which raise such presumption are shown to have been uttered.\"\r\nMurray, 344 S.C. at 143, 542 S.E.2d at 750 (quoting Jones v. Garner, 250 S.C.\r\n479, 488, 158 S.E.2d 909, 914-15 (1968)). Moreover, common law malice is a\r\nform of malice that is \"not necessarily inconsistent with an honest or even laudable\r\npurpose and does not imply ill will, personal malice, hatred, or a purpose to\r\ninjure.\" Jones, 250 S.C. at 488, 158 S.E.2d at 914. Thus, the presumption of\r\ncommon law malice does not mean the defendant's conduct evidenced common\r\nlaw actual malice, which is defined as acting with \"ill will toward the plaintiff,\" or\r\n\r\n1\"Common law malice\" is also called \"legal malice,\" \"malice in law,\" \"presumed\r\nmalice, or \"implied malice.\" Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C.\r\n502, 510, n.3, 506 S.E.2d 497, 501-502, n.3 (1998); Jones, 250 S.C. at 488, 158\r\nS.E.2d at 914-15.\r\n\nacting \"with conscious indifference of the plaintiff's rights.\" Erickson, 368 S.C. at\r\n466, 629 S.E.2d at 665.\r\n\r\nSlander is actionable per se \"only when it charges the plaintiff with one of five\r\ntypes of acts or characteristics: (1) commission of a crime of moral turpitude; (2)\r\ncontraction of a loathsome disease; (3) adultery; (4) unchastity; or (5) unfitness in\r\none's business or profession.\" Erickson, 368 S.C at 465-66 n.7, 629 S.E.2d at 664\r\nn.7. However, \"[l]ibel is actionable per se if it involves written or printed words\r\nwhich tend to degrade a person, that is, to reduce his character or reputation in the\r\nestimation of his friends or acquaintances, or the public, or to disgrace him, or to\r\nrender him odious, contemptible, or ridiculous.\" Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 510-11,\r\n506 S.E.2d at 502 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nDavid's statements to the County are actionable per se. Thus, the law presumes\r\nDavid acted with common law malice. This presumption does not imply that\r\nDavid acted with common law actual malice, thus he may not rebut this\r\npresumption by showing his conduct evidenced a lack of ill will, personal malice,\r\nhatred, or a purpose to injure. Under South Carolina law, David may rebut the\r\npresumption of common law malice only by showing the statement was privileged.\r\nSee Swinton Creek Nursery, 334 S.C. at 485, 514 S.E.2d at 134 (stating because\r\nmalice was presumed, it was defendant's burden to establish that a privilege existed\r\nin order to rebut this presumption); Murray, 344 S.C. at 142, 542 S.E.2d at 750\r\n(citing Bell, 208 S.C. at 494-95, 38 S.E.2d at 643, to explain privileged\r\ncommunication is an exception to the rule that malice will be presumed where the\r\noffending statement is actionable per se). Because David has not established that a\r\nprivilege existed, the presumption of common law malice requires a finding of\r\ngeneral damages as to the accusation of improper credit card use. See\r\nHoltzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 510, 506 S.E.2d at 501 (explaining when the law\r\npresumes the defendant acted with common law malice, it is also presumed the\r\nplaintiff suffered general damages).\r\n\r\nNone of this discussion applies to common law actual malice. Therefore, to the\r\nextent the existence of common law actual malice becomes an issue, its existence\r\nis a question of fact that must be proven at trial. See Murray, 344 S.C. at 144, 542\r\nS.E.2d at 751 (stating the existence of common law actual malice \"is ordinarily for\r\nthe jury to decide\"); Jones, 250 S.C. at 488, 158 S.E.2d at 914 (\"While [common\r\nlaw] malice will support an award of actual damages, punitive damages cannot be\r\nrecovered in the absence of proof of [common law] actual malice.\").\r\n\nAccordingly, the findings of the circuit court are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurs.\n\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs in result only. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5121","title":"State v.

Myers, of Lexington, for\r\n             Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: In this criminal appeal, Jo Pradubsri contends the trial court\r\nerred in refusing to permit cross-examination of a witness, Melisa Martin,\r\nregarding her potential legal exposure from her initial charges prior to accepting\r\nthe State's plea offer. We reverse and remand.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAs a result of numerous tips from a confidential informant (CI), the Lexington\r\nCounty Sheriff's Department (the Department) conducted a search and\r\ninvestigation into Pradubsri. The Department was also looking for Martin, who\r\nwas known to be Pradubsri's girlfriend and living with him in Richland County.\r\nOn November 9, 2008, Sergeant John William Finch of the Department received a\r\ncall from Sergeant Bobby Dale, with the Irmo Police Department, informing him\r\nPradubsri and his car were at a grocery store in Irmo. Sergeants Dale and Finch\r\nbegan surveillance at the store and observed Pradubsri and Martin exit the store\r\nand leave the parking lot in his vehicle. Because of previously gathered\r\ninformation, Sergeant Finch \"was extremely confident\" he would find illegal\r\nsubstances in Pradubsri's vehicle and initiated a stop soon after Pradubsri left the\r\nparking lot. Sergeant Finch noted the stop occurred around three in the morning.\r\nAs he approached the car, he noticed Pradubsri and Martin making \"furtive\r\nmovements in the vehicle[,] as if they were talking.\" He further stated Pradubsri's\r\nshoulders were shifting around and Pradubsri took quick glances in the mirror at\r\nhim. When Sergeant Finch requested Pradubsri exit the vehicle, he saw a gun in\r\nthe area between the driver's seat and the center console. He notified his backup\r\nofficer, Sergeant Kevin Blake, who was also with the Department, of the presence\r\nof the gun and secured Pradubsri.\r\n\r\nWhile securing Martin on the passenger side of the vehicle, Sergeant Blake found a\r\nclear plastic bag protruding from her waistband that contained a white rock-like\r\nsubstance. He then saw a second bag in her hand that contained a similar white\r\nrock-like substance, consistent with crack cocaine. A female officer was called to\r\nthe scene to conduct a further search of Martin. The officer found additional rocks\r\nof what were determined to be crack cocaine in Martin's pants. Officers also found\r\na silver handgun in Martin's purse. The officers inventoried the car, but did not\r\nfind any additional drugs. Officers found more than $700 in cash on Pradubsri.\r\nOfficers discovered a total of approximately sixty-eight grams of crack cocaine at\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nThe Lexington County grand jury indicted Pradubsri of (1) trafficking crack\r\ncocaine in an amount of twenty-eight grams or more but less than one hundred\r\ngrams, (2) possession with intent to distribute (PWID) crack cocaine within\r\nproximity of a school, and (3) unlawful carrying of a pistol. Martin was initially\r\ncharged with the same crimes as Pradubsri, but in exchange for her testimony\r\nagainst him, the State reduced her charges to possession of crack cocaine and\r\n\nunlawful carrying of a pistol. After pleading guilty prior to Pradubsri's trial date,\r\nMartin received an eighteen-month sentence.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Martin testified that on the night of her arrest, she falsely told law\r\nenforcement the crack cocaine was hers when it was actually Pradubsri's. She\r\nadmitted she wrote a letter to the Solicitor's office informing it she would testify\r\nagainst Pradubsri in exchange for a speedy plea and a more lenient sentence. She\r\nacknowledged that during her plea, she answered she was willing to testify during\r\nPradubsri's trial. On cross-examination, Pradubsri attempted to elicit testimony\r\nregarding Martin's potential legal exposure for her initial charges had she not\r\naccepted the State's plea offer. The State objected to this testimony as being\r\nirrelevant, but Pradubsri argued that pursuant to his right to confrontation under the\r\nSixth Amendment, he was allowed to elicit this testimony from Martin. Further,\r\nPradubsri contended case law supported his argument.\r\n\r\nThe trial court was concerned with Pradubsri's line of questioning because Martin\r\nwas initially charged with the same charges as Pradubsri, and thus, if that\r\ntestimony was allowed, the jury would be improperly informed of the exact\r\nsentence he was facing. The State agreed with the trial court. The trial court\r\nfurther explained the jury was not entitled to information regarding the length of\r\npotential sentences for Pradubsri's charges because other than in a death penalty\r\nsetting, it is not to be concerned with sentencing. The trial court then held\r\nPradubsri could ask Martin if she potentially had faced a substantial amount of\r\ntime without the State's plea offer because that related to the issue of bias or\r\nprejudice. However, he could not ask about the specific length of the potential\r\nsentence for each charge. The trial court sustained the State's objection with those\r\nparameters.\r\n\r\nPradubsri resumed questioning about Martin's initial charges, asking if she faced \"a\r\nsignificant amount of time on [them].\" She responded affirmatively. Pradubsri\r\nthen asked, \"When you wrote the Solicitor, didn't you say that you would do what\r\nyou could to receive a more lenient sentence?\" Martin again responded in the\r\naffirmative. She also testified the State helped her receive a reduced bond.\r\nPradubsri extensively cross-examined her regarding her prior drug use, her role in\r\nPradubsri's drug activities, and her involvement in other illegal activities.\r\n\r\nPradubsri was convicted on all counts. The trial court sentenced him to thirty\r\nyears' imprisonment for the trafficking charge, fifteen years for the PWID within\r\n\nproximity of a school charge, and one year for the pistol charge, which were all to\r\nrun consecutively. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, this court only reviews errors of law. State v. Baccus, 367 S.C.\r\n41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). An appellate court is bound by the trial court's\r\nfactual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Id. \"Admission of evidence\r\nfalls within the trial court's discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent\r\nabuse of that discretion.\" State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 625, 525 S.E.2d 246, 247\r\n(2000). \"The scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial judge,\r\nwhose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of prejudice.\" Id.\r\nat 625, 525 S.E.2d at 247-48.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Cross-Examination of Martin\r\n\r\nPradubsri maintains the restriction on cross-examination regarding Martin's exact\r\npotential legal exposure prior to her acceptance of the State's plea offer violated his\r\nSixth Amendment right to confrontation and was in contravention of our supreme\r\ncourt's decision in State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002). We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\"The jury is, generally, not entitled to learn the possible sentence of a defendant\r\nbecause the sentence is irrelevant to finding guilt or innocence.\" Id. at 331, 563\r\nS.E.2d at 318. \"However, other constitutional concerns, such as the Confrontation\r\nClause, limit the applicability of this rule in circumstances where the defendant's\r\nright to effectively cross-examine a co-conspirator witness of possible bias\r\noutweighs the need to exclude the evidence.\" Id. at 331-32, 563 S.E.2d at 318.\r\n\r\n\"The Sixth Amendment rights to notice, confrontation, and compulsory process\r\nguarantee that a criminal charge may be answered through the calling and\r\ninterrogation of favorable witnesses, the cross-examination of adverse witnesses,\r\nand the orderly introduction of evidence.\" Id. at 330, 563 S.E.2d at 317 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). \"The Sixth Amendment is applicable to the states\r\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id.\r\n\n\"A defendant has the right to cross-examine a witness concerning bias under the\r\nConfrontation Clause.\" Id. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at 317. \"On cross-examination, any\r\nfact may be elicited which tends to show interest, bias, or partiality of the witness.\"\r\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n             A criminal defendant may show a violation of the\r\n             Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited\r\n             from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-\r\n             examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias\r\n             on the part of the witness, and thereby to expose to the\r\n             jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately\r\n             draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\r\n\r\nId. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \"[t]he trial\r\njudge retains discretion to impose reasonable limits on the scope of cross-\r\nexamination.\" Id. \"Before a trial judge may limit a criminal defendant's right to\r\nengage in cross-examination to show bias on the part of the witness, the record\r\nmust clearly show the cross-examination is inappropriate.\" Id. If the defendant\r\nestablishes the limitation unfairly prejudiced him, the error is reversible. Id.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Brown, one of the State's chief witnesses was initially charged with\r\ntrafficking cocaine, the same crime for which the defendant was on trial. 303 S.C.\r\n169, 170-71, 399 S.E.2d 593, 593-94 (1991). The witness had been hired to\r\ntransport cocaine from one city to another, but when she arrived at the designated\r\nairport, she was apprehended by undercover agents. Id. at 170-71, 399 S.E.2d at\r\n594. Cocaine was found in her suitcase, and she agreed to cooperate with law\r\nenforcement by staging a sting operation for her contact. Id. at 171, 399 S.E.2d at\r\n594. She testified the person she contacted was the person who arranged their\r\nmeetings, and when he arrived, law enforcement officers arrested him. Id. The\r\nState elicited testimony from the witness regarding her plea agreement;\r\nspecifically, that in exchange for her testimony against the defendant, \"she was\r\nallowed to plead guilty to one conspiracy charge for which she could receive a\r\nmaximum sentence of seven and one-half years.\" Id. On cross-examination, she\r\nadmitted her original charge of trafficking was reduced as part of her plea\r\nagreement. Id. When the defendant attempted to ask the witness about the\r\npotential sentence for trafficking in cocaine, the trial court sustained the State's\r\nobjection. Id.\r\n\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court found the trial court abused its discretion and\r\nunfairly prejudiced the defendant in limiting the cross-examination of the witness.\r\nId. It stated \"[t]he fact [the witness] was permitted to avoid a mandatory prison\r\nterm of more than three times the duration she would face on her plea to\r\nconspiracy is critical evidence of potential bias that appellant should have been\r\npermitted to present to the jury.\" Id. Further, it found the witness's \"testimony was\r\na crucial part of the State's case since she provided the only evidence of defendant's\r\nknowing involvement in the drug transaction.\" Id. at 171-72, 399 S.E.2d at 594.\r\nBecause the error unfairly prejudiced the defendant, our supreme court held the\r\ndefendant's right to meaningful cross-examination outweighed the State's interest\r\nin excluding the evidence. Id. at 172, 399 S.E.2d at 594.\r\n\r\nIn Mizzell, the supreme court again analyzed the court's discretion in limiting\r\ncross-examination of witnesses regarding their initial legal exposure prior to\r\nmaking a deal with the State. 349 S.C. at 330-35, 563 S.E.2d at 317-20. The case\r\ninvolved the burglary of a home. Id. at 329, 563 S.E.2d 316. No physical\r\nevidence was available to further the investigation, but officers recovered some of\r\nthe stolen property from another individual's home after receiving a tip. Id. at 329-\r\n30, 563 S.E.2d at 316-17. The individual had purchased the items from the\r\ndefendants and testified another man and woman were in the truck with the\r\ndefendants when he bought the items. Id. at 330, 563 S.E.2d at 317. The State's\r\nchief witness testified he and his wife were the two other people in the truck and\r\nhad been with the defendants at the victim's home. Id. He claimed the defendants\r\nkicked in the door and entered the home, then exited with the victim's items. Id.\r\nOn cross-examination, the witness admitted the State originally charged him with\r\nthe same crimes as the defendants, but the trial court only permitted questioning\r\nthe witness in general terms about the sentence for those crimes. Id. Unlike in\r\nBrown, the witness in Mizzell had not made a plea deal nor pled guilty at the time\r\nof the defendants' trial. Id. at 332, 563 S.E.2d at 318. The witness did state \"he\r\n'could get a long sentence for these crimes.'\" Id. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319. The\r\ncourt in Mizzell held:\r\n\r\n             The fact the witness has yet to reach a plea bargain or\r\n             been found guilty should not prevent the admission of\r\n             such evidence. The lack of a negotiated plea, if anything,\r\n             creates a situation where the witness is more likely to\r\n             engage in biased testimony in order to obtain a future\r\n             recommendation for leniency.\r\n\nId. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318. Further, the court found \"a witness admitting he is\r\nsubject to a 'long sentence' is quite different from a witness admitting he could be\r\nsentenced to a maximum of life in prison, the sentence faced . . . if convicted of\r\nfirst degree burglary.\" Id. at 334-35, 563 S.E.2d at 319. Thus, it found the trial\r\ncourt committed a prejudicial error in restricting the defendant's cross-examination.\r\nId. at 335, 563 S.E.2d at 320.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Gracely, 399 S.C. 363, 366, 731 S.E.2d 880, 881 (2012), the State\r\ninvestigated the sale of methamphetamine within a community. As a result, the\r\nState obtained a fifty-two count indictment against various individuals. Id. Count\r\ntwo of the indictment alleged Gracely conspired to sell \"'more than four hundred\r\ngrams of methamphetamine.'\" Id. To establish its case against Gracely, the State\r\nrelied upon evidence presented \"in the form of testimony from seven individuals\r\nalso named in the [i]ndictment.\" Id. at 366, 731 S.E.2d at 881-82. Gracely\r\nattempted \"to show the potential bias of each witness by presenting to the jury\r\ninformation regarding the significantly lighter sentences th[o]se witnesses received\r\nin exchange for their testimony.\" Id. at 366-67, 731 S.E.2d at 882. When Gracely\r\nquestioned one of the State's witnesses about the mandatory minimum and\r\nmaximum sentences for the initial charges he faced, the trial court instructed \"the\r\nwitnesses could be questioned about the maximum punishment, but not the\r\nmandatory minimum punishment, for those charges they had in common with\r\nGracely.\" Id. at 367, 731 S.E.2d at 882. Several of the State's witnesses admitted\r\nto past criminal records. Id. at 368-71, 731 S.E.2d at 882-84.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court clarified its decision in Brown, stating, \"The fact that a\r\ncooperating witness avoided a mandatory minimum sentence is critical information\r\nthat a defendant must be allowed to present to the jury.\" Id. at 374-75, 731 S.E.2d\r\nat 886. Thus, the trial court erred in not allowing the jury to hear the mandatory\r\nminimum sentences the witnesses faced on their initial charges. Id. at 374, 731\r\nS.E.2d at 886.\r\n\r\nHere, the trial court allowed cross-examination in general terms about the sentence\r\nMartin faced under her original charges. On a first offense trafficking charge, she\r\nfaced a mandatory minimum of seven years, but she only received eighteen months\r\nafter pleading guilty to a lesser charge.1 However, to avoid informing the jury of\r\n\r\n1 Based upon her prior criminal history in the record, Martin would have faced\r\ntrafficking in crack cocaine in an amount of twenty-eight grams or more, but less\r\n\nthe exact sentence Pradubsri was facing, the trial court refused to allow Pradubsri\r\nto question her on the exact potential sentence of each charge. Pradubsri claimed\r\nthe cross-examination regarding Martin's potential legal exposure was relevant to\r\nher bias and motive in testifying. Pradubsri's right to meaningful cross-\r\nexamination outweighed the State's interest in excluding the evidence. Because the\r\nevidence was critical to showing Martin's potential bias, the trial court erred in\r\nrefusing to allow that evidence into the record.\r\n\r\nII.   Reversible Error\r\n\r\n\"[This court's] inquiry does not end upon finding the trial court committed an error\r\nin limiting the cross-examination . . . .\" Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at\r\n318. \"An error is not reversible unless it is material and prejudicial to the\r\nsubstantial rights of the appellant.\" State v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. 388, 414, 649\r\nS.E.2d 41, 55 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), aff'd, 387 S.C.\r\n310, 692 S.E.2d 895 (2010). \"A violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment\r\nright to confront the witness is not per se reversible error if the error was harmless\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). \"No definite rule of law governs finding an error\r\nharmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be\r\ndetermined from its relationship to the entire case.\" Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. at 414,\r\n649 S.E.2d at 55.\r\n\r\n             Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular\r\n             facts of each case and upon a host of factors including:\r\n\r\n             the importance of the witness' testimony in the\r\n             prosecution's case, whether the testimony was\r\n             cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence\r\n             corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the\r\n             witness on material points, the extent of cross-\r\n             examination otherwise permitted, and of course the\r\n             overall strength of the prosecution's case.\r\n\r\n\r\nthan one hundred grams, first offense. In 2009, at the time of the indictment in this\r\ncase, the statute provided for a mandatory minimum of seven years, but no more\r\nthan twenty-five years on that charge. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(C)(1)(2)(a)\r\n(Supp. 2005).\r\n\nMizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318-19 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n\"Harmless beyond a reasonable doubt means the reviewing court can conclude the\r\nerror did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Mizzell, 349\r\nS.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In determining\r\nwhether an error is harmless, the reviewing court must review the entire record to\r\ndetermine what effect the error had on the verdict.\" Id. (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). Whether the improper introduction of \"evidence is harmless requires us\r\nto look at the other evidence admitted at trial to determine whether the defendant's\r\nguilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational\r\nconclusion could be reached.\" State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. 57, 62-63, 533 S.E.2d\r\n325, 328 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C.\r\nat 415, 649 S.E.2d at 55 (finding an insubstantial error not affecting the result of\r\nthe trial is harmless when guilt has been conclusively proven by competent\r\nevidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached).\r\n\r\nIn Gracely, in determining whether the error was harmless, the supreme court\r\nsummarized Mizzell and the Van Arsdall2 factors. 399 S.C. at 375-76, 731 S.E.2d\r\nat 886-87. It found that while the State's witnesses presented cumulative\r\ntestimonies, they only corroborated the others' testimonies. Id. at 376, 731 S.E.2d\r\nat 887. The State presented no physical evidence tying Gracely to the scene of the\r\ncrime, enhancing the importance of the witnesses' testimonies. Id. The court noted\r\nno other evidence linked Gracely to the indicted offense. Id. Our supreme court\r\ndetermined the trial court should have considered the witnesses' backgrounds when\r\nlimiting Gracely's cross-examination. Id. at 377, 731 S.E.2d at 887. The witnesses\r\nin Gracely all had \"significant involvement with illegal drugs and other criminal\r\nactivities, and cooperated following arrest and the possibility of long prison terms.\"\r\nId. Because the case was established on circumstantial evidence, which included\r\nthe testimonies of witnesses \"with such suspect credibility,\" the court decided a\r\nruling \"preventing a full picture of the possible bias of those witnesses\" could not\r\nbe considered harmless. Id. Accordingly, it reversed and remanded the case. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the State based Pradubsri's trafficking charge on the theory of constructive\r\npossession. South Carolina's definition of trafficking crack cocaine includes: \"A\r\nperson . . . who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who\r\nknowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of ten grams or\r\n\r\n2   Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1980).\r\n\nmore of . . . [crack cocaine] . . . is guilty of a felony which is known as 'trafficking\r\nin . . . cocaine base.'\" S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(C) (Supp. 2012). \"To prove\r\nconstructive possession, the State must show a defendant had dominion and\r\ncontrol, or the right to exercise dominion and control, over the [drugs].\r\nConstructive possession can be established by circumstantial as well as direct\r\nevidence, and possession may be shared.\" State v. Jackson, 395 S.C. 250, 255, 717\r\nS.E.2d 609, 611 (Ct. App. 2011) (alteration by court) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). \"Where contraband materials are found on premises under the control of\r\nthe accused, this fact in and of itself gives rise to an inference of knowledge and\r\npossession which may be sufficient to carry the case to the jury.\" State v.\r\nMuhammed, 338 S.C. 22, 27, 524 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 1999) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). \"Possession requires more than mere presence.\"\r\nJackson, 395 S.C. at 255, 717 S.E.2d at 611-12 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\"In drug cases, the element of knowledge is seldom established through direct\r\nevidence, but may be proven circumstantially.\" Id. at 255, 717 S.E.2d at 612\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"Knowledge can be proven by the evidence of\r\nacts, declarations, or conduct of the accused from which the inference may be\r\ndrawn that the accused knew of the existence of the prohibited substances.\" Id.\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn another State v. Brown, 267 S.C. 311, 317, 227 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1976), our\r\nsupreme court reversed the denial of a defendant's motion for a directed verdict on\r\na possession of marijuana charge. The defendant was a passenger in a car in which\r\nmarijuana was found. Id. at 313-14, 227 S.E.2d at 675-76. The court noted the\r\nState presented no evidence as to (1) who owned the car, (2) whether the passenger\r\nand the driver had any special relationship, (3) whether the passenger used or sold\r\ndrugs, (4) whether the passenger recognized the smell of marijuana, (5) whether\r\nthe driver and passenger were close friends, or (6) whether the driver and\r\npassenger had spent a substantial portion of the night together. Id. at 315-16, 227\r\nS.E.2d at 676-77. The court also noted the bag of drugs was situated so that the\r\npassenger might not have seen it and it was opaque. Id. at 315, 227 S.E.2d at 676.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Blue, 957 F.2d 106, 106-07 (4th Cir. 1992), a police officer conducting\r\nnighttime surveillance of a house for possible illegal drug activity saw two men\r\nleave the house and enter a parked vehicle on the street. After the car began\r\nmoving and was in a well-lit area, the officer stopped the vehicle to investigate a\r\nseatbelt violation, and while approaching, noticed the shoulder of the passenger\r\n\"dip as if the passenger were reaching under the seat with his right hand.\" Id. at\r\n107. After the driver and passenger exited the vehicle, the officer searched the\r\n\npassenger for any weapons and \"discovered a needle, a syringe, and a small\r\namount of heroin, and therefore placed [him] under arrest.\" Id. After searching the\r\nvehicle, the officer found a loaded gun under the passenger's seat. Id. Both the\r\ndriver and passenger denied knowledge or ownership of the gun. Id. The\r\npassenger did not own the vehicle, and the government presented no evidence the\r\npassenger had been in the vehicle before. Id. at 108. The Fourth Circuit\r\ndetermined a passenger's shoulder dip alone did not transform him from a mere\r\npassenger in the car to a possessor of whatever was discovered underneath the seat\r\nin which he was sitting. Id. at 108. The court found \"the facts of this case fall\r\noutside, but just barely, the realm of the quantum of evidence necessary to support\r\na finding of constructive possession.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the Lexington County Sheriff's Office had been searching for Martin and\r\nPradubsri due to previous tips from a CI. Pradubsri and Martin were in an on-\r\ngoing relationship and had been together that night for at least a couple of hours\r\nbefore their arrests. Pradubsri owned the vehicle in which the drugs were located.\r\nSome of the drugs were found inside Martin's clothing, and a bag containing drugs\r\nwas found in her hand as well. Sergeant Finch testified that when he made the\r\ntraffic stop and approached Pradubsri's vehicle, he noticed the two inside talking\r\nand moving around, but never saw Pradubsri with the drugs. Additionally,\r\nPradubsri had a firearm and $700 in cash on his person.\r\n\r\nIn Brown, 303 S.C. at 172, 399, S.E.2d at 594, the court noted the State's chief\r\nwitness was the only person who could testify as to the defendant's involvement in\r\nthe drug transactions. Here, Sergeant Finch testified he pulled over Pradubsri's\r\nvehicle in which Pradubsri and Martin were located but he did not see Pradubsri\r\nwith any drugs. Martin's testimony was the only testimony that indicated the drugs\r\nwere Pradubsri's. The State failed to present evidence amounting to constructive\r\npossession of the drugs without Martin's testimony. They were all found on\r\nMartin's person. Only Martin's testimony demonstrated Pradubsri had constructive\r\npossession of the drugs. Accordingly, Martin's testimony was essential to the\r\nState's case. Therefore, the error in not allowing cross-examination regarding her\r\nexact potential sentence was not harmless.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe trial court erred in restricting Pradubsri's cross-examination regarding Martin's\r\npotential legal exposure prior to her accepting the State's plea offer. That cross-\r\nexamination should have been allowed pursuant to the Confrontation Clause\r\n\nbecause it would have shown a particular bias in Martin's testimony against\r\nPradubsri. Further, the error was not harmless due to the lack of sufficient\r\nevidence to find Pradubsri constructively possessed the drugs without Martin's\r\ntestimony. For the foregoing reasons, the trial court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nLOCKEMY, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part: I concur with the\r\nmajority that the trial court erred in restricting Pradubsri's cross-examination about\r\nthe mandatory minimum sentence for Martin's initial charges. However, I\r\nrespectfully dissent to the majority's reversal based upon a harmless error analysis.\r\nEven in light of our supreme court's recent decision in State v. Gracely, 399 S.C.\r\n363, 731 S.E.2d 880 (2012), I believe distinguishing facts exist in this case to\r\nallow a finding of harmless error.\r\n\r\nGracely made clear a harmless error analysis is still applicable despite a trial\r\ncourt's improper restriction on cross-examining a witness about a mandatory\r\nminimum sentence stemming from initial charges prior to accepting a lesser plea\r\noffer. Id. at 375, 731 S.E.2d at 886. The court specifically found \"[a] violation of\r\nthe Confrontation Clause is not per se reversible but is subject to a harmless error\r\nanalysis.\" Id. (citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)).\r\n\r\n             Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case\r\n             depends upon a host of factors . . . . The[se] factors\r\n             include the importance of the witness's testimony in the\r\n             prosecution's case, whether the testimony was\r\n             cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence\r\n             corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the\r\n             witness on material points, the extent of cross\r\n             examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the\r\n             overall strength of the prosecution's case.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684) (emphasis omitted); see State v.\r\nGraham, 314 S.C. 383, 386, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994) (\"The list of factors as set\r\nout in Van Arsdall is not exhaustive.\").\r\n\r\nFirst, I would distinguish this case from State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 536 S.E.2d\r\n315 (2002), and State v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 399 S.E.2d 593 (1991), because\r\n\nMartin was not the only witness placing Pradubsri at the scene of the crime. Our\r\nsupreme court in Mizzell found it critical that the State's chief witness was the only\r\nwitness able to place the defendant at the scene of the crime, and the complete lack\r\nof physical evidence at the scene of the crime served to greatly enhance the chief\r\nwitness's testimony. Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319. Thus, it was\r\nunfairly prejudicial to restrict cross-examination of the State's chief witness as to\r\nhis potential bias resulting from leniency in his sentence in exchange for his\r\ntestimony against the defendant. Id. at 335, 563 S.E.2d at 320. Similarly, in\r\nBrown, the court noted the State's chief witness was the only person who could\r\ntestify as to the defendant's involvement in the drug transactions. State v. Brown,\r\n303 S.C. 169, 171-72, 399 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1991).\r\n\r\nUnlike in Mizzell and Brown, a second witness in this case, also placed Pradubsri\r\nat the scene of the crime. Sergeant Finch explained he had prior knowledge of\r\nPradubsri's involvement in illegal activity. He stated his estimated two-month\r\ninvestigation led up to the arrest, and thus, he knew Pradubsri by appearance and\r\nname. Further, he was confident he had legal authority to pull Pradubsri over that\r\nnight. Even without Martin's testimony, other witnesses testified regarding the\r\ndetails of the traffic stop and the amount of drugs found at the scene, making a\r\nsubstantial portion of Martin's testimony cumulative for purposes of the actual\r\ncrime for which Pradubsri was charged.\r\n\r\nIn examining the overall strength of the State's case and the presence of evidence\r\ncorroborating the witness's testimony, I note, as did the majority, that the State\r\nbased Pradubsri's trafficking charge on the theory of constructive possession. I\r\nconcur with the majority's recitation of South Carolina's definition of trafficking\r\ncrack cocaine and the requirements of constructive possession; however, we\r\ndisagree on the application of prior case law to the present facts.\r\n\r\nIn another case titled State v. Brown, our supreme court outlined the facts the State\r\nused to support its theory of constructive possession against Brown:\r\n\r\n             The sum total of the State's evidence against Brown is\r\n             that he was a passenger in a car on a deserted rural road\r\n             about 1:00 A.M., that Wolfe had an undetermined sum of\r\n             cash in a large roll, that Brown was nervous and had no\r\n             identification, that there was a smell of marijuana in the\r\n             car, and that there was a large opaque bag containing\r\n             eight pounds of marijuana on the rear floorboard. Wolfe\r\n\n             knew Brown's name as Chuck Brown and Brown told\r\n             Wolfe to be quiet when Wolfe started to admit the crime.\r\n\r\n267 S.C. 311, 315, 227 S.E.2d 674, 676 (1976).\r\n\r\nThe court listed the deficiencies in the State's circumstantial evidence, stating\r\n\r\n             [t]here was no evidence adduced . . . as to ownership of\r\n             the car or any special relation appellant had with Wolfe\r\n             or the owner from which Brown's control of the car or its\r\n             contents might be inferred. The bag containing the\r\n             marijuana was opaque and so situated that a front seat\r\n             passenger might never have seen the bag, much less its\r\n             contents. There was no evidence that Brown was a seller\r\n             or user of drugs, or that he even recognized the odor of\r\n             marijuana; or that he was a close friend of the driver; or\r\n             that he spent a substantial part of the night with him.\r\n             Although Rogers testified he smelled the odor of burned\r\n             marijuana he found no residue of such in or about the car\r\n             of the defendant.\r\n\r\nId. at 315-16, 227 S.E.2d at 676-77 (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Jackson, 395 S.C. 250, 258, 717 S.E.2d 609, 613 (2011), this court\r\ndetermined the State failed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence of\r\nknowledge to support the charge of constructive possession. The drugs were found\r\nunder the center console of the vehicle where the gear shifter was located. Id. The\r\ndefendant did not own or rent the vehicle, and there was another person driving it.\r\nId. Furthermore, the defendant had only met the driver once previously. Id.\r\nWhile the officer testified he smelled marijuana when approaching the vehicle, he\r\nnever testified as to any suspicious movement by the defendant. Id. This court\r\nevaluated two other cases, State v. Brown, 267 S.C. 311, 227 S.E.2d 674 (1976),\r\nmentioned previously, and State v. Blue, 957 F.2d 106, 107 (4th Cir. 1992), and\r\nfound the State presented even less evidence against the defendant than in either\r\nBrown or Blue. Id. at 256-58, 717 S.E.2d at 612-13. It stated in comparison to\r\nthose two cases, \"[t]he drugs were more out of sight, and the State presented no\r\nevidence that [defendant] was nervous or made any suspicious movements.\" Id. at\r\n258, 717 S.E.2d at 613. Importantly, the court noted Blue gave guidance regarding\r\n\nthe threshold amount of evidence necessary to support a finding of constructive\r\npossession.3 Id. at 257-58, 717 S.E.2d at 613.\r\n\r\nIn Blue, a police officer conducting nighttime surveillance of a house for possible\r\nillegal drug activity saw two men leave the house and enter a parked vehicle on the\r\nstreet. 957 F.2d at 106-07. The officer pulled the vehicle over in a well-lit area to\r\ninvestigate a seatbelt violation, and while approaching, noticed the shoulder of the\r\npassenger, Herbert Blue, \"dip as if [he] were reaching under the seat with his right\r\nhand.\" Id. at 107. After the driver and Blue exited the vehicle, the officer searched\r\nBlue for any weapons and \"discovered a needle, a syringe, and a small amount of\r\nheroin, and therefore placed [him] under arrest.\" Id. After searching the vehicle, a\r\nloaded gun was found under Blue's seat. Id. Both the driver and Blue denied\r\nknowledge or ownership of the gun. Id. Blue was not the owner of the vehicle,\r\nand no evidence was presented that he had been in the vehicle before. Id. at 108.\r\n\r\nBlue was convicted, and on appeal, the Fourth Circuit found the government relied\r\non the following evidence to support its case: (1) the officer's testimony that Blue's\r\nshoulder dipped as the officer approached the vehicle and (2) the discovery of the\r\ngun under the passenger seat. Id. at 107-08. In reversing Blue's conviction, the\r\nFourth Circuit determined while the \"shoulder dip alone [did] not transform Blue\r\nfrom a mere passenger in the [vehicle] to a possessor of whatever [was] discovered\r\nunderneath the seat in which he [was] sitting . . . the facts of this case fall outside,\r\nbut just barely, the realm of the quantum of evidence necessary to support a finding\r\nof constructive possession.\"4 Id. at 108.\r\n\r\nHere, the Lexington County Sheriff's Office was conducting an on-going search for\r\nMartin and Pradubsri due to previous tips from a CI. Pradubsri was the owner of\r\nthe vehicle in which the drugs were located. Pradubsri and Martin were in a\r\nrelationship, lived in the same home, and had been together for at least a couple of\r\nhours on the night of the arrest. While some of the crack cocaine was found inside\r\nMartin's clothing, there was a clear, plastic bag containing crack cocaine as well,\r\n\r\n3 The charge at issue in Blue was constructive possession of a gun, however it is\r\nthe theory of constructive possession remains the same despite the difference in the\r\nobject that is being possessed.\r\n4I recognize Blue is cited and discussed in the majority's opinion as well, and they\r\nadopt strikingly similar language from this dissent, but we come to different\r\nconclusions.\r\n\nfound in her hand, to which Pradubsri could have had full access, control, or\r\ndominion at any point. Sergeant Finch testified that when he made the traffic stop\r\nand approached Pradubsri's vehicle, he noticed the two occupants talking and\r\nmoving around, allowing an inference that the two could have been attempting to\r\nhide the drugs. Moreover, Pradubsri had a firearm, as well as $700 in cash on his\r\nperson. I believe the State presented a case distinguishable from Brown and\r\nJackson, and that far exceeded the low threshold delineated in Blue. Importantly, I\r\nbelieve the State presented a case by which a jury could have found Pradubsri\r\nguilty of constructive possession of the drugs, even without Martin's testimony.\r\n\r\nDespite the restriction against questioning about Martin's exact potential legal\r\nexposure, Pradubsri was able to thoroughly cross-examine her on other points\r\nregarding her bias and credibility. She discussed the exact charges she faced\r\nbefore the State allowed her to plead to lesser charges in exchange for testifying\r\nagainst Pradubsri. She further stated there was \"a significant amount of time\" on\r\nher initial charges and admitted to writing a letter to the Solicitor essentially\r\nbegging to do whatever she needed in exchange for a more lenient sentence.\r\nAnother point of distinction in Gracely, as well as Brown and Mizzell, was the\r\ndifference in the relevant mandatory minimums. Based upon her prior criminal\r\nhistory in the record, Martin would have faced trafficking in crack cocaine in an\r\namount of twenty-eight grams or more, but less than one hundred grams, first\r\noffense. In 2009, at the time of the indictment in this case, the pertinent statute\r\nprovided for a mandatory minimum of seven years, but no more than twenty-five\r\nyears. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(C)(1)(2)(a) (Supp. 2005). In Gracely, Mizzell,\r\nand Brown, the relevant mandatory minimum at issue was twenty-five years or\r\nmore, a significant increase from a mandatory minimum of seven years.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Pradubsri was able to cross-examine Martin regarding her statement at\r\nthe scene of the arrest that the crack was hers, even though at trial, she testified it\r\nwas owned by Pradubsri. During direct examination, she admitted a bench warrant\r\nwas issued because she did not initially appear to testify at Pradubsri's trial after\r\nbeing subpoenaed. She testified she used crack cocaine every day during the time\r\nshe dated Pradubsri and had an addiction to it. She also explained she previously\r\noperated an escort service. She had a substantial criminal record that was entered\r\ninto evidence. Thus, the jury had ample reason to discount her testimony and\r\ncredibility because she was obviously lying about the drugs at the scene of the\r\narrest, trial, or both occasions. The record reflects other points of her credibility\r\nand bias were fully tested.\r\n\nWhile the State's case against Pradubsri would have been harder to prove without\r\nMartin's testimony, I believe there was evidence for the jury to find him guilty of\r\nconstructive possession of the drugs. Further, the weakness in the State's case\r\nwithout Martin's testimony is but one factor in determining the harmlessness of the\r\nerror. There must be some credence given to the fact that our supreme court has\r\nleft a multi-factor harmless error analysis intact. Although Justice Kittredge was\r\nreferring to another legal issue, his quote is relevant under these facts as well: \"[I]t\r\nmay be a rare occurrence for the State to prove harmless error beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt in these circumstances. But these determinations are necessarily context\r\ndependent, and a categorical rule is at odds with longstanding harmless error\r\njurisprudence.\" State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 482, 716 S.E.2d 91, 96 (2011)\r\n(Kittredge, J., dissenting).\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the factors provided in Van Arsdall, I would find the error in not\r\nallowing cross-examination regarding Martin's potential mandatory minimum\r\nsentence was harmless.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5122","title":"McNeil v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nSCDC employed McNeil at Kirkland Reception and Evaluation Center (Kirkland)\r\nas a captain. SCDC maintains custody of, exercises control of, and provides for\r\nthe care of inmates and prisoners incarcerated by the state, including Kirkland,\r\nwhich is located in Richland County. An inmate, who was prescribed hypertrophic\r\nmedication for threatening suicide, was transported to Kirkland, and despite his\r\nrequest for his medication, he did not receive it. McNeil claimed she was not made\r\naware of the inmate's prescribed medication when he arrived at Kirkland. Even\r\nthough the inmate was a known suicide risk, he was not placed in a cell with a\r\nclosed-circuit camera as required. On the night of the incident, only McNeil and\r\none other officer were on duty in violation of Kirkland's regulations requiring four\r\nto six officers. Sometime between 4 and 4:45 a.m. on August 11, 2006, the inmate\r\ncommitted suicide by stuffing toilet paper in his mouth and nose, asphyxiating\r\nhimself. McNeil made this discovery when she tried to rouse the inmate for the\r\n4:45 a.m. standing count.\r\n\r\nSCDC performed an internal investigation as to the inmate's death and asked\r\nSLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to perform its own investigation.\r\nThereafter, McNeil was cleared of any responsibility for the inmate's death and\r\nwas promoted to sergeant in November 2008. In December 2007, the inmate's\r\nfamily filed a wrongful death lawsuit against SCDC. The case was mediated and\r\nsettled in July 2009. In September 2009, McNeil was terminated because of\r\nalleged negligence in her duties at the time of the inmate's death and falsification\r\nof documents after his suicide.\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2010, McNeil filed a complaint against SCDC, and SCDC\r\nDirector Jon Ozmint, SCDC Director of Operations Robert Ward, and Kirkland\r\nWarden Bernard McKie, in their individual capacities.1 Her complaint alleged\r\ncauses of action for due process violations, public policy discharge, negligence,\r\ngross negligence, defamation, and civil conspiracy. McNeil claimed that because\r\nof the large settlement and the high scrutiny placed on them, Ozmint, Ward, and\r\nMcKie \"feared pressure from the media and certain legislators resulting in an\r\n\r\n1   SCDC is the only respondent in this appeal.\r\n\nagenda to find a scapegoat or to punish someone to take the pressure off of\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nSCDC filed a motion to dismiss McNeil's claims on March 28, 2011, alleging she\r\nfailed to state a cause of action for which relief can be granted. After a hearing on\r\nthe matter, on August 15, 2011, the trial court issued its order granting SCDC's\r\nmotion to dismiss McNeil's claims. The order notes McNeil alleged in her\r\ncomplaint \"she was terminated for 'personal, political, pretextual, and scapegoating\r\npurposes' in violation of public policy.\" However, the court explained, \"South\r\nCarolina has long recognized the doctrine of employment at-will, such that an\r\nemployer may terminate an employee for good reason, no reason, or bad reason\r\nwithout liability.\" Further, the court stated McNeil \"does not dispute that she was\r\nan at-will employee and even if she was terminated for personal reasons or as a\r\nscapegoat as she alleges, she still fails to state a claim and her action must be\r\ndismissed.\" Additionally, the court noted McNeil neither alleged her discharge\r\nwas in violation of any statute or act by the General Assembly, nor cited to a South\r\nCarolina case that has found a violation of public policy without a violation of a\r\nstatute or act by the General Assembly. As a result of failing to state a claim for\r\nwrongful termination, the court found her remaining causes of action could not go\r\nforward and must be dismissed.2 McNeil filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion,\r\nwhich the court denied. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, this\r\ncourt applies the same standard of review as the trial court. Doe v. Marion, 373\r\nS.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2007). \"In considering a motion to dismiss a\r\ncomplaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,\r\nthe trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.\"\r\nId. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper if the facts alleged and inferences\r\nreasonably deducible therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nplaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory. Id. The court should\r\nnot dismiss the complaint merely because it doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the\r\naction. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 McNeil did not appeal the dismissal of her claims for negligence and gross\r\nnegligence; therefore, the trial court's dismissal of these claims is the law of the\r\ncase.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Public Policy Discharge\r\nMcNeil argues the trial court erred in finding she failed to state a claim for public\r\npolicy discharge on the face of her complaint because she pled she was terminated\r\nafter complaining about institutional safety violations and testifying after being\r\nsubpoenaed in a civil trial. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"An at-will employee may be terminated at any time for any reason or for no\r\nreason, with or without cause.\" Barron v. Labor Finders of S.C., 393 S.C. 609,\r\n614, 713 S.E.2d 634, 636 (2011). \"Under the 'public policy exception' to the at-\r\nwill employment doctrine, however, an at-will employee has a cause of action in\r\ntort for wrongful termination where there is a retaliatory termination of the at-will\r\nemployee in violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\" Id. at 614, 713 S.E.2d\r\nat 637. \"The primary source of the declaration of the public policy of the state is\r\nthe General Assembly; the courts assume this prerogative only in the absence of\r\nlegislative declaration.\" Citizens' Bank v. Heyward, 135 S.C. 190, 133 S.E. 709,\r\n713 (1925); see Barron, 393 S.C. at 617, 713 S.E.2d at 638 (stating the\r\ndetermination of what constitutes public policy for purposes of the public policy\r\nexception to the at-will employment doctrine is a question of law for the courts to\r\ndecide). \"The public policy exception clearly applies in cases where either (1) the\r\nemployer requires the employee to violate the law, or (2) the reason for the\r\nemployee's termination itself is a violation of criminal law.\" Barron, 393 S.C. at\r\n614, 713 S.E.2d at 637; see Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C.\r\n219, 225, 337 S.E.2d 213, 216 (1985) (holding the public policy exception is\r\ninvoked when an employer requires an at-will employee, as a condition of\r\nretaining employment, to violate the law); Culler v. Blue Ridge Elec. Co-op., Inc.,\r\n309 S.C. 243, 246, 422 S.E.2d 91, 93 (1992) (finding employee would have a\r\ncause of action for wrongful discharge if he was discharged because he refused to\r\ncontribute to a political action fund). The Barron court found the public policy\r\nexception is not limited to these two situations; however, the exception has not yet\r\nbeen extended beyond them. 393 at 614, 713 S.E.2d at 637.\r\n\r\nAs the dissent notes, in two cases for wrongful termination based on the public\r\npolicy exception, our courts have reversed the trial court's dismissal pursuant to a\r\n12(b)(6) motion because the allegations were novel and deserved further\r\ndevelopment of the facts. We find these cases are distinguishable from this case.\r\n\nIn Garner v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., 318 S.C. 223, 223, 456 S.E.2d 907, 908\r\n(1995), the employee alleged his employer terminated him in retaliation for\r\nreporting to the United States Department of Energy and the news media his\r\nconcerns about radioactive contamination and unsafe working conditions at the\r\nSavannah River Site and for voluntarily testifying about his concerns before the\r\nDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. Our supreme court held the trial court's\r\ndismissal of the employee's wrongful discharge action based on the public policy\r\nexception to the employment at-will doctrine for failure to state a claim was\r\ninappropriate when the employee alleged his employment was terminated in\r\nretaliation for reporting and testifying about radioactive contamination and unsafe\r\nworking conditions at the nuclear facility. Id. at 226-27, 456 S.E.2d at 909-10.\r\nThe court stated \"[w]hether the [public policy] exception applies when an\r\nemployee is terminated in retaliation for reporting and testifying about radioactive\r\ncontamination and unsafe working conditions at a nuclear facility is a novel issue,\r\nand such issues should not ordinarily be decided in ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion to\r\ndismiss.\" Id. at 226, 456 S.E.2d at 909. We find Garner to be distinguishable\r\nbecause the existence of radioactive contamination and unsafe working conditions\r\nis a matter of public interest and public policy, and the employee specifically\r\nalleged his termination was in retaliation for reporting his concerns to the proper\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nIn Keiger v. Citgo, Coastal Petroleum, Inc., 326 S.C. 369, 370, 482 S.E.2d 792,\r\n793 (Ct. App. 1997), the employee alleged her employer terminated her\r\nemployment in retaliation for reporting her concerns to the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Labor about violations of state and federal labor laws for reducing\r\nher pay without prior notice. The employee told the manager she had contacted the\r\nstate labor board and, based on the advice she had received, if the violations were\r\nnot corrected immediately, she would file a formal complaint with the labor board.\r\nId. This court held whether an employer's retaliatory discharge of an employee\r\nwho threatened to invoke her rights under the Payment of Wages Act was a\r\nviolation of a clear mandate of public policy and was a novel issue; therefore, the\r\ntrial court erred in dismissing the employee's cause of action pursuant to a Rule\r\n12(b)(6) motion. Id. at 373, 482 S.E.2d at 794. We find Keiger to be\r\ndistinguishable because a violation of the Payment of Wages Act is a violation of a\r\nclear mandate of public policy, and the employee specifically alleged her\r\ntermination was in retaliation for reporting her concerns to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nMcNeil's complaint does not contend SCDC demanded she violate a law or her\r\ntermination violated any law. Her complaint also does not state sufficient facts\r\n\nfrom which a court could determine a violation of any public policy. McNeil\r\nmerely alleges SCDC terminated her for personal, political, pretextual, and\r\nscapegoating purposes. She does not allege her termination was retaliatory. The\r\ndissent finds the trial court failed to consider whether this case poses a novel issue\r\nand whether the facts should have been developed further before the motion to\r\ndismiss was granted. On the contrary, the learned trial court found McNeil's\r\nallegations that she was discharged for personal, pretextual, and scapegoating\r\npurposes was insufficient to state a violation of the public policy of South Carolina\r\nbecause our law provides an at-will employee may be terminated for a good\r\nreason, bad reason, or no reason at all. Simply stated, a litigant must allege more\r\nthan a general statement that her discharge violated public policy. The complaint\r\nmust set forth specific allegations that would enable the court to determine what\r\npublic policy was violated. By the dissent's interpretation of our law, any\r\nemployee could circumvent the employment at-will doctrine by merely asserting a\r\ntermination was retaliatory in violation of a clear mandate of public policy and\r\ncontend it was a novel issue in this state. This would be contrary to the public\r\npolicy exception recognized by our courts. Therefore, we find McNeil's general\r\nallegations do not support a wrongful discharge action, and the trial court did not\r\nerr in dismissing her cause of action.\r\n\r\nII.   Due Process Violation\r\n\r\nMcNeil argues the trial court erred in finding her cause of action for violations of\r\ndue process against SCDC could not proceed because SCDC investigated the\r\ninmate's death three years prior to her termination and during those three years did\r\nnot give her any indication her job was in jeopardy. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Procedural due process requires notice and the opportunity to be heard.\"\r\nCameron & Barkley Co. v. S.C. Procurement Review Panel, 317 S.C. 437, 440,\r\n454 S.E.2d 892, 894 (1995). \"Ordinarily, a claimant is not entitled to substantive\r\ndue process when her state employment is terminated unless she has a property\r\ninterest in continued employment.\" Hamilton v. Bd. of Trs. of Oconee Cnty. Sch.\r\nDist., 282 S.C. 519, 524-25, 319 S.E.2d 717, 721 (Ct. App. 1984). \"[A] property\r\ninterest in employment can be found in existing state law; in contracts, express or\r\nimplied; or in mutually explicit understandings.\" Id. at 525, 319 S.E.2d at 721.\r\n\r\nMcNeil does not allege she was not given an opportunity to be heard regarding her\r\ntermination. In fact, McNeil admits \"she was given her grievance rights following\r\nher termination.\" McNeil also has not provided any state law or regulation that\r\n\nwould require her employment contract to be renewed, she does not claim her\r\ncontract guarantees future employment, and she does not allege she and SCDC had\r\na \"mutually explicit understanding\" that her contract would be renewed. The mere\r\nfact that McNeil's employment contract had been renewed twice in the past is not\r\nsufficient to create a protected property interest in her continued employment. See\r\nHamilton, 282 S.C. at 526, 319 S.E.2d at 722. Therefore, we find McNeil's\r\nallegations do not support an action for violation of due process, and the trial court\r\ndid not err in dismissing her cause of action.\r\n\r\nIII.   Defamation\r\n\r\nMcNeil argues the trial court erred in finding her defamation claim against SCDC\r\ncould not proceed because she pled SCDC made and published statements that\r\ninsinuated she was unfit in her business and profession. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The elements of defamation include: (1) a false and defamatory statement\r\nconcerning another; (2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (3) fault on the\r\npart of the publisher; and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of\r\nspecial harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.\" Murray\r\nv. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 139, 542 S.E.2d 743, 748 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nMcNeil did not allege any of SCDC's statements were unprivileged, and she did\r\nnot set forth with any specificity what the alleged false statements were. She also\r\ndid not allege any of the statements were published to a third party or that SCDC\r\nmade the alleged statements. Additionally, she did not assert to whom SCDC\r\nmade the alleged statements. Therefore, we find McNeil's allegations do not\r\nsupport an action for defamation, and the trial court did not err in dismissing her\r\ncause of action.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\r\n\nI respectfully dissent only as to the majority's decision to affirm the trial court's\r\ndismissal as to McNeil's public policy discharge claim.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, an at-will employee may be terminated for any reason or no\r\nreason at all. Barron v. Labor Finders of S.C., 393 S.C. 609, 614, 713 S.E.2d 634,\r\n636 (2011). Our supreme court recognized an exception to this doctrine in\r\nLudwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985).\r\nUnder the \"public policy exception\" to the at-will employment doctrine, an at-will\r\nemployee has a cause of action in tort for wrongful termination where there is a\r\nretaliatory termination of the at-will employee in violation of a clear mandate of\r\npublic policy. Ludwick, 287 S.C. at 225, 337 S.E.2d at 216. Our supreme court\r\nhas determined the public policy exception clearly applies in cases in which either:\r\n(1) the employer requires the employee to violate the law; or (2) the reason for the\r\nemployee's termination itself is a violation of criminal law. See id.; Culler v. Blue\r\nRidge Elec. Co-op., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 246, 422 S.E.2d 91, 92-93 (1992). These\r\ntwo situations seem to have been the sole focus of the trial court.\r\n\r\nWhile the trial court and, to some extent, the majority, seem focused on only these\r\ntwo situations, our supreme court has made clear the public policy exception is not\r\nlimited to only these situations. See Barron, 393 S.C. at 614, 713 S.E.2d at 637\r\n(holding the public policy exception was not limited to situations where an\r\nemployer requires an employee to violate the law or the reason for the termination\r\nitself is a violation of criminal law). In fact, in at least two cases our courts have\r\nreversed trial court grants of Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP motions on wrongful\r\ntermination claims based on the public policy exception because the allegations\r\nwere novel and deserved further development of the facts. See Garner v. Morrison\r\nKnudsen Corp., 318 S.C. 223, 226, 456 S.E.2d 907, 909 (1995); Keiger v. Citgo,\r\nCoastal Petroleum, Inc., 326 S.C. 369, 373, 482 S.E.2d 792, 794 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nIn addition, our supreme court has also held that when there is a statutory remedy\r\nfor wrongful termination, the public policy exception does not apply. See Barron,\r\n393 S.C. at 615, 713 S.E.2d at 637.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the public policy exception has developed beyond just a\r\nconsideration of whether the termination was due to an employee refusing to\r\nviolate the law or the termination itself was a violation of the law. Here, however,\r\nit appears the trial court only considered these two situations when it granted\r\nSCDC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The trial court elucidated the basis for its decision\r\nin the following passage:\r\n\n             [McNeil] points to no violation of any statute or act by\r\n             the General Assembly, but as stated above claims that her\r\n             discharge was for \"personal, pretextual and scapegoating\r\n             purposes.\" [McNeil] also points to no case in this state\r\n             that has found a violation of public policy without a\r\n             violation of a statute or act by the General Assembly.\r\n             For these reasons, the Court finds that [McNeil] fails to\r\n             allege a violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\r\n\r\nThe trial court failed to consider whether this case posed a novel issue and whether\r\nthe facts should have been developed further. In addition, the trial court did not\r\nconsider whether a statutory remedy for wrongful discharge justifying the\r\ndismissal of McNeil's case existed. Although the trial court and the majority both\r\nmentioned the public policy exception is not limited to the two situations stated\r\nabove, they noted no court has extended the public policy exception beyond them.\r\n\r\nThe majority relies heavily on Barron in affirming the trial court's decision.\r\nRespectfully, I read Barron as making clear the public policy exception is not\r\nlimited to situations in which an employee was required to break the law or the\r\ntermination itself was a violation of the law. Further, Barron declares solidly that\r\nthe decision of whether there was a violation of a clear mandate of public policy is\r\na question of law for the court and not a jury. It is interesting that Barron makes a\r\nstrong effort to clarify that the public policy exception is not limited to the two\r\nstated situations, yet the majority cites it while affirming a decision limited to those\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I do not interpret our law as holding mere allegations of a termination\r\nof an at-will employee in violation of a clear mandate of public policy are\r\nsufficient to avoid the grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The court should permit\r\nthe facts to be developed only when there is an issue that, based on guidance from\r\nprevious cases, is sufficiently novel to at least permit some discovery before\r\nsummarily dismissing the action. In this case, McNeil intimates that her\r\ncompliance with a subpoena and testimony at a deposition angered SCDC. In her\r\ncomplaint, McNeil asserts she was terminated as a scapegoat to relieve legislative\r\npressure on SCDC officials. She alleges she was terminated although SCDC knew\r\nshe had done nothing wrong and had promoted her subsequent to the incident in\r\nquestion. McNeil has alleged enough to at least raise the issue of a retaliatory\r\ntermination. The trial court held that even if her allegations were true, she did not\r\nstate a viable cause of action for a violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\r\n\nThe majority decision, in upholding the trial court, seems to be based on the\r\nconclusion that McNeil must allege that she was required to break the law, that her\r\ntermination was a violation of law, or that the facts of this case are identical to\r\nprevious cases in this area. I do not interpret the law to be so limited. The issues\r\nraised by McNeil are sufficiently novel, and she deserves at least an opportunity to\r\ndevelop the facts. Obviously, the facts here are not the same as in Garner or\r\nKeiger, but then again if they were then they would not meet the definition of\r\nnovel. Indeed, both Garner and Keiger involved different fact situations.\r\n\r\nI would reverse the trial court as to this issue only and remand for further\r\nproceedings. This in no way implies any evidence has been presented that would\r\njustify a cause of action for termination in clear violation of public policy. Further,\r\nit could very well be that McNeil's action is dismissed by summary judgment or\r\nsome other action, but prior decisions by our courts hold she at least deserves an\r\nopportunity to develop the facts. Thereafter, the trial court, as is required, should\r\nmake a ruling as a matter of law if the facts warrant the continuation of McNeil's\r\ncause of action.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5123","title":"Inglese v.

Corrigan III, Corrigan & Chandler, LLC, of\r\n             Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Mario Inglese, a lawyer, was retained to close a real estate\r\ntransaction. Inglese failed to obtain a written release of a judgment lien of which\r\nhe had actual knowledge, and as a result, a title insurance company was forced to\r\npay the judgment creditor $10,000. The title insurance company sought\r\nreimbursement from Inglese, which he paid. Inglese then sued the seller—his\r\nclient—for unjust enrichment and equitable indemnity. The circuit court granted\r\nsummary judgment to the seller. We affirm.\r\n\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nIn September 2006, Carl H. Beal Jr. entered into a contract to sell real property.\r\nThe contract provided that Beal would deliver \"marketable title . . . free of\r\nencumbrances.\" Because Beal is not an attorney, he hired Inglese to close the\r\ntransaction. Inglese commissioned a title search and discovered a judgment lien\r\nagainst the property in excess of six million dollars.1 Inglese claims he contacted\r\nthe judgment creditor's attorney, Russell S. Stemke, and reached an oral agreement\r\nwith him regarding how the judgment lien would be resolved. According to\r\nInglese, Stemke agreed to allow the net proceeds from the sale to be held in escrow\r\non the condition the property would be released from the judgment lien, pending\r\nthe outcome of the appeal in the defamation case. However, no such agreement\r\nwas ever reduced to writing.\r\n\r\nAt the closing in November 2006, Inglese represented both Beal and the buyer.\r\nBeal executed an owner's affidavit, which certified to the title insurance company\r\nthat there were \"no pending suits, proceedings, judgments, . . . [or] liens\" against\r\nhim. However, this provision was crossed out and initialed by Inglese, not by\r\nBeal. Beal executed an affidavit of ownership, which required Beal to swear that\r\n\"no judgment, decree or lien exist[ed] against [him], or against [his property], and\r\nno actions exist[ed] which may lead to such a judgment, decree or lien.\" This\r\nprovision was also crossed out and initialed by Inglese, but not by Beal. Beal\r\nclaims Inglese took these actions without Beal's knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the alleged agreement, Inglese withheld the net proceeds of\r\n$28,940 at closing and listed that amount on the settlement statement at line 507 as\r\n\"Escrow to Russell S. Stemke/Linda Erickson.\" After the closing, however,\r\nStemke denied he had an agreement with Inglese and refused to release the\r\nproperty from the judgment lien.\r\n\r\nThe buyer made a claim on the title insurance policy, and the insurance company\r\npaid the judgment creditor $10,000 to release the lien. The title insurance\r\ncompany then revoked Inglese's status as an approved title insurance agent and\r\nfiled a lawsuit against him. Inglese paid the title insurance company $10,000 to\r\nsettle the lawsuit.\r\n\r\n1The judgment was entered against Pat Beal, presumably Beal's wife, in a\r\ndefamation case brought by Linda Erickson. See generally Erickson v. Jones St.\r\nPublishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 629 S.E.2d 653 (2006).\r\n\nIn December 2010, Inglese filed this lawsuit against Beal on the theories of unjust\r\nenrichment and equitable indemnity. As we mentioned, Beal was Inglese's client.\r\nBeal filed a motion for summary judgment. In addition to claiming there was no\r\nissue of material fact as to either of Inglese's causes of action, Beal asserted the\r\nvoluntary payment doctrine and the doctrine of unclean hands as defenses. At the\r\nsummary judgment hearing, Beal's attorney argued \"basically our attorney is suing\r\nus for what [the attorney] did,\" \"my client is not an attorney,\" and \"now there's an\r\nargument . . . that because Mr. Beal somehow benefitted from this mistake made\r\nby his attorney,\" Beal must compensate his own attorney. The circuit court\r\nsummarily granted the motion in open court, stating, \"you blame Mr. Beal and Mr.\r\nBeal is not a lawyer. He can't certify title . . . . The buck stops with the closing\r\nattorney.\"\r\n\r\n      II.    The Summary Judgment Ruling\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\nRule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n             A.     The Role of an Attorney\r\n\r\nWe begin our discussion with an examination of the role of an attorney in a real\r\nestate transaction. In South Carolina, all real estate closings must be supervised by\r\nan attorney. Matrix Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Frazer, 394 S.C. 134, 138, 714 S.E.2d\r\n532, 534 (2011). This requirement is based on the policy determination that the\r\nuse of an attorney to close a real estate sale is necessary to protect the participants\r\nin the transaction and the public from the numerous things that can go wrong when\r\ntransferring real estate. See State v. Buyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. 426, 431, 357\r\nS.E.2d 15, 18 (1987) (per curiam) (requiring real estate closings to be conducted\r\nby attorneys \"for the protection of the public from the potentially severe economic\r\nand emotional consequences which may flow from erroneous advice given by\r\npersons untrained in the law\"). As the supreme court stated in Buyers Service,\r\n\r\n             We are convinced that real estate and mortgage loan\r\n             closings should be conducted only under the supervision\r\n             of attorneys, who have the ability to furnish their clients\r\n             legal advice should the need arise and fall under the\r\n             regulatory rules of this court. Again, protection of the\r\n             public is of paramount concern.\r\n\n292 S.C. at 434, 357 S.E.2d at 19; see also Matrix, 394 S.C. at 140, 714 S.E.2d at\r\n535 (stating \"the presence of attorneys in real estate loan closings is for the\r\nprotection of the public and that 'protection of the public is of paramount concern'\r\nin loan closings\" (quoting Buyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. at 434, 357 S.E.2d at 19)).\r\n\r\nThe attorney's role pursuant to this policy, therefore, is to protect the participants in\r\nreal estate transactions from the numerous potential problems that may arise.\r\nWhen an attorney is aware of such a potential problem, it is the responsibility of\r\nthe attorney to ensure that the potential never materializes. One such problem is\r\nthe existence of a judgment against the seller. A lien arises from the judgment, and\r\nif the lien is not released, the judgment creditor may foreclose against the buyer\r\nafter the sale takes place. See Ducker v. Standard Supply Co., 280 S.C. 157, 158,\r\n311 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1984) (\"Under South Carolina law, a judgment represents a\r\njudicial declaration that a judgment debtor is personally indebted to a judgment\r\ncreditor for a sum of money. A judgment may also establish a lien upon the real\r\nproperty of the debtor.\"); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 30-7-10 (2007) (a properly\r\nrecorded judgment lien on real property is valid against a purchaser of the\r\nproperty). In the specific context of a judgment lien against the property, the\r\nattorney-client relationship imposes on the attorney the fiduciary responsibility of\r\nprotecting the client by getting the judgment lien released.\r\n\r\n             B.     Unjust Enrichment Claim\r\n\r\nInglese first argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on his\r\nunjust enrichment claim. We find Inglese failed as a matter of law to establish the\r\nelements required to recover for unjust enrichment. Therefore, the circuit court\r\nwas correct to grant summary judgment on this cause of action.\r\n\r\n\"A party may be unjustly enriched when it has and retains benefits or money which\r\nin justice and equity belong to another.\" Dema v. Tenet Physician Servs.-Hilton\r\nHead, Inc., 383 S.C. 115, 123, 678 S.E.2d 430, 434 (2009). The remedy for unjust\r\nenrichment is restitution. See Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397,\r\n409, 581 S.E.2d 161, 167 (2003) (\"Restitution is a remedy designed to prevent\r\nunjust enrichment.\"). To recover restitution in the context of unjust enrichment,\r\nthe plaintiff must show: (1) he conferred a non-gratuitous benefit on the defendant;\r\n(2) the defendant realized some value from the benefit; and (3) it would be\r\ninequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the plaintiff for its\r\nvalue. Campbell v. Robinson, 398 S.C. 12, 24, 726 S.E.2d 221, 228 (Ct. App.\r\n\n2012); Niggel Assocs., Inc. v. Polo's of N. Myrtle Beach, Inc., 296 S.C. 530, 532,\r\n374 S.E.2d 507, 509 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\nInglese failed as a matter of law to establish any one of these elements. In fact,\r\nInglese did not address the elements of unjust enrichment in the circuit court or in\r\nhis briefs on appeal. Neither his initial brief to this court nor his reply brief refer to\r\nthe elements of unjust enrichment even once. He simply argued there was no basis\r\nfor summary judgment as to the defenses Beal asserted. Because we need not\r\naddress the defenses if Inglese has failed to establish the elements of the cause of\r\naction, we address the elements.\r\n\r\nAs to the first element, Inglese did not confer a benefit on Beal. Instead, the title\r\ninsurance company conferred a benefit on Beal when it paid the judgment creditor\r\nto release the lien. After that payment, the harm Inglese caused to Beal was\r\nmitigated as much as possible because the release extinguished any further liability\r\nBeal had with respect to the sale. Therefore, Inglese's decision to settle the lawsuit\r\nagainst Inglese had no impact on Beal. Moreover, not just any benefit conferred\r\nmeets the first element. Rather, the benefit must be non-gratuitous, either because\r\nit was conferred at Beal's request or because the circumstances were such that\r\nInglese could reasonably rely on Beal for repayment. Campbell, 398 S.C. at 24,\r\n726 S.E.2d at 228 (citing Niggel Assocs., 296 S.C. at 532-33, 374 S.E.2d at 509).\r\nInglese did not pay the insurance company at Beal's request. He made the payment\r\nentirely in his own self-interest to settle a lawsuit. Also, a lawyer may not rely on\r\nhis client for repayment in the event the lawyer incurs liability for the lawyer's\r\nmistake in failing to protect the client. Because Inglese conferred no benefit on\r\nBeal, he failed to meet the first element as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nAs to the second and third elements, Inglese also failed as a matter of law. We\r\nhave already discussed that Inglese conferred no benefit on Beal, and thus, Beal\r\ncould not have realized any value from the non-existent benefit. Finally, there is\r\nabsolutely nothing inequitable about Inglese's inability to recover restitution from\r\nBeal. Beal was merely trying to sell a parcel of real estate, and he should have\r\nbeen able to rely on his lawyer to protect him from the adverse effects of the\r\njudgment. Accordingly, all of the inequity in this case falls on Beal.\r\n\r\n             C.     Equitable Indemnity Claim\r\n\r\nInglese next argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on his\r\nclaim for equitable indemnity. We find this claim also fails as a matter of law, and\r\nthus the circuit court ruled correctly.\r\n\nThe right of equitable indemnity arises out of the relationship between the\r\nindemnity plaintiff and the indemnity defendant. \"Traditionally, the courts have\r\nallowed equitable indemnity in cases of imputed fault or where some special\r\nrelationship exists between the first and second parties.\" Town of Winnsboro v.\r\nWiedeman-Singleton, Inc., 303 S.C. 52, 57, 398 S.E.2d 500, 503 (Ct. App. 1990)\r\n(Winnsboro I) aff'd, 307 S.C. 128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992). Under the doctrine of\r\nequitable indemnity,\r\n\r\n             a right of indemnity exists whenever the relation between\r\n             the parties is such that either in law or in equity there is\r\n             an obligation on one party to indemnify the other, as\r\n             where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful\r\n             act of another in which he does not join.\r\n\r\nStuck v. Pioneer Logging Machinery, Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 24, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553\r\n(1983). Generally, an indemnity plaintiff may recover damages from a defendant\r\n\"where the wrongful act of the defendant has involved the [indemnity] plaintiff in\r\nlitigation with others or placed him in such relation with others as makes it\r\nnecessary to incur expense to protect his interest.\" Addy v. Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 33,\r\n183 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1971) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nWhen a sufficient relationship between them exists, the indemnity plaintiff\r\n(Inglese) must prove the following elements to recover damages on an equitable\r\nindemnity claim: (1) the indemnity defendant (Beal) is at fault in causing the\r\ndamages of the third party (the title insurance company); (2) the plaintiff has no\r\nfault for those damages; and (3) the plaintiff incurred expenses that were necessary\r\nto protect his interest in defending the third party's claim. See Town of Winnsboro\r\nv. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc., 307 S.C. 128, 121, 414 S.E.2d 118, 121 (1992)\r\n(defining a sufficient relationship for equitable indemnity); Addy, 257 S.C. at 33-\r\n34, 183 S.E.2d at 709-10 (describing the requirements for proving equitable\r\nindemnity); Walterboro Cmty. Hosp. v. Meacher, 392 S.C. 479, 485, 709 S.E.2d\r\n71, 74 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating the elements of equitable indemnity); Winnsboro I,\r\n303 S.C. at 57-59, 398 S.E.2d at 503-04 (discussing what must be proven to\r\nrecover for equitable indemnity).\r\n\r\nAs to the first element, the title insurance company's damages resulted from the\r\nfact that the judgment lien was valid and enforceable against the buyer after the\r\nsale. In this regard, Beal did nothing wrongful. He was simply attempting to sell\r\nreal estate and did the right thing by retaining an attorney to close the sale.\r\n\nInstead, it was Inglese's wrongful act in failing to resolve the lien that caused the\r\ntitle insurance company's damages. Because Beal is not at fault in causing those\r\ndamages, Inglese failed to establish the first element.\r\n\r\nInglese argues, however, that he meets the first element because Beal committed\r\nwrongful conduct that led to the judgment, and this misconduct \"has involved\r\n[Inglese] in litigation with others or placed him in such relation with others as\r\nmakes it necessary to incur expense to protect his interest.\" See Addy, 257 S.C. at\r\n33, 183 S.E.2d at 709. The argument misses the point of equitable indemnity.\r\nFirst, it was not Beal's conduct that led to the judgment. See Erickson, 368 S.C. at\r\n455-57, 629 S.E.2d at 659-60 (describing the conduct of Pat Beal leading to the\r\njudgment against her). Second, Pat Beal's conduct and the resulting judgment\r\nmerely created the situation giving rise to Inglese's responsibility to protect his\r\nclient. In other words, regardless of any misconduct resulting in a judgment and a\r\nlien against the property, Inglese was aware of the judgment lien and had a\r\nfiduciary responsibility to protect Beal from any adverse effect it may have on the\r\nreal estate sale. Inglese cannot avoid this responsibility to protect Beal by claiming\r\nthe judgment was Beal's fault. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nInglese, Beal is not at fault in causing the title insurance company's damages.\r\nTherefore, Inglese failed as a matter of law to establish the first element.\r\n\r\nInglese also failed as a matter of law to establish the second element—whether he\r\nhas no fault for the title insurance company's damages. In many cases, the\r\nresolution of an underlying lawsuit resolves the second element of an equitable\r\nindemnity claim. For example, the jury's determination in the underlying lawsuit\r\nof the indemnity plaintiff's fault will carry over to the indemnity lawsuit. See, e.g.,\r\nAddy, 257 S.C. at 32, 183 S.E.2d at 709 (\"The jury returned a verdict . . . against\r\nthe [indemnity defendant], thus exonerating the [indemnity plaintiff] of any\r\nliability.\"). The underlying lawsuit did not resolve the second element here\r\nbecause Inglese settled the underlying lawsuit before any determination of his\r\nfault. This court recognized in Meacher that even though the indemnity plaintiff\r\nsettled the underlying lawsuit, the \"settlement alone does not preclude\r\nindemnification when there is . . . evidence to support a finding of . . . lack of fault\r\nby the indemnitee.\" 392 S.C. at 487-88, 709 S.E.2d at 75.\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no possibility, and certainly no evidence, that Inglese has no\r\nfault in causing the title insurance company's damages. The title insurance\r\ncompany's claim would not have arisen had Inglese satisfied his fiduciary duty to\r\nBeal and resolved the lien in writing. In addition to this duty to his client, Inglese\r\nhad a duty to the title insurance company. The company's lawsuit against Inglese\r\n\nwas based on the allegation that Inglese breached that duty—by failing to resolve\r\nthe lien in writing, by crossing out the representations that there were no pending\r\njudgments or liens against Beal, and by otherwise failing to disclose the judgment\r\nto the company. Inglese's decision to pay the title insurance company's claim\r\nunder these circumstances requires a finding that he cannot be \"exonerated from\r\nany liability for those damages,\" 392 S.C. at 485, 709 S.E.2d at 74, and thus that he\r\nwas at fault in causing the company's damages. Therefore, Inglese failed as a\r\nmatter of law to satisfy the second element of equitable indemnity.\r\n\r\nInglese argues, however, that if there actually was an oral agreement to resolve the\r\nlien, the factfinder could determine he was without fault and thus he met the\r\nsecond element. He argues summary judgment should not have been granted on\r\nthis element because there is a material issue of fact as to whether there was an oral\r\nagreement. We agree there is evidence in the record that Inglese reached an oral\r\nagreement to resolve the lien. We find, however, that the existence of this\r\nevidence does not create an issue of material fact.\r\n\r\nOur state's policy determination that a lawyer must supervise a real estate closing is\r\nbased on the lawyer's ability and responsibility to successfully prevent the very\r\nconsequences Inglese permitted to occur. One of the primary purposes of a real\r\nestate closing is to bring finality to the transaction. In Brazell v. Windsor, 384 S.C.\r\n512, 682 S.E.2d 824 (2009), our supreme court discussed the importance of this\r\nfinality, stating, \"Numerous legal documents are executed in a real estate\r\ntransaction and several entities involved in the transaction, including the buyer,\r\nseller, lender, mortgage company, and title insurance company, rely on the finality\r\nof the closing.\" 384 S.C. at 518, 682 S.E.2d at 827. A cloud on the title of the\r\nseller, such as the judgment lien in this case, and the risk that the cloud may pass to\r\nthe buyer, is one of the reasons this finality is so important. The real estate closing\r\nis the last opportunity for the parties to bring finality to this issue and prevent the\r\ncloud on the title from passing to the buyer.\r\n\r\nAs we have discussed, the responsibility to bring this important finality to the issue\r\nfalls on the lawyer retained to supervise the closing. If the closing is properly\r\nconducted, the lawyer enables finality and prevents future litigation. If the\r\nagreement Inglese claims he made with the judgment creditor did in fact exist,\r\nInglese should have documented the agreement in writing and made the writing\r\npart of the closing. Had Inglese performed this task, he would have prevented all\r\nthis from occurring. Inglese chose not to document the alleged agreement,\r\nhowever, and thus chose to rely on the hope that the judgment creditor would later\r\nagree to relinquish his interest in the judgment. This choice by Inglese is critical to\r\n\nour analysis of the second element—whether Inglese is without fault—because\r\nInglese's choice created the consequence he was retained to prevent. Inglese's\r\nchoice left Beal at risk of losing all the proceeds of the sale and left the buyer at\r\nrisk of having to take legal action to remove the cloud from his title. These risks\r\nare representative of those the supreme court had in mind when it stated in Matrix\r\nand Buyers Service that \"the presence of attorneys in real estate loan closings is for\r\nthe protection of the public and that 'protection of the public is of paramount\r\nconcern' in loan closings.\" Matrix, 394 S.C. at 140, 714 S.E.2d at 535 (quoting\r\nBuyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. at 434, 357 S.E.2d at 19).\r\n\r\nWe find that Inglese's failure to protect Beal and the buyer from these risks\r\nresolves the second element of Inglese's equitable indemnity claim as a matter of\r\nlaw. When a closing attorney representing the seller does not document in writing\r\nthe resolution of a judgment lien on his client's property as to which the attorney\r\nhas actual knowledge, but instead relies only on an oral agreement with the\r\njudgment creditor, the attorney does so at his own risk.2 When that risk\r\nmaterializes, as it did here, the possibility that the judgment creditor might later\r\nhave acknowledged an oral agreement to resolve the lien, or that such an\r\nagreement might have been proven in subsequent litigation, is not a material fact.\r\nWhat is important is that the lawyer had a fiduciary duty to bring finality to the\r\ntransaction, and failed. This failure cannot be excused, even if there was an oral\r\nagreement to resolve the lien. Thus, the lawyer is at fault in the transaction and\r\ncannot recover for equitable indemnity. As we stated in Meacher, \"[t]he most\r\nimportant requirement for the finding of equitable indemnity is that the party\r\nseeking to be indemnified is adjudged without fault and the indemnifying party is\r\nthe one at fault.\" 392 S.C. at 486, 709 S.E.2d at 74.\r\n\r\n             D.     Defenses\r\n\r\nInglese failed as a matter of law to establish any of the elements of either of his\r\ntheories of recovery against Beal. It is unnecessary, therefore, that we address\r\nBeal's defenses. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C.\r\n598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues when resolution of another issue disposes of the appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n2 This appeal does not present the question of whether Inglese's failure to obtain a\r\nwritten release of the judgment lien results in Inglese's liability to Beal as a matter\r\nof law. We address the consequences of Inglese's failure only in the context of his\r\nlawsuit against his own client for equitable indemnity.\r\n\n      III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe circuit court's granting of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\r\nI agree that summary judgment is proper as to Inglese's equitable indemnification\r\nclaim. However, I respectfully dissent as to the granting of summary judgment on\r\nInglese's unjust enrichment claim and would reverse as to that claim.3\r\n\r\nIn determining whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, an\r\nappellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. See Englert, Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc., 377\r\nS.C. 129, 134, 659 S.E.2d 496, 498 (2008). Here, as to the equitable\r\nindemnification claim, no disputed facts exist as to whether Inglese caused the loss\r\nto the title insurance company by permitting the property sale to close with the\r\njudgment lien still on the property.\r\n\r\nInglese claims he had an oral agreement with another lawyer to resolve the\r\njudgment lien. Courts are hesitant to resolve disputes between two lawyers. While\r\nnot applicable to this case, lawyers have been required in other contexts to reduce\r\ntheir agreements to a written document. See, e.g., Rule 43(k), SCRCP (\"No\r\nagreement between counsel affecting the proceedings in an action shall be binding\r\nunless reduced to the form of a consent order or written stipulation signed by\r\ncounsel and entered in the record, or unless made in open court and noted upon the\r\nrecord, or reduced to writing and signed by the parties and their counsel.\"). One\r\nreason for such a policy is that it deters lawyers from being pulled into disputes\r\notherwise between the clients of the lawyers.\r\n\r\nAll too often, Ronald Reagan's familiar quote comes to mind: \"Trust, but verify.\"\r\nInglese should have verified the resolution and discharge of the judgment lien prior\r\nto closing. While it is unfortunate that lawyers must often document agreements\r\nbetween themselves in writing, a lawyer should always remember the client's\r\ninterest must always be protected. Even if the oral agreement proved to be valid,\r\nthat agreement would have exposed the title insurance company to damages\r\n\r\n3 I refer to Inglese's unjust enrichment cause of action herein, although I would\r\nlabel it as a cause of action for restitution.\r\n\nbecause the property was sold with the judgment lien still on the property.\r\nConsequently, the record fails to establish a question as to whether Inglese is\r\nwithout fault, and the equitable indemnification claim must also fail. See Vermeer\r\nCarolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 60, 518 S.E.2d 301,\r\n305 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"Ordinarily, if one person is compelled to pay damages\r\nbecause of negligence imputed to him as the result of a tort committed by another,\r\nhe may maintain an action . . . for indemnity against the person whose wrong has\r\nthus been imputed to him. . . . This is subject to the proviso that no personal\r\nnegligence of his own has joined in causing the injury.\" (citation omitted)).4\r\nTherefore, I concur with the majority opinion that Beal is entitled to summary\r\njudgment on Inglese's equitable indemnification claim. See id. at 63, 518 S.E.2d at\r\n307 (\"The most important requirement for the finding of equitable indemnity is\r\nthat the party seeking to be indemnified is adjudged without fault and the\r\nindemnifying party is the one at fault.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nAs to Inglese's unjust enrichment claim, I would find that Beal is not entitled to\r\nsummary judgment on this claim because a question exists as to whether Beal\r\nreceived a benefit. While Inglese may be at fault in causing the title insurance\r\ncompany's damages, his fault does not necessarily preclude his claim for unjust\r\nenrichment. \"Restitution is an equitable remedy sought to prevent unjust\r\nenrichment.\" Campbell v. Robinson, 398 S.C. 12, 24, 726 S.E.2d 221, 228 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2012) (citations omitted). A party seeking to recover on the theory of\r\nrestitution must prove: \"(1) that he conferred a nongratuitous benefit on the\r\ndefendant; (2) that the defendant realized some value from the benefit; and (3) that\r\nit would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the\r\nplaintiff its value.\" Niggel Assocs. v. Polo's of N. Myrtle Beach, Inc., 296 S.C. 530,\r\n532, 374 S.E.2d 507, 509 (Ct. App. 1988) (citation omitted). As to the first\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Under South Carolina law, joint tortfeasors may not recover equitable indemnity.\r\nSee Vermeer, 336 S.C. at 64, 518 S.E.2d at 307. Because Inglese is at fault,\r\nInglese is unable to recover from Beal under this claim even if Beal is also at fault.\r\nSome jurisdictions recognize the doctrine of comparative indemnification when\r\nmore than one party is at fault and share liability. See Gem Developers v. Hallcraft\r\nHomes of San Diego, Inc., 261 Cal. Rptr. 626, 629 (Cal. Ct. App. 1989) (\"Under\r\nthe equitable indemnity doctrine, defendants are entitled to seek apportionment of\r\nloss between the wrongdoers in proportion to their relative culpability so there will\r\nbe equitable sharing of loss between multiple tortfeasors.\" (internal quotations\r\nomitted)). However, this issue was not raised on appeal.\r\n\nelement, the title insurance company settled the claim to remove the cloud on the\r\ntitle created by the judgment lien. The title insurance company made the payment\r\nthat released the lien; however, Inglese was ultimately liable for the payment to\r\nclear the title to Beal's property. Inglese paid for the title to be cleared on Beal's\r\nproperty. Additionally, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Beal\r\nhad knowledge of, or consented to, the oral agreement. While Beal did not\r\nexplicitly request Inglese to confer the benefit, an inference may be drawn that\r\nInglese could reasonably rely on Beal for repayment. See Campbell, 398 S.C. at\r\n24, 726 S.E.2d at 228 (finding a plaintiff confers a nongratuitous benefit when: (1)\r\nthe benefit is at the defendant's request, or (2) the plaintiff reasonably relies on the\r\ndefendant to pay for the benefit, and the defendant understands or ought to\r\nunderstand that the plaintiff expects compensation from him).\r\n\r\nAs to the second element, the record includes evidence that the judgment lien on\r\nBeal's property was absolved; this creates a genuine issue of material fact as to\r\nwhether Beal received a benefit. As to the third element, a fact-finder could find it\r\ninequitable for Beal, who was aware of the lien against him, to be free of the\r\noriginal judgment lien while requiring Inglese to bear the cost of resolving the\r\njudgment lien. At this stage of the proceedings, we merely decide if there is a\r\nfactual dispute warranting the claim to be determined at trial. Based on the\r\nforegoing, I would find Beal was not entitled to summary judgment on Inglese's\r\nunjust enrichment cause of action.5 See Englert, 377 S.C. at 134, 659 S.E.2d at\r\n498 (\"Summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of\r\nthe case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nThe next inquiry is whether Beal's defenses of unclean hands and the voluntary\r\npayment doctrine raised in his motion for summary judgment preclude recovery as\r\na matter of law at this stage of litigation. As to the doctrine of unclean hands, I\r\nwould find a factual dispute exists as to whether Inglese is barred from recovery\r\nunder this doctrine. While Inglese is at fault in causing the title insurance\r\ncompany's damages, a fact-finder could determine the alleged oral agreement\r\nbetween counsel existed. Moreover, there is a question of fact as to any\r\nknowledge of, or consent to, the oral agreement by Beal. Accordingly, a fact-\r\nfinder could find that based on the oral agreement, even though Inglese was at\r\nfault, he was not acting unfairly or with any misconduct towards Beal. See Arnold\r\n\r\n5 According to Inglese, he placed the net proceeds from the closing in escrow\r\npursuant to the alleged oral agreement. The record is not developed as to whether\r\nthe funds were placed in a trust account and continue to remain in any such\r\naccount.\r\n\nv. City of Spartanburg, 201 S.C. 523, 532, 23 S.E.2d 735, 738 (1943) (\"The\r\nexpression 'clean hands' means a clean record with respect to the transaction with\r\nthe defendants themselves and not with respect to others.\" (citation omitted)).\r\nFurthermore, a fact-finder could find that Beal was not prejudiced and actually\r\nbenefited from Inglese's conduct because the judgment lien on Beal's property was\r\nabsolved and Inglese was liable for the cost. See First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v.\r\nSoden, 333 S.C. 554, 568, 511 S.E.2d 372, 379 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"The doctrine of\r\nunclean hands precludes a plaintiff from recovering in equity if he acted unfairly in\r\na matter that is the subject of the litigation to the prejudice of the defendant.\"). On\r\nthe other hand, depending on the how the evidence is viewed, including any\r\nknowledge of or consent to the oral agreement by Beal, a fact-finder could\r\ndetermine that Inglese's conduct bars relief under the doctrine of unclean hands.\r\nBased upon these conflicting conclusions, I would find that Beal is not entitled to\r\nsummary judgment as a matter of law based upon the doctrine of unclean hands.\r\nSee Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C. 581, 585, 666 S.E.2d 901, 903 (2008) (noting even\r\nif the \"evidentiary facts are not disputed but the conclusions or inferences to be\r\ndrawn from them are, summary judgment should be denied\" (citation omitted)).6\r\n\r\nFinally, as an alternative, I would reverse and remand for specific findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law as to the matters raised. The trial court's order is a Form 4\r\norder that simply states: \"Defendant Carl H. Beal's motion for summary judgment\r\nis granted.\" Inglese's complaint sets forth claims for promissory estoppel, unjust\r\nenrichment, and equitable indemnification.7 In his motion for summary judgment,\r\nBeal argues the voluntary payment doctrine and the doctrine of unclean hands bar\r\nInglese's claims. Beal also contends that Inglese's claim for equitable\r\nindemnification fails as a matter of law because Inglese's own conduct caused his\r\ndamages. The trial court entered a summary order granting judgment without any\r\nfindings as to these issues, and Inglese requested the court make such findings in\r\n\r\n6 As to the voluntary payment defense, I would find that doctrine is inapplicable to\r\nthe facts of this case. See Moody v. Stem, 214 S.C. 45, 53, 51 S.E.2d 163, 165\r\n(1948) (finding the doctrine of voluntary payment provides that \"where one man\r\nvoluntarily pays money to another, it cannot be against conscience and right, that\r\nthe receiver should retain it\" (internal quotations omitted)).\r\n7 On appeal, Inglese does not challenge the trial court's grant of summary judgment\r\non his promissory estoppel claim. Therefore, the failure to appeal this finding\r\nrenders the issue abandoned. See Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d\r\n482, 484 (1993) (\"Failure to argue is an abandonment of the issue and precludes\r\nconsideration on appeal.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\nhis Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion. Thus, it is unclear whether the trial court\r\nspecifically ruled Inglese's causes of actions were deficient or whether Beal's\r\ndefenses raised in Beal's motion for summary judgment precluded recovery.\r\nBecause the trial court declined to make findings upon request, I would\r\nalternatively reverse and remand for such findings. See Bowen v. Lee Process Sys.\r\nCo., 342 S.C. 232, 241, 536 S.E.2d 86, 91 (Ct. App. 2000) (vacating the order\r\ngranting summary judgment and remanding the case to the trial court for \"a written\r\norder identifying the facts and accompanying legal analysis upon which it relied\").\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5124","title":"Penza v.

A mortgage from Pendleton Station and\r\nDiana L. Zeller, Trustee for the Diana L. Zeller Revocable Trust, to Penza and\r\nother parties2 secured the promissory note. The mortgage was dated August 4,\r\n2004, and recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds for Anderson County on\r\nOctober 24, 2004. The mortgage granted Penza a lien on real property described in\r\nthe body of the mortgage as 31.31 acres shown as Tract B on a plat entitled\r\nClosing Survey for Coastal Plains Development Company, LLC, dated August 12,\r\n2003, and citing TMS # 063-00-01-001 and 062-00-08-003. The document's pages\r\nwere numbered one through five. However, the document filed had six pages. The\r\nsixth page was entitled Schedule A. Schedule A described 31.31 acres shown as\r\nTract A also on the plat entitled Closing Survey for Coastal Plains Development\r\nCompany, LLC, and referencing TMS # 063-00-01-001 and 062-00-08-003.\r\n\r\nZeller had obtained Tract B from Coastal Plains Development in a deed dated\r\nAugust 29, 2003. Coastal Plains Development conveyed Tract A to Pendleton\r\nStation on August 10, 2004, and the deed was recorded October 25, 2004.3 Penza\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 William J. Cutchin was Pendleton Station's attorney. \n\r\n2 Several of these other parties never actually loaned Pendleton Station any money, \n\r\nand on May 27, 2007, Cutchin sent them a document for them to sign and return \n\r\nindicating their portion of the mortgage was satisfied. \n\r\n3 However, Cutchin testified in his deposition that Pendleton Station owned Tract \n\r\nA at the time the note and mortgage were executed to Penza. \n\r\n\ngave Pendleton Station two additional $250,000 checks, one on October 22, 2004,\r\nand the other on November 27, 2004.4\r\n\r\nOn October 25, 2005, Cutchin re-recorded the mortgage in the Office of Register\r\nof Deeds for Anderson County. This version of the mortgage did not include a\r\nSchedule A and contained the following language by Cutchin:\r\n\r\n            When the attached mortgage was sent to be recorded, a\r\n            \"Schedule A\" was accidentally and incorrectly attached\r\n            which described a tract of land which was NOT subject\r\n            to the mortgage. There was no reference to the\r\n            \"Schedule A\" in the body of the mortgage, and it was a\r\n            scribner's [sic] error that the \"Schedule A\" was originally\r\n            recorded as the 6th page at Book 06429, Page 00306.\r\n\r\n            The only tract of land under mortgage is that contained in\r\n            the body of the mortgage. This re-recording of the\r\n            mortgage now properly shows the land which is subject\r\n            to the mortgage.\r\n\r\nPenza was not notified of the re-recording. On the same day, Cutchin recorded a\r\nmortgage from Pendleton Station to the Bank securing Tract A in connection with\r\na $3 million development loan. In February of 2006, Pendleton Station fully\r\nrepaid Penza the $200,000 and interest.\r\n\r\nPendleton Station did not complete the development project and in March 2007,\r\nthe Bank accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure from Pendleton Station including\r\nTract A. Zeller deeded her interest in Tract B to the Bank as well.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2007, Penza filed a complaint seeking foreclosure of Tracts A and B\r\npursuant to the mortgage. The Bank filed an answer dated July 25, 2007, denying\r\nPenza was entitled to foreclosure. On November 12, 2008, the Bank filed a motion\r\nfor summary judgment, arguing there was no genuine issue of fact that Penza's\r\nmortgage does not secure any underlying debt and in the alternative, secures only\r\n\r\n4Penza contends this was an additional loan, secured by the same property as the\r\noriginal mortgage. The Bank contends this was an investment in the LLC. The\r\nmaster denied the Bank's summary judgment motion as to this allegation of Penza's\r\ncomplaint. This matter is not before us on appeal.\r\n\nTract B and not A. Following a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion\r\nwithout prejudice. The Bank filed a second motion for summary judgment dated\r\nNovember 16, 2009, contending discovery had produced additional evidence of\r\nfacts supporting the grounds for its first summary judgment motion. On November\r\n22, 2010, the case was referred to a master-in-equity, including the second\r\nsummary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nCutchin testified in his deposition that when he drafted the mortgage, he only\r\nintended for it to cover Tract B and the inclusion of Tract A was a mistake. Penza\r\ntestified in his deposition he did not know what property the mortgage\r\nencompassed. The master held a hearing on the summary judgment motion on\r\nOctober 19, 2011, and issued an order granting partial summary judgment. The\r\nmaster found a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Penza's\r\n$500,000 was secured by the mortgage. However, the master found there was no\r\nissue of genuine material fact as to the real property encumbered by the mortgage.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not\r\nrequiring the services of a fact finder. George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\nS.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\nmotion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In\r\ndetermining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences drawn from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581\r\nS.E.2d 161, 165 (2003). \"Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the\r\nopposing party must come forward with specific facts that show there is a genuine\r\nissue of fact remaining for trial.\" Sides v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 250,\r\n255, 607 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2004). \"[A]ssertions as to liability must be\r\nmore than mere bald allegations made by the non-moving party in order to create a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact.\" Jackson v. Bermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C. 11, 17,\r\n677 S.E.2d 612, 616 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\nI.   Partial Summary Judgment\r\n\r\nPenza argues the master erred in granting the Bank partial summary judgment\r\nbecause there was a question of fact as to whether Penza's first mortgage was\r\nintended to encumber Tract A in addition to Tract B. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"[T]he interpretation of a deed is an equitable matter.\" Eldridge v. City of\r\nGreenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998). \"The\r\nconstruction of a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of law for the court.\"\r\nHunt v. Forestry Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564, 568, 595 S.E.2d 846, 848 (Ct. App.\r\n2004). \"[T]he determination of whether language in a deed is ambiguous is a\r\nquestion of law. The language in a deed is ambiguous if it is reasonably\r\nsusceptible to more than one interpretation.\" Proctor v. Steedley, 398 S.C. 561,\r\n573 n.8, 730 S.E.2d 357, 363 n.8 (Ct. App. 2012) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n\"One of the first canons of construction of a deed is that the intention of the grantor\r\nmust be ascertained and effectuated if no settled rule of law is contravened.\"\r\nBennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 590, 635 S.E.2d 649, 655 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[O]nce a contract or agreement is\r\nbefore the court for interpretation, the main concern of the court is to give effect to\r\nthe intention of the parties.\" Williams v. Teran, Inc., 266 S.C. 55, 59, 221 S.E.2d\r\n526, 528 (1976). \"Moreover, in ascertaining [the grantor's] intention, the deed\r\nmust be construed as a whole and effect given to every part thereof, if such can be\r\ndone consistently with law.\" Bennett, 370 S.C. at 590, 635 S.E.2d at 655. When a\r\ndeed is unambiguous, any attempt to determine the grantor's intent when reserving\r\nthe easement must be limited to the deed itself and using extrinsic evidence to\r\ncontradict the plain language of the deed is improper. See Springob v. Farrar, 334\r\nS.C. 585, 590, 514 S.E.2d 135, 138 (Ct. App. 1999). Only \"[w]hen the agreement\r\nis ambiguous the court may take into consideration the circumstances surrounding\r\nits execution in determining the intent.\" Williams, 266 S.C. at 59, 221 S.E.2d at\r\n528.\r\n\r\nThe master erred in partially granting the Bank's motion for summary judgment.\r\nThe mortgage that was originally recorded and signed by Penza referenced both\r\nTracts A and B. When the mortgage was re-recorded a year later, Penza was not\r\ncontacted. Additionally, both Zellner and Pendleton Station signed the mortgage\r\neven though Tract B was solely owned by Zellner, while Tract A was owned by\r\nCoastal Plains Development and transferred to Pendleton Station six days after the\r\nexecution of the mortgage. The mortgage also references the same two tax map\r\n\n numbers in reference to both Tract A and Tract B. Therefore, viewing the\r\n evidence in the light most favorable to Penza, a question of fact remains as to\r\n whether the mortgage encumbered Tract A in addition to Tract B. The master's\r\n order finding Cutchin's statement was \"the most reliable evidence of what\r\n occurred\" and that Penza's evidence provided to demonstrate the mortgage\r\n encompassed both tracts \"is not convincing\" indicates the master did more than\r\n look for the existence of evidence to demonstrate an issue of material fact and\r\n instead weighed the evidence. Accordingly, we find the master erred in granting\r\n the Bank partial summary judgment.\r\n\r\n II.   Reformation of the Mortgage\r\n\r\n Penza asserts the master's order essentially reforms Penza's first mortgage so it\r\n does not encumber Tract A. Penza maintains this was error because equity did not\r\n permit the master to do this without Penza's consent. Our decision that the master\r\n erred in granting summary judgment because there are issues of material fact is\r\n dispositive. Thus, we need not address this issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\n of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\n appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior\r\n issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\nIII.   Additional Sustaining Ground\r\n\r\n The Bank contends we should affirm the master's decision because its having a\r\n right to rely on the re-recorded mortgage, which explicitly disclaims the mortgage\r\n encumbers or ever intended to encumber Tract A, is an additional sustaining\r\n ground.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\nOn April 23, 2009, a masked gunman robbed the Bank of America in Aiken of\r\n$12,000. Several months later, Martin was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia. When a\r\npolice officer stopped him, Martin gave a false name and date of birth. After\r\nconfirming his identity with a photograph, the officer arrested him and charged\r\nhim with giving false information to a law enforcement officer. Martin was later\r\ntransferred to South Carolina, where he was indicted for armed robbery and\r\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery.\r\n\r\nI.    Motion to Suppress\r\n\r\nImmediately prior to trial, Martin moved to suppress evidence of his arrest for\r\ngiving false information. First, he argued the evidence was of a previous\r\nconviction and would constitute improper character evidence under Rule 404 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Rules of Evidence. Second, he contended the false-information\r\nincident occurred nearly a year after the robbery, and he had no reason to believe\r\nthe Georgia authorities were seeking him in connection with the South Carolina\r\nrobbery. The trial court denied his motion but noted the Georgia authorities could\r\nnot testify Martin was convicted of giving false information to law enforcement.\r\n\r\nII.   Trial\r\n\r\nAt trial, the State presented evidence that Martin, Quinton Harmon, David Dixon,\r\nand Roosevelt Johnson had planned and executed the robbery. Harmon had\r\nscouted the bank, Dixon had acted as lookout, Martin had entered the bank and\r\ndemanded money, and Johnson had driven the getaway car.\r\n\r\nEyewitnesses testified bank employees and two customers were present when a\r\nman wearing a dark hoodie and a mask that covered his face entered the bank.\r\nWitnesses could not identify the man, who ran into the lobby pointing a gun and\r\nordered the employees and customers to get down on the floor. One employee\r\npulled the silent alarm and dialed 911. Another employee, watching from the\r\nparking lot as the man ran out of the bank, provided police with a description and\r\nthe license plate number of the getaway car.\r\n\r\nHarmon, Johnson, and Dixon testified they knew Martin as \"T-Money.\" All three\r\nmen admitted robbing the bank. According to the men, Martin proposed a robbery\r\nthe day before the incident, and they scouted possible targets the same evening.\r\nOn the day of the robbery, Johnson picked up the other three men in his red 2005\r\nMustang. They stopped at a local fast-food restaurant, where Martin obtained a\r\n\npair of gloves, then traveled to Dixon's home, where Dixon gave Martin a\r\npillowcase and white t-shirt.\r\n\r\nLater, the men drove to a car wash near the bank. Harmon went into the bank to\r\n\"scope it out\" and asked the teller questions about opening accounts. According to\r\nthe men, after Harmon returned to the car and delivered his report, Martin pulled\r\nblack pants and a black hooded jacket on over his other clothing and wrapped\r\nDixon's white t-shirt around his face. He carried a black handgun.1 Harmon,\r\nDixon, and Johnson waited in the car while Martin robbed the bank. When he\r\nreturned, Martin jumped into the car and told Johnson to drive.\r\n\r\nAs Johnson drove toward Augusta, Georgia, Martin stripped off the black clothing\r\nand handed $300 or $400 to each of the other men. Indicating he meant to board a\r\nbus for Atlanta, Martin directed Johnson to drive to the bus station in Augusta.\r\nHowever, Martin was unable to buy a ticket due to a power outage. The men\r\ndrove to the local mall, where Martin called a friend to pick him up. The other\r\nthree men left the mall in Johnson's car.\r\n\r\nAfter the police published a photograph of Harmon taken from the bank's security\r\ncamera shortly before the robbery, Harmon contacted them. He gave a statement\r\nthat led to his arrest and to the issuance of arrest warrants for Johnson, Dixon, and\r\nMartin. Later, Johnson named the same four men in his statement to the police.2\r\nOfficers identified Martin's grandmother and obtained from her Martin's full name,\r\ndate of birth, and physical description. An officer in Gwinnett County, Georgia,\r\nprovided them with a photograph of a person Johnson and Harmon confirmed was\r\nthe man they knew as T-Money.\r\n\r\nOfficer Christopher Poythress of the DeKalb County Police Department testified\r\nthat on April 13, 2010, he was sent to locate a wanted person at an apartment\r\ncomplex in Atlanta, Georgia. His dispatcher provided the name Anthony Martin, a\r\ndate of birth, and an address. Finding no one at home, Officer Poythress contacted\r\nthe leasing office and confirmed Martin stayed at the apartment. As the officer\r\nwas leaving the complex, he stopped a man fitting the description he received from\r\n\r\n1Jacob McKie testified he loaned Martin a small, black pellet gun on the morning\r\nof the robbery.\r\n2The police spoke with Johnson first, but in that initial discussion, Johnson\r\nclaimed to have been at the mall during the robbery.\r\n\nthe leasing agent. Officer Poythress recalled the man denied having any\r\nidentification but gave the name Troy Brown and a birthdate of January 15, 1985.\r\nThe man first claimed to live on the property but then stated he was there to visit\r\nhis sister. Later, after receiving a color photograph of Martin, Officer Poythress\r\nconfirmed Martin was the man he had stopped.3\r\n\r\nIn his defense, Martin presented testimony from his mother and grandmother.\r\nAccording to his grandmother, Martin lived with her in South Carolina until Easter\r\nSunday, which was April 12, 2009, when his mother took him back home to\r\nSnellville, Georgia. His mother recalled waking him up in Snellville on the day of\r\nthe robbery and dropping him off near a bus stop so he could look for work.\r\n\r\nIn its closing argument, the State summarized the testimony, noting Martin had\r\ngiven Officer Poythress \"a fake name [and a] fake date of birth and tried to mislead\r\nhim about what he was doing in that apartment complex.\" The State concluded its\r\nargument by capitalizing on Martin's departure for Atlanta:\r\n\r\n             The defense asked where did all of that money go?\r\n             Well[,] that money went to Atlanta, because T-Money\r\n             took the money and ran. He had his friend come pick\r\n             him up and take him to Atlanta. When the police tried to\r\n             approach him and tried to talk to him at that apartment\r\n             complex. He lied about his name. He lied about his date\r\n             of birth. He evaded law enforcement. He gave\r\n             misleading information. So now you have the\r\n             opportunity to play your part[,] and the [S]tate asks that\r\n             you go back into that room and deliberate and find this\r\n             defendant guilty.\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Martin of both offenses. He received concurrent sentences of\r\ntwenty years' imprisonment for armed robbery and five years' imprisonment for\r\ncriminal conspiracy. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 It is important to note that Officer Poythress never testified Martin was arrested\r\nfor giving false information or that he was convicted of that crime.\r\n\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound\r\nby the factual findings of the circuit court unless clearly erroneous. State v.\r\nWilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). \"An abuse of discretion\r\noccurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\ncontrolled by an error of law.\" State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262,\r\n265 (2006).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMartin asserts the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence that he gave\r\nOfficer Poythress false identifying information, because no nexus existed between\r\nthe false information and the bank robbery. We agree, but we find the error was\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, any guilty act, conduct, or statements on the part of the accused\r\nare admissible as some evidence of consciousness of guilt.\" State v. McDowell,\r\n266 S.C. 508, 515, 224 S.E.2d 889, 892 (1976). This general rule applies to\r\nevidence of particular acts, including flight. State v. Orozco, 392 S.C. 212, 218,\r\n708 S.E.2d 227, 230 (Ct. App. 2011), cert. granted (Oct. 17, 2012). Our supreme\r\ncourt has identified the \"critical factor to the admissibility of evidence of flight\" as\r\n\"whether the totality of the evidence creates an inference that the defendant had\r\nknowledge that he was being sought by the authorities . . . [and his] actions were\r\nmotivated as a result of his belief that police officers were aware of his\r\nwrongdoing and were seeking him for that purpose.\" State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201,\r\n209, 631 S.E.2d 262, 266 (2006). In addition, this court has held evidence of\r\n\"unexplained\" flight\r\n\r\n             is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is\r\n             not to be supposed that one who is innocent and\r\n             conscious of that fact would flee. However, we have\r\n             further noted that [t]he critical factor to the admissibility\r\n             of evidence of flight is whether the totality of the\r\n             evidence creates an inference that the defendant had\r\n             knowledge that he was being sought by the authorities.\r\n             Flight evidence is relevant when there is a nexus between\r\n             the flight and the offense charged. It is sufficient that\r\n             circumstances justify an inference that the accused's\r\n             actions were motivated as a result of his belief that police\r\n             officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking\r\n\n             him for that purpose. Where the circumstances fail to\r\n             show the necessary nexus between a defendant's flight\r\n             and the current offense for which he is on trial, the flight\r\n             evidence is not relevant and should not be admitted.\r\n\r\nOrozco, 392 S.C. at 220, 708 S.E.2d at 231 (citations and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). This court has also recognized that South Carolina's rule echoes the\r\nfederal rule:[T]he relevance of flight evidence is premised on a nexus\r\n             between the flight and the offense charged. See, e.g.,\r\n             United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 419-20 (4th Cir.\r\n             1981) (finding evidence of flight inadmissible where a\r\n             defendant flees \"after 'commencement of an\r\n             investigation' unrelated to the crime charged, or of which\r\n             the defendant was unaware\"); United States v. Foutz, 540\r\n             F.2d 733, 740 (4th Cir. 1976) (stating that evidence of\r\n             flight should be excluded where defendant flees while\r\n             being investigated for another crime).\r\n\r\nState v. Robinson, 360 S.C. 187, 195, 600 S.E.2d 100, 104 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\nDecisions concerning the admission of flight evidence are subject to a harmless\r\nerror analysis. Pagan, 369 S.C. at 212, 631 S.E.2d at 267. Generally, appellate\r\ncourts do not set aside a conviction based upon harmless error. Id. An error \"is\r\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict\r\nobtained. Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is\r\nharmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such\r\nthat no other rational conclusion can be reached.\" Id. (citation and internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nI.    Totality Test and Nexus Requirement\r\n\r\nThe State correctly distinguishes between evidence of flight, on the one hand, and\r\nthe evidence challenged in this appeal, which concerned Martin's dishonest\r\nanswers to Officer Poythress's questions. However, because flight is merely one\r\nform of evasive conduct, we find the totality test used to determine the\r\nadmissibility of flight evidence is equally useful in determining the admissibility of\r\nevidence of other types of evasive conduct.\r\n\nA court assessing evidence of flight must determine whether \"the totality of the\r\nevidence creates an inference that the defendant had knowledge that he was being\r\nsought by the authorities.\" Id. at 209, 631 S.E.2d at 266. This test requires the\r\nexistence of a nexus between the flight and the offense charged. See, e.g.,\r\nRobinson, 360 S.C. at 195, 600 S.E.2d at 104 (recognizing the nexus requirement).\r\nAn alternate explanation for the flight may affect the admissibility of the evidence.\r\nSee Orozco, 392 S.C. at 220, 708 S.E.2d at 231 (noting evidence of \"unexplained\"\r\nflight \"is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not to be\r\nsupposed that one who is innocent and conscious of that fact would flee\"). This\r\ntotality test and its components assist the trial court in determining the relevance of\r\nevidence of evasive conduct, as well as in weighing the probative value of that\r\nevidence against its prejudicial effect. See Rule 401, SCRE (\"'Relevant evidence'\r\nmeans evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than\r\nit would be without the evidence.\"); Rule 403, SCRE (\"Although relevant,\r\nevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice . . . .\").\r\n\r\nIn the federal courts, \"[t]he chain of inferences leading from evidence of flight to\r\nconsciousness of guilt must lead to consciousness of guilt of the crime charged.\"\r\nUnited States v. Porter, 821 F.2d 968, 976 (4th Cir. 1987). Moreover,\r\n\r\n             To establish this causal chain, there must be evidence\r\n             that the defendant fled or attempted to flee and that\r\n             supports inferences that (1) the defendant's flight was the\r\n             product of consciousness of guilt, and (2) his\r\n             consciousness of guilt was in relation to the crime with\r\n             which he was ultimately charged and on which the\r\n             evidence is offered.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Obi, 239 F.3d 662, 665 (4th Cir. 2001). An inference that guilty\r\nknowledge motivated the accused to flee \"would be completely unfounded where a\r\ndefendant fle[d] after commencement of an investigation unrelated to the crime\r\ncharged, or of which the defendant was unaware.\" Beahm, 664 F.2d at 419-20\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Beahm, the trial court instructed the jury it\r\ncould infer guilt from evidence of the accused's flight, which occurred three weeks\r\nafter the crime but on the same day the accused received a note from an FBI agent\r\nrequesting that the accused contact him. Id. at 416, 420. The appellate court found\r\n\nthe instruction to be error because \"[i]n essence, the jury was allowed to draw an\r\ninference of ultimate guilt from flight based upon an inference that defendant felt\r\nguilty after receiving a note from the FBI.\" Id. at 420. The appellate court held\r\nevidence must \"sturdily support[]\" each inference linking the accused's flight to the\r\noffense charged. Id. Nonetheless, it reversed based upon \"[t]he government's\r\nfailure to substantiate adequately the inference that [Beahm] was aware he was\r\nwanted for the crime.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAlthough the general rule covers \"any guilty act, conduct, or statements on the part\r\nof the accused,\" the body of law that has developed around this inference of a\r\nguilty conscience has primarily concerned flight. McDowell, 266 S.C. at 515, 224\r\nS.E.2d at 892. The rationale underlying the admissibility of flight evidence, that\r\n\"it is not to be supposed that one who is innocent and conscious of that fact would\r\nflee,\" applies to other forms of evasive conduct as well. See Orozco, 392 S.C. at\r\n220, 708 S.E.2d at 231. The courts should not suppose a person who knew he was\r\ninnocent but under suspicion would disguise himself, hide from the police, or lie to\r\nofficers investigating the crime of which he is suspected. Accordingly, we find the\r\ntest for determining the admissibility of evidence concerning flight also applies to\r\nevidence of evasive conduct.\r\n\r\nII.   Error\r\n\r\nUnder the totality test, the State failed to establish a nexus between the robbery of\r\nthe Bank of America in Aiken and Martin's deceitful answers. The robbery took\r\nplace in South Carolina on April 23, 2009. Nearly a year later, Officer Poythress,\r\nan officer for DeKalb County, Georgia, approached Martin at an apartment\r\ncomplex in Atlanta and asked him about his identity and his business at the\r\napartment complex. Although the officer was uniformed and drove a marked\r\npolice car, he did not indicate his reason for stopping Martin. Thus, Martin's\r\ndishonesty to Officer Poythress was both temporally and geographically remote\r\nfrom the robbery. No evidence indicated the police had previously contacted\r\nMartin, he had received a warning about the investigation, or Martin had made\r\nstatements to others about being sought for the robbery. As in Beahm, the State\r\nfailed to present evidence Martin knew the police suspected him of the Bank of\r\nAmerica robbery.\r\n\r\nMartin also argues that because he was on probation, he was entitled to an\r\ninference his evasive conduct was attributable to his efforts to avoid arrest for\r\nviolating his probation. We note that, while the State asserted at the suppression\r\n\nhearing that Martin skipped town without telling his probation officer and \"[d]id\r\nnot transfer it back to Atlanta,\" Martin did not make that argument as the basis for\r\nsuppressing evidence of his evasive conduct. Thus, he is not entitled to argue such\r\nan inference on appeal. See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196, 577 S.E.2d 445,\r\n448 (2003) (holding an appellant may not argue one ground to the trial court and\r\nanother ground on appeal). Notwithstanding, without an inference that Martin's\r\nguilty knowledge of the bank robbery led to his dishonesty with Officer Poythress,\r\nthe State failed to establish a nexus between the 2009 bank robbery and Martin's\r\n2010 lies to the police. Consequently, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of\r\nMartin's attempt to avoid arrest.\r\n\r\nIII.   Prejudice\r\n\r\nNonetheless, we find the trial court's admission of the challenged evidence was\r\nharmless. While it is true the eyewitnesses in the bank could not identify the\r\ngunman and no forensic evidence linked Martin to the robbery, the State presented\r\nample competent evidence of Martin's guilt. See Pagan, 369 S.C. at 212, 631\r\nS.E.2d at 267 (stating \"an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is\r\nharmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such\r\nthat no other rational conclusion can be reached\"). Harmon, Johnson, and Dixon\r\ntestified consistently that Martin had served as the mastermind and the gunman in\r\nthe robbery for which each of them faced a charge of bank robbery and a possible\r\nprison sentence of thirty years. Eyewitness descriptions of the gunman's attire and\r\npillowcase-style money bag comported with the co-conspirators' descriptions of the\r\nclothing and bag Martin carried on the day of the robbery. Furthermore, Jacob\r\nMcKie, a disinterested party, recalled loaning Martin a small, black pellet gun the\r\nnight before the robbery. In view of this evidence, Officer Poythress's testimony\r\nlikely had no effect on the jury's determination of guilt. Therefore, any error the\r\ntrial court committed in admitting the challenged evidence was harmless.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the test previously articulated for determining the admissibility of\r\nevidence of flight applies to evidence of other forms of evasive conduct. In\r\napplying this test to the evidence against Martin, we find the State failed to\r\nestablish a nexus between the April 2009 robbery of the Bank of America in Aiken\r\nand Martin's provision of false identifying information to a Georgia police officer\r\nthe following year. As a result, insufficient evidence was presented to support an\r\ninference Martin lied to the officer to avoid prosecution for the Bank of America\r\n\nrobbery. However, in view of the evidence presented of Martin's guilt, we find any\r\nerror in admitting this evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5126","title":"Chakrabarti v.

Bradley Hutto, of Williams & Williams, of\r\n            Orangeburg, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: In this negligence and inverse condemnation case, the City of\r\nOrangeburg (Orangeburg) appeals, arguing the trial court erred in: (1) concluding\r\nits demolition of Ajoy and Sukla Chakrabartis' house amounted to inverse\r\ncondemnation requiring payment of just compensation; (2) denying its motions for\r\na directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on the causes\r\nof action for gross negligence and sovereign immunity; and (3) awarding two\r\ndistinct damage amounts on the two causes of action. We affirm in part and\r\nreverse in part.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Chakrabartis purchased a fire-damaged house located in Orangeburg,\r\nSouth Carolina. Ultimately, Orangeburg determined the house to be a nuisance\r\nand condemned it under the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC),\r\nwhich Orangeburg adopted as its building maintenance code. Orangeburg\r\ndemolished the house in August 2005. On July 26, 2007, the Chakrabartis filed a\r\ncomplaint against Orangeburg, alleging negligence in condemning the house as a\r\nnuisance and demolishing it and seeking actual damages. In its answer,\r\nOrangeburg asserted fourteen defenses including: (1) collateral estoppel/res\r\njudicata; (2) waiver; (3) sole and comparative negligence of the Chakrabartis; and\r\n(4) immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Act). The\r\nChakrabartis filed an amended complaint, adding additional causes of action for\r\nwrongful condemnation, inverse condemnation, and trespass.1\r\n\r\nA trial was held October 5-7, 2011, with the issue of inverse condemnation being\r\ntried by the bench and all other causes of action, including the amount of damages,\r\nbeing decided by the jury. At the close of the Chakrabartis' case, Orangeburg\r\nmade motions for a directed verdict as to the negligence and inverse condemnation\r\ncauses of action, and as to its immunity under the Act. The court denied the\r\nmotions, finding there was sufficient evidence in the record to create a factual\r\nquestion for the jury to determine if Orangeburg was grossly negligent. At the\r\nclose of all evidence, the Chakrabartis moved to amend their pleadings to conform\r\nto the gross negligence standard and withdraw their cause of action for negligence\r\nwith no objection from Orangeburg. The court determined there was a\r\ncompensable taking, and the jury returned a verdict of gross negligence and\r\nawarded damages of $165,000 for negligence and $85,000 for just compensation.\r\nThe Chakrabartis moved post-trial to elect the negligence verdict of $165,000 and\r\npreserve their right under the inverse condemnation award in the event the\r\nnegligence award was reduced or set aside. Orangeburg filed a motion for JNOV,\r\nand in the alternative, for a new trial or new trial nisi remittitur, and for an order\r\nrequiring the Chakrabartis to elect a remedy. The court denied all of Orangeburg's\r\nmotions. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   The Chakrabartis withdrew their cause of action for trespass during the trial.\r\n\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, this court views the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d\r\n881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002). A directed verdict motion is properly granted if the\r\nevidence as a whole is susceptible of only one reasonable inference. Id. In ruling\r\non a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or\r\nnon-existence of evidence. Id. This court will only reverse the trial court when\r\nthere is no evidence to support the ruling below. Id.\r\n\r\nWhen considering a motion for JNOV, the trial court is concerned with the\r\nexistence of evidence, not its weight. Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc., 355 S.C. 316,\r\n320, 585 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2003). When reviewing the denial of a motion for\r\nJNOV, this court does not have the authority to decide credibility issues or to\r\nresolve conflicts in the testimony or the evidence, and the jury's verdict must be\r\nupheld unless no evidence reasonably supports the jury's findings. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Gross Negligence\r\n\r\nOrangeburg argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict\r\nand JNOV on the Chakrabartis' cause of action for gross negligence. We disagree.\r\n\r\nOrangeburg argues the Chakrabartis were not entitled to recovery on their gross\r\nnegligence cause of action because they presented no evidence of a breach by\r\nOrangeburg of any duty owed to the Chakrabartis in connection with Orangeburg's\r\ndecision to condemn and demolish their house. Orangeburg also argues the\r\nChakrabartis did not show its decision to demolish their house was inconsistent\r\nwith or violated its internal property maintenance code; thus, there was no\r\nevidence of gross negligence.\r\n\r\nA plaintiff must prove three elements to recover on a claim for negligence: (1) a\r\nduty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty by a\r\nnegligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach.\r\nCarolina Chloride, Inc. v. Richland Cnty., 394 S.C. 154, 163, 714 S.E.2d 869, 873\r\n(2011). \"If any of these elements is absent a negligence claim is not stated.\"\r\nSummers v. Harrison Constr., 298 S.C. 451, 455, 381 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App.\r\n1989). \"The court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes\r\na particular duty[, and] [i]f there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence\r\n\naction is entitled to a directed verdict.\" Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing &\r\nRegulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999).\r\n\r\n\"Ordinarily, under South Carolina's public duty doctrine, public officials are 'not\r\nliable to individuals for their negligence in discharging public duties as the duty is\r\nowed to the public at large rather than [to] anyone individually.'\" Tanner v.\r\nFlorence Cnty. Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 561, 521 S.E.2d 153, 158 (1999) (quoting\r\nJensen v. Anderson Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 199, 403 S.E.2d 615,\r\n617 (1991)). \"Generally, there is no common law duty to act. An affirmative legal\r\nduty, however, may be created by statute, contract relationship, status, property\r\ninterest, or some other special circumstance.\" Jensen, 304 S.C. at 199, 403 S.E.2d\r\nat 617.\r\n\r\nThe Act is the \"exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee\r\nof a governmental entity while acting within the scope of the employee's official\r\nduty.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-200 (2005). The Act provides that \"[t]he State, an\r\nagency, a political subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts\r\nin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like\r\ncircumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability and damages, and\r\nexemptions from liability and damages, contained herein.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-\r\n78-40 (2005). \"The burden of establishing a limitation upon liability or an\r\nexception to the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act is upon the\r\ngovernmental entity asserting it as an affirmative defense.\" Steinke, 336 S.C. at\r\n393, 520 S.E.2d at 152. \"Provisions establishing limitations upon and exemptions\r\nfrom liability of a governmental entity must be liberally construed in favor of\r\nlimiting liability.\" Id.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act, a governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from certain\r\nenumerated events including \"licensing powers or functions including, but not\r\nlimited to, the issuance, denial, suspension, renewal, or revocation of or failure or\r\nrefusal to issue, deny, suspend, renew, or revoke any permit, license, certificate,\r\napproval, registration, order, or similar authority except when the power or\r\nfunction is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-\r\n60(12) (2005). A potential licensee, licensee, or an injured third party may seek\r\nrelief under this exception. Steinke, 336 S.C. at 393, 520 S.E.2d at 152. \"Gross\r\nnegligence is the intentional conscious failure to do something which it is\r\nincumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not\r\nto do.\" Etheredge v. Richland Sch. Dist. One, 341 S.C. 307, 310, 534 S.E.2d 275,\r\n\n277 (2000). \"Gross negligence has also been defined as a relative term, and means\r\nthe absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.\" Id.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2003, Orangeburg Building Official Alan Ott sent the Chakrabartis a\r\nletter notifying them Orangeburg declared the house was unsafe, unfit for use, and\r\na public nuisance, and advised them of alternatives for future responsive action.\r\nOn April 7, 2003, the Chakrabartis applied for a building permit and identified the\r\nowner was acting as the contractor, which required they not rent or sell the house\r\nfor a period of two years. The same date, a handwritten permit application was\r\nfiled identifying Thomas Darby as the contractor and reflecting a scheduled\r\ncompletion date of June 2, 2003, for the exterior and August 1, 2003, for the\r\ninterior. However, the restoration work was not completed by those dates, and on\r\nMay 19, 2004, Ott again wrote to the Chakrabartis advising them of the deadlines\r\nand giving them a deadline of sixty days for the completion of the exterior repairs.\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 2004, Orangeburg Building Inspector David Epting wrote to the\r\nChakrabartis advising them they had thirty days from August 4, 2004, to complete\r\nthe exterior work and one-hundred-and-twenty days from August 4, 2004, to\r\ncomplete the interior work. On September 9, 2004, Orangeburg Building Inspector\r\nGene Nelson wrote the Chakrabartis, summarizing a meeting between the parties\r\nto address Orangeburg's concerns that the Chakrabartis did not intend to occupy\r\nthe house upon completion, and the initial building permit was based upon the\r\nassumption they would live in the house for at least two years. The letter advised\r\nthe Chakrabartis that Orangeburg had voided the April 7, 2003 building permit; the\r\nChakrabartis were to hire a licensed architect to evaluate the condition of the house\r\nand submit a plan for safety and code compliance; and Orangeburg would issue a\r\nnew building permit to the Chakrabartis.\r\n\r\nOrangeburg issued the Chakrabartis a new building permit on December 7, 2004,\r\nidentifying Michael Stroman as the contractor and specifying a June 10, 2005\r\ncompletion date. On June 13, 2005, Nelson wrote to the Chakrabartis advising\r\nthem that after an inspection of the house, he found it to be unsafe, unfit for human\r\nhabitation, and a public nuisance. The letter stated the Chakrabartis were in\r\nviolation of code section 110.1, and the residence must be demolished before July\r\n13, 2005. If the Chakrabartis did not demolish the house by July 13, 2005, the\r\nletter stated Orangeburg would demolish the house and bill the Chakrabartis for the\r\ncost of the work. The letter also provided \"any person affected by this decision\r\nshall have the right to appeal to the Construction Board of Appeals within [twenty]\r\ndays of service of the notice.\" The Chakrabartis did not appeal. On June 15, 2005,\r\n\nOrangeburg personally served the Chakrabartis with the notice of condemnation.\r\nThereafter, Orangeburg demolished the house in August 2005, which cost $12,025.\r\n\r\nSection 110 of the IPMC addresses demolition. IPMC Section 110.1 provides a\r\ncity may demolish an unsafe house as a nuisance if one of three requirements are\r\nmet: (1) the city deems it impossible to save (unreasonable to repair) and ordered\r\nits demolition; (2) the owner and the city both agree to demolish it; or (3) in cases\r\nwhere repairs have been undertaken, any substantial construction had ceased for\r\ntwo years. 2 Orangeburg asserts the evidence provides compelling proof that there\r\nwas \"cessation of normal construction\" of more than two years on the Chakrabartis'\r\nproperty. Orangeburg maintains there is little doubt the requirement was met,\r\nconsidering the history of the project from March 2003 to June 2005. It also\r\nasserts that because the Chakrabartis' work on the house was so sporadic,\r\nespecially between the summer 2004 inspection and the June 2005 decision to\r\ndemolish the house, it is questionable whether they ever began \"normal\r\nconstruction.\"\r\n\r\nOrangeburg asserts the testimony of Gene Nelson, Code Enforcement Officer for\r\nOrangeburg, and Jim Meggs, former attorney for the City of Columbia, supports its\r\nassertion that Orangeburg followed procedure in demolishing the Chakrabartis'\r\nhouse. Nelson testified he did not have to ask permission from the Chakrabartis\r\nbefore demolishing their house. He stated that when he finds a property in disarray\r\nor in a condition that is a danger to the city, he has the right to condemn it by\r\nnotifying the homeowners. He further testified the Chakrabartis had not done any\r\nwork on the house from the time he issued the second permit until he did the final\r\ncondemnation, and it was still in the same condition as when he first inspected it in\r\n2004. Meggs testified the June 13, 2005 demolition letter complied with section\r\n110 of the IPMC, contained all of the required elements, and was a good and\r\neffective notice under the code. He further stated that based on his review of all of\r\nthe documents in this case, Orangeburg complied in all respects with the\r\nrequirements of the IPMC in reaching the ultimate removal of the property. He\r\ntestified that based on the history in this case it did not seem there was ever normal\r\nconstruction as contemplated by the IPMC.\r\n\r\nThe Chakrabartis' second contractor, Johnnie Coulter, was hired in December\r\n2004. He testified he did work on the roof and ceilings; studded walls; put\r\n\r\n2 On appeal, Orangeburg only argues subsection (3) of IPMC Section 110.1. It\r\ndoes not argue subsections (1) or (2).\r\n\ninsulation in the walls; performed some electrical work; and installed some\r\nsheetrock. He further testified he was working on the house until Orangeburg\r\nbulldozed it. The Chakrabartis presented into evidence a check made out to\r\nCoulter for $5,000, dated August 19, 2005, that notes it was for the \"last payment\r\nof Middleton St. House.\" Nelson, Orangeburg's former code enforcement officer,\r\ntestified that when he inspected the house in August 2004, some sheetrock had\r\nbeen installed, which had not been approved by the city. He also testified that\r\nsome electrical work had been done between the time Orangeburg issued the\r\nsecond permit in December 2004 and the demolition in August 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Chakrabartis argued Orangeburg was grossly negligent in demolishing their\r\nhouse without waiting the requisite time, the cessation of normal construction for a\r\nperiod of more than two years after work began, as required by section 110.1 of the\r\nIPMC. In its order denying Orangeburg's post-trial motions, the trial court found\r\nOrangeburg issued a second building permit to the Chakrabartis six months prior to\r\ndemolishing their house, and Orangeburg produced no evidence of a date when\r\nsubstantial construction on the property had ceased for any significant period,\r\nmuch less the required two years. Therefore, the trial court determined\r\nOrangeburg did not follow the proper procedure in demolishing the Chakrabartis'\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nUnder any of the gross negligence definitions, we find the trial court properly\r\ndenied Orangeburg's motion for a directed verdict because, when the facts are\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the Chakrabartis, the record shows\r\nOrangeburg issued a second building permit to the Chakrabartis six months before\r\ndemolishing their house, and Orangeburg produced no evidence of a date when\r\nsubstantial construction on the property had ceased for any significant period,\r\nmuch less the required two years. Further, evidence was presented that the\r\nChakrabartis' contractor was doing work on the house until Orangeburg\r\ndemolished it. Therefore, evidence was presented that Orangeburg did not follow\r\nthe proper procedure in demolishing the Chakrabartis' house.\r\n\r\nWe also find the trial court properly denied Orangeburg's motion for JNOV\r\nbecause we find the evidence reasonably supports the jury's findings. See Curcio,\r\n355 S.C. at 320, 585 S.E.2d at 274 (providing that when reviewing the denial of a\r\nmotion for JNOV, this court does not have authority to decide credibility issues or\r\nto resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence, and the court must uphold the\r\njury's verdict unless no evidence reasonably supports the jury's findings).\r\n\nII.    Sovereign Immunity\r\n\r\nOrangeburg argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict\r\nand JNOV based on sovereign immunity. We disagree.\r\n\r\nOrangeburg asserts it is immune to liability pursuant to the following three\r\nsubsections of section 15-78-60 of the Act: (1) section 15-78-60(2) (governmental\r\nentity is not liable for a loss resulting from administrative action or inaction of a\r\nlegislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial nature); (2) section 15-78-60(4)\r\n(governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from adoption, enforcement,\r\nor compliance with any law or failure to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or\r\ninvalid, including, but not limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution,\r\nrule, regulation, or written policies); and (3) section 15-78-60(23) (governmental\r\nentity is not liable for a loss resulting from institution or prosecution of any judicial\r\nor administrative proceeding). S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-78-60(2), (4), (23) (2005).\r\n\r\nNone of these three exceptions contain a gross negligence standard. When an\r\nexception that contains the gross negligence standard applies to a case, the gross\r\nnegligence standard is read into any of the other applicable exceptions. See\r\nSteinke, 336 S.C. at 398, 520 S.E.2d at 155 (\"[T]he trial court often faces Tort\r\nClaims Act cases in which at least one of the asserted exceptions contains the gross\r\nnegligence standard while other asserted exceptions do not. We hold that when an\r\nexception containing the gross negligence standard applies, that same standard will\r\nbe read into any other applicable exception. Otherwise, portions of the Act would\r\nbe a nullity, which the Legislature could not have intended.\"). It would make no\r\nsense to conclude Orangeburg may be found grossly negligent in a licensing\r\ndecision, yet allow it to escape liability under one of these other exceptions.\r\nBecause we find Orangeburg may be liable if it was grossly negligent in its\r\nlicensing per section 15-78-60(12), and the trial court properly denied\r\nOrangeburg's motion for a directed verdict for gross negligence, we also find the\r\ncourt properly denied Orangeburg's motions for directed verdict based on sections\r\n15-78-60(2), (4), and (23).\r\n\r\nFurther, we find the trial court properly denied Orangeburg's motion for JNOV\r\nbased on these sections because we find the evidence reasonably supports the jury's\r\nfindings. See Curcio, 355 S.C. at 320, 585 S.E.2d at 274 (providing that when\r\nreviewing the denial of a motion for JNOV, this court does not have authority to\r\ndecide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence, and\r\n\nthe court must uphold the jury's verdict unless no evidence reasonably supports the\r\njury's findings).\r\n\r\nIII.   Waiver and Estoppel\r\n\r\nOrangeburg argues the Chakrabartis are barred from recovery in negligence by the\r\ndefenses of waiver and estoppel because they did not appeal from the June 13,\r\n2005 letter informing them they had twenty days from the date of the letter to\r\nappeal the decision to the Construction Board of Appeals.\r\n\r\nOrangeburg first raised the defenses of waiver and estoppel in its answer to the\r\nChakrabartis' amended complaint. During trial, Ajoy Chakrabarti conceded he did\r\nnot file an appeal. At the close of the Chakrabartis' case, Orangeburg made two\r\nmotions for directed verdict, at which time it did not argue waiver and estoppel.\r\nThe court did not rule on waiver and estoppel. Thereafter, the court charged the\r\njury with waiver and estoppel. Orangeburg did not take exception to the jury\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nOrangeburg then raised waiver and estoppel in its motion for JNOV, new trial, new\r\ntrial nisi remittitur, and for election of remedies, asserting the court erred in\r\ndenying its motion for directed verdict because of the Chakrabartis' noncompliance\r\nwith the appeal provision. In its order denying Orangeburg's post-trial motions, the\r\ncourt did not rule on waiver and estoppel. Orangeburg did not file a Rule 59(e),\r\nSCRCP motion. Therefore, because Orangeburg did not raise the issue of waiver\r\nand estoppel to the trial court in its directed verdict motion, we find the issue is not\r\npreserved for our review. See Scoggins v. McClellion, 321 S.C. 264, 267, 468\r\nS.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding an issue not raised in a directed verdict\r\nmotion will not be considered on appeal concerning the denial of the directed\r\nverdict); In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92-93, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (stating\r\nonly issues raised in a directed verdict motion can properly be raised in a JNOV\r\nmotion); Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546\r\n(2000) (\"It is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal,\r\nbut must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for\r\nappellate review.\").\r\n\r\nIV.    Inverse Condemnation\r\n\r\nOrangeburg argues the trial court erred in concluding its demolition of the\r\nChakrabartis' house amounted to inverse condemnation requiring payment of just\r\n\ncompensation. The Chakrabartis concede this issue in their brief. Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the $85,000 judgment on the inverse condemnation cause of action.\r\n\r\nV.    Damages\r\n\r\nOrangeburg argues the trial court erred in awarding two distinct damage amounts\r\non the two causes of action. The Chakrabartis concede the court erred in finding\r\nOrangeburg's demolition of their house amounted to inverse condemnation and\r\nabandon the $85,000 judgment on that cause of action. Therefore, we only address\r\nthe arguments relating to the $165,000 award for gross negligence.\r\n\r\nThe Chakrabartis assert the jury appropriately found they were entitled to $165,000\r\nin damages for their gross negligence cause of action. They argue they notified\r\nOrangeburg of their intended charge as to actual damages, and Orangeburg took no\r\nexception to the charge. The court instructed the jury on actual damages, and the\r\nChakrabartis assert the jury's award properly included all expenses associated with\r\nputting them as near as possible in the same position they were in before the\r\nincident occurred. See Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 312,\r\n594 S.E.2d 867, 874 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"The basic measure of actual damages is the\r\namount needed to compensate the plaintiff for the losses proximately caused by the\r\ndefendant's wrong so that the plaintiff will be in the same position he would have\r\nbeen in if there had been no wrongful injury.\").\r\n\r\nThe Chakrabartis presented evidence in support of their damages. Sukla\r\nChakrabarti testified they purchased the house for $35,000; paid their contractor,\r\nDarby, $40,000; and paid another contractor, Johnnie Coulter, more than $100,000.\r\nShe testified that in her opinion, the fair market value of the house was between\r\n$160,000 and $170,000. See Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 92, 561 S.E.2d 610,\r\n614 (Ct. App. 2002) (\"As a general principle, a landowner, who is familiar with her\r\nproperty and its value, is allowed to give her estimate as to the value of the land\r\nand damages thereto, even though she is not an expert.\"). The Chakrabartis\r\npresented into evidence without objection checks written to Coulter totaling\r\n$106,476.55, and Coulter testified his contract with the Chakrabartis was for\r\n$150,000 and there was about $30,000 worth of work left. They presented a check\r\nwritten to Darby for $5,000. Darby testified the Chakrabartis paid him between\r\n$35,000 and $40,000. Ajoy Chakrabarti also testified they paid Darby $40,000.\r\nThe deed for the house shows a $35,000 purchase price. Therefore, we find the\r\njury's award of $165,000 was within reason and not disproportionate based on the\r\nevidence presented to them. See Austin, 358 S.C. at 311, 594 S.E.2d at 873\r\n\n(providing this court's task in reviewing a damages award is not to weigh the\r\nevidence, but to determine if there is any evidence to support the damages award);\r\nHutson v.

Wright, M.D. asked about Gibson's\r\nsocial security benefits, and (3) excluding as hearsay Gibson's questions to Dr.\r\nWright about another doctor's deposition. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Dr. Wright performed heart bypass surgery on Gibson, placing four\r\ncardiac wires in him. A few days after surgery, Dr. Wright removed two of the\r\nwires from Gibson but left in the remaining two wires. Gibson had problems with\r\nhis wounds healing, and Dr. Wright referred him to Dr. James Wallace, a plastic\r\nsurgeon. About five years later, after Gibson continued to have problems, Dr.\r\nWallace performed surgery on Gibson to remove any infection. He also removed\r\nthe two remaining wires with Dr. Wright's assistance.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gibson filed a complaint, alleging Dr. Wright was negligent in failing to\r\n(1) remove cardiac wires from Gibson despite having claimed to do so, (2) x-ray or\r\ndiagnose the retained wires in a timely manner, (3) provide prompt and proper\r\nmedical treatment to Gibson, (4) inform Gibson of the danger of leaving retained\r\npacing wires in his chest cavity, and (5) treat Gibson in a reasonable amount of\r\ntime so as to avoid further injury and damage. Prior to trial, Gibson filed a motion\r\nin limine requesting Dr. Wright not mention any collateral source such as\r\ninsurance, social security disability, and workers' compensation. During Dr.\r\nWright's cross-examination of Gibson, Dr. Wright asked him if he was receiving\r\npolice officer's and social security disability. Gibson objected and moved for a\r\nmistrial. Following a lengthy discussion on the matter, the trial court denied\r\nGibson's motion for a mistrial but gave the jury a curative instruction.\r\n\r\nLater during trial, Gibson objected to Dr. Wright's using summaries of evidence,\r\nwhich were timelines, as PowerPoint slides to aid his examination of witnesses.\r\nGibson argued he had not received enough time to review all of the slides and of\r\nthe ones he had reviewed, many contained mistakes or were not objective. The\r\nparties debated the matter, and the trial court ultimately allowed Dr. Wright to use\r\nthe slides, excluding some of the slides and allowing others. The trial court\r\nallowed Gibson some time to review the slides, although less time than he had\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nDuring Dr. Wright's testimony, Gibson attempted to question him about a\r\ndeposition Dr. Wallace gave regarding whether Dr. Wallace knew the wires had\r\nnot been removed. Dr. Wright objected, arguing it was hearsay. After extensive\r\n\narguments by both sides, the trial court granted the motion to exclude the\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conclusion of testimony, the jury found in favor of Dr. Wright.\r\nGibson filed post-trial motions alleging the trial court erred in allowing the\r\nsummaries to be used, failing to grant a mistrial after Dr. Wright violated the\r\nmotion in limine agreement, and not allowing Gibson to introduce Dr. Wallace's\r\ndeposition in cross-examining Dr. Wright. The trial court denied the motions.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nI.   EVIDENTIARY SUMMARIES\r\n\r\nGibson argues the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Wright to present inaccurate\r\nsummaries to the jury based on documents not produced to Gibson until days prior\r\nto trial, thus violating Rule 1006, SCRE. We disagree.\r\n\r\n             Demonstrative evidence includes items such as a\r\n             photograph, chart, diagram, or video animation that\r\n             explains or summarizes other evidence and testimony.\r\n             Such evidence has secondary relevance to the issues at\r\n             hand; it is not directly relevant, but must rely on other\r\n             material testimony for relevance. Demonstrative\r\n             evidence is distinguishable from exhibits that comprise\r\n             \"real\" or substantive evidence, such as the actual murder\r\n             weapon or a written document containing allegedly\r\n             defamatory statements.\r\n\r\nClark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 383, 529 S.E.2d 528, 535 (2000).\r\n\r\n             The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or\r\n             photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in\r\n             court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary,\r\n             or calculation, provided the underlying data are\r\n             admissible into evidence. The originals, or duplicates,\r\n             shall be made available for examination or copying, or\r\n             both, by other parties at reasonable time and place. The\r\n             court may order that they be produced in court.\r\n\r\nRule 1006, SCRE (emphasis added).\r\n\n\"[T]he standard for merely showing or exhibiting demonstrative evidence . . .\r\nwould not be higher than the standard for actually admitting demonstrative\r\nevidence.\" Davis v. Traylor, 340 S.C. 150, 156-57, 530 S.E.2d 385, 388 (Ct. App.\r\n2000). \"The trial court has broad discretion in the admission or rejection of\r\nevidence and will not be overturned unless it abuses that discretion.\" Id. at 157,\r\n530 S.E.2d at 388. \"To warrant a reversal based on the admission of evidence, the\r\nappellant must show both error and resulting prejudice.\" Conway v. Charleston\r\nLincoln Mercury Inc., 363 S.C. 301, 307, 609 S.E.2d 838, 842 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\n\"[C]ounsel may use a blackboard during jury argument to illustrate points that are\r\nproperly arguable or to bring to the jury's attention facts or figures properly\r\nrevealed by the evidence.\" Edwards v. Lawton, 244 S.C. 276, 277, 136 S.E.2d\r\n708, 708 (1964).\r\n\r\n            There is no impropriety in counsel's use of a blackboard,\r\n            during his argument to the jury, for the purpose of fairly\r\n            illustrating points that are properly arguable.\r\n            Calculations made, or diagrams drawn, thereon are of\r\n            course not evidence. Like statements of counsel in oral\r\n            argument, they should have reasonable foundation in the\r\n            evidence or in inferences fairly arguable from the\r\n            evidence. Just as oral argument may be abused, so may\r\n            such visual argument; and its abuse may be so flagrant as\r\n            to require a new trial. Control of the arguments of\r\n            counsel, with regard to the use of such visual aids, as\r\n            with regard to oral statements, rests in the sound\r\n            discretion of the trial judge.\r\n\r\nId. at 277-78, 136 S.E.2d at 708-09 (citations and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\nIn one of the federal cases to which Gibson cites, the party who sought to introduce\r\nsummary exhibits as evidence under Rule 1006, FRE, appealed the trial court's\r\ndenial of the introduction of the evidence. Air Safety, Inc. v. Roman Catholic\r\nArchbishop of Boston, 94 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1996). The trial court did not allow\r\nthe evidence because the party had not brought the documents from which the\r\nsummaries were drawn and the opposing party had not seen the documents, despite\r\nhaving access to the documents. Id. at 7-8. The opposing party contended the\r\n\nparty introducing the exhibits had previously only provided \"skeleton exhibits\" and\r\nhad not identified them as summaries until the final pretrial conference. Id. at 7-8\r\n& 7 n.15. The following day, opposing counsel requested the underlying\r\ndocuments. Id. at 7 n.15. Prior to that, the opposing party had signed two pretrial\r\nmemoranda without noting a problem with the exhibits. Id. at 7-8. Based on that,\r\nthe party believed the opposing party had no problem with the exhibits and did not\r\nbring the documents to town for the trial. Id. at 8. The court also noted the trial\r\n\"court allowed [the party] to use the exhibits as chalks[2], and they were relied on\r\nheavily during the testimony of its damages expert. The expert . . . testified to the\r\nspecific amounts contained in the summaries while the jury was able to peruse the\r\nchalks.\" Id.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Wright sought to use a timeline while cross-examining Gibson, Gibson\r\nobjected. Dr. Wright stated he wanted to use the timeline to\r\n\r\n             save time and put it in the most expeditious and the best\r\n             way for the jury to understand it is that I'm taking records\r\n             that have been provided to the other side that has some\r\n             reference, either to an instruction for noncompliance or\r\n             either a failure to comply with the doctor's orders. We\r\n             have taken that and put it on a timeline so we could play\r\n             it to the jury in the quickest and the most, uh, and the\r\n             most easiest form for them to understand for the\r\n             convenience.\r\n\r\nGibson stated he had not received the final notebook of documents Dr. Wright\r\nintended to use at trial until the Friday prior to the trial. Dr. Wright countered that\r\nthe documents had always been available for Gibson's review. Gibson informed\r\nthe court as to which records he had objections in regards to the timeline. He\r\nargued some of them were subjective. Additionally, he argued others should not\r\nbe allowed because they were already in evidence or were cumulative. He also\r\nargued some were not relevant. The trial court ruled on the objections, sustaining\r\nsome of them and overruling others. The trial court found some of Gibson's issues\r\nwith the documents went to the weight of the document. Gibson also raised an\r\nissue with Dr. Wright only using an excerpt, instead of the whole document.\r\nGibson argued he could not read much of the document apart from the portion Dr.\r\n\r\n2\"Chalks\" is a term used to refer to demonstrative jury aids. See United States v.\r\nMilkiewicz, 470 F.3d 390, 394 (1st Cir. 2006).\r\n\nWright was using. In response, the trial court stated, \"That's a different battle than\r\nthe one you told me you are wanting to fight right now.\" The trial court further\r\nstated:      I'm looking at this from the point of view of whether or\r\n             not these excerpts ought to be able to be put up on that\r\n             slide and shown to the jury. In order for them to do that,\r\n             they have to be in evidence already or what we've come\r\n             to now is they are going to have to be subject to some\r\n             kind of vetting by you because of the number of records,\r\n             and just to be fair to you, to give you the opportunity to\r\n             look through each one and make objections because you\r\n             agreed only to their authentication, you didn't agree to\r\n             their admissibility. But what is not really before me is\r\n             records that he's not going to use but you want to exclude\r\n             [them] based on the fact that you can't read them.\r\n\r\nThe court acknowledged it could not read the handwriting either, and then asked\r\nGibson how the documents could prejudice him if they were not legible.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Gibson argued information Dr. Wright was showing\r\nthrough the PowerPoint presentation was inaccurate and did not contain the full\r\nrecord. He argued \"words have been added, words have been interpreted,\r\nreferences and inferences have been [remainder of sentence omitted from the\r\nrecord.]\" Gibson argued that Dr. Wright was being allowed to fabricate the record\r\nby having slides that only displayed parts of a document. The trial court found\r\nGibson could challenge Dr. Wright's interpretation on cross-examination. The trial\r\ncourt asked Gibson why he could not put in the record himself if he believed it was\r\nan inaccurate translation and let the jury decide. Gibson argued if the timeline was\r\nseen by and presented to the jury, then it became evidence.\r\n\r\nGibson argued it had taken him five hours to read ten pages of the slides. Dr.\r\nWright stated the documents the PowerPoint slides were based on were in\r\nevidence. The court questioned Gibson on the difference between the PowerPoint\r\nand a chalkboard. Gibson responded that an exact quote would not be a problem\r\nbut that an interpretation would be. The court countered it would be the opposing\r\nattorney's role to point that out to the jury. Gibson asked for a recess for a day to\r\nreview the remainder of the slides because it would take him fifteen hours to\r\n\nexamine the ninety slides. Dr. Wright informed the court he had subpoenaed an\r\nexpert witness who was not available for much longer.\r\n\r\nThe court stated it would give Gibson ample time to review the documents and\r\nafter they had finished with two witnesses, court would resume in the morning.\r\nGibson indicated he could not be prepared on the documents by the following\r\nmorning. He requested the court give him until Monday to prepare. He said he\r\nhad fifty-three slides to check, corresponding to 180 pages. The court asked\r\nGibson if he would need the additional time to prepare if Dr. Wright were not\r\nusing the PowerPoint and Gibson responded that he would not. The court stated it\r\ndid not understand the difference because the slides would not be in evidence, and\r\nit would instruct the jury accordingly. Gibson informed the court the slides would\r\nhave an enormous visual impact on the jury.\r\n\r\nDr. Wright informed the court he was already keeping Dr. Peter Smith, Chief of\r\nCardiothoracic Surgery at Duke University, over one night. The court said it was\r\nthinking of adjourning court until Monday morning. Dr. Wright informed the\r\ncourt that he did not know if he could get Dr. Smith back to court on Monday. The\r\ntrial court was bothered Gibson received the materials on Friday and did not raise\r\nan objection until the following Wednesday, but it was also bothered by how small\r\nthe PowerPoint was that he was delivered. Dr. Wright stated that if the trial\r\ncontinued at noon the following day, he could still present his witness. Gibson\r\ninformed the court that would not be enough time for him to get through his\r\npreparation on the slides. The court ruled it would allow Dr. Wright to present Dr.\r\nSmith as a witness, using the PowerPoint presentation, the following day with\r\ncourt beginning at noon. Court ended for the day around 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nWhen court began the next day, Gibson informed the court Dr. Wright told him\r\nthat morning the PowerPoint slides had been revised. Gibson stated that many of\r\nthe slides with the very small print were missing from the bigger revised slides.\r\nDr. Wright informed the court he did not add any slides, removed slides he thought\r\nmight cause controversy, corrected any mistakes he noticed, and cut the number of\r\nslides in half. Gibson raised objections to specific slides, arguing material was\r\nincluded on the slides that was not included in what was given to him before trial.\r\nDr. Wright countered that he was not going to introduce those specific slides. Dr.\r\nWright informed the court he only had six pages he wished to reference and maybe\r\nthey could just go through those pages. As Dr. Wright informed the court of the\r\npages, Gibson made his objections to those pages. The court overruled some,\r\nsustained others, and found many of Gibson's issues went to the weight of the\r\n\nslide. Dr. Wright then presented Dr. Smith as a witness. After a weekend long\r\nbreak, trial resumed the following Monday. Later, at the beginning of Dr. Wright's\r\ntestimony, the trial court instructed the jury:\r\n\r\n             I told you that evidence consists of two things, first is\r\n             witness testimony and the second is exhibits. Uh, you're\r\n             about to see, as I understand it, some PowerPoint slides.\r\n             These PowerPoint slides are not evidence. They are not\r\n             exhibits. They're certainly not witnesses. They are\r\n             simply a device or aid the lawyer's using to display or\r\n             highlight portions of the evidence.\r\n\r\n             You're instructed that the only person's recollection and\r\n             interpretation of the evidence that counts [i]s yours. The\r\n             PowerPoint slides or other demonstrative aid that may be\r\n             used in this trial that are prepared by a party are subject\r\n             to whatever interpretation you feel appropriate based on\r\n             your independent view of the evidence. It is for you to\r\n             decide whether the slides correctly and accurately present\r\n             the information set for in the exhibits upon which they\r\n             are based. If the actual underlying evidence or your\r\n             interpretation of it differs from what is displayed on the\r\n             slide, the actual evidence or your interpretation controls.\r\n             In any event, you are not considering the slides as\r\n             independent evidence.\r\n\r\nThe record contains Gibson's objections to specific slides. The trial court sustained\r\nsome of the objections and overruled others. In Gibson's appellate brief, he\r\nreferences some of these objections. However, he argues the trial court erred in\r\nallowing Dr. Wright to use the slides at all. The slides themselves were not\r\nadmitted as evidence. The trial court heard Gibson's objections to each slide. The\r\ntrial court also gave Gibson additional time to review the slides. Accordingly, the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Wright to use the slides.\r\nFurther, Gibson does not identify any slides or errors on the timeline to which he\r\nwould have objected at trial if he had more time to examine them. Therefore, even\r\nif the trial court's allowing the slides was in error, Gibson has not demonstrated\r\nhow he was prejudiced by not receiving as much time as he requested.\r\n\r\nII.   MISTRIAL\r\n\nGibson asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on\r\nDr. Wright's violation of the motion in limine excluding social security disability,\r\nworkers' compensation, and insurance. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"A litigant cannot complain of prejudice by reason of an issue he has placed before\r\nthe court.\" Frazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 104, 603 S.E.2d 587, 592 (2004).\r\nThe door-opening doctrine applies in both criminal and civil cases. Floyd v. Floyd,\r\n365 S.C. 56, 92, 615 S.E.2d 465, 484 (Ct. App. 2005), overturned on other\r\ngrounds by 2008 S.C. Acts 211, § 1 (adding section 62-1-110 to the South Carolina\r\nCode, providing communications between a lawyer and a fiduciary are subject to\r\nthe attorney-client privilege unless waived by the fiduciary, even if fiduciary funds\r\nwere used to compensate the lawyer).\r\n\r\n             The primary purpose for the rule is that of fairness and\r\n             completeness of the information for making the decision.\r\n             If a party chooses to forego the protection of a rule by\r\n             introducing evidence the opposing party would not be\r\n             permitted to go into, then it is unfair not to allow the\r\n             opposing party to go into the matter and provide more\r\n             information to the fact-finder.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Danny R. Collins, South Carolina Evidence 2.9 (2d ed. 2000)).\r\n\r\n\"Whether a motion for mistrial should be granted is within the trial judge's sound\r\ndiscretion, and the trial judge[']s ruling will not be disturbed unless an abuse of\r\ndiscretion is shown.\" Frazier, 361 S.C. at 104, 603 S.E.2d at 592.\r\n\r\n             When objection is timely made to improper remarks of\r\n             counsel, the judge should rule on the objection, give a\r\n             curative charge to the jury, and instruct offending counsel\r\n             to desist from improper remarks. If the judge takes these\r\n             steps, and the initial objecting party is not satisfied with\r\n             the instruction, a further objection and a request for a\r\n             further instruction should be made at that time. If the\r\n             objecting party fails to make this additional objection, the\r\n             asserted misconduct of counsel is not preserved for\r\n             review on appeal.\r\n\nMcElveen v.

Davis, 257\r\nS.C. 443, 186 S.E.2d 247 (1972) (tortfeasor's liability for damages not reduced by\r\nvalue of gratuitous repairs)). \"The only requirement for qualification as a collateral\r\nsource is that the source be 'wholly independent of the wrongdoer.'\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn presenting his motion in limine to the court, Gibson stated:\r\n\r\n             The motion in limine, Your Honor, is standard. It's really\r\n             aimed towards collateral source. It will be difficult for\r\n             both parties to avoid that in references. I know that [Dr.\r\n             Wright] is not going to do it intentionally. We're sure not\r\n             going to try to do it intentionally. If it comes in, you\r\n             know, it's one of those no harm, no foul things, but I\r\n             wanted to have the motion in there just in case some\r\n             witness get[s] on there and really tried to enunciate the\r\n             collateral source. So if [Dr. Wright] could tell his\r\n             witnesses not to talk about insurance, and I'll tell my\r\n             witnesses not to talk about insurance, Social Security\r\n             disability, Worker's Compensation and all that.\r\n\r\nThe trial court responded, \"Okay.\" Dr. Wright agreed and stated: \"As long as it\r\ndoesn't come up -- as long as it doesn't become an issue. I got [sic] no intentions of\r\nbringing it up.\" The court then stated, \"All right.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Dr. Wright's cross-examination of Gibson, Dr. Wright asked, \"And that\r\nyou, in fact, told [the social worker] at that time you had no financial problems?\"\r\n\nand Gibson responded, \"I don't remember that.\" Dr. Wright then asked \"But you\r\ntalked about your financial problems, you are on police disability?\", and he\r\nanswered, \"Yes.\" Dr. Wright continued, \"And Social Security disability?\". Gibson\r\nobjected, and the trial court took up the matter outside the jury's presence. Gibson\r\nmoved for a mistrial, stating:\r\n\r\n               This question was not something that he volunteered.\r\n               This is something that [Dr. Wright] spit out in complete\r\n               violation of the Court's ruling on our motion in limine\r\n               which specifically address[ed] those very questions. He\r\n               just blurted it out. It's out in front of the jury now. It's a\r\n               collateral source. It's clearly inadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe court found:\r\n\r\n               My memory of the motion in limine was that y'all made\r\n               it, uh, and both sides, uh, acknowledged that it was going\r\n               to be hard to avoid some possible issue with collateral\r\n               source because of this. I don't remember an exact ruling.\r\n               But if I did make a ruling, I stand corrected.\r\n\r\nThe court made Gibson's written motion in limine Court's Exhibit 3.3\r\n\r\nDr. Wright argued he had to ask about Gibson's disability income because Gibson\r\nhad continued to represent to the jury he had no income. Dr. Wright also argued\r\nhis questions did not refer to a collateral source because it was police disability and\r\nsocial security benefits for an injury to Gibson's arm. Gibson responded he would\r\nnow have to present evidence of the source and amounts of money that Gibson\r\nclaimed was stolen from him by his caregiver. Dr. Wright stated Gibson had\r\nalready presented testimony about his caregiver stealing his money.\r\n\r\nThe trial court stated, \"I don't understand why you say it's collateral source. . . .\r\n[N]obody's going to show that your damages were -- should be reduced by some\r\npayment he received.\" The court noted Gibson receives police disability and social\r\nsecurity benefits regardless of his injuries here. The trial court found \"the\r\nreference by itself is not enough to warrant a mistrial. . . . I can instruct the jury to\r\ndisregard, uh, the reference. I'll be glad to consider any curative instruction\r\n\r\n3   The exhibit is not included in the record on appeal.\r\n\n[Gibson] wishes to propose.\" Gibson said it took exception to the court's analysis.\r\nAfter further discussion, the court stated it was willing to give a curative\r\ninstruction but understood if Gibson did not want one. Gibson asked the court to\r\nhear the instruction and asked to draft a curative instruction for the court's\r\nconsideration. After the court gave him some time to craft one, he stated, \"I just\r\naccept whatever curative instruction the Court wants to give.\"\r\n\r\nThe court instructed the jury:\r\n\r\n             [Y]ou will recall that when we started the case, I told you\r\n             that it's your job to determine the facts of this case. You\r\n             remember that I told you that you have to determine the\r\n             facts from the evidence and not take into account\r\n             anything that is not evidence.\r\n\r\n             There was, uh, shortly before we broke, a reference to,\r\n             uh, Social Security and, I believe, disability. That has\r\n             nothing to do with the claims involved in this case. It\r\n             should not have been referenced. It's not part of the\r\n             evidence in this case. It's been stricken from the record.\r\n             You are not to take it into account or give it any weight\r\n             whatsoever, discuss it, let it cross your mind or take it\r\n             into consideration in any manner. I repeat to you and\r\n             emphasize to you, under your oath, you are not to take\r\n             that question into account, that reference into account.\r\n             It's no longer part of the evidence of record in this case.\r\n\r\nThe parties' agreement at the start of trial on the motion in limine was not very\r\nconcrete. Dr. Wright agreed he would try to stay away from the matter if it did not\r\nbecome an issue. Gibson acknowledged it would be difficult to avoid mentioning\r\nit. The mention of the matter was very short. Further, the mention did not violate\r\nthe collateral source rule because it was regarding an unrelated injury. Therefore,\r\nthe mention of disability was minor and any prejudice was cured by the trial court's\r\ncurative instruction. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\ndenying the motion for a mistrial.\r\n\r\nIII.   DEPOSITION\r\n\nGibson maintains the trial court erred by excluding as hearsay Gibson's cross-\r\nexamination of Dr. Wright regarding the deposition of Dr. Wallace. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe admission of a deposition is an evidentiary issue that requires the trial court to\r\nexercise its discretion, and we will not disturb the trial court's decision unless we\r\nfind an abuse of discretion. Paschal v. Causey, 309 S.C. 206, 210, 420 S.E.2d 863,\r\n866 (Ct. App. 1992); see also Conway v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury Inc., 363\r\nS.C. 301, 307, 609 S.E.2d 838, 842 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"The decision to admit or\r\nexclude evidence is within the trial court's sound discretion and will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure allow the admission of depositions at\r\ntrial        against any party who was present or represented at the\r\n             taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice\r\n             thereof, in accordance with any of the following\r\n             provisions:\r\n             (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the\r\n             purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of\r\n             deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted\r\n             by the rules of evidence.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n             (3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party,\r\n             may be used by any party for any purpose if the court\r\n             finds:\r\n             (A) that the witness is dead; or\r\n             (B) that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles\r\n             from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the State,\r\n             unless it appears that the absence of the witness was\r\n             procured by the party offering the deposition; or\r\n             (C) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because\r\n             of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or\r\n             (D) that the party offering the deposition has been unable\r\n             to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or\r\n             (E) upon application and notice, that such exceptional\r\n             circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest\r\n\n             of justice and with due regard to the importance of\r\n             presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open\r\n             court, to allow the deposition to be used.\r\n\r\nRule 32(a), SCRCP (emphases added).\r\n\r\nGibson argues the federal and state version of the rule are \"essentially the same.\"\r\n\r\n             The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that allow the use\r\n             of deposition testimony in place of live testimony \"have\r\n             not changed the long established principle that testimony\r\n             by deposition is less desirable than oral testimony and\r\n             should ordinarily be used as a substitute only if the\r\n             witness is not available to testify in person.\"\r\n\r\nLoinaz v. EG & G, Inc., 910 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting 8 C. Wright & A.\r\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2142 (1970)).\r\n\r\nIn Richland County v. Carolina Chloride, Inc., 382 S.C. 634, 644, 677 S.E.2d 892,\r\n897 (Ct. App. 2009), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 394 S.C. 154,\r\n714 S.E.2d 869 (2011), a party attempted to admit excerpts of a deposition, arguing\r\nthe deponent \"qualified as an officer, director, or managing agent under Rule\r\n32(a)(2), SCRCP.\" The court found, \"If not admissible under Rule 32(a)(2), [the\r\nparty] needed to demonstrate [the deponent] was unavailable pursuant to Rule\r\n32(a)(3), SCRCP, or alternatively, if [the deponent] was available, [the party]\r\nshould have called him as a witness at trial.\" Id.\r\n\r\nRule 32(a)(1) allows a deposition to be used to impeach a deponent or for any\r\nother purpose permitted by the rules of evidence. Gibson was not seeking to admit\r\nthe deposition to impeach the deponent, Dr. Wallace; he was attempting to admit it\r\nto impeach Dr. Wright. Additionally, Dr. Wallace was not unavailable as provided\r\nby 32(a)(3) and actually testified at trial. Gibson does not provide for what\r\npurpose the deposition is allowed under the rules of evidence but stops the reading\r\nof 32(a) before \"in accordance with any of the following provisions.\" Accordingly,\r\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the deposition.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the timeline summary, and\r\nfurther, Gibson has not shown he was prejudiced by it. Additionally, the trial court\r\ndid not err in denying his motion for a mistrial. Finally, the trial court did not err\r\nin not allowing excluding Dr. Wallace's deposition during Dr. Wright's testimony.\r\nTherefore, the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5129","title":"SCDSS v.

F. L. (Mother) appeals the family court's termination of\r\nher parental rights to her minor child (Child). After careful consideration, we hold\r\nthe family court erred in finding termination of Mother's parental rights was in\r\nChild's best interest.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nMother gave birth to Child in September of 2003. On July 28, 2008, the\r\nDepartment of Social Services (DSS) filed an intervention action against Mother\r\ndue to the deplorable conditions of Mother's home, allegations of drug abuse, and\r\ndomestic disputes. At that time, Mother's home was excessively cluttered and\r\ninfested with cockroaches.\r\n\r\nDSS removed Child from Mother's home in March 2009, when Child was five\r\nyears old. On January 6, 2010, the family court held a merits hearing for removal.\r\nThe merits order authorized DSS to forego reasonable efforts to preserve the\r\nfamily. On June 21, 2011, the family court held a termination of parental rights\r\n(TPR) hearing.\r\n\r\nFollowing Child's removal, Mother moved into a friend's trailer. Mother presented\r\nthree witnesses who testified the trailer was clean and in good condition. DSS did\r\nnot present testimony of a caseworker who visited the trailer.\r\n\r\nIn May 2010, Mother moved back into her prior home. Mother's witnesses\r\ntestified Mother renovated the home and kept it clean. Additionally, a DSS\r\ncaseworker testified Mother gave birth to another child in July 2010, and DSS\r\ninvestigated Mother's home at that time to determine if it was safe for the infant.\r\nThe DSS caseworker testified Mother's home was safe and suitable for an infant,\r\nand she did not see evidence of drug abuse or domestic violence. The case\r\ninvolving Mother's infant was unfounded. The second Guardian ad Litem (GAL)\r\nappointed to Child's case visited Mother's home the week before the TPR hearing\r\nand testified it was \"clean and nice.\"\r\n\r\nMother testified Child lived in at least five foster homes during the first year he\r\nwas in foster care. In September 2009, DSS placed Child at York Place Episcopal\r\nHome for Children (York Place). According to Child's therapist, Child is\r\ndevelopmentally delayed; has physical and verbal aggression and neglect issues;\r\nexhibits self-destructive behaviors, anxiety, and signs of depression; and has been\r\ndiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional\r\n\ndefiant disorder. Child's therapist testified Child began regressing around\r\nDecember 2010, but she did not know what caused the regression. Child's\r\ntherapist testified Child misses Mother, and she believes Mother and Child have a\r\nbond. She testified, \"[W]hen the visits do occur . . . interaction is appropriate and\r\n…[Child] definitely has a significant bond with [Mother].\" However, Child's\r\ntherapist was concerned about Mother's \"sporadic contact\" with Child. When\r\nasked about Child's feelings about adoption, Child's therapist testified, \"Adoption\r\nhasn't really been explored with him. When I spoke with his adoption worker [she]\r\nkind of felt that right now just trying to stabilize him and get him situated that he\r\ndevelopmentally would not process well with adoption . . . .\"\r\n\r\nChild's initial GAL testified, \"[T]here is a great love and bond between [Mother]\r\nand [Child],\" and Child \"says he would like to [go] home.\" However, she\r\nexpressed concern about Mother's ability to provide structure and discipline for\r\nChild, and she believed TPR was in Child's best interest because Child needed\r\n\"someone who can give him that stability and hands on expertise with dealing with\r\nhis personality issues . . . .\" She continued, \"[I]t's very difficult for me to say,\r\nJudge, because I do see how much [Child] loves [Mother].\" When asked whether\r\nChild was ready to be adopted, she stated, \"I don't think he would be ready yet. I\r\nmean, if he can continue to improve I think he would be adoptable.\"\r\n\r\nThe second GAL appointed to Child's case did not observe any contact between\r\nChild and Mother. However, she testified that every time she visited Child, he\r\ntalked about Mother, and she believed a bond existed between Mother and Child.\r\nShe testified TPR was in Child's best interest because Child needed special care\r\nand someone \"who [could] handle someone with his difficulties.\" Child's GAL\r\nnoted Child's medical issues and testified, \"[I]t's going to take somebody with a lot\r\nof ability in that area to be able to take care of him.\" When asked whether she\r\nthought Mother could provide the care Child needed, she responded, \"Well, if she's\r\nwith him 24/7 the way the staff is at York Place[, but] she now has another child\r\nand she has a job.\"\r\n\r\nChild's DSS caseworker testified Child missed Mother and always asked when he\r\nwould see her again. However, she agreed DSS's plan for TPR was in Child's best\r\ninterest because she felt Child needed permanency. She testified Region One\r\nAdoptions assessed Child and accepted him as a candidate for adoption.\r\n\r\nDSS did not present testimony from a caseworker who was involved in Child's\r\ncase between March 2009, when Child was removed, and March 2010, when the\r\n\ncase was reassigned to an intensive foster care caseworker. When questioned\r\nabout Mother's visitation with Child, the intensive foster care caseworker testified,\r\n\"From my records she has visited.\" However, she testified Mother did not visit\r\nbetween March 1, 2010, and July 20, 2010. Child's therapist testified York Place\r\nallows parents one two-hour visit or two one-hour visits per month, and Mother\r\nvisited Child in July 2010, September 2010, October 2010, December 2010, and\r\nMay 2011, and attended a treatment plan review in August 2010. York Place is\r\napproximately one-hundred seventeen miles from Pickens County, or two hundred\r\nthirty-four miles round trip. Child's therapist did not have any records of Mother's\r\nvisitation prior to June 2010, and she did not know when Mother visited prior to\r\nthen. Mother failed to visit between December 2010 and May 2011; however,\r\nMother testified her home burned in a fire in December 2010, and she used her\r\nextra income to repair the home because she wanted it to be suitable for Child.\r\n\r\nThe family court found clear and convincing evidence supported TPR on the\r\nfollowing grounds: (1) failure to support; (2) severe and repetitious abuse or\r\nneglect such that it was unlikely the home could be made safe within twelve\r\nmonths; and (3) Child had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-\r\ntwo months. Additionally, it found TPR was in Child's best interest. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the decision of the family court, an appellate court has the authority to\r\nfind the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 384, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011). While\r\nthis court retains its authority to make its own findings of fact, we recognize the\r\nsuperior position of the family court in making credibility determinations. Id. at\r\n392, 709 S.E.2d at 655. In addition, \"consistent with our constitutional authority\r\nfor de novo review, an appellant is not relieved of his burden to demonstrate error\r\nin the family court's findings of fact.\" Id. Thus, \"the family court's factual\r\nfindings will be affirmed unless 'appellant satisfies this Court that the\r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the family court.'\" Id.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding TPR was in Child's best\r\ninterest.1 We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of [the TPR statute] is to establish procedures for the reasonable and\r\ncompassionate [TPR] where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order\r\nto protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for\r\nadoption . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2510 (2010). In a TPR case, the best\r\ninterest of the child is the paramount consideration. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\nSmith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The interest[] of\r\nthe child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010). \"Appellate courts must consider the child's\r\nperspective, and not the parent's, as the primary concern when determining whether\r\nTPR is appropriate.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W., Op. No. 27235 (S.C.\r\nSup. Ct. filed Mar. 20, 2013) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 37).\r\n\r\n\"The termination of the legal relationship between natural parents and a child\r\npresents one of the most difficult issues this Court is called upon to decide.\" S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).\r\n\"We exercise great caution in reviewing termination proceedings and will conclude\r\ntermination is proper only when the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates\r\nsuch a result.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina has considered bonding when determining\r\nwhether TPR is in a child's best interest. In Charleston County Department of\r\nSocial Services v. King, the court held TPR was in the child's best interest because\r\nhe had bonded with his foster family and did not remember his biological family.\r\n369 S.C. 96, 104-06, 631 S.E.2d 239, 243-44 (2006). It determined the family\r\ncourt correctly concluded TPR was in the child's best interest even though his older\r\nsiblings had reunited with their mother. Id. at 99, 106, 631 S.E.2d at 240, 244.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Mother also contends the family court erred in finding clear and convincing\r\nevidence of the statutory grounds for TPR. We decline to address this issue\r\nbecause our determination of the best interest issue is dispositive. See Futch v.\r\nMcAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n(1999).\r\n\nAdditionally, this court has considered future stability when determining whether\r\nTPR is in a child's best interest. In Charleston County Department of Social\r\nServices v. Jackson, this court reversed a family court order terminating the\r\nparental rights of an incarcerated father. 368 S.C. 87, 105, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775\r\n(Ct. App. 2006). We noted:\r\n\r\n             Child's current foster parents wish to remain as foster\r\n             parents and, as of the TPR hearing, have not expressed an\r\n             interest in adopting him. Thus, terminating Father's\r\n             parental rights will not ensure future stability for Child.\r\n             Moreover, keeping Father's parental rights intact will not\r\n             disrupt Child's current living situation. Father does not\r\n             gain custody of Child simply because [DSS] failed to\r\n             terminate his parental rights at this time. Rather, by not\r\n             terminating Father's parental rights, Father merely\r\n             maintains his right to connect with Child as well as his\r\n             obligation to support Child, emotionally, financially, or\r\n             otherwise.\r\n\r\nId. at 102-03, 627 S.E.2d at 774. We held TPR was not in the child's best interest\r\neven though the father's relationship with the child was \"faint.\" Id. at 104, 627\r\nS.E.2d at 775. This was in part due to Father's extraordinary efforts to locate and\r\nmaintain a relationship with the child. Id.\r\n\r\nLikewise, in South Carolina Department of Social Services v. Janice C., this court\r\nheld TPR was not in the children's best interest in part because the children\r\nenjoyed interacting with their mother and no pre-adoptive home had been\r\nidentified. 383 S.C. 221, 229-30, 678 S.E.2d 463, 468 (Ct. App. 2009). We\r\nreversed the family court's termination of the mother's parental rights even though\r\ntestimony suggested the mother would never be able to adequately parent her\r\nchildren due to mental disabilities. Id. at 229-31, 678 S.E.2d at 468. In doing so,\r\nwe noted that in the absence of a pre-adoptive home, \"TPR will not provide future\r\nstability for [the c]hildren.\" Id. at 230, 678 S.E.2d at 468.\r\n\r\nWe find a valuable bond exists between Child and Mother. During the TPR\r\nhearing, both of Child's GALs and Child's therapist testified Child misses Mother\r\nand Child has a significant bond with Mother. The DSS caseworker testified Child\r\nfrequently asked when he would see Mother again. Furthermore, Child's therapist\r\ntestified Mother's contact with Child during visitation was appropriate. During\r\n\noral argument, DSS admitted Child is bonded with Mother. When viewed from\r\nChild's perspective, it is undisputed a significant bond exists.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the evidence suggests Child is not a viable candidate for adoption.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2510 (2010) (\"The purpose of [the TPR statute] is to\r\nestablish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of parental\r\nrights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the\r\nhealth and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption….\"). At\r\nthe TPR hearing, Child's therapist testified she had not discussed adoption with\r\nChild because she was trying to get him stabilized, and she was not sure how he\r\nwould process it. Likewise, the GAL testified she did not believe Child was ready\r\nto be adopted. Child is currently nine years old and has several emotional and\r\nbehavioral issues, including ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, physical and\r\nverbal aggression, neglect issues, self-destructive behaviors, anxiety, and signs of\r\ndepression. At the time of the TPR hearing, Child was in a group home, and\r\nMother testified he had lived in five foster homes during the first year he was in\r\nfoster care. During oral argument, DSS indicated Child is currently in a\r\ntherapeutic foster home. DSS has not identified a pre-adoptive home for Child,\r\nand his age coupled with his emotional and behavioral issues suggest a suitable and\r\nwilling adoptive home may not exist. Accordingly, it is unclear how TPR will\r\nensure future stability for Child.\r\n\r\nBased on undisputed evidence of Child's bond with Mother, the evidence that\r\nsuggests he is not a viable candidate for adoption, and the fact that DSS has not\r\nidentified a pre-adoptive home for Child, we hold the family court erred in finding\r\nTPR was in Child's best interest. Although we are cognizant of policy\r\nconsiderations that seek to prevent a child from languishing in foster care, we feel\r\nthis case is distinguishable due to Child's strong bond with Mother and DSS's\r\nfailure to identify a pre-adoptive home. We do not believe the existence of a bond\r\nalone is significant enough to preserve parental rights. Nor do we believe DSS\r\nmust identify a pre-adoptive home prior to terminating parental rights. Our\r\ndetermination is based solely on the unique facts presented in this case, and we\r\nview this decision from the perspective of Child and not Mother. If Child was\r\ncurrently thriving in a pre-adoptive home, or if the evidence suggested Child did\r\nnot want to see Mother or was not bonded with Mother, our decision might be\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the decision of the family court and remand this case for a\r\npermanency planning hearing pursuant to section 63-7-1700 of the South Carolina\r\n\nCode (2010 & Supp. 2012). A permanency planning hearing will allow all parties\r\nand the GAL an opportunity to update the family court on what has occurred since\r\nthe TPR hearing. We make no finding as to whether reunification with Mother is\r\nin Child's best interest. We urge the family court to conduct a hearing as\r\nexpeditiously as possible, including presentation of a new GAL report and an\r\nupdated home evaluation of Mother's residence. If necessary, the family court\r\nmay, inter alia, change custody, modify visitation, and approve a treatment plan\r\noffering additional services to Mother.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the family court's order terminating Mother's\r\nparental rights and remand for a permanency planning hearing.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5128","title":"State v.

The State contends the circuit court erred in finding Jolly's being held in\r\ncriminal contempt for the same conduct precluded his prosecution because the\r\n\noffenses were not identical and required proof of different elements. We reverse\r\nand remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nJolly was allegedly involved in a fraudulent mortgage scheme in which he induced\r\ndistressed homeowners to transfer their mortgaged property to him through\r\nquitclaim deeds. Jolly represented to the victims he would pay off the mortgages\r\non their behalf once they transferred their property to him and instructed them to\r\nsubmit their future mortgage payments to him instead of the original mortgage\r\nholder. Jolly's scheme caused the filing of at least forty-five foreclosure actions\r\nagainst the victims' properties. Jolly's frivolous filings in the master-in-equity's\r\ncourt caused an enormous backlog of cases. Additionally, Jolly filed claims\r\nagainst the masters-in-equity for Horry and Georgetown County. Circuit Court\r\nJudge J. Michael Baxley was assigned to remedy the backlog of cases created by\r\nJolly.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 2009, Judge Baxley issued an order directing Jolly to appear for a\r\nhearing and rule to show cause as to why he should not be sanctioned, held in\r\ncontempt, and dismissed from further involvement in pending cases. On April 3,\r\n2009, the State filed a summons and complaint and a motion for a temporary\r\ninjunction against Jolly. The court held a hearing on the matter on April 16, 2009.\r\nJolly appeared pro se. Jolly informed the court he had removed the case to federal\r\ncourt but only presented a receipt for payment of a filing fee.1 He also indicated he\r\nhad amended his answer to the State's action to assert a third-party claim directly\r\nagainst Judge Baxley, requiring the recusal of Judge Baxley.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, Ernest Mauck and Esther Reinhardt, two victims of Jolly's alleged\r\nscheme, testified regarding their dealings with him. On May 4, 2009, Judge\r\nBaxley issued an order holding Jolly in criminal contempt of court and sentencing\r\nhim to six months' imprisonment. Judge Baxley found, \"Jolly's orchestration of the\r\naforementioned Scheme, his conduct in the Foreclosure Actions, and his conduct\r\nbefore the Court at the April 16th hearing has interfered with judicial proceedings,\r\nexhibited disrespect for the Court, and hampered the parties and witnesses\" as well\r\nas \"were calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the administration of\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The federal court ultimately did not accept removal, dismissing the petition and\r\nremanding the case back to circuit court.\r\n\njustice.\" The court also issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Jolly and his\r\ncompany from withdrawing funds collected through the fraudulent acts.2\r\n\r\nA grand jury indicted Jolly for one count of the unauthorized practice of law and\r\nfive counts of obtaining property by false pretenses. Trial commenced on April 12,\r\n2011. Jolly moved to dismiss the indictments, arguing double jeopardy would be\r\nviolated because of Judge Baxley's finding of criminal contempt. Following\r\narguments, the State informed the court it would immediately appeal if the court\r\ndismissed the charges. The trial court granted Jolly's motion to dismiss as to two\r\ncounts3 of obtaining property by false pretenses.4 This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State argues the trial court erred in dismissing two indictments for obtaining\r\nproperty by false pretenses based on double jeopardy because the elements of\r\nobtaining property by false pretenses were distinctly different from the elements of\r\ncriminal contempt and each required a proof of fact the other did not. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina\r\nConstitutions operate to protect citizens from being twice placed in jeopardy of life\r\nor liberty for the same offense.\" State v. Brandt, 393 S.C. 526, 538, 713 S.E.2d\r\n591, 597 (2011). \"The United States Constitution, which is applicable to South\r\nCarolina via the Fourteenth Amendment provides: '[N]or shall any person be\r\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. . . .'\" Id.\r\n(quoting U.S. Const. amend. V) (alterations by court). Additionally, the South\r\nCarolina Constitution states: \"'No person shall be subject for the same offense to be\r\ntwice put in jeopardy for life or liberty. . . .'\" Id. (quoting S.C. Const. art. I, § 12)\r\n(alteration by court). \"The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against a second\r\nprosecution for the same offense after acquittal or conviction, and protects against\r\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.\" Stevenson v. State, 335 S.C. 193, 198,\r\n516 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1999).\r\n\r\n2 On June 15, 2009, Judge Baxley issued a global order for all foreclosure cases in\r\nwhich Jolly was a party, dismissing him as a party and declaring void ab initio any\r\ndeeds through which Jolly claimed an interest in those properties.\r\n3 These counts related to his actions towards Mauck and Reinhardt.\r\n4 Trial proceeded on the remaining counts, Jolly was convicted, and this court\r\ndismissed the appeal of those convictions. See State v. Jolly, Op. No. 2013-UP-\r\n043 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 30, 2013).\r\n\n\"A defendant may be severally indicted and punished for separate offenses without\r\nbeing placed in double jeopardy where a single act consists of two distinct\r\noffenses.\" Brandt, 393 S.C. at 538, 713 S.E.2d at 597 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). The test for determining whether there are two offenses is whether each\r\nof the statutory provisions requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\r\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932); see also Matthews v.\r\nState, 300 S.C. 238, 240, 387 S.E.2d 258, 259 (1990) (finding to determine\r\nwhether the legislature intended multiple punishments under different statutes\r\nwhen the intent is not otherwise clear from the face of the statute or its legislative\r\nhistory, the test is whether each statute requires proof of a fact that the other does\r\nnot); State v. Cuccia, 353 S.C. 430, 438, 578 S.E.2d 45, 49 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n(finding under traditional double jeopardy analysis, multiple punishments are not\r\nprohibited when each offense requires proof of a fact the other does not). Thus, to\r\ndetermine whether double jeopardy has been violated, the court must examine\r\nwhether the offenses have the same elements. Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304; State\r\nv. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 130, 132, 489 S.E.2d 617, 622, 623 (1997). The Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States has often concluded two statutes define the same offense\r\nwhen one is a lesser included offense of the other. Rutledge v. United States, 517\r\nU.S. 292, 297 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of any additional\r\nsanction that could be described as punishment. Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S.\r\n93, 98-99 (1997); see also State v. Blick, 325 S.C. 636, 642, 481 S.E.2d 452, 455\r\n(Ct. App. 1997) (holding administrative punishment by prison officials does not\r\nrender subsequent judicial proceedings violative of the prohibition against double\r\njeopardy). The Clause protects against the imposition of multiple criminal\r\npunishments for the same offense, and only then when such occurs in successive\r\npleadings. Hudson, 522 U.S at 99.\r\n\r\n \"The United States Supreme Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have\r\ndetermined that in the context of criminal penalties, the Blockburger . . . same\r\nelements test is the sole test of double jeopardy in successive prosecutions and\r\nmultiple punishment cases.\" Brandt, 393 S.C. at 538-39, 713 S.E.2d at 597\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \"Under the Blockburger test, a defendant may\r\nbe convicted of two separate crimes arising from the same conduct without being\r\nplaced in double jeopardy where his conduct consists of two distinct offenses.\" Id.\r\nat 539, 713 S.E.2d at 597-98 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"An application\r\nof the Blockburger test requires a technical comparison of the elements of the\r\n\noffense for which the defendant was first tried with the elements of the offense in\r\nthe subsequent prosecution.\" Id. at 539, 713 S.E.2d at 598 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn Brandt, the defendant, Brandt, argued double jeopardy barred his forgery\r\nprosecution because he had been held in criminal contempt after producing a\r\nfraudulent document in a civil proceeding. Id. at 536, 713 S.E.2d at 596. Brandt\r\nadvocated the court apply Justice Scalia's \"lesser-included offense\" method of\r\nanalysis instead of Chief Justice Rehnquist's \"literal same-elements analysis\" as set\r\nforth in United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688 (1993). Brandt, 393 S.C. at 539, 713\r\nS.E.2d at 598. The court interpreted Brandt's arguments as applying the \"same\r\nelements test\" by comparing the underlying conduct between the offenses of\r\ncriminal contempt and forgery.5 Id. The court found it did not need to choose\r\nbetween the divergent views of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia because\r\nthe case did not involve a violation of a court order as Dixon did. Id. The court\r\nfound that even if it \"were to choose between the two views, we find this state's\r\npost-Dixon jurisprudence definitively establishes that our courts have adopted a\r\ntraditional, strict application of the Blockburger 'same elements test.'\" Id.\r\n\r\nTo apply the Blockburger analysis, the Brandt court compared the individual\r\nelements of the criminal contempt conviction and the forgery offense. Id. at 540,\r\n713 S.E.2d at 598. The court found\r\n\r\n             each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does\r\n             not. Specifically, the offense of forgery does not require\r\n             any interference with judicial proceedings that is\r\n             \"calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the\r\n\r\n5 The court noted Brandt filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus for his\r\nconviction of criminal contempt in the United States District Court for the District\r\nof South Carolina, which was granted, and the United States Court of Appeals for\r\nthe Fourth Circuit affirmed the decision. Brandt, 393 S.C. at 536 n.5, 713 S.E.2d\r\nat 596 n.5 (citing Brandt v. Ozmint, 636 F.3d 124 (4th Cir. 2011); Brandt v.\r\nOzmint, 664 F. Supp. 2d 626 (D.S.C. 2009)). The court recognized that because\r\nthis effectively vacated the prior conviction, Brandt could no longer assert Double\r\nJeopardy barred his forgery prosecution. Id. However, the court analyzed the\r\ndouble jeopardy issue in the event the Fourth Circuit's decision was reversed. Id.  \r\n \r\n\n             administration of justice.\" In comparison, the\r\n             commission of criminal contempt does not require the\r\n             \"uttering or publishing of a fraudulent document.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 541, 713 S.E.2d at 598 (citation omitted). The court found, \"Brandt's\r\nsubsequent prosecution for forgery did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause as\r\nthe prior criminal contempt conviction involved decidedly different elements.\" Id.\r\nat 541, 713 S.E.2d at 599 (citing State v.

App. 1999) (concluding that double jeopardy did not bar convictions for\r\nboth forgery and insurance fraud, based on a forged \"Affidavit of Total Theft of a\r\nMotor Vehicle\" that was submitted to insurer \"[b]ecause each offense contains at\r\nleast one element which must be proven by an additional fact that the other does\r\nnot require\"); Jay M.

Direct contempt involves contemptuous conduct in\r\nthe presence of the court. State v. Kennerly, 337 S.C. 617, 620, 524 S.E.2d 837,\r\n838 (1999). \"This State's courts have held the 'presence of the court' extends\r\nbeyond the mere physical presence of the judge or the courtroom to encompass all\r\nelements of the system.\" Id. A person may be found guilty of direct contempt if\r\nhis or her conduct interferes with judicial proceedings, exhibits disrespect for the\r\ncourt, or hampers the parties or witnesses. State v. Havelka, 285 S.C. 388, 389,\r\n330 S.E.2d 288, 288 (1985).\r\n\r\n             A person who by false pretense or representation obtains\r\n             the signature of a person to a written instrument or\r\n             obtains from another person any chattel, money, valuable\r\n             security, or other property, real or personal, with intent to\r\n             cheat and defraud a person of that property is guilty of a:\r\n             (1) felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not more\r\n             than five hundred dollars and imprisoned not more than\r\n\n             ten years if the value of the property is five thousand\r\n             dollars or more.\r\n             (2) felony and, upon conviction, must be fined in the\r\n             discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than five\r\n             years if the value of the property is more than one\r\n             thousand dollars but less than five thousand dollars . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 16-13-240(2) (2003).\r\n\r\nCriminal contempt occurs when a person acts contemptuously in the court's\r\npresence. Jolly did this in a number of ways. He informed the court he had\r\nremoved the case to federal court, but only provided the court with a receipt for\r\npayment of a filing fee and did not serve the State. The court found he repeatedly\r\nfiled frivolous answers and other documents manifestly devoid of merit to impede\r\nthe orderly progress and disposition of cases. The court also found his conduct\r\nrequired withdrawal of orders of reference and returns to the circuit court of over\r\nforty-five cases and interfered with the orderly adjudication of dozens of\r\nforeclosure actions. The court found Jolly's involvement in the preparation,\r\nexecution, and improper notarization of quitclaim deeds constituted fraud upon the\r\ncourt. Additionally, the court determined his \"remarkable lack of candor evident in\r\nthe testimony he elicited . . . was an affront to the integrity of the judicial process\r\nand evinced an intention to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the administration of\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly to Brandt, 393 S.C. at 541, 713 S.E.2d at 598, the offense of obtaining\r\nproperty by false pretenses \"does not require any interference with judicial\r\nproceedings that is 'calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the\r\nadministration of justice.'\" In comparison, the commission of criminal contempt\r\ndoes not require the obtaining from another person by false pretenses real property\r\nwith the intent to cheat and defraud a person of that property. Simply because the\r\ncourt found Jolly's orchestration of the scheme, in concert with his conduct in the\r\nforeclosure actions and his conduct before the court, amounted to contempt of\r\ncourt, does not prevent him from also being tried for obtaining property under false\r\npretenses for that scheme. The elements of contempt and obtaining property would\r\nhave to be the same, and they are not.6 Therefore, the trial court erred in finding\r\n\r\n6Jolly did not appeal the finding of criminal contempt. Because he did not, he is\r\nbound by the finding that he was in contempt. See Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455,\r\n458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (\"Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, a party is\r\n\ndouble jeopardy barred Jolly's prosecution for obtaining property under false\r\npretenses.

The circuit court determined the Directors and Officers\r\nEndorsement (D&O Endorsement) issued by Travelers covered certain allegations\r\nagainst Kensington Place Property Owners Association (KPOA). We affirm in\r\npart and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nM.U.I. Carolina Corporation, Regent Carolina Corporation, and Regent\r\nCorporation (collectively Developers) purchased property from the PTL1\r\nbankruptcy estate in 1990. Developers completed construction and made repairs to\r\nthe property in 1994 and 1995 and then began marketing condominium units as the\r\nKensington Place Horizontal Property Regime (Kensington Place). Developers\r\ncreated KPOA to manage Kensington Place. From its inception in 1996 until April\r\n2007, a three-member board comprised of Developers' employees or designates\r\noperated KPOA. The common elements of Kensington Place were transferred to\r\nthe unit owners in April 2007, and individual unit owners became a part of KPOA's\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Respondents, individual unit owners in Kensington Place, filed an\r\nunderlying lawsuit alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence, and breach of\r\nthe warranty of habitability against M.U.I. and Regent as developers of Kensington\r\nDevelopers. Respondents also sued KPOA for breaches of fiduciary duty and\r\nnegligence in failing to (1) adequately inspect, repair, and maintain the common\r\nelements, (2) inform unit owners of the conflict of interest in a developer-\r\ncontrolled POA, and (3) establish a reserve fund to pay for repairs.\r\n\r\nRespondents then filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of\r\nwhether the policy issued to KPOA by Travelers covered the claims alleged\r\n\r\n1PTL was an evangelistic ministry which began as a television program and\r\neventually grew to include a theme park in Fort Mill, South Carolina. Charles H.\r\nLippy, PTL Club (May 1, 2013), http://www.scencyclopedia.org/ptlclub.htm.\r\n\nagainst KPOA in the underlying lawsuit. The parties agreed the allegations were\r\nbased on \"wrongful acts\" as contemplated by the D&O Endorsement. However,\r\nTravelers filed a motion for summary judgment arguing, inter alia, Respondents'\r\nclaims are for \"property damage\" and punitive damages, both of which are\r\nexcluded under the D&O Endorsement. The Respondents filed a summary\r\njudgment motion arguing the only interpretation of the policy is that their claims\r\nwere not excluded because they claimed economic loss based on breaches of duty\r\nand negligence, not \"property damage.\"\r\n\r\nAs to KPOA, Respondents specifically alleged in the underlying complaint2:\r\n\r\n            19. The Defendant POA had the legal duty, as a\r\n            fiduciary from 1996 until April 24, 2007, to insure that\r\n            the Common Elements were properly inspected, repaired,\r\n            and maintained, yet the POA, Inc., being controlled by\r\n            the developer, failed in these duties, placed the interest of\r\n            the developer ahead of the owners, including these\r\n            Plaintiffs, and therefore breached its fiduciary duties.\r\n            Additionally, the Defendant POA had the duty to create\r\n            and fund an adequate fund of reserves for the normal\r\n            replacement of the components of the Common\r\n            Elements, yet, in placing the interest of the defendant\r\n            Developers ahead of the owners, the POA failed to\r\n            develop and fund and adequate reserve fund.\r\n\r\n            20. As a result of the aforementioned breaches of\r\n            fiduciary duty, the Defendants are liable to the\r\n            homeowners for all damages proximately flowing from\r\n            the breach, including damages for the continued\r\n            deterioration of the common elements.\r\n            ....\r\n            26. That the actions of the POA were negligent,\r\n            reckless, willful, and wanton, in one or more of the\r\n            following of the following particulars, to wit:\r\n\r\n\r\n2 In determining whether Respondents' claims were covered, the circuit court\r\nreviewed the Fifth Amended Complaint. For the sake of brevity, we refer to this\r\nsimply as the complaint.\r\n\na.\t In failing to perform adequate inspections of the\r\n    Common Elements from 1996-2007;\r\n\r\nb. In failing to retain experts to assess the conditions of\r\n   the building from 1996-2007;\r\n\r\nc.\t In failing to maintain the Common Elements to an\r\n    adequate state of repair from 1996-2007;\r\n\r\nd. In failing to repair the Common Elements of the\r\n   building from 1996-2007;\r\n\r\ne.\t In negligently placing the Developers' interests ahead\r\n    of those of the individual property owners, so as to\r\n    place the entire financial burden of deferred\r\n    maintenance upon the property owners, including\r\n    these Plaintiffs, while acting in the capacity of a\r\n    fiduciary;\r\n\r\nf.\t In failing to establish and fund adequate reserve\r\n    funds;\r\n\r\ng. In failing to establish an adequate depreciation\r\n   schedule and adequately fund known building\r\n   component repair and replacement; and\r\n\r\nh. In failing to advise the homeowners of the various\r\n   conflicts of interest inherent in a developer-controlled\r\n   POA, and in failing to provide for independent\r\n   representation of non-developer homeowners both\r\n   with respect to POA actions, and also regarding\r\n   property management and maintenance.\r\n\r\n27. As a direct and proximate result of the negligence,\r\nrecklessness, willfulness and wantonness of the\r\nDefendants as set out above, the Plaintiffs Homeowners\r\nwill be required to expend considerable sums for the\r\nrepair and refit of this property, all to their damage.\r\n\n             WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs pray that they have\r\n             judgment against the Defendants as follows:\r\n\r\n             1. Actual damages.\r\n\r\n             2. Actual and punitive damages on their cause of action\r\n             for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.\r\n\r\n             3. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just\r\n             and proper.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court granted Respondents' motion and denied Travelers' motion. It\r\nfound the complaint alleged KPOA had breached certain fiduciary duties that\r\nrelated to the initial design and construction defects. The circuit court reasoned\r\nallegations relating to the initial defective design or construction would not be\r\nconsidered \"property damage\" under Crossman Communities of North Carolina,\r\nInc v. Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., 395 S.C. 40, 717 S.E.2d 589 (2011), and\r\nwould not be excluded from coverage under the policy. The circuit court further\r\nreasoned \"property damage\" did include damages to other property flowing from\r\nthe defective design or construction and such allegations would be excepted from\r\ncoverage under the \"property damage\" exclusion in section (I)(D)(1) of the D&O\r\nEndorsement. The order concluded \"damages for correction of initial defective\r\nconstruction are covered. Other property damage caused by such defective\r\nconstruction is not.\" This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"A declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, and therefore, the\r\nstandard of review is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.\" Auto\r\nOwners Ins. Co., v. Newman, 385 S.C. 187, 191, 684 S.E.2d 541, 543 (2009).\r\n\"When the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage\r\nexists under an insurance policy, the action is one at law.\" Id. \"Where the action\r\npresents a question of law . . . this Court's review is plenary and without deference\r\nto the trial court.\" Crossman Cmtys. of N.C., Inc. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 395\r\nS.C. 40, 47, 717 S.E.2d 589, 592 (2011).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      Property Damage Exclusion in D&O Endorsement3\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTravelers asserts the circuit court erred in relying on Crossman Communities of\r\nNorth Carolina, Inc. v. Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., 395 S.C. 40, 717\r\nS.E.2d 589 (2011) to determine what constituted \"property damage\" within the\r\nD&O Endorsement exclusion. We agree in part and disagree in part.\r\n\r\nThe D&O Endorsement, which covers \"wrongful acts\"4 states the following:\r\n\r\n            (I.)(D.) The insurance provided by this endorsement\r\n            does not apply to:\r\n\r\n            (1) \"Bodily injury,\" \"property damage,\" \"personal\r\n                injury,\" or \"advertising injury.\"\r\n\r\n            (2) Punitive or exemplary damages.\r\n\r\n            (V.)(F.) \"Property Damage\" means:\r\n\r\n            Physical injury to tangible property, including all\r\n            resulting use of that property;\r\n\r\n            Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically\r\n            injured; or\r\n\r\n            Diminution of property value.\r\n\r\nIn Crossman, the Supreme Court of South Carolina addressed allegations of initial\r\nconstruction defects and whether they were covered \"property damage\" within the\r\ncontext of a commercial general liability (CGL) policy. As in this case, the\r\npolicy in Crossman defined \"property damage\" as \"physical injury to tangible\r\nproperty.\" Id. at 48, 717 S.E.2d at 593. The court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n3Because this issue is a threshold question, we will address it first. \n\r\n4\"'Wrongful act' means any actual or alleged error, mistake, omission or neglect or \n\r\nbreach of duty by any insured.\" \n\r\n\n             With respect to the first quoted definition of \"property\r\n             damage,\" the critical phrase is \"physical injury,\" which\r\n             suggests the property was not defective at the outset, but\r\n             rather was initially proper and injured thereafter. We\r\n             emphasize the difference between a claim for the costs of\r\n             repairing or removing defective work, which is not a\r\n             claim for \"property damage,\" and a claim for the costs of\r\n             repairing damage caused by the defective work, which is\r\n             a claim for \"property damage.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 49, 717 S.E.2d at 593 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nThe case sub judice required the circuit court to consider allegations relating to\r\ninitial defects and further resulting damage, although under a different type of\r\npolicy. In addressing those issues, it was not improper for the circuit court to look\r\nto Crossman for guidance.5 Nevertheless, we conclude the application of the\r\nprinciples set forth in Crossman do not correlate adequately to the facts and the\r\npolicy in this case to support the circuit court's conclusion in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIn Crossman, the Court concluded the cost to repair or replace initial design or\r\nconstruction defects was not covered under the CGL policy as \"property damage.\"\r\n\r\n5 Travelers relies in part on Eastpointe Condominium I Ass'n v. Travelers Casualty\r\n& Surety Co. of America, 379 Fed. Appx. 906 (11th Cir. 2010) (applying Florida\r\nlaw) to support its position. In Eastpointe, the court was considering a declaratory\r\njudgment action regarding defense of claims alleged against the condominium\r\nassociation. Id. at 906. A unit owner claimed the association failed to adequately\r\nmaintain and repair the roof and air conditioning system of the condominium\r\nbuilding before, between, and after two hurricanes, resulting in water intrusion,\r\nmold, and other damages. Id. at 906-07. The plaintiff's claims were for\r\nnegligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. Id. The court\r\ndetermined an exclusion for claims \"arising out of property damage\" prevented\r\ncoverage for the claims even though the claims were grounded in the association's\r\nbreach of its fiduciary duty. Id. at 907-08. The circuit court's analysis in this case\r\nis not inconsistent with Eastpointe. Assuming the unit in Eastpointe was not\r\ndefective prior to the water intrusion, the plaintiff's claim was to repair a physical\r\ninjury to her tangible property – an injury that would also be considered \"property\r\ndamage\" under Crossman.\r\n\nThe circuit court here also concluded the cost to repair and replace construction\r\ndefects did not constitute \"physical injury to tangible property,\" thus leading to the\r\ncontrary result that coverage was not excluded. However, reviewing the\r\nallegations of the complaint and the D&O Endorsement, we arrive at two\r\nineluctable conclusions. First, Respondents do not contend KPOA completed\r\nconstruction or made repairs to Kensington Place in 1994 and 1995 as KPOA did\r\nnot exist at that time. Consequently, no reasonable interpretation of the allegations\r\nin the complaint can support a finding that KPOA was being sued for initial\r\nconstruction or repair defects. Second, any further deterioration of the faulty\r\nconstruction or repairs from 1997 to 2006 that could arguably be attributed to\r\nKPOA's inaction would at most constitute diminution in the value of Respondents'\r\nproperty — a harm specifically included in the definition of \"property damage.\"\r\nTherefore, we conclude the circuit court erred in determining damages for\r\ncorrection of defective construction are covered under the D&O Endorsement.6\r\n\r\nHowever, our analysis cannot end there. Respondents assert two more allegations\r\nnot addressed by Crossman or Eastpointe. They allege KPOA failed to establish a\r\nreserve fund and breached a fiduciary duty to warn of the inherent conflict in\r\ndeveloper-controlled associations. The duty to establish a reserve fund, while\r\nrelated to the property damage, did not result in physical damage to tangible\r\nproperty as required by the policy. The failure to establish a reserve fund resulted\r\nin Respondents having to expend more from their own pockets to make the repairs\r\nthan they might have otherwise had to expend — economic damage. See Builders\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Lacey Constr. Co. No. CIV.A. 3:11-cv-400-CMC, 2012 WL\r\n1032539, at *9 (D.S.C. Mar. 7, 2012) (\"To the extent damages sought in the\r\n[underlying action] are for inadequate reserves or failure to record a deed, they do\r\nnot involve physical injury and, consequently, cannot satisfy the definition of\r\nproperty damage.\").7 Likewise, allegations that KPOA breached its fiduciary duty\r\nby failing to warn of conflicts of interest in a developer-controlled POA do not\r\nallege physical injury to tangible property constituting property damage. Of\r\ncourse, the burden to prove damages for the covered causes of action will be on\r\nRespondents at trial.\r\n\r\n6 Because this analysis disposes of the question of coverage for construction \n\r\ndefects, we decline to address Travelers's remaining arguments relating to that \n\r\nissue. \n\r\n7 Lacey was considering \"property damage\" in a CGL policy in which the \n\r\ndefinition of \"property damage\" included physical damage to tangible property. Id.\n\r\nat *6. \n\r\n\nII.   Additional Policy Exclusions\r\n\r\nTravelers argues several other D&O Endorsement exclusions prevent coverage for\r\nRespondents' claims. Because we have determined the allegations for failure to\r\nestablish a reserve fund and warn of conflicts of interest are not excluded as\r\n\"property damage,\" we will address each exclusion in turn as it relates to those\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nFirst, we recognize the circuit court did not explicitly rule on these additional\r\nexclusionary provisions. However, these issues were raised in Travelers' Memo In\r\nSupport of Summary Judgment and in its Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment.\r\nConsequently, they are preserved for appellate review. See Pye v. Estate of Fox,\r\n369 S.C. 555, 565-66, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510-11 (2006) (indicating once an issue has\r\nbeen raised to the trial court and is still not ruled upon after such a request in a\r\nRule 59(e) motion, the issue is sufficiently preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\nSection I(D)(3)(b) of the D&O Endorsement excludes coverage for damages\r\nresulting from \"[a]ny dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious act, error or\r\nomission committed by or with the knowledge of any insured.\" In this case,\r\nRespondents allege KPOA \"placed the interest of the developer ahead of the\r\nowners\" when it failed to properly inspect or maintain the property or establish a\r\nreserve fund. While the act of placing the developer's interests before the owners\r\nmay constitute a breach of fiduciary duty, it does not allege any dishonest,\r\nfraudulent, criminal, or malicious action. Therefore, this provision does not bar\r\ncoverage for the remaining claims.\r\n\r\nSection I(D)(3)(f) excludes coverage for damages resulting from \"[t]he failure of\r\nany insured to enforce the rights of the Named Insured against the builder, sponsor\r\nor developer of the property designated in the Declaration.\" Again, this exclusion\r\nwas brought to the circuit court's attention but was not specifically ruled upon.\r\nTravelers contends this exclusion applies because, in essence, Respondents'\r\ncomplaint alleges KPOA failed to enforce the owners' rights against the developers\r\nby putting the developers' interests ahead of the owners' interests. We disagree.\r\nThe complaint does not allege KPOA failed to enforce any rights or compel the\r\ndeveloper to perform a particular action. The complaint alleges a failure establish\r\nthe reserve fund and to warn of conflicts of interest. Consequently, this argument\r\nis without merit.\r\n\nFinally, section I(D)(3)(i) excludes coverage for damages resulting from \"[a]ny\r\nclaim or 'suit' made by any insured against another insured.\" Travelers argues\r\nseven of Respondents who have in the past served as boardmembers of KPOA, are\r\ninsureds under the D&O Endorsement and cannot participate in the underlying\r\nlawsuit. The D&O Endorsement defines who is an insured.\r\n\r\n            WHO IS AN INSURED\r\n\r\n            B. Your directors, trustees or officers are also insureds,\r\n            but only while acting within the scope of their duties\r\n            for you. This includes:\r\n\r\n            1. Those who currently are directors, trustees or\r\n            officers;\r\n\r\n            2. Those who were directors, trustees or officers\r\n            when the \"wrongful act\" took place;\r\n\r\n            3. Those who become directors, trustees or\r\n            officers after the effective date of the\r\n            insurance, but only for subsequent \"wrongful\r\n            acts.\"\r\n\r\n            C. Your employees and members are insureds, but only\r\n            while acting at your direction and within the scope of\r\n            their duties for you.\r\n\r\nThe wrongful acts alleged against KPOA occurred from 1997-2006. According to\r\nthe Record on Appeal, none of the members were on the board at the time the\r\nalleged wrongful acts took place.8 Therefore, this argument is without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8Deborah Pulliam - April 24, 2007- Feb. 2008; Elena Manfredini - two months in\r\n2008; Vincent Dionna - 2007; Helen Cook - May 2007-Feb. 2008; Mikel Marcuse-\r\nJuly 2007-Feb. 2008; Kathleen Kramer - Nov. 2007-Feb. 2008, April 2008-\r\npresent; David Osborne - Dec. 2007-April 2008.\r\n\nIII.   Punitive Damages\r\n\r\nTravelers argues the circuit court erred in failing to rule on the issue of coverage\r\nfor punitive damages under the D&O Endorsement. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe policy clearly excludes punitive damages in Section I(D)(2). Because punitive\r\ndamages have been pled, the issue will be a part of the underlying trial and should\r\nbe addressed so as to avoid any potential conflict regarding coverage for such\r\nexemplary damages. See Storm M.H. ex rel. McSwain v. Charleston Cnty. Bd. of\r\nTrustees, 400 S.C. 478, 487, 735 S.E.2d 492, 497 (2012) (addressing an issue in\r\nthe interest of judicial economy). We exercise our discretion to rule on this issue\r\nand conclude the D&O Endorsement does not cover punitive damages.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, we conclude the D&O Endorsement provides\r\ncoverage for Respondents' allegations against KPOA for breach of fiduciary duty\r\nin failing to establish a reserve fund and warn of the potential conflicts in a\r\ndeveloper-controlled POA. We find the circuit court properly held claims alleging\r\ndamage to other property as a result of defective design or construction were\r\nexcluded as \"property damage.\" We further conclude the circuit court erred in\r\nfinding the D&O Endorsement provided coverage for correction of initial defective\r\nconstruction. Finally, we hold the D&O Endorsement does not cover claims for\r\npunitive damages. Therefore the ruling of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5131","title":"Proctor v.

From 1999 until 2005, Proctor frequently\r\ngambled on video poker machines located in the Pizza Man and Rockaways\r\nAthletic Club (Rockaways) restaurants.2 During that time, Proctor lost between\r\n$1,000 and $5,000 per week from gambling on video poker machines at the two\r\nrestaurants. According to Proctor, Pizza Man and Rockaways would provide her\r\ncash advances on her credit cards to enable her to fund her gambling as well as free\r\nfood and alcohol.\r\n\r\nProctor was employed by State Title, which her mother owned. State Title\r\nprovided real estate closing services to attorney Walter Smith. Proctor began\r\nforging her mother's name on checks and stealing money from Smith's trust\r\naccount to use video poker machines. Because of Proctor's activities, Smith's trust\r\naccount contained insufficient funds to satisfy the mortgages on several properties\r\nat closing. Accordingly, Trans-Union National Title Insurance Company3 (Trans-\r\nUnion), which acted as State Title's title insurance company, paid approximately\r\n$550,000 in claims arising from the shortages in Smith's trust account.\r\n\r\nIn July 2000, the operation of video poker machines became illegal in South\r\nCarolina. Proctor admitted she was aware her use of the video poker machines was\r\nillegal. Pizza Man and Rockaways continued to operate video poker machines in\r\n\r\n\r\n1 To the extent Appellants appeal the circuit court's denial of their motion for \n\r\nsummary judgment, we decline to address this issue because orders denying \n\r\nsummary judgment are not appealable. See Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, \n\r\nInc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003) (\"[T]he denial of a motion for \n\r\nsummary judgment is not appealable, even after final judgment.\"). \n\r\n2 Appellants Forrest Whitlark and Paul Whitlark are part owners of Whitlark & \n\r\nWhitlark, Inc. d/b/a Pizza Man and Rockaways (collectively, Whitlarks). \n\r\nAppellants Charlie E. Bishop and Brett Blanks co-owned Zodiac Distributing, \n\r\nLLC, which owned one of the video poker machines in Pizza Man.\n\r\n3 At the time, Trans-Union was named Atlantic Title Insurance Company. \n\r\n\ntheir establishments until a Federal Bureau of Investigation sting operation in\r\n2005.\r\n\r\nOn September 10, 2007, Proctor entered into a plea agreement with federal\r\nprosecutors and pled guilty to mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341. In addition,\r\nProctor agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $565,475.25 to Trans-Union and\r\n$195,000 to Smith.\r\n\r\nProctor and Trans-Union brought the instant action against Appellants to recover\r\nthe losses they incurred as the result of Proctor's gambling. Specifically, Proctor\r\nand Trans-Union asserted claims for unjust enrichment, violations of the South\r\nCarolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA), and civil conspiracy. Appellants\r\nfiled a motion for summary judgment, arguing the doctrine of in pari delicto barred\r\nProctor's claims and challenging Trans-Union's standing. In addition, Proctor\r\nmoved for partial summary judgment against the Whitlarks on the issue of liability.\r\nThe circuit court found Trans-Union lacked standing to bring the action and\r\ngranted Appellants' motion for summary judgment on Proctor's unjust enrichment\r\nclaim based on their unclean hands defense. However, the circuit court found that\r\nthe doctrine of in pari delicto has been abrogated in South Carolina with regard to\r\ngambling losses. Accordingly, the circuit court granted Proctor's motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment on the issue of liability against the Whitlarks and denied\r\nAppellants' motion for summary judgment based on the in pari delicto defense.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting Proctor's partial motion for\r\nsummary judgment. Specifically, Appellants contend the circuit court erred in\r\nfinding that the doctrine of in pari delicto has been abrogated in South Carolina\r\nwith regard to losses sustained in illegal gambling. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The common-law defense at issue in this case derives from the Latin, in pari\r\ndelicto potior est conditio defendentis: 'In a case of equal or mutual fault . . . the\r\nposition of the [defending] party . . . is the better one.'\" Bateman Eichler, Hill\r\nRichards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299, 306 (1985) (alterations in original); see\r\nalso Myatt v. RHBT Fin. Corp., 370 S.C. 391, 395, 635 S.E.2d 545, 547 (Ct. App.\r\n2006) (\"The doctrine of in pari delicto is the principle that a plaintiff who has\r\nparticipated in wrongdoing may not recover damages resulting from the\r\nwrongdoing.\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). South Carolina\r\ncourts have previously applied the in pari delicto doctrine in certain cases\r\n\ninvolving illegal gambling. See, e.g., Rice v. Gist, 32 S.C.L. (1 Strob.) 82, 85\r\n(1846) (\"[A]ll wagers are unlawful, and not to be recovered in courts of justice.\"\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). However, section 32-1-10 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2007), which was originally adopted in 1712 as a part of the\r\nStatutes of Anne, explicitly allows the recovery of gambling losses in excess of\r\nfifty dollars. Specifically, section 32-1-10 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n             Any person who shall at any time or sitting, by playing at\r\n             cards, dice table or any other game whatsoever or by\r\n             betting on the sides or hands of such as do play at any of\r\n             the games aforesaid, lose to any person or persons . . . in\r\n             the whole, the sum or value of fifty dollars and shall pay\r\n             or deliver such sum or value or any part thereof shall be\r\n             at liberty, within three months . . . to sue for and recover\r\n             the money . . . from the respective winner or winners\r\n             thereof, with costs of suit, by action to be prosecuted in\r\n             any court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if a person who lost money gambling does not bring suit pursuant to\r\nsection 32-1-10 within three months of the gambling loss, section 32-1-20 allows\r\nany person to bring suit against the winner for treble damages within one year of\r\nthe date of the loss. See S.C. Code Ann. § 32-1-20 (2007) (\"In case any person\r\nwho shall lose such money . . . shall not, within the time aforesaid, . . . sue and\r\nwith effect prosecute for the money or other things so by him or them lost and paid\r\nand delivered as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for any other person . . . to sue for and\r\nrecover the same and treble the value thereof, with costs of suit, against such\r\nwinner or winners as aforesaid . . . .\").\r\n\r\nThis court and our supreme court have recognized in more recent cases that\r\nsections 32-1-10 and -20 \"promote a policy which prevents a gambler from\r\nallowing his vice to overcome his ability to pay\" and \"protect a citizen and his\r\nfamily from the gambler's uncontrollable impulses.\" Johnson v. Collins Entm't\r\nCo., 349 S.C. 613, 635, 564 S.E.2d 653, 664-65 (2002) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted); see also McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441, 444, 481 S.E.2d 166, 168 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997) (\"The purpose of [section 32-1-10] is to punish excessive gaming and\r\nto prevent a gambler from allowing his vice to overcome his ability to pay.\"). In\r\nJohnson, the plaintiffs, a group of habitual gamblers, brought suit to recover losses\r\nthey sustained on video poker machines owned or operated by the defendants. 349\r\nS.C. at 621 & n.1, 564 S.E.2d at 657 & n.1. Specifically, the plaintiffs asserted\r\ncauses of action under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act,\r\n\nSCUTPA, and sections 32-1-10 and -20 of the South Carolina Code. Id. at 621,\r\n564 S.E.2d at 657. When the Johnson plaintiffs filed their suit in 1997, the\r\noperation and use of video poker machines were generally legal in South Carolina.\r\nId. at 633, 564 S.E.2d at 664. However, the Johnson plaintiffs alleged that the\r\ndefendants operated their machines in a manner that violated state law, such as\r\noffering the possibility of payouts in excess of $125. Id. at 621-31, 564 S.E.2d at\r\n657-63.\r\n\r\nIn Johnson, the supreme court rejected the argument that section 32-1-10 provides\r\nthe exclusive remedy to recover gambling losses and explicitly recognized that a\r\nplaintiff may also seek to recover gambling losses pursuant to SCUTPA. Id. at\r\n634-35, 564 S.E.2d at 664-65. In addition, the court declined to apply the\r\ndefendants' in pari delicto defense to the plaintiffs' SCUTPA claim. Id. at 639\r\nn.13, 564 S.E.2d at 639 n.13. The court reasoned, in part, that because the\r\noperators of the video poker machines were operating in a regulated area of the\r\nlaw, they should \"be held to a greater knowledge and understanding of the laws\r\nthan their customers, particularly where the laws are designed to protect the player\r\nfrom his or her own bad judgment.\" Id.\r\n\r\nBased upon the supreme court's holding in Johnson, we find the circuit court did\r\nnot err in rejecting Appellants' in pari delicto defense. We acknowledge the facts\r\nof the instant case are distinguishable from those in Johnson because video poker\r\ngambling was illegal when Proctor suffered her losses. Nevertheless, three tenets\r\nrecognized by the supreme court in Johnson are instructive to our analysis and lead\r\nto the same conclusion that the in pari delicto defense does not bar Proctor's\r\nclaims. First, statutory and case law in South Carolina support the policy of\r\nallowing plaintiffs to recover gambling losses as a way of both discouraging illegal\r\ngambling and of protecting gamblers and their family members from imprudent\r\ngambling activities. See Johnson, 349 S.C. at 635, 564 S.C. at 664-65 (noting that\r\nsections 32-1-10 and -20 promote a policy of limiting excessive and/or unlawful\r\ngambling); S.C. Code Ann. §§ 32-1-10, -20. Second, the owners and operators of\r\nvideo poker machines are not truly in pari delicto with the persons who use the\r\nmachines for gambling because in many cases, a habitual gambler is acting under\r\nthe sway of \"uncontrollable impulses\" and, thus, requires protection from his or her\r\nbad judgment. See Johnson, 349 S.C. at 635, 564 S.C. at 664-65. Finally,\r\nsections 32-1-10 and -20 are not the exclusive avenues for plaintiffs to recover\r\ngambling losses and do not preclude plaintiffs from seeking recovery under other\r\nstate law theories, including SCUTPA. See Johnson, 349 S.C. at 635, 564 S.E.2d\r\nat 665 (noting that sections 32-1-10 & and -20 do not preclude plaintiffs from\r\nrecovering gambling losses under other remedies provided by law, including\r\n\nSCUTPA). We find these tenets espoused by the supreme court in Johnson\r\nsupport the circuit court's holding that the defense of in pari delicto does not bar\r\nProctor's claims.4\r\n\r\nCourts in other jurisdictions have similarly found that the in pari delicto defense\r\ndoes not bar the recovery of illegal gambling losses. For example, in O'Neil v.\r\nCrampton, 140 P.2d 308 (Wash. 1943), the Washington Supreme Court employed\r\na similar approach and explained the policy reasons for declining to apply the\r\ndoctrine to gambling losses. The court acknowledged the general rule that \"one\r\ncannot establish a right and invoke a remedy if he himself is a wrongdoer . . . .\"\r\nId. at 310. Nevertheless, the court found that a Washington statute providing for a\r\ncivil remedy to recover money lost while engaged in gambling\r\n\r\n             was a declaration of public policy based upon the idea\r\n             that, if gambling is to be discouraged, one way in which\r\n             it might be done would be to permit recovery by the loser\r\n             and at the same time protect those inclined to gamble\r\n             against their weakness and improvidence,\r\n             notwithstanding that the loser was [in pari delicto] with\r\n             the winner.\r\n\r\nId. The court noted that the fact that the gambler was engaged in an illegal activity\r\nshould not preclude recovery because the statute criminalizing gambling was \"but\r\nanother attempt to discourage gambling.\" Id. at 311. The basis of allowing the\r\nrecovery of losses sustained by illegal gambling \"is that not only is the individual\r\nprotected, but it is also a protection to the public, which is even more important,\r\nand this would be made more effective by allowing a recovery.\" Id. at 310; see\r\nalso Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Price, 105 F. Supp. 2d 46, 53\r\n(E.D.N.Y. 2000) (noting that the New York legislature passed a law allowing the\r\nrecovery of gambling losses because the common law rule applying the doctrine of\r\nin pari delicto to such losses \"did little to help effectuate the purposes of the\r\ngambling prohibitions, which were adopted with a view toward protecting the\r\nfamily man of meager resources from his own imprudence at the gambling tables\"\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc., 472\r\nU.S. at 306-07 (noting that \"[i]n its classic formulation, the in pari delicto defense\r\nwas narrowly limited to situations where the plaintiff truly bore at least\r\n\r\n4 Moreover, we are not persuaded by the cases cited by Appellants in support of\r\ntheir claim that in pari delicto applies based on the factual dissimilarities and more\r\nrecent pronouncements of the supreme court.\r\n\nsubstantially equal responsibility for his injury, because in cases where both parties\r\nare [in delicto], concurring in an illegal act, it does not always follow that they\r\nstand [in pari delicto]; for there may be, and often are, very different degrees in\r\ntheir guilt\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\nBased on this case and statutory law and for the reasons set forth above, we find\r\nthe circuit court did not err in granting Proctor's motion for summary judgment on\r\nthe issue of liability against the Whitlarks. As noted by the supreme court in\r\nJohnson, statutory and case law in South Carolina support a policy of allowing\r\nplaintiffs to recover gambling losses as a way of both discouraging illegal\r\ngambling and of protecting gamblers and their family members from imprudent\r\ngambling activities. 349 S.C. at 635, 564 S.E.2d at 664-65. We hold that with\r\nrespect to gambling losses under the circumstances of the instant case, the doctrine\r\nof in pari delicto has been abrogated for reasons of public policy and does not bar\r\nthe recovery of such losses. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's order\r\ngranting Proctor's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order granting Proctor's motion for\r\nsummary judgment on the issue of liability against the Whitlarks is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5132","title":"State v.

He argues the trial court\r\nerred in: (1) failing to direct a verdict in his favor on the charge of aiding and\r\nabetting; (2) failing to charge the jury that the State had to prove Lewis had a legal\r\nduty to protect Audrina Hepburn (Victim) before he could be convicted of aiding\r\n\nand abetting; (3) not granting a mistrial after a witness testified a statement by\r\nLewis had \"the possibility of guilt behind it\"; and (4) not requiring the State to\r\nopen fully on the law and the facts. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nLewis began dating Ashley Hepburn, mother of Victim, in early 2009. Hepburn\r\nwas separated from her husband, with whom she had two children, Victim and\r\nOwen.1 Hepburn and her children lived with her mother, Doris Davis, and Davis's\r\nboyfriend, David Crumley.\r\n\r\nAround 3:30 p.m. on October 12, 2009, Lewis stopped at Hepburn's home on his\r\nway back from class at Piedmont Technical College. Lewis stated Hepburn was\r\nupset about a withdrawn job offer, and they had an argument that was initially\r\nplayful, but resulted in her slapping Lewis. Lewis left Hepburn's home after their\r\nfight and went to his grandmother's home, where he lived. However, he returned\r\nto Hepburn's home around 8:30 p.m. Davis and Crumley had retired to bed for the\r\nnight when he returned. Hepburn told Lewis she was extremely tired and would\r\nnot be good company, but he did not leave.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the evening, Owen accidentally hit Lewis while they were\r\nplaying and then refused to apologize to Lewis. Lewis told Hepburn if Owen did\r\nnot listen to her now, he was never going to listen to her, and a fight ensued about\r\nher parenting skills. Subsequently, Hepburn and Lewis began putting the children\r\nto bed. It took two attempts to put Victim to sleep because she was fussy. Then\r\nOwen refused to brush his teeth, and Hepburn spanked him, causing him to cry.\r\nLewis said he felt responsible and guilty for the spanking because of his comments\r\nto Hepburn earlier, and so he went to the living room by himself to watch football.\r\nHepburn went to her room with Owen where they laid in bed.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, Lewis checked on Victim and did not see anything out of the\r\nordinary. He then went to Hepburn's room and asked if she wanted to watch a\r\nmovie, but she declined. While watching the movie alone in the living room,\r\nLewis heard Victim cry and thereafter heard Hepburn stomp down the hall to\r\nVictim's room. Victim continued crying for a few minutes before stopping. Lewis\r\ndescribed the crying as being broken up with short pauses, \"like she could have\r\n\r\n1 On the date of the incident, Victim was sixteen months old, and Owen was almost\r\nthree years old.\r\n\nbeen shaken,\" but in that moment he did not think anything had happened to\r\nVictim. After Hepburn returned to her room, Lewis went to her and asked if she\r\nwanted any food, but she did not, so he ate by himself and prepared for bed. He\r\nchecked on Victim once more, but this time he noticed she was in an unusual\r\nposition, facedown with her head against the bars of the crib. When he picked her\r\nup, he noticed she was not breathing properly and had blood around her mouth. He\r\ncarried Victim into Hepburn's room and Hepburn took her from him. Davis and\r\nCrumley awoke to Lewis's and Hepburn's cries, and Crumley called 911. When\r\nquestioned by Crumley, Lewis explained he had found Victim unresponsive and\r\nbelieved she had a seizure. His opinion stemmed from his personal experience\r\nwith a seizure condition that resulted in his discharge from the navy.\r\n\r\nParamedics arrived at Hepburn's home around 1:40 a.m. and transported Victim to\r\nSelf Regional Hospital (Self Regional). Dr. Michelle Curry suspected a brain\r\ninjury, which was confirmed by a CAT scan. She also suspected the brain injury\r\nwas caused by shaking, and the Laurens County Sheriff's Office (Sheriff's Office)\r\nand the Department of Social Services (DSS) were notified. Lewis told Dr. Curry\r\nhe found Victim unresponsive but did not tell her Hepburn had stomped into\r\nVictim's room shortly before his discovery. Hepburn was present during his\r\nexplanation to Dr. Curry, but she also stated Victim was simply found limp and\r\nunresponsive in her crib. Victim was transferred to Greenville Memorial Hospital\r\nwhere a pediatrician, Robert Seigler, determined the symptoms from her severe\r\ninjury would have been immediately noticeable. Victim survived for three more\r\ndays before being removed from life support and passing away.\r\n\r\nAround 6:20 a.m. the morning of the incident, Lewis accepted law enforcement's\r\nrequest to come by the Sheriff's Office, and he gave a statement to Officer Ben\r\nBlackmon and other officers. In his initial statement, he did not mention hearing\r\nHepburn's loud footsteps down the hall prior to discovering Victim's condition; he\r\nsimply said he found Victim unresponsive. Additionally, he did not tell the\r\nofficers about his argument with Hepburn earlier in the night that resulted in her\r\nslapping him. Lewis testified that at the time of the initial statement, he did not\r\nwant to get Hepburn in trouble and did not believe Hepburn would do anything to\r\nhurt Victim. After his initial statement, he spoke with his grandmother, who urged\r\nhim to tell the officers anything he knew about the case. Lewis then gave officers\r\na second statement and explained he had heard Victim crying followed by\r\nHepburn's loud footsteps and then louder crying from Victim, \"as if she was being\r\nshaken.\"\r\n\nHepburn also spoke with law enforcement within approximately twelve hours of\r\nVictim entering the Greenville Hospital, and in her initial interview with South\r\nCarolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) agent, Casey Kirkland, she did not\r\nindicate Lewis was involved in Victim's injuries. Hepburn stated Lewis was\r\n\"watching TV during all of this,\" and she was asleep, except for the two times she\r\nwas awakened by Lewis, first asking about food and then with Victim in his arms.\r\nAt trial, Hepburn implicated Lewis, asserting Lewis was the only person who\r\ncould have harmed Victim. However, she conceded she never heard a sound, and\r\nshe did not know Victim was hurt until Lewis brought Victim to her.\r\n\r\nOfficer Robert Plaxico, from the Sheriff's Office, also spoke with Hepburn and\r\nshowed her Lewis's second statement. Officer Plaxico stated that when shown the\r\nstatement, she said, \"[O]h my god all of this is true but I don't remember hurting\r\nmy baby.\" However, she explained her exclamation pertained to putting Owen to\r\nbed and the difficulty she had brushing his teeth because Lewis's statement was\r\naccurate in that respect. Officer Plaxico stated Hepburn never implicated Lewis\r\nduring her interview with him.\r\n\r\nOfficer Plaxico visited Lewis's grandmother's home a couple of days after the\r\nincident, and when he arrived, Lewis ran out the back door. However, Lewis\r\nreturned a couple of minutes later and told Plaxico he ran because he thought he\r\nwas going to be arrested. Lewis was unable to give Plaxico any further\r\ninformation, and Plaxico left the home. A few days later, Lewis was admitted to\r\nthe Laurens County Hospital for a suicide attempt. Lewis was not arrested until\r\nSeptember 18, 2010, when he was charged with homicide by child abuse and\r\naiding and abetting.\r\n\r\nLewis and Hepburn were tried jointly on February 22, 2011. The State introduced\r\nAlexander Brown, Self Regional's chaplain, as a witness, and he testified his\r\nposition required him to serve as a caretaker, \"emotionally, spiritually, and\r\nmentally,\" for patients and their families. Brown testified that during his time with\r\nVictim's family, Lewis stated Victim \"didn't like him but he loved her.\" Brown\r\nthought Lewis's statement was odd, and it caused him concern. Hepburn's counsel\r\nasked Brown why he thought the comment was odd, and Lewis's counsel objected\r\non the basis that Brown was not qualified as an expert, and it was speculative. The\r\ntrial court asked for a foundation to explain \"how long [Brown] worked [at Self\r\nRegional] or something like that.\" Brown testified he had two years of seminary\r\neducation, which included activities such as analyzing conversations he had with\r\npatients to see \"why we ask what we ask and what flags might have been drawn by\r\n\nthings that [the patients] have said.\" When Hepburn's counsel asked Brown again\r\nwhy Lewis's comment caused him concern, Lewis's counsel objected to it as\r\nspeculative. The trial court overruled the objection, stating the answer was being\r\nreceived for the purpose of showing Brown's reaction to that moment and stated\r\nLewis's counsel was welcome to cross-examine Brown on the issue. Brown\r\nanswered that Lewis's comment \"appeared to be a statement that had the possibility\r\nof having guilt behind it.\" Lewis's counsel objected once again, and the objection\r\nwas sustained. Lewis moved for a mistrial, arguing Brown had testified as to his\r\nopinion that Lewis was guilty, which he maintained was far beyond anything\r\nadmissible in court. The trial court gave the jury a curative instruction instead of\r\ngranting a mistrial.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the State's case, Lewis asked for a directed verdict on both charges,\r\nwhich was denied by the trial court. Lewis renewed his directed verdict motion on\r\nthe charge of aiding and abetting at the close of the trial, and the trial court again\r\ndenied it. On March 3, 2011, the jury found Lewis guilty of aiding and abetting\r\nhomicide by child abuse, but acquitted him on the charge of homicide by child\r\nabuse. The jury found Hepburn guilty of homicide by child abuse. The trial court\r\nsentenced Lewis to ten years, suspended upon service of seven years, and\r\nsentenced Hepburn to forty-five years.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDirected Verdict on the Charge of Aiding and Abetting\r\n\r\nLewis contends the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion because\r\nthe State presented no evidence to support the charge of aiding and abetting. We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, this court must view the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the State, and if there is any direct evidence\r\nor any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\nthe accused, we must find that the case was properly submitted to the jury.\" State\r\nv.

Smith, the victim passed away from severe injuries sustained by abuse.\r\n359 S.C. 481, 486-87, 597 S.E.2d 888, 891-92 (Ct. App. 2004). The two\r\ndefendants, the victim's mother and the mother's boyfriend, were tried together on\r\ncharges of homicide by child abuse and aiding and abetting. Id. at 488, 597 S.E.2d\r\nat 892. The jury found each defendant guilty of both charges. Id. The mother's\r\nboyfriend appealed his conviction, arguing the trial court should have granted his\r\ndirected verdict motion on his charge of aiding and abetting. Id. at 490, 597 S.E.2d\r\nat 893. On appeal, this court noted that in their statements to investigators both\r\ndefendants indicated they were never separated from each other or the victim\r\nduring the time when her injuries occurred. Id. at 491, 597 S.E.2d at 894. Medical\r\ntestimony established the injury was unquestionably the result of child abuse. Id.\r\nat 492, 597 S.E.2d at 894. We found the statute made it clear \"child abuse may be\r\ncommitted by either an act or an omission which causes harm to a child's physical\r\nhealth.\" Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-85(B)(1) (2003)) (emphasis omitted).\r\nThis court then determined\r\n\r\n             [g]iven the evidence on the severity and number of\r\n             injuries to [the victim], the fact that both [the mother and\r\n             the mother's boyfriend] were the only adults with [the\r\n             victim] during the time frame that she received her\r\n             injuries and were the only people who could have\r\n             possibly caused her injuries, the evidence that her\r\n             impairment should have been obvious to these two\r\n             adults, along with the evidence of possible cover-up, . . .\r\n             there was sufficient evidence of an act or omission by\r\n             [the mother's boyfriend] wherein he inflicted or allowed\r\n             to be inflicted physical harm to [the victim] resulting in\r\n             [the victim's] death.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\nIn the present case, both Lewis and Hepburn assert they were in separate rooms\r\nduring the time of the incident and not within eyesight of each other. Hepburn\r\nclaimed she was asleep during the incident, and Lewis claimed he was in the living\r\nroom watching the television. We believe this is an important distinction from\r\nSmith. Hepburn's and Lewis's statements to investigators and testimony implicate\r\none or the other as having committed homicide by child abuse. Lewis stated he\r\nwas in the living room and simply heard Hepburn walk loudly into Victim's room,\r\nat which point he heard Victim's crying eventually stop. He testified he\r\nsubsequently discovered the Victim's abnormal condition when checking on her.\r\nHepburn claimed she never went into Victim's room after placing her in the crib\r\nfor the second time, and she asserted Lewis was the only person who could have\r\nharmed Victim that night.\r\n\r\nThe record does not contain any evidence to support this conviction. The State\r\nargues because Lewis instigated, abetted, and witnessed Hepburn's spanking of\r\nOwen, and then \"witnessed Hepburn's disciplinary outburst against her infant\r\ndaughter,\" he \"knew then what he knew later.\" First, there is no evidence to\r\nsupport the claim that Lewis witnessed Hepburn discipline her infant daughter.\r\nSecond, we disagree with the State's contention that because he witnessed Hepburn\r\nspank Owen earlier in the night, he knew Hepburn was going to abuse Victim.\r\nEven if Lewis did have prior knowledge Hepburn was going to commit a crime,\r\nwithout more, that was insufficient to constitute guilt. See Wilson v. Wilson, 319\r\nS.C. 370, 373, 461 S.E.2d 816, 817 (1995).\r\n\r\nNext, the State argues Lewis can be held liable as an aider or abettor for his failure\r\nto act—specifically, his failure to enter Victim's room and stop any abuse after\r\nhearing her crying. However, an overt act is required to be held liable for aiding\r\nand abetting, which necessarily excludes the possibility of being held liable for a\r\nfailure to act. See State v. Mattison, 388 S.C. 469, 479, 697 S.E.2d 578, 584\r\n(2010). Thus, his failure to act, assuming he knew a crime was occurring, cannot\r\nsuffice as evidence of aiding and abetting. In the present case, any other finding\r\nwould nullify the mere presence charge. See 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law § 172\r\n(2008) (explaining \"there normally must be some evidence that the reason that the\r\naccused is present is to further the criminal intent of the perpetrator\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, the State must also present evidence of the requisite mental state for the\r\ncharge of aiding and abetting, which the statute provides is \"knowingly.\" See 21\r\nAm. Jur. 2d Criminal Law § 131 (2008) (stating the term knowingly, as used in\r\ncriminal statutes, \"imports that an accused person knew what he or she was\r\n\ndoing\"). In Smith, the defendants indicated they were never apart during the\r\nweekend, and the mother's boyfriend further admitted witnessing the victim's\r\nresulting side effects from the abuse, yet did not tell medical personnel. 359 S.C.\r\nat 491-92, 597 S.E.2d at 894. Thus, the court found the evidence was sufficient to\r\nestablish to a jury that he knowingly aided and abetted in the crime. Id. at 492, 597\r\nS.E.2d at 894. As we previously stated, the parties here assert they were apart\r\nduring the incident, and Lewis testified the moment he found Victim's condition to\r\nbe odd, he brought her to Hepburn and medical personnel were immediately called.\r\nLewis stated it was only after he was told about the implications of Victim's\r\ninjuries did he realize Victim's sounds that night could have been the result of\r\nsomeone shaking her. Initially, he thought Victim had suffered a seizure. We find\r\nthe State did not present evidence to prove the requisite mental state for aiding and\r\nabetting.\r\n\r\nThe State also asserts Lewis's flight and suicide attempt are sufficient evidence to\r\nwithstand a directed verdict. We disagree with the State's contention under these\r\nfacts. The State did not present any evidence of an overt act or the requisite state\r\nof mind for aiding and abetting, and thus, evidence of flight and a suicide attempt\r\nalone will not suffice to withstand a motion for a directed verdict. See State v.\r\nOdems, 395 S.C. 582, 590, 720 S.E.2d 48, 52 (declining to hold \"that flight alone\r\nis substantial circumstantial evidence of a defendant's guilt\"). Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the trial court.\r\n\r\nBecause we find a directed verdict should have been granted in Lewis's favor, we\r\nneed not address his remaining arguments. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\nGeorgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an\r\nappellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior\r\nissue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find there was no evidence to support the charge of aiding and abetting against\r\nLewis, and a directed verdict should have been granted in Lewis's favor. For the\r\nforegoing reasons, the trial court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I join in the majority opinion except for one sentence:\r\n\"We find the State did not present evidence to prove the requisite mental state for\r\naiding and abetting.\" For two reasons, I would not make that statement. First, the\r\nstatement is unnecessary to the resolution of the appeal, and is therefore dicta,\r\nbecause we found the State presented no evidence that Lewis knew or had reason\r\nto know Hepburn had abused or neglected the victim in time to save the child's life.\r\nThus, there is no evidence that Lewis committed any act to aid or abet Hepburn\r\nwith homicide. Second, the State will almost never have direct evidence of a\r\ndefendant's mental state. Therefore, the law expects that the State will rely on\r\ncircumstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof on this issue. \"[I]ntent is\r\nseldom susceptible to proof by direct evidence and must ordinarily be proven by\r\ncircumstantial evidence, that is, by facts and circumstances from which intent may\r\nbe inferred. Circumstantial evidence alone is often sufficient to show criminal\r\nintent because the element of intent, being a state of mind or mental purpose, is\r\nusually incapable of direct proof.\" State v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 288, 559 S.E.2d\r\n297, 300 (Ct. App. 2001) (Goolsby, J., concurring) (internal citations and\r\nquotations omitted), aff'd but criticized, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004). In\r\nthis case, there is ample circumstantial evidence that would require the trial court\r\nto deny a directed verdict as to Lewis's mental state if the State had proven Lewis\r\nacted to aid or abet.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5084","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn September 13, 2008, at 2:20 a.m., Forrest Johnson, a patrol officer with the\r\nNorth Charleston Police Department, received a call about a shooting in a\r\nresidential neighborhood. Upon arriving at the scene, Johnson noticed the lifeless\r\nbody of a middle-aged male, who was later identified as Scott Yelton. Yelton bled\r\nprofusely on the left side of his face, and a great deal of blood soaked through his\r\nclothes. Johnson learned that Yelton had been involved in a disagreement\r\ninvolving a car and ended up either exiting the car or being forcibly ejected from it.\r\n\r\nAfter examining contact numbers stored in Yelton's telephone, police located\r\nJoshua Wilder at his grandmother's house. Wilder voluntarily went to the police\r\nstation; however, he did not provide truthful information about his involvement in\r\nYelton's death and told police that he was asleep at his girlfriend's house when the\r\nincident occurred.\r\n\r\nThe day after Wilder met with the police, a pistol was found on the premises of\r\nAAA Rentals by Denise Berto, whose family owned the business. Berto gave the\r\npistol to the North Charleston Police Department. Swabs taken from the pistol\r\nwere sent to SLED on October 1, 2008. SLED test-fired the weapon and found it\r\nmatched shell casings found at the scene. In addition, a detective with the North\r\nCharleston Police Department learned that the pistol had been in Taylor's\r\npossession. Both Wilder and Taylor were developed as suspects in the crime.\r\n\r\nIn October 2008, police arrested both Wilder and Taylor in connection with\r\nYelton's death and charged them with murder. While in police custody, Wilder\r\nagreed to cooperate with the authorities. The charges against Wilder regarding his\r\ninvolvement in Yelton's death were then changed to accessory after the fact of\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wilder, he and other drug dealers would give Yelton money or drugs\r\nin exchange for the use of Yelton's truck. During the early morning hours\r\nimmediately preceding Yelton's death, Wilder drove his car, with Taylor in the\r\nfront passenger seat, to Yelton's residence to \"rent the truck.\" Yelton, who was\r\ndrunk and high when he met Wilder and Taylor, told them he had already lent his\r\ntruck to someone else and was waiting for its return. Yelton then got into the back\r\nseat of the car that Wilder was driving and demanded money. Wilder and Taylor\r\nasked Yelton to leave, but Yelton refused.\r\n\nAt trial, Wilder testified that Taylor turned and struck Yelton with a gun in order to\r\nmake him exit the vehicle. Yelton began bleeding, but resisted efforts to pull him\r\nfrom the car. By this time, Yelton's cousin arrived at the scene and attempted\r\nwithout success to extricate Yelton. According to Wilder, Taylor, already worried\r\nabout blood inside the car, \"flipped out\" when Yelton threatened to call the law and\r\nshot Yelton several times after both Taylor and Yelton had exited the car. Taylor\r\nreturned to the passenger seat of the car, and Wilder, in shock from the incident,\r\ndrove away. As they proceeded, Taylor cautioned Wilder to \"keep everything\r\nsilent\" and not to say anything to the police. A few days later, Taylor told Wilder\r\nthat \"he [Taylor] had to throw the gun\" and wanted Wilder to look for it.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, Taylor was indicted for Yelton's murder. His trial took place that\r\nsame month. Wilder appeared as a witness for the State. Taylor did not take the\r\nstand; however, family members testified he was asleep at the time of the shooting.\r\n\r\nThe jury found Taylor guilty of murder, and the trial judge sentenced him to life\r\nimprisonment. Taylor then filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\nI. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Taylor to cross-\r\nexamine Wilder about charges against him that had been dismissed a few months\r\nbefore trial but were pending when Wilder gave a statement implicating Taylor in\r\nYelton's murder?\r\n\r\nII. Should the trial court have excluded a SLED ballistics report on the ground that\r\nit constituted impermissible bolstering of trial testimony?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court \"will not disturb a trial court's ruling concerning the scope of\r\ncross-examination of a witness to test his or her credibility, or to show possible\r\nbias or self-interest in testifying, absent a manifest abuse of discretion.\" State v.\r\nGracely, 399 S.C. 363, 371, 731 S.E.2d 880, 884 (2012). \"A trial judge's decision\r\nregarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence\r\nshould be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.\" State v. Adams, 354 S.C.\r\n361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003). \"We review a trial court's decision\r\nregarding Rule 403, [SCRE] pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are\r\nobligated to give great deference to the trial court's judgment.\" Id. As with any\r\nissue regarding the admissibility of evidence, a trial court's decision to admit\r\nevidence notwithstanding an objection that it amounts to improper bolstering is to\r\n\nbe reviewed on appeal under an abuse of discretion standard. State v. Whitner, 399\r\nS.C. 547, 563, 732 S.E.2d 861, 867 (2012).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.    Cross-Examination Regarding Dismissed Charges\r\n\r\nTaylor first argues the trial court should have allowed him to cross-examine Wilder\r\nabout unrelated charges that were pending against Wilder when Wilder implicated\r\nTaylor in Yelton's murder and about the dismissal of those charges before Taylor's\r\ncase was called to trial. We disagree.\r\n\r\nBefore Wilder's testimony began, both sides agreed that Taylor could cross-\r\nexamine Wilder about prior convictions for breach of trust and shoplifting and that\r\nWilder's convictions for simple possession of marijuana and driving under\r\nsuspension would not be admissible. The trial court also stated it would admit a\r\nconviction for felony possession of cocaine and allow Taylor to (1) question\r\nWilder about his pending charges, including any charges related to the present case\r\nand certain unrelated drug offenses and (2) suggest that Wilder might be testifying\r\nfor the State to obtain a better deal for himself.\r\n\r\nThe only dispute concerned the admissibility of unrelated charges that were\r\npending against Wilder when he agreed to cooperate in prosecuting Taylor for\r\nYelton's murder. The pending charges included three counts of assault with intent\r\nto kill, one count of discharging a firearm into a car, and two counts of unlawful\r\npossession of a gun. These charges were dismissed in May 2009 by the same\r\nsolicitor who was prosecuting Taylor in the present case. Taylor argued the\r\ndismissals were probative of Wilder's bias, further noting the disposition sheet said\r\nonly that the charges were \"nol prossed in the interest of justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe solicitor opposed allowing Taylor to question Wilder about the May 2009\r\ndismissals or the corresponding charges, stating he dropped the charges because\r\nthey were old and the lead officer on the cases had been arrested and indicted. The\r\nsolicitor further advised the trial court that Wilder would testify that no promises or\r\nthreats had been made to influence his testimony. Although Taylor offered to\r\nstipulate that the officer had been arrested and the arrest may have been a reason\r\nfor the dismissals, the solicitor refused to agree to the stipulation, explaining he\r\n\"cut these cases loose\" as soon as the officer was indicted and the dismissals were\r\nnot part of any deal with Wilder.\r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled Taylor could not impeach Wilder with the dismissed charges.\r\nIn so ruling, the court stated the information was unfairly prejudicial. The court\r\n\nfurther found that neither the charges nor their dismissals were related to the\r\npresent case; therefore, to allow information about them was likely to confuse the\r\njury and require the solicitor to testify under oath about his reasons for dismissal.\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 403, SCRE, relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value\r\nis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\r\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time,\r\nor needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"1 We agree with the trial court\r\nthat the probative value of the information that Taylor sought to elicit from Wilder\r\ndid not justify making the solicitor take the stand to testify about his reasons for\r\ndismissing the charges.2 The probative value of the information in dispute was\r\nlimited at best. Other than the fact that the charges were dismissed after Wilder\r\nimplicated Taylor, there was no evidence linking the dismissals to Wilder's\r\ndecision to cooperate with the police. To the contrary, the record indicates Wilder\r\ngave a statement against Taylor soon after his arrest, but the unrelated charges\r\npending against him were not dismissed until several months later. Furthermore,\r\nTaylor was allowed to impeach Wilder on other felony charges that were still\r\npending as well as on certain prior convictions; thus, he already had the means to\r\nattack Wilder's credibility and emphasize his motive to testify untruthfully.\r\nBalancing the limited probative value of the information against the possible\r\nconfusion of the issues that would arise from requiring the solicitor to testify under\r\noath about why he dismissed the charges and the delay that would result if such\r\ntestimony required a substitution of counsel for the State, we hold the trial court\r\nacted within its discretion in refusing to allow Taylor to question Wilder about\r\nthem.3\r\n\r\n\r\n1At oral argument, counsel for both sides agreed that a determination of this issue\r\nshould be analyzed under Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n2As the State notes in its brief, the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct\r\nallow a lawyer to act as an advocate in a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a\r\nnecessary witness only in certain limited circumstances, none of which are\r\napplicable here. Rule 3.7, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n3 We are aware that in the recent decision of State v. Gracely, 399 S.C. 363, 374-\r\n75, 731 S.E.2d 880, 886 (2012), the Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed and\r\nremanded the defendant's conviction, holding \"[t]he fact that a cooperating witness\r\navoided a mandatory minimum sentence is critical information that a defendant\r\nmust be allowed to present to the jury.\" (emphasis in original). In Gracely,\r\n\nII.   Admissibility of SLED Ballistics Report\r\n\r\nTaylor also challenges the admission of a SLED report, arguing it constituted\r\nimpermissible bolstering of the trial testimony of the SLED firearm and tool-mark\r\nexaminer. We find no error.4\r\n\r\nThe State called Suzanne Cromer, a SLED firearm and tool-mark examiner.\r\nCromer examined seven fired cartridge casings, four fired bullets, and the pistol\r\nfound by Berto. The pistol had four unfired .40 S&W cartridges. Cromer testified\r\nthe unfired rounds were the same brand as the fired cartridge casings, but she\r\nultimately determined only that she could not rule out the pistol as the firearm from\r\nwhich the fired projectiles were shot. After Cromer testified about these results,\r\nthe State offered her report, Exhibit 40, into evidence. Taylor objected, arguing\r\nthat Cromer already testified about the results and the report would be either\r\ncumulative or impermissible bolstering. The trial court overruled Taylor's\r\nobjections and admitted the report.\r\n\r\nBased on further testing, Cromer also determined that the seven fired cartridge\r\ncasings were fired from the pistol. The State offered the corresponding report,\r\nExhibit 41, into evidence, and Taylor objected to this evidence on the ground that\r\nit was cumulative or impermissible bolstering. The trial court admitted the report\r\nover Taylor's objection as well.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Taylor argues \"the SLED report constituted impermissible bolstering\r\nof [Cromer's] testimony because it unduly emphasized her ballistics opinion, which\r\n\r\nhowever, it appears undisputed that the minimum sentences avoided by the\r\ncooperating witnesses were for charges that were reduced in exchange for those\r\nwitnesses' cooperation with the State.\r\n4 As noted in the opinion, the State proffered two reports prepared by Suzanne\r\nCromer, its firearm and tool-mark identification examiner. Exhibit 40 noted only\r\nthat the pistol could not be excluded as the weapon from which the fired projectiles\r\nwere shot, and Exhibit 41 contained Cromer's findings that the seven fired\r\ncartridge casings came from the pistol. The State contends that Taylor purports to\r\nchallenge the admission of only Exhibit 40, but gives record citations\r\ncorresponding to Exhibit 41 and suggests that for this reason, we should hold the\r\nargument unpreserved for appeal. Based on our reading of Taylor's brief, we find\r\nthat Taylor is challenging the admission of Exhibit 41 and that he has preserved\r\nthis issue for appeal.\r\n\nremained her opinion about the critical 'match' of the gun that was found where\r\n[Taylor] told his friends it would be found.\" (emphasis in original). We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Improper bolstering occurs when an expert witness is allowed to give his or her\r\nopinion as to whether the complaining witness is telling the truth, because that is\r\nan ultimate issue of fact and the inference to be drawn is not beyond the ken of the\r\naverage juror.\" State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 521, 626 S.E.2d 59, 71 (Ct. App.\r\n2006), rev'd in part on other grounds, 380 S.C. 499, 671 S.E.2d 606 (2009).\r\nGenerally, the prohibition against bolstering is for the purpose of preventing a\r\nwitness from testifying whether another witness is telling the truth and to maintain\r\n\"the assessment of witness credibility . . . within the exclusive province of the\r\njury.\" State v. McKerley, 397 S.C. 461, 464, 725 S.E.2d 139, 141 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\nHere, Cromer's report was relevant to her own testimony, not that of any other\r\nwitness. Nor did the report vouch for her credibility; rather, it was a written\r\nrepresentation of the findings on which her opinions and testimony were based.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Taylor to\r\ncross-examine Wilder about the pending charges against him that were dismissed\r\nafter Wilder agreed to cooperate with the State. We also affirm the trial court's\r\nadmission of the SLED report documenting the link between Taylor's pistol and\r\nthe cartridge casings found at the crime scene.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5134","title":"Richardson v.

Player, Jr., of Player & McMillan, LLC, of\r\n            Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: Cynthia Richardson appeals the circuit court's reversal of the\r\nmagistrate court's denial of Piggly Wiggly Central, Inc.'s motion for judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 11, 2008, Richardson went to Piggly Wiggly. It was\r\nraining as she entered the store. Richardson purchased a loaf of bread and was\r\n\nleaving when she slipped on the wet concrete outside of the store. She suffered\r\npain to her right knee and back.\r\n\r\nRichardson filed an action in magistrate's court alleging Piggly Wiggly was\r\nnegligent for failing to warn of the dangerous condition created by the rain on the\r\nsidewalk. At trial, Richardson testified she slipped outside of the store. She\r\ndescribed the flooring inside Piggly Wiggly as tile and outside as concrete. When\r\nasked, she specifically stated she slipped on the concrete. At the close of\r\nRichardson's case, Piggly Wiggly moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that\r\nRichardson failed to present any evidence the store had created an unsafe\r\ncondition. The magistrate denied the motion. The jury found Piggly Wiggly\r\nnegligent and awarded Richardson $3,870 in damages. Piggly Wiggly filed a\r\nJNOV motion, which the magistrate denied.\r\n\r\nPiggly Wiggly appealed. The circuit court reversed the denial of the JNOV\r\nmotion, finding Richardson slipped outside of the store and the mere fact she\r\nslipped was not evidence of an unreasonably dangerous condition. Richardson\r\nfiled a motion for reconsideration, which the circuit court denied. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a magistrate's decision, the circuit court is not bound by the lower\r\ncourt's findings of fact. Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 490, 548\r\nS.E.2d 605, 608 (Ct. App. 2001). The circuit court must give judgment according\r\nto the justice of the case. S.C. Code Ann. § 18-7-170 (1985).\r\n\r\nA motion for a JNOV is merely a renewal of the directed verdict motion. Wright v.\r\nCraft, 372 S.C. 1, 20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 496 (Ct. App. 2006). When reviewing the\r\ncircuit court's ruling on a motion for a directed verdict or a JNOV, this court must\r\napply the same standard as the circuit court by viewing the evidence and all\r\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Elam v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004). The circuit\r\ncourt must deny a motion for a directed verdict or JNOV if the evidence yields\r\nmore than one reasonable inference or its inference is in doubt. Strange v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440\r\n(1994). Moreover, \"[a] motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable\r\njury could have reached the challenged verdict.\" Gastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C.\r\n565, 568, 503 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1998). In deciding such motions, neither the trial\r\n\ncourt nor the appellate court has the authority to decide credibility issues or to\r\nresolve conflicts in the testimony or the evidence. Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279,\r\n300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 419 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nRichardson contends the circuit court erred in granting JNOV. She maintains\r\nbecause she was an invitee, Piggly Wiggly owed her a duty to keep its premises\r\nreasonably safe. She alleges it breached that duty by failing to warn of a\r\ndangerous condition of which it had actual or constructive knowledge. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a merchant owes a customer a duty of ordinary care to keep his\r\npremises in a reasonably safe condition. Wimberley v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc.,\r\n252 S.C. 117, 120-21,165 S.E.2d 627, 628 (1969) (\"[O]ne who operates a store is\r\nnot an insurer of the safety of its customers, the duty owed them is rather the duty\r\nof exercising ordinary care to keep parts of the store as are ordinarily used by\r\ncustomers in a reasonably safe condition.\"). However, \"[a] possessor of land is not\r\nliable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition\r\non the land whose danger is known or obvious to them, unless the possessor should\r\nanticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.\" Callander v.\r\nCharleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C. 123, 126, 406 S.E.2d 361, 362 (1991)\r\n(emphasis omitted).\r\n\r\nAt trial, Richardson testified she knew it was raining when she entered Piggly\r\nWiggly. The fact that the sidewalk was wet and slippery when she left the store\r\nshould have been apparent. In a similar case, the Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nheld an owner did not have a duty to warn an invitee about the danger of wet grass\r\n\"because it was a natural condition, the peril of which was obvious. In contrast, a\r\nlatent defect is one which an owner has, or should have, knowledge of, and of\r\nwhich an invitee is reasonably unaware. It is one which a reasonably careful\r\ninspection will not reveal.\" Meadows v. Heritage Vill. Church & Missionary\r\nFellowship, Inc., 305 S.C. 375, 378, 409 S.E.2d 349, 351 (1991).\r\n\r\nPiggly Wiggly did not breach its duty to provide reasonably safe premises.\r\nFurthermore, Richardson's testimony conclusively shows she slipped on the ground\r\noutside of the store and she knew it was raining and the sidewalk was uncovered.\r\nWhen viewed in a light most favorable to Richardson, she presented no evidence\r\nPiggly Wiggly was negligent.\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5135","title":"MicroClean Technology v.

After a bench trial, the\r\n\nBeaufort County Master-In-Equity issued an order in which he found EnviroFix\r\nhad terminated one of the agreements and owed MicroClean only those license\r\nfees accruing during the notice period on that agreement. The Master also allowed\r\nEnviroFix to retain possession and ownership of certain items that MicroClean\r\nsought in its claim and delivery action and awarded MicroClean the security\r\ndeposit paid by EnviroFix as liquidated damages for the property.

MicroClean appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\r\nremand.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nMicroSweep, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas,\r\nis a manufacturer of certain proprietary products. In 2004, MicroSweep began to\r\ndistribute the BioTower, a machine used to clean and purify the air in cars, homes,\r\nand commercial establishments.\r\n\r\nMicroClean, a South Carolina corporation with its principal place of business in\r\nHilton Head, is a licensor of the BioTower. Ansley Cohen and Jim Bragonier were\r\nits principals and officers during the events in question. On August 2, 2004,\r\nMicroSweep and MicroClean entered into a written distributorship agreement\r\ngranting MicroClean a license to distribute the BioTowers.\r\n\r\nEnviroFix, a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business in\r\nRaleigh, provides cleaning services and uses MicroSweep's proprietary products.\r\nDuring the events in question, David Stoner was the principal of the company.\r\n\r\nThe Parties' Agreements\r\nOn July 14, 2004, about two weeks before its agreement with MicroSweep was\r\nfinal, MicroClean entered into a License Agreement with EnviroFix in which\r\nEnviroFix received a non-exclusive right and license to use proprietary products\r\nmanufactured by MicroSweep in certain geographic locations for six years.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 3 of the License Agreement, EnviroFix was to pay to MicroClean a\r\nterritory fee of $25,000 when the parties signed the Agreement. Thereafter, for a\r\nsix-year term, EnviroFix was to pay MicroClean a monthly license fee for the use\r\nof four BioTowers provided by MicroClean. The license fee was $1,000 per\r\n\nmonth and due on the first day of each month for the first twelve months. After\r\nthat time, the fee was to increase to $1,250 per month. The parties further agreed\r\n\"the License Fee for the BioTowers shall be due on each machine for no more than\r\nsix years after delivery, and once License fees have been made for six years[,]\r\nownership of such BioTower will be deemed transferred to [EnviroFix], with no\r\nfurther payment being due for such machine.\"\r\n\r\nSection 3 also provided that during the six-year term, MicroClean would \"have the\r\nresponsibility for maintenance and repairs on the Proprietary Products, except to\r\nthe extent that any such repairs are necessitated by the neglect or wrongful actions\r\nof [EnviroFix], in which case [EnviroFix] was to make the repairs at its own cost.\"\r\nFurthermore, during any period that a proprietary product was under repair by\r\nMicroClean and the repair was not necessitated by neglect or wrongful actions\r\nattributable to EnviroFix, MicroClean was to waive the monthly license fee and\r\nprovide a substitute product if one was available.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Section 4, EnviroFix paid a security deposit of $15,000 for the four\r\nBioTowers when the parties executed the agreement. This deposit \"was to be\r\nreturned at the end of the six year term, provided [EnviroFix] has been in full\r\ncompliance with all terms hereof.\"\r\n\r\nSection 7(c) of the License Agreement addressed the issue of late payments and\r\nprovided that \"[EnviroFix] will promptly pay to [MicroClean] the Monthly License\r\nFee. Any payment not received by the tenth day of any month will bear a late fee\r\nof $100, and will thereafter bear interest at an annual rate of 18%.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral sections of the License Agreement addressed the parties' rights and\r\nobligations in the event the agreement was to be terminated.\r\n\r\nSection 2 gave EnviroFix the right to terminate the agreement without cause,\r\nprovided it gave \"60 days advance written notice of its desire to terminate this\r\nAgreement, unless this Agreement shall have been sooner terminated by\r\n[MicroClean] as a result of breach hereof by [EnviroFix].\"\r\n\r\nUnder Section 9, MicroClean had the right at its election to declare the License\r\nAgreement \"immediately terminated\" in the event of noncompliance by EnviroFix\r\nwith any provision in the agreement and EnviroFix's failure to cure the breach\r\nwithin twenty days following written notice of the breach.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 10, upon termination or expiration of the License Agreement,\r\nMicroClean was to take possession of all proprietary products that were provided\r\n\nto EnviroFix for less than six years. EnviroFix was to \"fully cooperate with\r\n[MicroClean] in the delivery of all such Proprietary Products used by [EnviroFix],\r\nwhich delivery shall be at the expense of [MicroClean].\" The parties further\r\nagreed that MicroClean \"shall have the right to pick up such items without having\r\nto resort to legal process of any kind.\" EnviroFix had the right to request that\r\nMicroClean purchase any equipment licensed for the full six-year term at fair\r\nmarket value. This value was to be determined by an accountant or other financial\r\nprofessional regularly employed by MicroClean; however, EnviroFix had the right\r\nto have its own financial professional value the equipment as well. If the parties\r\ndisagreed on the fair market value, they were to have this determination made by\r\nan independent appraiser.\r\n\r\nSection 12 provided that \"[a]ll notices, requests, demands, tenders and other\r\ncommunications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be\r\ndeemed to have been duly given if hand delivered, if sent by reputable overnight\r\ndelivery service, or if mailed, by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage\r\nprepaid.\" Section 12 also gave specific addresses for both MicroClean and\r\nEnviroFix. In addition to a post office box address for MicroClean, Section 12\r\nalso gave MicroClean's street address for notices sent by overnight delivery.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 2005, the parties executed a second document, entitled \"Equipment\r\nSchedule,\" whereby EnviroFix obtained two additional BioTowers from\r\nMicroClean at a total cost of $7,000 plus monthly payments of $373. The monthly\r\npayments were due on the tenth day of each month from July 10, 2005, until July\r\n10, 2008. Upon receipt of the thirty-sixth monthly payment, ownership of these\r\ntwo BioTowers would be deeded to EnviroFix. The Equipment Schedule\r\nreferenced the License Agreement, stating in part: \"It is agreed that as each new\r\npiece of licensed equipment is provided to [EnviroFix], the parties will sign a new\r\ncopy of this page, detailing the equipment and terms and will attach same to the\r\nLicense Agreement, intending to incorporate the Schedule into the License\r\nAgreement.\"\r\n\r\nEvents Leading to Litigation\r\nAlthough the BioTowers were effective in removing odors, EnviroFix complained\r\nthe caps on the machines warped and the digital timers did not work. MicroClean\r\ncharacterized the complaint about the caps as a cosmetic issue that did not impair\r\nthe performance of the BioTowers; however, EnviroFix maintained the problem\r\nadversely affected consumer confidence. Similarly, whereas MicroClean\r\ncontended the timers were an optional feature that increased the convenience of the\r\n\nBioTowers but did not affect the actual operation of the equipment if they did not\r\noperate as expected, EnviroFix asserted proper functioning of the timers was\r\nimportant for safety and quality control.\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 2005, Stoner wrote a letter to MicroClean in which he expressed\r\ndissatisfaction with MicroClean's performance. In his letter, Stoner stated he\r\ninformed MicroClean as early as December 2004 about mechanical problems\r\nEnviroFix was experiencing with the BioTowers, including not only the\r\nmalfunctioning of the timers and the warping of the tower caps, but also a motor\r\nfan failure. Stoner also asserted that MicroClean: (1) failed to respond to his\r\ncomplaints in a timely manner; (2) never inspected or tested the BioTowers to\r\nascertain whether they were in good working order; (3) failed to perform periodic\r\nmaintenance on the machines; and (4) did no repairs or maintenance except for\r\nrecent repairs made by MicroSweep on one machine. Stoner's letter ended as\r\nfollows:    This letter references only a few of the things you have\r\n            not done as provided for by the terms [of] our agreement.\r\n            Some may argue that these breeches [sic] of contract may\r\n            be viewed as having already terminated our agreement. I\r\n            do not know. I do know that due to your actions, or the\r\n            lack thereof, that the spirit of the agreement has been\r\n            violated and is dead.\r\n\r\n            Please be advised I am not going to pay my monthly fees\r\n            this month, nor will I pay any future monthly fees until\r\n            my machines are repaired. I also ask that you remit to\r\n            me $13,377.00 that I have paid in monthly fees on\r\n            machines that are in disrepair and requiring maintenance.\r\n            Remittance of the referenced fees and maintenance to\r\n            repair my machines will enable me to consider forgiving\r\n            your breech [sic] of our agreement.\r\n\r\nBeginning in December 2005, EnviroFix did not pay the monthly fees required\r\nunder the License Agreement and the Equipment Schedule.\r\n\r\nOn December 10, 2005, Cohen and Bragonier sent Stoner a letter asserting\r\nMicroClean advised MicroSweep about the problem with the warping caps soon\r\nafter Stoner reported it. They also advised that MicroSweep immediately started\r\nresearching the situation and changed its supplier and materials. Cohen and\r\n\nBragonier also attempted to explain the changes were expensive and could not be\r\nmade quickly. They also advised Cohen that the manufacturer did not require or\r\nsuggest any preventive maintenance, MicroClean did not have trained technicians\r\non staff, and the manufacturer discouraged third-party involvement. They also\r\nreminded Cohen that MicroClean did not expect the monthly license payment to be\r\nmade for the number of days that a specific piece of equipment was \"out of\r\nservice.\" In closing, Cohen and Bragonier stated:\r\n\r\n            MicroClean Technology, Inc. does not consider the\r\n            agreement with EnviroFix, Inc. breached or \"dead\" and\r\n            would again suggest that all parties take a practical\r\n            approach to the solution to [the] problems. For the\r\n            month of December 2005, MicroClean will extend a ten\r\n            day grace period to EnviroFix before the established\r\n            payment is considered late. We would expect future\r\n            payments will be made according to our agreement and\r\n            we will agree to work more closely with EnviroFix in an\r\n            effort to get all future issues resolved quickly and to the\r\n            satisfaction of all. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn reply, Stoner sent a letter dated December 20, 2005, to MicroClean reiterating\r\nEnviroFix's position that the agreement with MicroClean was \"void\" and indicating\r\nthat EnviroFix would consider the possibility of entering into a new agreement\r\nwith MicroClean \"[u]pon receipt of money from overpayment of licensing fees and\r\nreturn of EnviroFix's deposit.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated January 24, 2006, Cohen acknowledged Stoner took the position\r\nthat the parties' agreement was \"terminated.\" Although Cohen indicated\r\nMicroClean was still willing to resolve the parties' differences and continue the\r\nagreement, he also notified Stoner that MicroClean intended to pick up the six\r\nBioTowers in EnviroFix's possession on February 1, 2006, and requested that\r\nStoner let him know where to retrieve them. Cohen also advised that MicroClean\r\nexpected to receive a check to cover EnviroFix's use of the equipment through the\r\nend of January 2006.\r\n\r\nThe record on appeal does not indicate any clear response from EnviroFix to\r\nMicroClean's request to collect its equipment. Stoner testified only that \"[t]hey\r\ntold me they were coming up but they never showed up.\" In any event, it appears\r\nMicroClean did not attempt to retrieve the BioTowers on February 1, 2006, or any\r\nother time thereafter.\r\n\nIn March 2006, MicroSweep terminated its distributorship contract with\r\nMicroClean.1 In its letter advising of the termination of the distributorship,\r\nMicroSweep also required that MicroClean terminate all prior agreements and\r\ncommitments that it made with other resellers and distributors concerning\r\nMicroSweep equipment and services. MicroClean could continue to purchase\r\nBioTower machines from MicroSweep, but at a higher cost. Furthermore,\r\nMicroClean was still able to coordinate any repair requests from EnviroFix with\r\nMicroSweep.\r\n\r\nThe Lawsuit\r\nOn October 24, 2006, MicroClean filed this action for breach of contract, claim\r\nand delivery, and quantum meruit against EnviroFix, requesting $83,813 in\r\ndamages under the License Agreement. MicroClean also sought an order requiring\r\nEnviroFix to return the six BioTowers that were provided under the License\r\nAgreement and Equipment Schedule. EnviroFix answered, denying the allegations\r\nin the complaint, and counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of covenant of\r\ngood faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit, negligent misrepresentation, and\r\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe Master heard the matter on February 24, 2011, and issued an order on April\r\n12, 2011.\r\n\r\nAs to MicroClean's breach of contract action, the Master found: (1) the parties\r\nentered into two separately enforceable contracts, namely, the License Agreement\r\nof July 14, 2004, and the Equipment Schedule dated May 9, 2005, (2) pursuant to\r\nSection 2, on December 4, 2005, EnviroFix gave a sixty-day notice of its desire to\r\nterminate the License Agreement, (3) MicroClean could not recover for breach of\r\nthe License Agreement because it had been terminated by EnviroFix; however,\r\nEnviroFix owed MicroClean monthly license payments totaling $2,500 for\r\nDecember 2005 and January 2006, and (4) MicroClean was entitled to $11,190 for\r\nbreach of the Equipment Schedule, representing thirty unremitted monthly\r\npayments. Adding the damages for breach of the Equipment Schedule to the\r\nunpaid license fees on the License Agreement, the Master awarded MicroClean\r\n$13,690.\r\n\r\n\r\n1The distributorship agreement required MicroClean to buy a certain number of\r\nBioTowers from MicroSweep in a stated period. MicroSweep terminated this\r\nagreement because MicroClean was unable to meet that quota.\r\n\nThe Master also denied MicroClean's claim for quantum meruit and EnviroFix's\r\nactions for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit,\r\nnegligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent misrepresentation. As to MicroClean's\r\nclaim and delivery action, the Master found: (1) return of the BioTowers was\r\nimpractical because the property was essentially a perishable item with no\r\nmarketable resale value, (2) MicroClean could retain the $15,000 security deposit\r\nas liquidated damages for the four BioTowers it provided under the Licensing\r\nAgreement, and (3) upon payment of the thirty outstanding monthly payments due\r\nunder the Equipment Schedule, EnviroFix could retain full possession and\r\nownership of the remaining two BioTowers.\r\n\r\nThe Master granted EnviroFix's action for breach of contract, finding MicroClean\r\nfailed to comply with the provisions in the License Agreement on maintenance and\r\nrepair. Based on Stoner's testimony and written correspondence, the Master\r\nassessed the total value of the time that EnviroFix lost from mechanical failures of\r\nthe BioTowers at $13,377. After subtracting this amount from $13,690, the\r\ndamages awarded to MicroClean arising out of the Equipment Schedule, the\r\nMaster granted MicroClean judgment of $313. MicroClean appeals.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nI.    Did the Master err in (1) finding that MicroClean failed to prove a breach of\r\nthe License Agreement and (2) limiting MicroClean's recovery on the License\r\nAgreement to unpaid fees for the two months immediately following EnviroFix's\r\ncommunication of its intent to end its relationship with MicroClean?\r\n\r\nII.    Did the Master err in resolving MicroClean's action for claim and delivery\r\nby allowing EnviroFix to retain possession of the BioTowers and allowing\r\nMicroClean to keep the security deposit as liquidated damages?\r\n\r\nIII. Did the Master err in awarding damages to EnviroFix on its breach of\r\ncontract action?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe issues raised in this appeal concern only the legal claims asserted by the\r\nparties; therefore, our standard of review is that applicable for actions at law.\r\n\"When reviewing an action at law, referred to a master or special referee for final\r\njudgment with direct appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals, the\r\nappellate court's jurisdiction is limited to correcting errors of law, and the appellate\r\n\ncourt will not disturb the master or special referee's findings of fact as long as they\r\nare reasonably supported by the evidence.\" Allen v. Pinnacle Healthcare Sys.,\r\nLLC, 394 S.C. 268, 272, 715 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Termination of the License Agreement\r\n\r\nMicroClean first contends the Master erred in finding the two letters Stoner wrote\r\nin December 2005, were sufficient to satisfy the requirement in the License\r\nAgreement that EnviroFix provide sixty days' advance notice if it desired to\r\nterminate the License Agreement. In support of its position, MicroClean argues\r\nthe letters did not provide sixty days' notice of termination and were not delivered\r\nin a manner designated as acceptable under the License Agreement. MicroClean\r\nalso asserts EnviroFix's purported notice was ineffective to terminate the parties'\r\nagreement because EnviroFix refused to cooperate when MicroClean expressed its\r\ndesire to regain possession of the BioTowers.\r\n\r\nA.    Error Preservation\r\n\r\nWe first address EnviroFix's argument that MicroClean raised the issue of\r\nnonconformance with the notice provisions of the License Agreement for the first\r\ntime on appeal and therefore has failed to preserve this issue. We hold MicroClean\r\npreserved its argument that the notice EnviroFix provided was insufficient to\r\neffectuate a termination of the License Agreement. We agree with EnviroFix that\r\nMicroClean did not preserve its argument that the manner of delivery of the notice\r\nwas unacceptable, but hold that this failure does not affect the outcome of\r\nMicroClean's appeal.\r\n\r\n1.    Sufficiency of Notice\r\n\r\nAs to MicroClean's position that the letters were ineffective in providing written\r\nnotice that EnviroFix was terminating the License Agreement, we disagree with\r\nEnviroFix that MicroClean failed to raise this issue at trial. In its complaint,\r\nMicroClean asserts that \"without 60 days written notice as required by the License\r\nAgreement, [EnviroFix] unilaterally declared the Agreement void.\" On direct\r\nexamination, when asked by MicroClean's attorney whether Stoner stated \"his\r\nopinion\" in the letter of December 20, 2005 that the parties' agreement was \"void,\"\r\nCohen answered in the affirmative. Moreover, in their letter of December 10, 2005\r\nto Stoner, Cohen and Bragonier expressly stated that \"MicroClean Technology,\r\nInc. does not consider the agreement with EnviroFix, Inc. breached or 'dead' and\r\n\nwould again suggest all parties take a practical approach to the solution to\r\nproblems.\" Finally, the Master stated \"[t]he Court denies [MicroClean's] cause of\r\naction for breach of the License Agreement because [EnviroFix] properly\r\nterminated the License Agreement,\" thus, ruling on MicroClean's argument that\r\nEnviroFix failed to provide notice of termination as required by the License\r\nAgreement. Cf. Spence v. Wingate, 381 S.C. 487, 489, 674 S.E.2d 169, 170 (2009)\r\n(holding that although a summary judgment order did not restate the ground on\r\nwhich the petitioner opposed the summary judgment motion, the ruling in the\r\nappealed order was sufficient to address that argument).\r\n\r\n2.    Delivery of Notice\r\n\r\nWe agree with EnviroFix's argument that MicroClean failed to preserve for appeal\r\nthe issue of whether the manner of delivery of Stoner's letters was sufficient to\r\neffectuate a termination of the License Agreement. The record on appeal does not\r\ninclude any information as to how these letters were sent to MicroClean. We\r\nfurther note, however, the provisions in the License Agreement governing how\r\nnotices under the agreement were to be sent specify only that \"[a]ll notices,\r\nrequests, demands, tenders and other communications required or permitted\r\nhereunder . . . shall be deemed to have been duly given if hand delivered, if sent by\r\nreputable overnight delivery service, or if mailed, by certified mail, return receipt\r\nrequested, postage prepaid . . . .\" (emphasis added). This provision does not\r\nnecessarily exclude other means of transmission as appropriate to deliver a notice\r\nof termination.\r\n\r\nB.    Sufficiency of EnviroFix's Letters\r\n\r\nAs to the letters themselves, we agree with MicroClean they were insufficient to\r\nconvey a sixty-day notice of termination according to the License Agreement.\r\nNowhere in either letter did Stoner indicate EnviroFix was giving notice of its\r\nintent to terminate the agreement in sixty days as required by Section 2. See Edisto\r\nIsland Historical Soc'y, Inc. v. Gregory, 354 S.C. 198, 202, 580 S.E.2d 141, 143\r\n(2003) (\"[N]otice of termination must be given in accordance with the terms of the\r\ncontract.\").\r\n\r\nIn his letter of December 4, 2005, Stoner advised MicroClean that he would not\r\npay his monthly fees \"until my machines are repaired.\" This statement evidences\r\nacknowledgment on his part that the License Agreement was still in effect. We\r\ninterpret the other letter, in which Stoner asserted the agreement was \"void\" and\r\nexpressed a willingness to enter into a new agreement only if MicroClean refunded\r\n\nEnviroFix's security deposit as well as certain alleged overpayments, as an intent to\r\nrestore the pre-agreement status quo rather than to terminate the License\r\nAgreement in the manner specified in the agreement itself. Moreover, as the\r\nMaster recognized, EnviroFix paid no monthly fees for December 2005 and\r\nJanuary 2006, as it would have been required to do under the License Agreement if\r\nits letters constituted a notice of termination. Therefore, we reverse the Master's\r\nfinding that EnviroFix properly terminated the License Agreement.\r\n\r\nC.    Breach of Contract Action and Damages\r\n\r\nWhether MicroClean is ultimately entitled to prevail on its breach of contract\r\naction and the amount, if any, of its damages, however, would depend on matters\r\nthat the Master did not decide after ruling that EnviroFix terminated the License\r\nAgreement. These include EnviroFix's arguments concerning MicroClean's\r\ncapacity to enter into and continue to honor the License Agreement and questions\r\nconcerning whether MicroClean's own actions amounted to a termination of the\r\nagreement. Therefore, we remand this matter for the Master to determine on the\r\npresent record whether MicroClean's right to recover for breach of contract is\r\naffected by any other issues presented at trial.2\r\n\r\nII.   Claim and Delivery Action\r\n\r\nMicroClean further argues it should have prevailed on its action for claim and\r\ndelivery because the License Agreement stated it had the right to take possession\r\nof the BioTowers and other proprietary products provided to EnviroFix if the\r\napplicable contract was terminated before the expiration of the six-year term.\r\nMicroClean further argues that that it is entitled to actual and punitive damages\r\nfrom EnviroFix for its refusal to surrender possession of the BioTowers as well as\r\ncompensation for loss of use, depreciation, and injury to the BioTowers. We\r\nremand this matter to the Master to determine (1) whether repossession of the\r\nBioTowers by MicroClean is an appropriate remedy and (2) the amount of\r\ncompensation, if any, to which MicroClean is entitled because of EnviroFix's\r\nalleged failure to relinquish the equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 EnviroFix did not challenge either the Master's finding that it breached the terms\r\nof the Equipment Schedule or the $11,690 judgment for this breach. Therefore, on\r\nremand, the Master shall revisit only the issue of damages on the License\r\nAgreement.\r\n\n\"[An] action for claim and delivery contemplates the recovery of the specific\r\nproperty claimed when possible or its value when delivery is not possible.\" Nat'l\r\nBank of South Carolina v. Daniels, 283 S.C. 438, 442, 322 S.C. 689, 692 (Ct. App.\r\n1984). \"Proof of title, or right of possession, is a prerequisite to a plaintiff\r\nprevailing in action in Claim and Delivery.\" Manship v. Newsome, 188 S.C. 6, 10,\r\n198 S.E. 428, 430 (1938).\r\n\r\nA determination of whether MicroClean's right to possession of the BioTowers\r\nwould be contingent on when the contract is deemed \"terminated.\" Under Section\r\n10, upon termination or expiration of the License Agreement, MicroClean was to\r\n\"take possession of all Proprietary Products provided to [EnviroFix] . . . and\r\nlicensed by [MicroClean] to [EnviroFix] for less than six years.\" Furthermore,\r\nEnviroFix was not entitled to compensation for any BioTowers licensed by\r\nMicroClean to EnviroFix for less than six years.\r\n\r\nIf the License Agreement is found to have been terminated before the end of the\r\nsix-year contract period, MicroClean may be entitled to take possession of the\r\nBioTowers without having to pay compensation to EnviroFix. On the other hand,\r\nif MicroClean is allowed to enforce payment of the monthly license fees until the\r\nend of the six-year term, it could be argued that under Section 3 of the License\r\nAgreement the BioTowers would rightfully belong to EnviroFix once it has paid\r\nall required monthly license fees, late fees, and interest, such expenses representing\r\nits costs to procure a license to use the equipment for six years. Section 10 allowed\r\nMicroClean to \"take possession of all Proprietary Products . . . licensed to\r\n[EnviroFix] for less than six years.\" (emphasis added). EnviroFix was not required\r\nto retain physical possession of the equipment for any specific length of time to\r\navoid having to surrender it to MicroClean.\r\n\r\nWe agree with MicroClean that if it is entitled to return of the BioTowers, it may\r\nalso be entitled to actual and punitive damages. See Rule 49(c), SCRCP (allowing\r\nthe finder of fact \"[i]n an action for the recovery of specific personal property\" to\r\nassess actual and punitive damages sustained by the prevailing party \"which the\r\nprevailing party has sustained by reason of the detention or taking and withholding\r\nof such property\"); McLean v. Godwin Props., Inc., 292 S.C. 518, 521, 357 S.E.2d\r\n473, 475 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"Actual and punitive damages are available in a claim\r\nand delivery action.\").\r\n\r\nHere, the Master disposed of this issue by finding the parties \"agreed that\r\n$15,000.00 would serve as liquidated damages in the event that the four (4)\r\n[B]io[T]owers were not returned upon request.\" Liquidated damages, however,\r\n\nhave been defined as \"'damages the amount of which has been made certain and\r\nfixed either by the act and agreement of the parties or by operation of law to a sum\r\nwhich cannot be changed by the proof.'\" Dixie Bell, Inc. v. Redd, 376 S.C. 361,\r\n371, 656 S.E.2d 765, 770 (2007) (quoting 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 489 (2003)).\r\nHere, other provisions in the License Agreement suggest the parties did not\r\nrecognize the amount of the security deposit to be a sum that cannot be changed by\r\nproof. Notably, under Section 10, EnviroFix \"ha[d] the right to request that\r\n[MicroClean] purchase the equipment at the conclusion of the contract term at \"fair\r\nmarket value,\" which, if the parties could not agree on this amount, would be\r\ndetermined by an independent appraiser. Furthermore, neither the License\r\nAgreement nor the Equipment Schedule designate the security deposits as\r\nliquidated damages or otherwise restrict MicroClean's recovery to such deposits in\r\nthe event the BioTowers were not returned. See Bannon v. Knauss, 282 S.C. 589,\r\n592, 320 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1984) (\"The presence of a liquidated damages clause in\r\na contract does not in itself limit the remedies available to the nonbreaching\r\nparty.\").\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we remand MicroClean's claim and delivery action to the\r\nMaster for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nIII.   EnviroFix's Breach of Contract Action\r\n\r\nFinally, MicroClean takes issue with the Master's award of $13,377 to EnviroFix\r\non its counterclaim for breach of contract. We find no error.\r\n\r\nThe Master found in favor of EnviroFix on its breach of contract action, noting that\r\nMicroClean failed to comply with those portions of the license agreement related\r\nto maintenance and repair. MicroClean asserts the repairs that EnviroFix requested\r\nconcerned matters that either did not affect the actual performance of the\r\nBioTowers or were attended to promptly. In addition, MicroClean maintains (1) it\r\ndid not charge EnviroFix license fees for the dates that the BioTowers were being\r\nrepaired and (2) the contract term specifying it would not charge a license fee for a\r\nBioTower during any interval that the particular BioTower was under repair should\r\nbe characterized as a liquidated damages clause. We hold the record supports the\r\nMaster's determination of EnviroFix's damages.\r\n\r\nStoner testified that his complaints reflected legitimate concerns regarding safety,\r\nconsumer confidence, and quality control. He determined he was entitled to\r\n$13,377 based on the number of days for which he claimed MicroClean owed him\r\ncredit for repair issues and arrived at this figure by examining the e-mails he had\r\n\nsent advising MicroClean about equipment failures \"and figured out how many\r\nmonths forward that they did nothing while they were in disrepair.\"3 Although\r\nStoner conceded MicroClean made efforts to have his equipment repaired and gave\r\nhim credit on several occasions when the BioTowers were being repaired, he also\r\ntestified that MicroClean's representatives appeared dismissive of his concerns and\r\nthat the credit they gave him did not cover the entire time the equipment was in\r\ndisrepair or the time it took MicroClean to transport it to the repair site.\r\n\r\nWe therefore hold EnviroFix presented evidence at trial supporting the Master's\r\nfinding that MicroClean did not give him sufficient credit for the intervals during\r\nwhich the BioTowers were in need of repair. Although MicroClean correctly\r\npoints out that the License Agreement expressly stated it would not charge any\r\nlicense fee for a BioTower during the period of time in which that BioTower was\r\n\"under repair by [MicroClean],\" the agreement does not specify that the waiver of\r\nsuch fees was a liquidated damages provision or limit EnviroFix's recovery to this\r\nwaiver. See id. (\"In the absence of clear language in the contract to the contrary, a\r\nnonbreaching party may normally elect either to pursue a remedy specified in the\r\ncontract or to sue for any other remedy available for breach.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the Master's findings that EnviroFix terminated the License Agreement\r\nand was therefore not liable for the monthly license fees for the balance of the six-\r\nyear term; however, we remand this matter to the Master to determine (1) the merit\r\nof any of the alternative defenses that EnviroFix asserted at trial, (2) the damages,\r\nif any, to which MicroClean is entitled for breach of the License Agreement, (3)\r\nwhich party is entitled to possession of the BioTowers, and (4) any damages to\r\nwhich MicroClean is entitled on its claim and delivery action. We affirm the\r\ndamages award to EnviroFix on its breach of contract counterclaim and direct that\r\nthis judgment shall be an offset to any damages awarded to MicroClean. Finally,\r\nwe hold the judgment of $11,690 awarded to MicroClean for EnviroFix's breach of\r\nthe Equipment Schedule is a final determination.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n3The record does not indicate that EnviroFix claimed revenue lost because of the\r\nalleged equipment failures.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5136","title":"AnMed Health v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nAnMed is a hospital in Anderson. Crowe began working for AnMed in 1984. As\r\na benefits coordinator, she had no direct contact with patients. Crowe is fifty-eight\r\nyears old and has never had a flu shot.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Crowe's then nineteen-year-old daughter Nicole got a flu shot. Within a\r\nfew days, numbness spread through Nicole's body. When the numbness reached\r\nNicole's chest, she had trouble breathing. An ambulance took her to a hospital,\r\nwhere she stayed for ten days. Nicole's neurologist first told the family Nicole had\r\na disease called Guillain–Barré syndrome. He later determined she had a different\r\ndisease, multiple sclerosis. The neurologist told Crowe that Nicole's flu shot \"very\r\nwell could have activated\" the disease.\r\n\r\nNicole suffered over the next several years while she attempted to live a normal\r\nlife. The medications she took to treat her disease eventually caused liver failure.\r\nNicole died in 2007 from complications caused by her medications.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, AnMed adopted a policy entitled, \"Influenza Immunization Protocol.\"\r\nThe first sentence of the policy states, \"To protect patients, visitors, and other\r\nhealth care workers [], the influenza vaccination will be viewed as a health\r\ncompetency and patient safety requirement.\" Under the policy, each employee\r\nmust get a flu shot unless AnMed grants the employee an exemption. The policy\r\nprovides an employee\r\n\r\n             may request an exemption from vaccination based on\r\n             guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\r\n             Those CDC guidelines for exemptions currently include,\r\n             severe egg allergy, severe allergy to any component of\r\n             the vaccine, a past severe reaction to the influenza\r\n             vaccine, or a history of Gillian-Barre [sic] syndrome.\r\n             NO OTHER FORM OF OR REASON FOR\r\n             EXEMPTION WILL BE MADE.\r\n\nThe policy provides that each exemption request will be considered \"on a case by\r\ncase basis.\" Finally, the policy requires that an employee be fired if she does not\r\nget a flu shot or an exemption.\r\n\r\nAt the time Crowe refused to get a flu shot, she believed her daughter Nicole's\r\ndisease was a genetic disorder that became active when Nicole got her flu shot.\r\nCrowe's doctor, Erin Cooksey, told her she should not get a flu shot. Dr. Cooksey\r\nwrote a note saying, \"This patient must be medically exempt from the flu shot.\r\nShe has a strong family history of Guillian-Burr [sic] and MS. The flu shot can\r\nactivate these processes and must be avoided!\" Crowe testified she was afraid that\r\nif she got a flu shot, what happened to Nicole would happen to her.\r\n\r\nCrowe asked AnMed for an exemption. In her exemption application, Crowe gave\r\nAnMed a copy of Dr. Cooksey's note and a letter in which Crowe explained what\r\nhappened to Nicole. Crowe wrote that \"for genetic and medical reasons I don't\r\nwant to put the flu shot into my body and possibly activate the same gene that\r\ncould eventually cause death!\"\r\n\r\nCrowe's request did not meet any of the policy's grounds for an exemption, so\r\nAnMed denied the request. AnMed instructed Crowe to get a flu shot, but she did\r\nnot do so. As she later testified, \"Why would I want to put something in my\r\nsystem, even if it meant me being able to keep my job, that eventually killed my\r\nchild when we have the same genes?\"\r\n\r\nAnMed fired Crowe for not getting a flu shot. Crowe filed a claim with the South\r\nCarolina Employment Security Commission for unemployment benefits. A\r\ncommission claims adjudicator found AnMed discharged Crowe for cause and\r\nruled she was disqualified from receiving benefits for ten weeks.\r\n\r\nCrowe filed an appeal to the commission's appeal tribunal. While the appeal was\r\npending, the commission's functions were transferred to the Department of\r\nEmployment and Workforce. See Act No. 146, 2010 S.C. Acts 1168. A\r\ndepartment appeal tribunal held a hearing and issued an order reversing the claims\r\nadjudicator's decision. AnMed filed an appeal to the department's appellate panel,\r\nwhich affirmed the tribunal's decision. The appellate panel found AnMed failed to\r\nprove it discharged Crowe for cause:\r\n\r\n             The employer's policy requiring immunization for\r\n             continued employment was unreasonable, particularly as\r\n             applied to the claimant's unique circumstances. The\r\n\n             claimant worked for the employer for 26 years without an\r\n             immunization requirement, did not have patient contact\r\n             in the performance of her duties, and presented credible\r\n             medical documentation that such an immunization would\r\n             jeopardize her health. Therefore, we find the claimant\r\n             was discharged without cause connected with her\r\n             employment.\r\n\r\nAnMed appealed to the administrative law court. The ALC found substantial\r\nevidence supported the appellate panel's decision, and affirmed.\r\n\r\n      II.\t   Whether AnMed Discharged Crowe for Cause\r\n\r\nUnder subsection 41-35-120(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010),1 if the\r\ndepartment finds that an insured worker \"has been discharged for cause connected\r\nwith h[er] most recent work,\" she is ineligible for unemployment benefits for a\r\nperiod of time between five and twenty-six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe issue in this case is very narrow. It is not whether AnMed's policy is\r\nreasonable as it applies to other AnMed employees, or even whether AnMed acted\r\nreasonably in applying it to Crowe. It is not whether Guillain–Barré syndrome or\r\nmultiple sclerosis are genetic disorders, or whether getting a flu shot can, in fact,\r\ncause someone to suffer from those diseases. To determine whether Crowe was\r\ndisqualified from receiving unemployment benefits, the only question for the\r\ndepartment to answer was whether Crowe's refusal to comply with AnMed's policy\r\nwas reasonable under her unique circumstances.\r\n\r\n             A.\t   The Reasonableness of AnMed's Application of Its Policy to\r\n                   Crowe\r\n\r\nThe department's appellate panel found AnMed's decision to require Crowe to get a\r\nflu shot was unreasonable. As part of its decision to affirm the department's order,\r\nthe ALC found substantial evidence to support that ruling. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe standard of review the ALC must apply to a factual determination by the\r\ndepartment is set forth in section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2012). Subsection 1-23-380(5)(e) provides the ALC \"may reverse or modify the\r\n\r\n1The current version of section 41-35-120 reads differently. We are applying the\r\nversion of the statute in effect when Crowe filed her unemployment benefits claim.\r\n\ndecision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the\r\nadministrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: . . . (e) clearly\r\nerroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole\r\nrecord.\" We have carefully examined the record before the department, and we do\r\nnot find \"reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\" to support a ruling that a\r\nhospital's \"health competency and patient safety requirement,\" designed \"to protect\r\npatients, visitors, and other health care workers\" by requiring all employees to have\r\na flu shot, is unreasonable. The determination of how to protect patients from life-\r\nthreatening illnesses such as influenza is a complicated medical and scientific\r\nevaluation that should be made by hospitals, not the Department of Employment\r\nand Workforce, the ALC, or this court. In fact, AnMed was required to make this\r\nevaluation. See 42 C.F.R. § 482.42 (2012) (mandating that hospitals maintain an\r\n\"active program for the prevention, control, and investigation of infections and\r\ncommunicable diseases\" to receive funding through Medicare and Medicaid). We\r\nfind the department's decision that the application of the policy to Crowe was\r\nunreasonable is clearly erroneous and affects a substantial right of AnMed. We\r\nvacate the department's finding that AnMed's application of the policy to Crowe\r\nwas unreasonable.\r\n\r\nVacating that finding, however, does not require us to reverse the ALC's judgment.\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the department's finding was not a\r\nprerequisite to its ruling in Crowe's favor. In Mickens v. Southland Exchange-Joint\r\nVenture, 305 S.C. 127, 406 S.E.2d 363 (1991), our supreme court stated a \"general\r\nrule\" for analyzing whether an employee was discharged for cause—\"where the\r\nemployer's request is reasonable, a refusal to comply will constitute misconduct,\r\njustifying a discharge for cause. What is 'reasonable' will vary according to the\r\ncircumstances of each case. Not only must the reasonableness of the employer's\r\nrequest be evaluated, but also the employee's reason for noncompliance.\" 305 S.C.\r\nat 130, 406 S.E.2d at 365 (emphasis in original) (internal citations and quotation\r\nmarks omitted). In Mickens, the Employment Security Commission considered the\r\nreasonableness of both the employer's request and the employee's refusal.\r\nHowever, Mickens involved a situation that differs significantly from the one\r\nbefore us. In that case, Mickens signed a document in which he agreed not to\r\ndisclose confidential company information. 305 S.C. at 128-29, 406 S.E.2d at 364.\r\nHe later attended a press conference, but there was no evidence that he said\r\nanything at it. 305 S.C. at 129, 406 S.E.2d at 364. In response, Southland issued\r\nMickens a written warning stating his attendance violated the confidentiality\r\nagreement and \"further violation\" may result in his termination. Id. When\r\nMickens refused to sign the warning, he was fired. Id. Noting the confidentiality\r\nagreement did not prohibit Mickens' attendance at press conferences, the supreme\r\n\ncourt found Southland's request for Mickens to sign the warning was unreasonable\r\nand Mickens' refusal to sign was \"justified.\" 305 S.C. at 130-31, 406 S.E.2d at\r\n365.\r\n\r\nMickens involved an employer making a request that was unique to one employee\r\nand was based on the employer's perception of one specific act in which the\r\nemployee had engaged. Accordingly, it was necessary to consider both the\r\nreasonableness of Southland instructing Mickens to sign a document indicating he\r\nhad violated the confidentiality agreement and the reasonableness of Mickens'\r\nrefusal to do so. In contrast, this case involves one employee's response to a\r\nhospital's companywide patient-safety policy that the hospital applied uniformly\r\nand according to the policy's terms. Under these circumstances, the reasonableness\r\ninquiry from Mickens necessarily focuses on the employee's refusal to comply with\r\nthe policy. B.     The Reasonableness of Crowe's Refusal to Comply\r\n\r\nWe affirm the department's decision that Crowe is not disqualified from receiving\r\nunemployment benefits because we find substantial evidence to support the\r\ndepartment's determination that her refusal to comply with the policy was\r\nreasonable under her unique circumstances. See Mickens, 305 S.C. at 130, 406\r\nS.E.2d at 365.\r\n\r\nCrowe refused to get a flu shot because she believed doing so could cause her to\r\nsuffer and die from a debilitating disease. Crowe watched that happen to Nicole\r\nseveral years earlier, and Nicole's doctor said the flu shot Nicole received just\r\nweeks before her symptoms began \"very well could have\" caused them. When\r\nCrowe asked Dr. Cooksey, her own doctor, for advice about getting a shot, Dr.\r\nCooksey wrote that the vaccination \"must be avoided!\" These facts support the\r\ndepartment's finding that Crowe's refusal was reasonable under the circumstances.\r\nTherefore, we affirm the ALC's conclusion that the department's finding is not\r\nclearly erroneous because it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nAnMed argues Crowe's subjective beliefs about getting a flu shot were incorrect\r\nand Dr. Cooksey's opinion was not reliable. However, our analysis focuses on\r\nwhether Crowe's actions were reasonable under her circumstances. The\r\ncorrectness of Crowe's subjective beliefs and the reliability of Dr. Cooksey's\r\nopinion are relevant to the objective reasonableness of Crowe's decision, but are\r\n\nnot dispositive. Considering the record as a whole, we affirm the department's\r\nfinding.\r\n\r\n      III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the ALC is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
