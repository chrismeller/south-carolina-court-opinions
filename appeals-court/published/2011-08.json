McDow and Erin U. Fitzpatrick, both of Rock Hill, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nDaniel Dominic D'Agostino, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: In this divorce action, Jetter\r\n  Pittman (Husband) appeals the award of alimony to Gloria Pittman (Wife), the identification\r\n  and equitable division of the marital property, and the award of attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties met in 1991 and married April 29, 2000.Â \r\n  This was the second marriage for each.Â  No children were born of the marriage. Â Wife\r\n  was born in 1948, and Husband was born in 1962. \r\nWhen the parties met, Husband was living and working\r\n  in North Carolina.Â  In 1993, Husband moved into Wife's house in Fort Mill.Â  The\r\n  parties pooled their funds and contributed equally to the household expenses.Â  In\r\n  addition to his regular employment, Husband also did surveying work on the side\r\n  and trained Wife to help him in the field.\r\nSince 1986, Wife has worked as a surgical nurse and kept\r\n  her professional credentials current.Â  In 1996, Husband stopped working at his\r\n  job to open his own surveying business, Pittman Professional Land Surveying.Â  He initially conducted the\r\n  business from Wife's home, but later moved into a small office.Â  Wife worked\r\n  for the business, but also continued to work full-time as a nurse. \r\nAfter the parties married, Wife started working only\r\n  three days a week at her nursing job and made\r\n  up the difference between what she would have earned had she continued\r\n  full-time work as a nurse and what she was earning on the part-time schedule by\r\n  working at Pittman Professional Land Surveying.Â  Wife later reduced the time\r\n  she spent at her nursing job to one day per week.Â  Wife served as corporate\r\n  secretary and handled financial matters for the business.Â  Because Wife was\r\n  older than Husband, the parties agreed to raise her salary instead of Husband's\r\n  salary in order to increase her social security income so that they would have\r\n  more money during their retirement.Â  During the parties' marriage, the business\r\n  prospered through their joint efforts, grossing over $800,000 in 2006.Â  Wife's\r\n  salary at Pittman Professional Land Surveying was $4,200 per month when she\r\n  left the company.Â  \r\nThe parties separated in March 2007, and Wife\r\n  commenced divorce proceedings soon after. Â In October 2007 Husband moved in with\r\n  his paramour.Â  The following month Husband terminated Wife's employment with the business by leaving her a voice message telling her not to\r\n  come to work.Â  Husband also hired his paramour to perform Wife's former duties\r\n  at the business and paid her the same salary he paid Wife, even though the\r\n  paramour had not worked outside the home for the past fifteen years.Â  Wife\r\n  filed for unemployment after Husband fired her, but Husband appealed her\r\n  application to the Employment Security Commission.Â  Wife began receiving\r\n  unemployment compensation only after she and Husband appeared before the\r\n  Commission.\r\nIn January 2008, following a temporary hearing in the\r\n  matter, the family court issued an order (1) directing Husband to reimburse\r\n  Wife $1,500 in private investigator fees, (2) granting discovery, (3) allowing\r\n  both parties to hire their own appraisers to value the business and any other\r\n  property that may be marital in nature and ordering both parties to cooperate\r\n  in the appraisals, and (4) restraining both parties from disposing or\r\n  encumbering marital assets. Â The court also ordered Husband to pay Wife temporary\r\n  alimony of $2,500 per month, but reserved the right to offset this award\r\n  against Wife's equitable distribution award if at the final hearing the court\r\n  determined that an offset would be appropriate.Â  In addition, the court\r\n  declined to order Husband to rehire Wife or to prohibit Husband from hiring his\r\n  paramour for Wife's position at the company.\r\nOn May 7, 2008, the family court held a hearing\r\n  pursuant to a motion by Wife to compel responses to discovery.Â  By order dated\r\n  June 18, 2008, the family court determined the issues raised in the motion would\r\n  be resolved once Husband produced written verification regarding certain\r\n  appraisals that Wife sought and stated that the issue of attorney's fees for\r\n  the motion would be addressed during the final hearing.\r\nA portion of the final hearing took place from January\r\n  20 through January 22, 2009.Â  After a hearing on April 2, 2009, the court\r\n  issued an order directing the parties to engage Tracy Amos for the purpose of\r\n  performing an evaluation of the business.Â  Fees for the appraisal were to be\r\n  paid initially by Pittman Professional Land Surveying, but could be apportioned\r\n  between Husband and Wife at a later date.Â  In addition, the parties agreed to\r\n  provide information concerning property associated with the business and to\r\n  allow Wife access to the business at a designated time to verify the\r\n  information that Husband provided. \r\nThe final hearing resumed in Chester County on\r\n  September 29, 2009, at which time the appraiser testified as to the value of\r\n  the business, Husband presented his case, and Wife testified in reply.Â  On\r\n  October 21, 2009, the family court held another hearing in the matter to\r\n  address contempt proceedings brought by Wife concerning Husband's temporary\r\n  alimony payments.\r\nBy order dated and filed October 23, 2009, the family\r\n  court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery, awarded her permanent\r\n  periodic alimony of $600 per month, ordered Husband to contribute $12,500\r\n  toward Wife's attorney's fees, denied Husband's request for a credit towards\r\n  the equitable distribution for some or all of the alimony paid pursuant to the\r\n  temporary order, and set a deadline for Husband to finish paying the alimony\r\n  arrearage from the temporary order.Â  The family court also identified, valued,\r\n  and divided the marital property, specifically finding that Pittman Professional Land Surveying had been transmuted into a marital\r\n  asset and including the business in Husband's share of the marital estate. \r\nBy order dated October 30, 2009, the family court\r\n  found Husband had the ability to pay alimony but willfully failed to do so.Â \r\n  Based on this finding, the court found Husband in civil contempt and ordered\r\n  him to serve ninety days in jail unless he paid $5,000 of his total arrearage.\r\nOn November 2, 2009, Husband moved to alter or amend\r\n  the judgment, challenging, among other issues, (1) the finding that Pittman Professional Land Surveying had been transmuted into marital\r\n  property, (2) the court's failure to consider part of the business as either\r\n  nonmarital propertyÂ  or as part of his contribution to the marital estate, and\r\n  (3) other findings relevant to alimony and equitable distribution.Â  The family\r\n  court declined to change its order, and Husband filed this appeal. \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n     Did the family court err in refusing to make the requisite\r\n  findings of fact on which to base its awards of alimony, equitable\r\n  apportionment, and attorney's fees?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Is the alimony award of $600 per month supported by\r\n  the evidence?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n     Did the family court err in declining to offset the\r\n  temporary alimony award against Wife's share of the marital estate?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n     Did the family court err in awarding Wife $12,500 in\r\n  attorney's fees?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.\r\n     Did the family\r\n  court err in valuing two vehicles at $8,000 each?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VI.\r\n     Did the family\r\n  court err in finding Pittman Professional Land Surveying had been transmuted?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VII.\r\n     Did the family court\r\n  err in failing to consider the premarital value of Pittman Professional Land\r\n  Surveying or Husband's nonmarital contributions toward this asset?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VIII.\r\n     Did the family court\r\n  err in awarding Wife a laptop computer that was purchased with funds belonging\r\n  to Pittman Professional Land Surveying?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;'In\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require [an appellate court] to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court.'&quot; Lewis v. Lewis, 392\r\n  S.C. 381, 384, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011) (quoting Eason v. Eason, 384\r\n  S.C. 473, 479, 682 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009)).Â  The family court's equitable\r\n  distribution award should be reversed only when the appellant shows the court\r\n  abused its discretion.Â  Lewis, 392 S.C. at 384-85, 709 S.E.2d at 651.Â \r\n  Similarly, &quot;[a]n award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Allen\r\n    v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Findings\r\n  of Fact\r\nHusband\r\n  first claims the family court erred in refusing to find the incomes, earning\r\n  potential, and expenses of the parties relating directly to issues of alimony,\r\n  equitable apportionment of property, and attorney's fees.Â  Husband is correct\r\n  that a number of the findings in the appealed order are only qualitative in\r\n  nature rather than quantitative; however, this deficiency is not necessarily\r\n  reversible error.Â  See Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405\r\n  S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991) (allowing the appellate court to make its own findings\r\n  of fact if the record is sufficient, even though the family court may have\r\n  failed to set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support\r\n  its decision).Â  We hold the record is sufficient to make our own findings of\r\n  fact regarding the issues Husband has presented on appeal and hold the family\r\n  court's failure to make them does not warrant a remand.[1]\r\nII.&nbsp; Alimony Award\r\nHusband\r\n  next complains the family court erred in awarding Wife permanent alimony of\r\n  $600 per month without making any findings about the income and expenses of\r\n  either party.Â  We disagree.Â  The family court made sufficient findings of fact\r\n  that, along with the evidence in the record, would support the alimony award. Â In\r\n  particular, the family court noted the following: (1) the parties were married\r\n  nine years, during which they enjoyed a comfortable standard of living; (2) at\r\n  the time of the divorce, Wife was sixty-one years old and Husband was\r\n  forty-seven; (3) Husband was at fault in the breakup of the marriage; (4)\r\n  Husband fired Wife, hired his paramour for her job, and paid his paramour the\r\n  same salary he paid Wife; (5) whereas Husband was in good health, Wife has been\r\n  under the care of a counselor because of the stress of the divorce and\r\n  Husband's adultery; (6) because of their ages, neither party would be able to\r\n  increase his or her earning power through additional training or education; (7)\r\n  although Wife was to receive several rental properties from the marital estate,\r\n  one of them was vacant and there was a mortgage payment associated with another\r\n  one of the properties; (8) Husband was to receive Pittman Professional Land\r\n  Surveying in his share of the marital estate and could increase his income\r\n  substantially through this asset; (9) the alimony would be taxable to Wife and\r\n  deductible to Husband; and (10) Wife was close to retirement age, had worked in\r\n  Pittman Professional Land Surveying during the entire course of the marriage,\r\n  and is not underemployed given her age, experience, position, and job\r\n  availability.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  although the family court did not state findings concerning the parties' earnings,\r\n  expenses, and needs in quantitative detail in its discussion concerning alimony\r\n  factors, it made such findings elsewhere in the order.Â  Earnings, for example,\r\n  are referenced in the court's discussions on the parties' educational\r\n  backgrounds, employment history and earning potential, and marital and nonmarital\r\n  property.Â  Similarly, the court discussed the parties' expenses and needs in\r\n  its findings on standard of living and on the parties' physical and emotional\r\n  health.Â  Given these findings, we hold the family court acted within its\r\n  discretion in awarding Wife permanent alimony of $600 per month.Â  See Craig\r\n    v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005) (&quot;An award of\r\n  alimony rests within the sound discretion of family court and will not be\r\n  disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;); Myers v. Myers, 391\r\n  S.C. 308, 314, 705 S.E.2d 86, 90 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating that in determining\r\n  an appropriate alimony award, &quot;[n]o one [statutory] factor is\r\n  dispositive&quot;).[2]\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Offset of Temporary\r\n  Alimony\r\nHusband\r\n  next argues the family court erred in declining to award him an offset of the\r\n  temporary alimony that he was ordered to pay against Wife's share of the\r\n  marital property.Â  To support his complaint, he asserts (1) the record lacks\r\n  support for the temporary alimony award of $2,500 per month and (2) in view of\r\n  the provision in the temporary order that the family court &quot;reserves the\r\n  right to offset temporary alimony against [Wife's] equitable distribution if\r\n  the Court at the final hearing determines that such is appropriate,&quot; the\r\n  family court's refusal to consider the possibility of an offset amounted to an\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  On appeal, he suggests that this court determine a\r\n  reasonable amount for permanent alimony and apply the remaining balance to\r\n  Wife's share of the apportionment of the marital property.Â  We find no\r\n  reversible error.\r\n Husband did not offer\r\n  any arguments or supporting authority for his position that the temporary\r\n  alimony award was excessive or otherwise unwarranted.Â  We therefore hold he has\r\n  abandoned the issue of whether the record supports the award of temporary\r\n  alimony.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444\r\n  S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (holding the appellant, in failing to provide arguments\r\n  or supporting authority for one of his assertions, was deemed to have abandoned\r\n  the corresponding issue).\r\n In support of its\r\n  decision to decline to treat any part of the temporary alimony as an advance on\r\n  equitable distribution, the family court noted that both parties treated the payments\r\n  as alimony for tax purposes.Â  We agree with Husband that this alone would have\r\n  been insufficient to support the family court's refusal to exercise the\r\n  discretion it reserved in the temporary order to treat alimony paid during the\r\n  pendency of the litigation as an advance on equitable distribution.Â  The court also\r\n  found, however, that the amount of alimony Husband paid before the final\r\n  hearing was &quot;an appropriate amount of alimony as temporary alimony,&quot; and\r\n  we have found nothing in the record on appeal warranting reversal of this\r\n  finding.\r\nAt\r\n  the temporary hearing in November 2007, Wife revealed on her financial\r\n  declaration she was earning $1,030.75 per month from her job as a surgical\r\n  nurse.Â  In addition, she noted two sources of rental income of $900 per month\r\n  and $1,025 per month, as well as her monthly salary from Pittman Professional Land Surveying of $4,166.67.Â  In the temporary order, the family\r\n  court noted Husband had terminated Wife's employment with the business and\r\n  found Wife was able to work but had not been employed full-time outside the\r\n  business for several years.Â  In directing Husband to pay temporary alimony of\r\n  $2,500 per month, the court encouraged Wife to find employment and specifically\r\n  &quot;reserve[d] the right to offset temporary alimony against [Wife's]\r\n  equitable distribution if the Court at the final hearing determines that such\r\n  is appropriate.&quot;Â  According to Wife's final financial declaration, dated\r\n  January 20, 2009, she was earning $3,194 per month from her job.[3] Â The portions of the transcript included in the record on appeal, however, do\r\n  not indicate when Wife's job earnings increased.Â  During oral argument, counsel\r\n  for Wife advised that no such information was presented during the hearing, and\r\n  opposing counsel offered no opposition to this assertion during rebuttal.Â  Neither\r\n  party suggested any other variables that this court could consider in\r\n  determining whether Husband could receive an offset of the temporary alimony\r\n  that he paid against Wife's share of the marital property.Â  We therefore hold\r\n  the record is insufficient for this court to make findings of fact as to\r\n  whether any part of the temporary alimony paid should be offset against Wife's\r\n  share of the marital estate.Â  See Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee\r\n    VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996) (stating\r\n  the appellant has the burden of providing a sufficient record upon which the\r\n  appellate court can make a decision). Â Moreover, given the Supreme\r\n  Court's recent censure of allowing &quot;a second bite at the apple,&quot; we\r\n  decline to remand the matter to the family court for further proceedings on\r\n  this issue. Â Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. at 393 n.11, 709 S.E.2d at 656\r\n  n.11. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  next challenges the award of attorney's fees to Wife, arguing (1) the family\r\n  court made insufficient findings of fact to support the award; (2) the family\r\n  court appeared to have placed undue emphasis on his marital misconduct, noting\r\n  further that he freely admitted his adultery; (3) the family court penalized\r\n  him for refusing to concede the issue of transmutation; (4) the family court\r\n  did not give due consideration to the consequences of the award on Husband's\r\n  finances; (5) Wife made spurious claims during the proceedings regarding\r\n  valuation of certain assets; and (6) Wife wasted money on unnecessary private\r\n  investigator fees.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  See O'Neill v.\r\n    O'Neill, 293 S.C. 112, 119, 359 S.E.2d 68, 73 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;It is\r\n  elementary that an award of attorneys' fees is discretionary with the trial\r\n  judge.&quot;).Â  Here, the family court awarded Wife only fifty-six percent of\r\n  her total fee; thus, we find the court gave sufficient consideration to any\r\n  misconduct on Wife's part that prolonged the litigation unnecessarily.Â \r\n  Furthermore, although we do not dispute that Husband has the right to advance a\r\n  meritorious position on certain issues even if they are ultimately rejected by\r\n  the family court, this right does not override the principle that beneficial\r\n  results obtained by counsel remains a factor in determining a reasonable\r\n  attorney's fee in a family court case.Â  See Glasscock v. Glasscock,\r\n  304 S.C. 158, 160-61, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991) (rejecting the appellant's\r\n  argument that an attorney's fee awarded by the family court was in effect a\r\n  contingency fee, but nevertheless citing &quot;beneficial results\r\n  obtained&quot; as one of the six factors in determining a reasonable attorney's\r\n  fee). \r\nV.&nbsp; Valuation of Vehicles\r\nHusband\r\n  next argues the family court erred in finding that a Volvo and a Volkswagen,\r\n  both of which were awarded to Wife, were each worth $8,000.Â  He claims Wife did\r\n  not offer testimony or other evidence about the value and that the values that\r\n  he presented in his testimony were the only competent evidence on this issue.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  In the marital assets addendum to Wife's financial declaration,\r\n  she listed both vehicles with the corresponding values.Â  Although, as Husband\r\n  argues in his reply brief, he conceded to admitting the addendum only as a\r\n  summary of Wife's testimony, there is nothing in the record indicating the\r\n  family court admitted it for only this limited purpose.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  statement by Wife's counsel that the vehicles were &quot;$8,000 each&quot; was\r\n  made during Wife's direct examination and was not a statement by counsel to the\r\n  court.Â  Though the inquiry was not artfully presented, common sense warrants\r\n  interpreting it as a question.Â  We hold Wife, in answering this question in the\r\n  affirmative, presented evidence of the values of these items.Â  See Reiss\r\n    v. Reiss, 392 S.C. 198, 204, 708 S.E.2d 799, 802 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating\r\n  the family court &quot;has broad discretion in valuing marital property&quot;\r\n  and its valuation of marital assets &quot;will not be disturbed absent an abuse\r\n  of discretion&quot;).\r\nVI.&nbsp; Transmutation of\r\n  Pittman Professional Land Surveying\r\n The family court\r\n  found Pittman Professional Land Surveying had been transmuted into marital\r\n  property &quot;as evidenced by the intent of [Husband] to treat the same as a\r\n  marital asset,&quot; but made no findings as to Wife's intent.Â  Husband\r\n  disputes the finding concerning his intent that to treat the asset as marital\r\n  property, arguing (1) he never referred in any way to the business that would\r\n  indicate that Wife had any interest in it; (2) Wife was only an employee of the\r\n  business and received a salary for her services and, after she was discharged,\r\n  unemployment benefits to which she would not have been entitled if she had an\r\n  ownership interest in the business; and (3) an unlimited guarantee provided by\r\n  Wife to help secure credit for the business had expired several years before\r\n  the commencement of this action.Â  We hold these arguments do not warrant\r\n  reversal of the finding by the family court that Wife met her burden to prove\r\n  transmutation.Â  \r\n Property\r\n  acquired by either party before the marriage is considered nonmarital; however,\r\n  it may be transmuted into marital property if &quot;(1) it becomes so\r\n  commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly\r\n  titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it\r\n  marital property.&quot;Â  Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753,\r\n  756 (Ct. App. 1996) (emphases added).Â  &quot;The spouse claiming transmutation\r\n  must produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties\r\n  themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n We agree with\r\n  Wife the record supports the family court's finding that Husband intended to\r\n  treat Pittman Professional Land Surveying as a marital asset.Â  Wife was listed as\r\n  secretary for the corporation.Â  After the parties married in 2000, Wife, with\r\n  Husband's consent, reduced the hours she worked at her nursing job to work\r\n  full-time in the business and thus contributed less to her 401K and retirement\r\n  accounts.Â  Most significantly, Husband and Wife agreed that the business would\r\n  pay Wife a higher salary for her services than what her services warranted with\r\n  the expectation that this business decision would benefit both parties during\r\n  their retirement together.Â  Under these circumstances, we decline to disturb\r\n  the finding that Pittman Professional Land Surveying had been transmuted.Â  See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655 (&quot;[T]he family\r\n  court's factual findings will be affirmed unless 'appellant satisfies this\r\n  court that the preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the\r\n  [family] court.'&quot;) (quoting Finley v. Cartwright, 55 S.C. 198, 202,\r\n  33 S.E.2d 359, 360-61 (1899)).\r\nVII.&nbsp; Equitable\r\n  Apportionment of Pittman Professional Land Surveying\r\nHusband\r\n  further argues that if we uphold the family court's finding that Pittman\r\n  Professional Land Surveying is a marital asset, Wife's interest in this asset\r\n  should have been limited to a special equity.Â  In the alternative, Husband\r\n  contends he should have received credit for the premarital value of the\r\n  business.Â  We reject both arguments.\r\nAt\r\n  the final hearing, objective evidence was presented to show that during the\r\n  marriage, both parties regarded the business as the common property of the\r\n  marriage.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d\r\n  107, 110-11 (Ct. App. 1988) (&quot;The spouse claiming transmutation must\r\n  produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties\r\n  themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.&quot;).Â \r\n  The parties pooled their earnings, and with Husband's approval the business\r\n  paid Wife a higher salary with the objective of increasing her Social Security\r\n  income and ultimately providing more money for both parties during their\r\n  retirement.Â  In addition, Wife relinquished retirement benefits that she could\r\n  have earned through full-time nursing work in order to devote time to\r\n  developing the business.Â  She made this sacrifice with the expectation that the\r\n  business would take care of both parties when they retired.Â  We therefore uphold\r\n  the family court's finding that the business was transmuted into marital\r\n  property and further hold it is unnecessary to consider whether Wife should\r\n  have received only a special equity in this asset.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of his position that he should have received some credit for the\r\n  premarital value of the business, Husband argues &quot;the trial judge\r\n  certainly had no problem in 'backing out' the nonmarital portion of the wife's\r\n  retirement savings plan.&quot;Â  Whereas, however, the family court determined\r\n  that the entire business had been transmuted into a marital asset, there was no\r\n  finding that the nonmarital portion of Wife's retirement account had been\r\n  transmuted.Â  The distribution of Wife's retirement account was based on a\r\n  completely different premise from the distribution of Pittman Professional Land\r\n  Surveying.Â  In the case of the business, the premarital value of that asset was\r\n  determined to have been transmuted into marital property. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nVIII.Â  Laptop Computer\r\nFinally,\r\n  Husband argues the family court should not have allowed Wife to retain\r\n  possession of a laptop computer that she purchased with company funds after the\r\n  filing of this action.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n In allowing Wife to\r\n  retain the computer, the court noted only that &quot;no credible testimony was\r\n  offered as to its value.&quot;Â  It was undisputed, however, that Wife purchased\r\n  the computer after the filing of this action with funds belonging to Pittman\r\n  Professional Land Surveying, an asset awarded in its entirety to Husband as his\r\n  portion of the marital estate.Â  We agree with Husband that the award to him of\r\n  the business, together with all its assets, should have included the laptop.Â  Although\r\n  the family court's remarks suggest Wife would have been ordered to reimburse\r\n  Husband for the computer had evidence of its value been presented at trial, the\r\n  absence of this information did not prevent the court from using a\r\n  &quot;reasonable means to achieve equity between the parties.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-660 (Supp. 2010).Â  Full equity between the parties could easily\r\n  have been attained by awarding the computer to Husband.Â  We therefore reverse\r\n  the award to Wife of the laptop computer and hold the family court should have\r\n  awarded it to Husband.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We affirm the\r\n  family court's decisions regarding alimony and attorney's fees.Â  As to\r\n  Husband's appeal of the equitable division award, we affirm the family court's\r\n  valuation of the equitable division award, the court's inclusion of Pittman\r\n  Professional Land Surveying in the marital estate, and the court's refusals to\r\n  limit Wife's interest in the business to a special equity and to award Husband\r\n  credit for the premarital value of the business.Â  We hold, however, the family\r\n  court erred in allowing Wife to retain possession of the laptop computer and\r\n  therefore reverse this provision of the appealed order.\r\n AFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Moreover, as explained below, we conclude from\r\n  remarks during oral argument that where the record lacked the necessary\r\n  information for this court to make a finding of fact on a particular issue,\r\n  this absence resulted from the fact that the relevant evidence was not\r\n  proffered to the family court.\r\n[2]Â  We further note that, contrary to Husband's\r\n  assertion in his reply brief that Wife has the option of receiving her Social\r\n  Security benefits and continuing to work, this option would be available only\r\n  when she reached &quot;full retirement age,&quot; which she had not done at the\r\n  time the divorce decree was issued.\r\n[3]Â  At this time, one of Wife's rental properties was\r\n  vacant; therefore, she was receiving only $1,025 per month in rental income. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4768","title":"State v.

Maryland[1]; (2) his motion to suppress a gun found in the jail\r\n  after his arrest on an unrelated charge; (3) his request to call an expert to\r\n  rebut the State's expert's opinion testimony when the opinion was not contained\r\n  in the expert's report; and (4) his Batson v. Kentucky[2] motion and motion to set aside the jury because the State's peremptory\r\n  challenges were racially motivated and eliminated all African-American males\r\n  from the jury.Â  We affirm.[3]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 10 p.m. on\r\n  April 15, 2006, Martha Santiago picked up her teenage daughter from a\r\n  restaurant where her daughter was employed.Â  Immediately after her daughter\r\n  entered the passenger side of Santiago's van, a man opened Santiago's door,\r\n  pointed a gun at her, and demanded money.Â  He shot her in the eye when she told\r\n  him she had no money.Â  Santiago tried to shut the van door, but the man opened\r\n  the door and shot her in the arm.Â  Santiago's daughter gave the man the forty\r\n  dollars she had earned from working that evening, and he fled.Â  Santiago\r\n  was taken to a hospital, and doctors removed a bullet from her arm.Â  Deputy\r\n  Rick Elms, the lead investigator in the case, took photographs of Santiago's injuries\r\n  while she was in the hospital.Â  Santiago also provided officers with a\r\n  description of the assailant for a composite sketch.Â  Approximately one hour\r\n  after Santiago's shooting, officers spotted Garris and his brother, Quentin\r\n  Garris, near their residence &quot;about three blocks&quot; from the\r\n  restaurant.\r\nAlmost two weeks later, police\r\n  arrested Garris on an unrelated offense.[4] Upon his arrival at the jail, officers conducted a pat down search of Garris and\r\n  placed him in a vacant holding cell.Â  A short time later, a fellow inmate working\r\n  at the jail found a small caliber revolver while emptying Garris' food tray.Â  The\r\n  bullet retrieved from Santiago's arm matched the gun found on Garris' food\r\n  tray.Â  Additionally, an officer obtained samples from Garris' hands at the time\r\n  of his arrest, and a gunshot residue analysis revealed gunshot residue on both\r\n  his hands.Â Â Â  \r\nA grand jury indicted Garris\r\n  for armed robbery, ABWIK, and possession of a firearm during the commission of\r\n  a violent crime.Â  Prior to trial, Garris moved to suppress the gun found at the\r\n  jail, arguing the jury's knowledge about the unrelated charge would be\r\n  prejudicial and improperly considered against him.Â  The court denied Garris'\r\n  motion, finding the probative value of the gun was not substantially outweighed\r\n  by any prejudicial impact.Â  At trial, when the gun was admitted into evidence,\r\n  Garris' counsel said: &quot;I object, but go ahead.&quot; \r\nDuring trial, Elms testified\r\n  he spoke to Santiago's daughter after the incident, and he obtained her\r\n  statement of the events and a description of the assailant.Â  Because officers\r\n  saw Garris in the area immediately after the incident, Elms testified he\r\n  prepared a photographic lineup that included Garris' picture.Â  Santiago's\r\n  daughter identified Garris in the lineup as a customer she had served in the\r\n  restaurant that evening.Â  Elms testified that when he showed the same\r\n  photographic lineup to the daughter nearly a month later, she positively\r\n  identified Garris as the person who robbed her and shot her mother, but\r\n  Santiago was never able to identify anyone.\r\nWhile Elms was on the stand,\r\n  the State moved to admit the photographs he took of Santiago in the hospital.Â \r\n  Garris objected, arguing the photographs were not relevant, and the prejudicial\r\n  effect outweighed any probative value.Â  The court overruled Garris' objections\r\n  and admitted the photographs into evidence. \r\nElms testified on\r\n  cross-examination about partial handprints that police recovered from\r\n  Santiago's van.Â  He testified the results showed the prints from the van did\r\n  not match Garris' prints, and he admitted the evidence had come out for the\r\n  first time in trial that day.Â  On redirect, when asked if there was\r\n  &quot;anything you can tell this jury&quot; about the fingerprint analysis, he\r\n  explained, &quot;I was told the [assailant] never actually touched the van.Â  We\r\n  just processed the van to be on the safe side, and that's to preserve evidence\r\n  in case he did touch it as he ran away from the scene.&quot;Â  He said the\r\n  likelihood of finding fingerprints are &quot;slim to none&quot; in these types\r\n  of cases.Â  However, Elms added the daughter told him at the scene that the\r\n  assailant touched the van. \r\nIn his investigation, Elms\r\n  also spoke to Garris' friends.Â  Elms testified that Andrew McBride and Freddie\r\n  White told him Garris had a small handgun the evening before the robbery.Â \r\n  White also testified he saw Garris with a gun the night of the incident.Â  White\r\n  told Elms he saw Garris around 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. the night of the incident,\r\n  and Garris was out of breath and sounded like he had been running.Â  Additionally,\r\n  White told Elms that Garris had two twenty-dollar bills in his possession the\r\n  day after the incident. \r\nAt the conclusion of the\r\n  State's case, Garris made a motion to\r\n  dismiss the case or declare a mistrial pursuant\r\n  to Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and Brady v. Maryland[5], arguing evidence was\r\n  presented at trial that was not presented in discovery, and he was not aware of\r\n  the evidence until &quot;in the midst of the court proceeding.&quot;Â \r\n  Specifically, Garris argued the State did not provide him with the photographs\r\n  Elms took of Santiago in the hospital, inform him Santiago was shown a\r\n  photographic lineup that contained Garris' picture, or give him the fingerprint\r\n  analysis results of the prints from Santiago's van.Â  Garris also renewed his\r\n  motion for a mistrial at the close of his case, which the court denied.\r\nThe jury found Garris guilty\r\n  as charged, and the court sentenced Garris to consecutive terms of twenty years'\r\n  imprisonment for armed robbery and ABWIK, and five years' concurrent imprisonment for possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by\r\n  the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Thus, on review, the\r\n  appellate court is limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his\r\n  discretion.Â  Id. Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the court's\r\n  decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 619, 567 S.E.2d 523, 526\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Motion to Dismiss or Declare a Mistrial\r\nGarris argues the trial court erred in denying his\r\n  motion to dismiss the case or declare a mistrial pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP,\r\n  or Brady v. Maryland[6] because the State did not provide him with the results of the fingerprint\r\n  analysis, photos of Santiago's injuries,\r\n  or the photographic lineup shown to Santiago.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to\r\n  grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court.Â  State v. White, 371 S.C. 439, 443, 639 S.E.2d 160, 162\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The trial court should only grant a mistrial in cases of\r\n  manifest necessity and with the greatest caution.Â  Id. at 444, 639\r\n  S.E.2d at 162. Â It is within the trial court's discretion, however, to\r\n  determine whether such necessity exists under all the circumstances of each\r\n  case.Â  Id.Â  The trial court should first exhaust other methods to cure\r\n  possible prejudice before declaring a mistrial.Â  Id.Â  The defendant must\r\n  show error and resulting prejudice to receive a mistrial.Â  State v. Council,\r\n  335 S.C. 1, 13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999).\r\nOn appeal, this\r\n  court will not overturn the court's decision absent an abuse of discretion that\r\n  amounts to an error of law.Â  White, 371 S.C. at 443, 639 S.E.2d at 162.Â \r\n  South Carolina courts favor the trial court's exercise of wide discretion in determining\r\n  the merits of such a motion in each individual case.Â  Id. at 443-44, 639\r\n  S.E.2d at 162.Â  Thus, this court will intervene and grant a new trial only in\r\n  cases when an abuse of discretion results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;The granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which\r\n  should be taken only where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect\r\n  can be removed in no other way.&quot;Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 70,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 63, 73 (1998).\r\nAt trial, Garris\r\n  made a motion to dismiss the case or declare a mistrial based on a violation of\r\n  Rule 5, SCRCrimP, or Brady v. Maryland[7] regarding\r\n  the fingerprint analysis because he was not aware of the analysis or the results\r\n  until he questioned Elms during cross-examination.Â  Garris also asserted the\r\n  State had not given him the pictures of Santiago's injuries or a copy of the photographic\r\n  lineup, and he was not even informed Santiago had been shown a photographic\r\n  lineup until the day of trial.[8]Â \r\n  Garris asserted his first attorney, who was a public defender, made a Rule 5/Brady motion, and the fact that he subsequently hired private counsel did not negate\r\n  the motion.Â  The solicitor responded that she gave Garris' new counsel\r\n  everything that she had given to his first attorney, but she conceded Garris\r\n  did not receive a copy of the pictures of Santiago's injuries.Â  At that time,\r\n  the court held Garris' motion for mistrial in abeyance, and when Garris renewed\r\n  the motion at the close of his case, the\r\n  court denied his motion.\r\nGarris now argues\r\n  he was prejudiced by the fact that he did not know prior to trial that the\r\n  prints on Santiago's van did not match his prints because had he known, he\r\n  could have developed questions for cross-examination or hired his own expert to\r\n  develop the issue.Â  Garris also argues that had he known about the photographic\r\n  line-up that was shown to Santiago, he could have used it in his pretrial\r\n  hearing when he made a motion to exclude Santiago's daughter's photographic\r\n  line-up identification of Garris.[9]\r\nWe find the\r\n  omission of Santiago's photos was not material because nothing indicates Garris\r\n  was unaware of the extent of Santiago's injuries.Â  Additionally, Garris'\r\n  objection to the photos at trial was based on relevance and prejudicial impact.[10]Â  Thus, although Garris objected to\r\n  the introduction of the photos, he did not specifically object on the ground\r\n  that he had not previously received a copy of the photos.Â  As a result, we find\r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Staubes v. City of\r\n    Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (&quot;It is\r\n  well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).Â  \r\nGarris also\r\n  asserts he was unaware until the day of trial of the fingerprint analysis or\r\n  the results finding the prints did not match his prints.Â  Elms testified\r\n  officers processed Santiago's van for prints as part of their normal procedure\r\n  to preserve evidence and found partial handprints on the van.Â  Elms said the\r\n  prints taken from the van had been in the case file since the day of the\r\n  incident.Â  The prints were then tested and compared to Garris' prints, and they\r\n  did not match.Â  Elms did not think the prints were left by the assailant.\r\nGarris argues on\r\n  appeal that had he known the prints found on the van did not match his prints,\r\n  he could have &quot;hired an investigator to possibly learn who the\r\n  fingerprints belong to which could have raised the potential of identifying\r\n  someone else as the assailant at least to the point of creating a reasonable\r\n  doubt for the jurors.&quot;Â  However, Garris did not object to Elms' testimony\r\n  on the ground that he had not previously been given the fingerprint evidence\r\n  until after the State rested its case.Â  Therefore, we find this issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386,\r\n  393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (&quot;A contemporaneous objection is required\r\n  to properly preserve an error for appellate review.&quot;); State v. Burton,\r\n  326 S.C. 605, 609, 486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;Failure to object\r\n  when the evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.&quot;).\r\nAdditionally, Garris\r\n  asserts on appeal that he did not receive a copy of the photographic lineup\r\n  shown to Santiago, and if he had known about the lineup, he could have used the\r\n  information in his pretrial motion to exclude the lineup that was shown to\r\n  Santiago's daughter.Â  However, Garris did not make a contemporaneous objection\r\n  to Elms' testimony about the lineup that was shown to Santiago. Â Garris did not\r\n  make his objection to the testimony on the ground that he had not previously\r\n  been given the lineup evidence until after the State rested its case; thus, we\r\n  find this issue also is not preserved for our review.Â  See Hoffman,\r\n  312 S.C. at 393, 440 S.E.2d at 873 (&quot;A contemporaneous objection is\r\n  required to properly preserve an error for appellate review.&quot;); Burton,\r\n  326 S.C. at 609, 486 S.E.2d at 764 (&quot;Failure to object when the evidence\r\n  is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.&quot;).\r\nII.Â  Motion to Suppress Gun\r\nGarris argues the trial court erred in denying his\r\n  motion to suppress the gun found in Garris' jail cell after his arrest on an\r\n  unrelated charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nGarris made a pretrial motion\r\n  to suppress a gun found at the jail while he was incarcerated on an unrelated\r\n  burglary charge.Â  He argued it was more prejudicial than probative because he\r\n  was ultimately found not guilty of the unrelated charge, and it might prejudice\r\n  the jury.Â  The trial court found the probative value of the gun substantially\r\n  outweighed the prejudicial impact.Â  Before admitting the testimony regarding\r\n  the seizure of the gun, the court gave the jury a limiting charge that Garris\r\n  had been in jail for dismissed charges, and they were not to consider that\r\n  against Garris.Â  Garris objected when the gun was admitted into evidence, but\r\n  he did not object to the court's limiting instruction.Â  On appeal, Garris\r\n  argues he was prejudiced by the admission of the gun because the jury knew he\r\n  was arrested for a different charge and there was a reasonable probability the\r\n  jury would believe he had a propensity to commit crimes.\r\nEvidence is relevant if it\r\n  has &quot;any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\r\n  to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would\r\n  be without the evidence.&quot; Â Rule 401, SCRE.Â  All relevant evidence is\r\n  admissible.Â  Rule 402, SCRE.Â  However, even if relevant, &quot;evidence may be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\n  cumulative evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The admission of evidence is left\r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial court, whose decision will not be reversed\r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Howard, 384 S.C. 212,\r\n  220, 682 S.E.2d 42, 47 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  To warrant reversal based on the\r\n  admission of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the\r\n  ruling and the resulting prejudice.Â  Id. at 221, 682 S.E.2d at 47.Â \r\n  &quot;[E]vidence which is 'logically relevant to establish a material element\r\n  of the offense charged is not to be excluded merely because it incidentally\r\n  reveals the accused's guilt of another crime.'&quot;Â  State v. Wiles,\r\n  383 S.C. 151, 158, 679 S.E.2d 172, 176 (2009) (quoting State v. Green,\r\n  261 S.C. 366, 371, 200 S.E.2d 74, 77 (1973)).Â  \r\nAt the time of his arrest for the unrelated burglary, officers obtained samples from Garris' hands, and a\r\n  gunshot residue analysis later revealed gunshot residue on both hands.Â  Elms testified he received the bullet that doctors\r\n  removed from Santiago's arm and took it to the South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division (SLED) for comparison to the gun found on Garris' food tray at the\r\n  jail while he was incarcerated for the burglary charge.[11]Â \r\n  SLED determined the gun found at the jail fired the bullet that doctors removed\r\n  from Santiago's arm.Â  Additionally, Elms spoke to Garris' friend who told him\r\n  that Garris had a small handgun the evening before the robbery.Â  Thus, the gun\r\n  found at the jail linked Garris to the charges in this case and was logically\r\n  relevant to the case.Â  See State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 405,\r\n  673 S.E.2d 434, 441 (2009) (finding a gun from a subsequent shooting was logically\r\n  related to the instant case when the forensic evidence positively showed the\r\n  same gun was used in a prior break-in because a bullet found in the bedroom\r\n  where the victim was shot also matched the gun, and this connection was highly\r\n  probative on the issue of the identity of at least one of the intruders because\r\n  the victims in the instant case were unable to identify their attackers).Â  Moreover,\r\n  the court gave the jury a limiting charge.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court\r\n  did not err in denying Garris' motion to suppress the gun.\r\nIII.Â  Expert Testimony\r\nGarris argues the trial court erred in denying his\r\n  request to call an expert to rebut the reply testimony given by the State's expert\r\n  about what type of gun the residue came from because his opinion was not\r\n  contained in his report.[12]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\n&quot;[O]rdinarily, the admission of reply testimony\r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial court.&quot;Â  State v. Farrow,\r\n  332 S.C. 190, 194, 504 S.E.2d 131, 133 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Reply testimony should\r\n  be limited to rebuttal of matters raised in defense; however, the improper\r\n  admission of reply testimony will only result in reversal if the admission of\r\n  such testimony is found to be prejudicial.Â  Id.\r\nGarris took the stand and testified he did not have or\r\n  handle a gun the day he was arrested.Â  He did testify that he fired a rifle the\r\n  day before.Â  In response, at the close of Garris' case, the State called in\r\n  reply John Roberts, a SLED agent who performed a gun residue analysis on\r\n  samples taken from Garris' hands. \r\nIn proffered testimony, Roberts testified he found gun\r\n  residue on the front and back of both of Garris' hands.Â  As a result, he\r\n  proceeded with the second level of testing, which required a microscope.Â  At\r\n  the second level, he found residue on Garris' right palm, but the left palm was\r\n  inconclusive.Â  Therefore, Roberts concluded either Garris had fired a weapon in\r\n  the six hours before the test, or he had been near the weapon when it was\r\n  fired.Â  The court asked Roberts if he had an opinion as to whether the weapon\r\n  that was fired was a pistol or a rifle.Â  Roberts stated that in his opinion,\r\n  not with any reasonable degree of certainty, it was a pistol.Â  Garris objected\r\n  to Roberts' opinion because it was not in Roberts' report, and Garris had just\r\n  learned about it during Roberts' testimony.Â  Therefore, Garris asserted Roberts'\r\n  opinion was prejudicial and not relevant.Â  However, the court allowed Roberts'\r\n  testimony to be presented to the jury to rebut Garris' testimony that he did\r\n  not own a pistol or fire one.\r\nDuring Roberts' testimony before the jury, the State\r\n  asked him if he had an opinion as to whether Garris shot a pistol or a rifle.Â \r\n  In response, Roberts stated he could form an opinion based on the amount of\r\n  residue found, and in this case, his opinion was it most likely was a pistol.Â \r\n  Garris objected, and the court overruled his objection.Â  At the close of the reply\r\n  testimony, Garris asked for an opportunity to rebut Roberts' opinion by calling\r\n  his own expert.Â  The court denied his request.\r\nOn appeal, Garris argues the court prevented him from\r\n  presenting a complete defense by not allowing him to call his own expert to\r\n  rebut Roberts' testimony.Â  He asserts he was prejudiced by the inability to\r\n  call his own expert because Roberts' opinion was not in his report.\r\nÂ The State put Roberts on the stand in reply to rebut\r\n  Garris' testimony that he did not own a pistol and had not shot one the day of\r\n  the incident.Â  Thus, Roberts' testimony was properly limited to a reply to\r\n  Garris' testimony, and Garris cannot claim he did not have an adequate\r\n  opportunity to contest the evidence.Â  See Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v.\r\n    S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 438, 319 S.E.2d 695, 700 (1984) (holding\r\n  the limited nature of the rebuttal evidence did not substantiate appellant's\r\n  claim that it was without an adequate opportunity to contest such evidence\r\n  because the issues addressed in rebuttal were the identical issues identified\r\n  and pursued by appellant's own witness).Â  Additionally, Garris was able to\r\n  cross-examine Roberts about his opinion.\r\nTherefore, we find Garris has failed to demonstrate\r\n  how he was prejudiced by not being permitted to call his own expert to rebut\r\n  Roberts' testimony, and the trial court did not err in denying Garris' request\r\n  to call an expert to rebut the State's expert's testimony. \r\nIV.Â  Jury Strike\r\nGarris argues the trial court erred in denying his Batson\r\n  v. Kentucky[13] Â motion and refusing to set aside the jury because the State's peremptory\r\n  challenges were racially motivated and eliminated all African-American males\r\n  from the jury.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Batson, the Supreme Court of the United\r\n  States held that the Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from\r\n  challenging &quot;potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the\r\n  assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially [sic] to\r\n  consider the State's case against a black defendant.&quot;Â  Id. at 89; see State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 415, 645 S.E.2d 904, 909 (2007) (&quot;The\r\n  Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution\r\n  prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.&quot;).Â \r\n  However, a solicitor can strike a potential juror based on his or her demeanor\r\n  and disposition.Â  State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 538, 413 S.E.2d 323,\r\n  325 (1991).\r\nIn Evins, our supreme\r\n  court explained the proper procedure for a Batson hearing:\r\n\r\n  After a\r\n    party objects to a jury strike, the proponent of the strike must offer a\r\n    facially race-neutral explanation. Â Once the proponent states a reason that is\r\n    race-neutral, the burden is on the party challenging the strike to show the\r\n    explanation is mere pretext, either by showing similarly situated members of\r\n    another race were seated on the jury or that the reason given for the strike is\r\n    so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite a lack of\r\n    disparate treatment.\r\n\r\n373\r\n  S.C. at 415, 645 S.E.2d at 909.Â  &quot;The burden of persuading the court that\r\n  a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on the opponent of\r\n  the strike.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The trial court's findings regarding purposeful\r\n  discrimination are given great deference and will not be set aside by this\r\n  court unless clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 416, 645 S.E.2d at 909-10.Â \r\n  &quot;It is within the discretion of the trial judge to determine purposeful\r\n  discrimination based on the 'totality of relevant facts,' including the\r\n  credibility of the solicitor.&quot; Â Wilder, 306 S.C. at 538, 413 S.E.2d\r\n  at 325.Â  A defendant has no right to trial by a particular jury, and the right\r\n  to serve on a jury and not be discriminated against because of race or gender\r\n  belongs to the potential juror, not a litigant.Â  Evins, 373 S.C. at 416,\r\n  645 S.E.2d at 910.Â  \r\nDuring jury selection, the\r\n  State exercised four peremptory strikes against four African-Americans â€“ two\r\n  males and two females.Â  Immediately after jury selection, Garris made a motion\r\n  to set aside the jury based on a Batson violation.Â  On appeal, Garris\r\n  argues two of the State's peremptory challenges were racially motivated, and\r\n  the court erred in refusing to set aside the jury.Â  Garris alleges the State's\r\n  reasons for striking jurors number 116 and 50, both African-American males,\r\n  were pretexual.\r\nThe State explained it struck\r\n  juror number 116 because the juror said he could not read or write well and\r\n  sometimes he had trouble understanding things.Â  The solicitor found the juror's\r\n  comment troubling &quot;because this is a very complex case with lots of\r\n  witnesses and it's â€“ it really will be like putting a puzzle together.Â  He's\r\n  got to figure out that this person testified to this because down the line it\r\n  relates to this.Â  And I just think it would be too complex for him.&quot;Â \r\n  Garris argued the State's reason was pretexual; however, he agreed with the trial\r\n  court that no other jurors were similarly situated.\r\nThe State explained it struck\r\n  juror number 50 because he was close in age to Garris and was from Manning;\r\n  therefore, the solicitor assumed that the juror and Garris went to school\r\n  together.Â  Garris argued this reason was also pretextual because &quot;just\r\n  because he's young, lives here in Manning doesn't necessarily mean he knows Mr.\r\n  Garris,&quot; &quot;doesn't mean he has some connection or affiliation with Mr.\r\n  Garris,&quot; and &quot;he didn't say he knew Mr. Garris . . . when the\r\n  question was posed to the jury panel.&quot;Â  Garris also pointed out that the\r\n  State did not strike a white male who was also close in age to Garris.Â  The\r\n  State responded that juror lived in Turbeville.Â  \r\nThe court stated the strike\r\n  of juror number 50 gave him pause, but that he was required to look at the\r\n  totality of the circumstances and the burden was on Garris to prove the strike\r\n  was used in a racially-biased manner.Â  The court then denied Garris' motion and\r\n  seated the jury as selected.Â  The State's reasons for striking jurors do not\r\n  have to be reasonably specific or legitimate.Â  State v. Easler, 322 S.C.\r\n  333, 350, 471 S.E.2d 745, 755 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The reason need only be race\r\n  neutral.Â  Id.Â  We do not find the court's rulings regarding purposeful\r\n  discrimination were clearly erroneous based on the totality of relevant facts.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly determined the solicitor's stated\r\n  reasons for striking the jurors were race-neutral, and Garris' Batson motion was properly denied.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Garris' convictions of armed robbery, ABWIK, and\r\n  possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKONDUROS and GEATHERS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n[2]Â  476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n[3]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[4] Garris was arrested for burglary, but was eventually\r\n  found not guilty of that charge.\r\n[5] 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n[6] 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n[7]Â  Rule 5 provides that upon request by a defendant,\r\n  the prosecution must permit the defendant to inspect and copy any books, papers,\r\n  documents, photographs, tangible objects, results or reports of physical or\r\n  mental examinations, or scientific tests or experiments, or copies or portions\r\n  thereof, that are within the possession, custody, or control of the\r\n  prosecution, or the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due\r\n  diligence may become known to the prosecution, and that are material to the\r\n  preparation of defendant's defense or are intended for use by the prosecution\r\n  as evidence in chief at the trial. Â Rule 5(a)(1)(C)-(D), SCRCrimP.Â  The Brady court held &quot;the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an\r\n  accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either\r\n  to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\r\n  prosecution.&quot;Â  373 U.S. at 87.Â  \r\n[8]Â  Garris objected to the introduction of the photos of\r\n  Santiago's injuries when the State sought to introduce them into evidence;\r\n  however, he only objected to them on the ground of relevance.Â  The court said:\r\n  &quot;Do you have an objection to [the] photos?&quot;Â  Garris' counsel\r\n  responded: &quot;Yes, sir.Â  In the course of the â€“ I don't have both pictures\r\n  in my discovery package.Â  But my objection would be relevance.Â  My argument is\r\n  prejudicial and a prejudicial [e]ffect far [outweighs] the probative\r\n  value.&quot;Â  The court then overruled Garris' objection, finding the\r\n  prejudicial impact did not substantially outweigh the probative value.Â  \r\n[9]Â  During the hearing, the court admitted the\r\n  photographic line-up.\r\n[10]Â  Garris does not raise this issue on appeal.\r\n[11] Â When Garris was arrested for the unrelated burglary,\r\n  he was taken to the jail.Â  Upon his arrival at the jail, officers conducted a\r\n  pat down search of him.Â  Garris then requested to use a bathroom, and officers\r\n  allowed him to use the bathroom in a vacant holding cell.Â  The cell's bathroom\r\n  had a door that Garris closed, and he was alone in the room.Â  After Garris\r\n  finished using the bathroom, his clothes were taken from him, and he was placed\r\n  back in the same unoccupied holding cell.Â  A short time later, a fellow inmate\r\n  found a gun while emptying Garris' food tray.Â  An officer at the jail\r\n  removed the gun from the trash, placed it in an evidence bag, and gave it to\r\n  the director of the jail.Â  The director then turned the gun over to the\r\n  sheriff's office.\r\n[12]Â  The State argues this issue is not preserved for\r\n  appeal because no proffer was made by Garris.Â  Generally, when testimony is\r\n  excluded, &quot;a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of\r\n  whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge, and an appellate\r\n  court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record\r\n  on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have been.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, 163, 634 S.E.2d 23, 29 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In this\r\n  case, however, Garris did not have an expert to proffer, and he was unable to\r\n  explain what his expert witness' testimony might have been because he did not\r\n  have one at the time.Â  Therefore, we address the merits of this issue.Â  \r\n[13]Â  476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4860","title":"VE Amick v.

(Palmetto)\r\n  argues (1) the trial court erred in denying Palmetto's motion for a directed\r\n  verdict because Palmetto's performance was excused due to V.E. Amick &amp;\r\n  Associates, LLC's (Amick's) failure to hire a Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (DHEC) qualified engineer to certify Palmetto's work and\r\n  (2) the trial court erred in denying Palmetto's motion for a judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial nisi remittitur because Amick will receive $137,650 in future contract\r\n  payments from DHEC, and this amount should have been offset from the jury's\r\n  verdict.Â  We affirm on both points.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nAmick\r\n  is a DHEC certified company that performs remediation construction projects to\r\n  rectify environmental contamination caused by petroleum products.Â  Palmetto is\r\n  also an environmental contracting company that remediates soil and groundwater\r\n  contamination caused by petroleum products.Â  Jimmy Cooper, Palmetto's owner and\r\n  principal shareholder, was formerly employed by David Jordan and David\r\n  Snodgrass, the owners of a large construction enterprise including Amick, L-J\r\n  Incorporated, and Environmental Engineering.Â  After Cooper was fired, he formed\r\n  Palmetto and began bidding for DHEC remediation projects through Amick.Â  \r\nCooper\r\n  assembled bids for three remediation projects (the Huse site, the Cromer's Grocery\r\n  site, and the Lakeside Market site) so that Amick could submit the bids to DHEC\r\n  for approval.Â  Amick would mark up Palmetto's estimates by 10% and submit the\r\n  bid to DHEC in exchange for furnishing Palmetto with performance bonds[1] required by DHEC.Â  DHEC awarded Amick all three contracts, and Amick subcontracted\r\n  100% of the DHEC contracts to Palmetto.Â  All of the contracts between Amick and\r\n  Palmetto were oral.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  trial, Cooper testified Palmetto submitted invoices and was paid by Amick on a\r\n  percentage basis once the company reached each reduction milestone set by\r\n  DHEC.Â  Cooper explained DHEC set four separate target level milestones of 25%,\r\n  50%, 75%, and 100% relating to the percentage of reduction of petroleum in the\r\n  groundwater.Â  Cooper agreed to reach 100% of the ultimate clean-up target\r\n  levels set by DHEC in exchange for 90% of the DHEC contract with Amick.Â  Once\r\n  Palmetto met a certain milestone, DHEC would pay Amick, and Amick would in turn\r\n  remit 90% of the DHEC payment to Palmetto.\r\nPalmetto\r\n  reached the 75% target level milestone on all three contracts at issue before the\r\n  company ceased working.Â  Cooper claimed Palmetto actually completed each\r\n  project to between 95% and 98% of the ultimate target levels, but he admitted\r\n  that he submitted no more invoices to Amick after reaching the 75% milestone.Â  Cooper\r\n  conceded the biggest reason he failed to meet the ultimate target levels for\r\n  the reduction of petroleum was that his company ran out of money and could no\r\n  longer operate.Â  Cooper also admitted Palmetto was paid for all the invoices it\r\n  submitted to Amick.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  Palmetto ceased working on the three sites, Amick hired Carolina Technical\r\n  Services, Inc. (CTSI) to complete the groundwater remediation contracts.Â  Bill\r\n  Wood, a CTSI employee, testified at trial on Amick's behalf and was qualified\r\n  as an expert in groundwater assessment and remediation.Â  Wood testified the\r\n  estimated cost to complete the Lakeside Market contract would be $88,297.Â  Wood\r\n  further testified it would cost an estimated $121,059 to complete remediation\r\n  on the Huse site.Â  Finally, Wood noted it would cost an estimated $78,037 to\r\n  complete remediation on the Cromer's Grocery site.\r\nWood\r\n  testified Amick was paying CTSI on a &quot;time and materials&quot; basis,\r\n  unlike the Amick contract with Palmetto.Â  Specifically, Wood explained CTSI was\r\n  receiving progress payments on a rolling basis, and the company did not have a\r\n  contract with Amick to complete the projects to 100% of DHEC's ultimate target\r\n  levels.\r\nHugh\r\n  Wilson, an employee of L-J Incorporated, testified DHEC was aware Amick had\r\n  hired CTSI to complete the three projects after Palmetto failed to do so.Â \r\n  Wilson also testified regarding Amick's damages and explained &quot;the way we\r\n  look at it is what we spent today on the project plus the estimated cost of\r\n  completion furnished by CTSI and crediting back the amount of the Palmetto\r\n  subcontract . . . .&quot;Â  Wilson testified the total amount needed to complete\r\n  all three jobs and make Amick whole, after subtracting payments from DHEC\r\n  intended for Palmetto, would be &quot;a little over $391,000.&quot;\r\nWilson\r\n  noted this amount represented the total payments to Palmetto and CTSI to date,\r\n  plus the estimated cost for CTSI to complete remediation, less 90% of the\r\n  amount of the original contract between Amick and DHEC (for specific damages\r\n  amounts, see charts in Section II of this opinion).Â  In other words, Wilson took\r\n  the total amount Amick would end up paying both subcontractors on the three\r\n  contracts with DHEC and subtracted the total amount Amick would have paid to\r\n  Palmetto had Palmetto fully performed its contract with Amick.Â  Palmetto's\r\n  counsel did not question the accuracy of any of the stated figures during\r\n  Wilson's cross-examination.Â  Â \r\nAt\r\n  the close of Amick's case, Palmetto moved for a directed verdict on multiple\r\n  grounds, including the contention that it &quot;would have been illegal until\r\n  Amick . . . hired another [professional licensed engineer] as an employee to\r\n  continue to certify completion to DHEC.&quot;Â  The trial court denied\r\n  Palmetto's directed verdict motion, noting:\r\n\r\n  [A]ll that stuff\r\n    about the regulation about having a qualified person doesn't matter.Â  DHEC\r\n    accepted those things, correspondence, all that stuff in there.Â  They can hire\r\n    somebody to certify it.Â  [Cooper] tried to get his brother one time.Â  But\r\n    anyway, no evidence that anything was ever kicked out because it was not\r\n    certified.Â  [Cooper] admittedly got paid 75 percent.Â  And in the light most\r\n    favorable to him, he had done 95 percent of the work and they've got 25 percent\r\n    of the money.Â  The fact that DHEC now wants a pristine situation, which it\r\n    probably can't do, indicates that the job was underbid to start with.\r\n\r\nPalmetto\r\n  did not present any evidence in its own defense.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court charged the jury as follows regarding the law of damages:\r\n\r\n  In the event of\r\n    a failure to complete performance of a contract according to its terms,\r\n    including a construction contract or subcontract, the injured party is entitled\r\n    to such compensation which would leave it as well off as it would have been had\r\n    the contract been fully performed.Â  Measure of damages ordinarily is the\r\n    reasonable cost of completion of the same work if completion is possible and\r\n    does not involve unreasonable economic wait.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  jury returned with a verdict for Amick in the amount of $391,209.21.Â  Palmetto's\r\n  counsel moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative,\r\n  a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial court noted, &quot;It is\r\n  actually too much money, isn't it?&quot;Â  The trial court further stated,\r\n  &quot;I don't think they could have, in fairness, issued that whole amount\r\n  against him when he was deducting the 25 percent.Â  But I didn't see the\r\n  figures.Â  Maybe they did.&quot;Â  Finally, the trial court suggested\r\n  &quot;$391,000 is too high, but it can stand if it was there.Â  It should be\r\n  something less than that. Â If he had completed the job he would have only gotten\r\n  much less . . . .&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  trial court encouraged the parties attempt to settle the case, and gave them a\r\n  week to do so.Â  The trial court also denied all post-trial motions except the\r\n  motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  During the post-trial\r\n  hearing, Palmetto's attorney argued frustration of purpose because Amick's only\r\n  engineer left the company in 2001, leaving no one to certify Palmetto's work to\r\n  DHEC.Â  Palmetto also argued the amount of damages presented during trial was\r\n  speculative because it included future payments to CTSI.Â  The trial court\r\n  noted, &quot;Unfortunately, sufficient evidence presented during the trial\r\n  sustains the verdict.Â  It's pretty high considering what he was paid and what's\r\n  left to be done, but I have no way of cutting it down to a figure that anybody\r\n  can live with.&quot;Â  The trial court denied Palmetto's new trial nisi remittitur motion and entered a judgment for the full amount of the jury's verdict.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n1.&nbsp;Did\r\n  the trial court err in denying Palmetto's motion for a directed verdict because\r\n  Palmetto's performance was excused due to Amick's failure to hire a DHEC-qualified\r\n  engineer to certify Palmetto's work?\r\n2. Did\r\n  the trial court err in denying Palmetto's motion for a judgment notwithstanding\r\n  the verdict or a new trial nisi remittitur because Amick will\r\n  receive $137,650 in future contract payments from DHEC, and this amount should\r\n  have been offset from the jury's verdict?Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nPalmetto\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motion on the\r\n  grounds of frustration of purpose and impossibility.Â  Palmetto contends its\r\n  performance was excused because Amick failed to employ another registered\r\n  engineer as required by DHEC regulations after Eugene Amick retired due to\r\n  illness.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  ruling on directed verdict or [judgment notwithstanding the verdict] motions, the\r\n  trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably\r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the\r\n  motions.&quot;Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d\r\n  231, 236&nbsp;(2002).Â  &quot;The trial court must deny the motions when the\r\n  evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;This Court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to\r\n  support the ruling below.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;Further, a trial court's\r\n  decision granting or denying a new trial will not be disturbed unless the\r\n  decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the court's conclusions of\r\n  law have been controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  party to a contract must perform its obligations under the contract unless its\r\n  performance is rendered impossible by an act of God, the law, or by a third\r\n  party.&quot; Â Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 593, 493\r\n  S.E.2d 875, 879&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  &quot;Impossibility must be real and not\r\n  a mere inconvenience.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;A party to a contract cannot be\r\n  excused from performance on the theory of impossibility of performance unless\r\n  it is made to appear that the thing to be done cannot by any means be\r\n  accomplished, for if it is only improbable or out of the power of the obligor,\r\n  it is not deemed in law impossible.&quot; Â Id. (internal quotation marks\r\n  and citation omitted).Â  &quot;A party claiming impossibility of performance has\r\n  the burden of proving the defense.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nPalmetto\r\n  argues performance was impossible because after Eugene Amick retired from\r\n  Amick, Amick did not employ a full-time engineer or geologist to sign and\r\n  certify Palmetto's submissions.Â  In support of its argument, Palmetto cites a DHEC\r\n  regulation relating to the qualifications for certified site rehabilitation contractors\r\n  and contends Amick did not comply with this regulation.Â  See 25A S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-98 (Supp. 2010) (listing the qualifications for an\r\n  applicant to become certified as a site rehabilitation contractor and noting\r\n  one method of becoming certified is for a company to employ a full-time\r\n  permanent employee who is registered as a professional engineer or geologist in\r\n  the State of South Carolina and who has at least three years of applicable\r\n  experience).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  DHEC regulation Palmetto relies upon did not make performance of the contracts\r\n  impossible as a matter of law.Â  At best, the evidence yields more than one\r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  See Sabb, 350 S.C. at\r\n  427, 567 S.E.2d at 236 (noting a trial court must deny a directed verdict\r\n  motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in\r\n  doubt).Â  Section IV(A)(4) of regulation 61-98 relates to the requirements for a\r\n  site rehabilitation contractor to become certified.Â  Section V(A)(3) of the\r\n  same regulation lists actions that permit DHEC to decertify a previously\r\n  certified contractor.Â  Finally, section V(A)(10) allows DHEC to make exceptions\r\n  for a decertified or suspended contractor to continue working on a particular\r\n  site on a case-by-case basis.Â  Therefore, DHEC had the responsibility to\r\n  decertify or suspend Amick's certification if the company failed to maintain\r\n  proper qualifications pursuant to section IV(A)(4) or to make an exception for\r\n  Amick to complete its contracts pursuant to section V(A)(10).Â  Until DHEC\r\n  determined decertification or suspension was necessary, performance of these\r\n  contracts remained possible.Â  Hawkins, 328 S.C. at 593, 493 S.E.2d at\r\n  879&nbsp;(&quot;A party to a contract cannot be excused from performance on the\r\n  theory of impossibility of performance unless it is made to appear that the\r\n  thing to be done cannot by any means be accomplished, for if it is only\r\n  improbable or out of the power of the obligor, it is not deemed in law\r\n  impossible.&quot;).Â  \r\nEven\r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Palmetto, it was merely an\r\n  inconvenience, and not an impossibility, for Palmetto to continue to work and\r\n  be paid after Eugene Amick retired from the company.Â  See Hawkins, 328 S.C. at\r\n  593, 493 S.E.2d at 879 (&quot;Impossibility must be real and not a mere\r\n  inconvenience.&quot;).Â  Bill\r\n  Wood, CTSI's employee, testified none of the reports submitted by CTSI on\r\n  behalf of Amick to DHEC had been rejected, even though the geologist who\r\n  submitted the reports was not an Amick employee.Â  Furthermore, Amick presented\r\n  evidence that DHEC continued to certify CTSI's submissions and make progress\r\n  payments after Eugene Amick retired.Â  Amick entered one of CTSI's reports into\r\n  evidence without objection.[2]Â  The\r\n  record reflects that a CTSI employee signed the report and submitted it to DHEC\r\n  on Amick's letterhead.Â  Finally, Cooper admitted that the reason Palmetto\r\n  ceased working on these projects and failed to reach the 100% milestone was\r\n  because his company ran out of money, not because of impossibility of\r\n  performance.Â  \r\nEvidence\r\n  in the record supports the trial court's ruling because the evidence yields\r\n  more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  See Sabb,\r\n  350 S.C. at 427, 567 S.E.2d at 236 (noting a trial court must deny a directed\r\n  verdict motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its\r\n  inference is in doubt); id. (stating an appellate court will reverse the\r\n  trial court's decision to deny a directed verdict motion only when no evidence\r\n  supports the ruling below).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's denial of\r\n  Palmetto's directed verdict motion.Â  \r\nII. Judgment\r\n  Notwithstanding the Verdict/New Trial Nisi Remittitur\r\nPalmetto\r\n  argues it is entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or a new trial nisi remittitur because the jury's award of damages in the amount\r\n  of $391,209.21 did not take into account $137,650 in future contract payments\r\n  from DHEC to Amick.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;[A] motion for\r\n  JNOV under Rule 50(b), SCRCP[,] is a renewal of a directed verdict motion.&quot;Â  Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 496&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;In ruling on a\r\n  motion for [JNOV], the trial court must view the evidence and its inferences in\r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Hawkins, 328\r\n  S.C. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 879.Â  &quot;The court must deny the motion if either\r\n  the evidence yields more than one reasonable inference or its inferences are in\r\n  doubt.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The verdict will be upheld if there is any evidence to sustain the\r\n  factual findings implicit in the jury's verdict.&quot;Â  Id. at 592-93,\r\n  493 S.E.2d at 879 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n&quot;When\r\n  the jury's verdict is inadequate or excessive, the trial judge has the\r\n  discretionary power to grant a new trial nisi.&quot;Â  Id. at 600,\r\n  493 S.E.2d at 883.Â  &quot;The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi is\r\n  within the trial judge's discretion and will\r\n  not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  600-01, 493 S.E.2d at 883.Â  However, the trial court must provide compelling\r\n  reasons for invading the province of the jury.Â  Green v. Fritz, 356 S.C.\r\n  566, 570, 590 S.E.2d 39, 41 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;The consideration of a\r\n  motion for a new trial nisi requires the trial judge to consider the\r\n  adequacy of the verdict in light of the evidence presented.&quot;Â  Hawkins,\r\n  328 S.C. at 600, 493 S.E.2d at 883. Â &quot;The trial judge, who heard the\r\n  evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial, possesses\r\n  a better informed view of the damages than [an appellate] court.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;Accordingly, great deference will be given to the trial judge.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  first address Palmetto's JNOV motion.Â  The record contained evidence to sustain\r\n  the factual findings implicit in the jury's verdict.Â  See Hawkins,\r\n  328 S.C. at 592-93, 493 S.E.2d at 879 (&quot;The verdict will be upheld if\r\n  there is any evidence to sustain the factual findings implicit in the\r\n  jury's verdict.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  Specifically, Wilson's testimony\r\n  concerning damages appears to account for future payments from DHEC to Amick.Â \r\n  Wilson noted he subtracted\r\n  90% of the entire original contract amount on all three contracts to offset\r\n  payments issued by DHEC when he calculated the total amount needed to make\r\n  Amick whole on these projects.Â  This calculation was proper as Palmetto was\r\n  only entitled to 90% of the original contract price.Â  &quot;Above and beyond\r\n  what we would have paid [Palmetto],&quot; Wilson estimated the total cost to make\r\n  Amick whole on all three contracts would be a little over $391,000.Â  The actual\r\n  jury verdict was $391,209.21, which is slightly over $391,000.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  affirm the trial court's decision to deny Palmetto's JNOV motion.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We\r\n  next address Palmetto's new trial nisi remittitur motion.Â  The\r\n  following chart lists all of the damages figures presented during trial:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Lakeside\r\n      Market Site\r\n    Cromer's\r\n      Grocery Site\r\n    Huse\r\n      Site\r\n    Total\r\n      for all three contracts:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Amick's\r\n      Past Payments to CTSI\r\n    73,001.94\r\n    51,073.11\r\n    103,626.01\r\n    227,701.06\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Amick's\r\n      Estimated Future Payments to CTSI\r\n    88,297\r\n    78,037\r\n    121,059\r\n    287,393\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Amick's\r\n      Past Payments to Palmetto\r\n    105,975\r\n    166,657.50\r\n    99,022.50\r\n    371,655\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Amount\r\n      of the DHEC Contract Apportioned to Palmetto[3]\r\n    (141,300)\r\n    (222,210)\r\n    (132,030)\r\n    (495,540)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    TOTAL\r\n      DAMAGES:\r\n    126,273.94\r\n    73,557.76\r\n    191,677.51\r\n    391,509.21\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the alternative, the jury could likewise have calculated the verdict of\r\n  $391,209.21 by tallying Amick's total payments to CTSI ($515,094.06), and then\r\n  subtracting 90% of $137,650, representing the future payments from DHEC to\r\n  Amick ($515,094.06 â€“ $123,885 = $391,209.06). Â This figure reflects the\r\n  difference in the total amount Amick will pay to CTSI as a result of Palmetto's\r\n  breach and the amount Amick would have paid to Palmetto on the remaining\r\n  milestone had the original contract been fulfilled.Â  This verdict also takes\r\n  into account the remaining 25% that DHEC will pay to Amick on the unfinished\r\n  portion of all three contracts ($137,650 = 25% of $550,600).Â  Therefore, the\r\n  verdict was a reasonable measure of the cost to complete the contracts after\r\n  Palmetto failed to do so.\r\nThe\r\n  following chart of damages reflects this second possible method by which the\r\n  jury could have reached its verdict given the evidence presented at trial:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Lakeside\r\n      Market Site\r\n    Cromer's\r\n      Grocery Site\r\n    Huse\r\n      Site\r\n    Total\r\n      for all three contracts:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Amick's\r\n      Past Payments to CTSI\r\n    73,001.94\r\n    51,073.11\r\n    103,626.01\r\n    227,701.06\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Amick's\r\n      Estimated Future Payments to CTSI\r\n    88,297\r\n    78,037\r\n    121,059\r\n    287,393\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Remaining\r\n      Unpaid Portion of original DHEC Contract Apportioned to Palmetto\r\n    (35,325)\r\n    (55,552.50)\r\n    (33,007.50)\r\n    (123,885)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    TOTAL\r\n      DAMAGES:\r\n    125,973.94\r\n    73,557.61\r\n    191,677.51\r\n    391,209.06\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  actual jury verdict was $391,209.21, which is virtually identical to the figure\r\n  generated by this second feasible calculation method.[4]\r\nBecause\r\n  the record contains adequate evidence to support the jury's verdict, we\r\n  conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Palmetto's\r\n  motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  See Hawkins,\r\n  328 S.C. at 600, 493 S.E.2d at 883 (&quot;The consideration of a motion for a\r\n  new trial nisi requires the trial judge to consider the adequacy of the\r\n  verdict in light of the evidence presented.&quot;); id. at 600-01, 493\r\n  S.E.2d at 883 (&quot;The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi is\r\n  within the trial judge's discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.&quot;).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the trial court's decision to deny Palmetto's directed verdict motion,\r\n  JNOV motion, and motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  DHEC required\r\n  a performance bond for each contract to guarantee Amick would be completing the\r\n  work.Â  If for any reason Amick failed to complete the work, DHEC could collect\r\n  the entire amount of the bond.Â  \r\n[2] Â The portion of\r\n  the trial in which this evidence was actually entered is not included in the\r\n  record on appeal.

Â However,\r\n  she did not reveal her plan to file for a divorce because she was afraid of his\r\n  reaction. Â According to Father, the parties had discussed moving the whole\r\n  family to Anderson because Mother was unhappy in Greenwood.Â  Father believed\r\n  their plan was for him to keep his job in Greenwood and commute from Anderson.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nIn July 2007,\r\n  Mother met Russell Mullinax (Mullinax), with whom she later became romantically\r\n  involved.Â  In August 2007, Mother took the children, left the marital home in\r\n  Greenwood, and moved into an apartment in Anderson. Â On August 2, 2007,\r\n  Father learned Mother had not planned on him joining her in Anderson.Â  When\r\n  Father asked Mother for a key to the apartment she was leasing, she informed him\r\n  that she considered them to be separated. Â She also suggested some time apart\r\n  to see if it would help their relationship.Â  \r\nApproximately\r\n  one week later, Father became suspicious Mother was having an affair. Â Mother\r\n  had left an old cell phone at the marital home, and Father noticed that the\r\n  phone continued to receive text messages.Â  Several sexually explicit text\r\n  messages were being delivered from the phone number belonging to Mullinax.[1]Â \r\n  On August 27, 2007, Father filed a complaint seeking a divorce on the ground of\r\n  adultery and custody of the parties' two daughters.[2]Â \r\n  The family court granted temporary custody of the parties' daughters to Mother. Â \r\nDuring the\r\n  following several months, Mullinax bought a house in Anderson County, and\r\n  Mother entered into an agreement with him to lease the house.[3]Â \r\n  While the children were living in this home with Mother, they made several\r\n  friends in school and in their neighborhood, and they became involved in\r\n  multiple extracurricular activities, such as piano lessons and gymnastics.Â  Mother\r\n  was very involved with the children's school activities and extracurricular activities,\r\n  and she stayed in contact with the children's teachers at least once a week.Â  All\r\n  three of Mother's children were very attached to one another.Â  Father struggled\r\n  financially during this time.Â  As a result, the marital home became the subject\r\n  of foreclosure proceedings. \r\nAt the final\r\n  hearing, the guardian ad litem (GAL) indicated that the\r\n  children's relationship with Mullinax was good.Â  She also testified\r\n  concerning her suspicions that Mother allowed Mullinax to stay overnight with\r\n  her while the children were present.[4]Â \r\n  The GAL hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance of Mother's\r\n  residence during the night of April 23, 2009, through the following morning. Â The\r\n  GAL also presented the private investigator as a witness.[5]Â  \r\nThe GAL also\r\n  testified that Mother was not forthcoming as to her relationship with Mullinax.\r\n  Â The GAL stated it appeared that the children had been coached by Mother to say\r\n  that Mullinax was not staying overnight at their home.Â  The GAL expressed\r\n  concern that Mother and her witnesses had gone to great lengths to deceive her\r\n  about Mother's relationship with Mullinax and his presence around the children.Â \r\n  The GAL indicated that Mother's behavior in this regard could negatively impact\r\n  the children and their values.Â  Although the GAL expressed concern over\r\n  separating the children, she declined to make a recommendation as to child\r\n  custody based on this factor alone.Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  issued a final decree granting the parties a divorce on the ground of one year's\r\n  separation and awarding custody of both children born of the marriage to\r\n  Father.Â  In its order, the family court found that the great lengths taken by\r\n  Mother to deceive the GAL, the family court, and others about her relationship\r\n  with Mullinax was &quot;troublesome not only as to her credibility but also as\r\n  to her lack of judgment, lack of mature reasoning, and ability to contrive and\r\n  scheme for her own purposes.&quot;Â  The family court expressed concern that the\r\n  children were not &quot;entirely open with the Guardian, as some of their\r\n  responses appeared to have been given to protect the mother or coaxed by\r\n  her.&quot;Â  The family court also found that Mother &quot;knowingly placed the\r\n  children in the middle of her relationship with [Mullinax] and, by doing so,\r\n  acted contrary to their best interests.&quot;Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe family court\r\n  denied Mother's motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n1. Did the family\r\n  court place an improper emphasis on Mother's relationship with Mullinax when there\r\n  was no evidence that this relationship had any detrimental effect on the\r\n  parties' children?\r\n2. Did the family\r\n  court err in separating Mother's oldest child from the parties' two younger\r\n  children when the separation was against the best interests of the children?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThis court may\r\n  review both factual and legal issues de novo.Â  Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons,\r\n  392 S.C. 412, ___, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see also Nasser-Moghaddassi\r\n    v. Moghaddassi,\r\n  364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;In appeals from\r\n  the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;). Â However, the court's\r\n  broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the burden of proving\r\n  to this court that the family court committed error. &nbsp;Id. at 190, 612 S.E.2d at 711; see\r\n    also Lewis\r\n      v. Lewis,\r\n  392 S.C. 381, ___, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011) (holding that the family\r\n  court's factual findings will be affirmed unless the appellant satisfies this\r\n  court that the preponderance of the evidence is against those findings).Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â  Mother's conduct\r\nMother argues\r\n  the family court placed an inappropriate emphasis on her relationship with\r\n  Mullinax because there was no evidence the relationship had any detrimental\r\n  effect on the parties' children.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the child's\r\n  welfare and best interests. Â Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d\r\n  612, 614 (1978). Â In determining custody, the family court &quot;must consider\r\n  the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent as\r\n    they impact the child.&quot; Â Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11,\r\n  471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (emphasis added). Â Because all relevant factors must\r\n  be taken into consideration, the family court should also review the &quot;psychological,\r\n  physical, environmental, spiritual, educational, medical, family, emotional and\r\n  recreational aspects&quot; of the child's life. Â Id. Â In other words, the\r\n  totality of circumstances unique to each particular case &quot;constitutes the\r\n  only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.&quot; Â Parris v.\r\n    Parris, 319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1995).\r\n\r\n  Here, rather than considering the totality of the circumstances\r\n  unique to this case, the family court narrowly focused on (1) the GAL's\r\n  speculation that Mother's perceived dishonesty would inevitably result in the\r\n  children developing the same trait; and (2) the GAL's and Father's\r\n  characterization of Mother as having an uneven temperament and overly emotional\r\n  responses to everyday situations.Â  Initially, we view as mere conjecture the\r\n  GAL's testimony that she suspected the children had been coached by Mother to\r\n  say Mullinax did not stay overnight at their house.\r\nEven\r\n  if the family court's perception of Mother's character traits is accurate, the\r\n  record does not show that these traits have substantially affected the children's\r\n  welfare.[6]Â \r\n  Therefore, they cannot, by themselves, serve as a basis for denying Mother\r\n  custody of her children.Â  See Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524,\r\n  527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975) (holding that in a child custody dispute, a parent's morality is limited in its force to what\r\n  relevancy it has to the welfare of the child); see also Clear v. Clear, 331 S.C. 186, 190, 500 S.E.2d 790,\r\n  792&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1998) (stating that the record contained no evidence\r\n  that a mother's topless dancing occupation adversely affected her ability to\r\n  parent the parties' children and, thus, the mother's occupation was not\r\n  relevant to the family court's custody decision); Stroman v. Williams,\r\n  291 S.C. 376, 380, 353 S.E.2d 704, 706&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1987) (holding that\r\n  a child custody award may not be used to penalize or reward a parent for his or\r\n  her conduct); cf. Baer v. Baer, 282 S.C. 362, 366, 318 S.E.2d\r\n  582, 584&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1984) (&quot;A single act of misconduct by the\r\n  custodial parent toward the noncustodial parent that does not substantially\r\n  affect the children's welfare provides no basis for changing custody from one\r\n  to the other.&quot;); Stroman, 291 S.C. at 379, 353 S.E.2d at 705&nbsp;(noting\r\n  that a father's claim that his child was &quot;substantially affected&quot; by\r\n  the mother's lesbian relationship was not supported by any specific citation to\r\n  the record and in fact there was nothing in the record showing that the child's\r\n  welfare was being adversely affected in any substantial way); Baer, 282\r\n  S.C. at 365-66, 318 S.E.2d at 584&nbsp;(holding that a mother's attempt to\r\n  deceive the father as to where she and the parties' children were to be moving\r\n  had no significance in the family court's child custody determination because\r\n  it in no way harmed the children).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  the family court overlooked the psychological, educational, emotional, and\r\n  recreational aspects of the children's lives, such as school, neighborhood, and\r\n  community ties as well as the traumatic effect of separating the two girls from\r\n  their half-sister (see Issue II below).Â  While in Mother's care, the children\r\n  were well-adjusted in school, they had many friends from school and their\r\n  neighborhood, they were involved in multiple extracurricular activities, and they\r\n  enjoyed the companionship of their half-sister at home.Â  Mother participated in\r\n  the children's school activities and extracurricular activities, and she diligently\r\n  attended to their medical needs.Â  However, the family court did not address how\r\n  a transfer of custody to Father would affect these positive aspects of the\r\n  children's lives. \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the family court failed to address the precarious circumstances in which the\r\n  children would find themselves under Father's care.Â  By the time of the final\r\n  hearing, Father's financial struggles resulted in the marital home becoming the\r\n  subject of foreclosure proceedings.Â  Neither Father nor the family court\r\n  expressed concern for where the children would live in the event that Father could\r\n  not prevent foreclosure on the marital home.Â  Therefore, the children would\r\n  face the threat of losing their home to foreclosure, with no plan for an\r\n  alternative living arrangement.Â  Counsel for Father conceded at oral argument\r\n  that Father's lack of such a plan was troubling.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we do not believe Father's lack of financial management skills is something\r\n  that can be cured by child support payments to him from Mother, as was implied\r\n  by Father in his testimony.Â  The record reflects Father's trouble maintaining\r\n  stable employment throughout the marriage and his continued reliance on Mother\r\n  to pay for most of the children's expenses, including medical care and school\r\n  expenses.Â  Father's inability to provide financial stability for the children\r\n  is a critical factor that the family court overlooked in determining child\r\n  custody.Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  sum, the family court placed an undue emphasis on Mother's relationship with\r\n  Mullinax and her perceived deceptiveness regarding this relationship. Â The\r\n  record demonstrates Mother's temporary custody of the girls provided a stable\r\n  home environment for them and positively influenced their lives.Â  The totality\r\n  of the circumstances set forth in the record indicates that it was in the\r\n  children's best interests to remain in Mother's custody because she is better\r\n  able to take care of their needs.Â  See Parris, 319 S.C. at 310,\r\n  460 S.E.2d at 572 (holding that the totality of circumstances unique to each\r\n  particular case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision on\r\n  child custody can be weighed). Â Therefore, Mother has carried her\r\n  burden of proving the family court committed error in awarding custody to\r\n  Father.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Children's\r\n  Separation\r\nMother maintains\r\n  the family court erred in separating her oldest child from the parties' two\r\n  younger children because the separation was against her children's best\r\n  interests.Â  We agree.\r\nPreserving\r\n  sibling relationships is an important factor in determining the best interests\r\n  of the children.Â  See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 528-29, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004) (&quot;[D]ivided custody should only be awarded where\r\n  there are exceptional circumstances.&quot;); In re\r\n    Guardianship of BJO, 165 P.3d 442, 446&nbsp;(Wyo.&nbsp;2007)\r\n  (noting the importance of keeping siblings together and holding that the strong\r\n  public policy toward preservation of sibling relationships is equally\r\n  applicable whether the children are full siblings, half-siblings, or\r\n  step-siblings); id. at 445 (requiring trial court to be explicit in\r\n  placing on the record the reasons supporting its determination to separate\r\n  siblings so as to assure that a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant\r\n  factors occurred prior to the award of custody).Â  The separation of\r\n  siblings should be avoided unless there are &quot;exceptional\r\n  circumstances&quot; present:\r\n\r\n  Divided custody (also known as split custody) is\r\n    disfavored because it separates siblings by giving each parent physical custody\r\n    of one or more of the children. It cannot be awarded absent exceptional circumstances,\r\n    such as a high level of conflict/hostility between children or the inability of\r\n    one parent to care for all the children. A forced separation from their\r\n    siblings can have a traumatic impact on children whose lives are already\r\n    disrupted by the divorce experience.\r\n\r\nRoy\r\n  T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 465 (4th ed. 2010).\r\nHere, the separation of the half-sisters is troubling.Â  Equally\r\n  troubling is the fact that the family court did not address this separation in\r\n  its order.Â  We find no exceptional circumstances in the record that require the\r\n  separation of the parties' children from their half-sister.Â  Further, Father\r\n  did not adopt Mother's oldest child when he had the opportunity to do so. Â As a\r\n  result, he found himself in a position unfavorable to seeking custody of this\r\n  child.Â  Therefore, it was in the best interest of all three children to stay in\r\n  Mother's care. \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, Mother has carried her burden of convincing this court that the\r\n  family court erred in separating the parties' children from their half-sister.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  family court's child custody award is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for the entry of an order requiring a custody exchange to occur as soon as\r\n  practicable. \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Mother\r\n  testified that the text messages were part of a running joke and were not meant\r\n  in a literal sense.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Although\r\n  Father had considered adopting Mother's oldest daughter before the parties'\r\n  separation, he has not sought custody of the child in this action.Â Â  Â \r\n[3] Â After Mother\r\n  and her children moved into the house, Mullinax continued to list this\r\n  residence on his driver's license, voter registration, and county tax\r\n  assessment.Â  However, both Mullinax and Mother insisted that he did not live\r\n  there and that when he stayed in the home overnight, the children were away on\r\n  visitation with Father.Â  They also maintained that Mullinax, who worked from\r\n  6:30 p.m. to approximately 6:30 a.m., would stop by the house after he finished\r\n  work to administer eye drops to Mother's large Weimaraner.Â  Both claimed\r\n  Mullinax stayed out of Mother's way while she was getting the children ready\r\n  for school.Â  They also claimed the children did not know Mullinax was at the\r\n  home in the mornings.Â  \r\n[4] Â Father\r\n  admitted to his own post-separation adultery.Â  However, little emphasis was\r\n  placed on Father's romantic relationships during this action.Â  \r\n[5] Â The\r\n  investigator testified that at 12:06 a.m. on April 24, 2009, he observed the\r\n  grill of a Ford F-150, which is the type of vehicle Mullinax drove, in the back\r\n  yard of Mother's residence.Â  Shortly after 7:09 a.m., the investigator was able\r\n  to photograph the truck behind the residence.Â  The investigator also testified\r\n  that he observed Mullinax's truck leaving the neighborhood at 8:08 a.m.Â \r\n  Mullinax's co-workers refuted the private investigator's placement of Mullinax\r\n  at the house at 12:06 a.m. by placing him at his work location at that time.Â  \r\n[6] Â Notably, counsel for Father conceded at oral argument that\r\n  Mother's relationship with Mullinax did not harm the children.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4862","title":"5 Star v.

Goldstein, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: 5 Star, Inc. filed this product liability action against Ford Motor Company alleging\r\n  that negligence in the design of a speed control deactivation switch caused a\r\n  fire that burned a 1996 Ford F-250 pickup truck.[1] Â However, 5 Star presented no expert witness to testify that Ford was negligent\r\n  in designing the switch, nor any other evidence that Ford breached its duty of\r\n  care at the time the switch was designed and manufactured.Â  We hold the trial\r\n  court erred in denying Ford's motion for a directed verdict.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Facts and Procedural\r\n  History\r\n5 Star is a lawn maintenance\r\n  and pressure washing company owned by Stan Shelby.Â  In February of 2005, 5 Star\r\n  bought a 1996 Ford F-250 pickup truck with 227,000 miles for $1,500.00.Â  On September\r\n  24, 2005, Shelby parked the truck for the weekend in 5 Star's North Charleston\r\n  warehouse, which also housed tractors, trailers, lawn mowers, and other\r\n  equipment related to the business.Â  When Shelby returned two days later he\r\n  discovered that a fire had occurred.Â  The truck was destroyed, and the building\r\n  and several other pieces of equipment were severely damaged.Â  There were no\r\n  personal injuries.Â  Before suit was filed and before Ford was given an\r\n  opportunity to inspect the truck, Shelby had the truck towed from his property\r\n  and crushed.[2]Â  \r\nAt trial, 5 Star called five\r\n  witnesses.Â  Benjamin Norris, the City of North Charleston Fire Department's\r\n  Chief Fire Investigator, testified that when he arrived at 5 Star's warehouse\r\n  he observed &quot;a Ford pickup truck sitting in the middle of the building.Â \r\n  It was extensively burned.&quot;Â  Norris testified that the most significant\r\n  damage to the building was directly above the truck's engine compartment, which\r\n  indicated to him that the engine compartment was the area of origin of the\r\n  fire.Â  Norris explained, &quot;I believe the cause of the fire was a defective\r\n  speed control deactivation switch because in that area that's the only thing\r\n  that will produce heat at that time.&quot;Â  Norris did not testify to any facts\r\n  or opinions related to Ford's conduct in the original design of the truck or\r\n  any of its component parts.\r\nLeonard Greene testified as\r\n  an expert for 5 Star in fire cause and origin and electrical engineering. Â Greene\r\n  explained that burn patterns shown by a photograph of the pickup truck indicated\r\n  that the &quot;origin of the fire appears to be right where the switch would\r\n  have normally been present.Â  And in my opinion, the cause of the fire was a\r\n  malfunction of the switch.&quot;Â  Greene testified &quot;it's a bad design&quot;\r\n  and explained that &quot;it would have been inherently safer to have designed\r\n  it so that it only had power on it when the ignition was on.&quot;Â  However, Greene\r\n  did not testify to any facts or opinions related to Ford's conduct in the\r\n  original design of the truck or any of its component parts.\r\n5 Star's other three\r\n  witnesses included a captain in the North Charleston Fire Department, who testified\r\n  as to his observations at the scene of the fire, and Shelby, who testified to\r\n  his observations and to the damages caused by the fire.Â  Neither testified to\r\n  any facts or opinions related to Ford's conduct in the original design of the\r\n  truck or any of its component parts.Â  The other witness called by 5 Star was\r\n  John Olson, a representative of Ford, whose testimony is discussed below.Â  \r\nFord made a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case and renewed it at\r\n  the close of all evidence.Â  The trial court denied the motion and submitted the\r\n  case to the jury exclusively on the claim for negligent design.Â  The jury\r\n  returned a verdict in favor of 5 Star for $41,000.00 in actual damages.\r\nII.&nbsp; Proving Negligent Design\r\n&quot;'When we review a trial\r\n  judge's . . . denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, we reverse only when\r\n  there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is governed by an\r\n  error of law.'&quot;Â  Watson v. Ford Motor Co., 389 S.C. 434, 455, 699\r\n  S.E.2d 169, 180 (2010) (quoting Austin v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp.,\r\n  387 S.C. 22, 42, 691 S.E.2d 135, 145 (2010)).Â  In this case, there is no\r\n  evidence that Ford was negligent in the design of the speed control\r\n  deactivation switch and thus, no evidence to support the ruling denying Ford's\r\n  motion for a directed verdict and for JNOV.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the jury\r\n  verdict in favor of 5 Star and enter judgment in favor of Ford Motor Company.\r\nIn 1985, this court held that\r\n  in addition to the three elements common to all product liability claims, a\r\n  plaintiff asserting a negligent design theory of recovery must prove that the\r\n  defendant manufacturer's conduct in designing the product breached its duty of\r\n  due care. Â Madden v. Cox,\r\n  284 S.C. 574, 579-80, 328 S.E.2d 108, 112&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985).Â  Since at least that time, a plaintiff has been required to prove four elements in\r\n  order to recover for negligent design in a product liability case: (1) he was harmed by the product; (2) the product was\r\n  in essentially the same condition as when it left the defendant; (3) the harm\r\n  occurred because the product was in a defective condition unreasonably\r\n  dangerous to the user; and (4) the\r\n  manufacturer breached its duty to exercise reasonable care in designing the\r\n  product.Â  Id.; see also Branham\r\n    v. Ford Motor Co., 390 S.C. 203, 210,\r\n  701 S.E.2d 5, 8-9&nbsp;(2010); Jackson v. Bermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C.\r\n  11, 15, 677 S.E.2d 612, 614-15 (Ct. App. 2009). Â 5 Star was required to present some evidence of each of the four\r\n  elements above in order survive Ford's motion for a directed verdict.Â  On\r\n  appeal, Ford contends 5 Star presented no evidence as to elements two and\r\n  four.Â  \r\nWe focus our analysis on the\r\n  fourth element.Â  In order to satisfy this element in a negligent design case, the plaintiff must prove negligent conduct on\r\n  the part of the defendant in the design of the product at or before the time of\r\n  manufacture.Â  Branham, 390 S.C. at 227, 701 S.E.2d at 17 (&quot;[T]he\r\n  judgment and ultimate decision of the manufacturer must be evaluated based on\r\n  what was known or 'reasonably attainable' at the time of manufacture.&quot;Â \r\n  (citations omitted)); see also Madden, 284 S.C. at 580, 328 S.E.2d at 112 (&quot;This\r\n  burden may be met by showing that the manufacturer was aware of the danger and\r\n  failed to take reasonable steps to correct it.&quot;).Â  In Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 539,\r\n  462 S.E.2d 321, 326 (Ct. App. 1995), this court explained the requirements of\r\n  the fourth element as follows:\r\n\r\n  [U]nder\r\n    a negligence theory [of recovery], the plaintiff bears the additional burden of\r\n    demonstrating the defendant . . . failed to exercise due care in some respect,\r\n    and, unlike strict liability, the focus is on the conduct of the . . .\r\n    manufacturer, and liability is determined according to fault.\r\n\r\n&quot;The focus [in a\r\n  negligence action] is upon the action of the defendant.Â  The mere fact a\r\n  product malfunctions does not demonstrate the manufacturer's negligence . . . .&quot;Â  Sunvillas Homeowners Ass'n v. Square D Co., 301 S.C. 330, 333, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 870 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  \r\nIn this case, Ford concedes\r\n  the switch was defective.Â  However, as we explained in the cases cited above,\r\n  the focus of the fourth element is on the defendant's conduct, not on the\r\n  product.Â  Therefore, mere evidence of defect is not sufficient to satisfy 5\r\n  Star's burden of proof as to this element. Â Rather, 5 Star was obligated to\r\n  offer evidence that Ford was negligent in its conduct.Â  5 Star not only failed\r\n  to present any evidence that Ford's conduct in designing the switch was\r\n  negligent, 5 Star failed to present any evidence of Ford's conduct whatsoever.Â \r\n  Neither Norris nor Greene testified to a single fact or event at or before the manufacture\r\n  of this truck and this switch.Â  Neither witness was qualified as an expert in\r\n  automotive design or any other area of expertise that would enable them to\r\n  offer opinions as to whether Ford's conduct was negligent.\r\nThe only other witness who\r\n  could have testified as to Ford's conduct in designing the truck or the switch\r\n  was John Olson, a design analysis engineer with Ford Motor Company.Â  The trial\r\n  court qualified Olson as an expert, but only in the field of &quot;fire cause\r\n  and origin and in particular as to vehicles.&quot;Â  Olson offered no facts or\r\n  opinions related to Ford's conduct in the original design of the truck or any\r\n  of its component parts.Â  Counsel for 5 Star asked Olson about his investigation\r\n  of the fire, how the speed control deactivation switch operates, and other\r\n  subjects that have no relation to Ford's conduct in designing the switch.Â \r\n  However, counsel did not ask Olson a single question about the process of\r\n  designing the switch, about what Ford knew or did not know at the time\r\n  regarding its safety, or about anything that occurred in 1996 or earlier.Â  The\r\n  only mention in the entire trial of what Ford knew or did not know about the\r\n  switch before 1996 was Greene's admission that he knew nothing on the subject.Â  \r\nThe limited evidentiary\r\n  presentation by 5 Star allows us only a scant understanding of the design and\r\n  operation of a speed control deactivation switch.Â  From what little testimony\r\n  there is in this record, however, we are able to determine that the switch serves\r\n  as a mechanism to deactivate the cruise control when the driver presses the\r\n  brake pedal.Â  The switch is wired into the brake light circuit, which, for\r\n  safety reasons, must remain energized at all times.Â  Keeping this circuit\r\n  energized allows the brake lights to be illuminated by pressing the brake pedal\r\n  even when the vehicle is turned off.Â  The switch is &quot;redundant,&quot;\r\n  meaning it serves as a back-up in case the primary deactivation switch\r\n  malfunctions.Â  The allegedly defective quality of the switch is that it allows\r\n  brake fluid, which is flammable, to remain in dangerous proximity to the\r\n  energized electrical circuit, separated only by a thin membrane.Â  Greene's\r\n  explanation of how this can start a fire was &quot;the protective device\r\n  [apparently a fuse] is not coordinated with the switch.Â  The switch is rated\r\n  for two amperes.Â  The protective device is rated for 15 amperes.Â  So the switch\r\n  can really overheat and start a fire before the 15-ampere fuse would ever\r\n  blow.&quot; Â \r\nIn order to gain more than\r\n  this limited understanding of the operation of the switch, and in particular,\r\n  in order to understand whether 5 Star met its burden of proving that the design\r\n  of the switch was negligent in 1996, a jury, the trial court, and this court on\r\n  appeal would need the benefit of expertise in several subjects that are not\r\n  included in this record.Â  In other words, this is precisely the type of\r\n  &quot;design defect claim&quot; our supreme court recently stated\r\n  &quot;necessarily involve[s] sophisticated issues of engineering, technical\r\n  science, and other complex concepts that are quintessentially beyond the ken of\r\n  a lay person.&quot;Â  Watson, 389 S.C. at 444, 699 S.E.2d at 174. Â When the\r\n  plaintiff in a product liability case bears the burden of proof as to any issue\r\n  within a subject matter beyond the common knowledge and understanding of lay\r\n  jurors, that plaintiff must present expert witness testimony in order to meet\r\n  its burden. Â 389 S.C. at 445, 699 S.E.2d at 175 (&quot;Expert testimony . . .\r\n  is necessary in cases in which the subject matter falls outside the realm of\r\n  ordinary lay knowledge.&quot;).[3]Â \r\n  Because 5 Star failed to present any expert testimony on the design of the speed\r\n  control deactivation switch and whether the design was negligent in 1996, the\r\n  trial court erred in not directing a verdict in favor of Ford.[4]\r\nREVERSED. \r\nTHOMAS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 5 Star made no claim for strict liability or breach of warranty.Â  \r\n[2] Ford asked the circuit court to dismiss the case as a\r\n  sanction for spoliation of evidence based on the destruction of the truck.Â  The\r\n  circuit court declined to dismiss the case but charged the jury that it could\r\n  draw a negative inference from the plaintiff's actions.Â  Ford appeals this\r\n  ruling.Â  While we are troubled by the intentional destruction of the truck\r\n  under any circumstances, particularly without notice to Ford and before Ford\r\n  was given a chance to inspect it, we do not reach the question of whether the\r\n  circuit court abused its discretion in ruling on the motion.Â  We also do not\r\n  reach two other arguments Ford raises on appeal.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (recognizing that an appellate\r\n  court need not address remaining issues when resolution of one issue is\r\n  dispositive).\r\n[3] We recognize that Watson was decided two years\r\n  after the trial of this case.Â  However, the requirement of presenting expert\r\n  testimony to meet the burden of proof on subjects beyond the knowledge and\r\n  understanding of lay jurors is by no means new.Â  See, e.g., Green v.\r\n    Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 192, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1978) (holding that\r\n  unless the subject is a matter of common knowledge, expert testimony is\r\n  required to establish that a defendant failed to conform to a required standard\r\n  of care in a medical malpractice case); see also Kemmerlin v. Wingate,\r\n  274 S.C. 62, 65, 261 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1979) (holding in public accounting\r\n  malpractice action: &quot;Since this is an area\r\n  beyond the realm of ordinary lay knowledge, expert testimony usually will be\r\n  necessary to establish both the standard of care and the defendant's departure\r\n  therefrom.&quot;).\r\n[4] In Duncan v. Ford Motor Co., 385 S.C. 119,\r\n  128, 682 S.E.2d 877, 881 (Ct. App. 2009), we affirmed a jury verdict\r\n  that Ford was negligent in the design of a speed control deactivation switch in\r\n  a 2000 Ford Expedition.&nbsp; However, this case is distinguishable\r\n  because the plaintiff in Duncan presented\r\n  expert testimony that Ford was aware of the defect at the time of manufacture\r\n  and Ford breached its duty to exercise reasonable care.&nbsp; 385 S.C. at\r\n  129-30, 682 S.E.2d at 882.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4863","title":"White Oak Manor v.

Â We\r\n  reverse and remand.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS AND\r\n  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nLexington\r\n  is a corporation licensed to do business in South Carolina and organized and\r\n  existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.Â  In 2001, Lexington issued an\r\n  insurance policy to White Oak, providing coverage from September 30, 2001,\r\n  until May 13, 2002.Â  From May 13, 2002, until March 31, 2003, there was a gap\r\n  in coverage with Lexington, during which White Oak was insured by another\r\n  carrier.Â  Lexington resumed coverage from March 31, 2003, until March 31, 2004. \r\nOn\r\n  November 3, 2001, a White Oak resident sustained an injury from the improper application\r\n  of a feeding tube by a White Oak employee.Â  On January 10, 2002, White Oak\r\n  notified Caronia Corporation (Caronia), the third-party administrator approved\r\n  by Lexington to receive notice, of the incident.Â  On March 27, 2003, a\r\n  malpractice lawsuit on behalf of the injured resident was filed against White\r\n  Oak.Â  \r\nA\r\n  mediation in the malpractice action was planned for August 2004.Â  In\r\n  anticipation of this mediation, counsel for White Oak sent a letter to\r\n  Lexington's attorneys informing them of the scheduled mediation.Â  In response,\r\n  on August 5, 2004, Lexington's counsel sent a letter to White Oak's counsel\r\n  asking whether White Oak was seeking coverage, the date and form of the first\r\n  demand against White Oak, and the date and form of any notice White Oak sent to\r\n  any other insurers.Â  During the following two months, attorneys for White Oak\r\n  had two conversations with counsel for Lexington regarding this letter. Â \r\nIn\r\n  December of 2004, counsel for Lexington again sent a letter to White Oak's\r\n  attorneys discussing coverage issues.Â  White Oak replied, and subsequently White\r\n  Oak and Lexington had a telephone conversation regarding notice to Caronia of the\r\n  claim against White Oak.Â  White Oak later settled the malpractice action.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  April 22, 2005, White Oak instituted the current action.Â  The policy in\r\n  question contains a &quot;service of suit clause&quot; that reads: &quot;It is\r\n  further agreed that service of process in such a suit may be made upon Counsel,\r\n  Legal Department, Lexington Insurance Company, 200 State Street, Boston,\r\n  Massachusetts Â 02109 or his or her representative.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 16, 2005, White Oak mailed the summons and complaint, return receipt\r\n  requested, with delivery restricted to the addressee, to &quot;Lexington\r\n  Insurance Company, 200 State St., Boston, MA Â 02109, ATTN: LEGAL\r\n  DEPARTMENT.&quot; Â The return receipt was dated May 20, 2005.Â  The\r\n  signature on the return receipt appeared to be from an individual unknown to\r\n  Lexington.Â  According to Lexington's internal mail log, however, the pleadings\r\n  were received on May 20, 2005, and personally delivered to Lexington's claim\r\n  counselor on May 27, 2005; however, according to Lexington, neither the claim\r\n  counselor nor the individual to whom the claim counselor was to pass such\r\n  information recalled receiving the pleadings.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 7, 2005, White Oak filed an affidavit of default.Â  In an order dated July\r\n  15, 2005, the trial court held Lexington in default.Â  On August 11, 2005, White\r\n  Oak filed a notice of motion and motion for damages pursuant to Rule 55(b),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  On September 14, 2005, White Oak filed an amended complaint substituting\r\n  certain defendants who are not parties to this appeal, which it served on\r\n  Lexington by mail the same day.Â  Attached as an exhibit to this amended\r\n  complaint was the order of default.Â  Lexington answered the amended complaint\r\n  on September 26, 2005, and contemporaneously filed a motion to set aside the\r\n  entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP.[2]Â \r\n  The trial court denied the motion and Lexington's subsequent motion to alter or\r\n  amend. \r\nOn\r\n  November 17, 2008, the trial court held a hearing on White Oak's motion for\r\n  damages.Â  On November 21, 2008, the court filed an order in which it awarded\r\n  White Oak judgment against Lexington in the amount of $153,266.Â  Lexington then\r\n  filed this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n&quot;The\r\n  decision whether to set aside an entry of default or a default judgment lies\r\n  solely within the sound discretion of the trial judge.&quot;Â  Sundown\r\n    Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus., 383 S.C. 601, 606, 681 S.E.2d 885, 888\r\n  (2009).Â  &quot;The trial court's decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the judge issuing the order was\r\n  controlled by some error of law or when the order, based upon factual, as\r\n  distinguished from legal conclusions, is without evidentiary support.&quot; Id. at 607, 681 S.E.2d at 888.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLexington\r\n  argues that the South Carolina Code provides for the exclusive method of\r\n  service upon a foreign insurance company and that White Oak was therefore required\r\n  to serve notice pursuant to statute regardless of the service of suit clause.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nSection 38-5-70 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2002) provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n  Every insurer shall, before being\r\n    licensed, appoint in writing the director and his successors in office to be\r\n    its true and lawful attorney upon whom all legal process in any action or\r\n    proceeding against it must be served and in this writing shall agree that any\r\n    lawful process against it which is served upon this attorney is of the same\r\n    legal force and validity as if served upon the insurer and that the authority\r\n    continues in force so long as any liability remains outstanding in the State.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  addition, the legislature has imposed the following requirement regarding\r\n  service on insurance companies:\r\n\r\n  The summons and any other legal process\r\n    in any action or proceeding against it must be served on an insurance\r\n      company . . . by delivering two copies of the summons or any other legal\r\n      process to the Director of the Department of Insurance, as attorney of the\r\n    company . . . .Â  A company shall appoint the director as its attorney pursuant\r\n    to the provisions of section 38-5-70.Â  This service is considered sufficient\r\n    service upon the company.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-270 (2005) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nIn\r\n  response to Lexington's argument that valid service requires delivery of copies\r\n  of the summons and complaint to the Director of the Department of Insurance, the\r\n  trial court held that the parties were free to agree to another form of service\r\n  and that Lexington, through the inclusion of the service of suit clause in its\r\n  policy, waived its right to insist on service pursuant to section 15-9-270.Â  We\r\n  hold this ruling was based on an error of law.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to section 15-9-270, the service of pleadings in a lawsuit against an insurance\r\n  company &quot;must&quot; be accomplished by delivering two copies of the\r\n  pleadings to the Director of the South Carolina Department of Insurance.Â  See Equilease Corp. v. Weathers, 275 S.C. 478, 484, 272 S.E.2d 789, 792\r\n  (1980) (&quot;Clearly, in such a case where jurisdiction has not yet been\r\n  acquired over an insurance company, service under the applicable substituted\r\n  service statute is the proper and exclusive method of obtaining jurisdiction\r\n  over the insurance company.&quot;).Â  Whereas statutes prescribing methods of\r\n  service on other legal entities include a proviso that the prescribed manner of\r\n  service is not the only means or even the required means of service, section\r\n  15-9-270 does not allow service to be accomplished by other methods.[3]Â  The\r\n  absence in section 15-9-270 of a provision allowing alternate methods of\r\n  service on insurers is consistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of what\r\n  is now section 38-5-70.Â  See Murray v. Sovereign Camp, WOW, 192\r\n  S.C. 101, 108, 5 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1939) (holding that &quot;service on foreign\r\n  insurance companies as provided for in Section 7964 of the Code of 1932 [now\r\n  section 38-5-70] is exclusive, and that service made in any other way upon such\r\n  corporations is invalid&quot;). \r\nService\r\n  of the pleadings on the Director of the South Carolina Department of Insurance\r\n  &quot;is considered sufficient service upon the company.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 15-9-270 (2005). Â Upon receiving the pleadings, the Director &quot;shall\r\n  immediately forward by registered or certified mail one of the duplicate copies\r\n  prepaid directed toward the company at its home office . . . .&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  This is more than a ministerial task.Â  Rather, it is consistent with other\r\n  statutory responsibilities entrusted to the Director, including duties to (1)\r\n  &quot;see that all laws of this State governing insurers or relating to the\r\n  business of insurance are faithfully executed[,]&quot; (2) &quot;report to the\r\n  Attorney General or other appropriate law enforcement officials criminal\r\n  violations of the laws relative to the business of insurance or the provisions\r\n  of this title which he considers necessary to report[,]&quot; and (3) institute\r\n  civil actions when appropriate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-3-110 (2002).Â  In order to\r\n  perform such duties, the Director needs to be informed when an insurer's\r\n  misconduct is alleged to be sufficiently serious to warrant litigation.Â \r\n  Requiring the aggrieved party to serve the Director as a prerequisite to\r\n  acquiring jurisdiction over the insurer is a reasonable and efficient way to\r\n  achieve this objective.Â  Based on this reasoning, we hold that service on the\r\n  Department of Insurance of the pleadings in any lawsuit against an insurance\r\n  company is a right granted to the Department to enable it to fulfill the\r\n  responsibilities with which it has been charged.Â  The service of suit clause in\r\n  Lexington's policy was ineffective to waive a right that was not Lexington's to\r\n  waive.Â  The trial court therefore erred as a matter of law in holding that the\r\n  service of suit clause in Lexington's policy operated as a waiver of the right\r\n  to be served according to section 15-9-270.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold that the service of suit clause did not absolve White Oak of the\r\n  responsibility to comply with the requirement in section 15-9-270 that it\r\n  deliver two copies of its summons and complaint to the Director of the\r\n  Department of Insurance in order to serve process on Lexington.Â  We therefore\r\n  reverse the trial court's denial of Lexington's motion to set aside the entry\r\n  of default, vacate the judgment, and remand the matter to the trial court so\r\n  that Lexington can file an answer within thirty days once service of process has\r\n  been accomplished according to section 15-9-270. Â Because our determination of\r\n  this issue is dispositive of this appeal, we do not address Lexington's other\r\n  challenges to the validity of the service of process.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n    (1999) (ruling that because the determination of a particular issue was\r\n  dispositive of the appeal, the appellate court did not need to review the\r\n  remaining issues).Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In its motion to set aside the default, Lexington did\r\n  not expressly argue that because it filed an answer to the amended complaint\r\n  only twelve days after the filing of the amended complaint, it was never\r\n  actually in default.Â  Moreover, in both its motion to alter or amend and its\r\n  brief to this court, Lexington does not argue that it timely responded to the\r\n  filing and service of the amended complaint.Â  See Rule 15(a), SCRCP\r\n  (&quot;A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time\r\n  remaining for response to the original pleading or within fifteen days after\r\n  service of the named amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer,\r\n  unless the court otherwise orders.&quot;).\r\n[3]Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-210(d) (2005)\r\n  (regarding service of process on domestic corporations); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-9-240(c) (2005) (regarding service of process on foreign corporations\r\n  authorized to transact business in South Carolina); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-9-245(f) (2005) (regarding service of process on foreign corporations not\r\n  authorized to do business in South Carolina).\r\nService\r\n  of process on unauthorized insurers can be accomplished through service on &quot;the\r\n  Secretary of State or his successor in office,&quot; service on&quot;the Chief\r\n  Insurance Commissioner or some person in apparent charge of his office,&quot;\r\n  or service on &quot;any person within this State&quot; performing certain\r\n  activities on the unauthorized insurer's behalf.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  15-9-280(a), 15-9-285(b), and 15-9-290 (2005).Â  The statutes prescribing these\r\n  methods do not &quot;abridge[ ] the right to serve any process, notice, or\r\n  demand upon any insurer in any other manner permitted by law,&quot; but\r\n  litigants are not explicitly allowed to use alternative methods in lieu of the\r\n  means set forth in sections 15-9-280, 15-9-285, and 15-9-290.Â  S.C.

Ferrell Cothran, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4864\r\nHeard November 4, 2010 â€“ Filed August 10,\r\n  2011Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn Richard Moorman, of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\nDavid Cornwell Holler, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J.:Â  In this appeal from an automobile accident case, Beverly S.\r\n  claims the trial judge erred in not charging the jury on the loss of use of a\r\n  vehicle as an element of recoverable property damages when the vehicle is a\r\n  total loss.Â  We find Beverly has failed\r\n  to provide an adequate record for appellate review, and accordingly, we affirm.\r\nI.&nbsp; Facts and Procedural\r\n  History\r\nOn\r\n  August 9, 2006, Beverly's daughter, Mandy, drove Beverly's 1995 Nissan Altima\r\n  to school.Â  While Mandy was attempting to leave the school's parking lot after\r\n  class, Mandy was involved in two nearly simultaneous collisions: (1) she was\r\n  hit from behind by a car driven by Kayla R., and (2) Mandy hit the car in front\r\n  of her.Â  The Altima sustained significant damages to its front end and minor\r\n  damages to the rear end.Â  \r\nBeverly\r\n  filed suit against Kayla claiming Kayla was negligent in hitting Mandy from\r\n  behind, which in turn caused the Altima to hit the car in front.Â  Beverly\r\n  sought actual damages for Mandy's personal injuries and for property damage to\r\n  and loss of use of the Altima.&nbsp; She also sought&nbsp;punitive damages.Â  Before trial, the parties settled all claims except\r\n  those for property damage and loss of use.Â  \r\nBeverly's\r\n  counsel asked the trial judge to charge the jury that loss of use damages are recoverable as an element of property damages even if the vehicle was a total loss.Â  The\r\n  judge denied the request.Â  The jury returned a $120 verdict in favor of\r\n  Beverly.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Failure to Prepare an\r\n  Adequate Record on Appeal\r\n We do not reach the\r\n  issue Beverly attempts to raise on appeal because it is not adequately\r\n  presented for appellate review.Â  An appellate court will not consider an issue\r\n  that has not been preserved for appellate review.Â  Ulmer v. Ulmer, 369\r\n  S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006).Â  Issue preservation requires a party to preserve an issue both at trial\r\n  and in presentation of the issue on appeal.Â  S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. M\r\n    &amp; T Enters. of Mt. Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 659, 667 S.E.2d 7, 15\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008) (stating &quot;if\r\n  an issue is preserved at the trial court level, it must still be properly\r\n  raised and argued to the appellate court&quot;).\r\nBeverly\r\n  failed to present the issue on appeal in two important respects.Â  First, she failed\r\n  to include her request to charge in the Record on Appeal.Â  An appellate court cannot review a trial court's refusal\r\n  to give a requested charge where the appellant fails to include the requested\r\n  charge in the record.Â  Kline Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Superior Trucking Co.,\r\n  261 S.C. 542, 550, 201 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1973); see also Bonaparte v.\r\n    Floyd, 291 S.C. 427, 444, 354 S.E.2d 40, 50 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating the appellant\r\n  bears the burden of providing a record on appeal sufficient for intelligent\r\n  review); Rule 210(h), SCACR (&quot;[T]he appellate court will not consider any fact which\r\n  does not appear in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nSecond,\r\n  Beverly failed to present the issue on appeal by not including the entire jury\r\n  charge in the Record on Appeal.Â  An appellate court reviewing a jury charge for\r\n  error must review the charge as a whole.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v.\r\n    Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999); see\r\n      also Fairchild v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 344, 352, 683 S.E.2d\r\n  818, 822 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating an error in a jury charge must be shown to be\r\n  prejudicial to warrant reversal). Â Here, Beverly included in the Record only one page of the transcript of the charge.Â \r\n  That page does not even include the entire charge on damages.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBecause\r\n  Beverly failed to provide an adequate\r\n  record for appellate review, the jury verdict is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\nCURETON,\r\n  A.J., dissenting: Because I am firmly convinced Beverly properly\r\n  preserved the issue of the failure of the trial court to charge loss of use, I\r\n  am compelled to dissent.\r\n At trial, counsel\r\n  for Beverly inquired whether the trial court would &quot;charge the loss of use\r\n  provisions.&quot;Â  The court responded that it would charge Beverly could\r\n  recover loss of use only if the jury found her car was economically repairable.[1]Â \r\n  The court's actual charge follows: \r\n\r\nIf repairing the vehicle would put it in as good a\r\n  condition as before the accident, then the measure of damages would be the cost\r\n  of the repair plus any amount by which the value of the vehicle was decreased\r\n  due to its involvement in the collision.Â  This is also called depreciation.\r\nIf the vehicle cannot be repaired, the measure of\r\n  damages would be the value of the vehicle immediately before it was struck\r\n  minus any salvage value.\r\nA plaintiff may also be entitled to recover for the\r\n  loss of use of a vehicle during the time the plaintiff was unable to use it.\r\nActual damage for this purpose would be measured by\r\n  determining what if any it would cost the plaintiff to rent a similar vehicle\r\n  while the plaintiff's own vehicle was being repaired.\r\n\r\nAfter the court charged the\r\n  jury, Beverly renewed her objection to the charge, stating &quot;[t]he\r\n  plaintiff still maintains their objection to not being able to charge the jury\r\n  that total loss is recoverable.Â  Loss of use is recoverable in the event the\r\n  car is a total lossâ€”thank you.&quot;\r\n Quite candidly, in\r\n  her brief, Kayla does not take the position that the issue is not preserved for\r\n  our review.Â  Instead, Kayla concludes:Â  &quot;Although loss of use may be\r\n  recoverable when a vehicle is destroyed or not economically repairable,\r\n  [Beverly] offered no evidence that she was entitled to an exception to the\r\n  general rule.Â  The trial court properly denied [Beverly]'s request to submit loss\r\n  of use as an element of damages in this case.&quot;\r\n I believe the issue\r\n  of whether or not a plaintiff may recover loss of use of a totally destroyed or\r\n  non-repairable vehicle is a novel issue in this state and should be decided on\r\n  the merits.Â  Furthermore, Beverly argues she suffered prejudice from the deficient\r\n  charge, in that she might have received a substantially higher damages award if\r\n  the jury had considered loss of use.Â  See Hughes v. W. Carolina Reg'l\r\n    Sewer Auth., 386 S.C. 641, 646, 689 S.E.2d 638, 641 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n  (permitting reversal of a trial court's decision declining to give a particular\r\n  jury charge when the decision is both erroneous and prejudicial).Â  Inasmuch as\r\n  I believe Beverly was entitled to the requested charge, I would reverse and\r\n  remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While Beverly's written request to charge and the\r\n  court's entire charge are not included in the record on appeal, the record\r\n  contains four pages of the colloquy between the court and counsel concerning\r\n  whether to charge loss of use.Â  Moreover, the relevant portion of the court's\r\n  charge is included in the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4865","title":"Shatto v.

(Staff Care), a temporary medical service\r\n  staffing company located in Irving, Texas, entered into an agreement (the\r\n  Staffing Agreement) to provide temporary medical services for McLeod Physician\r\n  Associates.[2]Â \r\n  Pursuant to the Staffing Agreement, Staff Care acted as a placement agent for\r\n  McLeod and was required to use its best efforts in identifying temporary health\r\n  care professionals acceptable to McLeod.Â  In addition, the Staffing Agreement\r\n  required Staff Care to verify the health care providers' medical licenses,\r\n  arrange and complete travel and housing accommodations, provide malpractice\r\n  insurance, and pay health care providers on behalf of McLeod. \r\nShatto,\r\n  a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), contacted Staff Care after\r\n  finding a posting on the internet.Â  Shatto was unaware that Staff Care was\r\n  going to assign her to McLeod.Â  Shatto sent Staff Care her resume, copies of\r\n  her licenses and medical certifications, her health record, and references.Â  On\r\n  October 10, 2007, Shatto entered into a Provider Services Agreement (the\r\n  Provider Agreement), which specifically indicated Shatto was an independent\r\n  contractor with Staff Care.Â  The next day, Shatto signed an independent\r\n  contractor declaration form, stating Staff Care &quot;does not have the right\r\n  to direct or control the manner in which I practice my profession.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n  the independent contractor declaration form provided that Shatto was not an\r\n  employee of Staff Care; Shatto was responsible for paying local, state, and\r\n  federal taxes; and Shatto was not entitled to unemployment and workers'\r\n  compensation benefits from Staff Care.Â  On October 24, 2007, Staff Care sent\r\n  Shatto a confirmation letter regarding her assignment to provide temporary\r\n  medical services as a CRNA for McLeod from November 2007 to February 2008.Â  The\r\n  letter also indicated Staff Care agreed to pay an hourly rate of $95 and a $25\r\n  per diem.Â  Additionally, Shatto chose which shift she wanted to work while at\r\n  McLeod.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  the first day of her assignment, Shatto reported to Keith Torgerson, the chief\r\n  CRNA of McLeod, and received an orientation of the layout of the operating and supply\r\n  room.Â  During her assignment, Shatto underwent a McLeod employee drug screening\r\n  and employee health assessment, received an identification badge, and signed\r\n  several forms, including McLeod's health employee validation form, dress code,\r\n  parking, and corporate integrity program policies.Â  Shatto acknowledged she\r\n  received a copy of her job description and completed a temporary employee\r\n  emergency information sheet, a medical history form, and a mandatory\r\n  Occupational Safety and Health Administration Respirator Medical Evaluation\r\n  Form.Â  McLeod also furnished Shatto with scrub suits, disposable paper hats,\r\n  paper booties, anesthesia machines, monitoring equipment, blood pressure cuffs,\r\n  pulse oximeters, a stethoscope, drape clamps, laryngoscopes, and blades. Â \r\nOn\r\n  December 21, 2007, Shatto fell on the operating room floor while assisting in\r\n  the anesthetization of a patient.Â  She did not recall tripping over any items\r\n  but believed she tripped over either the bed cords or an I.V. pole.Â  Shatto\r\n  was treated in McLeod's emergency room and diagnosed with a contusion to the\r\n  right eye.Â  At the end of December 2007, Shatto's assignment with McLeod was\r\n  terminated.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  April 30, 2008, Shatto filed a Workers' Compensation Commission Form 50\r\n  (Employee's Notice of Claim and/or Request for Hearing) against McLeod and\r\n  Staff Care.Â  Shatto filed an amended Form 50 on June 2, 2008.Â  Shatto's\r\n  requests for a hearing against McLeod and Staff Care were consolidated, and a\r\n  hearing was held on August 21, 2008.Â  The Workers' Compensation Commissioner\r\n  (the Single Commissioner) concluded Shatto was entitled to workers'\r\n  compensation benefits as a result of her fall.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Single Commissioner found an employer-employee relationship existed between\r\n  McLeod and Shatto and further held (1) McLeod controlled the details of\r\n  Shatto's work; (2) McLeod furnished Shatto with equipment; (3) McLeod fired\r\n  Shatto; (4) McLeod was responsible for paying Shatto; and (5) Shatto sustained\r\n  an injury by accident while in the course of employment.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  Single Commissioner concluded Shatto was a &quot;borrowed servant&quot; under\r\n  the borrowed servant doctrine and found (1) a contract, even if it was implied,\r\n  existed between Shatto and McLeod; (2) Shatto was contracted to provide specific\r\n  health care services as a CRNA, and McLeod is a general hospital healthcare\r\n  provider with nurse anesthetists; and (3) McLeod controlled the details of\r\n  Shatto's work.Â  McLeod appealed the Single Commissioner's decision, and the\r\n  Appellate Panel affirmed the Single Commissioner.Â  This appeal followed.[3]\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  existence of an employment relationship\r\n  is a jurisdictional issue for purposes of workers'\r\n  compensation benefits and is reviewable under a preponderance of the evidence\r\n  standard.Â  Brayboy v. WorkForce, 383 S.C. 463, 466, 681 S.E.2d 567,\r\n  568&nbsp;(2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUnder\r\n  settled law, the determination of whether a claimant is an employee or\r\n  independent contractor focuses on the issue of control, specifically, whether\r\n  the purported employer had the right to control the claimant in the performance\r\n  of his or her work.Â  Wilkinson ex.\r\n    rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 382 S.C. 295, 299, 676 S.E.2d\r\n  700, 702 (2009).Â  In evaluating the right of control, the court examines four\r\n  factors that serve as a means of analyzing the work relationship as a whole:\r\n  (1) &quot;direct evidence of the right or exercise of control&quot;; (2)\r\n  &quot;furnishing of equipment&quot;; (3) &quot;method of payment&quot;; and (4)\r\n  &quot;right to fire.&quot;[4]Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP\r\nAt\r\n  the outset, McLeod contends Shatto's employment did not create an\r\n  employer-employee relationship because the only contract of employment in this\r\n  case was the Provider Agreement between Staff Care and Shatto.Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  McLeod's argument, we find the existence of an employer-employee relationship\r\n  is not conclusively based on the existence of a contract of employment.Â  See Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co.,&nbsp; 321 S.C. 19, 22, 467 S.E.2d 117, 119 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) (&quot;[An employment] contract may be oral or written, and also may be\r\n  implied from the conduct of the parties.Â  It is enough if the circumstances\r\n  show unequivocally that the parties recognize the relationship.&quot;).Â  Because the crucial\r\n  question is the right to control, we find the dispositive question is whether\r\n  the four-factor test from Wilkinson is satisfied.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Direct evidence of the right or exercise of control\r\nIn\r\n  deciding whether McLeod had the right to exercise direct control over Shatto,\r\n  the Appellate Panel found (1) Shatto did not have control over which patients\r\n  she would anesthetize or the order in which she would anesthetize patients because\r\n  she received her assignments from her supervisor; (2) Shatto was required to\r\n  report to Torgerson or the head CRNA on duty; (3) Torgerson had to sign\r\n  Shatto's time sheet before she submitted it to Staff Care; (4) Shatto had to\r\n  administer anesthesia and manage patients after surgery per McLeod's standards;\r\n  (5) Shatto provided instruction and education to McLeod's student nurse anesthetists;\r\n  (6) Shatto was required to attend at least 50% of departmental and information\r\n  meetings; (7) Shatto was required to begin work at 9:00 a.m.; and (8) Shatto\r\n  was required to sign a statement acknowledging that she understood her job\r\n  description at McLeod and would comply with McLeod's dress code, corporate\r\n  integrity program, confidentiality, parking, and name tag policies.Â  \r\nMcLeod\r\n  argues the right to control factor does not favor an employment relationship\r\n  with Shatto because its control over Shatto was mandated by law.Â  Shatto does\r\n  not dispute that McLeod was required by law to give Shatto a job description,\r\n  conduct a drug screening and orientation, and provide Shatto with an\r\n  identification badge.Â  Nevertheless, Shatto contends McLeod's control over\r\n  Shatto exceeded the amount required by law because Shatto provided instructions\r\n  to student nurse anesthetists, McLeod presented Shatto with a dress code, and\r\n  McLeod had to sign Shatto's time sheets.Â  We find Shatto's argument\r\n  unpersuasive based on our review of the preponderance of the evidence.\r\nWe\r\n  are aware that hospitals are subject to an array of legal and governmental regulations\r\n  to ensure proper medical standards for healthcare professionals providing optimal\r\n  patient care.Â  However, because McLeod's control over Shatto was, in\r\n  substantial part, derived by law, we find the right to control factor does not\r\n  favor an employer-employee relationship based on the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence in the record.Â  See Wilkinson,&nbsp;382 S.C. at 302, 676\r\n  S.E.2d at 703&nbsp;(noting that requiring a worker to comply with the law is\r\n  not evidence of control by the putative employer).\r\nFirst,\r\n  we find Shatto was required to comply with McLeod's anesthesia standards during\r\n  her assignment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-33-20(20) (2011)\r\n  (stating a CRNA shall practice pursuant to approved written guidelines within the\r\n  facility where practice privileges have been granted).Â  McLeod was also legally required to provide Shatto\r\n  with a job description and an identification badge.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 40-33-34(H)(2)(b)(ii) (2011) (stating a CRNA must be provided a copy of the\r\n  job description); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-3430 (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (stating all clinical staff, clinical trainees, medical students, interns, and\r\n  resident physicians of a hospital shall wear badges clearly stating their\r\n  names, their department, and their job or trainee title). \r\nMoreover,\r\n  McLeod was required to provide Shatto with an orientation and to ascertain Shatto's health history and health status, as\r\n  well as her educational and training background pursuant to the Minimum Standards for Licensing Hospitals and\r\n  Institutional General Infirmaries regulations under the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Regulations. See 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-16 Â§ 204(A)\r\n  (1976) (stating applications for employment at a hospital or institutional\r\n  general infirmaries shall contain age, education, training, experience, health,\r\n  and personal background of each employee); 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-16 Â§\r\n  204(B) (Supp. 2010) (stating all new employees and volunteers who have contact\r\n  with patients shall have a physical examination within one year prior to\r\n  employment including a tuberculin skin test no more than three months prior to\r\n  employment, unless a previously positive reaction can be documented); 24A S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 61-16 Â§ 204(C) (1976) (stating all new personnel shall be\r\n  oriented to acquaint them with the organization and environment of the facility,\r\n  their own specific duties and responsibilities, patients' needs, and the\r\n  emergency/disaster plans of the facility).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  even though Torgerson, McLeod's chief CRNA, signed Shatto's time sheets, Staff\r\n  Care required a McLeod representative's signature on the provider invoices for\r\n  payment and malpractice documentation.Â  Shatto testified she was told to take\r\n  the provider invoice to Torgerson.Â  Specifically, in a November 13, 2007 letter\r\n  to Shatto, Staff Care stated, &quot;[Staff Care] cannot present your Provider\r\n  Invoice for payment without [the Client Representative] signature.&quot;Â  Staff\r\n  Care's requirement that a McLeod representative sign a provider invoice does\r\n  not equate to the right of control.\r\n Additionally, we\r\n  note Shatto was treated differently from McLeod's CRNA employees.Â  In contrast\r\n  to CRNAs employed by McLeod, Shatto was never &quot;on call&quot; for work and\r\n  was only permitted to work in the operating room.Â  Torgerson testified McLeod\r\n  CRNAs are allowed to work in the main operating room, cardiac area, obstetrics department,\r\n  the emergency room, radiology suites, and the catheterization lab.Â  Due to\r\n  safety concerns and the complexity of different medical environments at McLeod,\r\n  Torgerson testified contract workers like Shatto were prohibited from working\r\n  in these areas.Â  Accordingly, we find McLeod did not have the right to control\r\n  Shatto.\r\n2. Furnishing of Equipment\r\nMcLeod\r\n  contends it was legally required to provide certain medical equipment to Shatto\r\n  and, as a result, McLeod asserts the furnishing of equipment factor does not\r\n  favor an employment relationship with Shatto.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel found McLeod furnished Shatto with anesthesia and monitoring\r\n  equipment, blood-pressure cuffs, pulse oximeters, thermometers, scrub suits,\r\n  disposable paper hats, and paper booties.Â  Further, the Appellate Panel stated: \r\n\r\nThere\r\n  is no indication in any of the exhibits, deposition, or hearing testimony that\r\n  [Shatto] was required to bring her own anesthetics, needles, syringes,\r\n  tourniquets, inhalation anesthetic masks, tubing, rubber gloves, or other\r\n  instruments required to perform her duties as a nurse anesthetist, as all of\r\n  these materials were supplied by McLeod.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring\r\n  the workers' compensation hearing, Shatto indicated she never owned an\r\n  anesthesia machine, and temporary CRNAs do not bring anesthesia equipment while\r\n  on assignment.Â  Shatto estimated McLeod's anesthesia equipment weighed\r\n  approximately five hundred pounds or more.Â  Shatto further testified she was\r\n  required to wear scrubs in the operating room and that Torgerson informed her\r\n  that she did not need to bring a stethoscope, clamps for the drape,\r\n  laryngoscopes, and blades because McLeod had &quot;plenty.&quot;Â  According to\r\n  Torgerson, a CRNA on assignment has never brought anesthesia equipment because\r\n  the law mandates McLeod is responsible for anesthesia equipment.Â  Torgerson also\r\n  indicated that individuals are required to wear scrubs prior to entry into the\r\n  operating room. \r\nWe\r\n  find McLeod's furnishing of equipment does not favor an employment relationship\r\n  with McLeod.Â  Pursuant to the Staffing Agreement, McLeod was required to supply\r\n  Shatto with customary equipment and supplies according to her specialty.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the regulations governing the minimum standards for hospitals require McLeod to\r\n  maintain anesthesia equipment in operable condition.Â  See 24A S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 61-16 Â§ 901 (1976) (&quot;An institutional structure, its components\r\n  parts, facilities, and all equipment, such as sterilizers, anesthesia machines\r\n  . . . shall be kept in good repair and operating condition.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  the fact McLeod provided Shatto with sterile clothing prior to entering the\r\n  operating room is in tandem with the regulatory scheme's emphasis on\r\n  maintaining a sterile environment in the operating room.Â  See 24A S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 61-16 Â§ 606.2 (1976) (&quot;The operating rooms shall be\r\n  separated from non-sterile areas and shall be located so as not to be used as a\r\n  passageway between, or subject to contamination from, other parts of the\r\n  hospital.&quot;).Â  Based on the foregoing, we find McLeod did not provide\r\n  Shatto's equipment for purposes of creating a employer-employee relationship.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; Method of Payment\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  McLeod contends the method of payment factor does not favor an employment\r\n  relationship with Shatto.Â  Particularly, McLeod argues Staff Care (1) directly\r\n  deposited Shatto's hourly wages; (2) provided Shatto with a per diem, a rental\r\n  car, and medical malpractice insurance; and (3) paid Shatto overtime wages.Â  McLeod\r\n  further argues it did not provide Shatto with any employee benefits such as\r\n  group health insurance, vacation and sick days, or a 401K retirement plan.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nDuring\r\n  the hearing, Shatto testified Staff Care deposited her hourly wages into her\r\n  account and provided a per diem, malpractice insurance coverage, a rental car,\r\n  and housing.Â  In regard to McLeod's employee benefits, Shatto acknowledged\r\n  McLeod did not provide her with group health insurance, vacation and sick days,\r\n  or a 401K retirement plan.Â  Torgersen testified McLeod employees receive\r\n  benefits, including vacation time, group health insurance, a 401K retirement\r\n  plan, continuing education, and medical malpractice insurance.Â  Further,\r\n  Torgerson indicated McLeod reimbursed Staff Care for Shatto's lodging during\r\n  her assignment, rental car expenses, medical malpractice insurance coverage,\r\n  and Shatto's hourly wages.Â  Ms. Diane Bryant of McLeod's payroll department\r\n  testified a search of McLeod's payroll records did not reveal any payment of\r\n  wages or earnings directly from McLeod to Shatto.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel found the method of payment factor favored an employment relationship\r\n  between McLeod and Shatto and specifically held:\r\n\r\nAlthough\r\n  McLeod did not directly pay [Shatto], McLeod was ultimately responsible for\r\n  payment of [Shatto's] salary and expenses per the terms of the [Staffing] Agreement\r\n  which states [McLeod] shall provide or directly reimburse [Shatto] through\r\n  [Staff Care] for cost of housing outside [McLeod's] facility, local\r\n  transportation, en route lodging, en route meals, and reasonable transportation\r\n  costs to and from [McLeod's] location.Â  \r\n\r\nDespite\r\n  Staff Care paying Shatto's hourly wages and expenses relating to her rental car\r\n  and lodging, McLeod issued several checks for &quot;contract labor&quot; to\r\n  Staff Care for payment of Shatto's wages, housing, and rental car expenses.Â  McLeod's\r\n  payment is consistent with the Staffing Agreement provision which states,\r\n  &quot;[McLeod] shall provide or directly reimburse [Shatto] through [Staff\r\n  Care] for cost of housing outside [McLeod's] facility, local transportation, en\r\n  route lodging, en route meals, and reasonable transportation costs to and from\r\n  [McLeod's] location.&quot;Â  Notwithstanding McLeod's payment to Staff Care for\r\n  Shatto's services, transportation, and housing expenses, the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence necessitates our finding that Shatto was not an employee of\r\n  McLeod.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, we find it particularly noteworthy Shatto did not\r\n  receive employee benefits.Â  Additionally, Staff Care provided Shatto with a\r\n  1099 form indicating her nonemployee compensation of $13,916 from Staff Care.Â  Shatto\r\n  filed a 2007 1040 Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship) Schedule C\r\n  form and listed her nonemployee compensation income of $13,916, $3,168 for car\r\n  and truck expenses, and $1,342 for supplies.Â  Shatto expended $94 for\r\n  continuing education courses, $595 for dues and subscriptions, $50 for a\r\n  registration fee, $130 for licenses and permits, $192 for uniforms, and traveled\r\n  6,532 business miles.Â  Consistent with Shatto's tax filings as a sole\r\n  proprietor, Shatto indicated she never thought of herself as an employee of Staff\r\n  Care but only as an &quot;independent locums looking for a job.&quot;Â  As noted\r\n  above, Shatto submitted a 1099 form, which lends support that she was not an\r\n  employee of McLeod.Â  See Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 303, 676 S.E.2d\r\n  at 704 (finding method of payment did not bear any indicia of an employment\r\n  relationship when claimant was furnished with 1099 tax forms and filed as a\r\n  sole proprietorship).Â  Based on the foregoing, we conclude the method of\r\n  payment factor does not favor an employment relationship.Â  \r\n4.&nbsp; Right to Fire\r\nPursuant\r\n  to Wilkinson, McLeod argues the right to fire factor tilts in favor of\r\n  finding Shatto was not an employee of McLeod because the agreement between\r\n  McLeod and Staff Care only granted McLeod a right to terminate.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  finding McLeod had the right to fire Shatto, the Appellate Panel stated the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\nMcLeod\r\n  had the right to fire [Shatto] if they did not find her services to be\r\n  appropriate.Â  According to the [Staffing Agreement], McLeod had 48 hours in\r\n  which to notify Staff Care of its intention to accept [Shatto's] services . . .\r\n  .Â  McLeod ultimately fired [Shatto] on December 28, 2007.[5]Â  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether McLeod had the right to fire, we find Wilkinson provides guidance on this issue.Â  Initially, our supreme court noted in Wilkinson that the right to fire factor was the most difficult to evaluate because the\r\n  parties did not confront this issue.Â  Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 304, 676\r\n  S.E.2d at 704.Â  Nonetheless, our supreme court recognized a right to terminate\r\n  in some form exists in an independent contractor arrangement.Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  in analyzing the right to fire factor, our supreme court stated, &quot;[t]he\r\n  critical inquiry is the term 'fire,' for it embraces the employment\r\n  relationship.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court then examined the contractural terms\r\n  between Wilkinson and Palmetto and concluded Palmetto did not have a right to\r\n  fire.Â  Id.Â  Specifically, the court noted either party could terminate\r\n  the contract upon thirty days' notice, and the contract stated, &quot;[i]n the\r\n  event either party commits a material breach of any term of this Agreement . .\r\n  . the other party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately\r\n  and hold the party committing the breach liable for damages.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Torgerson testified Shatto's assignment was terminated because\r\n  McLeod hired full-time employees, which obviated the need for temporary CRNAs.Â \r\n  Shatto admitted Torgerson informed her around the end of November or beginning\r\n  of December 2007 her services would no longer be needed after the holidays\r\n  because McLeod hired full-time CRNAs who were slated to start working in the\r\n  beginning of 2008.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  cancellation section of the Staffing Agreement and the Termination section of\r\n  the Provider Agreement governed the parties' right of termination.Â  Section C.2\r\n  of the cancellation section of the Staffing Agreement provided: \r\n\r\n[McLeod]\r\n  may terminate this AGREEMENT or the services of . . . [Shatto] at any time in\r\n  writing, subject to the limitations included below in Section D.6,[6] provided once\r\n  [McLeod] has accepted [Shatto] through verbal or written communication,\r\n  termination by [McLeod] shall not be effective until 30 days after written\r\n  notice of termination was received by [Staff Care], [McLeod] will be invoiced,\r\n  in accordance to the rates agreed upon in the ORDER, for all scheduled time\r\n  through the effective date of termination. Upon termination, [McLeod] also\r\n  remains obligated for any and all fees and expenses that are due and owing to\r\n  [Staff Care] under this AGREEMENT, as well as any other fees, expenses or other\r\n  charges in connection with services performed by [Shatto] through the effective\r\n  date of termination. \r\n\r\n(emphasis in original)\r\nSection\r\n  C.3 provided in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nIf, at\r\n  any time during the course of this AGREEMENT . . . [McLeod] does not reasonably\r\n  find the performance of [Shatto] to be appropriate; [McLeod] shall provide\r\n  written notice of such determination to [Staff Care] and [Staff Care] shall\r\n  attempt to replace [Shatto].Â  [McLeod] shall be solely responsible for\r\n  terminating [Shatto] due to [her] poor performance, including, but not limited\r\n  to intentional or unintentional dereliction of duties, gross negligence, or\r\n  loss of hospital privileges, as determined by [McLeod] in its sole discretion.Â \r\n  [McLeod] may request that [Staff Care] on [McLeod's] behalf deliver a notice of\r\n  termination to [Shatto], but under no circumstances shall [Staff Care] have the\r\n  unilateral right or authority to terminate [Shatto's] assignment.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).\r\nSection\r\n  3.02(a) of the termination section of the Provider Agreement, which Shatto\r\n  initialed and signed, provided in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nEither\r\n  party may terminate this Agreement and [Shatto] or [McLeod] may terminate an\r\n  assignment with or without cause by giving at least thirty (30) days prior\r\n  written notice; provided, however, Staff Care shall not have the right to\r\n  terminate an assignment for [McLeod] for which [Shatto] is performing\r\n  services.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 3.02(d) of the Provider Agreement stated: \r\n\r\n[McLeod],\r\n  at its sole discretion, will have the right to terminate the services of\r\n  [Shatto] for any assignment if [McLeod] does not reasonably find the services\r\n  of [Shatto] to be appropriate; provided, however [McLeod] will be liable to\r\n  [Shatto] for payment for services performed by [Shatto] prior to termination.Â \r\n  [Shatto] will not be entitled to payment for any scheduled services not\r\n  actually performed by [Shatto] as a result of the termination of an\r\n  assignment.Â  \r\n\r\nSimilar\r\n  to the employer in Wilkinson, we hold McLeod did not have a right to\r\n  fire and the parties' right of termination was controlled by the Staffing and\r\n  Provider Agreements, respectively.[7]Â \r\n  Therefore, we find the &quot;right to fire&quot; factor favors McLeod.\r\n Based on the\r\n  foregoing analysis, we find Shatto was not an employee of McLeod.Â  Because we\r\n  find Shatto was not an employee of McLeod, we need not address whether Shatto\r\n  was a borrowed servant because McLeod did not control Shatto's work.Â  Moreover, because we find\r\n  Shatto was not an employee of McLeod, we\r\n  need not address whether Shatto's fall was idiopathic in nature.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an\r\n  appellate court need not address remaining issues when a decision on a prior\r\n  issue is&nbsp;dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Based on the\r\n  foregoing, we reverse\r\n  the Appellate Panel's decision that Shatto was an employee of McLeod and remand\r\n  for further proceedings on the issue of whether Shatto was an employee of Staff\r\n  Care.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\n REVERSED and\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nGEATHERS and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] McLeod\r\n  Physician Associates is listed as the Client in the Staffing Agreement.Â  For\r\n  ease of reference, we refer to McLeod Physician Associates and McLeod Regional\r\n  Medical Center as McLeod throughout this opinion.Â  \r\n[3] Pursuant to a\r\n  statutory modification of section 42-17-60 of the South Carolina Code (2010),\r\n  injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2007, are appealed directly to this\r\n  court. \r\n[4] In analyzing\r\n  the right to control factors, the Appellate Panel's decision cited to Dawkins\r\n    v. Jordan, and noted that &quot;any single factor is not merely indicative\r\n  of, but, in practice, virtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in\r\n  the opposite direction, contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best only\r\n  mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no\r\n  such force at all.&quot;Â  341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703 (2000).Â  This\r\n  proposition was expressly overruled by our supreme court in Wilkinson.Â \r\n  The Wilkinson court stated, &quot;We overrule Dawkins' analytical\r\n  framework, for it most assuredly skews the analysis to a finding of\r\n  employment.Â  We return to our jurisprudence that evaluates the four factors\r\n  with equal force in both directions.&quot;Â  Wilkinson, 382 S.C at 300,\r\n  676 S.E.2d at 702 (footnote omitted).Â  Therefore, in determining whether Shatto\r\n  was an employee of McLeod, we apply the standard enunciated in Wilkinson.Â  \r\n[5] The Appellate\r\n  Panel finding is based on section B.4 of the Duties of Client section of the\r\n  Staffing Agreement, which provides that McLeod must notify Staff Care of its\r\n  intention to accept or not to accept Shatto's services within 48 hours after\r\n  her presentment to McLeod.Â  \r\n[6] Section D.6\r\n  provided, &quot;[McLeod] agrees that it will not seek to terminate [Shatto's]Â \r\n  placement, nor will it refuse [Shatto's] service, for a discriminatory reason,\r\n  including [Shatto's] race, sex, national origin, religion, age, disability,\r\n  marital status, veteran status, or any other protected classification.&quot;Â  \r\n[7] The record does not contain a written notice of\r\n  McLeod's termination of Shatto as prescribed by the Staffing Agreement and the\r\n  Provider Agreement.Â  In Wilkinson, the court concluded the contract's\r\n  language only granted the parties the right to terminate the contract.Â  382 S.C\r\n  at 304, 676 S.E.2d at 704.Â  Therefore, even though there is no written notice\r\n  in the record, the Staffing Agreement and Provider Agreement provided a right\r\n  of termination, rather than a right to fire.Â  Additionally, Shatto testified Torgerson\r\n  informed her around the end of November 2007 that McLeod hired four CRNAs who\r\n  were scheduled to begin employment in January 2008.Â  Shatto testified Torgerson\r\n  told her that he had to give her thirty days' notice before termination.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4866","title":"State v.

Â The trial court sentenced Lindsey to concurrent\r\n  sentences of thirty years' imprisonment for armed robbery and twenty years' imprisonment\r\n  for the ABWIK charge.Â  Lindsey appeals, arguing the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  (1) hearsay that improperly bolstered the officer's testimony and (2) Lindsey's\r\n  written statement into evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nLindsey proceeded to trial on charges\r\n  arising from the robbery of King's ABC Liquor Store (the liquor store).Â  Three\r\n  days after the robbery, Investigator John Zamberlin (Investigator Zamberlin) interviewed\r\n  Lindsey after receiving an anonymous tip.[2]Â \r\n  During the first interview, Lindsey was advised of his Miranda[3] rights, signed a voluntary waiver of his rights, and provided an oral statement\r\n  denying any knowledge of the crime.Â  At the conclusion of the first interview,\r\n  Lindsey provided Investigator Zamberlin a signed authorization allowing the\r\n  police to collect blood, hair, and saliva samples for analysis (the DNA swab).\r\nSeveral hours later, Lindsey requested\r\n  to speak with Investigator Zamberlin.Â  During the second interview,[4] Lindsey asked Investigator Zamberlin if the liquor store clerk identified him\r\n  as the perpetrator.Â  Investigator Zamberlin informed Lindsey the South Carolina\r\n  Law Enforcement Divison (SLED) was conducting a forensic evaluation on a pair\r\n  of Lindsey's tennis shoes the police believed were worn during the commission\r\n  of the robbery.Â  At this point, Lindsey informed Investigator Zamberlin and\r\n  Lieutenant David Creamer (Lieutenant Creamer) that he &quot;just snapped&quot;\r\n  while in the liquor store and committed the crime.Â  During this interview, Lindsey\r\n  consented to provide a written statement but requested Investigator Zamberlin\r\n  write the statement as he detailed the robbery.Â  As a matter of course,\r\n  Lieutenant Creamer contemporaneously took handwritten notes (Creamer's notes)\r\n  while Investigator Zamberlin questioned Lindsey and typed Lindsey's statement.\r\nAccording to the written statement, Lindsey\r\n  went into the liquor store to purchase a bottle of gin and saw the store clerk\r\n  counting some money.Â  The store clerk asked Lindsey for payment.Â  At this\r\n  point, Lindsey &quot;just snapped&quot; and hit the store clerk with a sock\r\n  that contained a rock in it.Â  Lindsey smashed the cash register against the\r\n  floor and collected $120 and ran out of the liquor store.Â  Lindsey purchased\r\n  some new tennis shoes and pants with the money.Â  In addition, Lindsey washed\r\n  his Adidas tennis shoes and discarded a pair of pants because they had blood on\r\n  them from the robbery. \r\n\r\nCreamer's notes recounted the following: \r\n  \r\n[I] [a]dvised Lindsey that his rights\r\n  were still in effect. Lindsey wanted to know if the man had identified him.\r\n  Lindsey was told that his shoes had been recovered and would be checked for\r\n  blood. Lindsey said he did it, that he robbed the man at the liquor store.Â \r\n  Lindsey went to the liquor store to buy some gin.Â  The man [was] behind the\r\n  counter counting money.Â  He asked the man for a bottle of gin.Â  The man set the\r\n  bottle on the counter and asked him for five dollars and something. He just\r\n  snapped and hit the man with a rock that was inside a sock.Â  He smashed the\r\n  cash register out on the floor.Â  He got about a hundred and twenty dollars from\r\n  the cash register.Â  He ran out of the store.Â  He dropped some money in the\r\n  parking lot.Â  He bent down and picked up the money.Â  He ran down West Reed\r\n  Street and went to a house, but no one was at home.Â  Spent all the money.Â \r\n  Spent some of it on some clothes.Â  The man in the liquor store did nothing to\r\n  make him hit him.Â  He just snapped. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe State moved to introduce Creamer's\r\n  notes detailing the second interview and Lindsey's written statement obtained\r\n  by Zamberlin into evidence. Â Lindsey objected to Creamer's notes, arguing they\r\n  were inadmissible hearsay. Â In addition, Lindsey objected to the written\r\n  statement and denied he ever made the statement.[5]Â \r\n  The trial court allowed both Creamer's notes and the written statement into\r\n  evidence over Lindsey's objections.Â  A jury found Lindsey guilty of armed\r\n  robbery and ABWIK. Â The trial court sentenced Lindsey to concurrent sentences\r\n  of thirty years' imprisonment for armed robbery and twenty years' imprisonment\r\n  for the ABWIK charge.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, this court reviews errors of law only and is bound by the trial\r\n  court's factual findings unless the findings are clearly erroneous. Â State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  &quot;On appeal,\r\n  the trial [court's] ruling as to the voluntariness of the confession will not\r\n  be disturbed unless so erroneous as to constitute an abuse of discretion.&quot; Â State\r\n    v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 47, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004). Â Likewise, rulings\r\n  on the admission of evidence are within the trial court's discretion and will\r\n  not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Stokes, 381\r\n  S.C. 390, 398, 673 S.E.2d 434, 438 (2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Lieutenant Creamer's Notes\r\nI.&nbsp; Hearsay\r\nLindsey argues the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  Creamer's notes regarding Lindsey's second interview and subsequent written\r\n  statement because the notes were inadmissible hearsay that improperly bolstered\r\n  Lieutenant Creamer's testimony.Â  In response, the\r\n  State contends the testimony was admissible under Rule 803(5), SCRE,[6] because the rules of evidence allow a\r\n  hearsay exception for a witness's memorandum about a matter which he once had\r\n  knowledge.Â  We agree with Lindsey but find this error to be harmless.\r\nHearsay\r\n  is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\r\n  Â See Rule 801(c), SCRE; State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, 451\r\n  S.E.2d 888, 894 (1994). Â The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of\r\n  evidence of an out of court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted\r\n  unless an exception to the rule applies. Â See Rule 802, SCRE; State\r\n    v. Lewis, 293 S.C. 107, 110, 359 S.E.2d 66, 67 (1987).\r\n Here, Lieutenant Creamer testified\r\n  he took notes contemporaneously while Investigator Zamberlin typed Lindsey's\r\n  written statement, but the notes were never utilized to refresh his memory.Â  Lieutenant\r\n  Creamer recalled the details of the second interview with ease, had no trouble\r\n  remembering the event, and testified to what he observed during the interview.Â \r\n  Lieutenant Creamer gave direct testimony about Lindsey's second interview, and\r\n  the State never established the proper foundation to admit the exhibit under\r\n  the exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Accordingly, the trial court violated Rule\r\n  803(5), SCRE, by allowing Creamer's notes to be read into evidence and received\r\n  as an exhibit to prove he robbed the liquor store.Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the testimony was improperly admitted, Lindsey has not demonstrated reversible\r\n  error. Â See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150,\r\n  151 (1985) (holding improper admission of hearsay evidence is reversible error\r\n  only when the admission causes prejudice); State v. Carmack, 388 S.C.\r\n  190, 202, 694 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. App. 2010) (&quot;An error without prejudice\r\n  does not warrant reversal.&quot;). Â Generally, a conviction will not be set aside\r\n  by the appellate court when error by the trial court is insubstantial and does\r\n  not affect the result of the trial. Â State v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 499,\r\n  629 S.E.2d 363, 366 (2006). Â Accordingly, when guilt has been conclusively\r\n  proven by competent evidence, an insubstantial error not affecting the result\r\n  of the trial is harmless. Â Id.\r\nA\r\n  review of the record reveals Creamer's notes regarding the details of the\r\n  second interview were merely cumulative to Investigator Zamberlin's testimony,\r\n  Lindsey's written statement, and Lieutenant Creamer's own testimony. Â See Price, 368 at 499-500, 629 S.E.2d at 366; see also State v.\r\n    Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196-97, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448-49 (2003) (finding an admission\r\n  of improper evidence is harmless when the evidence is merely cumulative to\r\n  other evidence); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859,\r\n  862 (1993) (finding any error in the admission of testimony that is merely\r\n  cumulative is harmless).Â  But see State v. Whisonant, 335 S.C.\r\n  148, 156, 515 S.E.2d 768, 772 (Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;Improper corroboration\r\n  testimony that is merely cumulative to the victim's testimony, . . .\r\n  cannot be harmless, because it is precisely this cumulative effect which\r\n  enhances the devastating impact of improper corroboration.&quot; (emphasis in\r\n  original)).[7]Â \r\n  The State's first witness, Investigator Zamberlin, testified Lindsey confessed\r\n  to the armed robbery and subsequently provided a written statement.Â  In\r\n  addition, Lindsey's written statement providing specific details about the\r\n  armed robbery and the weapon used to assault the liquor store clerk is virtually\r\n  identical to Creamer's notes taken contemporaneously with Lindsey's admission.Â \r\n  Moreover, Lieutenant Creamer's own testimony recounting the details of the second\r\n  interview and stating he witnessed Lindsey sign the written statement is\r\n  sufficient notwithstanding his notes being admitted into evidence.Â  Despite the\r\n  improper admission of Creamer's notes, the verdict was based on an abundance of\r\n  competent evidence from which Lindsey's guilt was properly established.Â  See State v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 171-72, 682 S.E.2d 19, 33 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) (holding any error in admitting eye witness testimony was harmless\r\n  because it was cumulative to other overwhelming evidence that established\r\n  defendant's guilt); State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d\r\n  334, 337 (1978) (finding the admission of improper evidence is harmless when\r\n  the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence).Â  Therefore, we find\r\n  Lieutenant Creamer's notes were cumulative and insubstantial and did not affect\r\n  the result of the trial.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error on this\r\n  issue.\r\nII.&nbsp; Presentation of Statement\r\n  to Jury\r\nIn addition to contending Creamer's notes were inadmissible\r\n  hearsay, Lindsey argues it was error for the trial court to allow Creamer's notes\r\n  to be admitted into evidence as an exhibit upon the State's motion and given to\r\n  the jury during its deliberations based upon the plain language of Rule 803(5),\r\n  SCRE.[8]  Â We find this argument is not preserved for our review. Â Â \r\nAfter the charge to the jury and closing arguments, the following\r\n  exchange occurred:\r\n\r\nThe Court: All right. Are the exhibits in order? Both sides agree?\r\n  What says the State? \r\nMs. Huey: Yes, sir, Your Honor.\r\nThe Court: And Defense?\r\nMr. Robinson: Yes sir, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nAs evidenced by this colloquy, Lindsey did not object to the\r\n  admission of Creamer's notes as an exhibit.Â  Therefore, this issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See State\r\n    v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (holding\r\n  a contemporaneous objection is required at trial to preserve an issue for\r\n  appellate review); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869,\r\n  873 (1994) (stating an issue which is not properly preserved cannot be raised\r\n  for the first time on appeal).\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lindsey's Written Statement\r\nI.&nbsp; Substantial\r\n  Evidence\r\nLindsey contends the trial court erred in admitting his written\r\n  statement because the State failed to prove Lindsey made the statement.Â  We find\r\n  this argument abandoned on appeal.\r\nAn issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal\r\n  if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.Â  State\r\n    v. Howard, 384 S.C. 212, 217, 682 S.E.2d 42, 45 (Ct. App. 2009); see\r\n      also State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 58-59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (stating\r\n  an argument is deemed abandoned on appeal when conclusory and without\r\n  supporting authority). \r\nLindsey's issue statement contends he never made the written\r\n  statement.Â  The body of his brief is a mere recitation of the facts presented\r\n  at trial, without legal argument.Â  Lindsey provides no legal authority\r\n  regarding the State's failure to prove he made the statement.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find Lindsey's argument is abandoned and decline to address the merits of this\r\n  issue. \r\nII.&nbsp; Handwriting\r\n  Analysis\r\n Additionally,\r\n  Lindsey argues the trial court erred in basing its ruling to admit the written\r\n  statement into evidence, at least in part, on its own comparison of Lindsey's handwriting\r\n  exemplars. Â We find this issue is not preserved for our review.Â Â  Â \r\n A contemporaneous objection is typically required to\r\n  preserve issues for appellate review.Â  State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53,\r\n  58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (citing Johnson, 324 S.C. at 41, 476\r\n  S.E.2d at 682) (noting a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an\r\n  issue for appellate review).Â  Here, Lindsey not only failed to object when the\r\n  trial court questioned if there were any previous exemplars of Lindsey's\r\n  signature, but affirmatively placed two sentencing sheets into evidence that\r\n  contained his signature.Â  Moreover, Lindsey failed to object to the trial\r\n  court's handwriting analysis during the Jackson v. Denno[9] hearing.Â  Because this argument was never presented to the trial court, it is\r\n  not preserved for our review. Â See State v. Russell, 345 S.C.\r\n  128, 134, 546 S.E.2d 202, 205 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding evidentiary argument was\r\n  not preserved for review because the issue was never raised to or ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Inadmissible Hearsay\r\n Lindsey also argues\r\n  the trial court's ruling to admit Lindsey's written statement explicitly relied\r\n  on inadmissible hearsay.Â  Although Lindsey identified the inadmissible hearsay\r\n  in his statement of issues on appeal, he failed to address it in his brief, precluding\r\n  consideration on appeal.Â  See Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 21,\r\n  640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[4] Investigator Zamberlin testified Lindsey was advised\r\n  that his Miranda rights were still in effect from the interview held\r\n  earlier in the morning.Â  \r\n[5] Lindsey's written statement reflects that Lindsey\r\n  initialed the statement three times and signed the statement once.Â  In\r\n  addition, Investigator Zamberlin and Lieutenant Creamer were present and signed\r\n  the statement as witnesses. \r\n[6] Â Rule\r\n  803(5), SCRE, states: \r\n\r\nA memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness\r\n  once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness\r\n  to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the\r\n  witness when the matter was fresh in the witness' memory and to reflect that\r\n  knowledge correctly.

Hill (Hill) appeals his convictions for two counts of armed\r\n  robbery, two counts of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and one count of\r\n  resisting arrest.[2]Â \r\n  After review, this court ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying Hill's motion for a new trial after the jury\r\n  mistakenly received two statements made by Hill during deliberations that were\r\n  not admitted into evidence during trial.Â  We find the circuit court erred and\r\n  accordingly reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n On\r\n  the evening of January 31, 2002, and the early morning hours of February 1,\r\n  2002, the La Quinta Inn and the Hampton Inn (the motels) were both robbed in\r\n  Greenville County.Â  Hill and his co-conspirators, Damian Taylor (Taylor) and Melvin\r\n  Warren (Warren), were arrested after fleeing from police pursuit.Â  A grand jury\r\n  indicted Hill for two counts of armed robbery, two counts of conspiracy to\r\n  commit armed robbery, and one count of resisting arrest.Â  Taylor and Warren pled guilty and agreed to\r\n  testify against Hill in exchange for a deal on pending charges. Â \r\nHill\r\n  proceeded to trial from February 3-5, 2003.Â  At a pre-trial Jackson v. Denno[3] hearing, the State admitted two written statements made by Hill to the\r\n  Simpsonville Police Department and the Greenville County Sheriff's Office.Â  In\r\n  his statements, Hill admitted to being a passenger in a Ford Escort (the\r\n  vehicle) that was used to commit the armed robberies.Â  Hill explained he lived\r\n  in the same neighborhood as Taylor and Warren and knew they had a reputation\r\n  for committing robberies.Â  Hill also indicated Taylor and Warren wanted him to\r\n  ride with them and to &quot;work with them.&quot;Â  Hill stated he remained in\r\n  the vehicle while Taylor and Warren went inside the motels.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court held Hill's written statements were voluntarily given at the Jackson\r\n    v. Denno hearing.Â  However, the State did not offer Hill's statements into\r\n  evidence at trial.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State presented several witnesses during its case-in-chief. Marvin Somarriba, an employee of\r\n  the La Quinta Inn, testified he heard a &quot;noise at the door&quot; and\r\n  &quot;two guys running&quot; on the evening of January 31, 2002.Â  Somarriba\r\n  testified that one of the robbers placed a gun against his head and took $30\r\n  and credit cards from his wallet, and that the other robber took approximately\r\n  $120 from the cash drawer.Â  Furthermore, Somarriba stated the robbers wore dark\r\n  clothing and dark ski masks.Â  \r\nRangar\r\n  Borei, an employee of the Hampton Inn, testified two men wearing dark ski masks\r\n  and dark clothing entered the Hampton Inn during the early morning hours of\r\n  February 1, 2002.Â  Borei stated one of the robbers placed a gun against his\r\n  nose.Â  The\r\n  robbers took approximately $178 from the cash drawer as well as Borei's wallet,\r\n  which contained $15, credit cards, and Borei's driver's license and Social\r\n  Security card. \r\nOfficer\r\n  William Kennedy of the Mauldin Police Department was on patrol when he heard a\r\n  robbery had occurred over the Simpsonville Police Department's scanner.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Officer Kennedy observed the vehicle speeding with its bright headlights on,\r\n  prompting him to activate his blue lights and follow the vehicle to a Bi-Lo\r\n  parking lot.Â  Officer Kennedy stated the vehicle did not completely stop, the\r\n  occupants in the vehicle were &quot;rummaging around,&quot; and the occupant in\r\n  the rear seat of the vehicle appeared to be wearing a red shirt.Â  Shortly after\r\n  the vehicle entered the parking lot, Officer Kennedy stated the vehicle\r\n  accelerated &quot;very fast&quot; and made a left turn onto West Butler Road.Â  At\r\n  this point, Officer Kennedy pursued the vehicle.Â  During the pursuit, the\r\n  vehicle &quot;slid off&quot; into a dirt area, and the three occupants exited\r\n  the vehicle and ran into the woods.Â  Officer Kennedy identified Taylor as the\r\n  driver of the vehicle and Warren as the front passenger and further indicated\r\n  that Taylor and Warren were wearing dark clothing. Â \r\nOfficer\r\n  Brian Lewis of the Mauldin Police Department assisted Officer Kennedy in the\r\n  police chase.Â  He testified that Taylor, the driver of the vehicle, and the\r\n  vehicle's front passenger were wearing dark clothing; whereas, the passenger in\r\n  the rear seat was wearing a red shirt.Â  However, Officer Lewis testified Taylor\r\n  was wearing black baggy pants and no shirt when he was captured.Â  Officer\r\n  Harold Harris of the Greenville County Sherriff's Office arrested Warren and\r\n  testified that Warren had a black ski mask, Borei's wallet, driver's license,\r\n  and credit cards in his pockets. Â \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Officer Robert Smith of the Greenville County Sheriff's Office\r\n  testified his canine tracked Hill to a creek bed.Â  In the process of tracking\r\n  Hill, Officer Smith discovered a white t-shirt that appeared to be covered in\r\n  blood, a black tennis shoe, and a New York Yankees hat.Â  Smith noted Hill was\r\n  wearing a red t-shirt while hiding in the creek bed and that &quot;a wad of\r\n  unfolded loose cash&quot; was retrieved after Hill was searched.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Officer Smith indicated that Hill did not have a black ski\r\n  mask in his possession after he was arrested.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Ralph Bobo of the Simpsonville Police Department testified he took photographs\r\n  of the contents inside the vehicle, which included a black coat and a white shirt\r\n  located in the rear seat.Â  Officer Bobo also stated that he took photographs of\r\n  the ski mask and Borei's wallet that were found on Warren after his arrest.Â  Officer\r\n  Bobby Alexander of the Greenville County Sheriff's Office conducted an inventory\r\n  search of the vehicle.Â  Officer Alexander noted that a black hooded leather\r\n  coat, a gray fleece sweatshirt, a football jersey, and a dark colored ski mask\r\n  were located in the back seat of the vehicle.Â  \r\nCo-conspirators\r\n  Taylor and Warren testified on behalf of the State.Â  Taylor stated that he\r\n  drove the vehicle and that Hill and Warren agreed to ride to a drug area with\r\n  the intention of robbing a drug dealer; however, they were unsuccessful.Â  At\r\n  this point, Taylor stated they changed their plans and agreed to go to the La\r\n  Quinta Inn with the intent of robbing the motel.[4]Â  Taylor testified he\r\n  remained in the vehicle while Hill and Warren robbed the motels.Â  During\r\n  cross-examination, Hill questioned Taylor regarding his written police\r\n  statement in which Taylor indicated that Hill was unaware of the armed robbery\r\n  plan and thought they were just riding around.Â  Taylor clarified his statement\r\n  and claimed he told Hill about the robbery plans after Hill entered the\r\n  vehicle.Â  According to Warren, Hill agreed to participate in the robbing of the\r\n  motels.Â  Warren stated Hill accompanied him inside both of the motels and\r\n  participated in the robberies while Taylor remained in the vehicle.Â  Warren\r\n  also testified he took off his black coat while in the woods and that Hill wore\r\n  the black coat that was located in the rear seat of the vehicle.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Warren admitted he lied in his police statement when he told\r\n  the police that he remained in the vehicle while Taylor and Hill robbed the\r\n  motels.Â  Both Taylor and Warren testified Hill wore a black ski mask and\r\n  gloves.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the State's case-in-chief, Hill testified in his own defense.Â  Hill stated he\r\n  agreed to ride with Taylor and Warren on the belief that they were going to a\r\n  party and to meet some girls.Â  According to Hill, Taylor parked the car by the\r\n  La Quinta Inn.Â  Hill stated Taylor and Warren subsequently entered the La\r\n  Quinta Inn.Â  Soon thereafter, Taylor and Warren returned to the vehicle, and\r\n  Warren came back with a credit card.Â Â  After leaving the La Quinta Inn, Hill\r\n  testified they went to a mall, and Warren unsuccessfully attempted to purchase\r\n  clothing and jewelry with the credit card stolen from the La Quinta Inn.Â  After\r\n  leaving the mall, Warren drove to a gas station and purchased gas and beer.Â  Upon\r\n  leaving the gas station, Hill claimed Taylor parked near a wooden fence and\r\n  informed him that he and Warren &quot;would be back.&quot;Â  Again, Hill\r\n  asserted he remained in the vehicle and Taylor and Warren returned approximately\r\n  four to five minutes later.Â  Hill also claimed he did not observe Taylor and\r\n  Warren with any ski masks or weapons upon exiting the vehicle.Â  During his\r\n  testimony, Hill averred he did not agree to commit nor have any knowledge of\r\n  the robbery plans.Â  Hill stated Taylor and Warren threw clothes in the rear seat and he remembered seeing a black coat in the vehicle\r\n  that belonged to Warren; however, Hill denied observing any ski masks in the\r\n  rear seat.Â  Hill also indicated that Taylor and Warren did not tell him about\r\n  the robberies, and he was only aware that the police were pursuing the\r\n  vehicle.Â  However, Hill acknowledged on cross-examination that he was aware\r\n  Taylor and Warren had committed robberies in the past, but repeatedly denied\r\n  having knowledge about their plans to rob the motels.Â  \r\n The\r\n  jury found Hill guilty of two counts of armed robbery, two counts of conspiracy\r\n  to commit armed robbery, and one count of resisting arrest.Â  The circuit court\r\n  sentenced Hill to concurrent sentences of thirty years, five years, and five\r\n  years, respectively. \r\nAfter\r\n  the jury was dismissed and Hill was sentenced, the circuit court judge went\r\n  into the jury room to speak with the jurors.Â  According to the circuit court\r\n  judge, the foreman informed him that Hill's written statements were submitted\r\n  to the jury during deliberations, and the jury considered these statements as important\r\n  evidence.Â  The circuit court judge questioned the bailiff and was shown the\r\n  exhibits, which included Hill's two written statements.Â  Soon thereafter, the circuit court\r\n  informed the parties about the error, and Hill moved for a new trial.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 20, 2003, the circuit court conducted a hearing on Hill's motion for a\r\n  new trial and took the matter under advisement.Â  On June 11, 2003, the circuit\r\n  court conducted a second hearing on Hill's motion for a new trial.Â  In explaining\r\n  the inadvertent submission of Hill's statements, the circuit court judge stated,\r\n  &quot;Apparently what happened is the State's Exhibits that I just referred to\r\n  got mixed in with the evidence that had been admitted and was submitted back\r\n  into the jury room not the first day when they deliberated but on the second\r\n  morning.&quot;Â  The\r\n  circuit court judge orally denied Hill's motion for a new trial during the second\r\n  hearing and applied a harmless error analysis to consider if the admission of\r\n  Hill's statements contributed to the guilty verdict.Â  The circuit court\r\n  concluded the admission of Hill's written statements was harmless because\r\n  &quot;[Hill's] [in-court] testimony essentially tracks what's in the\r\n  statement.Â  There's really not [anything] significant in the statement that wasn't\r\n  in his testimony.&quot;Â  Additionally, the circuit court concluded that it\r\n  would have admitted Hill's statements into evidence if the State sought to introduce\r\n  this evidence at trial.Â  The circuit court filed a written order denying Hill's\r\n  motion for new trial on February 9, 2007.[5]\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 246, 669\r\n  S.E.2d 598, 605-06 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  This court is bound by the circuit\r\n  court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  This court does not reevaluate\r\n  the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the circuit court's ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 473-74, 649 S.E.2d 84, 86 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nLAW/ANAYLSIS\r\nHill\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because\r\n  the jury considered his written statements during deliberations.Â  Hill alleges\r\n  the submission of his written statements was prejudicial and improperly\r\n  influenced the jury because (1) all twelve jurors were exposed to his\r\n  statements; (2) no curative instructions were given because the error was only\r\n  discovered after the jury verdict; (3) the weight of the evidence against Hill was\r\n  not overwhelming; and (4) Hill did not confess to the crime at trial.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\n It\r\n  is well settled that the grant or refusal of a new trial is within the sound\r\n  discretion of the circuit court.Â  State v. Taylor, 348 S.C. 152, 159,\r\n  558 S.E.2d 917, 920&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  Where there is no evidence to\r\n  support a conviction, an order granting a new trial should be upheld.Â  State\r\n    v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993).Â  However, where\r\n  there is competent evidence to sustain the jury's verdict, the circuit court\r\n  may not substitute its judgment for that of the jury.Â  State v. Prince,\r\n  316 S.C. 57, 63, 447 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1993) \r\nThe\r\n  Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution guarantee a\r\n  defendant a fair trial by a panel of impartial and indifferent jurors.Â  State\r\n    v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 141, 502 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1998).Â  In a criminal\r\n  prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be free from all extraneous or\r\n  improper influences.Â  Unless the misconduct affects the jury's impartiality, it\r\n  is not such misconduct as will affect the verdict.Â  Id.Â  Relevant\r\n  factors a court should consider in determining whether outside influences have\r\n  affected the jury are the number of jurors exposed, the weight of the evidence\r\n  properly before the jury, and the likelihood that curative measures were\r\n  effective in reducing the prejudice.Â  Id. at 141-42, 502 S.E.2d at 104.Â  \r\nIn State v. Rogers, 96 S.C. 350, 80 S.E. 620 (1914), our supreme court\r\n  confronted a similar factual situation concerning the discovery of the jury's\r\n  receipt of incompetent evidence after the jury rendered its verdict and was\r\n  dismissed from service.Â  Rogers was convicted for willful and malicious injury\r\n  to the cars and engine of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company and\r\n  endangering the lives of the train's passengers and crew.Â  Rogers, 96\r\n  S.C. at 351, 80 S.E. at 620.Â  During trial, the State offered an affidavit\r\n  signed by Rogers' wife.Â  Id.Â  Rogers objected to the affidavit, and the\r\n  trial court sustained the objection finding the affidavit inadmissible.Â  Id. at 351-52, 80 S.E. at 620.Â  After all the evidence was presented and the case\r\n  went to the jury, the trial court inadvertently submitted the affidavit to the\r\n  jury when he handed the indictment to the foreman.Â  Id. at 352, 80 S.E.\r\n  at 620.\r\nRogers\r\n  was convicted and sentenced by the circuit court.Â  Rogers, 96 S.C. at\r\n  352, 80 S.E. at 620. Â After the trial court adjourned, the State and Rogers\r\n  discovered that the inadmissible affidavit was inadvertently submitted to the\r\n  jury.Â  Id.Â  Rogers appealed his conviction.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, our\r\n  supreme court reversed and granted Rogers a new trial.Â  Id. at 353, 80\r\n  S.E. at 621.Â  In regard to the specific issue relating to the submission of the\r\n  inadmissible affidavit to the jury during its deliberations, our supreme court\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\nThe affidavit got to the jury after his honor had\r\n  ruled it incompetent, without any explanation on the part of the court that it\r\n  was incompetent, and to be disregarded, not denied by the father, who was\r\n  alleged to have attempted to improperly influence Hattie Rogers' testimony, and\r\n  unexplained by him or the defendant, and we cannot say that, taken with all of\r\n  the evidence in the case, it was not prejudicial to the defendant; but, on the\r\n  contrary, the jury might have arrived at the conclusion that they did by the\r\n  incompetent testimony, and we have no doubt, if it had been discovered before\r\n  his honor adjourned the court what had transpired, but that he would have set\r\n  the verdict aside, and granted a new trial. \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nIn addition to Rogers,\r\n  we note the Washington Supreme Court's opinion in State v. Pete, 98 P.3d\r\n  803 (Wash. 2004), also provides guidance on the issue presented in this case.Â \r\n  Although not controlling, the Washington Supreme Court addressed the issue of\r\n  whether a jury's exposure to extrinsic evidence during deliberations warranted\r\n  a new trial where a police report contradicted the defendant's written\r\n  statement to the police.Â Â  \r\nIn Pete,\r\n  two Seattle police officers responded to an alleged assault and observed what\r\n  appeared to be the defendant attempting to take a case of beer from the\r\n  victim's hand.Â  Id. at 804.Â  After the police officers parked their car,\r\n  they observed the defendant taking the beer from the victim.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  defendant was subsequently arrested, and the police found two beers in the\r\n  defendant's pocket and a case of beer close to where the defendant was\r\n  standing.Â  Id.Â  While in transport to the police station, the defendant\r\n  told an officer that &quot;he only took some beer&quot; from the victim and\r\n  that the co-defendant assaulted the victim.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 805.Â \r\n  After arriving at the police station, the defendant signed a written statement\r\n  that indicated the victim offered him a beer as the co-defendant arrived.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The defendant further explained the victim &quot;handed&quot; him the rest of\r\n  the beer and instructed him to walk away.Â  Id. at 805.Â  At this point,\r\n  the defendant indicated he walked away from the victim and did not look back to\r\n  ascertain what the co-defendant and the victim &quot;were doing.&quot;Â  Id. at 805, 807.Â  \r\nAt a pre-trial\r\n  hearing, the trial court held the police officer's report, which contained the\r\n  defendant's oral statement that &quot;he only took some beer,&quot; and the\r\n  defendant's written statement that the victim offered him a beer and\r\n  &quot;handed&quot; him the rest of the beer were admissible.Â  Pete, 98\r\n  P.3d at 805.Â  However, the police report and the defendant's written statement\r\n  were not introduced into evidence at trial.Â  Id. \r\nAfter the jury\r\n  reached a verdict, but before the verdict was rendered, the trial court\r\n  informed the parties the police report and the defendant's written statement\r\n  were mistakenly sent to the jury room.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 805.Â  After\r\n  this discovery, the bailiff retrieved the officer's statement and &quot;grabbed&quot;\r\n  a second document.Â  Id.Â  However, the second document had been properly\r\n  admitted into evidence.Â  Id.Â  Upon this discovery, the bailiff returned\r\n  the second document, retrieved the other piece of unadmitted evidence, and\r\n  instructed the jury to disregard the police report and the defendant's written\r\n  statement.Â  Id.Â Â  After the trial court explained the course of events,\r\n  the State and the defendant both agreed the verdict should be received and the\r\n  jury should be polled about their knowledge concerning the police report and\r\n  the defendant's written statements.Â  Id. at 805.\r\nDuring polling,\r\n  the jurors indicated the bailiff told them to disregard the police report and\r\n  the defendant's written statement.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 806.Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  some members of the jury panel stated they saw and/or read the police report\r\n  and the defendant's written statement.Â  Id.Â  The defendant was convicted\r\n  of second-degree robbery.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe defendant\r\n  made a motion for a new trial and argued the mistaken submission of the police\r\n  report and his written statement to the jury was prejudicial.Â  Pete, 98\r\n  P.3d at 806.Â  The trial court denied the motion and held the error was harmless\r\n  because the documents were in the jury room for a brief period of time, the\r\n  jury was instructed to disregard the documents, and the statements in the\r\n  police report and the written statement were exculpatory.Â  Id.Â  Division\r\n  One of the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed and held there was no\r\n  reasonable ground to believe that the defendant was prejudiced by the\r\n  nonadmitted documents and the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to\r\n  sustain the conviction.Â  State v. Pete, No. 50404-5-I, 2003 WL 21387208, at *3\r\n  (Wash. Ct. App. June 13, 2003).\r\nOn appeal, the\r\n  Washington Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals' decision and granted\r\n  the defendant's motion for a new trial.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 807.Â  The\r\n  State argued the inadvertent submission of the police report and the\r\n  defendant's written statement to the jury was harmless error because the\r\n  evidence was &quot;very strong&quot; to sustain the conviction.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Namely, the State argued (1) two police officers caught the defendant and the\r\n  co-defendant robbing the victim; (2) the victim's statements corroborated the police\r\n  officers' observations; (3) the victim's inconsistent statement at the scene\r\n  compared to his in court testimony did not absolve the defendant from any\r\n  criminal activity because the victim stated &quot;he thought [the defendant and\r\n  co-defendant] wanted to rob him;&quot; and (4) the police report and the\r\n  defendant's written statement were exculpatory in nature.Â  Id. \r\nIn reversing the\r\n  court of appeals' decision, the Washington Supreme Court noted the police\r\n  officers' testimony regarding their observations that the defendant and\r\n  co-defendant were in the act of robbing the victim was to some extent refuted.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 807.Â  At trial, the victim testified he\r\n  &quot;gave&quot; beer to the defendant and the co-defendant so they would leave\r\n  him alone.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, the court concluded the police report was not\r\n  completely exculpatory because the defendant informed the officer that &quot;he\r\n  only took some beer.&quot; Id.Â  This statement, according to the court,\r\n  &quot;may be considered inculpatory because it indicates that the defendant participated\r\n  in taking property from [the victim] while [the victim] was being assaulted by\r\n  [co-defendant].&quot;Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the court further stated,\r\n  &quot;[W]hen the two unadmitted statements are viewed together, they are\r\n  harmful to [the defendant] in the sense that they are contradictory and could\r\n  suggest to a jury that [the defendant] is a liar who cannot be believed.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn analyzing\r\n  whether the defendant was prejudiced by the inadvertent submission of the\r\n  police report and his written statements, the court noted (1) the defendant\r\n  denied any wrongdoing; (2) the defendant did not testify and instead relied on\r\n  the victim's testimony that the defendant did not speak or touch the victim,\r\n  and the victim voluntarily gave beer to the defendant; and (3) the victim had\r\n  problems remembering the events on the night in question.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d\r\n  at 807.Â  Based on the facts of the case, the court concluded the submission of\r\n  the police report and the defendant's written statement &quot;seriously\r\n  undermined [the defendant's] defense and nothing short of a new trial can\r\n  correct the error.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nFurthermore, the\r\n  Washington Supreme Court observed that even though the evidence was deemed\r\n  admissible at a pre-trial hearing, the State did not offer or admit the\r\n  evidence at trial.Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 808.Â  The court pronounced:\r\n\r\nThe jury's receipt of this extrinsic evidence after\r\n  the close of its evidence presented a &quot;no win&quot; situation for [the\r\n  defendant] because he was not able to object to or explain the extrinsic\r\n  evidence.Â  Furthermore, his counsel was unable to cross-examine either the\r\n  transport officer or the officer who took [the defendant's] statement.Â  The\r\n  fact that the bailiff instructed the jurors to not consider the extrinsic\r\n  evidence does not, in our view, mitigate the harmfulness of the error.Â  Even if\r\n  the trial court had given the instruction, which would be the appropriate\r\n  practice, the same can be said. \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, we conclude the improper submission of Hill's two written statements to\r\n  the jury is reversible error.Â  Although the circuit court ruled Hill's written\r\n  statements were voluntarily given, the State did not introduce Hill's\r\n  statements into evidence at trial.Â  Thus, the entire jury panel was exposed to\r\n  evidence that had not been admitted during trial, thereby unduly prejudicing\r\n  Hill.\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  the State contends despite any error in the inadvertent submission of Hill's\r\n  statements, such error is harmless based on the evidence presented at trial.Â  In support of its argument that the admission of Hill's written statements\r\n  was harmless error, the State argues (1) Taylor and Warren's testimony\r\n  indicated that Hill actively participated in the commission of the armed\r\n  robberies; (2) Hill was seen in the back seat of the fleeing vehicle after an\r\n  officer attempted to stop the vehicle; (3) officers found a ski mask along with\r\n  a black coat linked to Hill; and (4) Hill fled from the police and was discovered\r\n  hiding in a creek bed.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhether\r\n  an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  State\r\n    v. Wiley,&nbsp;387 S.C. 490, 497, 692 S.E.2d 560, 564&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2010).\r\n  No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and\r\n  prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to\r\n  the entire case. Id. Error is harmless when it &quot;could not\r\n  reasonably have affected the result of the trial.&quot; Id. &quot;When\r\n  guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other\r\n  rational conclusion can be reached, [an appellate] court should not set aside a\r\n  conviction because of errors not affecting the result[].&quot; State v.\r\n    Kirton, 381 S.C. 7, 25, 671 S.E.2d 107, 115-16 (Ct. App. 2008) (citation\r\n  omitted).\r\nA comparison of\r\n  Hill's trial testimony and Hill's written statements implicates Taylor and\r\n  Warren's direct involvement in the commission of the robberies of the motels\r\n  and that Hill remained in the vehicle.Â  Specifically, Hill's written statement\r\n  given to the Simpsonville Police Department provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nI know [Taylor and Warren] have been jacking\r\n  (robbing) people or places.Â  I have heard they have robbed the Motel 6 where\r\n  [Warren's] girlfriend works there.Â  [Warren] had a .380 pistol.Â  [Taylor and\r\n  Warren] said it was stolen.Â  They have tried to get me to ride with them\r\n  before.Â  About nine p.m. [Taylor] and [Warren] came to my girlfriend's house.Â  They\r\n    wanted me to go ride with them.Â  They said if I wanted to go to work to work\r\n    with them . . . .Â  We went to the La Quinta Inn and [Warren] went to some\r\n  white boys and bought a beer.Â  They let them in the side door.Â  Both [Taylor]\r\n  and [Warren] robbed the motel and we left and went to a mall . . . .Â  [Warren]\r\n  attempted to use a credit card that was taken and it did not work.Â  We left in\r\n  a white car.Â  I thought we were going home.Â  We drove to Simpsonville and\r\n  stopped at the gas station. . . .Â  We parked in a white motel near the Hampton\r\n  Inn.Â  [Warren] and [Taylor] got out of the car and went around a gate and went\r\n  into the Hampton Inn.Â  They later came back and [Warren] said that he had went\r\n  back and got him.Â  This meaning [Warren] had went back behind the counter and\r\n  robbed the clerk. [Warren] had the billfold which was taken from the clerk at the Hampton Inn.Â \r\n  [Taylor] was driving away.Â  Then the police got behind us.Â  He pulled over [to]\r\n  stop[] briefly.Â  Then [Taylor] pulled onto the road again.Â  We later went off\r\n  the road and I was later arrested by the police.Â  I am sorry that these places\r\n  were robbed.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nHill's statement\r\n  to the Greenville County Sheriff's Office provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nI have decided that I wanted to clear all this up\r\n  and get everything in the open.Â  I told [Officer] Bobo about how I was involved\r\n  in the robbery at the Hampton Inn and who I was with.Â  I also told him about a\r\n  robbery at the La Quinta Inn on 85 . . . . [Warren] and [Taylor] are involved\r\n  with some other people who are going around catching likcs (sic) on people.\r\n  Catching licks means robbing people or stealing something.Â  Anything to come up\r\n  with money quick.Â  Lately [Warren] and [Taylor] have been robbing motels and\r\n  that's who [I] was with when the Hampton Inn got robbed.Â  Before we went to the\r\n  Hampton Inn we went to the La Quinta Inn . . . .Â  I was sitting in the back\r\n  seat of the car we were in.Â  It was a white Ford Escort.Â  [Warren] got out of\r\n  the car and he walked up on a group of white guys in the parking lot.Â  [Warren]\r\n  walked back to the car and said let me get a dollar so he could buy a beer from\r\n  one of the white guys.Â  [Warren] walked back over and one of the white dudes\r\n  opened the back door, like on the end of the hallway, and let them in.Â \r\n  [Warren] went in with the white guys and came back a few minutes later and got\r\n  [Taylor] and [Warren and Taylor] went back into the motel.Â  [Warren] and\r\n  [Taylor] were in there not even five minutes and they came running to the car.Â \r\n  I didn't see no money or gun but they had a wallet.Â  [Warren] said we got to go\r\n  to the mall, we got to go to the mall.Â  We went over to Haywood Mall.Â  We went to\r\n  a store upstairs.Â  It was a clothing store.Â  [Warren] tried to buy a hooded\r\n  sweatshirt with a credit card out of the wallet, but it was declined.Â  Then we\r\n  went over to a jewelry stand and [Warren] tried to buy something there.Â  I\r\n  walked off and [Taylor] came over there by me.Â  I was saying that they were\r\n  getting greedy and stop being greedy.Â  [Warren] couldn't buy anything at the\r\n  jewelry store . . . .Â  They went to the Hampton Inn in Simpsonville and hit it\r\n  and we ran . . . .Â  This group that is hitting things is mainly [Warren] and\r\n  [Taylor] and whoever they could get to go with them.Â  \r\n\r\nHill's statement\r\n  to the Simpsonville Police Department reveals his knowledge that Taylor and\r\n  Warren wanted him to &quot;ride with them&quot; and to &quot;work with\r\n  them.&quot;Â  This phrase, in conjunction with the context of Hill's statement\r\n  to the Simpsonville Police Department, indicates that Taylor and Warren wanted\r\n  Hill to ride with them to participate in an armed robbery.Â  However, at trial, Hill\r\n  testified he was unaware of any robbery plans and explicitly denied any\r\n  involvement in the robberies.Â  In fact, Hill specifically stated he rode with\r\n  Taylor and Warren on the belief that they were going to a party and going to\r\n  meet some girls.Â  \r\nWhen viewed\r\n  together, Hill's statement to the Simpsonville Police Department and his trial\r\n  testimony are contradictory and undermine Hill's credibility to the jury.Â \r\n  Because Hill's credibility was impermissibly impugned by evidence not admitted\r\n  at trial, this contradiction strongly suggested to the jury that Hill was\r\n  untruthful during his testimony and could not be believed.Â  Due to the gravity\r\n  of this error, we conclude Hill's entire defense was prejudiced because his\r\n  credibility was substantially damaged.Â  See State v. Outlaw, 307 S.C. 177,\r\n  180, 414 S.E.2d 147, 148&nbsp;(1992) (&quot;[E]rror which substantially damages\r\n  the defendant's credibility cannot be held harmless where such credibility is\r\n  essential to his defense.&quot;) (citation omitted); see also Pete, 98\r\n  P.3d at 807 (noting the inadvertent submission of contradictory evidence not\r\n    admitted at trial suggested to the jury that defendant was a liar).Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  unlike many South Carolina cases in which a circuit court may issue a curative\r\n  instruction to cure the prejudicial effect of the jury's consideration of\r\n  extrinsic evidence, the circuit court was unable to issue a curative\r\n  instruction due to the timeframe when the error was discovered.Â  Moreover, this\r\n  error was furthered compounded because the foreman of the jury informed the\r\n  circuit court that the jury considered Hill's statements to be important\r\n  evidence.Â  Nevertheless, we note the holding in Rogers provides guidance\r\n  on the appropriate remedy.Â  See Rogers, 96 S.C. at 353, 80 S.E.\r\n  at 621 (noting the jury's receipt of incompetent evidence without a curative\r\n  instruction could have caused the jury to rely on the improper testimony in\r\n  reaching its conclusion and thus a new trial was the appropriate remedy).Â  Under the\r\n  circumstances of this case, the absence of a curative instruction, in\r\n  conjunction with the jury's belief that Hill's statements were considered\r\n  important evidence, precludes us from being able to unequivocally ascertain\r\n  whether the jury's verdict rested on the evidence presented at trial or whether\r\n  the verdict was improperly affected by Hill's written statements.Â  See State v.\r\n    White, 371 S.C. 439, 445, 639 S.E.2d 160, 163&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;A\r\n  curative instruction to disregard incompetent evidence and not to consider it\r\n  during deliberation is deemed to have cured any alleged error in its\r\n  admission.&quot;) (citation omitted); see also State v. Reese,&nbsp;370\r\n  S.C. 31, 38, 633 S.E.2d 898, 901 (2006) (&quot;Jurors are sworn to be governed\r\n  by the evidence, and it is their duty to consider the facts of the case\r\n  impartially.&quot;) overruled on other grounds by State v. Belcher, 385\r\n  S.C. 597, 685 S.E.2d 802 (2009).\r\nFinally, at the\r\n  second motion for a new trial hearing on June 11, 2003, the circuit court judge\r\n  indicated that it would have admitted Hill's written statements at trial.Â \r\n  However, the written statements were solely admitted into evidence for purposes\r\n  of the Jackson v. Denno hearing.Â  Because the written statements were\r\n  not admitted at trial, and the jury was exposed to Hill's written statements\r\n  during its deliberations, Hill was denied the opportunity to object to or\r\n  explain his written statements.Â  See Pete, 98 P.3d at 808 (noting\r\n  defendant was not able to object to or explain the extrinsic evidence when the\r\n  jury received the evidence after the close of evidence).Â  Additionally, Hill\r\n  was unable to cross-examine Officer Bobo and Officer Smith regarding his\r\n  written statements.[6]Â  Pete, 98 P.3d at 808 (finding defendant was denied the right to cross-examination\r\n  when the jury received extrinsic evidence after the close of all the\r\n  evidence).Â  Based on the foregoing, we conclude the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion in denying Hill's motion for a new trial as to his convictions for\r\n  armed robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Accordingly, the circuit\r\n  court's decision is\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nGEATHERS and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\r\n[2] In 1998 or 1999, Jonathan Hill changed his name to\r\n  Jonathan Green.Â  However, because the initial case caption referred to\r\n  Appellant as Jonathan Hill, we refer to his former name for purposes of this\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\n[3] 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n[4] Taylor stated, &quot;[We did] not actually discuss[]\r\n  [robbing the La Quinta], but it was understood by each one of us what was going\r\n  to go on.&quot; \r\n[5] Hill filed an application for post-conviction relief\r\n  (PCR) based on his trial counsel's failure to file a notice of appeal.Â  On\r\n  April 7, 2005, Judge Larry Patterson conducted a PCR hearing.Â  Judge Patterson\r\n  denied and dismissed the application without prejudice because Hill had a\r\n  pending motion for a new trial for which a written order had not yet been filed\r\n  by the circuit court judge.Â  \r\n[6] Officer Wes Smith of the Greenville County Sheriff's\r\n  Office took Hill's written statement and testified at the Jackson v. Denno hearing.Â  However, Officer Smith did not testify at trial.Â  Officer Bobo's testimony\r\n  was limited to his actions in taking photographs at the scene where Hill,\r\n  Taylor, and Warren were arrested in the early morning hours of February 1,\r\n  2002.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4868","title":"Keefer v.

McFaddin, Jr., Family Court\r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4868\r\nSubmitted May 4, 2011 â€“ Filed August 10,\r\n  2011 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHarry C. Wilson, Jr., of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\nRichard C. Jones, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  In this action for divorce, Linda Keefer (Wife)\r\n  appeals from the family court's order directing that the qualified domestic\r\n  relations order (QDRO) be prepared using the shared plan method, arguing the\r\n  court should have directed that the order be prepared using the separate plan\r\n  method to determine her portion of Rodney Keefer's (Husband) pension plan.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1974 in Sumter, South Carolina,\r\n  and two children were born of the marriage.Â  The parties officially separated\r\n  in 1991.[2]\r\nIn March 2007, Wife filed for divorce in the Sumter County Family\r\n  Court, seeking permanent periodic alimony; equitable division of the marital\r\n  assets and debts; permanent health insurance coverage; and attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Husband filed an answer, seeking a divorce based on the ground of\r\n  desertion; equitable division of the marital assets; possession of the marital\r\n  home; and possession of four vehicles.Â  Husband also asserted Wife was not\r\n  entitled to alimony due to her abandonment of the marriage; requested both\r\n  parties be barred from claiming any interest in each other's retirement and/or\r\n  pension plans; and requested each party be responsible for their own debts,\r\n  health and life insurance, and attorney's fees. \r\nOn March 3, 2008, the parties reached an agreement on all issues\r\n  relating to property, separation, and support.Â  That day, the family court\r\n  granted Wife a divorce on the ground of one-year's continuous separation and\r\n  incorporated the agreement into the divorce decree.Â  After the divorce decree\r\n  was filed, the parties began preparing the QDROs concerning Husband's 401(k)\r\n  and pension plan.Â  The parties reached an agreement as to the 401(k), but not\r\n  as to the pension plan.[3]Â \r\n  The QDRO form provided by Husband's employer for his pension plan could be\r\n  prepared using one of two methods: the shared plan or the separate plan.Â  Under\r\n  the shared plan, Wife's payments from the plan would begin when Husband began\r\n  drawing from the fund, but Wife would lose benefits on her death and the\r\n  benefits would revert to Husband.Â  Additionally, Husband's death would\r\n  terminate Wife's benefits. \r\nUnder the separate plan, which Wife preferred, Wife could elect to\r\n  draw payments before Husband's retirement, and the benefits would survive the\r\n  death of Husband and/or Wife.Â  The parties disagreed about which method the\r\n  QDRO should use to determine Wife's benefits under Husband's pension plan, and\r\n  as a result, Wife filed a motion for court intervention.Â  On March 27, 2009,\r\n  the family court filed an order, directing the QDRO be prepared using the\r\n  shared plan method.Â  Wife filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\n  novo. Â Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).Â  Although\r\n  this court reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to\r\n  ignore the fact that the trial court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\n  their testimony.Â  Lewis, 392 S.C. at 388, 709 S.E.2d at 653.Â  The appellant\r\n  bears the burden of convincing this court that the family court erred in its\r\n  findings.Â  Id. at 391, 709 S.E.2d at 655.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court erred in directing that the QDRO be\r\n  prepared using the shared plan method.Â  She maintains the court should have\r\n  directed that the order be prepared using the separate plan method to determine\r\n  her portion of Husband's pension plan.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The\r\n    construction of a separation agreement is a matter of contract law.Â  Nicholson\r\n      v. Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 532, 663 S.E.2d 74, 79 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n    &quot;The court's only function with an agreement that is clear and capable of\r\n    legal construction is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intention of the\r\n    parties as found within the agreement and to give them effect.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n    If the agreement is ambiguous, the court should seek to determine the parties'\r\n    intent.Â  Id. at 533, 663 S.E.2d at 79.Â  &quot;An ambiguous contract is\r\n    one capable of being understood in more ways than one, an agreement obscure in\r\n    meaning through indefiniteness of expression, or having a double meaning.&quot; Id. (quoting Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 76, 641 S.E.2d 446, 452\r\n    (Ct. App. 2006)).Â  If a marital agreement is unambiguous, the court must\r\n    enforce it according to its terms.[4]Â  Id. at 532, 663 S.E.2d at 79.Â  However, if the agreement has been merged\r\n    into the court's decree, as it was in this case, &quot;the decree, to the\r\n    extent possible, should be construed to effect the intent of both the judge and\r\n    the parties.&quot;Â  Id.Â  By merging an agreement into a divorce decree,\r\n    the court transforms it from a contract between the parties into a decree of\r\n    the court.Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 214, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct.\r\n    App. 2004).Â  &quot;With the court's approval, the terms become a part of the\r\n    decree and are binding on the parties and the court.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983)).Â \r\n    &quot;Thereafter, the agreement, as part of the court order, is fully subject\r\n    to the family court's authority to interpret and enforce its own decrees.&quot;Â  Id. at 214, 603 S.E.2d at 601-602; see Terry v. Lee, 308\r\n    S.C. 459, 462, 419 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1992) (stating the family court has\r\n    exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties under an\r\n    agreement incorporated into a family court decree).\r\n  The\r\n    separation agreement at issue in this case, which the court merged into the\r\n    divorce decree at the parties' request, provides in pertinent part:Â Â  \r\n\r\n  (ii)\r\n    Pension/Retirement Benefits:Â  Upon the Husband's retirement, the Wife\r\n    shall be entitled to share in the Husband's International Paper retirement\r\n    pension fund, which is separate and different from the 401(k) fund, in that\r\n    percentage share as calculated consistent with the formula set out below:Â  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Step One:\r\n      19.5 (Years of Service through March/07) ??? Â (Husband's Total, Actual # of Years Service w/ International Paper Co./Union Camp at the date of his actual retirement)\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Step Two:Â Â \r\n       The above result is multiplied by 40%\r\n    (percent).\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Step Three:&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n   The Wife receives the resulting percentage\r\n    of each monthly pension, consistent with the above calculation, at the\r\n      time the Husband begins to draw payment from his International Paper\r\n    retirement pension fund.Â  (Emphasis added in italics).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  Wife\r\n    asserts the family court should have ordered the QDRO be prepared using the\r\n    separate plan because it allows Wife to elect to draw her share of\r\n    the payments from the plan before Husband's actual retirement date.Â  The\r\n    separate plan also allows the\r\n    benefits to survive the death of Husband and/or Wife, and Wife can designate a beneficiary to receive her share\r\n    of the benefits upon her death.Â  In contrast, under the shared plan, Wife\r\n    cannot receive any benefits until Husband retires and begins to draw from the fund.Â  Additionally,\r\n    Husband's death will terminate Wife's benefits, and if Wife predeceases\r\n    Husband, Wife's benefits will terminate upon her death and the benefits will\r\n    revert to Husband.Â  Wife argues the agreement provides that she will receive\r\n    forty percent of the marital portion of Husband's pension benefits and there is\r\n    no mention in the agreement that she would lose these rights upon her or\r\n    Husband's death.\r\n  As\r\n    the family court judge noted in his order on Wife's motion for court\r\n    intervention, &quot;[w]hen the parties reached their agreement, to include\r\n    Husband's retirement, the parties had not discussed which QDRO model to use.Â \r\n    The dispute about which QDRO model to use arose only after the plan\r\n    administrator (International Paper or IP) informed the parties and lawyers of\r\n    the two QDRO models.&quot;Â  Thus, the judge concluded, &quot;it is not correct\r\n    to say that this court is saddled with determining the intent of the parties\r\n    regarding which QDRO to use before the two models were revealed.&quot;Â  The\r\n    judge determined it was the role of the court to &quot;determine which QDRO\r\n    model most accurately reflects the parties' agreement.&quot;\r\n  In\r\n    its review of the agreement, the family court noted the agreement provides,\r\n    &quot;[u]pon the Husband's retirement,&quot; &quot;[t]he Wife receives the\r\n    resulting percentage of each monthly pension,&quot; and &quot;at the time the\r\n    Husband begins to draw payment.&quot;Â  Thus, the court determined &quot;that\r\n    Wife's share of the retirement benefits would start and be received on a\r\n    monthly basis,&quot; and &quot;she would not be able to elect to receive her\r\n    share before Husband's monthly retirement payments or benefits started.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n    the court noted, &quot;there is no 'survivorship' provision in the agreement\r\n    similar to such language in the separate plan,&quot; &quot;[t]he agreement\r\n    states . . . Wife's portion is that percentage of each of Husband's monthly\r\n    benefit[s] or payment[s],&quot; and &quot;the agreement states that Wife 'shall\r\n    share' in Husband's retirement account.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the court noted the\r\n    agreement did not contain language &quot;that reflects that Wife would have\r\n    certain options that are provided in the separate plan.&quot;Â  As a result, the\r\n    court found the agreement language more closely mirrored the shared plan QDRO\r\n    model.Â  Additionally, both parties submitted multiple versions of the QDRO to\r\n    the plan administrator, and the version accepted twice by the administrator was\r\n    the shared plan model.\r\n  Therefore,\r\n    based on the family court's authority to interpret and enforce its own decrees\r\n    and our review of the evidence, we find the evidence supports the family\r\n    court's determination.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  Accordingly, the family\r\n    court's order directing that the QDRO be prepared using the shared plan method\r\n    is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  FEW, C.J., and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  While\r\n  Husband and Wife were married for seventeen years before they separated, the\r\n  parties lived together for less than three years.\r\n[3] Â Two QDROs were required.Â  One order was to allow a\r\n  trustee-to-trustee transfer of $50,000 from Husband's 401(k) to Wife.Â  This\r\n  QDRO is not at issue in this case.Â  The other order was required so that Wife\r\n  could share in Husband's pension plan, which was separate from Husband's\r\n  401(k).\r\n[4]Â  In their briefs, both Husband and Wife maintain the\r\n  agreement is unambiguous.Â  Additionally, in its order denying Wife's motion for\r\n  reconsideration, the court adopted Husband's return to Wife's motion, which\r\n  asserted the agreement is unambiguous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4848","title":"Wannamaker v.

Wannamaker (Husband) appeals the family court's award of alimony to\r\n  Katherine Thomas Wannamaker (Wife) and the court's valuation of the parties'\r\n  retirement accounts.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part. Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  in December 1991, and no children were born as a result of the marriage;\r\n  however, Wife had two children from a previous marriage.Â  During the first\r\n  seven years of the parties' marriage, Husband was the primary provider and\r\n  earned approximately $30,000 per year.Â  Wife did not work outside the home.\r\nSubsequently, Husband lost\r\n  his job, returned to school, and earned an undergraduate and two master's\r\n  degrees.Â  After completing his education, Husband secured employment as an instructor\r\n  at Midlands Technical College and earned approximately $60,000 per year between\r\n  2002 and 2006.Â  When Husband lost his job, Wife secured employment with the State\r\n  of South Carolina, earning approximately $30,000 per year.Â  Wife's income was\r\n  the parties' primary, but not the sole, means of support while Husband\r\n  completed his education.Â  Although Wife attended college in the mid-1970s, she\r\n  never finished her undergraduate degree.Â  The parties separated in January of\r\n  2006, and Husband initiated this action for divorce in March 2006. \r\nIn June 2006, the family\r\n  court issued a temporary order providing: &quot;In lieu of alimony to be paid\r\n  [Wife], Husband is hereby ordered to continue paying $50.00 per month to the\r\n  Department of Mental Health&quot; for drug abuse treatment for Wife's son.Â  The\r\n  temporary order did not otherwise mandate alimony.Â  Wife received the sole and\r\n  exclusive use of the marital home, and Husband was ordered to pay the first\r\n  mortgage, while Wife was ordered to pay the second mortgage. \r\nAfter a final hearing, the family\r\n  court issued a final decree of divorce declaring the parties divorced.Â  The\r\n  family court awarded Wife $500 per month in permanent periodic alimony\r\n  beginning in May 2008.Â  Although Husband presented expert testimony establishing\r\n  the present day value of the parties' accounts, the family court used the date\r\n  of filing valuation.Â  To effectuate a fifty-fifty equitable division of the\r\n  marital estate, the family court awarded Wife $42,977 from Husband's account.Â  Husband\r\n  also received credit for all payments he made on the first mortgage pursuant to\r\n  the temporary order.Â  Â Â Â \r\nWife filed a 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion requesting the family court reconsider its decision to not award her\r\n  attorney's fees and credit her the payments she made on the second mortgage.Â \r\n  Husband also filed a 59(e) motion maintaining the family court erred in\r\n  awarding permanent periodic alimony and valuing the parties' retirement\r\n  accounts.Â  Â \r\nAfter a hearing, the family\r\n  court amended the final decree of divorce.Â  The amended order awarded Wife\r\n  credit for the second mortgage payments she made pursuant to the temporary\r\n  order.Â  The family court also awarded Wife retroactive alimony and required\r\n  Husband to pay Wife $500 for each month from the date of the temporary order\r\n  through April 2008.[1]Â \r\n  The order further provided the retroactive alimony payment was due upon the\r\n  sale of the marital home and was to be deducted from Husband's portion of the\r\n  net proceeds from the sale.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In appeals from the\r\n  family court, this Court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.&quot; Simmons\r\n    v. Simmons, Op. No. 26970 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv.\r\n  Sh. No. 16 at 29).Â  Accordingly, this court has the authority to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Lewis v.\r\n    Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\n  No. 16 at 42, 51).Â  However, we recognize that the family court is in a\r\n  superior position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight\r\n  of the evidence.Â  See id. at 51.Â  The burden is on the appellant\r\n  to demonstrate the family court's findings are against the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Permanent Periodic Spousal\r\n  Support\r\nHusband argues the family\r\n  court abused its discretion because it improperly weighed several factors in\r\n  awarding Wife permanent periodic spousal support.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlimony is a substitute for\r\n  the support normally incident to the marital relationship and should put the\r\n  supported spouse in the same position, or as near as is practicable to the same\r\n  position, enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177,\r\n  184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  If an award of alimony is\r\n  warranted, the family court has a duty to make an award that is fit, equitable,\r\n  and just.Â  Id.Â  The family court may grant alimony in such amounts and\r\n  for such a term as it considers appropriate under the circumstances.Â  Davis\r\n    v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 79, 641 S.E.2d 446, 454&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  The\r\n  family court must consider the following factors: (1) duration of the marriage,\r\n  (2) the physical and emotional health of the parties, (3) educational\r\n  background of the parties, (4) employment history and earning potential of the\r\n  parties, (5) standard of living during the marriage, (6) current and reasonably\r\n  anticipated earnings of the parties, (7) current and reasonably anticipated\r\n  expenses of the parties, (8) marital and nonmarital property of the parties,\r\n  (9) custody of the children, (10) marital misconduct or fault, (11) tax\r\n  consequences, (12) prior support obligations, and (13) any other factors the\r\n  family court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2010).Â  However,\r\n  &quot;[t]he family court is only required to consider relevant factors.&quot;Â  King v. King, 384 S.C. 134,\r\n  142, 681 S.E.2d 609, 613&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009); see also Epperly v.\r\n    Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886&nbsp;(1994) (remanding for\r\n  consideration of all relevant factors in section 20-3-130(C)). \r\nHusband maintains the family\r\n  court improperly weighed several factors in awarding Wife permanent periodic\r\n  alimony.Â  The record reflects the family court considered the relevant statutory\r\n  factors, but it is difficult to determine how the family court applied those\r\n  factors because the final decree of divorce merely lists the factors considered\r\n  without making specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  When an order\r\n  of the family court violates Rule 26(a), SCRFC, by failing to set forth\r\n  specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, this court may remand the\r\n  matter to the family court or make its own findings of fact in accordance with\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence if the record is sufficient to allow such a\r\n  review.Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526,\r\n  535&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998).Â  We find the record in the instant case is sufficient\r\n  to allow such a review.\r\nHere, the parties were\r\n  married for sixteen years.Â  Nothing in the record indicates the parties have\r\n  any physical or mental health issues.Â  Husband has a bachelor of science degree\r\n  in mathematics and master's degrees in computer resources and information\r\n  systems management and business administration.Â  Wife is a high school graduate\r\n  and attended college classes in the 1970s.Â  Husband's current and reasonably\r\n  anticipated earnings are approximately $60,000 per year while Wife's are\r\n  approximately $30,000 per year.Â  The parties current and reasonably anticipated\r\n  expenses are approximately equal.Â  However, Husband's personal credit card debt\r\n  is substantially higher than Wife's.Â  The parties each have retirement and\r\n  stock accounts in their own names, though some portion of each may be marital\r\n  property.Â  The parties stipulated that Husband's stock account was non-marital.Â \r\n  Because no children were born of the parties' marriage, custody is not an\r\n  issue.Â  Although Wife alleged Husband may have committed adultery, the parties\r\n  stipulated to a divorce on grounds of one year's continuous separation.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the record does not reveal any tax consequences or prior support obligation\r\n  owed by either party.Â  \r\nIn sum, the parties have been\r\n  married for sixteen years. Â Husband has the ability to pay $500 per month from his\r\n  $5,392 gross monthly income and neither party is more at fault than the other\r\n  in the breakdown of the marriage.Â  Further, Wife's education and age appear to\r\n  cap her future earning potential at approximately $30,000 per year.Â  See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121&nbsp;(2004)\r\n  (finding when awarding permanent periodic alimony the three important\r\n  considerations are &quot;(1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the overall\r\n  financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the supporting\r\n  spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than the\r\n  other.&quot;).Â  Based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record and the statutory\r\n  factors, we hold the award of permanent periodic alimony is proper.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Retroactive Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family\r\n  court abused its discretion in awarding retroactive alimony.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially, the primary thrust\r\n  of Husband's argument is that the family court erred in increasing his spousal\r\n  support obligation retroactively without a showing of changed circumstances\r\n  pursuant to section 20-3-170 of the South Carolina Code (1985).[2]Â \r\n  Husband's argument misconstrues the family court's order.Â  The family court did\r\n  not issue an order modifying a prior support obligation.Â  Rather, the family\r\n  court issued an order amending its final decree of divorce pursuant to Rule\r\n  59(e) motions filed by the parties.Â  Accordingly, section 20-3-170 is\r\n  inapplicable, and Wife was not required to show a change in circumstances.\r\nHusband further argues the\r\n  family court erred in amending the final decree of divorce to award Wife\r\n  retroactive alimony when no such request was made.Â  Here, Wife filed a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion requesting the family court reconsider its failure to award her attorney's\r\n  fees and credit for the second mortgage payments she made pursuant to the\r\n  temporary order.Â  Although Wife attempted to justify her entitlement to the\r\n  credit by arguing there was no award of temporary alimony, Wife never requested\r\n  the family court reconsider its decision not to award her retroactive alimony\r\n  in the final decree of divorce.Â  After the Rule 59(e) hearing the family court\r\n  issued an order amending the final decree of divorce to award Wife retroactive\r\n  alimony and credit for the second mortgage payments.\r\nThe family court lacks the\r\n  authority to alter or amend a judgment on its own initiative once the judgment\r\n  is more than ten days old.Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 157, 543\r\n  S.E.2d 224, 230&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  Here, the final decree of divorce was\r\n  filed on August 7, 2008.Â  Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment on\r\n  August 20, 2008, and a hearing was held on September 3, 2008.Â  The order\r\n  amending the final decree of divorce and awarding Wife retroactive alimony was\r\n  filed approximately two months after the final decree of divorce on October 6,\r\n  2008.Â  Because the family court awarded Wife retroactive alimony on its own\r\n  initiative more than ten days after the final decree of divorce, we find the\r\n  family court erred in awarding Wife retroactive alimony.\r\nIII.  Equitable Distribution\r\nHusband argues the family\r\n  court abused its discretion in determining the value of the parties' retirement\r\n  accounts.Â  According to Husband, the family court erred because it disregarded\r\n  the testimony of his expert witness establishing the present cash value of the parties'\r\n  retirement accounts.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband presented expert\r\n  testimony at trial to establish the present cash value of the parties'\r\n  retirement accounts.Â  However, Wife requested the family court value the\r\n  accounts based upon the actual contributions and interest as of the date of\r\n  filing.Â  The family court opted to value the parties' retirement accounts based\r\n  upon the amount of contributions and interest as of the date of filing.Â  Because\r\n  marital property subject to equitable distribution is valued as of the date the\r\n  marital litigation is filed, we find the family court did not err in using the\r\n  date of filing to determine the value of the parties' retirement accounts. Â See Gardner v. Gardner, 368 S.C. 134, 136, 628 S.E.2d 37, 38&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (holding marital property subject to equitable distribution is valued as of the\r\n  date the marital litigation is filed or commenced).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the family court's decisions regarding permanent periodic alimony and\r\n  equitable distribution.Â  However, we reverse the family court's award of\r\n  retroactive alimony.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This totaled $12,500.00.\r\n[2] Section 20-3-170 provides that a prior award of\r\n  alimony is modifiable upon a showing of changed circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4869","title":"Hollis v.

Janette Robinson, who is Glenn's daughter; and Janette's\r\n  husband, Joseph Robinson.Â  The Hollises and Robinsons jointly own approximately\r\n  nineteen acres of land that has been in the Hollis family for generations.Â  The\r\n  Robinsons live on the property with their son in a house overlooking two ponds that\r\n  Glenn, John, and their father built over fifty years ago.Â  The only driveway to\r\n  the Robinsons' home crosses an earthen dam that divides the three-acre upper\r\n  pond from the five-acre lower pond.Â  \r\nIn 1999, Stonington\r\n  purchased property directly upstream from the Hollis and Robinson property for\r\n  the purpose of developing a residential subdivision.Â  The Hollises and\r\n  Robinsons proved at trial that over the next five years Stonington ignored the\r\n  recommendations of its own stormwater management engineers; violated State\r\n  regulations and local laws regarding erosion control and stormwater runoff; and\r\n  misled them, perhaps even lied, about Stonington's intention to remedy the\r\n  problems.Â  The result was severe flooding on the Hollises and Robinsons'\r\n  property, which inhibited the Robinsons' access to their home and filled the\r\n  ponds with as much as four feet of sediment.Â  The estimated cost to restore the\r\n  property is over $250,000.00.Â  The jury awarded $400,000.00 in actual damages\r\n  and $3.5 million in punitive damages.Â  The trial court reduced the actual\r\n  damages award to $315,000.00 as a setoff to account for funds paid by other\r\n  settling defendants.\r\nThe troubles between the\r\n  parties began in 2000, shortly before Stonington began construction.Â  At their\r\n  first meeting, Stonington asked the Robinsons to relinquish easement rights for\r\n  their driveway and asked if it could put a sewer line through their front yard\r\n  to serve the development.Â  When the Robinsons refused both requests, Stonington\r\n  threatened to condemn the land and install the sewer line anyway.[1]Â  \r\nBefore beginning\r\n  construction, Stonington hired Power Engineering to prepare stormwater\r\n  management plans for the subdivision.Â  The Hollises and Robinsons' expert\r\n  testified that stormwater management is a field of engineering that prevents\r\n  the type of severe flooding, erosion, and sediment accumulation that eventually\r\n  occurred on the Hollis and Robinson property.Â  The plans Power Engineering\r\n  prepared for Stonington included protective measures such as silt fences and\r\n  detention ponds to catch eroding soil and sediment runoff.Â  Stonington failed\r\n  to follow the plans, despite its admitted responsibility to do so.Â  \r\nBy late 2002, the Hollises\r\n  and Robinsons started to see silt and sediment coming from the development and\r\n  accumulating in the ponds.Â  Around the same time, Stonington received its first\r\n  notice of violation from Richland County, requiring it to alleviate the\r\n  accumulation in the ponds to avoid penalties.Â  By the spring of 2003, the\r\n  runoff worsened to the point of causing the ponds to flood the Robinsons' yard\r\n  and cover part of their driveway with rushing water.Â  The Hollises and Robinsons\r\n  continually complained to Stonington and asked it to fix the problem.Â \r\n  Stonington assured them the problem would be fixed, but failed to take action.Â  \r\nA Stonington employee testified\r\n  that, as part of its attempt to compromise with the Hollises and Robinsons,\r\n  Stonington placed a fifty-foot-wide conservation easement on the part of its\r\n  property bordering the Hollises and Robinsons to provide them with a buffer for\r\n  protection from the runoff.Â  Stonington told them the buffer increased the size\r\n  of their property because it could never be used for anything but trees.Â  In\r\n  direct contravention of that statement, Stonington then removed all of the trees\r\n  in the &quot;buffer&quot; to install a sewer line for its subdivision.Â  Stonington\r\n  received a $1 million tax deduction for creating the easement.Â  \r\nAfter numerous other\r\n  State and County violation notices and no action from Stonington to alleviate\r\n  the damage, the Hollises and Robinsons finally filed suit against Stonington\r\n  and Power Engineering[2] on July 29, 2005, for negligence, trespass, private nuisance, and violation of\r\n  the Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  By then, the runoff from Stonington caused the\r\n  back of the dam on the upper pond to collapse, and the sediment in the pond had\r\n  accumulated as deep as four feet in some locations.Â  Even after the lawsuit was\r\n  filed, Stonington received violation notices from Richland County directing it\r\n  to protect the ponds from stormwater runoff.Â  \r\nAt trial, the Hollises\r\n  and Robinsons' expert in stormwater management testified that Stonington did\r\n  not follow Power Engineering's stormwater management plans and failed to\r\n  maintain the limited stormwater management system it did build.Â  Stonington's\r\n  only representative to testify at trial admitted it was responsible for\r\n  complying with the stormwater management plans.Â  The Hollises and Robinsons'\r\n  expert testified that while the Hollises and Robinsons may still have\r\n  experienced some problems if Stonington had followed the plans and maintained\r\n  the system, the problems would have been &quot;significantly&quot; less\r\n  serious.Â  The expert gave an example of Stonington's failure to follow the\r\n  plans.Â  He explained that the stormwater system as designed includes a\r\n  temporary check dam to catch sediment after a rainstorm.Â  The system then\r\n  requires the check dam be cleaned out and the sediment hauled elsewhere.Â  The\r\n  expert said Stonington cleaned out the sediment, but then &quot;piled it right\r\n  on the slope right above it[,] . . . obviously making it available for a source\r\n  of erosion the next time it rains.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Hollises and\r\n  Robinsons presented evidence that the cost of repairing the damage caused by\r\n  Stonington and restoring the ponds to their previous condition is $254,384.00,[3] in addition to the $9,813.76 in expenses they incurred before the trial. Â They\r\n  also established damages for loss of use and enjoyment of the ponds.Â  For\r\n  example, Glenn testified the fishing in the ponds is now bad, the children\r\n  cannot swim in the mud, and they can no longer access areas of the ponds due to\r\n  the sediment accumulation.Â  \r\n\r\n II.&nbsp;Procedural History\r\nAt the end of a five-day\r\n  trial, the jury returned a defense verdict for Power Engineering, but found for\r\n  the Hollises and Robinsons against Stonington for negligence, trespass, and\r\n  private nuisance.[4] Â The jury awarded $400,000.00 in actual damages and $3.5 million in punitive\r\n  damages.Â  After the verdict, the Hollises and Robinsons elected the private\r\n  nuisance cause of action.Â  Stonington filed a post-trial motion for judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, new trial absolute or new\r\n  trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial court denied the motion and, after conducting\r\n  a review of the punitive damages award, upheld the constitutionality of the\r\n  amount of the award.Â  Stonington appeals alleging the trial court erred in (1) denying\r\n  its motion for a directed verdict on punitive damages, (2) giving an erroneous jury\r\n  charge on punitive damages, (3) imposing a punitive damages award that violates\r\n  Stonington's due process rights, and (4) denying its post-trial motion for judgment\r\n  or a new trial.Â  We affirm the award of punitive damages and the denial of\r\n  Stonington's post-trial motion.Â  However, we find the amount of the punitive\r\n  damages award to be excessive, and reduce the award to $2 million.\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directed Verdict on Punitive Damages\r\nWhen ruling on a directed\r\n  verdict motion as to punitive damages, &quot;the circuit court must view the\r\n  evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot; Â Mishoe v. QHG of Lake City,\r\n    Inc., 366 S.C. 195, 200, 621 S.E.2d 363, 366 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding\r\n  sufficient evidence to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury).Â \r\n  &quot;In reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict . . . , the\r\n  appellate court applies the same standard as the circuit court.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;The issue of punitive damages must be submitted to the jury if more than\r\n  one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence as to whether the\r\n  defendant's behavior was reckless, willful, or wanton.&quot;Â  366 S.C. at 201,\r\n  621 S.E.2d at 366.Â  \r\nThe record contains\r\n  evidence that Stonington ignored regulations regarding erosion control,\r\n  stormwater runoff, and even its own engineer's plans; took no action to prevent\r\n  or correct damage it knew it was causing to the ponds; and used threats and\r\n  deception to avoid the consequences of its misconduct.Â  The trial judge, who\r\n  had the benefit of observing the witnesses and the presentation of evidence\r\n  first-hand, summarized the evidence of punitive damages in his post-trial order\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    Court finds that there was ample evidence presented at trial . . . upon which\r\n    the jury could have based its award of punitive damages, such as (1) the\r\n    testimony by the plaintiffs about pre-construction meetings between Stonington\r\n    and the plaintiffs where the plaintiffs expressed concern about the potential\r\n    environmental impact of Stonington's development on their properties and ponds,\r\n    (2) the testimony by the plaintiffs about meetings between the plaintiffs and\r\n    Stonington after construction activities began expressing concern for damage\r\n    actually occurring at that time, (3) the DHEC and Richland County inspection\r\n    reports and correspondence demonstrating that Stonington failed to maintain its\r\n    stormwater management plan, even after being put on notice by the County and by\r\n    DHEC of the offsite impact, (4) the testimony of Dr. Meadows about the extreme\r\n    inadequacies of Stonington's maintenance of the stormwater management system\r\n    even after the lawsuit was filed, and (5) the testimony from the plaintiffs of\r\n    Stonington's attempted bullying and threats to the plaintiffs about the\r\n    location of the development's sewer line and the relocation of the plaintiffs'\r\n    ingress/egress easement.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the trial judge\r\n  correctly denied the motion because, viewing the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the Hollises and Robinsons, the jury had ample evidence from which\r\n  to find Stonington acted in reckless disregard of the rights of others. \r\n\r\n IV.&nbsp; Punitive Damages Jury Charge\r\nStonington objected to a\r\n  portion of the beginning of the jury charge on damages in which the trial judge\r\n  said:\r\n\r\n  Now,\r\n    members of the jury, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about damages.Â  And\r\n    in this case we have actual damages and we have punitive damages as to both\r\n    Defendants.\r\n\r\nStonington argued the\r\n  charge required the jury to find actual and punitive damages as to both defendants.Â \r\n  We find no reversible error.\r\n&quot;When an appellate\r\n  court reviews an alleged error in a jury charge, it 'must consider the court's\r\n  jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at\r\n  trial.'&quot;Â  Ardis v. Sessions, 383 S.C. 528, 532, 682 S.E.2d 249, 250\r\n  (2009) (quoting Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C.\r\n  488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999)).Â  &quot;If, as a whole, the charges are\r\n  reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not\r\n  constitute reversible error.&quot;Â  Keaton, 334 S.C. at 497, 514 S.E.2d\r\n  at 575.Â  \r\nThroughout\r\n  the damages charge, the trial court made numerous statements indicating that\r\n  the jury was not required to award actual or punitive damages.\r\n\r\n  Members\r\n    of the jury, if actual damages are found, . . . exemplary or punitive\r\n    damages will be allowed . . . .\r\n    [I]n\r\n    this case, the Plaintiff is seeking punitive damages in addition to actual\r\n    damages.\r\n    . . . .\r\n    [P]unitive\r\n    damages can only be awarded when the Plaintiff proves by clear and\r\n    convincing evidence the Defendant's actions were willful, wanton, malicious, or\r\n    in reckless disregard of the Plaintiff's rights.\r\n    . . . .\r\n    Before\r\n    you can award punitive damage, members of the jury, you must first find\r\n    that the Plaintiff is entitled to actual or nominal damages.Â  \r\n\r\nConsidered in isolation,\r\n  the sentence to which Stonington objected might be misleading.Â  However, considering\r\n  the charge as a whole, the trial court adequately explained to the jury that it\r\n  could not award actual or punitive damages unless the plaintiffs met the\r\n  applicable burden of proof.Â  In the context of the entire charge, we find the\r\n  sentence at issue was merely transitional, serving as an introduction to the\r\n  damages portion of the charge.[5]Â  See Wells v. Halyard, 341 S.C. 234, 239, 533 S.E.2d 341, 344 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (finding a statement which &quot;potentially could mislead the jury\r\n  if taken out of context, . . . was merely introducing [a] concept&quot;).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find no reversible error.\r\n\r\n V.&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutionality of the Punitive Damages Award\r\nStonington challenges the\r\n  constitutionality of the amount of punitive damages.Â  Therefore, we are\r\n  required to determine whether the award of punitive damages in this case is\r\n  consistent with due process.Â  James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C.\r\n  187, 194, 638 S.E.2d 667, 670 (2006); see Mitchell v. Fortis Ins. Co.,\r\n  385 S.C. 570, 583, 686 S.E.2d 176, 183 (2009) (holding an appellate court must\r\n  conduct a de novo review of a trial court's determination of the constitutionality\r\n  of a punitive damages award).Â  This requires us to determine whether the award\r\n  was reasonable in light of the following guideposts:Â  \r\n(1)\r\n  the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; (2) the disparity\r\n  between the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the amount\r\n  of the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive\r\n  damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in\r\n  comparable cases.Â  \r\nAustin v.\r\n  Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 52, 691 S.E.2d 135, 151 (2010)\r\n  (citing Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 585, 587-88, 686 S.E.2d at 184-86; BMW\r\n    of N. Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 575 (1996)).Â  We affirm the award of\r\n  punitive damages, but reduce the amount to $2 million.\r\n\r\na.&nbsp;Reprehensibility\r\nOur discussion of the\r\n  facts of this case demonstrates that Stonington's misconduct was\r\n  reprehensible.Â  In order to evaluate the reasonableness of the amount of the\r\n  award, however, we must determine the degree of reprehensibility. Â Austin,\r\n  387 S.C. at 53, 691 S.E.2d at 151; see also State Farm Mut. Auto.\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 419 (2003) (&quot;[P]unitive damages\r\n  should only be awarded if the defendant's culpability, after having paid\r\n  compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of\r\n  further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.&quot;); Gore, 517\r\n  U.S. at 575 (describing reprehensible conduct sufficient for an award of\r\n  punitive damages as reflecting &quot;'the enormity of [the] offense'&quot; and\r\n  &quot;the accepted view that some wrongs are more blameworthy than others&quot;\r\n  (quoting Day v. Woodworth, 13 U.S. (1 How.) 363, 371 (1852))).Â  In doing\r\n  so, we must consider whether\r\n\r\n  (i)\r\n    the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; (ii) the tortious conduct\r\n    evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard for the health or safety of\r\n    others; (iii) the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; (iv) the\r\n    conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and (v) the harm\r\n    was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, rather than mere\r\n    accident.\r\n\r\nMitchell, 385 S.C.\r\n  at 587, 686 S.E.2d at 185.Â  \r\nÂ Our analysis of the\r\n  first two of these considerations indicates Stonington's misconduct involved a\r\n  lesser degree of reprehensibility.Â  First, although the Hollises and Robinsons incurred\r\n  significant monetary damages, they did not suffer any physical harm.Â  Finding only\r\n  economic harm &quot;would typically weigh against [] reprehensibility.&quot;Â \r\n  385 S.C. at 589, 686 S.E.2d at 186; see also Duncan v. Ford Motor Co.,\r\n  385 S.C. 119, 143, 682 S.E.2d 877, 889 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding the existence\r\n  of only economic harm weighs in favor of the defendant).Â  \r\nSecond, while Stonington's\r\n  conduct did demonstrate an indifference to the property rights of others, it\r\n  did not evince an indifference to or reckless disregard for the health or\r\n  safety of people.Â  Reckless disregard for the property rights of others can be\r\n  sufficient misconduct to support an award of punitive damages.Â  See Harris\r\n    v. Burnside, 261 S.C. 190, 196, 199 S.E.2d 65, 68 (1973) (explaining in a\r\n  tort action for property damages that &quot;punitive damages are allowable in\r\n  tort actions, not only as a punishment for wrong, but as a vindication of\r\n  private rights when it is proved that such have been wantonly, willfully or\r\n  maliciously violated&quot;).Â  However, when evaluating the degree of a\r\n  defendant's reprehensibility in a post-trial review of the award, the\r\n  defendant's reprehensibility is not enhanced pursuant to this second\r\n  consideration unless it involves the reckless disregard for the health or\r\n  safety of people.Â  \r\nAs to the third\r\n  consideration, the record does not indicate, and neither of the parties argues,\r\n  whether the Hollises and Robinsons were financially vulnerable.Â  Thus, the\r\n  third consideration does not favor a lesser or a higher degree of\r\n  reprehensibility.Â  \r\nThe fourth and fifth\r\n  considerations, however, indicate a higher degree of reprehensibility.Â  As to the\r\n  fourth consideration, no evidence was presented as to whether Stonington or its\r\n  members had engaged in similar conduct on other development projects.Â  However,\r\n  Stonington's conduct involved repeated actions towards the Hollises and\r\n  Robinsons, and thus was not an isolated incident.Â  In the face of repeated\r\n  requests from the Hollises and Robinsons to fix the ongoing problems, and\r\n  despite repeated official notices of regulatory violations, Stonington\r\n  continued for over four years[6] to engage in conduct the jury determined to be reckless. Â See Mitchell,\r\n  385 S.C. at 589-90, 686 S.E.2d at 186 (finding the defendant's &quot;conduct\r\n  involved repeated acts of deliberate indifference&quot; without considering its\r\n  conduct on other policies or claims).Â  Finally, as to the fifth consideration, the\r\n  Hollises and Robinsons' harm was to some extent the result of intentional\r\n  deceit, rather than mere accident.Â  Stonington made repeated promises to the\r\n  Hollises and Robinsons that it would fix the problems caused by its\r\n  development, but failed to take any meaningful steps to fulfill those promises.Â \r\n  As a particular example of its deceitful conduct, Stonington told them it would\r\n  provide a conservation easement so that they would have a fifty-foot buffer of\r\n  trees to protect their property from runoff.Â  Stonington then clearcut the\r\n  trees, leaving itself with a tax deduction of $1 million and the Hollises and\r\n  Robinsons with no protection from stormwater runoff.Â  \r\nConsidering the entire\r\n  record in this case in light of the five factors discussed above, we find that\r\n  Stonington's misconduct was moderately reprehensible.\r\n\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;Disparity Between Actual or Potential Harm and the Punitive\r\n  Damages Award\r\nThe ratio of punitive\r\n  damages awarded by the jury in this case to actual damages is 8.75 to 1.[7]Â \r\n  We find this to be an excessive disparity between the punitive damages awarded\r\n  and the harm actually suffered by the Hollises and Robinsons.[8]Â \r\n  In making this determination, and in setting the amount to which punitive\r\n  damages must be reduced, we have considered &quot;the likelihood that the award\r\n  will deter the defendant from like conduct; whether the award is reasonably\r\n  related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; and the defendant's\r\n  ability to pay.&quot;Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 588, 686 S.E.2d at 185.Â  \r\nWe note initially that\r\n  the parties have given us little information to use in evaluating the first and\r\n  third considerations.Â  As to the first consideration, deterrence, the record\r\n  does not clearly indicate whether Stonington is an ongoing entity in the development\r\n  business or whether it was created solely for this one project.Â  Therefore, it\r\n  is difficult to analyze the deterrent effect the punitive damages award will\r\n  have on Stonington.Â  The record indicates that Stonington still owns large\r\n  tracts of undeveloped land in the subdivision and is developing the subdivision\r\n  in phases. Â Thus, the jury's award will likely have a deterrent effect as to\r\n  Stonington's future work on this development.\r\nIn upholding the award,\r\n  the trial court relied on the deterrent effect this award may have on others in\r\n  the development business.Â  In its post-trial order the court stated: &quot;The\r\n  jury's punitive damages award will send a strong message to developers that\r\n  such a way of doing business is not acceptable to the people of Richland\r\n  County.&quot;Â  We significantly discount the importance of this consideration\r\n  in evaluating the constitutionality of the award.Â  The deterrent effect the\r\n  imposition of punitive damages may have on others cannot be used as a\r\n  significant basis for upholding an award of punitive damages.\r\nDeterrence has long been\r\n  an important consideration in the imposition of punitive damages.Â  In Mitchell,\r\n  the supreme court began its discussion of the history of due process\r\n  limitations on punitive damages awards by stating &quot;[t]he practice of\r\n  awarding punitive damages originated in principles of common law 'to deter the\r\n  wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses in the future.'&quot; Â 385\r\n  S.C. at 584, 686 S.E.2d at 183 (quoting Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co.,\r\n  243 S.C. 388, 393, 134 S.E.2d 206, 210 (1964)).Â  Summarizing its decision\r\n  reducing the award of punitive damages in Mitchell, the supreme court\r\n  stated: &quot;We are also certain that a $10 million award will adequately\r\n  vindicate the twin purposes of punishment and deterrence that support the\r\n  imposition of punitive damages.&quot;Â  385 S.C. at 594, 686 S.E.2d at 188.Â  \r\nThe concept of deterrence\r\n  includes the specific effect on the party against whom the award is imposed and\r\n  the general effect the award will have on others similarly situated.Â  In Gamble,\r\n  the supreme court listed as one of the factors a trial court may consider in\r\n  its post-trial review of punitive damages the &quot;likelihood the award will\r\n  deter the defendant or others from like conduct.&quot;Â  305 S.C. at 112,\r\n  406 S.E.2d at 354 (emphasis added).Â  In Mitchell, the supreme court\r\n  stated, &quot;Gamble remains relevant to the post-judgment due process\r\n  analysis,&quot; 385 S.C. at 587, 686 S.E.2d at 185, and repeated the &quot;or\r\n  others&quot; language in its discussion of Gamble.Â  385 S.C. at 586, 686\r\n  S.E.2d at 184.Â  However, listing deterrence as a specific consideration in the\r\n  analysis of the &quot;ratio&quot; guidepost under Gore, the Mitchell court omitted the &quot;or others&quot; language.Â  385 S.C. at 588, 686 S.E.2d\r\n  at 185.Â  \r\nBecause of the trial\r\n  court's consideration of the deterrent effect on other developers to justify\r\n  this punitive damages award, the omission of the &quot;or others&quot; language\r\n  is significant in our review of the trial court's decision.Â  The Mitchell court noted that &quot;much of the [United States] Supreme Court's punitive\r\n  damages jurisprudence has focused on the type of evidence that may be used to\r\n  support a punitive damages award.&quot;Â  385 S.C. at 585-86, 686 S.E.2d at\r\n  184.Â  In support of the point that &quot;the Supreme Court has continued to . .\r\n  . delineate the contours of punitive damages awards that 'run wild,'&quot; the\r\n  court cited Campbell, 538 U.S. at 421-22, for the proposition that\r\n  &quot;punitive damages awards may not be based on out-of-state conduct,&quot; and Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 354 (2007), for the\r\n  proposition that &quot;a punitive damages award that is based on evidence of\r\n  harm to persons other than the plaintiff . . . will violate due process.&quot;Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 586, 686 S.E.2d at 184.Â  Just as these decisions\r\n  have limited the use of harm &quot;to others&quot; as a basis of a punitive\r\n  damages award, we believe there are significant concerns associated with using\r\n  a punitive damages award's deterrent effect &quot;on others&quot; to justify\r\n  the amount of an award.Â  Thus, although the deterrent effect on the specific\r\n  defendant must be considered, the general deterrent effect on others who are\r\n  not connected to the case is not a significant factor in analyzing the\r\n  constitutionality of an award.Â  \r\nThis case, however,\r\n  presents a &quot;deterrence&quot; consideration somewhere in the middle.Â  Stonington's\r\n  only representative to testify at trial described the members of Stonington\r\n  Development, LLC.Â  In particular, the witness's testimony indicates that the managing\r\n  member of Stonington is heavily involved in the development business, not only\r\n  with Stonington, but with several other corporate entities doing development\r\n  work in the area.Â  In considering the deterrent effect the punitive damages\r\n  award will have on Stonington, we find it appropriate to consider the fact that\r\n  its managing member is independently involved in the development business, and the\r\n  punitive damages award is highly likely to deter him from similar misconduct in\r\n  the future.Â  \r\nThe second consideration\r\n  is &quot;whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result\r\n  from such conduct.&quot; Â Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 588, 686 S.E.2d at 185.Â \r\n  In making this comparison, we note that the award of actual damages was\r\n  substantial.Â  Both our supreme court and the United States Supreme Court have\r\n  stated that when the actual damages awarded are substantial, &quot;'a lesser\r\n  ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outer limits\r\n  of the due process guarantee.'&quot;Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 592, 686\r\n  S.E.2d at 187 (quoting Campbell, 538 U.S. at 425).Â  The fact that the\r\n  actual damages award in this case is substantial helps us to evaluate whether\r\n  the punitive damages award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result\r\n  from similar conduct.Â  We find the award of $3.5 million is not reasonably\r\n  related to the likely harm.Â  \r\nWe must also consider\r\n  whether the amount to which we reduce the award is reasonably related to the\r\n  likely harm.Â  While a $2 million award results in a ratio of 5 to 1, considerably\r\n  higher than the actual damages, such an award is reasonably related to the harm\r\n  likely to result from ignoring stormwater management regulations on large\r\n  residential development projects such as the subdivision created by Stonington.\r\nAs to the third\r\n  consideration, other than evidence that Stonington still owns large portions of\r\n  the original development, the record contains no direct evidence of\r\n  Stonington's ability to pay a punitive damages award.Â  \r\n\r\nc.&nbsp; Comparative Penalty Awards\r\nThe third guidepost is\r\n  &quot;the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the\r\n  civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.&quot;Â  Austin,\r\n  387 S.C. at 52, 691 S.E.2d at 151.Â  There are two civil penalties that could be\r\n  applied to Stonington's misconduct.Â  First, the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Health and Environmental Control, other State agencies regulating stormwater,\r\n  and even local governments may impose a civil penalty of $1,000.00 a day\r\n  against any person violating the &quot;Standards for Stormwater Management and\r\n  Sediment Reduction&quot; contained in Chapter 72 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Regulations.Â  26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 72-315(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  The regulation\r\n  provides the penalty may be imposed for any violation of a stormwater\r\n  management or sediment control ordinance or regulation, and it specifically\r\n  allows a separate penalty for each day the violation continues.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  record indicates that Stonington was required on June 4, 2001, to construct a\r\n  detention pond and had not yet adequately constructed it by January 30, 2004.Â \r\n  Stonington was first officially notified it was in violation of stormwater\r\n  management or sediment control regulations on November 6, 2002, and it received\r\n  numerous additional violation notices related to the detention pond and other\r\n  aspects of its stormwater management responsibilities between then and March\r\n  15, 2006.[9]Â \r\n  While the record does not allow a precise calculation of the total number of\r\n  days Stonington remained in violation, we have determined it to be a minimum of\r\n  857 days.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Hollises and\r\n  Robinsons, however, Stonington had not cured the violations as of the jury's\r\n  verdict on April 6, 2007, which is 1,612 days from November 6, 2002.Â  Thus, the\r\n  maximum daily fine that could have been imposed on Stonington ranged from\r\n  $857,000.00 to $1.612 million. \r\nUnder federal law, the\r\n  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may seek a civil penalty\r\n  of up to $25,000.00 per day for misconduct similar to that engaged in by\r\n  Stonington.Â  33 U.S.C. Â§ 1319(d) (Supp. 2010).Â  Applicable federal regulations\r\n  require that sediment and erosion controls must &quot;[a]t a minimum . . . be\r\n  designed, installed, and maintained to: . . . (2) Control stormwater discharges\r\n  . . . to minimize downstream channel and streambank erosion; . . . (5) Minimize\r\n  sediment discharges from the site. . . . ; (6) Provide and maintain natural\r\n  buffers around surface waters . . . .&quot;Â  40 C.F.R. Â§ 450.21(a)(2), (5)-(6)\r\n  (2010).Â  Stonington's violations of these regulations could have resulted in a\r\n  total penalty that far exceeds the punitive damages figures we are considering\r\n  in this case.Â  \r\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court's Role in Reducing the Amount of Punitive Damages\r\nBecause we find the award\r\n  of $3.5 million in punitive damages is excessive and violates due process, we must\r\n  reduce the award.[10]Â \r\n  In reducing the amount of the punitive damages, we are not permitted to make\r\n  the determination independent of the jury of what we think the appropriate\r\n  amount of punitive damages should be in this case.Â  Rather, in deference to the\r\n  jury, we may do no more than determine the upper limit of the range of punitive\r\n  damages awards consistent with due process on the facts of this case, and set\r\n  the amount of punitive damages accordingly. Â See Mitchell, 385 S.C.\r\n  at 590-94, 686 S.E.2d at 187-88 (reducing punitive damages award to the upper\r\n  limit of due process).[11]\r\nAdditionally, Mitchell's holding that appellate courts must conduct the review of\r\n  punitive damages awards de novo is consistent with this deferential approach.Â \r\n  We do not conduct a de novo review of the jury's determination of the proper\r\n  amount to award as punitive damages.Â  Rather, we use &quot;a de novo standard\r\n  for the review of trial court determinations of the constitutionality of\r\n  punitive damages awards.&quot;Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 583, 686\r\n  S.E.2d at 182; see also Austin, 387 S.C. at 52, 691 S.E.2d at 151\r\n  (&quot;[A]n appellate court reviews de novo the trial judge's application of\r\n  these guideposts.&quot;).Â  This entitles us only to review the determination of\r\n  the constitutionality of the award.Â  Both the plaintiffs and the defendant have\r\n  a federal and state constitutional right to a trial by jury on the question of\r\n  punitive damages.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. VII; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14; see also Defender Indus. Inc. v.\r\n    Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., 938 F.2d\r\n  502, 507 (4th Cir. 1991) (&quot;[W]e hold that the seventh amendment guarantees\r\n  the right to a jury determination of the amount of punitive damages . . . .&quot;).Â  We may not usurp the jury's function and set the amount we believe to be\r\n  appropriate.Â  If we find the jury's award unconstitutionally excessive, we may\r\n  reduce it only to the upper limit of what would be acceptable under due\r\n  process.Â  \r\ne.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion as to the Amount of Punitive Damages\r\nTherefore, reviewing de\r\n  novo the trial court's determination of constitutionality, but deferring to the\r\n  jury's constitutional role as factfinder, we find the upper limit of the range\r\n  of punitive damages awards consistent with due process on the facts of this\r\n  case to be $2 million, and we reduce the award accordingly.Â  \r\n\r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Grant Stonington's Motions for JNOV, New Trial\r\n  Absolute, or New Trial Nisi Remittitur\r\nFinally, Stonington appeals\r\n  the denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new\r\n  trial based on the trial judge entering the jury room to answer a juror's\r\n  question. Â We find this issue unpreserved for our review.\r\nAt one point during a witness's\r\n  testimony, the judge interrupted and said to a juror, &quot;You need a\r\n  break?&quot; to which the juror responded, &quot;Is it possible for me to get a\r\n  pen and a piece of paper?Â  I have a question for you.&quot;Â  The judge\r\n  instructed everyone to &quot;Stop&quot; and said to the jury, &quot;Go to the\r\n  jury room.Â  If you have a question, as the Forelady and members of the jury,\r\n  write it down for me.Â  I'll take a look at it.&quot;Â  After the break, the\r\n  judge explained on the record:\r\n\r\n  I\r\n    spoke to the jury in the room.Â  The note that the Forelady wrote me was: Can\r\n    jurors ask questions?Â  And I think I was polite about it, the answer was, no,\r\n    of course.Â  And of course that's the job of the lawyers as I explained to y'all\r\n    in the jury room.\r\n\r\nStonington's counsel\r\n  neither objected nor asked for any clarification as to the conversation between\r\n  the judge and the jurors.Â  \r\n&quot;[I]t is the\r\n  responsibility of trial counsel to preserve issues for appellate review.&quot;Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997).Â  &quot;[A]n\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved.&quot;Â  RRR, Inc. v.\r\n    Toggas, 378 S.C. 174, 185, 662 S.E.2d 438, 443 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nWe recognize that our\r\n  supreme court has held a trial judge entering the jury room is reversible\r\n  error.Â  State v. Elmore, 279 S.C. 417, 421-22, 308 S.E.2d 781, 784-85 (1983)\r\n  (&quot;Although we find no actual prejudice in\r\n  this instance, we hold this conduct to be reversible error regardless of the\r\n  presence of counsel.&quot;).Â  However, Elmore is not controlling in a civil case.Â  The ruling in Elmore was based in\r\n  part on the right of a criminal defendant to &quot;be present at all stages of\r\n  a trial.&quot;Â  279 S.C. at 422, 308 S.E.2d at 785.Â \r\n  Further, Elmore was a death penalty case decided before the supreme\r\n  court abrogated in favorem vitae in State v. Torrence, 305 S.C.\r\n  45, 60, 406 S.E.2d 315, 324 (1991) (Toal, J., concurring).Â  We make no comment\r\n  on the continued viability of this holding from Elmore in death penalty or\r\n  other criminal cases.Â  However, such an exception to the rules of issue\r\n  preservation is not warranted on the facts of this civil case.Â  \r\nAs to the remainder of\r\n  Stonington's allegations that the trial court erred in refusing to grant its\r\n  post-trial motions for JNOV, new trial absolute, or new trial nisi remittitur,\r\n  we deem them abandoned and decline to address the merits.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (stating each &quot;particular issue to be addressed shall\r\n  be set forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations of\r\n  authority&quot;); Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578,\r\n  599, 635 S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding appellants abandoned an issue\r\n  on appeal where they failed to cite any case law for a proposition and made\r\n  only conclusory arguments in support).Â  \r\nVII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nWe affirm the denial of a\r\n  directed verdict on punitive damages, the jury charge on punitive damages, and\r\n  the denial of Stonington's post-trial motions.Â  We also affirm the imposition\r\n  of punitive damages, but because we find the amount excessive, in violation of\r\n  due process, we reduce the award from $3.5 million to $2 million.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTHOMAS and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stonington is a nongovernmental entity with no power to condemn private\r\n  property.\r\n[2] The Hollises and Robinsons also sued Ecological Associates, Inc., Newman\r\n  Construction, Inc., and C.G.D. Developers, Inc.Â  They settled with these\r\n  defendants for a total of $85,000.00 and proceeded to trial against only\r\n  Stonington and Power Engineering.Â  \r\n[3] This includes the cost of obtaining necessary permits, removing the silt,\r\n  restoring the dam, and restocking the fish.Â  \r\n[4] The trial judge granted a directed verdict in favor of Stonington on the unfair\r\n  trade practices cause of action.Â  \r\n[5] The jury found neither actual nor punitive damages against Power Engineering, refuting\r\n  Stonington's argument that the charge required the jury to find actual and\r\n  punitive damages &quot;as to both Defendants.&quot;Â  \r\n[6] We mention that the conduct lasted over four years in recognition of the\r\n  supreme court's statement that it is no longer necessary to consider the\r\n  duration of the conduct as a separate factor.Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 587\r\n  n.7, 686 S.E.2d at 185 n.7.Â  In this case, however, the duration of the conduct\r\n  helps us to understand whether the conduct was an isolated incident or involved\r\n  repeated actions.Â  See 385 S.C. at 589, 686 S.E.2d at 186 (noting in\r\n  considering this fourth factor that &quot;Fortis's conduct involved repeated\r\n  acts of deliberate indifference for more than two years&quot;).\r\n[7] In calculating the ratios in this case, we have used actual damages of\r\n  $400,000.00 rather than the actual damages judgment amount of $315,000.00.\r\n[8] This is not a case in which it is appropriate to consider potential harm over\r\n  and above the actual harm suffered by the plaintiff.Â  See Mitchell,\r\n  385 S.C. at 590, 686 S.E.2d at 187 (&quot;[I]n certain cases [a court] may\r\n  compare [the punitive damages award] to the potential harm suffered by\r\n  the plaintiff.&quot;).Â  \r\n[9] Stonington received official violation notices on November 6, 2002, April 18,\r\n  2003, October 13, 2003, January 30, 2004, December 28, 2004, January 26, 2005,\r\n  February 8, 2006, and March 15, 2006.Â  \r\n[10] We have the option of ordering a new trial.Â  See EEOC v. Fed. Express\r\n  Corp., 513 F.3d 360, 376 (4th Cir. 2008) (&quot;If a punitive damages award\r\n  is unconstitutionally excessive, it is our obligation to order a remittitur or\r\n  award a new trial.&quot;).Â  However, after finding the award to be excessive, South\r\n  Carolina appellate courts have uniformly reduced the punitive damages award\r\n  over the option of ordering a new trial.Â  But see Atkinson v. Orkin\r\n    Exterminating Co., 361 S.C. 156, 166, 604 S.E.2d 385, 390 (2005) (reversing\r\n  and remanding punitive damages because the trial court improperly admitted\r\n  prejudicial evidence).Â  In Mitchell, the supreme court implicitly\r\n  rejected the option of a new trial.Â  After finding the award &quot;exceeds due\r\n  process limits,&quot; the court stated: &quot;There is ample evidence in the\r\n  record to support the imposition of punitive damages, and there is no need for\r\n  further findings of fact.&quot;Â  385 S.C. at 592, 686 S.E.2d at 187.Â  We have\r\n  noted some considerations as to which the record gives us little or no information.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, as the supreme court did in Mitchell, we find the record\r\n  here is adequate for us to conduct our review of the award, and we find no\r\n  reason to remand for a new trial.\r\n[11] See also CBG Occupational Therapy, Inc. v.

Emory Smith, Jr., of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLOCKEMY,\r\n  J.: In this action to declare title\r\n  to tidelands, Peter D. Grant, Trustee, (Grant) argues the trial court erred in\r\n  concluding he failed to rebut the State of South Carolina's presumptive title\r\n  to the tidelands adjacent to his property.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGrant initiated this action\r\n  against the State of South Carolina pursuant to section 48-39-220 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2008) to determine ownership of the tidelands[1] adjacent to his property.Â  Grant's property, known as The Fort, is 3 acres of\r\n  highland on the northwest side of the island of Folly Beach.Â  Grant's property\r\n  is bordered by approximately 9 acres of saltwater marsh.Â  Grant claimed\r\n  ownership of the marshland based upon a 1696 grant abstract and a 1786 surplus grant\r\n  and plat.Â  The State asserted it held prima facie fee simple title to the marshland\r\n  in the public trust.Â  After a bench trial, the trial court determined Grant\r\n  failed to overcome the State's presumptive ownership and found the State held\r\n  title to the marshland.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nDid the trial court err in\r\n  determining Grant failed to rebut the State's presumptive ownership of the marshland\r\n  adjacent to his property?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to determine\r\n  ownership of tidelands pursuant to section 48-39-220 is an action at law.Â  See Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C. 407, 410, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2006).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, our scope of review extends\r\n  to the correction of errors of law.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad.,\r\n    Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  Furthermore, &quot;the trial court's factual findings will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which\r\n  reasonably supports the [court's] findings.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State of South Carolina\r\n  holds presumptive title to all land below the high water mark in trust for the\r\n  benefit of its citizens.Â  McQueen v. S.C. Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142,\r\n  149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119&nbsp;(2003).Â  To rebut the State's presumptive title,\r\n  a claimant must show (1) its predecessor in title possessed a valid grant, and\r\n  (2) the grant's language was sufficient to convey land below the high water\r\n  mark.Â  Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State, 347 S.C. 96, 103, 552 S.E.2d\r\n  778, 782&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001); State v. Holston Land Co., 272 S.C. 65,\r\n  66, 248 S.E.2d 922, 923&nbsp;(1978).Â  \r\nBecause the State is presumed\r\n  to hold title to tidelands in trust for the benefit of the public, a grant of\r\n  private ownership must contain specific language in the grant or on the plat\r\n  demonstrating an intent to convey land below the high water mark.Â  Hobonny\r\n    Club, Inc. v. McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 396, 252 S.E.2d 133,\r\n  135&nbsp;(1979).Â  A grant which names a navigable tidal stream as a boundary\r\n  conveys land to the ordinary high water mark.Â  Â State v. Pinckney, 22\r\n  S.C. 484, 492 (1885).Â  Title to land between the high and low water marks\r\n  remains in the State and is held in trust for the benefit of the public.Â  State\r\n    v. Hardee, 259 S.C. 535, 539, 193 S.E.2d 497, 499&nbsp;(1972).Â  A grant of\r\n  tidelands by the State or a predecessor sovereign is construed strictly in\r\n  favor of the State and the general public and against the grantee.Â  Id.\r\nThere is no dispute regarding\r\n  the validity of Grant's chain of title.Â  Thus, the issue before us is whether\r\n  the grants and plat at issue are sufficient to convey land below the high water\r\n  mark.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1696 Grant\r\nGrant argues the trial court\r\n  erred in determining the 1696 grant did not convey the whole of Folly Island\r\n  including the adjacent tidelands.Â  We disagree.\r\nGrant established a chain of\r\n  title to a 1696 grant of Folly Island from the Lords Proprietors to William\r\n  Rivers.Â  The original grant and plat are not known to exist and the record\r\n  contains only the grant abstract which states:\r\n\r\n  William\r\n    Rivers had a grant out of the Secretary's Office for Seven Hundred Acres of\r\n    Land or thereabouts which said Land in Situate in Berkeley County known by the\r\n    name of Folly Island which butts and bounds Southeasterly on the Sea, Northwesterly\r\n    on marsh and back of the Sound on South side of James, Northwesterly on a creek\r\n    that comes out of the South Channel of Ashley River.\r\n\r\nThe grant abstract names only\r\n  tidal navigable water ways as boundaries and contains no language indicating an\r\n  intent to convey land below the high water mark.Â  In fact, the only mention of\r\n  tidelands is the use of word &quot;marsh&quot; to delineate the northwest\r\n  boundary of the property conveyed: &quot;butts and bounds . . . Northwesterly\r\n  on marsh.&quot;Â  Black's Law Dictionary 1080 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\r\n  &quot;butts and bounds&quot; as the territorial limit of real property, or in\r\n  other words a boundary line).Â  Such language is insufficient to convey land\r\n  below the high water mark.Â  Â Â \r\nGrant submits that under\r\n  English common law in 1696, the grant of an island conveyed the entire island\r\n  including the adjacent tidelands.[2]Â \r\n  We find Grant's contention without merit.Â  In Shively v. Bowlby the\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States noted:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    England, from the time of Lord Hale, it has been treated as settled that the\r\n    title in the soil of the sea, or of arms of the sea, below ordinary high-water\r\n    mark, is in the king, except so far as an individual or a corporation has\r\n    acquired rights in it by express grant, or by prescription or usage . . . and\r\n    that this title, jus privatum, whether in the king or in a subject, is held\r\n    subject to the public right, jus publicum, of navigation and fishing . . . .\r\n  It is equally well settled that a grant from the sovereign of land bounded by the\r\n    sea, or by any navigable tide water, does not pass any title below high-water\r\n    mark, unless either the language of the grant, or long usage under it, clearly\r\n    indicates that such was the intention. \r\n\r\n152 U.S. 1, 13 (1894) (citations omitted).Â  These rules were applied in South\r\n    Carolina for the first time in State v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C. 50\r\n    (1884).Â  There, the State sought to enjoin the Pacific Guano Company from\r\n    mining phosphate from several tidal creek beds near Beaufort.Â  Id. at\r\n    52.Â  In determining the State held title to the creek beds at issue, the court\r\n    noted: &quot;'It is a settled principle of the English law that the right of\r\n    owners of land bounded by the sea or on navigable rivers where the tide ebbs\r\n    and flows, extends to high water mark; and the shore below common, but not\r\n    extraordinary high water mark, belongs to the public.'&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n    79-80.Â  The Pacific Guano court also noted the unique character of the\r\n  State's title to tidelands:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    state had in the beds of these tidal channels not only title as property, the jus\r\n      privatum, but something more, the jus publicum, consisting of the\r\n    rights, powers, and privileges derived from the British crown, and belonging to\r\n    the governing head, which she held in a fiduciary capacity for general and\r\n    public use; in trust for the benefit of all the citizens of the state, and in\r\n    respect to which she had trust duties to perform.\r\n\r\nId. at 83-84.Â  Because of the unique character of such\r\n  lands, English common law and South Carolina law developed special rules\r\n  regarding the granting of tidelands.Â  \r\nUnder English common law, a\r\n  grant of tidelands was to be &quot;construed strictly[] and it will not be\r\n  presumed, that the King intended to part from any portion of the public domain,\r\n  unless clear and special words are used to denote it.&quot;Â  Martin\r\n    v. Waddell's Lessee, 41 U.S. 367, 406 (1842) (emphasis added).Â  The Pacific\r\n      Guano court outlined a similar rule:Â  &quot;In all grants [of tidelands]\r\n  from the government to the subject, the terms of the grant are to be taken most\r\n  strongly against the grantee, and in favor of the grantor.&quot;Â  22 S.C. at\r\n  86.Â  Further, pursuant to English common law the upper boundary of tidelands\r\n  was the &quot;ordinary high-water mark.&quot;Â  U.S. v. Pacheco, 69 U.S.\r\n  587, 590 (1864).Â  Thus, when &quot;the sea, or a bay, is named as a boundary,\r\n  the line of ordinary high-water mark is always intended where the common law\r\n  prevails.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The Pacific Guano court noted and applied\r\n  the English common law rule to the creek beds at issue in that case:\r\n  &quot;These are all channels in which the tide ebbs and flows, and as to such\r\n  the well established rule is, that a grant of the shore gives title only to the\r\n  high water mark, the mean between extreme high and low tides.&quot;Â  22 S.C. at\r\n  79.Â  \r\nGrant's argument that Trapier\r\n  v. Wilson, 13 S.C.L. (2 McCord) 191 (1822) stands for the proposition that\r\n  a grant of an island included the adjacent tidelands is misplaced.Â  Our supreme\r\n  court addressed Trapier in State v. Pinckney, 22 S.C. 484\r\n  (1885).Â  After discussing the rules outlined above, the Pinckney court\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  By his\r\n    great industry, the counsel for the defendants found and cited the case of Trapier\r\n      v. Wilson (2 McCord, 191), which he urged had changed the rule[s regarding\r\n    grants of tidelands]. That was a contest between John T. Wilson and Paul\r\n    Trapier as to whether there was any vacant land on &quot;'North Island'â€”meaning\r\n    vacant highlands. The case itself states that &quot;the question was whether\r\n    the grant to Laroche (under which Mr. Trapier claimed) covered the whole of the\r\n    island except the salt water marsh, or was it to be located according to the\r\n    courses and distances set forth in the plat?&quot; It was a simple question of\r\n    location, the only point being whether the grant covered the upland of the\r\n    whole island. It was held that the whole island was covered by the grant, and\r\n    from this it is sought to draw an inference that the court held the doctrine\r\n    that Trapier, as riparian proprietor, had title down to low-water mark. We\r\n    cannot perceive that any such decision was involved in the case. The doctrine\r\n    we are considering was not broached, and neither the common law rule nor the\r\n    words &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low-water&quot; mark were referred to in the\r\n    opinion. Judge Richardson, in delivering the judgment, again excepts the\r\n    marshes. He says: &quot;By the description set forth in the grant, the location\r\n    is plain and unquestionable. The whole island (unless the marsh be so called)\r\n    is clearly within it.&quot; It seems that in those days, before the discovery\r\n    of phosphates, salt marsh went for nothing.\r\n\r\n22 S.C. at 508.Â  In sum, we\r\n  find no merit to Grant's contention English common law provided that a grant of\r\n  an island included the adjacent tidelands.Â  Because the 1696 grant abstract\r\n  lacks any indication of an intent to convey land below the high water mark, we\r\n  find the trial court's determination Grant failed to rebut the State's\r\n  presumptive title is supported by evidence in the record.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1786 Grant and Plat\r\nGrant argues the trial court\r\n  erred in determining the 1786 surplus grant did not convey the tidelands at\r\n  issue.Â  We disagree.\r\nIncluded\r\n  in Grant's chain of title is a 1786 surplus grant from the State of South\r\n  Carolina to Martha Samways.Â  The grant states:\r\n\r\n  We have\r\n    granted, and by these Presents do grant unto the said Martha Samways her Heirs\r\n    and Assigns, a Plantation or Tract of Land containing one thousand nine hundred\r\n    forty acres being the surplus contained in grant for the Folly Island heretofore\r\n    granted to William Rivers on the 9th of September 1696 for seven hundred acres\r\n    or thereabouts but upon a Resurvey found to contain within the lines of the\r\n    same two thousand six hundred and forty having such shape, form, and marks, as\r\n    are represented by a plat hereunto annexed, together with all woods, trees,\r\n    waters, watercourses, profits, commodities, appurtenances, and hereditaments,\r\n    whatsoever thereunto belonging; To have and to hold Said Tract of one thousand\r\n    nine hundred and forty Acres of Land, and all and singular other the premises\r\n    hereby granted unto the said Martha Samways her Heirs and Assigns for ever, in\r\n    free and common Soccage.\r\n\r\nThe grant also states Martha\r\n  Samways paid forty-five pounds sterling for the surplus acreage.Â  The surplus\r\n  grant is accompanied by a hand drawn plat which describes the land surveyed as\r\n\r\n  an\r\n    Island, situate in the District of Charleston, Granted to William Rivers the\r\n    9th September 1696 for the Folly Island, for Seven hundred acres, or\r\n    thereabouts, but upon the said resurvey found to contain, within the lines of\r\n    the same, two thousand, six hundred and forty acres, nineteen hundred and forty\r\n    acres thereof being surplus, and hath such form, mark, buttings and boundings\r\n    as the above plat represents.\r\n\r\nThe plat includes a drawing\r\n  of Folly Island displaying the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Folly River\r\n  to the northwest, Bird Keys to the southwest, and Lighthouse Island to the\r\n  northeast.Â  The drawing also depicts marshland on the northwest side of Folly\r\n  Island with a stippled pattern.Â  Folly Island and the marshland are\r\n  circumscribed by a line. Â The 1786 surplus grant and plat include no additional\r\n  boundary description and instead refer to the 1696 grant.\r\nDr. Charles Lesser, a\r\n  historian and archivist with the South Carolina Department of Archives and\r\n  History, testified surplus grants were used to convey additional land\r\n  discovered to be within the boundaries of a prior grant upon a resurvey.Â  According\r\n  to Lesser, when a resurvey revealed more land existed within the boundaries of\r\n  a grant than previously estimated, the owner could pay for the additional land\r\n  and be granted the surplus. \r\nHere, the 1696 grant abstract\r\n  indicates the 1696 grant conveyed 700 acres &quot;or thereabouts&quot; known as\r\n  Folly Island.Â  The 1786 surplus grant and plat state Folly Island was\r\n  resurveyed and determined to be 2,640 acres.Â  The 1786 surplus grant conveyed the\r\n  difference between the 700 acres granted in the 1696 grant and the 2,640 acres\r\n  discovered by the resurvey.Â  In other words, the 1786 surplus grant conveyed\r\n  the 1,940 acres found to be within the lines of the 1696 grant upon a resurvey.Â \r\n  By definition the 1786 surplus grant could not convey land outside the boundaries\r\n  of the 1696 grant.Â  See Thomson v. Gaillard, 37 S.C.L. (3 Rich.)\r\n  418, 421 (1832) (defining a surplus grant as a &quot;grant within the lines of\r\n  an elder one&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we conclude the trial court's determination\r\n  that the 1786 surplus grant conveys only the extra acreage discovered within\r\n  the boundaries of the 1696 grant is reasonably supported by the evidence in the\r\n  record. [3]Â  \r\nAssuming the 1786 surplus\r\n  grant and plat could convey additional acreage outside the boundaries of the\r\n  1696 grant, nothing in either the grant or the plat indicates an intent to\r\n  convey tidelands.Â  In fact, the stated acreage in the grant and the high land acreage\r\n  depicted on the plat indicate the opposite.Â  The 1786 surplus grant states the\r\n  land conveyed in the 1696 grant was resurveyed and found to be 2,640 acres.Â  The\r\n  State presented the expert testimony of surveyor Frederick Quinn who calculated\r\n  the high ground acreage depicted on the 1786 plat using two methods: a computer\r\n  scan and a planimeter.Â  Quinn's computer scan calculation indicated the high\r\n  ground was 2,596 acres, while the planimeter calculation indicated the high\r\n  ground was 2,610 acres.Â  Grant's expert surveyor, Thomas Bessent, also\r\n  calculated the high ground acreage and determined it was approximately 2,614\r\n  acres.Â  Bessent explained his figures agreed with Quinn's &quot;very\r\n  closely&quot; and were &quot;well within expected tolerance.&quot;Â  The high\r\n  degree of similarity between the acreage stated in the grant and the acreage of\r\n  high ground depicted on the plat indicate an intent to convey only the high\r\n  ground. \r\nGrant argues the line\r\n  circumscribing Folly Island and encompassing the tidelands at issue on the 1786\r\n  plat evidences an intent to convey the tidelands at issue.Â  Strictly construing\r\n  the grant and plat in the State's favor, more is required.\r\nIn State v. Holston Land\r\n  Co., our supreme court found the plat at issue evinced an intent to convey\r\n  land below the high water mark.Â  272 S.C. 65, 68, 248 S.E.2d 922,\r\n  924&nbsp;(1978).Â  There, the plat's legend indicated the property conveyed was\r\n  a 200 acre tract of marshland.Â  Id. at 67, 248 S.E.2d at 923.Â  The plat\r\n  depicted the marsh with a stippled pattern across which was written &quot;two\r\n  hundred acres marsh[]land.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The plat also included several\r\n  small islands and adjacent marsh with an accompanying legend stating &quot;all\r\n  pieces of marsh that[ are] commonly covered at high water.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  67, 248 S.E.2d at 924.Â  In Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State, this\r\n  court found a grant and plat were sufficient to convey land below the high\r\n  water mark where the plat contained a surveyor's note which indicated a 1,102 acre\r\n  tract of marshland was surveyed and the drawing of the tract included the word &quot;marsh&quot;\r\n  on its face in two locations. Â 347 S.C. 96, 104-05, 552 S.E.2d 778,\r\n  782-83&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  Finally, in Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern our supreme court found two &quot;exceptional&quot; plats were sufficient to\r\n  convey the tidelands at issue.Â  272 S.C. 392, 398, 252 S.E.2d 133, 136-37&nbsp;(1979).Â \r\n  The court described the plats as follows: \r\n\r\n  They\r\n    are not mere maps on which boundary waterways are drawn in free-hand to represent\r\n    directions and conformations of boundaries. These plats are carefully scaled\r\n    and platted so as to delineate the boundaries of the tracts granted with\r\n    mathematical precision. It is undisputed that the boundaries are accurately\r\n    relocatable on the ground by contemporary engineering methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 398, 252 S.E.2d at 136.Â  Because the plats were drawn with such a\r\n  high degree of precision and encompassed tidelands, the court found the grant\r\n  and plats were sufficient to convey the tidelands. Id. at 398, 252\r\n  S.E.2d at 137.Â  Although the plat at issue here depicts tidelands, it lacks the\r\n  other indicators of intent to grant land below the high water mark present in Holston and Lowcountry Open Land Trust.Â  Additionally, in contrast to the plats\r\n  in Hobonny Club, Grant's expert land surveyor, Bessent, testified the\r\n  1786 plat is poorly drawn and not capable of being relocated on the ground.\r\nFinally, this court has\r\n  previously determined a copy of the 1786 surplus grant and plat at issue in\r\n  this case lacked the requisite intent to convey tidelands.Â  In Query v.\r\n    Burgess, Query brought suit against his neighbor Burgess and the State to\r\n  determine title to tidelands adjacent to his property and Query's property on\r\n  Folly Beach.Â  371 S.C. 407, 409-10, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â \r\n  The master examined a copy of the 1786 surplus grant and plat at issue here[4] and determined they lacked evidence of the State's intent to grant tidelands\r\n  and concluded the State held title to the marsh.Â  Id. at 412, 639 S.E.2d\r\n  at 457.Â  Query appealed.Â  Id. at 410, 639 S.E.2d at 456.Â  On review,\r\n  this court noted &quot;[t]he plat roughly delineates Folly Island . . . ,\r\n  contains the bare bones of a survey[,] and is neither precise nor\r\n  detailed.&quot;Â  Id. at 412, 639 S.E.2d at 457.Â  This court also noted\r\n  the 1786 surplus grant and plat lacked any terms consistent with the intent to\r\n  grant property below the high water mark and affirmed the master's finding.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  conclude the trial court's determination the 1786 surplus grant and plat lacked\r\n  evidence of the requisite intent to convey tidelands is supported by evidence\r\n  in the record. \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant's Remaining Issues\r\nGrant argues the trial court\r\n  erred in relying on Query v. Burgess.Â  We find no improper reliance on Query and therefore decline to address the issue.Â  See Rule 220(b)(2)\r\n  (providing &quot;[t]he [this court] need not address a point which is manifestly without merit.&quot;).Â  Grant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in adopting the State's revised proposed order\r\n  without allowing him an opportunity to respond.Â  We find this issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C.\r\n  71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733&nbsp;(1998) (&quot;[A]n issue cannot be raised for\r\n  the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the\r\n  decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J. and PIEPER,\r\n  J. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 48-39-220 defines tidelands as &quot;all\r\n  lands except beaches in the Coastal zone between the mean high-water mark and\r\n  the mean low-water mark of navigable waters without regard to the degree of\r\n  salinity of such waters.&quot;\r\n[2] In support of this contention Grant introduced expert\r\n  testimony from Professor William Cook and the publication Marsh Granting\r\n    Practices in South Carolina for the purpose of &quot;interpretation of\r\n  grants and plats and titles.&quot;Â  Although the trial court allowed Grant to\r\n  offer this evidence during the bench trial, the court ultimately excluded the\r\n  evidence.Â  Grant has not appealed this ruling; therefore it is law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Hous. Corp., 338 S.C. 171,\r\n  174-75, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871&nbsp;(2000) (noting an unchallenged ruling is law\r\n  of the case).\r\n[3] Grant argues the 1786 surplus grant and plat conveyed\r\n  vacant lands, which included the tidelands at issue, pursuant to the Act of\r\n  1784, 4 Stat. 627, No. 1206.Â  Grant draws support for this assertion from the\r\n  45 pounds Martha Samways paid for the 1,940 acres conveyed by the 1786 surplus\r\n  grant.Â  However, the Act expressly states vacant lands are to be sold for the\r\n  sum of 10 pounds per 100 acres.Â  If the 1,940 acres conveyed in the 1786\r\n  surplus grant was for vacant land, Martha Samways would have paid 194 pounds.Â  Thus,\r\n  Grant's argument in this regard is without merit.\r\n[4] The copy of the 1786 surplus grant and plat used in Query are substantively similar to the ones at issue here save one exception.Â  The\r\n  copy used in Query included a line dividing the marshland from the high\r\n  ground in addition to the line circumscribing the high ground and the\r\n  marshland.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4871","title":"State v.

Â \r\nAfter observing the Jeep and\r\n  its occupants, Lutz parked nearby in order to continue observation of the parking\r\n  lot and the Jeep and its occupants.Â  A few minutes later, Burgess entered the\r\n  parking lot in a white car, backed up, and parked her car askew in a parking\r\n  space a few feet from Lutz's location.Â  The Jeep proceeded toward Burgess's location,\r\n  waited for her to park, and pulled along the passenger side of her vehicle.Â  The\r\n  passenger in the Jeep got out and entered the back passenger seat of Burgess's\r\n  vehicle while extending his hand toward Burgess.Â  Lutz observed Burgess look\r\n  over her shoulder while the passenger in Burgess's car looked down towards\r\n  Burgess's lap.Â  After approximately fifteen seconds, the passenger from the\r\n  Jeep exited Burgess's car and returned to the Jeep.Â  Lutz explained the\r\n  complaints of drug activity in the parking lot, his training and experience,\r\n  and his &quot;prior knowledge of people doing the exact same thing&quot; led\r\n  him to conclude he had observed a drug transaction. \r\nBurgess and the Jeep exited\r\n  the Hardee's parking lot traveling west on Rosewood Drive.Â  Lutz followed both\r\n  vehicles but soon after, the Jeep turned off of Rosewood Drive.[1]Â \r\n  Lutz chose to follow Burgess's car because the fact that she arrived at the\r\n  Hardee's parking lot second led him to believe she was the supplier.Â  Burgess\r\n  turned onto South Maple Street and after a short distance entered a driveway.Â  Lutz\r\n  pulled in behind Burgess and initiated his blue lights.Â  Burgess and the\r\n  passenger quickly exited the vehicle, and Lutz observed a small black bag in\r\n  Burgess's left hand.Â  Lutz instructed Burgess and the passenger to reenter the\r\n  vehicle.Â  Lutz explained as Burgess sat down in the driver's seat she leaned\r\n  over to her left &quot;like she was trying to put something up under the left\r\n  side of the car.&quot;Â  Lutz instructed Burgess to stand up and keep her hands\r\n  visible.Â  As Burgess stood up she made a kicking motion with her right leg\r\n  &quot;like she was trying to kick an object under the vehicle.&quot;Â  Lutz\r\n  discovered a black bag containing several types of drugs on the driveway below\r\n  the driver's seat.[2]Â \r\n  Lutz arrested Burgess and the passenger.\r\nBurgess was indicted for trafficking\r\n  in crack cocaine, PWID marijuana, PWID cocaine, and PWID ecstasy.Â  Prior to the\r\n  bench trial,[3] Burgess moved to suppress the drug evidence, arguing Lutz lacked reasonable\r\n  suspicion to stop her.Â  The trial court denied Burgess's motion and ultimately found\r\n  Burgess guilty of trafficking crack cocaine, PWID cocaine, and PWID ecstasy.Â  The\r\n  trial court found Burgess not guilty of PWID marijuana, but found her guilty of\r\n  the lesser included offense of possession of marijuana.Â  The trial court\r\n  sentenced Burgess to thirty days for possession of marijuana, and concurrent\r\n  sentences of eight years for the trafficking and PWID charges.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a Fourth\r\n  Amendment search and seizure issue, this court must affirm if there is any\r\n  evidence to support the trial court's ruling and will reverse only where there\r\n  is clear error.Â  State v. Wright, 391 S.C. 436, 442, 706 S.E.2d 324, 326\r\n  (2011); State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661,\r\n  666&nbsp;(2000).Â  In applying this standard of review, we must determine if the\r\n  record supports the trial court's assumed findings, and if those findings\r\n  support the trial court's determination regarding reasonable suspicion or\r\n  probable cause.Â  State v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 523 n.5, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  203, 206 n.5&nbsp;(2010); State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 70, 572\r\n  S.E.2d 456, 460&nbsp;(2002) (applying the any evidence standard of review but\r\n  noting an appellate court may conduct &quot;its own review of the record to\r\n  determine whether the trial judge's decision is supported by the\r\n  evidence&quot;).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBurgess argues the trial\r\n  court erred in determining Lutz had reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop\r\n  of her vehicle.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment of the Constitution\r\n  of the United States prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const.\r\n  amend. IV.Â  Evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be\r\n  excluded from trial.Â  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961).\r\nA vehicle stop constitutes a\r\n  seizure and implicates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable\r\n  searches and seizures.Â  State v. Banda, 371 S.C. 245, 252, 639 S.E.2d\r\n  36, 40&nbsp;(2006); State v. Rogers, 368 S.C. 529, 533, 629 S.E.2d 679,\r\n  681&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  Accordingly, a police officer may stop a vehicle\r\n  when the officer has probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred, State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2001), or when the officer has reasonable suspicion the occupants are involved\r\n  in criminal activity.Â  Knight v. State, 284 S.C. 138, 141, 325 S.E.2d\r\n  535, 537-38 (1985).Â  \r\nGenerally, a police officer\r\n  may stop and briefly detain and question a person for investigative purposes,\r\n  without treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when the officer has a\r\n  reasonable suspicion the person is involved in criminal activity.Â  Terry v.\r\n    Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968).Â  Reasonable suspicion is a specific and\r\n  objective basis, supported by articulable facts, for suspecting another of\r\n  criminal activity.Â  U.S. v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981); Black's\r\n    Law Dictionary 1585 (9th ed. 2009).Â  In determining whether reasonable\r\n  suspicion exists, the totality of the circumstances must be considered.Â  Cortez,\r\n  449 U.S. at 417-18.\r\nInitially, we note that\r\n  Burgess does not challenge the admission of the drug evidence on grounds that\r\n  Lutz exceeded the scope of the Terry stop.Â  See State v.\r\n    Corley, 383 S.C. 232, 241, 679 S.E.2d 187, 192&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009), aff'd as modified, 392 S.C. 125, 708 S.E.2d 217&nbsp;(2011) (&quot;The\r\n  scope and duration of [the stop] must be strictly tied to and justified by the\r\n  circumstances that rendered its initiation proper.&quot;).Â  Instead, Burgess\r\n  maintains Lutz lacked reasonable suspicion to stop her and the drug evidence\r\n  should have been excluded because it was the result of an illegal seizure.Â  Therefore,\r\n  our analysis examines whether Lutz had reasonable suspicion to initiate a Terry stop of Burgess and does not address whether the events that occurred after the\r\n  stop were proper.\r\nWe find the evidence in the\r\n  record supports the trial court's determination that Lutz had reasonable\r\n  suspicion to stop Burgess.Â  At the time Lutz activated his blue lights, Lutz\r\n  was aware the Hardee's parking lot was a known meeting location for drug sales\r\n  and had personal knowledge of frequent complaints of drug activity in the\r\n  parking lot.Â  Lutz observed the Jeep parked at the back of the parking lot.Â \r\n  Its occupants were not eating and appeared to be waiting for someone.Â  Lutz\r\n  observed Burgess enter the parking lot and park haphazardly.Â  The passenger\r\n  from the Jeep entered the rear passenger seat of Burgess's car with his hand\r\n  extended while Burgess looked in his direction.Â  The events in Burgess's car\r\n  lasted fifteen seconds.Â  Lutz explained this activity was suspicious because,\r\n  in his experience with several hundred narcotics investigations, buyers usually\r\n  arrive at a predetermined location to wait on a supplier in order to complete a\r\n  drug transaction.Â  Lutz further explained he had prior knowledge of similar\r\n  drug transactions occurring in the same manner.Â  In short, Lutz had personal\r\n  knowledge of complaints of drug activity at the Hardee's parking lot and observed\r\n  Burgess's behavior in the parking lot, which his training and experience\r\n  informed him was consistent with a drug sale.\r\nBurgess's contention the\r\n  Hardee's parking lot cannot be a known location for drug activity because\r\n  Richland County's online arrest database includes only one drug arrest at the\r\n  Hardee's parking lot is without merit.Â  This fact indicates only the database\r\n  contains one drug arrest which listed the Hardee's parking lot as the incident\r\n  location.Â  It does not foreclose the existence of other arrests related to drug\r\n  activity in the Hardee's parking lot but not designating it as the incident\r\n  location.Â  For instance, in this case the drug activity occurred in the\r\n  Hardee's parking lot; however, the incident location is listed as the location\r\n  where Burgess was arrested.Â  Additionally, in finding Lutz had reasonable\r\n  suspicion, the trial court relied upon Lutz's personal knowledge of frequent\r\n  complaints by the Hardee's manager regarding drug activity in the parking lot.\r\nFurthermore, while the\r\n  activity in the Hardee's parking lot is capable of innocent explanation,\r\n  &quot;[t]he fact that this activity was taking place in a location well known [for\r\n  drug sales] alters the landscape of reasonable inferences.&quot; Â See U.S.\r\n    v. Johnson, 599 F.3d 339, 345&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2010).Â  Lutz was not required\r\n  &quot;to ignore the relevant characteristics of [the] location in determining\r\n  whether the circumstances [were] sufficiently suspicious to warrant further\r\n  investigation.&quot; Â See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124\r\n  (2000).Â  Furthermore, Lutz's inferences regarding the degree of suspicion to\r\n  attach to Burgess's conduct are entitled to deference.Â  See Johnson,\r\n  599 F.3d at 342.Â  Failing to afford the proper weight to Lutz's inferences &quot;borne\r\n  out of his experience would be to fail to consider the 'totality of the\r\n  circumstances.'&quot;Â  See U.S. v. McCoy, 513 F.3d 405, 414-15&nbsp;(4th\r\n  Cir. 2008).Â  The Johnson court explained:\r\n\r\n  Getting\r\n    the balance right is never guaranteed, but the chances of doing so are improved\r\n    if officers, through training, knowledge, and experience in confronting\r\n    criminality, are uniquely capable both of recognizing its signatures, and by\r\n    the same token, of not reading suspicion into perfectly innocent and natural\r\n    acts. In this way, experience leads not just to proper action but to prudent\r\n    restraint. 'Reasonableness' is a matter of probabilities, and probability in\r\n    turn is best assessed when one has encountered variations on a given scenario\r\n    many times before.\r\n  \r\n\r\nJohnson, 599 F.3d at 343.Â  To find as Burgess would have us do would be\r\n    to discount Lutz's training and experience with similar drug transactions.Â \r\nBurgess argues United\r\n  States v. Sprinkle supports a finding Lutz lacked reasonable suspicion.Â \r\n  106 F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1997).Â  The Sprinkle court found reasonable\r\n  suspicion lacking where Sprinkle was observed huddling in a car with a known\r\n  drug offender in a high drug crime area.Â  Id. at 617-19.Â  The court noted\r\n  that as the officer walked by the car he was able to &quot;actually see that\r\n  nothing of a criminal nature was happening in the car&quot; thus dispelling his\r\n  suspicion.Â  Id. at 618.Â  Here, Lutz explained he was not able to see\r\n  what was exchanged between Burgess and the Jeep's passenger.Â  In other words,\r\n  unlike the officer in Sprinkle, nothing that occurred before Lutz\r\n  stopped Burgess served to dispel his suspicion.Â  Therefore, we conclude Sprinkle is distinguishable and lends Burgess no support.\r\nWe are mindful of concerns\r\n  regarding the State &quot;using whatever facts are present, no matter how\r\n  innocent, as indicia of suspicious activity&quot; and that the State &quot;must\r\n  do more than simply label a behavior as 'suspicious' to make it so.&quot; Â See U.S. v. Foster, 634 F.3d 243, 248&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2011).Â  The State must\r\n  &quot;be able to either articulate why a particular behavior is suspicious or\r\n  logically demonstrate, given the surrounding circumstances, that the behavior\r\n  is likely to be indicative of some more sinister activity than may appear at\r\n  first glance.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Here, the State articulated why the events in\r\n  the Hardee's parking lot were likely indicative of criminal activity at the\r\n  time Lutz observed them: (1) the Hardee's parking lot was a known meeting\r\n  location for drug sales, and (2) Lutz's training and prior knowledge of similar\r\n  drug transactions led him to believe the activity he observed in the parking\r\n  lot was a drug transaction.Â  See Johnson, 599 F.3d at 345\r\n  (relying on officer's conclusion, based on his training and experience, that\r\n  hand-to-hand contact between the defendant and several men in rapid succession in\r\n  a location known for drug sales was indicative of a drug transaction in finding\r\n  reasonable suspicion existed).Â  \r\nFinally, a finding that Lutz\r\n  had reasonable suspicion under the facts present here is consistent with the\r\n  recent decision by our supreme court in State v. Corley, 392 S.C. 125,\r\n  708 S.E.2d 217&nbsp;(2011).Â  There, Officer Futch observed Corley drive up to a\r\n  known drug house at 2:50 in the morning, walk to the back of the house, stay\r\n  for less than two minutes, and return to his car and leave.Â  Id. at 126,\r\n  708 S.E.2d at 217.Â  Futch followed Corley a short distance before stopping him\r\n  after he failed to use his turn signal.Â  Id.Â  Although the court noted\r\n  the traffic violation formed an independent basis for the stop, the court found\r\n  the stop was justified based on the presence of reasonable suspicion.Â  Id. at 127-28, 708 S.E.2d at 218.Â  In our view, the facts here are analogous to\r\n  those in Corley.Â  Both the house in Corley and the Hardee's\r\n  parking lot are known locations for drug activity.Â  Additionally, Futch and\r\n  Lutz both observed behavior that was consistent with the criminal activity the\r\n  location was known for.Â  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the trial court\r\n  properly determined Lutz had reasonable suspicion to stop Burgess.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the trial\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J and PIEPER, J. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Lutz requested the aid of another officer; however,\r\n  none were available to give assistance. \r\n[2] Later testing determined the black bag held 20\r\n  tablets containing MDMA and/or BZP, 15.02 grams of crack cocaine, 7.44 grams of\r\n  cocaine, and 16.69 grams of marijuana.Â  MDMA is commonly known as ecstasy and\r\n  BZP is a simulant comparable to amphetamine.Â  \r\n[3] Burgess waived her right to a jury trial.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4872","title":"State v.

Â Morris appeals the trial court's decision not to suppress the drugs.Â \r\n  We affirmed the decision in a published opinion filed August 17, 2011.Â  We now issue\r\n  this amended opinion to emphasize the outcome of this appeal is governed by our\r\n  standard of review.\r\nFACTS\r\n On\r\n  the afternoon of February 6, 2008, Morris and a passenger, Brandon Nichols,\r\n  were traveling northbound on I-77 in York County in a rented Ford 500.Â  While\r\n  riding in an unmarked police cruiser, Officer L.T. Vinesett, Jr., and Constable\r\n  W.E. Scott noticed the Ford following a truck too closely.Â  The vehicle exited\r\n  the interstate and proceeded to a gas station and rest area, where Officer\r\n  Vinesett initiated a traffic stop.\r\nOfficer\r\n  Vinesett approached the passenger side of the vehicle, where Nichols was\r\n  sitting.Â  Officer Vinesett asked for Morris's license and registration, and\r\n  after a rental agreement was produced, Officer Vinesett noticed the car was\r\n  rented to Nichols and Morris was not an authorized driver.Â  Speaking through\r\n  the passenger window, Officer Vinesett instructed Morris to exit the car, and\r\n  as Morris opened the driver's side door, Officer Vinesett noticed hollowed\r\n  Phillies Blunts[1] in the center console and blunt tobacco in the center console and on the floorboard.\r\nTo\r\n  avoid the rain, Officer Vinesett had Morris sit in the front passenger seat of\r\n  the police cruiser while he inquired about Morris's travel plans.Â  Morris told\r\n  him Nichols rented the vehicle the previous day in Greensboro, North Carolina,\r\n  and they were on their way back from visiting some women in Atlanta, Georgia.Â  Officer\r\n  Vinesett also asked Morris whether Morris had a drug record.Â  Morris disclosed\r\n  he had been arrested for a marijuana offense when he was a minor.Â  \r\nOfficer Vinesett returned to the Ford,\r\n  and outside the presence of Morris, Nichols stated the pair was returning from\r\n  a basketball game in Atlanta.Â  Officer Vinesett consequently radioed for\r\n  a nearby canine unit to bring a drug dog to the scene.Â  He explained that he\r\n  pulled over two men who offered conflicting stories of their plans, one of whom\r\n  had a previous drug conviction, and that he had seen loose blunt tobacco in the\r\n  car, suggesting they had been rolling marijuana in the blunts. \r\nWhile\r\n  waiting for the drug dog, Morris consented to a search of his person, and the\r\n  search yielded no contraband.Â  Morris then went to the restroom under Constable\r\n  Scott's supervision.Â  Officer Vinesett asked Nichols to exit the car and\r\n  requested consent to search Nichols's person.Â  Nichols consented, and again, the\r\n  search yielded no contraband.Â  \r\nMoments\r\n  later, Officer Gibson arrived with a drug dog.Â  While Morris was still in the\r\n  restroom, Officer Vinesett and Officer Gibson asked Nichols for permission to\r\n  search the car, saying the officers would use the drug dog if consent was not\r\n  given.Â  Nichols refused to give consent, so Officer Gibson walked the dog\r\n  around the car twice.Â  The dog did not alert on either lap around the car and was\r\n  returned to the police cruiser. Â Officer Vinesett again asked Nichols for\r\n  consent to search the car, and Nichols again refused. Â Roughly thirteen minutes\r\n  after the stop had been initiated, Nichols stated he &quot;was ready to\r\n  go.&quot;\r\nShortly\r\n  thereafter, the officers held a conversation away from Morris and Nichols.Â  Officer\r\n  Vinesett returned to the Ford, leaned through the still open window of the car,\r\n  and looked around for a few moments.Â  He then returned to Nichols, who was\r\n  still seated in the police cruiser, and stated that he could have &quot;swor[n he]\r\n  could smell some marijuana.&quot; Â Nichols responded that Officer Vinesett was\r\n  confusing the smell of the Black &amp; Mild he recently smoked with marijuana\r\n  and he neither had marijuana, nor was he a marijuana smoker.Â  \r\nAt that time, Officer Vinesett and Officer\r\n  Gibson returned to the car and searched the passenger compartment.Â  The emptied\r\n  blunts contained no marijuana or marijuana residue, and the officers found no\r\n  other evidence of contraband in the passenger compartment.Â  However, Officer\r\n  Vinesett searched the trunk and eventually found a plastic bag containing 393\r\n  ecstasy pills inside a gift box.Â  The men were arrested slightly over fourteen\r\n  minutes after the initiation of the stop.Â  The car was impounded, and a\r\n  subsequent inventory search of the car yielded nearly a half pound of marijuana\r\n  hidden under the spare tire.Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Morris moved to suppress the drug evidence, arguing the officers\r\n  illegally extended the scope and length of the traffic stop and probable cause\r\n  did not support the search of the trunk.Â  During the suppression hearing, Officer\r\n  Vinesett testified that, although he failed to mention it to Constable Scott at\r\n  the scene or Officer Gibson when he requested the dog, he smelled the odor of\r\n  burnt marijuana when he first approached the car.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion.Â  It specifically discounted what Officer Vinesett classified as\r\n  Morris's and Nichols's &quot;inconsistent stories.&quot;Â  However, it found Officer\r\n  Vinesett's testimony regarding the smell of marijuana credible, and it held the\r\n  length and scope of the stop was reasonable in light of the circumstances.Â \r\n  Additionally, the trial court found that even though the dog did not alert on\r\n  the car, the marijuana smell, loose tobacco, and hollowed blunts, in light of\r\n  the officer's knowledge and experience, amounted to probable cause to search\r\n  the entire car, including the trunk.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n     Did\r\n  the trial court err in finding the officers had reasonable suspicion to expand\r\n  the scope and length of the traffic stop?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did\r\n  the trial court err in finding the search of the trunk was supported by\r\n  probable cause?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn Fourth Amendment search and seizure\r\n  cases, our standard of review is limited to the following:\r\n\r\n  The admission of\r\n    evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n    absent an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial\r\n    court's ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual\r\n    conclusions, is without evidentiary support.Â  When reviewing a Fourth Amendment\r\n    search and seizure case, an appellate court must affirm if there is any\r\n    evidence to support the ruling.Â  The appellate court will reverse only when\r\n    there is clear error.\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v.

Scope\r\n  and Length of the Stop\r\nMorris argues the trial court erred in\r\n  failing to suppress the drugs because (1) Officer Vinesett's testimony he\r\n  smelled burnt marijuana during the detention lacks credibility and (2) Officer\r\n  Vinesett unlawfully extended the traffic stop.Â  \r\nUpon a lawful traffic stop, an officer\r\n  &quot;may order the driver to exit the vehicle\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[,]&nbsp;request a driver's license and vehicle\r\n  registration, run a computer check, and issue a citation.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 98, 623 S.E.2d 840, 847 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  However, a lawful traffic stop &quot;can become unlawful if it is\r\n  prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete [its] mission.&quot;Â  Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005); see also Pichardo,\r\n  367 S.C. at 98, 623 S.E.2d at 848 (&quot;Once the purpose of that stop has been\r\n  fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a\r\n  second detention.&quot;).Â  The extension of a lawful traffic stop is permitted\r\n  if (1) the encounter becomes consensual or (2) the officer has a reasonable,\r\n  articulable suspicion of other illegal activity. Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 99,\r\n  623 S.E.2d at 848.Â  \r\nReasonable suspicion requires &quot;'a\r\n  particularized and objective basis' that would lead one to suspect another of\r\n  criminal activity.&quot;Â  State v. Lesley, 326 S.C. 641, 644, 486 S.E2d\r\n  276, 277 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411,\r\n  417 (1981)).Â  It &quot;is something more than an inchoate and unparticularized\r\n  suspicion or hunch.&quot;Â  State v. Rogers, 368 S.C. 529, 534, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Therefore, in determining whether reasonable\r\n  suspicion exists, the trial court must consider the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Id.\r\nInitially, we must reject Morris's first\r\n  argument.Â  Regardless of whether we believe Officer Vinesett's testimony that\r\n  he smelled marijuana, the trial court found that testimony to be credible.Â  The\r\n  appellate court's task in reviewing the trial court's factual findings on a\r\n  Fourth Amendment issue is simply to determine whether any evidence supports the\r\n  trial court's findings.Â  See State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, 193, 493\r\n  S.E.2d 349, 352 (1997) (&quot;This Court's\r\n  scope of review is determined by our State constitution which limits our scope\r\n  of review in law cases to the correction of errors of law.Â  In criminal cases,\r\n  appellate courts are bound by fact findings in response to preliminary motions\r\n  where there has been conflicting testimony or where the findings are supported\r\n  by the evidence and not clearly wrong or controlled by an error of law.&quot;\r\n  (citations omitted)).Â  \r\nWe must also reject Morris's second\r\n  argument.Â  Under the facts of this case as found by the trial court, we must\r\n  affirm the trial court's holding reasonable suspicion existed to extend the\r\n  duration and scope of the stop for a reasonable investigation of drug activity.\r\n  Â Officer Vinesett testified he smelled marijuana as he approached the car, and\r\n  after requesting Morris's license and registration, he learned Morris was not an\r\n  authorized driver.Â  Cf. State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 390, 577\r\n  S.E.2d 498, 501 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding that an officer's detection of the\r\n  odor of alcohol during a traffic stop justified the extension of the stop based\r\n  on the reasonable suspicion that open containers were located in the vehicle)\r\n  (per curiam); see also State v. Odom, 376 S.C. 330, 335, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 748, 751 (Ct. App. 2007) (indicating that the sight of Swisher Sweet\r\n  cigars, the strong odor of marijuana, the defendant's admission he smoked\r\n  marijuana earlier in the day, and the presence of a gun holster in the back\r\n  seat amounted to reasonable suspicion of the existence of drugs).Â  Upon stopping\r\n  the Ford, moreover, Officer Vinesett had the authority to order Morris out of\r\n  the car, and when he did so, he observed the hollow blunts and loose tobacco,\r\n  which in his experience indicated drug use.Â  See Pichardo, 367\r\n  S.C. at 98, 623 S.E.2d at 847-48 (providing that upon a lawful traffic stop, an\r\n  officer may order the driver out of the vehicle, &quot;request a driver's\r\n  license and vehicle registration, run a computer check, and issue a\r\n  citation&quot;).Â  Thus, Officer Vinesett properly gained reasonable suspicion\r\n  Morris and Nichols were using drugs, and he was permitted to take reasonable\r\n  steps to confirm or dispel this suspicion. Â See State v. Corley,\r\n  383 S.C. 232, 241, 679 S.E.2d 187, 192 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n  (providing that during a traffic stop, &quot;the\r\n  police may briefly detain and question a person upon a reasonable suspicion,\r\n  short of probable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal\r\n  activity&quot;; &quot;[t]he scope and duration of [this investigative]\r\n  detention must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances that\r\n  rendered its initiation proper&quot;; and normally, this permits an officer to\r\n  attempt to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's\r\n  suspicion), aff'd as modified, 392 S.C. 125,\r\n  708 S.E.2d 217 (2011). Â He did so by asking both Morris and Nichols a\r\n  series of questions, receiving consent to search their persons, and calling in\r\n  a drug dog.\r\nII. The\r\n  Search\r\nMorris next argues the trial court erred\r\n  in declining to suppress the drug evidence as fruit of an illegal search.Â \r\n  Morris does not contest Officer Vinesett's search of the passenger compartment,\r\n  but he argues Officer Vinesett lacked probable cause to search the trunk.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits\r\n  unreasonable searches, and a warrantless search generally is unreasonable.Â  State\r\n    v. Peters, 271 S.C. 498, 501, 248 S.E.2d 475, 476 (1978).Â  However, the\r\n  ready mobility of and the lessened expectation of privacy in automobiles\r\n  endorse an exception to that rule based upon probable cause.Â  State v. Cox,\r\n  290 S.C. 489, 491, 351 S.E.2d 570, 571 (1986).Â  A probable cause analysis\r\n  involves the use of a fact-based, objective perspective that requires more than\r\n  reasonable suspicion of criminal activity:\r\n\r\n  Probable cause is a commonsense,\r\n    nontechnical conception that deals with the factual and practical\r\n    considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal\r\n    technicians, act.Â  Probable cause\r\n    to search exists where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to\r\n    warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence\r\n    of a crime will be found in a particular place.Â  The principal components of\r\n    the determination of probable cause\r\n    will be whether the events which occurred leading up to the search,\r\n    viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount\r\n    to probable cause.Â  \r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Brown,\r\n  389 S.C. 473, 482, 698 S.E.2d 811, 816&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2010) (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\n&quot;The scope of a warrantless search\r\n  of an automobile is defined by the object of the search and the places in which\r\n  there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Perez, 311 S.C. 542, 546, 430 S.E.2d 503, 505 (1993).Â  Therefore,\r\n  &quot;[i]f probable cause justifies the [warrantless] search of a lawfully\r\n  stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its\r\n  contents that may conceal the object of the search.&quot;Â  United States v.\r\n    Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 825 (1982); see also State v. Brannon,\r\n  347 S.C. 85, 94, 552 S.E.2d 773, 777&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (Anderson, J., concurring\r\n  in result only) (&quot;Under the automobile exception, if probable cause exists\r\n  to justify the warrantless search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies\r\n  the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the\r\n  object of the search.&quot;).Â  \r\nIn this case, the trial court made no\r\n  separate rulings to support its finding of probable cause beyond those\r\n  supporting its pronouncement of reasonable suspicion.Â  The trial court simply stated,\r\n  &quot;He had probable cause to search.&quot;Â  In light of the summary nature of\r\n  this ruling, we must determine whether the same factual findings that supported\r\n  the finding of reasonable suspicion also support a determination of probable\r\n  cause.Â  Emphasizing our deferential standard of review, we determine they do.Â  \r\nThe trial court specifically found that\r\n  in Officer Vinesett's experience blunts are often hollowed to accommodate the\r\n  smoking of marijuana.Â  Similarly, the loose tobacco in the car indicated the blunts\r\n  were recently hollowed in the car.Â  Considering these factors in conjunction with\r\n  the background odor of marijuana, the circumstances are sufficient to warrant a\r\n  reasonable and prudent person to believe Morris and Nichols possessed\r\n  marijuana.Â  Accordingly, the officers had probable cause to search anywhere in\r\n  the vehicle where marijuana could be located. Â The trial court properly admitted\r\n  the drug evidence discovered in the trunk.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, the ruling of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Phillies Blunts\r\n  are a brand of inexpensive, American-made cigars.Â  The tobacco inside a Phillies\r\n  Blunt is often emptied in order to roll a marijuana cigar.\r\n[2] Tindall articulated the standard of review subsequently repeated in Wright.Â \r\n  However, Tindall's ensuing discussion included a footnote explaining\r\n  that this standard of review requires a two-part analysis: (1) whether the\r\n  record supports the trial court's factual findings and (2) whether those\r\n  factual findings establish reasonable suspicion or probable cause.Â  See Tindall,\r\n  388 S.C. at 523 n.5, 698 S.E.2d at 206 n.5 (&quot;While\r\n  we acknowledge that we review under the deferential 'any evidence' standard,\r\n  this Court still must review the record to determine if the trial judge's\r\n  ultimate determination is supported by the evidence.Â  In short, we must ask first,\r\n  whether the record supports the trial court's assumed findings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  and second, whether these facts support a finding that the officer had\r\n  reasonable suspicion of a serious crime to justify continued detention of\r\n  Tindall.&quot; (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4873","title":"MRI at Belfair v.

Â Belfair is a free-standing imaging facility,\r\n  located approximately 13.8 miles away in Beaufort County, South Carolina.Â \r\n  Belfair provides magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services for Beaufort and\r\n  Jasper Counties.Â  Dr. Albert J. Borelli, Jr., a radiologist, is the owner of\r\n  Belfair.Â  Belfair competes with Coastal for MRI services.Â  Pursuant to the\r\n  South Carolina Certificate of Need and Health Facility Licensure Act[1] (the CON\r\n  Act), Belfair is an &quot;affected person&quot;[2] and thus is able to contest the issuance of Coastal's CON pursuant to the CON\r\n  Act.Â  Â Â \r\nOn May 7, 2004, Coastal submitted an application for a CON to South\r\n  Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) to construct a\r\n  fixed MRI suite onto its existing hospital in Jasper County pursuant to the\r\n  2003 State Health Plan[3] (the Plan).Â  Coastal's application proposed that Coastal would purchase a new\r\n  1.5 tesla General Electric MRI unit and house it in an addition to be\r\n  constructed at the hospital.Â  DHEC granted the CON to Coastal on November 22,\r\n  2004.Â  \r\nOn November 24, 2004, Belfair requested a contested case hearing to\r\n  challenge DHEC's issuance of the CON to Coastal on the grounds that the MRI\r\n  project did not satisfy the project review criteria.[4]Â  After an\r\n  evidentiary hearing, the ALC granted partial summary judgment to Coastal and\r\n  DHEC in an order dated November 10, 2005.Â  The ALC determined a CON was\r\n  appropriate because an on-site MRI was necessary to make MRI services\r\n  &quot;available&quot; to Coastal's inpatients and emergency room patients under\r\n  the Plan.Â  Belfair appealed to the South Carolina Board of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (the Board), which affirmed the ALC's order.Â  After\r\n  certification from this court, our supreme court held the Board erred when it\r\n  determined Coastal did not have to establish compliance with the project review\r\n  criteria.Â  MRI at Belfair, LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  379 S.C. 1, 9-10, 664 S.E.2d 471, 475 (2008).Â  The supreme court reversed and\r\n  remanded for a determination on the sole issue[5] of whether Coastal's application complied with the project review criteria.Â  Id. at 10, 664 S.E.2d at 476.Â  On remand, the ALC consolidated Belfair's initial\r\n  case with the current case before this court.Â  Upon motion of Belfair and with\r\n  consent of Coastal and DHEC, Belfair conceded Coastal's MRI project, as set\r\n  forth in its CON application, satisfied the relevant project review criteria.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the ALC dismissed Belfair's initial case and proceeded on Belfair's claim of\r\n  whether Coastal's amendments[6] to its MRI project were substantial, thereby creating a new project pursuant to\r\n  section 605 of South Carolina Code of Regulations 61-15.\r\nAfter hearing from the parties, the ALC concluded the amendments to\r\n  Coastal's MRI project were not substantial; therefore, the amended project was\r\n  not a new project under section 605, and Coastal's CON was not void.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from the ALC are governed by the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n  (APA).[7] Â Pursuant to the APA, this court may reverse or modify the ALC if the appellant's\r\n  substantial rights have been prejudiced because the administrative decisions\r\n  are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess\r\n  of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d)\r\n  affected by an error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f) arbitrary or\r\n  capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n  exercise of discretion. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010). Â &quot;As\r\n  to factual issues, judicial review of administrative agency orders is limited\r\n  to a determination [of] whether the order is supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  MRI at Belfair, 379 S.C. at 6, 664 S.E.2d at 474.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application of Statutory and Regulatory Provisions\r\nBelfair contends the ALC erred in applying the project review criteria\r\n  instead of certain statutory and regulatory provisions as part of its\r\n  substantial change analysis.Â  Specifically, Belfair claims the ALC improperly considered\r\n  the project review criteria[8] to approve Coastal's amended MRI project and thereby excused substantial\r\n  changes to the MRI project that would have otherwise resulted in voiding the\r\n  CON.Â  We disagree. \r\nInitially, we note the purpose of the CON Act &quot;is to promote cost\r\n  containment, prevent unnecessary duplication of health care facilities and\r\n  services, guide the establishment of health facilities and services which will\r\n  best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality services are provided in\r\n  health facilities in this State.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-120 (2002).Â  To\r\n  help achieve this purpose, an applicant is required to obtain a CON before\r\n  undertaking a project prescribed by the CON Act.Â  See Â§ 44-7-120(1).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code of Regulations 61-15 section 801 states that\r\n  &quot;[t]he [project review] criteria listed in Section 802 are to be used in\r\n  reviewing all projects under the Certification of Need program.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n  an application for a CON &quot;must address all applicable standards and\r\n  requirements set forth in departmental regulations, Project Review Criteria\r\n    of the department, and the South Carolina Health Plan.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-7-200(A) (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).Â  Once issued, a CON is &quot;valid\r\n  only for the project described in the application including location, beds and\r\n  services to be offered, physical plant, capital or operating costs, or other\r\n  factors as set forth in the application, except as may be modified in\r\n  accordance with regulations.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-230(A) (2002).Â  If\r\n  modifications occur after DHEC grants a CON, &quot;[DHEC] will decide whether\r\n  or not the amendment is substantial and thereby constitutes a new\r\n  project.&quot;Â  24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 605 (Supp. 2010).Â Â  \r\nHere, the ALC was asked to determine whether Coastal's modifications to\r\n  the MRI project were substantial.Â  The ALC stated in its final amended order, \r\n\r\n  Review of this\r\n    issue requires a comparison of the amended project to the original project\r\n    proposed in the CON application to determine whether the amendment is\r\n    substantial. . . . Â In making that determination, I find that consideration of\r\n    the project review criteria is relevant.Â  In other words, whether the\r\n    amendments to the project substantially change the project's compliance with\r\n    the relevant project review criteria is pertinent in determining whether\r\n    amendments to this permit were substantial under Section 605.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in the ALC's order denying Belfair's motion for\r\n  reconsideration, the court expounded on why consideration of the project review\r\n  criteria was appropriate.Â  The ALC stated, &quot;In making that determination\r\n  in this contested case, it is apodictic that the ALC may consider properly\r\n  admitted relevant evidence. . . . Â Following that reasoning, this [c]ourt []\r\n  included an analysis of whether the amended project meets those same project\r\n  review criteria it originally met in substantially the same way.&quot;\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  We construe the above-quoted language as a permissible\r\n  comparison of the original MRI project's compliance with the project review\r\n  criteria to the amended MRI project's compliance with the same criteria.Â  We find\r\n  this comparison proper in determining whether Coastal's changes were\r\n  &quot;substantial&quot; under section 605.Â  \r\nWe are not persuaded by Belfair's argument that consideration of the\r\n  project review criteria is statutorily prohibited by section 44-7-230(A).Â \r\n  First, as a prerequisite to obtaining a CON from DHEC, section 44-7-200\r\n  expressly requires an applicant to address how its project will comply with the\r\n  relevant project review criteria.Â  See Â§ 44-7-200 (2002 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  Once approved by DHEC, a CON is &quot;valid only for the project\r\n  described in the application including location, beds and services to be\r\n  offered, physical plant, capital or operating costs, or other factors as set\r\n    forth in the application, except as may be modified in accordance with\r\n  regulations.&quot;Â  Â§ 44-7-230(A) (emphasis added).Â  In addition to reviewing\r\n  certain specific factors enumerated in section 44-7-230(A), we find it logical\r\n  that a review of &quot;other factors as set forth in the application,&quot;\r\n  which necessarily includes the project review criteria, to also be appropriate\r\n  when determining whether a CON is valid.Â  Accordingly, if satisfaction of the\r\n  project review criteria is a statutory prerequisite to obtaining a CON, we find\r\n  any change that would impact the applicant's ability to comply with the same\r\n  criteria as relevant evidence on whether the change is substantial enough to\r\n  create a new project.\r\nMoreover, in addition to the project review criteria, the ALC\r\n  considered other factors from section 44-7-230(A) to support its conclusion\r\n  that Coastal's CON was valid despite its amendments to the project.Â  Regarding\r\n  location, the ALC found despite the MRI unit being located adjacent to the\r\n  hospital instead of inside the hospital, the MRI unit was &quot;nevertheless\r\n  built to be an integral part of the hospital&quot; and the &quot;distance\r\n  between the emergency room and [] Coastal's MRI unit would [not] reduce the\r\n  standard of care of emergency room patients . . . .&quot;Â  The ALC also considered\r\n  any differences in the services to be offered as well as the physical layout of\r\n  the project when it addressed all the clinical and operational issues Belfair\r\n  claimed were substantial under the amended project.Â  Regarding the services\r\n  offered by Coastal, the ALC noted the maximum gradient amplitude would be\r\n  slightly lower under the amended project, which would affect the rate at which\r\n  the MRI completes a scan.Â  However, this slight decrease in gradient strength\r\n  would only increase a scan by approximately sixty seconds, which &quot;would\r\n  not increase the wait time for patients since Coastal's volume is approximately\r\n  four scans per day.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the lack of MRI-safe monitoring\r\n  equipment would not preclude Coastal from scanning unstable patients &quot;if\r\n  the radiologist and patient's physician determine the patient can be safely\r\n  removed from monitoring during the MRI scan.&quot;Â  In addition, the ALC\r\n  addressed the difference in the physical layout of the amended project when it\r\n  concluded changes in how patients would access the MRI unit would not make the\r\n  MRI less safe than the proposed MRI.Â  \r\nLast, testimony elicited at the contested case hearing supports the\r\n  ALC's decision to consider the project review criteria in its substantial\r\n  change analysis.Â  Ms. Tibshrany, a former CON reviewer for DHEC, testified\r\n  regarding what DHEC considers in its substantial change analysis.Â  When asked\r\n  how the project review criteria identified as important in the original CON\r\n  application factors into the substantial change determination, she stated,\r\n  &quot;They would still be relevant.Â  We're looking to see that the changes that\r\n  are being made to the project don't affect the initial criteria that were\r\n  deemed to be important at the time of review.&quot;Â  She also testified\r\n  the applicant is still required to meet the same project review criteria as in\r\n  the original application if changes are made.Â  Because DHEC's interpretation in\r\n  this instance was not contrary to the plain language of section 44-7-230(A) or\r\n  section 802 of Regulation 61-15, we find the ALC properly deferred to DHEC in\r\n  this instance.Â  See S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005)\r\n  (&quot;Courts defer to the relevant administrative agency's decisions with\r\n  respect to its own regulations unless there is a compelling reason to\r\n  differ.&quot;); see also Brown v. Biâ€“Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440,\r\n  581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003) (&quot;We recognize the Court generally gives\r\n  deference to an administrative agency's interpretation of an applicable statute\r\n  or its own regulation.&quot;).\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the ALC properly considered the\r\n  appropriate factors, both from section 44-7-230(A) and from section 802 of\r\n  Regulation 61-15, when it concluded Coastal's changes to its MRI project were\r\n  not substantial.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burden of Proof\r\nNext, Belfair contends the ALC placed an impermissible burden of proof\r\n  upon Belfair when it held Belfair had to prove by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that Coastal's changes were substantial enough to warrant voiding the\r\n  CON.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nÂ After the ALC issued its final order, Belfair filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration, but it never specifically objected that the ALC placed an\r\n  impermissible burden of proof upon Belfair.Â  Belfair's failure to do so\r\n  precludes review of this issue on appeal.Â Â  See Brown v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417\r\n  (2002) (&quot;[I]ssues not raised to and ruled on by the ALJ are not preserved\r\n  for appellate consideration.&quot;).Â  Belfair argues in its reply brief that it\r\n  was &quot;legally unnecessary&quot; to make this assertion in its motion for\r\n  reconsideration because it &quot;directly challenged the ALC's test for\r\n  determining whether [Belfair] had shown that [Coastal's] Amended Project\r\n  constituted a 'substantial change' under South Carolina law.&quot;Â  However, we\r\n  find Belfair's challenge to the ALC's consideration of the project review criteria\r\n  is not sufficiently specific to preserve its burden of proof argument for our\r\n  review.Â  See Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  389 S.C. 1, 19, 698 S.E.2d 612, 622 (2010) (finding it is incumbent upon\r\n  appellant to show it had clearly raised the issue to the ALC and asked for a\r\n  specific ruling in that regard to preserve the issue for appellate review); see\r\n    also Anonymous v. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 329 S.C. 371, 375, 496\r\n  S.E.2d 17, 18-19 (1998) (finding issue of burden of proof must be raised to and\r\n  ruled upon to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantial Evidence\r\nBelfair argues the ALC's decision was unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence, thereby requiring reversal pursuant to the APA.Â  We disagree.\r\nSubstantial evidence &quot;is evidence which, considering the record as\r\n  a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the [administrative]\r\n  agency reached.&quot;Â  Leventis v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  340 S.C. 118, 130, 530 S.E.2d 643, 650 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The possibility of\r\n  drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the\r\n  ALC's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Id. at\r\n  130-31, 530 S.E.2d at 650. Â Pursuant to the APA, this court may reverse the ALC\r\n  if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced because the\r\n  administrative decision is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010). Â \r\nBelfair claims it presented overwhelming evidence Coastal's amended\r\n  project was substantially different in equipment, location, layout, scale,\r\n  scope, and services from its original project.Â  While Belfair introduced\r\n  evidence and testimony to indicate changes were made to the MRI project, as the\r\n  fact finder, the ALC could weigh the evidence and assess each witness's\r\n  testimony and credibility prior to ruling on whether these changes were\r\n  substantial enough to constitute a new project under section 605.Â  See Spartanburg\r\n    Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Oncology &amp; Hematology Assoc. of S.C., 387 S.C. 79,\r\n  89, 690 S.E.2d 783, 788 (2010) (&quot;The ALC presides over the hearing of a\r\n  contested case from DHEC's decision on a CON application and serves as the\r\n  finder of fact.&quot;). \r\nSeveral witnesses, including Dr. Borelli, the owner of Belfair,\r\n  testified the original and implemented MRI units have virtually identical\r\n  equipment with substantially similar scan times and image quality. Â Dr.\r\n  Moesch, a radiologist, and Ms. Platt, an expert in health care planning and\r\n  health care finance, both testified the change in location of the MRI project\r\n  in relation to the hospital (adjacent to instead of inside the hospital) as\r\n  well as the minor differences in the &quot;Code Blue&quot; system, the MRI lift\r\n  and lift opening, and the overall layout of the implemented MRI project did not\r\n  substantially change the project from a clinical, operational, or patient\r\n  safety perspective.Â  Further, Coastal presented evidence that the scope\r\n  of the services is the same under both the original and amended project.Â  Although\r\n  Coastal cannot scan &quot;unstable patients&quot; who are in need of constant\r\n  monitoring, Belfair highlights only one instance in Coastal's fifty-page\r\n  application where it references &quot;unstable patients,&quot; and as reflected\r\n  in its initial application, the vast majority of the patients it seeks to serve\r\n  are &quot;acutely ill patients&quot; who are not on constant monitoring\r\n  equipment. Â Last, while Coastal's project costs decreased significantly under\r\n  the amended MRI project, this modification was permissible.Â  Although utilizing\r\n  the fixed MRI unit instead of an in-house MRI unit decreased the operating and\r\n  capital costs estimated in Coastal's CON application, this change was not\r\n  substantial in terms of the project's compliance with the CON because it did\r\n  not negatively affect the project's compliance with the cost containment or\r\n  financial feasibility factors set forth in the project review criteria.Â  Based\r\n  on the foregoing, we find substantial evidence in the record exists to support\r\n  the ALC's conclusion.\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer of Ownership\r\nLast, Belfair claims Coastal's changes to its MRI project were\r\n  substantial, thus resulting in a new project.Â  Because the new project was\r\n  incomplete on the date of the sale of Coastal to Tenet Health Systems, Belfair\r\n  avers Coastal's CON was void as a result of the sale.Â  Because we find\r\n  Coastal's changes to the MRI project were not substantial, we decline to\r\n  address this argument.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (noting appellate court\r\n  need not address an issue when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the ALC's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF AND THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-7-110 to -385 (2002\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\n[2] Specifically, Belfair is a &quot;person[] located in\r\n  the health service area in which the project is to be located and who provide[s]\r\n  similar services to the proposed project . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-7-130(1) (2002).Â  \r\n[3] The State Health Plan is required by the CON Act.Â  The\r\n  Plan contains specific standards and information for health care facilities and\r\n  health care equipment.Â  DHEC may not issue a CON unless an application complies\r\n  with the Plan, project review criteria, and other regulations.Â  See 24A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 801 (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\n[4] DHEC considered the following project review criteria\r\n  in determining whether a CON was appropriate in this case: (1) community need;\r\n  (2) distribution/accessibility; (3) cost containment; (4) acceptability; (5)\r\n  financial feasibility; and (6) adverse impact.Â  See 24A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 61-15 Â§ 802 (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\n[5] The supreme court affirmed the Board's finding that\r\n  the Plan standards for MRI services did not violate state statutes on CONs.Â  It\r\n  also affirmed the Board's conclusion that substantial evidence existed to support\r\n  Coastal's need for an onsite MRI unit.Â  MRI at Belfair, 379 S.C. at\r\n  9-10, 664 S.E.2d at 475-76.\r\n[6] Specifically, Coastal sought a determination from\r\n  DHEC as to whether its plan to convert its mobile MRI unit to a fixed MRI unit\r\n  was a substantial change to the originally approved project.Â  DHEC determined\r\n  this amendment was not a substantial change because the location of the project\r\n  did not change, the cost of the project decreased, and the 1.5 tesla mobile MRI\r\n  was substantially the same as the 1.5 tesla MRI proposed in Coastal's CON\r\n  application. Â Belfair requested the Board to review DHEC's staff decision,\r\n  which the Board declined to do, prompting Belfair's request for a contested\r\n  case hearing before the ALC.\r\n[7] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-310 to -400 (2006\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\n[8] The project review criteria DHEC applied and the ALC\r\n  subsequently considered were (1) need; (2) accessibility/distribution; (3) cost\r\n  containment; (4) acceptability; (5) financial feasibility; and (6) adverse\r\n  impact.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4874","title":"Wachovia v.

The note was secured by a\r\n  mortgage on the property executed by William Blackburn, Judith Blackburn, Tammy\r\n  Winner, and Watson Felder. Â Judith Blackburn, Winner, and Felder also\r\n  executed personal guaranties to secure the note.[1] Â The note and each of the guaranties contained waiver of jury trial\r\n  provisions. Â Â The note signed by William Blackburn contained the following jury\r\n  trial provision:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  WAVIER OF JURY TRIAL.Â  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF\r\n  BORROWER BY EXECUTION HEREOF AND BANK BY ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, KNOWINGLY,\r\n  VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY\r\n  IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN\r\n  CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED TO\r\n  BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF\r\n  DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY WITH\r\n  RESPECT HERETO.Â  THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO BANK TO ACCEPT THIS\r\n  NOTE . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n(bold and capitalization in original, font size not to scale). Â The\r\n  guaranty signed by Judith Blackburn contained the following jury trial\r\n  provision:\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.Â  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF\r\n  GUARANTOR BY EXECUTION HEREOF AND BANK BY ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, KNOWINGLY,\r\n  VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY\r\n  IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN\r\n  CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED\r\n  TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,\r\n  COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY\r\n  PARTY WITH RESPECT HERETO.Â  THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ACCEPT\r\n  THIS GUARANTY. . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n(bold and capitalization in original, font size not to scale). Â \r\n\r\n On November 13, 2008, Wachovia filed this foreclosure action\r\n  against the Blackburns, Winner, and Felder, asserting the note was in default\r\n  and it was entitled to a judgment against the defendants in the amount of\r\n  $473,747.24.Â  In response, the Blackburns filed a second amended answer,\r\n  counterclaim, cross-claim, and third-party complaint in which they asserted\r\n  claims against Wachovia and several third-party defendants.[2]Â \r\n  The Blackburns asserted the following counterclaims against Wachovia:Â  (1)\r\n  negligent misrepresentation, (2) unfair trade practices, (3) promissory\r\n  estoppel, (4) breach of contract/breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\n  act, (5) breach of fiduciary duty, (6) fraud/fraud in the inducement, (7) breach\r\n  of contract/negligence, (8) breach of contract, (9) civil conspiracy, and (10)\r\n  illegality of contract. Â The Blackburns alleged Wachovia partnered with the\r\n  third-party defendants[3] to promote and sell the property at a &quot;high pressure&quot; sales event\r\n  which included a lottery.Â  According to the Blackburns, Wachovia and the\r\n  third-party defendants defrauded buyers by artificially inflating property\r\n  values and making misrepresentations regarding the construction of amenities in\r\n  the development.Â  The Blackburns demanded a jury trial.Â \r\n  \r\nOn June 18, 2009, Wachovia filed a motion to strike\r\n  the Blackburns' jury trial demand and refer the case to the master-in-equity.Â  Wachovia argued the Blackburns waived their right to a jury trial in the\r\n  note and guaranty. Â In a memorandum opposing Wachovia's motion to\r\n  strike, the Blackburns alleged (1) there was not a knowing and voluntary\r\n  waiver, (2) the language of the waivers did not apply to their counterclaims, (3)\r\n  the waivers were unconscionable, and (4) the circuit court could order a jury\r\n  trial in its discretion pursuant to Rule 39(b), SCRCP. Â In a December 7, 2009\r\n  order, the circuit court granted Wachovia's motion, finding the jury trial waivers\r\n  in the note and guaranty were clear and unambiguous and the Blackburns'\r\n  counterclaims were within the scope of the waivers.Â  The circuit court held the\r\n  Blackburns were charged with having read the contents of the note and guaranty\r\n  and were on notice of the jury trial waivers. Â The circuit court found\r\n  the Blackburns' Rule 39(b), SCRCP, argument was without merit, and referred the\r\n  action to the master. Â This appeal followed.Â \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\n&quot;A mortgage foreclosure is an action in\r\n  equity.&quot;Â  U.S. Bank Trust Nat. Ass'n v. Bell, 385 S.C. 364, 373,\r\n  684 S.E.2d 199, 204&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009). Â Â &quot;In an appeal from an action\r\n  in equity, tried by a judge alone, we may find facts in accordance with our own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;Whether a party is entitled to a jury trial is a question of law.&quot;Â  Verenes\r\n  v. Alvanos, 387 S.C. 11, 15, 690 S.E.2d 771, 772 (2010). Â &quot;An\r\n  appellate court may decide questions of law with no particular deference to the\r\n  [circuit] court.&quot;Â  Id. at 15, 690 S.E.2d at 772-73.Â \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Knowing and Voluntary\r\n    Waiver\r\n  \r\nThe Blackburns argue they did not knowingly and\r\n  voluntarily waive their right to a jury trial.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  \r\nThe Blackburns contend there is no evidence in the\r\n  record they had actual knowledge of the waivers.Â  They maintain the only\r\n  evidence regarding whether they knowingly and voluntarily waived their right to\r\n  a jury trial is their affidavit. Â In their affidavit, the Blackburns asserted\r\n  they did not knowingly, voluntarily, or intentionally waive their right to a\r\n  jury trial and were &quot;not aware of any jury trial waiver&quot; until\r\n  Wachovia's motion to strike jury demand. Â In their brief, the Blackburns\r\n  rely on Leasing Corp. v. Crane, 804 F.2d 828 (4th Cir. 1986)\r\n  to support their contention that a party seeking the enforcement of a waiver\r\n  must prove that consent was both voluntary and informed.Â  The Blackburns note\r\n  the Crane court cited National Equipment Rental Ltd. v. Hendrix, 565\r\n  F.2d 255 (2d Cir. 1977), wherein the Second Circuit affirmed a finding that a\r\n  provision whereby a lessee waived a jury trial buried in the eleventh paragraph\r\n  of a fine print, 16-clause agreement did not constitute a knowing and\r\n  intelligent waiver of the lessee's right to a jury trial. Â \r\n  \r\n Wachovia argues that by signing the note and guaranty, the\r\n  Blackburns are deemed to have read the documents and cannot avoid their effects\r\n  by arguing otherwise.Â  Wachovia maintains it did not have a duty to ensure the\r\n  Blackburns had read and understood the terms of the note and guaranty. Wachovia\r\n  further contends the waivers are conspicuous, the note and guaranty are not\r\n  lengthy documents, and there is no evidence the Blackburns are unsophisticated\r\n  or were incapable of understanding the note and guaranty.Â \r\n  \r\n We agree with Wachovia.Â  First, we note that while the\r\n  Blackburns rely on federal case law in their brief, a parties' right to a jury\r\n  trial in South Carolina is governed by state law.Â  See Pelfrey v.\r\n  Bank of Greer, 270 S.C. 691, 693, 244 S.E.2d 315, 316 (1978) (holding the\r\n  Seventh Amendment to the United State Constitution is not applicable to the\r\n  States).Â \r\n  \r\nWe do not believe the Blackburns can avoid the waivers\r\n  in the note and guaranty by arguing they were not knowing and voluntary.Â  &quot;A\r\n  party may waive the right to a jury trial by contract.&quot;Â  Beach Co. v.\r\n  Twillman, Ltd., 351 S.C. 56, 63, 566 S.E.2d 863, 866 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  &quot;Such a waiver must be strictly construed as the right to trial by jury is\r\n  a substantial right.&quot;Â  Id. at 64, 566 S.E.2d at 866.Â  &quot;When a\r\n  contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions according to the\r\n  terms the parties used, understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular\r\n  sense.&quot;Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Oates, 356 S.C. 378,\r\n  381, 588 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;A person who signs a contract\r\n  or other written document cannot avoid the effect of the document by claiming\r\n  he did not read it.&quot; Â Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 663,\r\n  582 S.E.2d 432, 440 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;A person signing a document is responsible\r\n  for reading the document and making sure of its contents.&quot; Â Id.Â  Â &quot;Every\r\n  contracting party owes a duty to the other party to the contract and to the\r\n  public to learn the contents of a document before he signs it.&quot; Â Id.Â \r\n  &quot;One who signs a written instrument has the duty to exercise reasonable\r\n  care to protect himself.&quot; Â Id. at 665, 582 S.E.2d at 440.Â  &quot;The\r\n  law does not impose a duty on the bank to explain to an individual what he\r\n  could learn from simply reading the document.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  \r\nHere, the waivers are conspicuous and unambiguous.Â \r\n  They are printed in all capital letters with the bold heading, &quot;WAIVER\r\n  OF JURY TRIAL.&quot; Â Furthermore, the note and guaranty are not lengthy\r\n  documents and the waivers contained therein are not buried within the language\r\n  of other provisions. Â Rather, the waivers are contained in separate paragraphs\r\n  located just above the signature lines. Â By signing the note and guaranty, the\r\n  Blackburns are charged with having read their contents, and therefore, they cannot\r\n  avoid their effects by arguing they were unaware of the inclusion of the\r\n  waivers.Â  See Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 663, 582 S.E.2d at 440 (&quot;A\r\n  person who signs a contract or other written document cannot avoid the effect\r\n  of the document by claiming he did not read it.&quot;); see also Id. Â (&quot;Every contracting party owes a duty to the other party to the contract\r\n  and to the public to learn the contents of a document before he signs it.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the jury trial waivers are enforceable.\r\nII.&nbsp; Applicability\r\n  \r\nThe Blackburns argue the jury trial waivers in the\r\n  note and guaranty do not apply to their counterclaims. Â We agree.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPursuant to the note and guaranty, the waivers at\r\n  issue apply to\r\n  \r\n\r\nany litigation based on, or arising out of, under or\r\n  in connection with this note [or guaranty], the loan documents or any agreement\r\n  contemplated to be executed in connection with this note [or guaranty], or any\r\n  course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether verbal or written) or\r\n  actions of any party with respect hereto.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Blackburns allege that while their counterclaims\r\n  arise out of the same occurrence as the note, they do not arise out of the loan\r\n  documents as required by the waivers. Â Pursuant to the note, &quot;loan\r\n  documents&quot;\r\n\r\n  \r\nrefers to all documents executed in connection with or\r\n  related to the loan evidenced by this Note and any prior notes which evidence\r\n  all or any portion of the loan evidenced by this Note, and any letters of\r\n  credit issued pursuant to any loan agreement to which this Note is subject, any\r\n  applications for such letters of credit and any other documents executed in\r\n  connection therewith or related thereto, and may include, without limitation, a\r\n  commitment letter that survives closing, a loan agreement, this Note, guaranty\r\n  agreements, security agreements, security instruments, financing statements,\r\n  mortgage instruments, any renewals or modifications, whenever any of the foregoing\r\n  are executed, but does not include swap agreements.Â \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Blackburns contend their counterclaims arise from Wachovia's sales\r\n  misrepresentations and failure to abide by promises to build infrastructure,\r\n  amenities, and docks, and do not arise from the loan documents.[4]Â \r\n  They maintain the definition of &quot;loan documents&quot; does not include\r\n  sales contracts, deeds, promotional literature from the developer/seller,\r\n  lottery procedure, or promises regarding docks and amenities and\r\n  infrastructure.Â  They also assert their counterclaims do not arise from the\r\n  note, mortgage, loan application, financing statements, letters of credit, or\r\n  any of the loan documents defined above. The Blackburns further argue the\r\n  allegations of sales misrepresentations in their counterclaims are unrelated to\r\n  the note, and thus, not subject to the waivers.Â  The Blackburns rely heavily on Aiken v. World Finance Corp. of South Carolina, 373 S.C. 144, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  705&nbsp;(2007) and Partain v. Upstate Automotive Group, 386 S.C. 488,\r\n  689 S.E.2d 602&nbsp;(2010), two supreme court cases involving arbitration\r\n  agreements, to support their argument.Â \r\n  \r\n  Aiken involved a tort action based on the theft of Aiken's personal information by\r\n  employees of World Finance. Â 373 S.C. at 146, 644 S.E.2d at 706. Â In Aiken,\r\n  World Finance sought to enforce an arbitration clause to which Aiken had agreed\r\n  in applying for a loan. Â Id. at 147, 644 S.E.2d at 707. \r\nThe Aiken court found that &quot;even the most broadly-worded\r\n  arbitration agreements still have limits founded in general principles of\r\n  contract law,&quot; and therefore, the court &quot;will refuse to interpret any\r\n  arbitration agreement as applying to outrageous torts that are unforeseeable to\r\n  a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.&quot;Â  Id. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709. Â The court provided that it did not seek to exclude\r\n  all intentional torts from the scope of\r\n  arbitration, but only &quot;those outrageous torts, which although factually\r\n  related to the performance of the contract, are legally distinct from the contractual\r\n  relationship between the parties.&quot; Id. at 152, 644 S.E.2d at 709. Â The Aiken court found the theft of Aiken's personal information by World\r\n  Finance employees to be unanticipated and unforeseeable tortious conduct that\r\n  was not within the scope of the arbitration agreement.Â  Id.Â  at 151, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 709.\r\nIn Partain, Partain alleged Upstate Auto fraudulently\r\n  replaced the truck he purchased with a different truck at the time of pick-up. Â 386\r\n  S.C. at 490, 689 S.E.2d at 603.Â  Partain filed suit against Upstate Auto\r\n  alleging he was the victim of a &quot;bait and switch&quot; in violation of the\r\n  South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. Â Id.Â  Based on an arbitration\r\n  agreement, Upstate Auto moved to dismiss Partain's claim. Â Id. Â The Partain court found Aiken was controlling and concluded the arbitration clause\r\n  did not apply because &quot;the alleged actions\r\n  of Upstate Auto constituted 'illegal and outrageous acts' unforeseeable to a\r\n  reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.&quot;Â  Partain,\r\n  386 S.C. at 493, 689 S.E.2d at 604-05.Â  Our supreme court noted Partain could\r\n  not be held to have foreseen that Upstate Auto, after completing a sale, would\r\n  substitute an entirely different vehicle in place of the truck he had agreed to\r\n  purchase. Â Id. at 494, 689\r\n  S.E.2d at 605. Â Moreover, the court found Partain could not have &quot;contemplated\r\n  that, in signing the arbitration clause, he was agreeing to arbitrate claims\r\n  arising from allegedly fraudulent conduct.&quot; Â Id.&nbsp;\r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the Blackburns argue they cannot be held to\r\n  have contemplated that, in signing the note and guaranty, they were agreeing to\r\n  waive jury trial claims arising from allegedly fraudulent conduct. They contend\r\n  that a reasonable person attempting to secure a loan from a bank could not foresee\r\n  that the bank would partner with the developer/seller and make\r\n  misrepresentations about the property and the construction of amenities.Â \r\n  \r\nWachovia asserts the Blackburns' counterclaims are\r\n  within the scope of the waivers because their claims concern Wachovia's\r\n  &quot;course of conduct,&quot; &quot;course of dealing,&quot;\r\n  &quot;actions,&quot; and &quot;statements&quot; with respect to the loan\r\n  transaction. Wachovia maintains the counterclaims arise out of the note because\r\n  the Blackburns allege Wachovia, as part of its course of dealing, made misrepresentations\r\n  to induce them to enter into the loan.Â  Wachovia notes the Blackburns allege\r\n  the marketing of the property, the sale of the lots, and the provision of\r\n  Wachovia loans were all part of a single transaction orchestrated by a\r\n  partnership between Wachovia and the developers. Â Wachovia also alleges the\r\n  Blackburns' counterclaims arise out of the property sales contract, which is an\r\n  &quot;agreement contemplated to be executed in connection with the note&quot;\r\n  and guaranty.Â  Wachovia maintains our supreme court's holdings in Aiken and Partain (1) do not apply outside of the context of arbitration\r\n  agreements, (2) apply only to consumer transactions, and (3) the Blackburns\r\n  have not alleged any &quot;outrageous&quot; conduct like that which was\r\n  excepted in Aiken and Partain.Â \r\n  \r\n We do not believe the allegations of sales misrepresentations\r\n  and pre-purchase fraud by the Blackburns are sufficiently related to the note,\r\n  and thus, we do not believe they are subject to the waivers.Â  Jury trial waivers\r\n  are a substantial right and must be strictly construed.Â  Beach Co., 351\r\n  S.C. at 64, 566 S.E.2d at 866. Â Pursuant to the note and guaranty, the waivers\r\n  apply to &quot;any litigation based on, or arising out of, under or in connection\r\n  with [the] note, the loan documents or any agreement contemplated to be\r\n  executed in connection with [the] note.&quot;Â  First, we find the Blackburns'\r\n  counterclaims are not based on nor do they arise out of the note. Â The\r\n  Blackburns' claims are based on the sales contract, the promotional literature\r\n  regarding the development, the lottery procedure, and the promises made\r\n  regarding amenities. Â Second, we find the Blackburns' claims are not based on\r\n  or arise out of the loan documents. Â The definition of &quot;loan\r\n  documents&quot; does not include sales documents, and the sales documents were\r\n  not &quot;executed in connection with or related to the loan&quot; as required\r\n  by the definition.Â  Third, we find the sales contract was not an &quot;agreement\r\n  contemplated to be executed in connection with [the] note,&quot; as it was\r\n  executed months prior to the note.Â  Finally, we find the waivers do not apply\r\n  to &quot;any course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether verbal\r\n  or written) or actions of any party with respect [to the note].&quot; Â We note\r\n  this clause refers to conduct and actions with respect to the note and does not\r\n  refer to the sales transaction.Â \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, the Blackburns could not have contemplated\r\n  that in signing the note and guaranty, they were waiving their right to a jury\r\n  trial on claims arising from allegedly fraudulent conduct. Â See Aiken,\r\n  373 S.C. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709 (holding the theft of Aiken's personal\r\n  information by World Finance employees was unanticipated and unforeseeable\r\n  tortious conduct that was not within the scope of the arbitration agreement); see\r\n  also Partain, 386 S.C. at 494, 689 S.E.2d at 605&nbsp;(holding\r\n  Partain could not have contemplated that, in signing the arbitration clause, he\r\n  was agreeing to arbitrate claims arising from allegedly fraudulent conduct).[5] Â We find a\r\n  reasonable buyer would not contemplate that a bank would partner with a\r\n  developer/seller and make misrepresentations about a property and the\r\n  construction of amenities.Â  The Blackburns' counterclaims arise out of the\r\n  alleged pre-sale misrepresentations and fraud of Wachovia, and not out of the\r\n  note. Â Although the waivers are enforceable with regard to claims arising from\r\n  the note, we find the Blackburns' allegations of sales misrepresentations and\r\n  pre-purchase fraud are not within the scope of the waivers. Â Accordingly,\r\n  applying a strict construction of the language of the waivers, we find they are\r\n  unenforceable with regard to the Blackburns' counterclaims.[6] Â \r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We\r\n    affirm the circuit court's determination that the Blackburns knowingly and\r\n    voluntarily waived their right to a jury trial.Â  However, we reverse the\r\n    circuit court's determination that the Blackburns' counterclaims were within\r\n    the scope of the waivers.[7]\r\n   AFFIRMED\r\n    IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n  WILLIAMS  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On October 12, 2007, Felder conveyed his interest in\r\n  the property to Gary Ownbey.Â  \r\n[2] The Blackburns filed their original answer on\r\n  February 2, 2009, and amended answer, counterclaim, cross-claim, and\r\n  third party complaint on February 13, 2009 .\r\n[3] The third-party defendants included Winyah Bay\r\n  Holdings, LLC; Source One Properties, LLC; and Waterpointe Realty, LLC.Â  \r\n[4] The Blackburns maintain Wachovia &quot;injected\r\n  itself into the marketing and sale of [the] property . . . , became a joint\r\n  venturer or partner, and is therefore equally liable for sales\r\n  misrepresentations made and failures to provide infrastructure, amenities,\r\n  docks, etc.&quot;Â  \r\n[5] While Aiken and Partain involve\r\n  arbitration agreements and not jury trial waivers, we believe they are\r\n  instructive.Â  \r\n[6] We note this opinion does not preclude the circuit\r\n  court, after appropriate discovery and/or testimony, from striking any or all\r\n  of these counterclaims as insufficient and, if appropriate, referring any\r\n  remaining equitable matters to the master-in-equity.Â  \r\n[7] Based upon our reversal of the circuit court's order\r\n  granting Wachovia's motion to strike jury demand, we need not address the\r\n  remaining issues on appeal.Â  See Futch v.

Kelley, and his natural and legal guardian\r\n  Elizabeth Powell (collectively Powell) $205,735.37 in actual damages and\r\n  $1,583,000 in punitive damages.Â  BOA appeals arguing the trial court erred in\r\n  denying its (1) motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) as to\r\n  negligence and punitive damages and (2) motion for a new trial based on the\r\n  admission of evidence regarding its size.Â  BOA also contends the trial court\r\n  erred in finding the award of punitive damages was constitutionally proper.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFacts\r\nSteven Powell died in a tragic accident at work\r\n  entitling his minor son, Cody, to approximately $252,000 in life insurance\r\n  proceeds.Â  Karen Unrue, Steven's sister, approached Elizabeth Powell, Steven's widow,\r\n  and offered to manage the insurance proceeds for Cody.Â  Unrue was a trusted\r\n  family member who had occasionally assisted the Powells with managing their\r\n  personal finances in the past.Â  Powell agreed to allow Unrue to serve as\r\n  conservator over the insurance proceeds.Â  Unrue also suggested Steven's\r\n  brother, Travis Powell, serve as co-conservator.\r\nPowell petitioned the probate court to appoint Unrue\r\n  and Travis as co-conservators, and after a hearing, the court appointed Unrue\r\n  and Travis as co-conservators.Â  The probate court also waived the bond requirement\r\n  and ordered &quot;that the funds of the minor child, [Cody], be deposited in a\r\n  restricted account and that no funds be withdrawn or transferred from such\r\n  account without written [o]rder of [the probate court].&quot;Â  The certificate\r\n  of appointment and fiduciary letter included the following restriction:\r\n  &quot;No withdrawals without court order.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nOn Cody's behalf, Unrue received seven checks totaling\r\n  $252,447.51. Three of the checks were made payable to her and Travis jointly\r\n  and included the designation &quot;Co-conservators For [Cody], A Minor&quot; or\r\n  &quot;Co-Cn For Minor, [Cody].&quot;[1]Â \r\n  The other four checks were made payable to Unrue and included the designation\r\n  &quot;As Conservator Of [Cody], A Minor.&quot;Â  Unrue endorsed the checks\r\n  without including her title as co-conservator.Â  Unbeknownst to Travis, Unrue\r\n  forged his name on the three checks made payable to her and Travis as\r\n  co-conservators and took all the checks to the Pawleys Island BOA.Â  Unrue met\r\n  with Lee Ann Yourko, a personal banker, and requested she open a certificate of\r\n  deposit (CD) account.Â  Yourko opened a CD account titled &quot;Karen M. Unrue\r\n  Guardian [Cody].&quot;Â  Yourko collected the checks and took them to a teller\r\n  who processed the checks and deposited the proceeds into the CD account Yourko\r\n  created. Â Neither Yourko nor the teller questioned the significance of the\r\n  conservator designation in the payee line of the checks.\r\nA few days later, Unrue returned to the Pawleys Island\r\n  BOA with a single check for $253.67 made payable to her &quot;As Conservator\r\n  For Cody A Minor.&quot;Â  Unrue met with branch manager Meredith Lawrence and\r\n  requested she open a Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) account.[2]Â \r\n  Lawrence opened a savings account titled &quot;Karen M. Unrue â€“ cust [Cody] â€“\r\n  UMGA [sic].&quot;Â  Lawrence did not question the significance of the\r\n  conservator title on the payee line of the check.Â  Lawrence also failed to\r\n  notice Unrue endorsed the check without including her title.\r\nApproximately a month later, after the CD matured,\r\n  Unrue entered the Garden City BOA and withdrew 100% of the funds, $253,991.50, from\r\n  the CD account.Â  Unrue took the funds to the Pawleys Island BOA and deposited\r\n  them in the UGMA savings account.Â  Over the next several months, Unrue made\r\n  seven online transfers totaling $258,500 from the UGMA savings account to her\r\n  personal checking account.\r\nPowell initiated this action for negligence alleging\r\n  BOA breached its duty to honor the restrictions set forth in the probate\r\n  court's order, certificate of appointment, and fiduciary letter.Â  Powell also\r\n  sought actual and punitive damages.Â  After a trial, the jury found in favor of\r\n  Powell and awarded actual damages in the amount of $205,735.37 as stipulated by\r\n  the parties.Â  The jury also found BOA's conduct was willful, wanton, or reckless\r\n  and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $1,583,000.Â  \r\nBOA sought a post-trial review of the punitive damages\r\n  award alleging it was improper under Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104,\r\n  406 S.E.2d 350 (1991), and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v.\r\n    Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003).Â  BOA moved for JNOV as to Powell's\r\n  negligence claim and the award of punitive damages.Â  BOA also moved for a new\r\n  trial arguing the trial court erred in allowing the admission of evidence\r\n  regarding its size.Â  After a hearing, the trial court denied BOA's post-trial\r\n  motions and determined the award of punitive damages was constitutionally\r\n  proper.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Judgment Notwithstanding\r\n  the Verdict: Negligence\r\nBOA argues the trial court erred in denying its motion\r\n  for JNOV on Powell's negligence claim because Unrue's actions were unforeseeable\r\n  intervening acts that proximately caused Powell's loss.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on a motion for JNOV, the trial court must\r\n  view the evidence, and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn from the\r\n  evidence, in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  McMillan\r\n    v. Oconee Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884,\r\n  886&nbsp;(2006).Â  The trial court should deny a motion for JNOV when the\r\n  evidence yields more than one inference or its inferences are in doubt.Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;This [c]ourt will reverse the trial court's rulings on [a motion for\r\n  JNOV] only where there is no evidence to support the rulings or where the\r\n  rulings are controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Hinkle v. Nat'l Cas. Ins.\r\n    Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618&nbsp;(2003).\r\nGenerally, the elements of negligence are (1) duty,\r\n  (2) breach, (3) proximate cause, and (4) injury.Â  Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly\r\n    St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 482-83, 238 S.E.2d 167, 168&nbsp;(1977).Â \r\n  To show the defendant was the proximate cause of the injury, the plaintiff must\r\n  establish the defendant was both the cause-in-fact and the legal cause of the\r\n  injury.Â  Mellen v.

App. 2008).Â  The cause-in-fact requirement is proved by showing\r\n  the injury would not have occurred but for the defendant's negligence.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The legal cause requirement is proved by establishing the plaintiff's injury\r\n  was foreseeable.Â  Id. at 278-79, 659 S.E.2d at 245.\r\nGenerally, an injury is foreseeable if it is the\r\n  natural and probable consequence of the defendant's conduct in light of the\r\n  attendant circumstances.Â  See Young v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C.\r\n  453, 462-63, 242 S.E.2d 671, 675-76&nbsp;(1978); Mellen, 377 S.C. at\r\n  279-80, 659 S.E.2d at 246.Â  However, &quot;[a] special case is presented if the\r\n  injury is independently caused by the intervening act of a third party.&quot;Â  Shepard\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 299 S.C. 370, 375, 385 S.E.2d 35, 37&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1989).Â  In that case, the general rule is &quot;that when, between negligence\r\n  and the occurrence of an injury, there intervenes a willful, malicious, and\r\n  criminal act of a third person producing the injury, but that such was not intended by the\r\n  negligent person and could not have been foreseen by him, the causal chain\r\n  between the negligence and the accident is broken.&quot;Â  Stone v. Bethea,\r\n  251 S.C. 157, 162, 161 S.E.2d 171, 173-74&nbsp;(1968).Â  In other words, &quot;[t]he\r\n  test is whether the intervening act and the injury resulting therefrom are of such a character that\r\n  the author of the primary negligence should have reasonably anticipated them in\r\n  light of the attendant circumstances.&quot;Â  Shepard, 299 S.C. at 375, 385 S.E.2d at 38-39; see Young,\r\n  270 S.C. at 463, 242 S.E.2d at 676 (&quot;Where there is a contention that an\r\n  intervening agency interrupts the foreseeable chain of events, there are two\r\n  consequences to be tested: (1) the injury complained of, and (2) the acts of\r\n  the intervening agency.&quot;).Â  \r\n&quot;The law requires only reasonable foresight, and\r\n  when the injury complained of is not reasonably foreseeable, in the exercise of\r\n  due care, there is no liability.&quot;Â  Stone, 251 S.C. at 161, 161\r\n  S.E.2d at 173.Â  &quot;One is not\r\n  charged with foreseeing that which is unpredictable or that which could not be\r\n  expected to happen.&quot;Â  Id. at 161-62, 161 S.E.2d at 173.Â  However, &quot;it is not necessary that the actor\r\n  should have contemplated the particular chain of events that occurred, but only\r\n  that the injury at the hand of the intervening party was within the general\r\n  range of consequences which any reasonable person might foresee as a natural\r\n  and probable consequence of the negligent act.&quot;Â  Shepard, 299 S.C.\r\n  at 375, 385 S.E.2d at 38. \r\nForeseeability is determined from the defendant's\r\n  perspective at the time of the negligent act allegedly causing the plaintiff's\r\n  injury.Â  Mellen, 377 S.C. at 280, 659 S.E.2d at 246; Shepard, 299\r\n  S.C. at 375, 385 S.E.2d at 38 (noting &quot;[f]oreseeability is to be judged\r\n  from the perspective of the actor at the time of the negligent act, not after\r\n  the injury has occurred&quot;).Â  Ordinarily, legal cause is a question of fact\r\n  for the jury.Â  Oliver v. S.C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub.

Sigma Nu General Fraternity, 291 S.C. 140, 147,\r\n  352 S.E.2d 488, 493&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  &quot;The particular facts and\r\n  circumstances of each case determine whether the question of proximate cause is\r\n  for the court or for the jury.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;If there may be a fair\r\n  difference of opinion regarding whose act proximately caused the injury, then\r\n  the question of proximate cause must be submitted to\r\n  the jury.Â  Id. at 147-48, 352 S.E.2d at 493.Â  &quot;Only when the\r\n  evidence is susceptible to only one inference does it become a matter of law\r\n  for the court.&quot;Â  Oliver, 309 S.C. at 317, 422 S.E.2d at 131.Â  \r\nWe find the trial court properly denied BOA's motion\r\n  for JNOV on Powell's negligence claim.Â  Here, Robert Hubbs, an expert in\r\n  banking and banking operations, testified banks anticipate theft.Â  Hubbs\r\n  explained banks implement and follow standard policies and procedures for\r\n  establishing accounts and negotiating checks that are designed to prevent\r\n  theft.Â  BOA's designated representative, Elizabeth Reeves, also explained that\r\n  banks anticipate theft and implement safeguards to prevent the misappropriation\r\n  of customer's funds.Â  According to Reeves, when an individual is managing funds\r\n  for another, additional safeguards are used by banks to protect the funds of\r\n  the minor or incapacitated person.\r\nBOA implemented policies and procedures designed to\r\n  avoid fraud and loss situations.Â  For instance, when creating an account for an\r\n  individual who is appointed by the court to manage the funds of another, such\r\n  as a conservatorship account, BOA is required to obtain an original or\r\n  certified copy of the court order appointing the individual.Â  If a court\r\n  order is required for withdrawals, &quot;Court Restricted Account&quot; must be\r\n  placed in the title of the account.Â  If the court order contains restrictions,\r\n  the employee creating the account is required to contact BOA Banking Group\r\n  Support-Legal Support.Â  When negotiating a check made payable to a payee with a\r\n  title such as a conservator, BOA's Teller Operations Manual requires the\r\n  employee to verify the authority of the payee. Â Individuals named on the\r\n  &quot;payable to&quot; line of a check must endorse the check exactly as it is\r\n  payable.Â  Individuals with a title such as conservator or guardian must use the\r\n  title when endorsing a check.Â  In fact, BOA's Teller Operations Manual and\r\n  Platform Manual conspicuously indicate the best way for employee's to avoid a\r\n  fraud or loss situation is to &quot;know\r\n  your endorser.&quot; \r\nFurthermore, Unrue presented eight checks to BOA indicating\r\n  she was a conservator or co-conservator.Â  The conservator title indicated to\r\n  Yourko and Lawrence that Unrue was court appointed and court documents existed\r\n  that they were required to request and review.Â  However, Unrue never offered\r\n  the court documents or otherwise alerted Yourko or Lawrence to her status as a\r\n  court appointed conservator.Â  Although BOA policy required Unrue to include her\r\n  title when endorsing the checks, she endorsed the checks without including her\r\n  title as conservator.Â  Finally, Travis Powell was not present to negotiate the\r\n  checks that listed him as co-conservator, even though BOA policy required his presence\r\n  to negotiate the checks payable to him and Unrue jointly as co-conservators.\r\nReviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to\r\n  Powell, we find the evidence presented at trial yields more than one inference\r\n  regarding whether BOA should have reasonably foreseen Unrue's actions and the\r\n  theft of Cody's funds in light of the attendant circumstances.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the trial court properly denied BOA's motion for JNOV as to Powell's\r\n  negligence claim.\r\nII.&nbsp; New Trial Motion: BOA's\r\n  Size\r\nBOA argues the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  denying its motion for a new trial because allowing Powell to refer to its size\r\n  during trial unfairly prejudiced BOA.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The grant or denial of new trial motions rests\r\n  within the discretion of the trial [court] and . . . will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal unless [the trial court's] findings are wholly unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by [an] error of law.&quot;Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  &quot;In deciding whether to assess error to a court's denial of a\r\n  motion for a new trial, we must consider the testimony and reasonable\r\n  inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.&quot;Â  Id.Â  This court &quot;reviews Rule 403[, SCRE,] rulings\r\n  pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard and gives great deference to the\r\n  trial court.&quot;Â  Lee v. Bunch, 373 S.C. 654, 658, 647 S.E.2d 197, 199\r\n  (2007).Â  &quot;A trial [court's] decision regarding the comparative probative\r\n  value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  Johnson v. Horry Cnty. Solid Waste Auth., 389 S.C.\r\n  528, 534, 698 S.E.2d 835, 838&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2010) (quoting State v. Adams,\r\n  354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003)) (internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).\r\nInitially, Powell argues this issue is unpreserved\r\n  because BOA failed to contemporaneously object to testimony regarding BOA's\r\n  size.Â  BOA moved in limine to exclude the deposition testimony of\r\n  its designated representative, Floretta Denning.Â  Specifically, BOA objected to\r\n  Denning's statement that BOA is the &quot;third largest bank in the\r\n  world.&quot;Â  The trial court denied BOA's motion.Â  BOA contemporaneously\r\n  objected to Denning's testimony when it was introduced at trial.Â  A bench\r\n  conference was held and the trial court overruled BOA's objection.Â  Later,\r\n  during a recess BOA requested the trial court state the grounds for overruling\r\n  its objection on the record.Â  The trial court explained it found the statement\r\n  was not prejudicial in light of earlier testimony regarding the size of the\r\n  bank where Cody's funds are currently deposited and its policies and\r\n  procedures.Â  During the remainder of trial, several references to BOA's size\r\n  occurred in the jury's presence.Â  We find this issue is preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  BOA was not required to continue objecting to preserve this issue for\r\n  appeal.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 415,\r\n  529 S.E.2d 543, 546-47&nbsp;(2000) (concluding parties are not required\r\n  &quot;to engage in futile actions in order to preserve issues for appellate\r\n  review&quot;).\r\nTurning to the merits, we find BOA's argument is\r\n  misplaced.Â  At trial, BOA was referred to as &quot;big,&quot; &quot;the\r\n  largest&quot; bank in America, and the &quot;third largest bank in the world&quot;\r\n  on several occasions in the jury's presence.Â  These references were brief and isolated\r\n  and occurred only a few times over the course of a four-day trial.Â  We find no prejudice\r\n  in merely referring to BOA as what it is; a big bank.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court properly denied BOA's motion for a new trial on this ground.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\nA.&nbsp; JNOV\r\nBOA argues the trial court erred in denying its motion\r\n  for JNOV on punitive damages because Powell failed to present clear and\r\n  convincing evidence BOA's actions were willful, wanton, or undertaken in\r\n  reckless disregard of Powell's rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to recover punitive damages, the plaintiff must\r\n  present clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's conduct was willful,\r\n  wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-33-135 (2005) (&quot;In any civil action where punitive damages are claimed,\r\n  the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.&quot;); Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 221, 479 S.E.2d 35,\r\n  46&nbsp;(1996).Â  &quot;The test by which a tort is to be characterized as\r\n  reckless, wil[l]ful or wanton is whether it has been committed in such a manner\r\n  or under such circumstances that a person of ordinary reason or prudence would\r\n  then have been conscious of it as an invasion of the plaintiff's rights.&quot;Â  Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 577-78, 106 S.E.2d 258,\r\n  263&nbsp;(1958); see also Berberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 287,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 607, 612 (2011) (quoting Rogers).Â  &quot;It is this present\r\n  consciousness of wrongdoing that justifies the assessment of punitive damages\r\n  against the tort-feasor . . . .&quot;Â  Rogers, 233 S.C. at 578, 106\r\n  S.E.2d at 263.Â  In other words, &quot;at the time of his act or omission to act\r\n  the tort-feasor [must] be conscious, or chargeable with consciousness, of his\r\n  wrongdoing.&quot;Â  Id. at 578, 106 S.E.2d at 264. \r\nWe find the trial court properly denied BOA's motion\r\n  for JNOV on punitive damages.Â  Here, Yourko received training as a personal\r\n  banker in Charlotte, North Carolina on three separate occasions for one week at\r\n  a time.Â  Yourko explained she was trained to employ the policies and procedures\r\n  outlined in BOA's Platform Manual.Â  Yourko also received on-the-job training in\r\n  BOA's policies and procedures from the personal banker she replaced.Â  Lawrence\r\n  received six months training as branch manager.Â  This training included working\r\n  as a teller, personal banker, and training in a banking center manager role.Â  Lawrence\r\n  explained each BOA branch had a Platform Manual available for its employees.Â  BOA\r\n  also had a computer system that provided prompts based upon the Platform Manual\r\n  for its employees to use in conducting business.Â  Furthermore, BOA employees\r\n  had access to a helpline to assist with issues regarding BOA's policies and\r\n  procedures. Â Â Â Â \r\nBOA's Platform Manual defines a conservator as a\r\n  &quot;[c]ourt-appointed individual who: [c]ares for and/or manages the property\r\n  and affairs of a minor or an incapacitated (physically or mentally) adult&quot;\r\n  and notes a conservator may also be referred to as a guardian or curator.Â  A\r\n  conservatorship account is defined as one &quot;[e]stablished by a\r\n  court-appointed guardian, conservator, or curator to manage the funds of a\r\n  ward.&quot;Â  The definitions of guardian, conservator, and curator and guardianship\r\n  account, conservatorship account, and a curatorship are substantively similar.Â \r\n  Opening a conservatorship account requires an original or certified copy of the\r\n  court order appointing the conservator that contains the name of the\r\n  conservator, the name of the ward, a signature of a court official, a certified\r\n  seal or filing stamp, and a statement indicating the conservator is guardian\r\n  over the estate or property of the ward.Â  If the court order indicates an order\r\n  of the court is required for withdrawals, &quot;Court Restricted Account&quot;\r\n  must be included in the title of the account.Â  When a court order contains\r\n  restrictions, the personal banker is required to contact BOA Banking Group\r\n  Support-Legal Support.\r\nWhen a customer presents a check including a payee\r\n  designation with a title such as guardian, conservator, or curator, BOA's\r\n  Teller Operations Manual requires that the payee's authority be verified before\r\n  the check is cashed. Â The endorsement must also include the payee's title.Â  The\r\n  Teller Operations Manual and the Platform Manual both include the warning that\r\n  &quot;When negotiating items, the best way to avoid fraud or a loss situation\r\n  is to 'KNOW YOUR ENDORSER.'&quot;Â  Based on their training and experience, we\r\n  find Yourko and Lawrence are chargeable with knowledge of BOA's policies and\r\n  procedures for establishing a court restricted conservatorship account and\r\n  negotiating checks.Â  \r\nThe court order appointing Unrue and Travis Powell as\r\n  co-conservators required Cody's funds to be deposited in a restricted account\r\n  that required a court order for withdrawals.Â  Unrue received eight checks from\r\n  two insurance companies on behalf of Cody.Â  Unrue presented seven checks to\r\n  Yourko.Â  Two checks designated &quot;Karen and Travis Powell, Co-Cn For\r\n  Minor Cody P.&quot; as the payee. (emphasis added).Â  One check designated\r\n  &quot;T. Powell &amp; K. Powell Co-Conservators For Cody P., A Minor&quot;\r\n  as payee. (emphasis added).Â  Four checks designated &quot;Karen Powell, As Conservator Of Cody P. A Minor&quot; as payee. (emphasis added).Â  Despite the payee\r\n  designations, Yourko opened a CD account titled &quot;Karen M. Unrue Guardian\r\n  [Cody]&quot; without requesting an original or certified copy of the court\r\n  order appointing Unrue as conservator.Â  Assuming Yourko misunderstood the\r\n  conservator title on the checks, the Platform Manual provides that a guardian\r\n  is a court appointed individual who cares for and manages the property of a\r\n  minor or incapacitated adult.Â  Further, establishing a guardianship account also\r\n  required Yourko to request an original or certified copy of the court order\r\n  appointing Unrue. Â \r\nUnrue also presented one check to Lawrence that listed\r\n  the payee as &quot;Karen M. Powell, As Conservator For Cody P. A Minor.&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Lawrence opened a Uniform Gift to Minors Act savings account\r\n  titled &quot;Karen M. Unrue â€“ cust [Cody] UMGA [sic]&quot; also without requesting\r\n  an original or certified copy of the court order appointing Unrue as conservator. \r\n Denning,\r\n  BOA's designated representative, testified the payee designations were clear:\r\n  &quot;They were made out to conservators.Â  There's nothing that was\r\n  misconstrued here.Â  It's obvious who they were made out to.&quot;Â  Denning also\r\n  explained the payee designation on the checks indicated the existence of a\r\n  court order: &quot;[F]rom the beginning she had the checks and on the checks it\r\n  told her who the conservator was and the minor.Â  It stated that on the checks.Â \r\n  When she got ready to open the account, these were court ordered.Â  There were\r\n  other documents that she needed to see.&quot;Â  Furthermore, BOA's designated representative\r\n  Reeves explained Yourko and Lawrence should have requested the court order when\r\n  presented with checks payable to a payee with the title conservator.Â  Finally,\r\n  Hubbs, Powell's expert in banking and banking operations, explained the\r\n  conservator payee designation should have alerted Yourko and Lawrence to the existence\r\n  of court documents that BOA's policies and procedures required to open the\r\n  accounts and negotiate the checks.Â Â  \r\nWe find the evidence presented at trial was sufficient\r\n  to warrant submitting the punitive damages issue to the jury. Considering the evidence\r\n  in a light most favorable to Powell, a person of ordinary reason and prudence\r\n  in Yourko's and Lawrence's position would have known he or she was opening the accounts\r\n  without the safeguards mandated by the court order and in contravention to BOA's\r\n  policies and procedures.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied BOA's\r\n  motion for JNOV on this ground. [4]Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mitchell v. Fortis Analysis\r\nBecause the jury found Unrue's conduct was reasonably\r\n  foreseeable in light of the attendant circumstances and Powell proved BOA's\r\n  conduct was willful, wanton or reckless by clear and convincing evidence, we must\r\n  determine whether the jury's award of punitive damages was constitutionally\r\n  proper using the test articulated by our supreme court in Mitchell v. Fortis\r\n    Insurance Co., 385 S.C. 570, 686 S.E.2d 176 (2009).Â  Applying the Mitchell test, we conclude that it is.Â  Â Â \r\n&quot;Because punitive damages are quasi-criminal in\r\n  nature, the process of assessing punitive damages is subject to the protections\r\n  of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\r\n  Constitution.&quot;Â  James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 194,\r\n  638 S.E.2d 667, 670&nbsp;(2006).Â  The trial court must review\r\n\r\nthe constitutionality of a punitive damages award by\r\n  determining whether the award was reasonable under the following guideposts:\r\n  (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; (2) the\r\n  disparity between the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and\r\n  the amount of the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the\r\n  punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or\r\n  imposed in comparable cases.\r\n\r\nAustin\r\n  v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387\r\n  S.C. 22, 52, 691 S.E.2d 135, 151&nbsp;(2010) (citing Mitchell, 385 S.C.\r\n  at 587-88, 686 S.E.2d at 185-86).Â  This court conducts a de novo review in\r\n  evaluating the constitutionality of a punitive damages award.Â  Mitchell,\r\n  385 S.C. at 583, 686 S.E.2d at 183.Â  \r\nFirst, in examining the reprehensibility of\r\n  defendant's conduct, we &quot;should consider whether: (i) the harm caused was\r\n  physical as opposed to economic; (ii) the tortious conduct evinced an indifference\r\n  to or a reckless disregard for the health or safety of others; (iii) the target\r\n  of the conduct had financial vulnerability; (iv) the conduct involved repeated\r\n  actions or was an isolated incident; and (v) the harm was the result of\r\n  intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, rather than mere accident.&quot;Â  Id. at 587, 686 S.E.2d at 185.Â  Considering these factors, we find BOA's conduct\r\n  evinces a high degree of reprehensibility.Â  Although, the harm Cody suffered\r\n  was economic and not physical, the evidence established Cody was financially\r\n  vulnerable.Â  The misappropriated funds were life insurance proceeds meant to\r\n  compensate Cody for the loss of his father's support.Â  Based upon Yourko's\r\n  admission she knew Unrue was helping take care of Cody after his father was\r\n  killed and the conservator designation on the payee line of the checks, BOA was\r\n  aware of Cody's financial vulnerability.Â  Furthermore, Cody is a special needs\r\n  child who suffers from seizures and uses the funds to pay for medical expenses,\r\n  school supplies, and necessities.Â  \r\nDespite Cody's financial vulnerability and BOA's\r\n  awareness thereof, it failed to set up Cody's accounts with the proper\r\n  safeguards to protect his funds.Â  While BOA's conduct did not evince an\r\n  indifference to or a reckless disregard for Cody's health or safety, it exposed\r\n  Cody to the possibility he might not be able to afford his medical expenses.Â \r\n  Although the harm Cody suffered was not the result of intentional malice,\r\n  trickery, or deceit on BOA's part, we are surprised by the ease with which\r\n  Unrue was able to circumvent BOA's safeguards and defeat the mandate of the court\r\n  order requiring her to deposit Cody's funds in a restricted account.Â  BOA\r\n  blindly followed Unrue's request to open a CD and a UGMA account when presented\r\n  with checks indicating the existence of court process and triggering its\r\n  obligation to request a copy of the court order appointing Unrue.Â  We are also\r\n  surprised by BOA's failure to recognize the significance of the conservator designation\r\n  on the payee line of the checks.Â  For instance, both Yourko and Lawrence failed\r\n  to recognize the significance of the conservator designation despite their\r\n  training in BOA's policies and procedures.Â  Neither requested a copy of the\r\n  court order appointing Unrue.Â  When Yourko handed the checks to the teller to\r\n  process, the teller failed to verify Unrue's authority before cashing the\r\n  checks.Â  The teller also failed to require Unrue to endorse the checks with her\r\n  title.Â  Furthermore, per BOA's Platform Manual a CD is not an eligible product for\r\n  a conservatorship or guardianship account.Â  BOA's &quot;operations area&quot;\r\n  that reviews the activity of the tellers and personal bankers for compliance\r\n  with BOA's safeguards failed to catch the discrepancy between the conservator\r\n  designation on the payee line of the checks and CD account Yourko opened.Â  The\r\n  operations area also allowed the checks to be negotiated without the proper\r\n  endorsements.Â  BOA's conduct involved repeated failures to employ the\r\n  safeguards prescribed to protect Cody's funds.Â  Accordingly, we conclude BOA's\r\n  conduct was sufficiently reprehensible to support a punitive damages award.Â  \r\nNext, we examine the ratio between actual and punitive\r\n  damages.Â  Id. at 587-88, 686 S.E.2d at 185.Â  While there is no concrete\r\n  constitutional limit on the ratio between actual and punitive damages,\r\n  &quot;few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and\r\n  compensatory damages will satisfy due process.&quot;Â  State Farm Mut. Auto.\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 410 (2003).Â  In determining the\r\n  reasonableness of the ratio we may consider (1) the likelihood that the award\r\n  will deter the defendant from like conduct; (2) whether the award is reasonably\r\n  related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; and (3) the defendant's\r\n  ability to pay.Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 588, 686 S.E.2d at 185.Â  In short,\r\n  this court &quot;must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable\r\n  and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general\r\n  damages recovered.&quot;Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 426.Â  \r\nHere, the ratio of punitive to actual damages is 7.69 to\r\n  1, at the high end of the single-digit spectrum.Â  However, it is probable that\r\n  a $1.5 million punitive damages award will deter BOA from like conduct and\r\n  encourage BOA to better train its employees and implement more effective\r\n  safeguards to protect customer's funds.Â  Furthermore, BOA has the ability to\r\n  pay the punitive damage award.Â  The net worth of its shareholder equity as of\r\n  June 30, 2008, four months before trial, was $163 billion.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the award should be reasonably related to\r\n  the harm likely to result from BOA's conduct.Â  Here, the evidence established\r\n  that correctly setting up a conservator account takes approximately one hour.Â  Powell\r\n  introduced evidence of BOA's weekly, daily, and hourly earnings.Â  For instance,\r\n  Dr. Wood, Powell's expert economist, testified BOA earned approximately $258\r\n  million per week, $36.9 million per day, and $1,538,250 per hour.Â  During\r\n  closing argument, Powell asked the jury to punish BOA for the harm caused by BOA's\r\n  failure to properly protect Cody's funds by awarding punitive damages in the\r\n  amount BOA earns in one hourâ€”the amount of time it would have taken to set up\r\n  Cody's accounts with the appropriate safeguards.Â  Powell also argued a $1,538,250\r\n  award would send a message to BOA that it needed to ensure the appropriate\r\n  safeguards are employed to protect their customers' funds.Â  The jury awarded\r\n  Powell 1,583,000 in punitive damages.Â  The consistency between BOA's one\r\n  hour earnings figure and the jury's punitive damages award leads us to the\r\n  conclusion that the punitive damages award is reasonably related to the harm\r\n  Cody suffered as a result of BOA's failure to set up his accounts with the\r\n  appropriate safeguards.Â Â  \r\nWe are mindful that our supreme court recently questioned\r\n  the &quot;propriety of extrapolating financial data&quot; regarding a\r\n  defendant's per week, per day, and per hour income, revenue, and cash flow for determining\r\n  a defendant's ability to pay.Â  Branham v. Ford Motor Co., 390 S.C. 203,\r\n  239-40, 701 S.E.2d 5, 24-25 (2010).Â  In Branham, the plaintiff\r\n  introduced extrapolated per week, per day, and per hour figures of Ford's net\r\n  worth, income, revenues, and cash flow.Â  Id. at 239, 701 S.E.2d at 24.Â \r\n  The Branham court noted this court has found no abuse of discretion in\r\n  the admission of per day earnings, operating revenue, and net income.Â  Id. at 240, 701 S.E.2d at 24; Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 342 S.C. 159,\r\n  170, 536 S.E.2d 380, 386&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (finding the trial court properly\r\n  admitted evidence of the defendant's per day operating revenue and net income); Orangeburg Sausage Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 331, 344, 450\r\n  S.E.2d 66, 74&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994) (finding the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant's per day earnings).Â  However,\r\n  although the court questioned whether Bryant and Orangeburg Sausage would pass constitutional muster after Campbell, it did not overrule\r\n  either case.Â  Branham, 390 S.C. at 239-40, 701 S.E.2d at 24-25.Â  In\r\n  light of the foregoing, we rely on such evidence here only in finding the\r\n  jury's award of punitive damages was reasonably related to the harm Cody\r\n  suffered.\r\nFinally, we consider &quot;the difference between the\r\n  punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or\r\n  imposed in comparable cases.&quot;Â  Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 588-89, 686\r\n  S.E.2d at 186.Â  No authorized civil penalties are applicable here.Â  An\r\n  examination of cases with punitive to actual damages ratios at the high end of\r\n  the single-digit spectrum reveals conduct by the defendant that is highly\r\n  reprehensible.Â  See, e.g.,Â  Austin, 387 S.C. at 55, 691 S.E.2d at\r\n  152 (upholding a punitive to actual damage ratio of 8.21 to 1 when defendant's\r\n  misrepresentations regarding the physical condition of the vehicle purchased by\r\n  the plaintiff evinced a reckless disregard for the health and safety of the plaintiff\r\n  and the general public); Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 594, 686 S.E.2d at 188\r\n  (finding an punitive to actual damage ratio of 9.2 to 1 satisfied due process,\r\n  even though plaintiff's harm was economic, because defendant's actions exposed\r\n  plaintiff to great risk of physical danger); James, 371 S.C. at 197, 638\r\n  S.E.2d at 672 (upholding a punitive to actual damage ratio of 6.82 to 1 when\r\n  defendant's insurance adjuster made repeated false representations that led to\r\n  the denial of plaintiff's insurance claim and plaintiff being sued by a third\r\n  party who was bitten by plaintiff's dog); Collins Entm't Corp. v. Coats\r\n    &amp; Coats Rental Amusement, 355 S.C. 125, 143, 584 S.E.2d 120, 130&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2003) (finding a 9.9 to 1 punitive to actual damage ratio was proper based\r\n  upon defendant's tortious interference with contract); Lister v. Nations\r\n    Bank of Del., N. Am., 329 S.C. 133, 152-53, 494 S.E.2d 449, 460&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1997) (finding a 23 to 1 punitive to actual damages ratio was proper when\r\n  the defendant's licensee made an unauthorized charge of $7,696.63 on\r\n  plaintiff's credit card).Â  We find BOA's conduct here is equally reprehensible\r\n  to the conduct in the above cited cases and conclude the jury's award of punitive\r\n  damages is in accord with punitive damage awards in comparable cases.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn short, BOA's failure to protect Cody's funds with\r\n  the proper safeguards was highly reprehensible.Â  Although the ratio between\r\n  actual and punitive damages is at the high end of the single-digit spectrum, a\r\n  review of comparable cases reveals conduct of a similar degree of\r\n  reprehensibility to BOA's conduct here.Â  The award is reasonable and\r\n  proportionate to the harm Cody suffered and the general damages recovered.Â  Finally,\r\n  BOA has the ability to pay the punitive damage award, which represents less\r\n  than one percent of its net worth.Â  Based on our review of the guideposts\r\n  outlined in Mitchell, we conclude the punitive damages award is\r\n  constitutionally proper.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHuff and Konduros,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The checks were made to payable to Karen Powell,\r\n  Unrue's maiden name.Â  The order appointing Unrue as co-conservator, the\r\n  certificate of appointment, and the fiduciary letter were also in Unrue's\r\n  maiden name.\r\n[2] S.C.

Â Crosby sued Prysmian for\r\n  retaliatory discharge under section 41-1-80 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2011), claiming she was fired for filing a workers' compensation claim.Â  In a\r\n  motion for summary judgment, Crosby asked the circuit court to give preclusive\r\n  effect to the commission's finding and grant summary judgment on Prysmian's\r\n  affirmative defense that the workers' compensation claim was fraudulent.Â  We\r\n  affirm the circuit court's order granting partial summary judgment that the commission's\r\n  finding is preclusive, and hold this affirmative defense fails as a matter of\r\n  law. Â We also affirm the circuit court's order granting summary judgment on\r\n  Prysmian's counterclaims.Â  Further, we do not address Prysmian's argument that\r\n  the commission's finding does not extend to the factual question of whether\r\n  Prysmian acted in good faith and without retaliatory motive because the answer\r\n  to the question cannot affect the outcome of the case.\r\nI.&nbsp; Facts\r\n  and Procedural History\r\nOn\r\n  September 22, 2004, Prysmian hired Crosby to operate machines that colored\r\n  fiber optic cables. Â On January 6, 2005, Crosby made a claim for benefits under\r\n  the Workers' Compensation Act by notifying her supervisor at Prysmian that she\r\n  had injured her right knee on the job the day before.Â  She formalized the claim\r\n  on February 1, 2005, by filing and serving a Form 50 in which she alleged she\r\n  &quot;sustained an accidental injury to her right knee on 1-5-05.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  July 2005, the workers' compensation commission held a hearing on the claim. Â Crosby\r\n  and Prysmian presented conflicting evidence as to whether she was injured on\r\n  the job on January 5. Â Crosby testified that on January 5 while she was\r\n  stringing up a fiber optic line on one machine, an alarm activated on another\r\n  machine.Â  She explained that she hyperextended her right knee as she rushed to\r\n  the other machine to prevent the severance of the fiber optic line.Â  Prysmian\r\n  presented evidence that Crosby did not injure the knee on January 5.Â  First,\r\n  Crosby did not report any injury until the next day.Â  Crosby admitted she hurt the\r\n  same knee on January 2, 2005, but testified she iced the knee and it got better\r\n  before January 5.Â  Crosby testified that she did not report the January 5\r\n  injury immediately because she thought it would get better like it had on\r\n  January 2.Â  Prysmian also presented the testimony of coworkers who observed\r\n  Crosby limping on her right leg as she arrived at work on January 5.Â  Though Crosby\r\n  admitted she was limping, she attributed the limp to blisters on her toes she\r\n  got from wearing high heels at a New Year's Eve church service. Â The single commissioner\r\n  found that Crosby &quot;is a credible witness who sustained an injury to her\r\n  right lower extremity by accident arising out of and in the course of her\r\n  employment on January 5, 2005.&quot;Â  The single commissioner's order was\r\n  affirmed by an appellate panel.Â  Prysmian did not appeal the appellate panel's\r\n  decision and it became the final decision of the commission.\r\nOn\r\n  January 25, 2005, Prysmian notified Crosby that she was fired.Â  The letter Prysmian\r\n  sent to her stated in part:\r\n\r\n  Both [Prysmian]\r\n    and its workers' compensation insurer, American International Group, Inc.\r\n    (&quot;AIG&quot;), have investigated your claim, and determined that your claim\r\n    lacks merit and, [Prysmian] believes, was filed with fraudulent intent.Â  In\r\n    this regard, [Prysmian] has obtained statements from several employees who\r\n    acknowledge that you appeared visibly injured at the time you reported for work\r\n    on January 5, 2005, which indicates that the injury which you allege occurred\r\n    in the course and scope of your work on January 5, 2005, did not, in fact,\r\n    occur during such time.Â  Separately, AIG has conducted an investigation and\r\n    notified [Prysmian] that it is denying your claim for workers' compensation\r\n    benefits based on essentially the same evidence.\r\n  As a result of\r\n    AIG's determination and the statements obtained in the course of [Prysmian]'s\r\n    investigation of your claim, [Prysmian] has decided to terminate your\r\n    employment, effective immediately, for filing a false claim for workers'\r\n    compensation benefits.Â  \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  December 21, 2005, Crosby filed a civil lawsuit against Prysmian for\r\n  retaliatory discharge under section 41-1-80.Â  Prysmian answered and asserted an\r\n  affirmative defense that Crosby &quot;was validly terminated for fraudulently\r\n  filing a workers' compensation claim.&quot;[2] Â Prysmian also asserted counterclaims for breach of the duty of loyalty, gross\r\n  negligence, breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act,\r\n  fraud, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  Crosby filed a motion for summary\r\n  judgment claiming she &quot;is entitled to an order dismissing [Prysmian's]\r\n  counterclaims with prejudice and to an order finding [Prysmian] terminated\r\n  [Crosby's] employment in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim\r\n  as a matter of law.&quot;Â  The circuit court granted Crosby's motion and ordered\r\n  the matter set for trial on damages and equitable relief.Â  \r\nPrysmian\r\n  raises three issues on appeal.Â  First, Prysmian claims the circuit court erred\r\n  in giving preclusive effect to the factual finding of the commission that\r\n  Crosby was injured in the course and scope of employment, and thereby granting\r\n  partial summary judgment to Crosby as to Prysmian's affirmative defense that\r\n  Crosby filed a fraudulent workers' compensation claim.Â  Second, Prysmian argues\r\n  that &quot;even if the [commission's] decision has preclusive effect in this\r\n  case, it does not reach the questions of whether [Prysmian] acted in good faith\r\n  and without a retaliatory motive.&quot;Â  Third, Prysmian claims the circuit\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment as to Prysmian's counterclaims.\r\nII.&nbsp; Standard\r\n  of Review\r\nRule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP, provides that the circuit court shall grant summary judgment if &quot;there\r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\r\n  entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Each of Prysmian's issues\r\n  presents questions of law.Â  We decide questions of law with no deference to the\r\n  lower court.Â  Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C.\r\n  107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008); Catawba Indian Tribe v. State, 372\r\n  S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).Â  Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Retaliatory\r\n  Discharge Claim under Section 41-1-80\r\nIn\r\n  order to recover for retaliatory discharge under section 41-1-80, a plaintiff\r\n  must establish three elements: &quot;1) institution of workers' compensation\r\n  proceedings, 2) discharge or demotion, and 3) a causal connection between the\r\n  first two elements.&quot;Â  Hinton v. Designer Ensembles, Inc., 343 S.C.\r\n  236, 242, 540 S.E.2d 94, 97 (2000) (citing Hines v. United Parcel Serv.,\r\n    Inc., 736 F. Supp. 675, 677 (D.S.C. 1990)).Â  The circuit court granted\r\n  partial summary judgment in favor of Crosby as to liability for retaliatory\r\n  discharge, leaving only the question of damages for the jury.Â  Prysmian\r\n  concedes Crosby satisfied all three elements.[3]Â \r\n  However, Prysmian contends the circuit court's ruling was in error because\r\n  questions of fact remain as to two affirmative defenses.Â  In its first issue on\r\n  appeal, Prysmian argues the circuit court erred by giving preclusive effect to\r\n  the finding of the commission, and thereby granting partial summary judgment to\r\n  Crosby as to Prysmian's affirmative defense that Crosby filed a fraudulent\r\n  workers' compensation claim.Â  We find the circuit court ruled correctly.Â  In\r\n  its second issue on appeal, Prysmian argues the circuit court's ruling should\r\n  not foreclose Prysmian from proving at trial it fired Crosby in good faith and without\r\n  retaliatory motive.Â  We do not address this issue. \r\na.&nbsp;The Preclusive\r\n  Effect of the Commission's Finding\r\nIn Wallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 305 S.C. 118, 121, 406 S.E.2d 358, 360\r\n  (1991), the supreme court recognized an affirmative defense to a section\r\n  41-1-80 claim for &quot;violation of specific written company policies.&quot;Â \r\n  Prysmian asserted this defense based on its &quot;Standards of Conduct,&quot; which\r\n  provide that an employee may be terminated for &quot;acts and behavior which\r\n  are unacceptable,&quot; specifically including: &quot;Filing false claims of\r\n  injury or illness.&quot;Â  In its ruling granting partial summary judgment to\r\n  Crosby, the circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n  Defendant\r\n    Prysmian offers, in defense, that [Crosby] was validly terminated for\r\n    fraudulently filing a workers' compensation claim.Â  The facts support a finding\r\n    that Plaintiff Crosby's filing of a workers' compensation claim was in good\r\n    faith.Â  This Court notes the conclusions of law in the December 5, 2005 Order\r\n    and Report of Commissioner J. Alan Bass of the South Carolina Workers\r\n    Compensation [Commission].Â  (&quot;2.Â  Under Â§ 42-1-160, claimant sustained\r\n    injuries by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.&quot;).[4]Â  \r\n\r\nPrysmian's\r\n  appeal presents us with the question of whether a ruling by the workers'\r\n  compensation commission that the claimant was injured in the course and scope\r\n  of employment is preclusive as to the affirmative defense that the employee\r\n  filed a &quot;false claim of injury.&quot;Â  We hold that it is.\r\nThe\r\n  question of whether the ruling by the workers' compensation commission is\r\n  preclusive is one of issue preclusion, or what has traditionally been called\r\n  collateral estoppel.Â  See In re Crews, 389 S.C. 322, 340, 698\r\n  S.E.2d 785, 794 (2010) (equating issue preclusion and collateral estoppel).Â \r\n  &quot;Collateral estoppel prevents a party from re-litigating an issue in a\r\n  subsequent suit which was actually and necessarily litigated and determined in\r\n  a prior action.&quot;Â  Aaron v. Mahl, 381 S.C. 585, 592, 674 S.E.2d 482,\r\n  486 (2009).Â  Our courts have applied the doctrine of issue preclusion to the\r\n  factual determinations of administrative tribunals.Â  See Bennett v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Corr., 305 S.C. 310, 312, 408 S.E.2d 230, 231 (1991)\r\n  (&quot;This Court has repeatedly held that, under the doctrines of res\r\n    judicata and collateral estoppel, the decision of an administrative\r\n  tribunal precludes the relitigation of the issues addressed by that tribunal in\r\n  a collateral action.&quot;Â  (citing Earle v. Aycock, 276 S.C. 471, 475,\r\n  279 S.E.2d 614, 616 (1981))).Â  However, not every factual determination by an\r\n  administrative agency is entitled to preclusive effect.Â  In Shelton v. Oscar\r\n    Mayer Foods Corp., 325 S.C. 248, 254, 481 S.E.2d 706, 709 (1997), our\r\n  supreme court held that the factual findings of the employment security commission\r\n  are not preclusive in a subsequent action for wrongful discharge.Â  The Shelton court set forth the starting point for analyzing whether a particular agency's\r\n  findings are preclusive: \r\n\r\n  In\r\n    the abstract, there is no legitimate reason to permit a defendant who has\r\n    already thoroughly and vigorously litigated an issue and lost the opportunity\r\n    to relitigate the identical question. . . .Â  The public interest demands an end\r\n    to the litigation of the same issue.Â  Principles of finality, certainty, and\r\n    the proper administration of justice suggest that a decision once rendered\r\n    should stand unless some compelling countervailing consideration necessitates\r\n    relitigation.\r\n\r\n325\r\n  S.C. at 252, 481 S.E.2d at 708 (quoting Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 370,\r\n  315 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 1984)).\r\nIn\r\n  order to determine whether an agency's factual finding is preclusive, we must\r\n  first determine whether the particular finding meets the traditional elements\r\n  of collateral estoppel.Â  We must then examine whether there is some\r\n  countervailing consideration which necessitates relitigation.[5]Â  A party\r\n  claiming preclusive effect under collateral estoppel must demonstrate that the\r\n  particular issue was &quot;(1) actually litigated in the prior action; (2)\r\n  directly determined in the prior action; and (3) necessary to support the prior\r\n  judgment.&quot;Â  Carolina Renewal, 385 S.C. at 554, 684 S.E.2d at 782. \r\nWe\r\n  find that all the elements are met when the commission determines that an\r\n  injury was sustained in the course and scope of employment.Â  The commission\r\n  affords both the claimant and the employer a full and fair opportunity to\r\n  litigate the issue.[6]Â \r\n  The parties are entitled to present witnesses and other evidence, make factual\r\n  and legal arguments, and appeal a ruling they contend was made in error.Â  The\r\n  commission may not award benefits without actually litigating and directly\r\n  determining the factual question of whether the claimant was injured in the\r\n  course and scope of employment, and such a finding is necessary to support a\r\n  judgment awarding benefits.Â  See Ardis v. Combined Ins. Co., 380\r\n  S.C. 313, 320, 669 S.E.2d 628, 632 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;To be compensable, an\r\n  injury by accident must be one 'arising out of and in the course of\r\n  employment.'&quot; (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2007))).Â  In this\r\n  case, the record before us reveals that the issue was hotly contested before\r\n  the commission, and the commission made a specific finding that &quot;claimant\r\n  sustained injuries by accident arising out of and in the course of\r\n  employment.&quot;Â  Thus, Crosby has established the three elements of\r\n  collateral estoppel.Â  \r\nPrysmian\r\n  makes several arguments that countervailing considerations necessitate\r\n  relitigation of the commission's finding.Â  We find none of the arguments\r\n  persuasive, and no unfairness or injustice will result from the application of\r\n  issue preclusion to this situation.[7]Â \r\n  First, Prysmian argues that the public policy of liberally construing the\r\n  Workers' Compensation Act and resolving doubts in favor of coverage is a\r\n  countervailing reason necessitating relitigation.Â  We disagree.Â  We believe the\r\n  public policy cited by Prysmian actually favors protecting an injured worker\r\n  from retaliation for filing a claim the commission finds to be work-related.Â  See Horn v. Davis Elec. Constructors, Inc., 302 S.C. 484, 491, 395 S.E.2d\r\n  724, 728 (Ct. App. 1990) (applying &quot;the policy of this state that injured\r\n  employees be fully compensated for their work-related injuries&quot; to a\r\n  retaliatory discharge claim under section 41-1-80).Â  Second, Prysmian argues\r\n  that giving preclusive effect to the finding of the commission interferes with\r\n  this court's scope of review in a retaliatory discharge case, which allows an\r\n  appellate court to find facts according to its own view of the evidence.Â  See Hinton, 343 S.C. at 242, 540 S.E.2d at 96 (&quot;In reviewing a\r\n  retaliatory discharge claim, the appellate court may find facts in\r\n  accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot; (citing Wallace,\r\n  305 S.C. at 120, 406 S.E.2d at 359)).Â  We disagree with this argument as well.Â \r\n  Our scope of review requires us to independently evaluate evidence which has\r\n  been presented to a circuit court in a retaliatory discharge trial, but it does\r\n  not allow us to reconsider a factual finding of the commission after the\r\n  question has been fully litigated.[8]\r\nPrysmian\r\n  makes two other arguments of countervailing considerations.Â  First, Prysmian\r\n  contends the General Assembly would have given the commission authority to\r\n  decide retaliatory discharge claims or it would have included such a provision\r\n  in section 41-1-80 if it intended the commission's findings to be preclusive.Â \r\n  Second, Prysmian argues that our holding makes unsuccessful workers'\r\n  compensation claims preclusive, which would be contrary to the legislative\r\n  intent of section 41-1-80.Â  We find no merit in either argument.Â  As to the\r\n  second argument, our holding does not require that a finding by the commission\r\n  that an injury is not work-related be given preclusive effect.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  as to Prysmian's first issue on appeal, we find the circuit court properly gave\r\n  preclusive effect to the factual finding of the commission that Crosby was\r\n  injured in the course and scope of employment.Â  Applying that factual finding\r\n  to this case, we affirm the circuit court's decision to grant summary judgment\r\n  to Crosby on Prysmian's defense that Crosby filed a fraudulent workers'\r\n  compensation claim.\r\nb.&nbsp; Prysmian's Good\r\n  Faith or Retaliatory Motive\r\nIn\r\n  its second issue on appeal,[9] Prysmian argues &quot;even if the [commission's] decision has preclusive effect\r\n  in this case, it does not reach the questions of whether [Prysmian] acted in\r\n  good faith and without a retaliatory motive.&quot;Â  We do not address this\r\n  issue.Â  Even if it is possible to make a retaliatory discharge in good faith, the\r\n  question of whether Prysmian acted in good faith or without retaliatory motive\r\n  has no legal significance to Crosby's retaliatory discharge claim.Â  Prysmian's\r\n  letter to Crosby states unequivocally that she was fired because she filed a\r\n  workers' compensation claim.Â  The commission's finding establishes Crosby filed\r\n  the claim in good faith.Â  It is not a defense that Prysmian may have mistakenly\r\n  believed her claim to be false or fraudulent.Â  Section 41-1-80 lists the\r\n  affirmative defenses available to an employer.Â  Each one focuses on the conduct\r\n  of the employee, and none relates in any way to whether the employer acted in\r\n  good faith or without retaliatory motive.Â  See City\r\n    of Rock Hill v. Harris, 391 S.C. 149, 154, 705 S.E.2d 53, 55\r\n  (2011) (citing &quot;the\r\n  canon of [statutory] construction . . . that to express or include one thing\r\n  implies the exclusion of another&quot;) (citation and internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted)).Â \r\n  Thus, Prysmian's good faith or lack of retaliatory motive is not relevant to\r\n  Crosby's claim.Â  \r\nc.&nbsp; Other Issues\r\n  Argued by Prysmian\r\nPrysmian\r\n  argues it has other valid defenses for Crosby's alleged violations of company\r\n  policy.Â  For example, Prysmian claims Crosby violated company policy by not\r\n  reporting her January 5, 2005, injury &quot;immediately.&quot; Â In this\r\n  respect, Prysmian's company policy[10] is in conflict with the Workers' Compensation Act, which provides that an\r\n  employee shall give notice &quot;immediately on the occurrence of an accident,\r\n  or as soon thereafter as practicable.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985). Â This\r\n  section, which has been amended since Crosby was injured,[11] allows a\r\n  maximum of ninety days in which to give notice, but even then permits benefits\r\n  to be awarded if &quot;reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the\r\n  Commission for not giving such notice and the Commission is satisfied that the\r\n  employer has not been prejudiced thereby.&quot;Â  Id.Â  While Prysmian may\r\n  be free to terminate an employee for violating company policy, it may not\r\n  assert such a violation as a basis to defend a retaliatory discharge claim under\r\n  section 41-1-80 if the policy the employee violated conflicts with the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Act.Â  If an employer contends the employee violated the Act in\r\n  this or in some other manner, it may assert that violation to the commission.\r\nPrysmian\r\n  also argues that the language &quot;indicates&quot; in the circuit court's\r\n  ruling shows it used the wrong standard for summary judgment.Â  In light of our\r\n  ruling, we do not specifically address this argument.Â  However, our review of\r\n  the circuit court's order leads us to believe the court was well aware that it\r\n  could grant summary judgment only when &quot;there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact . . . ,&quot; Rule 56(c), SCRCP, and thus it used the correct\r\n  standard.\r\nIV.&nbsp;Prysmian's\r\n  Counterclaims\r\nPrysmian\r\n  asserted seven counterclaims to Crosby's retaliatory discharge claim.Â  The\r\n  trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of Crosby with regard to the\r\n  counterclaims.Â  Each of the counterclaims arises exclusively out of one of the\r\n  following two events: (1) Crosby's filing of the workers' compensation claim,\r\n  or (2) Prysmian's decision to fire Crosby because she filed a false claim.Â \r\n  Prysmian alleges damages resulting solely from one of those two events.Â  An\r\n  employer simply cannot recover damages against an employee for filing a good\r\n  faith workers' compensation claim.Â  We hold as a matter of law that an employer\r\n  may not prevail in a retaliatory discharge action on a counterclaim for damages\r\n  which arise only from the filing of a workers' compensation claim or the\r\n  employer's decision to fire the plaintiff for filing the claim.Â  Prysmian's\r\n  counterclaims were properly dismissed because Prysmian alleged no actionable\r\n  damages caused by Crosby's conduct. \r\nV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's order isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J.: concurring in part and dissenting in part:Â  I concur with\r\n  the majority in affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment on\r\n  Prysmian's counterclaims.Â  However, I respectfully dissent with the portion of\r\n  the majority's opinion that affirms the trial court's application of collateral\r\n  estoppel in a retaliatory discharge action pursuant to section 41-1-80.\r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of collateral estoppel, the majority concludes &quot;[N]o\r\n  unfairness or injustice will result from the application of issue preclusion to\r\n  this situation.&quot;Â  I respectfully disagree.Â  The &quot;countervailing\r\n  considerations&quot; presented in this case necessitate relitigation.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  I note the dichotomy regarding the application of preclusion doctrines in the\r\n  context of administrative tribunals between Bennett v. South Carolina Department\r\n    of Corrections., 305 S.C. 310, 408 S.E.2d 230 (1991), and Shelton v.\r\n      Oscar Mayer Foods, 325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d 706 (1997).\r\nIn Bennett, Bennett filed a grievance complaint with the State Employee\r\n  Grievance Committee (Grievance Committee) challenging his discharge from the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC).Â  Bennett, 305 S.C. at\r\n  311, 408 S.E.2d at 231.Â  The Grievance Committee denied Bennett's complaint and\r\n  Bennett failed to appeal.Â  Id.Â  Bennett then filed a retaliatory\r\n  discharge claim pursuant to section 41-1-80.Â  Id.Â  The SCDC moved for\r\n  summary judgment, claiming the Grievance Committee's decision precluded Bennett's\r\n  retaliatory discharge claim under the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res\r\n  judicata.Â  Id.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of\r\n  SCDC on the grounds of collateral estoppel and res judicata and also held\r\n  Bennett failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.Â  Id. at 312, 408\r\n  S.E.2d at 231.Â Â  On appeal, our supreme court affirmed the trial court and\r\n  held:\r\n\r\n  The doctrines of res judicata and\r\n    collateral estoppel do not bar recovery under S.C. Code section 41-1-80 for\r\n    state employees, but they do bar relitigation of issues which have been decided\r\n    by or should have been presented to the State Grievance Committee.Â  The\r\n    statutory requirements that state employees bring their grievances before the\r\n    State Grievance Committee and that they exhaust their administrative remedies\r\n    before seeking judicial review do not bar the bringing of an action under S.C.\r\n    Code Â§ 41-1-80, but they do require that the Grievance Committee have the\r\n    exclusive right to decide those issues subject only to an appeal for judicial\r\n    review of their decisions.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 313, 408\r\n  S.E.2d at 231-32.Â  \r\nIn Shelton, our supreme court addressed the issue of whether findings of\r\n  fact made during a South Carolina Employment Security Commission (ESC) hearing\r\n  were entitled to a preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral\r\n  estoppel.Â  325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d 706.Â  In Shelton, a security guard\r\n  observed Shelton smoking marijuana in the company's parking lot, and as a\r\n  result, Shelton was allegedly discharged without further investigation.Â  Shelton,\r\n  325 S.C. at 250, 481 S.E.2d at 707.Â  Shelton filed and received unemployment\r\n  benefits after an ESC hearing officer found he was discharged without cause.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Shelton's former employer did not appeal the ESC's decision.Â  Id.Â  \r\nShelton\r\n  initiated a wrongful termination action.Â  Shelton, 325 S.C. at 250, 481\r\n  S.E.2d at 707.Â  Based on the ESCâ€™s finding, Shelton moved for partial summary\r\n  judgment, claiming his employer was collaterally estopped from litigating\r\n  whether he was discharged for smoking marijuana.Â  Id.Â  The trial court\r\n  denied Shelton's motion for\r\n  partial summary judgment.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, this court initially reversed\r\n  the trial court's ruling but\r\n  ultimately affirmed after rehearing the matter.Â  Id. at 250-51, 481\r\n  S.E.2d at 707.Â  Our supreme court affirmed and held, &quot;The purposes of the ESC are in conflict\r\n  with the doctrine of collateral estoppel; therefore, public policy dictates the\r\n  findings made during an ESC hearing should not receive collateral estoppel\r\n  effect.&quot;Â  Id. at 252, 481\r\n  S.E.2d at 708.Â  \r\nIn a footnote, our\r\n  supreme court distinguished Bennett, and stated: \r\n\r\n  Bennett dealt with the\r\n    application of collateral estoppel to a proceeding before the State Employee\r\n    Grievance Committee.Â  Bennett filed a complaint with the grievance committee\r\n    and the grievance committee ruled in favor of the employer.Â  Instead of\r\n    appealing this decision through the proper administrative channels, Bennett\r\n    filed a civil suit alleging he was discharged in retaliation for filing a\r\n    workers' compensation claim.Â  This Court held the circuit court properly\r\n    granted the employer's summary judgment motion because the issues in Bennett's\r\n    civil claim were identical to the issues presented to and ruled upon by the\r\n    grievance committee.Â  Bennett had abandoned any opportunity for a ruling on\r\n    these issues in his favor when he failed to appeal the grievance committee's\r\n    findings.Â  Bennett is distinguishable from the matter, sub judice.Â \r\n    State employees must bring complaints before the grievance committee prior to\r\n    seeking judicial review; therefore, the hearing before the grievance committee\r\n    is necessarily more in the nature of a full evidentiary hearing.Â  An ESC\r\n    hearing only determines the narrow issue of whether an employee may receive\r\n    unemployment benefits.\r\n\r\nBennett, 325 S.C. at\r\n  251, 481 S.E.2d at 708.Â  \r\nNext,\r\n  our supreme court discussed the purpose of an ESC hearing is to expeditiously\r\n  provide benefits for employees who became unemployed through no fault of their\r\n  own, and the ESC's jurisdiction is limited to whether an employee is qualified\r\n  to unemployment benefits.Â  Id. at 252, 481 S.E.2d at 708. Thus, the\r\n  supreme court opined collateral estoppel in the ESC context would transform these\r\n  hearings into a forum of lengthy civil litigation of claims relating to the\r\n  employee's discharge.Â  Id.Â  Finally, the supreme court concluded employers\r\n  generally do not intensely contest ESC hearings and stated: \r\n\r\n  Employers\r\n    normally are not compelled to intensely contest ESC hearings because the stakes\r\n    are not great in such hearings. An ESC hearing only determines whether an\r\n    employee was discharged for cause and thus disqualified from receiving\r\n    unemployment benefits. A wrongful termination lawsuit determines whether the\r\n    employer wrongfully discharged the employee and seeks to place blame on the\r\n    employer. The damages available in a wrongful discharge lawsuit are much\r\n    greater than unemployment benefits. Thus, an employer has more incentive to\r\n    fully contest a civil suit.\r\n\r\nId. at 253, 481\r\n  S.E.2d at 708.Â Â  \r\nAlthough,\r\n  a workers' compensation hearing is more akin to a full evidentiary hearing,\r\n  collateral estoppel is inapplicable to this case.Â  Similar to the ESC context,\r\n  our State's workers' compensation laws were enacted by our General Assembly to\r\n  provide benefits to individuals.Â  Specifically, the purpose of our workers'\r\n  compensation scheme is to protect workers who have suffered injuries arising\r\n  out of and in the course of their employment.Â  Parker v. Williams &amp;\r\n    Madjanik, Inc., 275 S.C. 65, 69-70, 267 S.E.2d 524, 526 (1980) (stating our\r\n  workers' compensation laws reflect a societal recognition to provide swift and\r\n  sure compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment); see also Peay\r\n    v. U.S. Silica Co.,&nbsp;\r\n  313 S.C. 91, 94, 437 S.E.2d 64, 65&nbsp;(1993) (&quot;Workers' compensation\r\n  laws were intended by the Legislature to relieve workers of the uncertainties\r\n  of a trial for damages by providing sure, swift recovery for workplace injuries\r\n  regardless of fault.&quot;).Â  This principle was aptly noted in Cokeley v.\r\n    Robert Lee, Inc., 197 S.C. 157, 168, 14 S.E.2d 889, 893-894 (1941), in\r\n  which our supreme court stated: \r\n\r\n  Compensation laws constitute a form of\r\n    social legislation and were enacted primarily for the benefit, protection and\r\n    welfare of working men and their dependents, to relieve them of the uncertainties of a trial in a suit for\r\n    damages, to cast upon the industry in which they are employed a share of the\r\n    burden resulting from industrial accidents, and to prevent the burden of\r\n    injured employees and their dependents becoming charges on society. \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  addition to the public policy underpinnings of workers' compensation law, the\r\n  claimant-friendly inferences drawn in the workers' compensation context will unduly\r\n  bind the trial court in subsequent retaliatory discharge actions.Â  It is\r\n  axiomatic that workers' compensation\r\n  laws are to be liberally construed\r\n  in favor of coverage in order to serve the beneficent purpose of the Act and to\r\n  avoid any incongruous or harsh results. See Cokeley, 197 S.C. at 169,\r\n  14 S.E.2d at 894; see also Pelfrey v. Oconee Cnty., 207 S.C. 433,\r\n  440, 36 S.E.2d 297, 300 (1945) (&quot;Where employer and employee are subject\r\n  to the compensation act, . . . an injured employee should not be excluded from\r\n  the benefits of the law upon the ground that the accident did not arise out of\r\n  and in the course of his employment when there is substantial doubt . . . of\r\n  the propriety of such conclusion.&quot;).Â  Applying collateral estoppel from\r\n  the workers' compensation context to a retaliatory discharge action will bind\r\n  the trial court to a liberal construction doctrine, which favors the inclusion\r\n  of injured employees.Â  Thus, an issue decided in a workers' compensation\r\n  hearing, which must be construed in favor of the claimant, will result in the\r\n  trial court being bound to apply this finding in a separate and distinct\r\n  retaliatory discharge action.Â  As a result, the application of collateral\r\n  estoppel will significantly conflict with the trial court's purview in\r\n  independently determining the merits of a retaliatory discharge claim pursuant\r\n  to section 41-1-80. \r\nFurther,\r\n  the workers' compensation commission is a forum of limited jurisdiction because\r\n  it determines the compensability of an injury arising out of and in the course\r\n  of employment.Â  The imposition of collateral estoppel from a forum that only\r\n  decides such a narrow issue will force employers and employees to fully\r\n  litigate ancillary civil claims due to the majority's holding.Â  Therefore, I\r\n  believe the workers' compensation commission is not the appropriate forum to\r\n  determine whether a claimant filed a claim in good faith for purposes of\r\n  section 41-1-80.Â  This point is further underscored because a retaliatory\r\n  discharge action under section 41-1-80 is not actionable in a workers'\r\n  compensation proceeding. See Hinton v. Designer Ensembles, Inc.,&nbsp;343\r\n  S.C. 236, 242, 540 S.E.2d 94, 96&nbsp;(2000) (&quot;A retaliatory discharge\r\n  claim is an equity action tried without a jury.&quot;).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  a workers' compensation proceeding determines whether a claimant has\r\n  suffered a compensable claim arising out of and in the course of employment.Â \r\n  On the other hand, a retaliatory discharge action determines whether the\r\n  employer wrongfully discharged an employee for filing a workers' compensation\r\n  claim in good faith.Â  Similar to the reasoning expressed in Bennett, I\r\n  believe due to the nature of the workers' compensation proceedings that\r\n  applying collateral estoppel prevents the employer from having an opportunity\r\n  to fully contest the retaliatory discharge action.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  I would hold collateral estoppel from the workers' compensation context is\r\n  inapplicable to a retaliatory discharge action under section 41-1-80.\r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand this\r\n  matter for trial.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prysmian\r\n  Communications Cables and Systems USA is the successor to Pirelli\r\n  Communications Cables and Systems North America.Â  While this cause of action\r\n  arose before Prysmian succeeded Pirelli, we will refer to Pirelli as Prysmian\r\n  for the purposes of this opinion.\r\n[2] Prysmian's\r\n  answer contains fourteen defenses, three affirmative defenses, and seven\r\n  counterclaims.Â  The quoted language is from the circuit court's order granting\r\n  summary judgment, not from Prysmian's answer.Â  The parties appear to agree that\r\n  the affirmative defense for filing a fraudulent claim is contained in what\r\n  Prysmian termed its &quot;tenth defense, third affirmative defense, and third\r\n  counterclaim&quot; entitled &quot;Statutory Defense pursuant to Â§\r\n  41-1-80.&quot;Â  \r\n[3] In our original\r\n  opinion in this appeal, we stated Prysmian conceded only the first and second\r\n  elements, but challenged the third.Â  In its return to Crosby's petition for\r\n  rehearing, Prysmian stated it did not argue the point we addressed as to the\r\n  third element, and that our ruling in Prysmian's favor on that basis was\r\n  &quot;improper.&quot;Â  This statement leaves Prysmian with no basis on which to\r\n  challenge the existence of the third element, and thus we hold that Prysmian\r\n  has conceded the existence of all three.\r\n[4] Prysmian also\r\n  contends the language &quot;support&quot; shows the circuit court used the\r\n  wrong standard for summary judgment.Â  However, we decide this issue as one of\r\n  law, and therefore we do not need to address the contention that the court used\r\n  the wrong factual standard.\r\n[5] Under a\r\n  standard issue preclusion analysis, &quot;even if all the elements for collateral estoppel are met, when unfairness or injustice results or public\r\n  policy requires it, courts may refuse to apply it.&quot;Â  Carolina Renewal,\r\n    Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 550, 555, 684 S.E.2d 779, 782 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).\r\n[6] &quot;The\r\n  doctrine may not be invoked unless the precluded party has had a full and fair\r\n  opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action.&quot;Â  Zurcher v.\r\n    Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 135, 666 S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008).Â  \r\n[7] In Shelton,\r\n  the supreme court discussed the &quot;countervailing considerations&quot; that\r\n  necessitated relitigation of the question that had been determined by the\r\n  employment security commission.Â  325 S.C. at 252, 481 S.E.2d at 708.Â  We find Shelton to be distinguishable because of the numerous differences between proceedings\r\n  in the employment security commission and the workers' compensation\r\n  commission.Â  The Shelton court noted several points as to which\r\n  employment security commission hearings are inconsistent with the doctrine of\r\n  collateral estoppel.Â  325 S.C. at 252-53, 481 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Those points are\r\n  not applicable to the workers' compensation commission.Â  The court concluded\r\n  &quot;public policy dictates the findings made during an ESC hearing should not\r\n  receive collateral estoppel effect.&quot;Â  325 S.C. at 252, 481 S.E.2d at 708.\r\n[8] Other states\r\n  have similarly held that the findings of a workers' compensation commission may\r\n  be given preclusive effect.Â  See, e.g., Frederick v. Action Tire Co.,\r\n  744 A.2d 762, 767 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1999) (&quot;Pennsylvania appellate courts\r\n  have consistently held findings in workers' compensation cases may bar\r\n  relitigation of identical issues in collateral civil actions, even third party\r\n  tort actions.&quot;); Westman v.

Neal, III, of Columbia, for\r\n  Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: Ryan Conard (Father) appeals the family court's\r\n  decision regarding custody, a restraining order, and attorney's fees in this\r\n  relocation case.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Virginia McComb (Mother) met in 2001, when\r\n  both were living in Columbia.Â  At the time, Mother was nineteen years old and a\r\n  student a Midlands Technical College.Â  Father was about the same age and a\r\n  student at the University of South Carolina.Â  In August 2002, Mother discovered\r\n  she was pregnant.Â  On March 28, 2003, their daughter (Child) was born.Â  Mother\r\n  and Child lived with Mother's father (Grandfather).Â  Mother and Father\r\n  continued to date and eventually became engaged.\r\nIn December 2004, the parties ended their relationship\r\n  due to several issues.Â  Following Father's graduation from college, he moved to\r\n  Rock Hill for a job in Charlotte in the summer of 2005.Â  For much of the time\r\n  after he moved, Father had custody of Child Thursday evening through Sunday\r\n  morning by mutual agreement of the parties.Â  Father would travel to Columbia\r\n  when he had custody of Child and stay in a house he owned there.[1]Â  \r\nIn the fall of 2006, Mother informed Father she wanted\r\n  to move to Florida once she graduated from the University of South Carolina in\r\n  May 2007.Â  She intended to live with her mother and stepfather until she could\r\n  get established there.Â  Mother believed her employment opportunities in Florida\r\n  exceeded those in Columbia because she was eligible to teach school in Florida\r\n  but not South Carolina.\r\nOn December 20, 2006, Mother filed an action seeking\r\n  sole custody of Child, child support, and attorney's fees.Â  Father filed an\r\n  answer and counterclaim contending it would not be in Child's best interest to\r\n  move to Florida.Â  He requested sole or joint custody, with Child remaining in\r\n  South Carolina and both parties contributing to her support.\r\nA few weeks before trial, Mother married Gurpreet\r\n  Khalsa (Stepfather).Â  At trial, Stepfather testified he is a financial advisor\r\n  at Smith Barney in Orlando, Florida and prior to that he was a professional\r\n  musician earning a substantial salary.Â Â  He has owned a large home in an upper-middle\r\n  class subdivision for almost ten years.Â  Mother testified because she was\r\n  qualified to teach in Florida but not in South Carolina, her beginning pay\r\n  range in Florida would be far greater than her earning capacity in Columbia.Â  Mother\r\n  and Stepfather testified they intended for Child to attend a private\r\n  school within walking distance of Stepfather's home. Â Stepfather also indicated\r\n  Child had already made friends in the neighborhood.Â  The Guardian ad\r\n  Litem (GAL) recommended awarding Mother custody but qualified it as a\r\n  &quot;lukewarm recommendation.&quot;Â  He based his recommendation on the fact\r\n  that Mother had been Child's primary caregiver.\r\nThe family court granted the parties joint legal\r\n  custody and permitted Mother to take Child with her to Florida to live with her\r\n  and Stepfather.Â  The family court found Father earned a gross monthly income of\r\n  $6,108 a month from his employment and his interest on a trust.Â  The family\r\n  court also provided for Father to have visitation and pay child support.Â \r\n  Additionally, the family court ordered Father pay attorney's fees of $20,995.02\r\n  to Mother's attorney.Â  The family court also restrained the parties from having\r\n  Child &quot;on an overnight basis in the presence of an adult party of the\r\n  opposite sex to whom the parties are not related by blood or marriage, or any\r\n  individual with whom he or she is romantically involved.&quot;\r\nFather filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  Following a hearing, the family court orally ruled it was\r\n  granting Father's motion.Â  Mother filed a motion to reopen the hearing and\r\n  vacate the oral order.Â  Following another hearing, the family court issued an\r\n  order denying Mother's motion to reopen but also denying Father's motion for\r\n  reconsideration, thereby reversing its oral order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court reviews decisions of\r\n  the family court de novo.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 390, 709 S.E.2d\r\n  650, 655 (2011).Â  The appellate court generally defers to the factual findings\r\n  of the family court regarding credibility because the family court is in a\r\n  better position to observe the witness and his or her demeanor.Â  Id. at\r\n  391, 709 S.E.2d at 655. Â The party contesting the family court's decision bears\r\n  the burden of demonstrating the family court's factual findings are not\r\n  supported by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Custody\r\nFather argues the family court erred in giving Mother custody of Child\r\n  for several reasons.Â  Specifically, he contends the family court erred in\r\n  considering the Latimer[2] factors instead of the\r\n  best interests of Child.Â  Additionally, he maintains the family court incorrectly\r\n  applied the tender years doctrine because it has been abolished in South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Further, he contends the family court erred in failing to conclude\r\n  it was in Child's best interest to remain in South Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  a child custody case, the welfare of the child and what\r\n  is in the child's best interest is the primary, paramount, and controlling\r\n  consideration of the\r\n  court.Â  Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103-04 (2003).Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court considers several factors in determining the best\r\n  interest of the child, including: who has been the primary caretaker; the\r\n  conduct, attributes, and fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties\r\n  (including GAL, expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and\r\n  sex of the children.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPatel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d 386, 388 (2001). Â Although a\r\n  parent's morality is a proper factor for consideration, it is only relevant if\r\n  it either directly or indirectly affects the welfare of the child. Davenport\r\n    v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975). &quot;Custody of a child is not granted [to] a party as a reward or\r\n  withheld as a punishment.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n&quot;Cases involving the relocation of a custodial\r\n  parent present some of the knottiest and most disturbing problems that our\r\n  courts are called upon to resolve.&quot;Â  Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449,\r\n  453, 517 S.E.2d 220, 222&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).Â \r\n  In determining whether to allow a custodial parent to\r\n  relocate with a minor child, our supreme court &quot;has stated we are\r\n  no longer to be guided by the presumption against relocation, and should\r\n  instead focus on the children's best interests.&quot;Â  Walrath v. Pope,\r\n  384 S.C. 101, 105, 681 S.E.2d 602, 605&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (citing Latimer,\r\n  360 S.C. at 381, 602 S.E.2d at 34-35).Â  &quot;[B]ecause '[f]orcing a person to\r\n  live in a particular area encroaches upon the liberty of an individual to live\r\n  in the place of his or her choice,' the court's authority to prohibit an out-of-state move 'should be\r\n  exercised sparingly.'&quot;Â  Rice, 335 S.C. at 453-54, 517 S.E.2d at 222\r\n  (quoting VanName v. VanName, 308 S.C. 516, 519, 419 S.E.2d 373, 374 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1992)) (second alteration by court).Â  &quot;[T]he question of whether\r\n  relocation will be allowed requires a determination of whether the relocation\r\n  is in the best interest of the children, the primary consideration in all child\r\n  custody cases.&quot;Â  Id. at 454, 517 S.E.2d at 222.\r\nIn Rice,\r\n  this court found that although it was not &quot;a\r\n  true relocation case,&quot; cases involving the relocation of custodial parents\r\n  were helpful in determining whether it was in the children's best interest to\r\n  require them and their mother to move back to South Carolina. Â Id. at 456,\r\n  517 S.E.2d at 224.Â Â  The court found, &quot;one of the primary concerns in most\r\n  true relocation casesâ€”the need to maintain a relationship with the\r\n  non-custodial parentâ€”is also of great importance in this case.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The court further noted &quot;South Carolina case law provides little guidance\r\n  as to how a court should determine whether an out-of-state move is in the best\r\n  interest of the children.&quot; Id.\r\n\r\n&quot;[A] determination of the best interest of the\r\n  children is an inherently case-specific and fact-specific inquiry.&quot;Â  Id. at 458, 517 S.E.2d at 225. Â What Father refers to as the Latimer factors\r\n  were summarized by this court in Walrath:\r\n\r\n[O]ur [s]upreme [c]ourt has acknowledged, without\r\n  endorsing or specifically approving, factors other states consider when making\r\n  this determination. Â For example, our [s]upreme [c]ourt stated the New York\r\n  Court of Appeals looks at (1) each parent's reason for seeking or opposing the\r\n  relocation; (2) the relationship between the children and each parent; (3) the\r\n  impact of the relocation on the quality of the children's future contact with\r\n  the non-custodial parent; (4) the economic, emotional, and educational\r\n  enhancements of the move; and (5) the feasibility of preserving the children's\r\n  relationship with the non-custodial parent through visitation arrangements. Additionally,\r\n  our [s]upreme [c]ourt noted Pennsylvania courts require the following\r\n  considerations in relocation cases: (1) the economic and other potential\r\n  advantages of the move; (2) the likelihood the move would substantially improve\r\n  the quality of life for the custodial parent and the children and is not the\r\n  result of a whim of the custodial parent; (3) the motives behind the parent's\r\n  reasons for seeking or opposing the move; and (4) the availability of a\r\n  realistic substitute visitation arrangement that will adequately foster an\r\n  ongoing relationship between the non-custodial parent and the children.\r\n\r\n384 S.C. at\r\n  106, 681 S.E.2d at 605 (citations omitted).\r\nAlthough this is not the typical relocation case in\r\n  which a parent who has custody seeks to move with the child, the same analysis\r\n  should apply.Â  Therefore, the Latimer factors are relevant to this\r\n  case.Â  As our courts have often noted, the primary factor in child custody\r\n  cases is always the best interests of the child.Â  Mother has been Child's\r\n  primary caregiver since her birth.Â  Mother sought the move to Florida based on\r\n  her belief that she would have better opportunities to obtain a job in her\r\n  desired field.Â  Further, her husband lives there and also has meaningful\r\n  employment there.Â  Mother also lived in Florida until the tenth grade and has\r\n  family members and friends there, including her mother.Â  Moreover, Father has\r\n  the means to travel to Florida to continue seeing Child the same amount he did\r\n  when she lived in Columbia.Â  Mother has made Child available for phone calls\r\n  and video conferencing and the GAL recommended Mother have custody.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find the family court did base its decision on the best interests of Child.Â \r\n  Additionally, nothing indicates the family court relied on the tender years\r\n  doctrine in making its decision.Â  Based on the facts in this case, the family\r\n  court did not err in allowing Child to move to Florida with Mother.\r\nII.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nFather maintains the family court erred in awarding\r\n  Mother attorney's fees because she was not the prevailing party.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has discretion in\r\n  deciding whether to award attorney's fees. Â Donahue v. Donahue,\r\n  299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989); see also Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 394, 709 S.E.2d 650, 656\r\n  (2011) (&quot;[T]he decision\r\n  to award attorney fees [] rests within the sound discretion of the family\r\n  court.).Â  In deciding whether to award attorney's fees, the family court should\r\n  consider (1) each party's ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial\r\n  results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial\r\n  conditions; and (4) the effect of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  Patel\r\n    v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining\r\n  reasonable attorney's fees, the six factors the family court should consider\r\n  are &quot;(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time\r\n  necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; [and] (6)\r\n  customary legal fees for similar services.&quot;Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock,\r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nThe family court did not err in awarding attorney's\r\n  fees or in the amount of attorney's fees it awarded.Â  It considered all of the\r\n  appropriate factors and stated why those factors supported awarding Mother\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  The record contains evidence to support each of the family\r\n  court's findings.Â  In essence, although Mother did not receive sole custody, she\r\n  prevailed on the issues.Â  Mother sought to move with Child to Florida, child\r\n  support, and attorney's fees and she received all of this.Â  Further, Father has\r\n  the ability to pay the fees.Â  Because the evidence in the record supports the\r\n  family court's findings as to attorney's fees, the family court was within its\r\n  discretion in awarding attorney's fees and calculating the amount. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Oral Order\r\nFather argues the family court erred in\r\n  reversing its oral order granting the motion for reconsideration.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Until written and entered, the trial judge\r\n  retains discretion to change his mind and amend his oral ruling\r\n  accordingly.&quot;Â  Ford v. State Ethics Comm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545\r\n  S.E.2d 821, 823&nbsp;(2001); see also Bowman v. Richland Mem'l Hosp.,\r\n  335 S.C. 88, 91-92, 515 S.E.2d 259, 260-61&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  Because it\r\n  was an oral ruling, the family court was fully within its rights to change its\r\n  decision in the written order.Â  Accordingly, this issue is without merit.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Restraining\r\n  Order\r\nFather argues the family court erred in\r\n  ordering the parties to restrain from having Child overnight in the presence of\r\n  an adult of the opposite sex who\r\n  was not related by marriage or blood to Child because neither party requested\r\n  it and it is broad and nonspecific.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;'When issues not raised by the\r\n  pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be\r\n  treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.'&quot;Â  Sherman\r\n    v. Sherman, 307 S.C. 280, 282, 414 S.E.2d 809, 811 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting\r\n  Rule 15(b), SCRCP) (citing Rule 2(a), SCRFC). \r\nSimply because neither party asked for the\r\n  restraining order in its pleadings does not mean that the family court did not\r\n  have the authority to order it.Â  Issues were raised during trial as to adults\r\n  of the opposite sex who were not related by marriage or blood to Child being present overnight around Child.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the family court did not err in making such a restriction.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Father's argument the\r\n  restraining order is broad and nonspecific was not raised to the family court.

Â Stewart\r\n  Richardson[1] (Seller) rescinded the\r\n  contract after JASDIP Properties SC, LLC (Buyer) was unable to close in a\r\n  timely fashion. Â A jury determined neither party breached the contract and\r\n  awarded no damages on that basis. Buyer appeals the trial court's subsequent\r\n  denial of its unjust enrichment claim, which permitted Seller to retain\r\n  $215,000 in earnest money and extension fees.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\n On\r\n  May 5, 2006, Buyer and Seller entered into a Commercial Purchase Agreement and\r\n  Deposit Receipt (the Agreement) for the purchase of certain property (the\r\n  Property) in Georgetown, South Carolina.Â  At the time of the execution of the\r\n  Agreement, Seller was leasing the Property to a corporation he owned, which was\r\n  operating the Rebar Sports Bar on the property.Â  The purchase price for the\r\n  Property was to be $537,000.Â  Buyer paid an initial deposit of $10,000.Â  The\r\n  balance was due at the closing on or before July 28, 2006.Â  The Agreement\r\n  provided: &quot;If the BUYER shall default under this Agreement, the SELLER\r\n  shall have the option of suing for damages or specific performance, including\r\n  but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees or rescinding this Agreement.&quot;\r\n  Â Further, the Agreement stated, &quot;In any action or proceeding involving a\r\n  dispute between BUYER, SELLER, and/or Broker, arising out of the execution of\r\n  the agreement or the sale, or to collect commissions, the prevailing party\r\n  shall be entitled to receive from the other party a reasonable attorney fee to\r\n  be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.&quot;Â  The Agreement\r\n  also provided the &quot;[b]usiness [was] to remain open and operated by . . . Seller.&quot;[2]\r\n Buyer\r\n  wished to purchase the Property as part of a development plan involving\r\n  adjacent properties in Georgetown.Â  Buyer attempted to obtain approvals and\r\n  permits for its plan, but due to problems obtaining them, the parties executed\r\n  an addendum to the Agreement on July 7, 2006.Â  That addendum provided: &quot;The\r\n  Closing of [the Property] will be 30 Days from the original closing date of\r\n  July 28th[,] 2006.Â  The $10,000.00 earnest money check will be released to\r\n  [Seller] no later than July 11th[,] 2006.Â  All terms and conditions of\r\n  contract, including due diligence period are extended for 30 days.&quot;Â  On\r\n  October 26, 2006, the parties executed another addendum that further extended\r\n  the closing date.Â  It stated:\r\n\r\nClosing to be on or before January 15, 2007.Â  Buyer\r\n  can close sooner if reasonable to do so.Â  Buyer to pay an additional $25,000.00\r\n  deposit to be credited to purchase price.Â  Further Buyer will pay a $7700.00\r\n  extension fee and will pay an additional extension fee of $2700 on December 1\r\n  and January 1 if closing has not occurred prior to those dates.Â  Lastly on November\r\n  1, 2006[,] Buyer will pay $5000.00 fee to Prudential Source One.Â  This amount\r\n  will be credited against purchase price but deducted from commission due to\r\n  Prudential Source One at closing from [S]eller[']s proceeds.\r\n\r\n On January 23, 2007, the parties executed a third\r\n  addendum.Â  It provided, &quot;Buyer to pay Seller $175,000.00 by Friday[,]\r\n  January 16, 2007.Â  Closing to be extended until March 26, 2007.Â  Seller to\r\n  grant Buyer an additional 30 day extension for the payment of an additionally\r\n  [sic] $100,000 on or before March 26, 2007[.]Â  All funds to be applied to\r\n  purchase price.&quot;Â  On January 23, 2007, several members of the Georgetown\r\n  City Council and other residents of Georgetown filed a lawsuit against Buyer\r\n  seeking to stop Buyer's development plan.Â  Buyer notified Seller of the\r\n  lawsuit and informed him that it intended to move forward with the purchase,\r\n  but Seller did not respond.Â  Buyer proposed a fourth addendum, which\r\n  stated the closing date would be ten days after the pending litigation had\r\n  ended, but Seller did not reply.\r\nOn April 10, 2007, Seller's attorney sent\r\n  a letter to Buyer's attorney, stating: &quot;The latest extension expired on\r\n  March 26, 2007.Â  Pursuant to paragraph 32 of the contract i[n] the event of\r\n  default, the Seller has the option to rescind the contract and due to the fact\r\n  the Buyers have notified the Seller that they cannot close, the Seller has\r\n  elected to rescind the contract.&quot;Â  The letter further stated,\r\n  &quot;In the event that you[r] client is serious about wanting to purchase the\r\n  property another contract is going to have to be negotiated.&quot; Â The\r\n  letter also stated that Seller had placed the Property for sale and it would\r\n  &quot;be sold to the first accepted contract.&quot;Â  Buyer asked for the return\r\n  of the money paid towards the purchase price, which Seller refused.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Buyer brought suit against Seller (1) contending Seller would be\r\n  unjustly enriched if allowed to keep the money paid despite the rescission of\r\n  the Agreement and (2) requesting $210,000.Â  The $210,000 was comprised of the\r\n  $10,000 earnest money and $200,000 in later payments.Â  Buyer alternatively\r\n  asserted Seller converted these funds by failing to return them after the\r\n  rescission of the Agreement.Â  Buyer later filed an amended complaint requesting\r\n  $205,000, providing the Agreement only permitted Seller to retain half of the\r\n  $10,000 earnest money.Â  Seller filed an answer and counterclaim requesting\r\n  dismissal of Buyer's complaint and judgment against Buyer for actual damages incurred\r\n  due to Buyer's &quot;default(s) as contracted, to include reasonable attorney's\r\n  fees and costs.&quot;\r\n Following a trial on both parties' claims for breach of\r\n  contract, the jury found neither party had breached.Â  Buyer then requested a\r\n  ruling by the trial court on its action for unjust enrichment.Â  The trial court\r\n  found Buyer to be a &quot;sophisticated buyer&quot; and noted the Agreement\r\n  provided &quot;Buyer . . . is aware that a local ordinance is in effect which\r\n  regulates the rights and obligations to property owners.&quot;Â  The court\r\n  further determined Seller put forth significant evidence of damages: the\r\n  monthly mortgage payments, the closure of his business, the fact that he had to\r\n  battle the city to get his business back, and the ability to operate his\r\n  business.Â  The trial court stated &quot;it doesn't shock [t]he Court's\r\n  conscience to leave the parties where they find themselves.&quot;Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court denied Buyer's claim for unjust enrichment.Â  Buyer's appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Unjust Enrichment\r\nBuyer contends the trial court\r\n  erred in denying it relief on its unjust enrichment cause of action.Â  Buyer\r\n  maintains all the evidence presented at trial as well as the jury's verdict\r\n  supports that the Agreement was rescinded or abandoned.Â  Accordingly, this\r\n  requires restitution of $215,000 to Buyer, who had partially performed under\r\n  the Agreement.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen a complaint raises both legal and equitable\r\n  issues and rights, the legal issues are determined by a jury while equitable issues are for the judge.Â  Floyd\r\n    v. Floyd, 306 S.C. 376, 379, 412 S.E.2d 397, 398-99&nbsp;(1991).Â  &quot;In\r\n  actions at equity, this court can find facts in accordance with its view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  White's Mill Colony, Inc. v. Williams,&nbsp;363\r\n  S.C. 117, 124, 609 S.E.2d 811, 815&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nA breach of contract claim and quantum meruit claim\r\n  can be alternative rather than inconsistent remedies.Â  Franke Assocs. by\r\n    Simmons v. Russell, 295 S.C. 327, 332, 368 S.E.2d 462, 465&nbsp;(1988).Â  In Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich, 390 S.C. 609, 617, 703 S.E.2d\r\n  221, 225 (2010), the supreme court affirmed the circuit court's decision to\r\n  award damages under the theory of quantum meruit even though the circuit had\r\n  found there was a contract between the parties.Â  The supreme court found,\r\n  &quot;While the circuit court did find there was a contract between the two\r\n  parties in this action, it never awarded damages because of a breach of that\r\n  contract.Â  Rather, the circuit court chose the theory of quantum meruit as an\r\n  alternate remedy.&quot;Â  Id. at 617 n.4, 703 S.E.2d at 225 n.4.\r\n&quot;Restitution is a remedy designed to prevent\r\n  unjust enrichment.&quot;Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C.,&nbsp;354\r\n  S.C. 397, 409, 581 S.E.2d 161, 167 (2003); see also Ellis v.

Â &quot;[Q]uantum meruit,\r\n  quasi-contract, and implied by law contract are equivalent terms for an\r\n  equitable remedy.&quot;Â  QHG of\r\n    Lake City, Inc. v.

Co. v. Long,&nbsp;306\r\n  S.C. 465, 468 n.1, 412 S.E.2d 450, 452 n.1&nbsp;(Ct.

Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, L.L.P., 385 S.C. 452,\r\n  466, 684 S.E.2d 756, 764&nbsp;(2009) (internal quotation marks and citations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\n&quot;To recover on a theory of restitution, the\r\n  plaintiff must show (1) that he conferred a non-gratuitous benefit on the\r\n  defendant; (2) that the defendant realized some value from the benefit; and (3)\r\n  that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without\r\n  paying the plaintiff for its value.&quot;Â  Sauner,&nbsp;354 S.C. at 409, 581 S.E.2d at\r\n  167; see also Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc., 390 S.C. at 616-17,\r\n  703 S.E.2d at 225&nbsp;(providing the same requirements to recover under the\r\n  doctrine of quantum meruit).&nbsp; &quot;Unjust enrichment is usually a prerequisite for enforcement of the\r\n  doctrine of restitution; if there is no basis for unjust enrichment, there is no basis for\r\n  restitution.&quot;Â  Ellis,&nbsp;294 S.C. at 473, 366 S.E.2d at\r\n  14-15.Â  \r\nBuyer seeks the $175,000 and $25,000 payments as well\r\n  as the $10,000 in earnest money and also the $5,000 that was to go towards the\r\n  broker's fee.Â  However, the Buyer raises its request for the $5,000 broker's\r\n  fee for the first time on appeal.Â  &quot;[T]o preserve an issue for appellate review, a matter may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been both raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court.&quot;Â  Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,&nbsp;389\r\n  S.C. 1, 21, 698 S.E.2d 612, 623&nbsp;(2010).Â  Accordingly, its request for the\r\n  broker's fee is not preserved for our review.Â  Additionally, in its amended\r\n  complaint, Buyer states that under the Agreement, Seller can only keep half of\r\n  the $10,000 in earnest money and only requests a total of $205,000.Â  An issue\r\n  conceded in the trial court cannot be argued on appeal.Â  Ex parte McMillan,\r\n  319 S.C. 331, 335, 461 S.E.2d 43, 45&nbsp;(1995).Â  Therefore, Buyer is bound by\r\n  that concession and entitled to $5,000 of the earnest money at most.Â  \r\nThe $175,000 and $25,000 payments both explicitly\r\n  stated that they were towards the purchase price.Â  Additionally, Buyer paid\r\n  $10,000 in an earnest money[3] deposit.Â  The unappealed\r\n  finding of the jury was that neither party breached the Agreement.Â  An\r\n  unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case.Â  Ulmer v. Ulmer,\r\n  369 S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006).Â  Based on the jury's finding\r\n  that Buyer did not breach, we find Buyer is entitled to the money paid towards\r\n  the purchase price as well as half of the earnest money under the theory of\r\n  restitution.[4]Â  Buyer met the\r\n  requirements to recover under the theory of restitution: (1) Buyer paid Seller\r\n  $205,000 towards the purchase price and the sale did not go through despite the\r\n  fact that neither party breached; (2) Seller kept the $205,000 although he also\r\n  retained the Property; and (3) Seller keeping the $205,000 is inequitable\r\n  because the Seller still has the Property, the jury found neither party\r\n  breached, and the evidence supports that Buyer intended to go forward with the\r\n  purchase.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in failing to find for Buyer for\r\n  its claim of unjust enrichment.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's\r\n  determination that Buyer was not entitled to restitution and award Buyer\r\n  $205,000.\r\nII.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nBuyer contends if this court\r\n  reverses the trial court's decision on unjust enrichment, we should remand to\r\n  the trial court to award attorney's fees and costs because the Agreement\r\n  permits the prevailing party to recover them.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, attorney's fees are not recoverable unless authorized\r\n  by contract or statute.Â  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382,\r\n  383, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989).Â  The\r\n  award of attorney's fees under a contract is left to the discretion of the\r\n  trial court and will not be disturbed unless the court abused that discretion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nBecause the trial court found in favor of Seller, it\r\n  never determined whether Buyer was entitled to attorney's fees.Â  The Agreement\r\n  provided for attorney's fees to the prevailing party if a dispute arose out of\r\n  the execution of the Agreement or the sale.Â  This cause of action did arise out\r\n  of the sale of the Property and therefore was contemplated by the Agreement.Â \r\n  Because the trial court has the discretion to award attorney's fees under a\r\n  contract, we remand the case to allow it to determine whether fees should be\r\n  awarded as to the unjust enrichment cause of action.Â  This would include the\r\n  trial court making a determination as to whether Buyer was the prevailing\r\n  party.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the trial court's decision and award Buyer\r\n  $205,000.Â  Further, we remand the matter to the trial court to determine if\r\n  attorney's fees should be awarded.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n PIEPER, J.,\r\n  dissenting:Â  \r\nI\r\n  respectfully dissent and would affirm the trial court's denial of the request\r\n  for restitution by Appellant JASDIP Properties SC, LLC (JASDIP).Â  \r\n I\r\n  am reluctant to reverse the judgment of the trial court because JASDIP had an\r\n  adequate remedy at law, which the jury rejected.Â  Generally, equity is\r\n  available when a party does not have an adequate remedy at law.Â  See EllisDon\r\n    Constr., Inc. v. Clemson Univ., 391 S.C. 552, 555, 707 S.E.2d 399, 401\r\n  (2011).Â  &quot;A party failing to fulfill the requirements of its legal remedy\r\n  cannot later come to the courts complaining of hardship, seeking an equitable\r\n  remedy.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The jury's verdict may be read in a different manner\r\n  other than as a finding that neither party breached the contract.Â  For example,\r\n  the jury could have based its decision on whether damages were sufficiently\r\n  proven.Â  The judge charged the jury on all elements of a breach of contract\r\n  cause of action, which includes the existence of a contract, breach, and\r\n  damages.Â  See Maro v. Lewis, 389 S.C. 216, 222, 697 S.E.2d 684,\r\n  688 (Ct. App. 2010) (noting in an action for breach of contract, the plaintiff\r\n  has the burden of proving the existence of a contract, breach, and damages\r\n  caused by the breach).Â  Additionally, the verdict form contained a query\r\n  instructing the jury to find for either the plaintiff or the defendant and used\r\n  the terms &quot;Breach of Contract claim,&quot; which encompasses all of the\r\n  elements required to prove a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  I find it\r\n  noteworthy that the parties did not seek an additional interrogatory before the\r\n  jury was excused as to whether the jury found for Respondent Stewart Richardson\r\n  on JASDIP's claim based on the failure to prove breach or damages.Â  If the jury\r\n  resolved this question on the same damages component sought in equity, then\r\n  JASDIP should not be entitled to an equitable remedy on its rejected legal\r\n  claim.Â  Therefore, I believe we may affirm on this basis.Â  See Rule\r\n  220(c), SCACR (&quot;The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision\r\n  or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.&quot;).\r\n To the extent\r\n  JASDIP has not argued on appeal that the inadequacy of a legal remedy justifies\r\n  equitable relief, I nonetheless would affirm the trial court's decision to deny\r\n  equitable relief based upon the record herein.Â  To recover for unjust enrichment based on restitution, &quot;the\r\n  plaintiff must show (1) that he conferred a non-gratuitous benefit on the\r\n  defendant; (2) that the defendant realized some value from the benefit; and (3)\r\n  that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without\r\n  paying the plaintiff for its value.&quot;Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C.,\r\n  354 S.C. 397, 409, 581 S.E.2d 161, 167 (2003).Â  A non-gratuitous benefit is a\r\n  benefit conferred either at the defendant's request or in circumstances where\r\n  the plaintiff reasonably relied upon or ought to have understood that the\r\n  plaintiff expected compensation and looked to the defendant for payment.Â  Niggel\r\n    Assocs., Inc. v. Polo's of N. Myrtle Beach, Inc., 296 S.C. 530, 532-33, 374\r\n  S.E.2d 507, 509 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  denying JASDIP's request for restitution, the trial court noted the substantial\r\n  evidence of damages Richardson claimed to have sustained as a result of the\r\n  delay in closing on the property and that the delay was not caused by\r\n  Richardson.Â  Richardson testified about the mortgage\r\n  payments he had to make as a result of JASDIP's failure to close on time. Â He\r\n  also testified that he did not have any income as a result of closing the\r\n  business to facilitate the sale of the property, and testified about his\r\n  inability to reopen the business as a result of the change in zoning of the\r\n  property.Â  Richardson testified about damage that was done to his\r\n  property during JASDIP's inspection, including ceilings and air conditioning\r\n  ducts that had been torn out, which Richardson repaired at a cost of $42,000.Â \r\n  Richardson incurred $15,524 in attorney's fees defending this action by\r\n  JASDIP.Â  Finally, Richardson testified regarding $320,174 in living and\r\n  mortgage expenses he incurred after he closed his business and was unable to\r\n  reopen the business because the property had been rezoned.Â  Based on this\r\n  testimony, JASDIP has not met its burden of showing that it would be\r\n  inequitable for Richardson to retain the $215,000 JASDIP paid towards the\r\n  purchase price of the property.Â  \r\nSince\r\n  JASDIP has not met its burden of convincing this court that the trial court's\r\n  equitable decision is erroneous, I would therefore affirm.Â  See Lewis\r\n    v.

Â He maintains the circuit court could not take\r\n  judicial notice of the existence of his civil action when evidence of that\r\n  claim did not appear in the appellate record.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\n This\r\n  workers' compensation action arose out of an accident Claimant had on October\r\n  30, 2000, while working for Richard Wise d/b/a Wise Services (Employer).[1]Â \r\n  Claimant was riding on top of a bank building that was being moved when he came\r\n  into contact with a high voltage electrical line in Orangeburg, South Carolina\r\n  and sustained severe burns as a result.Â  On June 26, 2001, Claimant filed a\r\n  Form 50 against Employer for medical and compensation benefits for his\r\n  injuries.Â  On July 13, 2001, Employer filed a Form 51, denying Claimant was an\r\n  employee and asserting he was an independent contractor.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Employer contended it was not covered by the Workers' Compensation Act (the\r\n  Act) because it does not have the requisite number of employees.Â  Employer also\r\n  maintained if Claimant was an employee, he was a casual employee and thus\r\n  exempt under section 42-1-360 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The South Carolina Uninsured\r\n  Employers' Fund (the Fund) contended Claimant was not subject to the Act.Â  It\r\n  further asserted that if Claimant was a covered employee, his weekly wage\r\n  should be figured at the minimum compensation of $75 per week because he failed\r\n  to file a tax return for his wages from Employer.Â Â  \r\n On\r\n  May 2, 2002, the single commissioner held a hearing on the matter.Â  On October\r\n  18, 2002, five months after the single commissioner conducted the hearing but\r\n  prior to its issuing the order, Claimant filed a tort action against Employer\r\n  and the City of Orangeburg (the City).Â  On November 26, 2003, the single\r\n  commissioner issued an order denying the claim, finding Employer regularly\r\n  employed only three employees and thus was exempt from the Act and not required\r\n  to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage.Â  The single commissioner\r\n  further found because Employer was exempt from coverage, the Fund had no\r\n  responsibility to provide benefits to Claimant.Â  Finally, the single\r\n  commissioner found the Workers' Compensation Commission had no jurisdiction\r\n  over the claim and dismissed it.Â  \r\n On\r\n  December 8, 2003, Claimant filed a Form 30 appealing the single commissioner's\r\n  order to the Appellate Panel.Â  On January 4, 2004, Claimant obtained a default\r\n  judgment in the amount of $900,000 in the tort action against Employer.Â \r\n  Claimant and the City reached a settlement.Â  \r\nOn June 22, 2004, the Fund filed a motion to dismiss\r\n  the appeal or order new evidence taken before the single commissioner.Â  The\r\n  Fund contended Claimant had waived his right to appeal his claim by filing suit\r\n  against Employer alleging his employment did not fall within the scope of the\r\n  Act and prosecuting that action to a final judgment of $900,000.Â Â Â \r\n  Additionally, the Fund maintained Claimant did not notify it or the Commission\r\n  of his suit against the City as a third-party tortfeasor, which section\r\n  42-1-560(b) of the South Carolina Code requires, and as a result he elected his\r\n  remedy and was barred from receiving any benefits under the Act.Â  The Fund\r\n  provided an affidavit, a copy of Claimant's summons and complaint against\r\n  Employer and the City, the default judgment against Employer, and the order\r\n  from February 24, 2004, dismissing the action against the City with prejudice.Â \r\n  The Appellate Panel dismissed the workers' compensation action, finding (1) Claimant,\r\n  Employer, or their attorneys did not notify the Commission or the Fund of the\r\n  civil suit; (2) when Claimant filed his civil action on the same issues that\r\n  were before the Commission, the matter was removed from the Commission's\r\n  jurisdiction, and the Claimant alleged his employment did not fall within the\r\n  parameters of the Act; and (3) accordingly, the matter is res judicata.Â  \r\n Claimant\r\n  appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the order to dismiss, finding\r\n  Regulation 67-215(B)(1) of the South Carolina Code of Regulations prohibited\r\n  the Appellate Panel from addressing a motion to dismiss.Â  The circuit court\r\n  remanded the action to the Full Commission for it to consider the Fund's motion\r\n  to submit new evidence.Â  The Full Commission then remanded the matter to the\r\n  Appellate Panel, which granted the motion to submit additional evidence and\r\n  remanded the action to the single commissioner to consider the new evidence.Â \r\n  Claimant appealed the Appellate Panel's allowance of additional evidence to the\r\n  circuit court, which reversed the Appellate Panel, finding the Appellate\r\n  Panel's order was too summary to allow a meaningful review.Â  On remand, the\r\n  Full Commission issued an order granting the Fund's motion to submit additional\r\n  evidence, finding the record contains no evidence contrary or similar to the\r\n  new evidence; thus, the new evidence was not cumulative or impeaching.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the Full Commission remanded the action to the single commissioner to determine\r\n  whether Claimant had elected his remedy.Â  \r\nClaimant again appealed to the circuit court,\r\n  asserting the evidence did not fit the meaning of newly discovered evidence\r\n  under Regulation 67-707 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The circuit court\r\n  reversed, finding the evidence did not constitute newly discovered evidence\r\n  under Regulation 67-707.Â  The circuit court stated: &quot;The evidence\r\n  of facts sought to be admitted did not exist at the time of the hearing before\r\n  the [s]ingle [c]ommissioner. . . . [T]he evidence sought to be admitted does\r\n  not constitute after discovered evidence within the meaning of Regulation\r\n  67-707.&quot;Â  (quoting State v. Haulcomb, 260 S.C. 260, 270, 195 S.E.2d\r\n  601, 606 (1973) (&quot;[A]fter discovered evidence refers to facts existing at\r\n  time of trial of which . . . [the] aggrieved party was excusably\r\n  ignorant.&quot;)).Â  On remand, the Appellate Panel denied the Fund's motion to\r\n  admit additional evidence pursuant to Regulation 67-707 and ordered Claimant's\r\n  appeal as to whether Employer was subject to the Act be set for a hearing.Â \r\n  Following the hearing, the Appellate Panel reversed the single commissioner,\r\n  finding Employer had four employees in his employment, and thus, it was subject\r\n  to the Act.Â  The Fund appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the\r\n  Appellate Panel, finding the action was &quot;barred by the election of\r\n  remedies of the [C]laimant by instituting and settling his tort claims without\r\n  notice to and the consent of the [E]mployer and the [Fund].&quot;Â  The circuit\r\n  court also found in the alternative, &quot;pursuant to the election of\r\n  jurisdiction provision of [s]ection 42-5-40 the Commission was divested of\r\n  jurisdiction over this claim and its order is vacated.&quot;[2]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial\r\n  review of decisions by the Appellate Panel.Â  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse when the decision is affected by\r\n  an error of law.Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d\r\n  551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule\r\n  governs the standard of review in workers' compensation decisions.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs.\r\n    Inc., 357\r\n  S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial\r\n  evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  An appellate court can reverse or modify the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision only if the decision is affected by an error of law\r\n  or is &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record.&quot;Â  Liberty Mut.\r\n    Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363\r\n  S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations and internal quotation\r\n  marks omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nClaimant argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in considering the documents relating to the civil action because\r\n  they were not part of the record.Â  He further contends the circuit court erred\r\n  in taking judicial notice of the civil action because the Fund never requested\r\n  the Appellate Panel take notice of it or raise it as a ground on appeal.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Election of Remedies/Third-Party ActionÂ \r\nWhen an employee's claim arises out of and in the\r\n  course of his or her employment, the Act provides the exclusive remedy. Â See Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 422, 567 S.E.2d 231, 234&nbsp;(2002).Â \r\n  &quot;Every employer and employee . . . shall be presumed to have accepted the\r\n  provisions of this title respectively to pay and accept compensation for\r\n  personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of the\r\n  employment and shall be bound thereby.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-310 (Supp.\r\n  2010). \r\n&quot;When\r\n  an employee and his or her employer accept the provisions of the Act, the\r\n  employee's remedies under the Act exclude all other rights and remedies of the\r\n  employee.&quot; Â Harrell v.\r\n    Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 325-26, 523 S.E.2d 766, 772 (1999)\r\n  (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985)).\r\n\r\n  THIS SECTION IS KNOWN AS THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY\r\n  PROVISION, AND IT shrouds an employer with immunity from any actions at law\r\n  instituted by the employee. Â Such immunity is part of the broader quid pro\r\n    quo arrangement imposed upon the employer and employee by the Act.Â  The\r\n  employee &quot;receives the right to swift and sure compensation&quot; in\r\n  exchange for giving up the right to sue in tort; the employer receives such tort\r\n  immunity in exchange for complying with those provisions of the Act that insure\r\n  swift and sure compensation for the employee.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nId. at 326, 523 S.E.2d at 772.Â \r\n  &quot;The Act achieves such 'swift and sure compensation' by requiring the\r\n  employer to secure the payment of compensation under [section 42-5-10 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (1985)].&quot; Â Id. at 326, 523 S.E.2d at 773.Â  Section\r\n  42-5-10 provides: &quot;Every employer who accepts the compensation provisions\r\n  of this Title shall secure the payment of compensation to his employees in the\r\n  manner provided in this chapter.&quot;Â  An employer that fails to secure such compensation\r\n  becomes liable either under the Act or in an action at law. Â Harrell,\r\n  337 S.C. at 327, 523 S.E.2d at 773 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-5-40 (1985)).Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  Act prohibits an employee from recovering both workers' compensation and a tort\r\n  judgment from an employer who fails to secure compensation.&quot;Â  Id. at 329, 523 S.E.2d at 774.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA claimant has three remedies for\r\n  job-related injuries:\r\n    \r\n(1) To proceed solely against the employer thereby\r\n  allowing the employer-carrier the opportunity to pursue reimbursement against\r\n  the third party for its obligated payments.\r\n(2) To proceed solely against the third party tort\r\n  feasor under [section] 42-1-550 by instituting and prosecuting an action at\r\n  law; and\r\n(3) To proceed against both the employer-carrier and\r\n  the third party tort feasor by complying with [section] 42-1-560.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCallahan v. Beaufort County Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 92, 95-96, 651 S.E.2d 311, 313 (2007).\r\n Section\r\n  42-1-560 of the South Carolina Code (1985) provides the requirements for simultaneously\r\n  pursuing a third-party action and a workers' compensation claim. Â It states:\r\n  &quot;Notice of the commencement of the [third-party] action shall be given\r\n  within thirty days thereafter to the . . . Commission, the employer[,] and\r\n  carrier upon a form prescribed by the . . . Commission.&quot;Â  Â§ 42-1-560(b).Â  The statute clearly requires timely notice be given\r\n  to all three entities: employer, carrier, and Commission.Â  Callahan,&nbsp;375\r\n  S.C. at 96, 651 S.E.2d at 314. Â &quot;The object of\r\n  [section] 42-1-560 is to effect an equitable adjustment of the rights of all the parties. Â It would defeat this objective to allow the employee to demand\r\n  compensation from the employer after having destroyed the employer's normal\r\n  right to obtain reimbursement from the third party.&quot;\r\n  Â Fisher v. S.C. Dep't. of Mental Retardation-Coastal Ctr., 277 S.C. 573,\r\n  575-76, 291 S.E.2d 200, 201&nbsp;(1982) (citation and internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;[T]he settlement of a third party claim without notice to the\r\n  employer and carrier bars a workers' compensation action.&quot;Â  Kimmer v. Murata of Am., Inc., 372 S.C. 39, 52, 640 S.E.2d 507, 513-14&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).Â  In Fisher, the supreme court held that a claimant had\r\n  elected a remedy, thus forgoing workers' compensation benefits, by settling a\r\n  third-party claim without complying with the notice requirements of section\r\n  42-1-560, even though the carrier had actual knowledge of the third-party suit.\r\n  Â Id.\r\nThis court has previously explained the reasoning\r\n  behind a settlement serving as a bar to a workers' compensation action:\r\n\r\n  As a result of the failure to notify of a third party claim, the\r\n  employer-carrier loses a voice in the litigation and is clearly prejudiced. Â That\r\n  voice encompasses the right to select one's own counsel, conduct one's own\r\n  investigation, and direct the litigation. Â Notice makes it possible for the\r\n  employer-carrier to offer the employee meaningful assistance in prosecuting the\r\n  third party claim. Â With timely knowledge the employer-carrier gains the\r\n  opportunity to lend support to an effort that could lead to the carrier's\r\n  recovery of some or all of the compensation it might later be required to pay\r\n  the injured employee under the Workers' Compensation Act. Â The statute's\r\n  underlying purpose serves to protect the carrier's subrogation interests and\r\n  prevents an employee's double recovery.\r\n\r\nKimmer, 372\r\n  S.C. at 51, 640 S.E.2d at 513&nbsp;(citations omitted).\r\nCase law makes clear that an employee cannot recover\r\n  against an employer under both a workers' compensation action and a civil\r\n  action.Â  Here, Claimant recovered $900,000 from Employer in the form of a\r\n  default judgment.Â  Further, because Claimant did not strictly comply with the\r\n  notice provisions in filing suit against a third party, he is barred from\r\n  recovering under the Act.Â  However, we must determine if the evidence of the\r\n  civil suit could be admitted as new evidence or the circuit court could take\r\n  judicial notice of it.\r\nII.&nbsp; Judicial Notice\r\n&quot;Notice may be taken of judicially cognizable\r\n  facts&quot; in administrative cases. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-330(4) (2005).\r\n\r\nAppellate courts are generally reluctant to notice\r\n  adjudicative facts even when those facts may be absolutely reliable. Â Notice of\r\n  &quot;facts&quot; for the first time on appeal may deny the adverse party the\r\n  opportunity to contest the matters noticed; it may also violate the general\r\n  principle that appellate review should be limited to the record. Â Finally,\r\n  appellate courts, limited to the &quot;cold&quot; record, cannot be as\r\n  sensitive to the appropriateness of judicial notice as the trial judge. Â For\r\n  the foregoing reasons we hold that original judicial notice of adjudicative\r\n  facts at the appellate level should be limited to matters which are\r\n  indisputable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Masters v. Rodgers Dev., 283 S.C. 251, 256, 321 S.E.2d 194, 197&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1984) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;A court can\r\n  take judicial notice of its own records, files[,] and proceedings for all\r\n  proper purposes including facts established in its records.&quot;Â  Freeman\r\n    v. McBee, 280 S.C. 490, 313 S.E.2d 325 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  &quot;It is not\r\n  error for a judge to take judicial notice of what was stated in [a] former\r\n  opinion in [a] prior action of the same case.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nClaimant's argument as to judicial notice revolves\r\n  around the fact that the Fund did not request the Appellate Panel take judicial\r\n  notice of the suit or raise judicial notice in its grounds on appeal to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  As Claimant's own case law states, an appellate court can take\r\n  judicial notice of something that was not before the trial court if it is\r\n  indisputable.Â  The summons and complaint and default judgment show that\r\n  Claimant did file an action and recover against Employer thus making that his exclusive\r\n  remedy.Â  Additionally, he filed suit and entered a settlement against a third\r\n  party without providing any notice to the Fund or the Commission as required by\r\n  statute, thus barring the workers' compensation action.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Additional\r\n  Evidence\r\nAdditionally, the evidence of the civil claim could be\r\n  admitted as new evidence under Regulation 67-707 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Regulations (Supp. 2010), which provides the requirements for the admission of\r\n  additional evidence in workers' compensation cases. Â Regulation 67-707 states:\r\n\r\nA. When additional evidence is necessary for the\r\n  completion of the record in a case on review the Commission may, in its\r\n  discretion, order such evidence taken before a Commissioner.\r\nB. When a party seeks to introduce new evidence into\r\n  the record on a case on review, the party shall file a motion and affidavit\r\n  with the Commission's Judicial Department.\r\nC. The moving party must establish the new evidence is\r\n  of the same nature and character required for granting a new trial and show:\r\n  \r\n(1) The evidence sought to be introduced is not\r\n  evidence of a cumulative or impeaching character but would likely have produced\r\n  a different result had the evidence been procurable at the first hearing; and \r\n(2) The evidence was not known to the moving party at\r\n  the time of the first hearing, by reasonable diligence the new evidence could\r\n  not have been secured, and the discovery of the new evidence is being brought\r\n  to the attention of the Commission immediately upon its discovery. \r\n  \r\n\r\nClaimant argues because the circuit court originally found\r\n  it was not newly discovered evidence and the Fund did not appeal, it was the\r\n  law of the case.Â  However, an appeal of that ruling would have been interlocutory.Â  See Leviner v. Sonoco Prods.

Â They further appeal various matters related to jury\r\n  instructions as well as the circuit court's refusal to grant equitable relief.Â \r\n  We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nClara\r\n  Gordon Burch and her fourth husband, George E. Burch, were married in 1984.Â \r\n  Clara was 75 at the time of their marriage and George was almost 70.Â  Clara had\r\n  no children, while George had two, Dennis E. Burch and Laurie E. Burch.Â  Clara's\r\n  will, executed in 1985, left a life estate in her home to George, but ceded her\r\n  remaining assets to her Gordon family members, including her nephew, Charles,\r\n  and other nieces and nephews.Â  In October 1994, Clara entered a nursing home\r\n  and was experiencing &quot;cognitive defects.&quot;Â  She had amassed a sizable\r\n  estate composed primarily of bonds, certificates of deposit, and other funds\r\n  received incident to her previous marriages.Â  In February of 1995, Clara\r\n  executed a power of attorney (POA) in George's favor.Â  The POA did not contain\r\n  a gifting provision.Â  George's attorney, Jacqueline Busbee, prepared the POA,\r\n  although she did not meet or confer with Clara before doing so.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  George removed funds in CDs or accounts owned by Clara or from their joint\r\n  account totaling approximately $400,000.Â  Clara passed away in April of 2000,\r\n  and, per the provisions in her will, George was named personal representative\r\n  (PR) of her estate.Â  Busbee began advising George in his capacity as PR.Â \r\n  George died on January 18, 2003, and, per the provisions of his will, Busbee\r\n  was named PR of his estate.Â  Charles was appointed successor PR of Clara's\r\n  estate on February 27, 2003.Â  Charles filed this lawsuit in April 2005.[1] Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial before the circuit court, Charles's wife, Barbara, and George's daughter,\r\n  Laurie, testified George mentioned an arrangement between Clara and him to\r\n  handle their estate finances.Â  Laurie also testified George gave her a loan in\r\n  the amount of $170,000 that was to be considered an advance against her\r\n  inheritance if it was not repaid at the time of his death.Â  \r\nThe Gordons\r\n  presented expert accounting evidence through Agnes Asman, a certified public\r\n  accountant.Â  She testified she had examined all the records available to her\r\n  and created a chart that represented transfers made from Clara's funds into\r\n  accounts or CDs held solely in George's name or in their joint account that had\r\n  been used to pay for Clara's nursing home care.Â  In her estimation, George had\r\n  misappropriated approximately $450,000 exclusive of interest.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Asman conceded the examination she had conducted was not a\r\n  forensic accounting that would demonstrate the source of the funds into the\r\n  accounts and specifically trace the funds to their final destination.Â  She\r\n  further admitted she had not examined the signature cards for the various\r\n  accounts but had relied on the Internal Revenue Service form 1099s to determine\r\n  who had ownership of various accounts and assets.Â  In at least one instance\r\n  when Asman's chart showed ownership of an account by Clara, George was also a\r\n  signator on the account.Â  Additionally, Asman testified she had not considered\r\n  George's contribution to the parties' joint bank account when determining that\r\n  he had withdrawn money that belonged to Clara.Â  \r\nWith\r\n  respect to Busbee, the Gordons alleged she had operated as George's attorney in\r\n  his capacity as PR and as attorney for Clara's estate.Â  They claimed Busbee\r\n  failed to check the status of Clara's estate at the time of her death by\r\n  failing to inventory Clara's safety deposit box and by neglecting to obtain\r\n  Clara's last bank statements prior to the death.Â  They also argued Busbee's\r\n  filing of the inventory of assets in Clara's and George's estates was\r\n  inaccurate and/or fraudulent. Â They contended Dennis and Laurie knew of\r\n  George's transfer of funds from Clara's accounts and estate and received the\r\n  benefit of those transfers either directly or as his devisees.Â  \r\nAt the close of the Gordons' case, the circuit court granted Dennis Burch's directed verdict motion as to\r\n  all claims against him.Â  With respect to Laurie, the court granted a directed\r\n  verdict in her favor as to all claims with the caveat that she may be called\r\n  upon to repay the loans from George to his estate.Â  The circuit court granted a\r\n  directed verdict in favor of Busbee on all claims against her individually with\r\n  the exception of the causes of action for legal malpractice and breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty.Â  It also allowed the conversion claim against her as PR of the\r\n  estate to remain but only insofar as she was the representative of George's\r\n  estate in the action, not based on her actions in converting any assets.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of all evidence, the Gordons moved for directed verdict against\r\n  George's estate, arguing the money transferred by George should be returned to\r\n  Clara's estate because he had transferred the funds without Clara's\r\n  permission.Â  That motion was denied, apparently based on the argument that\r\n  George and Clara had made an oral contractual arrangement for the execution of\r\n  these transfers.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  closing arguments, court was dismissed for the day.Â  The following morning, the\r\n  Gordons submitted additional jury charge requests relating to the proportional\r\n  ownership of joint bank accounts with right of survivorship and other matters.Â \r\n  The circuit court refused the charges, determining the request was untimely\r\n  pursuant to Rule 51, SCRCP.Â  After the jury was charged, the Gordons took\r\n  exception to the charge on conversion.Â  They argued the circuit court had\r\n  placed the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff when the burden should have\r\n  been shifted to the defendant to prove the transfers were valid in the absence\r\n  of authorization to make them.Â  The circuit court stood by its original\r\n  charge.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found in favor of Busbee and George's estate on the remaining causes of\r\n  action.Â  The Gordons then sought equitable relief from the circuit court including\r\n  (1) the removal of Busbee as PR of George's estate; (2) a declaration that the\r\n  bank accounts and loan to Laurie were receivable assets of Clara's estate; (3) the\r\n  appointment of a special administrator to account to Clara's estate; and (4) the\r\n  imposition of a constructive trust on all liquid assets of George's estate to\r\n  the extent of the transfers with interest.Â  The circuit court denied this\r\n  motion and all post-trial motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Denial of Directed Verdict (George's Estate)\r\nThe Gordons contend the circuit court erred in failing to direct a\r\n  verdict in their favor concerning the transfers George made after Clara's\r\n  undisputed incompetence in the summer of 1995.Â  We agree in part.[2]\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a directed verdict\r\n  motion, this court employs the same standard as the trial courtâ€”we view the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299-300, 536 S.E.2d\r\n  408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nAt the close of evidence, the Gordons moved for a directed verdict\r\n  &quot;as to all transfers of the assets of Clara Burch by George Burch from and\r\n  after June 30 of [1995].&quot;Â  On appeal, George's estate argues this motion\r\n  was not sufficiently specific as required by Rule 50(a), SCRCP, which states\r\n  &quot;[a] motion for a directed verdict shall state the specific grounds\r\n  therefor.&quot;Â  We disagree. \r\nThe Gordons relied upon Fender v. Fender, 285 S.C. 260,\r\n  329 S.E.2d 430 (1985), in making their motion.Â  In Fender, the attorney\r\n  in fact for the decedent transferred to himself 37.4 acres of land, a car, and\r\n  the proceeds of two bank accounts prior to the decedent's death.Â  Id. at\r\n  262, 329 S.E.2d at 431.Â  The POA did not contain a gift-giving provision and\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted a bright-line rule in this area.Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;[I]n order to avoid fraud and abuse, we adopt a rule barring a gift by\r\n    an attorney in fact to himself or a third party absent clear intent to the\r\n    contrary evidenced in writing.&quot; Â Id. (emphasis added).Â  Fender's mandate is designed to protect\r\n  the vulnerable from improper conduct by those in whom they place the greatest\r\n  trust.Â  Accordingly, the Gordons' directed verdict motion to disallow the\r\n  transfers under Fender was sufficiently specific to operate as a\r\n  directed verdict motion for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  \r\nIn this case, no one disputes Clara's POA did not contain a\r\n  gift-giving provision and the record contains no written evidence of her\r\n  authorization for George to make the transfers he did.Â  The circuit court based\r\n  its decision on the existence of evidence, however slight, showing an\r\n  arrangement between Clara and George to allow him to make transfers to avoid estate\r\n  taxes.Â  However, under Fender, the existence of such an oral agreement\r\n  is insufficient to authorize the transfers.Â  Any transactions involving George\r\n  taking funds that were undisputedly Clara's and transferring them into a fund solely\r\n  owned by him would fit within the construct of Fender. Â Therefore, the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to grant the Gordons' directed verdict motion as\r\n  to those transactions.\r\nThe transactions made during April 2000 and listed in the record\r\n  as Plaintiff's Exhibit 6, with the exception of the $70,000 withdrawal made\r\n  from George and Clara's joint account, fall within this category.Â  With respect\r\n  to these transactions all evidence indicates George took funds belonging solely\r\n  to Clara and opened CDs for those amounts exclusively in his name.Â  Likewise,\r\n  the evidence demonstrates George closed a Wachovia CDÂ  belonging to Clara in\r\n  his capacity as PR and opened a CD in his name the same day in the same amount.[3]Â  Even if these transfers were made in\r\n  furtherance of some oral agreement between George and Clara, they are exactly\r\n  the types of transactions prohibited by Fender as a matter of law.[4]Â  Our supreme court has drawn a bright\r\n  line in such situations so as to avoid the defrauding of vulnerable adults by\r\n  fiduciaries.\r\nBecause the evidence relating to each transaction in this case is\r\n  not identical, the transactions should be considered individually.Â  Some of the\r\n  transactions involve facts that arguably bring them outside the clear scope of Fender.Â \r\n  For example, one transaction at issue involved George closing a CD and\r\n  depositing the funds into the joint account that was used to pay for Clara's\r\n  care while in the nursing home.Â  Another transaction involved the removal of\r\n  $70,000 from the joint account and conversion into a $50,000 CD for George and\r\n  a $20,000 deposit into his own bank account.[5]Â \r\n  Yet another transaction involved the removal of funds from a joint account,\r\n  although it is disputed when the account was made joint.Â  In each of these\r\n  instances, George at least arguably had an initial claim to the funds as\r\n  proceeds in a joint account or he put Clara's funds into a joint account that\r\n  paid for her care, an act that would arguably be for her benefit.Â  With respect\r\n  to some of the transactions, how the funds were expended is unclear.Â  In those\r\n  cases, determining whether George had breached a fiduciary duty was within the\r\n  jury's province. \r\n In sum, Fender mandated a grant of directed verdict on transactions in which the\r\n  evidenced demonstrated Clara's solely-owned assets were transferred by George\r\n  for his sole benefit.Â  Therefore, the following funds taken from Clara's estate\r\n  pursuant to the transactions listed on Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 should be returned\r\n  to the plaintiffs:Â  (1) $79,495.11 and $4,778.46 withdrawn from two of Clara's\r\n  accounts at Security Federal on April 13, 2000; (2) $20,026.41 received upon\r\n  the closing of one of Clara's accounts at Security Federal on April 17, 2000;\r\n  (3)Â  $39,552.98, $6,235.99, and $9,904.21 withdrawn from three of Clara's\r\n  accounts at Community Bank[6] on April 17, 2000.Â  Additionally, $33,309.87, received by George upon the\r\n  closing of Wachovia CD Account #117232 in September of 2000, constitutes an\r\n  improper transfer.Â  We remand this matter to the circuit court for a\r\n  determination of whether and in what amount interest will be due to the plaintiffs\r\n  on these sums.Â  The issue of the propriety of the remaining transactions was\r\n  properly submitted to the jury because they involved questions of disputed\r\n  fact.\r\nII.&nbsp; Grant of Directed Verdict\r\nA.&nbsp; Aiding and Abetting a Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Busbee\r\n  â€“ Individually and as PR)\r\nThe Gordons contend Busbee knew or should have known of George's\r\n  activities and she was therefore guilty of aiding and abetting his conduct.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen deciding a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court\r\n  &quot;must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Anderson v. Augusta Chronicle,\r\n  355 S.C. 461, 470, 585 S.E.2d 506, 511 (Ct. App. 2003). Â &quot;If the evidence\r\n  presented yields only one inference such that the trial court may decide the\r\n  issue as a matter of law, the decision to grant the motion is proper.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n&quot;The elements for a cause of action of aiding and abetting a\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the\r\n  plaintiff; (2) the defendant's knowing participation in the breach; and (3)\r\n  damages.&quot;Â  Vortex Sports &amp; Entm't, Inc. v. Ware, 378 S.C. 197,\r\n  204, 662 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2008).Â  &quot;The gravamen of the claim is the\r\n  defendant's knowing participation in the fiduciary's breach.&quot;Â  Future\r\n    Group, II v. NationsBank, 324 S.C. 89, 99, 478 S.E.2d 45, 50 (1996).\r\nThe Gordons presented no evidence Busbee had actual knowledge of\r\n  the transfers George made prior to his making them or at the time he made them.Â \r\n  George acted as attorney-in-fact for Clara prior to her death and as PR for her\r\n  estate until his own death in 2003.Â  Busbee testified George wanted to handle\r\n  his responsibilities as PR on his own as much as possible and she &quot;took\r\n  him at his word.&quot;Â  Even if Busbee should have conducted additional\r\n  investigation into the assets of Clara's estate, that does not constitute\r\n  evidence of actual knowledge of improper activity on George's part.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court did not err in granting a directed verdict in Busbee's favor.Â Â Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nB.&nbsp; Fraud/Fraud Benefit under Section 62-1-106\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Busbee\r\n  â€“ Individually and as PR; Dennis and Laurie Burch)\r\n The\r\n  Gordons contend the circuit court erred in granting a directed verdict in\r\n  Busbee's favor, individually and as PR, and in favor of Dennis and Laurie Burch\r\n  as to this cause of action.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 62-1-106 of the South Carolina Code (2009) provides:\r\n  \r\nWhenever fraud has been perpetrated in connection with any\r\n  proceeding or in any statement filed under this Code or if fraud is used to\r\n  avoid or circumvent the provisions or purposes of this Code, any person injured\r\n  thereby may obtain appropriate relief against the perpetrator of the fraud or\r\n  restitution from any person (other than a bona fide purchaser) benefiting from\r\n  the fraud, whether innocent or not, but only to the extent of any benefit\r\n  received. Any proceeding must be commenced within two years after the discovery\r\n  of the fraud, but no proceeding may be brought against one not a perpetrator of\r\n  the fraud later than five years after the time of commission of the fraud. This\r\n  section has no bearing on remedies relating to fraud practiced on a decedent\r\n  during his lifetime which affects the succession of his estate.\r\n  \r\n\r\nHere, the circuit court determined no evidence was presented that\r\n  Dennis had committed any sort of fraud in connection with this matter and he\r\n  had yet to receive any of the funds transferred from Clara's estate to George's\r\n  estate.Â  Therefore, he had not committed fraud or benefited from any other\r\n  party's fraud.Â  We agree with the circuit court.Â  Evidence showed the only\r\n  participation Dennis had was evaluating the contents of George's safety deposit\r\n  box after his death, and a bank employee testified the examination was\r\n  conducted properly.Â  \r\n With\r\n  respect to Laurie, the record contains no evidence that she herself committed\r\n  fraud.Â  Although she received a benefit from George's conduct in the form of\r\n  the loan from her father, the circuit court indicated those funds might be owed\r\n  to Clara's estate pending the resolution by the jury of the remaining claims\r\n  against George's estate.Â  Therefore, we find the circuit court did not err in\r\n  granting directed verdict on this claim.Â  \r\n As to\r\n  Busbee, individually and as PR, she did not benefit from the alleged fraud.Â \r\n  Therefore, the only question is whether she perpetrated fraud by filing the inventory\r\n  of assets of George's estate that listed the transfers as part of his estate.Â  The\r\n  record contains no evidence Busbee knew any representations she made in those\r\n  filings were false at the time they were made.Â  Consequently, the circuit court\r\n  did not err in granting a directed verdict in Busbee's favor.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Conversion (Busbee â€“ Individually and as PR)\r\nThe\r\n  Gordons argue Busbee continued George's conversion of Clara's assets by\r\n  including them in George's estate's inventory of assets.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Conversion\r\n  is the 'unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over\r\n  goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the exclusion of the\r\n  owner's rights.'&quot;Â  Bank of New York v. Sumter Cnty., 387 S.C. 147,\r\n  158, 691 S.E.2d 473, 479 (2010) (quoting Moore v. Weinberg, 383 S.C.\r\n  583, 589, 681 S.E.2d 875, 878 (2009)). &quot;Conversion may arise by some\r\n  illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of another's personal\r\n  property.&quot;Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d\r\n  432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nNothing\r\n  in the record demonstrates Busbee assumed the control of any funds without\r\n  authorization.Â  At the time she became PR, the assets were in accounts held by\r\n  George and she properly exercised control over them as the PR of his estate.Â \r\n  The individual claim of conversion fails because she exercised no control over\r\n  the assets in her individual capacity.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit\r\n  court's grant of directed verdict.\r\nD.&nbsp; Civil Conspiracy\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Busbee\r\n  â€“ Individually and as PR; Dennis and Laurie Burch)\r\nThe Gordons maintain the circuit court erred in granting a directed\r\n  verdict in favor of Busbee, individually and as PR, and Dennis and Laurie Burch\r\n  with respect to their civil conspiracy claim.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons\r\n  joining for the purpose of injuring and causing special damage to the\r\n  plaintiff.&quot;Â  McMillan v. Oconee Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559,\r\n  564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006).Â  &quot;Civil conspiracy consists of three\r\n  elements: (1) a combination of two or more persons, (2) for the purpose of\r\n  injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes him special damage.&quot;Â  Vaught\r\n    v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 208, 387 S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  &quot;The\r\n  gravamen of the tort of civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the\r\n  plaintiff from an overt act done pursuant to a common design.&quot;Â  Cricket\r\n    Cove Ventures, LLC v. Gilliand, 390 S.C. 312, 324, 701 S.E.2d 39, 46 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2010).\r\nThe record contains no evidence, only speculation, that any of the\r\n  parties conspired with each other for the purpose of harming Clara or her\r\n  estate.Â  Furthermore, civil conspiracy requires that the plaintiff claim\r\n  special damages.Â  In this case, the Gordons' amended complaint fails to allege\r\n  any special damages incurred as a result of any conspiracy.Â  They allege the\r\n  same damages as they do under the other causes of action.Â  This is insufficient\r\n  to establish special damages.Â  See Hackworth v. Greywood at Hammett,\r\n    LLC, 385 S.C. 110, 117, 682 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;If a\r\n  plaintiff merely repeats the damages from another claim instead of specifically\r\n  listing special damages as part of their civil conspiracy claim, their\r\n  conspiracy claim should be dismissed.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we conclude the\r\n  circuit did not err in granting a directed verdict.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Charges\r\nA.&nbsp; Joint Bank\r\n  Accounts\r\nThe\r\n  Gordons argue the circuit court erred in failing to give the following jury\r\n  charge: &quot;Funds placed in a joint account with right of survivorship remain\r\n  property of the contributing party until that party's death, unless there is\r\n  clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.&quot;Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  principal embodied in this charge emanates from the case of Vaughn v. Bernhardt,\r\n  345 S.C. 196, 547 S.E.2d 869 (2001).Â  In Vaughn, the decedent opened\r\n  several joint bank accounts with her nephew, and the decedent was the sole\r\n  contributor to those accounts.Â  Id. at 197, 547 S.E.2d at 869.Â  The\r\n  nephew withdrew the funds a week prior to the decedent's death and deposited\r\n  the monies in an account titled solely in his name.Â  Id.Â  The court\r\n  determined the statute governing such accounts was unambiguous and required a\r\n  holding that funds withdrawn from such an account prior to a decedent's death\r\n  were no longer presumed to belong to the survivor but became assets of the\r\n  decedent's estate.Â  Id. at 199, 547 S.E.2d at 870.Â  A survivor would\r\n  have to establish entitlement to the funds by &quot;other evidence of intent&quot;\r\n  without the presumption of right of survivorship.Â  Id. at 200, 547\r\n  S.E.2d at 871.\r\n The circuit court disallowed the jury charge on the procedural\r\n  grounds in Rule 51, SCRCP, which states:Â  \r\n\r\nAt the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the\r\n  trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that\r\n  the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests. The court\r\n  shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their\r\n  arguments to the jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after the\r\n  arguments are completed. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure\r\n  to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to\r\n  consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the\r\n  grounds for his objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out\r\n  of the hearing of the jury.\r\n\r\nThis charge was requested after closing arguments, but before\r\n  the circuit court charged the jury.Â  While Rule 51 makes clear that it is\r\n  preferable to have all requested charges submitted prior to closing arguments, it\r\n  is not an absolute rule.Â  In Dalon v. Golden Lanes, Inc., 320 S.C. 534,\r\n  466 S.E.2d 368 (Ct. App. 1996), this court discussed the discretion vested in\r\n  the trial court with respect to the allowance of late instructions.Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  trial court's discretion to refuse a charge because it is not timely requested\r\n  should be sparingly and cautiously exercised.&quot;Â  Id. at 541, 466\r\n  S.E.2d at 372.Â  Â &quot;While Rule 51 contains\r\n  permissive language with respect to the timing of the filing of a request to\r\n  charge, [it] does not specifically bar a request to charge that is made after\r\n  the jury is charged . . . .&quot;Â  Id. \r\nOf the transactions remaining at issue, some could be impacted by\r\n  the failure to give the requested instruction.Â  For example, a check for\r\n  $70,000 was drawn on Clara and George's joint account in the week prior to her\r\n  death.Â  George subsequently opened a $50,000 CD in his own name and deposited\r\n  $20,000 in his own account.Â  These facts fit squarely within the situation\r\n  presented in Vaughn.Â  Furthermore, the defense was not prejudiced by the\r\n  fact that the instruction was requested after closing arguments.Â  The defense\r\n  strategy as to George's estate was that he and Clara had an arrangement and he\r\n  would have been entitled to these joint account funds upon Clara's death.Â  That\r\n  argument was made to the jury.Â Â Â  \r\nHowever, to warrant a new trial, the failure to give the requested\r\n  instruction must have been prejudicial.Â  See Dalon, 320 S.C. at\r\n  540, 466 S.E.2d at 372 (&quot;In order to warrant reversal for failure to give\r\n  a requested charge, the refusal must be both erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial.&quot;).Â  In this case, the proportion of contribution to the joint\r\n  accounts was a disputed factual point.Â  Furthermore, the jury's verdict makes\r\n  clear that it adopted the version of events presented by George's estate.Â  Evidence\r\n  of the financial &quot;arrangement&quot; between George and Clara is at least\r\n  some other evidence of her intent that he have the monies in the joint\r\n  account.Â  The jury clearly believed the defense in the case, because it did not\r\n  find against the estate as to any transfer or cause of action.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  conclude the failure to give the requested instruction was not prejudicial to\r\n  the Gordons and did not constitute reversible error.Â Â  See Pfaehler\r\n    v. Ten Cent Taxi Co., 198 S.C. 476, 484, 18 S.E.2d 331, 335 (1942) (holding\r\n  the giving of erroneous charge was harmless error when it could not have\r\n  affected the action of the jury). \r\nB.&nbsp; Conversion&nbsp;\r\nThe Gordons\r\n  contend the trial court's instruction regarding the burden of persuasion in a\r\n  conversion claim was confusing and prejudicial warranting a mistrial.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  the beginning of his jury charge, the circuit court instructed the jury as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\nThere\r\n  is one exception to [the general rule that plaintiff bears the burden of\r\n  proof], and that is because of the confidential relationship between Mr. Burch\r\n  and his wife.Â  The estate of Mr. Burch has the burden to prove that all\r\n  transfers to himself under the power of attorney and all transfers, assets from\r\n  the name of Clara Burch or her estate are valid.Â  He has to prove that by the\r\n  preponderance or greater weight of the evidence.Â  He also has the burden or\r\n  preponderance of greater weight of the evidence to show that all transfers by\r\n  Mr. Burch to himself or to any third party from Clara's funds are valid by the\r\n  greater weight or preponderance of the evidence.Â  So, it shifts to him on that\r\n  issue, but everything else the plaintiff is â€“ has their burden except for the\r\n  transfers, and that is on Mr. Burch and his estate.Â  \r\n\r\nLater,\r\n  when addressing the specific causes of action, the circuit court instructed:\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  order to prove conversion, the plaintiff must (1) prove by the preponderance or\r\n  greater weight of the evidence first that the plaintiff owned or had a right to\r\n  possess a certain piece of personal property.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  other words, they must prove either title to or a right to possess the personal\r\n  property.Â  That would include, money, bank accounts at the time of conversion.Â \r\n  Ordinarily, an immediate right to possession at the time of conversion is all\r\n  that is required in the way of title or possession to enable the plaintiff to\r\n  maintain his action.\r\nNext,\r\n  the plaintiff must (2) show by the preponderance or greater weight of the\r\n  evidence that the defendant gained control and possession of the property or\r\n  prevented the plaintiff from using the property.Â  The wrongful detention of\r\n  another person's property may give rise to an action for conversion, and, finally,\r\n  the plaintiff must show (3) by the preponderance or greater weight of the\r\n  evidence that the defendant did this without the plaintiff's permission.Â  If\r\n  the plaintiff expressly or impliedly agreed to or approved the defendant's\r\n  taking, use, retention, or disposition of the property, the plaintiff cannot\r\n  recover for conversion of the property. . . .\r\nIf you\r\n  find that a conversion did take place, you should return a verdict for the\r\n  plaintiff for the value of the property taken with interest.Â  Of course, the\r\n  plaintiff has to prove all of that by the greater weight or preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Gordons objected to the charge arguing it was inconsistent and could be\r\n  construed by the jury as not requiring George's estate to prove the validity of\r\n  the transfers in question. The circuit court declined to make any changes or\r\n  additions to its original charge. \r\nWhile\r\n  the jury charge on conversion may have been somewhat confusing, it does not\r\n  constitute prejudicial error.Â  No South Carolina case discusses the burden-shifting\r\n  scheme in a conversion claim against a power of attorney or PR.Â  However, in Howard\r\n    v. Nasser, 364 S.C. 279, 613 S.E.2d 64 (Ct. App. 2005), this court\r\n  discussed the burden-shifting scheme as between will or deed contestants and\r\n  fiduciaries.Â Â  \r\n\r\nA presumption of undue influence arises if the alleged wrongdoer\r\n  was in a confidential relationship with the donor and there were suspicious\r\n  circumstances surrounding the preparation, formulation, or execution of the donative\r\n  transfer, whether the transfer was by gift, trust, will, will\r\n  substitute, or a donative transfer of any other type. The effect of the\r\n  presumption is to shift to the proponent the burden of going forward with the\r\n  evidence, not the burden of persuasion. The presumption justifies a judgment\r\n  for the contestant as a matter of law only if the proponent does not come\r\n  forward with evidence to rebut the presumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 288, 613 S.E.2d at 68 (quoting Restatement\r\n  (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers Â§ 8.3 cmt. f (2003)).&nbsp;\r\n The court went on to interpret the Restatement as it pertains to cases\r\n  in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n  We interpret the foregoing to\r\n  mean that if the contestants of a duly executed will provide evidence that a\r\n  confidential/fiduciary relationship\r\n  existed sufficient to raise the presumption, the proponents of the will must\r\n  offer evidence in rebuttal. We emphasize that although the proponents of the\r\n  will must present evidence in rebuttal, they do not have to affirmatively\r\n  disprove the existence of undue influence.\r\n  Instead, the contestants of the will still retain the ultimate burden of proof\r\n  to invalidate the will. \r\n\r\nId. at 288,\r\n  613 S.E.2d at 68-69.\r\n\r\nWhile Howard is not directly on point, it illustrates the unusual nature of\r\n  the burden-shifting scheme in cases involving decedents and their fiduciaries.Â \r\n  While the fiduciary may have the burden to offer some evidence to establish a lack of undue influence, or in this case the validity of the transfers, the ultimate\r\n  burden of proof remains with the complaining party unless the fiduciary offers\r\n  no evidence to rebut the relevant presumption.Â  In this case, the circuit\r\n  court's instruction indicated the ultimate burden of proof was on the Gordons\r\n  and also indicated that George's estate, as his representative, was required to\r\n  offer a valid explanation for the transfers he made.Â  These statements appear\r\n  to accurately represent the burden-shifting scheme that should be employed.Â \r\n  Therefore, the instruction was not erroneous and did not constitute reversible\r\n  error. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Equitable\r\n  Relief\r\nFinally, the Gordons argue the trial court erred in failing to\r\n  grant the equitable relief requested.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A constructive trust results when circumstances under which\r\n  property was acquired make it inequitable that it be retained by the one\r\n  holding legal title. These circumstances include fraud, bad faith, abuse of\r\n  confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation\r\n  in equity to make restitution.&quot;Â  Macaulay v. Wachovia Bank of S.C.,\r\n    N.A., 351 S.C. 287, 294, 569 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn general, a constructive trust may be imposed when a party\r\n  obtains a benefit which does not equitably belong to him and which he cannot in\r\n  good conscience retain or withhold from another who is beneficially entitled to\r\n  it as where money has been paid by accident, mistake of fact, or fraud, or has\r\n  been acquired through a breach of trust or the violation of a fiduciary duty.Â  \r\n\r\nStraight v.\r\n  Goss, 383 S.C. 180, 210,\r\n  678 S.E.2d 443, 459 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n In this case, evidence\r\n  was presented that George was an attentive and loving husband to Clara and at\r\n  least some evidence showed that the two of them had arranged a plan for him to\r\n  transfer funds for his benefit. Furthermore, a large portion of the transfers\r\n  did not occur until the end of Clara's life was near and she would no longer\r\n  need them for her own benefit.Â  Furthermore, under the statutory law of the\r\n  state, George was entitled at least to his elective share of Clara's estate.Â \r\n  Based on the record as a whole, the circuit court did not err in declining to\r\n  create a constructive trust in favor of Clara's estate.\r\n The Gordons also\r\n  sought an accounting, requested the removal of Busbee as PR of George's estate,\r\n  and raised the Statute of Elizabeth.Â  However, they fail to advance any\r\n  argument as to why the circuit court's ruling as to these specific equitable\r\n  matters was error.Â  Therefore, we deem these issues abandoned.Â  See R\r\n    &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437,\r\n  540 S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that an\r\n  issue is abandoned if the appellant's brief treats it in a conclusory manner).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the circuit court erred in denying the\r\n  Gordons' directed verdict motion as to the transfers listed on Plaintiff's\r\n  Exhibit 6 excluding the first-listed transaction in which George withdrew\r\n  monies from his and Clara's joint account and as to the transfer of money from\r\n  Clara's Wachovia CD.Â  We remand this matter to the circuit court for a\r\n  determination as to interest due Plaintiffs on these sums.Â  However, we find\r\n  the circuit court did not err in granting a directed verdict in Busbee's and\r\n  Dennis and Laurie Burch's favor as to the claims for aiding and abetting a\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, and civil conspiracy.Â  As to the\r\n  jury charges, we conclude the failure to give the requested instruction on\r\n  joint bank accounts did not constitute prejudicial error and the failure to\r\n  modify the instruction on the conversion claim was not erroneous.Â  Finally, we\r\n  affirm the circuit court's decision not to impose a constructive trust on the\r\n  disputed funds in favor of Clara's estate, and we conclude the remainder of the\r\n  Gordons' equitable claims have been abandoned on appeal.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  ruling of the circuit court is \r\n AFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n FEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The matter was\r\n  dismissed on a procedural ground but remanded for trial on appeal.Â  Gordon\r\n    v. Busbee, 367 S.C. 116, 623 S.E.2d 857 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\n[2]Â  Respondents argue\r\n  because the Gordons painted George as a &quot;crook&quot; and the jury did not\r\n  agree with that proposition, the Gordons cannot now claim any error in the\r\n  jury's verdict under the invited error doctrine.Â  This is a misapplication of\r\n  the doctrine.Â  An appellant cannot cause or invite the trial court to err and then\r\n  complain about the court's actions on appeal.Â Â  See 5 C.J.S Appeal and\r\n  Error Â§ 872Â  (&quot;One may not complain on review of errors below for which he\r\n  or she is responsible, or which he or she has invited or induced the trial\r\n  court to commit.&quot;).Â  That is not the case presented here.Â  In this case,\r\n  the Gordons simply took a trial strategy that did not convince the jury.Â  That\r\n  does not touch upon an error by the court and is without the bounds of the\r\n  invited error doctrine.\r\n[3]Â  With respect to the Wachovia CD, Jeremy\r\n  Hall, a financial specialist with Wachovia, testified there was a denotation in\r\n  the bank's system indicating the CD might be connected to an individual\r\n  retirement account (IRA).Â  If it was connected, the surviving spouse would be\r\n  the beneficiary of the CD upon the decedent's death unless another beneficiary\r\n  was named.Â  Hall was recalled later in the trial and testified that after\r\n  checking additional records from Wachovia's main office, the CD was not\r\n  connected to an IRA.Â  \r\n[4] When asked a\r\n  hypothetical at trial, Steve Johnson, a defense expert, opined if the transfers\r\n  were made pursuant to a contract between Clara and George, George could have\r\n  made the transfers under the POA's authority to execute and carry out contracts\r\n  on Clara's behalf.Â  However, the purpose of the contractual power is to benefit\r\n  Clara.Â  Here, even if the arrangement was her desire, the transfers benefited\r\n  George, not her, and such an interpretation would effectively eliminate the\r\n  prohibition expressly stated in Fender.Â  \r\n[5] We recognize\r\n  Asman testified the funds contributed to the joint account were primarily\r\n  Clara's and that would render the joint account funds her property until the\r\n  time of her death as discussed in Section III.A.Â  However, the\r\n  cross-examination of Asman revealed enough uncertainty in her testimony to make\r\n  the question of ownership of the joint account funds a jury issue.\r\n[6] According to\r\n  the record Community Bank is now Capital Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4881","title":"Barrow v.

Ramseur, Jr., of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:Â  Sam Barrow (Husband) appeals the family court's\r\n  apportionment of marital income tax debt to him, the award to Elise Barrow\r\n  (Wife) of a $30,000 special equity in the marital home, and other issues\r\n  relating to equitable distribution.Â  We affirm in part as modified and reverse\r\n  in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  in April 2002 and divorced in June 2007.Â  No children were born of the\r\n  marriage.Â  During the marriage, Husband was employed as a salesperson for an\r\n  orthopedic supply company and earned approximately $93,000 per year.Â  Wife was\r\n  employed as a sales representative for a uniform supply company, CINTAS, and\r\n  earned approximately $73,000 annually.Â  Husband and Wife shared a marital home\r\n  purchased in part with a $40,000 down payment provided by Wife's parents.\r\nWife admitted to &quot;economic\r\n  misconduct&quot; during the marriage including chronic overspending and opening\r\n  credit cards without Husband's knowledge. Â Husband admitted to failing to file\r\n  state and federal income tax returns during the marriage. Â The total tax\r\n  liability incurred by the parties during the marriage was $260,832.Â  Wife paid\r\n  taxes on her income using a married filing separately return and paid a total\r\n  of $92,328 in income taxes.Â  At the time of the final hearing, Husband had\r\n  contributed nothing to the payment of the original tax debt incurred during the\r\n  marriage, and his failure to do so resulted in substantial late fees and\r\n  penalties being assessed.[1]\r\nThe family court granted Wife\r\n  a divorce on the grounds of one year's continuous separation.Â  The family court\r\n  divided the equity in the marital home and the marital portion of Wife's 401(k)\r\n  equally.Â  The family court determined Husband was solely responsible for the\r\n  outstanding tax debt and awarded Wife a $30,000 special equity in the marital\r\n  home based on the down payment provided by her parents.Â  The family court\r\n  declined to award attorney's fees to either party.\r\nHusband filed a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion claiming the court failed to consider the parties' vehicles in determining\r\n  the equitable distribution, the outstanding tax liens in calculating the\r\n  marital home's equity, and the advances Wife took from her marital portion of\r\n  her 401(k).Â  The family court denied Husband's motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment stating, &quot;[t]he Court has carefully reviewed the Court's file\r\n  along with the Order, and finds that the Order accurately reflects the findings\r\n  of the Court made following the hearing on May 5-6, 2009, with respect to the\r\n  matters addressed in [Husband's] Motion.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&nbsp;The appellate court reviews decisions of\r\n  the family court de novo.Â  Lewis\r\n    v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011). The\r\n  appellate court generally defers to the factual findings of the family court\r\n  regarding credibility because the family court is in a better position to\r\n  observe the witness and his or her demeanor.Â  Id.Â  The party contesting\r\n  the family court's decision bears the burden of demonstrating the family\r\n  court's factual findings are not supported by the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Wife's\r\n  Economic Misconduct\r\nHusband argues\r\n  the family court erred in not considering Wife's economic misconduct in\r\n  equitably apportioning the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-3-620(B)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) lists fifteen factors for the court to consider\r\n  in equitably apportioning a marital estate.[2]Â  Fault or marital misconduct affecting\r\n  the parties' economic circumstances or contributing to the marital breakup is\r\n  one factor to consider.Â  Â§ 20-3-620(B)(2).Â  The statute grants the family court\r\n  discretion to decide what weight to assign various factors.Â  Id.Â  While this court may make its own findings of fact on appeal, we recognize &quot;the presence of\r\n  discretion in the family court in valuing marital property and in effecting a\r\n  division of marital property that is equitable under the circumstances.&quot;&nbsp; Lewis, 392 S.C. at 391, 709 S.E.2d at 655.\r\nThe record shows\r\n  Wife had a habit of overspending and writing checks before ensuring her company\r\n  reimbursement checks had been deposited.Â Â Â  Testimony also indicated she took a\r\n  cash advance against one of Husband's credit cards without his permission and\r\n  took out at least one credit card in Husband's name without his permission.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, Husband testified he had the ability to pay his taxes but elected\r\n  not to do so.Â  Wife testified the breakup of the marriage was caused by\r\n  Husband's refusal to file his income taxes.Â  The poor money management and\r\n  financial decisions by both parties affected their economic circumstances, and\r\n  Husband did not testify that Wife's overspending caused the breakup of the\r\n  marriage.Â  The parties were similarly situated with respect to other factors\r\n  such as age, income, health, work experience, and nonmarital property.Â \r\n  Therefore, we do not believe the family court erred in not placing greater\r\n  weight on Wife's economic misconduct in making its equitable distribution.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apportionment\r\n  of Tax Liability\r\nHusband argues\r\n  the family court erred in placing the responsibility for outstanding income tax\r\n  debt solely on him.Â  We agree.[3]\r\n&quot;Marital\r\n  property&quot; is defined as &quot;all real and personal property which has\r\n  been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the\r\n  date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .&quot; Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-630 (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;For purposes of equitable distribution,\r\n  'marital debt' is debt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties regardless\r\n  of whether the parties are legally jointly liable for the debt or whether one\r\n  party is legally individually liable.&quot;Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C.\r\n  433, 436-37, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Marital debt, like marital property, must be\r\n  specifically identified and apportioned in equitable distribution.Â  Smith v.\r\n    Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 457, 486 S.E.2d 516, 520 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In\r\n  equitably dividing the marital estate, the family court must consider &quot;liens\r\n  and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be\r\n  equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and\r\n  any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the\r\n  course of the marriage.&quot;Â  Â§ 20-3-620(B)(13).Â  \r\nAfter recognizing\r\n  Wife had filed separate income tax returns during the marriage, the family\r\n  court concluded &quot;[W]ife has paid her proportional share for marital\r\n    taxes.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  Therefore, it appears the family court\r\n  determined the income taxes incurred by the parties during the marriage were\r\n  marital debt.Â  This determination is in accordance with other South Carolina\r\n  and other states' jurisprudence.Â  See Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323\r\n  S.C. 283, 294, 473 S.E.2d 881, 887 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding Husband's income\r\n  tax liability incurred in the year before the parties' separated was a marital\r\n  debt);Â  Phillips v. Phillips, 290 S.C. 455, 458, 351 S.E.2d 178, 180\r\n  (Ct. App. 1986) (finding Wife was entitled to equitable portion of income tax\r\n  refund because the refund was merely a return of income which was marital\r\n  property); see also Meints v. Meints, 608 N.W.2d 564, 569 (Neb.\r\n  2000) (&quot;Income tax\r\n  liability incurred during the marriage is one of the accepted costs of\r\n  producing marital income, and thus, we hold that income tax liability should\r\n  generally be treated as a marital debt.&quot;).\r\nAlthough we agree\r\n  with the family court's determination that the tax on Husband's income was a\r\n  marital debt, we disagree with the decision to apportion that debt entirely to\r\n  Husband considering the testimony adduced at trial regarding the parties'\r\n  incomes and spending.Â  The record shows Wife's income tax payments amounted to approximately\r\n  35% of the total marital tax liability.Â  However, the record demonstrates Wife\r\n  was benefiting from at least 50% of the marital income.Â Â Â  \r\nAccording to\r\n  Wife's testimony, her check was deposited into a joint account and Husband's\r\n  check was deposited into a sole account in his name that predated the\r\n  marriage.Â  From his account, Husband paid the mortgage and his car payment plus\r\n  he wrote Wife a check each month for some general expenses because he did not\r\n  like the tedious task of actually writing and mailing checks.Â  According to\r\n  Wife, she frequently had to badger Husband for the check and some months he did\r\n  not give her the funds.Â  However, Husband claims he gave Wife money &quot;pretty\r\n  much whenever&quot; she asked for it.Â  Although Wife's direct testimony on that\r\n  question is not included in the record, the manner in which the question is\r\n  posed to Husband indicates Wife agreed with this statement.[4]Â \r\n  Additionally, there was testimony that Husband usually paid the bill for\r\n  occasions when the couple went out socially.Â  \r\nThe record also\r\n  shows, and Wife does not dispute, that she received payments from Husband\r\n  totaling $145,450 during the marriage.Â  Whether Â these monies were for the\r\n  monthly general expenses, Wife's sole benefit, or a combination of the two is\r\n  unclear.Â  However, assuming only half of the $145,450 should be treated as\r\n  inuring to Wife's benefit, that brings the parties' division of marital income\r\n  much closer to a 50/50 ratio.Â  Husband also testified Wife had spent a cash\r\n  buffer he had put in their joint account of $5,000 to $10,000 and had taken an\r\n  advance on a Sears credit card for $5,000.Â  \r\nBecause the\r\n  record contains considerable evidence Wife benefited from at least 50% of the\r\n  total marital income, the family court erred in attributing a lesser amount of\r\n  the marital tax liability to Wife.Â  To effect a 50/50 allocation of the original\r\n  tax debt incurred during the marriage, we attribute to Wife another 14.6% of\r\n  the original tax liability, $260,832, which amounts to $38,081.Â  Adding this\r\n  amount to the 35.4% Wife already paid through her income tax withholdings and\r\n  payments effects a nearly 50/50 split of the original tax liability incurred\r\n  during the marriage.Â  The remainder of the original tax liability incurred\r\n  during the marriage remains the marital debt of Husband, and Husband is solely\r\n  responsible for any penalties or liens resulting from his failure to file state\r\n  and federal income taxes. \r\nIII. Special\r\n  Equity in Marital Home\r\nHusband argues\r\n  the family court erred in determining the $40,000 down payment toward the\r\n  marital home provided by Wife's parents was a loan and by awarding Wife a\r\n  $30,000 special equity in the home on that basis.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Loans from\r\n  close family members must be closely scrutinized for legitimacy.&quot;Â  Jenkins\r\n    v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 104, 545 S.E.2d 531, 539 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In Jenkins,\r\n  Wife and Mother testified Mother loaned Wife and Wife's husband money for home\r\n  renovations.Â  Id. at 103-04, 545 S.E.3d at 539.Â  &quot;Neither Wife nor\r\n  [M]other, however, introduced into evidence a promissory note or cancelled\r\n  check as proof that the payment was a loan.Â  In fact, [Mother] acknowledged\r\n  Husband and Wife never signed any kind of note or I.O.U. because [she] never\r\n  asked them to do so.&quot;Â  Id. at 104, 545 S.E.2d at 539.Â  This court,\r\n  in reversing the family court, determined the evidence established at most a\r\n  &quot;moral obligation&quot; to repay Mother.Â  Id. at 104, 545 S.E.2d at\r\n  540. \r\nIn this case, neither\r\n  party disputes that Wife's parents provided her with $40,000 to put toward the\r\n  down payment of the marital home.Â  Wife's mother described this transaction as\r\n  a loan, and Wife and her mother testified that Wife had been paying her mother\r\n  back sporadically although neither knew the exact amount of any payments.[5]Â  Wife's mother estimated about\r\n  $30,000 was still outstanding on the loan.Â  Neither Wife nor her mother could\r\n  produce any documentary evidence of indebtedness or repayment or the\r\n  outstanding balance.Â  This evidence was insufficient to establish the advance\r\n  of the funds from Wife's mother was a loan.[6]Â  \r\nFurthermore, the\r\n  family court erred in removing the down payment funds as a special equity to\r\n  Wife prior to equitable distribution.Â  The issue of &quot;special equity&quot;\r\n  in marital property was addressed recently by the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  in Dawkins v. Dawkins, 386 S.C. 169, 687 S.E.2d 52 (2010), abrogated\r\n    on other grounds by Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 709 S.E.2d 650 (2011).Â \r\n  In Dawkins, the basis for special equity in the marital home was the\r\n  fact that the home had been inherited from Husband's mother, but the rationale\r\n  is equally applicable with respect to a gift of funds for a down payment.Â  Id. at 173, 687 S.E.2d at 54.Â  The court in Dawkins Â determined any special\r\n  equity Husband had in the marital home was not to be apportioned separately but\r\n  was to be considered as a factor in equitable distribution.Â  Id. at\r\n  173-74, 687 S.E.2d at 54.\r\n\r\n  We approve of the approach announced in Toler, [v. Toler,\r\n    292 S.C. 374, 356 S.E.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1987)] decided after adoption of the\r\n    equitable apportionment statute, as the sole method in accounting for a\r\n    spouse's special equity in marital property and hold that &quot;the correct way\r\n    to treat [an] inheritance is as a contribution by [the inheriting party] to the\r\n    acquisition of marital property [and that] [t]his contribution should be taken\r\n    into account in determining the percentage of the marital estate to which [the\r\n    inheriting party] is equitably entitled upon distribution.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. (all alterations except first in\r\n  original) (quoting Toler, 293 S.C. at 380 n.1, 356 S.E.2d at 432\r\n  n.1).Â Â Â  \r\nHere, as in Dawkins,\r\n  Wife does not argue the home is not marital property to be equitably\r\n  apportioned between Husband and Wife. Furthermore, Wife has not appealed the\r\n  family court's finding that the $30,000 is part of the marital estate, so that\r\n  point is the law of the case.[7]Â \r\n  Consequently, following the formula set forth in Dawkins, we order the\r\n  $30,000 awarded as a special equity to Wife be included in the marital home's\r\n  equity and divided 50/50 between the parties.Â  This results in a $15,000 reduction\r\n  in overall equitable apportionment to Wife and a $15,000 increase in equitable\r\n  apportionment to Husband.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Wife's\r\n  401(k), Stock Options, Automobiles, and Cash Advances\r\nNext, Husband\r\n  contends the family court erred in failing to address certain pieces of\r\n  property in its order and in failing to consider post-separation withdrawals\r\n  Wife made from her 401(k) account when making its equitable distribution\r\n  award.Â  We disagree.\r\nAfter the parties\r\n  separated, Wife withdrew monies from her 401(k) account with CINTAS.Â  Part of\r\n  what she withdrew was nonmarital property as it was money she contributed prior\r\n  to the marriage and subsequent to the filing of marital litigation.Â  The marital\r\n  portion of Wife's 401(k), as of the date of filing, was $45,155.Â  The family\r\n  court divided this amount equally between Husband and Wife in the equitable\r\n  distribution.Â  Husband claims the family court failed to consider withdrawals\r\n  Wife made prior to the final hearing.Â  However, if the family court had not\r\n  considered the withdrawals, the value of the 401(k) for equitable division\r\n  would have been $10,599, the amount remaining in the account after Wife's\r\n  advances.Â  Therefore, the family court properly valued the 401(k) for equitable\r\n  distribution.Â  \r\nHusband also\r\n  argues the family court erred in not considering Wife's CINTAS stock options\r\n  among the marital assets for equitable division.Â  However, this issue was not\r\n  addressed in the family court's order, and Husband did not raise it in his Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion.[8] Â Â Therefore, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  903, 907 (2007) (stating to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review, issue must have been raised\r\n  to and rule upon by the trial\r\n  court).\r\nHusband argues\r\n  the family court abused its discretion by not considering the parties'\r\n  automobiles in the equitable distribution award.Â  Wife testified she paid the\r\n  $16,000 outstanding on her Mercedes with her marital share of the 401(k).Â  Because\r\n  the family court did not specifically address Wife's car or Husband's Suburban\r\n  in its order, the result is the parties are responsible for their own vehicle.Â \r\n  While the family court is instructed to &quot;set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law to support [its] decision,&quot; the failure to do so does not require a\r\n  remand.Â  Rule 26(a), SCRFC. Â &quot;[W]hen an order from the family\r\n  court is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), SCRFC, the appellate court 'may\r\n  remand the matter to the trial court or, where the record is sufficient, make\r\n  its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.'&quot;Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d\r\n  526, 535 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524,\r\n  405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991)).\r\nThe record\r\n  contains no finding regarding Husband's 2003 motorcycle or the $3,000 advanced\r\n  to Wife by Husband during the pendency of the divorce.Â  However, assuming the\r\n  family court would have split equally the equity in the motorcycle, valued by\r\n  Husband at $7,444.77, Wife would have gained $3,722.38 to her side of the\r\n  equitable division.Â  By not equitably dividing the motorcycle, the family court,\r\n  in effect, repaid the $3,000 advance to Husband by allowing him to keep the\r\n  asset.Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  record before us and in our view of the preponderance of the evidence, the\r\n  result of the family court's action, or inaction, was appropriate in the\r\n  general scheme of equitable division.Â  By the parties keeping their respective\r\n  car or motorcycle, the family court has made an in-kind distribution, which is\r\n  favored, and permitted the parties to become disentangled from each other\r\n  financially with respect to those items.Â  See Craig v. Craig, 358\r\n  S.C. 548, 557-58, 595 S.E.2d 837, 842 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;The court, however, should first attempt an\r\n  'in-kind' distribution of the marital\r\n  assets.&quot;).Â  Therefore, we affirm the family court's distribution of these\r\n  assets.\r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marital\r\n  Home Equity â€“ Tax Liens and Mortgage Payments\r\n\r\nHusband claims the\r\n  family court erred in not subtracting the outstanding tax liens on the home in\r\n  determining the amount of equity in the marital home.Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe tax liens are a\r\n  direct result of Husband's failure to pay income taxes.Â  As previously\r\n  discussed, Husband conceded at oral argument that penalties resulting from his\r\n  failure to pay income taxes are properly assigned to him.Â  It would penalize\r\n  Wife to include the liens in determining the equity amount.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  affirm the family court's decision not to consider the tax liens in determining\r\n  the equity in the marital home.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAdditionally, we\r\n  affirm the family court's decision not to credit Husband with his ongoing\r\n  mortgage payments since Wife vacated the marital home.Â  Husband and Wife were\r\n  living separate and apart and paying approximately $1,600 per month in mortgage\r\n  payments and rent respectively.Â  These were the parties' living expenses\r\n  post-separation and do not entitle Husband to any special credit.Â \r\n  \r\n  VI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\n  Husband argues the family\r\n    court erred in not holding Wife responsible for his attorney's fees.Â  We\r\n    disagree.\r\n  The award of\r\n    attorney's fees in a domestic action rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n    family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d\r\n    901, 903 (1988).Â  In deciding whether to award attorney's fees and costs, the\r\n    family court should consider &quot;(1) the party's ability to pay his/her own\r\n    attorney's fee; (2) beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the\r\n    parties' respective financial conditions; [and] (4) effect of the attorney's\r\n    fee on each party's standard of living.&quot;Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307\r\n    S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining a reasonable\r\n    attorney's fee the family court should consider &quot;(1) the nature, extent,\r\n    and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3)\r\n    professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5)\r\n    beneficial results obtained; [and] (6) customary legal fees for similar\r\n    services.&quot;Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d\r\n    313, 315 (1991). \r\n  As discussed\r\n    previously, the parties were similarly situated economically during the\r\n    marriage and have the same means for earning income as before.Â  Furthermore,\r\n    even if we modify the original tax liability and special equity determination,\r\n    Husband did not obtain greatly beneficial results beyond those of Wife.Â  The\r\n    assets and debts are split 50/50 and Husband is still responsible for the tax\r\n    penalties, a major point of contention in the original equitable distribution\r\n    and appeal.Â  Therefore, we discern no error in the family court's decision not\r\n    to award Husband attorney's fees.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We affirm the family court's\r\n    equitable distribution award with the following modifications: Wife and Husband\r\n    shall bear the original tax liability incurred during their marriage in a 50/50\r\n    ratio.Â  Because Wife has already paid approximately 35.4% of the marital taxes,\r\n    the remaining debt assessed to Wife is 14.6% of the total tax liability\r\n    incurred by both parties during the marriageâ€“$38,081.Â  We find the $40,000\r\n    advance from Wife's parents for the down payment on the marital home was not a\r\n    loan, and the $30,000 special equity awarded to Wife is to be included in the\r\n    equity calculation of the marital home and divided equally between Husband and\r\n    Wife.Â  We affirm the result of the family court's order with respect to the\r\n    personal property of the parties, and we affirm the family court's denial of\r\n    attorney's fees to Husband.\r\n  AFFIRMED IN PART AS\r\n    MODIFIED AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n  FEW, C.J., and THOMAS, J.,\r\n    concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of\r\n  the final hearing, the outstanding tax liability including penalties and late\r\n  fees was $323,506.72.\r\n[2] The factors are\r\n  duration of the marriage and ages of the parties, marital misconduct, the value\r\n  of marital property, income of the parties, health of the parties, need for\r\n  additional training to reach income potential, nonmarital property, retirement\r\n  accounts, alimony, desirability of awarding marital home to either party, tax\r\n  consequences, support obligations to other parties, debts of the parties, child\r\n  custody, and other considerations the court deems appropriate.Â  Â§ 20-3-620(B).\r\n[3] In his\r\n  appellate brief, Husband took the position that Wife should bear a proportional\r\n  share of the outstanding tax liability as well as the penalties assessed\r\n  because of the failure to pay.Â  At oral argument, Husband conceded Wife should\r\n  not be responsible for penalties arising from the past-due income tax debt.Â \r\n  Therefore, we limit our discussion to the equitable apportionment of the\r\n  original tax debt.\r\n[4] Husband was\r\n  asked:\r\n\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  You heard your wife's testimony?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Absolutely, yes.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  And you heard her testify that\r\n  you never refused to give her money?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  That's correct.\r\n\r\nNo\r\n  objection was raised to the characterization of Wife's testimony.\r\n[5] Wife's mother\r\n  testified she obtained the $40,000 through a home equity line of credit.Â  Wife indicated that some months she paid the interest on the\r\n  line of credit as payment toward the loan to her and Husband.Â  \r\n[6] Wife listed\r\n  this as a debt on her financial declaration and claimed she had made payments\r\n  to her mother.Â  In Jenkins, Wife did not list the debt and no testimony\r\n  was presented regarding any repayment.\r\n[7] The\r\n  South Carolina Code indicates a gift to a person from someone other than his or\r\n  her spouse is nonmarital property.Â  See Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1) (stating &quot;property\r\n  acquired by either party by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party\r\n  other than the spouse&quot; is nonmarital).Â  The burden is then on the party\r\n  seeking to establish the asset is marital in nature.\r\n[8] Language used\r\n  in the family court's order denying Husband's 59(e) motion suggests the family\r\n  court may have ruled from the bench on issues not addressed in its order.Â \r\n  However, that portion of the transcript is not included in the record on\r\n  appeal.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4882","title":"Palmetto Co. v.

Maddox, Jr., of Spartanburg, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: Sean\r\n  McMahon appeals the circuit court's affirming the magistrate's court's ruling\r\n  that the ten-year statute of limitations found in section 15-3-350 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2005) applies to the collection of rent due under a commercial\r\n  lease.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY[2]\r\nOn April 13, 1997, McMahon\r\n  and Palmetto Company entered into a written agreement in which McMahon leased\r\n  real property from Palmetto Company.Â  The lease was from May 1, 1997, to April\r\n  30, 1998, and had an automatic renewal provision for successive twelve-month\r\n  periods unless either party terminated with three months' notice.Â  In 2000, McMahon\r\n  began making sporadic payments.\r\nOn April 22, 2008, Palmetto\r\n  Company filed an application and affidavit for collection of rent by distraint\r\n  in the magistrate's court. Â The magistrate's court heard oral arguments on the\r\n  proper statute of limitations.[3]Â \r\n  McMahon argued the statute of limitations was three years under section\r\n  15-3-530(1) of the South Carolina Code (2005), action upon a contract.Â \r\n  Palmetto Company argued it was ten years under section 15-3-350 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2005), cause of action founded upon a title to real property or\r\n  to rents out of the same.Â  The magistrate's court found the ten-year statute of\r\n  limitations applies when a party seeks to recover rents owed under a lease\r\n  agreement.Â  McMahon appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the\r\n  magistrate's court's ruling.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Determining the proper\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and this [c]ourt reviews\r\n  questions of law de novo.&quot;Â  Town\r\n    of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40,\r\n  41 (2008).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcMahon argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in affirming the magistrate's court's ruling that the ten-year\r\n  statute of limitations from section 15-3-350 applies rather than the three-year\r\n  statute of limitations from section 15-3-530.Â  McMahon contends the language in\r\n  the statute is clear and unambiguous that the three-year limitation applies to\r\n  contracts and a commercial lease agreement is a contract.Â  He further maintains\r\n  section 15-3-350 does not apply because it is only for an action founded upon\r\n  title to real property and actions for rent based upon title to real property. Â We\r\n  agree.\r\n&quot;A lease\r\n  agreement is a contract . . . .&quot;Â  Middleton v.\r\n    Eubank, 388 S.C. 8, 14, 694 S.E.2d 31, 34&nbsp;(Ct.

Â We remand for a new trial as\r\n  to the valuation of one asset of the marital estate.[1]\r\nI.  Facts and Procedural History\r\nPaul and Hala Nestberg\r\n  married on September 28, 1996.Â  A little over a month before they married, Paul\r\n  bought a fourteen-acre piece of land, which was titled only in his name.Â  He\r\n  purchased the property with borrowed funds secured by two mortgages, one to the\r\n  seller and one to his stepmother. Â Hala went with him to look at the property\r\n  but did not attend the closing.Â  Paul and Hala intended to live together in the\r\n  home on the property after they married, and did so for their entire marriage.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nIn January 2001, Paul\r\n  lost his job.Â  For the next six months he was able to use his severance\r\n  benefits to make the mortgage payments on the property.Â  Paul never secured\r\n  other employment. Â Hala took a second job, and for the remainder of the\r\n  marriage, the couple used her salary to pay the mortgages.\r\nAbout the time his\r\n  severance package ran out, Paul said he &quot;began looking into\r\n  developing&quot; the property.Â  He divided the property into fifteen parcels,\r\n  one for their marital home and fourteen to sell as lots in a new residential\r\n  subdivision.Â  In January 2002, Paul formed Eastview Development Company and\r\n  transferred the fourteen lots to Eastview.Â  The property was slow to sell, and\r\n  by 2006 Paul had sold only three lots. \r\nIn 2006, Paul met another\r\n  couple and formed the Danielson Company with them to continue developing the\r\n  subdivision.Â  On December 11, 2006, Paul filed for divorce on the ground of\r\n  Hala's alleged physical cruelty.Â  However, in March 2007 Paul agreed to dismiss\r\n  the complaint, and they attempted to reconcile their marriage.Â  Two months\r\n  later Hala moved out, and on May 11, 2007, she filed a complaint for an order\r\n  of separate maintenance and support, equitable division of marital assets,\r\n  attorney's fees, and a restraining order preventing the parties from disposing\r\n  of any assets.Â  Paul answered and requested a divorce on the ground of living\r\n  separate and apart without cohabitation for a period of one year.Â  On August 1,\r\n  2008, the family court granted the divorce.\r\nBetween the December 2006\r\n  and May 2007 filings, Paul sold the six remaining subdivision lots.Â  Hala\r\n  contends Paul sold them at prices below fair market value to intentionally\r\n  devalue Eastview in contemplation of marital litigation.Â  Paul contends he needed\r\n  to sell them to avoid bankruptcy.Â  \r\nOn July 6, 2009, the\r\n  family court issued its order addressing equitable division and attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  The court found the property and home were marital property and,\r\n  therefore, Eastview was also marital property.Â  The court concluded five lots\r\n  sold between December 2006 and May 2007 &quot;were sold far below fair market\r\n  value . . . in contemplation of marital litigation.&quot;Â  The court adjusted\r\n  the equitable division based on the finding of marital economic misconduct.[2]Â \r\n  Finally, the court granted Hala's request for attorney's fees and costs because\r\n  it found she prevailed on the main issue in this case, the valuation of\r\n  Eastview.Â  \r\nPaul appeals arguing\r\n  three issues: (1) Eastview and the home should be nonmarital property, (2)\r\n  alternatively, if the property is found to be marital, the court erred in finding\r\n  he committed marital economic misconduct and in considering that misconduct in\r\n  equitable distribution, and (3) the court erred in awarding Hala attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  Hala also appeals arguing three issues: (1) the court should have given Eastview\r\n  a higher value, (2) the court should have given the Danielson Company a higher\r\n  value, and (3) a $20,000 promissory note accompanying the sale of the house\r\n  should not have been classified as a marital debt.Â  \r\nWe review the family\r\n  court's decision de novo.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d\r\n  650, 652 (2011).Â  While we have the authority to make our own findings of fact,\r\n  we commonly defer to the family court's factual findings of credibility because\r\n  it is in a superior\r\n  position to assess the demeanor of witnesses.Â  392 S.C. at 390-91, 709 S.E.2d\r\n  at 654-55. Â It is the appellant's burden to demonstrate the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence is against the family court's factual findings.Â  392 S.C. at 391,\r\n  709 S.E.2d at 655. \r\nII.&nbsp; Paul's Appeal\r\n\r\na.&nbsp; Home and Eastview as Marital Property\r\n\r\nSection 20-3-630(A)(2)\r\n  &amp; (3) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) excludes from the term\r\n  &quot;marital property&quot; any &quot;property acquired by either party before\r\n  the marriage&quot; and &quot;property acquired by either party in exchange for\r\n  property described in items (1) and (2) of this section.&quot;Â  Based\r\n  on this statute, Paul and Hala's home and the property transferred to Eastview\r\n  are nonmarital property because Paul bought them &quot;before the\r\n  marriage.&quot;Â  Â§ 20-3-630(A)(2).Â  However, the family court found the\r\n  property had been transmuted into marital property. \r\nNonmarital property &quot;may\r\n  be transmuted . . . if it is used by the parties Â . . . in some manner so as to\r\n  evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.&quot;[3]Â  Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 157, 439 S.E.2d 312, 314 (Ct. App. 1993).Â \r\n  &quot;Transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each\r\n  case.&quot;Â  Smallwood v. Smallwood, 392 S.C. 574, 579, 709 S.E.2d 543,\r\n  545 (Ct. App. 2011); Murray, 312 S.C. at 157, 439 S.E.2d at 315.Â \r\n  &quot;The spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective evidence showing\r\n  that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the\r\n  common property of the marriage.&quot;Â  Smallwood, 392 S.C. at 579, 709\r\n  S.E.2d at 545-46.Â  Such evidence &quot;'may include . . . using the property\r\n  exclusively for marital purposes, . . . using marital funds to build equity in\r\n  the property, or exchanging the property for marital property.'&quot;Â  392 S.C.\r\n  at 579, 709 S.E.2d at 546 (quoting Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295,\r\n  372 S.E.2d 107, 111 (Ct. App. 1988)).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe facts of this case\r\n  demonstrate that Paul and Hala regarded the property as common property of the\r\n  marriage.Â  In addition to the fact that they lived in the home for the duration\r\n  of their marriage, Hala's primary role in paying the mortgages for five years after\r\n  Paul lost his job tips the scale in favor of transmutation.Â  Her salary from\r\n  both jobs was placed into a joint checking account until Paul's December 2006\r\n  divorce filing.Â  The joint checking account contained marital funds that were used\r\n  to build equity in the property by paying the mortgages.Â  Paul agreed he relied\r\n  on Hala's income and credit cards to develop the land he transferred to\r\n  Eastview and that, &quot;to a degree,&quot; Hala &quot;had been carrying the\r\n  majority of the income for five years.&quot; Â Hala testified that after she\r\n  quit contributing to the joint checking account, Paul could not make the mortgage\r\n  payments.Â  Finally, Paul conceded that even after he got business capital from\r\n  his business partners in the Danielson Company, he still needed Hala's income\r\n  to pay for his personal expenses, including the mortgages on the property.Â Â Â  \r\nBecause the property was\r\n  transmuted into marital property, it remained marital after Paul transferred it\r\n  to Eastview Development Company.Â  Therefore, we agree with the family court\r\n  that Eastview and the home are marital property.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-630(A)(3) (Supp. 2010).\r\n\r\nb.&nbsp; Valuation of Eastview\r\n\r\nBoth parties dispute the\r\n  proper valuation of Eastview.Â  As we explain below, we reverse the family\r\n  court's valuation of Eastview and remand for a new trial on this issue.Â  \r\nFor purposes of equitable\r\n  division, marital property should be valued as of the date the marital\r\n  litigation was filed.Â  Gardner v. Gardner, 368 S.C. 134, 136, 628 S.E.2d\r\n  37, 38 (2006).Â  When there are two filing dates, the court must use the date of\r\n  the filing of the litigation which lead to the equitable division.Â  See Hickum\r\n    v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 100, 463 S.E.2d 321, 323 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding\r\n  the &quot;litigation required 'to trigger the statute must be the same\r\n  litigation which brings about the equitable division.' . . . 'It is not enough\r\n  that the parties in the past engaged in some litigation if that litigation did\r\n  not serve as the vehicle for equitable division'&quot; (quoting Shannon v.\r\n    Shannon, 301 S.C. 107, 112, 390 S.E.2d 380, 383 (Ct. App. 1990))).Â  Because\r\n  the May 2007 action filed by Hala is the litigation which brought about the\r\n  equitable division in this case, May 11, 2007, is the correct date of valuation\r\n  for the Nestbergs' marital property.\r\nIn making its decision as\r\n  to the value of Eastview, the family court considered the fact that Paul sold\r\n  five lots between December 2006 and May 2007 for less than market value.Â  In\r\n  light of this consideration, the family court changed the date of valuation for\r\n  Eastview from May 11, 2007, to the date Paul filed his action in December\r\n  2006.Â  We hold this was error.Â  We find Paul did not engage in marital economic\r\n  misconduct by selling the lots below market value, and thus the valuation of\r\n  Eastview may not be adjusted to account for those sales.[4]Â  \r\nIn ordering an\r\n  equitable apportionment of marital property, the family court must consider any\r\n  marital misconduct that &quot;affects or has affected the economic\r\n  circumstances of the parties.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(B)(2) (Supp.\r\n  2010). Â This court discussed the use of marital economic misconduct in\r\n  equitable division in Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 390 S.E.2d 376\r\n  (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In Panhorst, the husband regularly gave his mother\r\n  cash gifts totaling between $25,000 and $30,000 throughout the parties'\r\n  twenty-year marriage.Â  301 S.C. at 104, 390 S.E.2d at 378-79.Â  Because the wife\r\n  did not know about the gifts, she claimed &quot;the family court should have\r\n  treated them as part of the marital estate subject to equitable\r\n  division.&quot;Â  301 S.C. at 104, 390 S.E.2d at 379.Â  This court disagreed for\r\n  two reasons.Â  First, we concluded the property was not subject to equitable\r\n  division because &quot;at the time the action was filed, it no longer belonged\r\n  to either of the Panhorsts as the statute requires.&quot;Â  301 S.C. at 104-05,\r\n  390 S.E.2d at 379.Â  Second, we found no evidence that the husband gave the\r\n  money to his mother in contemplation of marital litigation.Â  301 S.C. at\r\n  105-06, 390 S.E.2d at 379.Â  Because we found no evidence of fraudulent intent\r\n  or purposeful reduction of the marital estate in contemplation of marital\r\n  litigation, this court refused to include the gifts as part of the marital\r\n  estate for equitable division.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn McDavid v. McDavid,\r\n  333 S.C. 490, 492-93, 511 S.E.2d 365, 366-67 (1999), the supreme court addressed\r\n  the question of whether money the husband used in support of his failing\r\n  business without his wife's knowledge should be deducted from his equitable\r\n  distribution.Â  Similar to the argument Hala makes in this case, the wife argued\r\n  her husband's actions constituted &quot;marital misconduct&quot; that &quot;affected\r\n  the economic circumstances of the parties,&quot; and therefore should be\r\n  considered in making an equitable apportionment.Â  333 S.C. at 493, 511 S.E.2d\r\n  at 367.Â  The supreme court disagreed and held &quot;poor business decisions, in\r\n  and of themselves, do not warrant a finding of marital 'misconduct,' and that\r\n  there must be some evidence of willful misconduct, bad faith, intention to\r\n  dissipate marital assets, or the like, before a court may alter the equitable\r\n  distribution award for such misconduct.&quot;Â  333 S.C. at 496, 511 S.E.2d at\r\n  368.Â  Because the court found &quot;no such evidence,&quot; it did not deduct\r\n  from the husband's equitable distribution.Â  Id.Â  \r\nFinally, in Deidun v.\r\n  Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 59, 606 S.E.2d 489, 496 (Ct. App. 2004), this court\r\n  upheld a finding of marital economic misconduct and took it into account in\r\n  making the equitable division.Â  The wife hid from her husband the accumulation\r\n  of over $450,500 in credit card debt, increase in lines of credit by $13,218,\r\n  and withdrawal of almost $27,000 from an IRA.Â  362 S.C. at 58-59, 606 S.E.2d at\r\n  495.Â  This court distinguished the facts from McDavid, stating:\r\n>Although\r\n  there is nothing in the record to indicate that Wife\r\n  acted with any bad faith in her spending habits, we believe McDavid is\r\n  more applicable to cases involving business expenditures. Â Wife's depletion of\r\n  marital funds and increase of the marital debt in the present case were not to\r\n  support a failing business. Â Accordingly, we find McDavid inapplicable\r\n  in the present case and the family court's consideration of Wife's failure to\r\n  appropriately manage the family finances was not error.\r\n362 S.C. at 60, 606\r\n  S.E.2d at 49.Â  Because the wife's &quot;spending amounted to Â . . . economic\r\n  misconduct,&quot; this court affirmed the family court's decision to consider\r\n  it in granting the husband a higher percentage of the marital assets.Â  362 S.C.\r\n  at 55, 61-62, 606 S.E.2d at 493, 497.Â  \r\nHere, the facts involve\r\n  challenged business expenditures.Â  Therefore, the family court must find the\r\n  allegedly at fault party engaged in &quot;willful misconduct, bad faith,\r\n  intention[al] . . . dissipat[ion of] marital assets, or the like&quot; before\r\n  it may alter the equitable distribution of marital property based on economic\r\n  misconduct. Â McDavid, 333 S.C. at 496, 511 S.E.2d at 368.Â  \r\nThe family court made no\r\n  such finding in this case.Â  The only factual finding made by the family court\r\n  is that &quot;these sales were made in contemplation of marital\r\n  litigation.&quot;Â  This finding will not support the family court's decision to\r\n  alter the equitable distribution.Â  \r\nWe find the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence does not support any of the findings required to alter the\r\n  equitable distribution of marital property based on economic misconduct.Â  While\r\n  most of the lots sold after the December 2006 filing were sold below market\r\n  value, we find Paul's decision to do so was reasonable under the circumstances.Â \r\n  Paul explained his decision as follows:\r\n>Well,\r\n  I was covered up with debt, under financial stress, had no income myself.Â  Hala\r\n  quit contributing any income whatever as of January of that year.Â  So, during\r\n  that time, I was having to depend on whatever money I could generate from my\r\n  work or from sales of the lot or whatever.Â  Someone came along and offered me\r\n  money for those lots.Â  I looked at it as an opportunity to pay debt, and that's\r\nexactly what I did.\r\nSimilarly, one of Paul's\r\n  economic experts testified Paul's actions in selling the lots for low prices\r\n  &quot;makes a lot of sense when you look at the financial health of Paul\r\n  Nestberg individually.Â  He owed over $150,000 in credit cards.Â  He didn't\r\n  maintain the debts and the lots without going into bankruptcy.Â  It made it very\r\n  possible to sell those lots.&quot;Â  Later in his testimony, the expert said\r\n  &quot;there would be reason to suspect that the company . . . without selling\r\n  the lots could not stay in business.&quot;Â  We agree with the expert that\r\n  selling the lots below market value made good sense under the circumstances.Â  Because\r\n  we find Paul did not engage in willful misconduct or bad faith, did not intend\r\n  to dissipate marital assets, and did not purposefully reduce the value of\r\n  Eastview in contemplation of marital litigation, we reverse the family court's\r\n  decision to alter the valuation of Eastview.Â  \r\nOn remand, the family\r\n  court must determine the value of Eastview as of May 11, 2007, and apportion it\r\n  without any consideration of marital economic misconduct.\r\n\r\nc.&nbsp;Hala's Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nThe family court awarded\r\n  attorney's fees to Hala because it found she prevailed on the main issue in the\r\n  case and Paul was in a better position to pay.Â  Because we reverse the family\r\n  court's valuation of Eastview, on remand, the family court must reconsider\r\n  whether to award attorney's fees and, if so, how much.Â  See Sexton v.\r\n    Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503-04, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993) (reversing and\r\n  remanding attorney's fees issue for reconsideration when the substantive\r\n  results achieved by trial counsel were reversed on appeal); Pruitt v. Pruitt,\r\n  389 S.C. 250, 274, 697 S.E.2d 702, 715 (Ct. App. 2010) (remanding for\r\n  reconsideration of attorney's fees where the court also remanded for a\r\n  determination of whether wife had equity interest in home).\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Hala's Appeal\r\n\r\nWe decline to address Hala's\r\n  two remaining issuesâ€”the value of Danielson Company and a $20,000 promissory\r\n  note accompanying the sale of the house included as marital debtâ€”because we\r\n  find they are not preserved for our review.Â  Although the two issues were\r\n  mentioned briefly at the hearing on the motions to reconsider, Hala did not\r\n  object to the judge's ruling as to either issue.Â  At the end of the hearing,\r\n  the judge did a &quot;recap to make sure [she] got the crux of everybody's\r\n  argument.&quot;Â  However, the judge did not mention the value of Danielson or\r\n  the note.Â  The order addressing the motions to reconsider lists each party's arguments,\r\n  but does not mention the value of Danielson or the note as marital debt.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the issues are unpreserved.Â  Nicholson v. Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 537,\r\n  663 S.E.2d 74, 81-82 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating an issue must have been raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved on appeal, and if the trial\r\n  court does not rule on an issue and the appellant does not raise it in a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion, it is unpreserved).\r\n\r\nIV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe affirm the finding\r\n  that the home and Eastview are marital property.Â  We reverse the family court's\r\n  valuation of Eastview, and remand for a new trial as to that issue and the\r\n  issue of attorney's fees.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Marital economic misconduct is a factor the family court must consider in\r\n  making an equitable apportionment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(B)(2) (Supp.\r\n  2010) (&quot;In making apportionment, the court must give weight in such proportion\r\n  as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors: . . . (2) marital\r\n    misconduct or fault of either or both parties, . . . if the misconduct\r\n  affects or has affected the economic circumstances of the parties . . .\r\n  .&quot; (emphases added)).\r\n[3] Our courts recognize other ways in which nonmarital property can be transmuted\r\n  into marital property.Â  See Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98,\r\n  545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating nonmarital property may be\r\n  transmuted if &quot;it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be\r\n  untraceable; [or if] it is jointly titled&quot;).\r\n[4] We also note the family court should not change the date of valuation in order\r\n  to account for the effect of the marital economic misconduct.Â  The filing date\r\n  of the litigation which brought about the equitable division is always the\r\n  correct valuation date.Â  Using that date, the family court adjusts what\r\n  property is included in the marital estate, how much each party receives in the\r\n  division of the estate, or both, to account for the effect the marital economic\r\n  misconduct had on the value of the estate.Â  S.C.

Burbage, (collectively &quot;Sellers&quot;)\r\n  and Barbara Daniels' (&quot;Daniels&quot;) motion for a new trial absolute.Â  On\r\n  cross-appeal, Sellers and Daniels claim the trial court committed reversible\r\n  error when it (1) applied the Residential Property Condition Disclosure Act[1] (&quot;the Act&quot;) to a non-residential transaction; (2) failed to grant\r\n  Sellers' motion for a directed verdict; and (3) allowed Buyers to introduce a\r\n  consent order issued by another state agency from a separate proceeding in\r\n  violation of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe underlying negligence action stems from the purchase of\r\n  a piece of real estate located at 2105 South Live Oak Drive in Moncks Corner,\r\n  South Carolina (&quot;the Property&quot;).Â  At the time of the sale, the\r\n  Property consisted of several small storage sheds, an unoccupied house,\r\n  and a commercial block building.Â  Sellers inherited the Property from their\r\n  deceased mother in 1999.Â  Sellers rented the house on the Property for several\r\n  years before enlisting the services of Daniels, a real estate agent for\r\n  Prudential Carolina, in an effort to sell it.Â  When Daniels listed the\r\n  Property, the house had been vacant for approximately one and a half years.Â  \r\nDaniels initially listed the Property for sale in March 2001\r\n  for $180,000.Â  Due to little interest in the Property, Sellers relisted the\r\n  Property on several occasions between March 2001 and October 2004.Â  Sellers\r\n  eventually sold the Property for $110,000 in November 2004 to Buyers.Â  \r\nPrior to Buyers closing on the Property, three prospective\r\n  purchasers attempted to buy the Property from Sellers.Â  The first buyer, Laura\r\n  Shambrook, noticed some type of growth on the walls in the house.Â  After a lab\r\n  report dated September 4, 2004, confirmed the presence of mold, Ms. Shambrook\r\n  attempted to purchase the Property for approximately $80,000. Ms. Shambrook\r\n  showed the mold disclosure report to Daniels and Sellers in hopes they would\r\n  lower their asking price; however, Sellers were unwilling to accept her offer,\r\n  and the contract fell through.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, a second prospective buyer, Anna Oster,\r\n  contacted Daniels about the Property.Â  Daniels testified she disclosed the\r\n  presence of mold to Ms. Oster when she showed her the house and surrounding\r\n  property, but Ms. Oster stated otherwise at trial.Â  On September 14, 2004, Ms.\r\n  Oster's real estate agent submitted an offer on a &quot;Residential Agreement\r\n  to Buy and Sell&quot; form to purchase the Property for $125,000.Â  During\r\n  negotiations, Ms. Oster's agent also requested a residential disclosure form.Â \r\n  Daniels never produced a residential disclosure form, but four days after\r\n  receiving Ms. Oster's offer, Daniels faxed a copy of the mold report to Ms.\r\n  Oster's agent.Â  Daniels claimed the deal fell apart because the Sellers would\r\n  not agree to the terms of Ms. Oster's offer; Ms. Oster, however, stated that\r\n  once Daniels disclosed the presence of mold in the house, the negotiations\r\n  ended.Â  \r\nDuring the same month, a third prospective purchaser, Edward\r\n  Spence, attempted to purchase the Property for $110,000.Â  On September 23,\r\n  2004, the parties entered into a &quot;General Use And Lots/Acreage&quot;\r\n  contract.Â  The contract contained no &quot;as is&quot; language and was\r\n  contingent only upon Mr. Spence obtaining financing.Â  A mold disclosure and\r\n  waiver form was also attached to the contract, which Mr. Spence and Daniels\r\n  signed on September 27, 2004.Â  The parties never closed on the contract due to\r\n  Mr. Spence's failure to obtain financing.Â  \r\nFollowing Mr. Spence's inability to obtain financing,\r\n  Daniels told Mr. Winters about the Property because she knew Mr. Winters was\r\n  looking for some commercial property.Â  Buyers and Daniels had a pre-existing\r\n  relationship at the time Buyers bought the Property because Daniels had\r\n  recently sold Buyers their primary residence.Â  Daniels showed Mr. Winters the\r\n  Property, at which time Mr. Winters noticed what he called &quot;dirty\r\n  water&quot; on the walls of several rooms in the house.Â  However, Mr.\r\n  Winters stated Daniels never mentioned the presence of mold in the house.Â  \r\nBuyers and Sellers subsequently entered into a &quot;General\r\n  Use And Lots/Acreage&quot; contract for the purchase of the property for\r\n  $110,000.Â  Daniels prepared the contract and included language to convey the\r\n  property &quot;as is.&quot;Â  Mr. Winters agreed the &quot;as is&quot; language\r\n  was present when he signed the contract but claimed Daniels added the language,\r\n  &quot;[b]uyer acknowledges the presence of mold in the house,&quot; after he\r\n  signed the contract, and he was unaware of this language until the underlying\r\n  suit was commenced. Â Daniels countered Mr. Winters' testimony at trial\r\n  and stated she told Mr. Winters about the mold, but it was immaterial to him\r\n  because he was going to tear down the house as soon as they closed on the\r\n  Property.Â  Mr. Winters testified no disclosures were made about the presence of\r\n  mold at the closing. Â He stated he was unaware of its existence in the house\r\n  until Ms. Oster, one of the prior prospective buyers, walked onto the Property\r\n  one day and disclosed it to him while he was repairing the house.Â  \r\nBuyers filed suit against Sellers and Daniels for failure to\r\n  disclose the presence of toxic mold in the house and for failure to provide\r\n  Buyers with written reports in Sellers and Daniels' possession confirming the\r\n  existence of toxic mold.Â  Buyers additionally asserted Daniels breached certain\r\n  sections in Title 40 based on her statutory duties to Buyer as a real estate\r\n  broker. Â Buyers requested actual damages as well as $1.5 million in punitive\r\n  damages.Â  The case was tried before a jury on August 12 and 13, 2008.Â  \r\nOver Daniels' objection at trial, Buyers introduced a\r\n  consent agreement between the South Carolina Labor, Licensing, and Regulations\r\n  board and Daniels, which sanctioned Daniels for failing to disclose to Buyers\r\n  &quot;reports indicating the presence of structural defects and toxic mold . .\r\n  . [until] . . . approximately one month after purchase.&quot;Â  Daniels\r\n  confirmed she did not provide Buyers with a copy of the mold disclosure report\r\n  but stated she told Buyers about the presence of mold.Â  Further, Daniels testified\r\n  she attempted numerous times after she was sanctioned to contact Buyers in an\r\n  effort to remediate the problem, but Buyers never returned her phone calls.Â  \r\nAt the close of Buyers' case, Sellers made a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict on several grounds, which the trial court denied.Â  Sellers\r\n  renewed their directed verdict motion after the close of evidence, which the\r\n  court denied.Â  The trial court then charged the jury on the law but neglected\r\n  to charge the appropriate burden of proof for punitive damages.Â  Neither party\r\n  objected to the jury charges.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\n  Buyers for $50,000 in actual damages and $75,000 in punitive damages.Â  \r\nSellers timely filed a motion for JNOV, New Trial Absolute,\r\n  or, in the alternative, New Trial Nisi Remittitur.Â  Sellers raised numerous\r\n  grounds for granting a new trial, including the trial court's failure to charge\r\n  the jury that the award of punitive damages requires clear and convincing\r\n  proof.Â  After a hearing on the motion, the trial court granted\r\n  Sellers' motion for a new trial, finding it had the authority to grant a new\r\n  trial absolute pursuant to Rule 59(d), SCRCP, despite Sellers' failure to\r\n  timely object to the jury charge.Â  Buyers' motion to reconsider was denied.Â \r\n  Buyers appealed and Sellers cross-appealed. Â Â \r\nI.&nbsp; Buyers' Appeal\r\nBuyers contend the trial court erred in granting Sellers a\r\n  new trial absolute because Sellers failed to timely object to the trial court's\r\n  flawed jury instruction.Â  In response, Sellers claim their failure to timely object\r\n  to the jury charge did not prevent the trial court from being able to grant a\r\n  new trial pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP.[2]Â \r\n  We agree with Buyers.Â  \r\nThe grant or denial of a new trial motion rests within the\r\n  trial court's discretion, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  unless the court's findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or its\r\n  conclusions are controlled by error of law.Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C.\r\n  389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nA trial court's authority to grant a new trial is rooted in\r\n  Rule 59, SCRCP.Â  Rule 59(a) permits a trial court to grant a new trial &quot;to\r\n  all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues [] in an action in\r\n  which there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new\r\n  trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the\r\n  State . . . .&quot;Â  More specifically, Rule 59(d), SCRCP, states, \r\n\r\n  Not later than 10 days after entry of\r\n    judgment, the court of its own initiative may order a new trial for any reason\r\n    for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party.Â  After giving\r\n    the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter, the court may\r\n    grant a motion for a new trial, timely served, for a reason not stated in the\r\n    motion.Â  In either case, the court shall specify in the order the grounds\r\n    therefor.\r\n\r\nRule 51, SCRCP, which pertains\r\n  to jury instructions, states, &quot;No party may assign as error the giving or\r\n  the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury\r\n  retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he\r\n  objects and the grounds for his objection.&quot;\r\nRule 59 does not expressly\r\n  address whether a trial court's ability to grant a new trial for\r\n  &quot;any reason&quot; is limited to only grounds that were raised at trial.Â \r\n  Moreover, while Rule 51 specifies that a jury instruction must be objected to,\r\n  and case law affirms that a failure to timely object will preclude appellate\r\n  review,[3] neither Rule 51 nor Rule 59 explicitly address whether a flawed jury\r\n  instruction must be objected to for the trial court, either sua sponte or by a\r\n  party's motion, to grant a new trial on that ground.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina jurisprudence indicates that a moving party\r\n  must raise the objectionable issue at the appropriate time during trial; thus,\r\n  unobjected to trial error cannot be advanced as grounds for a new trial.Â  See State v. Dicapua, 383 S.C. 394, 398-99, 680 S.E.2d 292, 294 (2009)\r\n  (finding a trial court cannot sua sponte grant a new trial on a ground not\r\n  raised by a party and reversing the trial court's grant of a new trial based on\r\n  the admission of an unobjected to videotape); S. Railway Co. v. Coltex, Inc.,\r\n  285 S.C. 213, 216, 329 S.E.2d 736, 737-38 (1985) (finding party waived its\r\n  right to claim an omitted jury charge was error by not objecting to its\r\n  omission at the trial level and reversing the trial court's grant of a new\r\n  trial on that ground); Collins Cadillac, Inc. v. Bigelow-Sanford, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 465, 468, 279 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1981) (holding a party's failure to\r\n  raise issue in directed verdict motion precluded assertion of issue in support\r\n  of motion for new trial); Brown v. Singletary, 226 S.C. 482, 484, 85\r\n  S.E.2d 738, 738 (1955) (finding a party's failure to object to prejudicial\r\n  remarks by the trial court during ruling on directed verdict motion prevented\r\n  trial court from granting the party's motion for a new trial based on its\r\n  prejudicial remarks); Munn v. Asseff, 226 S.C. 54, 58, 83 S.E.2d 642, 643-44\r\n  (1954) (holding failure to object or otherwise challenge a jury charge\r\n  precluded issues from being raised in new trial motion to trial court or on\r\n  appeal).Â Â  \r\nIn the civil context, the Supreme Court has addressed a\r\n  trial court's ability to order a new trial based upon inadequate jury\r\n  instructions that were not specifically objected to at the trial level nor\r\n  raised in the party's new trial motion in Southern Railway Company v.\r\n    Coltex, Inc., 285 S.C. 213, 329 S.E.2d 736 (1985).[4]Â \r\n  In that case, Southern Railway brought an action against Coltex to recover\r\n  money due for shipment and storage of Coltex's trailers.Â  Id. at 214,\r\n  329 S.E.2d at 736.Â  The trial court charged the jury that Southern Railway had\r\n  a lien on the trailers in its possession, but this lien was waivable by the\r\n  parties' agreement.Â  Id., 329 S.E.2d at 736-37.Â  Southern Railway\r\n  objected to the trial court's charge that the lien was waivable, but the trial\r\n  court overruled the objection, and the jury found for Coltex.Â  Id., 329\r\n  S.E.2d at 737.Â  Southern Railway then moved for a new trial based on the\r\n  court's erroneous jury charge.Â  Id.Â  The trial court granted Southern\r\n  Railway a new trial, not on the charge Southern Railway objected to, but on the\r\n  court's failure to clarify in its jury charge what Coltex had to do to retain\r\n  the benefit of the waived lien.Â  Id. at 215, 329 S.E.2d at 737.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court held that Southern Railway\r\n  should have requested an additional charge regarding Coltex's duties to claim\r\n  the benefit of the waived lien.Â  Id. at 215-16, 329 S.E.2d at 737.Â  In\r\n  holding the trial court erred in granting Southern Railway a new trial, the\r\n  Supreme Court stated, &quot;Southern waived the right to claim the omitted\r\n  charge was error by not objecting to its omission at the trial level.Â \r\n  Therefore, the omitted charge was not properly before the trial court,\r\n  the Court of Appeals, or this Court.&quot;Â  Id. at 216, 329 S.E.2d at\r\n  737-38 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the trial court failed to instruct the\r\n  jury in regard to punitive damages that the burden of proof was by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.Â  Neither party objected to this omission after the jury\r\n  retired or before the jury returned the verdict.Â  The first time Sellers argued\r\n  the trial court erred in failing to charge the appropriate burden of proof was in\r\n  Sellers' motion for a new trial.Â  At the hearing on Sellers' new trial motion,\r\n  the trial court stated, &quot;[M]y standard jury charge on punitive damages\r\n  specifically addresses that the standard of proof is clear and convincing. . .\r\n  . I don't know how it didn't get in there.&quot;Â  Both parties acknowledged the\r\n  trial court permitted them to review the jury charges before the court read\r\n  them, and while Sellers conceded they did not object, they also stated the\r\n  clear and convincing language was included in the court's standard jury charge\r\n  when they reviewed it.Â Â  \r\nIn granting Sellers' new trial motion outside the ten-day\r\n  window, the trial court cited to Rule 59(d) and stated, &quot;Here, while it is\r\n  true that the Defendants' objection to the jury charges is not preserved\r\n  because of their failure to object prior to the jury retiring, my authority to\r\n  grant a new trial absolute is based on my own ability to do so and does not\r\n  hinge on the Defendants' motion . . . in the instant case, the Defendants\r\n  should not suffer because of my administrative oversight . . . .&quot;Â  \r\nDespite the trial court's good faith effort to correct its\r\n  error by granting Sellers' motion, we are constrained by precedent to conclude\r\n  the trial court erred in granting a new trial absolute.Â  Based on the supreme court's\r\n  holding in Southern Railway, we find Sellers' failure to object to the\r\n  omitted portion of the jury instruction precluded the trial court from granting\r\n  a new trial on that ground.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's grant of\r\n  a new trial absolute. \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sellers' Cross-Appeal\r\nOn cross-appeal, Sellers and Daniels claim the trial court\r\n  committed reversible error when it (1) applied the Act to a non-residential\r\n  transaction; (2) failed to grant Sellers' motion for a directed verdict; and\r\n  (3) allowed Buyers to introduce a consent order issued by another state agency\r\n  from a separate proceeding in violation of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence.\r\n1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Residential\r\n  Property Condition Disclosure Act\r\nSellers first claim the trial court erred in applying the\r\n  Act to the sale of the Property because the abandoned house was not a\r\n  &quot;dwelling unit&quot; within the meaning of the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Act applies to transfers of\r\n  residential real property consisting of at least one but not more than four\r\n  dwelling units.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-50-20 (2007).Â  Under the Act, the owner of\r\n  the real property must furnish a written disclosure statement to a buyer\r\n  disclosing certain characteristics and conditions of the property, including,\r\n  among other things, the presence of toxic material and other environmental\r\n  contamination.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-50-40 (2007).Â  Failure to provide a buyer\r\n  with an accurate disclosure statement may subject the owner and his or her real\r\n  estate agent to civil liability.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-50-65 (2007).\r\nWhile the Act does not define a &quot;dwelling unit,&quot;\r\n  Sellers argue the definition of a dwelling unit from the Residential Landlord\r\n  Tenant Act (&quot;RLTA&quot;), which is located in the same title, should apply\r\n  in this case.Â  Under the RLTA, a dwelling unit is &quot;a structure or the part\r\n  of a structure that is used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by one\r\n  person who maintains a household or by two or more persons who maintain a\r\n  common household and includes landlord-owned mobile homes.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-40-210(3) (2007).Â  We find it is not unreasonable to resort to the\r\n  definition of a dwelling unit from the RLTA because both chapters are located\r\n  in Title 27.Â  See S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368\r\n  S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006) (&quot;In construing statutory\r\n  language, the statute must be read as a whole and sections which are a part of\r\n  the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given\r\n  effect.&quot;). \r\nRegardless, even if we do not utilize the definition of\r\n  dwelling unit as set forth in the RLTA, our conclusion is the same.Â  When\r\n  confronted with an undefined statutory term, this court must interpret it in\r\n  accordance with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Branch v. City of Myrtle\r\n    Beach, 340 S.C. 405, 409-10, 532 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2000).Â  According to\r\n  Black's Law Dictionary, a &quot;dwelling-house&quot; is &quot;the house or\r\n  other structure in which a person lives; a residence or abode.&quot;Â  Black's\r\n  Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009).Â  We find this definition is in accord with the\r\n  term &quot;dwelling unit&quot; as defined in section 27-40-210.\r\nThroughout trial, the parties disputed the intended use of\r\n  the house and consequently if the Act should apply to the sale of the\r\n  Property.Â  Sellers testified it had been rented in prior years as a residence,\r\n  but the house was vacant two years before the Property's sale.Â  Sellers stated\r\n  Buyers intended to tear down the house and erect a steel building in its place;\r\n  whereas, Mr. Winters claimed he wanted to renovate the house.Â  Both parties conceded\r\n  the house was in disrepair and needed substantive repairs before it was\r\n  suitable to be rented.Â  Moreover, multiple contracts were submitted on the\r\n  Property, some on residential forms and others on lot and acreage forms.Â  \r\nThe conflicting nature of the evidence supports the trial\r\n  court's finding that the nature of the property and the intended use for the\r\n  house was a disputed issue to be resolved by the factfinder.Â  If the jury\r\n  determined the house was a dwelling unit, it was then within the jury's\r\n  province to determine whether Sellers breached a duty to Buyers.Â  See Burnett\r\n    v. Family Kingdom, Inc., 387 S.C. 183, 189, 691 S.E.2d 170, 173 (Ct. App.\r\n  2010) (finding the question of negligence is a mixed question of law and fact,\r\n  so that if the law recognizes a particular duty, the jury then determines\r\n  whether a breach of the duty that resulted in damages occurred).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we conclude whether the house was a &quot;dwelling unit&quot; within the\r\n  meaning of the Act was properly submitted to the jury.Â  See Ward v.\r\n    Zelinski, 260 S.C. 229, 234, 195 S.E.2d 385, 388 (1973) (finding when\r\n  evidence is contradictory and more than one reasonable inference is possible,\r\n  it is the trial court's duty to submit the disputed issues of fact to the\r\n  jury).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nSellers next argue the trial court erred in denying their\r\n  motion for a directed verdict on the following grounds: (1) Buyers only alleged\r\n  negligence against Sellers but their relationship with Sellers sounded solely\r\n  in contract; (2) Buyers failed to present any evidence that Burbage had any\r\n  knowledge of mold in the house or that Fiddie knowingly violated any statutory\r\n  provisions; and (3) Buyers failed to offer any evidence to support an award of\r\n  actual damages. Â We disagree.\r\n&quot;In ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence\r\n  and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most\r\n  favorable to the party opposing the motions.&quot; Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148\r\n  (1999).Â  The trial court must deny a directed verdict motion when the evidence\r\n  yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.\r\nA motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and\r\n  may be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to\r\n  liability.Â  Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259\r\n  S.C. 346, 358, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972).Â  When considering directed verdict\r\n  motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to\r\n  decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or\r\n  evidence.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532\r\n  (2002).Â  In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the\r\n  trial court is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence.Â  Pond\r\n    Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).\r\nThis court will reverse only when there is no evidence to\r\n  support the trial court's ruling or when the ruling is controlled by an error\r\n  of law.Â  Clark v. S.C. Dep't of Public Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005).\r\n(1) Sellers' Duty to Buyers\r\nSellers first contend any duty\r\n  they had to Buyers was created solely by contract, and because Buyers only\r\n  alleged negligence against Sellers, the trial court should have granted a\r\n  directed verdict in Sellers' favor.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial created more than one\r\n  reasonable inference on the issue of liability.Â  See Carolina Home\r\n    Builders, 259 S.C. at 358, 191 S.E.2d at 779 (holding a directed verdict\r\n  may be granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to\r\n  liability).Â  Buyers argued Sellers had both a statutory and common law duty to\r\n  disclose material information pertaining to the sale of the Property.Â  Buyers\r\n  presented evidence that the purchase of the Property was a residential\r\n  transaction subject to the statutory requirements set forth in the Act.Â  While\r\n  the dissent contends Buyers failed to sue Sellers under section 27-50-65[5] of the Act, and their failure to do so precludes them from recovering damages\r\n  they would have otherwise been entitled to, we construe Buyers' complaint as\r\n  alleging a cause of action under section 27-50-65.Â  See Whale Beach\r\n    Corp. v. Fed. Land Bank of Columbia, 275 S.C. 218, 219, 268 S.E.2d 583, 584\r\n  (1980) (&quot;In determining whether a cause of action is stated, we are\r\n  required to construe the complaint liberally in favor of the\r\n  pleader.&quot;).Â  Specifically, Buyers alleged Sellers &quot;fail[ed] to\r\n  disclose the existence of toxic mold located within the dwelling [and] fail[ed]\r\n  to provide [Buyers] with written reports within [Sellers and Daniel's]\r\n  possession, which confirmed the existence of toxic mold . . . .&quot; Â Additionally,\r\n  Buyers alleged Sellers &quot;attempt[ed] to falsify documentation to disguise\r\n  their failure to disclose evidence of toxic mold [and] fail[ed] to eliminate\r\n  dangerous condition (sic) upon said property that [Sellers and Daniels] knew or\r\n  should have known existed.&quot;Â  Although Buyers may not have specifically\r\n  cited to the Act, we construe their complaint as sufficiently alleging a cause\r\n  of action under the Act.Â  Moreover, the parties argued over whether the Act\r\n  applied throughout trial, and Sellers' only objection to the directed verdict\r\n  motion was on Buyers' failure to allege a breach of contract action not failure\r\n  to sue under the Act. Â \r\nFurthermore, even if the jury determined Sellers breached no\r\n  duty to Buyers under the Act, there was conflicting evidence as to whether the\r\n  presence of mold was a patent or latent defect as well as whether Buyers\r\n  exercised reasonable diligence in discovering the mold. Â Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court properly denied Sellers' motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\n(2) Knowledge of Mold\r\nNext, Sellers argue the trial court erred in denying their\r\n  directed verdict motion because Buyers presented no evidence that Burbage had\r\n  any knowledge of the presence of mold and that Fiddie knowingly failed to\r\n  disclose the presence of mold.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs to Burbage, there was evidence from which the jury could\r\n  infer Burbage had either actual or constructive knowledge of the presence of\r\n  mold.Â  First, Burbage assigned a power of attorney to Fiddie, who signed the\r\n  contract of sale, which Sellers claim expressly disclosed the presence of mold.Â \r\n  Moreover, Burbage signed a previous contract with a prospective purchaser,\r\n  which included a mold disclosure and waiver form.Â  Given the deferential\r\n  standard of review with regard to motions for directed verdict, we find\r\n  Buyers presented sufficient evidence to create a jury question as to Burbage's\r\n  constructive or actual knowledge regarding the presence of mold in the house.Â  As\r\n  to Fiddie, she testified she was aware of the presence of mold in the house.Â \r\n  Because Fiddie admitted she knew about the mold, the trial court did not err in\r\n  denying Sellers' motion for directed verdict on this ground.\r\n(3) Evidence of Damages\r\nSellers argue the trial court erred in denying their\r\n  directed verdict motion based on Buyers' failure to produce any evidence to\r\n  support an award of actual damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order for damages to be recoverable, the evidence should\r\n  be sufficient to &quot;enable the court or jury to determine the amount thereof\r\n  with reasonable certainty or accuracy.&quot;Â  Whisenant v. James Island\r\n    Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1981).Â  &quot;While neither\r\n  the existence, causation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess\r\n  or speculation, proof with mathematical certainty of the amount of loss or\r\n  damage is not required.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The evidence, however, should be\r\n  such that a court or jury can reasonably determine an appropriate amount. Gray\r\n    v. S. Facilities, Inc., 256 S.C. 558, 570, 183 S.E.2d 438, 444 (1971).Â \r\n  Moreover, bald allegations are insufficient to establish a claim for diminution\r\n  in value, and the evidence must not be speculative as to the amount of the\r\n  alleged diminution.Â  See Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C.\r\n  101, 117, 410 S.E.2d 537, 546 (1991). \r\nAt trial, testimony was presented that the Property was\r\n  initially appraised at $125,000 but was currently valued at $75,000 based on a\r\n  county tax assessment.Â  Mrs. Winters stated the $75,000 valuation did not take\r\n  into account the presence of mold in the house.Â  Mr. Winters stated they were\r\n  continuing to pay a $900 monthly mortgage on the Property, which was partially\r\n  offset by renting the other building on the Property for $600 per month.Â  Mr.\r\n  Winters claimed he would have rented the house for between $750 and $800 per\r\n  month if not for the mold, which rendered the house uninhabitable.Â  \r\nThe jury apparently awarded Buyers $50,000 in actual damages\r\n  based on the difference between the bank's pre-purchase appraisal of the\r\n  Property at $125,000 and the county's subsequent tax assessment of the Property\r\n  at $75,000.Â  The tax assessment is not necessarily conclusive on the Property's\r\n  depreciated value, particularly when Mrs. Winters stated the assessment did not\r\n  account for the presence of mold in the house.Â  However, Mrs. Winters testified\r\n  the Property was worth $75,000 and supported her conclusion based on the tax\r\n  assessment and their loss of projected rental income.Â  As the co-owner of the\r\n  Property, her testimony is sufficient to support the jury's verdict.[6]Â  See Gauld v. O'Shaugnessy Realty Co., 380 S.C. 548, 560, 671\r\n  S.E.2d 79, 86 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;As a general principle, a landowner who is\r\n  familiar with her property and its value, is allowed to give her estimate as to\r\n  the value of the land and damage thereto, even though she is not an expert.&quot;)\r\n  (internal citation omitted).\r\n3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission\r\n  of Consent Agreement\r\nLast, Sellers contend the trial court erred in admitting a\r\n  consent order issued by South Carolina Labor, Licensing, and Regulations board\r\n  (&quot;LLR&quot;) in violation of Rules 403 and 404, SCRE.[7]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the trial court's\r\n  discretion, and its decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Whaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 483, 609 S.E.2d\r\n  286, 300 (2005).\r\nDaniels signed a consent agreement with LLR, which stated,\r\n  &quot;[Daniels] admits that she failed to disclose to purchasers of said\r\n  property reports indicating the presence of structural defects and toxic mold\r\n  at said property.Â  [Daniels] presented toxic mold disclosure statements to\r\n  purchasers approximately one month after purchase.&quot;Â  Daniels also agreed\r\n  in the order to remediate and repair the mold conditions within thirty days of\r\n  signing the agreement.Â  The trial court ruled in limine the order could only be\r\n  admitted for impeachment purposes.Â  During Daniels' testimony, the trial court\r\n  ruled the order was also relevant on the issue of punitive damages. Â The order\r\n  was then admitted into evidence over Sellers' objection.Â Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, relevant evidence may be\r\n  excluded if &quot;its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\n  cumulative evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nWe conclude the order was admissible under Rule 403, SCRE,\r\n  because it was evidence of whether Daniels knowingly failed to disclose the\r\n  mold report to Buyers.Â  Because Buyers alleged they would not have bought the\r\n  property if they had this information, Daniels' disclosure or lack thereof was\r\n  relevant to Buyers' theory of negligence.Â  While a third party may have\r\n  instituted the LLR complaint against Daniels, the provision relating to the\r\n  disclosure of the mold reports clearly pertained to Buyers.Â  Moreover, Mrs.\r\n  Winters' testimony reaffirmed the order's finding that Daniels asked Mrs.\r\n  Winters to sign the mold disclosure waiver form one month after closing on the\r\n  Property.Â  While the LLR order was prejudicial to Daniels in that it\r\n  established Daniels' wrongdoing towards Buyers, we find its probative value\r\n  outweighed its prejudicial impact.Â  \r\nWe also disagree with Sellers' contention that the order was\r\n  inadmissible under Rule 404, SCRE.Â  \r\nUnder Rule 404(b), &quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs,\r\n  or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show\r\n  action in conformity therewith.Â  It may, however, be admissible to show motive,\r\n  identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or\r\n  accident, or intent.&quot;Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  \r\n&quot;The law in civil cases, as well as in criminal cases,\r\n  permits proof of acts other than the one charged which are so related in\r\n  character, time and place of commission as to . . . tend to show the existence\r\n  of [] a common plan or system.&quot;Â  Citizens Bank of Darlington, 202\r\n  S.C. 244, 262-63, 24 S.E.2d 369, 376 (1943) (internal citations omitted).Â Â  In\r\n  the case of the common scheme or plan exception to the general rule barring\r\n  admission of prior bad act evidence, a close degree of similarity between the\r\n  prior bad act and the present case is necessary.Â  Judy v. Judy, 384 S.C.\r\n  634, 642, 682 S.E.2d 836, 840 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  Prior bad act evidence is\r\n  admissible where the evidence is of such a close similarity to the charged\r\n  offense that the previous act enhances the probative value of the evidence so\r\n  as to outweigh the prejudicial effect.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the facts giving rise to LLR's order and those in\r\n  the instant case were extremely similar, so that the order's probative value\r\n  outweighed its prejudicial effect.Â  In both instances, Daniels was accused of\r\n  failing to disclose the mold report to Buyers.Â  Both the order and the case\r\n  against Sellers involved the same property and the same transaction.Â  Although\r\n  the order also sanctioned Daniels for her failure to have contract changes\r\n  initialed with Ms. Oster, who was not a party to this suit, Sellers did not try\r\n  to introduce the order for that purpose at trial.Â  Moreover, Daniels stated\r\n  that particular finding was in error because that provision did not apply to Buyers'\r\n  contract, which Sellers did not contest.Â  Despite that slight factual\r\n  distinction, we do not believe the differences constitute such a meaningful distinction\r\n  that the trial court's admission of the prior LLR order into evidence\r\n  constituted an abuse of discretion. Â See Judy, 384 S.C. at\r\n  643, 682 S.E.2d at 840-41 (finding trial court properly admitted prior judgment\r\n  under Rule 404(b) based on common scheme or plan when the dispute involved same\r\n  property and allegations but differed in that defendant was involved with one\r\n  party in first dispute and another party in second dispute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court's decision to\r\n  grant a new trial absolute is REVERSED.Â  Â Sellers' cross-appeal issues\r\n  are AFFIRMED, and the jury's verdict is REINSTATED in accordance\r\n  with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J.: concurring in part and dissenting in part: Â I concur in the majority opinion except in two respects.Â  First, I would\r\n  reverse the trial court's decision not to direct a verdict in favor of\r\n  Sellers.Â  Second, I would remand the case to the circuit court to conduct a\r\n  post-trial review of punitive damages and to consider other pending post-trial\r\n  motions.\r\nBuyers alleged only one theory of recovery: negligence.Â \r\n  Because Sellers owed no duty of due care to Buyers, Sellers' motion for a\r\n  directed verdict should have been granted.Â  Buyers did not allege an action\r\n  against Sellers under the Residential Property Condition Disclosure Act.[8]Â \r\n  Had they done so, and had they proven the requisite conduct on the part of\r\n  Sellers under section 27-50-65 of the South Carolina Code (2007), they would\r\n  have been entitled to recover damages.Â  They chose, however, to sue in\r\n  negligence, and thus they are foreclosed from recovery.Â  \r\nHistorically, a seller of real estate could not be liable to\r\n  a buyer in negligence.Â  See Rutledge v. Dodenhoff, 254 S.C. 407,\r\n  412, 175 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1970) (&quot;The doctrine of caveat emptor . . . has, in the absence of fraud\r\n  and misrepresentation long governed the obligations of the parties in the sale of real estate in this State.&quot;).Â  Under this rule of\r\n  law, a seller could be liable for making a fraudulent statement about the\r\n  property but could not be liable for negligent failure to disclose a latent\r\n  defect.Â  Our courts have gradually moved away from this doctrine in specific\r\n  situations.Â  See, e.g., Rogers v. Scyphers, 251 S.C. 128, 134,\r\n  161 S.E.2d 81, 84 (1968) (imposing a duty of due care upon builder-vendor of\r\n  new homes); Rutledge, 254 S.C. at 414, 175 S.E.2d at 795 (recognizing a\r\n  right of recovery for breach of warranty for the sale of\r\n  a new house by a builder-vendor); Lane v. Trenholm Bldg. Co., 267 S.C.\r\n  497, 500, 229 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1976) (holding an implied warranty of fitness\r\n  for its intended use arises from the sale of a new\r\n  building).Â  However, no decision of our appellate courts imposes a duty of due\r\n  care upon a seller of residential property who is not in the business of\r\n  building or selling homes. Â While the Residential Property Condition Disclosure\r\n  Act imposes a duty on a seller of residential property to disclose to buyers\r\n  environmental conditions such as the existence of mold, this duty is not in\r\n  negligence.Â  In order to recover damages for the breach of this statutory duty\r\n  of disclosure, a plaintiff must prove more than negligence on the part of the\r\n  seller.Â  Such a plaintiff must prove the seller knew of the mold and knowingly\r\n  failed to disclose it.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-50-65 (2007) (&quot;An\r\n  owner who knowingly violates or fails to perform any duty prescribed by\r\n  any provision of this article or who discloses any material information on the\r\n  disclosure statement that he knows to be false, incomplete, or misleading is liable for actual damages proximately caused to the purchaser and court\r\n  costs.&quot; (emphasis added)); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-50-40(C) (2007) (&quot;The\r\n  rights of the parties to a real estate contract in connection with conditions\r\n  of the property of which the owner has no actual or constructive knowledge are\r\n  not affected by this article.&quot;).Â  \r\nIn my opinion, this case should be remanded to the trial\r\n  court.Â  When the circuit court granted the motion for a new trial based on the\r\n  court's failure to charge the proper standard of proof for punitive damages,\r\n  there were other motions pending, and the circuit court never ruled on them.Â \r\n  Now that this court has reversed the order granting a new trial, those motions\r\n  must be resolved.Â  Exactly which rulings remain to be made should be determined\r\n  by the circuit court, but they certainly include the court's duty to review the\r\n  punitive damages award for compliance with due process.Â  See Mitchell\r\n    v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 583, 686 S.E.2d 176, 183 (2009) (holding\r\n  an appellate court must conduct a de novo review of a trial court's\r\n  determination of the constitutionality of a punitive damages award); James\r\n    v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 194, 638 S.E.2d 667, 670 (2006)\r\n  (requiring courts to determine whether an award of punitive damages is\r\n  consistent with due process).\r\nThe majority argues that Sellers should have cross-appealed\r\n  this issue.Â  I disagree because the trial court made no ruling on which to file\r\n  such an appeal.Â  When the trial court granted Sellers' motion for a new trial,\r\n  Sellers became the prevailing party.Â  The trial court did not rule against\r\n  Sellers on any post-trial motion.Â  The only possible additional action the\r\n  trial court could have taken to benefit Sellers was to rule on some alternative\r\n  ground raised in their post-trial motions.Â  However, Sellers were not obligated\r\n  to request the trial court rule on alternative grounds when the court had\r\n  already ruled in Sellers' favor.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.\r\n    Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (&quot;It would be\r\n  inefficient and pointless to require a respondent to return to the judge and\r\n  ask for a ruling on other arguments to preserve them for appellate review.&quot;).Â \r\n  Therefore, because Sellers were not aggrieved by any of the trial court's\r\n  rulings, they could not cross-appeal.Â  See Rule 201(b), SCACR (&quot;Only\r\n  a party aggrieved by an order, judgment, sentence or decision may\r\n  appeal.&quot;).\r\nFurther, this is not an issue Sellers could have raised as\r\n  an alternative sustaining ground.Â  The trial judge's ruling granted a new trial\r\n  as to all issues, including actual and punitive damages.Â  It is not possible to\r\n  &quot;sustain&quot; that ruling by asking this court to review the punitive\r\n  damages amount for its consistency with due process.Â  See I'On, 338\r\n  S.C. at 417, 526 S.E.2d at 722 (stating an additional sustaining ground is when\r\n  &quot;the party who prevailed in the lower court urges an appellate court to affirm\r\n    the lower court's ruling for a reason other than one primarily relied upon\r\n  by the lower court&quot; (emphasis added)).Â  Even if we were to rule in\r\n  Sellers' favor on the constitutionality of the award, our ruling would simply\r\n  reduce the amount of the punitive damages award, leaving part of the punitive\r\n  damages award and the entire actual damages award intact.Â  Even if we did grant\r\n  a new trial, we would do so only as to punitive damages.Â  Therefore, Sellers\r\n  could not have raised the issue as an alternative sustaining ground.Â  Moreover,\r\n  there is no precedent for an appellate court to rule on the constitutionality\r\n  of a punitive damages award except on review of such a ruling by the trial\r\n  court.Â  While our courts have never expressly disapproved such a procedure,\r\n  current law contemplates that the appellate courts review the trial court's\r\n  ruling.Â  See Mitchell, 385 S.C. at 583, 686 S.E.2d at 183.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-50-10 to -110 (2007).\r\n[2] Sellers raised several other grounds in their motion\r\n  for a new trial, including juror misconduct, improperly admitted evidence, the\r\n  Thirteenth Juror Doctrine, and the failure of the punitive damages award to\r\n  meet the constitutional requirements of Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C.\r\n  104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991).Â  On appeal, Sellers contend Buyers did not appeal\r\n  these additional sustaining grounds, which renders them law of the case.Â \r\n  However, the trial court never specifically ruled on Sellers' alternative\r\n  grounds in its order; thus, law of the case is inapplicable, and Sellers'\r\n  alternate grounds for a new trial are not properly before this court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998)\r\n  (&quot;It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\n[3] See Belue v. City of Greenville, 226\r\n  S.C. 192, 202-03, 84 S.E.2d 631, 636 (1954) (holding that the supreme court\r\n  will not consider on appeal a contention regarding the trial court's jury\r\n  instructions that was not raised at trial); Wilhoit v. WCSC, Inc., 293\r\n  S.C. 34, 41, 358 S.E.2d 397, 401 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing to Rule 51, SCRCP, and\r\n  finding trial court's failure to charge that the standard of proof for punitive\r\n  damages is by clear and convincing evidence was not properly preserved because\r\n  appellant did not object to the trial court's error).\r\n[4] The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the holding\r\n  from Southern Railway in State v. Dicapua, 383 S.C. 394, 398-99,\r\n  680 S.E.2d 292, 294 (2009), asking &quot;[M]ay a trial court in a criminal case\r\n  sua sponte order a new trial on a ground not raised by a party? We answered\r\n  this question 'no' in the context of a civil proceeding in Southern Railway . . . .&quot;\r\n[5] Section 27-50-65 permits recovery of actual damages,\r\n  court costs, and attorney's fees against a seller who knowingly fails to\r\n  disclose &quot;any material information on the disclosure statement that he\r\n  knows to be false, incomplete, or mislead . . . .&quot;\r\n[6] The dissent states other motions were pending before\r\n  the trial court when the court granted Sellers' new trial motion, and because\r\n  this court has now reversed the trial court's grant of a new trial, the trial\r\n  court must review the punitive damages award for compliance with due process.Â \r\n  We first note the trial court never conducted nor did Sellers object at the\r\n  close of trial to the lack of a post-verdict judicial review of the punitive\r\n  damages award as required by Mitchell v. Fortis Insurance Company, 385\r\n  S.C. 570, 588-89, 686 S.E.2d 176, 185-86 (2009).Â  While we find Sellers'\r\n  alternative requests for a new trial nisi remittitur and JNOV based on lack of\r\n  evidence and the excessiveness of the punitive damages award would have\r\n  sufficiently preserved the punitive damages issue for appeal to this court,\r\n  they failed to raise this issue on appeal.Â  In their post-trial motion, Sellers\r\n  explicitly objected to the trial court's failure to grant a directed verdict\r\n  due to the lack of evidence to support an award of actual damages as well as an\r\n  award of punitive damages but only raised this issue in the context of actual\r\n  damages on appeal.Â  We agree with the dissent's conclusion that requiring a\r\n  prevailing party to request a ruling on alternative grounds from the trial court\r\n  when the court has ruled in its favor would be &quot;inefficient and\r\n  pointless.&quot;Â  However, this does not obviate the need for Sellers to raise\r\n  any issue it has with the award of punitive damages (because it was an adverse\r\n  ruling) to this court on cross-appeal.Â  Accordingly, we find it improper for\r\n  either this court or the trial court to review the punitive damages award.Â  \r\n[7]Â  While Sellers also reference Rule 408, SCRE, in\r\n  their brief on appeal, this argument was not made to the trial court and is not\r\n  preserved for our review. See Wilder, 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at\r\n  733 (an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review).\r\n[8] The majority interprets the complaint to allege an\r\n  action under the Act.Â  Our disagreement over the interpretation of the\r\n  complaint is not significant, however, because the only claim presented to the\r\n  jury was a claim for negligence.Â  While the trial judge explained various\r\n  sections of the Act to the jury, he did so only in the context of Buyers' claim\r\n  for negligence.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
