Clare, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General \r\n  John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  and Senior Assistant Deputy Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Johnny Phillip Sweat (Sweat) appeals his convictions \r\n  of first-degree burglary, assault and battery with intent to kill, and three \r\n  counts of assault of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Sweat contends the trial \r\n  judge erred in admitting evidence of a prior bad act of domestic abuse.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRobin Sweat (Robin) \r\n  and Sweat lived together for approximately nine years and had two children together.Â  \r\n  Although they had participated in a marriage ceremony, Robin discovered that \r\n  Sweat was still married to a previous wife, and, therefore, Robin and Sweat \r\n  were not legally married.Â  She reported Sweat for criminal domestic violence \r\n  in October of 2001 (the October incident).Â  While he was in jail for that offense, \r\n  she moved in with her brother, Chris Hasty, and became romantically involved \r\n  with Bobby Blake (Blake).Â  The incident giving rise to the convictions at issue \r\n  on appeal took place on December 11, 2001â€”eleven days after Sweat was released \r\n  from jail for the October incident.Â  \r\nSweat invaded a \r\n  home occupied by Robin; Robinâ€™s brother, Chris Hasty; Robinâ€™s boyfriend, Blake; \r\n  Hastyâ€™s roommate, John Greene; a friend, Deon Dent; and two children: Robinâ€™s \r\n  oldest son, Robert; and Deonâ€™s nephew.Â  Sweat, brandishing a knife, forced his \r\n  way through the front door.Â  Robin and Blake were in a bedroom and the others \r\n  were in the living room.Â  Sweat began yelling and continued waving the knife.Â  \r\n  Robin and Blake emerged from the bedroom to investigate the commotion.Â  Sweat \r\n  became more upset when he saw Robin and Blake.Â  Robin, Blake, Hasty, and Greene \r\n  retreated to a back bedroom, and Blake held the door shut as Sweat attempted \r\n  to enter.Â  Sweat eventually opened the door enough to insert his armâ€”with knife \r\n  in handâ€”into the room.Â  He continued to swipe with the knife and severely cut \r\n  Blake on the hand.Â  \r\nUnable to breach \r\n  the bedroom from the inside, Sweat exited the house and attempted to enter the \r\n  bedroom through an outside window.Â  He broke the window, but was unable to fully \r\n  enter the room because the headboard of a waterbed was blocking the window.Â  \r\n  He returned inside the house, again trying to breach the back bedroom.Â  Unsuccessful, \r\n  Sweat finally left.Â  He was apprehended the next day.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State \r\n  introduced Robinâ€™s testimonyâ€”first in camera, and then in the \r\n  presence of the juryâ€”of the incident of domestic violence that took place in \r\n  October of 2001.Â  Robin, Sweat, and Sweatâ€™s brother and sister-in-law were together \r\n  when Sweat directed Robin to take off her shirt and show his brother her breasts.Â  \r\n  When Robin refused, Sweat began yelling and calling her a â€œfat bitch.â€Â  He attempted \r\n  to physically pull off her shirt, and in the ensuing struggle, Robinâ€™s arm was \r\n  bruised.Â  \r\nA few days later, \r\n  Robin reported the October incident to the authorities.Â  She explained at trial \r\n  that she desired to end the relationship and saw the incident as her opportunity \r\n  to escape.Â  Sweat was arrested for criminal domestic violence.Â  He spent forty-five \r\n  days in jail, but was released after Robin signed a statement that the October \r\n  event did not actually happen.Â  At trial, Robin averred that she copied the \r\n  statement at the request of her sister-in-law and acquiesced in signing it because \r\n  â€œI was out of the situation.Â  And thatâ€™s all I was worried about, was getting \r\n  out.â€ \r\nAdditionally, Robin \r\n  gave a general account of the authoritarian and imperious personality of Sweat, \r\n  which consisted of: (1) dictating when and what she could eat; (2) hanging up \r\n  or breaking the telephone if she stayed on too long; (3) compelling her to drink \r\n  alcoholic beverages; and (4) forcing her to have sex.Â  \r\nDefense counsel \r\n  moved to exclude evidence of prior episodes of domestic violence on the grounds \r\n  that it was impermissible character evidence.Â  The State argued that the prior \r\n  evidence was admissible to show motive and intent.Â  Sweat objected that: (1) \r\n  the evidence was irrelevant; (2) it could not be shown by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence; and (3) its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative \r\n  value.Â  After an in camera review, the trial judge ruled evidence \r\n  of the October incident was admissible to show motive and intent and to provide \r\n  a full picture of the events leading up to the night of the attack.Â  However, \r\n  the trial judge disallowed other instances of domestic violence because she \r\n  found them irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\r\nOn appeal, Sweat \r\n  argues admission of the October incident was error.Â  We disagree and affirm.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE/Lyle\r\n\r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes evidence of a defendantâ€™s \r\n  prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime \r\n  charged.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); State \r\n  v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Mathis, \r\n  359 S.C. 450, 597 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Weaverling, 337 \r\n  S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. \r\n  406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), our supreme court articulated the exceptions to this \r\n  general rule excluding bad character evidence.Â  Evidence of prior bad acts is \r\n  admissible when it tends to establish (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) absence of \r\n  mistake; (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more \r\n  crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other; \r\n  and (5) the identity of the person charged with commission of the present crime.Â  \r\n  Lyle at 416, 118 S.E. at 807; State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 \r\n  S.E.2d 364 (1990); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2004); see also Anderson v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 581 \r\n  S.E.2d 834 (2003) (explaining that Rule 404(b), SCRE, the modern expression \r\n  of the Lyle rule, excludes evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts \r\n  offered to prove character of person in order to show action in conformity therewith; \r\n  the rule creates an exception when testimony is offered to show motive, identity, \r\n  existence of common scheme or plan, absence of mistake or accident, or intent).Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œIn State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001), the \r\n  Supreme Court articulated the appropriate standard of review on appeal in determining \r\n  the admissibility of bad act evidence:Â  â€˜In criminal cases, the appellate court \r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. CutterÂ¸ 261 S.C. 140, 199 \r\n  S.E.2d 61 (1973).â€™â€Â  State v. Humphries, 346 S.C. 435, 448, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  286, 293 (Ct. App. 2001) (Anderson, concurring) revâ€™d on other grounds, \r\n  354 S.C. 87, 579 S.E.2d 613 (2003);Â  see also State v. Tutton, \r\n  354 S.C. 319, 327, 580 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 2003) (determining whether \r\n  trial judge properly admitted evidence under common scheme or plan exception \r\n  to Lyle is a â€œquestion of law.â€).\r\n\r\n A.Â  Motive and Intent\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Robinâ€™s in camera testimony, the \r\n  trial judge ruled the October incident was admissible under both the motive \r\n  and intent exceptions of Rule 404(b) and Lyle.Â  In reaching her decision \r\n  to admit evidence of the October incident, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\nBut I do perceive that it is logically relevant and that . . . the State is \r\n  entitled to give a full snapshot of what happened. I do not think you can isolate outâ€”this is the incident that started the continuum \r\n  and does show his intent in going there that evening and his motive in going \r\n  there that evening. Which is . . . according to the Stateâ€™s theory . . . . that she was his property \r\n  and that he was going there to get his property. . . .\r\n\r\nWe agree that both \r\n  motive and intent can be inferred from the prior bad act.Â  Following the October \r\n  assault, Robin reported Sweatâ€™s conduct and Sweat spend forty-five days in jail.Â  \r\n  He was released eleven days before the December incident occurred.Â  Robin became \r\n  involved with Blake and refused to resume her relationship with Sweat.Â  Within \r\n  days, Sweat perpetrated the December 11 attack.Â  Thus, the October incident \r\n  and Sweatâ€™s time in jail relate to his actions on December 11, 2001.Â  \r\nThe State had to prove malice as an element of assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  See State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 138 (2003) (â€œABIK is an unlawful act of violent nature to the person \r\n  of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied.â€).Â  â€œGenerally, \r\n  motive is not an element of a crime that the prosecution must prove to establish \r\n  the crime charged, but frequently motive is circumstantial evidence . . . of \r\n  the intent to commit the crime when intent or state of mind is in issue.â€Â  Danny \r\n  R. Collins, South Carolina Evidence 319 (2d ed. 2000).Â  â€œState of mind \r\n  is an issue any time malice or willfulness is an element of the crime.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the October incident was properly admitted.Â  \r\nIn State \r\n  v. Thomas, 248 S.C. 573, 151 S.E.2d 855 (1966) overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (abrogating \r\n  the doctrine of in favorem vitae), the defendant was convicted of rape.Â  Our \r\n  supreme court found evidence the defendant had previously stolen the victimâ€™s \r\n  watch was properly admissible under the motive exception to Lyle.Â  The \r\n  victim had testified against the defendant for stealing the watch.Â  The defendant \r\n  allegedly said to the victim on the night of the rape, â€œâ€˜Itâ€™s me and I have \r\n  come to kill you.Â  I have planned it every single day since you put me on the \r\n  chaingang for stealing your watch.â€™â€Â  Thomas, 248 S.C. at 576, 151 S.E.2d \r\n  at 857.Â  In affirming the admission of the prior bad act, the court concluded:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe think that all of the evidence here, which only incidentally tended to prove \r\n  the commission of other crimes, by appellant is governed by exceptions to the \r\n  general rule, and that such was, therefore, admissible. . . .Â  The evidence \r\n  with respect to the prior crime, the theft of [the victimâ€™s] watch, was restricted \r\n  to the minimum requirements of the case and tended directly and fairly to prove \r\n  not only the identity of the appellant, but his motive as well.\r\n\r\nId. at 583, 151 S.E.2d 861.\r\n State v. Plyler, 275 S.C. 291, 270 S.E.2d 126 (1980) dealt, \r\n  in part, with the motive exception to Lyle in the context of murder.Â  \r\n  The defendant claimed the trial court erred by allowing evidence of prior ill \r\n  will between he and the defendant.Â  The supreme court disagreed:Â  \r\n\r\nThe prosecution elicited testimony concerning a verbal altercation between the \r\n  victim and the appellant three days prior to the killing. In a non-responsive \r\n  answer, the witness additionally indicated that there had been prior bad blood \r\n  between the two.Â  Upon objection and motion from defense counsel for a mistrial, \r\n  the trial judge ordered the remark concerning bad blood stricken from the record \r\n  and instructed the jury to disregard the comment.Â  The motion for a mistrial \r\n  was denied.Â  The appellant now asserts these rulings were trial error and entitled \r\n  him to relief.Â  We do not agree.Â  \r\n  \r\nEvidence of previous difficulties or ill feelings between the accused and \r\n  the victim and of facts showing the cause of such difficulties or ill will is \r\n  admissible on the question of motives where there is some connection of cause \r\n  and effect between the evidence and the crime.Â  40 C.J.S., Homicide, Section \r\n  228.Â  \r\n  \r\nThe challenged evidence tends to show motive on the part of the accused and \r\n  is not so remote in time as to negate its probative value.\r\n\r\nId. at 296, 270 S.E.2d at 128 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThomas and \r\n  Plyler lend further support to the trial judgeâ€™s decision in this case.Â  \r\n  From the October incident, the jury could have inferred both (1) motiveâ€”that \r\n  Sweat was driven by anger over Robin causing him to go to jail and terminating \r\n  their relationship, and that he intended to â€œget his propertyâ€; and (2) intentâ€”that \r\n  Sweat maliciously sought to inflict harm upon Robin and Blake.Â  Therefore, we \r\n  find the trial judge did not commit error by allowing the October incident under \r\n  the motive and intent exceptions of Lyle and Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\nB.Â  Relevance\r\n\r\nSweat contends that even if the October incident fits under the motive \r\n  and intent exceptions, it should have been excluded because it was irrelevant.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nFor evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant.Â  Rules 401 &amp; \r\n  402, SCRE; State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 340, 526 S.E.2d 248, 251 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000); see also State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 \r\n  S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating bad act must logically relate to the crime \r\n  with which the defendant has been charged).Â  Evidence which assists the jury \r\n  in arriving at the truth of an issue is relevant and admissible unless otherwise \r\n  incompetent.Â  State v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 303, 342 S.E.2d 401, 403 \r\n  (1986).Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence \r\n  of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable \r\n  or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Evidence \r\n  is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter \r\n  in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears, and it is not required \r\n  that the inference sought should necessarily follow from the fact proved.Â  State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 354, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nEvidence is admissible if â€œlogically relevantâ€ to establish a material fact \r\n  or element of the crime; it need not be â€œnecessaryâ€ to the Stateâ€™s case in order \r\n  to be admitted.Â  State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990).Â  \r\n  â€œThe record must support a logical relevance between the prior bad act and the \r\n  crime for which the defendant is accused.â€Â  State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, \r\n  512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1999).Â  If the court does not clearly perceive the \r\n  connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the crime charged, \r\n  that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be given the benefit of the \r\n  doubt, and the evidence should be rejected.Â  State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. \r\n  57, 533 S.E.2d 325 (2000).Â  \r\nDetermination of relevancy is largely within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  \r\n  State v. Jeffcoat, 279 S.C. 167, 170, 303 S.E.2d 855, 857 (1983); Hamilton \r\n  at 353, 543 S.E.2d at 591.Â  The trial judge must have wide discretion on innumerable \r\n  questions of relevancy before her, and her decision should be reversed only \r\n  for abuse of that discretion.Â  State v. Anderson, 253 S.C. 168, 182, \r\n  169 S.E.2d 706, 712 (1969). \r\nThe October incident \r\n  was relevant as it suggested motive and intent and tended to make the Stateâ€™s \r\n  version of the case more probable.Â  While not strictly necessary to the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case, it was logically related to why Sweat went to the house that night and \r\n  to his intentions once there.Â  We find the trial judge did not abuse her discretion \r\n  by concluding the October incident was relevant to the event that took place \r\n  on December 11, 2001.Â  \r\n\r\nC.Â  Standard of Proof for Prior Bad Acts\r\n\r\nIf not the subject of a conviction, a prior bad act must first be \r\n  established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. \r\n  129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Smith, 300 S.C. 216, 387 S.E.2d \r\n  245 (1989); State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 597 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  In State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001), the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court elucidated:Â  \r\n\r\n[W]e do not review a trial judge's ruling on the admissibility of other bad \r\n  acts by determining de novo whether the evidence rises to the \r\n  level of clear and convincing. If there is any evidence to support the \r\n  admission of the bad act evidence, the trial judge's ruling will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal.\r\n\r\nId. at 6, 545 S.E.2d 829 (emphasis added); accord Pagan, \r\n  357 S.C. at 143, 591 S.E.2d at 652; State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 155, \r\n  561 S.E.2d 640, 646 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThe record contains ample evidence to satisfy the â€œany evidenceâ€ \r\n  standard articulated in Wilson.Â  The trial judge conducted an extensive \r\n  in camera review and was satisfied the standard was met.Â  Robin \r\n  testified the incident occurred.Â  Sweat was arrested for criminal domestic violence \r\n  and served jail time because of the incident.Â  Additionally, Blake declared \r\n  at trial that he saw the bruises on Robinâ€™s arm.Â  Thus, evidence exists to support \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the October incident took place.Â  See \r\n  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 629 (2000) (finding prior bad \r\n  act established by clear and convincing evidence where witness testified defendant \r\n  robbed her); cf. State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 485 S.E.2d 913 \r\n  (1997) (finding trial judge erred in admitting testimony that child abuse victim \r\n  had previously been treated for injuries where State failed to offer any \r\n  proof the injuries were inflicted by defendant).Â  We find no error. \r\n\r\nD.Â  Probative Value/Unfair Prejudice\r\n\r\nEven though the relevant evidence is clear and convincing and falls \r\n  within a Lyle exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is \r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); \r\n  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Unfair \r\n  prejudice means â€œan undue tendency to suggest [a] decision on an improper basis, \r\n  commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.â€Â  State v. Alexander, \r\n  303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991); see also State \r\n  v. Bright, 323 S.C. 221, 226, 473 S.E.2d 851, 854 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œUnfair \r\n  prejudice from the introduction of evidence occurs when it has an undue tendency \r\n  to induce a decision on an improper basis.â€).Â  â€œThe determination of prejudice \r\n  must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the \r\n  facts of each case.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, \r\n  830 (2001).Â  \r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value \r\n  and prejudicial effect of relevant evidence should be reversed only in exceptional \r\n  circumstances.Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (2003); \r\n  see also State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488 (2004) \r\n  (noting the supreme court reviews rulings balancing whether the probative value \r\n  of evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect pursuant \r\n  to the abuse of discretion standard and gives great deference to the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  decision).Â  â€œIf judicial self-restraint is ever desirable, it is when a Rule \r\n  403 analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 358, 543 S.E.2d 586, 598 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nAs to the October incident, the trial judge ruled:Â  â€œ. . . I do not \r\n  find that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair \r\n  prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  We agree.Â  Testimony of the October incident was \r\n  highly probative.Â  It tended to show motive and intent, and it completed the \r\n  Stateâ€™s theory of the case.Â  Sweat testified that: (1) Robin called him multiple \r\n  times a day; (2) he had filed a complaint against her; (3) she invited him to \r\n  the house on December 11, 2001 to sign papers giving him temporary custody of \r\n  their children; (4) Greene tried to slam the door in his face; (5) Blake initiated \r\n  an attack on him and swung a stick at him; (6) Greene threatened him with a \r\n  knife, which he took away and swung to fend off Greene and Blake; and (7) he \r\n  never went inside the house.Â  Consequently, the facts surrounding the December \r\n  11, 2001 occurrence were vigorously contested.Â  Evidence of the October event \r\n  was therefore probative in that it gave the jury the necessary background to \r\n  explain why Sweat may have gone to the house that night and what his intentions \r\n  may have been.Â  While the prior act of domestic violence had some prejudicial \r\n  effect on Sweat, we do not believe it was so prejudicial to â€œsuggest a decision \r\n  on an improper basis, such as an emotional one.â€Â  See State v. Cheesboro, \r\n  346 S.C. 526, 547, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001). \r\nSweat, citing State v. DuBose, 288 S.C. 226, 341 S.E.2d 785 (1986), \r\n  argues even if the evidence was otherwise admissible, it lost its probative \r\n  value by becoming too far removed from the event in question.Â  In Dubose, \r\n  the defendant was convicted of manufacturing and trafficking marijuana.Â  He \r\n  was arrested in 1984 after a pilot for SLED observed patches of marijuana growing \r\n  on the defendantâ€™s fatherâ€™s farm.Â  The State was allowed to admit aerial photographs \r\n  taken of the DuBose farmland during 1981-1983.Â  The supreme court, finding admission \r\n  of these photographs was error, held:Â  â€œHere there is a total failure of proof \r\n  that DuBose grew marijuana in the fields shown in the aerial photographs from \r\n  1981 to 1983.â€Â  Id. at 230, 341 S.E.2d at 787.Â  \r\nWe disagree with Sweat that the October incident was too remote in time from \r\n  the December crime to have probative value.Â  To the contrary, the incident occurred \r\n  two months before the December attack, and Sweat was released from jail for \r\n  the October incident a mere eleven days before the December attack.Â  DuBose, \r\n  by contrast, dealt with evidence dating back several years.Â  Furthermore, unlike \r\n  DuBose, the short passage of time in this case does not call into question \r\n  the efficacy of the evidence admitted.Â  Whereas the DuBose court found \r\n  â€œa total failure of proofâ€ that DuBose was responsible for the marijuana in \r\n  the photographs, the trial judge in this case found clear and convincing evidence \r\n  that the October incident took place.Â Â  \r\nSweat cites State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999) to support \r\n  his contention the October incident was too remote to have probative value.Â  \r\n  In King, the defendant was found guilty of murdering his father-in-law \r\n  who reportedly kept up to $1,800 in his wallet.Â  His wallet was not found at \r\n  the crime scene.Â  The State introduced evidence that the defendant: (1) often \r\n  needed money; (2) regularly pawned household items; (3) stole cash from his \r\n  wifeâ€™s purse; (4) forged checks on her bank account; and (5) used her ATM card \r\n  without permission.Â  Id. at 511, 514 S.E.2d at 582.Â  The supreme court \r\n  reversed his conviction based on the admission of this evidence of prior bad \r\n  acts:\r\n\r\nThe remote thefts were not admissible under any theory.Â  This evidence shows \r\n  appellantâ€™s bad character and his propensity to commit crimes.Â  These are inadmissible \r\n  purposes.Â  The temporal connection between these petty thefts and the charged \r\n  crimes is too attenuated for admissibility under the res gestae \r\n  theory or under Lyle.Â  Thus the trial judge erred in admitting evidence \r\n  of the remote thefts.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 513, 514 S.E.2d at 583.Â  We find King distinguishable \r\n  from the case at bar.Â  First, the prior bad act in this case is more probative \r\n  than the thefts in King; it bears a closer temporal and logical connection \r\n  to the crime charged.Â  In King, the State was allowed to admit evidence \r\n  of a series of unrelated thefts that began over a year before the murder.Â  In \r\n  this case, the trial judge disallowed evidence of a string of instances of prior \r\n  domestic violence.Â  She allowed only the October incident precisely because \r\n  it was so close in time and so factually related to the attack.Â  See \r\n  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682 (2000) (â€œThe temporal \r\n  attenuation between the making of this statement is of no consequence in assessing \r\n  its admissibility.Â  The four month lapse is at most a matter bearing on the \r\n  weight of the evidence, which was for the jury to determine.â€).\r\nFurther, the only logical connection between the prior thefts and the murder \r\n  in King was the inference that defendant often needed money, often stole \r\n  to get it, and therefore might have murdered his father-in-law to obtain money.Â  \r\n  In other words, its introduction primarily tended to show his propensity to \r\n  do wrong.Â  Here, the October incident suggests why Sweat perpetrated \r\n  the crimes on December 11â€”there is a cause and effect relationship between the \r\n  two events.Â  Thus, while in King the murder did not occur because \r\n  of the prior thefts, the evidence here tends to show the December attack \r\n  did occur because of the October incident and its consequences to Sweat.Â  \r\n  Concomitantly, Sweatâ€™s intervening jail time is a critical temporal nexus between \r\n  the October and December incidents.Â  Therefore, the October incident is appreciably \r\n  more probative than the prior thefts in King.Â  \r\nSecond, the October incident is less damaging than the thefts in King.Â  \r\n  The King court stressed that â€œ[h]ere, all the evidence was circumstantial. \r\n  . . . the evidence was not overwhelming.Â  The admission of the remote thefts \r\n  was too prejudicial to be held harmless.â€Â  Id. at 514, 514 S.E.2d at \r\n  583.Â  By contrast, overwhelming evidence placed Sweat at the house on the night \r\n  of December 11, 2001.Â  And by Sweatâ€™s own admission, he inflicted the knife \r\n  injury upon Blake.Â  \r\nThird, our courts have not established a bright-line rule for determining when \r\n  evidence loses its probative value due to passage of time.Â  Indubitably, we \r\n  have established no such rule due to the fact-intensive nature inherent in a \r\n  Rule 403 analysis.Â  The determination of prejudice depends upon the unique circumstances \r\n  of each case.Â  See Wilson, 345 S.C. at 80, 545 S.E.2d at 7.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge is given broad discretion in making the Rule 403 determination.Â  \r\n  See Myers, 359 S.C. at 48, 596 S.E.2d at 492.Â  Under the facts \r\n  of this case, we agree that the short passage of time did not diminish the probative \r\n  value of the October incident.Â  Thus, we find the trial judge did not abuse \r\n  her broad discretion in concluding the probative value of this evidence outweighed \r\n  its prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\nII.Â  Res Gestae\r\n\r\nÂ â€œUnder the res gestae theory, evidence of other bad acts may \r\n  be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged or may \r\n  be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the crime \r\n  occurred.â€Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004) \r\n  (citing State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001); State \r\n  v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999)); see also State \r\n  v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding evidence \r\n  of prior burglary was â€œnecessary and relevant for a full presentation of the \r\n  case.â€); State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 2002) \r\n  (finding evidence of burglary occurring the same night as the burglary for which \r\n  defendant was convicted â€œwas necessary for a full presentation of the case without \r\n  fragmentation.â€).Â  Under this theory, it is important that the temporal proximity \r\n  of the prior bad act be closely related to the charged crime.Â  Owens, \r\n  346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745.Â  \r\nOur supreme court, in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996), \r\n  explained the theory of res gestae:Â  \r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes \r\n  arises when such evidence &quot;furnishes part of the context of the crime&quot; \r\n  or is necessary to a &quot;full presentation&quot; of the case, or is so intimately \r\n  connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and \r\n  is so much a part of the setting of the case and its &quot;environment&quot; \r\n  that its proof is appropriate in order &quot;to complete the story of the crime \r\n  on trial by proving its immediate context or the 'res gestae'&quot; or the &quot;uncharged \r\n  offense is 'so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime \r\n  charged that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .' [and \r\n  is thus] part of the res gestae of the crime charged.&quot; And where evidence \r\n  is admissible to provide this &quot;full presentation&quot; of the offense, \r\n  &quot;[t]here is no reason to fragmentize the event under inquiry&quot; by suppressing \r\n  parts of the &quot;res gestae.&quot; \r\n\r\nId. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting United States v. Masters, \r\n  622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980) (alterations in original)).\r\nWe find the October incident was properly admitted to â€œcomplete the story of \r\n  the crime on trial.â€Â  The prior act of domestic abuse gave Robin the opportunity \r\n  to escape her relationship with Sweat.Â  As a result, she moved out, and he spent \r\n  time in jail.Â  Sweat was upset, and eleven days after his release, these crimes \r\n  occurred.Â  The October abuse, and the events that followed, provided the fact \r\n  finder with an appropriate context in which to place the December 11 attack.Â  \r\n  See State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1999) \r\n  (â€œThe res gestae theory recognizes that evidence of other bad \r\n  acts may be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged, \r\n  or may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which \r\n  the crime occurred.â€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold evidence of the October incident was properly admitted to \r\n  show motive and intent.Â  The evidence tended to make Sweatâ€™s motive and intent \r\n  more probable, and, therefore, was relevant.Â  The record adequately supports \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s finding the incident was proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the incident was highly probative and not so prejudicial to Sweat \r\n  to suggest a verdict based on an improper basis.Â  Finally, the incident was \r\n  correctly admitted, pursuant to res gestae, to complete the story \r\n  of the crime on trial.Â  Accordingly, the convictions and sentences of Sweat \r\n  are \r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n STILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3899","title":"Truluck v.

Nesmith died on April 26, 1999.Â  On April 28, 1999, the probate \r\n  court granted an application from Carol S. Snyder for informal probate of a \r\n  will that was executed by Nesmith on April 1, 1999.Â  In this will, Nesmith devised \r\n  all his property to Snyder and Elizabeth Ashford.Â  He also named Snyder as the \r\n  personal representative of his estate.Â  \r\nOn June 9, 1999, James P. Truluck, Jr., commenced a proceeding in the probate \r\n  court to contest the will on the ground of undue influence and lack of testamentary \r\n  capacity.Â  On June 15, 1999, an amended summons was filed naming Truluck, Ethel \r\n  N. King, Bobbie Jean Truluck, Hazel Ann Simril Childers, Mark Davis Simril, \r\n  Bryan Scott Simril, and Michael Andrew Simril as petitioners and Snyder and \r\n  Ashford as respondents.Â  \r\nAlthough she participated in some discovery requests, Ashford did not file \r\n  any responsive pleadings in the will contest.Â  Ashford died testate on July \r\n  29, 2000.Â  Her will named J.S. Bourne as the personal representative of her \r\n  estate as well as her primary beneficiary.Â  \r\nOn November 8, 2000, Bourne, individually and as personal representative of \r\n  Elizabeth Ashfordâ€™s estate, was substituted as a respondent in the contest concerning \r\n  Nesmithâ€™s will. [1] Â  Bourne answered \r\n  the petition on December 5, 2000.Â  \r\nOn April 12, 2001, Bourne was dismissed by oral order of the probate court \r\n  as a respondent pursuant to Rule 41, SCRCP, and granted leave to intervene as \r\n  a petitioner.Â  Although Bourne had submitted a petition under Rule 24(c), SCRCP, \r\n  alleging numerous causes of action, the probate court permitted him to intervene \r\n  as a petitioner only on his causes of action for lack of testamentary capacity, \r\n  undue influence, and termination of appointment. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nOn April 20, 2001, Bourne filed a summons and petition alleging the three causes \r\n  of action permitted by the probate court in its oral order.Â  Unlike either the \r\n  petition Bourne had proffered when he moved to intervene as a petitioner or \r\n  the petition approved by the probate court, the petition that Bourne filed on \r\n  behalf of himself and Ashfordâ€™s estate included a demand for a jury trial.Â  \r\n  In her answer, dated May 29, 2001, Snyder objected to the jury trial demand \r\n  and timely moved to strike the pertinent language in the petition. \r\nOn June 18, 2001, the probate court held a hearing on Snyderâ€™s motion to strike.Â  \r\n  On June 22, 2001, after the hearing on Snyderâ€™s motion to strike and while the \r\n  matter was still under advisement, Snyder amended her answer to raise for the \r\n  first time two affirmative defenses, i.e., (1) the statute of limitations under \r\n  South Carolina Code section 62-3-108, \r\n  [3]  and (2) lack of standing as to Bourne.Â  On June 27, 2001, Bourne moved \r\n  under South Carolina Code section 62-1-302 \r\n  [4]  for removal of the proceedings to the circuit court.Â  \r\nThe probate court filed a written order on July 12, 2001, granting Snyderâ€™s \r\n  motion.Â  In the order, the probate court found that all parties had waived the \r\n  right to a jury trial and that no additional issues of fact or law were created \r\n  by Bourneâ€™s petition.Â  \r\nOn July 19, 2001, Snyder moved for summary judgment on the ground of the statute \r\n  of limitations.Â  \r\nOn November 1, 2001, the probate court issued orders denying (1) Bourneâ€™s motion \r\n  for reconsideration on the issue of his right to a jury trial, (2) Bourneâ€™s \r\n  motion to remove the case to the circuit court, and (3) Snyderâ€™s summary judgment \r\n  motion. Â On October 2, 2002, the circuit court affirmed the probate courtâ€™s \r\n  decisions regarding Bourneâ€™s rights to a jury trial and removal of the case.Â  \r\n  Bourneâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied May 12, 2003.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We address first Snyderâ€™s contention that the order issued by the probate \r\n  court denying removal to the circuit court was not appealable.Â  Snyder contends \r\n  the order was not a â€œfinal order, sentence, or decree of a probate courtâ€ under \r\n  South Carolina Code section 62-1-308(a) [5]  and therefore could not be appealed to the circuit court.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  Inasmuch as the probate courtâ€™s denial of Bourneâ€™s motion to have \r\n  the case considered by a jury in the circuit court impacted the mode of trial, \r\n  it constituted a final order for the purpose of filing an appeal. [6] \r\n2.Â  The probate court \r\n  found that all parties, including Bourne, had waived the right to have the case \r\n  removed to the circuit court.Â  Bourne argues this was error.Â  We agree.\r\nThe South Carolina Probate Code provides that â€œactions in which a party has \r\n  a right to trial by jury and which involve an amount in controversy of at least \r\n  five thousand dollars in value,â€ â€œmust be removed to the circuit courtâ€ \r\n  for a trial de novo â€œon motion of a party, or by the court on its own motion, \r\n  made not later than ten days following the date on which all responsive pleadings \r\n  must be filed.â€ [7] \r\nWe agree with Bourne that his request for removal was timely.Â  Section 62-1-302 \r\n  requires only that a motion for removal be made â€œnot later than ten days following \r\n  the date on which all responsive pleadings must be filed.â€ \r\n  [8] Â  In the present case, on June 22, 2001, the court had accepted without \r\n  incident Snyderâ€™s amended answer to Bourneâ€™s petition.Â  Because Bourneâ€™s motion \r\n  for removal was dated June 27, 2001, it fell within the time limit imposed by \r\n  the South Carolina Probate Code. [9] \r\n3.Â  We further agree with Bourne that the probate court erred in holding \r\n  (1) because the pleading that he filed included a jury trial demand, it violated \r\n  both Rule 24(c), SCRCP, and the oral order granting him leave to intervene; \r\n  and (2) Bourne was not entitled to a jury trial because he had waived this right.\r\nPleadings are governed by Part III of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure, which includes Rules 7 through 16.Â  None of these rules include any \r\n  requirements concerning jury trials or otherwise suggest that a jury trial demand \r\n  is part of a pleading.Â  The procedure for demanding a jury trial appears in \r\n  Rule 38, SCRCP, which is included in Part VI, entitled â€œTrials.â€Â  Under Rule \r\n  38, the only circumstance constituting a waiver of this right is a partyâ€™s failure \r\n  â€œto serve a demand as required by this rule and to file it as required by Rule \r\n  5(d).â€ [10] Â  \r\nRule 38(b) allows such a demand to be â€œendorsed upon a pleading of the party.â€ \r\n  [11] Â  The rule also allows a jury trial demand to be included in a separate \r\n  document served up to ten days after the last pleading pertinent to the issue \r\n  on which a jury trial is warranted. \r\n  [12] Â  \r\nWe agree with Bourne that an â€œendorsement,â€ such as that allowed by Rule \r\n  38, is not a part of the pleading itself; therefore, including a jury trial \r\n  demand in his petition did not violate Rule 24(c) or exceed what the probate \r\n  court allowed when it granted him leave to intervene.Â  Had Bourne demanded a \r\n  jury trial in a separate document, he would not have â€œalteredâ€ the pleading \r\n  authorized by the probate court.Â  There is no logical distinction between this \r\n  method and the use of an endorsement on the face of the pleading to communicate \r\n  a demand for a jury trial.Â  \r\nThe probate court further concluded that all parties had waived their rights \r\n  to a jury trial in this matter.Â  Specifically, as to Bourne, the probate court \r\n  noted that Ashford never filed any responsive pleadings or demanded a trial \r\n  by jury at any time before she died and that the responsive pleading initially \r\n  filed by Bourne on behalf of himself and Ashfordâ€™s estate failed to include \r\n  such a demand.Â  We disagree with this reasoning.\r\nThe Probate Code further provides that â€œ[t]he right to trial by jury exists \r\n  in, but is not limited to, formal proceedings in favor of the probate of a will \r\n  or contesting the probate of a will.â€ \r\n  [13] Â  Rule 38 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure likewise recognizes \r\n  the fundamental importance of the right to a jury trial in a civil action. [14] Â  Paragraph (b) of the rule further instructs \r\n  any party demanding a jury trial on a particular issue to make this demand known \r\n  â€œby serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time \r\n  after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service \r\n  of the last pleading directed to such issueâ€ and provides that a jury trial \r\n  demand â€œmay be endorsed upon a pleading of the party.â€ \r\n  [15]   \r\nIn this case, Bourne was dismissed from the litigation pursuant to Rule \r\n  41(a)(1) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  This rule expressly \r\n  provides that â€œ[u]nless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, \r\n  the dismissal is without prejudice . . . .â€ [16] Â  Interpretations of the federal counterpart \r\n  to this rule, which is essentially the same as the South Carolina version, \r\n  [17]  have suggested that a dismissal under circumstances such as those \r\n  presented here has the effect of nullifying the prior pleadings of the party \r\n  requesting the dismissal. [18] Â  Based on this reasoning, we hold that Bourneâ€™s earlier participation \r\n  as a defendant in this litigation did not compromise his right to demand a jury \r\n  trial when he intervened as a petitioner in the case.Â  Because the jury trial \r\n  demand was contemporaneous with Bourneâ€™s petition to challenge the probate of \r\n  Nesmithâ€™s will on the grounds of undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity, \r\n  it was timely under Rule 38.

Elliott, \r\n  and Special Assistant Attorney General Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Druanne D. White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this criminal case, John Richard Wood argues the trial \r\n  court erred by admitting evidence Wood shot and killed a state trooper shortly \r\n  before committing the crimes involved in this appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWood was indicted for criminal conspiracy, failure to stop when signaled by \r\n  a law enforcement vehicle, resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, \r\n  two counts of possession of a firearm or knife during commission of or attempt \r\n  to commit a violent crime, four counts of assault with intent to kill, and three \r\n  counts of assault and battery with intent to kill.\r\nImmediately prior to the beginning of trial and outside the presence of the \r\n  jury, the State moved for permission to introduce evidence at trial that Wood \r\n  fatally shot a state trooper.Â  The shooting occurred one to two hours before \r\n  Wood committed the acts for which he was charged in the instant case.Â  The evidence \r\n  consisted of the testimony of Terry and Debra Wheeler and a 911 telephone call.Â  \r\n  The Wheelers witnessed a traffic stop, heard shots, and then saw a red moped \r\n  weaving in and out of traffic.Â  They followed the moped and saw Wood abandon \r\n  the moped and get into a Jeep.Â  The Wheelers followed the Jeep long enough to \r\n  view the license plate number and made a 911 call with information about Wood \r\n  and the Jeep.Â  Based in part on the Wheelersâ€™ information, police officers attempted \r\n  to apprehend Wood.Â  Wood failed to stop when signaled by a law enforcement vehicle.Â  \r\n  A high-speed chase ensued during which Wood shot at police officers.\r\nWood objected to the admission of the evidence on the ground it was irrelevant \r\n  under Rule 401, SCRE, and, even if relevant, unduly prejudicial under Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.Â  The State argued the evidence was admissible as part of the res gestae \r\n  and to show motive, existence of common scheme or plan, identity, absence of \r\n  mistake or accident, and intent under Rule 404(b), SCRE and State v. Lyle, \r\n  125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\nThe trial judge found: â€œItâ€™s my judgment that the evidence from Greenville \r\n  which the State seeks to admit is probably admissible as part of the res gestae \r\n  and also under 404(b) as to the issue of intent.â€Â  The judge further ruled:\r\n\r\nHowever, based on the arguments that have been presented, Iâ€™m going to approach \r\n  this matter cautiously and limit the Stateâ€™s use of the so-called Greenville \r\n  evidence, at least initially.Â  The State certainly should not be foreclosed \r\n  from explaining to the jury some limited basis of what precipitated the stop \r\n  or attempted stop in Anderson County.\r\nAt this time I will permit the Stateâ€™s witnesses to testify to observing, perhaps \r\n  hearing an incident in Greenville involving an individual on a motorcycle \r\n  or moped, however it is described, and that as a result an individual in the \r\n  vehicle was followed, eventually to the rear of the Greenville Gymnastics Center, \r\n  where the individual was picked up by a female in a jeep.Â  Testimony would then \r\n  permit the actual following of the jeep and reporting the tag number of the \r\n  jeep to 911.\r\nAnderson law enforcement would then be permitted to explain the fact that officers \r\n  were alerted to the fact and looking for a jeep with a specific tag number which \r\n  was registered to an individual, who can be identified, to an Anderson address \r\n  as a result of an incident in Greenville.\r\nAt least initially, I want to proceed on the basis that there will not be a \r\n  reference to the shooting death of a state trooper in Greenville.Â  And I fully \r\n  recognize in restricting the State in this regard, that events may develop during \r\n  the course of the trial.Â  For example, if the issue of identity becomes a bonafide \r\n  issue, there may be issues of defenses which are raised.Â  There may be requests \r\n  for lesser-included offenses.Â  And the list goes on.Â  Any of which may well \r\n  require a broadening of the admissibility of the Greenville evidence.\r\nBut at least initially, Iâ€™m going to restrict the State to the parameters I \r\n  have outlined.Â  If thereâ€™s any need for clarification of that, Iâ€™ll be glad \r\n  to respond.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nIn response to the judgeâ€™s ruling, the Solicitor stated: â€œYour Honor, so in \r\n  other words, we will not be playing the 911 tape where they say, we heard shots.Â  \r\n  Weâ€™re just going to say an incident.Â  Is that right?Â  Iâ€™ve got, I think, \r\n  all my witnesses in here.Â  I just want to clarify it for everybody before we \r\n  begin the testimony.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The judge declared: â€œYes, thatâ€™s correct.â€Â  \r\n  Reference to the murder of the state trooper was prohibited.Â  The shooting was \r\n  referred to as an â€œincidentâ€ throughout the trial.\r\nThe jury found Wood guilty of criminal conspiracy, failure to stop when signaled \r\n  by a law enforcement vehicle, resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, \r\n  two counts of possession of a firearm or knife during commission of or attempt \r\n  to commit a violent crime, five counts of assault with intent to kill, one count \r\n  of assault and battery with intent to kill, and one count of assault and battery \r\n  of a high and aggravated nature.Â  He received a sentence of 138 years imprisonment.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the \r\n  appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Wilson, 345 \r\n  S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d \r\n  852 (Ct. App. 2003). This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, \r\n  527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary \r\n  factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal \r\n  cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. \r\n  Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 600 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The appellate court \r\n  does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported \r\n  by any evidence.Â  Mattison, 352 S.C. at 583, 575 S.E.2d at 855.\r\nIf there is any evidence \r\n  to support the admission of bad act evidence, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal.Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d \r\n  62 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWood argues the trial court â€œerred by refusing to exclude evidence \r\n  about a Greenville â€˜incidentâ€™ since it was not necessary to the juryâ€™s consideration \r\n  of the Anderson County charges.Â  Even if the Greenville incident was relevant, \r\n  its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect under \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE, and it should have been excluded on that basis.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Issue Preservation\r\nInitially, we address whether this issue is preserved for review.Â  \r\n  Wood made a motion in limine to suppress evidence relating to \r\n  the murder of the state trooper, but failed to make an objection when the evidence \r\n  was actually presented.\r\nIn most cases, making a motion in limine to exclude evidence \r\n  at the beginning of trial does not preserve an issue for review because a motion \r\n  in limine is not a final determination.Â  State v. Forrester, \r\n  343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001); State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, the moving party must make a contemporaneous \r\n  objection when the evidence is introduced.Â  Id.; see also State \r\n  v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 193 n.3, 498 S.E.2d 642, 644 n.3 (1998) (â€œWe \r\n  have consistently held a ruling in limine is not final, and unless \r\n  an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling \r\n  procured, the issue is not preserved for review.â€) (citation omitted); State \r\n  v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 521, 369 S.E.2d 842, 843 (1988) (â€œWe caution Bench \r\n  and Bar that these pre-trial motions are granted to prevent prejudicial matter \r\n  from being revealed to the jury, but do not constitute final rulings on the \r\n  admissibility of evidence.â€).\r\nâ€œHowever, where a judge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the \r\n  record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, the \r\n  aggrieved party does not need to renew the objection.â€Â  Forrester, \r\n  343 S.C. at 642, 541 S.E.2d at 840.Â  This court expounded:\r\n\r\nBecause no evidence was presented between the ruling and [the] testimony, there \r\n  was no basis for the trial court to change its ruling.Â  Thus, . . . [the] motion \r\n  was not a motion in limine.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling in this \r\n  instance was in no way preliminary, but to the contrary, was a final ruling.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, [the defendant] was not required to renew her objection to the \r\n  admission of the testimony in order to preserve the issue for appeal.\r\n\r\nState v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (footnote omitted); see also State v. Burton, \r\n  326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997) (noting the general rule that a \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling on in limine motion is not a final decision, but \r\n  applying State v. Mueller and holding that where objection is made during \r\n  trial and there are no intervening witnesses before the disputed testimony, \r\n  the decision is final and the objection need not be renewed).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the case sub judice, the State presented the Wheelersâ€™ \r\n  testimony at the beginning of trial, immediately after the judge ruled on the \r\n  issue.Â  Therefore, the motion was not a motion in limine but a \r\n  final ruling.Â  Consequently, the issue may be reviewed on appeal because Wood \r\n  was not required to make an objection when the evidence was admitted.Â  See \r\n  King, 349 S.C. at 149, 561 S.E.2d at 643.\r\nII.Â  Res Gestae\r\nEvidence of \r\n  bad acts or other crimes may be admitted under the res gestae theory:\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence \r\n  of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of \r\n  the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately \r\n  connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and \r\n  is so much a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its \r\n  proof is appropriate in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by \r\n  proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense \r\n  is â€˜so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged \r\n  that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] \r\n  part of the res gestae of the crime charged.â€Â  And where evidence is admissible \r\n  to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, â€œ[t]here is no reason to \r\n  fragmentize the event under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, \r\n  370-71 (1996) (quoting United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1980)).Â  The res gestae theory recognizes that evidence of other bad acts \r\n  may be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged or \r\n  may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the \r\n  crime occurred.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001); \r\n  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004); State \r\n  v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Under this theory, \r\n  it is important that the temporal proximity of the prior bad act be closely \r\n  related to the charged crime.Â  State v. Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  77 (1997).Â  Even if the evidence is relevant under this theory, prior to admission \r\n  the trial judge should determine whether its probative value clearly outweighs \r\n  any unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Bolden, 303 S.C. 41, \r\n  398 S.E.2d 494 (1990).\r\nThe evidence was properly admitted under the res gestae theory.Â  See \r\n  Adams, 322 S.C. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71.Â  Admission of the testimony \r\n  was necessary and relevant to a full presentation of the evidence in this case.Â  \r\n  The â€œincidentâ€ provided the context and motivation for the crimes at issue.Â  \r\n  The testimony regarding the â€œincidentâ€ was relevant to show the complete, whole, \r\n  unfragmented story regarding Woodâ€™s crimes.Â  See State v. Simmons, \r\n  352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The Wheelersâ€™ testimony elucidates \r\n  both the reason police pursued the Jeep and the reason Wood shot at, harmed, \r\n  and threatened the officers who attempted to apprehend him.Â  Furthermore, the \r\n  crimes were temporally related.Â  The shooting took place only two hours before \r\n  the occurrence at issue.Â  The two crimes comprise part of the same episode.Â  \r\n  The crimes are so concatenated as to be inextricably intertwined.Â  See \r\n  Adams, 322 S.C. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 371 (â€œThe use of the cocaine here \r\n  was inextricably intertwined with the robbery and murder. Under these circumstances, \r\n  such evidence was properly admitted as part of the res gestae \r\n  of the crime.â€).Â  Indubitably, the murder of a state trooper was part of the \r\n  res gestae of the second crimes because it explains why Wood evaded capture \r\n  at all costs.Â  Moreover, the probative value of the evidence outweighed its \r\n  prejudicial effect.Â  See Owens, 346 S.C. at 653, 552 S.E.2d at \r\n  753.\r\nBecause we dispose of this issue under a res gestae analysis, we \r\n  do NOT reach the Lyle/Rule 404(b) argument.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge engaged in a cathartic evidentiary ruling by NOT referring \r\n  to a â€œmurder of a highway patrolman,â€ but in a pristine and salutary etymological \r\n  endeavor, utilizing the term â€œincident.â€Â  The testimony describing the â€œincidentâ€ \r\n  is admissible under the res gestae theory.Â  Accordingly, the convictions and \r\n  sentences of Wood are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3901","title":"Brown v.

Brown (Father).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFather and Mother were married on December 16, 1991 and have three children, \r\n  Melissa Rene, born December 17, 1991, and twins, Nicholas George and Natalie \r\n  Rae, born June 10, 1995.Â  The parties separated on October 30, 2000, and Mother \r\n  initiated divorce proceedings on the ground of adultery.Â  Father did not contest \r\n  the divorce.Â  The parties reached an agreement settling all property and financial \r\n  matters.Â  The only contested issues before the family court were custody of \r\n  the minor children, attorneyâ€™s fees, and detective fees.Â  On appeal, the only \r\n  contested issue is custody of the minor children.Â  The family court awarded \r\n  custody of the three minor children to Father, who, by the time of trial, had \r\n  moved in with his parents.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n â€œIn appeals from the family court, the court of appeals has jurisdiction to \r\n  find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  \r\n  Emery v. Smith, Op. No. 3870 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Sep. 27, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 38 at 56) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, \r\n  414 S.E.2d 157 (1992)); Upchurch v. Upchurch, 359 S.C. 254, 257-58, 597 \r\n  S.E.2d 819, 821 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Although this Court may find facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not required \r\n  to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight \r\n  to their testimony.Â  See Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  154 (1996); Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In \r\n  particular, an appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation \r\n  of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.â€Â  Woodall \r\n  at 10, 471 S.E.2d at 157.Â Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant \r\n  of her burden to convince this Court the family court committed error.Â  Skinner \r\n  v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.\r\n    \r\n    Did the family court err in awarding custody of the minor children to \r\n      Father?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the family court err by failing to adequately consider the preferences \r\n      of the minor children?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the family court award de facto custody to the paternal grandparents?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Custody of the Minor Children\r\nMother first argues the family court erred in awarding custody of the minor \r\n  children to Father.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe paramount and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interests \r\n  of the children.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, \r\n  430 (Ct. App. 2000); Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 189, 531 S.E.2d \r\n  297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Custody decisions are left largely to the discretion \r\n  of the trial court.Â  Shirley at 330, 536 S.E.2d at 430.Â  \r\nIn Shirley, we articulated the South Carolina rule governing custody \r\n  cases:\r\n\r\n  In all child custody controversies, the controlling considerations are the \r\n    childâ€™s welfare and best interests.Â  In reaching a determination as to custody, \r\n    the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all \r\n    areas of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, \r\n    familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  Additionally, the court must \r\n    assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness, and attitude as they impact the child.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n342 S.C. at 330, 536 S.E.2d at 430 (citations omitted); see \r\n  also Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 296, 596 S.E.2d 505, \r\n  512 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWhen determining to whom custody shall be awarded, the \r\n  court should consider all the circumstances of the particular case and all relevant \r\n  factors must be taken into consideration.â€);Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. \r\n  16, 22, 553 S.E.2d 251, 254Â  (Ct. App. 2001) (providing the totality of circumstances \r\n  peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision \r\n  of child custody can be weighed). \r\n â€œThe relative fitness of parents is an important issue in custody \r\n  litigation. . . . Fitness decisions normally turn on either of two considerations; \r\n  whether either parent has been the primary caretaker, or whether either parent \r\n  has engaged in conduct which would affect the welfare of the child.â€Â  Roy T. \r\n  Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 433 (3rd ed. 2001).Â  â€œAlthough \r\n  there is no rule of law requiring custody be awarded to the primary caretaker, \r\n  there is an assumption that custody will be awarded to the primary caretaker.â€Â  \r\n  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 527, 599 S.E.2d 114, 120 (2004) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\n\r\n  In South Carolina, in custody matters, the father and mother are in parity \r\n    as to entitlement to the custody of a child.Â  When analyzing the right to \r\n    custody as between a father and mother, equanimity is mandated.Â  We place \r\n    our approbation upon the rule that in South Carolina, there is no preference \r\n    given to the father or mother in regard to the custody of the child.Â  The \r\n    parents stand in perfect equipoise as the custody analysis begins.\r\n\r\nKisling v. Allison, 343 S.C. 674, 678, 541 S.E.2d 273, \r\n  275 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Additionally, child custody is not granted to a party \r\n  as reward or withheld as punishment.Â  Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. \r\n  524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975); Clear v. Clear, 331 S.C. 186, 191, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 790, 792 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nMorality of a parent is a proper factor for consideration in determining \r\n  custody of children.Â  Davenport at 527, 220 S.E.2d at 230.Â  However, \r\n  the effect of a parentâ€™s morality is limited in its force to what relevancy \r\n  it has, either directly or indirectly, to the welfare of the child.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nRecognizing this was a â€œclose custody case,â€ the family court noted \r\n  that â€œboth parties love the children and the children clearly love both parents, \r\n  and have a close relationship with both.â€Â  The court order states that â€œboth \r\n  parties were the primary caretakers of the children[.]â€Â  The court did not find \r\n  Mother unfit, but concluded custody with Father was in the childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the family court found the children have had excessive \r\n  tardies at school and held Mother to be the significant factor causing the childrenâ€™s \r\n  tardies.Â  This finding is supported by the testimony of Marlene Cordoso, a school \r\n  employee, who testified that most of the childrenâ€™s tardiness occurred when \r\n  Mother brought the children to school.Â  She further averred Mother was late \r\n  on occasion when it was her responsibility to pick up the children from the \r\n  after-school care program.Â  Moreover, Ms. Cordoso stated Mother failed to pick \r\n  up a sick child from school after agreeing to do so.Â  \r\nOther personnel at the school testified Mother sometimes would \r\n  bring the children to school without their lunches.Â  This did not occur when \r\n  Father brought their lunches.Â  The school employees further averred the children \r\n  were better groomed and properly clothed in winter months when in the care of \r\n  Father as opposed to Mother. \r\nNancy Hogsed, a babysitter for the children, corroborated the \r\n  testimony of Ms. Cordoso.Â  According to Ms. Hogsed, Mother frequently was late \r\n  and would fail to pick up the children at the requisite time.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Mother was often late to or absent from the childrenâ€™s birthday parties, award \r\n  functions, and sporting events.Â  Mother lost her job at the hospital for excessive \r\n  tardiness and absenteeism.Â Â  \r\nFurthermore, several witnesses offered testimony of Motherâ€™s \r\n  poor temperament.Â  The witnesses stated Mother loses her temper with her daughter \r\n  Melissa and cursed at the child.Â  Mitzi Kirsch, a realtor who listed the marital \r\n  residence, testified to a â€œscreaming rampageâ€ and verbal abuse inflicted on \r\n  her by Mother while Ms. Kirsch was attempting to sell the marital residence.Â  \r\n  The relationship became so difficult that Ms. Kirsch withdrew the listing of \r\n  the home.Â  \r\nAlthough Father admittedly engaged in an adulterous relationship, \r\n  he professed the amoret had ended and he was currently attending church.Â  The \r\n  amalgamation of witness testimony reveals Father: (1) was active in raising \r\n  the children; (2) often cooked meals; (3) helped with school work; (4) took \r\n  the children to church; and (5) attended the childrenâ€™s recreational events.Â  \r\n  Consequently, ample evidence exists to support the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion, \r\n  â€œHusband has the preferable temperament for dealing with the children.â€\r\nTo support her position, Mother proffers the improvement the \r\n  children made in school while they were in her care.Â  She contends that since \r\n  the partiesâ€™ separation, the children have been late less and have improved \r\n  their grades, and, therefore, the family court erred by awarding custody to \r\n  Father.Â  However, we find the family court properly weighed the factors and \r\n  exercised discretion in awarding custody with Father.Â  The family court balanced \r\n  the adulterous indiscretions of Father against the shortcomings of Mother in \r\n  deciding to award custody to Father.Â  There is substantial evidence in the record \r\n  to support the award of custody to Father, including: (1) Motherâ€™s inability \r\n  consistently to have the children to school on time; (2) her inattentiveness \r\n  to the childrenâ€™s lives; and (3) her poor temperament around the children.Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court considered how the custody decision would impact \r\n  the childrenâ€™s lives and assessed each partiesâ€™ attributes.Â  It determined the \r\n  well-being of the children was best served by an award of custody to Father.Â  \r\n  We find the family court properly analyzed this custody situation pursuant to \r\n  the statutes and case law of this state and did not abuse its discretion in \r\n  awarding custody to Father. \r\nII.Â  Childrenâ€™s Preferences\r\nMother contends the family court erred in failing to consider the \r\n  preferences of the minor children.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n â€œIn determining the best interests of the child, the court must \r\n  consider the childâ€™s reasonable preference for custody.Â  The court shall place \r\n  weight upon the preference based upon the childâ€™s age, experience, maturity, \r\n  judgment, and ability to express a preference.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1515 \r\n  (Supp. 2003); see also Moorhead v. Scott, 259 S.C. 580, \r\n  585, 193 S.E.2d 510, 513 (1972) (holding the wishes of a child of any age may \r\n  be considered under all the circumstances, but the weight given to those wishes \r\n  must be dominated by what is best for the welfare of the children).Â  The significance \r\n  to be attached to the wishes of children in a custody dispute depends upon the \r\n  age of the children and the attendant circumstances.Â  See Smith v. \r\n  Smith, 261 S.C. 81, 85, 198 S.E.2d 271, 274 (1973).Â  The childâ€™s preference \r\n  will be given little weight where the wishes of the child are influenced by \r\n  the permissive attitude of the preferred parent.Â  Id. at 86, 198 S.E.2d \r\n  at 274.Â  \r\nThe trial judge is not required to take testimony from the children \r\n  where (1) counsel fails to request that the judge take the testimony and (2) \r\n  the childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem testifies as to the childrenâ€™s preferences.Â  \r\n  See Perry v. Perry, 315 S.C. 373, 375, 433 S.E.2d 911, 912 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993); see also Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 505 \r\n  S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding the courtâ€™s decision not to interview an \r\n  eleven-year-old child was not an abuse of discretion).Â  \r\nThe twins were approximately six years old at the time of trial, \r\n  and Melissa was approximately ten.Â  Although the guardian ad litem recommended \r\n  custody be awarded to Father, he asseverated: â€œ[A]ll three children stated they \r\n  had a preference to live with their mother.â€Â  The guardian explained:\r\n\r\n  The reasoning for Nicholas and Natalie is justâ€”I donâ€™t think they are really \r\n    mature enough to really tell me why they wanted to live with her.Â  Melissa, \r\n    I think, is more connected, based on my conversations with her, is more connected.Â  \r\n    She wants to stay in the neighborhood with the children she has grown up with \r\n    all these years.Â  But, of course, thatâ€™s not going to happen.Â  \r\n\r\nGuinan v. Guinan, 254 S.C. 554, 176 S.E.2d 173 (1970), the \r\n  leading South Carolina case on childrenâ€™s preferences, dealt with the custody \r\n  dispute over a sixteen-year-old boy.Â  Our supreme court reversed the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of custody to the mother, holding: \r\n\r\n  Ordinarily, the wishes of a child of this boyâ€™s age, intelligence and experience, \r\n    although probably not controlling, Ex parte Reynolds, 73 S.C. 296, \r\n    53 S.E. 490 (1906), are entitled to great weight in awarding his custody as \r\n    between estranged parents.Â  Annot., 4 A.L.R.3d 1396, 1434 (1965).Â  The court \r\n    made no finding of fact tending to offset this important factor in awarding \r\n    custody, and the record before us is bare of any evidence tending to do so.Â  \r\n    Absent any evidence tending to establish that the best interest of the boy \r\n    would be served by awarding his custody to the mother, the court erred in \r\n    failing to allow him to live with the parent of his choice.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 557-58, 176 S.E.2d at 174.Â  \r\nMoorhead v. Scott, 259 S.C. 580, 193 S.E.2d 510 (1972), involved \r\n  a change of custody action by a father attempting to obtain custody of his children, \r\n  ages eight, eleven, and twelve.Â  Id. at 582, 193 S.E.2d at 512.Â  The \r\n  family court awarded a change of custody to the father based on its finding \r\n  of a substantial change of conditions and the childrenâ€™s preference to live \r\n  with their father.Â  Id. at 584, 193 S.E.2d at 512.Â  In reversing, the \r\n  supreme court noted the difference in weight to be given a childâ€™s preference \r\n  based upon their age and elucidated that the childrenâ€™s best interestsâ€”not the \r\n  childrenâ€™s preferenceâ€”is the cardinal determination in custody decisions:\r\n\r\n  Our Court has given little significance to the wishes of a six year old child.Â  \r\n    Poliakolff v. Poliakoff, 221 S.C. 391, 70 S.E.2d 625 (1952).Â  On the \r\n    other hand, our Court has given great weight to the wishes of a child sixteen \r\n    years of age.Â  Guinan v. Guinan, 254 S.C. 554, 176 S.E.2d 173 (1970).Â  \r\n    It is clear that the wishes of a child of any age may be considered under \r\n    all the circumstances, but the weight given to those wishes must be dominated \r\n    by what is best for the welfare of the children.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 585, 193 S.E.2d at 513.\r\nIn summation, South Carolina law requires the family court to consider \r\n  a childâ€™s reasonable preference for custody.Â  However, the weight given to the \r\n  childâ€™s preference depends upon the childâ€™s age, experience, maturity, judgment, \r\n  and ability to express a preference.Â  And a determination of the best interests \r\n  of the child is paramount to the childâ€™s preference.Â  \r\nAlthough the six-year-old twins expressed a preference for Mother, \r\n  we find Poliakolff and Morehead counsel that minimal weight should \r\n  be given the preference of such young children.Â  Ten-year-old Melissaâ€™s wishes \r\n  should be given more weight because she is older.Â  However, even the weight \r\n  given the preference of a ten-year-old does not rise to the level of â€œgreat \r\n  weightâ€ that should be given the desires of a sixteen-year-old.Â  See \r\n  Bolding v. Bolding, 278 S.C. 129, 293 S.E.2d 699 (1982) (reversing change \r\n  of custody of eleven-year-old because â€œFather failed in his burden of establishing \r\n  a change of condition sufficient to warrant a transfer of custody, as the only \r\n  change alleged or proved involved the wishes of the eleven-year-old child.â€); \r\n  see also Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina \r\n  454 (3rd ed. 2001) (â€œJudging from the handful of South Carolina cases on childrenâ€™s \r\n  preferences, it appears that somewhere between 12 and 14 may well be the ages \r\n  at which the wishes of the child should be given serious consideration.â€); Patel \r\n  v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 599 S.E.2d 114 (2004) (upholding award of custody \r\n  of thirteen-year-old daughter to the mother where daughter expressed â€œdefinite \r\n  desireâ€ to live with mother).\r\nMoreover, the preference of any child is merely a factor in \r\n  the analysisâ€”it is not determinative.Â  The family court, cognizant of the childrenâ€™s \r\n  wishes, considered the factors in this custody decision and reasonably concluded \r\n  it was in their best interests to be with Father.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.Â  De Facto Custody\r\nMother argues the custody award to Father was actually a de \r\n  facto custody award to the childrenâ€™s paternal grandparents.Â  She claims the \r\n  grant of custody was error because (1) the grandparents were not parties to \r\n  the action, and (2) even if the grandparents had been parties to the action, \r\n  Mother would have to have been adjudged unfit under Moore v. Moore, 300 \r\n  S.C. 75, 386 S.E.2d 456 (1989) in order for custody to go to the grandparents.Â  \r\n  We find this argument without merit.Â  \r\nÂ The family court considered the work schedules of both parties \r\n  in its analysis and found:\r\n\r\n  Although husbandâ€™s third shift job and his living with his parents would, \r\n    normally be a negative factor against his receiving custody, the Court believes \r\n    that this negative factor is not significant.Â  The children have a close relationship \r\n    with their paternal grandparents.Â  The paternal grandparents have often times \r\n    assisted the parents in caring for the children . . . .Â  This living arrangement \r\n    will actually assist the husband in caring for the children since the grandparents \r\n    will be home with the children while he is working third shift.\r\n\r\nThis Court expressly rejects the principle entitled â€œde factoâ€ \r\n  custody.Â  Factually, â€œde factoâ€ custody, even if recognized, is not presented \r\n  or proven in this case.Â  Apodictically, custody was awarded to Father, not the \r\n  grandparents.Â  The family court merely factored the paternal grandparents into \r\n  the custody analysis.Â  Mother cites no law supporting her theory of de facto \r\n  custody, and we refuse to erect a rule that would punish a parent solely because \r\n  he or she chooses to live with his or her parents.Â  \r\nFurther, we find Moore inapposite as that case addressed \r\n  the rebuttable presumption that â€œit is in the best interest of any child to \r\n  be in the custody of its biological parent.â€Â  300 S.C. at 79, 386 S.E.2d at \r\n  458 (citing Kay v. Rowland, 285 S.C. 516, 331 S.E.2d 781 (1985); Cook \r\n  v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 345 S.E.2d 612 (1978)).Â  The case at bar deals with \r\n  a custody dispute between the two parents, not between a parent and a third \r\n  party.Â  Concomitantly, the court did not need to find Mother unfit to award \r\n  custody to Father.Â  We find granting custody to the Father, partially because \r\n  of the assistance available from the paternal grandparents, was not tantamount \r\n  to de facto custody and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the family court awarding custody to \r\n  Father is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\nÂ Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3902","title":"Cole v.

Raut and her medical practice.Â  The Coles argue the circuit court erred in \r\n  charging the jury on the defense of assumption of risk.Â  We affirm pursuant \r\n  to the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Coles brought this action individually and on behalf of their son, Kyle, \r\n  who was born on February 22, 1997.Â  The Coles alleged medical negligence against \r\n  Dr. Raut and her medical practice.Â  The complaint essentially asserted that \r\n  Dr. Raut failed to deliver Kyle in a timely manner by Cesarean section (C-section) \r\n  birth, and failed to timely respond to warning signs that Kyle was suffering \r\n  from the effects of oxygen distress prior to birth.Â  Dr. Raut and her practice \r\n  denied negligence, and asserted various defenses, including contributory negligence.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Raut and her practice sought to amend their pleadings at trial to include \r\n  assumption of risk as a separate, affirmative defense.Â  Initially, the court \r\n  ruled that the â€œcomparative fault affirmative defense covered assumption of \r\n  the risk.â€Â  When Dr. Raut and her practice renewed their motion, the court elected \r\n  to reserve its ruling on the motion until the close of evidence.Â  After all \r\n  evidence was presented, the court struck the comparative negligence defense \r\n  raised by Dr. Raut and her practice.Â  However, over the Colesâ€™ objection, the \r\n  court elected to charge the jury on the affirmative defense of assumption of \r\n  risk. [1] \r\nAt trial, both parties provided expert testimony regarding the various issues \r\n  stemming from the care rendered by Dr. Raut in the delivery process, including \r\n  Dr. Rautâ€™s timing in ordering a C-section. [2] Â  Predictably, the Coles presented expert testimony \r\n  that Dr. Raut deviated from the standard of care which resulted in injury, and \r\n  Dr. Raut presented expert testimony that she did not deviate from the applicable \r\n  standard of care while providing prenatal care to Mrs. Cole or in the delivery \r\n  of her child.Â  A jury issue was therefore presented on the malpractice - negligence \r\n  claim.\r\nThe court instructed the jury that the Coles were entitled to prevail if the \r\n  jury found Dr. Raut was negligent â€œin at least one or more of the ways alleged \r\n  â€¦ [and that] the defendantsâ€™ negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  injuries.â€Â  When later charging the jury on the assumption of risk affirmative \r\n  defense, the court stated:\r\n\r\n  I charge you, if you find that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily exposed \r\n    herself to a known danger and understood and appreciated the danger, then \r\n    in such circumstance your verdict would be for the defendant.Â  However, I \r\n    charge you, on the other hand, if you find that the plaintiffâ€™s injuries and \r\n    negligence were the result of the defendantâ€™s negligence, then in such circumstance \r\n    your verdict would be for the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a general defense verdict.Â  Judgment was \r\n  entered for Dr. Raut and her medical practice.Â  The Coles appeal.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Coles argue the circuit court erred in instructing the jury on the assumption \r\n  of risk defense, contending the defense is inapplicable to the facts of the \r\n  case.Â  We do not reach this issue, however, because the jury returned a general \r\n  verdict for the defense, and that verdict is independently supported by the \r\n  unchallenged submission of the negligence claim to the jury. \r\n  [3] Â  This principle is generally referred to as the â€œtwo issueâ€ rule.Â  \r\n  The rule is based on the principle that reversal is inappropriate where no error \r\n  is found as to one of the issues that may independently support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  \r\n  See Anderson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., \r\n  317 S.C. 280, 282, 454 S.E.2d 353, 355 (Ct.App. 1995) (â€œIf a verdict is susceptible \r\n  of two constructions, one of which will uphold it and the other which will defeat \r\n  it, the one which will uphold it is preferredâ€).Â  Moreover, a general verdict \r\n  is presumptively valid.Â  See Gold Kist, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; Southern \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 286 S.C. 272, 282, 333 S.E.2d 67, 73 (Ct.App. \r\n  1985) (â€œThe appellate courts of this State exercise every reasonable presumption \r\n  in favor of the validity of a general verdictâ€).\r\nÂ Because the present case involved both an issue \r\n  of negligenceâ€”properly submitted to the juryâ€”and the challenged defense of assumption \r\n  of risk, we are bound to affirm the defense verdict if the verdict may be sustained \r\n  on the negligence claim.Â  See Id. (â€œ[W]here a jury returns a general \r\n  verdict in a case involving two or more issues or defenses and its verdict is \r\n  supported as to at least one issue or defense, the verdict will not be reversedâ€).Â  \r\n  The Coles concede the negligence claim involved disputed issues of fact and \r\n  was properly submitted to the jury.Â  The general defense verdict may therefore \r\n  be sustained on the negligence claim.Â  See Anderson, 317 S.C. \r\n  at 282, 454 S.E.2d at 355 (Applying the â€œtwo-issueâ€ rule where case submitted \r\n  to jury on only one cause of action, negligence, and only one defense, contributory \r\n  negligence).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSince the general defense verdict may be sustained \r\n  on the negligence cause of action, the judgment of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Â We recognize that in \r\n    South Carolina the doctrine of assumption of risk was largely subsumed by \r\n    the law of comparative negligence in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation, \r\n    333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998).Â  However, the cause of action in this \r\n    present case arose in February 1997, prior to Davenport.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Â Mrs. Cole was admitted \r\n    to the hospital on February 21, 1997.Â  The labor period was prolonged, and \r\n    the record contains a detailed history of the labor process.Â  We need not \r\n    discuss this factual background in light of our disposition of this appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Â While Dr. Raut objected to the general verdict \r\n    form, the Coles did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3903","title":"Montgonery v.

(CSX), was injured as he attempted to tighten a bolt \r\n  on a railroad track.Â  Montgomery filed this action against CSX Transportation, \r\n  Inc. under the Federal Employersâ€™ Liability Act.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  summary judgment.Â  We reverse and remand for trial.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX) owns and operates two mainline tracks north \r\n  of Charleston, South Carolina: the â€œA-lineâ€ and the â€œS-line.â€Â  The A-line runs \r\n  from Charleston to Dillon, South Carolina to Rocky Mount, North Carolina to \r\n  Richmond, Virginia and beyond.Â  The S-line runs from Charleston to Andrews, \r\n  South Carolina then cuts inland to Hamlet, North Carolina, then to Raleigh, \r\n  North Carolina and then cuts eastward and reconnects with the A-line north of \r\n  Rocky Mount.\r\nOther than the physical places that the rails run, \r\n  there are several significant differences between the A-line and S-line.Â  First, \r\n  the A-line is made of â€œwelded rail,â€ which is continuous quarter-mile rail sections \r\n  welded together.Â  Thus, there are no track bolts or nuts on the A-line needed \r\n  to hold the rail together.Â  Contrastively, the S-line is made up of â€œjointed \r\n  rail.â€Â  â€œJointed railâ€ is made from thirty-nine foot rail sections held together \r\n  by â€œrail joints,â€ which are iron plates placed on either side of the ends of \r\n  the rail where they abut.Â  The plates are attached to the rails by six large \r\n  track bolts and nuts which hold the rail sections together.\r\nSecond, the A-line is much more active than the S-line in terms of the amount \r\n  of traffic run by CSX on the rail.Â  The A-line is a â€œClass 4 Trackâ€ â€“ a high \r\n  speed passenger track through which most of the freight is run.Â  On the other \r\n  hand, the S-line is a â€œClass \r\n  3 Trackâ€ that is mostly used for local freight.Â  Between sixteen and seventeen \r\n  trains run daily on the A-line.Â  Approximately three trains run daily on the \r\n  S-line.\r\nThird, at the time of the events which form the basis of this suit, the A-line \r\n  was in much better condition than the S-line. Â Harry Montgomery, the plaintiff \r\n  in this action and a CSX employee since 1977, described the difference between \r\n  the two tracks:\r\n\r\n  [The S-line] was tore up and run down for many years and you had to be there \r\n    to see it.Â  It wasâ€”it was a bad railroad track.Â  It was a bad piece of track.Â  \r\n    It was rough, it was rugged, there was a lot of work.Â  I mean a whole lot \r\n    more work to have been done on that piece of railroad track than it was on \r\n    the A Line.\r\n\r\nBecause of the S-lineâ€™s poor condition, CSX placed \r\n  a lot of â€œslow ordersâ€ on the S-line, which meant that the freight that needed \r\n  to be run was often â€œbacked-up.â€Â  In fact, CSXâ€™s employees were told that the \r\n  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) was going to shut down the S-line because \r\n  the track was in such bad shape. Â Fourth, the employees working on the A-line \r\n  were given more equipment and much superior equipment than that given to Montgomery, \r\n  the only track maintenance employee on the S-line.\r\nMontgomery began working for CSX in 1977.Â  In 1994, he was promoted to foreman.Â  \r\n  At the time of Montgomeryâ€™s injury in 1999, James F. Reed was Montgomeryâ€™s Roadmaster \r\n  in charge of both the A-line and the S-line.Â  Darrell Crook was CSXâ€™s Assistant \r\n  Division Engineer.Â  There were two track inspectors working for Reed: Montgomery \r\n  and Ussery.Â  A track inspectorâ€™s job is to inspect the railroad tracks, look \r\n  for anything that is unsafe, and try to make it safe or take it out of service.Â  \r\n  Montgomery summarized a track inspectorâ€™s duties:\r\n\r\n  [T]ighten[ed] track bolts, replaced broken joints, replaced broken joint \r\n    bars, replaced anything thatâ€™sâ€”that might be broken or defective in a switch \r\n    or onâ€”on, not necessarily in a switch, but preferably in aâ€”well, more important \r\n    in a switch or on just railroad tracks to assure proper rock, railroad we \r\n    call a balance, but itâ€™s railroad rocks, so that you would understand, make \r\n    sure that on a given day if there is a lot of rocks, ample rocks, enough rocks \r\n    on a givenâ€”anything to make sure that signs, railroad signs, that theyâ€™re \r\n    supposed to be in place are in place, report anything that we see thatâ€™s out \r\n    of the ordinary that wouldâ€”that would allow a piece of track to be unsafe.\r\n\r\nAlthough Montgomery had twenty years of experience and Ussery had only worked \r\n  for CSX for two years, Reed and Crook took Montgomery off the A-line and gave \r\n  supervision of that line to Ussery.Â  Montgomery was made the inspector of the \r\n  S-line.Â  Ussery was then labeled the â€œSeniorâ€ Track Inspector.Â  These changes \r\n  occurred approximately one to two months before Montgomeryâ€™s accident.Â  Because \r\n  Montgomery felt his job would be in danger if he complained, he did not refuse \r\n  to work on the S-line.\r\nMontgomery was responsible for the â€œAndrews Subdivisionâ€ of the S-line, a stretch \r\n  of track forty-five to fifty miles long.Â  Crook professed that at the time he \r\n  assigned Montgomery to the Andrews Subdivision of the S-line, he knew that it \r\n  â€œhad a lot of bolts out, [it] had broken bars over there, [it] had a good many \r\n  weak ties and had some surface conditions.â€Â  In actuality, the condition of \r\n  the track was much worse.Â  Few of the bolts that held the jointed rails together \r\n  were secure.Â  Some were loose, while others were missing.Â  In fact, some joint \r\n  bars needed to be totally replaced and/or lifted up.\r\nAlthough Montgomery was technically a â€œforemanâ€ \r\n  at the time of his injury, he had no employees working under his supervision \r\n  on the S-line.Â  Not only was Montgomery the only person assigned to inspect \r\n  the S-line, but he was also the only person to make the repairs and maintenance \r\n  on the S-line.Â  Montgomery was required to inspect and repair and/or replace \r\n  every bolt on every joint bar on the S-line.Â  There are approximately 130 joints \r\n  per mile per rail on the S-line, meaning that there were 3,120 bolts and nuts \r\n  that needed to be checked per mile.Â  Montgomery was required to be certain that \r\n  more than 70,000 bolts were tightened and/or replaced in addition to all the \r\n  other problems with the S-line.\r\nBefore Montgomery began work on this project, Crook advised Montgomery that \r\n  he knew the S-line â€œwas in bad shape.â€Â  Because the S-line was in a state of \r\n  disrepair, Crook promised Montgomery that CSX would provide him with a â€œbolt-tightening \r\n  machineâ€ to do the assignment.Â  A â€œbolt-tightening machineâ€ is a hydraulic, \r\n  eight horsepower machine that mechanically tightens and loosens track nuts.Â  \r\n  Crook gave Montgomery a bolt-tightening machine, albeit a very old one.Â  However, \r\n  Montgomery was provided no other power equipment or welding equipment to repair \r\n  the S-line.Â  On the other hand, even though the A-line has no bolts to tighten \r\n  (because it was welded rail) and was not in disrepair, Ussery was given a new \r\n  truck with which to maintain the A-line.Â  The truck was equipped with a newer \r\n  bolt-tightening machine, a MAT-weld unitâ€”a detachable hydraulic and gas-powered \r\n  unit that allowed the user to operate power tools while working on the line, \r\n  including, but not limited to, power wrenches, power saws, power drills, welding \r\n  equipment, and a welding torch.\r\nOn Montgomeryâ€™s first day of work on the S-line, the old bolt machine given \r\n  to him by Crook failed and became inoperable.Â  It was neither repaired nor replaced \r\n  by CSX.Â  The other bolt-tightening machine issued to Ussery, the only remaining \r\n  machine that CSX allocated to Crookâ€™s department, which covered 1400 miles of \r\n  track, was not made available to Montgomery even though Ussery had no real need \r\n  for it.Â  Because CSX would not give Montgomery another machine or even Usseryâ€™s \r\n  machine, Montgomeryâ€™s only alternative was to replace and tighten the bolts \r\n  by hand with a three to four foot long manual â€œtrack wrench.â€\r\nTo use the track wrench, Montgomery had to stand on the ground facing the rail \r\n  with the head of the wrench pointing down and fastened on the nut.Â  The nut \r\n  is on the opposite side of the rail from the bolt head.Â  The head of the bolt \r\n  is oblong and fits into an oblong hole on the inside of the joint bar so it \r\n  will not move if the nut is tightened or loosened on the other side.Â  Montgomery \r\n  would then push the handle of the wrench from right to left to remove the nut \r\n  or left to right to tighten the nut.\r\nEvery day for the entire day, Montgomery tightened and replaced bolts by hand \r\n  with the manual track wrench.Â  Montgomery stated that he â€œwas supposed to go \r\n  on as far as, you know, my work time would allow me to [every day].â€Â  Although \r\n  Montgomery had been working over a month on the S-lineâ€™s Andrews Subdivision \r\n  at the time he was injured, he had only been able to repair a few of the forty-five \r\n  miles of his assignment before he was hurt.\r\nMontgomery was injured on July 13, 1999, between 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., \r\n  approximately three-and-a-half hours after he began working that day.Â  He was \r\n  trying to tighten a loose nut with the track wrench when the nut stiffened up \r\n  or froze on the bolt.Â  When Montgomery applied more pressure, the frozen nut \r\n  suddenly gave way, the end of the wrench came off the nut, he was thrown between \r\n  the rails by his momentum, and he landed hard on the track on his right knee, \r\n  side, and elbow.Â  Montgomery explained:\r\n\r\n  Okay.Â  When Iâ€”when I started to tighten thisâ€”this bolt, after I seen that \r\n    that boltâ€”that particular bolt was loose, I got my wrench and Iâ€”Iâ€”I positioned \r\n    myself and I, you know, went about trying to tighten it.Â  So I give it a few \r\n    turns and at one point theâ€”the wrench, the bolt actually froze, so I went \r\n    about giving it someâ€”and Iâ€”as I looked, the bolt was notâ€”it was not tightening.Â  \r\n    So when I get toâ€”when I went and put my wrench back on there and I tried to \r\n    tighten it some more, the bolt had froze, which allowed me to apply just a \r\n    little more pressure than normal, and then all of a sudden the whole thing \r\n    gave which sent meâ€”threw me across the rail, sent me across the rail.\r\n\r\nMontgomery had neck surgery and knee surgery as \r\n  a result of the accident.\r\nAt the time Montgomery was injured, which was the mid-point in his shift, he \r\n  had already tightened or replaced over 200 bolts that day.Â  He was not charged \r\n  with violation of any rule by CSX.Â  Yet, the attorney for CSX criticized Montgomery \r\n  for trying to free up and tighten the tough bolt.Â  Montgomery realistically \r\n  had no option but to try to do so:\r\n \r\n  Q:Â  Do you have any procedures or instructions for what to do in the event \r\n    that a bolt sticks like that one did, any rules or regulations?\r\n    A:Â  Well, youâ€™ve gotâ€”youâ€™ve gotâ€”you have several options, because if youâ€”ifâ€”if \r\n    given I had thatâ€”thatâ€”that torch that I was telling you about, you can cut \r\n    it off and donâ€™t even have to use a wrench or if a welder was in the area, \r\n    you canâ€”you can ask him to cut it off, which is the same as cutting it off.\r\n    Q:Â  And then just put a new one on there?\r\n    A:Â  Thatâ€™s right.\r\n    Q:Â  Okay.Â  And why did you not just stop and get somebody to come and do that \r\n    for y[ou]?\r\n    A:Â  Oh, well, no, itâ€™s not like that, Miss.Â  Itâ€™s not that every time you \r\n    run into a joint bar you call a welder to tighten it.Â  Thatâ€™sâ€”thatâ€™sâ€”thatâ€™s \r\n    part of your job.Â  I mean, thatâ€™sâ€”and you donâ€™t cryâ€”you donâ€™t cry or scream \r\n    help every time you run into a minor problem.\r\n  \r\nAccording to Montgomery, even if he had called, \r\n  no one would have come to cut one single bolt:\r\n \r\n  Q:Â  She asked could you have called for help.Â  Could you have gotten any \r\n    help?\r\n    A:Â  It is very doubtful that I would have gotten any.Â  I could have called.\r\n   \r\n    Ms. McLeod:Â  Why is it doubtful?\r\n      The Witness:Â  Because of the amount of people that worksâ€”that was working \r\n      at the time in Bennett Yard, a shortage.\r\n    \r\n\r\nMontgomery filed a personal injury action against CSX under the Federal Employersâ€™ \r\n  Liability Act (FELA), asserting his injuries were caused â€œin whole or in partâ€ \r\n  by the negligence of CSX.Â  Montgomery alleged that he was assigned an unreasonable \r\n  task, maintenance of the entire S-line, and the recurring tightening of bolts \r\n  required by this assignment caused his injury.Â  Alternatively, or in combination \r\n  with the unreasonable task theory, Montgomery averred he was provided insufficient \r\n  equipment for the task assigned.Â  In his complaint, Montgomery specifically \r\n  claimed that CSX was negligent â€œin its engines, cars, appliances, machinery, \r\n  roadbed, track, work assignments and methods, works or other equipmentâ€ and \r\n  in its failure â€œto exercise reasonable care to furnish and maintain reasonably \r\n  safe and suitable equipment and work methods and [to provide] a reasonably safe \r\n  place in which to perform his work.â€\r\nCSX maintained that it follows job analysis and physical qualifications in \r\n  assigning certain jobs.Â  Indeed, Reed stated that a track worker like Montgomery \r\n  would only normally be required to tighten two dozen bolts in a normal day of \r\n  work and that if a worker has to tighten as many as 100 bolts in a day that \r\n  he should be given a bolt tightening machine to properly perform his assignment:\r\n \r\n  Q:Â  If he hadâ€”ifâ€”if you knew that a man would have to tighten as many as \r\n    a hundred bolts in a day, would you give him a machine to do it?\r\n    A:Â  Yes, if we had somebody doing that.\r\n  \r\nReed inconsistently claimed that it is appropriate \r\n  to require an employee to tighten 100 to 150 bolts a day with a track wrench.Â  \r\n  He did not express any opinion about whether 200 bolts was appropriate.Â  Yet, \r\n  Montgomery had already done 200 in less than half of the dayâ€™s work.\r\nIn support of the theories asserted by Montgomery, \r\n  he presented affidavits from two experts that show the assignment given to Montgomery \r\n  and the tools provided to Montgomery were not reasonably safe.Â  First, Montgomery \r\n  produced an affidavit from Don H. Bowden, Sr., a railroad safety consultant.Â  \r\n  Bowden has testified concerning common and reasonable work assignments and safety \r\n  practices in the railroad industry.Â  He explicated that repairing the Andrews \r\n  Subdivision should not have been done by one worker alone:\r\n\r\n  Under common industry practice, this job should not be done by one man alone.Â  \r\n    Mr. Montgomery was assigned to the monumental task of repairing the track \r\n    by himself.Â  While it is not uncommon for one man to be assigned a task in \r\n    inspecting a track, it is unreasonably hazardous to require one man to not \r\n    only inspect the track, but also perform the actual track maintenance himself.Â  \r\n    A prudent and reasonable railroad would assign a gang of men to do this type \r\n    of job.Â  To do otherwise, in my opinion, subjects the employee to an unsafe \r\n    workplace in the railroad industry because an accident is bound to happen.\r\n\r\nBowden declared the track wrench was an unsafe and \r\n  unsuitable tool for this assignment:\r\n\r\n  The unreasonable hazards to which Mr. Montgomery was exposed by working this \r\n    track by himself were greatly exacerbated and increased by CSX requiring him \r\n    to replace and/or tighten the track bolts with a manual track wrench.Â  While \r\n    it is not uncommon for workers to use manual track wrenches to tighten sporadic \r\n    loose bolts on a stretch of track, this particular track was in such a state \r\n    of disrepair that the use of a track wrench was not only impracticable, it \r\n    unreasonably increased the likelihood of injury to Mr. Montgomery.Â  To use \r\n    an analogy, a swing-blade works fine to knock-down sporadic weeds on a private \r\n    lawn; however, one would not require a man to use a swing-blade to clear several \r\n    years of growth on a 100 acre plat of land.Â  In addition to the sheer volume \r\n    of bolts that Mr. Montgomery needed to replace and/or tighten, the condition \r\n    of the bolts and the track also made the manual track wrench an unsuitable \r\n    tool for this job.Â  This track had been neglected by CSX for a long period \r\n    of time.Â  As such, CSX should have known that the bolts were very likely to \r\n    be â€œrusted-on,â€ making them very difficult to remove and/or tighten.Â  Requiring \r\n    Mr. Montgomery to work with a manual wrench in these conditions unreasonably \r\n    multiplied his risk of injury.Â  Mr. Montgomeryâ€™s description of the accident \r\n    shows these hazards were present because he was required to use a tremendous \r\n    amount of leverage on the wrench to break through the rust.Â  For all of these \r\n    reasons, a prudent and reasonable railroad would not have supplied just a \r\n    track wrench to Mr. Montgomery to do this job.Â  A prudent and reasonable railroad \r\n    would have provided him with another bolt tightening machine when the first \r\n    one became inoperable or would have fixed the one assigned to him.\r\n\r\nSecond, Montgomery submitted the affidavit of Dr. \r\n  Tyler A. Kress, Ph.D., a biomechanical engineer.Â  In his affidavit, Dr. Kress \r\n  discussed a 1986 study undertaken by the Association of American Railroads, \r\n  which indicated that 11.1% of all tool-related injuries resulted from the use \r\n  of track wrenches.Â  Dr. Kress opined the type of work that Montgomery was performing \r\n  daily and the tools he was given to perform that work created unreasonably dangerous \r\n  biomechanical risks to his body:\r\n \r\n  It is my opinion that (1) the type of work that Mr. Montgomery was performing \r\n    daily and (2) the tools he was given to perform that work created unreasonably \r\n    dangerous biomechanical risk factors to his body.Â  It is my further opinion \r\n    that these risk factors are consistent with his fall and the injuries he sustained \r\n    as a result of his fall.\r\n  Apparently, Mr. Montgomery was ordered to perform the repetitive motion of \r\n    tightening and untightening bolts with a manual track wrench.Â  Proper use \r\n    of the track wrench requires the employee to keep the head of the wrench fixed \r\n    on the nut that is being tightened or untightened. Â Keeping the head of the \r\n    wrench on the nut is even more important when the bolts and nuts are rusted \r\n    and susceptible to being â€œstuck.â€Â  Sporadic use of the track wrench to tighten \r\n    and untighten nuts and bolts would not normally cause risk to the human body.Â  \r\n    However, performing repetitive tasks dailyâ€”and specifically ones that require \r\n    push/pull forces of the upper extremity and upper body like the track wrenchâ€”are \r\n    widely associated with increased risk of injury because of the cumulative \r\n    effects of the repetition and fatigue.Â  In Mr. Montgomeryâ€™s work environment, \r\n    his use of the track wrench was not spora[d]ic because of the sheer number \r\n    of bolts that were evidentially in disrepair on this stretch of track.Â  His \r\n    fatigue from this manual, repetitive motion was increased by the increased \r\n    forces needed to free the nuts and bolts from their rusted condition.Â  With \r\n    each repetitive use of the wrench, it became more physically difficult for \r\n    Mr. Montgomery to control the wrench and its pivot point where the head is \r\n    fastened to the nut.Â  The probabilities of both (1) the wrench slipping off \r\n    of the nut and (2) an abrupt motion occurring because of a nut breaking free \r\n    are increased significantly due to the repetitive and tiring nature of the \r\n    assigned job.Â  It is understandable that Mr. Montgomery may fall if and when \r\n    one of these events occur.Â  Therefore, it is my opinion that his fall is a \r\n    natural result of the work environment imposed on him by C.S.X.\r\n\r\nCSX moved for summary judgment, which the circuit \r\n  court granted.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Under FELA and South Carolina summary judgment procedure, did the \r\n    trial court err in granting the railroad employer summary judgment on a railroad \r\n    employeeâ€™s claim for negligent failure to provide a safe workplace?\r\n  II.Â Â Â Â Â  Under FELA and South Carolina summary judgment procedure, did the \r\n    trial court err in granting a railroad employer summary judgment on a railroad \r\n    employeeâ€™s claim for negligent failure to provide safe and suitable equipment?\r\n  III.Â Â Â Â  Under FELA and South Carolina summary judgment procedure, did the \r\n    trial court err in granting a railroad employer summary judgment on a railroad \r\n    employeeâ€™s FELA combined negligence claims?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment \r\n  motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial \r\n  court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.Â  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists v. M.S. Bailey &amp; \r\n  Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, 584 S.E.2d 375 (2003); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, \r\n  354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In determining whether any triable \r\n  issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be \r\n  drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003); \r\n  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If \r\n  triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l \r\n  Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002); Young v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further \r\n  inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of \r\n  the law.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 \r\n  S.E.2d 672 (2000); Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but \r\n  only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment \r\n  should be denied.Â  Schmidt, 357 S.C. at 319, 592 S.E.2d at 331.Â  Summary \r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â  Cunningham \r\n  v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003); Redwend \r\n  Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Expert Witnesses/Affidavits\r\nRule 56(e), SCRCP, requires a party opposing summary \r\n  judgment to come forward with affidavits or other supporting documents demonstrating \r\n  the existence of a genuine issue for trial.Â  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. \r\n  316, 548 S.E.2d 854 (2001).Â  Where a motion for summary judgment is made and \r\n  supported by proper affidavits, a plaintiff cannot rest on allegations in his \r\n  pleadings that are controverted by affidavits and/or depositions submitted by \r\n  defendants.Â  See Rule 56(e), SCRCP; Manley v. Manley, 291 S.C. \r\n  325, 353 S.E.2d 312 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUse and admissibility of affidavit and deposition \r\n  testimony to rebut a motion for summary judgment is governed by Rule 56(e) and \r\n  reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall \r\n    set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively \r\n    that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. . \r\n    . . The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, \r\n    answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits.\r\n\r\nRule 56(e), SCRCP.Â  Our appellate courts have interpreted \r\n  Rule 56(e) to mean materials used to support or refute a motion for summary \r\n  judgment must be those which would be admissible in evidence.Â  Hall v. Fedor, \r\n  349 S.C. 169, 561 S.E.2d 654 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œ[O]n a defendantâ€™s motion for \r\n  summary judgment, there will usually be no genuine issue of material fact unless \r\n  the plaintiff presents expert testimony on the standard of care and its breach \r\n  by the defendant.â€Â  Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 334, 440 S.E.2d 379, \r\n  381 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Botehlo v. Bycura, 282 S.C. 578, 320 S.E.2d \r\n  59 (Ct. App. 1984)).\r\nII.Â  FELA\r\nSection 1 of FELA renders common carrier railroads \r\n  â€œliable in damages to any person suffering injury while . . . employed by [the] \r\n  carrierâ€ if the â€œinjury or death result[ed] in whole or in part from the negligence \r\n  of any of the officers, agents, or employees of [the railroad].â€Â  45 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 51 (1986).Â  When Congress enacted FELA in 1908, its focus was on reducing \r\n  injuries and death to employees resulting from accidents on interstate railroads.Â  \r\n  Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532 (1994).Â  Cognizant \r\n  of the physical dangers of railroading that resulted in the death or maiming \r\n  of thousands of workers every year, Congress crafted a federal remedy that â€œshifted \r\n  part of the human overhead of doing business from employees to their employers.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 542 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nFELA is a broad remedial statute which the United \r\n  States Supreme Court construes liberally in order to effectuate its purposes.Â  \r\n  See Id. at 543.Â  The Supreme Court has interpreted FELAâ€™s language \r\n  liberally in light of its humanitarian purposes.Â  Metro-North Commuter R.R. \r\n  v. Buckley, 521 U.S. 424 (1997).\r\nState courts have concurrent jurisdiction to hear \r\n  FELA claims.Â  45 U.S.C. Â§ 56 (1986).Â  A FELA action brought in state court is \r\n  controlled by federal substantive law and state procedural law.Â  Norton v. \r\n  Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 350 S.C. 473, 567 S.E.2d 851 (2002).Â  However, a form \r\n  of practice may not defeat a federal right.Â  Brown v. Western Ry., 338 \r\n  U.S. 294 (1949); Norton, 350 S.C. at 476, 567 S.E.2d at 853.Â  A FELA \r\n  action is controlled by state procedural law as long as the state procedural \r\n  law does not conflict with federal substantive right guaranteed by FELA.Â  Norton, \r\n  350 S.C. at 476, 567 S.E.2d at 853.Â  It is firmly established that questions \r\n  of sufficiency of evidence for the jury in cases arising under FELA in state \r\n  courts are to be determined by federal rules.Â  Brady v. Southern Ry. Co., \r\n  320 U.S. 476 (1943); Norton, 350 S.C. at 476, 567 S.E.2d at 853.Â  The \r\n  sufficiency of evidence needed to withstand a motion for summary judgment in \r\n  a FELA case is controlled by federal, not state law.Â  Norton, 350 S.C. \r\n  at 476, 567 S.E.2d at 853.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court noted that liability \r\n  under FELA rests upon â€œnegligenceâ€ and that FELA does not make the railroad \r\n  the insurer for all employee injuries.Â  See Metro-North Commuter R.R., \r\n  521 U.S. at 429; Gottshall, 512 U.S. at 543.Â  Although railroad workers \r\n  are required to prove negligence under the federal FELA standard, the Supreme \r\n  Court has held that employees need only show that their employerâ€™s negligence \r\n  â€œplayed any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.â€Â  Gottshall, \r\n  512 U.S. at 543 (emphasis added &amp; internal quotations omitted).Â  A plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  burden in a FELA action is significantly lighter than it would be in an ordinary \r\n  South Carolina common law negligence case:\r\n\r\n  [FELAâ€™s] [history] has been said to reduce the extent of the negligence required, \r\n    as well as the quantum of proof necessary to establish it, to the â€œvanishing \r\n    point.â€Â  While it is still undoubtedly true that there must be some shreds \r\n    of proof both of negligence and of causation, and that â€œspeculation, conjecture \r\n    and possibilitiesâ€ will not be enough, there appears to be little doubt that \r\n    under [FELA] jury verdicts for the plaintiff can be sustained upon evidence \r\n    which would not be sufficient in the ordinary negligence action.\r\n\r\nNorton v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 341 S.C. 165, \r\n  533 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds, 350 S.C. 473, \r\n  567 S.E.2d 851 (2002) (citing W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton \r\n  on Torts Â§ 80, at 578 (5th ed. 1984)) (internal quotations omitted).\r\nÂ \r\nIn Blair v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 323 U.S. 600 (1945), the United \r\n  States Supreme Court articulated:\r\n\r\n  We think there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question \r\n    of negligence posed by the complaint.Â  The duty of the employer â€œbecomes â€˜more \r\n    imperativeâ€™ as the risk increases.â€Â  Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., \r\n    319 U.S. 350, 352, 353, 63 S.Ct. 1062, 1063, 1064, 87 L.Ed. 1444 [(1943)].Â  \r\n    See also Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318 U.S. 54, \r\n    67, 63 S.Ct. 444, 451, 87 L.Ed. 610 [(1943)].Â  The negligence of the employer \r\n    may be determined by viewing its conduct as a whole.Â  Union Pacific \r\n    Railroad Co. v. Hadley, 246 U.S. 330, 332, 333, 38 S.Ct. 318, 319, 62 \r\n    L.Ed. 751 [(1918)].Â  And especially is this true in a case such as this, where \r\n    the several elements from which negligence might be inferred are so closely \r\n    interwoven as to form a single pattern, and where each imparts \r\n    character to the others.\r\n\r\nId. at 604 (emphasis added).\r\nThereafter, in Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S. 645 (1946), the Supreme Court \r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n  It is no answer to say that the juryâ€™s verdict involved speculation and conjecture.Â  \r\n    Whenever facts are in dispute or the evidence is such that fair-minded men \r\n    may draw different inferences, a measure of speculation and conjecture is \r\n    required on the part of those whose duty it is to settle the dispute by choosing \r\n    what seems to them to be the most reasonable inference.Â  Only when there is \r\n    a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion reached does \r\n    a reversible error appear.Â  But where, as here, there is an evidentiary basis \r\n    for the juryâ€™s verdict, the jury is free to discard or disbelieve whatever \r\n    facts are inconsistent with its conclusion.Â  And the appellate courtâ€™s function \r\n    is exhausted when that evidentiary basis becomes apparent, it being immaterial \r\n    that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion \r\n    is more reasonable.\r\n\r\nId. at 653.\r\nRogers v. Missouri Pacific R.R., 352 U.S. 500 (1957), is particularly \r\n  instructive:\r\n \r\n  Under th[e FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify \r\n    with reason the conclusion that e[m]ployer negligence played any part, even \r\n    the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are \r\n    sought.Â  It does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also \r\n    with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes. \r\n    . . .Â  Judicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question \r\n    is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, \r\n    the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any \r\n    part at all in the injury or death.Â  Judges are to fix their sights primarily \r\n    to make that appraisal and, if that test is met, are bound to find that a \r\n    case for the jury is made out whether or not the evidence allows the jury \r\n    a choice of other probabilities.Â  The statute expressly imposes liability \r\n    upon the employer to pay damages for injury or death due â€œin whole or in \r\n    partâ€ to its negligence. (Emphasis added.)\r\n  The law was enacted because the Congress was dissatisfied with the common-law \r\n    duty of the master to his servant.Â  The statute supplants that duty with the \r\n    far more drastic duty of paying damages for injury or death at work due in \r\n    whole or in part to the employerâ€™s negligence.Â  The employer is stripped of \r\n    his common-law defenses and for practical purposes the inquiry in these \r\n    cases today rarely presents more than the single question whether negligence \r\n    of the employer played any part, however small, in the injury or death which \r\n    is the subject of the suit.Â  The burden of the employee is met, and \r\n    the obligation of the employer to pay damages arises, when there is proof, \r\n    even though entirely circumstantial, from which the jury may with reason make \r\n    that inference.\r\n  The kind of misconception evidenced in the opinion below, which fails to \r\n    take into account the special features of this statutory negligence action \r\n    that make it significantly different from the ordinary common-law negligence \r\n    action, has required this Court to review a number of cases.Â  In a relatively \r\n    large percentage of the cases reviewed, the Court has found that lower courts \r\n    have not given proper scope to this integral part of the congressional scheme.Â  \r\n    We reach the same conclusion in this case.Â  The decisions of this Court \r\n    after the 1939 amendments teach that the Congress vested the power of decision \r\n    in these actions exclusively in the jury in all but the infrequent cases where \r\n    fair-minded jurors cannot honestly differ whether fault of the employer played \r\n    any part in the employeeâ€™s injury.Â  Special and important reasons for \r\n    the grant of certiorari in these cases are certainly present when lower federal \r\n    and state courts persistently deprive litigants of their right to a jury determination.\r\n\r\nId. at 506-11 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nA.Â  Unreasonable Task of Repairing the S-Line Track\r\nAs a corollary to the railroad employerâ€™s duty to maintain safe working conditions, \r\n  it is required to provide its employee with sufficient help in the performance \r\n  of the work assigned to him.Â  Blair v.

Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 323 U.S. 600 (1945), clarified that, while \r\n  several factors operating alone might not constitute negligence, where an insufficient \r\n  amount of workers and insufficient tools combine together to create \r\n  an unreasonably unsafe place to work, a breach of duty is established:\r\n\r\n  We think there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question \r\n    of negligence posed by the complaint.Â  The duty of the employer â€œbecomes â€˜more \r\n    imperativeâ€™ as the risk increases.â€Â  The negligence of the employer may be \r\n    determined by viewing its conduct as a whole.Â  And especially is this \r\n    true in a case such as this, where the several elements from which negligence \r\n    might be inferred are so closely interwoven as to form a single \r\n    pattern, and where each imparts character to the others.\r\n\r\nId. at 604 (emphasis added and citations \r\n  omitted).Â  The Blair Court held that the fact that the plaintiff was \r\n  commanded to undertake the movement of a greased, 1000 pound steel tube, thirty \r\n  feet in length, with only a five foot truck and with only a few men â€œraised \r\n  questions appropriate for a jury to appraise in considering whether or not the \r\n  injury was the result of negligence as alleged in the complaint.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 604-05 (citations omitted).Â  The Court ruled: â€œWe cannot say as a matter \r\n  of law that the railroad complied with its duties in a reasonably careful manner \r\n  under the circumstances hereâ€ and that â€œthe jury, and not the court, \r\n  should finally determine these issues.â€Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nThe Blair case is controlling here.Â  To make Montgomery not only work \r\n  on the entire Andrews Subdivision of the S-line by himself all day, every day, \r\n  until completed, but also limiting his ability to make the numerous repairs \r\n  by only providing him with a manual track wrench is prima facie \r\n  evidence of negligence, if not negligence as a matter of law.Â  Because there \r\n  is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that CSX failed to \r\n  provide Montgomery with a safe workplace, the trial court improperly invaded \r\n  the province of the jury to determine whether or not CSX was negligent.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge concluded that the expert affidavits did not create a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact.Â  In contrariety to the circuit judgeâ€™s finding, we come \r\n  to the ineluctable conclusion that the expert witness affidavits were not only \r\n  admissible but created genuine issues of material fact as to NEGLIGENCE \r\n  under FELA.Â  The circuit judge mistakenly and improvidently rejected the expertsâ€™ \r\n  opinions in the case sub judice.\r\nBecause a jury may reasonably draw inferences under \r\n  the evidence that CSX was negligent, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment \r\n  was erroneous.Â  It was improper for the trial court to weigh the quality or \r\n  quantity of the evidence or to determine as a matter of law the inferences that \r\n  may be drawn.Â  â€œTo deprive [railroad] workers of the benefit of a jury trial \r\n  in close or doubtful cases is to take away a goodly portion of the relief which \r\n  Congress has afforded them.â€Â  Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., Inc., 319 \r\n  U.S. 350, 354 (1943).\r\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order granting summary judgment and REMAND this case for a jury trial.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):Â  \r\n  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the trial courtâ€™s determination that \r\n  Montgomery failed to present sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment \r\n  on any of his three theories of CSXâ€™s alleged negligence under FELA. \r\nA FELA action in state court is controlled by federal substantive law. [1] Â  I agree that, under the federal FELA standard, a plaintiff \r\n  in a FELA case need only show that the â€œemployerâ€™s negligence played any part, \r\n  even the slightest, in producing the injury.â€ \r\n  [2] Â  Nevertheless, although the quantum of evidence sufficient to present \r\n  a jury question of causation in a FELA case is less than that required in a \r\n  common law tort case, the plaintiff must still demonstrate some causal connection \r\n  between the defendantâ€™s negligence and the alleged injury. [3] Â  As the South Carolina Supreme Court has recognized, â€œâ€˜the \r\n  FELA . . . is not to be interpreted as a workersâ€™ compensation statute.â€™â€ \r\n  [4] \r\nIn support of his argument that sufficient evidence was presented of CSXâ€™s \r\n  failure to provide sufficient help with the repair of the S-line, Montgomery \r\n  points to the affidavit of Don A. Bowden, a railroad safety consultant, who \r\n  stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  5.Â  Under common industry practice, this job should not be done by one man \r\n    alone.Â  Mr. Montgomery was assigned to the monumental task of repairing the \r\n    track by himself.Â  While it is not uncommon for one man to be assigned a task \r\n    in inspecting a track, it is unreasonably hazardous to require one man to \r\n    not only inspect the track, but also perform the actual track maintenance \r\n    himself.Â  A prudent and reasonable railroad would assign a gang of men to \r\n    do this type of job.Â  To do otherwise, in my opinion, subjects the employee \r\n    to an unsafe workplace in the railroad industry because an accident is bound \r\n    to happen.\r\n\r\nI agree with the trial court \r\n  that, because the dispute here did not involve a task that required more than \r\n  one worker, such as dragging a heavy object, assigning additional employees \r\n  would mean only that the job would be finished more quickly. \r\n  [5] Â  Indeed, it was acknowledged by Montgomery himself that CSX imposed \r\n  no time limits or quotas for the work Montgomery was performing at the time \r\n  of his injury. [6] Â  Moreover, Bowden did not explain \r\n  why the task assigned to Montgomery was unreasonably dangerous without additional \r\n  help or how Montgomeryâ€™s accident was â€œbound to happenâ€ as a result of this \r\n  circumstance. [7] \r\nIn addition, Montgomery cites Forcino v. National Railroad Passenger Corp. [8]  in support of his argument that an unreasonable \r\n  work assignment from CSX proximately caused his injuries.Â  I agree with CSX \r\n  that this reliance is misplaced.Â  \r\nIn Forcino, the plaintiff, while repairing a track that had been damaged \r\n  by a derailment, allegedly injured himself as a result of the strain and fatigue \r\n  of the heavy work.Â  Unlike Montgomery, however, Forcino was performing a task \r\n  outside his regularly assigned duties when he was injured, had been told to \r\n  rush to finish the job to which he had been reassigned, and had worked without \r\n  taking his normal afternoon break.Â  In contrast, at the time of his injury, \r\n  Montgomery was doing the same tasks that he had been performing for at least \r\n  the previous month, had never claimed to be affected by fatigue, and by his \r\n  own admission was instructed to go only as far as he was able to work at his \r\n  own speed. \r\nMontgomery further challenges the trial courtâ€™s determination that â€œ[t]he lack \r\n  of any time requirement precludes a claim that defendant exposed plaintiff in \r\n  a â€˜fatigued and exhausted condition to unreasonable perilâ€™ so that defendant \r\n  could be found negligent in doing so.â€Â  Assuming without deciding that Montgomery \r\n  is correct that the trial court should not have made this finding, this error \r\n  is of no consequence.Â  Montgomery never specifically argued on appeal that he \r\n  was suffering from fatigue or exhaustion on the day he was injured.\r\nMontgomery further contends that the practical considerations of the burdens \r\n  imposed by CSX could yield the inference that he felt pressure to maintain more \r\n  bolts than could be reasonably expected of an employee in his situation.Â  This \r\n  argument lacks merit.Â  \r\nMontgomery first points out \r\n  that, had he tightened only as many bolts as his supervisor agreed was reasonable \r\n  during a normal workday, he would have taken almost eight years to complete \r\n  his assignment.  [9] Â  He further \r\n  argues that testimony from his supervisor that CSX would lose profits when a \r\n  rail is in disrepair gives rise to an inference that CSX would look unfavorably \r\n  on his performance unless he worked at a faster than normal pace.Â  There was \r\n  no evidence, however, that Montgomery himself was aware of any financial concerns \r\n  of CSX.\r\nSimilarly, Montgomery cites \r\n  the threat of a shutdown of the S-line by the Federal Railroad Administration \r\n  as additional evidence of an internal time pressure imposed by CSX.Â  He testified \r\n  in his deposition that there had been â€œsome talks . . . that . . . [the] â€˜Sâ€™ \r\n  line was in bad shape, that something had to be done or they were talking about \r\n  shutting the railroads down.â€Â  I agree with CSX, however, that this evidence \r\n  was hearsay and therefore properly rejected by the trial court. [10] Â  \r\nSimilarly, I find no merit to Montgomeryâ€™s argument that he had presented sufficient \r\n  evidence to support a finding that CSX was negligent in providing him with only \r\n  a manual track tool.Â  \r\nUnder FELA, employers are under a duty to exercise ordinary care to supply \r\n  machinery and appliances reasonably safe and suitable for the use of their employees; \r\n  however, employers are not required to furnish the latest, best, and safest \r\n  appliances, or discard standard appliances upon the discovery of later improvements, \r\n  provided those in use are reasonably safe and suitable. \r\n  [11] Â  It is undisputed that the track wrench Montgomery was using when \r\n  he fell was not defective and was similar to other track wrenches he had used \r\n  for the past twenty years.Â  \r\nThe focus of this controversy comes down to whether \r\n  CSX should have provided a bolt-tightening machine in view of expert testimony \r\n  suggesting that a manual track wrench, although not defective, was unreasonably \r\n  dangerous for Montgomeryâ€™s assignment. [12] \r\nBowden provided a statement acknowledging that, \r\n  although a manual track tool was safe and suitable for sporadic tightening and \r\n  untightening of bolts, the Andrews subdivision â€œwas in such a state of disrepair \r\n  that the use of a track wrench was not only impracticable, it unreasonably increased \r\n  the likelihood of injury to Mr. Montgomery.â€Â  Bowden further noted that, as \r\n  the S-line â€œhad been neglected by CSX for a long period of time,â€ â€œCSX should \r\n  have known that the bolts were very likely to be â€˜rusted on,â€™ making them very \r\n  difficult to remove and/or tighten.â€ Â Similarly, Tyler A. Kress, an industrial \r\n  engineer, stated in an affidavit that â€œwhen an employee is forced to use a manual \r\n  track wrench all day long on rusted and poorly tended nuts and bolts, the risk \r\n  of injury increases with each repetitive use.â€ \r\nI would hold the trial court correctly concluded \r\n  that the expert opinions offered in response to CSXâ€™s summary judgment motion \r\n  do not give rise to an inference that a manual track wrench was not reasonably \r\n  safe for the work that was assigned to Montgomery.Â  There was no admissible \r\n  evidence supporting a finding that Montgomery was subject to any pressure with \r\n  respect to the amount of work he had to complete in any given time period.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the record is devoid of any suggestion that Montgomery was suffering \r\n  from fatigue or other ill effects of repetitive motion. [13] \r\nFinally, citing Blair v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio \r\n  Railroad Co., [14]  Montgomery argues he presented \r\n  sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of CSX through the combined effect \r\n  of its failure to provide him with the necessary help and its refusal to give \r\n  him proper equipment.Â  I disagree.\r\nIn Blair, the Supreme Court, in reinstating \r\n  an award under FELA, held there was sufficient evidence of the railroad defendantâ€™s \r\n  negligence to have the issue determined by a jury.Â  In so holding, the Supreme \r\n  Court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  The negligence of the employer may be determined by viewing its conduct as \r\n    a whole.Â  And especially is this true in a case such as this, where the several \r\n    elements from which negligence might be inferred are so closely interwoven \r\n    as to form a single pattern, and where each imparts character to the others. \r\n    [15] \r\n\r\nFurther reading of the opinion, however, indicates \r\n  that the cumulative impact of the â€œseveral elements from which negligence might \r\n  be inferredâ€ was not the deciding factor in the decision.Â  Rather, it is evident \r\n  from the text immediately following what is quoted above that the Supreme Court \r\n  had already accepted the premise that the railroad employer was negligent in \r\n  several respects, any one of which would have been actionable in its own right, \r\n  and the relationship between all of these undisputed manifestations of negligence \r\n  only enhanced an already meritorious action:\r\n\r\n  The nature of the duty which the petitioner was commanded to undertake, the \r\n    dangers of moving a greased, 1000 pound steel tube, 30 feet in length, on \r\n    a 5 foot truck, the area over which that truck was compelled to be moved, \r\n    the suitableness of the tools used in an extraordinary manner to accomplish \r\n    a novel purpose, the number of men assigned to assist him, their experience \r\n    in such work and their ability to perform the duties and the manner in which \r\n    they performed those dutiesâ€”all of these raised questions appropriate for \r\n    a jury to appraise in considering whether or not the injury was the result \r\n    of negligence as alleged in the complaint.Â  We cannot say as a matter \r\n    of law that the railroad complied with its duties in a reasonably careful \r\n    manner under the circumstances here, nor that the conduct which the jury might \r\n    have found to be negligent did not contribute to petitionerâ€™s injury â€œin whole \r\n    or in part.â€Â  Consequently, we think the jury, and not the court should finally \r\n    determine these issues. [16] \r\n\r\nIn contrast, none of the specifications of negligence \r\n  alleged in the present case had sufficient evidentiary support to withstand \r\n  CSXâ€™s summary judgment motion.Â  Blair therefore is easily distinguishable \r\n  from the present case.\r\nI would affirm the grant of summary judgment to CSX.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Norton v.

App. 2004).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLandis contends the circuit court erred in affirming \r\n  his conviction because the State failed to comply with the mandatory provisions \r\n  of section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2001) requiring videotaping \r\n  at the incident site.Â  Landis presents two arguments supporting his position.Â  \r\n  First, he argues the circuit court erred in finding that Trooper Davis constituted \r\n  the arresting officer as contemplated by section 56-5-2953.Â  Second, Landis \r\n  alleges the circuit court erred in finding that the affidavit requirement of \r\n  section 56-5-2953(B) was satisfied by the State.Â  We disagree and affirm.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.Â  State \r\n  v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing State \r\n  v. Baucom, 340 S.C. 339, 531 S.E.2d 922 (2000)).Â  All rules of statutory \r\n  construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail \r\n  if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must \r\n  be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  State \r\n  v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1999) cert. denied \r\n  as improvidently granted, State v. Hudson, 346 S.C. 139, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  253 (2001).Â  The determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.Â  Hudson, \r\n  336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577.Â Â Â  \r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained \r\n  primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  Morgan at 366, 547 \r\n  S.E.2d at 206.Â  Words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without \r\n  resorting to subtle or forced construction which limits or expands the statuteâ€™s \r\n  operation.Â  Id.Â  When faced with an undefined statutory term, the court \r\n  must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  This Court must apply clear and unambiguous terms of a statute according to \r\n  their literal meaning.Â  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 \r\n  (1991).Â  We should consider, not merely the language of the particular clause \r\n  being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose \r\n  of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  Whitner v. State, 328 \r\n  S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997).Â Â  The terms must be construed in context and \r\n  their meaning determined by looking at the other terms used in the statue.Â  \r\n  Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577.Â Â Â  \r\nWhen a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, \r\n  and conveys clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules \r\n  of statutory interpretation and a court has no right to look for or impose another \r\n  meaning.Â  City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d 492 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  The statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and \r\n  fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Any ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, \r\n  equitable, and beneficial operation of the law.Â  Id.; City of Sumter \r\n  Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  894 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nI.Â  Arresting Officer\r\nLandis asserts the State Transport Police Officerâ€”not Trooper \r\n  Davisâ€”was the arresting officer at the incident site.Â  Consequently, Landis \r\n  contends that any effort by the State to comply with the statutory requirements \r\n  of section 56-5-2953 must be met by the State Transport Officer as the arresting \r\n  officer.Â  The circuit court found Trooper Davis, not the State Transport Officer, \r\n  was the arresting officer pursuant to section 56-5-2953.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 56-7-2953 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A)Â  A person who violates Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, \r\n  or 56-5-2945 must have his conduct at the incident site and the breath test \r\n  site videotaped.\r\nÂ (1)Â  The videotaping at the incident site must:\r\n  \r\n(a)Â  begin not later than the activation of the officerâ€™s \r\n  blue lights and conclude after the arrest of the person for a violation of Section \r\n  56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or a probable cause determination that the person violated \r\n  Section 56-5-2945 . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\n\r\n(B)Â  . . . .Â  Failure by the arresting officer \r\n  to produce the videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground \r\n  for dismissal of any charge made pursuant to Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, \r\n  or 56-5-2945 if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit . . . \r\n  . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added).\r\nThe statute does not define â€œarresting officer.â€Â  \r\n  Consequently, we must interpret this phrase in accord with its usual and customary \r\n  meaning.Â  See City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  492 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating when legislature elects not to define a term in \r\n  a statute, courts will interpret term in accord with its usual and customary \r\n  meaning).Â Â  \r\nPellucidly, the record supports the finding that Trooper \r\n  Davis was the â€œarresting officerâ€ as that phrase is ordinarily understood.Â  \r\n  Trooper Davis personally observed Landisâ€™ driving prior to the traffic stop.Â  \r\n  He arrived at the scene simultaneously with the State Transport Officer.Â  Trooper \r\n  Davis pulled in directly behind the Transport Officer and approached just after \r\n  Landis had been removed from his vehicle.Â  Moreover, Trooper Davis conducted \r\n  the field sobriety test, determined Landis was impaired, and placed him under \r\n  arrest for DUI.Â  \r\nIn State v. Garvin, 341 S.C. 122, 533 S.E.2d 591 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000), we noted:Â  \r\n\r\nThe term â€œarrestâ€ has a technical meaning, applicable in \r\n  legal proceedings.Â  It implies that a person is thereby restrained of his liberty \r\n  by some officer or agent of the law, armed with lawful process, authorizing \r\n  and requiring the arrest to be made.Â  It is intended to serve, and does serve, \r\n  the end of bringing the person arrested personally within the custody and control \r\n  of the law, for the purpose specified in, or contemplated by, the process.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 126-27, 533 S.E.2d at 593 (quoting State \r\n  v. Leak, 11 N.C.App. 344, 181 S.E.2d 224 (1971)).Â  Trooper Davis â€œrestrained \r\n  [Landis] of his libertyâ€ and brought him â€œwithin the custody and control of \r\n  the law.â€Â  Therefore, we hold that the State Transport Officer merely assisted \r\n  in facilitating the traffic stop.Â  Trooper Davis was the arresting officer responsible \r\n  for meeting the statutory videotaping requirements of section 56-5-2953(A).Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Videotaping \r\n  Requirements\r\nLandis argues the State failed to comply with the videotape \r\n  requirements of the incident scene contained in section 56-5-2953(A) of the \r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2001).Â  Specifically, Landis contends the circuit \r\n  court erred in affirming his conviction because the affidavit prepared by Trooper \r\n  Davis was not entered into evidence at trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 56-5-2953(A) provides that a person charged with \r\n  driving under the influence shall have â€œhis conduct at the incident site and \r\n  the breath test site videotaped.â€Â  Videotaping at the incident site must begin \r\n  not later than the activation of the officerâ€™s blue lights and conclude after \r\n  the arrest of the person.Â  S.C. Code Ann. section 56-5-2953(A)(1)(a) (Supp. \r\n  2001).Â  While Trooper Davis was unable to videotape the arrest due to the inoperable \r\n  condition of his videotape equipment, section 56-5-2953(B) clearly envisions \r\n  instances where videotape might not be available at the incident site and provides:\r\n\r\nNothing in this section may be construed as prohibiting \r\n  the introduction of other evidence in the trial of a violation of Section 56-5-2930, \r\n  56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945. Failure by the arresting officer to produce the \r\n  videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal of any \r\n  charge made pursuant to Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 if \r\n  the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that the videotape \r\n  equipment at the time of the arrest, probable cause determination, or breath \r\n  test device was in an inoperable condition, stating reasonable efforts have \r\n  been made to maintain the equipment in an operable condition, and certifying \r\n  that there was no other operable breath test facility available in the county \r\n  or, in the alternative, submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was physically \r\n  impossible to produce the videotape because the person needed emergency medical \r\n  treatment, or exigent circumstances existed. Further, in circumstances including, \r\n  but not limited to, road blocks, traffic accident investigations, and citizensâ€™ \r\n  arrests, where an arrest has been made and the videotaping equipment has not \r\n  been activated by blue lights, the failure by the arresting officer to produce \r\n  the videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal. \r\n  However, as soon as videotaping is practicable in these circumstances, videotaping \r\n  must begin and conform with the provisions of this section. Nothing in this \r\n  section prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the \r\n  failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances; \r\n  nor do the provisions of this section prohibit the person from offering evidence \r\n  relating to the arresting law enforcement officer's failure to produce the videotape.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. section 56-5-2953(B) (Supp. 2001) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  \r\nIn accordance with section 56-5-2953(B), Trooper \r\n  Davis prepared a sworn affidavit certifying that his videotape equipment was \r\n  inoperable at the time of the arrest despite reasonable efforts to repair the \r\n  equipment.Â  Trooper Davis testified at trial to the existence of the affidavit:\r\n\r\nQ:Â  Was your car equipped with video at this time?\r\nA:Â  It was, but it was inoperable at the time.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ:Â  And pursuant to section [56-5-2953] did you sign \r\n  an affidavit for failure to produce videotape indicating that your videotaping \r\n  machine was inoperable?\r\nA:Â  Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Landisâ€™ counsel was provided a copy of Trooper \r\n  Davisâ€™ affidavit. \r\n\r\nCounsel for Landis:Â  I havenâ€™t seen any Affidavit.Â  \r\n  Iâ€™m assuming you will be admitting it.\r\nState:Â  I thought you were given a copy.\r\nCounsel:Â  I donâ€™t think so.\r\nState:Â  That was done today.\r\nCounsel:Â  Oh, Okay.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .Â \r\nCounsel:Â  Thatâ€™s fine.Â  I just needed to see it.Â \r\n\r\nIndeed, Landis used the affidavit during cross-examination \r\n  of Trooper Davis.Â  And during the motion hearing, Landisâ€™ counsel requested \r\n  to enter the affidavit into evidence but decided to wait until trial to admit \r\n  the document.Â  \r\n\r\n   Counsel for Landis:Â  Can we put the Affidavit \r\n  in as an exhibit?\r\n The Court:Â  Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  State:Â  If counsel wants to put the Affidavit into \r\n  evidence in his trial, then (inaudible)\r\n  Counsel:Â  I think weâ€™re entitled to introduce that \r\n  at this time for the record on our motion.Â  It is not something thatâ€”\r\n   State:Â  You want to introduce it for purposes \r\n  in the motion?\r\n  Counsel:Â  Well, we need it for purposes of the motion, \r\n  but I guess we canâ€”weâ€™ll do it at trial.Â  Weâ€™ll hang on to it and just go ahead \r\n  and admit it during the trial itself.\r\n\r\nIn further refutation of Landisâ€™ argument, the \r\n  record discloses that not only was Landisâ€™ counsel in possession of Trooper \r\n  Davisâ€™ affidavit, but the court accepted counselâ€™s request to place the affidavit \r\n  into evidence.Â  Landisâ€™ counsel then decided not to enter the affidavit after \r\n  the court had given him permission to do so.Â  Although the statute does not \r\n  specify to whom the arresting officer should submit the affidavit, we hold that \r\n  whether the affidavit has been submitted is not an issue when it has undisputedly \r\n  been prepared and is in defense counselâ€™s possession at trial.Â  \r\nBased on the cited testimony and Trooper Davisâ€™ affidavit, \r\n  we hold the statutory requirements of section 56-5-2953(B) were satisfied. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, the order of the circuit court is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3905","title":"Paul Davis Systems v.

(â€œDavisâ€) sought to foreclose on a mechanicâ€™s lien against Deepwater of \r\n  Hilton Head (â€œDeepwaterâ€).Â  The trial judge directed Deepwaterâ€™s property be \r\n  sold to satisfy the mechanicâ€™s lien, but subsequently granted Deepwaterâ€™s motion \r\n  for relief from judgment and dismissed Deepwater as a party.Â  Davis asserts \r\n  the trial court erred in (1) granting Deepwaterâ€™s motion for relief from judgment \r\n  and (2) ruling upon defenses offered through a post-trial motion.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPursuant to a work authorization order \r\n  entered into on April 6, 1999, Davis agreed to perform certain subcontracting \r\n  services for Columbia Construction Services (â€œColumbiaâ€), a general contractor, \r\n  to make improvements to real property owned by Deepwater.Â  Though Deepwater \r\n  owned the property being renovated, Columbia had been retained as the projectâ€™s \r\n  general contractor by C.A. Muer Corporation (â€œMuerâ€).Â  Muer was leasing the \r\n  property from Deepwater for use as a seafood restaurant.Â Â  \r\nAt some point during the project, a dispute \r\n  arose between Davis and Columbia regarding payment for labor. Davis served a \r\n  notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien on Deepwater on September 28, 1999, \r\n  followed by service of a summons and complaint on October 4, 1999.Â  Davisâ€™s \r\n  complaint asserted a cause of action against Columbia for breach of contract \r\n  in which Davis sought damages of $37,721.00, and a separate claim for foreclosure \r\n  of a mechanicâ€™s lien against Deepwaterâ€™s real property.Â  Neither the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien nor the complaint was served on Muer or named Muer as a party.Â  However, \r\n  Deepwater provided a copy of the complaint to Muer and directed Muer to release \r\n  Deepwaterâ€™s property from the lien.Â  \r\nIn order to release the property from \r\n  the lien, Columbia, at Muerâ€™s request, posted a mechanicâ€™s lien bond dated October \r\n  28, 1999 in the amount of one and one-third times the amount claimed by Davis.Â  \r\n  Deepwater received a copy of a letter from Columbiaâ€™s attorney, Ann Marscher, \r\n  to Davisâ€™s attorney referencing attached unsigned copies of a discharge of mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien, cancellation of lis pendens, and a stipulation of dismissal \r\n  [1]  between Columbia and Davis and a copy of the bond to discharge the \r\n  construction lien filed with the Beaufort County Register of Deeds. \r\nAlthough Columbia answered Davisâ€™s complaint \r\n  by filing a general denial, Deepwater failed to respond to the complaint.Â  As \r\n  a consequence, Davis moved for an order of default against Deepwater and for \r\n  release of the bond.Â  Deepwater responded through attorney Marscher by filing \r\n  an answer and opposing Davisâ€™s default motion.Â  Although default had not been \r\n  entered against Deepwater at this point, Deepwater styled this motion as a motion \r\n  to set aside default based on Rule 55 and 60(b), arguing mistake, inadvertence, \r\n  or excusable neglect on the part of attorney Marscher. Marscher stated in her \r\n  affidavit that Deepwater failed to file an answer based on the mistaken belief \r\n  that Deepwater had been discharged upon the filing of the bond and based on \r\n  the mistaken impression that Davisâ€™s counsel would consent to the dismissal \r\n  of Deepwater. Â By order entered April 3, 2000, the trial court denied \r\n  Davisâ€™s motion for default and allowed Deepwater to answer as previously filed. \r\n  Â A subsequent answer to Davisâ€™s second amended complaint filed on behalf \r\n  of all defendants, including Deepwater, added as a defense that Deepwaterâ€™s \r\n  property had been discharged from the suit by the posting of the surety bond.Â  \r\n\r\nThe matter proceeded to a bench trial, and the judge entered an order awarding \r\n  Davis a total of $54,168.89 on the breach of contract claim.Â  Because the courtâ€™s \r\n  order made no mention of the mechanicâ€™s lien, Davis filed a motion to amend, \r\n  asking the court to authorize foreclosure on the lien against Deepwaterâ€™s property.Â  \r\n  The trial judge granted the motion through an order invalidating the surety \r\n  bond, finding that Deepwater failed to comply with the conditions of South Carolina \r\n  Code section 29-5-110 (Supp. 2003) for the discharge of a lien from real property \r\n  by the posting of a bond because the surety that executed the bond was not licensed \r\n  to do business in South Carolina.Â  The order also directed Deepwaterâ€™s property \r\n  be sold to satisfy Davisâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\nOn May 30, 2002, with the scheduled foreclosure \r\n  sale of its property mere days away, Deepwater filed an emergency motion asking \r\n  for relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP. [2] Â  Deepwater argued that it should be relieved \r\n  from the order entitling Davis to foreclose on the lien against its property \r\n  based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect pursuant to Rule \r\n  60(b)(1).Â  Deepwater asserted that it neither received nor was served with any \r\n  papers to put it on notice that an action was pending against it and never engaged \r\n  counsel because it reasonably relied on the copy of the letter from Marscher \r\n  to Davisâ€™s attorney referencing the discharge of mechanicâ€™s lien, cancellation \r\n  of lis pendens, stipulation of dismissal, and surety bond.Â  Deepwater further \r\n  argued it was denied an opportunity to represent its interests during the bench \r\n  trial because it reasonably believed it had been dismissed from the suit by \r\n  the surety bond filed by Columbia.Â  Deepwater also introduced its lease with \r\n  Muer and argued that because it was Muer rather than Deepwater that entered \r\n  into the construction contract with Columbia, Davisâ€™s lien should encumber Muerâ€™s \r\n  leasehold interest rather than the real property owned by Deepwater. \r\nBy order entered February 5, 2003, the \r\n  trial judge concluded the lack of a contractual relationship between Deepwater \r\n  and Davis precluded Davis from encumbering Deepwaterâ€™s real property with a \r\n  valid mechanicâ€™s lien. Â Â Having so concluded, the court dismissed Deepwater \r\n  from the suit and released its property from Davisâ€™s lien.Â  The court set aside \r\n  the previous award of attorneyâ€™s fees in Davisâ€™s favor based on the assertion \r\n  of the lien and permitted Deepwater to apply for costs and attorneyâ€™s fees incurred \r\n  in defending against Davisâ€™s lien.Â  Davis appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDavis contends the trial judge erred in \r\n  granting Deepwater relief based on excusable neglect and in considering and \r\n  ruling upon defenses available to Deepwater prior to trial but asserted only \r\n  by post-trial motion.Â  Deepwater alleges it was entitled to relief from the \r\n  judgment under Rule 60(b)(1) because although its interests were represented \r\n  by attorney Marscher, it was not aware that it was represented, never engaged \r\n  counsel, and reasonably believed it had been discharged from the lien.Â Â  We \r\n  disagree with Deepwater and reverse the decision of the trial judge.\r\nRule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, allows \r\n  a party to seek relief from a final judgment or order on the grounds of â€œmistake, \r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.â€Â  Relief under this section lies \r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. \r\n  116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1989).Â  â€œSuch an abuse arises when the judge \r\n  issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or when the order, based \r\n  upon factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id. at 119, \r\n  382 S.E.2d at 903.Â  It is incumbent upon the party seeking relief pursuant to \r\n  Rule 60(b)(1) to show the applicability of one of the qualifying grounds.Â  See \r\n  Williams v.

Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 452, 248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978) \r\n  (stating that this general rule is not applied where there has been a willful \r\n  and unilateral abandonment of the client by counsel).\r\nDeepwater attempts to circumvent the tenet \r\n  that Rule 60(b) relief is not available based on the failure of an attorney \r\n  to assert available defenses by explaining that it was unaware that Marscher \r\n  filed a motion and answer on its behalf.Â  However, whether Deepwater knew that \r\n  its interests were represented by Marscher is of little import considering Deepwaterâ€™s \r\n  unreasonable belief that it had been discharged from the case and its failure \r\n  to monitor the progress of the case.Â  See Goodson, 295 S.C. at \r\n  403, 368 S.E.2d at 689.Â  This is not a case of willful and unilateral abandonment \r\n  of the client by counsel in which we could refuse to apply the general rule \r\n  that the neglect of an attorney is the neglect of a client.Â  Cf.

Â Â \r\nWe find Marscherâ€™s failure to \r\n  interpose Deepwaterâ€™s contract defense at the time she answered on behalf of \r\n  Deepwater does not amount to â€œmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable \r\n  neglectâ€ warranting relief under Rule 60(b).Â  Further, we find Marscherâ€™s failure \r\n  attributable to Deepwater.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial judge erred in granting \r\n  Deepwater relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) and ruling on defenses readily \r\n  available to Deepwater prior to trial.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Copies of the discharge of mechanicâ€™s lien, cancellation \r\n    of lis pendens, and stipulation of dismissal do not appear in the record on \r\n    appeal. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Deepwaterâ€™s motion was captioned â€œNotice of Emergency Motion and \r\n    Emergency Motion for Stay and for Alternate Forms of Relief Pursuant to SCRCP \r\n    Rules 17, 19, 21, 59, 60, 62, 67 and Memorandum in Support of Motion.â€Â Â  The \r\n    motion ruled upon by the trial judge and relevant to this appeal is Deepwaterâ€™s \r\n    Rule 60(b) motion for relief from final judgment.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3906","title":"State v.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald \r\n  V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â Â Â Â  Christopher James appeals his convictions for possession \r\n  with intent to distribute crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute \r\n  crack cocaine within proximity of a school.Â  He contends the trial court erred \r\n  in denying his motion for a directed verdict given the State failed to produce \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence of the intent element.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 15, 2000, Corporal Tony Taylor, employed with the \r\n  Johnston Police Department, was patrolling the town when he observed James holding \r\n  an open container of beer.Â  Because James was in violation of the townâ€™s open \r\n  container ordinance, Taylor stopped his vehicle and approached James.Â  Taylor \r\n  then instructed James to put his hands on the patrol car so that he could conduct \r\n  a pat down for weapons.Â  During the pat down, Taylor felt something in Jamesâ€™s \r\n  left front pocket.Â  When questioned about the object, Taylor responded, â€œOh, \r\n  thatâ€™s my rag.â€Â  As James pulled the rag out of his pocket, Taylor observed \r\n  two small â€œzip-lockâ€ bags fall to the ground.Â  According to Taylor, one \r\n  bag was empty and the other bag contained what he believed to be eight to ten \r\n  rocks of crack cocaine.Â  A struggle ensued when both James and Taylor \r\n  reached for the bags.Â  James then broke free and absconded with the bag containing \r\n  the substance.Â  Unable to apprehend James at that time, Taylor returned to the \r\n  scene and retrieved the empty bag.Â  Drug analysis of the bag revealed that it \r\n  contained crack cocaine; however, there was no weight assigned to the substance \r\n  because it was essentially residue.Â  The second bag was never recovered.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAn Edgefield County grand jury indicted James for resisting arrest, possession \r\n  with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute \r\n  crack cocaine within proximity of a school.\r\nAt trial, Taylor recounted the incident for the jury.Â  He also testified extensively \r\n  as to why James was charged with possession with intent to distribute as opposed \r\n  to simple possession of crack cocaine.Â  For several reasons, Taylor believed \r\n  James intended to sell the crack cocaine rather than use it for his personal \r\n  consumption.Â  Taylor testified that dealers normally carry a large number of \r\n  crack cocaine rocks in a single bag.Â  He also stated that a dealer usually sells \r\n  an entire bag of crack cocaine before selling from other bags.Â  In contrast, \r\n  Taylor claimed that a crack cocaine addict normally carries only one rock of \r\n  crack cocaine.Â  Additionally, he testified an addict has a distinct, unhealthy \r\n  physical appearance.Â  Because James appeared in good health, had an empty bag \r\n  containing crack cocaine residue, and a bag full of what appeared to be crack \r\n  cocaine rocks, Taylor concluded that James intended to sell the crack cocaine.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\n\r\nJames did not testify at trial.Â  Two witnesses testified on Jamesâ€™s behalf.Â  \r\n  Naomi Coppinger, the mother of Jamesâ€™s children, testified that James was employed \r\n  and supported his family.Â  Shelby Still, an acquaintance of James, testified \r\n  she witnessed from her doorway the incident involving James and Taylor.Â  \r\n  Although Still corroborated most of Taylorâ€™s account of the incident, she \r\n  testified that she did not see any bags of drugs fall out of Jamesâ€™s pocket \r\n  when he pulled out the rag.Â  She also characterized the area as â€œdrug-infested,â€ \r\n  and acknowledged that bags containing drugs may have been on the ground.Â Â  \r\n  \r\nThe jury convicted James of resisting arrest, possession with intent to distribute \r\n  crack cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine within \r\n  proximity of a school.Â  The trial court sentenced James to time served for the \r\n  resisting arrest charge and ten years imprisonment for each of the drug charges.Â  \r\n  The sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  James appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nJames argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for \r\n  a directed verdict as to the drug charges.Â  He contends the State failed to \r\n  produce substantial circumstantial evidence that he possessed crack cocaine \r\n  with intent to distribute.Â  In conjunction with this contention, James asserts \r\n  the courtâ€™s failure to direct a verdict violated his Fourteenth Amendment right \r\n  to due process because the evidence was not sufficient to convince a rational \r\n  trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nAt trial, James moved for a directed verdict after the State \r\n  rested and at the close of the evidence.Â  In each of these motions, James \r\n  argued there was insufficient evidence to support the elements of the possession \r\n  with intent to distribute charges.Â  The court denied these motions.Â  Although \r\n  the court acknowledged there was no evidence as to the weight of the crack cocaine, \r\n  it found the State had presented circumstantial evidence to support the charges.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\n\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case, \r\n  a trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  \r\n  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 321, 555 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2001).Â  The \r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not \r\n  its weight.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  \r\n  â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce \r\n  evidence of the offense charged.â€Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, \r\n  544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  Furthermore, the court should not refuse to grant \r\n  the directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that \r\n  the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  126, 127 (2000).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this court must \r\n  view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 \r\n  (1999).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n  reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case \r\n  was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, \r\n  349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).\r\nSection 44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code â€œcreates a \r\n  permissive inference that possession of more than one gram of crack cocaine \r\n  constitutes possession with intent to distribute.Â  However, a conviction of \r\n  possession with intent to distribute does not hinge upon the amount involved.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the statute does not mandate a reverse inference or presumption \r\n  for amounts less than one gram.â€Â  State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 223, \r\n  543 S.E.2d 249, 250 (Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) \r\n  (2002).Â  Possession of any amount of controlled substance coupled with sufficient \r\n  indicia of intent to distribute will support a conviction for possession with \r\n  intent to distribute.Â  Matthews v. State, 300 S.C. 238, 239, 387 S.E.2d \r\n  258, 259 (1990).\r\nAs a threshold matter, the State asserts James did not properly \r\n  preserve this issue for appellate review.Â  Specifically, the State contends \r\n  James did not explicitly argue the State failed to produce â€œsubstantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence that he possessed cocaine with intent to distribute.â€\r\nWe agree with the Stateâ€™s assertion with respect to Jamesâ€™s \r\n  Fourteenth Amendment argument.Â  At trial, James moved to exclude the crack cocaine \r\n  evidence on the ground the weapons pat down and subsequent seizure of the drugs \r\n  violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.Â  In a separate and subsequent \r\n  argument, James moved for a directed verdict without referencing the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment.Â  Even if Jamesâ€™s post-verdict motion could be construed to encompass \r\n  a Fourteenth Amendment challenge regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, \r\n  such an argument was untimely and did not preserve the argument for our review.Â  \r\n  See Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 338, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  862, 865, 866 (2001) (stating issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial \r\n  court will not be considered on appeal); State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, \r\n  113, 485 S.E.2d 360, 363 (1997) (recognizing party may not argue one ground \r\n  at trial and another on appeal); State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 455, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 214, 221 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  837 (1999) (â€œ[I]ssues not raised to the trial court in support of the directed \r\n  verdict motion are not preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nDespite the failure to preserve the Fourteenth Amendment issue, \r\n  we find James properly raised the sufficiency of the evidence argument to the \r\n  trial court.Â  Although James did not use the term â€œsubstantial circumstantial \r\n  evidenceâ€ in his motion for a directed verdict, he argued there was insufficient \r\n  evidence to support the elements of the charge of possession with intent to \r\n  distribute.Â  Moreover, it is apparent from the trial courtâ€™s ruling that this \r\n  ground was the basis for the motion.Â  Significantly, the court informed the \r\n  parties that it would instruct the jury â€œthat they have to find the intent to \r\n  distribute has been proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt, and there \r\n  would be a lesser included offense of possession of crack cocaine.â€Â  Thus, \r\n  we find the argument is properly before this court.Â  Cf. State v. \r\n  Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 132, 546 S.E.2d 202, 204 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding \r\n  argument that defendant was entitled to a directed verdict on the ground the \r\n  State failed to establish the corpus deliciti of DUI was preserved \r\n  even though the defendant did not use the exact words where the ground for the \r\n  motion was apparent from a review of the record).\r\nWe now analyze the merits of Jamesâ€™s appeal.Â  Clearly, the \r\n  evidence was sufficient to prove James possessed crack cocaine.Â  The State contends \r\n  it proved the intent to distribute element based on Officer Taylorâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  James was observed in an area known for â€œhigh crimeâ€ and â€œhigh-narcotics trafficking.â€Â  \r\n  He had in his possession one â€œzip-lockâ€ bag bulging with what appeared to be \r\n  eight to ten crack cocaine rocks and one empty â€œzip-lockâ€ bag that tested positive \r\n  for crack cocaine residue.Â  Officer Taylor testified dealers normally carry \r\n  a large number of crack cocaine rocks and sell from one â€œzip-lockâ€ bag before \r\n  selling from other bags.Â  In contrast, a crack cocaine addict usually carries \r\n  only one rock of crack.Â  Furthermore, unlike an addict, James appeared healthy.Â  \r\n  Based on these characteristics, Officer Taylor believed James intended to sell \r\n  the crack cocaine because he fit the profile of a drug dealer as opposed to \r\n  a drug user or addict.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, \r\n  as we are required to do, we find this evidence was insufficient to submit to \r\n  the jury the possession with intent to distribute charges.Â  In doing so, we \r\n  must distinguish the instant case from two recent decisions of this court, Cherry \r\n  and Robinson, which at least facially appear to be dispositive.Â  State \r\n  v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 559 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2001) (en banc), \r\n  affâ€™d in result, Op. No. 25902 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 29, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 46 at 24), and State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  249 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nIn Cherry, the defendant was a passenger in a vehicle \r\n  stopped for a traffic violation.Â  When an officer searched Cherry for weapons, \r\n  he discovered a small bag containing approximately eight rocks of crack cocaine \r\n  in his watch pocket.Â  He also seized $322 in cash from Cherry.Â  Cherry was convicted \r\n  of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.Â  As one of the issues \r\n  raised on appeal, Cherry challenged the trial courtâ€™s failure to grant his motion \r\n  for a directed verdict.Â  Because there was no evidence that he intended to distribute \r\n  the crack cocaine, Cherry asserted the charge should not have been submitted \r\n  to the jury.Â  This court, in a divided en banc decision, affirmed \r\n  Cherryâ€™s conviction.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State without weighing it, the majority opinion found the following evidence \r\n  justified the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny Cherryâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict:Â  (1) Cherry was arrested in high crime area known for violence and \r\n  drug activity; (2) Cherry had in his possession a small bag containing eight \r\n  rocks of crack cocaine; (3) he had no drug paraphernalia with him indicating \r\n  the crack cocaine was for his personal consumption; (4) he had $322 in cash, \r\n  in mostly twenty dollar bills; and (5) a single rock of crack cocaine typically \r\n  sold for twenty dollars.Â  Cherry, 348 S.C. at 285, 559 S.E.2d at 299.\r\nIn Robinson, law enforcement observed Robinson enter \r\n  a business that was the focal point of a six-month drug investigation.Â  When \r\n  Robinson left the establishment, an officer approached him.Â  Robinson charged \r\n  the officer and threw his hand up in the air.Â  The officer saw a black plastic \r\n  bag fly from Robinsonâ€™s hand.Â  The bag contained seven rocks of crack cocaine \r\n  with an assigned weight of 0.9 grams.Â  As a result, Robinson was charged with \r\n  possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and a related proximity charge.Â  \r\n  Because the amount of crack cocaine was less than the statutory amount triggering \r\n  the permissible inference of intent to distribute, the State relied solely on \r\n  expert testimony from officers regarding the distinction between a drug dealer \r\n  and a user of crack cocaine.Â  The officers testified that a user would normally \r\n  not have more than one or two rocks in his possession.Â  Additionally, one officer \r\n  testified that he would expect that a dealer would have crack cocaine packaged \r\n  as it was by Robinson.Â  Based on this testimony, we found there was sufficient \r\n  evidence of Robinsonâ€™s intent to distribute to withstand a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict.Â  Robinson, 344 S.C. at 224, 543 S.E.2d at 250.\r\nAnalyzing the facts of this case, we conclude the indicia of \r\n  intent relied upon by the State is considerably weaker than that presented in \r\n  either Cherry or Robinson and, thus, insufficient to support the \r\n  charged offenses.Â  Although James was observed in a â€œhigh-narcotics traffickingâ€ \r\n  area, he was initially detained for an open container violation in an area near \r\n  his home.Â  In contrast to Robinson, there was no testimony that James \r\n  was engaged in a drug transaction or that he was under surveillance for dealing \r\n  drugs.Â  There was, however, testimony that James was employed and supported \r\n  his family.Â  Furthermore, unlike the defendant in Cherry, James did not \r\n  have large amounts of cash, but instead, only had $37 on his person.Â  As to \r\n  the amount of crack cocaine possessed by James, the evidence was speculative.Â  \r\n  The â€œbulgingâ€ bag of crack cocaine, which the State primarily relied on to establish \r\n  the intent element, was never recovered for evidentiary testing as in Robinson \r\n  and Cherry.Â  Officer Taylor also was not entirely clear as to how many \r\n  rocks, of what he believed to be crack cocaine, were contained in the bag.Â  \r\n  He admitted that he only saw the bag briefly on the ground before the struggle \r\n  ensued with James.Â  Finally, Jamesâ€™s healthy appearance was not conclusive as \r\n  to whether he was a drug dealer.Â  Instead, it could also have raised the inference \r\n  that he was not a long-term user of crack cocaine.Â  Based on the foregoing, \r\n  we find the entirely circumstantial evidence in this case was not substantial \r\n  and merely raised a suspicion that James intended to distribute crack cocaine.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we hold the trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict on the \r\n  possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine charge as well as the related \r\n  proximity charge.Â  \r\nAccordingly, Jamesâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nREVERSED. [1] \r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  We recognize that our supreme court has recently \r\n    ruled that when a conviction is reversed due to insufficient evidence, an \r\n    appellate court may remand the case for sentencing on the lesser-included \r\n    offense.Â Â  We, however, choose not to do so in this case given the State has \r\n    not made such a request.Â  Moreover, although the trial court indicated it \r\n    would charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession of crack \r\n    cocaine, the courtâ€™s charge to the jury was not included as part of the record \r\n    on appeal.Â  Thus, it is unclear whether the jury considered the lesser-included \r\n    offense.Â  See State v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 597-98, 602 S.E.2d \r\n    392, 401 (2004) (holding that when a conviction is reversed due to insufficient \r\n    evidence, an appellate court will consider remanding a case for sentencing \r\n    on a lesser-included offense only when:Â  (1) the evidence adduced at trial \r\n    fails to support one or more elements of the crime of which appellant was \r\n    convicted; (2) the jury was explicitly instructed it could find the defendant \r\n    guilty of the lesser-included offense and was properly instructed on the elements \r\n    of that offense; (3) the record on appeal contains sufficient evidence supporting \r\n    each element of the lesser-included offense; (4) the State seeks a sentencing \r\n    remand on appeal; (5) the defendant will not be unduly or unfairly prejudiced; \r\n    and (6) the Court is convinced justice will be served by such a result after \r\n    carefully considering the record as well as the interests and concerns of \r\n    the both the defendant and the victim of the crime).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3907","title":"Pack v.

Pack, III, as co-personal representatives of the Estate of Tracy B. Pack \r\n  (the Estate), appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order granting partial summary judgment \r\n  to Associated Marine Institutes, Inc. (AMI), Rimini Marine Institute, Inc. (RMI), \r\n  and four Rimini employees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn August 1999, juveniles Jon Smart and \r\n  Stephen Hutto were in the custody of the South Carolina Department of Juvenile \r\n  Justice (DJJ).Â  They boarded at RMI, a residential rehabilitation facility for \r\n  juveniles in the custody of DJJ. [1] \r\nPrior to Smartâ€™s placement at RMI, DJJ screened \r\n  him under its eligibility guidelines, classified him as a non-violent offender, \r\n  and determined he was fit for placement at RMI although Smartâ€™s DJJ record indicated \r\n  he had a history of substance abuse that included becoming intoxicated from \r\n  inhaling paint and gasoline fumes, a practice commonly called â€œhuffing.â€Â  Barney \r\n  Gadson, RMIâ€™s Director of Operations, testified he had reviewed Smartâ€™s DJJ \r\n  records, and was aware that Smart had a problem with becoming violent after \r\n  huffing.Â  Gadson and Smartâ€™s team leader, Robert McCray, tested Smart to determine \r\n  if his purported huffing addiction was true by making gasoline accessible to \r\n  him. Â After Smart attempted to steal the gas, he received counseling and RMI \r\n  employees took precautions to restrict his access to fuel kept on campus.Â  On \r\n  August 11, 1999, Smart huffed gas he stole from a generator while on work furlough.Â  \r\n  When his counselor, Thaddeus Chestnut, confronted him about the odor of gasoline \r\n  on his person, Smart denied huffing and claimed he smelled of gas from working \r\n  on the generator.Â  \r\nThe following day, Tracy Pack obtained permission \r\n  from RMI to have Smart and Hutto leave the RMI campus to work at his chicken \r\n  houses.Â  Pack was a former employee of RMI who allowed juveniles from the Rimini \r\n  facility to work off-campus with him at his familyâ€™s nearby poultry farm and \r\n  boat landing. Â Once there, Smart became intoxicated by huffing gasoline \r\n  he had secretly funneled from Packâ€™s truck.Â  Smart subsequently bludgeoned Pack \r\n  to death.Â  Smart and Hutto then stole Packâ€™s truck and went on a crime spree \r\n  before police apprehended them.Â  \r\nThe Estate brought survival and wrongful \r\n  death actions against AMI and RMI, arguing AMI failed to properly monitor RMI.Â  \r\n  It further alleged that RMI was negligent in its supervision of Smart and Hutto, \r\n  and should have discovered and warned Pack of the boysâ€™ violent propensities.Â  \r\n\r\nAMI and RMI made a motion for partial summary \r\n  judgment, arguing they were entitled to statutory limitations on liability under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-56-180 (Supp. 2003), because both corporations qualified \r\n  as charitable organizations.Â  The circuit court agreed, and partially granted \r\n  their motions.Â  \r\nThe Estate then filed a complaint in United \r\n  States District Court alleging DJJ, AMI, and RMI violated Tracy Packâ€™s civil \r\n  rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  It also amended its complaints in state \r\n  court, adding nine RMI employees and DJJ as defendants.Â  \r\nThe parties later agreed to voluntarily \r\n  dismiss the federal action without prejudice.Â  Consequently, the Estate reasserted \r\n  its federal civil rights claims against all defendants in state court.Â  Following \r\n  discovery, the Estate voluntarily dismissed all claims against four of the employees. \r\n  [2] Â  The circuit court also granted DJJâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  The remaining defendants, including AMI, RMI and four RMI employees, each filed \r\n  motions for summary judgment on all causes of action.Â  \r\nThe circuit court denied summary judgment \r\n  to AMI and RMI on the Estateâ€™s wrongful death and survival claims.Â  However, \r\n  it granted summary judgment in favor of individual RMI employees on both negligence \r\n  claims, finding they were entitled to qualified immunity pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 33-56-180.Â  The court also granted all defendants summary judgment on \r\n  the Estateâ€™s federal civil rights cause of action, finding â€œthat even if an \r\n  unconstitutional â€˜custom or practiceâ€™ can be shown by the [Estate] in this case, \r\n  the â€˜deliberate indifferenceâ€™ standard cannot be met.â€Â  To support its conclusion, \r\n  the court relied on White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731, 737 (4th Cir. 1997), \r\n  which held â€œ[a] claim of deliberate indifference, unlike one of negligence, \r\n  implies at a minimum that the defendants were plainly placed on notice of a \r\n  danger and chose to ignore the danger notwithstanding the notice.â€Â  \r\nThe Estate filed a motion to amend the judgment, \r\n  requesting the trial court rule on its claim that application of the â€œstate \r\n  created dangerâ€ doctrine supported a finding RMI violated 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  \r\n  The circuit court denied the motion, finding the evidence failed to prove RMI \r\n  created the danger that led to Tracy Packâ€™s death.Â  It also stated â€œ[e]ven if \r\n  the Court determined that Tracy Pack has a substantive due process right to \r\n  be protected by the defendants, the absence of deliberate indifference prevents \r\n  Â§ 1983 from being an available remedy.â€ Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen we review an order granting summary judgment, the court of appeals\r\napplies the same standard that governs the circuit courts pursuant to Rule 56,\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp; Summary judgment is proper\r\nwhen there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Lanham\r\nv. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 361-62, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333\r\n(2002).&nbsp; In making our determination whether any triable issues of\r\nfact exist, we will view the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp;\r\nId.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nClaims Against Individual RMI Employees\r\n  The Estate contends the circuit court erred \r\n  by granting summary judgment in favor of individual RMI employees on its wrongful \r\n  death and survival claims, arguing evidence in the record created numerous genuine \r\n  issues of material fact whether four of the employees acted in a grossly negligent \r\n  manner.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-56-180(A) (Supp. 2003) \r\n  states, in relevant part: \r\n\r\nAn action against the charitable organization pursuant to this \r\n  section constitutes a complete bar to any recovery by the claimant, by reason \r\n  of the same subject matter, against the employee of the charitable organization \r\n  whose act or omission gave rise to the claim unless it is alleged and proved \r\n  in the action that the employee acted in a reckless, wilful, or grossly negligent \r\n  manner[.]\r\n\r\nHere, the circuit courtâ€™s unappealed finding \r\n  that AMI and RMI qualified as charitable organizations is the law of the case.Â  \r\n  In re:Â  Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 371, 468 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1996) (stating \r\n  an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  Moreover, the Estate does not \r\n  allege on appeal that RMI employees were either reckless or willful.Â  Thus, \r\n  pursuant to section 33-56-180(A), the Estate is statutorily barred from recovering \r\n  against an individual RMI employee on its wrongful death and survival claims \r\n  unless it can show the employee acted in a grossly negligent manner. \r\nSection 33-56-180 does not define what it \r\n  means to act in a grossly negligent manner.Â  However, our supreme court has \r\n  defined gross negligence in the context of liability by a government entity \r\n  to mean \r\n\r\nthe intentional conscious failure to do something which it is \r\n  incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought \r\n  not to do.Â  It is the failure to exercise slight care.Â  Gross negligence has \r\n  also been defined as a relative term, and means the absence of care that is \r\n  necessary under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nJinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. \r\n  341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003) (internal citations omitted). \r\n  [3] Â  â€œAdditionally, while gross negligence ordinarily is a mixed question \r\n  of law and fact when the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, the \r\n  question becomes a matter of law for the court.â€Â  Etheredge v. Richland Sch. \r\n  Dist. One, 341 S.C. 307, 310, 534 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2000).Â  \r\nThe Estate makes numerous allegations of \r\n  gross negligence against individual RMI employees arguing evidence contained \r\n  in the record creates genuine issues of material fact sufficient to overcome \r\n  summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment \r\n  after determining RMI employees acted with at least slight care in carrying \r\n  out their duties.Â  On appeal, the Estateâ€™s argument is essentially that the \r\n  employees were grossly negligent because they failed to do more to address Smartâ€™s \r\n  behavior problems or prevent Smart and Hutto from participating in off-campus \r\n  work furloughs on Packâ€™s farm.Â  The fact that more might have been done does \r\n  not negate a finding that RMI employees exercised at least slight care.Â  See \r\n  Etheredge, 341 S.C. at 311-12, 534 S.E.2d at 277-78 (holding that where \r\n  defendant had no knowledge of animosity between students, and principal and \r\n  security monitored hallways, the fact that school district might have done more \r\n  did not negate the fact it exercised slight care for purposes of determining \r\n  whether gross negligence exception to Tort Claims Act was applicable).\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the Estate, we agree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that individual RMI \r\n  employees exercised at least slight care in their supervision and control of \r\n  Smart and Hutto.Â  As such, we conclude there are no genuine issues of material \r\n  fact that would prevent the award of summary judgment.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n  II.Â Â Â Â Â  Federal Civil Rights Claims Against AMI and RMI \r\nThe Estate contends that AMI and RMI displayed \r\n  deliberate indifference for Packâ€™s safety, and thus the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment on its 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn unappealled ruling of the circuit court \r\n  determined that AMI and RMI qualify as state actors.Â  Therefore, both corporations \r\n  may be liable for violating Tracy Packâ€™s civil rights if the Estate can show \r\n  each had knowledge of an unconstitutional custom or practice, and failed, as \r\n  a matter of specific intent or deliberate indifference, to correct or stop it.Â  \r\n  See Spell v. McDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380, 1391 (4th Cir 1987) (holding \r\n  a municipality is at fault for allowing a widespread unconstitutional practice \r\n  or custom to continue if (1) responsible policymakers have actual or constructive \r\n  knowledge of its existence, and (2) it fails thereafter, as a matter of specific \r\n  intent or deliberate indifference, to correct or stop the practice).Â  \r\nTo support its Â§ 1983 claims against the \r\n  corporations, the Estate reasserts essentially the same allegations it relied \r\n  on as evidence of individual employeesâ€™ gross negligence. [4] Â  We note that even had the Estate proven individual \r\n  RMI employees acted in a grossly negligent manner, they cannot predicate their \r\n  1983 claim on the employeesâ€™ behavior alone.Â  See Monell v. Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 692-94 (1978) (holding a state actor cannot \r\n  be held liable under Section 1983 on a respondeat superior theory).Â  Unless \r\n  the Estate can show AMI and RMI acted with deliberate indifference in monitoring \r\n  Smart and permitting the work furloughs to continue and the practices made Packâ€™s \r\n  murder â€œalmost bound to happen,â€ its constitutional claim fails as a matter \r\n  of law.Â  See Spell, 824 F.2d at 1390 (holding a plaintiff must \r\n  prove the failure to correct or stop the offending practice must make the specific \r\n  violation â€œalmost bound to happen, sooner or laterâ€ rather than merely â€œlikely \r\n  to happen in the long runâ€ to sustain a section 1983 claim); see also \r\n  Jensen v. Conrad, 570 F.Supp. 114, 122 (D.S.C. 1983) (â€œIn defining the \r\n  concept of deliberate indifference, it is important to recognize that although \r\n  it is closely associated with gross negligence, there is a significant distinction. \r\n  In essence, gross negligence is the breach of reasonable standards of conduct \r\n  posing obvious dangers to others while deliberate indifference involves a knowing \r\n  lack of regard or concern for the safety of others.â€) (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nRMI accepted Smart only after DJJ screened \r\n  him under its eligibility guidelines, classified him as a non-violent offender, \r\n  and determined he was fit for placement.Â  RMIâ€™s staff monitored Smartâ€™s huffing \r\n  addiction and took appropriate steps to counsel him and restrict his access \r\n  to gasoline on campus.Â  Prior to the murder, Smart and Hutto had participated \r\n  in work furloughs without incident and had regularly worked with Tracy Pack \r\n  at the poultry farm.Â  Although he later admitted to stealing gas and huffing \r\n  while at the farm and boat landing, Smart acknowledged he did so secretly and \r\n  lied to his counselors when questioned about the odor of gas on his person.Â  \r\n  On the day of his murder, Tracy Pack himself specifically requested Smart and \r\n  Hutto for work furlough on his farm.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to the Estate, we cannot say AMI and RMI knowingly disregarded Tracy \r\n  Packâ€™s safety or that their decision to continue the practice of work furloughs \r\n  made Packâ€™s murder almost bound to happen.Â  Absent a showing of such deliberate \r\n  indifference, the Estateâ€™s section 1983 claims fail.\r\nThe Estate also raises section 1983 claims \r\n  against RMI based on an alleged failure to train employees to follow an internal \r\n  guideline governing the supervision of juveniles.Â  Assuming the Estateâ€™s allegations \r\n  of a failure to train are true, it still must show AMI and RMI acted with deliberate \r\n  indifference to survive section 1983 scrutiny.Â  Since we have determined the \r\n  Estate failed to make such a showing, we find this argument unpersuasive.Â  \r\nFinally, the Estate contends a theory of \r\n  liability referred to as the â€œstate created dangerâ€ doctrine supports 1983 liability \r\n  arguing AMI and RMI created the danger that led to Packâ€™s death by not taking \r\n  affirmative action to end off-campus work furloughs.Â  The Estate urges us to \r\n  adopt a four-part test created by the United States Court of Appeals for the \r\n  Third Circuit, which is used to prove a due process violation under the doctrine.Â  \r\n  See Kneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d 1199 (3d Cir. 1996) (establishing \r\n  a four-part test for proving a section 1983 claim under the â€œstate created dangerâ€ \r\n  doctrine).Â  We decline to do so.Â  \r\nOur state supreme court has not adopted \r\n  the four-part Kneipp test nor, insofar as we can tell, has it ever recognized \r\n  or even discussed the â€œstate created dangerâ€ doctrine in relation to a section \r\n  1983 action.Â  We prefer, instead, to be guided by the analysis employed by the \r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in a case similar to Kneipp and to the \r\n  one at bar.Â  In addressing the issue of whether a plaintiff may claim liability \r\n  under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 based on an affirmative duty theory, the court, in Pinder \r\n  v. Johnson, 54 F.3d 1169, 1174 (4th Cir. 1995) recognized:\r\n\r\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require \r\n  governmental actors to affirmatively protect life, liberty, or property against \r\n  intrusion by private third parties.Â  Instead, the Due Process Clause works only \r\n  as a negative prohibition on state action.Â  â€˜Its purpose was to protect the \r\n  people from the State, not to ensure that the State protected them from each \r\n  other.â€™\r\n\r\nTo support its conclusion, the court quoted \r\n  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196-97 \r\n  (1989), wherein the Supreme Court of the United States held:\r\n\r\n[i]f the Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide \r\n  its citizens with particular protective services, it follows that the State \r\n  cannot be held liable under the Clause for injuries that could have been averted \r\n  had it chosen to provide them.Â  As a general matter, then, we conclude that \r\n  a Stateâ€™s failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does \r\n  not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The affirmative duty of protection rejected by the United States Supreme Court \r\n  in DeShaney and the Fourth Circuit in Pinder is precisely the \r\n  duty the Estate relies on in this case.Â  The Estate argues RMI and AMI could \r\n  have, and thus should have, acted to prevent Smart and Huttoâ€™s crimes.Â  However, \r\n  DeShaney makes clear that no affirmative duty exists in these circumstances. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  Estate, we find RMI employees exercised at least slight care in the performance \r\n  of their duties and are entitled to qualified immunity from liability pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. section 33-56-180 (Supp. 2003).Â  Because the Estate failed \r\n  to prove AMI and RMI acted with deliberate indifference in maintaining the practice \r\n  of off-campus work furloughs, training their employees, and addressing Smartâ€™s \r\n  huffing addiction, its federal civil rights claims predicated on those allegations \r\n  must fail.Â  Finally, we conclude AMI and RMIâ€™s alleged failure to protect Pack \r\n  against the violent acts of Smart and Hutto does not constitute a violation \r\n  of the Due Process Clause.Â  Therefore the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    RMI operates the facility pursuant to a contract between its parent, AMI, \r\n    and DJJ.Â  RMI was responsible for the day-to-day operation of the facility.Â  \r\n    AMI is a charitable corporation organized under the laws of Florida specializing \r\n    in the operation of residential and day programs for troubled youth.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    A fifth employee, Thaddeus Chestnut, was named as a defendant and was served \r\n    by publication.Â  We find no evidence in the record that Chestnut filed an \r\n    answer or motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order granting summary \r\n    judgment to â€œRMI Employeesâ€ does not refer to any specific individual.Â  Therefore, \r\n    Chestnutâ€™s status in this case is unclear to this court.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    The Estate argues each sentence of the Jinks standard is an independent \r\n    definition of gross negligence.Â  It also asserts this courtâ€™s definition of \r\n    gross negligence as â€œa conscious failure to exercise due careâ€ in Jackson \r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrs., 301 S.C. 125, 390 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 1989) \r\n    constitutes a fourth meaning to permit a finding of gross negligence even \r\n    when there is evidence a defendant exercised slight care.Â  We disagree and \r\n    read the definition in Jinks as a single, comprehensive standard for \r\n    proving gross negligence requiring a determination whether a defendant exercised \r\n    at least slight care.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  The contention is (1) the practice of permitting off-campus work furloughs \r\n    without adequate supervision, (2) failure to train and instruct employees \r\n    on the internal policy requiring supervision, and (3) failing to respond to \r\n    knowledge of Smartâ€™s huffing addiction and his behavioral history, all directly \r\n    resulted in the unconstitutional deprivation of Tracy Packâ€™s right to life. \r\n    Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3908","title":"Elliott v.

Crosland, Jr., of Charleston, for Appellant. \r\nSamuel Thompson Brunson, of Florence, for Respondents.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Katherine Elliott appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming \r\n  the workersâ€™ compensation commissionâ€™s decision to calculate her average weekly \r\n  wage without including her earned salary increase.Â  We reverse and remand. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nElliott was employed by the South Carolina Department of Transportation as \r\n  a Trade Specialist II, earning an annual salary of $19,253.Â  After she obtained \r\n  her commercial driverâ€™s license, she earned a five percent salary increase that \r\n  was effective September 17, 2000.Â  On September 28, 2000, Elliott was injured \r\n  in a work-related activity.Â  \r\nElliott filed for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, arguing her five percent \r\n  pay increase constituted an â€œexceptional reasonâ€ for departing from the standard \r\n  method used to calculate the compensation rate.Â  The standard calculation is \r\n  based upon a claimantâ€™s fifty-two weeks of earnings immediately preceding the \r\n  date of injury. Â The single commissioner utilized the standard method to establish \r\n  Elliottâ€™s rate of compensation, excluding her wage increase.Â  The majority of \r\n  the full commission affirmed.Â  However, in a dissenting opinion, one of the \r\n  commissioners concluded Elliottâ€™s salary increase was extraordinary, and fairness \r\n  required its inclusion in calculating her average weekly wage to more appropriately \r\n  reflect her future earning capacity.Â  The circuit court affirmed the decision \r\n  of the majority of the full commission.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nElliott contends the circuit court erred as a matter of law \r\n  by affirming the decision of the full commission, arguing her five percent salary \r\n  increase qualifies as an â€œexceptional reasonâ€ to recalculate her average weekly \r\n  wage to most nearly approximate the amount she would have been earning but for \r\n  her injury.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act governs our review of the decisions of the \r\n  South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  We will not weigh the evidence \r\n  or substitute our judgment for that of the full commission on questions of fact. \r\n  Â However, we may reverse or modify the commissionâ€™s decision when a claimantâ€™s \r\n  substantial rights are prejudiced because of an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).\r\nAlthough the parties agreed to stipulated facts before the full commission, \r\n  there is nothing in the record to suggest they stipulated whether Elliottâ€™s \r\n  pay increase qualified as an â€œexceptional reasonâ€ to depart from the standard \r\n  wage calculation employed by the single commissioner.Â  We also recognize the \r\n  full commission acting as fact-finder found Elliottâ€™s average weekly wage did \r\n  not include her pay increase.Â  However, their finding is not dispositive.Â  The \r\n  determination of whether Elliottâ€™s raise constitutes an â€œexceptional reasonâ€ \r\n  for purposes of applying the standard wage calculation method provided by the \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is a question of law.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (Supp. 2003) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\nâ€œAverage weekly wagesâ€ \r\n  means the earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was \r\n  working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately \r\n  preceding the date of injury, . . . \r\nWhen for exceptional \r\n  reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such \r\n  other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most \r\n  nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were \r\n  it not for the injury. \r\n\r\nThe Workerâ€™s Compensation Act is remedial legislation enacted to protect the \r\n  worker.Â  Therefore, the statute is given a broad construction in order to accomplish \r\n  that end.Â  Booth v. Midland Trane Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, 289 \r\n  S.C. 251, 254, 379 S.E.2d 730, 731 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œThe statute provides an \r\n  elasticity or flexibility with a view toward always achieving the ultimate objective \r\n  of reflecting fairly a claimantâ€™s probable future earning loss.â€Â  Sellers \r\n  v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 698 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  Moreover, it is well established that the objective of wage calculation \r\n  is to arrive at a fair approximation of the claimantâ€™s probable future earning \r\n  capacity.Â  Disability reaches into the future, not the past; loss as a result \r\n  of the injury must be thought of in terms of its impact on probable future earnings.Â  \r\n  Bennett v. Gary Smith Builders, 271 S.C. 94, 98-99, 245 S.E.2d 129, 131 \r\n  (1978).\r\nElliott earned her pay increase by voluntarily pursuing special \r\n  certification and licensing.Â  The additional pay was a merit-based reward given \r\n  in recognition of her efforts to obtain a commercial driverâ€™s license, and was \r\n  not merely a standard cost-of-living increase or step increase based on longevity \r\n  of service.Â  In addition, the raise was not speculative, but was an established, \r\n  guaranteed amount already in place at the time of the accident.Â  While the increase \r\n  in pay is small, the amount of the raise is not the factor that determines whether \r\n  it is an exceptional reason for recalculating the average weekly wage.Â  The \r\n  inclusion of the increase in salary will, in the words of the statute, â€œmost \r\n  nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were \r\n  it not for the injury.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nWe therefore conclude Elliottâ€™s earned pay increase qualifies \r\n  as an â€œexceptional reasonâ€ to recalculate her average weekly wage.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand this case to the full \r\n  commission with directions to recalculate Elliottâ€™s average weekly wage including \r\n  the five percent pay raise.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.

A law enforcement \r\n  officer presented Jordan with a preprinted â€œAdvisement of Implied Consent Rightsâ€ \r\n  form issued by SLED.Â  This form sets forth three separate advisements: a â€œDUI \r\n  Advisement,â€ a â€œFelony DUI Advisement,â€ and a â€œZero Tolerance Advisement.â€ The \r\n  law enforcement officer executing the form must check the box next to the appropriate \r\n  advisement.Â  In this case, the officer checked the box for the standard â€œDUI \r\n  Advisement.â€Â  This advisement reads, in its entirety:\r\n\r\nSubject Advised/Informed in Writing: You are under arrest \r\n  for Driving Under the Influence, Section 56-5-2930, South Carolina Code of Laws \r\n  1976, as amended.Â  The arresting officer has directed that [breath, blood, \r\n  urine (CIRCLE ONE)] samples be taken for alcohol and/or drug testing.Â  The \r\n  samples will be taken and tested according to Section 56-5-2950 and South Carolina \r\n  Law Enforcement Division procedures.Â  You do not have to take the tests or give \r\n  the samples.Â  If you are 21 years old or older and you refuse to submit to the \r\n  tests or give the samples, your privilege to drive in South Carolina must be \r\n  suspended or denied for at least ninety days and your refusal may be used against \r\n  you in court.Â  If you are 21 years old or older and take the tests or give the \r\n  samples and have an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent \r\n  or more, your privilege to drive in South Carolina must be suspended for at \r\n  least thirty days.Â  Pursuant to Section 56-1-286, if you are under 21 years \r\n  old and refuse to submit to the tests or give the samples, your privilege to \r\n  drive in South Carolina must be suspended or denied for at least six months \r\n  for breath/blood refusals [ninety days for urine refusals] and your refusal \r\n  may be used against you in court.Â  Pursuant to Section 56-1-286, if you are \r\n  under 21 years old and take the tests or give the samples and have an alcohol \r\n  concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent or more, your privilege to \r\n  drive in South Carolina must be suspended for at least three months.Â  You have \r\n  the right to have a qualified person of your own choosing conduct additional \r\n  independent tests at your expense and the officer must provide you affirmative \r\n  assistance upon request.Â  You have the right to request an administrative hearing \r\n  within ten days of the issuance of the notice of suspension.Â  You must enroll \r\n  in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program within ten days of the issuance \r\n  of the notice of suspension.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  The officer advising Jordan of his implied consent \r\n  rights failed to indicate on the advisement form the type of test to be administered \r\n  by circling or otherwise designating whether a â€œbreath,â€ â€œblood,â€ or â€œurineâ€ \r\n  sample would be requested from Jordan.Â  Jordan was given a copy of the advisement \r\n  form, and he consented to a breath test.Â  Evidence from the suppression hearing \r\n  revealed that Jordan was informed a breath test would be offered.\r\nIn pre-trial proceedings, \r\n  Jordan moved to exclude the results of the test, arguing the officerâ€™s failure \r\n  to circle the word â€œbreathâ€ resulted in an incomplete advisement under South \r\n  Carolina Code section 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2003), which requires the accused be \r\n  advised in writing of his implied consent rights prior to the administration \r\n  of a breath test.Â  The trial judge agreed and granted the motion to suppress.Â  \r\n  On appeal, the circuit court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit or exclude evidence is within his discretion \r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion occurs. Elledge \r\n  v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, 352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, \r\n  792 (2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the judgeâ€™s decision is controlled \r\n  by an error of law or is without evidentiary support. State v. Wilson, \r\n  345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City of Florence argues the failure to circle the word \r\n  â€œbreathâ€ on the SLED form did not constitute an incomplete advisement of Jordanâ€™s \r\n  implied consent rights under South Carolina Code section 56-5-2950.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 56-5-2950 mandates that all persons arrested for DUI must be advised \r\n  of their implied consent rights in writing before any breath test or other type \r\n  of test is conducted.Â  The statute explicitly sets forth the essential content \r\n  of the advisement as follows:\r\n\r\nNo tests may be administered or samples obtained unless \r\n  the person has been informed in writing that:\r\n(1) he does not have to take the test or give the samples, \r\n  but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least ninety \r\n  days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal may be used against \r\n  him in court;\r\n(2) his privilege to drive must be suspended for at least \r\n  thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has an alcohol concentration \r\n  of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\r\n(3) he has the right to have a qualified person of his own \r\n  choosing conduct additional independent tests at his expense;\r\n(4) he has the right to request an administrative hearing \r\n  within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and\r\n(5) if he does not request an administrative hearing or \r\n  if his suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must enroll in \r\n  an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â  The statute further provides SLED â€œmust administer \r\n  the provisions of this subsection and must make regulations necessary to carry \r\n  out its provisions.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn determining whether Jordan was adequately advised in writing of his implied \r\n  consent rights under section 56-5-2950, we are guided by the express legislative \r\n  intent as discerned from the plain language of the statute. See State \r\n  v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2002); State v. Morgan, \r\n  352 S.C. 359, 365-66, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  Reading section \r\n  56-5-2950, it is beyond dispute that each of the implied consent rights enumerated \r\n  in the statute was explicitly addressed in the SLED advisement form presented \r\n  to Jordan.Â  Nowhere among the rights listed in section 56-5-2950 does it provide \r\n  the accused a right to be explicitly advised in writing what specific type of \r\n  test is being requestedâ€”be it blood, breath, urine, or any other test.Â  Nor, \r\n  under the language of the statute, does the accused have to be advised in writing \r\n  that only one particular test is being requested to the express exclusion of \r\n  any other test.Â  Indeed, the implied consent rights provided under section 56-5-2950(a) \r\n  inform the accused that he may refuse any test and refuse to give any \r\n  samples.Â  \r\nThe supposed violation \r\n  in the present case, therefore, is not connected to the implied consent rights \r\n  set forth in section 56-5-2950(a) as contended by Jordan.Â  The violation, if \r\n  indeed one exists, stems solely from a failure to comply with SLED procedures.Â  \r\n  The question remaining before us, therefore, is whether or under what circumstances \r\n  DUI test results should be found inadmissible due to a failure by law enforcement \r\n  to adhere to any of the various technical or procedural requirements prescribed \r\n  by the statute or promulgated by SLED through its statutory authority.\r\nThe leading case \r\n  on this point is State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 562 S.E.2d 472 (2002).Â  \r\n  In Huntley, a defendant charged with DUI sought to suppress his breath \r\n  test results on the grounds the breathalyzer operator did not strictly comply \r\n  with the statutory guidelines governing the administration of breath tests.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the defendant claimed the operator used a 0.10 simulator test \r\n  solution rather than the prescribed 0.08 solution.Â  Id. at 4, 562 S.E.2d \r\n  at 473.Â  In ruling that suppression of the test results was not warranted, the \r\n  supreme court focused on whether the failure to comply with the statute affected \r\n  the reliability of the evidence.Â  The court explicitly found the operatorâ€™s \r\n  error did not impact the accuracy and reliability of the resultsâ€”concluding \r\n  â€œ[t]here is no question the breathalyzer machine was operating properly and \r\n  its results were reliable.â€ Id. at 6, 562 S.E.2d at 474. \r\nShortly after the Huntley decision, the Legislature amended section \r\n  56-5-2950 to provide additional guidance to our trial courts on when to exclude \r\n  test results due to the failure to comply with the statuteâ€™s mandates or SLED \r\n  regulations.Â  Subsection (e) was added to the statute in 2003, which provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure to follow any of these policies, procedures, \r\n  and regulations [promulgated by SLED], or the provisions of this section, shall \r\n  result in the exclusion from evidence any tests results, if the trial judge \r\n  or hearing officer finds that such failure materially affected the accuracy \r\n  or reliability of the tests results or the fairness of the testing \r\n  procedure. [1] \r\n\r\nÂ§ 56-5-2950(e) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAs does Huntley, subsection (e) makes clear that the decision to admit \r\n  or exclude test results under section 56-5-2950 should not turn solely on whether \r\n  the prescribed procedures were followed with the most exacting compliance. Instead, \r\n  the question should be whether the violation thwarted the clear policy objectives \r\n  underlying the statuteâ€”that is, to ensure suspects are informed of their rights \r\n  to refuse any test and, if consent is obtained, to ensure the tests are conducted \r\n  in an accurate, reliable, and fair manner.Â  \r\nIn this case, neglecting to circle the word â€œbreathâ€ on \r\n  the SLED form has no bearing on the accuracy or reliability of the breath test \r\n  results, and Jordan does not contend otherwise; nor does the failure in any \r\n  way impact upon the fairness of the testing procedure.Â  The purpose of the SLED \r\n  form is not to serve as the exclusive source of information regarding the arrest \r\n  and testing procedures provided to a person accused or suspected of driving \r\n  under the influence.Â  Rather, it is designed to serve the limitedâ€”but critically \r\n  importantâ€”function of advising the accused in writing of his right to refuse \r\n  any test and inform him of the possible consequences arising from his decision \r\n  to refuse or proceed with any test.Â  The failure to satisfy the specific technical \r\n  requirement at issue in this caseâ€”a requirement that is beyond the scope of \r\n  the statutory mandate of section 56-5-2950(a)â€”cannot, therefore, render the \r\n  advisement in the present case incomplete. \r\nIn reaching this conclusion, \r\n  we do not intend to excuse the law enforcement officerâ€™s failure to execute \r\n  the Implied Consent Rights Advisement form with the care and attention the seriousness \r\n  of the occasion demanded.Â  Nor do we intend to diminish the critical role of \r\n  SLED in prescribing the necessary procedures to ensure the rights of all criminal \r\n  suspects are protected and the will of the Legislature is followed.Â  Our decision \r\n  today is limited to determining whether Jordan was adequately informed in writing \r\n  of his implied consent rights under section 56-5-2950.Â  On that narrow question \r\n  we must answer in the affirmative.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the failure to \r\n  circle the word â€œbreathâ€ on the SLED form did not render the implied consent \r\n  rights advisement incomplete or violate the implied consent statute, we find \r\n  the trial court improperly suppressed evidence of Jordanâ€™s breath test results.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the matter is \r\n  remanded to the Florence Municipal Court for trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] Â Subsection (e) was added to section 56-5-2950 \r\n    by the 2003 amendment to the statute.

The judge asked the panel members whether they had â€œany type of personal, \r\n  business or social relationship either with the defendant, Mr. Guillebeaux or \r\n  any of the potential witnesses.â€Â  None of the members of the jury panel responded.Â  \r\n  The panel was also asked, among other things, if any of them â€œfor whatever reason \r\n  could not give both the state and the defendant a fair and impartial trial.â€Â  \r\n  No one responded.Â  Both Guillebeaux and the State exhausted their peremptory \r\n  strikes, and Juror Catherine Gray (â€œJurorâ€) was seated without challenge.Â  Guillebeaux \r\n  was convicted as charged and sentenced to a total term of twenty-two years imprisonment.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAfter Guillebeauxâ€™s trial, Jessie Johnson, Jurorâ€™s brother, \r\n  approached Guillebeauxâ€™s counsel claiming Juror had a social relationship with \r\n  Smith.Â  At a post-trial hearing, Johnson testified that he and Smith used to \r\n  smoke crack together.Â  Johnson stated that Jurorâ€™s father and Smithâ€™s father \r\n  were friends, Juror went to high school with Smith, Juror knew Smith from frequenting \r\n  Smithâ€™s familyâ€™s filling station, and Juror would speak to Smith when she came \r\n  to visit Johnson.Â  \r\nJuror testified at the hearing that she knew who Smith was \r\n  but had not had any conversations with him beyond saying â€œhiâ€ in passing on \r\n  the street.Â  She denied attending high school with him but acknowledged that \r\n  she went to high school with Smithâ€™s brother.Â  She stated she was aware of what \r\n  kind of car Smith drove because he worked at his brotherâ€™s filling station, \r\n  which is across the street from her hairdresser.Â  \r\nGuillebeaux moved for a new trial based on Jurorâ€™s failure \r\n  to disclose the alleged social relationship.Â  Guillebeaux argued Jurorâ€™s failure \r\n  to inform them that she knew Smith prevented Guillebeaux from determining whether \r\n  he would exercise a peremptory strike against her.Â  The trial judge found Juror \r\n  had not misled the court and the motion was denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGuillebeaux argues the trial judge abused his discretion \r\n  in denying the motion for a new trial because Jurorâ€™s failure to disclose the \r\n  social relationship with Smith precluded Guillebeaux from exercising his peremptory \r\n  strikes against her. [1] Â  We disagree.\r\nThe denial of a motion for a new trial will be disturbed on appeal only upon \r\n  a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, \r\n  163, 539 S.E.2d 67, 69 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œWhere a new trial motion is based \r\n  upon allegations that a juror gave misleading and incomplete answers on voir \r\n  dire, the trial courtâ€™s denial of that motion will be affirmed absent a prejudicial \r\n  abuse of discretion.â€Â  Id. at 163, 539 S.E.2d at 69-70; State v. Kelly, \r\n  331 S.C. 132, 145, 502 S.E.2d 99, 106 (1998). \r\nWhen allegations arise concerning a jurorâ€™s failure to reveal \r\n  information in response to voir dire questions, courts look to whether the concealment \r\n  was intentional and consider the nature of the information concealed.Â  State \r\n  v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 587-88, 550 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001).Â  A new trial \r\n  is warranted if the court finds: (1) the juror intentionally concealed the information; \r\n  and (2) â€œthe concealed information would have supported a challenge for cause \r\n  or would have been a material factor in the use of the partyâ€™s peremptory challenges.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  However, a determination that a juror did not intentionally conceal \r\n  the information ends the courtâ€™s inquiry.Â  State v. Sparkman, 358 S.C. \r\n  491, 497, 596 S.E.2d 375, 377-78 (2004).Â  \r\nDetermining whether a jurorâ€™s failure to respond to a voir \r\n  dire question amounts to intentional concealment is a â€œfact intensive determination \r\n  that must be made on a case-by-case basis.â€Â  Sparkman, 358 S.C. at 496, \r\n  596 S.E.2d at 377.Â  Intentional concealment occurs â€œwhen the question presented \r\n  to the jury on voir dire is reasonably comprehensible to the average juror and \r\n  the subject of the inquiry is of such significance that the jurorâ€™s failure \r\n  to respond is unreasonable.â€Â  Id.Â  Concealment is considered unintentional \r\n  where the voir dire question posed is ambiguous or incomprehensible to the average \r\n  juror or where â€œthe subject of the inquiry is insignificant or so far removed \r\n  in time that the jurorâ€™s failure to respond is reasonable under the circumstances.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Although it may be inferred that a juror is not impartial if she \r\n  fails to disclose a relationship without justification, such an inference may \r\n  not be drawn where there is information to the contrary or the failure to disclose \r\n  is innocent.Â  State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 448, 567 S.E.2d 244, 247 \r\n  (2002). \r\nThis court has recently addressed the failure of a juror \r\n  to reveal a relationship with a witness.Â  State v. Galbreath, 359 S.C. \r\n  398, 597 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Galbreath, potential jurors \r\n  were asked during voir dire if they were close personal friends or business \r\n  associates with any of the witnesses.Â  A seated juror did not respond to this \r\n  question, despite information that the juror knew the victimâ€™s mother and that \r\n  the jurorâ€™s brother-in-law rented land from someone in the victimâ€™s extended \r\n  family.Â  This court found no intentional concealment where the juror accurately \r\n  answered the specific question posed and the alleged relationships did not amount \r\n  to close personal friends or business associates.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. \r\n  at 403-04, 597 S.E.2d at 847-48; see Sparkman, 358 S.C. at 498-97, \r\n  596 S.E.2d at 376-77 (finding no intentional concealment where the judge asked \r\n  on voir dire whether anyone had been the victim of a â€œserious crimeâ€ and seated \r\n  juror did not immediately recall that he had been a crime victim forty years \r\n  earlier and was not sure if the crime amounted to a â€œseriousâ€ one).\r\nAlthough the trial judge asked a more general question regarding \r\n  relationships in the present case, we find Juror did not intentionally conceal \r\n  information.Â  Juror was not asked during voir dire if she knew any of the witnesses, \r\n  she was asked if she had any type of social relationship with Smith.Â  Jurorâ€™s \r\n  knowledge of who Smith was and the rare exchange of greetings with him in her \r\n  community did not constitute a â€œsocial relationship.â€Â  Juror answered the questions \r\n  posed to her during voir dire honestly, her failure to reveal her knowledge \r\n  of Smith was a reasonable response to the question posed, and her failure to \r\n  respond did not amount to intentional concealment.Â  Further, Juror indicated \r\n  during voir dire that she knew of no reason she could not be impartial to both \r\n  the defense and the State and there is no evidence to the contrary.Â  As we find \r\n  no intentional concealment on Jurorâ€™s part, we need not further determine whether \r\n  the information would have been a material factor in the exercise of Guillebeauxâ€™s \r\n  peremptory strikes.Â  Sparkman, 358 S.C. at 497, 596 S.E.2d at 377-78.Â  \r\n  Based on this evidence, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion \r\n  in denying the motion for a new trial.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the Juror did not intentionally conceal information \r\n  in response to voir dire questions, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion \r\n  in denying Guillebeauxâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Accordingly, his convictions \r\n  are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  As the State points out, Guillebeauxâ€™s issue on \r\n    appeal refers to a motion for mistrial instead of a motion for a new trial.Â  \r\n    A motion for a mistrial is substantively different from a motion for a new \r\n    trial.Â  State v. Johnson, 248 S.C. 153, 160, 149 S.E.2d 348, 351 (1966) \r\n    (â€œIt thus appears that a mistrial and a new trial are not the same thing in \r\n    name or effect.â€).Â  However, the substance of the appellate argument focuses \r\n    on the failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial in this situation.Â  \r\n    Because Guillebeauxâ€™s motion for a new trial was properly preserved at the \r\n    trial level and the substance of his appellate argument focuses on the trial \r\n    judgeâ€™s failure to grant a new trial, we will treat the references to â€œmistrialâ€ \r\n    in his appellate brief as a scrivenerâ€™s error and address his appeal with \r\n    reference to a new trial.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3911","title":"Stoddard v.

Bannister, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Daniel Stoddard (Husband) appeals a family court order \r\n  determining it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to modify a property \r\n  settlement agreement between him and his former wife, Selena Riddle (Wife).Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1]   \r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing an eight-year marriage, Husband and Wife were divorced \r\n  in 1980.Â  The divorce decree incorporated a property settlement agreement, which, \r\n  by the agreementâ€™s own terms, was not merged into the courtâ€™s final order.Â  \r\n  In regard to alimony, the agreement stated the following:\r\n\r\nHusband shall pay directly to the Wife the sum of Two Hundred \r\n  Twenty-Five and no/100 ($225.00) Dollars per month . . . the payment of such \r\n  amounts herein provided shall not in any manner be modified by the Court, and \r\n  shall not terminate until her death or remarriage.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nSince 1983, Wife has cohabitated with another man.Â  The two \r\n  openly hold themselves out to the public as an amorous couple.Â  Throughout their \r\n  relationship, they have owned joint property and held joint mortgages.Â  The \r\n  two often travel and dine out together, and their luxurious home was the subject \r\n  of a life and style article in the Greenville News.Â  They have never, however, \r\n  participated in a marriage ceremony, and it is undisputed that the couple is \r\n  not married under common law.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn 2002, Husband brought an action seeking the termination \r\n  of his alimony obligation to Wife on the ground that Wifeâ€™s cohabitating relationship \r\n  is tantamount to marriage.Â  The family court determined it did not have subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to modify the settlement agreement.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEWÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts \r\n  in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Woodall \r\n  v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Questions concerning \r\n  alimony, however, rest within the sound discretion of the family court judge, \r\n  whose conclusions will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001); \r\n  Bannen v.Bannen, 286 S.C. 24, 26, 331 S.E.2d 379, 380 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by some error \r\n  of law or is based on findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.Â  \r\n  Bryson, 347 S.C. at 224, 553 S.E.2d at 495; McKnight v. McKnight, \r\n  283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in determining it lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to interpret his alimony obligations under the property settlement \r\n  agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior to 1983, it was the law of this state that the family court lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to interpret, enforce, or modify a separation agreement â€œincorporated but not \r\n  mergedâ€ into a divorce decree.Â  Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 352, \r\n  306 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1983); Bryant v. Varat, 278 S.C. 77, 77, 292 S.E.2d \r\n  298, 299 (1982); Kelly v. Edwards, 276 S.C. 368, 370, 278 S.E.2d 773, \r\n  774 (1981).Â  In 1983, hoping to lessen the legal import of â€œwords of artâ€ such \r\n  as â€œratified,â€ â€œapproved,â€ â€œincorporated,â€ and â€œmerged,â€ the supreme court decided \r\n  Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 306 S.E.2d 624 (1983).Â  In Moseley, \r\n  the court held jurisdiction for all domestic matters, whether by decree or by \r\n  agreement, vested in the family court.Â  Id. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â  \r\n  Following Moseley, all settlement agreements, once approved, were modifiable \r\n  by the court and enforceable by contempt, unless the agreement unambiguously \r\n  denied the family court jurisdiction.Â  Id.\r\nThe holding of Moseley, however, was expressly limited to those divorce \r\n  decrees entered after the decision.Â  Id.Â  When faced with a pre-Moseley \r\n  separation agreement that is â€œincorporated but not mergedâ€ into the divorce \r\n  decree, the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction remains restricted to its pre-Moseley \r\n  boundaries, and the agreement is enforceable only by resort to ordinary contract \r\n  remedies.Â  See Peterson v. Peterson, 333 S.C. 538, 541-543, 510 \r\n  S.E.2d 426, 427-428 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Because the settlement agreement at issue \r\n  in this case was entered into prior to Moseley and â€œincorporated but \r\n  not mergedâ€ into the divorce decree, the family court properly found it lacked \r\n  jurisdiction. [2] \r\nFurthermore, the agreement in the case at bar states, â€œthe payment of such \r\n  amounts herein provided shall not in any manner be modified by the court.â€Â  \r\n  Although recent case law and statutory amendments alter the family courtâ€™s analysis \r\n  of cohabitation as a ground for alimony termination when modification is allowed, \r\n  [3]  the parties may still agree to deny the family court the authority \r\n  to modify alimony.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe \r\n  parties may agree in writing if properly approved by the court to make the payment \r\n  of alimony as set forth [in this statute] nonmodifiable and not subject to subsequent \r\n  modification by the court.â€); Moseley, 279 S.C. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at \r\n  627 (â€œThe parties may specifically agree that the amount of alimony may not \r\n  ever be modified by the court . . . .â€).Â  In the recent case of Degenhart \r\n  v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 602 S.E.2d 96 (Ct. App. 2004), this court determined \r\n  that language strikingly similar to that employed in this settlement agreement \r\n  denied the family court the authority to modify alimony in any manner.Â  The \r\n  family court, therefore, would lack jurisdiction to modify alimony payments \r\n  here even if the agreement was entered into following the Moseley decision.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the family courtâ€™s order isÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Husband argues that, even if the family court \r\n    lacks jurisdiction to modify or enforce a pre-Moseley \r\n    agreement, it may still interpret the agreement.Â  We find no merit \r\n    in this semantic distinction.Â  Pre-Moseley, the family court lacked \r\n    jurisdiction to enforce, modify or interpret settlement agreements \r\n    like the one at issue.Â  See Kelly v. Edwards, 276 S.C. 368, \r\n    370, 278 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1981) (â€œ[O]nly the interpretation of the \r\n    [settlement agreement] was in issue, therefore, the family court was without \r\n    subject matter jurisdiction to determine contractual obligations.â€(emphasis \r\n    added)).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  See S.C.

Richardson, Senior Assistant \r\n  Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Randolph \r\n  Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Charles Brown appeals his conviction for distribution of \r\n  cocaine.Â  He argues the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury the \r\n  defense of entrapment.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 13, 2002, SLED Agent William Kimble met with a paid confidential informant, \r\n  Harold David Anderson, to conduct a controlled purchase of cocaine from Charles \r\n  Brown in Beaufort.Â  Anderson was subject to pending criminal charges \r\n  in Georgia and had aspirations of attending the Georgia Police Academy.Â  The \r\n  operation was initiated by SLED as a result of a discussion with the Georgia \r\n  Bureau of Investigations, the organization for which Anderson primarily worked.Â  \r\n  Although several officers with the narcotics division of the Beaufort County \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department assisted in the operation, they had no prior knowledge \r\n  of any alleged drug dealing by Brown.Â  At the time of the incident, Anderson \r\n  and Brown had casually known each other for about a year.Â  Anderson spoke with \r\n  Brown several times by telephone during the day of the controlled buy to arrange \r\n  the deal.Â Â  \r\nAs a result of the telephone conversations, Kimble and Anderson drove together \r\n  to Brownâ€™s place of employment.Â  Brown met with them inside but did not conduct \r\n  the requested transaction.Â  Instead, he asked Anderson and Kimble to wait forty \r\n  minutes to an hour so that he could retrieve the drugs.Â  Brown called after \r\n  that time and the group agreed to meet at Burger King.Â  Because Brown refused \r\n  to deal directly with Kimble, Kimble gave Anderson $200 in marked cash to complete \r\n  the transaction.Â Â  When Anderson got into the car with Brown, he gave Brown \r\n  the money in exchange for 3.16 grams of cocaine.Â  Subsequently, Brown was arrested \r\n  and indicted for distribution of cocaine.Â  \r\nAt trial, Brownâ€™s counsel moved for a directed verdict and requested a charge \r\n  of entrapment after the close of the evidence.Â  Counsel argued that law enforcement \r\n  in Beaufort County was not familiar with Brown until the Georgia Bureau of Investigations \r\n  prompted the drug operation.Â  Counsel further asserted the State failed to present \r\n  evidence that Brown was a drug dealer.Â  The judge denied the motion and the \r\n  request to charge.Â  Because Brown failed to testify or present evidence to support \r\n  the affirmative defense of entrapment, the judge found Brown was not entitled \r\n  to the requested charge. [1] Â  \r\n  The judge further ruled there was no evidence in the record to support the \r\n  defense.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe jury convicted Brown of distribution \r\n  of cocaine.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to nine years imprisonment.Â  Brown \r\n  appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBrown asserts the trial judge erred in declining to instruct \r\n  the jury regarding the defense of entrapment.Â  He contends the evidence supporting \r\n  his entrapment defense was presented through cross-examination of the Stateâ€™s \r\n  witnesses and based on the Stateâ€™s evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current \r\n  and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, \r\n  261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).Â  â€œThe law to be charged to the jury is determined \r\n  by the evidence presented at trial.â€ State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, \r\n  433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993).Â  If there is any evidence to support a jury charge, \r\n  the trial judge should grant the request.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. \r\n  604, 632, 545 S.E.2d 805, 819 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 977 (2001).Â  \r\n  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge \r\n  must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Hughey, \r\n  339 S.C. 439, 450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. \r\n  946 (2000).\r\nâ€œThe affirmative defense of entrapment is available where there is the â€˜conception \r\n  and planning of an offense by an officer, and his procurement of its commission \r\n  by one who would not have perpetrated it except for trickery, persuasion, or \r\n  fraud of the officer.â€™â€Â  State v. Johnson, 295 S.C. 215, 216, 367 S.E.2d \r\n  700, 701 (1988) (quoting State v. Jacobs, 238 S.C. 234, 244, 119 S.E.2d \r\n  735, 740 (1961)).Â  â€œIt is a well settled principle of law that the defense of \r\n  entrapment is not available to a defendant exhibiting a predisposition to commit \r\n  a crime independent of governmental inducement and influence.â€ Johnson, \r\n  295 S.C. at 217, 367 S.E.2d at 701.Â  Thus, the entrapment defense consists of \r\n  two elements:Â  (1) government inducement, and (2) lack of predisposition.Â  Matthews \r\n  v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63 (1988).Â  The United States Supreme Court \r\n  explained the rationale underlying the defense of entrapment as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen the criminal design originates, not with the accused, but is conceived \r\n  in the mind of the government officers, and the accused is by persuasion, deceitful \r\n  representation, or inducement lured into the commission of a criminal act, the \r\n  government is estopped by sound public policy from prosecution therefor. \r\n\r\nSorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 445 (1932).\r\nâ€œOne pleading entrapment has the burden of showing that he was induced, tricked \r\n  or incited to commit a crime, which he would not otherwise have committed.â€Â  \r\n  Johnson, 295 S.C. at 217, 367 S.E.2d at 701; Babb v. State, 240 \r\n  S.C. 235, 237, 125 S.E.2d 467, 467 (1962), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 979 \r\n  (1964) (â€œEntrapment is an affirmative defense to the crime charged and imposes \r\n  upon the accused the burden of showing that he was induced to commit the act \r\n  for which he is being prosecuted.â€).Â  â€œ[T]he defendant has the initial burden \r\n  to produce more than a scintilla of evidence that the government induced him \r\n  to commit the charged offense, before the burden shifts to the government to \r\n  prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit \r\n  the crime.â€Â  United States v. Sligh, 142 F.3d 761, 762 (4th Cir. 1998) \r\n  (citations omitted).Â  â€œA defendant is not entitled to an entrapment instruction \r\n  unless he can meet this initial burden of producing some evidence of government \r\n  inducement.â€Â  Id. at 762-63.Â  Thus, â€œ[t]he court may find as a matter \r\n  of law that no entrapment existed, when there is no evidence in the record that, \r\n  if believed by the jury, would show that the governmentâ€™s conduct created a \r\n  substantial risk that the offense would be committed by a person other than \r\n  one ready and willing to commit it.â€Â  United States v. Osborne, 935 F.2d \r\n  32, 38 (4th Cir. 1991).\r\nAs a threshold \r\n  matter, Brownâ€™s decision not to testify or call witnesses did not automatically \r\n  preclude him from receiving the requested charge on entrapment.Â  The United \r\n  States Supreme Court has ruled that it is not necessary for a defendant to testify \r\n  or present any evidence to invoke the defense of entrapment.Â  Sherman v. \r\n  United States, 356 U.S. 369, 373 (1958).Â  In Sherman, the defense \r\n  called no witnesses.Â  The Court concluded from the evidence that entrapment \r\n  was established as a matter of law.Â  In so holding, the Court stated that it \r\n  was â€œnot choosing between conflicting witnesses, nor judging credibility . . \r\n  . We reach our conclusion from the undisputed testimony of the prosecutionâ€™s \r\n  witnesses.â€ Id. (emphasis added). Therefore, the trial judge erred, \r\n  as a matter of law, when he denied the charge on the ground Brown did not testify, \r\n  call witnesses, or present any evidence other than through the prosecution witnesses.\r\nThe question then \r\n  becomes whether there was sufficient evidence to support the affirmative defense \r\n  of entrapment.Â  In analyzing this issue, we must consider Brownâ€™s version of \r\n  the facts as true.Â  See United States v. Trejo, 136 F.3d 826, \r\n  827 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (â€œIn determining whether an entrapment defense is warranted, \r\n  the court considers appellantâ€™s version of the facts to be true.â€).Â  Because \r\n  the question of entrapment is generally one for the jury, an appellate court \r\n  reviews the trial courtâ€™s decision not to give an entrapment instruction de \r\n  novo.Â  United States v. Singh, 54 F.3d 1182, 1189 (4th Cir. 1995) \r\n  (â€œThe district courtâ€™s decision not to give an entrapment instruction is a question \r\n  of law which we review de novo.â€).\r\nIn terms of inducement, \r\n  there was evidence to suggest that law enforcement instigated the drug transaction.Â  \r\n  Anderson, a friend of Brownâ€™s and a paid confidential informant, initiated the \r\n  meeting by calling Brown several times the day of the transaction.Â  Brown chose \r\n  only to deal with Anderson and specifically refused to sell to Kimble.Â  Because \r\n  Anderson was subject to pending criminal charges and had aspirations of attending \r\n  the Georgia Police Academy, he had the incentive to set up the drug deal.Â  SLED \r\n  Agent Kimble testified that he intended to give Anderson a favorable recommendation \r\n  to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations in exchange for his cooperation. \r\nThere is also \r\n  evidence that indicates Brownâ€™s lack of predisposition to commit the offense \r\n  of distribution of cocaine.Â  The Stateâ€™s witnesses acknowledged that Brown was \r\n  a retired Army first sergeant who was honorably discharged.Â  Brown was also \r\n  gainfully employed and declined to conduct the transaction at his place of business.Â  \r\n  The cocaine was not readily accessible to Brown given Anderson and Kimble had \r\n  to wait approximately an hour and a half between the time of the request and \r\n  the actual sale.Â  At the time of his arrest, Brown did not have any other drugs \r\n  in his possession.Â  Nor did he have a significant amount of cash other than \r\n  the $200 in marked money.Â  Furthermore, aside from the controlled buy, SLED \r\n  agents and officers with the Beaufort County Sheriffâ€™s Department had not previously \r\n  purchased drugs from Brown nor did they have any knowledge that Brown had engaged \r\n  in drug activity.Â  Moreover, there was no evidence of any prior drug transactions \r\n  between Anderson and Brown.Â  When Brown gave a statement to investigating officers, \r\n  he denied being a drug dealer and claimed that he made the sale for a friend.Â  \r\n  Brown also made this same comment to Anderson on the day of the sale.\r\nBased on our review \r\n  of the record, we find there was evidence to support the presentation of the \r\n  defense of entrapment to the jury.Â  See Sorrells, 287 U.S. at \r\n  440-41 (finding trial judge erred in refusing to submit issue of entrapment \r\n  to the jury in trial for possession and sale of intoxicating liquor where:Â  \r\n  prohibition agent befriended defendant; agent made repeated requests to defendant \r\n  for liquor; defendant did not have liquor in his immediate possession at the \r\n  time of the request; there was no evidence that defendant ever possessed or \r\n  sold liquor prior to the transaction in question; the defendant was gainfully \r\n  employed; and there was testimony the defendant possessed â€œgood characterâ€); \r\n  see also Johnson, 295 S.C. at 217, 367 S.E.2d at 701 (â€œThe issue \r\n  of whether or not the defense of entrapment has been established is ordinarily \r\n  a question of fact for a jury unless there is undisputed evidence and only one \r\n  reasonable conclusion can be reached.â€); cf. State v. Cooper, \r\n  302 S.C. 184, 186, 394 S.E.2d 717, 718 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding, in case involving \r\n  convictions for criminal conspiracy and distribution of crack cocaine, defendant \r\n  was not entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment where defendant engaged \r\n  in the illegal activity â€œbecause of her own preexisting readiness to do so and \r\n  not because of incessant demands made upon her by the undercover agentâ€ or close \r\n  personal relationship given defendant was an admitted purchaser and regular \r\n  user of crack cocaine, participated in the drug buy to share in the purchase, \r\n  and received a portion of the crack cocaine).Â  Accordingly, the judge erred \r\n  in declining to charge the law of entrapment.Â  Because entrapment was Brownâ€™s \r\n  only defense, the prejudice from this error was significant and, thus, warrants \r\n  a new trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the evidence presented was sufficient to entitle Brown to the requested \r\n  charge of entrapment.Â  The judgeâ€™s refusal to instruct the jury on this defense \r\n  constituted error and warrants a new trial.Â  Accordingly, Brownâ€™s conviction \r\n  is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  The record reflects the judge was initially inclined to give \r\n    the charge of entrapment until the Solicitor alluded that the predisposition \r\n    element of the offense of entrapment was satisfied by Brownâ€™s prior drug dealing.Â  \r\n    However, there is no evidence contained in the record indicating that Brown \r\n    had a drug dealing history. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3913","title":"Sides v.

Grady Jordan, of Easley, for Appellants.\r\nJohn P. Riordan and N. Heyward Clarkson, III, both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Dorothy Sides and her husband, Arthur, brought this action \r\n  after Dorothy Sides fell at the Greenville Memorial Hospital while visiting \r\n  her husband.Â  The accident occurred near a construction area in the parking \r\n  lot.Â  They sued the Greenville Hospital System, as well as the general contractor, \r\n  Rodgers Builders, Inc., and a subcontractor, F.T. Williams Co., Inc.Â  The trial \r\n  court granted summary judgment to both the contractor and the subcontractor, \r\n  and Mr. and Mrs. Sides appeal.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn late 2000, Greenville Memorial Hospital was undergoing Phase V of a construction \r\n  project, which included the addition of around 184,000 square feet of construction.Â  \r\n  Rodgers Builders was the general contractor for Phase V.Â  F.T. Williams was \r\n  a subcontractor for the project and was responsible for site preparation and \r\n  construction, which consisted of demolition of the existing parking lot and \r\n  pouring concrete.Â Â Â  \r\nOn November 28, 2000, Mrs. Sides visited her husband at Greenville Memorial \r\n  Hospital.Â  Her daughter, Theresa Allen, accompanied her.Â  They were parked in \r\n  a hospital parking lot across from the emergency room.Â  Mrs. Sides and Ms. Allen \r\n  left the hospital after dark at around 7:00 p.m. and walked through an area \r\n  in the parking lot where concrete had recently been poured, requiring them to \r\n  follow a designated path.Â  According to Mrs. Sides and Ms. Allen, the path was \r\n  unlit because the bollard lights [1] \r\n   in this area were not working.Â  Mrs. Sides fell when she suddenly stepped \r\n  off a curb that she could not see in the darkness.Â  Ms. Allen also stumbled \r\n  on the curb, but did not fall.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter the accident, a person identifying herself as a hospital employee called \r\n  Ms. Allen to ask how Mrs. Sides was doing and where she had fallen.Â  When Ms. \r\n  Allen told her the fall had occurred where the lights were out, the employee \r\n  allegedly stated, â€œYes, weâ€™ve had a problem with those lights.Â  Weâ€™ve been meaning \r\n  to get them fixed and we havenâ€™t been able to get them fixed yet.â€Â Â Â  \r\nFrederick Scott McMillan, a hospital employee who was the Project Coordinator \r\n  for Phase V, testified in his deposition that something appeared to be cracked \r\n  inside the lower casing of the bollard light near where Mrs. Sides fell.Â  He \r\n  noted concrete had recently been poured in the same area.Â  Mr. McMillan admitted \r\n  the Engineering and Security divisions of the hospital were responsible for, \r\n  and maintained control of, the lighting in the area where Mrs. Sides fell.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sides filed suit against the hospital, Rodgers Builders, and F.T. \r\n  Williams.Â  All defendants moved for summary judgment.Â  The trial court denied \r\n  the hospitalâ€™s motion, but granted summary judgment to both Rodgers Builders \r\n  and F.T. Williams.Â  The court subsequently denied a motion to reconsider by \r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Sides, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment under the same standard \r\n  applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.â€Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross \r\n  &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 \r\n  (2002).Â  â€œSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all \r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Id. at 361-62, 563 S.E.2d at \r\n  333.Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, an appellate court \r\n  will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.; see also \r\n  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sides argue the trial court erred in ruling on the motions for \r\n  summary judgment because Rodgers Builders and F.T. Williams presented no evidence \r\n  in support of their motions.Â  They further argue the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to both Rodgers Builders and F.T. Williams.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Evidence to Support a Motion for Summary Judgment\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sides submit that, because Rodgers Builders and F.T. Williams \r\n  did not offer evidence in support of their respective motions for summary judgment, \r\n  the trial court should not have granted the motions.Â  They further argue the \r\n  trial court erred in relying upon only the evidence they themselves submitted.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nRule 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a party \r\n  may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment in his \r\n  favor as to all or part of a claim.Â  Rule 56(a), SCRCP.Â  The trial court shall \r\n  grant the motion â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \r\n  and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Id. Rule 56(c).\r\nâ€œUnder Rule 56(c), the party seeking summary judgment has the initial responsibility \r\n  of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.â€Â  Baughman \r\n  v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  \r\n  â€œWith respect to an issue upon which the nonmoving party bears the burden of \r\n  proof, this initial responsibility â€˜may be discharged by â€œshowingâ€--that is, \r\n  pointing out to the [trial] court--that there is an absence of evidence to support \r\n  the nonmoving partyâ€™s case.â€™â€Â  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting \r\n  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986)).Â  â€œThe moving party \r\n  need not â€˜support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials negating \r\n  the opponentâ€™s claim.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323); \r\n  see also Richardson v. State-Record Co., 330 S.C. 562, 499 S.E.2d \r\n  822 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the \r\n  opposing party must come forward with specific facts that show there is a genuine \r\n  issue of fact remaining for trial.Â  Baughman, 306 S.C. at 115, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  at 545. \r\nBoth Rodgers Builders and F.T. Williams brought to the attention of the trial \r\n  court the absence of evidence to support their opponentsâ€™ case.Â  The burden \r\n  then shifted to Mr. and Mrs. Sides to prove that a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact did indeed exist.Â  The trial courtâ€™s consideration of evidence presented \r\n  by Mr. and Mrs. Sides was appropriate and provides no grounds for reversal as \r\n  the trial court must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.Â  Although \r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Sides were not required to make a submission, the trial court need \r\n  not have excluded that evidence in determining whether any triable issues of \r\n  fact existed.\r\nII.Â  Rodgers Builders\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sides contend sufficient evidence was presented to survive summary \r\n  judgment regarding the potential liability of Rodgers Builders for the accident \r\n  under the premises liability theory that a contractor owes an invitee the same \r\n  duties as a landowner owes an invitee.Â  They further argue summary judgment \r\n  as to Rodgers Builders was improper because the trial court did not grant summary \r\n  judgment to the hospital.Â  \r\nA property owner owes an invitee or business visitor the duty of exercising \r\n  reasonable or ordinary care for his safety and is liable for injuries resulting \r\n  from any breach of such duty.Â  Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, \r\n  340 S.C. 438, 531 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The property owner has a duty \r\n  to warn an invitee only of latent or hidden dangers of which the property owner \r\n  has or should have knowledge.Â  Id. at 445, 531 S.E.2d at 538.Â  A property \r\n  owner generally does not have a duty to warn others of open and obvious conditions, \r\n  but a landowner may be liable if the landowner should have anticipated the resulting \r\n  harm.Â  Id. at 445-46, 531 S.E.2d at 539. \r\nâ€œUnder a premises liability theory, a contractor generally equates to an invitor \r\n  and assumes the same duties that the landowner has, including the duty to warn \r\n  of dangers or defects known to him but unknown to others.â€Â  Id. at 448, \r\n  531 S.E.2d at 540.Â  No contractor liability exists, however, for injuries resulting \r\n  from dangers that were obvious or that should have been observed in the exercise \r\n  of reasonable care.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe entire basis of an invitorâ€™s liability \r\n  rests upon his superior knowledge of the danger that causes the inviteeâ€™s injuries.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  â€œIf that superior knowledge is lacking, as when the danger is obvious, \r\n  the invitor cannot be held liable.â€Â  Id.\r\nBecause a contractorâ€™s potential liability is based on the notion that it has \r\n  superior knowledge, finding the contractor did not have such superior knowledge \r\n  extinguishes its liability.Â  In this case, Rodgers Builders did not have superior \r\n  knowledge of the lighting as the hospital admitted it was responsible for the \r\n  lighting on the premises.Â  According to Mr. McMillan, the hospitalâ€™s Engineering \r\n  and Security divisions maintained the lights.Â  Thus, based on the absence of \r\n  evidence suggesting Rodgers Builders had any superior knowledge, the trial court \r\n  did not err in granting summary judgment to Rodgers Builders.Â  \r\nMoreover, the hospital, with superior knowledge, may have owed a duty to invitees \r\n  that Rodgers Builders did not owe; consequently, the trial court acted properly \r\n  in separately considering the duties owed by the respective parties in ruling \r\n  on the motions for summary judgment.Â  The fact that the trial court denied the \r\n  hospitalâ€™s motion for summary judgment did not automatically require the court \r\n  to deny the motion by Rodgers Builders.\r\nIII.Â  F.T. Williams\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sides further argue the trial court erred in granting summary \r\n  judgment to F.T. Williams as a subcontractor for the project.Â  They argue Mrs. \r\n  Sides fell in an area where concrete had recently been poured (the pouring of \r\n  concrete being F.T. Williamsâ€™s responsibility); however, they fail to assert \r\n  anything other than their general allegation that the lack of lighting in the \r\n  area caused Mrs. Sidesâ€™s fall.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œ[A] subcontractor is an invitee as to a general contractor.â€Â  Larimore, \r\n  340 S.C. at 448 n.18, 531 S.E.2d at 540 n.18 (citing 62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises \r\n  Liability Â§ 457 (1990)).Â  In this case, the absence of evidence as to F.T. \r\n  Williamsâ€™s duty to Mrs. Sides supports the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant summary \r\n  judgment.Â  And, even if F.T. Williams owed some duty to Mrs. Sides, we agree \r\n  with the trial court that there was no evidence presented that F.T. Williams \r\n  knew or should have known the lights were not working (assuming they were out) \r\n  or that the fall was the result of anything that F.T. Williams did or did not \r\n  do.Â  Since there was no evidence F.T. Williams had superior knowledge of the \r\n  lighting situation, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in \r\n  this regard as well.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  As indicated by the record, the â€œbollard lightsâ€ \r\n    were lighting fixtures contained in low, thick posts or stands that were approximately \r\n    three feet high.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
