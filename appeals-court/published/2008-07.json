Â Selective Insurance Company of South Carolina, Inc.\r\n  (â€œSelectiveâ€) appeals the dismissal of its cross-claim for equitable\r\nindemnification against Insurance Associates.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n The Fowlers were\r\n  seriously injured when the motorcycle they were riding was struck by a car\r\n  driven by Sallie Hunter.Â  The car was owned by Gynecologic Oncology Associates (â€œGOAâ€) for use by Mrs. Hunterâ€™s husband, Dr. James Hunter. Â Auto-Owners Insurance Company insured\r\n  the car under a business automobile policy with limits of one million dollars.Â \r\n  At least two other policies potentially provided coverage.Â  One was a\r\n  commercial umbrella policy for four million dollars procured by GOA through Insurance Associates and issued by Selective.Â  The other policy at issue was a\r\n  personal catastrophic liability policy for two million dollars carried by the\r\nHunters and also issued by Selective. \r\nThe Fowlers filed suit\r\n  against Mrs. Hunter, and it was discovered that due to an inadvertent computer\r\n  error by Insurance Associates, GOAâ€™s umbrella policy did not provide automobile\r\n  liability coverage.Â  The Fowlers then filed a declaratory judgment action to\r\n  see what coverage was available under the above-referenced policies. Â The\r\n  Hunters and GOA answered and filed cross-claims against Selective for\r\n  reformation and against Insurance Associates for professional negligence. Â Additionally,\r\nSelective filed a cross-claim against Insurance Associates for indemnity.Â  \r\nEventually, the parties\r\n  settled many of the claims in the two lawsuits. The Fowlers received one\r\n  million dollars from GOAâ€™s automobile policy, two million dollars from the\r\n  Hunterâ€™s personal umbrella policy, and an additional one and one-half million dollars\r\n  from Selective.Â  Additionally, the Hunters and GOA assigned their professional\r\n  negligence claim against Insurance Associates to the Fowlers, and the Fowlers\r\n  signed a covenant not to execute against the Hunters and GOA.Â  The Hunters and GOA agreed to cooperate with the Fowlers in the prosecution of the professional negligence\r\n  claim, and the Fowlers and Selective agreed to split equally any recovery from\r\neither the professional negligence or indemnification claim.\r\nInsurance Associates\r\n  filed a summary judgment motion seeking dismissal of the only remaining claims:\r\n  the professional negligence claim assigned to the Fowlers and Selectiveâ€™s claim\r\n  for indemnification.Â  The circuit court granted these motions finding that\r\n  because neither the Hunters, GOA, nor Selective could prove they were damaged\r\n  by Insurance Associateâ€™s negligence, the claims failed.Â  These appeals\r\nfollowed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard of\r\n  review as the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis,\r\n  366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  To\r\n  determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing court must\r\n  consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable\r\n  to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrs., 368 S.C. 424, 434,\r\n  629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  However, when a party has moved for summary\r\n  judgment the opposing party may not rest upon the mere allegations or\r\n  denials of his pleading to defeat it.Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.Â  Rather, the\r\n  non-moving party must set forth specific facts demonstrating to the court there\r\n  is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Professional\r\nNegligence\r\nThe Fowlers\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Insurance\r\n  Associates as to their assigned claim for professional negligence.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe circuit\r\n  court reasoned because the Hunters and GOA were insulated from execution of any\r\n  judgment, the Fowlers, standing in the Hunterâ€™s shoes, could never prove\r\n  damages flowing from the negligence of Insurance Associates.Â  While this\r\n  analysis is technically correct, the majority of courts having addressed this\r\n  issue have elected to allow such an assigned claim to proceed.Â  We are\r\n  persuaded by the rationale set forth in those cases.Â  \r\nIn Campione v.\r\n  Wilson, 661 N.E.2d 658, 660-61 (Mass. 1996), an injured party settled with\r\n  an insurer and insured for a stipulated amount of damages and a release of the\r\n  insured. Â The Massachusetts Supreme Court determined that even though the\r\n  settlement included a release, the injured party could proceed in prosecuting\r\n  the insuredâ€™s assigned negligence claim against the insurance brokers.Â  Id. at 663.Â  The court considered the competing policy considerations at play under\r\n  these circumstances noting there is a risk of collusion between the settling\r\n  parties even though there is benefit to allowing injured parties and\r\n  tortfeasors to settle claims.Â  Id. at 662-63.Â  Nevertheless, the court rejected\r\n  the â€œâ€˜somewhat metaphysical contentionâ€™ that the legal basis for the claim against\r\n  the insurer [and broker] disappeared when the insured became insulated from\r\n  liability due to a release or a covenant not to execute.â€Â  Id. at 662 (quoting Gray v. Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co., 871 F.2d 1128, 1132-33 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1989)).Â Â  \r\nAn examination\r\n  of other jurisdictions reveals most courts are approving of settlement\r\n  arrangements similar to the one in this case, so long as the risk of collusion\r\n  is minimized.Â  See Gray, 871 F.2d at 1133 (applying North\r\n  Carolina law and allowing injured party to pursue assigned bad faith claim\r\n  against insurer even though insured was insulated from liability by release); Damron\r\n    v. Sledge, 460 P.2d 997, 999 (Ariz. 1969) (holding an assignment of the\r\n  insuredâ€™s bad faith claim plus a covenant not to execute was not ipso facto collusive); United Servs. Auto. Assâ€™n v. Morris, 741 P.2d 246, 254 (Ariz.\r\n  1987) (holding settlement between insured and claimant in which insurer was to\r\n  defend under reservation of rights did not violate policyâ€™s cooperation clause); Red Giant Oil Co. v. Lawlor, 528 N.W.2d 524, 532-33 (Iowa 1995) (holding\r\n  insured could still suffer damages from agentâ€™s negligence when settlement was\r\n  coupled with a covenant not to execute that did not extinguish liability as\r\n  would a release; therefore, assigned claim for agentâ€™s negligence would be\r\n  valid); Glenn v. Fleming, 799 P.2d 79, 92-93 (Kan. 1990) (approving of a\r\n  settlement between insured and injured party coupled with an assignment of a\r\n  prejudgment claim and covenant not to execute when the settlement is entered\r\n  into in good faith and the settlement amount is shown to be reasonable).\r\nSouth Carolina has shown\r\n  a willingness to depart from the common law in order to promote reasonable\r\n  settlements between tortfeasors and injured parties.Â  In Bartholomew v.\r\n    McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 179 S.E.2d 912 (1971), our Supreme Court concluded\r\n  the common-law rule regarding the Â release of one joint tortfeasor was not in\r\nthe best interests of justice.\r\n\r\n  Being\r\n    untrammeled by the ancient rule which, in our view, tends to stifle\r\n    settlements, defeat the intention of parties and extol technicality, we adopt\r\n    the view that the release of one tort-feasor does not release others who wrongfully\r\n    contributed to plaintiffâ€™s injuries unless this was the intention of the\r\n    parties, or unless plaintiff has, in fact, received full compensation amounting\r\n    to a satisfaction.\r\n\r\nId. at 492, 179\r\nS.E.2d at 914.\r\nWhile acknowledging the\r\n  inherent benefits of settlement, we also note South Carolina promotes the\r\n  careful examination of settlement agreements to avoid the potential for complicity\r\nor wrongdoing.Â  \r\n\r\n  We are cognizant\r\n    that litigants are free to devise a settlement agreement in any manner that\r\n    does not contravene public policy or the law.Â  In fact, this Court encourages\r\n    such compromise agreements because they avoid costly litigation and delay to an\r\n    injured party.Â  However, these settlement agreements must be carefully\r\n    scrutinized in order to determine their efficiency and impact upon the\r\n    integrity of the judicial process.Â  \r\n\r\nEcclesiastes\r\n  Prod. Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., 374 S.C. 483, 493, 649 S.E.2d 494, 499\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Poston by Poston v. Barnes, 294 S.C. 261,\r\n263-64, 363 S.E.2d 888, 889-90 (1987)).\r\nIn the instant case,\r\n  there is no evidence of collusion between the settling parties.Â  The injuries\r\n  suffered in the case were extremely serious.Â  Furthermore, the parties did not\r\n  put a stipulated amount of damages in their agreement so as to reduce the\r\n  appearance of collusion, and because they contemplated that the underlying tort\r\n  claim would be tried to a conclusion.[1]Â Â Â \r\n  The result of the settlement was the Fowlers were able to procure the three\r\n  million dollars available under the other insurance policies in which coverage\r\n  was not disputed, while litigation against a negligent party, Insurance\r\n  Associates, was not foreclosed.[2]Â \r\n  This was clearly the intent of the parties as shown by the express language of\r\n  the settlement agreement and covenant not to execute.Â  The catastrophic\r\n  injuries suffered by the Fowlers begged a resolution that would give them the\r\n  benefit of the uncontested proceeds promptly.Â  In light of our Stateâ€™s\r\n  willingness to place the interests of the injured party above such a technical\r\n  application of the law, we believe it was inappropriate for the claim to be\r\n  dismissed at the summary judgment stage. Â We therefore reverse the circuit\r\ncourtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Insurance Associates.Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Equitable Indemnification\r\nSelective contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Insurance\r\n  Associates regarding Selectiveâ€™s cross-claim for equitable indemnification.Â  We\r\nagree.\r\nUnder South Carolina law, a party seeking equitable indemnification must show three things: â€œ(1)\r\n  the indemnitor was liable for causing the Plaintiffâ€™s damages; (2) the\r\n  indemnitee was exonerated from any liability for those damages; and (3) the\r\n  indemnitee suffered damages as a result of the Plaintiffâ€™s claims against it\r\n  which were eventually proven to be the fault of the indemnitor.â€Â  Vermeer\r\n    Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 63, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  301, 307 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the settlement, the\r\n  Fowlers received one and one-half million dollars from Selective that was not\r\n  directly traceable to any policy.Â  The circuit court determined Selective\r\n  admitted liability under the commercial umbrella policy by making this\r\n  payment.Â  If so, Selective actually benefitted from\r\n  the negligence of Insurance Associates.Â  Had the automobile liability not been\r\n  inadvertently excluded under the policy, the defendantsâ€™ potential exposure\r\n  would have been the full amount of the policy limits amounting to four million\r\n  dollars.Â  \r\nSelective\r\n  offered an alternative explanation for the one and one-half million dollar\r\n  payment.Â  Selective contends the payment was made as part of a global\r\n  settlement to avoid a professional negligence claim asserted by the Hunters and\r\n  GOA.Â  Insurance Associates admitted its negligence in failing to request\r\n  automobile coverage on the umbrella policy.Â  If Insurance Associates was acting\r\n  as an agent for Selective, Selective could be vicariously liable for that\r\n  negligence. Â Consequently, Selective argues it settled that claim for one and\r\n  one-half million dollars, paid to the Fowlers, and decided to pursue\r\n  indemnification from Insurance Associates.Â  We find Selectiveâ€™s position raises\r\n  a question regarding the indemnification claim, but only if we can conclude\r\n  Selective would not have issued the policy had the application been correctly\r\n  submitted.Â  In other words, if Selective would have issued the policy anyway, it\r\n  was not damaged by Insurance Associatesâ€™ negligence as it would have been\r\n  exposed for the full four million dollars.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  the moving party, Insurance Associates relied upon the deposition testimony of\r\n  Roy Phillips indicating that Selective would have definitely issued the policy\r\n  had it been submitted correctly to include automobile coverage. Â Insurance\r\n  Associates also submitted a set of guidelines related to the â€œone and doneâ€\r\n  computer software program that allowed â€œagentsâ€ to automatically secure\r\n  policies if certain criteria are met.Â  In response, Selective submitted\r\n  guidelines produced by Insurance Associates during discovery showing that a\r\n  policy would not automatically be secured unless the underlying policy was also\r\n  issued by Selective.Â  In this case, the underlying policy was not issued by\r\n  Selective, but by Auto-Owners.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  conclude the competing sets of guidelines raise a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact precluding summary judgment.Â  Further inquiry into the facts may show\r\n  Selective would not have issued the policy without the automobile exclusion.Â \r\n  If so, Selectiveâ€™s claim for indemnification as to the one and one-half million\r\n  dollar settlement may prove viable.Â  If Selective cannot produce such evidence,\r\n  the claim will likely fail.Â  However, we find the issue presented was too\r\n  uncertain at this stage for the grant of summary judgment to be appropriate.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Insurance Associates contends Selective failed to mitigate its damages, barring\r\n  its indemnification claim, by entering into the global settlement and not litigating\r\n  coverage under the commercial umbrella policy.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  Selective may have a viable coverage defense as to the Hunterâ€™s professional\r\n  negligence claim, that defense was not a certainty.Â  Had they not settled,\r\n  Selective could have been found responsible for the full four million dollars\r\n  contemplated under the policy.Â  By settling, Selective made a calculated\r\n  decision to minimize its own risk.Â  Furthermore, this mitigated the potential\r\n  damages Selective can seek via indemnification from Insurance Associates.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  are persuaded settlements like the one in this case are favorable, so long as\r\n  the risk of collusion is minimized.Â  Therefore, we conclude the grant of\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Insurance Associates should be reversed.Â \r\n  Furthermore, we believe the existence of the competing guidelines created a\r\n  genuine issue of fact regarding Selectiveâ€™s claim for indemnification making\r\n  the grant of summary judgment inappropriate.Â  Consequently, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Fowlers and\r\n  Selective argued to the circuit court if a judgment in excess of the policy\r\n  limits was required prior to determining the summary judgment motions, the\r\n  motion hearing should be stayed and the underlying tort claim tried.Â  However,\r\n  the circuit court elected to proceed with ruling on summary judgment motions.\r\n[2] The overall\r\n  settlement received was four and one-half million dollars.Â  However, as\r\n  discussed further below, Selective contends one and one-half million dollars of\r\n  the settlement was not payment from any particular policy. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4423","title":"State v.

Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An appellate court\r\n  is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â  The admission of evidence is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Pittman, 373\r\n  S.C. 527, 577, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007).Â  To constitute an abuse of\r\n  discretion, the conclusions of the trial court must lack evidentiary support or\r\n  be controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNelson argues the\r\n  trial court erroneously relied on Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE, in admitting Clementâ€™s\r\n  written statement.[2]Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nPursuant\r\n  to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE, a statement is not hearsay if\r\n\r\n  [t]he\r\n    declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination\r\n    concerning the statement, and the statement is . . . consistent with the\r\n    declarantâ€™s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge\r\n    against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive;\r\n    provided, however, the statement must have been made before the alleged\r\n    fabrication, or before the alleged improper influence or motive arose . . . .\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has explained the following elements must be\r\n  satisfied before a prior consistent statement can be admitted into evidence\r\n  based upon Rule 801(d)(1)(B):\r\n\r\n  (1) the declarant must testify and be\r\n    subject to cross-examination, (2) the opposing party must have explicitly or\r\n    implicitly accused the declarant of recently fabricating the statement or of\r\n    acting under an improper influence or motive, (3) the statement must be consistent with\r\n    the declarantâ€™s testimony, and (4)\r\n    the statement must have been made prior to the alleged fabrication, or prior to\r\n    the existence of the alleged improper influence or motive.\r\n\r\nState v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121-22, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001). \r\nBefore\r\n  we address these elements, we must first determine whether Clement is the\r\n  declarant.Â  We find Clement is the declarant because he made oral statements\r\n  intended to be assertions.Â  Rule 801(a), (b), SCRE (explaining that a statement\r\n  is an oral or written assertion intended to be an assertion and an individual\r\n  who makes a statement is a declarant).Â  With this is mind, we now turn our\r\n  attention to the elements set out in Saltz.\r\nIt\r\n  is undisputed that Clement testified and was subject to cross-examination; thus,\r\n  the first Saltz element is satisfied.Â  With respect to the second\r\n  element, opposing counsel implicitly accused Clement of acting under an\r\n  improper motive or influence by accusing Clement of lying in order to gain\r\n  favorable sentencing.Â  Specifically, at the time of his interview, Clement was\r\n  incarcerated for a forgery charge.Â  As noted above, Clement was involved in the robbery of the Distinguished\r\n  Gentlemen.Â  Patton became aware of\r\n  Clement through Clementâ€™s accomplice in the robbery of the Distinguished\r\n  Gentlemen.Â  Patton\r\n  interviewed Clement regarding the Distinguished\r\n  Gentlemen.Â  During\r\n  this interview, Clement revealed the details of the Blassingame robbery.Â  \r\nAs a result of his involvement in the two robberies, Clement was\r\n  at minimum facing the following charges: two armed robberies, two kidnappings,\r\n  conspiracy, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent\r\n  crime.Â  At the time of the trial, Clement had been sentenced on the conspiracy charge\r\n  and the possession charge, but he was still awaiting sentencing on the\r\n  remaining charges.Â  Counsel for the defense repeatedly accused Clement of being\r\n  untruthful in order to gain a more lenient sentence for the remaining charges.Â \r\n  Thus, the second Saltz element is fulfilled. \r\nThe\r\n  third element requires Clementâ€™s written statement be consistent with his trial\r\n  testimony.Â  This element is also met.Â  In his written statement, Clement stated\r\n  on the day of the Blassingame\r\n  robbery he went to Nanuâ€™s house and saw Nelson there.Â  Clement also stated Nanu\r\n  drove the four-member party to a location across the street from the Blassingame\r\n  barbershop, Nelson and Clovis were dropped off and entered the barbershop, and\r\n  Nanu drove repeatedly around the block until Nelson and Clovis exited the\r\n  barbershop and entered Nanuâ€™s car at the location where they originally exited\r\n  the vehicle.Â  Clement repeated this account during his testimony.Â  \r\nAlthough it is true during trial Clement did not remember a few of\r\n  the statements he made to Patton, we recognize two years passed between\r\n  Clementâ€™s statement to Patton and the trial.Â  The trial occurred on January 18,\r\n  2006, and Clement gave his statement to Patton on January 3, 2004.Â  We\r\n  acknowledge it could be difficult for Clement to recollect every detail due to this\r\n  two year time interval.Â  Additionally, viewing Clementâ€™s statement and his testimony\r\n  as a whole, we conclude his statement is consistent with his testimony.Â  \r\nThe final element that must be met is the statement must have been made prior to\r\n  the alleged fabrication or prior to the existence of the alleged improper\r\n  influence or motive.Â  Saltz, 346 S.C. at 121-22, 551 S.E.2d\r\n  at 244.Â  Nelson argues the statement to Patton was made after the existence of\r\n  a motive to fabricate, namely in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if we were to assume, without deciding, that Clement had an improper motive for\r\n  fabricating the truth, this motive did not arise until after the statement was\r\n  made.Â  As explained above, at the time of his interview, Clement was\r\n  incarcerated for a forgery charge.Â  Clement volunteered the information concerning the robberies of the\r\n  Distinguished Gentlemen and the Blassingame barbershop during an interview with Patton. Â The record is devoid of any evidence that\r\n  Patton made any offers of leniency in order to induce Clement to make the\r\n  statement.Â  State v. Serrette, 375 S.C. 650, 652, 654 S.E.2d 554, 555\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (stating the burden is on the appellant to provide an appellate\r\n  court with an adequate record for review); see Rule 210(h), SCACR (stating\r\n  an appellate court need not consider any fact which does not appear in the record).Â \r\n  Therefore, the final Saltz element is met, and the trial court properly\r\n  admitted the evidence based on Rule 801(d)(1)(B).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nTHOMAS\r\nand PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The names of the co-defendants are Lawrence Waller,\r\nalso known as Nanu (Nanu), and Lawrence Clovis (Clovis).Â  \r\n[2] The State argues this issue is not preserved for\r\n  review. We disagree.Â  An objection was raised regarding the admissibility of\r\n  Clementâ€™s written statement, and the trial court allowed the statement into\r\n  evidence based on Rule 801(d), SCRE.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497\r\n  S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding for an issue to be preserved for appeal it must have\r\n  been raised to and ruled upon by\r\nthe trial court).\r\n[3] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4424","title":"Semken v.

MichaelÂ  Taylor, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  In this family law action, Catherine Semken (Wife) appeals the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order terminating Francis Semkenâ€™s (Husband) obligation to pay\r\n  Wife alimony, awarding Husband reimbursement alimony, and requiring Wife to pay\r\n  Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife divorced in 1999.Â \r\n  Pursuant to the final order, Husband was required to pay Wife permanent\r\n  periodic alimony in the amount of $1,000 per month.Â  In 2005, Husband brought an\r\n  action to have his alimony obligation terminated pursuant to the continued\r\n  cohabitation provision of section 20-3-130(B)(1) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2007), claiming Wife and Thomas McGill (Boyfriend) had engaged in a\r\n  romantic relationship and resided together for a period of more than ninety\r\n  consecutive days. Â Wife and Boyfriend did not deny the romantic relationship,\r\n  but both disputed the claim of cohabitation.Â  Â Â \r\nIn support of Husbandâ€™s assertion, he presented evidence to show Wife\r\n  rented a house owned by Boyfriend in Berkeley County, South Carolina from\r\n  January 2002 through July 2005.Â  During this period, Boyfriend lived in\r\n  separate residences in other counties in the state.Â  Wife and Boyfriend\r\n  acknowledged they were involved in a romantic relationship during this time\r\n  period, and it was likely that over the course of their three-year relationship\r\n  the couple spent more than ninety non-consecutive days together in the Berkeley County residence.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough Wife paid Boyfriend $500 per month in rent, Wife and\r\n  Boyfriend never entered into a written lease agreement.Â  Boyfriendâ€™s mortgage\r\n  payment on the residence during this time period ranged from $550 to $625 per\r\n  month, but in exchange for the lesser rent, Wife did not have full access to the\r\n  house.Â  Boyfriend stored some of his belongings in one of the bedrooms of the\r\n  house and kept a car in the garage.Â Â Â  \r\nWhen Wife began renting the Berkeley County residence from\r\n  Boyfriend, she transferred all the utility bills into her name and made all of\r\n  the payments.Â  Boyfriend did not pay any of Wifeâ€™s expenses or help her\r\n  financially, although he would occasionally allow Wife to pay rent late or in\r\n  installments.Â  Boyfriend continued to pay insurance on the Berkeley County residence and its contents while Wife resided there, and he never changed the\r\n  status on his homeownerâ€™s insurance policy from owner-occupied to\r\n  rental-property.Â  Wife did not have any insurance on her belongings in the\r\n  residence. \r\n When\r\n  Wife moved into the Berkeley County residence, Boyfriend moved to North Augusta due to his employment.Â  Boyfriend obtained a new driverâ€™s license reflecting\r\n  his North Augusta address, and he registered to vote in Aiken County, South Carolina.Â  However, when Boyfriend later renewed his vehicle tag, he used the Berkeley County residence address and, pursuant to the â€œMotor Voterâ€ system, his voter\r\n  registration was automatically reinstated in Berkeley County.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter a\r\n  year in North Augusta, Boyfriend moved to Newberry County and began operating a\r\n  business out of this residence.Â  Subsequently, Boyfriend moved to Lexington County, which is where Boyfriend was living at the time he and Wife ended their\r\n  romantic relationship.Â  Following their break-up, Boyfriend allowed Wife to\r\n  stay in the Berkeley County residence rent-free for the three months prior to\r\n  her moving out because she lost her job and could not afford to pay rent.Â  \r\nUpon hearing the evidence, the family court found Husband had\r\n  carried his burden of proof to show Wife and Boyfriend engaged in continued\r\n  cohabitation for more than ninety days pursuant to Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1). Â The\r\n  family court interpreted Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1) by applying the ordinary meaning to\r\n  the word â€œresideâ€ and found during their romantic relationship, Boyfriend\r\n  maintained two residences, one of which was the Berkeley County residence.Â  The\r\n  family court stated, â€œIt is clear that [Boyfriend] has not spent every night\r\n  and day for [more] than 90 consecutive days with [Wife] at the Berkeley County home address but that is not what the statute requires.Â  The statute only\r\n  requires that [Boyfriend] â€˜resideâ€™ there at the same time with [Wife].â€Â  The\r\n  family court further found despite Wife and Boyfriend not spending more than\r\n  ninety consecutive days and nights under the same roof, â€œthey both claimed the Berkeley County home as a residence at the same time, spent a considerable amount of time\r\n  together, were romantically involved, and claimed the same home as a residence.â€Â \r\n  The family court additionally stated, â€œIt is critical to this decision to note\r\n  that if [Wife] had moved into an apartment owned by someone else (or even an\r\n  identified rental property owned by [Boyfriend]) rather than one of\r\n  [Boyfriendâ€™s] â€˜residences,â€™ there would have been a different outcome.â€Â  Â Â Â \r\nBased\r\n  on these findings, the family court terminated Husbandâ€™s obligation to pay Wife\r\n  alimony.Â  The family court further ordered Wife to reimburse Husband for\r\n  the alimony payments made from November 2005 through July 2006.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the family court required Wife to pay $10,000 towards Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this [C]ourt has jurisdiction to correct errors\r\n  of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.â€Â  Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 601-02, 510 S.E.2d\r\n  722, 724 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  A preponderance of the evidence stated simply is\r\n  that evidence which convinces as to its truth.Â  Frazier v. Frazier, 228\r\n  S.C. 149, 168, 89 S.E.2d 225, 235 (1955). Despite this broad scope of review,\r\n  this Court is not required to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Doe v.\r\n    Roe, 369 S.C. 351, 359, 631 S.E.2d 317, 321 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  This Court\r\n  remains mindful the family court saw and heard the witnesses, placing it in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\n  their testimony.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI. Termination of Alimony\r\n  Pursuant to Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1)\r\nWife begins by\r\n  arguing the family court erred in finding Wife engaged in continued\r\n  cohabitation with Boyfriend and, therefore, erred in terminating alimony.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  20-3-130(B)(1) allows for the termination of periodic alimony upon â€œthe\r\n  remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse . . . .â€Â  The statute\r\n  states:\r\n\r\n  For\r\n    purposes of this subsection and unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the\r\n    parties, â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ means the supported spouse resides with\r\n    another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more\r\n    consecutive days.Â  The court may determine that a continued cohabitation exists\r\n    if there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with another person in a\r\n    romantic relationship for periods of less than ninety days and the two\r\n    periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ§\r\n  20-3-130(B).Â  \r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court recently addressed the issue of terminating a husbandâ€™s alimony\r\n  obligation due to the wifeâ€™s continued cohabitation with another man pursuant\r\n  to section 20-3-150 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007).Â  Section 20-3-150\r\n  calls for any award of alimony to the spouse retaining custody of the coupleâ€™s\r\n  children to cease upon the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the\r\n  supported spouse.Â  Section 20-3-150 further states:\r\n\r\n  For\r\n    purposes of this subsection and unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the\r\n    parties, â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ means the supported spouse resides with\r\n    another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more\r\n    consecutive days.Â  The court may determine that a continued cohabitation exists\r\n    if there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with another person in a\r\n    romantic relationship for periods of less than ninety days and the two\r\n    periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen interpreting\r\n  this language, the South Carolina Supreme Court found â€œthe phrase â€˜resides\r\n  withâ€™ . . . sets forth a requirement that the supported spouse live under\r\n    the same roof as the person with whom they are romantically involved for at\r\n  least ninety consecutive days.â€Â  Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76,\r\n  89, 650 S.E.2d 465, 472 (2007) (emphasis added).Â  The Supreme Court reasoned\r\n  that â€œ[a]ny other interpretation essentially takes the â€˜cohabitationâ€™ out of\r\n  â€˜continued cohabitation.â€™â€Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  statute in question in the current case, Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1), contains the same\r\n  language as Â§ 20-3-150 defining â€œcontinued cohabitation.â€Â  Thus, the Supreme\r\n  Courtâ€™s interpretation of that language controls this Courtâ€™s determination of\r\n  whether Wife and Boyfriend engaged in continued cohabitation for ninety or more\r\n  consecutive days.Â  \r\n In the case at\r\n  hand, the family court addressed the meaning of â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ prior\r\n  to the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Strickland, focusing on the definition\r\n  of â€œresidence.â€Â  The family court stated it was applying the ordinary meaning\r\n  of the word â€œresideâ€ to the statute.Â Â Â  Â \r\nApplying\r\n  this interpretation to Wife and Boyfriendâ€™s situation, the family court found\r\n  Boyfriend â€œmaintained two residencesâ€ during their relationship, one of which\r\n  was the Berkeley County home where Wife resided.Â  The family court stated, â€œIt\r\n  is clear that [Boyfriend] has not spent every night and day for [more] than 90\r\n  consecutive days with [Wife] at the Berkeley County home address but that is\r\n  not what the statute requires.Â  The statute only requires that [Boyfriend]\r\n  â€˜resideâ€™ at the same time with [Wife].â€ Â The family court further emphasized\r\n  this interpretation by stating, \r\n\r\n  [E]ven\r\n    though [Wife] and [Boyfriend] did not spend more than 90 consecutive days and\r\n    nights under the same roof, it is clear that they both claimed the Berkeley\r\n    County home as a residence at the same time . . . .Â  It is critical to this\r\n    decision to note that if [Wife] had moved into an apartment owned by someone\r\n    else (or even an identified rental property owned by [Boyfriend]) rather than\r\n    one of [Boyfriendâ€™s] â€œresidences,â€ there would have been a different outcome.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court applied a meaning to the phrase â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ that requires\r\n  the spouse and the paramour to actually â€œlive under the same roofâ€ for ninety\r\n  consecutive days, rather then merely claim the same residence for that time\r\n  period.Â  Strickland, 375 S.C. at 89, 650 S.E.2d at 472. Â The family\r\n  court specifically found Wife and Boyfriend did not live under the same roof\r\n  for ninety consecutive days.Â  Further, the family court made no findings that\r\n  Wife and Boyfriend periodically separated in order to circumvent the ninety-day\r\n  requirement, and the facts do not warrant such a finding.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  evidence demonstrates Wife and Boyfriend were romantically involved but did not\r\n  engage in continued cohabitation, as defined by Strickland, during their\r\n  relationship.Â  The evidence shows Boyfriend did not live in under the same roof\r\n  as Wife for ninety consecutive days.Â  Pursuant to Strickland, Husband\r\n  has not proven that Wifeâ€™s relationship with Boyfriend amounts to â€œcontinued\r\n  cohabitationâ€ under Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1). Â We, therefore, reverse the family\r\n  courtâ€™s termination of alimony and reinstate Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  we find Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation was incorrectly terminated, Wife must be\r\n  restored to the position she was in before the family courtâ€™s judgment was\r\n  rendered.Â  See Brown v. Brown, 286 S.C. 56, 57, 331 S.E.2d 793,\r\n  793-94 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œGenerally, reversal of a judgment on appeal has the\r\n  effect of vacating the judgment and leaving the case standing as if no such\r\n  judgment had been rendered.â€).Â  â€œ[W]hen a judgment reducing support payments is\r\n  reversed on appeal, the parties are placed in the same position as if no\r\n  reduction had been ordered and the supporting spouse is liable for arrearages\r\n  from the date of the reduction to the date of reversal.â€Â  Id. at 57-58,\r\n  331 S.E.2d at 794.Â  Husband is, therefore, liable for any amount of alimony he\r\n  did not pay as a consequence of the family courtâ€™s ruling.Â  We remand the issue\r\n  of arrearages to the family court for a determination of the monetary amount owed\r\n  to Wife, as well as a determination of an appropriate payment schedule for\r\n  Husband to follow.Â  \r\nII. Termination of Alimony\r\n  Pursuant to Additional Sustaining Ground\r\nHusband argues even\r\n  if this Court finds the statutory requirements of Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1) have not\r\n  been satisfied, an alternate sustaining ground exists to terminate Husbandâ€™s\r\n  alimony obligation.Â  Husband specifically argues Wifeâ€™s relationship with\r\n  Boyfriend was tantamount to marriage, warranting a termination of alimony due\r\n  to a change in Wifeâ€™s circumstances.Â  We decline to address this issue.Â  \r\nAs the prevailing\r\n  party in the family court, a respondent may raise an additional sustaining\r\n  ground for this Court to consider.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).Â  This Court, however, may\r\n  ignore any such arguments, especially if the additional ground was not\r\n  presented to the family court.Â  Id. at 421, 526 S.E.2d at 724. Â â€œ[T]he\r\n  current rules do not impose any presentation requirement.Â  However, the failure\r\n  to present an additional sustaining ground to the [family] court reduces the\r\n  likelihood an appellate court will rely on it to affirm a judgment.â€Â  Id. at 421 n.11, 526 S.E.2d at 724 n.11.Â  \r\n In the family\r\n  court, Husband stated he sought to have his alimony obligation terminated based\r\n  solely on the statutory ground found in Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1).Â  The parties never\r\n  mentioned or discussed terminating alimony based on the common law argument of\r\n  Wifeâ€™s relationship with Boyfriend being tantamount to marriage.Â  This argument\r\n  is being raised for the first time in this appeal.Â  Although South Carolina\r\n  court rules allow Husband as the prevailing party to initially raise this\r\n  additional sustaining ground in his appeal, we decline to rely on this ground\r\n  as a means of affirming the family courtâ€™s order, as we find it would be unfair\r\n  to Wife because this argument was not presented to the family court. Â Â Â \r\nIII.\r\n  Reimbursement of Alimony\r\nBecause\r\n  we find alimony should not be terminated, Wife must be restored to the position\r\n  she was in before the family courtâ€™s judgment was rendered.Â  See Brown,\r\n  286 S.C. at 57, 331 S.E.2d at 793-94 (â€œGenerally, reversal of a judgment on\r\n  appeal has the effect of vacating the judgment and leaving the case standing as\r\n  if no such judgment had been rendered.â€).Â  Consequently, Wife should not be\r\n  ordered to reimburse Husband for any alimony payments made while the action was\r\n  pending.[1]Â \r\n  Therefore, consistent with this opinion, we reverse the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  for reimbursement.Â Â  \r\nIV. Attorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nFinally, Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in ordering her to contribute to Husbandâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife also argues the family court erred in failing to order\r\n  Husband to contribute towards her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In light of our decision to\r\n  reverse the family courtâ€™s termination of Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation, we\r\n  similarly reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and remand the issue for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993) (reversing and remanding issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for\r\n  reconsideration when the substantive results achieved by trial counsel were\r\n  reversed on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED and\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTHOMAS and\r\nPIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] After terminating Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation, the\r\n  family court ordered Wife to reimburse Husband for alimony payments made from\r\nNovember 15, 2005, through July 15, 2006, which totaled $9,450.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4425","title":"McNair v.

Koon and Paul D. de Holczer,\r\n          of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Thomas H. Pope, III, of Newberry, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J.:Â  This appeal arises\r\n  out of Fairfield Countyâ€™s attempt to condemn private property owned by E.\r\n  Chandler McNair.Â  McNair filed a complaint challenging the Countyâ€™s right to\r\n  condemn the property, and after receiving inadequate responses to his requests\r\n  for discovery, McNair moved for sanctions.Â  The trial court granted the motion,\r\n  struck the Countyâ€™s answer, and dismissed the condemnation action with\r\n  prejudice.Â  The County appeals, and we affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn September of 2005, Fairfield County served a condemnation notice on McNair, informing him the County intended to\r\n  condemn a tract of land he owned adjacent to the Fairfield County Airport.Â  Purportedly, the taking was necessary to extend one of the runways at the\r\n  airport so it could accommodate large, commercial airplanes.Â  McNair challenged\r\n  the condemnation, and in November of 2005, McNair sent the County discovery\r\n  requests.Â  On February 10, 2006, the County produced over 800 documents of\r\n  discovery.Â  Two weeks later, McNair filed a motion to compel, alleging the\r\n  County failed to produce certain documents, had not coherently organized the\r\n  documents it did produce, and had provided incomplete responses to his\r\n  interrogatories.Â  \r\nThe trial court issued an order on April 20, 2006, finding the\r\n  County failed to respond to McNairâ€™s First Request for Production and that the\r\n  Countyâ€™s responses to Plaintiffâ€™s First Set of Interrogatories was deficient.Â \r\n  The court did not impose any sanctions but ordered the County to correct its\r\n  discovery responses within fifteen days. \r\nDespite this directive from the trial court, the County made no\r\n  attempt to correct the deficiencies in its discovery responses.Â  McNairâ€™s\r\n  counsel wrote six letters requesting the County comply with the order, and\r\n  finally moved for dismissal and/or sanctions against the County on October 16,\r\n  2006, six months after the order compelling discovery had been issued. \r\nA hearing on the motion was convened on November 15, and upon the\r\n  promise of the Countyâ€™s attorney to have the discovery problems resolved within\r\n  a month, the hearing was continued until December.Â  At the December hearing,\r\n  with no progress made toward correcting the discovery issues, the Countyâ€™s\r\n  attorney explained its noncompliance with the discovery order was because of a\r\n  funding deadline imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA).Â \r\n  Apparently, the FAA intended to have substantial progress completed on the\r\n  runway extension project by October of 2006, and because that had not occurred,\r\n  the FAA was threatening to withdraw funding for the project.Â  With funding for\r\n  the project in jeopardy, the County was wary of spending additional money to\r\n  litigate the condemnation challenge.Â  Counsel for the County urged the trial\r\n  court to allow him to prepare a scheduling order rather than striking the\r\n  answer. Counsel explained such an order would aid him in his negotiations with\r\n  the FAA.Â  The trial court warned it was inclined to strike the answer, but in\r\n  hopes of resolving the problem amicably, granted the parties forty-five days\r\n  â€œto reach some kind of an accord,â€ and if they could not, to submit proposed\r\n  orders within that time.Â  \r\nOn the forty-fifth day after the December hearing, the trial\r\n  court, having never received a proposed order from the County, issued an order\r\n  striking the Countyâ€™s answer to the condemnation challenge and dismissing with\r\n  prejudice the Countyâ€™s condemnation action. Four days later, on February 6,\r\n  2007, the County submitted a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion along with a proposed\r\n  scheduling order.Â  In its motion, the County asked the court to reconsider the\r\n  order striking the Countyâ€™s answer in light of the belated scheduling order.Â  \r\nÂ At the hearing on the Countyâ€™s motion, McNair presented a letter\r\n  from the FAA dated February 5, 2007, which indicated the FAA intended to\r\n  withdraw its funding for the Fairfield County Airport runway extension project\r\n  unless the land acquisition portion of the project was completed within ninety\r\n  days.Â  The County admitted it would not be able to resolve the challenge action\r\n  within the time parameters imposed by the FAA.[1]Â  \r\nThe trial court found no basis for reconsidering its previous\r\n  order. The court also noted its decision to strike the answer and dismiss the\r\n  condemnation action would not have changed even if Fairfield County had timely submitted the proposed scheduling order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 37(b)(2)(C), SCRCP, when a party fails to comply with a discovery order,\r\n  the trial court has the discretion to impose a sanction it deems just,\r\n  including an order dismissing the action.Â  Barnette v. Adams Bros. Logging,\r\n    Inc., 355 S.C. 588, 593, 586 S.E.2d 572, 575 (2003). Â Absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion, the trial courtâ€™s imposition of discovery sanctions will not be\r\n  reversed on appeal, and the party appealing from the order of sanction carries\r\n  the burden of proving an abuse of discretion occurred.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFairfield County argues the trial court erred by granting McNairâ€™s motion for sanctions and\r\n  denying its Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, the\r\n  County argues the trial court abused its discretion by signing McNairâ€™s\r\n  proposed order forty-six minutes before the close of business on the day the\r\n  proposed orders were due, without first reviewing the Countyâ€™s proposed\r\n  scheduling order.Â  This argument has no merit for two reasons.Â  First, the\r\n  County failed to timely submit a scheduling order, so even if the trial court had\r\n  waited until 5:00 p.m., it still would not have had the benefit of a proposed order\r\n  from the County.Â  Second, in the courtâ€™s order denying the countyâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion,\r\n  the court took the scheduling order into consideration and adhered to its\r\n  initial order.Â Â  Because waiting until the close of business before issuing its\r\n  order would not have made a difference, the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion by issuing its order before the time for presenting a proposed order\r\n  had elapsed.Â  See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26,\r\n  28 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œ[W]hatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t matter.â€).\r\nCounty also argues\r\n  the trial court abused its discretion because striking the Countyâ€™s answer was\r\n  unreasonably harsh under the circumstances.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs stated above,\r\n  sanctions for discovery abuse are left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court.Â  See Barnette, 355 S.C. at 593, 586 S.E.2d at 575. However,\r\n  severe sanctions, such as the dismissal of an action, should only be imposed in\r\n  cases involving bad faith, willful disobedience, or gross indifference to the\r\n  opposing partyâ€™s rights.Â  See Orlando v. Boyd, 320 S.C.\r\n  509, 511, 466 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1996); Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,\r\n  306 S.C. 101, 108-09, 410 S.E.2d 537, 541-42 (1991); Griffin Grading &amp;\r\n    Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., 334 S.C. 193, 198-99, 511\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 719 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nAfter deciding to\r\n  strike the Countyâ€™s answer, the trial court noted:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    defense still has not produced documents 7 Â½ months after this Court passed an\r\n    Order granting plaintiffâ€™s motion to compel.Â  The delay caused by defendant is\r\n    a further prejudice to plaintiffâ€™s right to have his claim heard. Â . . . \r\n  The\r\n    defendant is to blame for this unconscionable delay, and the defendantâ€™s\r\n    conduct amounts to contempt.Â  This Court has considered whether a sanction less\r\n    than striking the Answer in this case would achieve justice, and this Court\r\n    concludes not.Â  . . . \r\n  The\r\n    defendantâ€™s conduct in refusing to provide that which it has been ordered to\r\n    produce is a serious affront to the integrity of the judicial system.Â  . . .Â \r\n    The defendantâ€™s failure to make any attempt to comply with the court order\r\n    compelling discovery is a blatant violation of Rule 37(b)(2), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n In addition to the\r\n  explicit findings above, we note the trial court warned the County during the\r\n  December hearing it was inclined to strike the Countyâ€™s Answer.Â  Despite this\r\n  warning, the County failed to submit a proposed scheduling order within\r\n  forty-five days.Â  Furthermore, at the reconsideration hearing, the County was\r\n  no closer to resolving the funding issues than it had been a year before, when\r\n  the order compelling discovery had been issued.\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  determining the appropriateness of a sanction, the court should consider such\r\n  factors as the precise nature of the discovery and the discovery posture of the\r\n  case, willfulness, and degree of prejudice.â€ Â Griffin Grading &amp;\r\n    Clearing, Inc., 334 S.C. at 199, 511 S.E.2d at 719. Here, the trial court considered\r\n  the appropriate factors, and determined the Countyâ€™s willful disobedience of\r\n  previous orders warranted the severe sanction of dismissal.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough we\r\n  recognize the penalty is harsh, we find the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in striking the Countyâ€™s answer and dismissing the condemnation\r\n  action.Â  To the extent Fairfield County raises additional arguments in its\r\n  brief,[2] we find they are not preserved for our review because they were never raised to\r\n  or ruled upon by the trial court.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3] \r\nKONDUROS, J.,\r\nand GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Based upon memoranda submitted by counsel following\r\nthis courtâ€™s inquiry, this matter is not moot. \r\n[2] Specifically, the following arguments were never\r\n  raised to the trial court: (1) the order contained internal inconsistencies\r\n  regarding the reason the Countyâ€™s conduct constituted discovery abuse; (2) the\r\n  trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a factual hearing before\r\n  dismissing the condemnation action; (3) the trial court erred by failing to\r\n  hold a hearing before concluding the County had no public purpose, benefit, or\r\n  use in condemning the land; (4) the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  dismissing the condemnation action because this â€œarguablyâ€ forecloses the\r\n  County from ever improving its County Airport; (5) the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion by finding the County in contempt without holding a factual hearing;\r\n  (6) the trial courtâ€™s assumption that FAA funds would be withdrawn was not\r\n  supported by competent evidence; and (7) the trial courtâ€™s finding that the\r\n  County refused to produce voluminous documents was not supported by competent\r\nevidence.\r\n[3]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4426","title":"Mozingo & Wallace v.

Derrick Mozingo, Jr., principal architect with Mozingo\r\n  &amp; Wallace, met with George B. Buchanan, Jr. and Benji Norton of Patricia\r\n  Grand to discuss renovations to a hotel now known as Monterey Bay.Â  Buchanan expressed his admiration of two of Mozingo &amp; Wallaceâ€™s similar projects.Â  He\r\n  indicated he wanted a â€œSouth Floridaâ€ look for the hotel.Â  Although Mozingo\r\n  asked Buchanan what his budget was for the project, Buchanan did not have an\r\n  answer for him. \r\nThe parties\r\n  subsequently entered into a contract for Mozingo &amp; Wallace to perform the\r\n  schematic design work for the exterior of the building.Â  Although Mozingo\r\n  stated in the cover letter for the contract that the submittals and approvals\r\n  would be ready no later than the third week of November, the parties did not\r\n  meet until December 12.Â  At that meeting Mozingo presented two designs for the\r\n  project, a â€œModernâ€ theme and a â€œMediterraneanâ€ theme.Â  During the meeting\r\n  Buchanan also requested Mozingo design a renovation of the lobby and laundry\r\n  facility.Â  In his follow-up letter dated December 13, 2001, Mozingo noted the\r\n  parties had agreed to move forward on the development of the â€œMediterraneanâ€ theme\r\n  and the interior work.Â  He explained Mozingo &amp; Wallace would not be able to\r\n  commence work on the exterior and interior projects until after the first of\r\n  the year.Â  In addition, he stated the work presented at the meeting completed\r\n  the work under the original contract agreement. Â The next day Mozingo &amp;\r\n  Wallace sent Patricia Grand an invoice for the services to date.Â  The work on\r\n  the interior renovation was invoiced as an additional expense at the\r\n  contractual hourly rates.Â  Mozingo &amp; Wallace also enclosed a contract for\r\n  the balance of the work on the interior and exterior renovations.Â  The contract\r\n  included a work schedule for the renovations.Â  Patricia Grand never executed\r\n  this contract.Â  \r\nIn a letter dated\r\n  December 27, 2001, Buchannan wrote Mozingo that he had not approved the design\r\n  and that approval would depend on obtaining acceptable cost parameters and\r\n  permission from the city for the improvements.Â  He listed six changes he felt\r\n  should be considered.Â  In a reply letter, Mozingo stated he had no problem with\r\n  the requested changes but would need to review the items with Buchanan.Â  At\r\n  Buchananâ€™s insistence, Mozingo submitted the schematics of the exterior renovation\r\n  to a contractor for an estimate.Â  The contractor, however, indicated there was\r\n  not enough detailed information to provide a ballpark figure.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  letter dated January 11, 2002, Buchanan expressed his concern that the projects\r\n  were getting behind and it might not be feasible to complete them that spring.Â \r\n  In response, Mozingo sent him schedules for the interior and exterior\r\n  renovations.Â  On January 15, Buchanan ordered Mozingo by fax to put on hold\r\n  work on the exterior renovation and they would consider the job for the\r\n  following winter.Â  He also advised that he would hold off on a decision on the\r\n  interior work until an opinion was obtained from the city regarding approval\r\n  for the project.Â  Mozingo responded that he was concerned by the tone of\r\n  Buchannanâ€™s note.Â  He explained he could have all submittals and approvals in\r\n  place already but Buchanan had insisted on obtaining an estimate from a\r\n  contractor before proceeding.Â  In addition, Mozingo stated that he never\r\n  thought that construction on the exterior renovation could be competed before\r\n  the summer season but he believed the work would have very little impact on the\r\n  hotel guests.Â  However, he did assure Buchanan that the interior renovation\r\n  could be accomplished before Memorial Day.Â  \r\nIn a letter dated\r\n  February 11, 2002, Buchanan expressed his dissatisfaction over the exterior and\r\n  interior renovations.Â  He stated he found both proposed plans for the exterior\r\n  renovation to be impractical and that Mozingo had failed to deliver acceptable\r\n  plans that could be completed during the slow months of January and February.Â \r\n  In addition, he noted he was unhappy with the delay with the interior\r\n  renovation but wanted to continue on a fast-track basis.Â  He proposed to\r\n  renegotiate the contract for the projects, including evenly allocating the\r\n  $25,000 already paid between the two projects.Â  Mozingo took exception at the tone\r\n  of the letter and terminated his services.Â  He demanded full payment of the\r\n  invoice for services to date.Â  In return, Buchanan demanded a refund of\r\n  $22,955.00.Â  \r\nMozingo &amp;\r\n  Wallace filed a notice and certificate of Mechanicâ€™s lien listing $14,173.47 as\r\n  the amount due.Â  It subsequently brought this action seeking foreclosure of the\r\n  lien, collection, and quantum meruit.Â  Patricia Grand denied Mozingo &amp;\r\n  Wallaceâ€™s entitlement to the relief sought and counterclaimed for breach of\r\n  contract.Â  The trial court found in favor of Mozingo &amp; Wallace and awarded\r\n  it $24,563.81 for architectural fees and interest accrued at the 18% rate set\r\n  forth in the contract.Â  In addition, the court awarded Mozingo &amp; Wallace\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $17,975.57.Â  On Patricia Grandâ€™s motion to\r\n  alter or amend, the court reduced the attorney fee award to $14,177.47, the\r\n  amount stated in the notice and certificate of lien.Â  Both Patricia Grand and\r\n  Mozingo &amp; Wallace appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn\r\n  action to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien is an action at law.Â  Seckinger v.\r\n    Vessel Excalibur, 326 S.C. 382, 386, 483 S.E.2d 775, 777 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œIn\r\n  an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of\r\n  fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs. v.\r\nCity of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;Patricia Grandâ€™s appeal\r\nPatricia\r\n  Grand argues the trial court erred in finding Mozingo &amp; Wallace complied\r\n  with its obligations under the contract since it did not complete the scope of\r\n  services required by the contract.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA party who seeks\r\n  to recover damages for breach of a contract must show that the contract has\r\n  been performed on his part, or at least that he was, at the appropriate time,\r\n  able, ready and willing to perform it.Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 487, 514 S.E.2d 126, 135 (1999).Â  Patricia Grand\r\n  first contends Mozingo &amp; Wallace did not complete its preparation of the\r\n  exterior design schematics as it never made the revisions requested by Patricia\r\n  Grand.Â  After Buchanan requested Mozingo make six revisions to the schematics,\r\n  Mozingo agreed to make the changes.Â  However, he admitted at trial that he\r\n  never did in fact make the revisions.Â  Mozingo explained all of the changes\r\n  Buchanan requested involved simply deleting certain things or changing or\r\n  painting certain items.Â  He stated that he felt like all of the changes would\r\n  be addressed or should be addressed in the second phase of the base contract.Â \r\n  Patricia Grand, however, ordered Mozingo &amp; Wallace to stop work on the\r\n  exterior renovation before it could progress to the second phase.Â  Thus,\r\n  Patricia Grandâ€™s own acts prevented Mozingo &amp; Wallace from completing the\r\n  revision.Â  See Moon v.

App. 1990)Â  (â€œGenerally, if a party by his contract charges himself\r\n  with an obligation possible to be performed, he must make it good unless its\r\n  performance is rendered impossible by an act of God, the law, or other party.â€)Â \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nNext Patricia Grand\r\n  contends Mozingo &amp; Wallace did not complete all the tasks required by the\r\n  contract with respect to the Myrtle Beach Community Appearance Board (CAB).Â \r\n  The contractâ€™s â€œScope of Designated Servicesâ€ included CAB review submittals\r\n  and approvals for the exterior project.Â  Mozingo testified he was ready to take\r\n  the schematics for the exterior renovation to CAB for review but he was never\r\n  given the directive to do such because of the indecision with the project.Â  He\r\n  stated he needed both Patricia Grandâ€™s final approval of the conceptual design,\r\n  as well as a current as-built survey from Patricia Grand before he could submit\r\n  plans to CAB.Â  He received neither.Â  Thus, there is evidence in the record that\r\n  Mozingo &amp; Wallaceâ€™s failure to complete this aspect of the contract was due\r\n  to Patricia Grandâ€™s acts.Â  \r\nFinally, Patricia\r\n  Grand asserts the conceptual design did not comply with relevant zoning\r\n  ordinances.Â  Certain decorative items in the design may have protruded over the\r\n  set-back limits set forth in the ordinance.Â  Mozingo testified that without a\r\n  current as-built survey, which Patricia Grand never supplied, he was not exactly\r\n  sure there would be a problem with the setbacks and he felt it was probably\r\n  close to being within the allowed area.Â  He stated if the decorative items did\r\n  protrude past the setback lines by a few inches, Patricia Grand would need a\r\n  variance.Â  However, he stated he did not see obtaining a variance as a problem,\r\n  just a process.Â  \r\nWe find the record\r\n  provides evidence that Mozingo &amp; Wallace fulfilled its responsibilities\r\n  under the contract or was prevented from doing so by Patricia Grandâ€™s own\r\n  acts.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court allowing Mozingo &amp;\r\n  Wallace to recover under the contract.Â  \r\nAt oral argument,\r\n  Patricia Grand asserted that under section 12.2.8 of the contract, it was\r\n  entitled to equitable adjustment for the work Mozingo &amp; Wallace failed to\r\n  perform.Â  This issue is not properly before this court.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 250, 551\r\n  S.E.2d 274, 278 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAn appellant may not use oral argument as a\r\n  vehicle to argue issues not argued in the appellantâ€™s brief.â€); Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set\r\n  forth in the statement of issues on appeal.â€).\r\nPatricia\r\n  Grand argues the trial court erred in awarding Mozingo &amp; Wallace attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees because once Patricia Grand filed a surety bond, the lien was terminated\r\n  and Mozingo &amp; Wallace could not prevail in an action to terminate the\r\n  lien.Â  This argument was never raised to or ruled on by the trial court.Â \r\n  Accordingly, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.\r\n    Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that\r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.â€).Â  \r\nNext\r\n  Patricia Grand argues the trial court should have awarded it attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  rather than Mozingo &amp; Wallace because Mozingo &amp; Wallace cannot be the\r\n  prevailing party as it failed to complete the tasks it agreed to perform.Â  As\r\n  stated above, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Mozingo &amp;\r\n  Wallace was entitled to recover under the contract.Â  Therefore, we find no\r\n  merit in Patricia Grandâ€™s argument regarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n2. Mozingo &amp; Wallaceâ€™s appeal\r\nMozingo\r\n  &amp; Wallace argues the trial court erred in reducing the award of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees to the principal debt recited in the notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s\r\n  lien.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien statute provides the prevailing party may recover reasonable\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, â€œbut the fee and the court costs may not exceed the amount of\r\n  the lien.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (a) (2007).Â  â€œThe primary rule of\r\n  statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the\r\n  legislature.â€Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington v. Altman, 324 S.C.\r\n  65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  â€œ[T]he words of the statute must be given\r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced\r\n  construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€ Â Mun. Assâ€™n of\r\n    S.C. v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical,\r\n  reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and\r\n  policy of lawmakers.â€Â  TNS Mills v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611,\r\n  624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).\r\nWe hold the\r\n  legislature intended to limit the award of fees and costs to the amount set\r\n  forth in the notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  This limit on the\r\n  amount of the award applies not only to a party prevailing in enforcing a lien\r\n  but also to a party prevailing in defending the lien action.Â  It would not be\r\n  reasonable for a party enforcing the lien to be able to recover higher\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees if it prevailed because it could add prejudgment interest to\r\n  the lien award but limit a defending party if it prevailed to the debt stated\r\n  in the notice and certificate of lien.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court\r\n  properly reduced the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded to the amount of the\r\n  debt set forth in the notice and certificate of lien.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial\r\n  court did not err in allowing Mozingo &amp; Wallace to recover under the\r\n  contract.Â  As the prevailing party, Mozingo &amp; Wallace was entitled to\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In addition, we hold the trial court correctly reduced the\r\n  amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded to the amount of the debt stated in the\r\n  notice and certificate of lien.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nand GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4427","title":"M&M Group, Inc. v.

Kopatch[1] d/b/a Empire Business Brokers, Empire Business Brokerage, LLC, and Gregory M.\r\n  Kopatch.Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nM&amp;M Group, Inc. (â€œM&amp;Mâ€) was the owner of a carwash and\r\n  lube business located in Mt. Pleasant. Â Wishing to sell the business and its\r\n  assets, M&amp;M signed an exclusive Listing Agreement with Gregory Kopatch\r\n  (Kopatch), a commercial sales broker doing business as Empire Business\r\n  Brokerage, L.L.C. (Brokerage). Â Pursuant to the Listing Agreement, the\r\n  Brokerage would sell the business and M&amp;M would then pay a commission to\r\n  the Brokerage.\r\nKopatch identified Suzette Holmes (â€œHolmesâ€) as a potential buyer,\r\n  and on April 12, 2005, M&amp;M and Holmes executed a sales contract\r\n  (â€œContractâ€).Â  Under the terms of the Contract, M&amp;M agreed to transfer its\r\n  assets to Holmes in exchange for Holmesâ€™ payment of $675,000 to M&amp;M. Â The\r\n  first page of the Contract stated, â€œ[w]hereas, the parties agree that Buyerâ€™s\r\n  obligation to purchase the assets of the business and Sellerâ€™s obligation to\r\n  sell the assets is contingent upon Buyerâ€™s ability to secure commercial\r\n  financing at prevailing interest rates.â€ Â The Contract provided that Holmes was\r\n  to secure $225,000 of the purchase price through commercial financing and\r\n  M&amp;M was to finance $250,000 with a sixty-month promissory note.Â  The seven\r\n  page Contract also set the closing date as May 22, 2005, and stated that time was\r\n  of the essence.[3] \r\nOn May 9, 2005, Holmesâ€™ request for a loan was denied. Â No\r\n  closing occurred on May 22, 2005, and the sales transaction was never\r\n  consummated thereafter.Â  An affidavit by M&amp;Mâ€™s President, Sean Mummert, states\r\n  the Brokerage called him on May 22 and told him a proposed lender needed\r\n  additional information from Holmes before it would approve her financing\r\n  request.Â  Mummert affirms he told the Brokerage he would grant Holmes an\r\n  extension in order for her to obtain financing needed to complete the\r\n  transaction.Â  No further communication occurred until October 12, 2005, when\r\n  M&amp;M received a letter informing them the proposed transaction was voided\r\n  when Holmes was unable to obtain financing. Â A bank turndown letter\r\n  regarding the May 9th denial of Holmesâ€™ loan request was also\r\n  attached to the October 12th letter.\r\nOn November 14, 2005, M&amp;M filed a complaint alleging breach of\r\n  contract against Holmes as well as breach of fiduciary duty, breach of\r\n  contract, and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act against\r\n  Kopatch and the Brokerage. Holmes subsequently filed a Motion for Summary\r\n  Judgment which was heard by the trial court on March 16, 2007. Â Ruling from the\r\n  bench, the trial court granted Holmesâ€™ summary judgment motion.Â  M&amp;M now\r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing an order for summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56 of the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Town of Awendaw, 359 S.C. 29, 34, 596 S.E.2d 482, 485&nbsp;(2004). &nbsp;Summary judgment is\r\n  appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.â€&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; â€œOn appeal from\r\n  an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all\r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a\r\n  light most favorable to the appellant, the non-moving party below.â€Â  Willis\r\n    v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not\r\n  require the services of a fact finder.â€ George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440,\r\n  452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). Â â€œA court considering summary judgment neither\r\n  makes factual determinations nor considers the merits of competing testimony;\r\n  however, summary judgment is completely appropriate when a properly supported\r\n  motion sets forth facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient\r\n  manner.â€ David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  1, 5&nbsp;(2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI. Motion for\r\n  Summary Judgment\r\nM&amp;M\r\n  contends the trial court erred by granting Holmes summary judgment in light of\r\n  the fact that Holmesâ€™ motion failed to state with particularity the grounds for\r\n  summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nHolmesâ€™\r\n  motion for summary judgment stated, â€œ[t]he grounds for this motion shall be set forth in a\r\n  Memorandum of Law to be timely filed with supporting documents and affidavits\r\n  as required.â€Â  No such memorandum was filed with the trial court or provided to\r\n  M&amp;M.Â  At the summary judgment hearing, M&amp;M objected to the hearing\r\n  itself since Holmes failed to follow Rule 7(b)(1)[4] of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure.Â  However, M&amp;M did not ask the trial court for any sort of relief\r\n  or request the motion be dismissed or continued in order to better prepare for\r\n  the motion. M&amp;M simply objected to the hearing.[5] The trial court evidently assumed\r\n  M&amp;M was making such a motion for a continuance and denied it.Â  M&amp;M now\r\n  appeals claiming it was â€œunable to properly prepare for arguing the Motion for\r\n  Summary Judgment.â€Â  \r\nM&amp;M correctly asserts Holmes did not comply with the technical\r\n  requirements of Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  However, M&amp;M did not argue at the\r\n  trial court that Holmesâ€™ failure to follow Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, prejudiced it\r\n  or caused unfair surprise in any way.Â  As such, we find M&amp;Mâ€™s current argument\r\n  of prejudice is not preserved for our review. Staubes v. City of Folly Beach,\r\n  339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nWere we to consider the merits of this argument, this Court would\r\n  be forced to find M&amp;M cannot make the requisite showing of prejudice\r\n  necessary to reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of a continuance.Â  The grant or\r\n  denial of a continuanceÂ  lies with the sound discretion of the trial court and\r\n  such ruling will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Tanner, 299\r\n  S.C. 459, 462, 385 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1989).Â  â€œMoreover, the denial of a motion for a continuance on the\r\n  ground that counsel has not had time to prepare is rarely disturbed on appeal.â€ Plyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007).Â  M&amp;M\r\n  has demonstrated no such prejudice at either the trial court or this court.\r\nII. Condition\r\n  Precedent Located in a Recital\r\nM&amp;M\r\n  contends the contingency in Paragraph 4 of the Contract is a recital and cannot\r\n  be construed as a condition precedent.Â  M&amp;M further argues summary judgment\r\n  was inappropriate because the placement of a contingency in a recital clause\r\n  creates a question of fact as to whether a condition precedent existed at all.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nParagraph\r\n  4 of the Contract states, in full, â€œ[w]hereas, the parties agree that Buyerâ€™s\r\n  obligation to purchase the assets of the business and Sellerâ€™s obligation to\r\n  sell the assets is contingent upon Buyerâ€™s ability to secure commercial\r\n  financing at prevailing interest rates.â€Â  The Contract also contains a section\r\n  entitled â€œContingencies.â€Â  Language similar to Paragraph 4 does not appear in\r\n  the â€œContingenciesâ€ section; however, the Contract itself states the headings\r\n  do not define, limit, or describe the scope or intent of the Contractâ€™s\r\n  provisions.[6]Â  \r\nBlackâ€™s\r\n  Law Dictionary defines â€œrecitalâ€ as â€œ[a]n account or description of some fact\r\n  or thing; â€¦[a] preliminary statement in a contract or deed explaining the background\r\n  of the transaction or showing the existence of particular facts.â€Â  (7th ed. 2000).Â  Recitals also traditionally begin with the word â€œwhereas.â€ Blackâ€™s\r\n  Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004).Â  Although whereas clauses typically\r\n  describe the background leading to a contract, the foremost rule of contract\r\n  interpretation is that courts â€œmust give effect to the intentions of the\r\n  parties by looking to the language of the contract.â€ Moser v. Gosnell,\r\n  334 S.C. 425, 430, 513 S.E.2d 123, 125 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Conner v.\r\n    Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 101, 328 S.E.2d 334, 336 (1985)); see Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 199 S.E.2d 719 (1973)\r\n  (holding the intention of an instrument is determined by its language,\r\n  regardless of whether such language is in a whereas clause; language in a\r\n  recital clearly set forth an agreementâ€™s purpose as a modification); Horry\r\n    v. Frost, 10 Rich. Eq. 109, 1858 WL 3728 (Ct. App. Eq. 1858) (â€œA covenant may be as obligatory when expressed by way of recital as if expressed in the formal part of the agreement.â€).\r\nâ€œTo discover the intention of a contract, the court must first\r\n  look to its language â€“ if the language is perfectly plain and capable of legal\r\n  construction, it alone determines the document's force and effect.â€ Ecclesiastes\r\n    Production Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., L.L.C., 374 S.C. 483, 498, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 494, 501 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Superior Auto. Ins., 261 S.C. at\r\n  263, 199 S.E.2d at 722); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 93, 594\r\n  S.E.2d 485, 493 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIf its language is plain, unambiguous, and\r\n  capable of only one reasonable interpretation, no construction is required and\r\n  the contract's language determines the instrument's force and effect.â€).Â  If\r\n  practical, documents will be interpreted to give effect to all of their\r\n  provisions. Ecclesiastes, 374 S.C. at 498, 649 S.E.2d at 502 (citations\r\n  omitted); Brady v. Brady, 222 S.C. 242, 246-47, 72 S.E.2d 193, 195\r\n  (1952).\r\nThe primary test of a contractâ€™s character is â€œthe intention of\r\n  the parties, such intention to be gathered from the whole scope and effect of\r\n  the language used.â€ Barnacle Broadcasting, Inc. v. Baker Broadcasting, Inc.,\r\n  343 S.C. 140, 147, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000). Â â€œThe question of\r\n  whether a provision in a contract constitutes a condition precedent is a\r\n  question of construction dependent on the intent of the parties to be gathered from\r\n  the language they employ.â€Â  Brewer v. Stokes Kia, Isuzu, Subaru, Inc.,\r\n  364 S.C. 444, 449, 613 S.E.2d 802, 805 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted). Â â€œIn\r\n  ascertaining intent, the court will strive to discover the situation of the\r\n  parties, along with their purposes at the time the contract was entered.â€ Ellie,\r\n  358 S.C. at 94, 594 S.E.2d at 493.Â  Parties are governed by their outward\r\n  expressions and the court is not free to consider their secret intentions. Id. at 94, 594 S.C. at 494.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Paragraph 4 clearly states, â€œthe parties agree that Buyerâ€™s obligation to purchase\r\n  the assets of the business and Sellerâ€™s obligation to sell the assets is\r\n    contingent upon Buyerâ€™s ability to secure commercial financing.â€ (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The use of the language â€œis contingent uponâ€ is unequivocal and\r\n  patently indicates the partiesâ€™ respective obligations to buy and sell the\r\n  business are contingent on Holmesâ€™ ability to secure financing.Â  No other\r\n  meaning could be deduced from such clear and commonly used language.Â  â€œWhen a contract is clear and unambiguous, the construction\r\n  of the contract is a question of law for the court.â€ Moser, 334 S.C. at\r\n  430, 513 S.E.2d at 125 (citing Conner, 285 S.C. at 101, 328 S.E.2d at\r\n  336).Â  Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that Paragraph 4 of the\r\n  Contract contains a condition precedent.Â  We will now discuss whether such\r\n  condition was met.\r\nIII. Condition\r\n  Precedent\r\nM&amp;M contends the trial court erred in awarding summary\r\n  judgment on the basis of Holmesâ€™ inability to meet a condition precedent\r\n  resulting in a void contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nA condition precedent to a contract is â€œany fact other than the\r\n  lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of\r\n  immediate performance arises.â€ Brewer v. Stokes Kia, Isuzu, Subaru, Inc.,\r\n  364 S.C. 444, 449, 613 S.E.2d 802, 805 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Worley v.\r\n    Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994). Â Â Here, the Contract contained a condition precedent[7] that Holmesâ€™ obligation to purchase\r\n  the business was subject to her ability to secure commercial financing.Â  \r\nOn May 9, 2005, Holmesâ€™ request for a loan was denied. Â At\r\n  the summary judgment hearing, no evidence was presented regarding Holmesâ€™\r\n  ability to secure commercial financing, and no evidence was presented to show\r\n  Holmes obtained financing by the Contractâ€™s closing date of May 22, 2005.Â  â€œThe\r\n  failure of one to perform under a contract because of his inability to obtain\r\n  financing from a third party on whom he relied to furnish the money will not\r\n  excuse performance, in the absence of a contract provision in that regard.â€Â  Worley,\r\n  317 S.C. at 209, 452 S.E.2d at 624 (citing 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 680\r\n  (1991)).Â  This Contract contained just such a provision relating to Holmesâ€™\r\n  ability to obtain financing.Â  \r\n In light of this\r\n  Contractâ€™s language and the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial court\r\n  granting summary judgment in favor of Holmes on M&amp;Mâ€™s causes of action is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Initially we must note that summary judgment was\r\n  granted solely to Holmes on M&amp;Mâ€™s breach of contract action.Â  Although\r\n  Holmes, Kopatch, and Empire Business Brokerage, L.L.C. are represented by the\r\n  same attorney, the attorney made clear at the beginning of the hearing that\r\n  Kopatch and the Brokerage were not parties to the Motion for Summary Judgment. Â As\r\n  such, this appeal and opinion pertain only to the action against Holmes.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] â€œ19.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Appellant Ricky Brannon was convicted of resisting arrest for\r\n  fleeing on foot from police officers who yelled, â€œStop, police.â€Â  Citing a lack\r\n  of direct and substantial circumstantial evidence, he argues the circuit court\r\n  judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We agree.[1]\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDUAL BACKGROUND\r\nMaria\r\n  Raney, a resident of Westwood Apartments in Gaffney, awoke in the early morning\r\n  hours of April 21, 2003.Â  Upon looking out her window, she observed her car\r\n  with its interior light illuminated and a man moving around inside.Â  She called\r\n  911 and the operator asked her to stay on the line until police arrived.Â \r\n  Rainey complied and informed the operator when she saw Gaffney Police\r\n  Department Officers Michael Scruggs and Randy Quinn.Â  Rainey testified the\r\n  officers â€œcame up and they hollered police and I saw them as [they] chased\r\n  him.â€\r\nWith\r\n  dispatch relaying information as it was supplied by Rainey, Officer Scruggs and\r\n  Officer Quinn approached the apartment building with the headlights and sirens\r\n  off.Â  Once in proximity, the officers proceeded on foot and observed a figure\r\n  standing outside a vehicle whose interior light was on.Â  Raineyâ€™s observations,\r\n  as conveyed by dispatch, informed them the suspect had moved on to another car,\r\n  a Ford Explorer owned by a neighborâ€™s mother. Â The officers saw only one figure\r\n  in the parking lot by an Explorer. Scruggs explained â€œ[a]t that time, we knew\r\n  we had a crime being committed.â€Â  Scruggs said the person looked up, apparently\r\n  hearing them.Â  Scruggs testified:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Now, when yâ€™all came up, you say you\r\n  identified yourself.Â  Tell me exactly what you said.\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  I think Officer Quinn told him just, said just\r\n  stop police, or I believe thatâ€™s what he said.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  Stop\r\n  police.Â  Was anything else said to him?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  No, sir,\r\n  other than stop again because he was already running.\r\n\tQ: Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  So all that was said to him was\r\n  stop police and then stop again?Â  He was never placed under arrest?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  No, sir,\r\n  not until we caught him.\r\n\r\nOfficer Quinn\r\n  testified:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tBased upon information you had, did you believe the \r\n\t\t\tsubject, at that time, was the individual breaking into motor \r\n\t\t\tvehicles?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And what\r\n  was your intention when the subject took off?\r\n\t. . .\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tOur intention was to approach the subject and find \r\n\t\t\tout exactly what he was doing there at that time.&nbsp; We believe \r\n\t\t\the was breaking into a motor vehicle and we placed him under arrest \r\n\t\t\tfor that charge.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBrannon ran three\r\n  hundred to three hundred fifty yards before being placed under arrest.Â  The\r\n  record does not indicate Brannon resisted the officers once caught.Â  Scruggs\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Why was he\r\n  charged with resisting arrest?\r\n\tA:Â Â Â Â Â  For running\r\n  on myself and Officer Quinn.\r\n\r\nAfter being found\r\n  guilty, Brannon was sentenced to three years in prison for breaking into a\r\n  motor vehicle, suspended upon the service of two years, and one year\r\n  probation.Â  He was additionally sentenced to one year in prison for resisting\r\n  arrest.Â  The sentences are concurrent.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Miller,\r\n  375 S.C. 370, 378, 652 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 2007); State v. Wood,\r\n  362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Thus, an appellate\r\n  court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  Id.; State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d\r\n  503, 504 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the\r\n  trial court abused its discretion. Â State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 43, 503\r\n  S.E.2d 747, 751 (1998); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 653, 623 S.E.2d\r\n  122, 127 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge, who will not be reversed absent a\r\n  prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448,\r\n  298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 230, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, May 3, 2007.Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nBrannon contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for\r\n  directed verdict on the resisting arrest charge.\r\nWhen\r\n  ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with\r\n  the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006); State v. Stanley, 365\r\n  S.C. 24, 41-42, 615 S.E.2d 455, 464 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Padgett, 354\r\n  S.C. 268, 271, 580 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A defendant is entitled to\r\n  a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004)\r\n  (citing State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003)); State v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 633, 608 S.E.2d 886, 889 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005); Padgett, 354 S.C. at 271, 580 S.E.2d at 161.Â  When reviewing a\r\n  denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court views evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648; State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 101, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 411,\r\n  578 S.E.2d 32, 35 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If there is any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648; Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593, 606\r\n  S.E.2d at 478; McKnight, 352 S.C. at 642, 576 S.E.2d at 172; State v.\r\n    Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 190, 562 S.E.2d 320, 323 (Ct. App. 2002); see\r\n      also State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 563, 598 S.E.2d 279, 284 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (noting judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any\r\n  direct or substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove\r\n  the defendantâ€™s guilt, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically\r\n  deduced).Â  The appellate court may reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion\r\n  for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).\r\nThe trial\r\n  court should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a\r\n  suspicion that the defendant is guilty. Â State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 390,\r\n  605 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2004); State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 132, 322\r\n  S.E.2d 450, 452 (1984); State v. Horne, 324 S.C. 372, 379, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  289, 293 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œ â€˜Suspicionâ€™ implies a belief or opinion as to\r\n  guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.â€ Â Cherry,\r\n  361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478. Â However, a trial court is not required to\r\n  find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable\r\n  hypothesis. Â Id.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Rules\r\n  of Statutory Construction\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory\r\n  interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature. Â Bass v. Isochem,\r\n  365 S.C. 454, 459, 617 S.E.2d 369, 377 (Ct. App. 2005); Georgia-Carolina\r\n    Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 22, 579 S.E.2d 334, 336\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003); Smith v. S.C. Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 87, 564 S.E.2d 358,\r\n  361 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Gordon v. Phillips Utils., Inc.,\r\n  362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005) (â€œThe primary purpose in\r\n  construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€).Â  All rules of\r\n  statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must\r\n  prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that\r\n  language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.\r\n  Â McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d\r\n  240, 242 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County,\r\n  331 S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C.\r\n  359, 365-66, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Hudson, 336\r\n  S.C. 237, 246, 519 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œOnce the legislature has\r\n  made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment\r\n  based upon their own notions of public policy.â€ Â S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins.\r\n    Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nThe\r\n  legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of\r\n  the statute. Â State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 102, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Stephen\r\n    v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 339, 478 S.E.2d 74, 77 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  The language must be read to harmonize with its subject matter and\r\n  accord with its general purpose.Â  Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT &amp; T Commcâ€™ns\r\n    of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004); Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Hudson, 336\r\n  S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582. Â \r\nWhen a\r\n  statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for\r\n  statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its\r\n  literal meaning. Â Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 307, 613 S.E.2d 364,\r\n  366 (2005); Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314\r\n  S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994); Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto\r\n    Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 231, 612 S.E.2d 719, 723 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If a\r\n  statuteâ€™s language is unambiguous and clear, there is no need to employ the\r\n  rules of statutory construction and this Court has no right to look for or\r\n  impose another meaning. Â Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 373,\r\n  585 S.E.2d 292, 298 (2003); Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C.\r\n  434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995).Â  What a legislature says in the text of a\r\n  statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Â Bayle\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n  Â The words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resorting to subtle or forced construction. Â Durham v. United Cos.\r\n    Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 604, 503 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1998); Adkins v.\r\n      Comcar Indus., Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 411, 475 S.E.2d 762, 763 (1996); Worsley\r\n        Cos. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 351 S.C. 97, 102, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 907, 910 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Timmons v. S.C.\r\n    Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 402, 175 S.E.2d 805, 817 (1970)\r\n  (observing that where the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the\r\n  court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it that are not in the\r\n  legislatureâ€™s language). Â Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s\r\n  place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute. Â Vaughn v.\r\n    Bernhardt, 345 S.C. 196, 198, 547 S.E.2d 869, 870 (2001); Hodges v.\r\n      Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000); Bayle, 344 S.C.\r\n  at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739; see also Shealy v.

App. 2006), cert. denied, Aug. 9, 2007.\r\nIn construing a statute, the court looks to the language as a\r\n  whole in light of its manifest purpose. Â State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162,\r\n  166, 573 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2002); Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320 S.C.\r\n  213, 217, 464 S.E.2d 109, 112 (1995); Brassell, 326 S.C. at 560, 486\r\n  S.E.2d at 494.Â  A statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and\r\n  fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the\r\n  lawmakers. Â See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury\r\n    Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 621, 611 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, 354 S.C. at 22, 579 S.E.2d at 336 (â€œA\r\n  statute should be given a reasonable and practical construction consistent with\r\n  the purpose and policy expressed in the statute.â€). Â The real purpose and\r\n  intent of the lawmakers will prevail over the literal import of the words.Â  Browning\r\n    v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992).\r\nCourts\r\n  will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly\r\n  absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat\r\n  the plain legislative intention. Â Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C.\r\n  362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000); Kiriakides v. United Artists Commcâ€™ns,\r\n    Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994). Â A court should not\r\n  consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but\r\n  should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the\r\n  policy of the law.Â  See Liberty Mut.

Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621 (1991), the United States Supreme Court\r\n  elucidated when encounters between police officers and citizens rise to the\r\n  level of seizures and arrests.Â  In Hodari D., two police officers were\r\n  patrolling a high crime area when they observed several youths gathered around\r\n  a parked car.Â  As the officers approached in their unmarked police car, the\r\n  group panicked and scattered.Â  One member of the group, Hodari, fled the scene\r\n  on foot and an officer chased after him.Â  As Hodari ran, he looked to his rear\r\n  and did not see his pursuer until directly before he was apprehended.Â  Upon\r\n  seeing the officer and moments prior to being tackled and handcuffed, Hodari\r\n  tossed away a small rock which was later determined to be crack cocaine.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  issue in Hodari D. revolved around when a seizure occurs within the\r\n  meaning of the Fourth Amendment.Â  Hodari contended if he were seized at the\r\n  time he discarded the drugs, this evidence is barred as the fruit of an illegal\r\n  seizure since the officers lacked the reasonable suspicion required to stop him\r\n  for questioning.Â  However, the Court disagreed with this argument and\r\n  determined Hodari was seized at the moment he was tackled, not during the pursuit\r\n  leading up to the tackle.Â  Therefore, the cocaine discarded during the pursuit\r\n  was not the product of an illegal seizure because a seizure had not yet taken\r\n  place when it was abandoned.Â  Id. at 629.Â  \r\nIn reaching this\r\n  conclusion, the Supreme Court expounded on what an arrest is under our\r\n  Constitution:\r\n\r\n\tTo\r\n  constitute an arrest, howeverâ€”the quintessential â€œseizure of the personâ€ under\r\n  our Fourth Amendment jurisprudenceâ€”the mere grasping or application of physical\r\n  force with lawful authority, whether or not it succeeded in subduing the\r\n  arrestee, was sufficient.Â  See, e.g., Whitebread v. Keyes,\r\n  85 Mass. 495, 501 (1862) (â€œ[A]n officer effects an arrest of a person whom he\r\n  has authority to arrest, by laying his hand on him for the purpose of arresting\r\n  him, though he may not succeed in stopping and holding himâ€); 1 Restatement of\r\n  Torts Â§ 41, Comment h (1934).Â  As one commentator has described it:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tâ€œThere\r\n  can be constructive detention, which will constitute an arrest, although the\r\n  party is never actually brought within the physical control of the party making\r\n  an arrest.Â  This is accomplished merely by touching, however slightly, the body\r\n  of the accused, by the party making the arrest and for that purpose, although\r\n  he does not succeed in stopping or holding him even for an instant; as where\r\n  the bailiff had tried to arrest one who fought him off by a fork, the court\r\n  said, â€˜If the bailiff had touched him, that had been an arrest . . . .â€™Â  â€Â  A.\r\n  Cornelius, Search and Seizure, 163-164 (2d ed. 1930) (footnote omitted).Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tTo say\r\n  that an arrest is effected by the slightest application of physical force,\r\n  despite the arresteeâ€™s escape, is not to say that for Fourth Amendment purposes\r\n  there is a continuing arrest during the period of fugitivity.Â  If, for\r\n  example [the officer] had laid his hands upon Hodari to arrest him, but Hodari\r\n  had broken away and had then cast away the cocaine, it would hardly be\r\n  realistic to say that that disclosure had been made during the course of an\r\n  arrest.Â  Cf. Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, 471, 21 L. Ed.\r\n  897 (1874) (â€œA seizure is a single act, and not a continuous factâ€).Â  \r\n\t. . .\r\n\tHodari\r\n  contends (and we accept as true for purposes of this decision) that [the\r\n  officerâ€™s] pursuit qualified as a â€œshow of authorityâ€ calling upon Hodari to\r\n  halt.Â  The narrow question before us is whether, with respect to a show of\r\n  authority as with respect to application of physical force, a seizure occurs\r\n  even though the subject does not yield.Â  We hold that it does not.Â  \r\n\tThe\r\n  language of the Fourth Amendment, of course, cannot sustain respondentâ€™s\r\n  contention.Â  The word â€œseizureâ€ readily bears the meaning of a laying on of\r\n  hands or application of physical force to restrain movement, even when it is\r\n  ultimately unsuccessful.Â  (â€œShe seized the purse-snatcher, but he broke out of\r\n  her grasp.â€)Â  It does not remotely apply, however, to the prospect of a\r\n  policeman yelling â€œStop, in the name of the law!â€ at a fleeing form that\r\n  continues to flee.Â  That is no seizure.Â  Nor can the result respondent wishes\r\n  to achieve be producedâ€”indirectly, as it wereâ€”by suggesting that [the\r\n  officerâ€™s] uncomplied-with show of authority was a common-law arrest, and then\r\n  appealing to the principle that all common-law arrests are seizures.Â  An arrest\r\n  requires either physical force (as described above) or, where\r\n  that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tâ€œMere\r\n  words will not constitute an arrest, while, on the other hand, no actual,\r\n  physical touching is essential.Â  The apparent inconsistency in the two parts of\r\n  this statement is explained by the fact that an assertion of authority and\r\n  purpose to arrest followed by submission of the arrestee constitutes an\r\n  arrest.Â  There can be no arrest without either touching or submission.â€Â \r\n  Perkins, The Law of Arrest, 25 Iowa L. Rev. 201, 206 (1940) (footnotes\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nHodari D., 499 U.S. at 624-627.\r\nThe\r\n  Court clearly defined an arrest for Fourth Amendment purposes as requiring the\r\n  application of physical force or a submission to a show of authority.Â  A\r\n  suspect must yield to police demands or be physically restrainedâ€”if one of\r\n  these elements is lacking, then an arrest has not been consummated.Â  Hodari was\r\n  not restrained, had not been physically touched, and did not submit to a show\r\n  of authority at the time he discarded the drugs.Â  Therefore, he had not yet\r\n  been arrested until the point physical force was applied through the officerâ€™s\r\n  tackle.Â  Id. at 629 (â€œ[A]ssuming that [the officerâ€™s] pursuit in the\r\n  present case constituted a â€˜show of authorityâ€™ enjoining Hodari to halt, since\r\n  Hodari did not comply with that injunction he was not seized until he was\r\n  tackled.â€)\r\nIn reaching the\r\n  decision in Hodari D., the Supreme Court cited to another important case\r\n  addressing when a seizure or arrest has occurred, Brower v. Inyo County,\r\n  489 U.S. 593 (1989).Â  In Brower, a suspect in a stolen car fled from\r\n  police pursuit during a lengthy high-speed chase.Â  The chase ended when the\r\n  suspect crashed into a police roadblock and was killed.Â  His heirs challenged\r\n  the roadblock as an unreasonable seizure contrary to Fourth Amendment\r\n  protections, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found no seizure had taken\r\n  place.Â  The Supreme Court disagreed and, finding the roadblock was a seizure,\r\n  remanded the case for additional consideration regarding reasonableness.Â  \r\nIn making this\r\n  determination, the Court explicated on when the seizure in the case actually\r\n  transpired:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  clear, in other words, that a Fourth Amendment seizure does not occur whenever\r\n  there is a governmentally caused termination of an individualâ€™s freedom of\r\n  movement (the innocent passerby), nor even whenever there is a governmentally\r\n  caused and governmentally desired termination of an individualâ€™s freedom\r\n  of movement (the fleeing felon), but only when there is a governmental\r\n  termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied. \r\n\t\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tThe\r\n  pursuing police car sought to stop the suspect only by the show of authority\r\n  represented by flashing lights and continuing pursuit; and though he was in\r\n  fact stopped, he was stopped by a different meansâ€”his loss of control of his\r\n  vehicle and the subsequent crash.Â  If, instead of that, the police cruiser had\r\n  pulled alongside the fleeing car and sideswiped it, producing the crash, then\r\n  the termination of the suspectâ€™s freedom of movement would have been a\r\n  seizure.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 596-597.\r\nThe\r\n  roadblock was responsible for stopping the suspectâ€™s flight, not the show of\r\n  authority from the flashing lights of the pursuing police vehicles.Â  The\r\n  Courtâ€™s holding illustrates that a mere show of authority, without more, is not\r\n  enough to constitute a seizure or arrest.Â  As noted, had one of the pursuing\r\n  officers attempted to ram the suspectâ€™s vehicle in order to stop it, this would\r\n  have equated to a seizure.Â  However, the pursuit was not enough in itself to\r\n  terminate the freedom of movement of the suspect and did not rise to the level\r\n  of a seizure without his submission to the pursuersâ€™ show of authority.Â  \r\nFollowing Hodari\r\n  D., the Supreme Court further examined when a seizure or arrest occurs in County\r\n    of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833 (1998).Â  In this case, police\r\n  responded to a call about a fight in progress.Â  As one of the officers returned\r\n  to his patrol car, two boys uninvolved in the fight approached the scene on a\r\n  motorcycle at a high rate of speed.Â  The officer turned on his flashing lights,\r\n  commanded the boys to stop, and repositioned his patrol car in an effort to\r\n  block the motorcycle.Â  Instead of stopping, the boys maneuvered around the\r\n  police cars and sped away.Â  Another officer chased after the boys at high\r\n  speed.Â  The chase ended when the motorcycle tipped over and its occupants were\r\n  thrown off.Â  The pursuing officer then accidently struck and killed one of the\r\n  boys while attempting to stop the patrol car.Â  \r\nIn a due process\r\n  analysis to determine police liability for the boyâ€™s death, the Court noted\r\n  that no seizure had materialized during the pursuit of the motorcycle.Â  Id. at 843 (â€œThe Fourth Amendment covers only â€˜searches and seizures,â€™ neither of\r\n  which took place here.â€ (quoting Brower, 489 U.S. at 597)).Â  The Court\r\n  cited to both Hodari D. and Brower in concluding that a police\r\n  pursuit in an attempt to seize a suspect does not amount to an actual seizure\r\n  under the Fourth Amendment.Â  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 844.Â  Because the boys\r\n  did not pull over in response to the flashing lights and no intentional contact\r\n  was made to effectuate a stop, no seizure resulted from the officerâ€™s conduct.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, even though the officer struck one of the boys while\r\n  trying to halt his vehicle, the Court determined a seizure did not occur\r\n  because this contact was accidental.Â  Id. (â€œ[N]o Fourth Amendment\r\n  seizure would take place when a â€˜pursuing police car sought to stop the suspect\r\n  only by the show of authority represented by flashing lights and continuing\r\n  pursuit,â€™ but accidently stopped the suspect by crashing into him.â€).Â  The case\r\n  establishes police pursuit is not enough to constitute a seizure or arrest\r\n  absent intentional physical contact or a submission to a show of authority.Â  \r\nMore recently, the\r\n  Supreme Court reaffirmed the holding from Hodari D. in Brendlin v.\r\n    California, 551 U.S. Â Â Â Â Â , 127 S. Ct. 2400 (2007).Â  In this case,\r\n  police officers saw a car with expired registration tags.Â  Before the officers\r\n  pulled the car over, they had discovered through dispatch that a registration\r\n  renewal was being processed and had noticed a temporary operating permit\r\n  indicating it was legal to drive the vehicle through the end of the month.Â  The\r\n  officers decided to stop the vehicle in order to verify the permit matched the\r\n  vehicle.Â  There was nothing suspicious about the permit or the way it was\r\n  affixed to the car at the time of the stop.Â  After the vehicle was pulled over,\r\n  one of the officers recognized the passenger, Brendlin, as a possible parole\r\n  violator.Â  As he verified this information, he saw Brendlin open and close the\r\n  door of the car.Â  The officer then approached the car, ordered Brendlin out at\r\n  gunpoint, and placed him under arrest.Â  In a search incident to this arrest,\r\n  the officers found evidence related to the manufacture of methamphetamines.Â  \r\nThe issue before\r\n  the Court was whether the evidence collected was the fruit of an illegal\r\n  seizure.Â  The Court determined â€œ[a] person is seized by the police and thus\r\n  entitled to challenge the governmentâ€™s action under the Fourth Amendment when\r\n  the officer, â€˜ â€˜by means of physical force or show of authority,â€™ â€™ terminates\r\n  or restrains his freedom of movement.â€Â  Id., 127 S. Ct. at 2405 (quoting Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991) (quoting Terry v. Ohio,\r\n  392 U.S. 1, 19, n. 16 (1968))).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a] police officer may make a\r\n  seizure by a show of authority and without the use of physical force, but there\r\n  is no seizure without actual submission; otherwise, there is at most an\r\n  attempted seizure, so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned.â€Â  Brendlin,\r\n  127 S. Ct. at 2405.Â  The Court held that a passenger is seized at the moment\r\n  the car comes to a halt.Â  Id., 127 S. Ct. at 2403.Â  As soon as the\r\n  driver pulled his car over in response to the police presence, a seizure of all\r\n  occupants of the vehicle was completed.Â  This case is important because it\r\n  further clarifies a seizure occurs when an individual submits to a show of\r\n  authority, including when that person is a passenger in a submitting vehicle.Â  Id., 127 S. Ct. at 2403 (â€œBrendlin was seized from the moment [the driverâ€™s] car\r\n  came to a halt on the side of the road, and it was error to deny his\r\n  suppression motion on the ground that seizure occurred only at the formal\r\n  arrest.â€).\r\nFrom Hodari D. and the chain of cases that followed, two factors essential to an arrest have\r\n  been identified:Â  (1) physical contact intended to effect restraint or (2)\r\n  submission to a show of authority.Â  An arrest, the highest form of seizure\r\n  possible under the Fourth Amendment, occurs when a police officer physically\r\n  restrains a suspect or forces submission through a show of authority.Â  Hodari\r\n    D., 499 U.S. at 624.Â  A seizure or arrest has not been effected when a\r\n  suspect flees from an officerâ€”whether the flight be on foot, in an automobile,\r\n  or on a motorcycleâ€”even if there has been a show of authority or command to\r\n  stop without submission.Â  See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 843-844; Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 626; Brower, 489 U.S. at 597.Â  Without one of\r\n  these factors, an arrest has not yet occurred.Â  Embracing this proposition and\r\n  the holdings in these United States Supreme Court cases, fleeing from an\r\n  officerâ€™s command to stop does not yet rise to an arrest for Fourth Amendment\r\n  purposes absent submission to the order.\r\nIn the case sub\r\n  judice, Brannonâ€™s response to spotting the police was identical to the\r\n  actions of Hodari in a similar situation.Â  When Brannon saw officers\r\n  approaching him, he turned and fled, just like Hodari did when he observed a\r\n  police presence.Â  Additionally, like the boys on the motorcycle in Lewis,\r\n  Brannon chose to ignore the officerâ€™s commands to stop and continued his\r\n  flight.Â  In both Hodari D. and Lewis, the Supreme Court\r\n  determined no arrest or seizure had occurred during these flights.Â  See Lewis,\r\n  523 U.S. at 843; Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 629.Â  Therefore, it appears\r\n  consistent to conclude that no arrest occurred in the present case during the\r\n  course of Brannonâ€™s flight.Â  Looking to the factors for an arrest enunciated by\r\n  the Supreme Court, Brannon had neither been physically touched for the purpose\r\n  of restraint nor had he submitted to a show of authority at the time of his\r\n  flight.Â  Therefore, no arrest or seizure had occurred at the time of Brannonâ€™s\r\n  alleged resistance.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Resisting Arrest under\r\n  Section 16-9-320(A)\r\nBrannon\r\n  was convicted for a violation of South\r\n  Carolina Code Section 16-9-320(A) which provides:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  unlawful for a person knowingly and wilfully to oppose or resist a law\r\n  enforcement officer in serving, executing, or attempting to serve or execute a\r\n  legal writ or process or to resist an arrest being made by one whom the person\r\n  knows or reasonably should know is a law enforcement officer, whether under\r\n  process or not. A person who violates the provisions of this subsection is\r\n  guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than five\r\n  hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than\r\n  one year, or both.\r\n\r\nAn â€œarrestâ€ is\r\n  defined by Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary as â€œ1.Â  A seizure or forcible\r\n  restraint.Â  2. The taking or keeping of a person in custody by legal authority,\r\n  esp. in response to a criminal charge.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 104 (7th ed.\r\n  1999).Â  \r\nWhether\r\n  fleeing a police officerâ€™s simple demand to stop constitutes resisting arrest\r\n  under Section 16-9-320(A) is a novel question.Â  South Carolina case law has\r\n  recognized that an arrest is an ongoing process, finalized only when the\r\n  defendant is properly confined.Â  State v. Dowd, 306 S.C. 268, 270, 411\r\n  S.E.2d 428, 429 (1991).Â  However, there is a paucity of law defining when an\r\n  arrest begins.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Williams, 237 S.C. 252, 116 S.E.2d 858 (1960), Williams was convicted of\r\n  robbery, grand larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.Â  While detained by a\r\n  highway patrol officer investigating the possession of contraband liquor,\r\n  Williams â€œsuddenly caught him by the arm and after a struggle took his pistol\r\n  from the holster.â€Â  Id. at 256, 116 S.E.2d at 860.Â  The supreme court\r\n  discussed whether Williams was under arrest when he took the officerâ€™s weapon:Â  \r\n\r\n\tSo far\r\n  as appellant is concerned, the only act of the patrolman prior to that time was\r\n  to request him to get out of the car.Â  This cannot be said as a matter of law\r\n  to amount to an arrest.Â  â€˜To constitute an arrest, there must be an actual or\r\n  constructive seizure or detention of the person, performed with the intention\r\n  to effect an arrest and so understood by the person detained.â€™Â  Jenkins v. United States, 10 Cir., 161 F.2d 99, 101 [1947].Â  It is not necessary â€˜that there be an\r\n  application of actual force, or manual touching of the body, or physical\r\n  restraint which may be visible to the eye, or a formal declaration of arrest;\r\n  it is sufficient if the person arrested understands that he is in the power of\r\n  the one arresting and submits in consequence.Â  However, in all cases in which\r\n  there is no manual touching or seizure or any resistance, the intentions of the\r\n  parties to the transaction are very important; there must have been intent on\r\n  the part of one of them to arrest the other, and intent on the part of such\r\n  other to submit, under the belief and impression that submission was necessary.Â \r\n  There can be no arrest where the person sought to be arrested is not conscious\r\n  of any restraint of his liberty.â€™Â  4 Am. Jur., Arrest, Section 2.Â  Also, \r\n\tsee 6 C.J.S. Arrest Â§ 1; Restatement, Torts, Section 112.\r\n\r\nWilliams, 237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860-861.\r\nIn a\r\n  case where two African American students were arrested for trespass and breach\r\n  of the peace, and one of them was charged with resisting arrest, for sitting at\r\n  a drug storeâ€™s restaurant whose policy was to not serve African Americans, the\r\n  supreme court considered whether a delay in responding to a police officerâ€™s instruction\r\n  constituted resisting arrest.Â  City of Columbia v. Bouie, 239 S.C. 570,\r\n  124 S.E.2d 332 (1962), overruled on other grounds, 378 U.S. 347 (1964).Â \r\n  The court illuminated:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  evidence was in our opinion insufficient to warrant Bouieâ€™s conviction on the\r\n  charge of resisting arrest.Â  It is apparent from the testimony of the arresting\r\n  officer that the only â€˜resistanceâ€™ on Bouieâ€™s part was his failure to obey\r\n  immediately the officerâ€™s order, with the result that the latter â€˜had to pick\r\n  him up out of the seatâ€™.Â  Resisting arrest is one form of the common law\r\n  offense of obstructing justice; and the use of force is not an essential\r\n  ingredient of it.Â  But we do not think that such momentary delay in responding\r\n  to the officerâ€™s command as is shown by the testimony here amounted to\r\n  â€˜resistanceâ€™ within the intent of the law.\r\n\r\nId., 239 S.C. at 574, 124 S.E.2d at 333 (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nIn Fernandez\r\n  v. State, 306 S.C. 264, 411 S.E.2d 426 (1991), Fernandez was standing in a\r\n  group of people approached by police officers.Â  Fernandez broke from the group\r\n  and ran, carrying two packages.Â  As the police pursued him, Fernandez dropped\r\n  the two packages.Â  The officers eventually caught and subdued Fernandez, and\r\n  they returned to retrieve the packages he abandoned.Â  One package contained\r\n  $13,000 and the other crack cocaine.Â  Id. at 266, 411 S.E.2d at 427.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the admission into evidence of the contents\r\n  of the packages Fernandez dropped:\r\n\r\n\tIn California\r\n  v. Hondari D., 499 U.S. 621, 111 S. Ct. 1547, 113 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1991), a\r\n  case with remarkably similar facts to the present case, the United States\r\n  Supreme Court held that the defendant was not seized for Fourth Amendment\r\n  purposes until he submitted to the authorities. Id. 499 U.S. at [629], 111 S.  Ct. at 1552, 10 L. Ed. 2d at 699.Â  Further, defendant abandoned the evidence\r\n  while he was running from the police. See Id.Â  It follows that\r\n  evidence abandoned by the defendant before he was seized by the police cannot\r\n  be the basis for a violation of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against\r\n  unreasonable search and seizure.Â  Id.Â  We find no error in the admission\r\n  of evidence so obtained.\r\n\r\nFernandez, 306 S.C. at 266-267, 411 S.E.2d at 427-428.\r\nSection\r\n  16-9-320(A) requires that there be an â€œarrest being madeâ€ in order to support a\r\n  conviction.Â  The statute does not criminalize fleeing from officers attempting\r\n  to conduct a Terry stop.Â  There is no allegation Brannon â€œoppose[d] or\r\n  resist[ed] a law enforcement officer in serving, executing, or attempting to\r\n  serve or execute a legal writ or process.â€Â  His conviction was founded upon â€œresist[ing]\r\n  an arrest being made by one whom the person knows or reasonably should know is\r\n  a law enforcement officer.â€ Â By the clear, unambivalent language of the\r\n  statute, a conviction for the offense can only stand if there was indeed an\r\n  arrest being made.Â  It follows that since there is no seizure for Fourth Amendment\r\n  purposes when an individual flees approaching officers, there certainly cannot\r\n  be an arrest.Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp; Other Jurisdictionsâ€™\r\n  Resisting Arrest Statutes\r\nPrior to a later amendment of its relevant statute,\r\n  Missouriâ€™s criteria for sustaining a resisting arrest conviction shared with\r\n  South Carolina Code Section 16-9-320(A) the requirement that an offender\r\n  knowingly resists an arrest being made.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Long, 802 S.W.2d 573 (Mo. Ct. App. 1991), the Missouri Court of Appeals\r\n  found a conviction for resisting arrest was not supported by sufficient\r\n  evidence.Â  At the time of trial, the Missouri statute declared, in pertinent\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tA person commits the crime of resisting . . . arrest if, knowing \r\n\t\t\tthat a law enforcement officer is making an arrest, for the purpose \r\n\t\t\tof preventing the officer from effecting the arrest, he:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t(1)Â Â Â Â  Resists the arrest of himself by .\r\n  . . fleeing from such officer . . . .\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 575.150 (1986).\r\nIn Long,\r\n  a police officer followed Long intending to stop him for an expired license plate.Â \r\n  After Long began to accelerate his truck, the officer activated his lights and\r\n  siren, pursued Long, and stopped after Long pulled into a driveway.Â  Long\r\n  exited his truck when the officer arrived.Â  After being advised that he was\r\n  being arrested for various charges including resisting arrest, Long offered no\r\n  opposition.\r\nAt trial, the\r\n  arresting officer testified when he saw the expired plate he intended to â€œstop\r\n  the pickup and investigate . . . .â€Â  Long, 802 S.W.2d at 575.Â  He said\r\n  he formed the intent to place Long under arrest â€œwhen I determined he was\r\n  actively fleeing from me.â€Â  Id.Â  Long moved for an acquittal arguing the\r\n  state failed to prove (1) Long knew the officer was making an arrest and (2)\r\n  the officer intended to arrest him prior to flight.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court said the officer could not have formed the intent to arrest Long for the\r\n  registration offense without first confirming Long was the owner as required by\r\n  Missouri law.Â  Long was additionally charged with not having a driverâ€™s\r\n  license. Â This fact, discovered after Long stopped, could not have supplied an\r\n  intent to arrest prior to the chase.Â  The court held:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he sequence of events, viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n\tjudgment, was (a) the officer commenced pursuit of the defendant without any \r\n\tintent to arrest him, (b) the defendant fled from the officer, and (c) the \r\n\tofficer formed an intent to arrest the defendant when he â€œdetermined [the \r\n\tdefendant] was actively fleeing from me.â€ &nbsp;There was no evidence at trial \r\n\tidentifying the crime for which he intended to arrest the defendant. &nbsp;While \r\n\twe are sympathetic with the view that such a sequence of events might \r\n\tconstitute a crime, we are convinced that the state failed to prove that\r\n  the defendant violated Â§ 575.150. The statute creates the crime of resisting\r\n  arrest by flight; it does not create the crime of fleeing from a traffic stop\r\n  where no arrest was intended until after flight commenced.\r\n\r\nId. at 577.Â  \r\n\r\n\tMissouriâ€™s\r\n  amended statute now reads:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tA person commits the crime of resisting or interfering with \r\n\t\t\tarrest, detention, or stop if, knowing that a law enforcement \r\n\t\t\tofficer is making an arrest, or attempting to lawfully detain or \r\n\t\t\tstop an individual or vehicle, or the person reasonably should know \r\n\t\t\tthat a law enforcement officer is making an arrest or attempting to \r\n\t\t\tlawfully detain or lawfully stop an individual or vehicle for the \r\n\t\t\tpurpose of preventing the officer from effecting the arrest, stop or \r\n\t\t\tdetention, the person:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t(1) Resists the arrest, stop or\r\n  detention of such person by using or threatening the use of violence or\r\n  physical force or by fleeing from such officer; . . . .\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 575.150 (2006).\r\nIn the case at bar, evidence was entered indicating Brannon was\r\n  suspected of breaking and entering automobiles.Â  However, Scruggs testified he\r\n  wanted to stop Brannon and question him.Â  Similar to Long, the intent to\r\n  arrest was formulated after Brannon fled.Â  While the Long court never\r\n  reached the argument that the prosecution failed to prove Long knew the officer\r\n  was making an arrest, a footnote suggested that a conviction could stand where\r\n  the intent to arrest is formed during pursuit if a crime were committed in the\r\n  officerâ€™s presence, or if he learned of an arrest warrant over the radio.Â  Long, 802\r\n  S.W.2d at 577, n. 4.\r\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals considered whether a person\r\n  who fled from an officer intending an investigatory stop evaded arrest in Smith\r\n    v. State, 739 S.W.2d 848 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (en banc).Â  At the\r\n  time of Smithâ€™s conviction, Texas Penal Code Section 38.04 provided â€œa person\r\n  commits the offense of evading arrest if he intentionally flees from a person\r\n  he knows is a peace officer attempting to arrest him.â€Â  â€œThe gravamen of the\r\n  offense is the evasion of an arrest, not the evasion of a police officer.â€Â  Smith,\r\n  739 S.W.2d at 850 (quoting Jackson v. State, 718 S.W.2d 724, 726 (Tex.\r\n  Crim. App. 1986)).Â  Section 38.04 currently states â€œ[a] person commits an\r\n  offense if he intentionally flees from a person he knows is a peace officer attempting\r\n  to lawfully arrest or detain him.â€Â  Tex. Penal Code Ann. Â§ 38.04 (Vernon\r\n  2003) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Smith, an officer was dispatched to a club after a\r\n  disturbance was reported.Â  Without knowing what had occurred inside, the\r\n  officer was met outside by three women who told him Smith had a gun.Â  Smith,\r\n  who was in the doorway, ran from the scene.Â  After chasing Smith while yelling\r\n  â€œHalt, Police!â€, Smith was apprehended.Â  The officer determined Smith was\r\n  intoxicated, and he was arrested for that offense.Â  The court held Smith fled\r\n  when the officer was trying to investigate to determine if the crime of\r\n  unlawfully possessing a gun had occurred.Â  â€œ[Section] 38.04 . . . requires that\r\n  before a violation of that statute can occur, when the individual flees from\r\n  the officer, the officer must then be attempting to arrest him.â€Â  Smith,\r\n  739 S.W.2d at 853 (emphasis in original).Â  The court concluded the state failed\r\n  to prove Smith violated Section 38.04.Â  â€œ[F]leeing from a request for a Terry-type\r\n  stop, while not behavior we condone in any way, does not constitute the crime\r\n  of resisting arrest.â€Â  Id. at 851.\r\nThe\r\n  Appeals Court of Massachusetts considered whether a defendantâ€™s flight from\r\n  officers who had not yet spoken with him supported a conviction for resisting\r\n  arrest.Â  Commonwealth v. Grant, 880 N.E.2d 820 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008).Â  Police\r\n  officers saw Grantâ€™s car traveling down a road and, knowing of an outstanding\r\n  warrant, they began to follow.Â  Before they could turn on their lights or\r\n  sirens, Grant abruptly pulled over, leapt from the car, and fled on foot.Â  He\r\n  led the officers at a full sprint through several yards and was seen placing a\r\n  gun inside a backyard grill.Â  Eventually he ran in the direction of another\r\n  responding officer who drew his gun and ordered Grant to â€œget on the ground.â€Â  Grant\r\n  instead changed direction and, after running into another officer who ordered\r\n  him to the ground, Grant submitted.Â  Id. at 823.Â  \r\nGrant\r\n  was convicted of resisting arrest.Â  On appeal he argued insufficient evidence\r\n  supported his conviction.Â  The court noted the relevant law declared:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  defendant resists arrest if â€œhe knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a\r\n  police officer, acting under color of his official authority, from effecting an\r\n  arrest of the actor or another; by: (1) using or threatening to use physical\r\n  force or violence against the police officer or another; or (2) using any other\r\n  means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police\r\n  officer or another.â€ \r\n\r\nId. at 823 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 268, Â§\r\n  32B(a)). \r\nThe\r\n  court explained â€œ â€˜the crime [of resisting arrest] is committed, if at all, at\r\n  the time of the â€˜effectingâ€™ of an arrest.â€™ â€ Id. (quoting Commonwealth\r\n    v. Grandison, 741 N.E.2d 25 (Mass. 2001)).Â  Under Massachusetts\r\n  jurisprudence, an arrest is effected when there is (1) an actual or\r\n  constructive seizure or detention of the person, (2) made with an intent to\r\n  arrest, and (3) the person detained so understands.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe standard\r\n  for determining whether a defendant understood that he is being arrested is\r\n  objectiveâ€”whether a reasonable person in the defendantâ€™s circumstances would\r\n  have so understood.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn Grant,\r\n  the court considered the timing of events critical to the analysis:Â  â€œWhen\r\n  [Grant] first fled, he had not been actually or constructively seized or detained.Â \r\n  The police had not told him to stop, nor informed him that he was under arrest\r\n  . . . .Â  Although it was clear that he ran to avoid and evade the police,\r\n  avoiding and evading the police was not the equivalent of resisting arrest,\r\n  particularly when the police had not spoken to [Grant] before he ran away.â€Â  Grant,\r\n  880 N.E.2d at 823-24.Â  Concerning the first element of effecting an arrest, the\r\n  court suggested that during the pursuit, the functional equivalent of a seizure\r\n  may have arisen at some point.Â  The police knew Grant had an outstanding\r\n  warrant and testified they intended to arrest him.Â  However, the Commonwealth\r\n  had to prove that â€œa reasonable person in [Grantâ€™s] position would have\r\n  understood that the seizure was to effect an arrest.â€Â  Id. at 824.Â  The\r\n  court found such evidence lacking: â€œOther than chasing the defendant, the\r\n  officers did not communicate with him in any way until right before he\r\n  submitted.â€Â  Id.Â Â  â€œDuring the defendantâ€™s flight from the police, there\r\n  was no evidence to prove that he understood that the officers were effecting an\r\n  arrest.Â  He was simply running away from them.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\tFleeing\r\n  from, or even resisting, a stop or patfrisk does not constitute the crime of\r\n  resisting arrest.Â  Although the officers here were intending to effect an\r\n  arrest, and not just stop or patfrisk, neither their words nor their actions\r\n  had objectively communicated that intention to the defendant prior to, or\r\n  during, the pursuit.Â  We believe such communication is required to satisfy the\r\n  requirement that a defendant understand he is being arrested.\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nLikewise, the Court\r\n  of Appeals of Ohio found evidence insufficient to support a resisting arrest\r\n  conviction in State v. Raines, 706 N.E.2d 414 (Ohio App. 3d 1997).Â  An officer\r\n  observed Raines lean into a running parked car and then place something into\r\n  his shoe.Â  The officer, who was on bicycle patrol in a high crime area,\r\n  approached Raines and told him to stop because he needed to speak with him, but\r\n  Raines fled.Â  With the officer commanding him to stop and telling him he was\r\n  under arrest, Raines ran into an apartment building to hide.Â  Id. at\r\n  415.Â  He was apprehended shortly thereafter and charged with resisting arrest\r\n  among other offenses.\r\nResisting arrest is\r\n  codified at Ohioâ€™s Revised Code 2921.33(A) which states â€œno person recklessly\r\n  or by force, shall resist or interfere with a lawful arrest of the person or\r\n  another.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\tA lawful\r\n  arrest is an element of this offense.Â  Although the officer testified that he\r\n  chased Raines and told Raines to stop because he was under arrest, this was not\r\n  so.Â  â€œ â€˜[A]n officer effects an arrest of a person whom he has authority to\r\n  arrest by laying his hand on him for the purpose of arresting him, though he\r\n  may not succeed in stopping and holding him.â€™ â€Â  \r\n\r\nRaines, 706 N.E.2d at 415 (quoting California v. Hodari\r\n  D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991)).\r\nIn a\r\n  case distinguishing between â€œresistingâ€ and â€œavoidingâ€, a defendant convicted\r\n  of resisting arrest under Arizonaâ€™s statute argued his fleeing by motorcycle\r\n  from pursuing officers did not constitute a violation as defined by statute.Â  State\r\n    v. Womack, 847 P.2d 609 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993).Â  The police attempted to\r\n  pull Womack over for having no taillight, but Womack instead initiated a chase\r\n  lasting several miles.Â  Once stopped, the arrest was made without further\r\n  incident.Â  Arizonaâ€™s resisting arrest statute expressed the offense:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tA person commits resisting arrest by intentionally \r\n\t\t\tpreventing or attempting to prevent a person reasonably known to him \r\n\t\t\tto be a peace officer, acting under color of such peace officerâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tofficial authority, from effecting an arrest by:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; Using or threatening to use\r\n  physical force against the peace officer or another; or\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t2.&nbsp; Using any other means creating a\r\n  substantial risk of causing physical injury to the peace officer or another.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAriz.

Â§ 13-2508 (2001).\r\nCharged\r\n  under section A(2), Womack contended fleeing did not create a factual basis for\r\n  the offense.Â  The court first determined the intent of the statute was to prohibit\r\n  â€œassaultive behavior directed toward an arresting officer, not an arresteeâ€™s\r\n  efforts to put as much space between himself and the officer.â€Â  Womack, 847\r\n  P.2d at 612.Â  Additionally, they noted\r\n  another Arizona statute more appropriately addressed and prohibited flight from\r\n  a pursuing law enforcement vehicle.Â  However, concerning flight in conjunction\r\n  with the resisting arrest statute, the court inculcated:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  defendantâ€™s flight was conduct which prevented, without the use of resistance,\r\n  the effectuation of his arrest.Â  In other words, such conduct constituted\r\n  avoiding arrest, not resisting arrest.Â  This interpretation of the statute\r\n  flows from what we deem to be a common sense application of the ordinary\r\n  meaning of the statutory language.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tBecause\r\n  we label defendantâ€™s conduct as avoiding arrest rather than resisting arrest,\r\n  we deem it appropriate to define those terms as we apply them herein.Â  Websterâ€™s\r\n    Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1003 (1988) defines â€œresistâ€ as follows:Â \r\n  â€œto exert force in oppositionâ€; â€œto exert oneself so as to counteract or\r\n  defeat,â€ â€œto withstand the force or effect of.â€Â  â€œResistanceâ€ is defined\r\n  similarly as â€œan opposing or retarding force.â€Â  Id.\r\n\tIn defining â€œresistâ€ as applied to the stateâ€™s\r\n  resisting arrest statute, the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court of\r\n  Connecticut stated that â€œ[t]he word [â€œresistâ€] is derived from the Latin, its\r\n  etymological meaning being â€œto stand againstâ€ or â€œto withstand.â€Â  It is the\r\n  opposition of force to forceâ€¦.Â  There must be actual opposition or\r\n    resistance, making necessary, under the circumstances, the use of force.â€Â  \r\n\tState\r\n      v. Avnayim, 24 Conn. Supp. 7, 185 A.2d 295, 298-99 (App. Ct. 1962)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n\tâ€œAvoidâ€ on the other hand, is defined as â€œto depart or\r\n  withdraw fromâ€ or to â€œkeep away from.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Ninth New Collegiate\r\n    College Dictionary 120 (1988).Â  In analyzing defendantâ€™s conduct, it\r\n  appears to us that â€œavoiding arrestâ€ most accurately describes his actions as\r\n  he fled from the officers.Â  When an individual is the object of an attempt to\r\n  effect his or her arrest, the individual may submit to the arrest, avoid the\r\n  arrest, or resist the arrest.Â  Only the latter conduct constitutes the\r\n  statutory offense of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nWomack, 847 P.2d at\r\n  613.Â  Applying this analysis to the present case, Brannon was not being placed\r\n  under arrest.Â  Instead, borrowing from the reasoning of the Arizona Court of\r\n  Appeals, his running from the officersâ€™ command to â€œstopâ€ amounts only to\r\n  avoidance of the officers.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the State argues other states have held that where officers\r\n  intend to arrest an individual who then flees in anticipation, convictions of\r\n  obstruction or resisting arrest without violence have been supported.Â  For\r\n  example, the State quotes from Wester v. State, 480 S.E.2d 921 (Ga. App.\r\n  1997):Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  evidence was sufficient to support Westerâ€™s conviction for misdemeanor\r\n  obstruction of an officer . . . the record shows that Wester fled from officers\r\n  after they identified themselves.Â  â€œ â€˜Under that evidence, the jury was\r\n  authorized to infer that [Wester] knew that a police officer was attempting to\r\n  perform his official duty . . . and to find that [Wester] deliberately took\r\n  action to delay, hamper or impede the officer in the performance of his duty.â€™\r\n  [Cit.]â€\r\n\r\nId. at 923.\r\nHowever,\r\n  Georgia Code Section 16-10-24(a) does not require an arrest being made, but\r\n  instead states in part:\r\n\r\n\t[A]\r\n  person who knowingly and willfully obstructs or hinders any law enforcement\r\n  officer in the lawful discharge of his official duties is guilty of a\r\n  misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nGa. Code Ann. Â§ 16-10-24(a) (emphasis added).Â  Unlike\r\n  South Carolina Code Section 16-9-320(A), Georgiaâ€™s statute applies to a broader\r\n  range of interactions with law enforcement officers.Â  See, e.g., Davis\r\n    v. State, 653 S.E.2d 358 (Ga. App. 2007) (defendant guilty of obstruction\r\n  of an officer under Â§ 16-10-24(a) for replacing barricade across a road after\r\n  officer earlier removed barricade and told him not to reconstruct it); Wynn\r\n    v. State, 511 S.E.2d 201 (Ga. App. 1999) (police\r\n  officer questioning teen about open beer can in car was acting within the scope\r\n  of his official duties).\r\nAnother\r\n  example of a statute that operates to criminalize not only resisting arrest but\r\n  flight from investigatory stops can be found in North Carolina General Statutes\r\n  Section 14-223 which propounds:\r\n\r\n\tIf any person shall willfully and unlawfully resist, delay or\r\n  obstruct a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge a duty of\r\n  his office, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Â§\r\n  14-223 (2005).\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Lynch, 380 S.E.2d 397 (N.C. App. Ct. 1989), a defendant tried to run\r\n  from and struggled with officers who were trying to determine his identity.Â  He\r\n  was charged with violation of Section 14-223, and the court clarified:\r\n\r\n\tThe conduct\r\n  proscribed under G.S. 14-223 is not limited to resisting an arrest but includes\r\n  any resistance, delay, or obstruction of an officer in the discharge of his\r\n  duties . . . .Â  Â [D]efendantâ€™s conviction may be based upon his conduct prior\r\n  to the time his actual arrest.\r\n\r\nId. at 398.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Section 16-9-320(A), plainly requires that an arrest is being\r\n  made.Â  To stretch the current statute to cover flight from an attempted\r\n  investigatory stop would violate the rule that it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a\r\n  clear and unambiguous statute. Â See City of Camden v. Brassell,\r\n  326 S.C. 556, 561, 486 S.E.2d 492, 495 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œWhere the language of\r\n  the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and\r\n  inject matters into it which are not in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nA\r\n  priori, there must be an arrest before there can be a conviction of resisting\r\n  arrest.Â  The videlicet of the statutory offense of resisting arrest is the\r\n  existence of a lawful arrest.Â  Prefatorily, a prosecution for resisting arrest\r\n  fails if there is no arrest of the offender.Â  The officers in the case at bar\r\n  were in an investigatory phase when Brannon ran.Â  No arrest was being made at\r\n  the time of his flight as is required by Section 16-9-320(A).Â  While the\r\n  officers testified to their suspicions of a crime being committed, Scruggs\r\n  admitted they initially wanted to question Brannon.\r\nWe\r\n  understand the Stateâ€™s concerns should suspects be permitted to flee a scene.Â  However,\r\n  this court is indubitably constrained to apply the law as written.Â  The statute\r\n  does not extend to investigatory stops or detentions, and such inclusions\r\n  cannot be implied by this court.Â  The trial judge erred in denying Brannonâ€™s\r\n  motion for a directed verdict on the resisting arrest charge.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  dissenting:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Based on the record before us, I\r\n  believe the trial court properly denied Ricky Brannonâ€™s directed verdict motion\r\n  as to the resisting arrest charge.Â  I vote to affirm.\r\nDuring\r\n  the early morning hours of April 21, 2003, Ricky Brannon went to the Westwood\r\n  Apartments in Gaffney, South Carolina, for the purpose of breaking in\r\n  vehicles.Â  Maria Rainey, a resident of the apartment complex, looked outside\r\n  and noticed that the interior light of her car was on.Â  Brannon was\r\n  inside Raineyâ€™s vehicle.Â  Rainey called 911. Gaffney city police officers\r\n  Michael Scruggs and Randy Quinn were dispatched to the Westwood Apartments.\r\nThe\r\n  911 dispatcher coordinated communications.Â  Rainey informed the police\r\n  dispatcher that Brannon had broken in another car, a Ford Explorer.Â Â Â  Officers\r\n  Scruggs and Quinn were alerted to the break-in of the Explorer as they\r\n  arrived.Â  The officers parked a short distance away and quietly approached the\r\n  crime in progress.Â  As the uniformed officers rounded the corner to Building\r\n  800 of the apartment complex, they observed Brannon next to the Explorerâ€”the\r\n  door was open and the carâ€™s interior light was on.Â  Brannon saw the uniformed\r\n  officers and immediately bolted.Â  The officers gave chase, shouting â€œstop,\r\n  police!â€Â  Brannon continued to flee and disregarded the officersâ€™ commands to\r\n  stop, but he was ultimately apprehended in front of Building 1100 of the\r\n  complex, about 300 yards from where the pursuit began.\r\nBrannon\r\n  was convicted on all charges, yet the sole issue before us is whether, viewing\r\n  the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, there was any evidence\r\n  that Brannonâ€™s attempt to avoid police detention falls within our resisting\r\n  arrest statute, section 16-9-320 of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  Based on\r\n  the directed verdict grounds asserted in the trial court, together with the unchallenged\r\n  jury charge, I would affirm the denial of the directed verdict motion.\r\nThe\r\n  majority has expanded upon Brannonâ€™s directed verdict motion, as well as his\r\n  final brief.Â  I am not aware of any rule or procedure which allows this Court\r\n  to expand an appellantâ€™s argument to justify a reversal of the trial court.\r\nIn\r\n  moving for a directed verdict and arguing an arrest never took place, Brannonâ€™s\r\n  counsel argued:\r\n\r\n\tI would\r\n  move for a directed verdict on the resisting arrest count because both officers\r\n  testified that they never told Mr. Brannon or said he or tried, attempted to\r\n  place him under arrest until after they caught him.Â  They just came up on him,\r\n  stop police, he took off running, they ran after him.Â  There was never any stop\r\n  police, youâ€™re under arrest.Â  In fact, one officer testified that he, they\r\n  werenâ€™t going to place him under arrest until they were actually able to talk\r\n  to him and determine what went on.\r\n\tSo, I would move for a directed verdict on the\r\n  resisting arrest based on the fact that he was never placed under arrest.\r\n\r\nAs\r\n  counsel summarized his position, he told the trial court, â€œNow, if he says\r\n  stop, youâ€™re under arrest, you have to stop at that point in time.Â  Youâ€™re\r\n  resisting arrest if he says youâ€™re under arrest.Â  But just stop by itself is\r\n  not sufficient to give grounds for resisting arrest.â€Â  This was the heart of\r\n  counselâ€™s closing argument to the jury: â€œDid they ever place him under arrest?Â \r\n  Did they ever say stop, youâ€™re under arrest?Â  No, just stop police.â€\r\nThe\r\n  argument presented in the trial court forms no basis for the rationale of the\r\n  majority in reversing.Â  Indeed, the majority relies on an exhaustive Fourth\r\n  Amendment â€œseizureâ€ analysis that is nowhere to be found in the record or\r\n  Appellantâ€™s final brief.Â  The majority opinion even refutes Brannonâ€™s\r\n  concession at trial that â€œ[y]ouâ€™re resisting arrest if [the officer] says\r\n  youâ€™re under arrest.â€Â  Cf. State v. Williams, 237 S.C. 252, 257, 116 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1960)\r\n  (stating a formal declaration of arrest is not necessary to effectuate an\r\n  arrest).\r\nAs\r\n  for the jury charge, there was no\r\n  definition or consideration of the statutory term â€œarrest.â€Â  The only relevant\r\n  term defined for the jury was â€œresist.â€[2]Â \r\n  The trial court charged the jury: â€œEven peaceful nonviolent indirect\r\n  obstruction of an arrest . . . is considered resisting arrest.Â  If the means\r\n  used are sufficient to prevent the officer from making an arrest, the defendant\r\n  is guilty of resisting arrest.â€Â  There was no exception to the charge.Â  When\r\n  viewing the particular facts of this case juxtaposed to the unchallenged jury\r\n  instruction, there is certainly evidence that Brannonâ€™s fleeing and disobeying\r\n  the officersâ€™ commands to stop amounted\r\n  to resisting an arrest.\r\nI\r\n  would, therefore, adhere to general principles of issue preservation and the\r\n  law of the case doctrine to affirm the denial of the motion for directed\r\n  verdict.\r\nIf\r\n  this Court were free to refine and recast Brannonâ€™s arguments in the trial\r\n  court and on appeal, I would still lean to affirm.Â  As I will explain below,\r\n  the essence of my position is that: (1) per South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  precedent, the term â€œarrestâ€ in section 16-9-320 encompasses a process, not a\r\n  single act; (2) under the common law, the process of an arrest does not necessarily require the application of actual force\r\n  or manual touching of the body; and (3) under the particular facts and\r\n  circumstances of this case, a reasonably prudent law enforcement officer had\r\n  probable cause to arrest Brannon for the felony of breaking in a motor vehicle\r\n  at the time of the initial encounter.\r\nIn\r\n  light of the particular facts presented, I would construe the intent of the\r\n  South Carolina General Assembly to include Brannonâ€™s conduct as resisting\r\n  arrest under section 16-9-320(A), which states, â€œ[i]t is unlawful for a person knowingly and wilfully . . . to resist\r\n  an arrest being made by one whom the person knows or reasonably should know is\r\n  a law enforcement officer, whether under process or not.â€\r\nThe\r\n  term â€œarrestâ€ is not defined in section 16-9-320.Â  I would begin an assessment\r\n  of statutory construction of section 16-9-320 with South Carolina case law.Â  In State v. Dowd, 306 S.C. 268, 269-70, 411 S.E.2d 428, 429 (1991) the\r\n  supreme court held an arrest is an ongoing process and affirmed Dowdâ€™s\r\n  conviction of resisting arrest by blocking the jail cell door with his arm and\r\n  leg when officers attempted to place Dowd in his cell.Â  In Dowd, our\r\n  supreme court cited with approval the North Carolina case of State v. Leake,\r\n  which holds that an â€œarrest also includes â€˜bringing the person personally\r\n  within the custody and control of the law.â€™â€Â  State v. Leake, 181 S.E.2d\r\n  224, 226 (N.C. Ct. App. 1971) (quoting Hadley\r\n    v. Tinnin, 86 S.E. 1017, 1019\r\n  (N.C. 1915)).\r\nThe\r\n  novel question before us is identifying the initiation of the arrest process.Â  I read our\r\n  supreme courtâ€™s decision in State v Williams, 237 S.C. 252, 116 S.E.2d\r\n  858 (1960) as recognizing that the concept of arrest is not a rigid and\r\n  inflexible concept. Â The particular facts\r\n  of each case are determinative.\r\nThe court in State v. Williams held that â€œâ€˜[t]o\r\n  constitute an arrest, there must be an actual or constructive seizure or\r\n  detention of the person, performed with the intention to effect an arrest and\r\n  so understood by the person detained.â€™â€Â  237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860\r\n  (quoting Jenkins v. United States, 161 F.2d 99, 101 (10th Cir. 1947)).Â \r\n  The supreme court provided further guidance:\r\n\r\n\tIt is not necessary\r\n  â€œthat there be an application of actual force, or manual touching of the body,\r\n  or physical restraint which may be visible to the eye, or a formal declaration\r\n  of arrest; it is sufficient if the person arrested understands that he is in\r\n  the power of the one arresting and submits in consequence.Â  However, in all\r\n  cases in which there is no manual touching or seizure or any resistance, the\r\n  intentions of the parties to the transaction are very important; there must\r\n  have been intent on the part of one of them to arrest the other, and intent on\r\n  the part of such other to submit, under the belief and impression that\r\n  submission was necessary.Â  There can be no arrest where the person sought to be\r\n  arrested is not conscious of any restraint of his liberty.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Williams, 237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860-61 (quoting 4 Am.\r\n  Jur. Arrest Â§ 2 (Supp. 1960)).\r\nState\r\n  v. Williams analyzed the term â€œarrestâ€\r\n  through a common law framework and that common law understanding of the term is\r\n  entitled to weight. We are a common law state.Â  â€œResisting arrest is one form\r\n  of the common law offense of obstructing\r\n  justice; and the use of force is not an essential ingredient of it.â€Â  City\r\n    of Columbia v. Bouie, 239 S.C. 570, 574,\r\n  124 S.E.2d 332, 333 (1962), revâ€™d on other grounds, 378 U.S. 347 (1964).Â \r\n  In the absence of an express statutory definition, it is entirely reasonable for a South Carolina court to consider the\r\n  common law meaning of the term â€œarrestâ€ in discerning the legislative intent\r\n  underlying section 16-9-320.\r\nThe\r\n  posture of State v. Williams was an appeal from the denial of a directed\r\n  verdict.Â  The court held that, under the facts presented, it could not rule on\r\n  the matter of arrest â€œas a matter of law.â€Â  237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at\r\n  860.Â  I would similarly decline to find error in this case in the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  refusal to direct a verdict.Â  The above guideposts from State v. Williamsâ€”an\r\n  arrest entails an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person and\r\n  does not always require application of force or manual touching, or a formal\r\n  declaration of arrestâ€”lead me to reject a rigid definition of arrest.Â  As the\r\n  majority observes, â€œBrannon had neither been physically touched for the purpose\r\n  of restraint nor had he submitted to a show of authority at the time of his\r\n  flight.â€Â  These factors highlighted by the majority do not in my judgment\r\n  remove the issue from one of fact (properly resolved by the jury) to one of\r\n  law.\r\nI\r\n  acknowledge that a closer question is presented as to the intentions of the\r\n  police officers, for State v. Williams instructs that in the absence of\r\n  manual touching, â€œthe intentions of the parties to the transaction are very\r\n  important.â€Â  237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860.Â  Much is made of Officer\r\n  Scruggsâ€™ testimony that he initially wanted to merely detain Brannon.Â  Yet I\r\n  believe the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State,\r\n  permits an inference that Brannon was under â€œarrest.â€Â  See Id. (â€œTo constitute an arrest, there must be an actual or constructive seizure or\r\n  detention of the person, performed with the intention to effect an arrest and\r\n  so understood by the person detained.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  officersâ€™ testimony reveals the following: based on the information received\r\n  from the 911 dispatcher coupled with their observations of Brannon next to the\r\n  Ford Explorer (with its door opened and inside light on), a reasonably prudent\r\n  police officer would have cause to believe that Brannon was committing the\r\n  felony of breaking into a motor vehicle.Â  In fact, Officer Scruggs so stated\r\n  when he was questioned about his belief upon his first sighting of Brannon: \r\nQ: Did you\r\n  believe [Brannon] was the individual that was breaking into cars?\r\nA: Yes, sir.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  when cross-examined about the timing of the custodial arrest, Officer Scruggs\r\n  stated that Brannon was placed under arrest â€œafter we caught him.â€Â  The\r\n  testimony of Officer Quinn is similar, for he described the chase, observing that\r\n  â€œBrannon ran this path here and the 1100 building is here and he was arrested\r\n  right here.â€Â  Officer Quinn was additionally asked, â€œwhat was your\r\n  intention when the subject took off?â€Â  He responded, â€œOur intention was to\r\n  approach the subject and find out exactly what he was doing there and at that\r\n  time.Â  We believe [sic] he was breaking into a motor vehicle and we placed him\r\n  under arrest for that charge.â€Â  Taking the officersâ€™ testimony as a\r\n  whole, and construing it in a light most favorable to the State, I would find\r\n  there was sufficient evidence of intent to arrest Brannon.[3]\r\nIt\r\n  is the presence of probable cause to arrest for breaking in a motor vehicle (a\r\n  class F felony) at the time of the initial encounter which lies at the core of\r\n  my view that the process of arrest was underway when the officers caught\r\n  Brannon in the act.Â  Concerning probable cause, we are guided by Fourth\r\n  Amendment jurisprudence.Â  In this regard, an officerâ€™s â€œ[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause\r\n  Fourth Amendment analysis.â€Â  Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996). Â The proper inquiry is an\r\n  objective one, based on what would a reasonable police officer believe under\r\n  the same circumstances.Â  Id. at 810-13.Â  In this case, a reasonably\r\n  prudent officer would have probable cause to arrest Brannon at the initial\r\n  encounter.Â  Brannonâ€™s location and conduct exactly matched the witnessâ€™s\r\n  description, as Brannon was standing next to the Ford Explorer with an open\r\n  door in the otherwise deserted parking lot late at night.\r\nThe\r\n  question of intent from Brannonâ€™s perspective is clear.Â  Brannon was breaking\r\n  into vehicles in an apartment complex in the middle of the night.Â  When he was\r\n  surprised by the two uniformed police officers, he ran and tried to avoid\r\n  arrest.Â  Any reasonably prudent person in Brannonâ€™s position would not have the\r\n  slightest doubt that the pursuing officers intended to place him in custody.Â  See 5 Am. Jur. 2d Arrest Â§ 4 (2007) (â€œPolice\r\n  detention constitutes an â€˜arrestâ€™ if a reasonable person in the suspectâ€™s\r\n  position would understand the situation to be a restraint on freedom of the\r\n  kind that the law typically associates with a formal arrest.â€).Â  Without\r\n  a doubt, Brannon was â€œconscious of [the] restraint of his liberty.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Williams, 237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 861.\r\nAn\r\n  arrest is defined as depriving a â€œperson of his liberty by legal authority.â€Â \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 109 (6th ed. 1990).Â  The definition continues to\r\n  explain, â€œ[a]ll that is required for an â€˜arrestâ€™ is some act by officer indicating\r\n  his intention to detain or take person into custody and thereby subject that\r\n  person to the actual control and will of the officer.â€Â  Id. at 110.Â \r\n  This comprehensive definition lines up with other authorities addressing the\r\n  breadth and scope of the concept of arrest.Â  See 6A CJS Arrest Â§ 1 (2004) (â€œAn arrest is the taking, seizing, or\r\n  detaining the person of another by any act which indicates an intention to take\r\n  him or her into custody and subject the person arrested to the actual control\r\n  and will of the person making the arrest.â€).\r\nI\r\n  will respond briefly to other South Carolina cases cited by the majority.Â  As\r\n  an initial observation, neither the facts nor law of these cases warrants\r\n  reversal of Brannonâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  The focus of Bouie was\r\n  whether the defendant resisted arrest by a â€œmomentary delay in\r\n  responding to the officerâ€™s command.â€Â  239 S.C. at 574, 124 S.E.2d at 333.Â  Bouie says nothing about the meaning of the term â€œarrest.â€Â  Id.Â  In Fernandez\r\n    v. State, 306 S.C. 264, 265, 411, S.E.2d 426, 427 (1991), Fernandez was\r\n  simply standing among a group of people.Â  There was no reason to believe that\r\n  Fernandez was engaged in any criminal activity.Â  Id.Â  Yet Fernandez ran\r\n  as police officers approached, prompting the officers to pursue.Â  Id.Â  During the pursuit Fernandez discarded drugs.Â  Id.Â  The legal issue in\r\n  Fernandez was determining at what point the defendant had been â€œseizedâ€ under\r\n  the Fourth Amendment for purposes of ruling on his motion to suppress.Â  Id.Â  The meaning of the term â€œarrestâ€ in section 16-9-320 played no role in Fernandez.Â  Id.\r\nI\r\n  view the matter of legislative intent of the statutory term â€œarrestâ€ under\r\n  section 16-9-320 as a different proposition from the purely constitutional\r\n  question of what constitutes a â€œseizureâ€ under the Fourth Amendment.Â  The\r\n  concepts may often overlap, but I do not believe that an arrest under section\r\n  16-9-320 must be construed in exact parity with a Fourth Amendment seizure.\r\nA\r\n  Fourth Amendment seizure is always an act, never a process.Â  See California\r\n    v. Hodari, 499 U.S. 621, 629 (1991) (holding the subject was only seized\r\n  when he was tackled by an officer); Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S.\r\n  593, 596-99 (1989) (stating a roadblock was a seizure as a seizure occurs â€œonly\r\n  when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through\r\n    means intentionally appliedâ€) (emphasis in original)); Thompson v.\r\n      Whitman, 85 U.S. 457, 471 (1873) (stating that, in a vessel seizure case,\r\n  â€œ[a] seizure is a single act, and not a continuous factâ€); Blackâ€™s Law\r\n  Dictionary 1363 (7th ed. 1999) (defining seizure as â€œ[t]he act of an instance\r\n  of taking possession of a person or property by legal right or processâ€).Â  Conversely,\r\n  as State v. Dowd instructs, the term â€œarrestâ€ in section 16-9-320\r\n  contemplates a process.Â  306 S.C. at 270, 411 S.E.2d at 429.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even a limited Terry v. Ohio[4] detention based on articulable suspicion constitutes a seizure under the Fourth\r\n  Amendment.Â  See Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. Â Â Â Â Â , 127 S. Ct. 2400, 2405 (2007) (holding that â€œ[a] person is seized by the police\r\n  and thus entitled to challenge the\r\n  governmentâ€™s action under the Fourth Amendment when the officer, â€˜ â€œby means of\r\n  physical force or show of authority,â€ â€™ terminates or restrains his freedom of\r\n  movementâ€) (quoting Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991)\r\n  (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19, n.16 (1968))).Â  Yet we all\r\n  acknowledge that an individual fleeing from an attempted Terry v. Ohio detention would not constitute resisting arrest under section 16-9-320, for the\r\n  element of arrest would be lacking.Â  That scenario presents a Fourth Amendment\r\n  seizure but not an arrest under section 16-9-320.Â  I therefore conclude that it\r\n  is inappropriate to equate a Fourth Amendment seizure with the term â€œarrestâ€ in\r\n  section 16-9-320.\r\nThe\r\n  majority has done a laudable effort in citing to statutes and case law from\r\n  other jurisdictions.Â  I see no reason to rely so heavily on the law of other\r\n  jurisdictions.Â  I believe our jurisprudence is sufficient to resolve this\r\n  appeal.Â  And if my reliance on South Carolina law, with its common law\r\n  antecedents, for discerning the meaning of the statutory term â€œarrestâ€ is\r\n  misplaced, I believe our supreme court should resolve the matter and its\r\n  concomitant policy implications.\r\nI\r\n  add one final observation that I believe supports my assessment of legislative\r\n  intent of the term â€œarrestâ€ in section 16-9-320.Â  The Legislature created two\r\n  separate offenses for resisting arrest.Â  Brannon was convicted of violating\r\n  subsection (A) of section 16-9-320, which makes it a one-year misdemeanor to\r\n  merely resist arrest.Â  The Legislature further enacted subsection (B) of\r\n  section 16-9-320, which makes it a ten-year felony to assault an officer while\r\n  resisting an arrest.Â  Subsection (B) states:\r\n\r\n\tIt\r\n  is unlawful for a person to knowingly and wilfully . . . assault, beat, or\r\n  wound an officer when the person is resisting an arrest being made by one whom\r\n  the person knows or reasonably should know is a law enforcement officer,\r\n  whether under process or not. A person who violates the provisions of this\r\n  subsection is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not less\r\n  than one thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned not\r\n  more than ten years, or both.\r\n\r\nSubsection (B)\r\n  provides an enhanced penalty when a defendant assaults, beats, or wounds the\r\n  arresting officer.Â  It is in subsection (B) where we find the physicality\r\n  component which is a feature of the majority opinion.Â  Construing resisting\r\n  arrest under the subsection (A) misdemeanor offense in line with the broad\r\n  common law understanding of the term is a reasonable construction, and one that\r\n  comports with the marked distinction given the separate offenses by the\r\n  Legislature.\r\nThe majorityâ€™s\r\n  bright line approach of an actual, hands-on seizure would most assuredly\r\n  facilitate application of section 16-9-320.Â  Yet I believe such a formulaic\r\n  approach would result in artificial distinctions not intended by the\r\n  Legislature.Â  Say, for example, a police officer has probable cause to arrest\r\n  an individual and the suspect is aware of the officerâ€™s intent to arrest him.Â \r\n  In one scenario, the officer approaches the suspect but the suspect flees as\r\n  the officerâ€™s attempt to grab the suspect comes up inches short.Â  In a second\r\n  scenario, the same facts are present except the officer has a momentary grasp\r\n  of the suspect before the suspect flees.Â  Did the Legislature intend for the\r\n  resisting arrest statute to apply in the second scenario but not the first?Â  I\r\n  think not.Â  Moreover, a consideration of the facts of each case, as I propose,\r\n  gives meaning to the holding in State v. Williams that an arrest may\r\n  occur without the application of actual force or manual touching of the body.Â  237\r\n  S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, I vote to affirm and adhere to my view that the reasoning of the majority\r\n  opinion includes arguments never advanced by Brannon at trial or in his brief.Â \r\n  I would affirm on issue preservation principles and the law of the case\r\n  doctrine.Â  I do address the substance of the majority opinion, albeit with\r\n  reservation because of the policy implications involved.Â  In voting to affirm\r\n  the denial of the directed verdict motion, I would apply our resisting arrest\r\n  statute to a fleeing suspect only in very narrow circumstances.Â  As emphasized\r\n  above, under the particular facts of this case, when objectively viewed, it is\r\n  the presence of probable cause to believe that Brannon was committing a felony\r\n  that gives rise to the application of the misdemeanor offense of resisting\r\n  arrest under subsection (A) of 16-9-320.Â  I would hold that a person violates\r\n  section 16-9-320(A) irrespective of the lack of physical contact: (1) when a\r\n  law enforcement officer, from an objective standpoint, has probable cause to\r\n  believe a person has committed a crime; and (2) the law enforcement officer\r\n  through words or actions makes known his intent to arrest or otherwise detain\r\n  the person; and (3) the person, from an objective standpoint, recognizes the\r\n  presence of a law enforcement officer and understands the intent of the officer\r\n  to arrest him; and (4) the person attempts to avoid the arrest by impeding,\r\n  hindering, or obstructing the law enforcement officer, by means of fleeing from\r\n  the officer or other method of resisting or opposing the arrest.Â  This initial\r\n  offense would terminate upon the full custodial arrest of the suspect or the\r\n  suspension of the pursuit by the law enforcement officer.\r\nViewing\r\n  the evidence and the reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the\r\n  State, I would find a jury question was presented as to the charge of resisting\r\n  arrest under section 16-9-320(A).Â  I would affirm the denial of the directed\r\n  verdict motion.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; The jury was charged that â€œ[r]esist means to\r\n  oppose, strive against, or obstruct or obstruct by means to impede, hinder, or\r\n  interfere with.â€ \r\n[3]&nbsp; This assessment is admittedly problematic, for\r\n  the jury was never charged on the law of â€œarrestâ€ under section 16-9-320.Â  This\r\n  difficulty highlights the soundness of issue preservation rules which are\r\n  designed to ensure that the issues considered on appeal are the same ones\r\n  raised in the trial court.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Terry v.

Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4429\r\n  Submitted June 2, 2008 â€“ Filed July 23,\r\n2008\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Hemphill P. Pride, II, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Christian Stegmaier, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:Â  This appeal arises from the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary\r\n  judgment in favor of Babcock Center and its employee, Nancy Watkins, on Carrie\r\n  and Robert Williamsesâ€™ claims for defamation and the intentional infliction of\r\n  emotional distress. Â On appeal, the Williamses argue the court erred in finding\r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s Omnibus Adult Protection Act shields Babcock Center and Watkins from civil liability for claims stemming from their reporting the suspected\r\n  abuse of a vulnerable adult.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1991, the Department of Social Services (DSS) placed an eight-year old, disabled\r\n  child (Client) in Carrie Williamsâ€™s (Caregiverâ€™s) licensed, therapeutic foster\r\n  care home. Â Caregiverâ€™s husband, Robert Williams, also lived in the home.[2]Â  Caregiver subsequently contracted with Babcock Center to operate a CTH, and she continued to care for Client in her home until\r\n2004.Â  \r\nOn January 7, 2004, while attending a program at Babcock Center, Client told administrator, Nancy Watkins, of specific actions toward her by\r\n  Caregiverâ€™s husband.Â  Client was now twenty-one years old, and Watkins believed\r\n  the conduct Client described to her was sexually abusive. Â Watkins immediately notified\r\n  consulting psychologist, Dr. Wilton Hellams, of Clientâ€™s disclosure.Â  That\r\n  evening, Client met with Dr. Hellams and repeated her specific allegations\r\n  against Caregiverâ€™s husband. Â Following the counseling session, Dr. Hellams told\r\n  Watkins he found Clientâ€™s allegations to be credible.Â  As a result, Watkins immediately\r\n  moved Client to a respite-care home. Â \r\nPursuant to South Carolina law, DDSN regulations,\r\n  and Babcock Center policy, the following day, Watkins reported Clientâ€™s statements\r\n  to the Sheriffâ€™s Department and the Adult Protective Services (APS) Program of DSS.\r\n  Â Three months later, DSS notified Watkins its investigation had indicated â€œthere\r\n  was a potential for abuseâ€ of Client in Caretakerâ€™s home. Â Upon receiving the\r\n  APS report, the Center terminated its CTH contract with Caretaker. Â \r\nSubsequently, Caretaker and her husband\r\n  filed an action against Babcock Center and Watkins alleging defamation and the intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress.Â  As an affirmative defense to these claims, Babcock Center and Watkins asserted South Carolinaâ€™s Omnibus Adult Protection Act shielded them\r\n  from civil and criminal liability related to reporting Clientâ€™s statements\r\n  alleging sexual abuse by Caretakerâ€™s husband.Â  The circuit court conducted a\r\n  hearing on September 23, 2005, and granted summary judgment on both actions in favor\r\n  of Babcock Center and Watkins.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this court applies the same standard\r\n  that governs the trial court; summary judgment is proper when there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment\r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857,\r\n  860 (2002); see also Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œOn appeal from an order\r\n  granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities,\r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most\r\n  favorable to the appellant . . . .â€Â  Willis v. Wu., 362 S.C. 146, 151,\r\n  607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œplain,\r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.â€\r\n  Â Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 445, 415 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCaretaker and her\r\n  husband argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Babcock Center and Watkins because genuine issues of material fact remain regarding their\r\n  actions for defamation and the intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nThe Omnibus Adult\r\n  Protection Act\r\nIn\r\n  1993, South Carolinaâ€™s General Assembly enacted the Omnibus Adult Protection\r\n  Act (â€œthe Actâ€) to protect vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect, and\r\n  exploitation.Â  1993 Act No. 110, Â§ 1, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 43-35-5 to -595\r\n  (Supp. 2007).[3]Â  \r\nA. Vulnerable Adults \r\nThe\r\n  Act promulgated statutes designed to protect a class of adults from abuse,\r\n  neglect, and exploitation.Â  The Act defines a â€œvulnerable adultâ€ as:\r\n\r\n  [A]\r\n    person eighteen years of age or older who has a physical or mental condition\r\n    which substantially impairs the person from adequately\r\n    providing for his or her own care or protection. Â This includes a person who is\r\n    impaired in the ability to adequately provide for the personâ€™s own care or\r\n    protection because of the infirmities of aging including, but not limited to,\r\n    organic brain damage, advanced age, and physical, mental, or emotional dysfunction.\r\n    Â A resident of a facility is a vulnerable adult. Â Â \r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-10 (Supp. 2007). [4] \r\nWe\r\n  find Client is a â€œvulnerable adultâ€ under the Act because she is over eighteen\r\n  years old, unable to provide for her own care or protection, and a resident of\r\n  a facility.Â  Accordingly, Client is entitled to special protections from abuse,\r\n  neglect, and exploitation. Â \r\nB. Mandated Reporters \r\nThe\r\n  Act imposes a duty on certain individuals to report if they have â€œreason to\r\n  believe that a vulnerable adult has been or is likely to be abused, neglected,\r\n  or exploited.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-25(A) (Supp. 2007). Â Individuals\r\n  designated as â€œmandated reportersâ€ under the Act include physicians, nurses,\r\n  dentists, optometrists, medical examiners, coroners, and other medical, mental\r\n  health or allied health professionals, Christian Science practitioners,\r\n  religious healers, school teachers, counselors, psychologists, mental health or\r\n  mental retardation specialists, social or public assistance workers, caregivers,\r\n  staff or volunteers of an adult day care center or facilities, and law\r\n  enforcement officers. Â Id. Â Furthermore, the Act also requires reporting\r\n  by â€œany other person who has actual knowledge that a vulnerable adult has been\r\n  abused, neglected, or exploited.â€ Â Id.[5]Â \r\n  Reporting the suspected conduct within twenty-four hours or the following\r\n  working day is the reporterâ€™s individual responsibility.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  43-35-25(C)-(D) (Supp. 2007).Â  Provided the Actâ€™s mandatory reporting\r\n  requirements are met, the reporter may additionally report suspected abuse,\r\n  neglect, or exploitation directly to law enforcement; â€œand in cases of emergency,\r\n  serious injury, or suspected sexual assault, law enforcement must be contacted immediately.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-25(G) (Supp.\r\n  2007). Â \r\nWe\r\n  find Watkinsâ€™s duties as a social worker and program administrator make her a\r\n  mandated reporter under the Act.Â  Accordingly, the Act imposes a duty on her to\r\n  report Clientâ€™s statements, which gave Watkins â€œreason to believeâ€ Caregiverâ€™s\r\n  husband sexually assaulted Client.Â  Additionally, because Watkins suspected\r\n  sexual assault, the Act required her to report Clientâ€™s statements to both APS and law enforcement.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-25 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing before the circuit court, Caregiverâ€™s counsel contended Watkins â€œshould\r\n  have considered the source and nature of the complaint.â€ Â In stating Watkins â€œreported\r\n  a spurious allegation made by a profoundly mentally and physically handicapped\r\n  young lady,â€ counsel implies allegations of abusive conduct made by a\r\n  vulnerable adult, such as Client, should be taken less seriously by a mandated\r\n  reporter than if they were made by a functionally-average adult.Â  Clearly, such\r\n  an interpretation is contrary to the General Assemblyâ€™s intent to provide enhanced\r\n  protections to adults who are particularly vulnerable to mistreatment.Â  Moreover,\r\n  we believe the General Assembly established brief time limits for reporting\r\n  precisely to discourage second-guessing by mandated reporters.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Act defines abuse, neglect, and exploitation; however, neither the Act nor our\r\n  courts have addressed the perspective from which a mandated reporter should\r\n  view the vulnerable adultâ€™s allegations.Â  The Minnesota Court of Appeals specifically\r\n  addressed this question while construing a statute under its similar, Vulnerable\r\n  Adults Act.Â  In re Kleven, 736 N.W.2d 707 (Minn. Ct. App. 2007).Â  In Kleven,\r\n  an employee of a group home for disabled men argued the verbal abuse she\r\n  allegedly had inflicted upon the men should be viewed from the perspective of\r\n  the residents, all vulnerable adults, rather than from the perspective of a\r\n  reasonable person.Â  Id. at 710. Â However, the court held in Kleven that to accept such an argument â€œwould mean that the more vulnerable the adult,\r\n  the worse his caretaker could permissibly treat him.Â  . . .Â  [This]\r\n  interpretation is an affront to the purpose of the act and leads to absurd\r\n  results, which we presume the legislature did not intend.â€ Â Id. at 711. Â \r\nWe\r\n  find Watkins, by promptly reporting Clientâ€™s statements to APS and law\r\n  enforcement, acted precisely as the Act intended.\r\nC. Immunity from Liability\r\nHaving\r\n  determined Client is a vulnerable adult and Watkins is a mandated reporter,\r\n  whose duty to report was triggered by Clientâ€™s statements, we turn next to\r\n  whether the Act shields Watkins and Babcock Center from civil and criminal\r\n  liability that could otherwise arise from the act of reporting.Â  \r\n\r\n  A\r\n    person who, acting in good faith, reports pursuant to this chapter or who\r\n    participates in an investigation or judicial proceeding resulting from a report\r\n    is immune from civil and criminal liability which may otherwise result by\r\n    reason of this action. Â In a civil or criminal proceeding good faith is a\r\n    rebuttable presumption.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-75(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nAccording to the affidavit of APS supervisor, Judy Irvin,\r\n  Watkins reported Clientâ€™s suspected sexual abuse â€œin good faith.â€Â  Furthermore, under the Act, a report of the abuse,\r\n  neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult is presumably made â€œin good\r\n  faith.â€ Â Caretaker fails to produce evidence that defeats the presumption that\r\n  Watkins reported in good faith.Â  Additionally, our review of the record\r\n  confirms Watkins reported Clientâ€™s suspected abuse in good faith.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we conclude Watkins and Babcock Center are immune from any potential liability\r\nflowing from the report.[6]\r\nD. Penalties for Failure\r\n  to Report \r\nCaretaker\r\n  and her husband further allege Watkins improperly reported Clientâ€™s allegations\r\n  to the Sheriffâ€™s Department and DSS.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  the contrary, a mandated reporter who has actual knowledge that abuse, neglect,\r\n  or exploitation of a vulnerable adult has occurred, and who knowingly and willfully\r\n  fails to report this knowledge is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction,\r\n  the person must be fined in an amount up to $2,500 or imprisoned up to\r\n  one year. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-85(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  Furthermore, a mandated\r\n  reporter with reason to believe abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable\r\n  adult has occurred, or is likely to occur, and who knowingly and willfully\r\n  fails to report is subject to disciplinary action by the appropriate licensing\r\n  board.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, we find Watkins properly reported Clientâ€™s\r\n  allegations to law enforcement and DSS.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFinding no genuine\r\n  issue exists as to any material fact, we hold the Act entitles Watkins and Babcock Center to immunity from all civil and criminal liability related to their good\r\n  faith report of the suspected abuse of a vulnerable adult.Â  Additionally, under\r\n  these facts, a failure to report the suspected sexual abuse would have resulted\r\n  in a violation of the law, subjected a mandated reporter to penalties, and most\r\n  importantly, subjected a vulnerable adult to the continuing potential for\r\n  abuse.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This case was decided without oral argument pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The\r\n  South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN) contracted\r\n  with Babcock Center to provide programs for vulnerable adults and to supervise\r\n  their care in licensed community training\r\nhomes (CTHs).Â  \r\n[3] The purpose of the Act was to: address the continuing\r\n  needs of vulnerable adults; define abuse, neglect, and exploitation in a\r\n  uniform manner, without regard to setting; clarify reporting requirements; provide\r\n  victims with emergency protective custody; define the courtâ€™s role in adult\r\n  protection; and provide civil and criminal penalties to perpetrators of the abuse,\r\n  neglect, or exploitation of vulnerable adults.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 43-35-5 (Supp. 2007).\r\n[4] Under the Act, a â€œfacilityâ€ includes a nursing care,\r\n  community residential care, or psychiatric facility, as well as any other\r\n  â€œresidential program operated or contracted for operation by the Department of\r\n  Mental Health or [DDSN].â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.

Garrison Hill, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4430\r\n  Submitted June 2, 2008 â€“ Filed July 23,\r\n2008\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, South Carolina Commission\r\n          on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, Office of the Attorney General, all of\r\n          Columbia; and Solicitor Robert Mills Ariail of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In\r\n  this criminal case, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s determination that Elbert\r\n  Breeze (Breeze) properly waived his Miranda[1] rights.Â  We also affirm the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision not to charge the jury that an adverse inference could be suggested\r\n  from the Stateâ€™s failure to preserve the marijuana.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOfficer\r\n  Michael Collier (Collier) of the South Carolina Highway Patrol was observing a\r\n  driverâ€™s license checkpoint in Greenville County, South Carolina.Â  Collier\r\n  observed Breeze approach the checkpoint, abruptly stop, and jerk his car into a\r\n  driveway without using a turn signal.Â  Collier approached Breeze and requested\r\n  Breeze provide his driverâ€™s license.Â  In response to this request, Breeze â€œtook\r\n  off running.â€Â  \r\nCollier\r\n  chased Breeze, pushed him to the ground, and ordered him to remain down.Â \r\n  Breeze got up, and Collier responded by using pepper spray on him.Â  Breeze still\r\n  managed to get up and run.Â  Collier again chased and pushed Breeze to the\r\n  ground.Â  This series of events occurred a few more times until additional\r\n  officers arrived to assist Collier.Â  Breeze was once again sprayed with pepper\r\n  spray, subdued, and arrested. After Breeze was placed in handcuffs, officers\r\n  offset the effects of the pepper spray by decontaminating Breeze with an\r\n  aerosol water bottle.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  Breezeâ€™s arrest, Officer Johnny Black (Black) of the South Carolina Highway\r\n  Patrol informed Breeze of his Miranda rights.Â  Subsequently, Breeze was\r\n  searched based on a search incident to the arrest.Â  This search revealed a\r\n  substance, which was later tested to be marijuana.Â  The total weight of the\r\n  marijuana was 394.34 grams.Â  After being informed of his Miranda rights,\r\n  Breeze admitted to the officer the marijuana belonged to him.Â  Breeze stated he\r\n  ran because he â€œhad five bags of marijuana in his pockets . . . .â€Â  \r\nBreeze argued he did not freely and voluntarily waive his right to\r\n  remain silent.Â  The trial court found the State had proved Breeze â€œvoluntarily\r\n  and intelligently gave up his rights and that his statement was voluntary.â€Â  \r\nPrior to trial, the State informed Breeze the marijuana had been\r\n  destroyed.Â  Breeze asked the trial judge to charge the jury with the following:\r\n  â€œWhen a party loses or destroys evidence, an inference may be drawn that the\r\n  destroyed or lost evidence would have been adverse to that party.â€Â  The trial\r\n  judge denied this request. \r\nFollowing a jury trial, Breeze was convicted of possession of marijuana\r\n  with intent to distribute and resisting arrest.Â  Breeze was sentenced to seven\r\n  years for the possession with intent to distribute charge and one year for the\r\n  resisting arrest charge.Â  The sentences were to run consecutively.Â  This appeal\r\n  follows.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court reviews errors of law only.Â  State\r\n  v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 378, 652 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Thus,\r\n  we are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBreeze makes three arguments on appeal.Â  First, he argues the\r\n  trial court committed error when it refused to suppress his statement to the\r\n  police.Â  Second, he claims the trial court committed error by not allowing him\r\n  to argue that the destruction of the marijuana was a violation of his right to\r\n  a fair trial under the Due Process Clause.Â  Third, Breeze contends the trial\r\n  court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that an adverse inference could be\r\n  made from the Stateâ€™s failure to produce the marijuana.Â  We address each\r\n  argument in turn.Â  \r\nA. Breezeâ€™s\r\n  statement \r\nBreeze\r\n  initially contends the trial court improperly determined his statement was\r\n  voluntary.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  process for ascertaining whether a statement is voluntary is bifurcated because\r\n  the process involves determinations by both the trial judge and the jury.Â  Id. at 378-79, 652 S.E.2d at 448.Â  Initially, the trial judge must conduct an\r\n  evidentiary hearing[2] in the absence of the jury.Â  Id.Â  At this phase of the proceedings, the\r\n  State must show the statement was voluntarily made by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Id.Â  If the trial court determines the State has met its\r\n  burden, the statement is submitted to the jury where its voluntariness must be\r\n  established beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Id.\r\nOur role when reviewing a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning the\r\n  admissibility of a statement upon proof of its voluntariness is not to reevaluate\r\n  the facts based on our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  Rather, our standard of review is limited to determining whether the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Id.Â  Thus, on appeal the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s findings as to the voluntariness of a statement will not be\r\n  reversed unless they are so erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  With this is mind, we now turn our attention to the trial courtâ€™s determination\r\n  that Breezeâ€™s statement was voluntary.\r\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States\r\n  Constitution provides, â€œNo person shall be . . . compelled in any criminal\r\n  case to be a witness against himself . . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. V.[3]Â \r\n  The Fifth Amendmentâ€™s right against self-incrimination was made applicable to\r\n  the individual states through the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  Malloy v. Hogan,\r\n  378 U.S. 1, 6 (1964) (â€œWe hold today that the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s exception from\r\n  compulsory self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n  against abridgment by the States.â€).Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s protection against self-incrimination, the United\r\n  States Supreme Court announced, â€œ[T]he prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or\r\n  inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it\r\n  demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards . . . .â€Â  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444.Â  Before the accused is subjected to custodial\r\n  interrogation, he or she must be informed of the right to remain silent; any\r\n  statement made may be used as evidence against him or her; the right to the\r\n  presence of an attorney; and if he or she cannot afford an attorney one will be\r\n  appointed prior to questioning.Â  State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 303,\r\n  479 S.E.2d 838, 842 (Ct. App. 1996). Â Â Â Â \r\nHowever,\r\n  the Fifth Amendment does not act to provide a uniform prohibition against the\r\n  taking of any and all statements made by a suspect to law enforcement\r\n  officials.Â  Miller, 375 S.C. at 379-80, 652 S.E.2d at 449.Â  Volunteered\r\n  exculpatory or inculpatory statements arising from custodial interrogation are\r\n  not barred by the Fifth Amendment.Â  Id.Â  The test of voluntariness is\r\n  whether a suspectâ€™s will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the\r\n  given statement.Â  Id. at 384, 652 S.E.2d at 451.Â  In making this\r\n  determination, the trial court must examine the totality of the circumstances\r\n  surrounding the statement.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Breeze maintains his statement was not voluntary because his statement\r\n  occurred shortly after a physical altercation caused by his resisting arrest.Â  At\r\n  the Jackson v. Denno hearing, the trial court heard testimony from\r\n  Officer Black that\r\n  Breeze acknowledged his understanding of his rights by an â€œaffirmative nod of\r\n  the head and grunted, uh-huh.â€Â  Black further testified Breeze was informed he\r\n  had the option to answer any or all the questions or answer none of the\r\n  questions.Â  When asked whether he wished to cooperate, Breeze once again nodded\r\n  his head up and down and grunted â€œuh-huh.â€Â  \r\nBlack stated Breeze admitted the marijuana belonged to him.Â \r\n  According to Black, Breeze stated he ran because he â€œhad five bags of marijuana\r\n  in his pockets.â€Â  Black added Breeze was not threatened in any way to make a\r\n  statement.Â  Additionally, prior to being questioned, the officers offset the\r\n  effects of the pepper spray by decontaminating Breeze with an aerosol water\r\n  bottle.Â  \r\nConversely, Breeze did not contradict Blackâ€™s testimony with\r\n  respect to the issue of whether the statement was voluntary.Â  Breeze did not\r\n  state the pepper spray made him less capable of understanding and waving his Miranda rights.Â  Nor did Breeze assert he was coerced into making the statements.Â  Faced\r\n  with Blackâ€™s undisputed testimony the trial court concluded the State had showed\r\n  that Breeze voluntarily made the statement.Â  \r\nBased upon Blackâ€™s testimony, we cannot conclude the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling is unsupported by any evidence.Â  See Miller, 375 S.C. at 387-88,\r\n  652 S.E.2d at 453 (upholding the trial courtâ€™s determination of voluntariness because\r\n  the trial court had the opportunity to listen to the testimony, assess the\r\n  demeanor and credibility of witnesses and weigh evidence accordingly when\r\n  defendantâ€™s attorney testified defendant was coerced into making a statement by\r\n  a promise of a lenient sentence but where three law enforcement officials and\r\n  an assistant attorney general denied any promise of lenience).Â  We next turn\r\n  our attention to Breezeâ€™s second and third issues on appeal.\r\nB. Due Process\r\n  and jury charge\r\nPrior to trial, Breeze was informed the marijuana in question was\r\n  inadvertently destroyed.Â  Due to this destruction of evidence, Breeze contends the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision not to allow him to argue the evidence was destroyed as\r\n  a result of the Stateâ€™s mistake was a violation of his right to a fair trial\r\n  under the Due Process Clause.Â  Additionally, Breeze contends the trial court\r\n  erred in refusing to instruct the jury that an adverse inference could be drawn\r\n  from the Stateâ€™s failure to produce the marijuana.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe State does not have an absolute duty to safeguard potentially\r\n  useful evidence that might vindicate a defendant.Â  State v. Cheeseboro,\r\n  346 S.C. 526, 538-39, 552 S.E.2d 300, 307 (2001).Â  â€œTo establish a due process violation, a\r\n  defendant must demonstrate (1) that the State destroyed the evidence in bad\r\n  faith, or (2) that the evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the evidence was\r\n  destroyed and the defendant cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value by\r\n  other means.â€Â  Id.\r\nWith respect to the bad faith prong, we believe the following facts\r\n  demonstrate the Stateâ€™s actions were not in bad faith.Â  Originally, Breezeâ€™s trial was scheduled\r\n  for January 15, 2002.Â  Breeze failed to appear, and as a result, a bench\r\n  warrant for his arrest was issued.Â  As a product of this warrant, when law\r\n  enforcement officials checked the status of the case, it appeared as\r\n  â€œdisposed.â€Â  It is the policy of the highway patrol to destroy drugs when a\r\n  case is listed as disposed.Â  \r\nDuring Blackâ€™s direct examination, the following two questions\r\n  were proposed regarding the destruction of the marijuana: (1) â€œDoes the highway\r\n  patrol have a destruction of marijuana policy?â€ and (2) â€œ[W]as that destruction\r\n  policy followed?â€Â  Black answered in the affirmative to both questions.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Breeze asked, â€œTrooper Black, where is the marijuana?â€ Black\r\n  replied, â€œIt was destroyed pertinent to patrol policy.â€Â  This was the extent of\r\n  the testimony the jury heard regarding the destruction of the marijuana.Â  \r\nThe foregoing demonstrates the Stateâ€™s actions were not in bad faith\r\n  but rather an inadvertent mistake.Â  We also note Breezeâ€™s actions, by not\r\n  attending his first trial, led to his case being marked as disposed, which\r\n  resulted in the destruction of the marijuana.Â  Additionally, Breeze concedes the marijuana was not\r\n  destroyed in bad faith.Â  (Appellantâ€™s Br. 11) \r\nBreeze may establish his Due Process rights were violated if he\r\n  can demonstrate the destroyed evidence possessed an exculpatory value that was\r\n  apparent before the evidence was destroyed and that he cannot obtain this\r\n  evidence by other means.Â  Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. at 538-39, 552 S.E.2d at 307.Â  Here, the destroyed evidence Breeze\r\n  complains of was inculpatory rather than exculpatory. \r\nThe substance found on Breeze was field tested by an officer who\r\n  stated that in his opinion it was marijuana.Â  Prior to its destruction, an\r\n  expert qualified to analyze marijuana testified the substance obtained on\r\n  Breeze was marijuana.Â  Thus, the evidence destroyed was inculpatory rather than\r\n  exculpatory.Â  Moreover, Breeze also admits he failed to demonstrate the\r\n  marijuana had any exculpatory value.Â  (Appellantâ€™s Br. 11) Therefore, Breeze\r\n  has failed to establish that the destruction of the marijuana violated his Due\r\n  Process rights. \r\nAdditionally, contrary to Breezeâ€™s claims, the trial court did not\r\n  prohibit Breeze from arguing the evidence was destroyed as a result of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s mistake.Â  The State provided Breeze with a â€œDestruction of Evidenceâ€\r\n  form.Â  Breeze argued he should have been provided this form in response to his\r\n  discovery request.Â  Breeze asked the trial court to issue sanctions against the\r\n  State by not allowing the State to mention the bench warrant or grant a\r\n  mistrial.Â  \r\nThe State responded to this argument by explaining the form was\r\n  not disclosed during discovery because the State did not intend to introduce\r\n  the form at trial.Â  The State intended to limit testimony regarding the\r\n  destruction of the marijuana to the effect that the drugs were destroyed.Â \r\n  Breeze requested the trial court grant him permission to ask the testifying\r\n  officers about the procedures relating to the destruction of the evidence and\r\n  the State not be allowed to mention the bench warrant.Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled if Breeze decided to entertain this argument,\r\n  then the State would be permitted to go into the bench warrant because Breeze\r\n  had opened the door.Â  The trial court reasoned if Breeze inquired into the\r\n  procedures utilized in destroying evidence, the State would necessarily have to\r\n  examine why the marijuana was destroyed in Breezeâ€™s case.Â  Namely, the\r\n  marijuana was destroyed because the case was listed as disposed, which was the\r\n  result of the bench warrant.Â  \r\nThe trial court did not prohibit Breeze from commenting on the\r\n  Stateâ€™s mistake.Â  The trial court conditioned Breezeâ€™s inquiry into the\r\n  destroyed drugs on the fact the State had a right to introduce why the case was\r\n  listed as disposed.Â  Consequently, Breezeâ€™s contention that the trial court prevented\r\n  him from making an argument regarding the destroyed marijuana fails.Â  \r\nAlong this same line of reasoning, during the jury charge\r\n  conference, Breeze requested the jury be charged that an adverse inference\r\n  could be drawn against the State for failing to produce the marijuana.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied this request.Â  \r\nGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current\r\n  and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252,\r\n  261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302-03 (2002).Â  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  refusal to give a requested charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.Â  Id.\r\nIn support for his argument, Breeze cites Kershaw County Board of\r\n  Education v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 302 S.C. 390, 396 S.E.2d 369 (1990).[4]Â  However, the case cited is a civil\r\n  case and is, therefore, clearly distinguishable on that ground to this criminal\r\n  case.Â  See State v. Simmons, 267 S.C. 479, 482, 229 S.E.2d 597,\r\n  598 (1976) (â€œEven greater caution should be exercised by the courts in\r\n  permitting an adverse inference comment in criminal proceedings than in civil\r\n  proceedings.â€).Â  Even if we assume, without deciding, the trial courtâ€™s failure\r\n  to give the requested charge was erroneous, we conclude any such error did not\r\n  result in prejudice.Â  \r\nAccording to testimony, Breeze ran from the police because he â€œhad five bags of marijuana\r\n  in his pockets.â€Â  Two officers testified that the substance found on Breeze was\r\n  marijuana.Â  Additionally, Breeze\r\n  admitted the marijuana belonged to him.Â  Based upon these facts, we are\r\n  convinced any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Burkhart,\r\n  350 S.C. at 261, 565 at 302-03 (To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to\r\n  give a requested charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[2] This hearing is commonly referred to as a Jackson\r\n  v. Denno hearing based upon the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in\r\nthat case.Â  378 U.S. 368 (1964).Â  \r\n[3] The South Carolina Constitution has a similar\r\n  provision, which provides that no person shall â€œbe compelled in any criminal\r\ncase to be a witness against himself.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12.\r\n[4] Breeze requested the jury be charged as follows: â€œWhen a party loses or destroys evidence, an inference may\r\n  be drawn that the destroyed or lost evidence would have been adverse to that\r\n  party.â€Â  This language is remarkably similar to the language used in Kershaw\r\n    County Board of Education.Â  302 S.C. 390, 394, 396 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1990)\r\n  (â€œ[W]hen evidence is lost or destroyed by a party an inference may be drawn by\r\n  the jury that the evidence which was lost or destroyed by that party would have\r\nbeen adverse to that party.â€).\r\n[5] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
