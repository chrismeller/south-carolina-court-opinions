Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4202\r\nHeard December 4, 2006 â€“ Filed February 5, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor I. McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\nActing Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: Â Arthur Franklin Smith was convicted of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment.Â  The trial judge granted Smithâ€™s new trial motion on the ground he was denied a fair trial, because the testimony of the victim, John Doe,[1] was corrupted and his free will potentially overridden by the coaching of Doeâ€™s aunt, Cynthia, during his testimony.Â  The State appeals the grant of a new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSmith, Doe, and the rest of their immediate family moved to Bluffton from New York in the summer of 1998.Â  After the move to South Carolina, Smith and Doeâ€™s mother were divorced.Â  Doe was removed from his motherâ€™s care after he was discovered engaging in sexual behavior with the son of his motherâ€™s boyfriend.Â  Doe underwent counseling, entered a sexual offender addiction program and was placed in Cynthiaâ€™s custody. Â \r\nCynthia testified that she and Doeâ€™s teachers were alarmed by Doeâ€™s unusual behavior.Â  Doe would urinate on the walls of his bathroom and bedroom and wipe his feces on the walls at school.Â  Doe also exhibited violent behavior at home and became very difficult to control at school.Â  Concerned by Doeâ€™s behavior, Cynthia enrolled him in counseling.Â  Doe eventually revealed Smithâ€™s molestation of him during one of the counseling sessions.Â  \r\nDoe testified that Smith abused him when Doe was six or seven years old during visits to Smithâ€™s home.Â  Smith warned Doe that if he revealed the abuse to anyone, Smith would â€œkill [Doe] or break [Doeâ€™s] bones.â€Â  Doe described appalling sexual abuse and testified that such abuse occurred more than three times.Â  \r\nAfter Doe finished testifying, Smith, through his counsel, requested that the trial court remove Cynthia from the courtroom while Roe testified.Â  Counsel stated: Â â€œI didnâ€™t object after [Cynthia] testified to [her] be[ing] in the courtroom.Â  But it was apparent during [Doe]â€™s testimony that there were motions and mouth movement and things going back and forth between the witness and [Cynthia] and that was reported to me by individuals in the courtroom.â€Â  Cynthia then voluntarily left the courtroom.Â  \r\nDoeâ€™s brother, Richard Roe, who was fifteen at the time of trial, testified in an in camera Lyle[2] hearing that he suffered similar abuse from Smith when he was six or seven years old.Â  The abuse allegedly occurred several times when the family lived in New York, but stopped once the family moved to South Carolina.Â  \r\nAfter Roe finished testifying, Smith moved for a mistrial on the ground that Cynthia coached Doe during his testimony.Â  The trial court denied the motion on the grounds that Smithâ€™s counsel knew or should have known of the coaching and did not make a contemporaneous objection so that corrective action could be taken.Â  Smith renewed the motion for a mistrial at the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, and the trial court again denied the motion.Â  \r\nThe trial court sent the case to the jury, which found Smith guilty.Â  After sentencing, the issue of the extent of the auntâ€™s coaching of Doe during his testimony was revisited.Â  \r\nAfter hearing testimony from court officials who witnessed Cynthiaâ€™s alleged coaching of Doe, the trial court granted Smithâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  In doing so, the trial court concluded that: Â 1) Cynthia used body language and other non-verbal signals in an attempt to communicate with Doe; 2) this communication may have overridden Doeâ€™s free will; and 3) this behavior and the potential for corruption of Doeâ€™s testimony denied Smith his right to a fair trial.Â  The State appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppealability\r\nOur case law makes clear that in order for the State to appeal the grant of a motion for a new trial, the error of the trial judge in granting the motion must be predicated on an error of law.Â  See State v. DesChamps, 126 S.C. 416, 418, 120 S.E. 491, 492 (1923) (â€œ[W]here the grant of a new trial in a criminal cause is predicated wholly upon error of law, we think an appeal by the State will lie.â€); See also State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 184, 189, 610 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe State may appeal the grant of a new trial when it appears it is based â€˜wholly upon an error of law.â€™â€) (quoting State v. Dasher 278 S.C. 395, 400, 297 S.E.2d 414, 417 (1982)).Â  The State contends that there is no evidence in the record to support the trial judgeâ€™s finding that Cynthiaâ€™s coaching actually affected Doeâ€™s testimony resulting in prejudice to Smith.Â  They rely on Doeâ€™s testimony during re-direct examination that his responses were his own.[3]Â  At oral argument, the State asserted that this complete lack of evidence made the judgeâ€™s grant of a new trial rise to the level of an abuse of discretion and error of law.Â  However, the trial judge appears to have based his decision to grant a new trial on the factual findings that Cynthia made the impermissible gestures to Doe during his testimony and that there was a likelihood he was improperly influenced.Â  While there are lingering questions regarding its appealability, this issue presents at least a mixed question of law and fact, and we elect to address it on the merits. \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nExamining the issue on the merits, we must first consider our scope of review.Â  â€œ[T]he grant or refusal of a new trial is within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of that discretion.â€Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 656, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nThe State argues there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that Doeâ€™s testimony was influenced by Cynthiaâ€™s coaching. Â We disagree.Â  All parties acknowledge that Cynthia acted inappropriately making mouthing words to Doe and shaking her head during his testimony. Â The trial judge was in a better position than we are to determine whether Doe may have been influenced by the coaching.Â  He was present in the courtroom to view the visual relationship between the relevant participants during the testimony and was able to observe Doeâ€™s demeanor and hear his responses.Â  See State v. Squires, 248 S.C. 239, 246, 149 S.E.2d 601, 604 (1966) (deferring to â€œ[t]he trial judge, who was in position to know and observe all of the circumstancesâ€ and conclude an argument was not prejudicial); Collins&nbsp;v. Collins, 283 S.C. 526, 529, 324 S.E.2d 82, 84 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œ[T]he trial judge, who observes the witnesses and is in a better position to judge their demeanor and veracity, is given broad discretion.â€).Â  The trial judge also observed Cynthia and heard the testimony of the witnesses who saw her inappropriate gestures during Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  There was evidence in the record to support the judgeâ€™s decision, so that the granting of a new trial was not an abuse of discretion. \r\nAdditionally, we are not persuaded by the Stateâ€™s argument that Smith waived his right to request a mistrial when he failed to contemporaneously object to the coaching.Â  First, it is not clear from the record that the coaching was apparent to Smithâ€™s counsel during Doeâ€™s cross-examination.Â  The trial judge acknowledges in the record that he himself did not see the coaching when it first occurred.Â  It appears that Smith brought the misconduct to the courtâ€™s attention as soon as the extent of the coaching was revealed.Â  The trial judge did initially determine that Smith waived any objection.Â  However, the judge only had a portion of the relevant information before him and did not have the luxury of time, as do appellate courts, to weigh and ponder the question. Â As trial judges are often required to do, he had to make a ruling on the spot.Â  When that initial decision was made, he did not have the benefit of the testimony at the hearing from witnesses who were in a better position to see what had transpired between Doe and Cynthia.Â  Once privy to this additional information, the judge became convinced that the chance of prejudice to Smith was much greater than he initially thought.Â  Surely, under such circumstances, a judge has the latitude to change his mind about a prior ruling.Â  Just as a judge retains the power to change a ruling on a motion in limine based on developments at trial, a judge has the prerogative to change his mind with respect to a ruling when reflection and information convince him that his prior ruling was incorrect.Â  See State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 520, 369 S.E.2d 842, 842 (1988) (stating a ruling on a motion in limine is subject to change based on events at trial).Â  In the instant case, the judge heard additional evidence, considered the matter, and concluded that his prior ruling regarding waiver was not proper under these circumstances. Â \r\nIt is notable that the trial judge did not direct a verdict in Smithâ€™s favor or exonerate him in any way.Â  This decision means that Smith will be tried again, and Doeâ€™s testimony in that case will be â€œuncoachedâ€ and free of any impermissible influence. \r\nFor all the foregoing reasons the decision of the trial court is Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):Â  I would reverse the order granting Smith a new trial and for that reason I respectfully dissent.\r\nJohn Doe, Smithâ€™s son, testified that Smith abused him when Doe was six or seven years old during visits to Smithâ€™s home.Â  During Doeâ€™s testimony, several people in the courtroom observed Doeâ€™s aunt, Cynthia, mouthing words and shaking her head up and down and side to side, seemingly in response to the questions Doe was asked.\r\nAfter Doe finished testifying, Smith made a motion for the trial court to remove Cynthia from the courtroom before Richard Roe, Doeâ€™s brother, testified.Â  Smith alleged, based on information from other individuals in the courtroom,  inappropriate â€œmotions and mouth movement and things going back and forthâ€ between Cynthia and Doe occurred during Doeâ€™s testimony.\r\nCynthia left the courtroom voluntarily.Â  Smith did not use this opportunity to advance any further arguments on the coaching issue or move for a mistrial.Â  Smith received the relief he sought in the motion; the removal of Cynthia from the courtroom.[4]Â  As a result, Smithâ€™s motion to remove Cynthia from the courtroom did not preserve the coaching issue for further review.\r\nRoe, who was fifteen at the time of trial, testified in an in camera Lyle[5] hearing that he suffered similar abuse from Smith.Â  Following Roeâ€™s testimony, Smith moved for a mistrial on the ground that Cynthia coached Doe during Doeâ€™s testimony.[6]Â  One of Smithâ€™s attorneys explained to the trial court:\r\n\r\nI believe I saw [Doe] looking in the direction of his aunt to seek an answer.Â  It was not until I finished with his questioning that I sat down that I was informed by co[-]counsel and other members of the court, all in the courtroom, that that, in fact, was the magnitude of what was taking place.Â  \r\n\r\nSmith waited until after Roe finished testifying before requesting a mistrial.\r\nThe trial court ruled that Smith waived the issue because his attorneys knew of Cynthiaâ€™s conduct during Doeâ€™s testimony but did not request a mistrial or immediately raise the issue and allow the court the chance to take appropriate action.[7]Â  Smith renewed his motion for a mistrial at the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case and again at the close of evidence.Â  The trial court denied the motions.\r\nAfter his conviction and sentencing, Smith moved for a new trial.Â  Smith presented testimony from court officials who witnessed Cynthiaâ€™s alleged coaching of Doe.Â  One of the witnesses, Stephanie Smart, testified that she observed Cynthia attempting to coach Doe during his testimony and brought it to the attention of one of Smithâ€™s attorneys during Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  As pointed out earlier, Smith did not request a mistrial until after Roeâ€™s testimony, even despite being informed of Cynthiaâ€™s misconduct during Doeâ€™s testimony.\r\nThe trial court granted Smithâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  In doing so, the trial court made the following findings of fact: 1) Cynthia used body language and other non-verbal signals in an attempt to communicate with Doe; 2) this communication may have overridden Doeâ€™s free will; and 3) this behavior and the potential for corruption of Doeâ€™s testimony denied Smith his right to a fair trial.\r\nHaving ruled that Smith waived the coaching issue during trial and absent a contemporaneous objection by Smithâ€™s counsel, I believe the trial court erred by granting Smithâ€™s motion for a new trial on the same issue.[8]Â  I would reverse the order granting Smith a new trial and reinstate his sentence.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We refer to the victim as John Doe and his older brother as Richard Roe to protect the identities of the minors involved.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; State v.

Burch, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4203\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed February 5, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Carl Kelly appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision not to grant a mistrial and not to issue an Allen[1] charge after a juror retracted her guilty verdicts during jury polling.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCarl Kelly stood trial before a jury on charges of assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, first-degree burglary, and kidnapping.Â  At the close of trial, the jury informed the judge they had reached a unanimous verdict of guilty on each charge. Â After the jury read the verdict, the defense requested the jury be polled. \r\nUpon polling, eleven of the jurors reported that their verdicts were guilty.Â  One juror, however, reported that she was â€œnot comfortableâ€ with the verdict. Â The trial judge then said:\r\n\r\nThe [c]ourt fully understands that a juror certainly has been put in a position where youâ€™re not comfortable with what you do.Â  Iâ€™m not comfortable many times in my job up here.Â  I understand that.Â  But I needâ€”if you donâ€™t mind, if you would, I need you to respond to the question: Is this still your verdict? \r\n\r\nThe juror then responded â€œI really donâ€™t know.Â  I canâ€™t . . . (shaking her head side to side) no.â€ \r\nThe trial judge then sent the jury back to the jury room to continue deliberations â€œto see if [they could not] reach a verdict.â€ Â Kellyâ€™s defense attorneys then made an objection to the courtâ€™s statement, which they called a de facto Allen charge. Â They also made a motion for a mistrial and requested a full Allen charge.Â  Nearly two hours later, the jury returned with a guilty verdict on each charge. Â This verdict survived a jury polling. \r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nKelly argues the court erred by failing to declare a mistrial or alternatively by failing to issue a full Allen charge after the juror retracted her guilty verdicts during jury polling.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe granting or refusing of a motion for a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 627-28 (2000).Â  A mistrial should be declared only when absolutely necessary.Â  Id. at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 628.Â  In order to receive a mistrial, the defendant must show error and resulting prejudice.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe trial judge must be satisfied that the verdict is unanimous and must conduct a jury poll at the request of either party.Â  State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 309, 278 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1981).Â  â€œPolling is a practice whereby the court determines from the jurors individually whether they assented [to] and still assent to the verdict.â€Â  Id. at 308, 278 S.E.2d at 338. Â â€œIf it is made known to the court when it is time to render the verdict that any juror does not assent to it, the verdict cannot be received and the jury should retire to their room until they have agreed.â€Â  State v. Singleton, 319 S.C. 312, 316, 460 S.E.2d 573, 576 (1995).Â  A judge has a duty to urge the jury to reach a verdict, but he may not coerce them.Â  Id. at 316, 460 S.E2d at 575.Â  \r\nIn criminal cases, this Court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 15, 610 S.E.2d 823, 827 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œAn appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its discretion.â€Â  State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œThe requesting party must have been prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s failure to give the instruction in order to warrant reversal on appeal.â€Â  Id. at 195-96, 624 S.E.2d at 445.Â Â  \r\nIn this case, when the juror stated she was not comfortable and ultimately not in agreement with the verdicts, the trial judge sent the jury back into the deliberation room to see if they could arrive at a unanimous verdict.Â  It was within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion to either grant a mistrial or send the jury back for deliberations.Â  The juror did not indicate that she was coerced into voting for a guilty verdict, nor did she indicate that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.Â  Therefore, declaring a mistrial was not an absolute necessity, and no prejudice resulted from sending the jury back for more deliberations.Â  \r\nHere, the judge followed the same procedure affirmed by the Supreme Court in State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 260 S.E.2d 705 (1979).Â  In Roper, one juror indicated she had her doubts about the verdict.Â  After questioning that juror, the trial judge sent the jury back in for more deliberations with the instruction that any verdict must be unanimous.Â  The Supreme Court ruled that the judgeâ€™s instructions were courteous and expeditious and were not coercive.Â  \r\nLikewise, the questions asked in State v. Singleton, 319 S.C. 312, 315-16, 460 S.E.2d 573, 575-76 (1995) were found to be appropriate â€œto ensure that the juror did not misunderstand the verdict and to confirm that the verdict was unanimous.â€Â  In Singleton, when asked if the guilty verdict was still his verdict, the juror answered â€œno.â€Â  The judge then said: â€œGo back in your jury room to continue your deliberations.Â  Iâ€™m told this was a unanimous verdict. Is this your verdict?â€Â  The juror then answered: â€œIt is now.â€Â  Singleton, at 315, 460 S.E.2d at 575.Â  \r\nA comparison of the instructions in the case at bar to the proper instructions in Roper and Singleton shows that the instructions given in this case were noncoercive and did not prejudice Kellyâ€™s case.Â  \r\nKelly also argues the trial court erred in failing to issue a full Allen charge after the juror retracted her guilty verdict.Â  An Allen charge, also known as a â€œDynamiteâ€ or â€œHammerâ€ charge, is to be used when the jury has expressed a deadlock and cannot come to a unanimous conclusion.Â  See Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).Â  There is no case law requiring or suggesting that an Allen charge be given when a juror retracts her verdict during polling and this Court will not impose such a requirement.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]Â \r\nHEARN C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4204","title":"Roland v.

Â A firewall separates each individual condominium.\r\nThe first buildings erected in the development were buildings 19, 20, and 21, all of which were built during roughly the same time period, beginning in the Spring of 1999.Â  Eleven of the twelve units in these buildings were sold to the Respondents in late 1999. The twelfth unit never sold.\r\nDuring the construction of these first three buildings, it is undisputed that the firewalls were erected prior to the roofs.Â  Gwyn Hardister, the president of Heritage Litchfield, testified the firewalls were rained on while they were unprotected by a roof.Â  Tommy Hooks, the assistant project manager, also testified that before the roof was built, â€œmoisture had accumulated in those walls and sometime thereafter we saw the signs of mold . . . .Â  Mold was evident in those firewalls.â€Â  \r\nIn March of 2000, a plumbing leak in building 19 led to the discovery of mold on the common firewall between the units. Appellants hired a mold remediation and investigation company, whose investigator determined that the mold had toxic characteristics and was present in the firewalls of all three buildings.Â  The investigator informed Hardister about the mold problem, who in turn advised Respondents not to live in their condominiums.Â  \r\nRespondents filed causes of action against Appellants, alleging breach of the implied warranty of habitability, breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service, breach of express warranty, and negligence.Â  Appellants answered, and both sides filed motions for partial summary judgment. Respondents sought summary judgment as to liability, and Appellants sought summary judgment as to Respondentsâ€™ standing to allege any injury to the common elements of the buildings.Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion and denied Appellantsâ€™ motion. This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, [the appellate court] applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  The appellate court therefore reviews all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  Once the moving party meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial and cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 220, 616 S.E.2d 722, 730 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue summary judgment should have been denied because there are material facts in dispute with regard to causation and the nature and extent of the mold problem.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring the summary judgment hearing, Respondents presented numerous depositions wherein agents of the Appellants admitted the mold was caused by the firewallsâ€™ exposure during rainy weather.Â  Appellants argue there is a question of fact regarding how much mold was caused by the firewalls exposure during construction and how much mold was caused by other factors, such as the Respondentsâ€™ failure to properly maintain their air conditioning systems.Â  However, no evidence was presented to the trial court suggesting Respondents contributed to their mold problem, nor was there any evidence suggesting that anything other than the saturation of the firewalls during construction caused the mold in all three buildings.Â  Because mere allegations of comparative negligence are not sufficient to raise an issue of material fact, we find summary judgment was proper with regard to causation.Â  See Miller, 365 S.C. at 220, 616 S.E.2d at 730 (explaining that once the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial and cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings).\r\nIn addition to their argument regarding causation, Appellants also contend the extent of the mold problem is in dispute.Â  Specifically, they argue there is a question of fact regarding the habitability of the condominiums because two of the unit owners rented their units and there was no evidence in the record that the renters complained of the unitsâ€™ conditions.Â  Additionally, Appellants point out there was testimony that the mold was not dangerous â€œas long as you donâ€™t disturb it, meaning open walls so that the mold is airborne.â€Â  After a careful review of the record, we find no issue of material fact with regard to the habitability of the units.\r\nWhile two of the Respondents did indeed rent their units, they ceased renting them once they learned of the mold problem.Â  Furthermore, the â€œhabitabilityâ€ of a dwelling does not turn on whether a person actually lives there; rather habitability is defined as the â€œ[t]he condition of a building in which inhabitants can live free of serious defects that might harm health and safety . . . .â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004).Â  Here, the only evidence in the record showed Respondentsâ€™ units were unsafe due to the toxic mold found between the walls.Â  Gwyn Hardister, the president of Heritage Communities, testified that he contacted Phoenix EnviroCorp to identify whether a mold problem existed in the units.Â  From that investigation, Hardister learned there were high levels of toxic mold in the air samples tested.Â  Hardister told the owners about the mold and advised them not to live in their units. Â Although Appellants attempt to isolate one line of Hardisterâ€™s testimony in which he said â€œas long as you donâ€™t disturb [the mold], meaning open walls so that the mold is airborne, itâ€™s not dangerousâ€ to support their contention there is an issue of material fact, we find this statement, when read in context, does not preclude summary judgment.Â  Later in Hardisterâ€™s testimony, he explained the mold could be â€œdisturbedâ€ simply by occupying the units because fluctuations in the humidity, temperature, and air pressure of the units could produce higher levels of the mold.Â  Because neither Hardisterâ€™s testimony nor the rental of the units raise an issue of material fact regarding the unitsâ€™ habitability, summary judgment was appropriate.\r\nNext, Appellants argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to liability because the area impacted by mold is a common area belonging to the homeownersâ€™ association, not Respondents.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Master Deed of the Avian Forest Development specifically states:\r\n\r\n[E]ach UNIT shall be conveyed and treated as an individual property capable of independent use and fee simple ownership, and the Owner or Owners of each UNIT shall own, as an appurtenance to the ownership of each said UNIT, an undivided interest in the COMMON ELEMENTS . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Furthermore, neither the Master Deed nor the By-Laws of the Avian Forest Homeownersâ€™ Association grants the homeownersâ€™ association an ownership interest in the common elements.Â  We therefore find no question of material fact exists regarding ownership of the common elements which would preclude summary judgment as to liability.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the trial court granting partial summary judgment with regard to liability is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Heritage Litchfield, Inc. was the main developer of Avian Forest, and Build Star Corporation was the general contractor for the buildings.Â  Both Heritage Litchfield and Build Star are wholly owned by Heritage Communities, Inc.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4205","title":"Altman v.

Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  With respect to custody determinations, however, this court and our supreme court have consistently shown deference to family court judges in electing between fit parents.Â  In the case before us, although both parents were burdened with â€œshortcomings,â€ there is no challenge to the finding of fitness.Â  For obvious and compelling reasons, as an appellate court, we are reticent to substitute our judgment on the custody determination between fit parents for that of the family court judge.\r\nOur deference to the family courtâ€™s findings is especially warranted here, for the ultimate determination rests primarily on the trial judgeâ€™s assessment of witness demeanor and credibility.Â  In gauging between fit parents as to who would better serve the best interests and welfare of the child in a custodial setting, the family court judge is in a superior position to appellate judges who are left only to review the cold record.Â  For this reason, custody determinations largely rest in the sound discretion of the family court judge.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (â€œ[T]he appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the [family] court.â€); Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 89, 606 S.E.2d 785, 787 (Ct. App. 2004) (same); Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330-31, 536 S.E.2d 427, 230 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œCustody decisions are matters left largely to the discretion of the [family] court.â€); Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 189, 531 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting appellate courts should\r\nbe reluctant to supplant the trial courtâ€™s evaluation of witness credibility regarding child custody).Â  Indeed, our supreme court has held â€œ[w]hen both parties are fit and proper to have child custody, the trial judge must make the election.â€Â  Jones v. Ard, 265 S.C. 423, 426, 219 S.E.2d 358, 359-60 (1975).\r\nThis deferential scope of review is consistent with the general approach to accord respect to a family court judgeâ€™s factual findings, as reflected in the following often cited principle: â€œNor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 215, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981)).Â  â€œ[W]here there is disputed evidence, the appellate court may adhere to the findings of the family court.â€Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\n II.Â Â Â \r\nMother and Father met in the spring of 1998 and began living together soon thereafter.Â  The couple never married.Â  Mother and Father had a rocky relationship almost from the beginning.Â  Mother gave birth to the partiesâ€™ son on May 27, 1999.Â  The birth of their child did little to solidify the tumultuous relationship between the couple.Â  Regrettably, in the partiesâ€™ acrimonious relationship, each parent used the child as leverage against the other.Â  The couple experienced many separations and attempts at reconciliation.Â  \r\nFather regularly used marijuana.Â  He even publicly advocated marijuana use, and he ran a business that catered to the marijuana-smoking crowd under the guise of a â€œmusic store.â€Â  The business distributed drug related paraphernalia, such as pipes commonly used to smoke marijuana.Â  Mother regularly used marijuana and alcohol, even when pregnant with the partiesâ€™ child.Â  Mother also took prescribed antidepressants and tranquilizers, including Paxil, Zoloft, Tranxene, and Valium. \r\nIn October 2002, Mother and Father permanently separated.Â  At that time Mother took the child and moved in with her parents.Â  In an effort to see the child, Father called and wrote Mother â€œon a regular basis,â€ but Mother avoided him.Â  Rather than permit Father to see his son, Mother â€œdirected [Father] to speak to my attorney.â€Â  Father was denied any contact with his son until he filed this action in January 2003.\r\nIn February 2003, the family court issued a temporary order granting temporary custody of the child to the maternal and paternal grandparents â€œwith visitation extended to the mother and father at times agreeable to the respective grandparents.â€Â  The temporary order further noted â€œgreat concernsâ€ with both parents.\r\nIII.\r\nJudge Marion D. Myers presided over the final hearing.Â  Following a lengthy trial (August 30, 2004 through September 8, 2004), the learned and experienced family court judge found both parents fit and awarded custody to Father.Â  There is no challenge to the finding of fitness.Â  \r\nContested custody cases often bring out the worst in parents.Â  This case was no exception, as each parent relished the opportunity to disparage the other.Â  Each parent gave the other plenty of ammunition, which Judge Myers charitably described as their â€œshortcomings.â€Â  As noted, the parents used the child as a pawn in their conflicts.Â  They also used illegal drugs.Â  The evidence additionally revealed Motherâ€™s unmistakable tendency to be self-absorbed and self-pitying.Â  The picture of both parties improved during the pendency of the litigation.Â  Judge Myersâ€™ finding of fitness reflects his view that the improvement is genuine, as opposed to judicially motivated posturing.\r\nAfter carefully weighing the evidence, Judge Myers found that despite the parentsâ€™ â€œshortcomings,â€ neither parent â€œcan now be deemed to be an unfit parent and neither partyâ€™s love for this child is in doubt.â€Â  (emphasis in original).Â  Judge Myers considered the â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ and concluded: (1) â€œthe child in the long run would benefit more from being in fatherâ€™s custody than motherâ€™sâ€; (2) â€œthe father would provide the child with the best and probably the only opportunity to have a good relationship with both of the childâ€™s parents and their familiesâ€; and (3) â€œfrom my own observation of the demeanor and attitude of the parents that the father appears to have a stronger focus on the daily welfare and care of the child than does the mother.â€Â  We find ample support in the record for these findings.\r\nIV.\r\nMother contends the family court erred in failing to impose on Father the burden of demonstrating a â€œchange of circumstancesâ€ and in admitting Dr. Elizabeth Baker Gibbsâ€™ opinion testimony.Â  Mother additionally challenges the findings favoring the custody award to Father, essentially complaining about the family courtâ€™s failure to give weight to Motherâ€™s take on the evidence.\r\nA.\r\nMother contends this is a â€œchange of circumstancesâ€ case in light of section 20-7-953(B) of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  Consequently, Mother claims the family court erred by evaluating the evidence based on the â€œtotality of the circumstances.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nWe first note that this issue is not preserved.Â  Even assuming Mother asserted this argument to the family court, Judge Myers did not address the issue in the final order, and no motion for reconsideration was filed.[2]Â  â€œWhere a party raises an issue, but the issue is never ruled on by the trial court, and the party fails to file a motion to alter or amend, the issue is not preserved.â€Â  Jean Hoefer Toal, Shahin Vafai &amp; Robert A. Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina 58 (2d ed. 2002) (citing S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E. Underwriters Risk Retention Group, 347 S.C. 333, 554 S.E.2d 870 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  We address the issue, however, because â€œprocedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minors.â€Â  Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000).Â  \r\nMotherâ€™s specific contention is that a statute concerning paternity, section 20-7-953(B), imposes on Father the burden of showing a substantial change of circumstances to gain custody.Â  Section 20-7-953(B) provides: \r\n\r\nUnless the court orders otherwise, the custody of an illegitimate child is solely in the natural mother unless the mother has relinquished her rights to the child. If paternity has been acknowledged or adjudicated, the father may petition the court for rights of visitation or custody in a proceeding before the court apart from an action to establish paternity.\r\n\r\nThe issue as framed by Mother presents the following question: when parents are not married, does the law mandate a change of circumstances burden on every father who seeks custody?Â  The answer is â€œno.â€Â  We find nothing in the language of the statute (which is found in the subarticle titled â€œDetermination of Paternityâ€) suggesting the result advocated by Mother.Â  See Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 260, 626 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2005) (â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€).Â Â  In giving a father the right to petition the family court for custody, the statute makes no mention of a change of circumstances burden.Â  This plain reading of the statute is in accord with the general legal principle that the imposition of a change of circumstances burden applies when a parent seeks to alter a prior custody order.Â  See Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 381, 602 S.E.2d 32, 35 (2004) (holding that when a previous order addressing the issue of custody exists, a showing of changed circumstances is required for a court to grant a change in custody). Â Â Â \r\nAnother legal principle in line with our holding today is the established rule in South Carolina that â€œin custody matters, the father and mother are in parity as to entitlement to the custody of a child.â€Â  Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 91, 606 S.E.2d 785, 788 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œ[T]here is no preference given to the father or mother in regard to the custody of the child[;] [t]he parents stand in perfect equipoise as the custody analysis begins.â€Â  Id.Â  We additionally note that Mother and Father were living together when their child was born, and there was never any question as to paternity.Â  The family court in this case was presented with an initial custody determination.Â  In an initial custody determination, the parents are on equal footing.\r\nWe hold the family court properly determined custody based on the â€œtotality of the circumstances.â€Â  â€œThe paramount and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interests of the children.â€Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 191, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (â€œThe welfare and best interests of the child are paramount in custody disputes.â€).Â  In making initial custody decisions â€œthe totality of the circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€Â  Wheeler v. Gill, 307 S.C. 94, 99, 413 S.E.2d 860, 865 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting\r\nDavenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975)). \r\nB.\r\nMother next asserts the family court erred in admitting much of Dr. Elizabeth Baker Gibbsâ€™ opinion testimony.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAt trial, evidence was presented about an investigation by the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) concerning alleged abuse of the child.Â  On May 3, 2004, after the child spent a weekend with Father, the maternal grandmother, Johanna Garner, noticed bruising on the child and took him to the doctor.Â  Dr. Meghan Geils examined the child and filed a report with DSS, although she acknowledged she lacked extensive training in child abuse matters and also candidly admitted she was not â€œable to determine the cause of the bruises.â€Â  Garner emphasized that she was â€œconcernedâ€ about the child, even though Dr. Geils reported the child â€œwasnâ€™t upsetâ€ and seemed like â€œ[j]ust a normal little boy.â€Â  \r\nThis scenario repeated itself on May 17 when Garner brought the child to Dr. Geilsâ€™ office.Â  Garner expressed the â€œsame concerns.â€Â  Dr. Geils observed a bruise but further noted the child was â€œhappyâ€ and â€œfine.â€Â  When asked what she did â€œas a result of that visit,â€ Dr. Geils responded, â€œI didnâ€™t do anything. The grandmother . . . had already taken pictures and had already re-notified DSS that there was another abuse.â€Â  \r\nDSS investigated the abuse allegations against Father and determined the allegations were â€œunfounded.â€Â  \r\nConfronted with the abuse allegations (but prior to the â€œunfoundedâ€ determination by DSS), Father took the child to the Carolina Medical Assessment Center.Â  Dr. Elizabeth Baker Gibbs is the Medical Director of the Carolina Medical Assessment Center.Â  The Center provides numerous child related services, including forensic medical services for victims of child abuse.Â  Dr. Gibbs examined the child and interviewed the parents and Garner.\r\nFather presented Dr. Gibbs as an expert witness â€œon whether the child was a victim of abuse and neglect.â€Â  The family court, without objection, qualified Dr. Gibbs as an expert.Â  Dr. Gibbs testified the bruises and abrasions on the child were â€œnon-specific.â€Â  Dr. Gibbs specifically stated the childâ€™s â€œlesions were non-specific which would be lesions that we would commonly find on him[,] especially an active child his age.â€[3]Â  The child informed Dr. Gibbs that he had fallen off a chair at Garnerâ€™s house.Â  It was Dr. Gibbsâ€™ opinion that the child had not been abused.\r\nAs part of her evaluation, Dr. Gibbs spoke with Father, Mother, and Garner.Â  According to Dr. Gibbs:\r\n\r\nFrom the first time I talked with [Father], his focus was really almost entirely based around [the child]. . . . Â When I talked to [Mother], her focus was around the effect all of this was having on her; not the effect that this was having on [the child] . . . .Â  We tried several different techniques and we were unable to get [Mother] to shift her focus to a child-focus perspective. \r\n\r\nMother did not object to the foregoing testimony and, consequently, she may not now assign error to its admission and consideration by the family court.Â  Failure to object when evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object, and the issue may not then be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  Crawford v. Crawford, 321 S.C. 511, 514, 469 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Mother only objected when Dr. Gibbs was asked how long it would take for Mother to learn to be more child-focused.Â  The family court found the testimony within Dr. Gibbsâ€™ expertise and overruled Motherâ€™s objection.Â  Thereafter, Dr. Gibbs opined:\r\n\r\nEither way, my concern is that the conflict is going to continue which can be very damaging to children.Â  I would be concerned that if [Mother] has the primary care and control, that the conflict will continue at the current level or maybe even more so.Â  If [Father] had primary care and control, I do see him more motivated in decreasing the conflict.\r\n\r\nWe find no merit to Motherâ€™s challenge to Dr. Gibbsâ€™ testimony.Â  Rule 702, SCRE, provides: â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  Generally, â€œ[w]hether a witness has qualified as an expert, and whether his opinion is admissible on a fact in issue, are matters resting largely in the discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  Prince v. Assâ€™n Petroleum Carriers, 262 S.C. 358, 365, 204 S.E.2d 575, 579 (1974).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s ruling to exclude or admit expert testimony will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.â€Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 406, 570 S.E.2d 176, 183 (2002).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  \r\nThe record indicates Dr. Gibbs has impressive credentials in dealing with dysfunctional families and possesses specialized knowledge in forensic medicine in evaluating allegations of child abuse.Â  Dr. Gibbsâ€™ knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education clearly satisfy the requirements of Rule 702.Â  We conclude the family court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Dr. Gibbsâ€™ so-called â€œexpandedâ€ testimony.Â  It is our judgment that Motherâ€™s tardy objection to Dr. Gibbsâ€™ testimony goes more to the weight of the evidence than its admissibility.\r\nFurthermore, we would be hard-pressed to characterize any error in admitting Dr. Gibbsâ€™s â€œexpandedâ€ testimony as amounting to reversible error.Â  To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both error and resulting prejudice.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997).Â  As pointed out by Mother, the family court relied in part on Dr. Gibbsâ€™ testimony in awarding custody to Father.Â  Yet the record contains other evidence of Motherâ€™s focus on herself.Â  \r\nFor example, Mother kept a journal (admitted without objection) in 2002 as a result of a self-help book, Self Matters, written by Dr. Phil McGraw.Â  Examples of Motherâ€™s journal entries include: â€œI over-exaggerate things to create drama and appear to be the victim in most situationsâ€; â€œI lack basic coping skills and have used alcohol and/or drugs as a way to anesthetizeâ€; â€œI can be unpleasant and resentful when I donâ€™t get my wayâ€; and â€œIâ€™m the victim,â€ a statement Mother underlined three times.Â  Based on the journal entries, Mother admitted on cross-examination that she has â€œgeneral feelings of being taken advantage of, lied to, gossiped about, [and] used and abused.â€ \r\nWe cite this example not to disparage Mother in any way.Â  As noted by Judge Myers, Mother has made laudable strides during the pendency of this custody suit.Â  Judge Myers found that Mother is now a fit parent.Â  We cite this evidence only to illustrate that Dr. Gibbsâ€™ testimony is certainly not the only evidence tending to establish that Mother tends to be self-absorbed and self-pitying. Â We view Dr. Gibbsâ€™ opinion about Motherâ€™s focus on self as cumulative to other evidence in the record.\r\n C.\r\nWe turn finally to Motherâ€™s broad challenge that the best interests of the child dictate she be awarded custody.Â  In essence, Mother assigns error to the adverse findings against her and the more positive findings in favor of Father.Â  Mother, of course, views the evidence in a different light than determined by the family court.\r\nWe categorically reject the suggestion that the record does not support the finding that Mother has difficulty putting the childâ€™s needs first.Â  When the parents separated for the last time, Mother prevented Father from visiting the child for several months.Â  There was no valid reason to prevent Father from having any contact with his son.Â  Under these circumstances, Motherâ€™s mandate that Father contact her attorney cannot reasonably be construed as a viable response to accommodate visitation.Â  Motherâ€™s journal entries and her own testimony further buttress the family courtâ€™s finding.[4]\r\nWe additionally find support in the record for the finding that the â€œmotherâ€™s and her familyâ€™s repeated unfounded accusations and unfounded charges against the father have contributed greatly to their bad relationship and inability to communicate with each other.â€Â  Their bogus allegations that Father committed child abuse is one example.Â  Another example is Motherâ€™s complaint to law enforcement, which resulted in a charge against Father for assault with intent to kill.Â  This unfounded charge arose from an incident on August 22, 2003, when Mother claimed Father tried to kill her with his car.[5]Â  The charge was dismissed at a preliminary hearing.Â  The Solicitor apparently refused to pursue a direct indictment against Father.Â  Father had the record of his arrest expunged.Â  Our review of the evidence is in line with the family courtâ€™s finding.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nJudge Myers found Father â€œappears to have a stronger focus on the daily welfare and care of this child than does the mother.â€Â  This finding is tied to Judge Myersâ€™ additional finding that Father â€œis committed to supporting the childâ€™s relationship with his mother notwithstanding his questionable conduct and judgment at times in other areas.â€Â  Judge Myers further noted that Father has a teenage daughter with whom he has â€œa very close [and] loving relationship.â€Â  Given the posture of the case, Mother understandably seeks to cast the evidence in a much more negative light toward Father.Â  We readily acknowledge that Fatherâ€™s side of the ledger has â€œshortcomings,â€ a fact which did not escape Judge Myers.Â  We decline, however, to recast the evidence so that the scales tip in favor of Mother. \r\nJudge Myers was presented with a difficult decision between fit parents.Â  In our firm judgment, the record supports the view that the childâ€™s best interest is served by an award of custody to Father.Â  We certainly cannot say that the award of custody to the Father amounts to an abuse of discretion.\r\nThere is no single factor that controls in a custody dispute, for the analysis is necessarily a fact-driven inquiry covering the totality of the circumstances.Â  Woodall, 322 S.C. at 11, 471 S.E.2d at 157 (holding that â€œwhen determining to whom custody shall be awarded . . . all of the circumstances of the particular case, and all relevant factors must be taken into considerationâ€).Â  Judge Myers thoughtfully and thoroughly considered the totality of the circumstances.\r\n V. \r\nContested custody cases present difficult decisions for family court judges.Â  In situations where there is a striking difference in the fitness of one parent over another, the issue of custody is often resolved short of litigation.Â  Litigation seems to follow those cases where an arguably close question is presented.Â  This is such a case.Â  Motherâ€™s excellent counsel have forcefully advanced the evidence in a light most favorable to her.Â  Judge Myers was keenly aware of the partiesâ€™ respective positions and â€œshortcomings,â€ and the record manifests his recognition of the importance of the decision before him.Â  While the law reflects deference to a family court judge in deciding between fit parents, we, too, have an important responsibility to ensure that a custody award does not amount to an abuse of discretion.Â  We have canvassed the record and carefully considered the arguments presented on appeal.Â  We find ample support for Judge Myersâ€™ findings and his decision to award custody to Father.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Appellate counsel did not represent Mother at trial.\r\n[2]&nbsp; In an apparent attempt to circumvent our issue preservation rules, Mother now argues the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Father did not expressly invoke section 20-7-953(B) as the basis for his custody claim.Â  See, e.g., Town of Hilton Head Island v. Godwin, 370 S.C. 221, __, 634 S.E.2d 59, 60-61 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œThe lack\r\nof subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€).Â  We disagree.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear cases in the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994).Â  The family court has jurisdiction over custody disputes.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Moreover, the gravamen of Motherâ€™s argument is not the jurisdiction of the family court to hear a custody case, but the failure of the family court to impose a change of circumstances burden on Father.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction and application of a burden of proof (to a claim within the courtâ€™s jurisdiction) are different concepts.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Dr. Gibbs used the term â€œlesionsâ€ to describe bruises, scratches and â€œanything on the skin that is what weâ€™re looking for.â€Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; It is fair to say, however, that Mother does not have the self-centered market cornered.Â  The childâ€™s guardian ad litem, Graham Hawkins, had substantial contact with the parents.Â Â  Mr. Hawkins observed that both parents used the child as a pawn in their feud.Â  Both parents have â€œexposedâ€ the child â€œto quite a lot of conflict betweenâ€ them.Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; At trial, Mother merely stated that Father â€œaccelerated the car at me.â€Â  Mother in hindsight recast the incident as less serious.Â  Yet law enforcement charged Father with assault with intent to kill based on information from Mother and Garner.Â  When Father was arraigned at a bond hearing the morning after his arrest, the press and Mother appeared.Â  Mother informed the magistrate she was afraid of Father.Â  She subsequently wrote the magistrate, claiming she was â€œscared to deathâ€ of Father.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4206","title":"Hardee v.

Smith Construction Co., Inc. and Companion Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. (Smith Construction) appeal the order affirming the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s finding that they must provide coverage for injuries sustained by an employee of Smith Constructionâ€™s subcontractor.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSmith Construction, a general contractor, routinely subcontracted with W.D. McDowell (McDowell) for framing work.Â  Because McDowell could not afford the lump sum payment to provide workersâ€™ compensation insurance for its employees, Smith Construction offered to pay the premium up front and deduct the insurance payments weekly from McDowellâ€™s pay.Â  On March 11, 2002, McDowell presented Smith Construction with a certificate of insurance indicating coverage from January 30, 2002 to January&nbsp;30, 2003. \r\nDuring the spring and summer of 2002, McDowell worked on various jobs for Smith Construction.Â  Smith Construction, relying on the certificate of insurance on file as of March 11, did not ask McDowell for proof of insurance on these jobs.Â  In the summer of 2002, McDowell started construction of the Socastee library for Smith Construction. Â \r\nOn September 6, 2002, Anthony Hardee, an employee of McDowell, sustained an injury at the Socastee site.Â  Several weeks later, McDowell discovered the insurer had canceled coverage on September 5, the day before Hardeeâ€™s accident.Â  \r\nOn January 16, 2003, Hardee filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against Smith Construction and McDowell.Â  Smith Construction admitted the injury but sought indemnification from the South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund (the Fund) pursuant to section 42-1-415(B) of the South Carolina Code. Â \r\nAfter a hearing on Hardeeâ€™s compensation claim, the single commissioner found, inter alia, neither McDowell nor Smith Construction was aware the policy had been canceled.Â  Further, the single commissioner found although McDowell provided Smith Construction with proof of workersâ€™ compensation insurance for 2002, it did not request a certificate of insurance for the particular job in question.Â  The single commissioner therefore concluded Smith Construction failed to comply with section 42-1-415 and, accordingly, found Smith Construction liable for Hardeeâ€™s claim.Â  On appeal to the commission, Smith Construction maintained because it had collected proof of insurance prior to McDowell being â€œengaged to perform work,â€ per section 42-1-415(B), it was not liable for Hardeeâ€™s injury.Â  The commission and circuit court affirmed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe question of whether Smith Construction met the requirements of section 42-1-415 is a mixed question of law and fact.Â  There is a question of law in determining the meaning of the statuteâ€™s phrase:Â  â€œat the time the [subcontractor] was engaged to perform work.â€Â  See Charleston County Parks&nbsp;&amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995) (determining legislative intent is a matter of law); Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 431-32, 21 S.E.2d 34, 50 (1942) (interpretation of a statutory term is not a finding of fact).Â  There is a question of fact regarding whether the work under construction at the time of the employeeâ€™s injury was the continuation of previous work or a new job.\r\nâ€œIn a case raising a novel question of law regarding the interpretation of a statute, the appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court.â€Â  Sloan v. South Carolina Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 466-67, 636 S.E.2d 598, 605-06 (2006) (stating the appellate court is free to decide the question based on its consideration of law, public policy, and the courtâ€™s sense of justice).Â  Notwithstanding, this court will accord the most respectful consideration to the interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration.Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 369 S.C. 176, ___, 631 S.E.2d 899, 905 (2006).\r\nAs to questions of fact in workersâ€™ compensation actions, this court reviews factual findings of the commission under the substantial evidence standard and may reverse a factual finding only if the finding is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record or is affected by error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmith Construction argues the commission erred by requiring a contractor to collect proof of insurance from its subcontractor for each job the subcontractor performs.Â  Smith Construction contends that a contractor complies with section 42-1-415 by obtaining proof of insurance from its subcontractor once a year.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder section 42-1-415(A) a contractor may transfer liability to the Fund when its subcontractorâ€™s employee is injured if the contractor submitted â€œdocumentation to the commission that a . . . subcontractor has represented himself to a higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance at the time the . . . subcontractor was engaged to perform work.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415(A) (Supp. 2006).\r\nSmith Construction, relying on this courtâ€™s decision in South Carolina Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App. 2004), contends the statute is satisfied if the contractor obtains proof of insurance the first time it hires a subcontractor in any given year regardless of the number or variety of jobs the subcontractor performs for the contractor throughout the year.Â  Hardee conversely argues House does not precisely address this issue and a common sense reading of the statute demands a contractor ask for proof of insurance at the beginning of each new job rather than once a year.Â  \r\nWe agree with Hardeeâ€™s interpretation of the statute.Â  In House, a subcontractor, â€œ[w]hen he was initially engaged to perform the work,â€ presented the contractor with proof of workersâ€™ compensation coverage from June 5, 1997 to June 5, 1998.Â  House, 360 S.C. at 469, 602 S.E.2d at 81.Â  When the original policy expired, the subcontractor provided a certificate indicating continuing coverage.Â  Id. at 469-70, 602 S.E.2d at 81.Â  The policyâ€™s history indicated several cancellations and reinstatements for nonpayment of premiums until March of 1999 when the insurer sent the subcontractor a notice of cancellation for refusal to pay the renewal premium.Â  Id. at 470, 602 S.E.2d at 81-82.Â  The subcontractor failed to pay the premiums necessary to reinstate the policy and was refused coverage by another carrier but continued to verbally advise the contractor that it had workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  Id. at 470, 602 S.E.2d at 82.\r\nThe issue presented in House was whether the contractor satisfied its obligation under section 42-1-415 when it requested a certificate of insurance at the beginning of the work or whether the contractor had a continuing duty to collect proof of insurance throughout the term of the work.Â  We found the contractor satisfied its burden under the statute by collecting proof of insurance â€œat the time the . . . subcontractor was engaged to perform work.â€Â  Id. at 471, 602 S.E.2d at 82 (quoting section 42-1-415(A)).Â  Further, we found that under 42-1-415(C) the subcontractor had a duty to notify the contractor of any lapse in coverage. Â Id. at 472, 602 S.E.2d at 83.Â  House does not address the situation presented here, where a contractor employs a subcontractor for a series of separate jobs in a single year.Â  However, the court in House concluded:Â  â€œThe statute does not require a prime contractor to continue collecting proof of its subcontractorâ€™s insurance coverage after the subcontractor is engaged to perform the work.â€ Â Id. (emphasis added).Â  Our reading of the House case leads us to conclude the work performed in House was on a continuous job rather than a series of separate jobs.Â  In this case, the work performed at the time of the injury was at a new job site, the Socastee project.Â  Accordingly, House does not control.\r\nTurning to the statute, we find the plain language contemplates the contractor require proof of insurance for each job the subcontractor performsÂ  regardless of the number of jobs the subcontractor performs in a given year.Â  To qualify for reimbursement under section 42-1-415, the contractor must collect proof of insurance at the time the subcontractor â€œis engaged to perform work.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  We find the phrase â€œengaged to perform workâ€ refers to when a subcontractor begins work at a construction site.Â  The statute is plain and unambiguous and, therefore, it is not our place to change the meaning of the statute.Â  See Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 891 (1995) (finding that if a statuteâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous the rules of statutory construction are unnecessary and the court cannot impose another meaning).Â  If the state legislature had intended for a contractor to collect documentation of insurance from a subcontractor once a year, it could have drafted the statute to reflect that intent.Â  See Croft v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 413, 618 S.E.2d 909, 914 (2005) (considering legislatureâ€™s options in wording a statute when interpreting the statute).Â  We find some support from our sister state, North Carolina, in arriving at this interpretation.Â  See generally Spoone v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, 309 S.C. 432, 434, 424 S.E.2d 489, 490 (1992) (giving weight to North Carolina precedent in interpreting workersâ€™ compensation legislation); Robertson v. Hagood Homes, Inc., 584 S.E.2d 871, 878 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003) (interpreting the North Carolina statute requiring proof of insurance and concluding:Â  â€œHaving chosen voluntarily to sublet a series of individual contracts, [contractor was] required . . . to obtain a certificate for each separate contract.â€).\r\nHaving concluded the statute requires proof of insurance for each job, we review the factual findings of the commission under the substantial evidence standard.Â  The single commissioner found, and the commission concurred, that neither McDowell nor Smith Construction was aware the policy lapsed and that, although McDowell provided Smith Construction with proof of workersâ€™ compensation insurance for 2002, it did not provide a certificate of insurance for the Socastee project.Â  Accordingly, Smith Construction failed to comply with the statute.Â  We find no error in these findings.Â  We therefore agree with the commission that because Smith Construction failed to comply with the statutory provisions, it was not entitled to shift the burden of coverage to the Fund.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4207","title":"State v.

Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Cedric Ali Colden appeals his conviction for kidnapping, armed robbery, and murder.Â  Colden argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance and refusing to order a mental competency evaluation.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 21, 2003, Cedric Ali Colden was involved in the kidnapping and armed robbery of Alexander Gorman, as well as the kidnapping, armed robbery, and murder of Christopher Carroll.Â  Colden was arrested and detained shortly thereafter.Â  \r\nColdenâ€™s trial was initially scheduled for Aiken Countyâ€™s September 7 and 14, 2004 terms of court.Â  Just before the trial was set to begin, in late August of that year, Colden changed lawyers.Â  He released his public defender and hired private counsel, who he believed â€œwould have the time to put into the case and focus on it and not be overloaded.â€\r\nOn September 7, the day the case was scheduled to be called, Coldenâ€™s recently retained attorneys moved for a continuance, relying primarily upon the fact they had become involved in the case only ten days earlier. Â Further, they indicated discovery motions had been recently filed and they did not know, at the present time, what evidence or witnesses would be involved in the trial.Â  The deputy solicitor stated that he would like to try the case during the October 18 term; however, Coldenâ€™s counsel responded that â€œgiven the seriousness of the case,â€ they felt four to five additional weeks was too short a time to allow for proper preparation.Â  The trial judge ordered the case carried over until the October 18 term, although subsequent discussions between the two sides would later move the case to the October 25 term of court.Â  \r\nOn October 6, Coldenâ€™s lawyers moved for another continuance, asking the case be set for December.Â  Emphasizing the severity of the charges against their client, Coldenâ€™s counsel argued they had not had sufficient time to prepare and noted they had not yet received or reviewed the police investigation notes regarding the case. Â Additionally, the attorneys inculcated that Colden had recently provided them with the name of an â€œexonerationâ€ witness whom they were uncertain they would be able to locate and interview within the next nineteen days. \r\nIn response, the solicitor stressed that the date was originally set for the September term of court and Coldenâ€™s prior counsel, the assistant public defender, had been notified two terms prior that the case would be called at that time. Â He emphasized it was Colden who waited until late August to make the decision to retain new representation.Â  Additionally, the prosecutor indicated he would provide Colden with all discovery the State possessed. \r\nThe judge denied the motion for a continuance.Â  However, he noted that if another issue material to the defense developed, particularly one involving the witness Colden had not yet located, he would consider changing his ruling.Â  Although they provided no new information, Coldenâ€™s attorneys renewed the motion for continuance at both the beginning and end of the trial.Â  The motions were denied.\r\nDuring a motion hearing on October 6, Coldenâ€™s counsel moved for an order for a competency and criminal responsibility evaluation.Â  Coldenâ€™s lawyers declared: â€œOftentimes when we talk to Mr. Colden, he is not really responsive to the questions that we put to him.Â  He has a tendency sometimes to ramble on with things that are unrelated to our discussions.â€Â  The prosecution objected, asseverating they did not know of any reason why Colden should be evaluated.Â  \r\nColden was subject to voir dire by the judge.Â  The colloquy with the court included discussion about his family and childhood.Â  Colden provided rational responses regarding his age (thirty-three) and education (high school graduate).Â  He described and discussed his four years of service in the Navy, previous job at a fiberglass plant, and work selling automobiles.Â  \r\nMrs. Jennings, Coldenâ€™s maternal grandmother, took part in the voir dire.Â  After providing some brief information about her grandsonâ€™s family background, she testified she had not noticed Colden needed a doctor, although she had asked for someone, such as a minister, to speak with him.Â  Similarly, Ms. Dickerson, Coldenâ€™s girlfriend of four years, stated she had requested for a social worker to see Colden.Â  Dickerson believed, at the time he was first arrested, Colden had â€œa lot of angry feelings, probably family-wise, that should have been resolved years ago that werenâ€™t.â€Â  Colden informed the court that he had not received any mental counseling, but had participated in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Program in 1994 and completed an Alcoholics Anonymous class in 1995.Â  \r\nColdenâ€™s criminal record was discussed.Â  His only prior offenses were relatively minor, magistrate-level misdemeanors, handled without the assistance of counsel.Â  The judge covered the various actors within the trial setting.Â  Colden stated he understood the trial judge was there to â€œlisten to both partiesâ€™ sidesâ€ and the jury â€œbasically decide[d] whether youâ€™re guilty or not . . . .â€Â  He explained his lawyersâ€™ duty was to â€œrepresent [him] to the best of their ability.â€ Â When the judge elucidated the specific role of the solicitor as being the person who would present witnesses and evidence to try to convince the jury of his guilt, Colden replied that he comprehended.Â Â Â  \r\nColden advised the court that he was aware he was being charged with one count of murder and two counts of armed robbery and kidnapping.Â  He described armed robbery as â€œbasically robbing somebody . . . with a weapon and so forthâ€ and kidnapping as â€œabducting somebody.â€Â  Colden affirmed he understood the need to talk with his lawyers regarding witnesses and facts.Â  He stated he had not yet discussed with his attorneys what the state would have to prove at trial for him to be convicted. Â Colden reported he, â€œfor the most part,â€ understood the things his counsel and the court had gone over with him.Â  Â Â \r\nIn support of their request, Coldenâ€™s attorneys vouched they had explained to their client the role of the judge, burdens of proof, and elements the solicitor would have to prove, and Coldenâ€™s inability to better discuss these issues with the judge left â€œno doubtâ€ a competency evaluation should be performed.Â  Counsel admitted to the court their clientâ€™s demeanor during the hearing was similar to what they had observed earlier, but added that at times Colden was â€œnot very responsive or would ramble on about something that may not be relevant to the questions that were asked.â€Â  They asked the court to look past his answers and consider his â€œherky, jerky movementâ€ and inability to know what to do with his hands.Â  Counsel conceded they felt Colden potentially understood what was happening, but felt the potential sentence of life without parole supported the need for the evaluation and should be made â€œout of a precaution.â€Â  \r\nIn response, the solicitor offered that during the judgeâ€™s questioning, Colden â€œanswered very rationally and thoughtfully and noted â€œhis ability to speak and his ability to enunciate and his ability to answer questions.â€Â  Although acknowledging he had no way of knowing if Colden suffered from any â€œun-surfaced mental illness,â€ he stated nothing in his investigation indicated its existence.Â  The solicitor opined that he detected a level of [mental] competenceâ€ in Colden and requested the evaluation be refused.Â  \r\nThe court determined Colden to be â€œa very articulate, intelligent young man,â€ and, noting his â€œgood grasp of dates and history,â€ found him â€œto be probably more lucid and articulately aware of his surroundings and proceedings against him than a number of defendants seen when this issue is raised.â€Â  The judge felt Colden maintained good eye contact, â€œseem[ed] fairly relaxed in answering questions about his past,â€ and appeared to be very forthright with court.Â  In conclusion, the court held:\r\n\r\nI detected nothing here today that would, I believed, indicate the need for further evaluation or any evaluation.Â  I do certainly have a lot of respect for Mr. Simmons and Mr. Grant and their abilities as lawyers, but without something specific in terms of his behavior as well as his inability to assist you all, at this point especially, I do not believe I have before me - - Iâ€™m going to deny any of the [McNaughten] issues.Â  Again, I think the burden is on the defense to bring that forward.Â  At this point, that has not been brought forward.Â  It was not really argued to the court by counsel nor his grandmother and fiancÃ© raised anything in my questioning of them related to either issue, his competency at this time or anything in his past that might indicate some mental health issues.Â  There was just no indication at this point in time that would cause the court to inquire an evaluation.Â  \r\n\r\nThe motion for a mental evaluation was denied.\r\nAt the outset of the trial, prior to jury selection, Coldenâ€™s attorneys renewed their request for a competency evaluation.Â  This, as well as another re-assertion of the motion just before jury instructions, was refused.Â  In expounding upon his decision, the trial judge stated: \r\n\r\nThe previous motion for a psychological evaluation was denied, and I stand by that ruling as well and, again, note that I do believe that based on the courtâ€™s interview of Mr. Colden a few weeks ago as well as his time in this courtroom during the course of this trial, I do not believe that any psychological evaluation was needed.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe granting of a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Tanner, 299 S.C. 459, 462, 385 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1989); State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 72, 537 S.E.2d 257, 260 (Ct. App. 2000); State v. White, 311 S.C. 289, 293, 428 S.E.2d 740, 742 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Reversals for the denial of a continuance â€œare about as rare as the proverbial hensâ€™ teeth.â€Â  State v. McMillian, 349 S.C. 17, 21, 561 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2002) (citing State v. Lytchfield, 230 S.C. 405, 409, 95 S.E.2d 857, 859, (1957)).\r\nThe ordering of a competency examination is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Drayton, 270 S.C. 582, 584, 243 S.E.2d 458, 459 (1978); State v. Singleton, 322 S.C. 480, 483, 472 S.E.2d 640, 642 (Ct. App. 1996). Â The refusal to grant such an examination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.Â  Drayton, 270 S.C. at 584, 243 S.E.2d at 459; State v. Buchanan, 302 S.C. 83, 85, 394 S.E.2d 1, 2 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  â€œThis is so, because the determination of whether there is â€˜reason to believeâ€™ a defendant lacks a certain mental capacity necessarily requires the exercise of discretion.Â  State v. White, 364 S.C. 143, 147-48, 611 S.E.2d 927, 929 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing and quoting State v. Bradshaw, 269 S.C. 642, 644, 239 S.E.2d 652, 653 (1977)).\r\nAn abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Irick, 344 S.C. 460, 464, 545 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001); State v. Funderburk, 367 S.C. 236, 239, 625 S.E.2d 248, 249-50 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  If there is any evidence to support the trial judge's decision, the appellate courts will affirm it. Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 598 S.E.2d 735 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Even without any evidentiary support, â€œ[i]n order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.â€Â  State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 473, 613 S.E.2d 381, 385 (Ct. App. 2005); see also State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995) (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Continuance\r\nColden argues the trial court abused its discretion by rejecting his motion for a continuance. Â He alleges his guarantee of effective assistance of counsel required the continuance because his attorneys: (1) were retained approximately two months prior to trial; (2) only recently learned of a potential â€œexonerationâ€ witness they had not yet been able to locate; (3) did not have ample opportunity to interview witnesses; and (4) had not received or reviewed the stateâ€™s evidence or â€œcriticalâ€ police investigation notes.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure state:\r\n\r\nNo motion for continuance of trial shall be granted on account of the absence of a witness without the oath of the party, his counsel, or agent to the following effect: the testimony of the witness is material to the support of the action or defense of the party moving; the motion is not intended for delay, but is made solely because he cannot go safely to trial without such testimony; and has made use of due diligence to procure the testimony of the witness or of such other circumstances as will satisfy the court that his motion is not intended for delay.\r\n(1) When a subpoena has been issued, the original shall be produced with proof of service or the reason why not served endorsed thereon or attached thereto; or if lost the same proof shall be offered with additional proof of the loss of the original subpoena.\r\n(2) A party applying for such postponement on account of the absence of a witness shall set forth under oath in addition to the foregoing matter what fact or facts he believes the witness if present would testify to and the grounds for such belief.\r\n\r\nRule 7(b), SCRCrimP.Â  \r\nThe granting or denial of a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, 454, 385 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1989) (citing State v. Dingle, 279 S.C. 278, 306 S.E.2d 223 (1983)).Â  Our appellate courts have shown great deference to trial judges in this matter.Â  See State v. Nicholson, 366 S.C. 568, 623 S.E.2d 100 (Ct. App. 2005) (no abuse of discretion in denial of alternate motion for a continuance to obtain new expert witness on characteristics of sexual abuse victim after the state, shortly before trial, gave notice to defense â€œas a professional courtesyâ€ where it was not required to provide the information either under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 (1963) or Rule 5, SCRCrimP); State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, 493 S.E.2d 349 (1997) (finding no abuse in denying a continuance in a second trial where the first trial transcript would be beneficial, but not essential, and where backup tapes were available and could have been used for impeachment purposes; but see McMillian, 349 S.C. 17, 561 S.E.2d 602 (holding the trial judge abused his discretion in denying a continuance request to obtain a transcript of first trial to use in impeaching a witness where retrial occurred only two weeks later, no backup tapes were available, and the credibility of the â€œretrialâ€ witness was shown to be crucial). \r\nIn State v. McKennedy, 348 S.C. 270, 559 S.E.2d 850 (2002), our Supreme Court found the defendant was not entitled to a continuance. Â Like the present case, the defendant merely referred to a neighbor he hoped to interview, but did not name the witness or indicate how that witness would be beneficial to his case.Â  McKennedy, who had less than one month to prepare for trial, argued he may have been able to produce additional witnesses, but could not make a specific showing of how any additional time would have been beneficial to his case.Â  The Supreme Court took note that it â€œhas repeatedly upheld denials of motions for continuances where there was no showing that any other evidence on behalf of the defendant could have been introduced, or that other points could have been raised, if more time had been granted to prepare for trial.â€Â  McKennedy, 348 S.C. at 280, 559 S.E.2d at 885 (citing State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 459, 469, S.E.2d 49, 51 (1996)).Â  \r\nThe court, in Skeen v. State, 325 S.C. 210, 481 S.E.2d 129 (1997), looked at defense counselâ€™s failure to request a continuance.Â  It determined there was no error because there was no evidence presented that additional time to prepare would have made any possible impact on the result.Â  In that case, counsel declared he would have liked to have consulted with his own medical expert to help him prepare for the cross-examination of a witness for the state, but could not suggest how this would have ultimately made any difference.Â  The court noted its reliance upon Bozeman v. State, 307 S.C. 172, 414 S.E.2d 144 (1992), and State v. Motley, 251 S.C. 568, 164 S.E.2d 569 (1968), where it found â€œno reversible error because the petitioner did not point to any other evidence or witnesses which could have been produced if a continuance had been granted.â€Â  Skeen, 325 S.C. at 214, 481 S.E.2d at 132; see also State v. Register, 323 S.C. 471, 482, 476 S.E.2d 153, 160 (1996) (no abuse of discretion in denying a continuance where counsel waited until one month prior to trial to investigate DNA evidence).\r\nRegarding the issue of the â€œexonerationâ€ witness, whose existence Coldenâ€™s counsel claimed at the October 6 hearing to have only recently been made aware, the record is silent as to whether they were still pursuing this witness at the time of the trial.Â  Despite the fact the judge expressly left the door open for reconsideration of the request for a continuance for the lack of this witness, at no time during the motions to continue, both before and at the conclusion of the trial, did Colden expressly state the name or need for this or any other witness.Â  His attorneysâ€™ concern about the witness was inadequate to support a motion for a continuance.Â  All components of Rule 7(b), SCRCrimP, including that of the attestation under oath, are strictly required, and a party asking for a continuance must show due diligence in trying to procure the testimony of the witness, as well as what the party believes the absent witness would testify to and the basis for that belief.Â  See State v. White, 311 S.C. 289, 292, 428 S.E.2d 740, 742 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding a continuance was not required where there was no compliance with Rule 7(b), SCRCrimP after an expert witness unexpectedly went on vacation and neither the defendant nor counsel offered under oath what facts they believed the absent witness would have testified, the grounds for that belief, that the continuance not intended to delay, or that due diligence was used in their efforts to make the witness available).Â  It is paramount that the party asking for the continuance show â€œdue diligenceâ€ was used in trying to procure the absent witness.Â  See State v. Yarborough, 363 S.C. 260, 266, 609 S.E.2d 592, 595-96 (Ct. App. 2005) (witnessâ€™s sudden decision not to cooperate did not mandate a continuance where no evidentiary hearing was necessary and, alternatively, where due diligence in asserting an attempt to acquire affidavits was not shown).Â  Not only was there no showing that by the time of trial counsel had been unable to locate the unnamed witness, but it is evident that the requirements of Rule 7(b) were never satisfied.\r\nThe record reveals Coldenâ€™s counsel had adequate time to investigate.Â  As the court noted at the very outset of the trial, the case had previously been continued from two earlier start dates.Â  Coldenâ€™s trial attorneys were hired on August 28, ten days before the September 7 motion hearing.Â  At that time, the public defenderâ€™s office had participated in a preliminary hearing on July 7.Â  A transcript of the hearing had been filed in the clerk of courtâ€™s office on July 16.Â  During this proceeding, Coldenâ€™s attorneys complained that the police report had not been received.Â  This record was thoroughly reviewed at the hearing and essentially revealed the entirety of the stateâ€™s case ultimately presented at trial.Â  Furthermore, the trial did not begin until October 27, nearly two months after Coldenâ€™s counsel had been retained.Â  \r\nA plethora of pre-trial motions reveals the depth of the attorneysâ€™ understanding of the nature of both the Stateâ€™s and defenseâ€™s cases, and the opening statement reveals a strong knowledge of the prosecutionâ€™s strategy. During trial, Coldenâ€™s attorneys presented a number of complicated and detailed motions and objections that, in order to make, required a thorough understanding of the case and a familiarity with the police investigation notes.Â  Their request for the jury to view the crime scene rather than rely on a video representation shows a strong grasp of the facts of the case.Â  The trial court noted: â€œColden has been represented more than ably by two very experienced and two very good attorneys. Yâ€™all did a very good job in defending Mr. Colden.â€Â  Thus, the lawyersâ€™ very performance further eviscerates the argument that Colden was denied effective assistance of counsel.Â  The request for a continuance lacked foundation.Â  \r\nB. Competency Evaluation / Competency to Stand Trial\r\nColden contends the trial court erred in denying his attorneysâ€™ request that a mental examination for competency to stand trial be ordered.Â  Because his attorneys opined their conversations with him â€œhad been disjointed and confused,â€ that there had been difficulty communicating with him, and that he frequently gave non-responsive answers and â€œrambled on,â€ Colden asserts he was entitled to the evaluation. Â He takes the position that the â€œdefense counselâ€™s representations alone should have invoked S.C. Â§ 44-23-410â€ because, due to their â€œfrequent conversation and interactionâ€ with him, the attorneys were in a unique and better position to evaluate his ability to assist them with his case.Â  He opines their concern about his capacity was supported by the uncharacteristic nature of the charge since he had a relatively clean record until he was thirty-three years old.Â  Finally, he avers that since the issue was raised â€œwell before trialâ€ (three weeks prior), the prosecution would not have suffered any harm had the evaluation been ordered, and it was therefore an abuse of discretion to deny the request.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œDue process of law prohibits the conviction of a person who is mentally incompetent.â€Â  Jeter v. State, 308 S.C. 230, 232, 417 S.E.2d 594, 595 (1992) (citing Bishop v. United States, 350 U.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440 (1956)); State v. Singleton, 322 S.C. 480, 482, 472 S.E.2d 640, 641 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  South Carolina law provides:\r\n\r\nWhenever a judge . . . has reason to believe that a person on trial before him, charged with the commission of a criminal offense or civil contempt, is not fit to stand trial because the person lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense as a result of a lack of mental capacity, the judge shall: \r\n(1) Order examination of such person by two examiners designated by the Department of Mental Health or the Mental Retardation Department or both . . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-410 (2002).Â  Thus, if the judge believes the person may be unfit to stand trial, a competency evaluation is compulsory.Â  See State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000) (finding the trial judge correctly ordered a competency evaluation where he felt the mental condition of the defendant might be called into question at trial and the defense stated it intended to offer expert testimony that the defendant suffered from a mental condition).Â  However, great deference is given to trial judge who sits in a better position to ascertain the defendantâ€™s faculties. Â See State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 587 S.E.2d 683 (2002) (holding the court did not err in refusing to order a second competency evaluation where deference was given to the trial judge who was able to view the appellantâ€™s demeanor); State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391 360 S.E.2d 706 (1987).\r\nIn State v. Burgess, 356 S.C. 572, 590 S.E.2d 42 (Ct. App. 2003), this court identified three factors to be considered in determining whether further inquiry into a defendantsâ€™ fitness to stand trial was warranted.Â  These are: (1) evidence of irrational behavior; (2) demeanor at trial; and (3) prior medical opinion regarding ability to stand trial. Â In some instances, the presence of just one of the factors may justify further inquiry requiring a mental evaluation.Â  In Burgess, the defendantâ€™s demeanor during the motion was very appropriate and at the hearing she understood the proceedings, the roles of the various trial participants, and the charges leveled against her.Â  â€œBeyond counselâ€™s statements regarding his inability to talk intelligently with Burgess and his opinion that she could not assist in her defense, counsel offered nothing to demonstrate that Burgessâ€™s mental retardation was such as to render her unfit for trial.â€Â  Burgess, 356 S.C. at 576, 590 S.E.2d at 44.Â  This court noted the trial judge did not experience any difficulty in conversing with Burgess and her testimony at a Jackson v. Denno hearing â€œseem[ed] to undercut any question of her competency.â€Â  Id.\r\nThis case has great similarities to the situation in Burgess. Â The reasoning behind the competency request did not rely upon any pre-existing history of mental illness (although in Burgess the defendant was mentally handicapped), but was instead based upon a perceived difficulty counsel faced in discussing matters with their client.Â  Coldenâ€™s voir dire conclusively revealed his ability to answer questions rationally, appropriately, and on point.Â  He demonstrated a manifest understanding of the proceedings, the roles of the various participants, and the charges he was facing.Â  Coldenâ€™s counsel offered nothing to demonstrate that his mental state was such as to render him unfit for trial.Â  As in Burgess, the courtâ€™s questioning of Colden in the pre-trial voir dire, his examination during a Jackson v. Denno hearing, and the courtâ€™s inquiry during the waiver of his right to testify, indicated that Colden had no difficulty conversing effectively.Â  Similarly, pre-existing evidence of the audiotaped statement of Colden did not raise any mental health concerns.Â  Finally, the trial courtâ€™s assessment of Coldenâ€™s demeanor throughout the trial was supportive of the courtâ€™s conclusion that the evaluation was not required.\r\nThere was no evidence of irrational behavior before or during the trial, nor prior medical opinion concerning competency as to require an evaluation under the Burgess factors.Â  Both after the hearing at the outset of the trial and at the close of the evidence, the trial judge specifically articulated that he saw nothing to indicate a need for an evaluation or any indication of a mental issue, past or present. Â Pellucidly, a review of the record and circumstances brings us to the ineluctable conclusion that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Coldenâ€™s motion for a continuance.Â  This denial was supported by the facts and mandated by the law. Â Absent any showing of the existence of a mental illness, the court properly denied Coldenâ€™s counselâ€™s request for a mental examination for competency to stand trial.Â  Accordingly, Coldenâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4208","title":"State v.

Holler, both of Sumter, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Joseph Moore (Moore) appeals the grant of summary judgment with regard to his claims of negligence, conversion, and civil conspiracy against M. M. Weinberg, Jr. and Weinberg and Brown, L.L.P. (collectively Weinberg).Â  The trial court granted Weinbergâ€™s summary judgment motion based on the doctrine of novation.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the late 1980s, Clarence Wheeler and Joseph Moore entered into a business relationship where Wheeler placed video-poker machines in Mooreâ€™s service stations.Â  Moore loaned Wheeler small amounts of money on a yearly basis for business expenses, such as buying video-poker machines and licenses.Â  Frequently, Moore and Wheeler either renegotiated these loans, or Wheeler paid the outstanding balance and he and Moore arranged a new loan. \r\nIn November 1999, Wheeler executed a note to Moore in the amount of $92,000. Â The note provided for a built-in premium of $12,000.Â  From the $92,000, Moore gave Wheeler $80,000 and kept the $12,000 premium. Â In order to secure his obligation, Wheeler assigned Moore $80,000, to be deducted from the anticipated proceeds from litigation over the sale of Wheelerâ€™s music business.Â  An escrow account containing $100,000 was held by the Clarendon County Clerk of Court pending the outcome of Wheelerâ€™s litigation. Â On November 18, 1999, Wheelerâ€™s attorney, M. M. Weinberg, Jr., the same attorney representing him in the litigation, prepared the Assignment, that provided, in part:\r\n\r\nClarence Wheeler does by this instrument assign to Joseph Moore so much of any recovery that he may make from the debt owed to him by A&amp;E, Inc. and the escrow account, which is pending as a result of said litigation, unto said Joseph Moore, his heirs and assigns to completely satisfy said debt.Â  \r\nThis assignment shall be and is to the extent of the money owed at the time of the execution of the assignment. \r\n\r\nWheeler settled the litigation and was to receive the $100,000 from the escrow account.Â  The opposing party was to receive the $10,829.16 in interest the account had accrued.Â  When Clarendon County Clerk of Court transferred the funds from the escrow account to Weinberg, he disbursed $74,458.24 to Wheeler, paid $520 to Wheelerâ€™s former secretary, and retained $25,000 as his attorneyâ€™s fee.[2]Â  In executing these disbursements Weinberg forgot or â€œoverlooked [the] Assignment.â€Â  \r\nAfter receiving the settlement money from Weinberg, Wheeler tendered $50,000 to Mooreâ€™s son in payment of the debt.Â  Moore was out of town at the time.Â  Subsequently, Moore notified Wheeler that he had not fully satisfied his loan obligation.Â  In June, 2002, Moore and Wheeler added a handwritten note at the end of the 1999 original: â€œI Clarence Wheeler agree that I owe Joseph H. Moore $80,000.00 since March 17, 2000 and agree to pay him 6% [i]nterest on the $80,000.00 balance.Â  Clarence Wheeler payed [sic] $50,000 on July 19, 2002.â€Â  Both Moore and Wheeler signed the addition to the note.Â  \r\nIn October 2002, attorney John Land contacted Weinberg by telephone on Mooreâ€™s behalf concerning the release of the assigned funds.[3]Â  Weinberg agreed to consult with Wheeler and respond to Mooreâ€™s demand for payment of Wheelerâ€™s outstanding obligation.Â  After receiving no response, Land informed Weinberg by letter, dated October 14, 2002, that Moore had an absolute security in the released funds through the Assignment and would not relieve Wheeler of his remaining indebtedness.\r\nOn April 15, 2003, Moore initiated this action against Weinberg, alleging negligence, conversion, and civil conspiracy.Â  Weinberg answered and asserted, inter alia, a defense based on the doctrine of novation.Â  Both Moore and Weinberg filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted Weinbergâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding the handwritten addendum to the 1999 original note constituted a novation, thus relieving Weinberg of any duty he may have owed Moore.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, [an appellate court] applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005); Eagle Container Co., LLC v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 622 S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004). Â In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005). Â If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury. Â Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 608 S.E.2d 587 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 611 S.E.2d 485 (2005); BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 608 S.E.2d 155 (Ct. App. 2005). Â On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. Â Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 607 S.E.2d 63 (2004); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Â Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 613 S.E.2d 533 (2005); Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Â Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 401 S.E.2d 169 (1991); Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 605 S.E.2d 744 (Ct. App. 2004). Â When reasonable minds cannot differ on plain, palpable, and indisputable facts, summary judgment should be granted. Â Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings. Â Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003). Â The nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Â Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003) (quoting George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001)); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy and should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues. Â Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Novation\r\nMoore argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on novation as a defense to negligence, conversion, and civil conspiracy claims.Â  We agree.\r\nNovation is a defense to contract claims.Â  â€œA novation is an agreement between all parties concerned for the substitution of a new obligation between the parties with the intent to extinguish the old obligation.â€ Â Wayne Dalton Corp. v. Acme Doors, Inc., 302 S.C. 93, 96, 394 S.E.2d 5, 7 (Ct. App. 1990) (citing Ophuls &amp; Hill Inc. v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 160 S.C. 441, 158 S.E. 824 (1931)). There must be an intention to create a\r\nnovation.&nbsp; Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, 377 S.E.2d 315 (1989). Â There can be no novation unless both parties so intend. Â Id. Â The party asserting a novation has the burden of proving\r\nit. Â Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 199 S.E.2d 719 (1973).Â  â€œThe circumstances attending the transaction alleged to be a\r\nnovation must show the intention to substitute a new obligation in place of the existing one.â€Â  Wellman, Inc. v. Square D Co., 366 S.C. 61, 72, 620 S.E.2d 86, 92 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An addendum that modifies a pre-existing agreement, but does not extinguish it, is not a novation. Â Parker v. Shecut, 340 S.C. 460, 531 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds 349 S.C. 226, 562 S.E.2d 620 (2002).\r\nIn order to effectuate a novation by the substitution of a new obligation, both contracting parties must consent that the new agreement is to replace the old one and their consent must be apparent.Â  See Superior, 261 S.C. at 263, and 199 S.E.2d at 722 (finding language appearing on the face of the â€œModifying Agreementâ€ was clear and unambiguous and negated an intention for there to be a novation). Â If only the debtor intends that the existing contract should be discharged by the new agreement, there is no novation; the creditor must concur.\r\nA novation may be broadly defined as a substitution of a new obligation for an old one, thereby extinguishing the old debt.Â  More specifically, novation is the substitution by mutual agreement of one debtor or one creditor for another, whereby the old debt is extinguished.Â  It is a mode of extinguishing one obligation by creating another; the substitution, not of a new paper or note, but of a new obligation in lieu of an old one, with the effect of paying, dissolving, or otherwise discharging it.Â  \r\nConsequently, a novation may be accomplished in three ways:\r\n\r\n(1)Â  By the substitution of a new obligation between the same parties,\r\nwith intent to extinguish the old obligation;\r\n(2)Â  By the substitution of a new debtor in the place of the old one, with\r\nintent to release the latter;\r\n(3)Â  By the substitution of a new creditor in the place of an old one,\r\nwith intent to transfer the rights of the latter to the former.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWhile Moore may have a cause of action in contract against Wheeler, his causes of action for conversion, negligence, and civil conspiracy against Weinberg sound in tort.Â  Tort causes of action are not transformed into actions in contract simply because they arise out of circumstances involving a contract.Â  As a matter of law, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the ground of novation.\r\nMoore maintains that, even if novation were an applicable defense, the trial court erred in granting Weinberg summary judgment on novation when the trial court itself noted material issues of fact in dispute. Â Because we determine novation is not a defense in the case sub judice, we need not consider this issue. Â Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nII.Â  Assignment\r\nAn assignment is the act of transferring to another all or part of oneâ€™s property, interest, or rights.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 119 (6th ed. 1992). Â It includes transfers of all kinds of property, including negotiable instruments.Â  Id.Â  The assignment of an account involves the transfer to the assignee the right to have money, when collected, applied to the payment of his debt. Â Id.Â  The interest in the property assigned can be present, future, or contingent; it may represent contract rights to money, property, or performance, or rights to causes of action.Â  5 S.C. Jur. Assignments Â§ 2 (2006).\r\nThree elements constitute an assignment: (1) an assignor; (2) an assignee; and (3) transfer of control of the thing assigned from the assignor to the assignee.Â  Donahue v. Multimedia, Inc., 362 S.C. 331, 338, 608 S.E.2d 162, 165 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Leon v. Martinez, 638 N.E.2d 511 (N.Y. 1994)).Â  â€œAn assignment of a right is a manifestation of the assignorâ€™s intention to transfer it by virtue of which the assignorâ€™s right to performance by the obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right to such performance.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 317(1) (1981). Â South Carolina jurisprudence has long recognized that a chose in action can be validly assigned in either law or equity.Â  Slater Corp. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 280 S.C. 584, 587, 314 S.E.2d 31, 33 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Forrest v. Warrington, 2 S.C. Eq. 254 (2 Des. Eq. 1804)); see also S.C. Jur. Assignments Â§ 19 (2006) (â€œA chose in action is the right of proceeding in a court to procure the payment of a sum of money, or the right to recover a personal chattel or a sum of money by action . . . . Â In South Carolina a chose or thing in action is statutorily included in oneâ€™s personal property and is assignable.â€).\r\nAn assignee stands in the shoes of its assignor. Â Twelfth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Natâ€™l Safe Corp., 335 S.C. 635, 639-40, 518 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[T]he assignee should have all the same rights and privileges, including the right to sue . . . Â as the assignor.â€).Â  \r\nIn the present case, Wheeler assigned his right in the litigation proceeds and escrow account to Moore, thus giving Moore the right to the funds in payment of the debt Wheeler owed. Â At the conclusion of the litigation, the Clarendon County Clerk of Court transferred the funds held in escrow to Weinbergâ€™s trust account. Â He disbursed the funds to Wheeler. Â The Assignment, however, directed Weinberg to pay Moore the outstanding balance of Wheelerâ€™s debt from the assigned funds rather than releasing the funds to Wheeler.Â  \r\nMoore asserts the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment because he presented evidence sufficient to prove all the elements for each of his three causes of action against Weinberg: (1) negligence; (2) conversion; and (3) civil conspiracy.Â  As to negligence and conversion we agree.Â  As to civil conspiracy, we disagree.\r\nA. Â Negligence\r\nIn order to prevail in a negligence cause of action, the plaintiff must establish: (1) the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) the defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.Â  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999); see also Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 561 S.E.2d 597 (2002).Â  â€œAn essential element in a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Â Without a duty, there is no actionable negligence.â€ Â Bishop v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998) (citing Rogers v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Parole &amp;\r\nCmty. Corr., 320 S.C. 253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995)). \r\nÂ â€œThe issue of negligence is a mixed question of law and fact.â€Â  Miller v. City of Camden, 317 S.C. 28, 31, 451 S.E.2d 401, 403 (Ct. App. 1994), affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 310, 494 S.E.2d 813 (1997). Â First, the court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty. Â Ellis v. Niles, 324 S.C. 223, 479 S.E.2d 47 (1996). Â If there is no duty, the defendant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Â Id.Â  If a duty does exist, the jury then determines whether a breach of the duty that resulted in damages occurred.Â  Miller, 317 S.C. at 31, 451 S.E.2d at 403; see also Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 334 S.C. 96, 512 S.E.2d 510 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nGenerally, duty is defined as the obligation to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another. Â Murray v. Bank of America, N.A.\r\n  354 S.C. 337, 343, 580 S.E.2d 194, 197 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 483, 238 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1977)).Â  \r\nOur search of South Carolina jurisprudence reveals the issues presented in this case are novel.Â  However, many other jurisdictions have established that attorneys owe a duty to third parties in factually congeneric circumstances.Â  \r\nThe Idaho Court of Appeals has determined that from the outset of the attorney-client relationship, a law firm is obliged to disburse, and the client has a right to receive, any funds that he is entitled to. Â Bonanza Motors, Inc. v. Webb, 657 P.2d 1102, 1104 (Idaho App. 1983). Â Moreover, the clientâ€™s right to the future performance of the law firmâ€™s obligation may be assigned.Â  Id. (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 321(1) (1979); 3 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts Â§ 413 (3d ed. 1960)). Â The fact that the performance of this obligation occurs later, when proceeds of the lawsuit arrive, does not defeat an assignment.Â  Id. Â Nor is an assignment defeated by the fact that the clientâ€™s right to receive money was conditioned upon the availability of proceeds from the action against the insurance company. Â Id.Â  An adequately identified conditional right may be subject to assignment. Â Id. (citing Restatement Â§ 320; 4 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Â§ 874 (1951)).Â  \r\nThe Idaho court emphasized:\r\n\r\nNotice of an assignment puts the obligor on guard. Â The obligor is liable to the assignee if the funds assigned are subsequently paid to the assignor in violation of the assignment. Â Once a valid assignment has been made, the assignor cannot cancel or modify the assignment by unilateral action without the assent of the assignee; nor may he defeat the rights of the assignee. \r\n\r\nId. (citing Wymer v. Wymer, 16 B.R. 497 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1980); Shore v. Shore, 139 Cal. Rptr. 349 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1977); Chapman v. Tyler Bank &amp; Trust Co., 396 S.W.2d 143 (Tex. Civ. App. 1965); 4 A. Corbin Â§ 890) (emphasis added). \r\nSimilarly, in Brinkman v. Moskowitz,238 N.Y.S.2d 876, 876-77 (N.Y. App. Term. 1962), the court held where an attorney had notice of the assignment of a portion of the proceeds\r\nof his clientâ€™s claim for personal injuries to the plaintiff, the attorney was liable to plaintiff for the resulting damage in distributing the proceeds without regard to the assignment.Â  Moreover, the Nevada Supreme Court determined that when a client assigns rights to the proceeds of a tort action to a creditor, those proceeds no longer belong to the client and an attorney is not obligated to pay those funds to his client. Â Achrem v. Expressway Plaza Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 917 P.2d 447, 450 (Nev. 1996) (citing Bonanza Motors,657 P.2d at 1104; Romero v. Earl, 810 P.2d 808 (N.M. 1991); Leon v. Martinez, 638 N.E.2d 511, 514 (N.Y. 1994); Aiello v. Levine, 255 N.Y.S.2d 921 (N.Y. App. Div. 1965); Brinkman, 238 N.Y.S.2d at 876-77).Â  In addition, the Nevada Supreme Court concluded that if a conflict exists between the clientâ€™s interests and the creditorâ€™s interests, the attorney should deposit the settlement proceeds in a trust fund account and request a court to direct the fundâ€™s distribution.Â  Achrem,917 P.2d at 450. Â Â \r\nThe Ohio Court of Appeals found a client who made a valid assignment of part of his right to settlement proceeds was no longer entitled to receive the full amount of the settlement. Â Hsu v. Parker, 688 N.E.2d 1099 (Ohio Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œAfter notice of the assignment has been given to the obligor, or knowledge thereof received by him in any manner, the assignor has no remaining power of release.Â  The obligor must pay the assignee.â€ Â Id. at 1102 (quoting 4 A. Corbin Â§ 890).Â  See also Berkowitz v. Haigood, 606 A.2d 1157, 1160 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1992) (â€œSince the client has the power to validly assign the proceeds, the attorney has the obligation to honor such an assignment, if properly notified. Â The attorney does not violate the [Rules of Professional Conduct] because the funds in his trust account no longer belong to his client. Â The funds belong to the assignee of the client and, therefore, the client is not entitled to receive them under RPC 1.15(b).â€).\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has recognized the relevance and admissibility of the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, in assessing the legal duty of an attorney in a malpractice action.Â  Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard,322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612, 613 (1996).Â  Adopting the position of the Georgia Supreme Court, the Smith court declared:\r\n\r\nThis is not to say, however, that all of the Bar Rules would necessarily be relevant in every legal malpractice action. Â In order to relate to the standard of care in a particular case, we hold that a Bar Rule must be intended to protect a person in the plaintiffâ€™s position or be addressed to the particular harm. \r\n\r\nId. at 437, 472 S.E.2d at 613 (quoting Allen v. Lefkoff, Duncan, Grimes &amp; Dermer, 453 S.E.2d 719, 721-22 (Ga. 1995)).Â  Failure to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct is not negligence per se, but merely one circumstance that may be considered along with other facts and circumstances in determining whether an attorney acted with reasonable care.Â  Id. at 437 n. 6, 472 S.E.2d at 613 n. 6. Â Additionally, this court has found the Rules of Professional Conduct relevant in deciding what constitutes reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees. Â See Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 581, 532 S.E.2d 310, 315 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œWe, therefore, conclude that our supreme court has not ruled that a fee agreement which violates Rule 1.5, RPC, is unenforceable in all circumstances as against public policy.Â  This does not mean, however, that the Rules of Professional Conduct have no\r\nbearing on the issue.â€)\r\nThe applicable part of Rule 1.15 provides:\r\n\r\n(d) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Â Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive . . . .\r\n(e) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which two or more persons (one of whom may be the lawyer) claim interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved. Â The lawyer shall promptly distribute all portions of the property as to which the interests are not in dispute.\r\n\r\nRule 1.15, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The comments provide the following clarification:\r\n\r\nParagraph (e) also recognizes that third parties may have lawful claims against specific funds or other property in a lawyerâ€™s custody, such as a clientâ€™s creditor who has a lien on funds recovered in a personal injury action. Â A lawyer may have a duty under applicable law to protect such third-party claims against wrongful interference by the client. Â In such cases, when the third-party claim is not frivolous under applicable law, the lawyer must refuse to surrender the property to the client until the claims are resolved. Â A lawyer should not unilaterally assume to arbitrate a dispute between the client and the third party, but, when there are substantial grounds for dispute as to the person entitled to the funds, the lawyer may file an action to have a court resolve the dispute.\r\n\r\nRule 1.15, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, cmt. 4.\r\nMoore offered the opinion of licensed South Carolina attorney Mark Hardee as to the nature of Weinbergâ€™s duty.Â  In his affidavit, Hardee advised that â€œ[a]n attorney on notice of an escrow assignment has a duty to that person.â€Â  Hardee elaborated:\r\n\r\nIt is well settled under the ethics rules and South Carolina law that an attorney who has knowledge of an assignment cannot dishonor the assignment when disbursing funds if he has knowledge of the assignment.Â  This is true even if his client instructs him to dishonor the assignment and disburse the funds. . . .Â  Defendants had a duty to the Plaintiff to ensure that assignment was paid or that proper notice was given to the Plaintiff providing him the opportunity to protect his interests.Â  Their failure to do either was a breach of that duty. \r\n\r\nWeinberg drafted the Assignment and does not dispute that he had notice of it.Â  He contends he either forgot it or overlooked it.Â  The Rules of Professional Conduct specifically address this particular injury.Â  Moore was a third party entitled to funds in an attorneyâ€™s possession.Â  Guided by the Rules of Professional Conduct and inculcated by precedent established in other jurisdictions, we conclude Weinberg owed Moore a duty to disburse the assigned funds to Moore.Â  \r\nWeinberg cited a Wisconsin Supreme Court case, Yorgan v. Durkin, 715 N.W.2d 160, 165 (Wis. 2006), in advancing his proposition that without a letter of protection, an attorney is not bound to a third party.Â  A letter of protection is a document by an attorney notifying a creditor that payment will be made when the case is settled or judgment is obtained.Â  Id. at 163.Â  In some circumstances, an attorney may agree to be contractually bound by proffering a letter of protection.Â  Id. at 165.Â  Such letters are â€œa common practice by which attorneys representing personal injury plaintiffs ensure their clients will receive necessary medical treatment, even if unable to pay until the case is concluded.â€Â  Id.Â  Weinberg contends Morganâ€™s cause of action fails without a letter of protection binding Weinberg.Â  \r\nÂ The facts in Yorgan are distinguishable from facts in this case.Â  In Yorgan, the client signed a chiropractorâ€™s form â€œAuthorization and Doctorâ€™s Lienâ€ directing an attorney to pay the chiropractor and purporting to give the chiropractor a lien against any proceeds the client recovered on a personal injury claim.Â  Id. at 162.Â  The client subsequently retained his attorney, who neither acknowledged nor signed the agreement.Â  Id.Â  The chiropractor sought recovery under contract and equitable lien causes of action.Â  Id.Â  The Wisconsin court held the chiropractor could not enforce the purported lien against the attorney under a contract cause of action.Â  Nor was the chiropractor entitled to an equitable lien enforceable against the clientâ€™s attorney.Â  In its decision, the court reasoned:\r\n\r\n[The chiropractor] should have known based on the plain language of the agreement that he might not be protected unless [the attorney] signed the agreement or took some other affirmative action.Â  [The chiropractor] was, or should have been, aware of the potential for harm that an unsigned agreement could create. Â At the same time, he had at least some ability to seek to ensure his protection by insisting on an attorneyâ€™s signature on the agreement or a letter of protection.\r\n\r\n715 N.W.2d at 168.\r\nA letter of protection offers one method protecting a creditorâ€™s interest. Â However, the absence of a letter of protection does not automatically relieve an attorney of a duty under an assignment.Â  Moncrief v. Donohoe, 892 So. 2d 379 (Ala. Civ. App. 2003) (reversing the grant of summary judgment to an attorney who failed to honor an assignment, noting the assigneeâ€™s theory of liability was based on a claimed assignment of the settlement proceeds and not the unsigned letter of protection).Â  Unlike the factual scenario in Yorgan, Weinberg drafted and executed the Assignment and acknowledged the validity of the Assignment in his testimony.Â  Moore had no reason to believe Wheelerâ€™s obligation was not secured by the Assignment.Â  In fact, both Moore and Wheeler indicated Moore would not have executed the $92,000 loan without the security the Assignment provided.Â  Weinbergâ€™s notice of the Assignment is undisputed.Â  Weinbergâ€™s duty to Moore arose out of his knowledge of the Assignment.Â  A letter of protection was not necessary to create that duty.Â Â  \r\nWe hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the negligence cause of action and reverse and remand that cause of action for a trial.\r\nB.Â  Conversion\r\nÂ â€œConversion is the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of the condition or the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.â€ Â Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 297, 594 S.E.2d 557, 566 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Crane v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 313 S.C. 70, 73, 437 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1993) (superseded by statute on other grounds)). Â Conversion is a wrongful act that emanates by either a wrongful taking or wrongful detention. Â Kirby v. Horne Motor Co., 295 S.C. 7, 366 S.E.2d 259 (Ct. App. 1988). Â â€œConversion may arise by some illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of anotherâ€™s personal property.â€ Â Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing\r\nOwens v. Andrews Bank &amp; Trust Co., 265 S.C. 490, 496, 220 S.E.2d 116, 119 (1975); Castell v. Stephenson Fin. Co., 244 S.C. 45, 50-51, 135 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1964)). Â A plaintiff may prevail upon a claim for conversion by showing the unauthorized detention of property, after demand. Â Mackela v. Bentley, 365 S.C. 44, 614 S.E.2d 648 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The plaintiff must show either title or right to possession of the property at the time of\r\nconversion. Â Oxford Fin. Cos. v. Burgess, 303 S.C. 534, 402 S.E.2d 480 (1991). \r\nThe Alabama Civil Court of Appeals considered facts similar to those in the instant case to determine whether an attorney committed the tort of conversion.Â  The court reasoned:\r\n\r\n  The assignment of the judgment was a transfer of the money to be collected on it; it was an absolute and unconditional appropriation of it to the assignee. Â The money, when collected by the attorney, was the property of the assignee, and held for his use, and we can perceive no reason why he should not be allowed to maintain this action to recover it after demand made, notice of the assignment of the judgment, having previously been given. . . . Â [A]n attorney at law, is the agent of the party, and the principal may appropriate money in his hands to the use of another, after notice of which, if he pays it to the principal like any other agent, he will be responsible to the person to whom the fund really belongs, in an action for money had and received, founded on the implied promise.\r\n\r\nBirmingham News Co. v. Chamblee &amp; Harris, 617 So. 2d 689, 691 (Ala. Civ. App. 1993) (quoting Gayle &amp; Saffold v. Benson, 3 Ala. 234, 235-36 (1841)).\r\nWhen Weinberg received the funds transferred from Clarendon County Clerk of Court, a portion of the funds belonged to Moore under the Assignment.Â  Weinberg had notice of the Assignment because he drafted it.Â  John Land demanded, on Mooreâ€™s behalf, payment of the money Wheeler owed. Weinbergâ€™s disbursement of the funds to Wheeler instead of Moore raises material questions regarding the claim of conversion. Â The trial court erred in granting summary judgment on this issue. \r\nC.Â  Civil Conspiracy\r\nThe elements a plaintiff must demonstrate in order to prove civil\r\nconspiracy include: (1) the combination of two or more people; (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff; (3) causing special damages.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 566-67, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006).Â  â€œIn order to establish a conspiracy, evidence, either direct or circumstantial, must be produced from which a party may reasonably infer the joint assent of the minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the unlawful enterprise.â€ Â Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 49, 619 S.E.2d 437, 453 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 575, 511 S.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct. App. 1998)); see also Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 601, 358 S.E.2d 150, 153 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Conspiracy may be inferred from the nature of the acts committed, the relationship of the parties, the interests of the alleged conspirators, and other relevant circumstances.Â \r\nId.Â  Because civil conspiracy is â€œby its very nature covert and clandestine,â€ it is usually not provable by direct evidence. Â Id. Â \r\nâ€œ[A]n attorney is [generally] immune from liability to third persons arising from the performance of his professional activities as an attorney on behalf of and with the knowledge of his client.â€ Â Pye, 369 S.C. at 564, 633 S.E.2d at 509 (quoting Gaar v. N. Myrtle Beach Realty Co., 287 S.C. 525, 528, 339 S.E.2d 887, 889 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  However, the South Carolina Supreme Court cautions that â€œan attorney may be held liable for conspiracy where, in addition to representing his client, he breaches some independent duty to a third person . . . .â€ Â Id. at 564, 633 S.E.2d at 509-10 (quoting Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995)).\r\n\r\n Our review of the record in Cowburn revealed no evidence of an agreement between the defendants or any indication they joined together for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff.Â  Accordingly, we held no genuine issue of material fact existed to establish a claim for civil conspiracy. Â 366 S.C. at 49, 619 S.E.2d at 453.Â  In this case, Moore provided no evidence that Weinberg and Wheeler colluded to deprive Moore of the funds he was entitled to under the Assignment. Â All the evidence contained in the record indicated Weinberg forgot about the Assignment.Â  No material question of fact exists as to the civil conspiracy cause of action.Â  Although the trial court erred in granting the summary judgment on the basis of novation, we may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any ground found in the record. Â See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).Â  Because no material question of fact as to the civil conspiracy cause of action existed, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment solely as to that cause of action.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold novation is NOT a defense to causes of action sounding in tort.Â  We rule Weinberg owed a legal duty to Moore based on Weinbergâ€™s Â Â notice of the Assignment.Â  Consequently, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the negligence cause of action.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we determine because Moore had a valid Assignment to a portion of the escrow account, accompanied by Weinbergâ€™s notice of the Assignment, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of conversion.Â  Finally, we conclude there is no material question of fact as to Mooreâ€™s civil conspiracy cause of action.Â  The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the civil conspiracy claim.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the order of the trial court is\r\nAffirmed in Part, Reversed in Part, and Remanded.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Weinberg represented Wheeler on a contingency fee basis.Â  The fee agreement provided that Wheeler would pay Weinberg one-third of his recovery; they later renegotiated the fee to one-fourth of the recovery.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Land clarified in his letter that, though he represented Moore, he would not take a case against Weinberg due to their relationship.Â  Land emphasized he hoped the matter could be resolved without further action. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4210","title":"Hull v.

Hull appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the Administrative Law Judgeâ€™s (ALJ) order valuing Hullâ€™s property for the 2002 tax year. Hull contends the ALJ erred in failing to take into account the lesseeâ€™s, K-Martâ€™s, financial difficulties and the special purpose of the building in determining the value of the property.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis appeal arises from a dispute regarding the 2002 tax valuation of the land and buildings located on Spartanburg County, Tax Parcel 6-20-08-004.01. &nbsp;The owner of the leasehold estate for the property is H/S Super Spartanburg, L.P., which is represented by its president and general partner, Hull.Â  Hull owns fifty percent of H.S. Super Spartanburg, L.P.&nbsp; Located on this property of approximately 21.7 acres is a special purpose 171,245 square-foot building, built in 1994, which is leased by K-Mart.&nbsp; A special purpose building of this type is referred to as a â€œbig box.â€ \r\nThe date that controlled the tax valuation for 2002 (tax control date) was December 31, 2001.&nbsp; The tax assessor valued the property at $12,343,400.&nbsp; Hull appealed the valuation to the ALJ.&nbsp;\r\nThe tax assessor testified he considered the physical location and the economic and financial characteristics surrounding the property.&nbsp; The tax assessor found the building was of good quality and very well located near an interstate, shopping mall, and many prime national tenants, such as Loweâ€™s, Samâ€™s, Circuit City, and Best Buy.&nbsp; &nbsp; \r\nThe tax assessor used the three standard approaches in valuing properties of this nature: cost approach, direct sales comparison approach, and income approach.&nbsp; According to the tax assessor the income approach â€œis of the utmost importance because buyers and sellers in essence buy such investment properties based on the income generating capacity of such properties.â€&nbsp; Utilizing the income approach, the tax assessor arrived at a value of $13,500,000 after considering the propertyâ€™s rent of $7.87 per square foot, which results in a yearly rent of $1,200,000, and then capitalizing the rental income.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nUnder the direct sales comparison approach, the tax assessor testified similar properties were selling from the high $50 to $80 per square foot on the tax control date.&nbsp; These findings led the tax assessor to value the property between $12,000,000 and $13,000,000 under the direct sales comparison approach.&nbsp; The tax assessor further emphasized the superiority of the income approach because on the tax control date, K-Mart was operating its business and paying rent according to its lease agreement.&nbsp; After using all three approaches, the assessor arrived at a valuation range of $12,000,000 to $13,500,000 and assessed the property at $12,343,400.&nbsp; \r\nOn the other hand, Hullâ€™s expert appraiser, Ashby Krouse, testified that the raw land was the only valuable aspect of the property.&nbsp; Krouse valued the property at $4,889,250.&nbsp; Krouseâ€™s valuation considered the history, anticipated actions by K-Mart, and credit worthiness of K-Mart.&nbsp; Krouse testified that on the tax control date, it was widely known that K-Mart was in financial trouble and that its stock had fallen to five dollars per share.&nbsp; K-Mart did not make its January 1, 2002 lease payment on this property, but was current in its lease payments on December 31, 2001.&nbsp; K-Mart filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on January 22, 2002.&nbsp; Not all K-Mart stores were closed.&nbsp; Hull testified K-Mart rejected its lease with Hull in February 2003.&nbsp;Â  \r\nAt trial, the appropriate capitalization rate was heavily debated.&nbsp; Krouse explained â€œthe net income from that property is capitalized by the capitalization rate to come up with a value of the subject property.â€&nbsp; Wal-Mart, a similar competitor, has a capitalization rate of approximately 8.5 to 9%, which according to Krouse, is indicative of Wal-Martâ€™s high credit worthiness.&nbsp; A low capitalization rate results in a high value.&nbsp; Hull prepared his own appraisals of the property and included a 10% and 12.5% capitalization rate in his appraisals.&nbsp; At trial, Hull testified he believed 13.5% would be a more appropriate rate, but insisted the property was only worth the value of the land.&nbsp;\r\nThe ALJ valued the property for the 2002 tax year at $10,215,000 based on a capitalization rate of 12.5%.&nbsp; The ALJ concluded that the 9% capitalization rate suggested by the tax assessor was inappropriate because the suggestions of bankruptcy and the drop in the price of K-Mart shares would cause a potential buyer, cognizant of the risk, to seek a higher return than the 9% assigned to the relatively stable competitor, Wal-Mart.&nbsp;\r\nThe ALJâ€™s order was appealed to the circuit court.&nbsp; The circuit court affirmed the ALJâ€™s order finding that there was ample evidence in the record to support the ALJâ€™s conclusion that K-Mart was solvent on the tax control date and in compliance with its lease obligations on the property.&nbsp; The ALJ accepted the tax assessorâ€™s evaluation with the exception of applying a 12.5% capitalization rate. The circuit court concluded the ALJâ€™s findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe review of an ALJâ€™s order is confined to the record.&nbsp; See South Carolina Code Â§1-23-610(C) (2005).&nbsp; â€œThe findings of the agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.â€&nbsp; Kearse v. State Health and Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n,&nbsp;318 S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995) (citation omitted).&nbsp; â€œâ€˜Substantial evidenceâ€™ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€&nbsp; Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Property Valuation Regarding K-Martâ€™s Financial Difficulties \r\n&nbsp;Hull argues the ALJ erred by failing to fully consider K-Martâ€™s financial difficulties in his property valuation.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\n&nbsp;Section 12-37-930 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) requires:\r\n\r\nAll property must be valued for taxation at its true value in money which in all cases is the price which the property would bring following reasonable exposure to the market, where both the seller and the buyer are willing, are not acting under compulsion, and are reasonably well informed of the uses and purposes for which it is adapted and for which it is capable of being used.\r\n\r\nâ€œAt least four methods exist for determining fair market\r\nvalue of property for taxation purposes: analysis of comparable sales, capitalization of gross income, capitalization of net income, and reproduction cost less depreciation and obsolescence.â€&nbsp; 72 Am. Jur. 2d State and Local Taxation Â§ 669 (2001).&nbsp;\r\nUnder the income approach, the appraiser determines the net rental income the property will generate and then capitalizes the income at a rate a land purchaser would expect to obtain from the property.&nbsp;\r\nId.&nbsp; Furthermore, the net income figure must reflect the appraiserâ€™s estimate of the propertyâ€™s earning potential, because the income approach â€œis based on the fundamental notion that the market value of income-producing property reflects the present worth of the future income stream.â€&nbsp;\r\nId.\r\nIn the case at hand, the record reflects that the tax assessor used the cost approach, direct sales comparison approach, and the income approach in valuating the property.&nbsp; The tax assessor capitalized the projected rent of over $1,200,000 at an approximate rate of 9% and reached a figure of about $13,500,000 under the income approach.&nbsp; The record also reflects testimony from Hull that 13.5% would be a more appropriate capitalization rate, which would result in a value of $6,778,343 for the property.&nbsp; The record contains appraisals created by Hull for the property using capitalization rates of 10% and 12.5%.&nbsp; Conversely, Hullâ€™s expert, Krouse, testified that the propertyâ€™s value was only $4,889,250, the value of the land.&nbsp; \r\nThe income approach is a recognized method for valuing property, specifically when the propertyâ€™s value is largely based on rental income. See S.C. Tax Commâ€™n v. South Carolina Tax Bd. of Review, 287 S.C. 415, 339 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 1985). The ALJ properly applied the income approach by identifying the annual gross income as $1,347,275 and subtracting expenses to reach a net annual income of $1,276,822.&nbsp; The ALJ then capitalized the net income rate by 12.5%.&nbsp; The ALJ accounted for K-Martâ€™s financial difficulties on the tax control date by utilizing a capitalization rate within the range of testimony, consistent with the evidence, and reflective of K-Martâ€™s financial situation on the tax control date.&nbsp; Therefore, the record supports the ALJâ€™s utilization of the income approach to determine the fair market value and the use of a 12.5% capitalization rate.\r\nThe ALJâ€™s valuation was additionally supported by comparable rents in the area.Â  The tax assessor testified the property in question rents for about $7.87 per square foot and the market rent for the neighborhood is approximately $7 per square foot.&nbsp; The tax assessor explained the amounts differ because the location of this property is prime.&nbsp; Hull also testified that the property was in â€œthe best location in the community.â€&nbsp; The property is near an interstate, a shopping mall, and other national stores.&nbsp; Therefore, the difference of $0.87 per square foot in the rent value used by the tax assessor and the marketâ€™s rental value is supported in view of the propertyâ€™s superior location.\r\nII.&nbsp; Deed Restrictions \r\nLastly, Hull argues the special purpose of the building is tantamount to a deed restriction restricting the building to use by K-Mart, which would affect the value of the property.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nIn Long Cove Home Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Beaufort County Tax Equalization Bd., 327 S.C. 135, 141, 488 S.E.2d 857, 861 (1997), the court interpreted section 12-37-930 to say that, â€œregardless of [the] method used to determine true value, deed restrictions affecting the use of the land must be considered when determining value.â€ &nbsp;Before the ALJ, Krouse testified that a special purpose, big box building like this K-Mart store could not be adapted for a similar, new tenant.&nbsp; He insisted the building would instead need to be torn down and the land made suitable for a new, big box store.&nbsp; If the landlord chose not to tear down the building, Krouse testified an option would be to use the building as a flea market.&nbsp; Hull estimated that a lease for a flea market would earn between $2 and $3 per square foot, significantly less than the current $7.87 per square foot K-Mart lease rental for the property.\r\nDespite the difficulty in adapting the property for a subsequent big box retailer, on the tax control date, K-Mart was not in default on its lease.&nbsp; On the tax control date, the special purpose property was fulfilling its intended purpose of housing a K-Mart store.&nbsp; K-Mart did not reject its lease until February 2003.&nbsp; The ALJ accounted for concerns about K-Martâ€™s financial status in arriving at the proper capitalization rate.&nbsp; Therefore, on the tax control date the difficulty of adapting the big box building was not a factor because K-Mart was utilizing the special purpose building for the purpose indicated in its lease.&nbsp; Additionally, speculation regarding the continuation of K-Martâ€™s use of the building was considered by the ALJ.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe property valuation by the ALJ considered the financial difficulties of K-Mart on the tax control date and substantial evidence supports the valuation.&nbsp; The special purpose building was being utilized for its intended purpose on the tax control date; therefore, the uniqueness of the building did not act as a deed restriction.&nbsp; Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the ALJâ€™s decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4211","title":"State v.

McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  SHORT, J.:Â  Cornelius Govan appeals his armed robbery conviction.Â  He argues the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress both his show-up identification as unduly suggestive and unreliable and the resulting in-court identification as tainted by the prior suggestive show-up.Â  We affirm. \r\n  FACTS\r\n  On December 29, 2004, the House of Tang Restaurant (Restaurant) was robbed at gunpoint.Â  The owner of the Restaurant, Yin Lin, stated that a â€œblack guyâ€ in a long black jacket and black hat (or rag) entered the Restaurant, held a gun â€œin my hair,â€ and demanded money from the cash register.Â  Lin put the money from the register into a bag, and the robber fled on a bicycle with one thousand twenty-four dollars.Â  Â \r\n  Yu Chen, a second Restaurant employee, was eating with Lin at the time of the robbery.Â  Chen corroborated the information provided by Lin.Â  When the robber fled on a bicycle, Chen ran outside and followed him in Linâ€™s car.Â  While following the robber, Chen hit the bicycle with the car, and then both the robber and Chen left the scene on foot.Â Â  \r\n  Approximately forty-five minutes after the robbery, the police arrested a man fitting the description provided by the Restaurant employees.Â  This man, later identified as Govan, dropped a brown paper bag when he saw the police and attempted to flee.Â  The police located the bag, which contained the same amount of money as was stolen from the Restaurant, and allowed a police dog to pick up a scent off the bag.Â  The police dog then led the police to Govan who was hiding in a ditch.Â  When the police took Govan into custody, they found a gun in his possession.Â Â Â  \r\n  The police held Govan in custody and brought Lin to identify him as the robber.Â  While Govan stood outside a police vehicle, Lin identified him from inside a second police vehicle.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  A Beaufort County grand jury indicted Govan for armed robbery.Â  At trial, the jury convicted Govan of armed robbery, and the trial court sentenced him to twenty-six years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  â€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The decision to admit an eyewitness identification is in the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion, or the commission of prejudicial legal error.Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 502, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000) Â (admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of trial judge; evidentiary rulings of trial court will not be reversed on appeal absent abuse of discretion or commission of legal error prejudicing the defendant).Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  I.Â  Preservation\r\n  We first note Respondent calls into question the preservation of Govanâ€™s issue on appeal.Â  Govanâ€™s attorney moved in limine to suppress the identifications of his client, and this motion was denied.Â  However, he did not object when the initial witness following opening statements presented the identifications to the jury.\r\n  â€œA defendant must object to an in-court identification to properly preserve the issue for appeal.â€Â  State v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 597, 611 S.E.2d 283, 288 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Normally, a motion in limine to exclude evidence made at the beginning of trial does not preserve the issue for appellate review because a motion in limine is not a final determination.Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001).Â  â€œThe moving party, therefore, must make a contemporaneous objection when the evidence is introduced.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œHowever, where a judge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, the aggrieved party does not need to renew the objection.â€Â  Id.Â  The issue is preserved:\r\n\r\n  Because no evidence was presented between the ruling and [the] testimony, there was no basis for the trial court to change its ruling. Thus, . . . [the] motion was not a motion in limine.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling in this instance was in no way preliminary, but to the contrary, was a final ruling. Â Accordingly, [the defendant] was not required to renew her objection to the admission of the testimony in order to preserve the issue for appeal.\r\n\r\n  Id. (Quoting State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n  The circumstances in Forrester are virtually identical to the circumstances in this matter.Â  A motion in limine to exclude evidence was made to and denied by the trial court.Â  Opening arguments followed, and during the testimony of the first witness, the evidence in question was introduced before the jury and no objection was made.Â  The Forrester court found that since no evidence was entered between the trial courtâ€™s ruling and the admission of the evidence, there was no opportunity for the court to change its ruling.Â  Forrester, 343 S.C. at 642-43, 541 S.E.2d at 840.Â  The Forrester court held Forrester did not need to renew his objection to preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  Id. at 643, 541 S.E.2d at 840.Â  Â Â In light of this binding precedent, we find Govanâ€™s argument regarding the admission of identifications is preserved for our review.\r\n  II.Â  Admission of Evidence\r\n  Govan contends the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress both his show-up identification as unduly suggestive and unreliable and the resulting in-court identification as tainted by the prior suggestive show-up.Â  We disagree.\r\n  A criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law through an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.Â  Brown, 356 S.C. at 502, 589 S.E.2d at 784.Â  The in-court identification of an\r\n  accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure created a significantly substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  Id. at 502-03, 589 S.E.2d at 784.Â  \r\n\r\n  The United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.[1]Â  First, a court must ascertain whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  The court must next decide whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed . . . Only if [the procedure] was suggestive need the court consider the second question-whether there was a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\r\n\r\n  Id. at 503, 589 S.E.2d at 784 (citations omitted).Â  â€œThe query posited is whether under the totality of the circumstances the identification was reliable even though the confrontation procedure may have been suggestive.â€Â  Carlson, 363 S.C. at 599, 611 S.E.2d at 290.Â  Â Â \r\n  Notwithstanding the inherent suggestiveness and general disfavoring of one-on-one show-up identifications, they may be proper where they occur shortly after the alleged crime, near the scene of the crime, as the witnessâ€™s memory is still fresh, where the suspect has not had time to alter his looks or dispose of evidence, and the show-up may expedite the release of innocent suspects and enable the\r\n  police to determine whether to continue searching.Â  Brown, 356 S.C. at 503-04, 589 S.E.2d at 785.Â  \r\n  In the case at hand, the show-up occurred within forty-five minutes of the robbery and was held near the scene of the crime when the witnessâ€™s memory was still fresh, and the suspect was wearing clothing consistent with the clothing described by the witnesses at the time of the crime.Â  Since one officer observed Govan drop the paper bag full of money and Govan was still in possession of his gun when he was apprehended, it would appear he had not had enough time to dispose of evidence.Â  We find that although this show-up was suggestive, it was not unduly suggestive under the above noted test.[2]Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  \r\n  Even were we to find the show-up to be unduly suggestive, Govanâ€™s attempt to exclude the in-court identification would fail under an analysis of the second prong of the test developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Biggers.Â  The in-court identification is admissible if the state can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the identification is reliable based on information independent of the out-of-court procedure.Â  Carlson, 363 S.C. at 600, 611 S.E.2d at 290.\r\n  \r\n  To determine whether an identification is reliable, it is necessary to consider the following factors: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witnessâ€™s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the criminal; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and (5) the amount of time between the crime and the confrontation.\r\n  \r\n  Brown, 356 S.C. at 504, 589 S.E.2d at 785.\r\n  The Restaurant employees viewed the robber in a well lit building.Â  Lin was immediately next to and in direct contact with the robber for the duration of the robbery as he held her by the arm and put a gun to her head.Â  Lin had significant opportunity to view the robber at a time when her attention would have been heightened.Â  Govanâ€™s appearance at the time of the show-up was consistent with Linâ€™s prior description of him, and Lin stated that she was certain Govan was the man who robbed her.Â  Again, the show-up occurred within forty-five minutes of the robbery.Â  Therefore, we find Linâ€™s in-court identification of Govan was reliable independent of the show-up identification.Â  We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in itâ€™s denial of Govanâ€™s motion to exclude both the show-up and in-court identifications. \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We find Govanâ€™s issue on appeal to be preserved for our review, but to be without merit.Â  We find the show-up identification was not unduly suggestive, but even if it were, the in-court identification of Govan would be reliable based on a source independent of the show-up.Â  Based on the foregoing, Govanâ€™s conviction is\r\n   AFFIRMED.\r\n  GOOLSBY, J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n  [1] See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).\r\n  [2] Lin testified at trial that the police told her that they had caught the man who robbed her, and they needed her to come identify him (though her difficulty with the English language and the use of an interpreter may have played a role in this statement).Â  However, the officer denied making this statement, and we yield to the trial court on issues of credibility.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
