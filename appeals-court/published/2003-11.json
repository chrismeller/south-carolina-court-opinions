A. Bailey &amp; Associates, Inc., Michael A. Bailey and Linda Bailey,\r\nAppellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From York County\r\nJohn Buford Grier, Special Circuit \r\n  Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3688\r\nHeard September 9, 2003 â€“ Filed November \r\n  3, 2001\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDouglas F. Gay, of Rock Hill, for Appellants.\r\nStephen M. Cox, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  MailSource, LLC, purchased \r\n  a direct mail processing business from M. A. Bailey &amp; Associates, Inc.Â  \r\n  Michael and Linda Bailey are the shareholders of M. A. Bailey (collectively \r\n  Bailey).Â  The asset purchase agreement contained a provision allowing either \r\n  party to demand arbitration of any dispute arising out of or relating to the \r\n  agreement.Â  Bailey appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of its motion to compel \r\n  arbitration.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nPursuant to the agreement, MailSource \r\n  paid part of the purchase price at closing and executed a promissory note for \r\n  the rest.Â  As part of the transaction, Bailey also signed a consulting agreement \r\n  containing a non-compete clause.Â  The principal agreement required the parties \r\n  to attempt in good faith to settle any disputes first through consultation and \r\n  negotiation, and then by mediation.Â  If those attempts failed, the agreement \r\n  provided â€œeither party may demand that the dispute be arbitrated. . . .â€Â  \r\nBailey retained an affiliated business known as \r\n  List Right, which provided mailing lists to customers.Â  MailSource accused Bailey \r\n  of conducting activities through List Right that violated the non-compete clause \r\n  and also questioned certain financial information provided by Bailey prior to \r\n  the sale.Â  The parties exchanged letters regarding potential arbitration and \r\n  the procedures that would govern the arbitration, but could not agree.Â  \r\nBailey then filed an action against MailSource \r\n  alleging nonpayment of the promissory note.Â  The following day, MailSource filed \r\n  this action against Bailey seeking damages and injunctive relief for alleged \r\n  violations of the non-compete agreement, fraudulent inducement to enter into \r\n  the contract, and unfair trade practices.Â  Bailey moved to compel arbitration \r\n  on this action.Â  MailSource has made no motion to compel arbitration of Baileyâ€™s \r\n  action on the promissory note.Â  \r\nIn denying the motion to compel arbitration, the \r\n  trial court found Bailey waived the right to arbitrate by failing to agree to \r\n  proposals to arbitrate and by filing a lawsuit against MailSource.Â  In a motion \r\n  for reconsideration, Bailey argued MailSource had not proved it would be prejudiced \r\n  by requiring arbitration.Â  The trial court denied the motion, concluding that \r\n  Bailey inappropriately raised an issue in its 59(e) motion that could have been \r\n  initially presented.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a circuit courtâ€™s decision regarding \r\n  a motion to stay an action pending arbitration, the determination of whether \r\n  a party â€œwaived its right to arbitrate is a legal conclusion subject to de \r\n  novo review; nevertheless, the circuit judgeâ€™s factual findings underlying \r\n  that conclusion will not be overruled if there is any evidence reasonably supporting \r\n  them.â€Â  Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 664-65, 521 S.E.2d \r\n  749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Preservation Issue\r\nMailSource contends whether it proved prejudice \r\n  is not properly before this court as Bailey did not raise the issue until the \r\n  motion for reconsideration.Â  We disagree. \r\nA party cannot raise \r\n  an issue for the first time in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion which could have been \r\n  raised at trial.Â  See, e.g., Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle, \r\n  334 S.C. 176, 186, 512 S.E.2d 123, 129 (Ct. App. 1999); Patterson v. Reid, \r\n  318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  However, the trial \r\n  court found that Bailey had waived its right to require arbitration by first \r\n  resorting to the courts.Â  The trial court did not, however, address the issue \r\n  of prejudice to MailSource.Â  Prejudice is a component that must be addressed \r\n  in determining whether waiver of arbitration has taken place.Â  In the motion \r\n  for reconsideration, Bailey merely asked the court to apply the appropriate \r\n  standard in making a finding of waiver.Â  Under these circumstances, it is appropriate \r\n  to request a court to review a ruling which the party contends fails to use \r\n  the proper standard.Â  Therefore, the issue is preserved for review by this court.Â  \r\n  See Anonymous (M-156-90) v. State Bd. of Med. Examâ€™rs, 323 S.C. \r\n  260, 279-80, 473 S.E.2d 870, 880 (Ct. App. 1996), revâ€™d on other grounds, \r\n  329 S.C. 371, 496 S.E.2d 17 (1998).Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWaiver â€“ Prejudice \r\n   \r\nBailey argues the trial court erred in finding \r\n  it waived the right to demand arbitration of the MailSource action by filing \r\n  a lawsuit.Â  Bailey contends MailSource has failed to demonstrate any prejudice \r\n  would result from compelling arbitration.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe right to enforce an arbitration clause may \r\n  be waived.Â  Hyload, Inc.&nbsp;v. Pre-Engineered Prods., Inc., 308 S.C. \r\n  277, 280, 417 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œâ€˜Waiver is the voluntary and \r\n  intentional relinquishment of a known right.â€™â€Â  Liberty Builders, 336 \r\n  S.C. at 665, 521 S.E.2d at 753.Â  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish waiver, a party must show prejudice \r\n  through an undue burden caused by delay in demanding arbitration.Â  Mere inconvenience \r\n  to an opposing party is not sufficient to establish prejudice.Â  There is no \r\n  set rule as to what constitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the question \r\n  depends on the facts of each case.Â  Furthermore, it is the policy of this state \r\n  to favor arbitration of disputes.\r\n\r\nTolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Trident Constr. Co., \r\n  Op. No. 25713 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Sept. 8, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 33 \r\n  at 41, 46) (citations omitted).Â  In Sentry Engineering &amp; Construction, \r\n  Inc. v. Marinerâ€™s Cay Development Corp., the supreme court stated, â€œit is \r\n  not inconsistency, but the presence or absence of prejudice which is determinative.Â  \r\n  In this context prejudice is undue burden on the objecting party, brought about \r\n  by delay in the other partyâ€™s making its demand for arbitration.â€Â  287 S.C. \r\n  346, 351, 338 S.E.2d 631, 634 (1985) (citations omitted).Â  â€œâ€˜[W]aiver may not \r\n  be inferred from the fact that a party does not rely exclusively on the arbitration \r\n  provisions of a contract, but attempts to meet all issues raised in litigation \r\n  between it and another party to the agreement.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Germany \r\n  v. River Terminal Ry. Co., 477 F.2d 546, 547 (6th Cir. 1973)).Â  â€œOrdinarily, \r\n  however, bringing a suit based on the contract instead of relying on the arbitration \r\n  provision constitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate.â€Â  Hyload, Inc., \r\n  308 S.C. at 280, 417 S.E.2d at 624.Â  â€œThis is simply a particular instance of \r\n  the general rule that acts inconsistent with the continued assertion of a right \r\n  may constitute waiver.â€Â  Id.  \r\nIn Sentry, Marinerâ€™s Cay asserted \r\n  Sentryâ€™s filing for an injunction was inconsistent with a right to arbitrate \r\n  and that the resulting prejudice to it constituted waiver.Â  Sentry, 287 \r\n  S.C. at 351, 338 S.E.2d at 634.Â  â€œSentry counter[ed] that the petition for injunction \r\n  did not seek to litigate any issue raised by arbitration, but was simply an \r\n  attempt to correct work complained of by [Marinerâ€™s Cay].â€Â  Id.Â  The \r\n  court found â€œno prejudice by delay, only the inconvenience of litigating. . \r\n  . .â€Â  Id.Â  The court went on to find:Â  â€œSentry at all times sought to \r\n  enforce its right to arbitrate under the contract; it is clear it had no intention \r\n  to waive the right, and no waiver is shown.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Hyload, however, this court found waiver \r\n  of the right to arbitrate.Â  Hyload, Inc., 308 S.C. at 280, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  at 624.Â  In Hyload, Pre-Engineered refused to pay Hyloadâ€™s invoices after \r\n  it lost a job to a competitor â€œand sued Hyload for breach of its exclusive distributorship \r\n  agreement.Â  In turn, Hyload cancelled the distributorship agreement for nonpayment \r\n  of the invoices.â€Â  Id. at 279, 417 S.E.2d at 624.Â  \r\n\r\nIn response to Pre-Engineeredâ€™s suit, Hyload demanded arbitration \r\n  pursuant to the distributorship agreement.Â  Pre-Engineered agreed to arbitrate \r\n  and voluntarily dismissed the court action.Â  Pre-Engineered then prepared and \r\n  sent the arbitration documents to Hyload for its signature.Â  Hyload never signed \r\n  the documents.Â  Instead, it commenced a claim and delivery action under the \r\n  security agreement, recovering [materials and accounts receivable and then instituted \r\n  an] action to recover the remaining balance . . . plus attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Pre-Engineered \r\n  answered and reinstituted its original action for breach of the distributorship \r\n  agreement as a counterclaim.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 279-280, 417 S.E.2d at 624.Â  This \r\n  court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Hyload waived its right to \r\n  arbitrate Pre-Engineeredâ€™s counterclaims due to its refusal to sign arbitration \r\n  papers and then initiating its own suit.Â  Id. at 280, 417 S.E.2d at 624.\r\nIn Liberty Builders, this court \r\n  again found waiver of the right to arbitrate where the party pursued active \r\n  litigation for two and a half years, sought the courtâ€™s assistance on numerous \r\n  occasions, and forced Horton to incur substantial costs and attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  waiting to demand arbitration until litigation was almost complete.Â  Liberty \r\n  Builders, 336 S.C. at 667-68, 521 S.E.2d at 754.Â  Liberty Builders required \r\n  Horton to answer the complaint and respond to discovery which would not have \r\n  been necessary in arbitration.Â  Id. at 665-66, 521 S.E.2d at 753.Â  In \r\n  Liberty Builders, the court focused on the amount of time and extensive \r\n  use of the judicial system.Â  Additionally, the court specifically noted the \r\n  finding of prejudice by the trial court and agreed that Horton was severely \r\n  prejudiced by Liberty Buildersâ€™ actions.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThere is no finding of prejudice to MailSource \r\n  in this case.Â  All parties agree MailSource needs to show prejudice for waiver \r\n  to exist.Â  Baileyâ€™s actions do not rise to the level found in Hyload \r\n  or Liberty Builders.Â  Bailey never induced MailSource to voluntarily \r\n  dismiss a lawsuit to pursue arbitration.Â  Additionally, Bailey exercised the \r\n  right to demand arbitration within twenty days of MailSource filing its lawsuit, \r\n  before even filing an answer.Â  There has been no substantial use of judicial \r\n  system resources, nor extensive requirements placed on MailSource as in Liberty \r\n  Builders.Â  MailSource admitted in oral arguments that the only prejudice, \r\n  given the time frame, was the two claims being considered separately.Â  \r\nA significant feature of this case not present \r\n  in most arbitration cases is that the arbitration clause is not mandatory.Â  \r\n  It is instead elective.Â  Either party may demand arbitration of a dispute but \r\n  neither is required to do so.Â  Indeed, MailSource acknowledged in oral argument \r\n  that it can demand arbitration of the lawsuit on the note, but candidly admitted \r\n  that it does not want to arbitrate either claim.Â  The only prejudice shown, \r\n  that of having claims arising from the same transaction resolved in different \r\n  forums, is therefore easily remedied; to the extent it is not remedied, any \r\n  prejudice is self-inflicted.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Gay, of Rock Hill, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  MailSource, LLC, purchased \r\n  a direct mail processing business from M. A. Bailey &amp; Associates, the shareholders \r\n  of which are Michael and Linda Bailey (collectively, the Baileys).Â  In addition \r\n  to the asset purchase agreement, the parties entered into a consulting agreement \r\n  that included a non-compete clause.Â  MailSource appeals the denial of its motion \r\n  for an injunction seeking to restrain the Baileys from violating the non-compete \r\n  clause.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe business bought by MailSource was \r\n  called â€œMail Rightâ€ by the Baileys.Â  The Baileys retained an affiliated business \r\n  called â€œList Right.â€Â  In addition to the asset purchase agreement and the consulting \r\n  agreement, the parties also entered into a supply agreement.Â  The supply agreement \r\n  defined â€œdirect mail processing services as:Â  all labeling, addressing, inserting, \r\n  sealing, sorting, bundling and delivery and directly related services provided \r\n  by Sellers and Mail Right Company prior to Closing Date.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThe non-compete clause in the consulting \r\n  agreement provides:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (a)&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;Noncompetition.Â  [The Baileys] shall not \r\n  take any of the following actions during the applicable Noncompetition Period \r\n  (as defined below):\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Become employed by . . . involved or engaged in, \r\n  or otherwise commercially interested in or affiliated with . . . any person \r\n  or entity that competes with [MailSource] or an affiliate thereof (each, a â€œCompany \r\n  Affiliateâ€) in the business of direct mail processing services.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      (ii)Â Â Â  Solicit or attempt to solicit, for competitive purposes, \r\n  the business of any of the clients or customers of a Company Affiliate, or otherwise \r\n  induce such customers or clients or prospective customers or clients to reduce, \r\n  terminate, restrict or alter their business relationship with a Company Affiliate \r\n  in any fashion . . . .Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMailSource alleges the activities the Baileys conducted \r\n  through List Right violate the non-compete clause, pointing particularly to \r\n  its activities on behalf of Church of the Rock.Â  After MailSource purchased \r\n  Mail Right, the Baileys, through List Right, provided a mailing list to the \r\n  church sorted according to United States Postal Service requirements for receiving \r\n  bulk mail discounted rates.Â  They also provided the sorted list on mailing labels \r\n  and the paperwork required by the post office.Â  The only service not performed \r\n  was applying the labels to the mailings.Â  The Baileys through List Right provided \r\n  similar services to other customers.Â  Michael Bailey, President of List Right, \r\n  stated in an affidavit:Â \r\n\r\nThe List Right business is not engaging in any activity \r\n  at the current time that it did not engage in prior to the sale of Mail Right \r\n  to [MailSource].Â  It is selling lists to customers, and providing those lists \r\n  to them in the format that the customer requests, which sometimes means providing \r\n  the list to customers on pre-sorted labels.Â  List Right is not doing any business \r\n  now that was formerly done by Mail Right when your affiant was President of \r\n  both. \r\n\r\nMailSource filed an action against the Baileys \r\n  seeking damages and injunctive relief for alleged violations of the agreement, \r\n  fraudulent inducement, and unfair trade practices.Â  MailSource asked for both \r\n  preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.Â  The trial court initially requested \r\n  a proposed order granting a preliminary injunction but then issued an order \r\n  denying a permanent injunction, finding that the pending appeal of the courtâ€™s \r\n  order denying arbitration divested it of jurisdiction.Â  Pursuant to MailSourceâ€™s \r\n  second motion for preliminary injunction, the trial court issued an order denying \r\n  it, stating:Â  â€œThe granting of said motion would alter the status quo during \r\n  the pendency of the appeal.â€Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMailSource contends the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to grant its motion for an injunction.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nâ€œThe granting of temporary injunctive relief is \r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent \r\n  an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  City of Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., \r\n  340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518, 520-21 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by \r\n  an error of law.â€Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, \r\n  560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nTo warrant a temporary injunction, the complaint \r\n  must allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for injunction \r\n  and the information offered by both sides must demonstrate the injunction to \r\n  be reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights of the plaintiff pending \r\n  in the litigation.Â  Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. \r\n  478, 480-81, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969).Â  Generally, to obtain an injunction, \r\n  a party must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, \r\n  and an inadequate remedy at law.Â  Roach v. Combined Util. Commâ€™n, 290 \r\n  S.C. 437, 442, 351 S.E.2d 168, 170 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\n\r\nIt is well settled that, in determining whether a temporary \r\n  injunction should issue, the merits of the case are not to be considered, except \r\n  in so far as they may enable the court to determine whether a prima facie showing \r\n  has been made.Â  When a prima facie showing has been made entitling plaintiff \r\n  to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard \r\n  to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.Â  \r\n\r\nTranscon., 252 S.C. at 481, 167 S.E.2d at 315.Â  â€œ[T]he \r\n  sole purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo. . . .â€Â  \r\n  Powell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219, 221, 199 S.E.2d 60, \r\n  61 (1973).Â  â€œ[A] temporary injunction is [used] to preserve the subject of controversy \r\n  in the condition which it is at the time of the Order until opportunity is offered \r\n  for full and deliberate investigation and to preserve the existing status during \r\n  litigation. . . .â€Â  County Council of Charleston v. Felkel, 244 S.C. \r\n  480, 483-84, 137 S.E.2d 577, 578 (1964) (citations omitted).Â  â€œA temporary injunction \r\n  is made without prejudice to the rights of either party pending a hearing on \r\n  the merits, and when other issues are brought to trial, they are determined \r\n  without reference to the temporary injunction.â€Â  Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle \r\n  Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992).Â  The court should be \r\n  guided by general principles of equity:\r\n\r\nFirst, the equities of both sides are to be considered, \r\n  and each case must be decided on its own particular facts.Â  Second, the court \r\n  of equity must â€œbalance the equitiesâ€ between the parties in determining what \r\n  if any relief to give.Â  The equities on both sides must be taken into account.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nForeman v. Foreman, 280 S.C. 461, 464-65, \r\n  313 S.E.2d 312, 314 (Ct. App. 1984) (citations omitted).\r\nâ€œ[A] court can, and should, grant a preliminary \r\n  injunction in an arbitrable dispute whenever an injunction is necessary to preserve \r\n  the status quo pending arbitration.â€Â  Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek Corp., \r\n  797 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1986).Â  The fact that a court orders arbitration of \r\n  a dispute does not â€œabsolve [it] of its obligation to consider the merits of \r\n  a requested preliminary injunction.â€ Â Roso-Lino Bev. Distribs., Inc. v. Coca-Cola \r\n  Bottling Co. of New York, 749 F.2d 124, 125 (2d Cir. 1984). \r\nWhile we are troubled by the Baileysâ€™ continued \r\n  insistence they are able to conduct business which is strikingly similar to \r\n  the business they sold and with which they agreed not to compete, we agree with \r\n  the trial court that an injunction would alter the status quo.Â  MailSource apparently \r\n  knew that the retained List Right business was closely related, if not complementary, \r\n  to the business it purchased, having sought and received a right of first refusal \r\n  to purchase List Right if the Baileys decided to sell.Â  Additionally, Michael \r\n  Bailey states in his affidavit that List Right continues to conduct business \r\n  as it did before the sale.Â  \r\nAt least two other reasons buttress the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of the injunction.Â  First, some of the covenants in the non-compete agreement \r\n  have already expired, and the remainder will soon expire.Â  While that does not \r\n  moot the issue, we must recognize the reality that any injunctive relief would \r\n  be short-lived under the terms of the non-compete clause.Â  MailSource invites \r\n  our attention to the law of other jurisdictions where courts have extended the \r\n  non-compete period following a breach to ensure the nonbreaching party receives \r\n  the benefit of the bargain.Â  We see no evidence this proposal was presented \r\n  to the trial court for its consideration, nor do we find support for it in South \r\n  Carolina law.Â  We therefore decline to adopt this procedure as a matter of first \r\n  impression, because to do so would essentially re-write the partiesâ€™ contract, \r\n  a service the courts of South Carolina do not perform.Â  See, e.g., Schulmeyer \r\n  v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 \r\n  (2003) (courts do not rewrite contracts); Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., \r\n  351 S.C. 167, 171, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2002) (same).Â  \r\nSecond, MailSource, in addition to seeking an \r\n  injunction, seeks and should be able to prove money damages from any breach \r\n  by the Baileys.Â  Cf. Skinner v. Elrod, 308 S.C. 239, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  599 (Ct. App. 1992) (breach of noncompetition clause was compensable in liquidated \r\n  damages).Â  An injunction is an equitable remedy; as such, it is available only \r\n  where no remedy at law exists or where the legal remedy would fail to make the \r\n  party whole.Â  \r\n\r\nThe general rule is that an injunction should be granted \r\n  only where some irreparable injury is threatened for which there is no adequate \r\n  remedy at law.Â  Whether a wrong is irreparable in the sense that equity may \r\n  intervene, and whether there is an adequate remedy at law for a wrong, are questions \r\n  that are not decided by narrow and artificial rules.\r\n\r\nCartee v. Lesley, 286 S.C. 249, 256, 333 S.E.2d 341, \r\n  345 (Ct. App. 1985) (citations omitted), cert. granted in part on other ground \r\n  and decision affâ€™d, 290 S.C. 333, 350 S.E.2d 388 (1986); see also \r\n  Knohl v. Duke Power Co., 260 S.C. 374, 376, 196 S.E.2d 115, 116 (1973) \r\n  (holding that a â€œcomplaint fails to state a cause of action for injunctive relief \r\n  unless facts are alleged which show that the plaintiff has no adequate and complete \r\n  remedy at lawâ€).\r\nBased on the specific facts of this case, we find \r\n  it is a close question whether a preliminary injunction should issue.Â  However, \r\n  we are unable to say the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to alter \r\n  the status quo by restricting the Baileysâ€™ activities.Â  See Simpkins, \r\n  348 S.C. at 668, 560 S.E.2d at 904.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3690","title":"State v.

Dudek, of the SC Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  Thomas Bryant was convicted \r\n  of murder and unlawful possession of a firearm.Â  The circuit court sentenced \r\n  him to life imprisonment without parole for murder and five years for possession \r\n  of the firearm, to run concurrently.Â  Bryant appeals, arguing the circuit court \r\n  erred by admitting evidence of his prior bad acts and convictions.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBryant is a paraplegic who was staying at a Days \r\n  Inn Hotel (â€œthe Hotelâ€) in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  Bryant met Daniel Austin \r\n  at a nearby nightclub.Â  \r\nAt approximately 3:30 a.m. on July 23, 1999, Austin \r\n  left the nightclub with Bryant.Â  Nellie Connell, the front desk attendant at \r\n  the Hotel, observed Austin and Bryant together at approximately 3:30 a.m., and \r\n  Austin was pushing Bryant in his wheelchair.Â  According to Connell, Austin subsequently \r\n  came to the front desk and requested a key to Bryantâ€™s room.Â  Connell gave Austin \r\n  a key to Bryantâ€™s room. \r\nBetween 3:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., Kevin Hawkins, \r\n  a guest at the Hotel, observed Bryant in the Hotel hallway.Â  Bryant had a scrape \r\n  on his nose and his pants were in his lap.Â  Bryant told Hawkins he had been \r\n  beaten and asked Hawkins to go to the front desk and ask for help. Hawkins went \r\n  to the front desk and spoke to Connell, and Connell indicated she would call \r\n  the authorities.Â  As Connell was telephoning the police, she heard gunshots. \r\n\r\nWhen the police arrived, Austin was lying in the \r\n  breezeway bleeding from gunshot wounds, and Bryant was in his hotel room firing \r\n  a gun through the door.Â  After a standoff lasting approximately twenty minutes, \r\n  officers heard one final shot.Â  The officers entered Bryantâ€™s room and found \r\n  Bryant on the floor with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his stomach.Â  Austin \r\n  died from his gunshot wounds.Â  \r\nFollowing a jury trial, Bryant was convicted for \r\n  murdering Austin and for unlawfully possessing a firearm.Â  He was sentenced \r\n  to life imprisonment without parole for murder and five years for possession \r\n  of the firearm, the sentences to run concurrently.Â  Bryant appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Â Â Â Â Â  Prior Bad Acts\r\nBryant argues the circuit court erred in admitting \r\n  testimony about Bryantâ€™s prior bad acts.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left \r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€ State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, \r\n  121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001). Furthermore, the admission of reply testimony \r\n  is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion, and a reviewing court will not find \r\n  an abuse of discretion â€œif the testimony is arguably contradictory of and in \r\n  reply to earlier testimony.â€Â  State v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, 214, 349 S.E.2d \r\n  339, 340 (1986).\r\nDuring direct examination in the stateâ€™s case, \r\n  John Campbell testified he first encountered Bryant at the nightclub a few days \r\n  before the night of Austinâ€™s murder.Â  Campbell was the bouncer for the club, \r\n  and he stated he kept a â€œclose eyeâ€ on Bryant on the night of the murder.Â  \r\nCampbellâ€™s testimony indicated Austin was not combative \r\n  toward Bryant on the evening of the murder.Â  Campbell testified Bryant arrived \r\n  at the nightclub on the night of the murder between 8:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m.Â  \r\n  Somewhere around 11:00 p.m., Austin entered the nightclub, and shortly thereafter, \r\n  Bryant and Austin were â€œvery chummy, [and] real friendly toward each other.â€Â Â  \r\n  Between 3:15 a.m. and 3:30 a.m., Austin and Bryant attempted to leave the nightclub, \r\n  whereupon Bryant fell out of his wheelchair and required assistance by both \r\n  Campbell and Austin to get back in his chair.Â  Bryant and Austin then left the \r\n  nightclub.Â  \r\nDuring cross-examination, Bryantâ€™s counsel attacked \r\n  Campbellâ€™s independent ability to remember the events of the night of the murder, \r\n  implying his recollection had been supplemented by his pre-trial discussions \r\n  with the solicitor.Â  \r\nDuring re-direct examination, the solicitor \r\n  sought to introduce testimony from Campbell that Bryant had threatened Campbell \r\n  during their first encounter to explain why Campbell had maintained a close \r\n  eye on Bryant on the night of the murder.Â  Over Bryantâ€™s objection, the court \r\n  allowed Campbellâ€™s testimony, ruling evidence that Bryant had previously threatened \r\n  Campbell was relevant to establish Campbellâ€™s basis for focusing on Bryant on \r\n  the night in question.Â  In doing so, the court provided the following limiting \r\n  charge to the jury: â€œNow, there was also testimony in the case about conduct \r\n  of a defendant toward a witness in the case.Â  That testimony was introduced \r\n  in regard to the credibility of the witness who gave it and must not be considered \r\n  against the character of the defendant.â€ \r\nViewing the testimony in light of our standard \r\n  of review, we conclude there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of \r\n  this evidence.Â  Bryant specifically attacked Campbellâ€™s credibility as to his \r\n  observation of Bryant and Austin, implying Campbellâ€™s memory had been supplemented \r\n  by the solicitor because he had no reason in a crowded bar to pay close attention \r\n  to Bryant or Austin on the night of the murder.Â  Campbellâ€™s redirect testimony \r\n  was relevant on this credibility issue.Â  The solicitor was entitled to introduce \r\n  testimony â€œarguably contradictory of and in reply to earlier testimonyâ€ to strengthen \r\n  Campbellâ€™s credibility once attacked.Â  Todd, 290 S.C. at 214, 349 S.E.2d \r\n  at 340.Â  Therefore, Bryantâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Prior Convictions\r\nBryant argues the circuit court erred by admitting \r\n  impeachment evidence of his prior firearms convictions because the prejudicial \r\n  effect of the convictions outweighed their probative value.Â  \r\nThe admission of prior convictions to impeach the \r\n  credibility of a defendant is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  court, and thus, its decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 \r\n  (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the circuit court \r\n  either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State \r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nRule 609(a)(1) provides prior convictions can be \r\n  used to impeach the accused when: 1) the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment \r\n  in excess of one year, and 2) the court determines the probative value of admitting \r\n  the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.Â Â  Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE.Â Â  \r\nIn weighing the probative value of prior convictions, \r\n  the circuit court should consider all relevant factors including but not limited \r\n  to the following:Â  â€œ1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; 2) the point \r\n  in time of the conviction and the witnessâ€™s subsequent history; 3) the similarity \r\n  between the past crime and the charged crime; 4) the importance of the defendant's \r\n  testimony; and 5) the centrality of the credibility issue.â€Â  State v. Colf, \r\n  337 S.C. 622, 627, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1998); Green, 338 S.C. at 433, \r\n  527 S.E.2d at 101.\r\nPrior to Bryantâ€™s testimony, the solicitor \r\n  indicated he intended to impeach Bryant with evidence of prior convictions including \r\n  voluntary manslaughter in 1987, possession of a firearm in 1997, and pointing \r\n  and presenting a firearm in 1998.Â  The circuit court first analyzed whether \r\n  to admit the voluntary manslaughter conviction using the Colf factors.Â  \r\n  The circuit court refused to admit the conviction, ruling the probative value \r\n  of the conviction was outweighed by the prejudicial effect.Â  In so ruling, the \r\n  circuit court made the following analysis: \r\n\r\nI think there is some substantial impeachment value to it \r\n  . . . as . . . almost every two years various things that have come up with \r\n  the defendant.Â  And of course, the point in time, obviously, still works against \r\n  allowing it, that was 16 years ago.Â  The third factor, the similarity between \r\n  the two, is obviously significant . . . [for probative value] . . . . But \r\n  itâ€™s also extremely significant for the value of prejudice that it brings into \r\n  the issue.Â  As far as the importance of the defendantâ€™s testimony . . . it is \r\n  important.Â  [Bryantâ€™s defense witnesses] didnâ€™t help his case too much . . . \r\n  . [Additionally,] the credibility issue is central.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nHowever, the circuit court did admit Bryantâ€™s convictions \r\n  for possession of an unlawful weapon in 1997 and pointing and presenting in \r\n  1998, ruling as follows:\r\n\r\n[The other two convictions] are both over a year old, \r\n  well within the 10-year period, and frankly, do indicate within themselves consistency \r\n  as well as when considered with the manslaughter conviction . . . . And \r\n  I realize certainly . . . [the] prejudicial issue related to these, but frankly, \r\n  I think under those circumstances the probative value does substantially outweigh \r\n  the prejudice that could be directed from the toward the defendant from it. \r\n  . . . [Furthermore,] the fact that he may tend to get in trouble from time to \r\n  time, while it has a certain amount of prejudice in it, also, does include that \r\n  issue of whether or not heâ€™s worthy of belief.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nBryant contends this analysis, combined \r\n  with the statements made during the circuit courtâ€™s voluntary manslaughter analysis, \r\n  demonstrates the circuit court admitted the prior convictions based on the improvident \r\n  belief the evidence was admissible to demonstrate propensity.\r\nAlthough, viewed in isolation, the statements \r\n  made by the circuit court could be construed to indicate the circuit court allowed \r\n  the evidence to prove propensity, we must view the circuit courtâ€™s statements \r\n  as a whole to determine its reasoning.Â  See State v. Evans, 354 \r\n  S.C. 579, 584, 582 S.E.2d 407, 410 (2003).\r\nReviewing the circuit courtâ€™s statements as a whole \r\n  reveals the circuit court allowed the testimony based on its belief the testimony \r\n  could lead to an inference Bryant was unworthy of credibility because of his \r\n  prior convictions.Â  This is an appropriate reason to admit prior convictions.Â  \r\n  See Green, 338 S.C. at 433, 527 S.E.2d at 101 (holding, under \r\n  certain circumstances, admitting prior, similar convictions is appropriate to \r\n  impeach the credibility of a defendant).\r\nFurthermore, evidence exists within the record \r\n  to support the circuit courtâ€™s decision to admit the evidence.[1] Â  \r\nThe state presented evidence indicating Bryant \r\n  possessed the requisite intent for murder.Â  In response, Bryant introduced the \r\n  testimony of Johnny Stapleton, intending to demonstrate Bryant shot Austin in \r\n  self-defense. \r\nAlthough Stapleton could \r\n  not remember giving the police a statement on the night of the murder because \r\n  he was â€œhighly intoxicated,â€ he acknowledged a statement bearing his signature \r\n  in which he indicated Austin, the victim, was intoxicated and demonstrated violent \r\n  behavior on the night of the murder.Â  Bryant then testified in his defense, \r\n  asserting he shot Austin in self-defense.Â  The state sought to introduce evidence \r\n  of Bryantâ€™s prior convictions to impeach his credibility.Â  After analyzing the \r\n  Colf factors and conducting a meaningful analysis pursuant to South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Evidence, Rule 609(a)(1), the circuit court admitted the evidence of \r\n  prior convictions.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in light of our standard of \r\n  review, the record indicates Bryant and Austin were the only people present \r\n  when the shooting occurred.Â  Additionally, the only other defense witness, Stapleton, \r\n  did not remember the events of the night of the murder.Â  Thus, Bryantâ€™s defense \r\n  is essentially predicated upon his version of the facts.Â  Furthermore, the convictions \r\n  were not stale.Â  Rather, the convictions were fairly close in temporal proximity \r\n  to the charged offense.Â  \r\nGiven the importance of Bryantâ€™s testimony to his \r\n  defense, and the stateâ€™s burden of discounting his testimony to prove the elements \r\n  of murder, we hold the circuit court, having conducted a Colf analysis, \r\n  was within its discretion to admit Bryantâ€™s prior convictions to impeach his \r\n  credibility.\r\nIn so holding, we note, our supreme court has cautioned \r\n  the bench and bar that admitting prior convictions similar to the charged offenses \r\n  is inherently prejudicial and should only be done rarely.Â  See Colf, \r\n  337 S.C. at 622, 525 S.E.2d at 246 (â€œ[E]vidence of similar offenses inevitably \r\n  suggests to the jury the defendantâ€™s propensity to commit the crime with which \r\n  he is charged.Â  This risk is not eliminated by limiting instructions.Â  Therefore \r\n  . . . â€˜evidence of any similar offense should be admitted only rarely . . . \r\n  .â€™â€) (quoting United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 419 (4th Cir. 1981)).Â  \r\n  However, where, as here, the circuit court has conducted the appropriate analysis \r\n  and evidence exists to support its ruling, we decline to disturb that ruling.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, Bryantâ€™s convictions are \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.\r\nBEATTY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nBEATTY, J:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I believe \r\n  the trial judge erred in the admission of defendantâ€™s prior convictions for \r\n  possession of an unlawful weapon, and pointing and presenting a firearm.Â  The \r\n  prejudicial effect clearly outweighed the probative value of these prior convictions. \r\n  The trial court admitted the prior convictions solely because the crimes indicated \r\n  a tendency to get in trouble. The trial courtâ€™s reasoning amounted to prohibited \r\n  character evidence under 404(b), SCRE. \r\nA fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence \r\n  is that an accused shall only be tried on the offense charged, indicted, and \r\n  currently before the court.Â  Thus, the courts, state and federal, closely scrutinize \r\n  the admission of prior convictions of the accused.Â  See Green v. State, \r\n  338 S.C. 428, 433, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000).Â  As a result, similar prior convictions \r\n  are not per se inadmissible; however, they are generally excluded. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nIn Green v. State, our supreme court opined, \r\n  â€œadmission of evidence of a similar offense often does little to impeach the \r\n  credibility of a testifying defendant while undoubtedly prejudicing him.Â  The \r\n  jury, despite limiting instructions, can hardly avoid drawing the inference \r\n  that the past conviction suggests some probability that defendant committed \r\n  the similar offense for which he is currently charged.â€ 338 S.C. at 434, 527 \r\n  S.E.2d at 101 (quoting United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 418-419 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1981)).Â  The Green court set forth factors to be \r\n  considered when weighing probative value against prejudicial effect.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Green court provided the following factors for \r\n  consideration when determining whether to admit evidence:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.&nbsp;\r\n       The impeachment value of the \r\n  prior crimes.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      The point in time of the\r\n        conviction and the witnessesâ€™ subsequent history.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       3.&nbsp;\r\n       The similarity between the past \r\n  crime and the crime charged.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       4.\r\n      &nbsp;The importance of the defendantâ€™s \r\n  testimony.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       5.&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;The centrality of the credibility \r\n  issue.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nId.; see also State v. Colf, \r\n  337 S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246 (2000).\r\nHere, the trial court considered the Colf factors \r\n  when in determining whether to allow the manslaughter conviction into evidence.Â  \r\n  Notwithstanding the trial courtâ€™s Colf analysis of the prior manslaughter \r\n  conviction, the record does not clearly reflect similar treatment of the two \r\n  additional prior convictions.Â Â  In fact, the record only reflects an indirect \r\n  consideration of 609 (a)(1), and (b) SCRE, absent the required Colf considerations, \r\n  as it relates to these prior convictions.\r\nDuring the colloquy on the admissibility of the \r\n  prior convictions the trial court stated:\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the credibility issue is central.Â  I think \r\n  when it comes down to it, in order for the jury to be able to see the credibility \r\n  of this defendant as well as any other witness, they should be able to see all \r\n  of these, but itâ€™s probably risky to let that in.Â  So Iâ€™m going to have to rule \r\n  that the manslaughter conviction would not be allowed to be used.\r\nHowever, the other two convictions, no question, would be \r\n  allowed to be used.Â  They are both over a year old, well within the 10-year \r\n  period and, frankly, do indicate within themselves consistency as well as when \r\n  considered with the manslaughter conviction.Â  So I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any question \r\n  that all of them do.\r\nAnd I realize certainly, Mr. Strickler, that prejudicial \r\n  issue related to these, but, frankly, I think under those circumstances the \r\n  probative value does substantially outweigh the prejudice that could be directed \r\n  toward the defendant from it.Â  So with that in mind, Iâ€™m going to allow the \r\n  convictions that have been requested within the 10-year period but not the manslaughter \r\n  conviction.\r\n\r\nThe trial court further stated:\r\n\r\n[I]t comes down to whether or not you present these to the \r\n  jury to let them decide whether they consider the defendant worthy of belief \r\n  or how much his worthiness of belief is affected by these convictions.\r\nAnd the fact that he may tend to get in trouble from time \r\n  to time, while it has a certain amount of prejudice in it, also, does include \r\n  that issue of whether or not heâ€™s worthy of belief.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the trial judge did not properly \r\n  consider the Colf factors.Â  It appears that the trial judge improperly \r\n  concluded that significant probative value exist merely because of the similarity \r\n  of the crimes.Â  Absent more, the courtâ€™s reasoning is erroneous.Â  \r\nThe prior convictions involved possession and pointing a \r\n  gun, the current charge involves the use of a gun in a homicide.Â  The prejudicial \r\n  effect is inescapable.Â  Further, it is evident that the trial courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that the probative value of the prior convictions outweighed the prejudicial \r\n  effect was based upon the courtâ€™s belief that the prior convictions, when considered \r\n  with the manslaughter conviction, indicated that the defendant had a tendency \r\n  to get in trouble.Â  That tendency to get in trouble raised the issue of whether \r\n  the defendant is worthy of belief.Â  The foregoing amounts to no more than impermissible \r\n  character evidence. 404(b), SCRE.\r\nThe defendant claimed self-defense.Â  The record \r\n  does not reflect overwhelming contrary evidence of his guilt; the only witnesses \r\n  to the homicide were the defendant and the deceased.Â  The defendantâ€™s testimony \r\n  was important and his credibility was a central issue in the case.Â  The prior \r\n  convictions were an attack on the defendantâ€™s character and yielded very little \r\n  if any impeachment value.Â  Absent impeachment value, there is no probative value \r\n  in the admission of the prior convictions in this case.Â  Therefore, I would \r\n  reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Both the conviction for possession of a firearm and the conviction \r\n    for pointing and presenting a firearm are punishable by imprisonment in excess \r\n    of one year.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-30(e) (2003) (stating it is \r\n    unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a violent crime to possess \r\n    a pistol); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-90(F) (2003) (stating possession of a pistol \r\n    by a person convicted of a violent crime is a Class F felony); S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 16-1-20(A) (6) (2003) (stating a Class F felony is punishable by not more \r\n    than five-years imprisonment); See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (2003) \r\n    (stating the crime of pointing and presenting a firearm is a felony punishable \r\n    by not more than five-years imprisonment).Â  Thus, we limit our analysis to \r\n    whether the circuit court abused its discretion in its application of the \r\n    Colf factors.Â  See Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE (stating prior convictions \r\n    can be used to impeach the accused when: 1) the crime was punishable by death \r\n    or imprisonment in excess of one year, and 2) the court determines the probative \r\n    value of admitting the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect); Colf, \r\n    337 S.C. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248 (holding in weighing the probative value \r\n    of prior convictions, the circuit court should consider all relevant factors \r\n    including but not limited to the following:Â  â€œ1) the impeachment value of \r\n    the prior crime; 2) the point in time of the conviction and the witnessâ€™s \r\n    subsequent history; 3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged \r\n    crime; 4) the importance of the defendantâ€™s testimony; and 5) the centrality \r\n    of the credibility issue.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  â€œWe decline to hold similar prior convictions \r\n    inadmissible in all cases.Â  Trial Courts must weigh the probative value of \r\n    the prior conviction against their prejudicial effect to the accused.Â  In \r\n    the special case, where the prior conviction is for the same offense as that \r\n    for which the defendant is being tried, the trial court generally will not \r\n    permit the government to prove the nature of the offenseâ€¦[it] would amount \r\n    to unfair prejudice.â€ Green, 338 S.C. at 433 n.5, 527 S.E.2d at 101 \r\n    n.5 (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3691","title":"Perry v.

Perry, Emily \r\n    Mitchell, Eliza Tremble, and Doris Green (&quot;Respondents&quot;) brought \r\n    an action against their uncle Cecil J. Gadsden, Jr. and the heirs of their \r\n    grandfather Cecil J. Gadsden, Sr. (collectively &quot;Gadsden&quot;), seeking \r\n    the partition of 110.54 acres of land occupied by Cecil J. Gadsden, Jr. (Cecil, \r\n    Jr.), as well as punitive damages and an accounting.Â  (R. at 3.)Â  The master \r\n    determined the various heirs' interests in the property and awarded $100 in \r\n    punitive damages, finding Cecil, Jr., had defrauded the heirs.Â  The master \r\n    ordered the parties to devise a partition plan within thirty days.Â  When the \r\n    parties failed to produce a plan, the master ordered a public sale of the \r\n    property.\r\n  Gadsden appealed, and this court held that \r\n    the master correctly found that Gadsden had defrauded the heirs, but ruled \r\n    that the property should have been partitioned in kind rather than sold.Â  \r\n    Perry v. Heirs at Law &amp; Distributees of Gadsden, 313 S.C. 296, \r\n    437 S.E.2d 174 (Ct. App. 1993). After granting Gadsden's petition for certiorari, \r\n    the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed our decision and remanded to \r\n    the master to partition in kind.Â  Perry v. Heirs at Law &amp; Distributees \r\n    of Gadsden, 316 S.C. 224, 449 S.E.2d 250 (1994).\r\n  On remand, the master entered a judgment \r\n    against Cecil, Jr. and in favor of ten respondents in the amount ofÂ  $151,146.27. \r\n    Cecil, Jr. appealed again asserting that he had been wrongfully denied credit \r\n    against the judgment for certain timber cultivation expenses and distributions \r\n    to the heirs over the years.Â  We affirmed the master's decision in an unpublished \r\n    opinion.\r\n  To effectuate the partition mandated by our decision, \r\n    partition commissioners were appointed by the master.Â  The court empowered \r\n    the commissioners to hire surveyors and appraisers as needed.Â  (R. at 25.)Â Â  \r\n    In determining the appropriate division of the property, the commissioners \r\n    considered, inter alia, the testimony of a licensed appraiser that \r\n    the fair market value of the property was $354,000.00 as of February 9, 1995. \r\n    (R. at 32.)Â  Using this value as a starting point, the commissioners adjusted \r\n    the value of the property to coincide with the increase in value of other \r\n    properties in the immediate vicinity over the previous two years.Â  (R. at \r\n    33.)Â  Adopting a per annum increase of ten percent, the commissioners determined \r\n    the current fair market value of the property to be $424,800.00.Â  (R. at 33.) \r\n    Based on the commissioners' report, the master entered an order in partition \r\n    on February 20, 1998 that left Gadsden with title to 4.26 acres of the 110.54 \r\n    acre tract.Â  (R. at 37-39.)\r\n  More than four years after the 1998 partition \r\n    order was entered, Gadsden filed a motion to reopen the judgment pursuant \r\n    to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, asserting the $424,800.00 value assigned to the property \r\n    by the commissioners was &quot;so incorrect as to amount to fraud upon the \r\n    Court.\" (R. at 61.)Â  By order dated May 3, 2002, the trial court denied Gadsden's \r\n    motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  A party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant \r\n    to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested \r\n    relief.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1991).Â  \r\n    Whether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion \r\n    of the trial judge.Â  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d \r\n    15, 17 (1992).Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial \r\n    court abused its discretion in granting or denying such a motion.Â  Saro \r\n    Invs. v. Ocean Holiday P'ship, 314 S.C. 116, 441 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. \r\n    App. 1994). \r\n\r\n \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I. Â Fraud Upon The Court\r\n\r\n \r\n  Although other motions to reopen judgments \r\n    based on fraud must be filed within a year of the judgment or order, Rule \r\n    60(b) allows a party to seek relief from an order for &quot;fraud upon the \r\n    court\" after the expiration of one year. Fraud upon the court is a narrow \r\n    and invidious species of fraud that &quot;subvert[s] the integrity of the \r\n    Court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the \r\n    judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its impartial task of \r\n    adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.&quot; Chewning v. \r\n    Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 78, 579 S.E.2d 605, 608 (2003).Â  Like all \r\n    other types of fraud, proving fraud upon the court requires showing that the \r\n    perpetrator acted with the intent to defraud, for there is no such thing as \r\n    accidental fraud.Â  See Chewning, 354 S.C. at 78, 579 S.E.2d \r\n    at 608 (&quot;'Fraud upon the court,' whatever else it embodies, requires \r\n    a showing that one has acted with an intent to deceive or defraud the court.\"); \r\n    Black's Law Dictionary 660 (6th ed. 1990) (\"As distinguished from negligence, \r\n    [fraud] is always positive, intentional.\").\r\n  Here, Gadsden's failings are several.Â  First, \r\n    Gadsden has not met his burden of showing fraudulent intent.Â  In fact, Gadsden \r\n    has failed to even allege the existence of fraudulent intent.Â  Instead, Gadsden \r\n    merely states that the \"appraised value of $424,800.00 as applied by the commissioners \r\n    to the realty in question is grossly insufficient and seriously understates \r\n    the actual value of the property.\"&nbsp; (R. at 59.)Â  Even if the value applied \r\n    by the commissioners understated the property's value, any undervaluation \r\n    would not amount to fraud unless the commissioners adopted the value with \r\n    fraudulent intent. GadsdenÂ  has failed to assert this is the case.Â  Moreover, \r\n    nothing in the record suggests thatÂ  the commissioners acted fraudulently.\r\n  Gadsden has not supported his charge of insufficiency \r\n    of value with anything of an evidentiary nature.Â  Gadsden has neither asserted \r\n    what the \"actual value of the property\" is, nor offered affidavits in support \r\n    of such an assertion.Â  To this end, Gadsden has asked this Court to take judicial \r\n    notice of the landâ€™s appreciation in value to support his claim. This, we \r\n    cannot do. Gadsden cannot escape his burden of establishing the essential \r\n    elements of fraud by passing that duty to the court. We hold Gadsden's allegation \r\n    of insufficiency of valueÂ  is so deficient that we would be compelled to find \r\n    the trial court abused its discretion had it granted his motion.\r\n  II.Â  Inequitable Prospective Application\r\n  Rule 60(b)(5), SCRCP, provides that judgments \r\n    may be set aside if \"the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, \r\n    or a prior judgment upon which it has been based has been reversed or otherwise \r\n    vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective \r\n    application.\" Rule 60(b)(5) is based on the historical power ofÂ  a court of \r\n    equity to modify its decree â€œin light of subsequent conditions.â€ Mr. G \r\n    v. Mrs. G, 320 S.C. 305, 311, 465 S.E.2d 101, 107 (Ct. App. 1995). Gadsden \r\n    asserts that this case fits under the \"prospective application\" language of \r\n    the Rule.Â  We disagree.\r\n  First, although motions under 60(b)(5) are \r\n    not subject to the requirement that they be filed within one year of the judgment, \r\n    they still must be filed within a reasonable time. Evans v. Gunter, \r\n    294 S.C. 525, 528, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1988). While we are reluctant \r\n    to proclaim that four years is a per se unreasonable period of time, Gadsden, \r\n    who bore the burden of showing the propriety of his motion, has failed to \r\n    proffer an argument as to why we should find that a four-year delay is reasonable \r\n    in this case. [1] Â  We therefore affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n    holding that Gadsden's 60(b)(5) motion is untimely.\r\n  Second, a ruling that a partition order has \r\n    prospective application would be inappropriate and an affront to the commonly \r\n    understood meaning of the term \"prospective application.\"&nbsp; The test typically \r\n    appliedÂ  to determine whether an order has prospective application is \"whether \r\n    it is executory or involves supervision of changing conduct or conditions \r\n    by the court.\" Saro Invs. v. Ocean Holiday P'ship, 314 S.C. 116, 120, \r\n    441 S.E.2d 835, 838 n.3 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  For example, injunctions ordinarily \r\n    have prospective application.Â  See, e.g., Binkley v. Rabon Creek \r\n    Watershed Conservation Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 558 S.E.2d \r\n    902 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Partition orders, on the other hand, are executed orders \r\n    because they mandate a one-time change in the ownership of property. As a \r\n    consequence, Gadsden's motion fails for being wholly outside the scope of \r\n    Rule 60(b)(5).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  HUFF, BEATTY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  At one point Gadsden does offer that the delay was â€œbecause \r\n    [Appellants] lacked the information necessary to attack the judgment until \r\n    that time. Once the data were in hand, however, appellants acted promptly \r\n    to assert their rights.â€Â  (Final Reply Br. of Appellants at 2.)Â  Not only \r\n    has Gadsden failed to disclose to the Court what this information is that \r\n    only became available after four years, but also one cannot help but notice \r\n    that the forgoing sounds suspiciously like a newly discovered evidence argument, \r\n    which would be time barred under Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3692","title":"S.C.

Buford Grier, Special Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3692\r\nSubmitted September 8, 2003 â€“ Filed \r\n  November 3, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames W. Tucker, Jr., of Rock Hill, for Appellants.\r\nForrest C. Wilkerson, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance \r\n  Company (â€œFarm Bureauâ€) brought this declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration \r\n  that it did not provide coverage and had no duty to defend a pending tort action \r\n  brought against its insured, Tender Loving Care Day Care (â€œTLCâ€), and TLCâ€™s \r\n  owners, Jonathan W. Whitmore, Mary D. Whitmore, and Dana Tomlin.Â  The circuit \r\n  court ruled the Farm Bureau policy provided no coverage for the underlying claim \r\n  and Farm Bureau had no duty to defend.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn May 4, 1997, Farm Bureau issued an insurance \r\n  policy to TLC, insuring for damages it may become legally liable to pay for \r\n  bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership or maintenance \r\n  of its premises.Â  The policy, known as a special multi-peril liability policy, \r\n  named TLC as the insured and provided: \r\n\r\n[Farm Bureau] will pay on behalf of the insured all sums \r\n  which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of \r\n  bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by \r\n  an occurrence, and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the insured \r\n  premises . . . and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit \r\n  against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property \r\n  damage . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nThe policy also contained endorsement MP0023, entitled â€œAdditional \r\n  Policy Exclusion Endorsement.â€Â  The exclusion stated:Â  â€œThis insurance does \r\n  not apply to bodily injury, property damage, or premises medical payments:Â  \r\n  (a) arising out of any acts . . . of sexual or physical molestation, \r\n  abuse, assault, or harassment caused . . . by any insured, or agent thereof \r\n  . . . .â€Â  (emphasis added). \r\nFollowing the issuance of the policy, Mimi K. Oates \r\n  and Jonathan D. Oates, Sr. (â€œOatesâ€) brought a tort action on behalf of themselves \r\n  and their infant son, Jonathan, against TLC, its owners, and its employee, Angela \r\n  Dawn Adams, alleging Adams severely injured Jonathan while he was in Adamsâ€™ \r\n  care. According to the complaint, Jonathan suffered permanent injuries from \r\n  â€œshaken baby syndromeâ€ on May 14, 1997.Â  \r\nParaphrasing the complaint, it alleges that TLC \r\n  and the owners of TLC are liable for the injuries to Jonathan caused by Adams \r\n  because they were negligent in hiring her, training her, supervising her, understaffing \r\n  the facility, failing to investigate reports of injuries, and generally, by \r\n  allowing Adams to mistreat and/or injure Jonathan.Â  The complaint also alleges \r\n  Adams was an employee acting within the scope of her employment at the time \r\n  of the injury, and was negligent in allowing herself to be placed in a position \r\n  of caring for more children than her capabilities permitted, in injuring Jonathan \r\n  on one or more occasions, in failing to ask for assistance, and in treating \r\n  the child in a manner inconsistent with a nurturing caregiver.Â  \r\nFarm Bureau brought this declaratory judgment action \r\n  to determine whether its insurance policy provided coverage for the acts forming \r\n  the basis of the underlying tort claim, thus contractually requiring Farm Bureau \r\n  to defend the suit.Â  The circuit court ruled the acts alleged in the underlying \r\n  tort action were not within Farm Bureauâ€™s policy coverage because:Â  1) the policyâ€™s \r\n  exclusionary clause excluded Oatesâ€™ negligence claims; and 2) Adamsâ€™ acts did \r\n  not constitute an â€œoccurrenceâ€ within the provisions of the policy.Â  Oates appeals.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOates argues the trial court erred by \r\n  finding Oatesâ€™ negligence claims were excluded by the policyâ€™s exclusionary \r\n  clause.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation \r\n  is to ascertain and give legal effect toâ€ the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined \r\n  by the contract language.Â  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart \r\n  Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 105, 413 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. App. 1992); seeÂ  \r\n  Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d \r\n  547, 550 (1975) (holding parties to a contract have the right to construct their \r\n  own contract without interference from courts to rewrite or torture the meaning \r\n  of the policy to extend coverage). When a contract is unambiguous a court must \r\n  construe its provisions according to the terms the parties used, understood \r\n  in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  C.A.N. Enter., Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Health and Human Servs.Â  Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d \r\n  584, 586 (1988).\r\nThe determination of whether an insurance \r\n  company is obligated to defend an action under its policy provisions is based \r\n  on the allegations of the complaint.Â  If the facts alleged in the complaint \r\n  fail to bring the case within the policyâ€™s coverage, the insurer has no obligation \r\n  to defend.Â  South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting \r\n  Assâ€™n v. Ferry, 291 S.C. 460, 463, 354 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1987).\r\nOatesâ€™ tort claim alleges the owners were \r\n  negligent, and as a result, Adams abused Jonathan, causing him bodily injuries.Â  \r\n  Oates does not allege any other damages as a result of the ownersâ€™ negligence. [1] Â Â  Thus, Oatesâ€™ negligence claims are predicated on Jonathanâ€™s \r\n  injuries, because without Jonathanâ€™s bodily injuries, the separate acts of negligence \r\n  alleged by Oates are not actionable.Â  See Estate of Cantrell v. Green, \r\n  302 S.C. 557, 560, 397 S.E.2d 777, 779 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding to prevail in \r\n  an action founded in negligence, the plaintiff must establish the following \r\n  three elements:Â  (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff;Â  \r\n  (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage \r\n  proximately caused by a breach of duty).\r\nConsequently, we must determine if Jonathanâ€™s bodily \r\n  injuries are excluded by the policy, for if his bodily injuries are excluded \r\n  by the policy, Oatesâ€™ negligence claims will also be excluded.Â  See McPherson \r\n  v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 316, 320, 426 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1993) \r\n  (holding plaintiffâ€™s tort claims against defendant for negligent training and \r\n  supervision were excluded by provisions of the insurance contract, where plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  injuries occurred during a car accident, and the insurance contract excluded \r\n  coverage for damages â€œarising out ofâ€ the use, operation, or ownership of an \r\n  automobile); Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v. Litchfield, 313 S.C. 471, 474, \r\n  438 S.E.2d 275, 277 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding plaintiffâ€™s negligence claims were \r\n  excluded under the provisions of an insurance policy where the policy excluded \r\n  any damages â€œarising out ofâ€ assault and battery, and plaintiff only alleged \r\n  physical damages incurred when employees of the defendant attacked him).Â  \r\nThe policy states itÂ  â€œdoes not apply to \r\n  bodilyÂ  injury . . . (a) arising out of any acts . . . of . . \r\n  . abuse . . . caused . . . by any insured, or agent thereof . . . .â€Â  \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  (R. 132).Â  We construe the language â€œarising out ofâ€ narrowly \r\n  to mean â€œcaused by.â€Â  McPherson, 310 S.C. at 320, 426 S.E.2d at 771.\r\nFarm Bureauâ€™s insurance policy does not \r\n  define â€œabuse.â€Â  Therefore, we look to the common meaning of â€œabuseâ€ in conjunction \r\n  with the other language of the contract to determine its meaning within the \r\n  policy.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  See Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, \r\n  332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 (1998) (holding when faced with an undefined \r\n  term, the court must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary \r\n  meaning); USAA Property and Casualty Ins. Co. v. Rowland, 312 S.C. 536, \r\n  539, 435 S.E.2d 879, 881-82 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding when a term is not defined \r\n  in an insurance policy, the court should define the term according to the usual \r\n  understanding of the termâ€™s significance to the normal person); see also \r\n  Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for City of Beaufort, 346 S.C. 401, \r\n  409, 552 S.E.2d 42, 46 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding dictionaries can be helpful \r\n  tools for the purpose of defining terms);Â  MGC Mgmt. of Charleston v. Kinghorn \r\n  Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 549, 520 S.E.2d 820, 823 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding \r\n  the court must give insurance policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular \r\n  meaning).Â Â  \r\n Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines \r\n  â€œabuseâ€ as â€œ[a] depart[ure] from legal or reasonable use in dealing with (a \r\n  person or thing); toÂ Â Â Â Â Â  misuse . . . . To injure (a person) physically or \r\n  mentally.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 8 (7th ed. 2000); see also \r\n  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 6 (1973) (stating \r\n  abuse means â€œ[t]o hurt or injure by maltreatmentâ€).\r\nSimilarly, the South Carolina Criminal Code defines \r\n  â€œchild abuse or neglectâ€™ . . . [as] an act or omission by any person which causes \r\n  harm to the childâ€™s physical health or welfare . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 \r\n  (2003); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(2)(a) (Supp. 2002) \r\n  (â€œâ€˜Child abuse or neglectâ€™, or â€˜harmâ€™ occurs when . . . [a person] . . . inflicts \r\n  or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages \r\n  in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental \r\n  injury to the child . . . .â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nWhen the allegations supporting liability in the \r\n  underlying negligence action are viewed under any of the above-stated definitions \r\n  of abuse, Jonathanâ€™s injuries arose out of abuse as that term is used in its \r\n  plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  Thus, the bodily injuries Jonathan sustained, \r\n  and the resulting damages from those injuries, are excluded by the insurance \r\n  contract.Â  Consequently, Farm Bureau is not contractually required to defend \r\n  TLC against Oatesâ€™ negligence claims. \r\n  [2] Â  See South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting \r\n  Assâ€™n, 291 S.C. at 463, 354 S.E.2d at 380 (holding an insurer has no duty \r\n  to defend where a partyâ€™s claims fail to bring the case within the policyâ€™s \r\n  coverage).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  [3] \r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  To the extent Oatesâ€™ complaint alleges damages that are not bodily \r\n    injury or property damages, Oates has not appealed these issues.Â  Thus, they \r\n    are deemed abandoned on appeal.Â  See Gold Kist Inc. v. Citizens \r\n    and Southern Nat. Bank of South Carolina, 286 S.C. 272, 275, 333 S.E.2d \r\n    67, 70 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding issues not argued on appeal are deemed abandoned).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Oates also argues the circuit court erred by holding Oatesâ€™ tort \r\n    claims did not constitute â€œoccurrences,â€ bringing the claims within the insurance \r\n    policyâ€™s coverage.Â  In that regard, Oates contends this case is analogous \r\n    to Manufacturers and Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. Harvey, 330 S.C. 152, \r\n    498 S.E.2d 222 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  However, because we hold the claims are specifically \r\n    excluded by the policy, we need not address this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n    \r\n [3]  Because oral argument \r\n    would not aid the Court in resolving any issue on appeal, we decide this case \r\n    without oral argument pursuant to South Carolina Appellate Court Rules, Rule \r\n    215.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3693","title":"Evening Post v.

Kerr, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nDerk B. K. Van Raalte, IV and J. Brady Hair, both of North \r\n  Charleston; and Richard W. Lingenfelter, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJEFFERSON, Acting J.:Â  The Post and Courier \r\n  filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking access to 911 tapes the City \r\n  of North Charleston had in its possession regarding the shooting death of Eric \r\n  Snowden.Â  The City refused the request because the tapes were to be used in \r\n  an upcoming lynching trial.Â  The Post and Courier filed a declaratory judgment \r\n  action seeking access to the tapes and the trial court denied access, finding \r\n  the Act exempted the tapes from premature disclosure because they were to be \r\n  used in a prospective law enforcement action. Â The Post and Courier appeals, \r\n  and we affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 21, 2000, four white men attacked \r\n  a black man, Eric Snowden, in front of a video store in North Charleston.Â  The \r\n  store owner called 911 and police were dispatched to the video store.Â  When \r\n  the officers arrived, they found Snowden inside the store, armed with a handgun.Â  \r\n  The officers shot and killed Snowden.Â  The video store owner remained on the \r\n  phone with the 911 dispatcher throughout the entire incident, and the 911 call \r\n  was audio taped.Â  The tapes included conversations between the officers and \r\n  the dispatcher and contained contemporaneous accounts of the events giving rise \r\n  to the lynching charges.\r\nThe four men who attacked Snowden were \r\n  arrested and charged with lynching.Â  On June 21, 2001, after reviewing the transcript \r\n  of the 911 call and listening to the taped recording, the solicitor decided \r\n  not to press charges against the police officers who shot Snowden.Â  On June \r\n  26, 2001, The Post and Courier filed a Freedom of Information Act request with \r\n  the City asking for production of the audio taped 911 call.Â  The solicitor informed \r\n  The Post and Courier that he considered the tapes evidence in the upcoming lynching \r\n  trial of the four men.Â  The solicitor denied the request to immediately produce \r\n  the tapes, but offered to give the tapes to The Post and Courier after \r\n  the trial.Â  Based on the solicitorâ€™s evidentiary assessment and request for \r\n  a delayed release, the City refused to turn over the tapes, stating they were \r\n  exempt from production prior to the lynching trial by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) \r\n  (Supp. 2002) of the Freedom of Information Act. \r\nThe Post and Courier filed a declaratory \r\n  judgment action seeking the production of the 911 tapes.Â  The estate of Eric \r\n  Snowden intervened in the case also seeking the production of the tapes in a \r\n  civil action it filed against the City.Â  The trial court denied The Post \r\n  and Courierâ€™s request for immediate production of the tapes, but allowed the \r\n  production of the tapes to Eric Snowdenâ€™s estate. [1] Â  The trial court found the tapes fell under the exemption in \r\n  section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) and ruled the City did not have to produce the tapes \r\n  until after the trial.Â  On February 26, 2002, when the solicitor played the \r\n  911 tapes in court during the lynching trial, the City released the transcript \r\n  of the 911 tapes to The Post and Courier.Â  The Post and Courier appeals the \r\n  denial of its declaratory judgment action.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Mootness\r\nThe City argues that The Post and Courierâ€™s \r\n  appeal is moot since the City released the tapes to The Post and Courier at \r\n  the conclusion of the lynching trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nA matter becomes moot â€œwhen judgment, \r\n  if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  \r\n  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing \r\n  Court to grant effectual relief.â€Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567-68, \r\n  549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001) (alteration in original) (quoting Mathis v. South \r\n  Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973)), \r\n  cert. denied, 535 U.S. 926 (2002). Â In civil cases, there are \r\n  three exceptions to the mootness doctrine:Â  (1) an appellate court can retain \r\n  jurisdiction if the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review, (2) an \r\n  appellate court can decide cases of urgency to establish a rule for future conduct \r\n  in matters of important public interest, and (3) if the decision by the trial \r\n  court can affect future events or have collateral consequences to the parties, \r\n  the appellate court can take jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at \r\n  596.\r\nIn Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 \r\n  S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996), a student challenged the school districtâ€™s \r\n  order which suspended him for ten days for coming onto campus after consuming \r\n  alcohol.Â  The court chose to hear the case because school suspensions are very \r\n  brief and are usually completed before judicial review can take place.Â  Id. \r\n  at 432, 468 S.E.2d at 864.Â  Similarly, although we can grant no further relief \r\n  in the current appeal, we choose to address The Post and Courierâ€™s argument \r\n  because the facts presented here are capable of repetition yet evading review.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Application of the Statute\r\nThe Post and Courier argues the trial \r\n  court erred when it denied its request to compel the City to turn the tapes \r\n  over to it pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe legislature exempted certain items \r\n  from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as follows:\r\n\r\nRecords of law enforcement and public safety agencies not \r\n  otherwise available by state and federal law that were compiled in the process \r\n  of detecting and investigating crime [are exempt from disclosure under the provisions \r\n  of the Freedom of Information Act] if the disclosure of the information would \r\n  harm the agency by:\r\n. . . the premature release of information to be used in \r\n  a prospective law enforcement action.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) (Supp. 2002).\r\n In Turner v. North Charleston Police \r\n  Department, 290 S.C. 511, 351 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1986), a husband \r\n  and wife were involved in a series of violent altercations culminating in the \r\n  shooting and serious injury of the wife.Â  The wife claimed she made a series \r\n  of calls to the police prior to the shooting.Â  The wife made a request for access \r\n  to the police departmentâ€™s tape recordings, written files, and daily activities \r\n  sheets.Â  The trial court denied her access to the tape recordings and the written \r\n  files.Â  The police department informed the city that the husband was about to \r\n  be indicted and tried in the next few weeks for shooting his wife.Â  The trial \r\n  court found that the exception exempting disclosure of information to be used \r\n  in criminal proceedings applied.Â  The wife appealed, and we affirmed the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Id. at 513, 351 S.E.2d at 584.\r\nAdditionally, in State v. Robinson, \r\n  305 S.C. 469, 476-77, 409 S.E.2d 404, 409 (1991), the supreme court held that \r\n  â€œ[t]he specific exemption under Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) for â€˜the premature release \r\n  of information to be used in a prospective law enforcement actionâ€™ clearly \r\n  exempts information regarding pending criminal prosecutions.Â  No specific \r\n  showing of harm is required by the State if the request involves such material.â€Â  \r\n  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\nWe find that the facts of this case fall \r\n  squarely within Turner.Â  The 911 tapes were to be used as evidence in \r\n  the forthcoming lynching trial and therefore fell within the exception listed \r\n  in section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B). \r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n HOWARD and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Access to the 911 tapes was to be provided to \r\n    Eric Snowdenâ€™s Estate upon proper request pursuant to the discovery provisions \r\n    of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  The criminal defendants in \r\n    the lynching trial were provided transcripts of the 911 tapes pursuant to \r\n    Rule 5 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.Â  The trial court \r\n    expressly prohibited the attorneys or their clients from disclosing the tapes, \r\n    copies of the tapes, transcripts, or any other summary or information related \r\n    thereto, to the media.Â  The court allowed the attorneys to disclose the information \r\n    to their clients and agents for the limited purposes sanctioned by the applicable \r\n    Rules of Procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3694","title":"Crawford v.

Brehmer and J. Austin Hood, both of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:Â  Johnny Crawford brought suit \r\n  against Janice Henderson and his underinsured motorist carrier (â€œUIMâ€), Southern \r\n  Heritage Insurance Company, seeking to recover damages from injuries suffered \r\n  in an automobile accident.Â  The jury awarded Crawford $1,099.38 in actual damages.Â  \r\n  On appeal, Crawford asserts the circuit court erred in quashing Crawfordâ€™s subpoena \r\n  to depose Henderson a second time.Â  He contends the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney should \r\n  not have been able to claim an attorney-client privilege to limit the first \r\n  deposition based on the following reasons:Â  (1) an attorney-client privilege \r\n  did not exist between Henderson and the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney; and (2) any \r\n  alleged attorney-client privilege was waived by counselâ€™s failure to file a \r\n  motion for a protective order pursuant to Rule 30(j)(3), SCRCP.Â  Finally, Crawford \r\n  contends the circuit court erred in permitting a nurse practitioner to give \r\n  an opinion regarding the cause of Crawfordâ€™s injuries.Â  We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arose out of an automobile accident \r\n  between Janice Henderson and Johnny Crawford.Â  While leaving a gas station, \r\n  Henderson pulled out into traffic on Highway 290 in Duncan and was struck by \r\n  Crawford.Â  Henderson testified she did not immediately see Crawfordâ€™s vehicle \r\n  because a truck that was entering the gas station blocked her line of sight. \r\n\r\nCrawford sued Henderson seeking to recover damages \r\n  for injuries both he and his passenger, Joan Wilson, suffered in the accident.Â  \r\n  After Crawford and Wilson settled the liability limits of Hendersonâ€™s policy \r\n  and entered into a covenant not to execute any judgment against Henderson, they \r\n  sought to recover damages from Southern Heritage Insurance Company (â€œSouthernâ€), \r\n  the UIM carrier. \r\nCrawford attempted to take Hendersonâ€™s deposition \r\n  four times.Â  Each time, Crawford served Southernâ€™s attorney, Karl Brehmer, with \r\n  the notices of the depositions. Â Henderson failed to appear. Â Ultimately, \r\n  Crawford filed a motion in circuit court seeking an order to compel Henderson \r\n  to appear for her deposition or be held in contempt.Â Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Brehmer appeared and informed the \r\n  court that he represented the UIM carrier and had no control over Henderson.Â  \r\n  Counsel claimed he had attempted to find Henderson in order to get her to appear \r\n  for a deposition. \r\nAfter hearing arguments, the circuit court found \r\n  Brehmer represented Henderson in name only and, therefore, Crawford would have \r\n  to personally serve Henderson with the notice of deposition.Â  The court reasoned, \r\n  â€œ[Counsel] does represent [Henderson], . . . for purposes of litigating liability \r\n  and damages.Â  But for purposes of paying money, . . .Â  itâ€™s very clear that \r\n  he represents the insurance carrier and he made that clear.â€Â  Â Â \r\nCrawford served Henderson and she appeared for \r\n  a deposition on February 21, 2001.Â  During the deposition, Crawfordâ€™s counsel \r\n  asked Henderson if she had discussed the case with Brehmer prior to the deposition \r\n  and asked her to relate the substance of the conversations.Â  Brehmer instructed \r\n  Henderson not to answer the question asserting the answer would violate the \r\n  attorney-client privilege.Â Â  Henderson did not answer the question and the deposition \r\n  was concluded. \r\nCrawford served Henderson with a second subpoena \r\n  and notice of deposition scheduled for June 19, 2001.Â Â  On June 4, 2001, Brehmer \r\n  filed a motion for a protective order pursuant to Rules 26(c) and 30(a)(2) of \r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. [1] Â  Counsel contended Crawford had already taken \r\n  Hendersonâ€™s deposition, the parties had not agreed to multiple depositions, \r\n  and good cause did not exist to compel an additional deposition.Â  In \r\n  response, Crawford moved to quash the motion for a protective order on the following \r\n  grounds:Â  (1) Henderson had not been served with the motion; (2) Brehmer could \r\n  not assert the attorney-client privilege because he had previously stated he \r\n  was not Hendersonâ€™s attorney; and (3) even if the attorney-client privilege \r\n  existed, it was waived because the procedural requirements of Rule 30(j)(3) \r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which permit a witness not to \r\n  answer a deposition question, had not been met.\r\nThe circuit court granted Brehmerâ€™s motion for \r\n  a protective order.Â  As a result, Hendersonâ€™s deposition was never reconvened \r\n  and the case proceeded to trial.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of the \r\n  plaintiffs and awarded $1,099.38 to Crawford and $30,413.61 to Wilson.Â  Crawford \r\n  appeals. [2] Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Existence of Attorney-Client Privilege\r\nCrawford argues the circuit court erred when it \r\n  granted Brehmerâ€™s motion for a protective order because, as a matter of law, \r\n  an attorney-client relationship does not exist between a UIM carrierâ€™s attorney \r\n  and an underinsured motorist, i.e., the named defendant.Â  Even if this \r\n  relationship can be established, Crawford contends the conversations between \r\n  Henderson and Brehmer were not protected by the attorney-client privilege. \r\nA.\r\nAlthough this case presents several related issues, \r\n  the threshold matter is to define the relationship created between a UIM carrierâ€™s \r\n  attorney and the named defendant.Â Â Â  \r\nThe attorney-client privilege protects \r\n  against disclosure of confidential communications by a client to his or her \r\n  attorney.Â  State v. Owens, 309 S.C. 402, 407, 424 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1992).Â  \r\n  â€œThe privilege is strictly construed to protect only confidences disclosed within \r\n  the relationship.â€Â  Id. at 407, 424 S.E.2d at 477.Â  To establish an attorney-client \r\n  privilege, the person asserting the privilege must show that the relationship \r\n  between the parties was that of attorney and client and that the communications \r\n  were confidential in nature.Â  Marshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 534, 538-39, \r\n  320 S.E.2d 44, 47 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In order to obtain the status of a client, \r\n  the person must communicate in confidence with an attorney for the purpose of \r\n  obtaining legal advice.Â  Id. at 539, 320 S.E.2d at 47.Â  The advice or \r\n  assistance must be sought with a view to employing the attorney professionally \r\n  whether or not actual employment occurs.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nInitially, we note there is no contractual \r\n  relationship between the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney and the named defendant.Â  As \r\n  conceded by Southern, a contract did not exist between Henderson and Southern.Â  \r\n  Instead, Crawford through his premium payment directly contracted with Southern.\r\nSignificantly, our Supreme Court has held \r\n  the rights of the UIM carrier and the named defendant are not synonymous, and, \r\n  in fact, may be conflicting.Â  Even though our Supreme Court has not directly \r\n  addressed the issue in the instant case, we our guided by the analysis in Broome \r\n  v. Watts, 319 S.C. 337, 461 S.E.2d 46 (1995).Â  In Broome, Carol and \r\n  John Broome sued Watts for injuries sustained in an automobile accident.Â  Nationwide \r\n  Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide) insured Watts for policy limits in the \r\n  amount of $50,000/$100,000.Â  The Broomes had underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  with United Services Automobile Association (USAA).Â  As required by section \r\n  38-77-160 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, the Broomes served USAA with the \r\n  complaints. [3] Â  USAA filed notices of appearance and motions for intervention \r\n  in both cases.Â  Shortly thereafter, the Broomes, Watts, and Nationwide entered \r\n  into a settlement agreement in which Nationwide agreed to pay its $50,000 liability \r\n  limits to the Broomes.Â  Pursuant to the agreement, Watts waived her right to \r\n  a jury trial and the Broomes agreed not to execute against Watts or Nationwide \r\n  any judgment obtained against Watts.Â  The Broomes, however, decided to proceed \r\n  with an action to determine damages for purposes of UIM coverage.Â  USAA was \r\n  not a party to the agreement.Â  USAA assumed the defense of the action under \r\n  section 38-77-160, filed answers, and requested a jury trial.Â  Over the Broomesâ€™ \r\n  objections, the judge ordered a jury trial.\r\nOn appeal, the Broomes asserted USAA was \r\n  bound by the settlement agreement.Â  Because Watts is the named defendant, the \r\n  Broomes contended the named defendantâ€™s waiver of a jury trial bound USAA even \r\n  though it was not a party to the settlement agreement.Â  Our Supreme Court rejected \r\n  the Broomesâ€™ argument, finding that Watts could not give up USAAâ€™s right to \r\n  a jury trial.Â  Broome, 319 S.C. at 340, 461 S.E.2d at 48.Â  \r\nCiting section 38-77-160 and a case interpreting \r\n  this statute, the Court found that a waiver by Watts was not â€œtantamount to \r\n  a waiver by USAA, because it blurs the distinction between the named defendant \r\n  (Watts) and the actual defendant (USAA) which must pay damages on behalf of \r\n  the named defendant in the event of liability.â€Â  Broome, 319 S.C. at \r\n  340, 461 S.E.2d at 48; see Williams v. Selective Ins. Co. of the Southeast, \r\n  315 S.C. 532, 534-35, 446 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1994) (holding that a UIM carrier \r\n  is entitled to assume control of the defense on an action even if the insured \r\n  chooses to settle with the at-fault driverâ€™s liability carrier).Â Â  The Court \r\n  concluded, â€œ[a]lthough the UIM carrier â€˜steps into the shoesâ€™ of the underinsured \r\n  motorist, it has rights separate and distinct from those of the underinsured \r\n  motorist.â€Â  Broome, 319 S.C. at 340, 461 S.E.2d at 48; see also \r\n  Ex parte Allstate Ins. Co., 339 S.C. 202, 528 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n  (holding in action to recover underinsured motorist benefits, the plaintiff \r\n  was required to serve UIM carrier with action against underinsured motorist \r\n  prior to trial; recognizing UIM carrier had rights that were separate and distinct \r\n  from the underinsured motorist and was not in privity with underinsured motorist \r\n  or his liability carrier).\r\nDespite the Supreme Courtâ€™s discussions \r\n  in Broome, Southern [4]  \r\n  contends section 38-77-160 supports a â€œquasi attorney-clientâ€ relationship.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Southern claims the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney essentially becomes \r\n  the attorney for the named defendant because he has stepped into the shoes of \r\n  the defendantâ€™s original attorney who was retained by the liability insurance \r\n  carrier.Â  We disagree for several reasons.Â  First, Southern has not cited nor \r\n  have we found any authority that South Carolina recognizes a â€œquasi attorney-client \r\n  relationship.â€Â  Secondly, and most significantly, the Supreme Court established \r\n  in Broome and Williams that the interests of a UIM carrier and \r\n  a named defendant are separate and distinct.Â Â  Clearly, once the named defendant \r\n  has settled for his liability policy limits, he no longer has a stake in the \r\n  outcome of the litigation.Â  The UIM carrier, on the other hand, still has a \r\n  viable, financial interest in the case.Â  As a result, the attorney for the UIM \r\n  carrier represents the carrier and not the named defendant.Â  Even though the \r\n  UIM carrier â€œsteps into the shoesâ€ of the named defendant, the procedure is \r\n  not in totality but merely to the point of coverage.Â  Thus, there is no direct \r\n  relationship between the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney and the named defendant.\r\nIn addition to the lack of case law and \r\n  statutory support for the creation of an attorney-client relationship in this \r\n  situation, we find there are ethical considerations that would also prohibit \r\n  it.Â  These issues may be illustrated by comparing an established attorney-client \r\n  relationship with the facts of the instant case.Â  \r\nFirst, if a relationship exists, the attorney has \r\n  some degree of control over the client and the client, in turn, has some input \r\n  in the outcome of the litigation.Â  See Rule 1.2(a), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR \r\n  (â€œA lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of \r\n  representation . . . and shall consult with the client as to the means by which \r\n  they are to be pursued.Â  A lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether \r\n  to accept an offer of settlement of a matter.â€).Â  Here, the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney \r\n  has no control over the named defendant because the attorney represents the \r\n  insurance company and the named defendant no longer has an interest once a covenant \r\n  not to execute is entered into with the defendantâ€™s liability carrier.Â  \r\nSecondly, under the normal situation, a plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  attorney is not permitted to have direct contact with the defendant, but instead, \r\n  must serve all pleadings and motions upon the defendantâ€™s attorney.Â  See \r\n  Rule 4.2, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR (â€œIn representing a client, a lawyer shall not \r\n  communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer \r\n  knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has \r\n  the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so.â€).Â  In the \r\n  case at bar, the named defendant and the UIM carrier must both be served with \r\n  the pleadings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) (â€œNo action may \r\n  be brought under the underinsured motorist provision unless copies of the pleadings \r\n  in the action establishing liability are served in the manner provided by law \r\n  upon the insurer writing the underinsured motorist provision.â€); Louden v. \r\n  Moragne, 327 S.C. 465, 486 S.E.2d 525 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding named defendant \r\n  in an action for benefits under a plaintiffâ€™s underinsured motorist policy must \r\n  be properly served with summons and complaint).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nMoreover, if an attorney-client relationship were \r\n  permitted in this instance, there exists a problem with dual representation.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the question becomes whether the UIM carrierâ€™s attorney can simultaneously \r\n  represent the insurance company and a named defendant who has no direct relationship \r\n  with the UIM carrier and whose interests are separate and distinct.Â  See \r\n  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 344, 499 S.E.2d 488, 494 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (â€œAn attorney who represents more than one client must be cognizant of \r\n  the vicissitudes of dual representation.Â  Dual representation is not per \r\n  se unethical, but raises a spectre of a violation of Rules 1.7 and 2.2 of \r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR.â€); \r\n  see Rule 1.7, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR (outlining rules prohibiting attorney \r\n  from representing client where there exists a conflict of interest).Â  \r\nB.\r\nAssuming arguendo that an attorney-client \r\n  relationship can be created between a UIM carrierâ€™s attorney and the named defendant, \r\n  Crawford asserts the attorney-client privilege could not be asserted under the \r\n  facts of this case. \r\nBrehmer specifically disclaimed the existence of \r\n  an attorney-client relationship.Â  He maintained Southern retained him to represent \r\n  its interest pursuant to section 38-77-160.Â Â  He also stated he had no right \r\n  to control Henderson.Â Â  Furthermore, other than Brehmerâ€™s appearance at Hendersonâ€™s \r\n  deposition and his claim that he conferred with Henderson prior to the deposition, \r\n  there is no evidence that Brehmer acted as Hendersonâ€™s legal advisor.Â  From \r\n  all indications, it seems that Brehmer appeared at the deposition in order to \r\n  represent Southernâ€™s interests.Â  Based on our review of the record, Brehmer \r\n  has not demonstrated that Henderson was his client.Â  See State v. \r\n  Love, 275 S.C. 55, 59, 271 S.E.2d 110, 112 (1980) (stating burden of establishing \r\n  attorney-client privilege is upon the person asserting it).Â  Even viewing the \r\n  situation from Hendersonâ€™s perspective, as Brehmer urges this Court to do, we \r\n  find no evidence that she had a reasonable belief or expectation that Brehmer \r\n  directly represented her. \r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the circuit \r\n  court erred in quashing Crawfordâ€™s subpoena to reconvene Hendersonâ€™s deposition.Â  \r\n  Because any communications between Brehmer and Henderson were not protected \r\n  by the attorney-client privilege, Crawford should have been permitted to question \r\n  her in this regard.Â  Accordingly, we remand for Crawford to take Hendersonâ€™s \r\n  deposition and, as a result, remand for a new trial.\r\nC.\r\nGiven our conclusion, we are cognizant \r\n  of the policy concerns presented by Southern.Â  Specifically, Southern asserts \r\n  an attorney-client privilege should necessarily be created because there must \r\n  be some level of confidentiality between an attorney for a UIM carrier and the \r\n  named defendant.Â  Without this protection, Southern claims a UIM carrierâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  ability to defend the case will be adversely affected.\r\nAs previously discussed, case law, statutes, \r\n  and ethical rules compel our holding that an attorney-client relationship is \r\n  not established between a UIM carrierâ€™s attorney and a named defendant.Â  Moreover, \r\n  to hold otherwise would effectively limit the benefits a plaintiff receives \r\n  from purchasing UIM coverage.\r\nTo avoid the predicament alleged by Southern, \r\n  it is incumbent upon a UIM carrierâ€™s attorney to inform the named defendant \r\n  of the parameters of his or her representation.Â  Specifically, the attorney \r\n  should emphasize that he or she directly represents the carrier and treat the \r\n  named defendant essentially as a witness.Â  We note that this procedure does \r\n  not leave the named defendant without direct representation. Contractually, \r\n  the named defendantâ€™s liability carrier remains obligated to the insured even \r\n  after the liability limits have been paid.Â  See Cobb v. Benjamin, \r\n  325 S.C. 573, 584, 482 S.E.2d 589, 594 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding the language \r\n  of section 38-77-160 â€œgiving the UIM carrier the right to assume control of \r\n  the defense for its own benefit is . . . consistent with the recognition that \r\n  the liability carrier who has paid its limits no longer has the same stake in \r\n  the outcome, even though the contractual obligation to its insured to defend \r\n  is ongoingâ€).\r\nII.Â  Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege\r\nEven assuming that Brehmer could assert \r\n  the attorney-client privilege, Crawford argues it was waived because he failed \r\n  to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 30(j) of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure. [5] \r\nRule 30(j), which governs the conduct \r\n  of counsel during depositions, provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\nCounsel shall not direct or request that a witness not answer \r\n  a question, unless that counsel has objected to the question on the ground that \r\n  the answer is protected by a privilege or a limitation on evidence directed \r\n  by the court or unless that counsel intends to present a motion under Rule 30(d), \r\n  SCRCP. In addition, counsel shall have an affirmative duty to inform a witness \r\n  that, unless such an objection is made, the question must be answered. Counsel \r\n  directing that a witness not answer a question on those grounds or allowing \r\n  a witness to refuse to answer a question on those grounds shall \r\n  move the court for a protective order under Rule 26(c), SCRCP, or 30(d), SCRCP, \r\n  within five business days of the suspension or termination of the deposition. \r\n  Failure to timely file such a motion will constitute waiver of the objection, \r\n  and the deposition may be reconvened.\r\n\r\nRule 30(j)(3), SCRCP (emphasis added). \r\nNeither Brehmer nor Henderson filed a \r\n  motion for a protective order within five business days of the termination of \r\n  the deposition.Â  Because the language of Rule 30(j)(3) is mandatory, any assertion \r\n  of the attorney-client privilege during the deposition was waived.Â  See \r\n  Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 470, 574 S.E.2d 739, 743 (2002) (â€œUnder \r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation, use of words such as â€˜shallâ€™ or â€˜mustâ€™ \r\n  indicates the legislatureâ€™s intent to enact a mandatory requirement.â€).Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nDespite the requirements \r\n  of Rule 30(j)(3), Brehmer argues and the circuit court agreed that Crawford \r\n  failed to sustain his burden to obtain a second deposition under Rule 30(a)(2), \r\n  which provides in relevant part, â€œThe deposition of any party or witness may \r\n  only be taken one time in any case except by agreement of the parties through \r\n  their counsel or by order of the court for good cause shown.â€Â  Rule 30(a)(2), \r\n  SCRCP.Â Â  Additionally, Brehmer contends Rules 30(a)(2) and 30(j)(3) are in conflict, \r\n  thus, Crawford still needed to comply with the requirements of Rule 30(a)(2).\r\nHowever, according to the language of Rule 30(j)(3), \r\n  Crawford was not required to subpoena the court for a second deposition but \r\n  was instead permitted to reconvene the first deposition.Â  Given the language \r\n  of Rule 30(j)(3) allows for the reconvening of the first deposition, it does \r\n  not conflict with the rules governing the procedure to obtain a second deposition \r\n  as specified under Rule 30(a)(2).\r\nFinally, Brehmer asserts Hendersonâ€™s deposition \r\n  should not be reconvened because Crawford allowed the first deposition to proceed \r\n  after the objection and did not call the trial judge to obtain an immediate \r\n  ruling.Â  Crawford, however, was not required to do so.Â  Rule 30(j)(3) requires \r\n  the party asserting the privilege to file the motion for a protective order \r\n  within five business days of either the suspension or termination of the deposition.Â  \r\n  The language of Rule 30(j)(3) specifying termination of the proceedings permits \r\n  the deposition to be concluded after its normal course.Â  Therefore, we find \r\n  the circuit court erred when it denied Crawford the right to reconvene Hendersonâ€™s \r\n  deposition.Â  Accordingly, we remand the case for a new trial after the conclusion \r\n  of the deposition.\r\nIII.Â  Expert Witness Testimony of Nurse Practitioner\r\nCrawford argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it permitted a nurse practitioner who treated Crawford to testify regarding \r\n  causation given Southern failed to establish the nurse was an expert for purposes \r\n  of rendering medical diagnoses. [6] \r\n  Â  \r\nAt trial, the parties disputed whether Crawfordâ€™s \r\n  injuries were caused by the accident or if the injuries were pre-existing from \r\n  an accident Crawford suffered at work.Â  Crawford testified his right shoulder \r\n  began to hurt approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after the accident on \r\n  April 3, 1998.Â  That night, Crawford went to the emergency room where he was \r\n  given a prescription for pain medication and a muscle relaxant.Â  Nine days later, \r\n  Crawford sought treatment for his shoulder at an urgent care center.Â  A few \r\n  days later, Crawford went to an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Postma.Â Â  Dr. Postma \r\n  prescribed physical therapy for Crawfordâ€™s shoulder. Â Shortly after his \r\n  last physical therapy appointment, Dr. Postma performed a shoulder manipulation \r\n  while Crawford was under anesthesia.Â  After the procedure, Crawford went to \r\n  a pain management center where Dr. Haasis gave Crawford cortisone shots.Â  In \r\n  his deposition, Dr. Haasis testified he believed Crawfordâ€™s injuries were secondary \r\n  to the automobile accident.Â  Crawford submitted medical bills in the \r\n  amount of $25,849.21.\r\nDuring his testimony, Crawford relayed that on \r\n  March 17, 1998, he was injured at work when his shirt got caught in a â€œmixer \r\n  machine.â€Â  As a result of the work-related accident, Crawford sustained injuries \r\n  that included abrasion burns on his right arm. Â He testified he planned \r\n  to return to work on Monday when the accident happened on the previous Friday.\r\nIn contrast, Henderson testified Crawford did not \r\n  show any signs of injuries.Â  She stated Crawford was upset and moving around \r\n  after the accident.\r\nSouthern presented the testimony of Victoria Smith, \r\n  a family nurse practitioner who treated Crawford.Â  Smith testified she saw Crawford \r\n  on July 29, 1997.Â  On that day, Crawford complained of pain in his right shoulder. \r\n  When questioned about the results of her physical examination of Crawford, Smith \r\n  opined that Crawford suffered from bursitis in his right shoulder.Â  Based \r\n  on this assessment, Smith prescribed medication and physical therapy.\r\nOn April 6, 1998, three days after the automobile \r\n  accident, Smith again saw Crawford.Â  On that day, Crawford complained of pain \r\n  in his right shoulder and upper arm.Â  Smith testified Crawford also told her \r\n  about the injuries he had sustained in the work-related accident.Â  Counsel \r\n  then asked Smith whether Crawford was suffering from bursitis that day.Â  Crawfordâ€™s \r\n  counsel objected to the question on the grounds that Smith was not a medical \r\n  doctor and, therefore, was not qualified to give a medical diagnosis.Â  The \r\n  judge overruled the objection.Â  Smith testified Crawford was not suffering from \r\n  bursitis, thus, implying Crawford was still experiencing the effects of the \r\n  work-related injury on that day. \r\nâ€œFor a court to find a witness competent \r\n  to testify as an expert, the witness must be better qualified than the jury \r\n  to form an opinion on the particular subject of the testimony.â€Â  Mizzell \r\n  v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 406, 570 S.E.2d 176, 183 (2002); see Rule \r\n  702, SCRE (â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist \r\n  the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, \r\n  a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, \r\n  or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nWhether to qualify a witness as an expert and admit \r\n  the expertâ€™s testimony is left to the discretion of the trial court and will \r\n  not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Payton v. Kearse, \r\n  329 S.C. 51, 60-61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211 (1998).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when the trial court commits an error of law or makes a factual conclusion without \r\n  evidentiary support.Â  Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 285, 457 S.E.2d 344, \r\n  345 (1995).\r\nIn support of his argument, Crawford cites \r\n  a case in which this Court held a physical therapist was not qualified to testify \r\n  regarding causation of the plaintiffâ€™s injuries.Â  Nelson v. Taylor, 347 \r\n  S.C. 210, 553 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â  Based on Nelson, Crawford \r\n  argues that nurse practitioners are also not statutorily authorized to make \r\n  medical diagnoses and should not be qualified as experts regarding medical diagnoses.\r\nIn Nelson, Pamela Nelson \r\n  (Nelson) and her husband brought a negligence action against Taylor for personal \r\n  injuries resulting from an automobile accident.Â  As a result of the accident, \r\n  Nelson complained of pain in her back, neck, head, and shoulder.Â  Nelson was \r\n  treated by her family physician, an orthopedic surgeon, a neurosurgeon, a shoulder \r\n  specialist, a chiropractor, and a physical therapist.Â  At trial, contradicting \r\n  theories emerged concerning the cause of Nelsonâ€™s injuries.Â  The physical therapist \r\n  concluded that Nelsonâ€™s injuries stemmed from her use of a mouse at her computer \r\n  workstation, resulting in rotator cuff tendonitis.Â  The shoulder specialist \r\n  disagreed finding Nelsonâ€™s injuries were caused by the automobile accident.Â  \r\n  He also ruled out rotator cuff tendonitis.Â  In a deposition, the orthopedic \r\n  surgeon found no evidence of shoulder impingement. Â The jury awarded Nelson \r\n  significantly less than what she offered as her medical expenses.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Nelson argued the trial judge \r\n  erred in admitting the physical therapistâ€™s deposition concerning the medical \r\n  cause of her injuries.Â  Nelson, 347 S.C. at 213, 553 S.E.2d at 489.Â  \r\n  During the physical therapistâ€™s deposition, Nelson had objected to the physical \r\n  therapistâ€™s diagnosis of her injuries because he was not a medical doctor and \r\n  had not reviewed Nelsonâ€™s medical records or diagnostic test results.Â  This \r\n  Court reversed the judgeâ€™s decision to admit the testimony.Â  Id. at 216-17, \r\n  553 S.E.2d at 491.Â  In reaching this conclusion, we reviewed the statutory scheme \r\n  created by the General Assembly to define and regulate the practice of physical \r\n  therapy.Â  Based on the controlling statutes, we determined that a physical therapist \r\n  is limited in terms of methods of treatment and is not authorized to practice \r\n  medicine, prescribe medications, or order medical laboratory tests.Â  Id. \r\n  at 215-16, 553 S.E.2d at 490-91.Â  In view of these statutory restrictions, we \r\n  held the physical therapist was not qualified to testify regarding causation.Â  \r\n  Id. at 216-17, 553 S.E.2d at 491.Â Â Â Â  \r\n Nelson is distinguishable from \r\n  the instant case.Â  First, as will be discussed, the statutory and regulatory \r\n  provisions governing the practice of nursing are significantly different from \r\n  those defining the parameters of physical therapy.Â  Secondly, the statute that \r\n  prohibits a physical therapist from practicing medicine specifically excludes \r\n  nurse practitioners from this limitation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-45-310 \r\n  (2001) (â€œNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict, inhibit, or \r\n  limit the practice of licensed nurse practitioners . . ..â€).\r\nAlthough the holding in Nelson \r\n  is not dispositive, it is, nevertheless, instructive for our analysis of the \r\n  issue presented in the instant case.Â  As in Nelson, we must review the \r\n  General Assemblyâ€™s statutory scheme regulating nurse practitioners.\r\nSection 40-33-10 defines several aspects \r\n  of nursing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-33-10 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2002).Â  Relevant to \r\n  this case are subsections (f) and (g), which define the practice of nursing \r\n  and the practice of professional nursing.Â Â  As provided in these subsections, \r\n  the process of nursing includes direct care and treatment services, which includes \r\n  the implementation of a physician-prescribed regimen as well as the assessment \r\n  and nursing diagnosis of health problems.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-33-10(f), (g) \r\n  (2001).Â  In addition to these responsibilities, a professional nurse â€œmay perform \r\n  additional acts in the extended role requiring special education and training \r\n  which are agreed to jointly by both the Board of Nursing and the Board of Medical \r\n  Examiners.Â  Those additional acts agreed to by both boards must be promulgated \r\n  by the Board of Nursing in its regulations.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-33-10 (g) \r\n  (2001). [7] \r\nTurning to the specifics of this case, \r\n  the role of a nurse practitioner is described in the regulations governing the \r\n  practice of nursing as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œNurse Practitionerâ€ means a registered nurse who has completed \r\n  a post-basic or advanced formal education program acceptable to the Board, and \r\n  who demonstrates advanced knowledge and skill in assessment and management of \r\n  physical and psychosocial health-illness status of individuals, and/or families, \r\n  and/or groups. Nurse practitioners who manage delegated medical aspects of care \r\n  must have a supervising physician and operate within the â€œapproved written protocols.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 91-2(d ) (Supp. 2002); see \r\n  26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 91-6(h)(1) (Supp. 2002) (â€œA Nurse Practitioner or Clinical \r\n  Nurse Specialist practicing in an extended role shall perform delegated medical \r\n  acts pursuant to an approved written protocol between the nurse and the physician.â€).\r\nThe regulations define the terms â€œdelegated \r\n  medical actsâ€ and â€œapproved written protocols.â€Â  â€œâ€˜Delegated Medical Actsâ€™ means \r\n  those additional acts delegated by the physician that include formulating a \r\n  medical diagnosis and initiating, continuing, and modifying therapies, \r\n  including prescribing drug therapy, under approved written protocols.â€Â  26 S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 91-1(c) (Supp. 2002) (emphasis added); see 26 S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Regs. 91-6(h)(2)(b) (Supp. 2002) (outlining at minimum information that \r\n  should be included as â€œdelegated medical actsâ€).Â  â€œâ€˜Approved Written Protocolsâ€™ \r\n  means specific statements developed collaboratively by the physician or the \r\n  medical staff and the nurse that establish physician delegation for medical \r\n  aspects of care, including the prescription of medications.â€Â  26 S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Regs. 91-2(g) (Supp. 2002).\r\nReading these statutory provisions and \r\n  regulations together, we find the General Assembly has authorized a nurse practitioner \r\n  to diagnose and treat medical conditions if a supervising physician has delegated \r\n  those acts pursuant to an approved written protocol.Â  Significantly, these provisions \r\n  expand the role of a nurse practitioner to provide a medical diagnosis in addition \r\n  to a nursing diagnosis.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-33-10(n) (2001) (defining \r\n  â€œnursing diagnosisâ€ as â€œa clinical judgment about an individual, family, or \r\n  community which is derived through a nursing assessmentâ€); Flanagan v. Labe, \r\n  690 A.2d 183 (Pa. 1997) (recognizing distinction between a nursing diagnosis \r\n  and medical diagnosis); Id. at 186 (â€œ[A] nursing diagnosis identifies \r\n  signs and symptoms to the extent necessary to carry out the nursing regime.Â  \r\n  It does not, however, make final conclusions about the identity and cause of \r\n  the underlying disease.â€); cf. Newbern v. State, No. 02-C-01-9106-CR00143, \r\n  1992 WL 124459 at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 10, 1992) (holding a nurse practitioner \r\n  could testify as expert in rape trial given â€œa nurse practitioner, unlike the \r\n  average nurse, can make diagnoses like a doctor and can prescribe non-narcotic \r\n  medicationâ€).Â  \r\nTurning to the instant case, we must examine the \r\n  record to see if there is any evidence supporting Smithâ€™s ability to conduct \r\n  medical diagnoses of patients.Â  Southernâ€™s attorney asked Smith to describe \r\n  the duties of a nurse practitioner.Â  She responded:\r\n\r\nNurse practitioners are performing delegated medical acts, \r\n  and that is a collaborative agreement between the physician and the nurse practitioner \r\n  as to what she can perform, what she feels comfortable in doing, what sheâ€™s \r\n  been educated to do, and what [the physician] feels comfortable delegating to \r\n  her.Â  So, it varies from one practice to another what services nurse practitioners \r\n  performs [sic].Â  \r\n\r\nIn addition to this testimony, we note \r\n  Smith had diagnosed Crawford prior to the accident as having bursitis in his \r\n  shoulder.Â  She treated him and prescribed medication and physical therapy.Â  \r\n  From this testimony, the judge could reasonably infer that a physician had delegated \r\n  to Smith the power to diagnose.Â  \r\nCrawford, however, asserts that because the requisite \r\n  â€œwritten protocolâ€ was not offered into evidence by Southern it was error to \r\n  permit Smith to testify regarding causation.Â  We find this argument is not preserved \r\n  for our review.Â  First, it was not presented to the trial judge when Crawford \r\n  objected to Smithâ€™s testimony.Â  Â See Wilder Corp. v. \r\n  Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that \r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); \r\n  see also State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5-6, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 \r\n  (1989) (stating a party may not argue one ground at trial and then an alternative \r\n  ground on appeal).Â  Secondly, Crawford raised this specific argument for the \r\n  first time in his reply brief.Â Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. United States \r\n  Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 692 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001), cert. denied (July 10, 2002) (finding that appellant could not \r\n  raise additional arguments in reply brief because it was not addressed in initial \r\n  brief); Lister v. NationsBank, 329 S.C. 133, 153, 494 S.E.2d 449, 460 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997) (stating a point raised for the first time in a reply brief \r\n  will not be considered by appellate court).Â  Accordingly, we find the judge \r\n  did not abuse his discretion in permitting Smith to testify regarding her diagnosis \r\n  of Crawfordâ€™s injury.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the future, we believe the party presenting \r\n  a nurse practitioner as a witness should offer a copy of the â€œapproved written \r\n  protocolâ€ into evidence in order to clarify the exact medical acts the physician \r\n  delegated to the nurse practitioner.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAn attorney-client relationship is not \r\n  created between a UIM carrierâ€™s attorney and the named defendant.Â  In the absence \r\n  of this relationship, a UIM carrierâ€™s attorney may not assert the attorney-client \r\n  privilege to protect communications between he and the named insured.Â  Even \r\n  if an attorney-client privilege could be asserted, this privilege may be waived \r\n  if the attorney fails to file for a motion for a protective order pursuant to \r\n  Rule 30(j)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Finally, a nurse \r\n  practitioner may testify regarding causation if a physician has delegated the \r\n  requisite medical acts to the nurse practitioner in â€œapproved written protocol.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the courtâ€™s decision \r\n  quashing Crawfordâ€™s motion to reconvene Hendersonâ€™s deposition and remand the \r\n  case for a new trial.Â  We affirm the decision of the court permitting the nurse \r\n  practitioner to testify regarding the cause of Crawfordâ€™s injuries.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  Rule 26(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n    Procedure provides in pertinent part:Â  \r\n  \r\n  Upon motion by a party \r\n    or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, \r\n    the court in which the action is pending or alternatively, on matters relating \r\n    to a deposition, the court in the circuit where the deposition is to be taken \r\n    may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from \r\n    annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden by expense, including \r\n    one or more of the following:Â  (1) that the discovery not be had;Â  (2) that \r\n    the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including \r\n    a designation of the time or place; (3) that the discovery may be had only \r\n    by a method of discovery other than selected by the party seeking discovery;Â  \r\n    (4) that certain matters not be inquired into or that the scope of the discovery \r\n    be limited to certain matters; (5) that discovery be conducted with no one \r\n    present except persons designated by the court . . .. \r\n  \r\n  Rule 26(c), SCRCP.\r\n  Rule 30(a)(2) states in \r\n    relevant part, â€œThe deposition of any party or witness may only be taken one \r\n    time in any case except by agreement of the parties through their counsel \r\n    or by order of the court for good cause shown.â€ Rule 30(a)(2), SCRCP.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â Â  Wilson is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Section 38-77-160 provides in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\n  No action may be brought under the underinsured motorist \r\n    provision unless copies of the pleadings in the action establishing liability \r\n    are served in the manner provided by law upon the insurer writing the underinsured \r\n    motorist provision.Â  The insurer has the right to appear and defend in the \r\n    name of the underinsured motorist in any action which may affect its liability \r\n    and has thirty days after service of process on it in which to appear.Â  The \r\n    evidence of service upon the insurer may not be made a part of the record.Â  \r\n    In the event the automobile insurance insurer for the putative at-fault insured \r\n    chooses to settle in part the claims against its insured by payment of its \r\n    applicable liability limits on behalf of its insured, the underinsured motorist \r\n    insurer may assume control of the defense of action for its own benefit.Â  \r\n    No underinsured motorist policy may contain a clause requiring the insurerâ€™s \r\n    consent to settlement with the at-fault party.\r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  Because there \r\n    have been no substantive amendments made to this statute since the Broome \r\n    decision, we cite to the most current version of the statute.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  We note that although Henderson is the named Respondent, the Respondentâ€™s \r\n    brief was filed on behalf of Southernâ€™s interests.Â  Therefore, we refer to \r\n    Southern and Brehmer, Southernâ€™s attorney, throughout our discussion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] Â Â  In light of our holding that an attorney-client relationship is \r\n    not created, we need not address this argument.Â  However, because Rule 30(j) \r\n    is relatively new with limited application, we decide to analyze this issue.Â  \r\n    Moreover, it provides additional support for our conclusion that the circuit \r\n    court erred in denying Crawfordâ€™s right to thoroughly depose Henderson.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â  Based on our decision to reconvene Hendersonâ€™s deposition, which \r\n    will inevitably precipitate a new trial, we need not address Crawfordâ€™s remaining \r\n    issue.Â  However, because this issue may arise during a second trial, we decide \r\n    it for the benefit of the parties.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Â Â  Subsection (f) provides:\r\n  \r\n  â€œPractice of nursingâ€ means \r\n    the provision of services for compensation that assist individuals and groups \r\n    to obtain or maintain optimal health.Â  Nursing practice is commensurate with \r\n    the educational preparation and demonstrated competencies of the individual \r\n    who is accountable to the public for the quality of nursing care.Â  Nursing \r\n    practice includes the provision of direct care and treatment services including \r\n    the implementation of a medical regimen as authorized and prescribed by a \r\n    licensed physician, dentist, or other person authorized by law, teaching, \r\n    counseling, administration, research, consultation, supervision, delegation, \r\n    and evaluation of practice.Â  Nursing process includes the assessment and nursing \r\n    diagnosis of human responses to actual or potential health problems and the \r\n    planning, intervention, and evaluation of care in the promotion and maintenance \r\n    of health, the casefinding and nursing management of illness, injury, or infirmity, \r\n    the restoration of optimum function, or the achievement of a dignified death. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-33-10(f) (2001).\r\n  Â Â Â  Subsection (g) provides:\r\n  \r\n  â€œPractice of professional \r\n    nursingâ€ means the performance for compensation of any acts in the health \r\n    care process involving the process of assessment, intervention, and evaluation.Â  \r\n    This process includes observation, care, and counsel of the ill, injured, \r\n    infirm, the promotion and maintenance of health, the administration of medications, \r\n    and treatments as authorized and prescribed by a licensed physician or a licensed \r\n    dentist.Â  The application of the nursing process requires substantial specialized \r\n    independent judgment and skill and is based on knowledge and application of \r\n    the principles of biophysical and social sciences.Â  The practice of professional \r\n    nursing includes the teaching and administration, supervision, delegation, \r\n    and evaluation of nursing practice.Â  A professional nurse may perform additional \r\n    acts in the extended role requiring special education and training which are \r\n    agreed to jointly by both the Board of Nursing and the Board of Medical Examiners.Â  \r\n    Those additional acts agreed to by both boards must be promulgated by the \r\n    Board of Nursing in its regulations.\r\n  \r\n  S.C.

Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3695\r\nSubmitted October 10, 2003 â€“ Filed November \r\n  17, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDaniel W. Luginbill, of Bamberg, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Stephen Hutto appeals the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion to reconsider sentencing.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nHutto and another juvenile escaped from the Department \r\n  of Juvenile Justiceâ€™s Rimini Marine Institute, killing a supervisor on their \r\n  work detail in the process.Â  The pair then continued on a crime spree spanning \r\n  multiple counties.Â  Hutto entered into a plea agreement with the State, agreeing \r\n  to plead guilty on numerous charges including murder.Â  The agreement provided \r\n  Hutto would receive maximum concurrent sentences on all charges except the murder \r\n  charge, with sentencing on that charge left to the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion.\r\nThis arrangement allowed the defense to argue Hutto should receive thirty \r\n  years for murder and for the State to argue he should receive life without parole. \r\n\r\nThe court accepted Huttoâ€™s pleas and postponed \r\n  sentencing for thirty days to allow the defense time to prepare arguments regarding \r\n  mitigation.Â  When the court reconvened for sentencing it heard arguments and \r\n  testimony from each side.Â  The State submitted a statement from a jailhouse \r\n  informant who advised police that Hutto admitted after the crimes that he planned \r\n  the killing and escape two days before the plan was carried out.Â  The informantâ€™s \r\n  statement also described details of the murder.Â  \r\nThe State also relayed interviews with two juveniles \r\n  who were housed at Rimini with Hutto.Â  The first discussed seeing Hutto and \r\n  his co-defendant view a map and hearing them discuss locations in Bamberg and \r\n  Greenville.Â  This juvenile alleged Huttoâ€™s co-defendant challenged Hutto by \r\n  taunting, â€œI donâ€™t believe you got the guts to do it.â€Â  \r\nThe second juvenile corroborated the first juvenileâ€™s \r\n  statement regarding the map.Â  The second juvenile also stated Hutto and his \r\n  co-defendant had told the victim they could kill him, steal his truck, and escape \r\n  the Institute.Â  Huttoâ€™s co-defendant also testified concerning the crimes. \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the court sentenced \r\n  Hutto to life without parole for murder.Â  Pursuant to his plea agreement, Hutto \r\n  received maximum concurrent sentences on the other charges.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Solicitorâ€™s Comment\r\nHutto asserts that prior to the beginning of the \r\n  sentencing hearing one of the solicitors approached the van where Hutto was \r\n  awaiting transport into the courtroom and told the guards, â€œdonâ€™t be in a hurry \r\n  because itâ€™s a sure thing he will be going back with you with a life sentence.â€Â  \r\n  Hutto asserts the statement deprived him of due process by intimidating him \r\n  from assisting in his own defense. \r\nTraditionally the relevant question to ask in â€œsolicitor \r\n  commentâ€ cases is whether the comments so infected the trial with unfairness \r\n  as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  Donnelly v. \r\n  DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637 (1974).Â  We have been unable to find another \r\n  court that has found a denial of due process where the solicitorâ€™s comments \r\n  were uttered to third parties who were not on a jury, but the comments were \r\n  overheard by a defendant.Â  \r\nChallenges alleging prosecutorial misconduct typically \r\n  involve a prosecutorâ€™s improper efforts to collect evidence or unfair trial \r\n  tactics.Â  See, e.g., State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, \r\n  527 S.E.2d 105 (2000) (assistant solicitor viewed the surreptitious videotaping \r\n  of privileged attorney-client communication); State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. \r\n  103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997) (prosecutor discussed matters outside of the evidence \r\n  during closing arguments); State v. Chisolm, 312 S.C. 235, 439 S.E.2d \r\n  850 (1994) (prosecutor improperly audiotaped telephone conversation with defendant, \r\n  who was represented by counsel); State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 \r\n  S.E.2d 404 (1991) (prosecutor allegedly used previously suppressed evidence \r\n  at trial); State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990) (prosecutor \r\n  allegedly obtained confidential medical records in violation of attorney-client \r\n  privilege); State v. Pee Dee News Co., 286 S.C. 562, 336 S.E.2d 8 (1985) \r\n  (prosecutor asked improper questions at trial); State v. Craig, 267 S.C. \r\n  262, 227 S.E.2d 306 (1976) (prosecutorâ€™s conduct at trial allegedly was calculated \r\n  to arouse unfair prejudice against defendant).Â  \r\nBecause Huttoâ€™s claim appears to be novel, counsel \r\n  attempts to analogize the circumstances to the more typical case where a prosecutor \r\n  makes improper statements before a jury.Â  We do not accept the comparison.Â  \r\n  Our judicial system prohibits such comments because they urge the jury to base \r\n  its verdict on something other than the evidence.Â  Such a rationale is not warranted \r\n  in the present case.Â  \r\nEven if the solicitor made the alleged comments, \r\n  they did not abrogate Huttoâ€™s due process rights in the same manner as would \r\n  comments to a jury.Â  The comment was directed not to Hutto but to law enforcement.Â  \r\n  Because the solicitor had already stated in open court that he intended to seek \r\n  life without parole, it is unclear how the statement could have hampered Huttoâ€™s \r\n  efforts to seek the courtâ€™s mercy in its sentence. Â Although Huttoâ€™s \r\n  mother stated in her affidavit that she thought the solicitorâ€™s comment kept \r\n  Hutto from testifying at the sentencing hearing, Hutto has offered no similar \r\n  claim.\r\nWe reject Huttoâ€™s contention that the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  statements denied him due process. \r\n  [2] \r\nII.Â  Inadmissibility of Evidence \r\n  During Sentencing\r\nHutto also argues the trial court should not have \r\n  allowed the solicitor to introduce the out-of-court statements of the jailhouse \r\n  informant and the two juvenile residents of the Rimini facility as the prejudicial \r\n  impact of the statements outweighed any probative value.Â  See Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.\r\nWe are not concerned with balancing prejudicial \r\n  impact with probative value when reviewing evidence used in the sentencing phase \r\n  of a non-capital crime because evidentiary rules are inapplicable in a sentencing \r\n  proceeding.Â  Rule 1101(d)(3), SCRE; State v. Gulledge, 326 S.C. 220, \r\n  228-29, 487 S.E.2d 590, 594 (1997); see also Williams v. New \r\n  York, 337 U.S. 241 (1949).Â  In sentencing a convicted defendant a trial \r\n  court is only limited by constitutional provisions that require the evidence \r\n  to be relevant, reliable and trustworthy.Â  See Gulledge, supra.\r\nThe court stated in its order denying resentencing \r\n  it took into account the statements were those of convicted criminals whose \r\n  credibility was not wholly reliable.Â  However, the court noted the statements \r\n  were corroborated by both the physical facts of the crime and similar statements \r\n  by Huttoâ€™s co-defendant.Â  The court reasoned â€œ[i]t would have been impossible \r\n  for the jailhouse informant to fabricate the conversations which he had with \r\n  [Hutto] so as to mirror almost exactly portions of the testimony given by [Huttoâ€™s \r\n  co-defendant].â€Â  \r\nIn short, the trial court properly considered the \r\n  challenged statements because they were corroborated. The statements were both \r\n  relevant and reliable.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] &nbsp;&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to \r\n    Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] &nbsp;&nbsp; Huttoâ€™s counsel alludes to a violation of the Rules \r\n    of Professional Conduct when he suggests the solicitorâ€™s comments were directed \r\n    towards a defendant represented by counsel out of counselâ€™s presence.Â  See \r\n    Rule 407, SCACR, Rule 4.2, RPC (â€œ[A] lawyer shall not communicate about the \r\n    subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented \r\n    by another lawyer in the matter . . . .â€).Â  Huttoâ€™s allegation is not that \r\n    the solicitor attempted to converse with him about the case outside the presence \r\n    of counsel.Â  Instead, Hutto alleges he overheard a conversation between the \r\n    solicitor and other law enforcement.Â  We fail to see how even a liberal application \r\n    of the rule would prohibit such comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3696","title":"Goodwin v.

Goodwin and Fonda E. Goodwin (the Goodwins) appeal \r\n  the master-in-equityâ€™s order relocating their easement by necessity.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Goodwins originally brought this cause of action against \r\n  Martha and Ernie Johnson (the Johnsons) on December 18, 1996, in an effort to \r\n  establish an easement across the Johnsonsâ€™ property.Â  The disputed property \r\n  consisted of a road that ran from a public highway through the Johnsonsâ€™ property \r\n  to the Goodwinsâ€™ property.Â  The Goodwins argued they were entitled to the easement \r\n  under several theories, including: (1) an easement by a recorded document; (2) \r\n  an easement by necessity; and (3) an easement by public dedication.\r\n After hearing from the parties, the master granted \r\n  the Goodwins an easement by necessity and an easement by prescription.Â  The \r\n  master found the location of the easement or road was as set forth in a plat \r\n  recorded in the Recorder of Deeds Office in Berkeley County.\r\nThe Johnsons appealed the masterâ€™s finding to the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\n  An opinion was issued on June 19, 2001.Â  See Goodwin v. Johnson, \r\n  Op. No. 2001-UP-323 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 19, 2001). Â This Court \r\n  affirmed the masterâ€™s decision by finding there was evidence in the record to \r\n  support his determination that an easement by necessity existed.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  We declined to address further grounds.Â \r\nFollowing our decision, the Johnsons moved to clarify the \r\n  masterâ€™s order and the Goodwins asked permission to execute on the judgment.Â  \r\n  The Johnsons desired to relocate the easement from its current location \r\n  to another part of their property due to its proximity to their home and dangers \r\n  it created for their children and pets.Â  The Goodwins claimed that relocating \r\n  the easement would make it both unsafe and unusable, as it would no longer link \r\n  with a passable portion of their property.Â \r\nIn an order dated June 18, 2002, the master granted the Johnsonsâ€™ \r\n  request and ordered the construction of a new road along the side of the Johnsonsâ€™ \r\n  property.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes a court of equity possess the plenary \r\n  power\r\nto relocate an existing easement by \r\n  necessity? \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in \r\n  a law action and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by \r\n  a judge without a jury.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 496 S.E.2d 633 \r\n  (1998); Pittman v. Lowther, 355 S.C. 536, 586 S.E.2d 149 (Ct. App. 2003); \r\n  Revis v. Barrett, 321 S.C. 206, 467 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 1996); Smith \r\n  v. Commissioners of Pub. Works, 312 S.C. 460, 441 S.E.2d 331 (Ct. App. 1994); \r\n  see also Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 357 S.E.2d 710 (1987) \r\n  (decision of trier of fact as to whether or not easement exists will be reviewed \r\n  by Supreme Court as an action at law); Hartley v. John Wesley United Methodist \r\n  Church, 355 S.C. 145, 584 S.E.2d 386 (Ct. App. 2003) (determination of existence \r\n  of easement is action at law; establishing existence of easement is question \r\n  of fact in law action).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is no evidence \r\n  to support the judgeâ€™s finding.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\nThe question of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in equity.Â  \r\n  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997); Lighthouse \r\n  Tennis Club Village Horizontal Property Regime LXVI v. South Island Pub. Serv. \r\n  Dist., 355 S.C. 529, 586 S.E.2d 146 (Ct. App. 2003); Eldridge v. City \r\n  of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 503 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 1998); Smith, \r\n  312 S.C. at 465, 441 S.E.2d at 334.Â  â€œThus, this Court may take its own view \r\n  of the evidence.â€Â  Tupper, 326 S.C. at 323, 487 S.E.2d at 190; see \r\n  also Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist., 348 S.C. \r\n  58, 558 S.E.2d 902 (Ct. App. 2001) (scope of easement is equitable matter in \r\n  which reviewing court may take its own view of preponderance of evidence).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Goodwins contend the master did not have the authority to move \r\n  an existing easement, or alternatively, even if he did have the authority, the \r\n  master erred in doing so under the facts of this particular case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe issue asseverated in this case is novel.Â  Irrefutably, the question \r\n  presented is of particular importance to trial courts.\r\nThe traditional rule concerning easements is that â€œthe location of \r\n  an easement once selected or fixed cannot be changed by either the landowner \r\n  or the easement owner without the otherâ€™s consent, which can be express or implied.â€Â  \r\n  25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 79 (1996) (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\n  Thus, â€œ[a]fter a way has been located, it cannot be changed by either party \r\n  without the consent of the other, even if the way so located becomes detrimental \r\n  to the use and convenience of the servient estate.â€Â  Id.; see also \r\n  Samuelson v. Alvarado, 847 S.W.2d 319, 323 (Tex. Ct. App. 1993) (â€œOnce \r\n  established, the location of the easement cannot be changed by either the easement \r\n  owner or the servient owner without the consent of both parties, even though \r\n  the use of the easement where located becomes detrimental to the use of the \r\n  servient estate.â€); 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 157 (1996) (â€œAs a general \r\n  rule, in the absence of statutes to the contrary, the location of an easement \r\n  cannot be changed by either party without the otherâ€™s consent, after it has \r\n  been once established either by the express terms of the grant or by the acts \r\n  of the parties, except under the authority of an express or implied grant or \r\n  reservation to this effect.â€) (footnotes omitted); F.M. English, Annotation, \r\n  Relocation of Easements, 80 A.L.R. 2d 743 Â§ 4 (1961) (â€œLanguage is frequently \r\n  found in the cases to the general effect that an easement, once located, cannot \r\n  be relocated without the consent of the parties thereto.â€).\r\nAlthough South Carolina courts have yet to address this particular \r\n  issue, the Goodwins cite several cases from other jurisdictions in support of \r\n  the traditional rule regarding easements, including MacMeekin v. Low Income \r\n  Hous. Inst., Inc., 45 P.3d 570 (Wash. Ct. App. 2002), and Soderberg v. \r\n  Weisel, 687 A.2d 839 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1997).Â  In MacMeekin, an action \r\n  to quiet title to an easement, the Court of Appeals of Washington was confronted \r\n  with the issue of whether a court had the power to relocate an existing easement \r\n  by prescription without the permission of the owner of the dominant estate.Â  \r\n  After reviewing cases from other jurisdictions, the court decided: â€œWashington \r\n  adheres to the traditional rule that easements, however created, are \r\n  property rights, and as such are not subject to relocation absent the consent \r\n  of both parties.â€Â  MacMeekin, 45 P.3d at 579 (emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n Soderberg, while acknowledging the general rule, ultimately \r\n  adopted a position inconsistent with that championed by the Goodwins.Â  See \r\n  Soderberg, 687 A.2d at 842.Â  In that case, the owners of the servient \r\n  parcel brought an action against the owners of the dominant parcel seeking to \r\n  quiet title or, in the alternative, to relocate an easement that was established \r\n  by prescription.Â  The easement in issue was a road in close proximity to the \r\n  servient ownerâ€™s home that posed dangers to their small children.Â  Id. \r\n  at 841.Â  In contrast to MacMeekin, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania \r\n  adopted the minority rule, holding â€œa court may compel relocation of an easement \r\n  if that relocation would not substantially interfere with the easement holderâ€™s \r\n  use and enjoyment of the right of way and it advances the interest of justice.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 844.\r\nMany of the cases adopting the traditional rule deal with express \r\n  easementsâ€”not with easements created by necessity.Â  We recognize that it should \r\n  be more difficult to relocate an express easement, as it is akin to a \r\n  contract and is bargained for by the parties.Â  MacMeekin, cited by the \r\n  Goodwins for the traditional approach, supports this position by acknowledging \r\n  that most of the cases addressing the issue of whether a court can relocate \r\n  an easement without the consent of both parties deal with express easements.Â  \r\n  MacMeekin, 45 P.3d at 575-76.\r\nBefore adopting the minority view, the Soderberg court explained:\r\n\r\nPrescriptive easements are . . . quite different from express \r\n  grant easements.Â  Express grant easements, once acquired, are much more difficult \r\n  to alter.Â  A prescriptive easement, however, differs markedly from an express \r\n  grant easement, because the prescriptive easement is not fixed by agreement \r\n  between the parties or their predecessors in interest.\r\n\r\nSoderberg, 687 A.2d at 843 n.3 (citation omitted).Â  The court further \r\n  expounded that â€œalterations of easements expressly granted will be interpreted \r\n  under contract law principles; permission to alter must be intended by words \r\n  or meaning of grant.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  The court found prescriptive \r\n  easements, because they are not fixed by agreement among the parties, should \r\n  be handled differently than express easements.Â  Id.Â  We agree with this \r\n  reasoning and conclude the same is true with easements created by necessity.\r\nThe approach adopted by the Soderberg court is consonant with \r\n  the position adopted by the drafters of the Restatement (Third) of Property: \r\n  Servitudes Â§ 4.8 (2000), which provides that, in certain situations, the owner \r\n  of the servient estate can relocate an easement unilaterally.Â  Section 4.8 of \r\n  the Restatement reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nExcept where the location and dimensions are determined by the instrument or \r\n  circumstances surrounding creation of a servitude, they are determined as follows:\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n(3)Â  Unless expressly denied by the terms of an easement, . . .Â  the owner of \r\n  the servient estate is entitled to make reasonable changes in the location or \r\n  dimensions of an easement, at the servient ownerâ€™s expense, to permit normal \r\n  use or development of the servient estate, but only if the changes do not\r\n  \r\n(a) significantly lessen the utility of the easement,\r\n(b) increase the burdens on the owner of the easement in its use and enjoyment, \r\n  or\r\n(c) frustrate the purpose for which the easement was created.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId.\r\nAuthority exists specifically supporting the power of a court sitting \r\n  in equity to relocate easements created by necessity.Â  See William B. \r\n  Johnson, Annotation, Locating Easement of Way Created by Necessity, 36 \r\n  A.L.R. 4th 764 Â§ 2 (1985) (once an easement by necessityâ€™s location has been \r\n  fixed, it cannot be changed except by agreement of the parties or by a court \r\n  for equitable reasons).Â  The Court of Appeals of Maryland addressed this \r\n  issue in Hancock v. Henderson, 202 A.2d 599 (Md. 1964).Â  In that case, \r\n  current owners of a dominant estate brought an action to prevent the servient \r\n  owners from obstructing a claimed right-of-way.Â  Id. at 600.Â  The court \r\n  found the dominant owners were entitled to an easement by necessity for the \r\n  purpose of ingress and egress to and from their land.Â  Id. at 603.Â  Although \r\n  a road was located on the servient estate in the past for this purpose, the \r\n  road had fallen into disrepair and there was evidence it had not been used for \r\n  many years.Â  Id.Â  The court articulated: â€œWe do not think this slight \r\n  activity so long ago was sufficient to establish with exactitude the location \r\n  of an easement claimed now by a remote grantee of the dominant tract.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Because the current location of the road was located in such a way as to be \r\n  considerably inconvenient to the servient owner and the uses of the respective \r\n  properties had changed over the years, the court remanded the case to the trial \r\n  court for an equitable determination of where the easement should be located.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Although on remand the parties had the option of working out a location \r\n  on their own, the appellate court stated that in the absence of agreement, the \r\n  trial court â€œshould exercise jurisdiction in locating an adequate right of way \r\n  over the servient tenement in a manner so as to permit ingress and egress of \r\n  vehicular traffic, but also in a manner least burdensome to the servient tenement.â€Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nIn Michael v. Needham, 384 A.2d 473 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1978), after \r\n  determining that the dominant owner was entitled to an easement by necessity, \r\n  the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland concluded that because the servient \r\n  owner had expended a considerable amount of funds in making improvements to \r\n  his property in the vicinity where the easement was claimed to lie, the case \r\n  should be remanded to determine the best location for the easement.Â  Id. \r\n  at 479.Â  As in Hancock, the court held that, in the absence of agreement \r\n  among the parties, â€œit will be the responsibility of the chancellor to take \r\n  such testimony as might be required and to locate the right of way after due \r\n  consideration of the equities of the matter.â€Â  Id.\r\nSignificantly, the facts surrounding \r\n  the current dispute are remarkably similar to those discussed in Hancock.Â  \r\n  Both concern easements created by necessity and relate to roads that were commonly \r\n  used at one time but had since fallen into disrepair.Â  Hancock, 202 A.2d \r\n  at 603.Â  In Hancock, the old road dissected the servient ownerâ€™s property; \r\n  whereas, in this case the old road comes within ten feet of the Johnsonsâ€™ home.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Additionally, the Goodwins testified they have never used the old \r\n  road to access their property. It is clear from the testimony presented at trial \r\n  that the Goodwins were aware when they bought the property that there may be \r\n  problems obtaining access. Finally, as in Hancock, the use to which the \r\n  servient land was put has changed since the prior road was used as a way to \r\n  access the property purchased by the Goodwins.Â  In the past, the land was farmland.Â  \r\n  Currently, the land serves as the Johnson home.\r\nThe factors articulated by the drafters of the Restatement provide \r\n  excellent guidance to courts of equity when faced with the task of relocating \r\n  an easement created by necessity.Â  A court using its equity powers may relocate \r\n  an easement when the relocation will not â€œ(a) significantly lessen the utility \r\n  of the easement, (b) increase the burdens on the owner of the easement in its \r\n  use and enjoyment, or (c) frustrate the purpose for which the easement was created.â€Â  \r\n  Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes Â§ 4.8.\r\nIndubitably, a relocation \r\n  of the easement in question will not significantly lessen its utility.Â  The \r\n  Goodwins have never used the old road.Â  Although Mrs. Goodwin testified they \r\n  planned on building a house on the land, they have yet to do so and it remains \r\n  undeveloped property.Â  Relocation of the easement could not increase the burden \r\n  on the Goodwins because they have never used any easement through the Johnsonsâ€™ \r\n  property.Â  Finally, relocation of the easement will not frustrate the purpose \r\n  for which the easement was created.Â  The easement was created so the Goodwins \r\n  would have a way into and out of their property.Â  The masterâ€™s order establishing \r\n  the new road mandated that it be constructed to South Carolina Department of \r\n  Transportation standards completely at the Johnsonsâ€™ expense.\r\nThe Goodwins maintain \r\n  they will be burdened by the masterâ€™s location of the new road.Â  They allege \r\n  the new road will not link up with a passable portion of their property and \r\n  the new road meets the public highway in such a way that it is unsafe when entering \r\n  and exiting.Â  Frankly, there is no evidence in the record to support these assertions.Â  \r\n  While it may be true that relocation of the road will prevent it from linking \r\n  with the old road on the Goodwinsâ€™ property, because the property at this point \r\n  is nothing more than an undeveloped lot, we fail to see how this significantly \r\n  burdens the Goodwins.Â  Because the master mandated that the new road meet requirements \r\n  imposed by the South Carolina Department of Transportation, and there is no \r\n  evidence in the record to support the Goodwinsâ€™ contention that the entrance \r\n  of the new road will be unsafe, we agree with the masterâ€™s decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe align South Carolina \r\n  with those jurisdictions providing that courts of equity have the power to relocate \r\n  existing easements created by necessity.Â  We adopt the minority rule that a \r\n  court of equity possesses the plenary power to relocate an easement by necessity \r\n  when the evidence supports such a move.\r\nAccordingly, the master-in-equityâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3697","title":"State v.

Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, \r\n  J.:Â  Appellant, Eddie Fields, was indicted by a Charleston County grand \r\n  jury for criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the first degree and kidnapping. [1] Â  At the close of evidence defense counsel requested, \r\n  but was denied, an instruction on assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature (ABHAN).Â  Following a jury trial, Fields was convicted of CSC in the \r\n  first degree and sentenced by the trial judge to thirty years in prison.Â  Fields \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on ABHAN.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\nThe victim, a seventeen-year-old \r\n  high school student, testified that around 5:30 p.m. on February 2, 1999, she \r\n  walked to the library to return a book.Â  On her way there, she ran into one \r\n  of her friends, and agreed she would meet her friend at a local restaurant on \r\n  her way back from the library.Â  As she continued toward the library, she encountered \r\n  Fields, who started a conversation with her as he walked alongside the victim.Â  \r\n  Fields asked the victim if she had a boyfriend, to which she replied that she \r\n  did.Â  The victim then ran into two other friends on the street, but because \r\n  she felt safe at the time, she did not tell these friends there was anything \r\n  wrong.Â  As Fields and the victim walked on toward the library, Fields asked \r\n  her if she wanted a â€œstud for the night.â€Â  The victim replied that she did not, \r\n  and that she had a boyfriend.Â  Shortly after this conversation, they arrived \r\n  at the library.Â  The victim did not go inside, but instead returned her book \r\n  in the library drop box, because she planned to go meet her friend at the restaurant.Â  \r\n  \r\nUpon leaving the library, Fields \r\n  asked the victim if she would like to get a beer with him.Â  The victim did not \r\n  want to, but after Fields persisted for some time, she finally agreed.Â  She \r\n  stated she did not refuse the offer, because she was not good at confronting \r\n  people or being mean to them.Â  Fields indicated that the victim could â€œjust \r\n  have one beer with [him],â€ and then she would be able to leave.Â  A short time \r\n  later, as the two walked into an area unfamiliar to the victim, she told Fields \r\n  she was not going with him because she had to go meet her friend.Â  At this point, \r\n  Fields grabbed the victimâ€™s arm and kept threatening he would â€œcut [her] upâ€ \r\n  with a knife if she attempted to leave.Â  He also told her he knew everyone in \r\n  the neighborhood.Â  The victim did not believe she would be able to get away \r\n  from Fields, so she continued on with him.Â  \r\nAs the two got to a grocery store, \r\n  the victim noticed a group of men on the corner at the store.Â  Fields said he \r\n  was going in the store for a minute, and then walked over to the men and spoke \r\n  to them.Â  By the way Fields was talking to them and the way the men were looking \r\n  at her, she believed Fields was instructing the men to make sure she did not \r\n  leave.Â  Fields entered the store leaving the victim outside.Â  After exiting \r\n  the store, Fields led the victim to an abandoned house.Â  Although the victim \r\n  stated that she did not want to enter the house, Fields forcefully pulled her \r\n  onto the porch and then threw her into a door and onto the floor of the house.Â  \r\n  \r\nOnce inside, Fields picked the victim \r\n  up off the floor and grabbed her around the neck, putting her in a headlock.Â  \r\n  He threatened to â€œcut [her] upâ€ if she was not quiet.Â  He pulled the victim \r\n  up some stairs, pushed her through one room and into another, pushed her down \r\n  on the ground and began locking the doors so she could not escape.Â  He forced \r\n  the victim to remove her pants and underwear and then demanded that she perform \r\n  oral sex on him, grabbing her hair and pulling her down.Â  For a significant \r\n  period of time Fields was unable to perform, but eventually had vaginal intercourse \r\n  with the victim. [2] Â  When the intercourse was over, Fields told \r\n  the victim to wait five minutes and then she could leave.Â  \r\nAs the victim waited to make sure \r\n  Fields was gone, another man entered the house and tried to prevent her from \r\n  leaving.Â  She was able to evade this man and escape the house.Â  The victim stopped \r\n  at a nearby home and phoned her parents.Â  The parents took their daughter to \r\n  a hospital, where she was given a complete sexual assault examination.Â  The \r\n  attending physician testified that the victim was â€œvery frightened, crying, \r\n  and withdrawnâ€ and noted that her behavior and appearance was consistent with \r\n  someone who had been sexually assaulted.Â  \r\nThe internal physical examination \r\n  revealed injuries that were consistent with someone who had been sexually assaulted, \r\n  and inconsistent with consensual intercourse.Â  On external examination, the \r\n  victim displayed significant blunt trauma to her chin, broken blood vessels \r\n  around and a scratch on her neck, bruising and scratches on her breast, bruising \r\n  and scrapes on her elbow, pressure bruising on her forearm, and swelling and \r\n  bruising to her knees.Â  A DNA test conducted on semen found on the victimâ€™s \r\n  underwear matched that of Fields.Â  Testimony revealed that the sample showed \r\n  a â€œvery rare DNA print,â€ and that only one out of 66 quintillion African Americans \r\n  would be expected to have the same DNA print.Â  \r\nAfter the State rested, Fields did \r\n  not testify nor put forth any evidence.Â  Thereafter, defense counsel requested \r\n  that the jury be charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature \r\n  as a lesser-included offense of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.Â  \r\n  After considering the evidence presented during trial, the court denied the \r\n  request.Â  The jury found Fields guilty of first degree CSC and the trial judge \r\n  imposed a sentence of thirty years.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Fields argues the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to charge the jury with ABHAN.Â  Fields asserts the jury \r\n  could infer from the evidence produced at trial that he was guilty of ABHAN, \r\n  but not CSC.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652 \r\n  (2003):\r\n (1)&nbsp; A person is guilty of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct in the first degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with \r\n  the victim and if any one or more of the following circumstances are proven:\r\n\r\n   (a)&nbsp; The actor uses aggravated \r\n    force to accomplish sexual battery.\r\n   (b)&nbsp; The victim submits to \r\n    sexual battery by the actor under circumstances where the victim is also the \r\n    victim of forcible confinement, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, burglary, \r\n    housebreaking, or any other similar offense or act.\r\n   (c)&nbsp; The actor causes the \r\n    victim, without the victimâ€™s consent, to become mentally incapacitated or \r\n    physically helpless by administering, distributing, dispensing, delivering, \r\n    or causing to be administered, distributed, dispensed, or delivered a controlled \r\n    substance, a controlled substance analogue, or any intoxicating substance.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€˜Sexual \r\n  batteryâ€™ means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, \r\n  or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of a personâ€™s body or of any object \r\n  into the genital or anal openings of another personâ€™s body, except when such \r\n  intrusion is accomplished for medically recognized treatment or diagnostic purposes.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (2003).\r\nABHAN, on \r\n  the other hand, â€œis an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances \r\n  of aggravation.â€Â  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 580, 564 S.E.2d 103, \r\n  105 (2002).Â  As an element of ABHAN, circumstances of aggravation include, inter \r\n  alia, the intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great \r\n  disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in \r\n  gender, and taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female. Â Id. \r\n  at 580-81, 564 S.E.2d. at 105-06.Â  \r\nOur courts \r\n  have consistently held that ABHAN is a lesser-included offense of criminal sexual \r\n  conduct in the first degree.Â  Id. at 581, 564 S.E.2d at 106.Â  A trial \r\n  judge is required to charge a jury on a lesser-included offense if there is \r\n  evidence from which it could be inferred a defendant committed a lesser rather \r\n  than a greater offense.Â  State v. Mathis, 287 S.C. 589, 594, 340 S.E.2d \r\n  538, 541 (1986).Â  Conversely, a trial judge does not err by refusing to charge \r\n  a lesser-included offense where there is no evidence tending to show that the \r\n  defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.Â  State v. Murphy, 322 \r\n  S.C. 321, 325, 471 S.E.2d 739, 741 (Ct. App. 1996);Â  State v. Funchess, \r\n  267 S.C. 427, 429, 229 S.E.2d 331, 332 (1976).\r\nAfter considering the testimony given \r\n  at trial as a whole, the trial court ruled that an instruction on ABHAN was \r\n  not warranted.Â  We agree.Â  The record is devoid of any evidence tending \r\n  to show that Fields is guilty of only ABHAN.Â  Although defense counsel suggested \r\n  in opening remarks that the sex was consensual, no evidence was presented at \r\n  trial to support this assertion.Â  The victimâ€™s uncontradicted testimony was \r\n  that Fields physically forced her into an abandoned house, threw her into a \r\n  door, pulled her upstairs, pushed her into a room and down on the ground, and \r\n  forced her to perform sexual acts with him.Â  Furthermore, the attending physician \r\n  testified that the victimâ€™s injuries were consistent with someone who had been \r\n  sexually assaulted, but not with consensual intercourse.Â  Considering this evidence \r\n  and the total lack of evidence tending to show Fields guilty of only the lesser \r\n  offense, we agree with the trial court that the ABHAN charge was not warranted.\r\nFields also \r\n  argues that, even though he did not testify or present any evidence on his own \r\n  behalf, the jury could have disbelieved a portion of the Stateâ€™s evidence and \r\n  determined the sex was consensual, and thereby found him guilty of the lesser \r\n  offense of ABHAN.Â  In Funchess, after considering a very similar argument, \r\n  our supreme court held that â€œthe [p]resence of evidence to sustain the crime \r\n  of a lesser degree determines whether it should be submitted to the jury and \r\n  the â€˜mere contention that the jury might accept the Stateâ€™s evidence in part \r\n  and might reject it in part will not suffice.â€™â€ 267 S.C. at 430, 229 S.E.2d \r\n  at 332 (quoting State v. Hicks, 241 N.C. 156, 84 S.E.2d 545).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Fieldâ€™s mere assertion that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s evidence \r\n  that the sex was not consensual and on the remaining evidence found him guilty \r\n  of ABHAN does not entitle him to have the lesser offense submitted to the jury.Â  \r\n  See also State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 22, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999) (possibility that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s \r\n  evidence as to the circumstances of aggravation and on the remaining evidence \r\n  found the defendant guilty of simple assault and battery did not entitle the \r\n  defendant to have the lesser offense submitted to the jury where there was no \r\n  evidence tending to show defendant was guilty only of simple assault and battery); \r\n  State v. Rucker, 319 S.C. 95, 98-99, 459 S.E.2d 858, 860 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (contention that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s evidence as to \r\n  the circumstances of aggravation and on the remaining evidence found appellant \r\n  guilty of the lesser offense of simple assault and battery did not entitle her \r\n  to have the lesser offense submitted to the jury where appellant presented no \r\n  evidence she committed some act that could be viewed by the jury as a simple \r\n  assault); State v. Hartley, 307 S.C. 239, 241-42, 414 S.E.2d 182, 184 \r\n  (Ct.

Coker, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Cox &amp; \r\n  Floyd Grading, Inc., (Cox &amp; Floyd) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  summary judgment to Kajima Construction Services, Inc., (Kajima) on Cox &amp; \r\n  Floydâ€™s action seeking payment of the retainage [1]  from a construction project in which Kajima \r\n  acted as the general contractor and Cox &amp; Floyd acted as a subcontractor.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nIn May 1999, Kajima contracted with \r\n  Cox &amp; Floyd for the latter to perform excavation, backfilling and compacting \r\n  services on a construction project of Kajimaâ€™s in Greenville County.Â  The contract \r\n  also specifically required arbitration of all disputes between the parties.Â  \r\n  \r\nEarly in the construction process, \r\n  disputes arose between the parties.Â  They attempted mediation in January 2000, \r\n  prior to the mandated arbitration.Â  Mediation was partly successful, resulting \r\n  in a substantial payment to Cox &amp; Floyd.Â  In addition, a $70,902.03 â€œretainageâ€ \r\n  due to Cox &amp; Floyd was determined.\r\nNext, the matter proceeded to arbitration, \r\n  where an arbitration panel awarded Cox &amp; Floyd $539,806.70.Â  According to \r\n  the panelâ€™s report, â€œ[t]his award includes all rock cost, performance and payment \r\n  bond, and retainage for the project.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nKajima concluded the matter with \r\n  Cox &amp; FloydÂ  through delivery and execution of all documents, including \r\n  releases and payment of the arbitration award.Â  For example, Kajima wrote Cox \r\n  &amp; Floyd Grading, through counsel, in March 2000, stating in pertinent part:Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  The payment of the arbitration \r\n    award will constitute final payment to Cox &amp; Floyd Grading on the Tennessee \r\n    Metals project, since it includes both the rock dispute and retainage.Â  Therefore, \r\n    in accordance with the Subcontract, Kajima will need to receive the standard \r\n    project documents for final payment, which includes the final waivers and \r\n    releases and warranty.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€¦\r\n\r\n  The final waiver and warranty documents \r\n    are required of every subcontractor on the project and should not be a surprise \r\n    to your client.Â  I am simply forwarding the documents now so they can be exchanged \r\n    for payment within the time frame provided by the arbitration award.Â  \r\n\r\nKajima provided Cox &amp; Floyd an \r\n  â€œAffidavit and Unconditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment.â€ (Release)Â  \r\n  The Release contained a provision confirming â€œfull retainage received.â€Â  Cox \r\n  &amp; Floydâ€™s president signed the Release and initialed the section entitled \r\n  â€œfull retainage received.â€Â  The other required documents were also executed \r\n  uneventfully and returned to Kajima.Â  Among these documents, Cox &amp; Floyd \r\n  provided a â€œConsent to Surety of Final Payment.â€Â  Kajima tendered payment of \r\n  the arbitration award, which Cox &amp; Floyd accepted.\r\nEight months later, following payment \r\n  of the arbitration award in exchange for a complete and final release of all \r\n  claims under the partiesâ€™ subcontract, Cox &amp; Floyd filed this action seeking \r\n  to recover retainage pursuant to the subcontract.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  Kajimaâ€™s motion for summary judgment. Cox &amp; Floydâ€™s argument to avoid summary \r\n  judgment is unavailing.Â  \r\nCox &amp; Floydâ€™s President, George \r\n  R. Floyd, Sr., asserts that:\r\n\r\n   9. Nearly a month after the arbitration, \r\n    Kajima submitted to Cox &amp; Floyd an ultimatum, either execute the â€œAffidavit \r\n    and Unconditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Paymentâ€ as prepared by Kajima \r\n    or Kajima would not pay Cox &amp; Floyd the amount of the Arbitration Award \r\n    thereby forcing Cox &amp; Floyd to file an action to enforce the Arbitration \r\n    Award.\r\n   10. As Cox &amp; Floyd was in \r\n    financial despair, with outstanding loans to be paid as a direct result of \r\n    the withholding of payment by Kajima, George R. Floyd, Sr. on behalf of Cox \r\n    &amp; Floyd executed the documents because there was no alternative.Â  \r\n\r\nThis, according to Cox &amp; Floyd, \r\n  creates a question of fact as to its claim of duress to defeat summary judgment.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; South Carolina Prop. \r\n  &amp; Cas. Guar. Assoc. v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  To determine whether any material fact exists, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.Â  Evidence, however, \r\n  is not sufficient to overcome summary judgment if it is introduced â€œsolely in \r\n  a vain attempt to create an issue of fact that is not genuine.â€Â  Main v. \r\n  Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 527, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984).Â  An appellate court \r\n  reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by \r\n  the trial court.Â  See Yensen at 345 S.C. at 512, 548 S.E.2d at \r\n  880.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCox &amp; Floyd maintains that following \r\n  arbitration, Kajima gave it an â€œultimatumâ€ to either sign the Release or Kajima \r\n  would not pay the arbitration award.Â  Alleging it was in â€œfinancial despairâ€ \r\n  at the time, Cox &amp; Floyd contends it signed the Release under duress in \r\n  response to Kajimaâ€™s purported ultimatum.Â  On appeal, Cox &amp; Floyd contends \r\n  that because the existence of duress presents a question of fact, the trial \r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œDuress is a condition of mind produced \r\n  by improper external pressure or influence that practically destroys the free \r\n  agency of a party and causes him to do an act or form a contract not of his \r\n  own volition.â€Â  Willms Truck Co. v. JW Constr. Co., 314 S.C. 170, 178, \r\n  442 S.E.2d 197, 202 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  We find such circumstances are absent \r\n  here as a matter of law. The purported duress and â€œultimatumâ€ arise from Kajimaâ€™s \r\n  written request to execute standard release documents in exchange for payment \r\n  of the arbitration award.Â  This straightforward communication, controlled by \r\n  counsel for each party, falls far short of creating a legitimate question of \r\n  fact on the duress issue.\r\nThe unambiguous report of the arbitration \r\n  tribunal included retainage in the award, which Cox &amp; Floyd acknowledges.Â  \r\n  The ensuing, uneventful exchange of settlement documents, through counsel, forecloses \r\n  this belated attempt to resurrect the retainage issue and thwart the arbitration \r\n  process and final award. [2] Â  Cox &amp; Floydâ€™s claim of an â€œultimatumâ€ is vague, conclusory, \r\n  and lends it no support.Â  See Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, \r\n  67-68, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438Â  (S.C. 2003) (citing Rule 56(e), SCRCP for the proposition \r\n  that affidavits â€œshall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence.â€)Â  \r\n  Construing all facts in the light most favorable to Cox &amp; Floyd, we find \r\n  nothing from the settlement documents or the written communications between \r\n  the partiesâ€™ counsel that creates a question of fact upon the claim of duress.Â  \r\n  \r\nSummary judgment serves an important \r\n  function â€œto expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services \r\n  of a fact finder.â€ George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, \r\n  874 (2001).Â  This case illustrates well the utility of summary judgment in disposing \r\n  of a meritless claim.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and HOWARD, JJ., concur.Â \r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œRetainageâ€ is the portion of the contract price withheld \r\n    to assure the contractor or subcontractor satisfies its obligations.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  South Carolinaâ€™s policy is to favor the arbitration of disputes.Â  \r\n    Zabinsky v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, \r\n    118 (2001).Â  If Cox &amp; Floyd desired to challenge the arbitration panelâ€™s \r\n    consideration and inclusion of retainage, it should have done so in a timely \r\n    and proper manner following receipt of the report of the arbitration tribunal.Â  \r\n    To permit this action to proceed, under the transparent guise of duress, would \r\n    contravene the stateâ€™s policy favoring alternative dispute resolution and \r\n    foster meritless challenges to arbitration awards.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3699","title":"Rich v.

The trial court held appellants waived \r\n    their right to arbitration by their use of the trial litigation machinery.Â  \r\n    We vacate and remand.\r\n  FACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  In September 2000, Joseph B. Rich \r\n    filed his complaint in this case alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty \r\n    and various other causes of action arising out of a series of loan transactions \r\n    between him and Bank of America, N.A., and its employee, Gary Walsh.Â  Bank \r\n    of America and Walsh (collectively â€œthe Bankâ€) each answered the complaint \r\n    and asserted a counterclaim against Rich for violation of the Frivolous Civil \r\n    Proceedings Sanctions Act, S.C Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 to -50 (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n    \r\n  The security agreements Rich executed \r\n    in connection with the loan transactions contained an arbitration clause providing \r\n    that â€œ[a]ny controversy or claim between or among the parties . . . arising \r\n    out of or relating to this instrument . . . shall be determined by binding \r\n    arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (or if not applicable, \r\n    the applicable state law).â€ Â The Bank first sought an order compellingÂ  arbitration \r\n    on September 24, 2001.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Limited discovery was conducted in \r\n    the interval between the filing of the complaint and the motion to compel \r\n    arbitration.Â  The Bank took the deposition of Rich on September 21, 2001. \r\n    However, the deposition was limited in duration and scope, lasting only 15 \r\n    minutes, and confined largely to questions regarding Rich=s business background \r\n    and the loan documents at issue. During the deposition, Bankâ€™s counsel informed \r\n    Richâ€™s counsel that the Bank intended to move to compel arbitration.Â  In light \r\n    of the bankâ€™s intentions, the parties agreed to forgo further testimony and \r\n    concluded the deposition.Â  \r\n  Prior to Richâ€™s deposition, the parties \r\n    each exchanged one set of interrogatories. In response to Richâ€™s interrogatories \r\n    the Bank refused to answer them in full and only answered the standard interrogatories \r\n    allowed under Rule 33(b)(1)-(7), SCRCP. \r\n    [1] Â Â  Each party also submitted one set of requests for production, \r\n    and Rich served one set of requests to admit. The Bank also filed a motion \r\n    to compel discovery responses, but the parties resolved the matter prior to \r\n    any action by the trial court.Â  \r\n  The record does not reveal any further \r\n    discovery requests were submitted. The Bank did not depose anyone other than \r\n    Rich.Â  Rich took no depositions of the Bank, and except for the motion to \r\n    compel arbitration, the parties did not require the intervention of the court.\r\n  In its order filed December 4, 2001, \r\n    the trial court concluded the Bank had waived its right to compel arbitration \r\n    because of its use of the pretrial litigation process. The Bank and Walsh \r\n    appeal.\r\n  STANDARD OF \r\n    REVIEW \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The denial of a motion to compel arbitration, \r\n    based on a finding of waiver, is reviewed on appeal de novo.Â  Liberty Builders, \r\n    Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 664-65, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n    The appellate court will, however, grant deference to the trial courtâ€™s factual \r\n    findings underlying its conclusion if there is any evidence reasonably supporting \r\n    them. Id. \r\n  \r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n \r\n  The trial court ruled the Federal \r\n    Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts application of the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration \r\n    Act (SCUAA) in this case because the transactions at issue involve interstate \r\n    commerce. See 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-2 (2002). This finding is not disputed \r\n    in the present appeal, so the propriety of the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n    is not before this court.Â  Accordingly, we apply the provisions of the FAA \r\n    as interpreted under federal law and the laws of this state. [2] Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  Under the FAA, â€œa party may demand \r\n    a stay of [] judicial proceedings pending exercise of a contractual right \r\n    to have the subject matter of the [] action decided by arbitration, unless \r\n    the party seeking arbitration is â€˜in defaultâ€™ of that right.â€ Microstrategy, \r\n    Inc. v. Lauricia, 268 F.3d 244, 249 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Maxum \r\n    Found., Inc. v. Salus Corp., 779 F.2d 974, 981 (4th Cir. 1985)).Â  â€œDefaultâ€ \r\n    under this statutory scheme has been equated with the contract law principle \r\n    of â€œwaiver.â€ Id.Â  Although the right to enforce an arbitration clause \r\n    may be waived, federal and state courts have recognized a strong policy favoring \r\n    arbitration.Â  See Moses H. Cone Memâ€™l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., \r\n    460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (â€œ[A]s a matter of \r\n    federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be \r\n    resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction \r\n    of contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense \r\n    to arbitrability.â€); Tritech Elec., Inc. v. Frank M. Hall &amp; Co., \r\n    343 S.C. 396, 399, 540 S.E.2d 864, 865 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe policy of the \r\n    United States and this State is to favor arbitration of disputes.â€) (quoting \r\n    Heffner v. Destiny, Inc., 321 S.C. 536, 537, 471 S.E.2d \r\n    135, 136 (1995)).\r\n  The Bankâ€™s \r\n    primary argument in this appeal is that the trial court applied the wrong \r\n    standard for determining whether arbitration has been effectively waived.Â  \r\n    Some confusion exists in this area because the various federal circuit courts \r\n    of appeal have adopted different standards to determine whether arbitration \r\n    rights have been waived under the FAA.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  A number of circuits require the party \r\n    opposing arbitration to demonstrate it has suffered â€œactual prejudiceâ€ as \r\n    a result of the delay in seeking arbitration.Â  See United Computer \r\n    Sys., Inc. v. AT&amp;T Corp., 298 F.3d 756, 765 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding \r\n    that â€œarbitration rights are subject to constructive waiver if three conditions \r\n    are met: (1) the waiving party must have knowledge of an existing right to \r\n    compel arbitration; (2) there must be acts by that party inconsistent with \r\n    such existing right; and (3) there must beÂ  prejudice resulting from the waiving \r\n    partyâ€™s inconsistent actsâ€) (citing Hoffman Constr. Co. of Oregon v. Active \r\n    Erectors and Installers, Inc., 969 F.2d 796, 798 (9th Cir. 1992)); Ivax \r\n    Corp. v. B.

There, \r\n    we found the party opposing arbitration had proven it had suffered actual \r\n    prejudice as a result of the moving partyâ€™s delay in seeking arbitration. \r\n    Liberty Builders, 336 S.C. at 667-68, 521 S.E.2d at 754.Â  In that case, \r\n    Liberty, the party seeking arbitration, pursued active litigation against \r\n    the Hortons for two and one-half years and availed itself of the Circuit Courtâ€™s \r\n    assistance on forty separate occasions.Â  Id. at 666, 521 S.E.2d at \r\n    753.Â  We therefore held â€œLiberty waived its right to enforce the arbitration \r\n    clause by submitting the dispute to the court and availing itself of that \r\n    system for two and one-half years.â€Â  Id. at 668, 521 S.E.2d at 754.\r\n  We find Liberty Builders inapposite \r\n    to this case.Â  Though a significant period of time did elapse between the \r\n    filing of the complaint and the Bankâ€™s motion to compel arbitration (approximately \r\n    13 months), mere delay, regardless of its duration, should not be considered \r\n    as a factor independent of the actual prejudice it occasions.Â  In Liberty \r\n    Builders, the party seeking arbitration had engaged in extensive litigation \r\n    throughout the two and one-half year period.Â  In this case, the period in \r\n    question was marked mostly by inactivity or otherwise minimal discovery efforts, \r\n    especially when focusing upon the extent of the Bankâ€™s participation in the \r\n    pretrial litigation, as we must do when considering the question of waiver.Â  \r\n    As already noted, the Bank only submitted one set of interrogatories and one \r\n    set of requests to admit.Â  The Bank only provided responses to the standard \r\n    interrogatories allowed by the Rules.Â  The Bankâ€™s only motion to compel discovery \r\n    responses was resolved between the parties before court intervention was required.Â  \r\n    Only one brief deposition was taken by the Bank which did not involve any \r\n    testimony on the merits of the case.Â  Also, unlike Liberty Builders \r\n    and most cases where waiver is found, in this case the party seeking arbitration, \r\n    the Bank, did not initiate the litigation that chose the forum. It answered \r\n    the complaint with a perfunctory counterclaim allegation under the Frivolous \r\n    Claims Act. [3] \r\n\r\n \r\n  In its order, the Circuit Court noted \r\n    that the Bank might have been provided information in pretrial discovery to \r\n    which it might not have been entitled in arbitration. However, Rich has made \r\n    no effort to establish what discovery would or would not be available to the \r\n    Bank in an arbitration proceeding.Â  Concrete facts rather than speculative \r\n    assertions are germane to a determination of waiver.Â  See Microstrategy, \r\n    268 F.3d at 252-53 (finding a bare assertion that the discovery obtained in \r\n    pretrial litigation would be unavailable in arbitration was insufficient to \r\n    establish waiver of the right to arbitrate, opining that such â€œproof must \r\n    be concrete, not merely speculativeâ€) (citing Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Alabama \r\n    v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000)).\r\n  Accordingly, we hold the Bank has \r\n    not waived its right to arbitration. The trial court thus erred in denying \r\n    the Bank=s motion to compel arbitration. We therefore vacate its order and \r\n    remand with direction that the proceedings at the trial level be stayed pending \r\n    arbitration of the claims between the parties.\r\n  VACATED AND REMANDED\r\n  HUFF \r\n    and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The Bank objected to those interrogatories that exceeded the \r\n    standard questions permitted under the Rules on the grounds they were propounded \r\n    and served in violation of Rule 33(b)(8), SCRCP, which limits interrogatories \r\n    to seven standard questions when the amount in controversy is less than $25,000. \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Though applying substantive federal law in this case, subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction is proper in this court because the FAA provides for federal \r\n    jurisdiction of an order compelling arbitration only when the federal district \r\n    court would have jurisdiction over the suit on the underlying dispute; hence, \r\n    there must be diversity of citizenship or some other independent basis for \r\n    federal jurisdiction.Â  See 9 U.S.C.

Dept. of Probation, \r\n          Parole and Pardon, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: Ervin Williamson pled guilty \r\n  to second-degree burglary (non-violent) and received a sentence of ten years \r\n  imprisonment, suspended upon the service of three years imprisonment and five \r\n  years probation.Â  Williamson appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision to revoke his \r\n  probation based, in part, on a subsequent charge.Â  We affirm.\r\n\r\n  FACTS \r\n  In November 1994, Williamson pled guilty to second-degree burglary \r\n    in Edgefield County and was sentenced to ten years confinement, suspended \r\n    to service of three years confinement and five years probation. In September \r\n    2001, Williamson was arrested on a criminal domestic violence of a high and \r\n    aggravated nature (â€œCDVHANâ€) charge. As a result, Williamson was charged with \r\n    violating the conditions of his probation. At the revocation hearing, Williamson \r\n    proclaimed his innocence to the court, but his attorney advised him not to \r\n    discuss the charge. The circuit court, relying largely on the alleged victimâ€™s \r\n    affidavit and pictures of her injuries, found that Williamson had violated \r\n    his probation and that he was â€œguilty of actual violenceâ€ and â€œin violation \r\n    of his financial responsibility.â€ The court revoked 120 days of Williamsonâ€™s \r\n    suspended sentence. The written order stated that the reasons for revocation \r\n    were:Â  (1) violation of a â€œFederal, State, or Local Law,â€ (2) failure to obey \r\n    conditions of supervision â€“ including payment of fines, restitution, and other \r\n    payments, and (3) failure to follow the advice and instructions of his supervising \r\n    agent. Williamson appeals. \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it revoked Williamsonâ€™s probation \r\n    where Williamson was arrested for criminal domestic violence but had not been \r\n    convicted? [1] \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to revoke probation is in the discretion \r\n  of the circuit court judge.Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 647, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œThis [C]ourtâ€™s authority to review such a decision \r\n  is confined to correcting errors of law unless the lack of legal or evidentiary \r\n  basis indicates the circuit judgeâ€™s decision was arbitrary and capricious.â€Â  \r\n  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nWilliamson argues there was an insufficient evidentiary \r\n  basis to establish that he had violated conditions of his probation because \r\n  he had not been convicted of the CDVHAN charge. We disagree.\r\nâ€œProbation is a matter of grace; revocation is the means \r\n  to enforce the conditions of probation.â€ Id. at 648, 511 S.E.2d at 97. \r\n  However, â€œthe authority of the court â€¦ to revoke [probation] may not be capriciously \r\n  or arbitrarily exercised, but should always be predicated upon an evidentiary \r\n  showing of fact tending to establish violation of the conditions.â€ State \r\n  v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 135, 61 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1950). â€œBefore revoking \r\n  probation, the circuit judge must determine if there is sufficient evidence \r\n  to establish that the probationer has violated his probation conditions.â€ Hamilton, \r\n  333 S.C. at 648-49, 511 S.E.2d at 97. \r\nAt the probation revocation hearing, the state explained \r\n  that Williamson had been arrested on a CDVHAN charge involving his mother. To \r\n  support its claim that Williamson had committed the act, the state introduced \r\n  the motherâ€™s affidavit, her voluntary statement, and photographs of her injuries. \r\n  In the documents, she stated that Williamson had cut her on the arm with a knife. \r\n  The state also produced evidence that Williamson had stopped making restitution \r\n  payments. [2]  \r\nWilliamson proclaimed his innocence as to the domestic violence \r\n  charge but admitted that he was in arrears on his restitution payments due to \r\n  a prior period of incarceration. He then invoked his right to silence on the \r\n  advice of his counsel.Â  On appeal, Williamson argues that the trial court erred \r\n  in revoking his probation because he had not been convicted of the CDVHAN charges. \r\n  However, that fact is not decisive.\r\nIn State v. Gleaton, 172 S.C. 300, 174 S.E. 12, 14 \r\n  (1934), our Supreme Court, when faced with similar circumstances, reasoned: \r\n\r\n\r\n  If the defendant's breach of the conditions appears by the record of his \r\n    conviction, the circuit judge may act upon the production of this record, \r\n    unless the defendant shall deny his identity or allege nul tiel record. \r\n    If it does not appear as a matter of record, but has to be determined upon \r\n    an investigation of the facts, the circuit judge would have the right to take \r\n    testimony and determine the question himself, or frame an issue to be decided \r\n    by a jury, or hold the matter in abeyance until the defendant shall have been \r\n    tried upon the charge. \r\n\r\n(citing State v. Sullivan, 127 S.C. 186, \r\n  121 S.E. 47, 52 (1923) (Cothran, J. dissenting)). The Court, however, cautioned \r\n  â€œthat the circuit judge [should] hesitate to take upon himself the responsibility \r\n  of deciding the guilt of the defendant under these circumstances, and â€¦ that \r\n  the safest course to pursue would be to hold the matter in abeyance until a \r\n  jury shall have passed upon the charge.&quot; Id.\r\nHere, the trial court heard testimony and determined \r\n  that Williamson committed an act of violence against his mother. Since there \r\n  was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the finding, we conclude that \r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it revoked Williamsonâ€™s probation. \r\n  See State v. Clough, 220 S.C. 390, 400, 68 S.E.2d 329, 334 (1951) \r\n  (sustaining the revocation of the appellantâ€™s probation, where appellant had \r\n  not been officially charged with assault and battery because â€œthere [was] sufficient \r\n  evidentiary showing of fact tending to support the conclusion reached by [the \r\n  trial court] that the appellant committed an assault and battery â€¦ thereby violating \r\n  â€¦ his suspended sentence.â€).\r\nHaving decided that the trial court did not err when it \r\n  revoked Williamsonâ€™s probation because of the CDVHAN charge, we need not address \r\n  the additional revocation grounds. \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The additional alleged violations are either directly related \r\n    to the alleged CDV charge or the record does not reflect a finding of a willful \r\n    violation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The trial court did not find that Williamsonâ€™s \r\n    failure to make restitution payments was willful, so Williamsonâ€™s probation \r\n    could not have been revoked on that ground. See Hamilton, 333 \r\n    S.C. at 649, 511 S.E.2d at 97 (â€œ[P]robation may not be revoked solely for \r\n    failure to make required payments of fines or restitution without the circuit \r\n    judge first determining on the record that the probationer has failed to make \r\n    a bona fide effort to pay.Â  In the absence of such a determination, a defendant's \r\n    due process rights are contravened by the deprivation of his constitutional \r\n    freedom. Therefore, in those cases involving the failure to pay fines or restitution, \r\n    the circuit judge must, in addition to finding sufficient factual evidence \r\n    of the violation, make an additional finding of willfulness.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3701","title":"Sherman v.

Â§ 39-65-10 to -80 (Supp. \r\n  2002), contending such a statutory award is mandatory.Â  In a cross-appeal, W \r\n  &amp; B argues the trial court erred in finding it entered an oral contract \r\n  with Sherman.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSherman joined W &amp; B as a sales representative \r\n  in either 1992 or 1993.Â  Initially, he represented two accounts, Southern States \r\n  and Wal-Mart stores.Â  His agreement with W &amp; B provided he would receive \r\n  a ten percent commission on all sales he made to Southern States and a five \r\n  percent commission on all sales he made to Wal-Mart.Â  \r\nIn September 1993, Sherman contacted Joe \r\n  Antonini, the president and chief executive officer of K-Mart Corporation (K-Mart).Â  \r\n  Antonini and Shermanâ€™s brother had been fraternity brothers in college, through \r\n  which Sherman became familiar with Antonini.Â  In his letter, Sherman sought \r\n  to sell W &amp; Bâ€™s products to K-Mart stores.Â  In response to the letter, Antonini \r\n  promptly had a K-Mart merchandise buyer contact Sherman regarding the prospect \r\n  of a business relationship, which soon developed.Â  After a small test order \r\n  in 1994 succeeded, Sherman proceeded to sell approximately $5 million to $6 \r\n  million of W &amp; Bâ€™s merchandise to K-Mart in 1995.Â  He received a commission \r\n  of three percent of these sales from W &amp; B.Â  \r\nAfter a dispute with W &amp; B, \r\n  Sherman resigned in late 1996.Â  The following spring, W &amp; B made overtures \r\n  to Sherman in an effort to resume their business relationship.Â  He returned \r\n  to the company in March or April of 1997, on the condition that, among other \r\n  things, he receive a three percent commission on all K-Mart sales.Â  \r\nW &amp; B made no sales to K-Mart in 1997.Â  \r\n  Sherman, along with Jeffrey Watford, a son of W &amp; Bâ€™s owner Woody Watford, \r\n  met with K-Mart buyers in 1998 about resuming their business relationship.Â  \r\n  As a result, W &amp; B received â€œsome ordersâ€ for merchandise from K-Mart in \r\n  1998.Â  \r\n&nbsp;In the meantime, Sherman was increasing \r\n  his sales to Wal-Mart, and began spending more time on the account.Â  Consequently, \r\n  Jeffery Watford increased his role in W &amp; Bâ€™s sales relationship with K-Mart.Â  \r\n\r\nSherman discovered in January 1999 that \r\n  his commission on K-Mart orders had been reduced to two percent.Â  No agreement \r\n  had been made to reduce his commission from three percent.Â  After Sherman brought \r\n  the change to W &amp; Bâ€™s attention, Watford assured Sherman he would receive \r\n  the balance due to make his compensation equal to three percent of his sales \r\n  to K-Mart.Â  W &amp; B also failed to pay Sherman any commission on the Valentineâ€™s \r\n  Day 2000 sale to K-Mart, but not shipped until after W &amp; B terminated Sherman.Â  \r\n  Sherman would have earned an $18,960.48 commission on that sale, based on a \r\n  three percent rate of commission.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Shermanâ€™s Appeal\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIssues\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the circuit court err in finding that Sherman \r\n  was not entitled to receive a commission on the K-Mart order booked before his \r\n  employment was terminated but not shipped until afterwards?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.\r\n         Did the circuit court err in holding that the \r\n  award of an attorneyâ€™s fee to the prevailing party under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-30 \r\n  (Supp. 2001) is discretionary rather than mandatory?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard of Review\r\nAn action for breach of contract \r\n  is an action at law.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  An ordinary suit to recover attorney fees is also \r\n  an action at law.Â  Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 578, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  310, 313 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without \r\n  a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal \r\n  unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œThe rule is the same whether the judgeâ€™s findings are made \r\n  with or without a reference.â€Â  Id.Â  The judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent \r\n  to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law/Analysis\r\n  \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissions\r\n  \r\n\r\nSherman maintains no evidence exists \r\n  in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that he was not entitled \r\n  to receive a commission on orders booked before his employment ended but not \r\n  shipped until afterward.Â  We agree.\r\nThis issue concerns the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision not to award Sherman a commission for the Valentineâ€™s Day 2000 sale.Â  \r\n  In its order, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\nIt is standard practice in the industry to only pay commissions \r\n  when goods are shipped as quite often orders are changed, sometimes cancelled \r\n  and the transaction is effectively not completed until shipment.Â  As a result, \r\n  [Shermanâ€™s] claim on the Valentineâ€™s Day 2000 order, being shipped after [Sherman] \r\n  left [W &amp; B], would not be covered.\r\n\r\nHowever, the record contains no evidence to support \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s finding that this is a â€œstandard practice in the industry.â€Â  \r\n  In fact, the record indicates that W &amp; Bâ€™s practice was just the opposite, \r\n  since W &amp; B undisputedly paid Sherman commissions on Wal-Mart accounts for \r\n  sales he made before he was terminated that were not delivered until after his \r\n  termination.Â  \r\n\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nSherman contends that an award \r\n  of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party is mandatory under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-30 (Supp. 2001).Â  We agree.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The relevant South Carolina statutes \r\n  in this case regarding post-termination claims to sales representatives provide:\r\n\r\nWhen a contract between a sales representative and a principal \r\n  is terminated for any reason, the principal shall pay the sales representative \r\n  all commissions that have or will accrue under the contract to the sales representative \r\n  according to the terms of the contract.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-20 (Supp. 2002).â€¦\r\n\r\nA principal who fails to comply with the provisions of Section \r\n  39-65-20 is liable to the sales representative in a civil action for:\r\n(1) All amounts due the sales representative plus punitive \r\n  damages in an amount not to exceed three times the amount of commissions due \r\n  the sales representative; and\r\n  (2) attorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably incurred by the sales representative \r\n  in the action and court costs.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-30 (Supp. 2001) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  \r\nSherman contends the use of the language â€œis liableâ€ \r\n  makes the attorneyâ€™s fee provision of this statute mandatory, rather than within \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  that we are to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the legislature.â€Â  \r\n  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  569, 570 (1989).Â  â€œThe words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary \r\n  meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand \r\n  a statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Elmore v. Ramos, 327 S.C. 507, 510-511, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 663, 665 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The â€œuse of the word â€˜mayâ€™ signifies permission \r\n  and generally means that the action spoken of is optional or discretionary unless \r\n  it appears to require that it be given any other meaning in the present statute.â€Â  \r\n  Kennedy v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 352-53, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  243, 250 (2001).\r\nHere, the statuteâ€™s use of the term â€œis liable,â€ \r\n  instead of â€œmay be liableâ€ reflects a mandate rather than an option.Â  Thus, \r\n  we find that the statuteâ€™s language providing â€œ[A] principal who fails to comply \r\n  with the provisions of Section 39-65-20 is liable to the sales representative \r\n  in a civil action for â€¦ attorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably incurred by \r\n  the sales representative in the action and court costsâ€ can only reasonably \r\n  be construed to mandate an award of attorney fees where a violation of the statute \r\n  is found.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in failing to award \r\n  reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and related costs pursuant to the statute, and remand \r\n  for further proceedings to determine the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses \r\n  to which Sherman is entitled.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  W &amp; B Enterpriseâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIssue \r\n  \r\nDid the circuit court err in finding an oral contract \r\n  existedÂ Â  between Sherman and W &amp; B?\r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard of Review \r\nWhen the existence of a contract \r\n  is questioned and the evidence either conflicts or gives rise to more than one \r\n  inference, the issue of the contractâ€™s existence becomes a question for the \r\n  finder of fact.Â  See Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, \r\n  483, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454 (1987) (stating that under the common law, a trial \r\n  court should submit to the jury the issue of existence of a contract when its \r\n  existence is questioned and the evidence either conflicts or admits of more \r\n  than one inference).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without \r\n  a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal \r\n  unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v.

Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Anthony Jerome Brown was convicted of second degree burglary.Â  \r\n  He was sentenced to life without parole.Â  Brown appeals his conviction asserting \r\n  the trial court erred in admitting the witnessâ€™s identification of him.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAt approximately 2:40 a.m. on January 30, 2001, Rolston Smith was \r\n  sleeping in his downtown Charleston condominium when he was awakened by the \r\n  sound of breaking glass.Â  After getting out of bed and putting on his glasses, \r\n  Smith looked out his second floor bedroom window to see the source of the noise.Â  \r\n  At the Prescription Pharmacy Center approximately â€œthree car lengths diagonally \r\n  across the streetâ€ from his bedroom window, Smith â€œsaw an individual straddling \r\n  a bicycle at the front door of the Prescription Center, and this individual \r\n  was finishing off the breaking of a large window pane to the right of the front \r\n  door of the Prescription Center.â€Â  Smith noticed that the individual was a black \r\n  male wearing a light blue jacket and a black backpack.Â  Smith testified that, \r\n  while watching the individual reach through the broken window of the Prescription \r\n  Pharmacy Center, he called 911 and gave a â€œblow-by-blow account to the operator \r\n  who received [his] phone call.â€Â  Smith described to the operator â€œwhat [the \r\n  individual] was wearing, that he was on a bike, that he was headed the wrong \r\n  way on Rutledge Avenue, the blue coat, the hat, the backpack that he had on.â€Â  \r\n  Smith indicated he â€œthought [the individual] was stealing something from inside \r\n  the Prescription Center because this white object was being brought from within \r\n  out . . . so that [Smith] thought he was already in the process of taking things \r\n  from inside that building.â€\r\nThe Prescription Pharmacy Centerâ€™s twenty-four hour internal lights \r\n  and its four external lights across the front of the store cast what Smith described \r\n  as â€œcertainly ample lighting so that you can see what is going on without any \r\n  trouble.â€Â  Regarding additional lighting, Smith stated:\r\n\r\nWell, they also have security lights on the right-hand side \r\n  of the building which illuminate that entire side of the building.Â  And there \r\n  is an overheard street light just right across on the same side of the street \r\n  of the Prescription Center which illuminates that intersection.Â  And then we \r\n  also have security lights on our building so that at the back of our building \r\n  sort of shining into the street is yet another light source.Â  So thereâ€™s plenty \r\n  of light right there at that particular part of Rutledge Avenue.\r\n\r\nSmith testified that, while he observed the individual across the street, his \r\n  degree of attention was â€œ100 percent because I couldnâ€™t believe that I was actually \r\n  seeing this attempted break-in.Â  I could not believe it.Â  I just was stunned.Â  \r\n  So I was 100 percent focused to it.â€Â \r\nAs Smith talked to the 911 operator, the individual left the storefront \r\n  and rode north toward Calhoun Street going the wrong way on Rutledge Avenue.Â  \r\n  In doing so, the individual biked directly in front of Smith, â€œas [he] stood \r\n  [at his] second floor window looking down at him bike by.â€Â  While watching the \r\n  individual ride by, Smith conveyed to the 911 operator a description of the \r\n  individualâ€™s attire and direction of travel.\r\nâ€œ[W]ithin just a matter of again a few more seconds,â€ the police \r\n  called Smith back, asking him to make an identification of â€œan individual that \r\n  had been found a few blocks over.â€Â  An officer arrived at Smithâ€™s house about \r\n  two minutes later.Â  The officer drove Smith to the intersection of Vanderhorst \r\n  and Smith Streets, where the police had detained Brown.Â  When Smith arrived \r\n  in the patrol car, Brown was standing and facing in Smithâ€™s direction.Â  Brownâ€™s \r\n  bicycle was located near where Brown was standing.Â  Smith told the officer that \r\n  if the individual turned around and was wearing a black backpack, he would recognize \r\n  him as the perpetrator.Â  As Smith spoke, Brown turned around, revealing a black \r\n  backpack.Â  Smith then told the officer that Brown was the man he had seen at \r\n  the Prescription Pharmacy Center just â€œtwo minutes or three minutes prior to \r\n  that.â€\r\nBrown was charged with second degree burglary.Â  Prior to trial, Brown \r\n  moved to suppress the pre-trial identification made by Smith.Â  He claimed the \r\n  identification procedure was unduly suggestive.Â  He further maintained that, \r\n  under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was unreliable and, \r\n  thus, inadmissible.Â  The judge held an in camera hearing to determine \r\n  the admissibility of the identification by Smith.\r\nDuring the in camera hearing, Smith testified that \r\n  when he made the identification on the night of the crime, he â€œwas 100 percent \r\n  certain that [he] was seeing the same individual that [he] had just seen breaking--or \r\n  trying to break into the Prescription Center.â€Â  When asked if the police said \r\n  or did anything that would have suggested Brown â€œas a suspect that would have \r\n  swayed [his] opinion either way,â€ Smith answered, â€œ[d]efinitely not.â€Â  On redirect, \r\n  the Solicitor asked Smith if he was â€œsure that the man in court today, the man \r\n  that was stopped that evening at Smith and Vanderhorst is the man that broke \r\n  into the Prescription Center.â€Â  Smith responded, â€œyes,â€ and that there was no \r\n  â€œdoubt in [his] mind about that.â€\r\nOfficer Steven Jones, with the Charleston Police Department, testified at the \r\n  hearing.Â  Officer Jones responded to the scene and drove Smith to the intersection \r\n  of Smith and Vanderhorst Streets to confirm the identity of the person the police \r\n  had stopped.Â  Officer Jones testified that Smith â€œconfirmed the identity of \r\n  the person [the police] had stopped as being the same person that he had seen \r\n  attempting to break into the pharmacy.â€Â  Officer Jones questioned Smith as to \r\n  whether â€œhe was certain that this was the person.â€Â  Smith said â€œhe was absolutely \r\n  certain.â€Â  According to Officer Jones, Smith did not hesitate when identifying \r\n  Brown as the perpetrator.\r\nWhile driving to the crime scene, Officer Grady Epps observed Brown â€œgoing \r\n  north up Smith Street . . . [j]ust minutesâ€ after the â€œburglary call came over \r\n  the radio.â€Â  Officer Epps stopped Brown because he â€œfit the description that \r\n  was given out by the witness at the scene.â€\r\nThe judge ruled the pre-trial identification was reliable under the \r\n  totality of the circumstances.Â  He denied the motion to suppress the identification.Â  \r\n  At trial, Smith explained that he based his identification on the fact that \r\n  Brown â€œwas a black individual, his bicycle, the blue jacket, the black backpack \r\n  and the fact that he was where I thought he would about be given the amount \r\n  of time that they had to get over in that neighborhood and look for him.â€Â  Smith \r\n  focused on the clothing to â€œsee if in [his] memory what th[e] individual had \r\n  on matched what [Smith] had just seen at the Prescription Center.â€Â  He declared \r\n  the body size of the person found by the police matched the body size of the \r\n  person he had seen at the Prescription Pharmacy Center.Â  Smith identified Brown \r\n  as the man he â€œobserved breaking into the Prescription Center.â€\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in admitting \r\n  the witnessâ€™s identification of Brown?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, the decision to admit an eyewitness identification \r\n  is in the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion, or the commission of prejudicial legal error.Â  State \r\n  v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000); see also State \r\n  v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. 2000) (admissibility \r\n  of evidence is within sound discretion of trial judge; evidentiary rulings of \r\n  trial court will not be reversed on appeal absent abuse of discretion or commission \r\n  of legal error which results in prejudice to defendant).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBrown argues â€œthe trial court erred by failing to suppress Smithâ€™s \r\n  identification of [him] where the identification [procedure] was suggestive \r\n  and unreliable.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process \r\n  of law by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive \r\n  to irreparable mistaken identification.Â  Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 \r\n  (1967); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  An in-court identification of an accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court \r\n  identification procedure created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable \r\n  misidentification.Â  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977); State \r\n  v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 552 S.E.2d 300 (2001).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong \r\n  inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.Â  Neil \r\n  v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).Â  First, a court must ascertain whether \r\n  the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  State v. Moore, 343 \r\n  S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000).Â  The court must next decide whether the out-of-court \r\n  identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of \r\n  misidentification existed.Â  Id.Â  The Moore Court explained:\r\n\r\nOnly if [the procedure] was suggestive need the court \r\n  consider the second question--whether there was a substantial likelihood of \r\n  irreparable misidentification.Â  Although one-on-one show-ups have been sharply \r\n  criticized, and are inherently suggestive, the identification need not be excluded \r\n  as long as under all the circumstances the identification was reliable notwithstanding \r\n  any suggestive procedure.Â  [The] inquiry, therefore, must focus upon whether, \r\n  under the totality of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood \r\n  of irreparable misidentification.\r\n\r\nMoore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447-48 \r\n  (quoting Jefferson v. State, 425 S.E.2d 915 (1992)) (internal quotations \r\n  omitted).\r\nIdentifications resulting from single person show-ups \r\n  have been upheld by the United States Supreme Court and our Supreme Court.Â  \r\n  â€œâ€˜While a showup in which a witness views a single suspect is generally suggestive, \r\n  and hence suspect or disfavored, and less preferable than a lineup, even if \r\n  requested by accused, a showup may be proper in some circumstances.â€™â€Â  State \r\n  v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 78, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting \r\n  22A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 803 (1989)).\r\nâ€œâ€˜[A] showup may be proper where it occurs shortly \r\n  after the alleged crime, near the scene of the crime, as the witnessâ€™ memory \r\n  is still fresh, and the suspect has not had time to alter his looks or dispose \r\n  of evidence, and the showup may expedite the release of innocent suspects, and \r\n  enable the police to determine whether to continue searching.â€™â€Â  Mansfield, \r\n  343 S.C. at 78, 538 S.E.2d at 263.Â  The closer in time and place to the scene \r\n  of the crime, the less objectionable is a showup.Â  Id.Â  A show-up may \r\n  be proper even though the police refer to the suspect as a suspect, and even \r\n  though the suspect is handcuffed or is in the presence of the police.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Although show-ups have been upheld by the Court, these situations usually involve \r\n  either extenuating circumstances or are very close in time to the crime.Â  See \r\n  State v. Hoyte, 306 S.C. 561, 413 S.E.2d 806 (1992).\r\nSingle person show-ups are disfavored because they \r\n  are suggestive by their nature.Â  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, an identification may be reliable \r\n  under the totality of the circumstances even when a suggestive procedure has \r\n  been used.Â  See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972); Blassingame, \r\n  338 S.C. at 251, 525 S.E.2d at 541.Â  Suggestiveness alone does not mandate the \r\n  exclusion of evidence.Â  State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 \r\n  (1980); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification \r\n  testimony.Â  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977); Blassingame, \r\n  338 S.C. at 251, 525 S.E.2d at 541.\r\nTo determine whether an identification is reliable, \r\n  it is necessary to consider the following factors: (1) the opportunity of the \r\n  witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witnessâ€™s degree \r\n  of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the criminal; \r\n  (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; \r\n  and (5) the amount of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  See \r\n  Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 78-79, 538 S.E.2d at 263.Â  The corrupting effect \r\n  of a suggestive identification is to be weighed against these factors.Â  Id. \r\n  at 79, 538 S.E.2d at 263.Â  After the trial court determines the witnessâ€™s identification \r\n  is reliable, the witness is permitted to testify before the jury.Â  Id.\r\nNotwithstanding the suggestive nature of the identification procedure employed \r\n  by police in this case, Smithâ€™s identification of Brown was reliable in light \r\n  of the totality of the circumstances.Â  First, insofar as the witnessâ€™s opportunity \r\n  to observe the individual at the time of the crime, Smith testified that his \r\n  window was about â€œthree car lengths diagonally across the streetâ€ from the pharmacy.Â  \r\n  Further, Smith stated the lighting was sufficient â€œso that you can see what \r\n  is going on without any trouble.â€Â  There were lights inside the pharmacy that \r\n  stayed on all of the time, four external lights across the front of the store, \r\n  a street lamp near the pharmacy, and security lights on Smithâ€™s building.Â  According \r\n  to Smith, â€œthereâ€™s plenty of light right there at that particular part of Rutledge \r\n  Avenue.â€Â  Smith said there were no obstructions blocking his view of the pharmacy.Â  \r\n  Smith was so stunned that he was â€œ100 percent focused.â€Â  When leaving the scene, \r\n  Brown biked directly in front of Smith, as Smith stood at his second floor window \r\n  looking down at Brown ride by.\r\nWhile the fact that the initial observation occurred during the night \r\n  rather than during the day would typically tend to weigh against admission by \r\n  negatively affecting this factor, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances \r\n  in conjunction with the exceptionally brief time lapse, it actually supports \r\n  admission in this case.Â  Unlike daytime when streets are bustling with throngs \r\n  of persons traveling hither and thither, Smithâ€™s identification during the dead \r\n  of night drastically reduces the likelihood that Smith had mistaken Brown for \r\n  some other similarly clad nocturnal cyclist.\r\nSecond, Smith declared that, while he watched the individual across the street, \r\n  his degree of attention was â€œ100 percent because [he] couldnâ€™t believe that \r\n  [he] was actually seeing this attempted break-in.â€Â  Third, Smith was able to \r\n  give the police a detailed and accurate description of the perpetrator.Â  Smith \r\n  described to the 911 operator the perpetratorâ€™s clothing, the fact that he was \r\n  riding a bicycle, that he was a black male, that he was headed the wrong way \r\n  on Rutledge Avenue, and that he was wearing a blue coat and black backpack.Â  \r\n  Smithâ€™s description of Brown was consistent with his appearance.\r\nFourth, at the confrontation, Smith explicitly stated that he â€œwas \r\n  100 percent certain that [he] was seeing the same individual that [he] had just \r\n  seen breaking--or trying to break into the Prescription Center.â€Â  Smith informed \r\n  Officer Jones that â€œhe was absolutely certainâ€ Brown was the perpetrator.Â  According \r\n  to Officer Jones, Smith did not hesitate when identifying Brown as the perpetrator.Â  \r\n  Finally, only a few minutes passed between the time of the crime and the confrontation.Â  \r\n  When Smith made the identification, he advised the officer that Brown was the \r\n  man he had seen at the pharmacy just â€œtwo minutes or three minutes prior \r\n  to that.â€Â  Critically, there was only a brief time between the crime and \r\n  the identification.Â  See State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 \r\n  S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App 2000).\r\nWe hold Smithâ€™s pre-trial identification of Brown \r\n  was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.Â  The identification satisfies \r\n  the criteria of State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 (1980), \r\n  and Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).\r\nBrown cites State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000), \r\n  as controlling the instant case, thus binding us to likewise find error in the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s determination of admissibility.Â  While we agree that Moore \r\n  outlines the governing law in this case, the dissimilar circumstances compel \r\n  us to conclude that, unlike the identification in Moore, Smithâ€™s identification \r\n  of Brown was sufficiently reliable to avoid violating Brownâ€™s due process rights.\r\nIn Moore, the Supreme Court determined the trial court erred \r\n  in admitting a witnessâ€™s show-up identification testimony where the witnessâ€™s \r\n  descriptions to the 911 operator were based primarily on the suspectsâ€™ clothing \r\n  and race, and the fact that one was taller than the other.Â  Id.Â  The \r\n  witness had not seen the individualsâ€™ faces.Â  Id.Â  The Court noted:\r\n\r\nOf further concern is the fact that Davis failed to recognize \r\n  Wideman at the scene of the crime, notwithstanding she claimed to have seen \r\n  the side of his face and knew him from her sisterâ€™s apartment complex.Â  The \r\n  fact that Davis failed to recognize him until the show-up highlights both the \r\n  inherent unreliability of the identification and the completely suggestive nature \r\n  of the show-up procedure.Â  Further, as to the defendant Moore, Davis gave no \r\n  physical description of him other than the fact that he was shorter and wore \r\n  a black hat.Â  She did not recall if he was stocky or thin; she recognized him \r\n  at the show-up only by virtue of the black hat on the ground beside him.\r\n\r\nId. at 289-90, 540 S.E.2d at 449. \r\nThe initial observation in the Moore case occurred during \r\n  the middle of the day and the show-up identification followed 90 minutes later.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  In the case sub judice, the time between crime and \r\n  confrontation was brief, only a matter of minutes.Â  The police called Smith \r\n  to make his identification after â€œjust the briefest time, maybe a minute or \r\n  a minute and a half.â€Â  This is not a distinction without meaning.Â  This Court \r\n  recently held that a â€œshowup may be proper where it occurs shortly after the \r\n  alleged crime, near the scene of the crime, as the witnessâ€™ memory is still \r\n  fresh, and the suspect has not had time to alter his looks or dispose of evidence.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 78, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  Such is the case at bar.Â  Not only was the crime and identification close in \r\n  both time and location, but also Brown was apprehended near where Smith projected \r\n  Brown would be based on his direction and mode of travel.Â  Although it does \r\n  not fit neatly into one of the enumerated factors, this sort of predictive corroboration \r\n  lends vast support to reliability.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court properly denied Brownâ€™s motion to suppress Smithâ€™s pre-trial \r\n  identification of him.Â  Additionally, the judge did not err in allowing the \r\n  in-court identification.Â  Accordingly, Brownâ€™s conviction is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
